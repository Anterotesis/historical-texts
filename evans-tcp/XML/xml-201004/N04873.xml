<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MY Reverend Brother, Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> hath so exhausted the Subject in this Controversy, and what he hath done is so well adapted to defend me as well as himself, that I shall give my self no further Trouble than a short Preface, to remark upon a few Things that may seem yet to demand something to be said in my Vindication.— And I would begin with saying, I am heartily sorry for the Depar∣ture of our deceased Antagonist, and am particularly grieved that he should be called out of the World in the Heat of this Controversy; for (as Arch-Bishop <HI>Tilluson</HI> says, [Pref. to Serm. Josh. xxiv. 15.] in this Case) <Q>Methinks a Man must be not a little out of Countenance to find himself in this [disputacious] Temper, translated into the calm and peaceable Regions of the Blessed, &amp;c.</Q>—I could wish he might have had Oppor∣tunity to cool after so great a Part of his Life spent in wrang∣ling against the Church in one Shape or other; and that, as far as I could ever see, without any just Argument or fair Rea∣soning; not can I see any Thing more like fair Arguing in this last Piece, than in any of the former, and still should wonder that he could think it such, if it were worth the while to won∣der at any Thing.— I know indeed great Allowances must be made for human Frailty, and the unaccountable Prejudices arising from Temper, Custom, Vogue, Education or some unto∣ward Association of Ideas which may strangely warp our Minds and biass the Train of our Thoughts, though I should scarce think it possible were it not frequent undeniable Fact, that any One's Mind should be so perverted, as to be zealous to the last Gasp, for Doctrines, as fundamental, which evidently appear to me directly contrary even to strict Demonstration.—But as I know I need great Allowances to be made for my self, so I am willing to entertain the most candid and charitable Opinion pos∣sible of Mr. <HI>Dickinson,</HI> and could only wish for the unbiassed Sentence of a good Judge that is perfectly disinterested in the Controversy between us.—Indeed there is such a Judge before
<PB N="vi" REF="006094_0004_10278420A15D7160"/>whom he hath now appeared, and with whom I hope and trust he hath obtained Forgiveness and Acceptance, as <HI>Job</HI>'s Friends did after their groundless Disputes with him; but I can't but think it must have been attended with some such a Remark upon the Cause he has been pleading against Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> as GOD makes on them. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have not spoken of me the thing that is right at my Servant</HI> Job <HI>hath;</HI> tho' doubtless much of human Frailty hath attended this Dispute on both Sides as well as that.—And would to GOD we might all learn to write and speak both of him and one another, as it might be supposed we should if we knew it were the last we should ever speak or write.</P>
<P>I was particularly grieved when I came to his last Words, p. 120, which he wrote in Defence of Dr. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> against what I had alledged from him, whose Notion I take to be the most dis∣honourable to the best of Beings that can well be imagined; and after all he has said, upon reviewing it, I cannot see it to be at all mended: The more I examine it the worse it appears; and I could wish my Readers to examine and consider carefully that <HI>first Digression</HI> of his <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd Book</HI> in which he labours the Matter to prove, <HI>"That it is indeed better to be eternally misera∣ble than not to be, and that GOD may, consistent with his Attri∣butes inflict expulsive and eternal Misery, even upon innocent Crea∣tures."</HI>—I know very well the Dr. pretended to answer <HI>Ar∣minius,</HI> without needing to come to this Extremity; but I must think after all his Attempts, he has not done it; and that whoever will read him with Care and Impartiality, will be sen∣sible that his Talk is meer Quibble, and that he would not have undertaken to establish the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> two Points so elaborately, if he had not been sensible of the Deficiency of his Cause without them; and indeed every one that is capable of thinking and will think, must see that these Points are, as I said, fundamental to the <HI>Su∣pralapsarian</HI> Scheme, and that the <HI>Sublapsarian</HI> Way, which Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> preferred, is evidently but a meer Chimera, and only keeps the Difficulty aloof and a little out of Sight, but comes to nothing without going to the Bottom of Things in the <HI>Supra∣lapsarian</HI> Way, which being founded on those Principles is infi∣nitely worse than nothing.—And whereas he pretends I disguis∣ed the Dr's Sentiments, by inserting an Expression of my own by Way of Explication. I am content to leave the whole Issue with any indifferent Person that shall read the Digression, and compare it with the Account I gave of it. The idle Distinction of <HI>absolute</HI> and <HI>ordinate</HI> Power will nothing help it, and all
<PB N="vii" REF="006094_0005_10278429DFAC7988"/>Endeavours to mend the Matter will be found to be only at∣tempting to wash the Blackamore white.</P>
<P>I was also grieved to find Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> spending some of his last Hours in the several Pages before those last mentioned, in writing over and over again what he had said and I had ans∣wered, about Necessity. &amp;c. I only desire any one that would be impartial to read over again what I said, and I believe he will see in it a sufficient Answer to what he has here repeated, and I leave it to any indifferent Person to judge upon compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing us together, whether, what he writes, does not mainly con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> meer Quibble and look too much like a studied Endea∣vour to disguise Things, and seem to say something, without say∣ing any Thing to the Purpose.— It was obvious enough, when I said, there were Thousands of Things that GOD could not will or decree in any Sense, I meant the Sins of Men, and after all the Bustle he makes about this Expression, has he proved the contrary?— By no Means: For to permit and over-rule them does not at all imply the willing them. And one would think it impossible he should be in earnest in pretending that my Doc∣trine led to Fatalism, because I allow GOD's Foreknowledge, which, he argues, must according to my Doctrine, depend on his Will, or else "some fatal Destiny independent on GOD or Man has counteracted his Purposes and produced those E∣vents." P. 117.—Strange! when he knew I had maintained, as the Truth is, that they depend immediately, not on the Will of GOD, nor on Fate, but on the free Wills of wicked Men, and all that God could will was only to permit his Creatures to act freely, but this does by no Means imply, that he must will their Wickedness, it being solely owing to their own Wills. —As to all he says here of Foreknowledge, it is abundantly an∣swered by Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> in that large Passage you will see cited by Mr. <HI>Beach.</HI> And as to his Distinction of Necessity into Ne∣cessity of <HI>Coertion</HI> and of <HI>Consequence,</HI> it only still confounds <HI>Ne∣cessity</HI> with <HI>Certainty,</HI> which is all in Effect that the latter can mean, so that I cannot see that it at all clears the Difficulty. — Though I freely walk rather than fly, I am under as fatal a Necessity not to fly as I should be if I was bound down under a Thousand Weight of Lead; and so is the Wicked not to be good, if GOD never put it any more into his Power to be good, than to fly above the Moon or to breath at the Bottom of the Sea. —As for my Definition of <HI>Contingency</HI> which he finds Fault with, it is in Effect the same with Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s in Philos. Essays
<PB N="viii" REF="006094_0006_1027842CE948B1F0"/>page. 334.—There is another Distinction of Necessity which may be of some Use in this Controversy, i. e. into <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral.</HI> I am under a natural Necessity of weighing towards the Ground, and under a moral Necessity of assenting to self evident Truth: The one is a Necessity of the Body, the other of the Mind, and in both I am passive; my Body to the Force of Gravity, and my Mind to the Force of Truth; and in my Opinion, in both Cases to the incessant Exertion of the Deity himself, who in neither of them leaves us at Liberty. — It may indeed be figuratively said, that I freely assent to evident Truth, as I free∣ly suffer the Force of Gravity, or the Impression of Light on my Eyes, and as it is figuratively said we are <HI>drawn by the Fa∣ther,</HI> and the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> But who sees not that this is nothing to the Case in hand? — This indeed has been one of the chief Occasions of all the Mistakes and Disputes in Religion: viz. the building Doctrines on metaphorical and other figurative Expressions. — I must therefore still maintain that in a strict philosophical Sense, Will and Action is free and under no Constraint. Be my Mind ever so much necessitated to assent to evident Truth, I am nevertheless free to chuse or re∣fuse, to act or not to act, in Consequence of this Assent; for Action according to the Frame, of our Nature, ever springs from a self exerting Power. — Thus it evidently appears to me, and without this, Virtue and Vice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Reward and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>shment, can have no Meaning, but are empty Names. And if any one will yet doubt and quibble, I can only re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m to his own Conscience for Conviction, and if he will but ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect and think, I am astonished if what I contend for be not self evident. —</P>
<P>And now as to your Piece Mr. <HI>M. D.</HI> I have two or three Remarks, I would make on that. The first relates to <HI>Origi∣nal Sin.</HI> — And here the main Thing I shall take notice of, is, the ridiculous Light you endeavour to put me in by represent∣ing me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preaching a Sermon according to my Doctrine in this Letter, and then using <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Office of Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ism directly after, which you suppose would appear utterly in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sistant with the Doctrine of my Sermon, p. 128. — To which I answer; It is what I have often done, and yet nobody ever imagined any such In∣consistency: Nor indeed is there any more Inconsistency be∣tween our Office and my Sermon, than there is in the Office it self, which is none at all. For notwithstanding the Expres∣sions the Church uses of <HI>Original Guilt, born in Sin, Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of
<PB N="ix" REF="006094_0007_1027842E906A2DD0"/>Sin, delivered from the Wrath of God</HI> &amp;c, at the same time she observes how <HI>Christ exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th all Men to follow their Innocence:</HI> Do you reconcile this last Expression with the others, and then you will shew the Consistency of my Prayers and my Subscrip∣tion with my Preaching. — You are always groundlesly affect∣ing to make our Church as well as our Saviour speak your bit∣ter Calvinistic Sense; but certainly our Saviour when he re∣quires us to <HI>be converted and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little Children,</HI> and tells us, <HI>of such is the Kingdom of GOD;</HI> and our Church in using this Expression of <HI>following th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Innocence,</HI> in Explication of it, could have no Notion of such a venemous Nature as you and your Catechism suppose them to be born with.—The Truth of the Matter is, that by this Expression of the <HI>Innocence of In∣fants</HI> the Church meant their intire Freedom from what was then called <HI>Formal Sin,</HI> according to the Scholastic Language of those Times: And this is all that we contend for, that Infants are born as they are made, intirely without any <HI>formal Sin,</HI> which ever implies a voluntary Opposition of our Wills to the known Will of GOD, of which Infants are evidently incapable. And there∣fore the Church, by <HI>Original Sin</HI> inherent, which she calls the <HI>Birth Sin,</HI> could mean only what was then called <HI>material Sin,</HI> meaning any Want of perfect Conformity to the perfect Law of original Righteousness, however unknown or involuntary, in the animal Appetites and Passions, which can be only materially sinful; hence she says Lust or <HI>Concupiscence hath the Nature of Sin,</HI> i. e. the <HI>material</HI> not the <HI>formal</HI> Nature of it, for it cannot be <HI>formal Sin</HI> till some Years after, when it comes to be in∣dulged in Opposition to a known Law of GOD.— And as to <HI>Original Guilt;</HI> all the Church means by it is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>according to the then received scholastic Definition of <HI>Guile) and Obligation to suffer the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ment,</HI> justly inflicted by the Wrath of GOD, for the Sin of our first Parents, we being all born under the Curse then ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, and therefore are figuratively said to the born <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> from which Curse we are federally deliver∣ed by Baptism, taking us out of the first, <HI>Adam</HI> and grafting us into Christ.— All this we ever allow and preach, and this, as I take it, is all the Church ever meant in these publick Offices: And how vastly short is this of the strong Expressions I object∣ed to in your larger Catechism?—And as to that Expression of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> v. of many being <HI>made Sinners,</HI> who sees not that it is a figurative Expression of the same Nature with that of Christ being <HI>made Sin</HI> for us who knew no Sin?— You
<PB N="x" REF="006094_0008_1027843050506828"/>ask, P. 124. "What I assign as the true Cause of the Creature's moral Imperfection:"—I answer, if by <HI>moral Imperfection,</HI> you mean (as you must if you speak of the imperfect, or less perfect Condition in which it is made and born before it is capable of moral Action:) It is no Imputation upon the Almighty to say he is the Cause of it, meaning thereby that he now brings us into being with only a Capacity of much less moral Perfection than we might have been capable of if <HI>Adam</HI> had not sinned. — He who is sole and sovereign Lord of his Favours, and delights in Variety in all his Works, may bestow or withhold what De∣grees of Perfection he pleases; and as he at first <HI>made Man a little lower than the Angels,</HI> so now he sees fit in Consequence of the Punishment of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, to make him, perhaps, a great deal lower than he made him at first; which he may be supposed to do without any Impeachment of his Attributes, since Man with all his Frailties, has even now a Condition of being that is de∣sirable, and (if he uses it well,) capable of high Improvements and great Happiness — Otherwise, if by <HI>moral Imperfection</HI> you mean <HI>formal Sin;</HI> every Man alone is the Cause of that. — For the rest I refer you to Mr. <HI>Beach's</HI> Reply upon this Head.</P>
<P>In the next Place I can't but remark, and with some Won∣derment upon the long Talk you have at me P. 130. upon Oc∣casion of my having intimated as tho' I thought the present Translation of the Bible might in some Things be a little mended: You make it a Crime little less than Popery to sug∣gest a Scruple about the Exactness of any Passage in our English Translation, as tho' it were <HI>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, divine,</HI> and to doubt of the in∣tire Perfection of it, were to undermine the Christian Faith, stumble the weak &amp;c. and then, with great Decency and good Manners, you ask <Q>Do the honourable Society Sir from whom you have your Bread employ you as their Missionary to make such discoveries to the People of <HI>New England?</HI></Q> — Indeed Sir, I did not think of stumbling the weak by such an Intimation, for I did not imagine there had been so weak a Brother in <HI>New England</HI> as to be stumbled at it, not one so weak as to think the Translation, tho' a very good one, to be so intirely perfect as not to be capable of some little Amendment — I think a Trans∣lation should be as literal as possible; but as every Language has it's Idioms and proverbial and figurative Expressions &amp;c. peculiar to it self, he must be a great Stranger in Language that does not know that sticking too close to the letter, may in some Cases a little disguise the Sense of an Author. And it is well
<PB N="xi" REF="006094_0009_10278434E78A92E8"/>known that as critical Skill has increased, all Expositors since, have taken notice of these Things, and in many Places corrected the Translation: so far was I from pretending to make any new Discoveries. — And it is much to be wished that our young Students in Divinity would procure and peruse such Books as <HI>Blackw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI>'s sacred Classics, and especially a late excellent Piece intitled <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wards a new Translation of the Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le.</HI> —The Difficulty of translating an ancient dead Language is so great, that it is much more to be admired that our Translators should have done it so well, than that, in some difficult obscure Matters they should be now and then mistaken. And we have reason to be very thankful that no main Article of Faith or Rule of Life suffers by it, every Thing that is necessary being very plain. I own <HI>Calvi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> much prevailed about that Time in <HI>England,</HI> tho' it was not the Principle upon which the first Reformation proceeded, nor did it prevail very long afterwards. Its Period was within the <HI>Marian</HI> Persecution, and the Resto∣ration.</P>
<P>And now Sir, if you would know my Opinion of your Per∣formance in Answer to my Concession, "That what GOD in Fact does he doubtless decreed to do" &amp;c. — I must think, and leave it with others to judge whether you have not fallen in∣finitely short of proving what you was to do, if you did any Thing to the Purpose. — That GOD has in fact, laid any of his Creatures under an absolute necessity of living and dying in Sin, or of falling short of such Attainments as he would accept of thro' Christ's Mediation, in order to their being truly happy. — And as to all your long Talk about special Grace and the Promises, I must tell you freely that it evidently appears to me, as well as others who are better Judges, to be a perpetual Course of quib∣bling and dodging and playing Boo-peep on both Sides of a Contradiction. And as for your Brother <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>'s</HI> Performance, which is much of a Piece with Your's and which he calls a <HI>Vindication of Gospel Truth,</HI> pretending to shew <HI>dangerous Errors</HI> in my Letter, I must think it should rather be called a Dispu∣tation against the Gospel, shewing the dangerous Doctrines im∣plied in those Promises, <HI>ask and ye shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, seek and ye shall find</HI> &amp;c. — Not that I need to concern my self much with him according to his own Concession; For he says p. 10. <Q>The Questi∣on is, not whether there are Conditional Promises to Sinners? Nor whether the Sinner's Encouragement to hope for the Suc∣cess of his Endeavours, (which he allows to be great and pre∣cious,)
<PB N="xii" REF="006094_0010_102784367AE00580"/>rises in Proportion to his Diligence in the use of ap∣pointed Means?</Q>—whereas these are, in effect, all the Ques∣tions that I know of on this Head, between us; and in allowing these he grants all I contend for.—And all his Talk against these Encouragements being called Promises is plainly built on a mis∣understanding of those Texts, <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness which we have done,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Who made thee to differ?</HI> &amp;. <HI>Where then is boasting?</HI> &amp;c. and the Opposition <HI>of Grace and Works</HI> [on all which see <HI>Whitby.</HI>] And this Misunderstanding of these and many other Texts, still evidently appear to me to be owing to the want of just Criticism, and to that old Scholastical Philosophy of the Roman Catholics, which perverted the Plainness and Simplicity of the Gospel, being a System of many Centuries later Date than the Gospel it self, and was not at once purged away by the Reformation—Nor did I mean, nor ought he, as in his lamen∣table Outcry, p. 32, to have charged me with, the least Censo∣riousness or Uncharitableness towards any Christians, in the Cen∣sure I passed on that <HI>vain Philosophy,</HI> which, when I know how Things have gone, I consider rather as their Unhappiness than their Fault.</P>
<P>I never imagined but these Promises, <HI>Ask and ye shall receive,</HI> &amp;c. were made to the Regenerate, to engage them to labour and ask for further Measures of Grace and Favours which they had not yet attained, as well as to the Unregenerate to engage them to labour and seek for that which may be called the lowest De∣gree of a State of Grace.—And it is evident to me that as God (who considers all Things as being what they really are) loves, or hates, approves or disapproves his Creatures in various Degrees, according to their real moral Qualities, (among which I com∣prehend Faith and Unbelief) so there must be a great Difference between his Dispositions towards the Obstinate relentless Sinner and him that is seriously concerned and heartily labours to reform, though not yet throughly reclaimed, who must, in the Nature of the Thing, be supposed to have some Degrees of Sincerity and Faith, though not yet to be numbered among those that are intirely <HI>the Faithful.</HI> And accordingly, all the Notion I can have of the Promises and the whole Purport of re∣vealed Religion; (and I leave it to any Person of plain common Sense, not debauched with Scholasticism, to judge who carefully reads the Bible; whether it be not right?) I say all the Notion I can have of the Promises, &amp;c. is, That they are an Assurance given us in the Name of GOD, by his Son Jesus Christ, and
<PB N="xiii" REF="006094_0011_10278438019F7B48"/>through his Merits and Mediation, of GOD's Grace and Favour, and of his A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his Creatures, with all other spiritual Blessings in various Mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures and Degrees in Proportion to their various Exer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons and Qualifications; himself being, in, and through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame great Mediator, the first Mover and Be∣ginner of all that is good in them, <HI>without whom</HI> still <HI>they can effectually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> —Which Notion utterly excludes all Temp∣tation to boasting, either in the Regenetrate or Unregenerate; i. e. according to his Sense of the Words the Good or the Bad. — It is therefore clear to me that his Interpretation very much disguises and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>represents that Text, <HI>so him that hath shall be given,</HI> &amp;c. The Design of which, as the Result of the whole Parable of the Talents, is evidently to set the Christian Dispen∣sation in the same Light wherein I have here placed it.— And upon the whole. I am content as before, to leave it with any un∣prejudiced Person to compare what I have written with your Answers, and to judge, whether what you and your Brother <HI>Mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> have been writing against, be not it self a sufficient Answer to all that you have both been writing against it — At least I am perswaded he will find you both abundantly answered by Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch</HI> in the following Pieces, to which therefore I refer the Reader, and so take my Leave.</P>

<P><HI>And had be not Reason to be angry, for your "wilful false Citations of his Words?</HI> P. 9. <HI>You say to him, that the Contro∣versy betwixt us is not whether our Salvation be owing to the free rich and sovereign Grace of GOD; but whether GOD does re∣quire any Thing at all of us, in Order to our Salvation, or as a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ition of our entering into Heaven, this you tell him he denies. P. 10. And about six or seven more Particulars be enumerates, and says they are wilful false Citations. P. 1. And none of these Things are to be found in his Book, from whence you pretended to cite them.</HI> P. 11.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have now repeated his Charge against me for <HI>wilful false Citations.</HI> And pray tell me uprightly, when you read his heavy Complaints against me, did not your Breast swell with Indignation? And don't you think that every one who reads his Performance, and never saw mine, will certainly conclude from him, that I am a most abandon'd Liar? Nay, and impru∣dent beyond a Parallel? Because, he confesses, that when I as∣serted
<PB N="16" REF="006094_0013_102784431FF31F78"/>these Things, I referred to the Page, that every one with his own Eyes may see my Knavery.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I can't deny, but that when I read Mr.</HI> Dickinson<HI>'s Accu∣sation against you, I felt my Heart rise against you with Abhor∣rence and Detestation. And I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Case is much the same with all other Readers: For all Men hate a Liar. And though Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>has not used the Term</HI> Liar, <HI>yet he has charged you with the Crime in the highest Degree. And I must own, I had rather any Man should in express Terms call me a shameless Liar, than say of me what Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>has said of you. The Words are not so much to be regarded, as the Thing sig∣nified.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I then have the Liberty to vindicate my self, and prove, that every one of these Things are to be found in his Book, in the Pages refer'd to, which he says are not one of them to be found in his Book? And if I do this effectually, will you not accuse me of Railing, and abusing the <HI>Dead?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I think, no innocent Man should contentedly rest under so hea∣vy a Calumny. There is certainly most impudent and barefaced Falshood on one Side or the other. And if you continue silent, now that GOD has spared your Life; every one will be apt to con∣clude, that the Lying is on your Side. And though Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>is removed out of this World, yet he has Friends enough (especially Mr.</HI> Foxcroft <HI>the Voucher) who will vindicate him, if you wrong his Memory. And though I think you are a very erroneous Man, yet I would have Justice done to an Enemy. And therefore will patiently hear what you can say to vindicate your self, provided you don't rail.</HI></P>

<P><HI>No, but then you must express it modestly, and use soft Terms.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I not be severe towards my self, and express my self thus, "If what Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has laid to my Charge be true, then I am as impudent a Liar as ever lived; but if what he has said be not true, then he was under a small Mistake? And pray did Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> write with Temper and Moderation; when the very first Words of his Letter to me contain no lower an Accusation than that of <HI>wilful false Citations,</HI> in English, horrid Lying? Would you think that Man excelled in Modesty and good Temper, who should send a Letter to you and begin thus,—Sir, <HI>"You are an impudent Liar?"</HI>—Every Body knows, there is no Difference between a wilful Falsifier, and a Liar.
<PB N="17" REF="006094_0014_10278444A3921C10"/>And pray tell me, how it was possible for him to know, that it was done wilfully, if done at all? Is every false Citation wil∣ful? And pray does it appear probable that I should wilfully falsify in citing, when I refer to the Page? Unless he had the divine Prerogative and knew my Heart, he could not safely charge this upon me. But I attribute it to the Ruffle and Con∣fusion he was put into upon reading my Defence. And we must allow Losers to complain.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But tell me did not you cite falsly?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare solemnly, and as I expect to meet my departed Friend before Christ's Judgment-Seat, I can't find in my own Heart that I had any Inclination or Temptation to cite him falsly. I found (as I thought) so many shocking Absurdities in his Performance, that I had no Manner of Occasion to invent any, and father them on him. And upon a Review of Facts, I don't find that. I have miss'd in any Citation, even so much as one Syllable, as he did by me even in that Moment he was charging it upon me. But I scorn to insist upon such a Mis∣take; much less say it was a wilful Falshood: For this looks too much like a furious unbridled Passion: However, I desire not to clear my self by Protestations; let me be tried by the Facts; They will not lie; but shew whether I am guilty, or not guilty. And let every Reader be Judge. Pray do you read the Fact I stand charged with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The first wilful false Citation, is this You said to him, <Q>The Controversy betwixt us is not whether our Salvation be ow∣ing to the free rich and sovereign Grace of GOD; but whe∣ther GOD does require any Thing at all of us in Order to our Salvation, or as a Condition of entring into Heaven: This you tell him he denies.</Q></HI> P. 10.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is no Citation at all, and therefore can't be a <HI>false Citation.</HI> I was then stating the Question as I understood it, and as I apprehended this to be the Case, so I refer'd the Reader to P. 47. that he might judge, whether I had a right Un∣rdestanding of it, or not. I don't there pretend to cite one Word of his, how then can it be a <HI>wilful false Citation?</HI> Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> under every Head almost states the Question agreeable to his own Mind, but very contrary to mine; but never did I incline to charge him with Lying for it. Has not every one who engages in Controversy a Right to state the Question; and say, what he supposes his Antagonist pretends to? And if it don't please him, must he be called wilful Falsifier and
<PB N="18" REF="006094_0015_1027844628FDF908"/>Liar for it? Now please to read the second <HI>wilful false Ci∣tation.</HI></P>

<P><HI>But was not you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and did not you wrong him in saving that be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that GOD and require any Thing of Man as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Salvation?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not wrong him in saying this. For may I not judge of a Man's Opinion by his Words, when he pretends se∣riously to declare and defend his Sentiments? I would not catch at an unguarded Expression, but I learn'd Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Opi∣nion of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ced he had any settled Opinion in this Point from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enor of his Discourse, and his summing it up in the End, P. 47.— And pray, tell me, does not Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> undertake to prove, that the Grace of GOD in converting us, does not de∣pend upon our Concurrence, in Order to its being effectual; and that GOD converts us irresistibly; and that he requires nothing of us as a Condition of Conversion upon our performing of which we shall be converted; but without which we shall not be converted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This was certainly his Sentiment, otherwise he would not have opposed you, for asserting, that the Grace of GOD in con∣verting us depends on our Concurrence, as a Condition without which it will not be effectual.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you acknowledge that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> denied that GOD requires any Thing of us as a Condition of Con∣version.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He denied it most certainly, and this Notion is your grand Error, which he has taken all this Pains to exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray tell me whether Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> don't hold that Conversion is Salvation? For he says, P. 33. That as to all con∣verted Persons. <Q>GOD not only will give them eternal Life, but hath already given it; they are at pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent actual Parta∣kers of that Salvation which shall never end.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This is true.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If then Conversion is Salvation; and there is no Condi∣tion of Conversion, but it is the <HI>sole Result of sovereign Grace,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="006094_0016_1027844838F888A0"/>as he asserts; Is it not most evident, that he denied that there is any Condition of Salvation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I can't deny it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I can prove this more directly. For whereas I had said in my Sermon <Q>Grace saves us in no other Way than by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou obeying the Gospel." To this Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> reply'd, I would enquire of Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> whether if GOD has pro∣mised to save us by our Obedience, he is not indebted to us, to make that Promise good, upon our performing of that Obedience, whatever Proportion there may be, be∣tween the Work and the promised Reward? And if the Condition be Works, of whatever Value the Works be, is not the Fulfilment of the Obligation due to him who has done the Work, and perform'd the Condition?</Q> Now I ap∣peal to every Reader, if there can be any other Sense put upon these Words fairly, but only this? That is, If GOD had re∣quired any even the least Thing to be done by us as a Condition of Salvation, then when we have done that Work and fulfilled that Condition, GOD would be obliged, and indebted to us, to save us; but that GOD should be obliged and indebted to save us, is most absurd to suppose: Therefore he has not re∣quired the least Work to be done by us, as the Condition of Sal∣vation. This is the true Meaning of this Passage. And I am satisfied, he meant it in this Sense: otherwise he would have tried to put ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Gloss upon it, after I had shewed the monstrous Absurdity of it: But alas it must shift for it self not∣withstanding any Thing its Author would do for it. And now he declares he never did deny, that GOD required some Thing (Work) to be done by us as a Condition of Salvation, and in so doing he has given up his Cause. For that was one principal Point for which he began the Contention. — But enough of this. Now please to read my <HI>fourth wilful false Citation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You tell him that he</HI> <Q><HI>denies that Vertue is in any Sense or Degree the Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of our Choice and Pains, even when we are assisted by the Holy Ghost.</HI></Q> P. 10. <HI>Now what say you to this?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must observe, I had asserted in my Sermon, that though Faith and every other Virtue be the Fruits of the Spirit of GOD, yet it is not so to be understood, as though they were not likewise the Effect of our Choice and Pains. This Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> was pleased to deny. See Page 18. Where as sure as I have Eyes I now read these Works, viz. <Q>That Faith
<PB N="20" REF="006094_0017_1027844BD0FB7D08"/>and every other Virtue are not the EFFECT of our own Choice and Pains— appears most evident from the following Texts.</Q> There he cites no less Number than Nine Texts to prove it. And yet now (who would think it) he charges me with Lying because I took Notice of it.— Pray look upon this, and read it yourself; and blush for him▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Truly I am ashamed of it. However I will read a fifth wilful false Citation. You say to him, <Q>For you new have as∣serted universal Salvation, and that every Man that over lives on Earth, shall go to Heaven, as much as Tongue can express any thing.</Q></HI> P. 10.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This again is no Citation at all Its only a Conclusion I drew from his Premises. And whether Right, or Wrong, let common Sense judge.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He says the Scripture does as plainly teaches universal Redemption.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He says, the Scripture does as plainly teach universal Salvation, in the same Sense and to the same Extent. From which two Premises I drew this Conclusion, then the Scripture certainly teaches universal Salvation. Now tell me, whether I was in the Wrong. I confess I can't yet perceive my Mistake. I think, he who can't yet perceive that this Consequence neces∣sarily slows from these Principles, can't perceive that twice Two is Four. Be pleased now to read a sixth wilful false Citation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You tell him, that <Q>he says, Christ never purchased any Salvation for them (the Reprobates) but only upon a Condition which he know it was absolutely impossible for them to perform.</Q></HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This too is no Citation, I only tell him how I understood him. And I am very sure, I was not mistaken in his Meaning, or else he had no Meaning in his Book. For pray tell me, did not Mr <HI>Dickinson</HI> deny that Christ hath purchased Faith for any but only an elect Number?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This is true, for he supposed that if Christ had purchased Faith for all, then all would infallibly be saved.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me then, whether it is not impossible for the Repro∣bates to perform the Condition on which Salvation is offered, if Christ has not purchased for them nor will apply to them Faith, or a Power to believe? Or can they be saved without the Faith purchased by Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This is true.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not clear then, that according to Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> Christ
<PB N="21" REF="006094_0018_102784539425F580"/>never purchased any Salvation for the Reprobates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only on an impossible Condition? —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I cannot deny this. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the soeve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d wilful false Citation of wars. You tell him "He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that Grace don't "save as is the Way of Gospel-Obedience." What Reason had you to say so?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had observed in my sermon, that how much soever we magnify Grace we must not imagine, that "Grace will save us in any other Way than by our obeying the Gospel." Or that in other Words, all the rich Grace of the Gospel will not save us unless in Heart and Life we be conform'd to the Gospel. I never dreamt that any but a distracted Man would deny this. But to my great Surprize Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> contradicted it with the utmost Zeal, as overthrowing and subverting the whole Gospel. What he of∣fer'd against it I set in its genuine contemptible Light; for which he complains bitterly, that I have made him the Song of the Drunkard. But I appeal to all impartial Men, whether it was I, or he himself that made him ridiculous? But now being a little ashamed of it, he denies that ever he said it; and charges me with wilful Falshood. Now I was so weak. I confess, as to think that when he brought several Arguments and Texts to prove that Grace don't save us in the Way of Gospel Obedience, and attempted to prove that it was not only contrary to the holy Scripture, but to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to all the Protes∣tant Churches in the World, I was I say, so weak as to think, that this vehement denying that Grace does save us in the Way of Gospel Obedience, was the same as to affirm, that Grace does not save us in the Way of Gospel Obedience. Pray what do you think of it? Is it not the same Thing to affirm that Light is not Light, as to deny that Light is Light? Just so much Differ∣ence there is betwixt what Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> really said, and what I affirm'd, he said. And pray was this a wilful Lie in me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I will now read the eighth wilful Falshood charged upon you. You said to Mr.</HI> Dickinson <Q><HI>any eternal State, you say, was fixed from Eternity without Regard to all my Doings or Opini∣ons.</HI></Q> p. 10.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not this true? Did not Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> pretend to be a Calvinist? And don't all the Calvinians in the World believe that GOD has chosen a certain def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite Number to Salvation absolutely without Foresight of their Faith or good Works. And this Number is so fixed that not one can be added, nor dimi∣nished? And don't Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> say the same? <HI>P.</HI> 34. <HI>The

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, if you can make a tolerable Excuse for the ninth and last wilful false Citation, I'll say no more about this Affair. It is this, Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>says, that you said to him,</HI> <Q><HI>You ve∣hemently deny repeatedly, that our Vertuts,</HI> viz. <HI>the Holiness and gracious Habits of the Soul, do in any Sense fit it to appear in Heaven.</HI></Q> <HI>Now what Reason had you for saying this?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The true State of the Case is this, in my Sermon I had Occasion to observe, that <Q>as in the Marriage Feast, the Sup∣per was a free Gift, the Invitation free, and no Man p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d any Thing for his Admission, yet when the King came in and found there a Man who had not on a Wedding Gar∣ment he ordered him to be bound Hand and Foot and to be cast into outer Darkness: Now this Wedding Garment is a Temper of Mind and a Life agreeable to the Gospel, which like an Ornament or Wedding Garment to the Soul, makes it fit to appear before GOD, in the Company of Saints and Angels.</Q> By which I meant, that notwithstanding all GOD's Mercies and Christ's Merits, (of which I had spoken before) yet unless we in our own Persons became holy, and in Heart and Practice did conform to the Gospel, we should never see the Lord. Upon this wholesome and in these Times most ne∣cessary Doctrine, Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> falls with great Severity, and says, <HI>P.</HI> 46. Let them (these foregoing Words) <HI>let them be taken in what Sense he pleases, this Doctrine is subversive of the whole Tenor of the Gospel, and of Method of Reconciliation therein proposed.</HI> Is not this astonishing! He seems as if he never could be satisfied with lashing me for it. He repeats it even to Nauseousness. He puts that little Word FIT in great Ca∣pitals as if it were the <HI>Trojan</HI> Horse, full of monsterous Here∣sies ready to overspread the Land. And now to make me some Amends for the great Injuries he has done me he charges me with wilful Falshood, for nothing else, but putting him in Mind of it. This I think is very hard Treatment indeed, to be assaulted and abused without giving the least Provocation, and then to be charged with impudent Lying, because I presumed to speak of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But what Answer can you make, when he challenges you thus,</HI> P. 11. <Q><HI>Can you with Truth and Justice quote Passages as spoken by me, put them in different Characters as my Words
<PB N="23" REF="006094_0020_102784582519B9F8"/>because you would draw such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from what I have said?</HI></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To this I answer, it is difficult to prove a universal Ne∣gative, and be certain that never any Thing like it was done. But as he has not given one Instance of this Kind, and tho' I have search'd I can End none, and I remember I was exceeding careful in that Respect, not to wrong him, therefore I hope I have not at all injured him; if I have, I am sure I did not design, it, neither am I now conscious of any Wickedness to∣wards him; excepting this, that I have endeavoured to rub off the Paint that he had laid upon his darling Tenets, and let them appear in their own proper Hue; that every one may see their Deformity, I have exprest his Notions in my own Language, while he endeavours to hide their Deformity in a Cloud of ambiguous Phrases, as if he were afraid to let them be seen in their proper Dress; But Truth is so beautiful that it is most charming when it has the plainest Dress of Words.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expected this Complaint. But all the Occasion I gave for it was this, when Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> wrapt up several Arguments, and distinct Notions in one complicated Sentence, I presumed to take them asunder. This I did in Order to examine every Argument and every Part distinctly, and to avoid Confusion. But at the same Time I was conscientiously careful, not to add, or diminish, nor alter his Sense, but took more Pains rightly to understand him, than to answer him. Be∣sides, I ever directed the Reader to the Page, where he might see the whole Sentence with its Connection, and the whole Re∣tinue of Repetitions attending it. And more than this, I de∣sire no Antagonist to do for me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Accusation is perfectly groundless, I have indeed shewed, that his Doctrine represents the ever blessed GOD as the Author of Sin, of Cruelty and Insincerity. But pray how
<PB N="24" REF="006094_0021_1027845B24F0B210"/>is this a Violation of the third Commandment? Doth not the holy Scripture speak reverently of GOD? And yet it uses these and the like <HI>hypothetical</HI> and <HI>conditional</HI> Expressions, <HI>GOD is not a Man thus he should be. He who believeth not hath made GOD a Liar.</HI> Have I used any Language, that was more irreverent than this, while I was vindicating the holy and reverend Name of GOD, from the foul Imputations of these Men? If this be taking GOD's Name in vain, then a Blasphemer can never be convicted of his Crime in any Court, for the Evidence must not repeat his Blasphemy. I confess it shocks me to mention the vile and horrid Things which these Men impute to GOD. Only let them desist writ∣ing such horrid Things to us, and they shall not be so much as named among us.</P>

<P>Our blessed Saviour's Words are fulfill'd, <HI>With what Mea∣sure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</HI> When Men treat others with Candor, they are intitled to the same kind Treatment again. But when a Man thinks, I am <HI>the People</HI> and <HI>Wisdom shall die with me;</HI> and concludes that he has a Right to assault, insult, and domineer over every one, who gives him no Provocation, I am of Opinion, that every one who is abused has a Right by Truth and Justice to make Reprizals. The Truth is, the Sermon which has occasion'd all this Clamor and tragical Outcry, was a short plain practical Discourse, had nothing in it that could give the least Grounds of Suspicion; and was published with no worser Design than to excite Man to Gratitude towards GOD for his free Grace, and to work out their own Salvation; from this Consideration that the Grace of GOD would not save them without their own Care and Pains: And for this being furiously assaulted and scornfully insulted, in Return I have weighed my Adversary's Arguments in the Bal∣lance of common Sense and found them to be wanting.— He who can't bear to be contemned, should not be forward to make himself contemptible, and at the same Time to contemn others.</P>
<P>And now after all Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Invectives and bitter Re∣proaches bestowed so liberally upon me for my Principles, I can't perceive that he has any others to teach me, provided now out of meer Complaisance to him, I should renounce my pre∣sent Opinions; pray tell me, what are those Tenets he would
<PB N="25" REF="006094_0022_1027845CA74F6E48"/>have me imbibe? Supposing, I would resign my Understand∣ing as clean Paper freed from al my present Errors, what are those Principles which he would write upon it? Or if I was entirely willing to believe just as he believed, I can't possibly learn by all he has said, what his Faith was. The more he writes the more I am at a Loss to know what he would be at. Pray can you tell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, that I can, he was as clear a Writer as any since the Apostles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then you can communicate his Ideas to me. Pray tell me, did he believe an absolute Decree of Election and Re∣probation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, that he did not; for when you told him, that was his Opinion, he accused you with Falshood, and said he chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed it: See p.</HI> 10. 11.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he then believe a conditional Decree, that is, that GOD foreseeing who would comply with his Mercy, elected them; but reprobated or determined to punish those whom he knew would remain impenitent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, this is Arminianism, which you knew, he hated.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he then believe no Decree at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, he firmly believed an eternal Decree which fixt the ever∣lasting State of every single Person and all the Means conducing to it. See p.</HI> 34.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it seems Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> believed a Decree which is neither absolute, nor conditional; and if you can tell me what that is, I promise to believe it. I am so averse to contending, that if you can help me to understand what that Decree is which is neither absolute nor conditional, I will readily acknowledge it. But until you can do that, I must remain of the same Opi∣nion that I was of before.— Now tell me, what was Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Notion of Original Sin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He believed as the Scripture teaches, that we are shap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin: And are by Nature Children of Wrath.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I, but pray in what Sense did he understand these Texts? Did he think that GOD had given us a wicked and di∣abolical Nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Not so, for in saying so, he intimates, that you have blas∣phemed.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then did he differ from me, for I esteem'd that to be Blasphemy. Tell me then when the Scripture says, that we
<PB N="26" REF="006094_0023_1027845FC9E343E8"/>are <HI>by Nature Children of Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Sin;</HI> did Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> think, that as we hate and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> young Rattle Snakes assoon as hatch'd, before they have done any Mischief, or have so much as attempted to bite any Body, merely upon the Ac∣count of their venemous Natures; so assoon as the Embrio is formed in the Womb, it is so all over defiled with Sin, that GOD hates it; and as soon as the Spirit of the tender Infant comes out of his Hands, it is so over spread with the Leprosy of Iniquity, that GOD's Heart rises against it, and he is in∣clined to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing it into Hell fire; was this his Notion of Original Sin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I can't say whether this was his Opinion or not. But this I know, that be believed that Mankind are by Nature strongly inclined to Sin.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't say I believe this, but I know it by Experience. And though Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has accused me of denying Original Sin; yet for ought I can learn from these two Books, I believe Original Sin in a more rigid Sense than he did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Doubtless Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>thought, he differ'd widely from you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he is not the first Man who has accused others of Heresy, while he differ'd from them in nothing but Words and Methods of explaining the same Notions.—I will not venture to say, that he did not differ from me in his Sentiments, because I am not certain what his real Sentiments were in any one Point disputed betwixt us. For as certain as I can discern Yea, from Nay, he has so often said and unsaid, so strongly affirmed, and denied the same Things, that even after reading this last Per∣formance I am more at a Loss than ever to know what his Opinion was. But this I am well persuaded of, that he did agree with me in the same Measure, and to the same Degree as he agreed with himself. I am far from intending this as an Invective or Reproach against the good Gentleman. No, it was owing to the Badness of his Cause. He forsook <HI>Calvin,</HI> and hated <HI>Arminius,</HI> and intended to steer a middle Course, called moderate <HI>Calvinism,</HI> or <HI>Sublapsarianism</HI> a Cause in which I never yet knew any Man engage, but that he was so unfortunate, as constantly to contradict himself. And tho' such Men perceive it not themselves, yet the Bystanders must see it, or shut their Eyes.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, you must not think, that the Bitterness of Death is past with you. Here comes another more dreadful Charge against
<PB N="27" REF="006094_0024_1027846755260830"/>you. For you have not only wilfully falsified in citing Mr.</HI> Dickinson, <HI>but you have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed the incomparable Synod of Dort.</HI> p. 27. <HI>Hear what he says to you, while he chides you like a stern Master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iding his Whip over his poor Slave. Well, (say he to you)</HI> <Q><HI>have you verily transcribed those Articles from the Synod of Dort? Or have you borrowed your Copy from an Enemy?</HI> &amp;c.— <HI>It belongs to you to consider, what are proper Reflections for you to make, upon a Review of this Affair.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is the Matter now! Why all this Heat and Passion! What have I done? What am I publickly called upon to retract? I told him, I had those Articles from Dr. <HI>Heylen.</HI> I told him, the Dr. said he had them from <HI>Dan. Tilenus,</HI> no Enemy, but a Friend to the Synod. Dr. <HI>Heylen</HI> did not (as I told him) pretend those Articles in the same Words were to be found in the Results of the Synod, but only it was a Summary the most favourable too, that he could find. This is all I said. And is it not every Word true? What Occasion then was there for this furious Insul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? What Grounds for these unchar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table Innuendoes? Where is the Falshood that I must retract? Besides, by what Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> himself has cited from that Synod, I make no Doubt but this <HI>Dan. Tilenus</HI> made a faith∣ful and favourable Summary of their Opinions. I think there is nothing worse in those Articles, than in what Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has cited from their Results. — When Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> tells me he publickly calls upon me for a Retraction, I wonder his Conscience did not say, <HI>Physician heal thy self.— First cast out the Beam out of thine own Eye.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Now I am sure you will be moved with what I am about to read; unless you are so hardened as to be past feeling; and your</HI> Conscience seared with a hot Iron, <HI>as the Apostle speaks. And it not only Concerns you but all the present Church of</HI> England, <HI>he has not only said that you are a Pelagian Heretick, but proved it. For besides comparing your Doctrines together in diverse Instances, he has come close to the Point in which you told him</HI> Pelagius<HI>'s He∣resy lay, and says, you are quite as guilty as</HI> Pelagius. <HI>Thus says Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>to you, p.</HI> 34. <HI>Hear his</HI> (Pelagius<HI>'s</HI>) <HI>own Words, —</HI> <Q>GOD (says he) helps us by his Doctrine and Revelation, while he opens the Eyes of our Heart, while he shews us future Things, lest we should be taken up with the present,
<PB N="28" REF="006094_0025_10278464544BFBE0"/>whilst he lays open the Snares of Satan, whilst he illuminates us with the manifold and unspeakable Gifts of heavenly Grace — Whilst by the Revelation of Wisdom he raises up our stunned Wills to the Desire of GOD, whilst he puts us upon all that is good."— <HI>▪These, Sir are his own Words; and have you any where used stronger Expressions than these, to assert the Necessity of divine Grace? The Difference therefore between him and you in the Doctrines under Consideration can't be very easily found— But that this Affair may be put in a yet clearer Light, suffer me to set before you the Sum of the</HI> Pelagian <HI>He∣resy in the Words of that famous Antiquary</HI> Gerard. Joh. Vossius. Pelagius (says he) believed, that our Will either can by its own Strength <HI>(alone)</HI> omitted by Mr. <HI>Dickinson,</HI> chuse what Good it wills; or if it wants the divine Help, he thought that this, by the Law which GOD had at once appointed to himself and to Nature, is to all and at all Times equally ready, so that the divine Concourse is wholly in our own Power,</Q>—<HI>I have now done something more than to call these Doctrines Pelagian.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have past my Trial for Lying; and hope shall be ac∣quitted, my Enemies being Judges. I now stand indicted for Heresy; and with me the Body of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> To this Indictment, I plead not guilty. And I shall use no other Evidence, than that which ray Accuser hath brought a∣gainst me. For I can't wish for any more full in my Favour. First, As to <HI>Pelagius</HI>'s own Words, GOD (says he) helps us— But how? By the internal Operations of his Holy Spirit? No. But <HI>by his Doctrine and Revelation.</HI> What can be more evident than that, he believed nothing of the internal Operations of the Holy Ghost upon our Hearts▪ He talks of divine Grace in∣deed; but then he explains himself, and tells us expresly that this divine Grace which illuminates us, and raises us to the De∣sire of GOD, is his Doctrine and Revelation, i. e. the holy Scripture. External Grace he acknowledged; but not in∣ternal. And he that can't perceive this is not qualified to sit Judge in such weighty Trials as that of Heresy. In this Evi∣dence there is not one Word of the Necessity of the internal Operation of the Spirit upon the Soul of Man: Whereas I have asserted and proved that the internal Operation of the Holy Ghost upon our Souls is as necessary, as the external Re∣demption of Christ. — It is astonishing to me, that my Adversary could imagine, that this Passage, discovered that
<PB N="29" REF="006094_0026_10278468D7069B88"/><HI>Pelagius</HI> believed the Necessity of the internal Operation of the Spirit, but only demed the Necessity of irresistable Grace. I can attribute this to nothing else, but his being so excessively fierce and eager to prove me an Heretick, that it caused him to be∣come stark blind with Charity towards <HI>Pelagius.</HI> So I knew an ill natured Man, who lived betwixt two Neighbours, with each of which he was forever quarrelling alternately; but was always careful when he was in a Fit of Railing at the one, to be excessive kind to the other.</P>
<P>His other Evidence is <HI>Vossius,</HI> who summed up the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Heresy thus, <Q><HI>Pelagius</HI> believed, that our Will can by its own Strength alone chuse what Good it will: Or if it wants di∣vine Help, (which he did not believe) yet it is at all Times equally ready and wholly in our own Power:</Q> Both which Notions I oppos'd (and as I thinks with unanswerable Reasons in my Sermon. The Account which I gave of the <HI>Pelgian</HI> Heresy was exactly the same with this of <HI>Vossius,</HI> for I said that <HI>Pelagius's</HI> Heresy lay in this, that he believed that Man was able by his own Strength alone to convert himself. One Thing more I would observe, Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> in translating <HI>Vossius</HI>'s Evi∣dence, has omitted that Word ALONE, which while it remains, makes the Evidence as full and as strong as it is possible in my Favour; and for what Reason he has been tampering with the Evidence, let the Impartial judge. I have now only improved his own Evidence. I now appeal to the Unprejudiced, let a <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Turk,</HI> or <HI>Pagan,</HI> be my Judge: and give Sentence be∣tween Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> and me and <HI>my Adherents,</HI> by which he means the present <HI>Church of England.</HI> Are we condemned Hereticks? Are we <HI>Pelagians</HI> by Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s own Evi∣dence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I will not give Sentence. But this I will venture to say, either the present Church of</HI> England <HI>are Hereticks condemned by famous Fathers and numerous Councils of the Catholic Church; or else Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>laid his Indictment a little too high.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>I wonder what Mr. <HI>Foxcroft</HI> meant, when he encourages Men to read this last Performance, by telling them in the Pre∣face that, <HI>they</HI> <Q><HI>Cannot be in Danger of catching a false Heat, from the Fire of Christian Love, which here all along warms and enforces the Argument.</HI></Q>—If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s be your Christian Love Mr. <HI>Foxcroft,</HI> to condemn Millions of Christians both living and dead for Hereticks, not only without any Evidence, but even against the strongest Evidence in the World, pray tell me

<P>I did so, but am shock'd to observe, how good Men, when at the Head of a Party will be deceived by their own Hearts; and know not what Spirit they are of.

<P>No, it does not indeed. For the Words <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Elect</HI> often carry a very different Sense both in the holy Bible and in the Common Prayer, from the Word <HI>Predestination</HI> in the 17th Article, which I observed to him, but he chose not to take Notice les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it should spoil his Sport.

<P>With all my Heart, let us here join Issue, and let the whose Controversy be tried by the Article of Free Will, as it is laid down in this Book.

<P><HI>The Article of</HI> FREE WILL.</P>
<Q><P>The Commandments and Threatnings of Almighty GOD in Scripture, whereby Man is called upon, and put in Remem∣brance of what GOD would have him to do most evi∣dently do express and declare, that Man hath Free-Will also now after the Fall of our first Father <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI> as plainly ap∣peareth in these Places following: <HI>Be not overcome of Evil; Neglect not the Grace that is in thee; Love not the World,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments.</HI> Which undoubtedly should be said in vain, unless there were some Faculty, or Power left in Man, whereby he may by the help and Grace of GOD, if he will receive it when it is offered him) understand his Commandments, and freely
<PB N="32" REF="006094_0029_10278473ED54C838"/>consent unto, and obey them: Which Thing of the Catho∣lick Fathers is called Free Will, which if we will describe, we may <HI>call</HI> it conveniently in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Men, a certain Power of the Will, joined with Reason, whereby a reasonable Crea∣ture, without Constraint in Things of Reason, discerneth and willeth Good and Evil; but it willeth not the Good which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acceptable to GOD except it be holpen with Grace; but that which is ill, it wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth of it self. And therefore other Men define Free Will in this wise, Free-Will in a Power and Reason of Will by which Good is chosen by the Assistance of Grace, as Evil is chosen without the Assistance of the same.</P>
<P>Howbeit the State and Condition of Free-Will was other∣wise in our first Parents, before they sinned, than it was either in them or their Posterity after they had sinned. For our first Parents <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> until they wounded and overthrew themselves by Sin, had so in Possession the said Power of Free-Will by the most liberal Gift and Grace of GOD their Maker, that not only they might eschew all manner of Sin, but also know GOD, and love him, and fulfill all Things pertaining to your Felicity and Welfare. For they were made righteous, and to the Image and Si∣militude of GOD, having Power of Free Will (as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> saith) to obey or disobey, so that by Obedience they might live, and by Disobedience they should worthily deserve to die. For the wise Man affirmeth of them, that the State of them was of this sort in the Beginning, saying, <HI>God in the Beginning did create Man and lest him in the Hands of his own Counsel, he gave unto him his Precepts and Commandments, saying, if thou wilt keep these Commandments, they shall preserve thee; He hath set before thee Fire and Water, put forth thy Hand to whether thou wilt, before Man is Life and Death, Good and Evil, what him listeth that shall he have.</HI> From this most happy Estate our first Parents falling by Disobedience, most grievously hurted themselves, and their Posterity, for besides many other Evils that came by that Transgression, the high Power of Man's Reason and Freedom of Will were wounded and corrupted, and all Men thereby bro't into such Blindness and Infirmity, that they cannot eschew Sin except they be made free and illuminated by an espe∣cial Grace, that is to say, by a supernatural Help, and working of the Holy Ghost, which although the Goodness
<PB N="33" REF="006094_0030_10278478AE340890"/>of GOD offers to all Men, yet they only enjoy it, which by their Free-Will do accept and embrace the same.— Nor they also that be holpen by the said Grace can ac∣complish and perform Things that be for their Wealth, but with much Labour and Endeavour; so great is in our Nature the Corruption of the first Sin, and the hea∣vy Burthen bearing us down to Evil. For truly albeit the Light of Reason doth abide, yet it is much darkened, and with much Difficulty doth discern the Things that be inferior, and pertain to this present Life, but to understand and perceive the Things that be spiritual, and pertain to that everlasting Life, it is of itself unable. And so likewise there remaineth a certain Freedom of the Will in those Things which do pertain unto the Desires and Works of this present Life; yet to perform spiritual and heavenly Things Free-Will of it self is unsufficient, and therefore the Power of Man's Free Will being thus wounded and decaved hath need of a Physician to heal it, and one help to repair it, that it may receive Light and Strength, whereby it may be so, and have Power to do those godly and spiritual Things, which before the Fall of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> it was able and might have done. To this Blind∣ness &amp; Infirmity of Man's Nature, proceeding of Original Sin, the Prophet <HI>David</HI> hath regard when he desired his Eyes to be lightned of Almighty GOD that he might consider the marvellous Things that be in his Law. And also the Pro∣phet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</HI> saying▪ <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> while. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> also plainly declareth the same, saying, we conclude that Free Will is in Man after his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which Thing whoso denieth, is not a catholic Man▪ but in spiritual Desires and Works to please GOD, it is so weak and feeble, that it cannot either begin or perform them, unless by the Grace and Holy of GOD it be prevented and holpen. And hereby it appeareth, that Man's Strength and Will in all Things which be helpful to the Soul, and shall please GOD, hath need of the Graces of the Holy Ghost, by which such Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e inspired to Men, and Strength and Constancy given to perform them, if they do not wilfully refuse the said Grace offered to them. And likewise as many Things be in the Scripture which do shew Free Will to be in Man, so there be no fewer Places in Scripture which declare the Grace of God to be so necessary, that if by it Free-Will be not prevented and holpen, it neither can do, nor will
<PB N="34" REF="006094_0031_1027847A3683B040"/>any Thing good and godly, of which sort be these Scrip∣tures following, <HI>without me you can do nothing. No Man cometh to me except it be given him of my Father. We be not sufficient of ourselves, as of ourselves to think any good Thing.</HI> According to which Scriptures, and such other like if fol∣loweth, that Free-Will before it may will, or think any godly Thing must be holpen with the Grace of Christ, and by his Spirit be prevented and inspired, that it may be able thereunto. And being so made able may from thence forth work together with Grace; and by the same sustained, holpen and maintained, may both accomplish good Works, and avoid Sin, and persevere also, and increase in Grace. It is true of the Grace of God only, that first we are in∣spired and moved to any good Things. But to resist Temp∣tations, and to persist in Goodness and to go forward, it is both of the Grace of GOD and our Free Will and Endea∣vour. And finally, after we have persevered unto the End, to be crowned with Glory therefore, is the Gift and Mercy of GOD, who of his bountiful Goodness hath or∣dained that Reward to be given after this Life according to such good Works as be done in this Life by his Grace. Therefore Men ought with much Diligence and Gratitude of Mind to consider and regard the Inspiration and whole∣some Motions of the Holy Ghost, and to embrace the Grace of GOD which is offered unto them in Christ, and moveth them to work good Things. And furthermore, to go about by all Means to shew themselves such as unto whom the Grace of GOD is not given in vain. And when they do settle, that notwithstanding their Diligence, yet through their Infirmity they be not able to do that they desire, then they ought earnestly and with a fervent Devotion and sted∣fast Faith to ask of him which giveth the Beginning, that he would vouchsafe to perform it. Which Thing GOD will undoubtedly grant, according to his Promise, to such as per∣severe in calling upon him. For he is naturally good, and willeth all Men to be saved, and careth for them, and pro∣videth all Things by which they may be saved, except by their own Malice they will be evil, and so by the righteous Judgment of GOD perish and be lost. For truly Men be to themselves the Author of Sin and Damnation. GOD is neither the Author of Sin, nor the Cause of Damnation, and yet doth he most righteously damn those
<PB N="35" REF="006094_0032_1027847E5991AB68"/>Men that do with Vices corrupt their Nature which he made good, and do abuse the same to evil Desires, against his most holy Will. Wherefore Men be to be warned that they do not impute to GOD their Vice or their Damnation, but to themselves who by Free-Will have abused the Grace and Benefits of God. All Men be also to be admonished and chiefly Preachers, that in this high Matter they look on both Sides, so temper and moderate themselves, that neither they so preach the Grace of GOD as to take away thereby Free-Will, nor on the other Side so extol Free-Will, that Injuiry be done to the Grace of GOD.</P></Q>
<P>This Doctrine of the Concurrence of Free-Grace and Free-Will was the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> 200 Years ago, at the Dawning of the Reformation; and has ever been the same. Let those Calumniators who are perpetually accusing us of forsaking the first Doctrines of our Church, look upon this, and exert their utmost Skill; and I am sure they will not be able to discover that we now vary from it, so much as one Hair's Breadth. For my Part I could not possibly express the Sentiments of my own Soul, both with Regard to Origi∣nal Sin, Free-Grace and Free-Will, more exactly than they are here exprest. This is the Doctrine I have ever taught, and hope to hold fast till Death. Let Men of Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> Temper revile me as much as they please, and call me by the Names of all the detestable Hereticks that have ever appeared, yet this is my Protestation. If the Doctrines here laid down, be <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> if they be <HI>Arminianism,</HI> or contrary to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> then am I a <HI>Pelagian,</HI> an <HI>Arminian</HI> and an Enemy to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but not otherwise. Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> confidently appeals to the Reader, which of us has the best Claim to this Article of Free-Will. Now that the Reader may easier and with more Dispatch form a Judgment, I'll set a small Specimen of Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Doctrine on the one Hand, mine on the other, and the Church's Doctrine in the middle.</P>
<P><HI>My Sermon.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason why any are not con∣verted and saved, is because they don't concur and co-ope∣rate with divine Grace. Neither GOD's Grace, nor our own Endeavours alone will save us; both must go toge∣ther, if either be wanting we shall perish. GOD's Grace will never be wanting to us if we be not false and treacherous to our selves. P. 20.</P>
<P><HI>Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>All Men are bro't into such Blindness and Infirmity, that they cannot eschew Sin except they be made free and illu∣minated by an espe∣cial Grace, that is to say, by a super∣natural Help and Working of the Holy Ghost, which although the Good∣ness of GOD offers to all Men, yet they only enjoy it, which by their Free-Will do accept and em∣brace the same.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Dickinson.</P>
<P>The Question is a∣bout inherent Grace, or internal Help of the Spirit, whether all Men in common have what is suffici∣ent to Salvation? This you hold in the Affirmative; I in the Negative. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. GOD has not uni∣versally and indiffer∣ently given Grace to all Men sufficient to their eternal Sal∣vation. Page 73. It follows then with the greatest Certain∣ty, that all Men have not such Grace given them, as will even by the highest and best Improve∣ment, intitle them to Salvation. p. 110.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="006094_0033_1027848332827B20"/>
Here they declare, that special Grace, that is to say, that su∣pernatural Help and Working of the Holy Ghost which illumi∣nates Men and makes them free from the Blindness and Infir∣mity that came by Sin, GOD offers to all Men. Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> says no, he does not. They say the Reason why some enjoy this special Grace and are saved while others enjoy it not, but perish in their Sins, is because some by their Free-Will do accept and embrace it. This i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> so bitterly reproaches me for. This is the Occasion of all his tragical Outcries, of <HI>Pelagianism</HI> and contradicting all Protestant Churches. And could he say, that he held with these Men that special Grace is offered to all Men, but they only enjoy it who by their Free-Will accept it and embrace it? Then the Controversy is at an End: Then he came over to our Side. For this was the worst Thing he blamed me for. This he contradicted and denied almost as many Times (for ought I know) as there are Pages in his Book, and yet at the same Time he had the Assurance to appeal chearfully to these Paragraphs to decide the Question betwixt us, and says they are so plain and full on his Side that there <HI>needs

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Enough of this, I am satisfied, which of you has the best Claim, though you are both equally confident.— But I have one Thing more to observe, Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>still persists in it, that all the Protestant Churches in the World are against you; Nay that the Augustin Confession is contrary to you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Abstract from the Augustin confession which I put into my Defence, I had from Dr. <HI>Heylen.</HI>—He refers to the several Chapters from whence they are taken, there can therefore be no Deceit in the Affair. Where Mr. <HI>Dick∣inson</HI> found his, he don't tell us. But even that I heartily Assent to in every Part, in its plain proper grammatical Sense. And all his affirmations to the contrary are injurious, uncivil, and abusive. I know my own Heart whether I assent to a Proposition better than he does.—If a Man should be con∣tinually teezing you, by telling you, that you are no Chri∣stian, for you don't believe the Apostles Creed; and you should assure him that you did heartily believe it, in the pro∣per grammatical Sense, or in the same Sense in which Chri∣stians generally understand it: And yet he should still persist to cast it in your Teeth in all Companies, would you not at least account him very uncivil and abusive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I own, I should.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has not Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Conduct been very much the same towards me: And indeed the Body of our Clergy? Has he not been continually casting it in my Teeth that I am no Protestant, because I disown the Confessions of Faith received by every Protestant Church on Earth: Even the Augustin Confession in which the greater Part of Protestants agree? Does he not accuse me of dissembling with GOD and Man, when I signed the Articles of the Church of <HI>En∣gland?</HI> When mine own Conscience tells me I heartily be∣lieve the Augustin Confession, and the Articles of our Church too. What Name does such Treatment deserve? Is it civil? Is it manly? Is it like a Christian or Gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, let all that has been said pass for Nothing. Truth is Truth, let who will embrace or reject it. The Controversy should be not what this or that Man says, but what saith the Scripture: If you can by the holy Bible vindicate your Sermon, you need not be farther concerned about it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my Sense of the Matter. The holy Scripture is
<PB N="38" REF="006094_0035_1027848922ABEA60"/>the only Test of Orthodoxy. By this let us try every Point that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has condemned.</P>
</SP>
<P N="1">1. Of UNIVERSAL REDEMPTION.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Tell me now, how far does Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>agree with you is the Point of Redemption?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He agrees with me in asserting, that Christ died for all Men, P. 21. and so has renounced his Catechism both shorter and larger, unless Christ died for those whom he never re∣deemed; as I observ'd before. All the Calvinists I ever con∣versed with, were wont to say, that Christ only for the <HI>Elect,</HI> and no other <HI>are redeem'd by him.</HI> And whereas the holy Bible informs us, that Christ died for all Men; they tell us it means, only some of all Sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> the Elect. But Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> con∣tradicts them, and joyns with me, in asserting that he died for every Individual of the human Race.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Now tell me wherein he differs from you: and how be states the Question.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He states it thus; <Q><HI>The true Question, says he, is whether our blessed Saviour, who has wrought out such a sufficient Redemption for all the World— Has not designed a distinguishing Application of this Redemption to some, in effectual Calling, be∣yond what he has designed for others: and whether he has not undertaken, not only to purchase for these the Privilege, that they shall be saved in case they believe, but also to purchase for them and before upon them the Spirit of Grace, to put within them that Principle of Faith, whereby they certainly will believe and be saved? — And whether the blessed Redeemer has under∣taken to bestow these Benefits and Privileges upon all the rest of Mankind, in the same manner as upon the Elect of GOD?</HI></Q> P. 51, 52. — Now to take no Notice of the Propriety and Elegance of this Language, viz. Christ dying for Men to bestow upon them Privileges, and <HI>put within them a Principle of Faith;</HI> what I would observe is, that he asserts that Christ has wrought out a <HI>sufficient Redemption</HI> for all the World. Now this is all I desire: I have nothing more to contend for. I never taught universal Redemption in any other Sense; or in stronger Terms. Only admit (as he does) that Christ's Redemption is sufficient for all; and the Controversy is at an End. For if the Redemption be sufficient for all, then it must be a Purchase of every Thing necessa∣ry on GOD's Part for the Salvation of all. Then are all put into
<PB N="39" REF="006094_0036_1027848C46BEBEE0"/>a salvable Condition; so that they may be saved if they will do what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And indeed if the Redemption of Christ don't contain so much as this, it can be neither sufficient, nor indeed any eternal Redemption at all. In a Word, that Redemption which is not sufficient to save from Hell, is none of Christ's Re∣demption. He never did his Work by the Halves. So that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has decided the Controversy in our Favour, by stating the Question according to his own Mind.</P>
<P>Further I observe, when he says, <Q><HI>Our Lord has not, in like Manner, undertaken to apply his saving Benefits to all the rest of the World,</HI></Q> P. 53. he means that Christ doth not apply it to them at all. No, nor never intended to apply it to them; as he goes on to argue; <Q><HI>For</HI> (says he) <HI>if he had undertaken for all the World that they should come to him—he would certainly accomplish his Undertaking—they would all be sanctified here, and glorified hereafter.</HI></Q> P. 53. You see then that he asserts that these Reprobates Christ never intended apply his Redemption to them. And is it possible then for them ever to be the better for it? They can't apply it to themselves, and Christ never intended to apply it to them; he says, and thinks he proves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I grant, that it is impossible for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny but the Elect to enjoy any Advantage by the Redemption of Christ, if what Mr.</HI> Dick∣inson <HI>has said be true, that Christ never designed, nor does he make Application of his Redemption to them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore when Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> says, that Christ died for all in such a Sense, that they may be saved if they will believe, but it is impossible for them to believe unless he gives them Faith, and that he never designed, never purchas'd for them, nor does he bestow it upon them: if this his Notion be just, then it is certain Christ died not at all for them, or for their Sal∣vation, no more than for the Salvation of all the Devils:— As Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> justly observes, in these Words, <Q>Wherefore to force these Men to come over to us, or to lay aside their vain Pretences, and mere Disguises of their real Sentiments. I demand, when they say, Christ died for all, so far as to procure Pardon and Salvation for them if they will believe and repent, whether he did procure Pardon and Salvation on a Condition which it was possible upon that Assistance which he would vouchsafe them, to perform? Or only upon a Condition which to them was impossible, for want of Grace sufficient for them to perform?—If the latter only, it is
<PB N="40" REF="006094_0037_1027848F56829A90"/>certain that he died not at all them; for what is only done upon an impossible Supposition, is not done at all. It being the same Thing not to die at all for their Benefit, as to do it only on a Condition they cannot possibly perform. But if he died to procure Pardon and Salvation for them, on a Condition, which by that Grace, which he was ready to vouchsafe to them, as well as to the Elect, they might be able to perform, then he died intentionally, and on his Part effectually, to procure Pardon and Salvation to them, as well as to the Elect, and so all Mankind may be saved, and them Christ must have died for the Salvation of them all.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, but what say you to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se close Questions he puts to you,</HI> viz <Q><HI>Did not be (Christ) originally intend the Redemption just in the same Latitude and Extent with the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ual Applica∣tion of it?—You won't venture to suppose that he has chang'd his Designs, or failed of Success in his Intentions.—Pray, Sir, speak out full and plain to the Purpose.</HI></Q> P. 55.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, that I will with all my Heart For I am never better pleas'd than when I can find out what my Antagonist would be at, that I may meet him full in the Face. Truth will never dodge and hide in ambiguous Terms.</P>
<P>I observe then in the first Place, these Questions are founded upon one poor Fallacy and miserable Mistake, that is, that the Application of Christ's Redemption to our Souls is so entirely the Work of GOD, as that it don't at all depend upon the Free-Will of Man, whether it shall be effectual to us, or not. This I say is a meer Fallacy and poor begging the Question. For though Christ has fully redeemed every one of us, and sincere∣ly tenders and applies this Salvation to us, both outwardly by his Word, and inwardly by his Spirit: yet may we either em∣brace, or reject the offer'd Salvation. And as we do either, so are we happy or miserable. Christ has done his Part both he purchasing and in applying his Salvation to Millions who are never actually saved, because they practically counted themselves unworthy of eternal Life. In the Application of Christ's Re∣demption, Man's wicked Will to perish often prevails against Christ's sincere Will of their Salvation. This is plain Scripture Matth. 23.37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, <HI>thou that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lest the Prophets, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nest them which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thee, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣eth her Chickens under her Wing; and ye would not!</HI> GOD and Christ willed their Happiness, but these Men willed to be mise∣rable:
<PB N="41" REF="006094_0038_10278490D78F9DC0"/>And their Will prevailed to their R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, even against the sincere Will of GOD and Christ. For I presume, no Man will say that Christ dissembled when he spake these Words with Tears in his Eyes: and said, <HI>he would, and they would not. O that they were wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that they would consider their latter End.</HI> Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had hearkned unto me, and</HI> Israel <HI>had walked is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> says GOD. Psal. 81.12. And dare any Man say, that GOD was not serious in these Wishes? And yet this Will of GOD never took Effect, because they were not willing to comply with GOD's Will. And if you don't al∣low that GOD does not really will any Thing but what does come to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss which is Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Opinion consider what horrible Consequences will follow. Then GOD is not willing that Men should obey him, when they disobey; then GOD is not willing any more should repent and be saved than are eventually saved; then GOD's Will is as truly done while Men sin, as when they repent. And can any Man be so unreason∣able as to believe it? Thus having cleared the Way, I will give a full and plain Answer to that close Question, <HI>viz. Did not Christ originally intend his Redemption just in the same Latitude, and Extent with the actual Appplication of it?</HI> If by this you mean, did Christ originally intend to do more for the Conver∣sion of Mankind by applying his Redemption to them, than he has actually done, I answer No. For he has done all that was necessary on his Part for the Application of his Salva∣tion to every human Creature, even every Pagan on Earth would have the Opportunity to hear the Gospel, if Christians did what, it was the original Will and Intention of Christ, that they should do, i. e. preach the Gospel to every Creature.</P>
<P>But then if by this trying Question you mean, was it Christ's original Design and Will that more Men should have his Re∣demption effectually applied to them and enjoy'd by them, than do eventually enjoy it? To this I answer, Yes: He willed that Millions should enter into his Joy, who yet through the Abuse of their Free-Will are eternally shut out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, but "you won't venture to suppose, that Christ has "changed his Designs, or fail'd of Success in his Intentions."</HI> Page 55.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I will not suppose that GOD, or Christ have changed their Designs, there is no Occasion for this blasphemous Suggestion. <HI>Christ is the same Yesterday, to Day and forever.</HI> As Christ's Will and Design originally was to purchase every Thing
<PB N="42" REF="006094_0039_10278492A7F2B328"/>necessary for the Salvation of all Men; so he continues at this very Day to do every Thing necessary on his Part for the Ap∣plication of his Redemption to all Men. As to Christ's failing of Success, it is unquestionable Fact, that GOD's Methods to reclaim Men often fail of the Success he desires, through Men's Perverseness, even when GOD can truly say, what could have been done more for them than I have done. Did not Christ fail of his desired Success when he <HI>came to his own and his own received him not,</HI> Joh. 1.11? Had Christ as much Success when he preach'd on Earth as he wished for, or desired? What mon∣strous Notions did this Gentleman entertain! And yet glories in them as if they were the first Principles of all Religion?</P>
<P>I never desire to see an Adversary's Cause more effectually lost than when it needs to be defended with such gross Ab∣surdities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But methinks, there is something in that, when he asks you,</HI> <Q><HI>What you mean by Christ's not having procured for the Non-Elect a Power to believe— And says, Does any Man in the World want Power, that is in the Account of the Scripture willing to receive him?</HI></Q> P. 55.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is too childish and quibbling! Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> and all on his Side deny, that Christ ever purchased for, or applies to the Non-Elect. so much Grace as to enable them, or make it possi∣ble for them to will or desire Salvation, truly and in the Scrip∣ture Account to will it, any more than a Beast can desire or will the Knowledge of the Mathematicks; while for the Elect he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urchased, and does apply such Grace as renders it as im∣possible for them not to will and believe, as for an hungry Man not to will and desire Food. Now it is not material where the Defect lies, whether in the Understanding or Will, or both; if nothing but Grace can remove it, and Christ never purchased such Grace for the Non-Elect as is sufficient to remove the Im∣pediment, call it Want of Power, or Want of Will, it comes to the same Thing, that <HI>which is wanting, cannot be numbered.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well! Sir, says he to you, don't this Objection as much mi∣litate against your Principles, as against mine? Don't you yourself tell us, that although Jesus Christ offers eternal Salvation to all who will obey him; yet no Man will ever come to him and accept of this kind Offer, unless the Father draw him, and it be given him from above; and that we cannot without the gracious Influences of the Holy Ghost become good Men.—Now says he to you, is it in fact given from above to every Man, to come to Christ, and be
<PB N="43" REF="006094_0040_1027849DA98BBE00"/>willing to obey him? have all Men actually these D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>vings of the Father, these gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Holy Ghost—?</HI> P. 56.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe once for all, we are speaking only of Men un∣der the Gospel. And now to the Question, the Objection don't at all militate against my Principles, (as he imagines.) For my Principle is, that the Father draws every one of us, and is ready to give us all to come to Christ, and the gra∣cious Influences of the Holy Ghost is afforded to all, till they have forfeited them by their Obstinacy.</P>

<P><Q><HI>If so, them says he, every Man is actually interested in Christ, and has actually a Title to Heaven.</HI></Q> P. 56.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir, here you are a little mistaken, this Conclusion don't follow from my Principle: because GOD's drawing is not irresistable, or an Act of Almighty Power upon the Soul which cannot be resisted. GOD has drawn Millions, who ne∣ver were actually drawn so as to come to Christ. So GOD drew the whole Body of the Jewish Nation, and yet they never were actually drawn to him, but forsook him the Fountain of living Waters, Jer. xxxi. 3. <HI>With Loving-Kindness have I drawn thee.</HI> Hos. xi. 4. <HI>I drew them with the Cords of a Man.</HI> This is spoken of all his professing People in general, every one of them had GOD's Drawings, and yet Thousands of them were never the nearer to GOD for that. So that is often given from above to Men which yet because they don't accept and improve it, they are nothing the better for it— See here the Marrow of this Gentleman's Divinity so far as concerns his Dispute with me. He seems to think, that when any Man is wicked it is because GOD don't give him Grace to become good. For why (argues he) are not all Men gracious and saved if GOD be willing to give them Grace! Just as if nothing could prevent their being holy and happy, if GOD were but willing that they should be so.—You may call it inveighing, or what you please, but I must confess I am astonished to see that your eminent Teachers have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uster Notions of either Natural or Revealed Religion.—Why don't all become holy and obtain Salvation, say they, if GOD be willing to given them sufficient Grace? As if they had never heard such a Thing as Men's <HI>receiving the Grace of GOD in vain, Quenching the Spirit and resisting the Holy Ghost.</HI>—As to several Texts of holy Scrip∣ture here cited, I shall consider them under one of the follow∣ing Heads once for all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray who denies this? All Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s long String of Arguments arises from his not observing one necessary Dis∣tinction, which is this. Christ's Death is to be consider'd in a twofold Respect. <HI>1st,</HI> As to the Will of GOD in sending his Son, and that was that he should die for the World, and the Design of the Son which was to give himself a Ransom for all, and with Regard to the Virtue and Power of his Death, in these three Respects Christ died for every Man. But then, <HI>2dly,</HI> If you consider the Event of Christ's Death arising from the different Behaviour of Mankind, some believing in him and some rejecting him and turning Enemies to his Cross; and thereupon the Fathers's and the Son's subsequent Will which was that none should enjoy the Fruit of Christ's Death to Eter∣nity, but those who comply with the End of his Death, repent and obey him: In this Sense Christ died only for Believers, only for his Sheep, only for his Church, <HI>i. e.</HI> he never intended or designed that any should be saved by his Death, who don't comply with the Terms of that Salvation that his Death has purchased. This Distinction well attended to, all the Mist which he has rais'd in both his Books vanishes away in a Mo∣ment.</P>
<P>And though he is pleased to say, that I took no Notice of this Argument, yet it is so far from being true, that I did in Fact answer it, and he has taken no Notice of my Answer, which was in these Words, Pag. 41. <Q><HI>Have not I chosen you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil? Judas</HI> was as much chosen, yea and given to Christ of the Father, as the rest.</Q> Joh. xvii. 12. <HI>Those that thou gavest me have I kept, and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition.</HI> It is from hence evident, that being chosen and given of the Father, don't denote an absolute Decree of their Salvation. And it is indeed astonish∣ing that he should quote this Expression of the Father's <HI>giving them to Christ,</HI> to prove his absolute Doctrine, and take no No∣tice of <HI>Judas</HI> being lost who had been given to him, which at once utterly demolishes his Scheme.</P>

Of ELECTION.</P>
<P>Here the Question is, Whether there be such a Thing spoken of in the holy Scripture, as a personal Election to Salvation without a Foresight of Faith and Perseverance in Well-doing? This I think, I did not deny in my Sermon; but only seemed to doubt of it; for which Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> saw fit to correct me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>seems to think the Question, is, Whether the Words Election and Elect never imply any more in the New-Testament, than merely enjoying the Privileges of the Gospel.</HI> Page 61.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He chose so to state the Question, because this would give him some Room for disputing. But when in his Remarks, he fixed a wrong Sense upon one of my Expressions I don't say wilfully I explain'd my self fully in my Reply, in these Words, <Q>The Point I am to prove is this, though the Words Elect and Chosen, Election and Choice, to Elect and Chuse are used in several different Senses in the holy Bible, and some Times the Elect denotes faithful Christians, yet never do any of these Words imply an eternal absolute Predestination to Happiness without Regard to Faith and Obedience: Neither is there any such Doctrine taught in the holy Scripture.</Q> P. 39. To this he replies, P. 62. <HI>It this not at all affect the Merits of the Cause, to enquire into the different Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses in which the Words Elect and Chosen, Election and Choice, to Elect and Chuse are used in the holy Bible.</HI>—This is strange indeed! What is it no Matter what these Words signify and mean in the holy Bible! I thought all the Controversy was about the Meaning of these Words, as they stand in the Scripture. If I can but find out what the Holy Ghost means, by such Words, I care not what this or that Sect mean by Election. But there was more Subtilty in this, than a cursory Reader would think of. For by not regarding that the Scripture uses the Word Election in several different Senses, and that I endeavour'd to use it in the same Manner that the Holy Ghost teaches, by this Piece of resolved Negli∣gence, he has gain'd several Triumphs, though indeed it is over Nobody. I will give you but one Instance of it. P. 63. He says to me, <HI>You tell us that all whom GOD, foreknew, he foresaw would he Christ's faithful Followers, if so them all professing Chri∣stians do not belong to the Election of Grace, for all professing
<PB N="46" REF="006094_0043_102784A284B0AB18"/>Christians are not Christ's faithful Followers. And therefore ac∣cording to your own Interpretation this Text utterly subverts your Scheme:</HI> When in that very Paragraph I had told him that the Predestinate did not signify there meet Professors of Christianity. Is not this now infinitely pretty! Has be not cut me down, and demolished my Scheme with one Stroke; and all by resolving not to regard what I say, nor what I mean.</P>
<P>I have read a few Disputes in the Course of my Life, but I never saw any Thing like this. I don't mean, that this is the weakest, no, it is crafty enough: but I am at a loss to find where the Honesty of it lies. I proved by sundry Texts that the Word Elect and Election did not denote an absolute Decree to save this or that Man, but often it means all Christians in general, and sometimes sincerely good Men. I let him know that I owned GOD's eternal Decree to save all those whom he foresaw would persevere in Faith till Death; so that his Work lay fair before him, which was to prove an eternal Election without a Foresight of Faith and good Works. At this my Friend was sensible, he could make but a mean Figure: But an Answer he must write in some Shape or other. He there upon concludes upon this Device, <HI>viz.</HI> to make his Reader be∣lieve that my Opinion is, that the Word <HI>Predestination</HI> in the 17th Article, the Words <HI>Predestinate, Elect</HI> and <HI>Election</HI> in holy Scripture never mean or import more than meet Professors of Christianity: Such a Whim as never entered my Heart. And altho' when I perceived him beginning to play at this Game in his first Book, I entered my Protest against this unfair Deal∣ing, and told him I understood the 17th Article, as meaning an eternal Decree, but not an absolute and unconditional one, and in the same Sense I understood several Texts in the holy Bible. But all that I could say, avail'd nothing, he was resolved to misunderstand, and misrepresent me; and by virtue of this ho∣nest Resolution, he has made sad and <HI>Mongrel</HI> Work of it, as he calls it; but has not answered one Argument that I ad∣vanced, not done any Thing like it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But he has cited some Texts a-now, as</HI> Acts 2.23. <HI>And challenges you to deny if you dare, that GOD has decreed all the wicked Things that ever were done.

And may'nt the same be said of other Events likewise? Is it true,</HI> says he, <HI>that what GOD did before by his Counsel
<PB N="47" REF="006094_0044_102784A42CC22528"/>determine, he wills and was pleased with? It will then follow, that he will'd and was pleased with what Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles did to our blessed Lord, when with wicked Hands they crucified and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w him. For this is what GOD did by his Counsel determine before to be done. Now Sir, answer this consistently if you can.</HI></Q> P. 66.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir I chearfully accept the Challenge, to vindicate the moral Character of our infinitely good GOD, from such horrid Suggestions as though he decreed, will'd, and was pleased with all the wicked Deeds done by Men and Devils. Now then when it is said, Acts 2.23. <HI>Him, being delivered by the determinate Council and Fore-knowledge of GOD, ye have taken, and with wicked Hands have crucified and slain.</HI> And Acts 4.27, 28. <HI>For of a Truth against thy holy Child Jesus, whom thou hast an∣ointed, both</HI> Herod <HI>and</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>with the Gentiles, and the People of</HI> Israel <HI>were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy Hand and thy Counsel determined before to he done.</HI> These Words don't denote, that GOD decreed, will'd, or was pleased with <HI>Judas</HI> his being so convetous as to betray Christ; the Jews be∣ing so malicious as to prosecute him; or <HI>Herod</HI>'s being so inju∣rious and profane as to set him at nought, or <HI>Pilate</HI>'s being so unjust as to condemn him; none of all these wicked Humours and Deeds were decreed, will'd by, or pleasing to GOD, who infinitely hates, and therefore can't decree a wicked Deed: But all Things being eternally present to his infinite Mind, and he foreseeing that <HI>Judas</HI> would be so convetous as to betray Christ, if he had an Opportunity, and that the Jews would be envious and spiteful enough to murder him, and <HI>Pilate</HI> would be so un∣just as to condemn the Innocent; what his Counsel determined was, that Christ should come into their Hands, and be left in their Power, when he knew they would crucify him. Thus GOD without decreeing the least wicked Deed by his infinite Knowledge and Wisdom has brought the greatest Good out of the greatest Wickedness, only foreseen, not decreed. In a Word, GOD foresees wicked Deeds, and decrees to over-rule them so as to bring Good out of them, but he does not decree them. Thus, I think, I have in full, though in short, answered Mr. President's Challenge, and vindicated our heavenly Father from the horrid Suspicion of his being the Decreer or Willer of sin∣ful Deeds.</P>
<P>And now let me tell you, as a Friend, that I can't but think it extremely improper, (to say no worse of it,) to teach young

<P>And what Reason had he to persist in it? Did not I bring a Number of Instances? Has he invalidated one if my Argu∣ments? Or indeed so much as seemed to aim at weakening them? Has he not pass'd them all over in profound Silence? And can you think that such a Workman at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uting would have been so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, when the Merits of the Cause lay at Stake, provided he thought it possible to say any Thing that might be plausible? For my Part I never did, nor ever desire to see a Cause more entirely given up than this, while it was pretended to be defended— But that you may not say, I boast without a Cause, I will give you an Instance or two, leaving rest for another Opportunity (if GOD will) St. <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts, 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>To give Diligence to make our Calling and Election sure:</HI> Which Command is directed to all Christians in general, and implies that they all have a Calling and an Election; otherwise they could not with any Propriety be exhorted to make their their Calling and Election sure. That which is not, and has no Being cannot be made sure in any Sense. It is therefore
<PB N="49" REF="006094_0046_102784AC26377A50"/>evident, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> thought, they had every one of them an Election, and all were elected in his Sense, and as he used the Word, for it is absurd to exhort to make that sure, that we suppose, has no Existence, neither is, nor ever can be. Besides, I observed, that GOD only could make his Decree sure or firm, and therefore we must not think that the Apostle would exhort them to make it sure, which was the Work of GOD alone. To this Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> replies, <HI>But is it not possible to make it sure to ourselves?</HI> P. 32. To which I answered, <Q>By <HI>making it sure to our selves,</HI> you mean, to make it manifest, evident and clear to our selves; but the Word in the Original translated <HI>sure,</HI> has no such Meaning, but always signifies, firm, effectual and stedfast, and so cannot bear the Sense you put upon it, so it is used Heb. 2.2 <HI>If the Word spoken by Angels was sted∣fast.</HI></Q> —P. 44. Thus far we proceeded. And now I don't find that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has taken the least Notice of this, and many other Arguments which I thought, came very close to the Point in Dispute. Now if I am in an Error, I should have been exceeding thankful, if he would have set me right: But alas he has left me just as he found me, only a little more con∣firm'd in my old Notion, that according to the Language of the Holy Ghost all the Christians in the World are elected: They have all a Calling and an Election which by Diligence they may make sure of, or by Negligence may loose.</P>

<P><HI>I am sorry indeed that he has said nothing to several of your pretended Arguments. But now I remember he excuses himself, he was loath to be prolix.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>A poor Excuse indeed, but the best he could make. He was writing a Book of 143 Pages, and yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extremely fearful was he of tiring his Readers, that wherever the Argument pinches, he says nor a Word, but passes it by in profound Silence; and has served his Cause as cruelly as the Priest and Levite served the poor wounded and half-dead Traveller passing by without seeming to see him. This is not the only Point in which he has betray'd his Cause. I think he has abandon'd it under every Head. When the Argument comes to a Close, he seems to have entirely forgotten that there is any Dispute between us; but where there is no Need of his Help, he is liberal of his Words to Excess: And will afford us almost a Sermon upon a Subject wherein we are agreed.—I will give you another Instance I said in my Sermon, <Q>Though eternal Life is GOD's Gift, yet he bestows it after the Manner of a Reward.</Q> P. 31.—To
<PB N="50" REF="006094_0047_102784B20B50D5D8"/>this Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> replies—<HI>Then according to my Doctrine Heaven is a Reward of their (Men's) Hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which is the proper Meaning of the Word Wages, whether there be or be not a Proportion be∣tween the Value of the Work and the Reward.</HI> P. 20.—Hereup∣on I replied, <Q>By this you must mean, that if ever so vast a Bounty is tender'd by a Superior to an Inferior, upon ever so small a Consideration, or ever so easy and trilling a Condi∣tion, when that Condition is complied with, that Bounty then ceases to be Bounty, and is no longer <HI>Kindness, Mercy,</HI> or <HI>Alms,</HI> but becomes Wages to an <HI>Hireling</HI> and the Reward of Hire. Thus if you tell a Beggar only reach hither thine Hand and take it, and I will bestow upon thee a Thousand Pounds; if the poor Man does but make that Motion, and comply with that Condition, and reach forth his Hand, only that single Motion alters the Nature of the Thousand Pounds, so that it is no longer Bounty or a Gift; but is become Wages due to an Hireling for his Works, and is the Effect of his Merit▪ So that the Beggar may boast and say, I have merited this Thousand Pounds of you, it is the Reward of my <HI>Hire,</HI> I have earned it of you by my Works. It is not your Gift, I am no Ways beholden to you, and owe you no Thanks.</Q> — Thus the Appeal was made to common Sense, and that in one of the grand Articles in Contest.— And I now renew my Ap∣peal. If I give Food to an hungry Man, is it no Alms or Kindness, unless I open his Mouth and force it down; if I cloath the Naked, is it not Grace and Favour, unless I also put on their Cloaths, and force them to wear them. But alas, Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> did not seem to have known any more about it, than if he had been at that Time in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI>—If I take No∣tice of such a Conduct and expose it, as I must do, unless I will expose and betray the Truth, which I will not do for the best Friend on Earth, then you complain, that I treat him roughly; but how can I help it? It was not I that expos'd Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> to be ridicul'd, as he complain'd; but he expos'd himself by engaging in a bad Cause. And it is very hard that I must bear the Blame.</P>

<P>Yes, GOD by Christ's Resurrection has begotten us all to the Inheritance in Heaven, and by Baptism this Privilege is sealed to us, and we become <HI>Members of Christ</HI> and <HI>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> As <HI>Esau</HI> had a Birth-Right but lost the Blessing throught his Prophanity in selling it, so all Christi∣ans have a conditional Right to Heaven, which they may either secure or lose by their own Conduct. Whereas the Infidels, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> observes, were <HI>without GOD, without Christ, without a Covenant of Promise,</HI> and <HI>without Hope,</HI>— and when their Friends died they mourned for them without <HI>Hope.</HI></P>

<P>Yes, this is the Privilege of every Christian, that they are kept by the Power of GOD in the Sense in which St. <HI>Peter</HI> meant it. Not that GOD's Power is engaged to carry them to Heaven in Spite of all their own Opposition; or let them be ever so wicked, but GOD's Power is so engaged to bring them to Heaven, that neither Men nor Devils shall keep them out of it, if they don't wilfully leave the Way that leads to Heaven, and obstinately chuse the broad Road to Destruction.

<P>Yes, this all Christians profess to do, and he speaks of them according to their Profession. As it may be truly said of Mankind, they are rational Creatures, this Character is justly as∣cribed to Men in general, and yet sad Experience teaches, that a great many Men are very unreasonable.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, and many other Texts are a full Proof of what I pretend to in my Sermon. And they signify no more than this, that GOD had of his infinite Mercy from the Beginning de∣signed to call the Gentiles, into his Vineyard, the Church, and to invite them to the Gospel-Feast; that they mighty enjoy the gracious Offer of eternal Life; which eternal Life they should obtain, provided they heartily believed in Jesus Christ, when he
<PB N="53" REF="006094_0050_102784BA974C37D8"/>was preached to them, and gave themselves up to be guided and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.— There is not the least Inti∣mation in all these Texts of an absolute Election of particular Persons to Salvation.—Who can be so unreasonable, as to think that the Apostles would write Epistles to whole Churches, in which there were many Thousands whom they had never seen, and tell them plumply one and all, that they were elected in a personal and <HI>Calvinistie</HI> Sense; and that they knew this for Truth, as 1 Thess. i. 24. <HI>To the Church of the</HI> Thessalonians — <HI>knowing your Election of GOD.</HI> Let who will believe this to be the Design of the holy Pen-Men, I shall not believe it, till I can see more Reason for it than Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has offer'd Did ever a Calvinist write a Letter to all the Christians of a whole Country, nay many Countries together, and tell them they, and he knew for certain, they were all personally and ab∣solutely elected?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed I did not. If I had taken such a Liberty with him, as he has done with me, I should have had very little Reason to complain, if he had called me by an ill Name, which I don't desire to mention. But the worst I shall say is this, he has mistook the whole Affair. I as firmly believe all this as he did, <HI>viz.</HI> That Mankind are degenerate, and that we are naturally strongly inclined to Sin— And therefore I needed not that impertinent Multiplicity of Words, either to inform or convince me.</P>
<P>What I called a Fable, was the Account that he gave, of GOD's entering into Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> which as far as I could understand him was to this Purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> That it <HI>Adam</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="006094_0051_102A78CD405AD5E8"/>would forbear to eat of the forbidden Fruit for a Day, or a Week, or Month, or a Year, I could not learn from him how long exactly the Trial was to last, but he intimated, it was to be hat a very short Term, and then all Danger, all Trial and Pro∣bation for <HI>Adam,</HI> and his numerous Issue was to be over, and none of them was to be put to the Trouble of a personal Pro∣bation. This he suppos'd was unspeakably better than to be Probationers ourselves. And who would not rather chuse this Method, and leave all in the Hands of <HI>Adam,</HI> than be for ever upon Probation, in one's own Person? this I did then and do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill call a <HI>Fable,</HI> it has not only no Foundation in the Word of GOD, but is there plainly contradicted; as I have proved in another Place. Besides it is in many Respects a most absurd Scheme. To name but one. This Hypothesis makes <HI>Adam</HI>'s Righteousness infinitely more valuable and efficacious than that of Christ's the <HI>Lord from Heaven:</HI> For according to Mr. <HI>Dic∣kinson,</HI> if <HI>Adam</HI> had kept but one Precept, and that for a short Time, that Obedience would have been of such infinite Virtue, as to secure eternal Happiness to himself and to every single Child of his for ever. Whereas Christ's most holy Life and dreadful Death could save but a Part of Mankind: Neither could it save one of them, but upon Condition of their own Faith and sincere Repentance, whereas <HI>Adam</HI>'s Righteousness was of such Virtue as to save all, absolutely and unconditionally: Such Whims, I confess, I don't believe. And I wonder, how those Divines who pretend to make the Scripture the Rule of their Faith can give Heed to such Fables.</P>
<P>The Occasion to speak of Original Sin which Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> catched at in my Sermon was this, I said, that it is not a suffi∣cient Vindication that such Men make of GOD's Mercy towards the Souls of Men, to say as they do, that GOD leaves them without sufficient Help, under a Necessity of being wicked and miserable for ever, because <HI>Adam</HI> lost their Power to be∣lieve and repent—And this I am persuaded is most true and very consistent with the Church of <HI>England</HI> Doctrine of Ori∣ginal Sin. That GOD should command us to do, what we cannot do without his Grace and punish us eternally for not doing it, while he was not pleased to give us necessary Help; this, I say, is to charge our heavenly Father with Cruelty, and therefore GOD forbid that I should do it. They are mistaken, when they say we lost our Power in <HI>Adam,</HI> and that GOD may justly damn us for not repenting and not making
<PB N="55" REF="006094_0052_102784BC27A6B220"/>ourselves a new Heart, tho' he does not now give us Power to repent, because he once have us that Power, and <HI>Adam</HI> lost it for us. For as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> observes, <Q><HI>Adam,</HI> when he was first created had no such Ability that in case he should fall he could rise again by Frith and Repentance.—Therefore, we never lost any such Power in him. But supposing we lost the Gift of Faith and Repentance in <HI>Adam,</HI> which is certainly false, yet you must remember, the Gospel is a gracious Tender of Pardon to sallen Creatures: Now to pro∣mise Pardon to a lapsed Person upon a Condition, is in Effect for GOD to say, he will not impute to him his former Fault, but will deal with him according to his future Car∣riage, to which a conditional Promise always has a Re∣lation; but if he still requires what he knows the first Fault hath render'd utterly impossible to be done by him he still imputes that Fault, and punishes him at the same Time for it as he pretendeth to remit it; and surely it is no small Matter to render GOD so delusory and deceitful, so insincere and hypocritical, as this Opinion makes him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Should a Physician come to a Patient whose Stomach was so weaken'd through his Intemperance and Lust, that it could bear no strong Meat, and his Feet so enfeebled that he could scarce walk from his Couch to his Bed side, and profess an earnest Desire to cure his Distemper, and promise him Re∣covery, provided he would follow his Prescriptions, might it not reasonably be expected he should prescribe such Means for his Recovery, that it was possible for him in this Condition to make Use of? If then he should enjoin him to eat and to digest the strongest Meats, and walk some Hours in the Fields, because he formerly could do so, before he fell into this Dis∣ability and Feebleness; would not all Men pronounce him a deluding Cheat, and one that hypocritically and insincerely pretended his Recovery, and promised it with equal Vanity and Folly, intending only to insult over his present Misery; And yet this is the Representation of our gracious GOD, in this Affair which these Men offer to us. For the blessed Jesus is the Physician which GOD sent to heal our Natures of the Disability which we had contracted by the Fall, and to pro∣mise us a Remedy, which if we would use, we should reco∣ver, that or a better Life than that from which we fell, and to threaten the severest Judgments if we neglect so to do.
<PB N="56" REF="006094_0053_102784C38C942B48"/>But then, if he only doth promise this Recovery on such a Condition as that very Fall hath render'd us unable to per∣form, and which he never will enable us to perform, must he not be guilty of the like Hypocrisy and Insincerity in pro∣pounding to us an impossible Remedy, and insult only over the Misery of his Creatures whilst he pretends Kindness to them? And how unreasonable is it to impute such Deceit, Falshood, Insincerity and Injustice to a good and righteous GOD, which we cannot but abhor in Man? For sure, most graciously to exhort, most affectionately to invite, most ear∣nestly by the greatest Promises and Threats to move us to repent and believe, when at the same Time he is most firmly purposed to withhold the Means, by which alone we can do either, is to insult over his miserable Crea∣tures in the highest Manner: And to deal thus with Myriads for the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> is, as it were, to medi∣tate Revenge upon the greatest Part of his Posterity to the World's End for what was only done by the first Man: yet, it is to do this under Pretence of Love and kind Affec∣tion and a vehement Desire and Concern that they should escape the Misery that very Sin had brought upon them, and recover the Felicity they had lost by it, by those very Means he doth prescribe; And yet to leave them under an utter Incapacity to perform those Means: Which to con∣ceive and assert of our most gracious GOD, is highly to dis∣honour and blaspheme his sacred Majesty, and represent him so unto the World, as even the worst of Men would not endure to be so represented.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we are entered upon that Inquiry, whether GOD does afford the internal Assistance of his Spirit in such a Measure to all under the Gospel as to put them under a Pos∣sibility of obtaining Salvation? this I affirm, and he denies.</P>

<P>Now the Christians at <HI>Corinth</HI> had a foolish Contention
<PB N="57" REF="006094_0054_102784CA4FA34008"/>about several Teachers who had been among them, they grew hot and ran into Parties and Factions, some preferring one Teacher and some another; to convince them of the Unreason∣ableness of this Practice, the Apostle says to them, <HI>who maketh thee to differ from another?</HI> That is, it GOD only, who in his Providence gives one Man a better Teacher than another; and therefore none of you have any Reason to be puffed up against, or despise another, altho' you have a better Teacher than he hath. The Apostle don't say, that GOD alone makes one Teacher to differ from another; for different Improve∣ments will make some Difference among Teachers, but he says, <HI>Who maketh thee</HI> (i. e. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Boaster) <HI>to differ from another,</HI> in that you have (as you think) a more excellent Teacher? Now though GOD did make one Teacher to differ from ano∣ther by miraculous Gifts (in those Days common) in receiving of which they were meerly passive; yet this is nothing at all to the Case in Hand. And it is a monstrous Error to say, that GOD alone makes all the Difference among Mankind; and, that no Part is owing to Men's different Conduct and Improve∣ments. When of two Men the one is temperate, and the other a Drunkard, the one a righteous Dealer, and the other a Thief or Pirate, it is not GOD who makes all the Difference, for then the Vicious would be as worthy of Praise and Reward as the Virtuous. GOD, its true, makes a Difference among Mankind, by giving different Talents, but then Experience shews, that Men having equal Talents, may differ from each other by their different Improvements of the same Talents.</P>

<P>Christ's Disciples who believed him to be a Teacher sent from GOD, and so were fitted to receive the plainest Instructi∣ons, ask'd him why he taught the People in such a dark Manner by Parables?

<P><HI>I shall now read a third Text. Mat.</HI> xi. 25, 26. At that Time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these Things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight. <HI>Now what say you to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this Text Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> attempts to prove almost every Thing Reprobation; no real Redemption for the Reprobates, and no sufficient Grace for them; because GOD hated them so as to hide Salvation from them, and Christ rejoiced and was thank∣ful for it.</P>
<P>I shall therefore be very particular in my enquiring into the Meaning of it. St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives this Account of that same Pas∣sage, Luke x. 21. <HI>In that Hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit, and said, I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these Things from the wise and prudent, and hast reveal'd them unto Babes.</HI></P>
<P>Now that the blessed Jesus, that mighty Lover of Mankind, who came down from Heaven to save Souls, who left the high∣est Glory for the Depth of Misery, and forsook the Bosom of his Father to hang upon a Cross, to deliver us from Hell and bring, us to his Joys: That he should be so mightily pleased and rejoice in Spirit, when he saw that Multitudes of excellent wise and prudent Persons were so blinded and hardned as to reject the Gospel, their sole Remedy and the only Way to Salvation: That he who did so much to save Men, should with transporting Joy give Thanks to his Father, because he had so ordered the Matter that the wiser and more prudent Part of Mankind were certainly to be lost and damned for ever; and that the Father who had sworn by his own Life, that he delighted not in the
<PB N="59" REF="006094_0056_102784CF8D8F9A78"/>Sinners Death, and sent his Son into the World not to con∣demn but save it, yet that he should so contrive the Scheme of Salvation, as to hide those M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>teries of it which were necessary to be believed, from the Wise and Prudent, the Effect of which Hiding must unavoidably by their eternal Damnation; this is surprizing! this is amazing! In this Sense Mr. <HI>Dic∣kinson</HI> plainly understands it, or else when he so often cites it, he does it impertinently. Here then let us enquire, 1. Who are the Wise and Prudent, and who are the Babes? 2. What is meant by GOD's hiding the Mysteries of Christian∣ity from the Wise and Prudent? 3. What was the true Occa∣sion of Christ's rejoicing and giving Thanks? To begin with the <HI>First,</HI> by the Wise and Prudent are meant the Doctors of the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Rulers of the Nation: These were the most obstinate Enemies to Christ, and deaf to all the Rea∣sons that could be offer'd in Defence of his divine Mission. Hence they said, <HI>Have any of the Rulers or Pharisees believed on him?</HI> John vii. 46. Now these Men are called wise and pru∣dent, not because they were really so, but because they vainly esteemed themselves wise and prudent; and were generally so accounted. But had they been wise and prudent indeed, they would have honestly enquired into Christ's Pretensions, and have di∣ligently examin'd the Testimonials he bro't with him from Hea∣ven, and so would have been convinc'd of his being the Christ.— And by Babes are meant the ignorant and unlearn'd common People, sometimes stiled the Poor, who had the Gospel preach'd to them. Now the common People among the <HI>Jews</HI> were like Babes or Children, in that they were more free from Pre∣judices, more humble and teachable, than their wise Men; and so were better prepared to be wrought upon by Christ's Preach∣ing, and better disposed to receive the Gospel.</P>
<P>The common People here called Babes, were in Christ's Time so well dispos'd towards Christianity, that had their Teach∣ers and Rulers let them alone, and not violently oppos'd it, they would have readily believed in Christ, so mightily were they affected with his astonishing Works and heavenly Doctrine. But the proud and obstinate Wretches conceiting themselves wise and prudent, would neither go into Christ's Kingdom them∣selves, nor by their Good-Will suffer the common People to go in. And it was easier to reveal the Gospel to <HI>Babes,</HI> i. e. the humble ignorant <HI>Vulgar,</HI> than to convince them of its Truth. And now for the Second Enquiry, that is, in what Sense did
<PB N="60" REF="006094_0057_102784D12EBC2838"/>GOD hide the Gospel from these Men? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certainly GOD did nothing with a Design, or on Purpose to hide the Gospel from them, for this would be directly contrary to the Nature of GOD and the Declaration of his Word, GOD is good and merciful and dispos'd to do all that is fit to make his Creatures happy, but to do Things on Purpose to blind and harden Men in Sin to their eternal Ruin, is as contrary to Goodness and Mercy as Darkness is to Light, and the Scripture assures us that GOD would have all Men to repent and come to the Know∣ledge of the Truth: Not indeed that GOD wills this with an irresistible Will by which he made the World, but he so wills the Salvation of all Men as to do all that is necessary on his Part, even for the bringing of every <HI>Jew, Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> to the Knowledge of his Truth, and that all the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Soldonia</HI> have not the Knowledge of the Way to Salva∣tion, of whom Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> speaks, is not from any Deficiency in GOD's Good-Will towards them, but from Men's neglect∣ing their Part in publishing and supporting GOD's revealed Truth. But for GOD to do any Thing on Purpose to hide his Truth from Men, and lead them into damning Mistakes, this is far, very far from being agreeable to what St. <HI>Peter</HI> says, 2 Pet. iii. 9. <HI>The Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance.</HI> Thus then <HI>Secondly,</HI> Though GOD does nothing which can lay Men under a Necessity not to see the Things of their eternal Peace, yet it is certain, that no Men will see them, but only such as love the Truth; or though GOD does nothing to <HI>hide</HI> the Gospel from Men, yet no Men will see so much of its Excellency as to embrace it sincerely, un∣less they are willing to know and do the Will of GOD. Our blessed Saviour was wont often to say, <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear,</HI> which denotes that though all Men have na∣tural Capacities sufficient to receive all necessary Truth, yet there were many who were so full of Prejudices and Self Will, that they had no Ears to hear, that is, they had no Inclination towards the Truth: They hated it because it cross'd their Hu∣mours and former Notions, so that their Want of Ears to hear and Eyes to see, was not because GOD never gave these to them, but because they would not use them: But when they had Ears they were like the deaf Adder who stoppeth her Ear: so they stop their Ears and will not hear the Voice of the Rea∣soner, let him reason ever so wisely, their Deafness and Blind∣ness is the Effect of their own Perverseness, just thus it was with
<PB N="61" REF="006094_0058_102784D61CD122E0"/>those Zealots who stoned St. <HI>Stephe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> they <HI>stopped their Ears and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon him,</HI> resolving they would not hear what he had to say, least it should corrupt them, or in other Words, convince them of their Error. Now this was the Case of these wise and pru∣dent Men in this Text. The Gospel was <HI>hid</HI> from them! How? not because it was above their Capacities to understand it, not because GOD inflicted any positive Blindness or Hardness upon them, so that it was not in their Power to see the Truth; but because they would not see, they were resolved not to be convinced, they shut their own Eyes as close as possible against the Truth, and hardened their own Hearts like an Adamant, left hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Doctrines and Miracles should make an Impression upon them, and the special Reason of this their Obstinacy was, their groundless Expectation of a temporal King and Deliverer in the Messiah; which they perceived must fail, if they acknowledged Jesus to be the Person.</P>

<P><HI>But why is GOD said to</HI> hide <HI>the Gospel from these Men if they al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were the Causes of their own B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>iness and Unbelief?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer, according to the Language of the holy Bible, oftentimes GOD is said, to do such Things, which he neither decreed, nor willed, nor in any Degree effected by his Power; but only suffered it, to come to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, when he could by his infi∣nite Power have hindered it. Nothing can come to pass unless GOD see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to permit it, not one Sparrow fails, nor an Hair of our Head falls to the Ground, without the Notice of our heavenly Father, no Event can befall us though ever so casual, or ever so much Chance-medly, but what GOD foresees and permits; seeing therefore GOD superintends all Events either ordering, or permitting and over-ruling them for Good, there∣fore in a figurative Way such Things are often ascrib'd to GOD which he neither willed nor effected, but only suffered to be done when he could by his infinite Power have hinder'd them: As Prov. xvi. 4. <HI>The Lord hath made all Things for himself;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or <HI>to answer one another,</HI> as it might be rendered more agreeable to the Hebrew.</NOTE> <HI>yea even the wicked for the Day of Evil.</HI> Which certainly does not mean, that GOD makes Men wicked: But they make themselves wicked, and the Lord so orders all Events, as that they shall most certainly come into the <HI>Day of Evil,</HI> that is, the Day of Punishment.</P>
<P>Again, It is said 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv. 1. The Lord moved <HI>David</HI> to number the People. Now it is evident from other Texts, that
<PB N="62" REF="006094_0059_102784D79E9E3DD8"/>all which GOD did, was to permit <HI>Satan</HI> and his own Vanity to move him to do it. So when it is said in this Text, that GOD <HI>hid</HI> the Gospel from these Men it don't mean, that GOD had not given them Grace sufficient to enable them to see the Things of their eternal Peace, or that he had lest them under an absolute Incapacity to be convinced of the Truth of the Gospel and to believe in Christ; for then they would not have been at all to blame for not seeing, and not believing: for who can blame a blind Man because he don't see, or a deaf Man because he can't hear, when GOD has not given them Power to do it? And yet Christ often reproved and upbraided these Men for their Unbelief and Hardness of Heart; which he would never have done if he had supposed, as Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> did, that GOD never had given them Sufficiency of his Grace to enable them to see and believe; or that GOD had never put it in their Power to receive him.</P>
<P N="3">3. We come now to the last Enquiry. What was the Occa∣sion of Christ's Rejoicing and giving Thanks; was it because the Gospel was hid from the Wise and Prudent, or was it be∣cause it was <HI>reveal'd to Babes?</HI> Or did he rejoice in and give Thanks for both? I answer; No, it was not for both: It was only because the Gospel was revealed to Babes, that Christ rejoiced and gave Thanks. Men's Blindness, Unbelief and Damnation are no Occasion of Joy to any but the cursed Fiends of Hell, and those who are like them: And it is horrid Blas∣phemy to suppose that our Saviour was guilty of so much Ill-Nature, as to give Thanks, and rejoice when he observed that Men were going blindly to Hell; and the Gospel's being HID from some, is here put in Opposition to its being REVEALED to others, only that the former may illustrate the latter, as black set opposite to white, makes the latter appear the whiter; this is a common Thing in the Scripture. But I'll only repeat that Parallel Text I gave to Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> before, but he was too wise and prudent, to learn from me, Rom. vi. 17. St. <HI>Paul</HI> says thus, <HI>GOD be thanked, that ye were the Servants of Sin, but ye have obeyed from the Heart that Form of Doctrine,</HI> &amp;c.— Now you may as well argue from this, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was thankful that these Men had spent all the former Part of their Life in the Ser∣vitude of Sin, as Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> does from this Text that Christ was not willing to die effectually on his Part for <HI>some,</HI> nor had GOD elected these <HI>(Some)</HI> nor was he willing to give sufficient Grace to these <HI>(Some)</HI> because Christ thanked his heavenly Fa∣ther
<PB N="63" REF="006094_0060_102784DCB00D4500"/>for HIDING the Benefits of his Redemption from <HI>Some,</HI> when in Truth Christ never did thank GOD for any such <HI>Thing,</HI> but it was his unhappy Mistake which he too long persisted in.

<P>Though Conversion is called a Creation; and good Men are GOD's Workmanship, yet this Metaphor does not imply that they are meerly passive in Conversion; for though it be true in a proper Creation, that GOD does all, and the Creature can neither hinder or promote its own Creation; yet Mr. <HI>Dic∣kinson</HI> himself owns, that we can hinder or promote our own Conversion: The Metaphor must not be forced to this Sense, which is plainly false. You allow that a good Man when fal∣len into a particular Sin, does something towards his rising a∣gain; and his Repentance is not the Work of GOD alone.

<P>This is very true, but Nothing to his Purpose, because GOD from Heaven gives it to Millions of Men to repent and believe, who never do actually repent and believe, but die in their Sins; because they will not accept and, improve what GOD given them, but receive his Grace in vain. — Doth not Christ tell the <HI>Jews,</HI> Joh. vi. 32, 33. <HI>My Father giveth you the true Bread from Heaven;</HI> yet many of them never had it, ne∣ver eat it, never believed in Christ, so never were the better for GOD's Gift. So GOD gives us our daily Bread, but many must starve, if they don't labour for their Bread. The Scripture is most express. GOD purges Thousands who are never purg∣ed, because they will not be purged; GOD draws Myriads, who never come, because they resist his Drawings. The Good∣ness of GOD leads some Men to Repentance, who yet are ne∣ver lead, but continue to treasure up Wrath.—I grant that some Times such Phrases GOD's giving a Heart to perceive, to re∣pent or to believe, do denote the desired Effect, and that the Person does actually perceive or repent, but this is not always their Meaning, that must be judged of by the Context.</P>

<P>This, as well as several other Texts I have now consider'd he has likewise improved against Dr. <HI>Johnson;</HI> now, that you may see that all the Arguments your Party can advance were answered long ago, I will reply in the Words of <HI>Clagget</HI> against <HI>Owen.</HI> <Q>Now, says he, that these Words do not imply that GOD is the sole Agent in Conversion, is plain from hence, that we are exhorted in the Verse immediately preceeding <HI>to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</HI> and it is brought as a Reason why we ought to do this, because it is <HI>GOD that works in us both to will and to do.</HI> Now it would be very strange, that GOD should use that for a Reason to us why we should work out our own Salvation, which is on the other Hand a clear Reason why we <HI>need not.</HI> And yet this is the very Case if GOD's working in us be suppos'd to imply that he is the sole Cause of Conversion. For if GOD be the <HI>sole</HI> Cause of Conversion, if he does all, then there is nothing left for us to do; and then to what Purpose is it that we should work? If GOD worketh not, our working will not profit us, and if he doth work, our Negligence, nay our utmost Resistance, cannot hurt us; for this Work of GOD is suppos'd to be irresistable, and consequently uncapable of being frustrated by the stoutest Opposition we are able to make against it. This Consideration therefore that <HI>GOD worketh in us,</HI> can (upon this Supposition) be no Argument why a Man should himself work; but a plain Argument to the contrary; and therefore the Apostle would never have used it, much less would he have added with Fear and Trem∣bling; for there can be no Cause of Fear and Trembling if we cannot miscarry through our own Negligence, which if GOD be the sole Cause of Conversion, we certainly cannot. But it will be enough to expose this Notion, nakedly to set down the Apostle's Discourse, as it must run according to this Interpretation. Thus then he argues; I assure you all to whom I write, that GOD work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in you all Things that appertain to your Obedience and Salvation, and that by an irresistable Operation, so as that it shall not be possible for you not to will, or to do whatever is necessary to Salvation: Therefore I seriously exhort you to be very careful and that with Fear and Trembling, that you both will and do such Things left you miscarry through your own Negligence and Disobedience. Than which nothing can be more absur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> It is plain then that by GOD's working in us, no more can
<PB N="66" REF="006094_0063_102784E520E77A28"/>be meant, than that he worketh in us what is on his Part pro∣per and fitting to be wrought in Order to our willing and doing, which is not so much but that our own Care and Di∣ligence is necessary.</Q></P>

<P><HI>The next Text is</HI> Rom. viii. 7.8. <HI>The carnal Mind is En∣mity against GOD: for it is not subject to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Flesh cannot please GOD.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be in the Flesh, is to be under the Dominion of Vice, to be a Slave to Sin, and it don't import, that they who are in the Flesh cannot come out of that wretched State, that they who are wicked can't become good Men by the Grace GOD ten∣ders to them. It only signifies that so far as they act from a vi∣cious or fleshly Mind, so far their Actions are displeasing to GOD; as when it is said of a good Man, that he sinneth not neither indeed can he sin; it only means so far as he is good, and acts up to his Character, he cannot sin. Not but that a Man who is a Child of GOD can and does sin, but then he acts not as a Child of GOD, but inconsistently with his Character. So when it is said, he that is in the Flesh cannot please GOD, it means, that whatever he does by Virtue of this fleshly or vi∣cious Mind is offensive to GOD, but at the same Time he might act contrary to the Flesh, and mortify it by divine Help, and so far as he does so, he pleases GOD, and as soon as ever he has got the Mastery over the Flesh, he is a good Man and in the Spirit; but yet is still liable to be too much influenced by the Flesh, and so far as he is so, he offends GOD, although he be a good Man. So that such Expressions in the Scripture are im∣pertinently cited to prove that a Sinner can do nothing towards his own Conversion; or that his Conversion don't at all depend upon his concurring with Grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, but he tells you, that an unconverted State is called Death in holy Scripture. Now what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a dead Man do?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is called a Sleep even in the same Sentence. Eph. v. 14. <HI>Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the Dead.</HI> So that if you can prove from one Metaphor, that an Almighty Power is necessary to effect the Conversion of a Sinner; I can prove by the other Metaphor in the same Verse, that an Almighty Power is not necessary, for it don't require an irrefutable Act to awake a Man that is asleep. Besides if wicked Men's being said to be dead in Trespasses and Sins, must be so understood, as to denote that they can't do any Thing towards their Conversion,
<PB N="67" REF="006094_0064_102784E6C433F168"/>then when good Men are said to be <HI>deed to the Law, dead to Sin,</HI> it must mean, that it is as impossible for them to sin, as for a dead Man to act.</P>

<P><HI>Well, what think you of that?</HI> 1 Pet. i. 5. <HI>Who are kept by the Power of GOD through Faith unto Salvation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This only proves that all who persevere so as to obtain Salvation, are kept, by the Power of GOD. And they are kept through Faith, i. e. GOD's Power is engaged to carry them through all Dangers, on Condition they continue in the Faith, and don't apostatize.</P>

<P>John vi. 37. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me, and him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Text asserts no more than this, that Christ will never cast off any that come to him, but will give them eternal Life: but then this Condition is plainly implied, <HI>viz.</HI> provided they continue with him, and don't wilfully forsake him. He does not engage to keep any against their own Wills. — And by those which the <HI>Father hath given him,</HI> he here means such as have complied with and so have been effectually wrought upon by the antecedent Grace of GOD.</P>

<P><HI>Well, tell me what you think of that?</HI> Joh. x. 27, 28. <HI>My Sheep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give unto them eternal Life, and they shall never perish, neither shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pluck them out of my Hand.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christ hereby meant to promise no more than this, that they who were of a teachable Temper and Lovers of Truth, and so became his Sheep, and believed in him, and obeyed him till Death: he would certainly give them eternal Life; and all their Enemies in Earth and Hell should not be able to deprive them of it. For his Power which was his Father's, was superior to all other Powers: it is evident, that Christ here speaks of plucking them away by Violence: not a Word here of their not being able wilfully to desert him. It is one of the most unreasonable Notions that ever entered into the Heart of
<PB N="68" REF="006094_0065_102784EC048A8578"/>Man, to suppose that Salvation is promised to one single Act of Faith without Regard to a Man's subsequent Behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, I believe you will not so easily get clear of the last Text,</HI> Rom. xi. 29. <HI>The Gifts and Calling of GOD are without Repentance.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is certainly spoken of the Body of the Jewish Nation, which at that very Time were given up by GOD to Blindness of Mind and Hardness of Heart; in which they have continued from that Day to this, and it only denotes that GOD has not so cast them off but that he will receive them again, upon their believing and repenting. And it will not hold al∣ways true, that GOD does not repent of, or revoke his Gifts bestowed upon Men: how often does he give and take away. And to say this holds true of coverting Grace, is only to beg the Thing in Question.</P>
<P>And now will you tell me in a few Words, the Substance of what Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> has said in Answer to what I urged from. GOD's saying to the Jews, <HI>Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, and what could have been done more to my Vine∣yard that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth Grapes, brought it forth wild Grapes?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I think the Substance of what he has said to it is this: that GOD did not complain because they did not use special Grace, for that he never gave them, but because they did not well improve common Grace.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perswaded this was his Meaning; and can you be∣lieve it is true, that GOD did not expect, that they should love him with all their Heart and serve him with all their Souls? Did GOD expect any Thing less from his peculiar People, than that they should be a holy People as he was a holy GOD. These were the <HI>Grapes</HI> which he expected; and for Want of these he complains, and to produce these, he declares he had done all that was necessary on his Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But he asks, How does it appear, that they had all of them received Grace sufficient for their eternal Salvation?</HI> P. 77.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't say, they had received Grace; but they might have received sufficient for their eternal Salvation, had they not rejected it. For GOD himself says it; <HI>I have purged thee: And what could have been done more?</HI> Which do as strongly as∣sert as Words can do, that GOD had done every Thing neces∣sary on his Part to cause them to bring forth Grapes, and to purge them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om, not merely <HI>gross Immoralities,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="006094_0066_102784F5C79354C0"/>but from all their Iniquities, and make them pure and holy. But all GOD's Grace was lost upon them, as Rain falling upon the Rocks and Sands, through their Perverseness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But what have you to object to their Explanation of special Grace? When they say to Dr.</HI> Johnson, <HI>"the whole is greater than a Part, Three and Two make Five, Five is a lesser Number than Five Hundred, now are you not necessitated to assent to these Truths? Just thus—When the Spirit of Grace illuminates the Sin∣ner's Understanding, it necessitates his free Consent to the Gospel Call.</HI> P. 108. <HI>It is a Contradiction and impossible in the Nature of Things, that a good Man should be willing to be wicked."</HI> P. 134.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That this is false, I dare appeal to your own Conscience. Have you as full a Belief of the Gospel, as you have that two and three make five? Have you no more Doubts about any Truths of Christianity, than you have whether Five be a lesser Number than Five Hundred? If so, then your Faith has no Virtue in it, is worthy of no Praise or Reward, and is no Effect of the Will. For what Choice of the Will is there in believing that Two and Three make Five? If this be true, then your Faith is perfect the very first Moment, and can never grow, and you have no Need to pray, <HI>Lord increase our Faith, I believe, Lord help my Unbelief.</HI> I acknowledge Christ could make himself so manifest to every one, as that we should be no more able to doubt, or refuse his Offer than to doubt of our own Existence. But this would be inconsistent with a State of Probation, or living by Faith. This would not be Faith, but Sight, and peculiar to the Saints and Angels in Heaven. See a Specimen of the Arrogance and Pride that is cherished by these Doctrines! With what Scorn do they look down upon us poor Wretches, who have nothing but <HI>common Grace!</HI> I confess if this be their special Grace, I have it not; nor do I ever expect it in this State of Probation. Nor have I ever seen any Signs of it among them, notwithstand∣ing all their Boasting (like the Quakers of their Light within) on Purpose to inveigle weak People. I esteem this nothing but playing the <HI>Mountebank</HI> with Religion. I have known several, who have boasted that they had this <HI>special Grace;</HI> and were mounted aloft above Doubts or Fears, but I have found many of them with all their special Grace, to be destitute of common Honesty.</P>
<P>And now will you help me to understand what he has said
<PB N="70" REF="006094_0067_102784F749861470"/>in Reply to my Reasoning from Ezek. xxxiii. 11. <HI>As I live saith the Lord GOD, I have no Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked, &amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I think the Sum of what he has said is this, that GOD does not really will that all Sinners in general should be converted, his Oath means no more, than that when any Sinner is converted it is acceptable to GOD. For if he did really will the Conversion of all Sinners, he would certainly convert all, for nothing can hinder GOD from accomplishing his Will.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed his Argument: But it is a very great Mistake, to think that GOD always by his infinite Power does accomplish every Thing that he would have his Creatures do. If this be true, then GOD is not willing that any Men should o∣bey him, who do not actually obey him, then he is not willing that any should repent, who don't repent, he is not willing that one Soul should be good and obtain Salvation, who don't actually obtain it. And then what Sincerity is there in all GOD's earnest and passion∣ate Wishes? Ps. lxxxi. 12. <HI>O that my People had hearken'd unto me! O that they were wise that they would consider their latter End. How often would I have gathered—but ye would not!</HI> Who dare charge the GOD of Truth, with Hypocrisy and Dissimulation, and say that he did not will or desire this? Which yet he ne∣ver did accomplish by his infinite Power. If this Notion of Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s be just then, no wicked Man in the World does, or can do any Thing contrary to GOD's Will, for if it were contrary to his Will GOD would hinder him by his exceeding great Power. And can this Notion be true, when it contains such monsuous Absurdities? So I shall leave it to be determin'd by common Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You may remember, that Dr.</HI> Johnson <HI>had suggested, that it is not impossible but that some Men who never were so happy, as to hear the Name of Christ, "yet may be saved by his Merits. — To this they reply, "What so great Cause of Thankfulness for the "Gospel, if Men may be saved without the Gospel?</HI> P. 143.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this you may see the Envy and Unthankfulness, the stingy narrow uncharitable Spirit of Calvinism; they can't bear to think, that GOD should be so merciful to all Men, as to make it possible for them to be saved. No, they will not thank him for the Gospel, if he has not confined Salvation to them; of the same cruel and envious Temper were the Jews in the Apostles Time, and cav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled against the Calling of the Gentiles, just as these Men; Rom. iii. 1. <HI>What Advantage then hath
<PB N="71" REF="006094_0068_102784F8CB2086A8"/>the Jew?</HI> To which the <HI>Apostle replies, much every Way.</HI> The same Answer I return to these Men. Had not such Men as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> Reason to thank GOD for his great Intellectual Powers, because that one who has scarce common Sense may be saved as well as he? When a Man has received five Talents, has he no Reason for Thankfulness; because the Man who has received but one, may possibly so improve it, as to be accepted? And whereas there are many Mansions in Heaven, is it no Cause of Thankfulness that you are put into a Capacity to arrive at the highest of them, unless you can be sure that all others shall be shat out from the lowest? It is so melancholy to think, that all who never heard of Christ shall be eternally damned, that I can't but suspect that Man's want of good Nature, who is fond of proving it.</P>
<P><HI>Of</HI> JUSTIFICATION.</P>
<P>We are now come to the last Head under which Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> seems to be a little more calm and condescending. He tells me if I meant no more by some Expressions in my Sermon, than I seem to do in my Defence it is <HI>well,</HI> and he is <HI>willing to accept mine own Explanation,</HI> and I am vastly obliged to him for that. And if he had but been willing at first to have <HI>accepted</HI> of what was every whit as well explained and as well meant, it would have saved himself, and me a great Deal of Trouble. However a little is better than none. — Pray, tell me now what are the chief Articles of his Belief in the Point of Justification?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He says,</HI> <Q>If <HI>his (Christ's) Righteousness alone will justify as in the Sight of GOD and make us fit to appear before GOD — then our Temper of Mind and Life agreeable to the Gospel cannot be this Wedding-Garment that will make us fit to appear before GOD.</HI></Q> P. 85.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one Error in his Divinity; Christ's Righteousness <HI>alone</HI> will not justify us in the Sight of GOD, nor make us fit to appear before GOD. For if that <HI>alone</HI> were sufficient, we should need no personal Righteousness of our own; no Repen∣tance, no Faith, no Love of GOD, no Charity towards Men. But we must have a Righteousness inherent in our own Persons, or else we shall never see GOD, Heb. xii. 14. <HI>Follow Peace with all Men; and Holiness, without which no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> Matth. v. 8. <HI>Blessed are the pure in Heart; for they shall see GOD.</HI> If Christ had come down from Heaven a Thousand
<PB N="72" REF="006094_0069_102784FA758A0E00"/>Times, and lived the same most righteous Life, and died a thousand Deaths for us; yet would this never have reconciled GOD to us, and caused him to delight in us, or to admit us to his Presence, unless we had a Righteousness in our own Persons, or a Temper of Mind agreeable to the Gospel; Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> mistook the Tenor of the Gospel, and the Design of Christ's Righteousness. — I freely acknowledge Christ's Righteousness is most perfect and abundantly answers its Design; but it never was intended to excuse our Want of a Righteousness in our own Persons. Hear Christ himself Matth, v. 20. <HI>Except your Righteousness shall exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no Case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Let no Man deceive you, he that doth Righteousness, is righteous.</HI> The Gospel is Christ's Law by which we shall be judged, and finally justified or condemned, Christ never did fulfil his own Law for us; he never repented or crucified the Flesh with its Lusts for us, but enjoined it upon us to do it by his Holy Spirit, and according as we have, or have not obeyed the Gospel, in the last Day, so shall we be justified or condemned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, but hear him explain himself.</HI> <Q><HI>Though sincere Obe∣dience (says he) be a necessary Qualification for Heaven— Yet it is no antecedent Condition of the Pardon of Sin, and has no Hand at all in our Justification before GOD.</HI></Q> P. 85.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is another Mistake; a sincere Repentance of all our Sins, a giving up our selves to Christ with a full Resolution to obey him till Death, is certainly the antecedent Condition of the Pardon of our Sins; and no Man's Sins are pardoned before he performs this good Work: And a persevering in Well do∣ing till Death, is the antecedent Condition of our full and final Justification in the Day of Judgment; which is the only perfect Justification before GOD. This is the Tenor of the Gospel, <HI>Repent and your Sins shall be blotted out— Be thou faithful unto the Death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But hear his Reasons.</HI> <Q><HI>There can be no such Thing as a Course of sincere Gospel-Obedience, before we are justified, and consequently our Gospel-Obedience cannot be the Condition of our Justification.</HI></Q> P. 86.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is another Error. For though a Man is in a State of Acceptance with GOD immediately upon his sincere closing with Christ, and giving up himself to be ruled and saved by him, even before ever he has had an Opportunity to perform one external good Work, yet this closing with Christ is Gospel Obe∣dience
<PB N="73" REF="006094_0070_102784FD83326F88"/>begun, is a good Work of our own, and is a Condition of our <HI>initial</HI> Justification. And our being obedient till Death is the Condition of our full, perfect, and final Justification in the Day of Judgment, Mark xvi. 16. <HI>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.</HI> That Faith by which we are first justified, is not a meer Assent of the Understanding, but contains in it a sincere Resolution to obey Christ till Death; and as this Faith is a good Work of our own, and goes before every Sort of Justification, so it vertually contains in it all good Works: Which must preceed our final Justification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But hear him further, <Q>Again, says he, we must either have a perfect Justification—or no Justification at all.</Q></HI> P. 87.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure the Scripture doth not reckon after this Manner, Justification in this Life consists in the Pardon of our Sins, and the Approbation of GOD, neither of which are perfect here. Good and justified Men do often offend GOD, and need a new Pardon, otherwise they need not repent, or pray for Pardon. Upon <HI>David</HI>'s Repentance of his Murder and Adultery, GOD pardoned his Sin so far as to remit the heavier Part of the Pun∣ishment, <HI>viz.</HI> temporal and eternal Death; but yet he did not perfectly pardon him and exempt him from Punishment, for that Sin the Child must die, and the Sword must never depart from his House, and a Series of dreadful Punishments must follow him to the Day of his Death. 2 Sam. xii. 14. <HI>The Lord hath put away thy Sin,</HI> here is his Pardon and Justification, <HI>Howbeit the Child shall surely die</HI>—Indeed we shall not be per∣fectly justified, until the general Judgment; when Soul and Body which have as a Punishment for Sin been separated, shall be reunited, and the eternal Judge having compared our Lives with the Law of Faith and Covenant of Grace, shall pronounce the final Sentence, <HI>Come ye blessed.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q><HI>Furthermore, says he, if we are made righteous by the O∣bedience of Christ, and justified by the Blood of Christ, we then cannot be justified either in whole, or in Part, or in any Respect by our own Works of Obedience.</HI></Q> P. 88.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is a full Discovery that his Hypothesis and Notion of Justification was entirely wrong. For, says he, we are not justified neither in whole, nor in Part, nor in any Respect by our own Works of Obedience, i. e. Nothing that we do justi∣fies us in any Degree, or in any Respect; Whereby he has Point blank contradicted our blessed Saviour, who says Matth. xii. 37. <HI>By the Words shalt thou be justified,</HI> and the governing of our
<PB N="74" REF="006094_0071_10278500DF2B9D40"/>Tongues is a Part of our Gospel-Obedience. So has he in ex∣press Terms contradicted St. <HI>James.</HI> Jam. ii. 24. <HI>You see then how that by Works a Man is justified, and not by Faith only.</HI> So Luk. xviii. 14. Christ says of the Publican after his humble Prayer, <HI>I tell you this Man we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Home justified, rather than the other.</HI> Now it is certain, that when Christ says this Man was justified; and by thy Words shalt thou be justified, and St. <HI>James</HI> says by Works a Man is justified, they meant it in some <HI>Respect</HI> or other. No, says Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> we are not justified by these Things neither in Part, nor in any Respect whatsoever. When the Scripture so expresly teaches that we are justified by our Works, it becomes us modestly to enquire in what Respect, or in what Part this is: But in comes Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> like <HI>Alex∣ander,</HI> he will not spend Time to untie, but immediately cuts the <HI>Gordian</HI> Knot, and plumply denies there is any such Thing. But certainly since there is a most express and full Contradiction between our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostle <HI>James</HI> on the one Side, and Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> on the other; the one or the other Party must be mistaken. I leave it to the World to judge which is most likely to be in the Error.</P>
<P>I now desire to know what he has said to those horrid Things which I mentioned as being essential Parts of Calvinism, and which I must embrace if I become a Calvinist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He says thus,</HI> <Q><HI>If he (GOD) foreknew all Events as they will come to pass, then they will certainly and infallibly come to pass, as he foreknew they would.— And why them will not your frightful Consequences follow as well from your own Doctrine, as from mine?</HI></Q> P. 91.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To this I answer with Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> <Q>It is observable, that though this Argument be offered in Favour of the Decrees of absolute Election and Reprobation, yet doth it plainly over∣throw them, or render them superfluous. For be it that these Decrees were made from Eternity; yet seeing GOD's Fore∣knowledge of the Events of all Men, was also from Eternity, must he not know what would be the Condition of all Men when he made these Decrees? And what Need then could there be of a Decree for that Event which was infalli∣ble, by Virtue of his Foreknowledge without that Decree? Either GOD foresaw these Events, independently on, and in the same Moment that he made these Decrees; and then seeing the Objects of both these Decrees are the same indi∣vidual Persons, which he saw then would certainly be faved,
<PB N="75" REF="006094_0072_10278504767C93F0"/>or perish independently upon them, what Need could there be of these Decrees to ascertain that Event, which his own Foreknowledge had render'd certain and infallible?</Q> So that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> in granting an eternal divine Foreknowledge of all Events, has entirely given up the Notion of eternal absolute Decrees, or made them altogether needless and superfluous. — Or else if he pretends, that GOD only <Q>foresaw these future Contingencies by Virtue of his Decrees, that they should come to pass;</Q> then must he hold that GOD's Decrees are before his Foreknowledge, and the Reason of it: And if so, then this Argument of his does not in the least Degree lessen the Horror of them: But leaves that Notion obnoxious to all those dreadful Consequences I mentioned and a Thousand more. And this Sort of Foreknowledge <Q>must be attended with a fatal Necessity: Though in this Case it is not GOD's Foreknow∣ledge, but his Decrees, which creates that Necessity; all Things upon this Supposition being necessary; that is, such as cannot otherwise be, not because GOD foreknows them; but because by his immutable Decrees he hath made them necessary; <HI>i. e.</HI> he foreknows because they are necessary, but doth not make them necessary by foreknowing them.</Q></P>
<P>GOD's Foreknowledge has no Influence at all upon my Be∣haviour, it is no Cause at all of my Salvation or Damnation. <Q><HI>Foreknowledge is Knowledge, and Knowledge depends on the Ex∣istence of Things known, and not they on it."</HI> Should GOD by immediate Revelation give me the Knowledge of the Event of any Man's State or Actions, would my Knowledge of them have any Influence upon his Actions? Surely none at all, and yet my Knowledge as far as it is thus communicated, would be as certain and intallible as is that of GOD's. To illustrate this in some Measure by the Comparison of our own Knowledge, we know certainly that some Things are, and that some Things will be.</Q> I know my good Friend is dead, I know certainly there will be a Resurrection, and <Q>when I know these Things are, or will be, they cannot but be, yet manifest it is, that our Knowledge doth not at all affect the Things we thus know, or make them either more certain, or more future than they would be without it. Now Fore∣knowledge in GOD is Knowledge; as therefore Knowledge has no Influence on Things that are, so neither has Fore∣knowledge on Things that shall be. And consequently the Foreknowledge of any Action that would be otherwise free,
<PB N="76" REF="006094_0073_1026E7BB50FE8A48"/>cannot alter or diminish that Freedom: Whereas GOD's Decree of Election [is his Will concerning the Event.] it is powerful and active, and comprehends the Preparation and Exhibition of such Means as shall unfrustrably produce the End. And his Decree of Reprobation (is his Will and Pleasure) it is active, as far as Action is required, to render a Man deficient, and therefore sinful of Necessity, it being a Decree of withholding from the Objects of it, that Grace which can alone enable them to do what GOD commands, or to avoid what GOD forbids on the severest Penalty. Now Sin having no efficient but only a deficient Cause, it consisting only in not doing what is commanded, and not avoiding what is forbidden, that which renders it necessary for me to be thus deficient must lay me under a Necessity of sinning. — GOD's Foreknowledge renders no Action necessary, other∣wise it would lay a Necessity upon his own Actions, for he foreknew from all Eternity that he would create a World, that he would send his Son, &amp;c. but this did not make it necessary that he should create a World or send his Son, why then should it be conceived that it lays a Necessity upon human Actions, or impairs the Freedom of them? Now if Foreknowledge doth not impair the Freedom of our Actions any more than if GOD had no such Foreknowledge, and it be reasonable to give Precepts, and render Exhortations and Motives to Men free to perform what is required, and what they are exhorted and thus moved to, it must be reasonable thus to deal with Men, notwithstanding GOD's Foreknowledge of their Actions; but it is not so with Respect to GOD's Decrees, his Decree of Election comprehending not only the End, but the Means to it, as to be wrought by his special Grace and unfrustrable Operation, which I cannot resist, if I cannot have the Will to resist it; and that I cannot have, if this Operation determines my Will to Act in Com∣pliance with it: And where the Sin consists in a Defect i. e. the not doing what is required, and the not avoiding what is forbidden, the Decree of with holding that Grace without which that Effect is necessary, is a Decree that the Sin should be inevitable, and to the Objects of it necessary. — Moreover GOD's Foreknowledge reaches all Things, not only those which will be, but also those which may be, he foresees not only what will be done, but also after what Manner it will be done, that free Actions will be done freely, and so his Fore∣knowledge
<PB N="77" REF="006094_0074_102785115AEAA7D0"/>must rather establish than take away our Freedom; for if God foresees that I might abstain from what he sees I will not abstain, and that I might will and do, what I neither will nor do, as he must if he sees I act freely, then he sees that I might not perish, when he sees that I will perish, and he sees that I might be willing and obedient, and so be saved, when he sees that I will not be saved. And then there must be Place and equitable Grounds for all his Admonitions, Ex∣hortations and Motives not to perish but to turn and live, because they are only Exhortations. Commands and Motives to do, and to abstain from that which he sees that I may freely do, or may abstain from, and therefore must have Power so to do.</Q> So that there is an infinite Difference between the Consequences of GOD's Foreknowledge as held by us, and the Consequences of the absolute Decrees as held by the Calvinists.</P>
<P>Now let me briefly take Notice of one or two Things in his concluding Address. 1. He insinuates, as though we kept Men off from an entire Reliance on Christ. This I esteem very injurious, and slanderous. No, GOD forbid that I should do any Thing like this. I rely as entirely, as wholly, as ab∣solutely, and as unreservedly on my blessed and only Redeemer Jesus Christ for Salvation, as any Calvinist on Earth. Christ is all in all to my Soul, in him are all my Hopes for Assistance both to begin, continue, and end my christian Course, to obtain a Pardon not only for the Myriads of Myriads of my Sins (which I committed while he gave me Grace to do better) but even for the Pardon of my best Duties, on Christ I depend for all I need in this Life, and all I hope for to Eternity. On him I depend not only as the Meriter but as the Bestower of all. Only herein (perhaps) I differ from you, I think Christ will allow me no Interest in him, he will not own me as his Disciple, unless I depart from all Iniquity, and obey him. Here, here is all my Fear, and all my Concern.</P>

<P><HI>Well, say what you please, his Observation that practical Holiness prevails most among those who embrace our Principles, this goes a great Way with me.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Gentleman has written four or five Books against me, in the space of a few Years, in each of which (I think) he has boasted of the great Piety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Party, and because Com∣parisons are odious, I have return'd little or no Answer, — And now shall say but a few Words to it. <Q>This Trick, says
<PB N="78" REF="006094_0075_10278512F7E595E8"/>Bishop <HI>Patrick</HI> of appropriating true Piety to your selves, and despising the Professors of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as destitute of the Power of Religion; and mere Formalists, has always been the topping Argument of your Party — But are you the great Chamberlains of the House of GOD? Are all the Vessels of Honour in it committed to your Custody? Are you Keepers of the Book of Life, wherein the Names of the Heirs of Grace are all registered? Have you the Balance of the Sanctuary? Or is the Fan put into your Hands to separate the Chaff and Corn▪ Speak no more so presumptu∣ously; and let not such Arrogance come out of your Mouth, lest it prove true upon you, which St. <HI>Austin</HI> saith to <HI>Per∣menian</HI> — Because you have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Patience, and make Haste before the Time to separate Chaff and Corn, accounting at your Pleasure some Men abominable, and some approved; you have declared your selves to be but Chaff, and most light Chaff carried out of the Compass of Charity, by the Wind of your own Pride.</Q></P>
<P>But supposing you <HI>were all holy, even every one of you,</HI> yet this is not the Effect of Calvinistic Notions, but by Virtue of our Principles, which in spight of all you can do, you can't help but believe, and our Doctrine is all you have to keep you back from Wickedness. And if any of you are wicked (as I hope not) yet this is not so much the Fault of the Man as of his Principles, whereas if we are vicious (as is too true) it is the Man and not his Principles that is to be blamed. — Christianity is the best, and the only true Religion in the World: and yet some Christians are the very worst of Men. Will you then renounce Christianity upon that Account. Never was true Christianity set in a better Light than at this Day in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Never was any Scheme better calculated to make Men wise and good Christians: and if we are vicious, we are of all Men on Earth the most inexcusable.</P>
<P>But with all I must observe, that different Sects have different Notions about Piety, and wherein it consists. As you know the holy Pharisees differ'd in their Sentiments about real Holiness from our blessed Lord, and accounted him a very loose Liver. And I think learn'd Men are agreed that the Pharisees were ri∣gid Predestinarians or Calvinists, as they are now called.</P>
<P>They repeatedly insist upon it, that Piety prevails among any People in Proportion as these Tenets obtain: The Reverse of which the World knows to be true. Look back upon the State
<PB N="79" REF="006094_0076_102785148959FB60"/>of our Nation just One Hundred Years past, in the Time of the grand Rebellion, never did these Principles prevail so much before or since, and never was there so much Wickedness in the Nation. It is amazing to observe what horrid Crimes were perpetrated by those Men, who pretended to your special Grace and had their Mouths full of religious Cant. And what did these Principles end in but a monstrous Variety of Heresies, and even Atheism itself? The like will ever be the Effect of those Principles, when they are zealously propagated without a Mix∣ture of our Principles to counterwork them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We are now to part, and perhaps may never have a second Meeting, tell me then are you of the same Mind that you exprest in your last, that if you became a Calvinist, you must admit into your Mind all those horrid Notions. And don't you think that as Mr.</HI> Dickinson <HI>has represented that Scheme, it is tolerable.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hate this painting and disguising one's Sentiments in Religion. I'll receive nothing as an Article of divine Faith which I am asham'd to shew naked to the World. Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> (give him his Due) was a very great, and a very honest Man, he spoke his Opinion frankly, because he believed it to be a divine Truth: But these Gentlemen turn into a thousand different Shapes, so that it is impossible to know one of them when you meet him, whether he be a Calvinist or an Arminian: I have but one Mark or Criterion to know them by, and that is, they always seem to bear a mortal Hatred against the Use of Reason and Common Sense in Religion, and will certainly pick a Quar∣rel with you if you talk intelligibly about Christianity. Now as to your other Question, I seriously declare, that I firm∣ly believe that all those horrible Things are insepara∣ble from Calvinism. I hoped, but alas my Hopes were vain! that Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> would have at least attempted to shew me how I might have separated them from his Doctrines. And whereas you think you see clearly, that they have no Connexion with Calvinism, I therefore beseech you for my Soul's Sake, let me into this Mystery, and shew me how I may see, as you do. You know it is a common Saying with your Ministers, that every Man is naturally a Hater of GOD, and if you don't know the Time when you hated GOD, wished there were no GOD, and would gladly dethrone him, you are not converted. And truly their Doctrines of Predestination, original Sin, special Redemp∣tion, and denying a Sufficiency of Grace to all but the Elect (as I understand them) make such an injurious and frightful Re∣presentation
<PB N="80" REF="006094_0077_102785160C311418"/>of GOD, that I cannot see how they can avoid hat∣ing him, and wishing there were no such GOD; until they are sure of their own Election. The Representation which the Gospel makes of GOD, is to beautiful and charming that it will captivate a rational Affection: and none but Devils and their Accomplices can hate the GOD of Christians. The holy Scrip∣ture represents GOD as <HI>Live</HI> it self, the <HI>Lord, the Lord GOD merciful and gracious, long suffering, abundant in Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e's and Truth, pard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning Iniquity, Transgression and Sin.</HI> One who bears the Affection of a Father to all Mankind, and treats all as his Offspring, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works; he casts off none of the human Race, but only for their incurable Wickedness: He prepared Heaven for Mankind, and Hell was originally designed only for the Devils: hence Christ, the Judge will say of Heaven, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t the Kingdom prepared for you:</HI> But of Hell, <HI>Go ye Cursed into ever∣lasting Fire, Prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</HI> Not prepar∣ed for Mankind, as Heaven was. He sent not his Son to con∣demn but to save the whole World, he is always ready to assist and holds out his helping Hand to every one; his Arms are open to receive and embrace every human Creature, and is al∣ways more ready to give, than we are to ask—And though some Countries and Ages have, and do enjoy fewer Talents than we, and they have been destitute of a standing Revelation; yet will he make all fair Allowances for it, and require little where little is given, and no Man shall ever be miserable through any Defect on GOD's Part, but only through his own wilful Negligence and Perverseness. Thus the holy Bible represents GOD. And who would not love and rejoice in such a GOD? Who would not wish that it might be true, that there is such a GOD, if there were any Doubt of it? But to draw the Picture of the ever blessed GOD according to our Idea of the very worst of Beings; to represent him as an Hater of the greater Part of Mankind, as one who hated his own Offspring before they were born, and resolved to damn them to H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Torments before they had done Good or Evil, or were capable of offending him, merely to shew his Sovereignty, and that he can do what he pleases with his own; as one whose Justice is such, that he sets the Childrens Teeth on Edge, because their Father had eaten sour Grapes Thousands of Years before they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> born; and makes them a motly Mixture of <HI>Beast and Devil,</HI> as fast as he gives them Being, because <HI>Adam</HI> sinned, which was not in their
<PB N="81" REF="006094_0078_1027851ACC401FA8"/>Power to prevent, as one whose Love to the Souls of Men is so very little, that when all might have been redeemed by Christ's Passion as well as a few, he of his meer Pleasure chose that the bigger Part by far of them who equally needed it, and would have equally improved it, should be excluded, and shut out, and have no Part or Share in it; not because it would have made any Addition to Christ's Sufferings, but merely because GOD did not chuse that they should be saved And though he declares his most tender Love to Mankind, and his compassionate Concern for their Salvation, and intreats them to be happy, and swears to them that he does not will their Death, but their Con∣version and Life, and asks them affectionately, why they will die? and how long it will be ere they be made clean? and what could be done for them more? and wishes they would hearken to him, and says, O that thou hadst known the Things that belong to thy Peace, yet notwithstanding all this Show of Mercy, his secret Decree and unchangeable Will and Desire is, that the most of them shall burn forever in that Fire prepared for the obstinate Devil and his Angels. And therefore would not that his Son should effectually redeem them, or his Spirit yield them sufficient Grace, without which he knew, they could no more escape Hell than they could shun Death. Now when we represent GOD to our Minds surrounded with this amazing Horror, how can we prevent our Hearts rising against him, and wishing there was no such GOD. I profess for my Part, I had rather a Million Times, never to have had a Being, than to think thus of GOD.—And why this horrible Representation of GOD should be called <HI>A Vindication of Sovereign free Grace,</HI> is past my Comprehension, unless it be ironically. That any Man should be found, that can think so unworthily of GOD, and im∣pute such cruel Things to the Father, of Mercies, is very surpriz∣ing! But what is still more wonderful, is, that they should so strangely affront common Sense, and the Reason of all Man∣kind, as to stile these horrible Tenets, the <HI>Doctrines of Free Grace;</HI> As if the fewer GOD was willing to save, the freer and richer his Grace must be. And if so it must follow that to preach that GOD w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not willing to save any at all, or not more than one; this would be to preach the most precious, the most free, the most rich Grace of all. Whoever before, imagined that Good∣ness was magnified by being confined to a few; and lessen'd by being extended to all: By this Rule he is the most charita∣ble and bountiful Man whose Bowels of Compassion are con∣tracted,
<PB N="82" REF="006094_0079_1027851C4D135210"/>and Hands so close shut, that he will shew no Kindness, but only to one or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o Favourites and Fondlings; not he whose Heart and Hard is open to all Men.—I have now done, and I do declare as a dying Man, as far as I know my own Heart, my real Design in this Discourse has been to vindicate the moral Perfections of our heavenly Father, the free Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the liberal Communications of the Holy Ghost. If I have in any Thing erred <HI>(and who can know his Errors)</HI> I desire a candid Admonition from any of my Fel∣low-Christians, and most humbly pray for Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on from GOD, through Jesus Christ, to whom, together with the Holy Ghost, Three Persons in one GOD, be Glory forever.</P>
