<HEAD>TO THE READER</HEAD>
<P>IT is sad to consider how many <HI>Pro∣fessed Christians</HI> live in the <HI>Utter Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> and how few <HI>Communicants</HI> are careful to <HI>Pre∣pare duly, Eat and Drink worthily, and Live answerably.</HI></P>
<P>A great deal has been written upon this <HI>Occasion,</HI> to which I have added the following <HI>Sheets,</HI> which I may be allow'd, I hope, to Publish, without being thought to pretend to any thing Extraordinary, or detract from the <HI>Excellent Performances</HI> of others.</P>
<P>For while the Case requires and admits Help, there can be no Harm in making
<PB REF="001739_0003_0FB77C146637D040"/>further Trials; especially in those Circum∣stances where the most likely Means are not ever the most Effectual: But Success more especially depends upon the <HI>Divine Ble∣ssing,</HI> which is not always given in Regular Proportion to the Natural Aptitude of the Means, but sometimes in a sovereign and unaccountable Manner; <HI>That no Flesh should Glory in his Presence.</HI></P>
<P>However, it is too plain to be deny'd, That the <HI>different Capacities and Re∣lishes</HI> of Men make a <HI>Variety</HI> useful, if not necessary; and that there may be a Con∣currence of many <HI>other Circumstances</HI> which shall give a meaner Performance, the Advantage with some People, as to Usefulness, above others that are more Spritely and Elaborate. Nay, it is no im∣possible Thing, that a man may read a Book upon some fore in Consideration, which shall be blessed to do Him that good which could never be expected from better Dis∣courses not known of, or not minded.</P>
<P><PB REF="001739_0004_0FB77C17E6E1C7F8"/>
Upon these Accounts I have Publish'd the ensuing <HI>Papers,</HI> hoping they may be useful to <HI>some,</HI> whatever their <HI>General</HI> Entertainment be.</P>
<P>I will not detain you any longer than while I desire you to joyn your Prayers with mine in recommending these Endea∣vours to the Blessing of Him who alone can <HI>give the</HI> desired <HI>Increase.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The <HI>Christian</HI> convinc'd, that its his Duty to come, to the <HI>Lord's-Table.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>DO <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Remembrance of Me.</HI> 1 Cor. 11.25. It is the voice of my LORD; and least I should think it was directed only to his Twelve Disciples, or the <HI>Christians</HI> of the First Ages, St. <HI>Paul</HI> assures me, that this Ordinance is to run Parallel with Time, and by it the Church is to <HI>shew forth</HI> Christ's <HI>Death' till he come.</HI> Con∣sider, O my Soul! Is the <HI>Lord at hand?</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001739_0006_0FB77C1C850172C8"/>Will he <HI>surely come quickly?</HI> How shall I answer it in that Day, that I have neg∣lected so express a Command? A Command not couch'd in Ambiguous and Uncertain Terms, but deliver'd in as Plain and Positive Expressions as any in the Bible. <HI>Sure I am more Brutish than any Man, and have not the Under∣standing of a Man!</HI> I have profess'd a mighty Respect to the Authority of my Redeemer, and a vast Reverence for his Laws, but how unaccountably have I manag'd! As tho' I were to chuse what Commands I would please to obey, and were vested with a dispensing Power, superior to the Obligation of his Pre∣cepts, to whom <HI>all Power is given both in Heaven and in Earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.18.</NOTE></P>
<P>Blush, O my Soul, and be asham'd at so inconsistent a Conduct! Either Christ is thy Prince and Lawgiver, or He is not. If not, profess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> self an Infidel, and renounce thy Baptism. If He be, obey him in all that he requires, and
<PB N="3" REF="001739_0007_0FB77C1E0589C150"/>either believe, that he has not made it thy Duty to Remember Him, or yield a Chearful Subjection in this, as well as other Instances.</P>
<P>When He has said, <HI>Do this,</HI> either He does not mean what He says, or does not speak to thee; or else thy Disobe∣dience is at once inexcusable and unac∣countable.</P>
<P>Can the Words be wrested? Is any <HI>Sophistry</HI> capable of contesting their Sense? What can <HI>Do this,</HI> signify less than a Positive Command? Or, how can the Will of my Prince be ever signi∣fy'd, so as to oblige me, if so plain Terms are by any Cavil to be eluded?</P>
<P>But does He speak to me? If I were a true Disciple, I were indeed within the Compass of the Law, and must be either a Communicant or a Rebel.</P>
<P>Consider, O my Soul, and don't rash∣ly dash thy Hopes, to escape thy Duty. 'Tis true, I am not such a Christian as I should be: But am I willing to have my Name missing in the Book of Life?
<PB N="4" REF="001739_0008_0FB77C24984B8738"/>Can I be content to resign my Birth∣right, and own that I have neither Lot nor Portion in the Son of God? Would I be pass'd by, when the <HI>Lord shall count,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 87.6.</NOTE> <HI>and write up the People?</HI> Either I am a Christian, or I am not: If I am, <HI>This Commandment is for me:</HI> If I am not, what am I? A Child of Wrath, and a Subject of the Devil? And is such a Condition tolerable? Let me give up my self to Christ immediately: Make no tarrying, O my Soul, lest the Aven∣ger of Blood overtake thee; and lest if thou trifle to Day, thou be lost to Mor∣row. If I have been but <HI>almost perswad∣ed to be a Christian</HI> hitherto, its high Time that I make an absolute, unreser∣ved Surrender of my self to Christ pre∣sently, without any farther Delay; and then let what I have done here in Se∣cret, be publickly own'd and avouch'd at the Lord's Table.</P>
<Q><P>And now, Lord, <HI>All my Desire is before the:</HI> I am convinc'd of rimy
<PB N="5" REF="001739_0009_0FB77C29DEBB9590"/>Duty, and dare no longer disobey. Oh forgive me, that I have rebell'd so long! I have been invited to thy Ta∣ble, and foolishly neglected many an Opportunity of strengthening and re∣freshing my Soul. I have been com∣manded to attend in Remembrance of Him who deserves never to be for∣gotten, and by my Neglect have at once pour'd Contempt upon thy Au∣thority, and flighted his Love who <HI>loved me, and gave Himself for me.</HI></P>
<P>I bless thee, that I am in some Mea∣sure sensible of my Error, and am come to a Resolution, that I will have Respect to this, as well as other Com∣mands. The Time past shall suffice me to have lived in the Omission of so plain a Duty, and the Neglect of so glorious a Privilege. Oh! <HI>keep it up∣on the Imagination of my Heart for ever,</HI> and let me be confirm'd in those good Purposes, which thy own Spirit has led me to form, and no less Power than His can help me to keep!</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001739_0010_0FB77C2D4A059510"/>
I am indeed unworthy, but acknow∣ledge the Insufficiency of that Plea, against a Positive Command. I am unworthy, but must not therefore re∣fuse thy Kindness. I hope I am in Christ, tho' the meanest Soul that re∣lates to Him, and therefore cannot any longer want an Ordinance; in the Use of which, I hope <HI>to grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of my Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Or, if I have hitherto deceiv'd my self and <HI>walk'd in a vain shew,</HI> I now desire to accept the Gospel-Offer, to own my Baptismal Covenant, to a∣vouch Thee, O Father, Son and Spirit, to be my God, my All, my Everlast∣ing Portion. Upon my bended Knees I now accept an Offer'd Saviour, and call Heaven and Earth to witness, that as far as I can Judge, I am sincere. And this I would declare in the Pre∣sence of thy People, begging with some Hope and Confidence, that I may be accepted now, and found in the Number of the Faithful at last.
<PB N="7" REF="001739_0011_0FB77C3353604BF0"/>O direct me in all the steps I am to take; and let me see my Way, and follow it, and have Comfort in the Issue, thro' the Merits and Mediation of my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. <HI>Amen,</HI></P></Q>

<P>NOW, O my Soul, thou hast <HI>opened thy Mouth to the Lord, and canst not go back!</HI> Thy next Duty is to apply thy self to the Minister, <HI>who is the Steward of these My∣steries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4.1.</NOTE> that if he judge thee meet, he may admit thee to the Holy Solemnity. Let me not be foolishly bash∣ful, much less act the Hypocrite; but use the utmost Frankness with my Spiri∣tual Guide: That he may be able to
<PB N="8" REF="001739_0012_0FB77C36550491C8"/>pass the better Judgment upon my Case, let me state it fairly; neither pretend to what I have not receiv'd, nor deny what I have. <HI>This</HI> would be Base In∣gratitude; <HI>That</HI> Impious Monkery.

If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> press his Satisfaction, don't dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st him, but believe him a more capable Judge of thy Case than thou art thy se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Not that thou shouldst esteem him infa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lible; It's his Master's Province to search Hearts: But sure his Judgment deserves the same Regard as a Physician's about thy Body, or a Lawyer's concerning thy Estate. Be faithful in the Account of thy self, and doubt not but he'll be faith∣ful in delivering his Opinion. And with his Faithfulness thou mayst expect Ten∣derness,

<Q><P>Oh! that God who has convinc'd me of my Duty, and brought me to a Resolution, would help me to be open and sincere. Let me not go about to impose upon thy Minister; which would be justly interpreted as an At∣tempt to impose upon my Lord him∣self, <HI>whose Eyes are as a Flame of Fire;</HI> who can't be <HI>deceived,</HI> as <HI>knowing what is in Man;</HI> and will not be <HI>mock'd,</HI> as being a <HI>Jealous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> O give me Free∣dom, that I may utter what I have felt. Give me Humility, that I mayn't be ashamed to discover those Follies and Imperfections that may be at the Bottom of my Doubts and Scruples. Give me a teachable Disposition, that I may not despise Instruction. Help me to remember the Relation, in which

<P>Let me not despise his Judgment of my Case, nor yet lay too great a Stress upon it, remembring that Ministers may accept where God may reject, and admit those to the Sacrament, as qua∣lify'd for Communion with the Church, who yet shall be found unworthy Re∣ceivers, as not having a <HI>Wedding-Gar∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>Oh direct thy Servant, that he may deal prudently and tenderly, and yet withal, faithfully. Let him be duly appriz'd of my Case, and pass such a Verdict as the great Judge will ratify.</P></Q>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> After having been approv'd by the <HI>Mini∣ster,</HI> and allow'd to Communicate.</HEAD>
<P>BE thankful, O my Soul, that God has heard the Voice of thy Suppli∣cation!
<PB N="11" REF="001739_0015_0FB77C3C0E13D220"/>His Minister has dealt tenderly and faithfully with thee, has encourag'd thy Design, promis'd the Assistance of his Prayers, given thee Instruction, and sui∣table Advice, and nothing more remains, but thy Actual Preparation for that Ho∣ly Ordinance.</P>
<P>But, O see to it, that thy Heart be right. 'Tis a deceitful Heart thou hast to manage: Look to thy self, that thy <HI>Goodness</HI> be not as the <HI>Morning Cloud</HI> and <HI>early Dew,</HI> that soon passeth <HI>away.</HI> Re∣member the Warning the Minister gave thee, that thou shouldst not act in such a Case without serious Thought, and mature Deliberation; lest rash Engage∣ments should issue in broken Vows, and cursed Apostacy.</P>
<P>Take heed, O my Soul, that I ben'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another Instance to confirm the Truth of that Awful Observation, of which he <HI>told me weeping,</HI> That many Hot Profes∣sors have dwindled into Luke-warm Christians, and sometimes fell headlong into the Gulf of Profaneness and Infideli∣ty
<PB N="12" REF="001739_0016_0FB77C3F0A4F82D8"/>Tremble to think if this should be thy sad Case, and let thy Fear quicken thy Application, that thou mayst not end in the Flesh, after having begun in the Spirit.</P>
<P>Yet let me not be discourag'd. 'Tis in∣deed a great Thing to be a Christian; but great is thè Grace and Mercy of God, Great is the Merit, and Prevalent the Intercession of my Redeemer, who has pray'd for his Disciples, that their <HI>Faith fail not.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 22.32.</NOTE> Great is the power of the Holy Ghost, who can preserve my Graces, to subdue my Corruptions, help me to Crucify the World, and resist and vanquish the De∣vil. Never forget the Encouragement he gave me to hope, that if my Heart don't reproach me, as acting deceitfully in my Professions and Engagements; and if I will keep close to God in the Way of his Appointments, I need not fear be∣ing decepted of him now, and having the good Work begun, <HI>carry'd on to the Day of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001739_0017_0FB77C491C2A9240"/>
But. O my Soul, see to it; and again, I say, see to it, that thou do <HI>with full Purpose of Heart cleave to the Lord.</HI> That thy present Devotion don't prove a sud∣den Flash; but having set <HI>thy Hand to the Plough,</HI> don't think <HI>of looking back.</HI> Re∣member that awful Text, <HI>It had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteous∣ness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 2.21.</NOTE> <HI>than after they have known it, to turn from the Holy Command∣ment.</HI> Let this Word be a Spur to thy Diligence; but not revive thy Scruples. It were better never to communicate, than afterwards to Apostatize.</P>
<P>But will this be a Plea for thy Diso∣bedience? Consider, O my Soul, at this Rate, thou shouldst never have been Baptiz'd, never call'd thy self a Christi∣an, never joyn'd thy self to a worship∣ping Assembly, never heard a Semon, or put up a Prayer, never given an Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, or perform'd a Duty of any Sort; seeing all these will aggravate thy Misery, if thou prove a Hypocrite, or Apostate, at last.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001739_0018_0FB77C52AC6904C0"/>
Therefore in the Strength of Christ, hold on thy Way: Don't decline thy <HI>Lord's Table,</HI> but prepare for it; that be∣ing a worthy Communicant here, thou mayst at last be a <HI>Partaker of the Inheri∣tance of the Saints in Ligh.</HI></P>
<P>Attempt all this in a better Strength than thy own; ever remembring, that of thy self thou canst do nothing, and that, God's Grace is at once necessary and suf∣ficient for thee.</P>
<Q><P>Now O my God, I adore and praise Thee, that I have been enabled to open my Case to thy Minister; and that thou hast inclin'd his Heart kindly' to encourage me, wifely to instruct' me, and faithfully to warn me. O may thy good Spirit make his Endeavours' effectual, that I may receive Instructi∣on and take Warning. I am sensible of the Treachery and Baseness of my own Heart; but I am also acquainted with thy Power, and Mercy, and Faithfulness: Oh let me not rashly take up a Profession which I shall as hastily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>andon, or never live up to.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001739_0019_0FB77C575F8828A8"/>
Help me to understand the Engage∣ments I am going under, that I may count the Cost, and not prove a Foo∣lish Builder: Help me to Consider the Difficulties and Disadvantages that at∣tend Religion, and the Troubles it may expose me to. May I seriously consi∣der, that I must deny my self, and take up my Cross, and follow Christ, if I would be his Disciple.</P>
<P>Yet let none of these Things move me from my Resolution. O give me such near and affecting Views of <HI>the Glory that is to be reveal'd,</HI> and of that <HI>Wrath and fiery Indignation</HI> which a∣waits the Ungodly: So set Death and Judgment before me, to impress me with a Sense of the Worth of my Soul, and the Emptiness of this World; that I may be fully determined to accept a Christ, and adhere to him with all his Disadvantages; that I my <HI>count all things but Loss, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Him.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.8.</NOTE> And O may this be my unaltera∣ble
<PB N="16" REF="001739_0020_0FB77C58A43C1B98"/>unalterable Perswasion. Let me never turn aside, nor go a Whoring from Thee. Oh let me not wander from thy Commandments! Let me never, like an ungracious Prodigal, forsake my Father's House, or count <HI>his Meat contemptible.</HI> O never let me deny or forget that Jesus, whom I am so so∣lemnly to remember and avouch for my Lord and my God. Let the un∣clean Devil never re-enter, and take Possession of this Soul, which I Con∣secrate as a <HI>Temple, to the Holy Ghost.</HI> I am full of Fears, and have Reason to be jealous of my self; but yet I am not void of Hope; nor have any Reason to distrust my God. Thy Grace is suffici∣ent for me. O for <HI>thy Names sake, lead me and guide me: Put thy Fear into my Heart, that I may never depart from Thee.</HI></P>
<P>And O let not the Deceitfulness of my own Heart, the Incumbrances of the World, or the Sollicitations of the Devil, put me by the Design I have
<PB N="17" REF="001739_0021_0FB77C5A2935AAD8"/>form'd of attending at thy Table; May a Sense of Duty outweigh a Thou∣sand Excuses; and Hopes of Gracious Assistance, and merciful Acceptance, silence all my Fears.</P>
<P>Yet let me not come unworthily: May I never <HI>eat and drink Judgment to my self.</HI> Deliver me from the dread∣ful Guilt of <HI>Crucifying afresh</HI> and <HI>put∣ting to open Shame,</HI> Him whom I think my Soul loves, and I desire to remem∣ben, avouch and honour. Keep me from the great Unhappiness of being poison'd by the Richest Food, and Highest Cordial; of coming for a Blessing, and carrying away a Curse. <HI>Amen,</HI> for Jesus Sake.</P></Q>

<P>COnsider, O my Soul, the Day is near, in which I am to appear at
<PB N="18" REF="001739_0022_0FB77C5D33CA29D8"/>the Table of my Lord! It concerns me to prepare, that I may be a welcome Guest, and a worthy Receiver. <HI>To pre∣pare!.</HI> Tho' the Expression be short, its comprehensive; and I shall find it implies more Work than can be crouded into a little Time, or done with a little Pains. Let me therefore redeem some Time from my Business, at least from my Plea∣sures, before the Week be far advanc'd; that unforeseen Occurrences may'nt de∣prive me of an Opportunity to dress my Soul for the Glorious Solemnity, and put me upon the unhapy Plunge of missing the Feast, or wanting the Wedding-Gar∣ment.</P>
<P>And, O my Soul, exert thy self, let all thy Powers be upon the Stretch. <HI>What thou findest to do, do it with all thy Might,</HI> that thou mayst not ridiculously trifle a∣way that Time, which thou seemest con∣scientiously to redeem.</P>
<P>See to it, that in thy Retirements thou be really alone; that the World don't follow thee into thy Closet; or thy
<PB N="19" REF="001739_0023_0FB77C5EA5AC39E0"/>Thoughts fly abroad into the World, and leave a Heartless Carcase to enter∣tain thy God. If thy Mind ben't fix'd upon the Work before thee, thy Retire∣ments will be but solemn Idleness: Or if the World be admitted to put thee by thy Duty, the Closet will be but a more private <HI>Compting House.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>LET me now, O my Soul, prepare for my Preparations. Let me lay down the Plan of my Design, that I may not be at a Loss how to manage, but may go regularly on without that Con∣fusion of Thought which will lessen the Pleasure and Profit of my Work.</P>
<P>There appears to be several Branches of that Business, which is called by the General Name of Preparation. But be∣fore I enter upon Particulars, I would first be deeply possessed of the Necessity
<PB N="20" REF="001739_0024_0FB77C648909CC08"/>of the Duty in General; which will quicken me to the greater Care and Se∣riousness in a Business that so well de∣serves it.</P>
<P>To this End consider closely, that an unprepar'd Communicant must necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rily be an unworthy one. And the Dan∣ger of eating and drinking unworthily is represented by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in very Awful Terms; such a one <HI>eats and drinks Dam∣nation to himself!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Damnation!</HI> Tremble, O my Soul, at the Dismal Thought. Sure it should strike a Chilness into my Blood, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Horror into my Spirit! Can any Tongue express, can any Mind conceive the dire∣ful Contents of that Expression? Howe∣ver Interpreters may soften it, the Thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ning can never be disarm'd: The Thun∣der of it must needs put a tender Spirit into Convulsions and Agonies, at least affect him to a very high Degree.</P>
<P>To <HI>eat and drink Judgment to ones fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> can signify no less than falling under the Displeasure of the Living God. And
<PB N="21" REF="001739_0025_0FB77C66CD96A340"/>who knows what it is to be the Object of his angry Resentments, in whose <HI>Fa∣vour is Life,</HI> and whose Wrath is worse than Death? If I eat and drink unwor∣thily, the least I can expect is Temporal Strokes; I am in Danger of Spiritual ones, &amp; deserve Eternal Vengeance. In∣deed there is Forgiveness with God; but shall I sin because Grace abounds? At that Rate, I may venture In Defiance of that Word, <HI>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will Judge,</HI> &amp;c. or commit the worst of Villanies, because God is <HI>good, and plen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us in Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Nor yet shall this Thought deter me from my Duty; for upon the same Prin∣ciple I must abstain from Hearing, be∣cause that will aggravate my Condem∣nation if I am found disobedient. <HI>The Prayer of the wicked is an Abomination:</HI> Yea, <HI>the Plougbing of the Wicked is Sin;</HI> and shall I therefore forsake the Publick Worship of God, or neglect the Business of my particular Calling?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001739_0026_0FB77C6AB9966E80"/>
But, O my Soul, let this Thought af∣fect thee, so as to quicken thy Endea∣vours, that thou mayst be admitted to the <HI>Lord's Table,</HI> as a worthy Receiver, and return <HI>rejoycing in the God of thy Sal∣vation.</HI> Let the Hopes of this put Life into thy Attempts.

It's agreat Thing to be duly prepar'd; but <HI>Thy Grace is sufficient for me. Let thy Strength be made perfect in my Weakness,</HI> and the Praise shall be thine own.</P></Q>

<P>Do I understand how it Seals the Co∣venant to every worthy Receiver? How hereby God obliges himself to be their God, to pardon their Sins, sanctify their Souls, and at last bring 'em to Eternal Happiness and Glory. How herein they engage themselves to Him, thankfully accepting what he offers, and chearfully complying with what he demands. That herein we open our Mouths to God, and swear, that we will be his, in the Bonds of an Everlasting <HI>Covenant,</HI> that <HI>shall not be forgotten;</HI> accepting him, and resigning our selves.</P>

<P>I must also enquire concerning my Re∣pentance. An <HI>Impenitent</HI> Commu∣nicant <HI>I</HI> know, must be an unworthy one. That <HI>I</HI> am a Sinner, is a Matter past Question, and that as such <HI>I</HI> am expos'd to the Displeasure of God; so that if he should enter into Judgment with me, <HI>I</HI> could not stand; is what <HI>I</HI> know and be∣lieve. Yea, that the least Sin <HI>I</HI> ever com∣mitted deserves the Wrath and Curse of God, both in this World, and that which is to come. But all this is general and
<PB N="32" REF="001739_0036_0FB77C84E20551F0"/>common; let me therefore, O my Soul, press the Matter close and Home. And,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Have <HI>I laid</HI> these Things to <HI>Heart?</HI> Have my Convictions been af∣fecting? Have <HI>I</HI> not only known, but felt these Things? Have <HI>I</HI> been <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> under a Sense of Sin? Have <HI>I</HI> groan'd and trembl'd under the Appre∣hension of God's Displeasure? Has <HI>De∣struction from the Lord been a Terror to</HI> me? Has <HI>my flesh trembled for fear of Him; and have I been afraid of his Judgments?</HI> Yea, have I been asham'd of Sin, as a nauseous, loathsom, filthy Thing, contra∣ry to the Nature and Law of God, and my own Happiness too; which consists in Conformity to God, and Enjoyment of him? Has the Remembrance of my Sin fill'd my Heart with Grief, and my Face with shame? Especially considering how it has been committed against a God of <HI>Infinite</HI> Love and Goodness? Does this Thought give a Peculiar Accent to my Grief, that <HI>I</HI> have sinn'd against a Blee∣ding, Dying Jesus, and a forbearing and
<PB N="33" REF="001739_0037_0FB77C89EBDDB0C8"/>forgiving God? And does the Apprehen∣sion of pardoning Mercy, thro' a Re∣deemer, promote in me the most kind∣ly Relentings? according to that, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.63.</P>
<P><HI>In the next Place;</HI> Have <HI>I</HI> been <HI>in∣fluenc'd</HI> by these Convictions to take up a hearty and Sincere <HI>Resolution</HI> of better Obedience? Do <HI>I hate every false Way?</HI> and have I a <HI>Respect to all God's Commandments?</HI> Oh! let me remember, that nothing is Repentance that consists with an Habitual Love to any Sin, or an allowed Aversion to any Instance of Du∣ty, or Branch of Holiness? Is my Heart and Life chang'd? He that is the same after Repentance as he was before, can never be accounted a true Penitent.</P>
<P>O my Conscience be faithful: Have <HI>I put off the old Man</HI> with his lusts, and <HI>put on the New Man,</HI> which <HI>after God is cre∣ated in Righteousness and true Holiness?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> hope it is thus with me, in some Measure, that tho' <HI>I</HI> offend in many Things, <HI>I</HI> allow my self in nothing, that
<PB N="34" REF="001739_0038_0FB77C8AD1CC51F8"/>God in his Word disallows. But alas! my Repentance is far short of what <HI>I</HI> know it shou'd be, and wish it were.</P>
<P><Q>Oh that He, whose Gift Repentance (as well as Faith) is, would carry on the Work which <HI>I</HI> trust, is begund Lord, open my Eyes, that <HI>I</HI> may see more of the Evil of Sin.

<P>Is thy Love to him a <HI>Rational</HI> Love, the Effect of serious Thought, and deep Conviction of his transcendent Excellen∣cy? Has the Spirit of God open'd thy Eyes, to see that He is the <HI>Chief of Ten Thousands, and altogether lovely?</HI> And

If it be thus with thee, thou mayst chearfully say, <HI>Lord, thou that knowest all Things, knowest that I love thee.</HI></P>
<P>And as a yet farther Evidence, dost thou <HI>love thy Neighbour as thy self?</HI> Hast thou a real love for all Men, and a spe∣cial, peculiar one for thy fellow Christi∣ans? Is there no Man to whom thou dost not most heartily wish well, whatever Provocations he has given thee, or Inju∣ries he has done Thee? Tho' thou hast many Enemies, has no Man an Enemy of thee? If there are those that <HI>hate</HI> thee <HI>with a cruel Hatred,</HI> canst thou appeal to God, that the Hatred is not mutual and reciprocal? Can'st thou sincerely pray, <HI>Forgive our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the People of God, dost thou honour and delight in 'em? <HI>Hereby we know that we are passed from Death to Life,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> John 3.14.</NOTE> <HI>because we love the Brethren.</HI></P>

Dost thou love every Soul where thou seest the image of Christ? Is not thy Love consin'd to those of thy own Party, or Perswasion? But is it unrestrained and large, as that Catholick Church of which thou art a Member? Does this Love en∣gage thee to all proper Acts of Kindness, and Expressions of Brotherly Love?

Why should a base Heart, and a busy Devil, make such mighty Opposition to the Work of Faith?

It would have been Matter of Suspicion, if Christ and his Disciples had preach'd nothing but what the <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers taught, and the <HI>Jewish</HI> Doc∣tors owned. And it should recommend the Doctrine of Christ to a consider∣ing unprejudic'd Mind, that it was to the <HI>Jews a Stum∣bling-Block,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1.23.</NOTE> <HI>to the Greeks Fool∣ishness.</HI></P>
<P>Are not these Things so? Come then, O my Soul, <HI>believe</HI> and be <HI>esta∣blished.</HI></P>

<P>Therefore <HI>I</HI> offer up my solemn Thanksgiving to God, that He has by his Spirit and Grace enabled me thus to Believe and Love; to Repent and Re∣solve.

<P><Q>Now, O my God, accept my Thank∣ful Acknowledgments. Let me keep a Sense of thy Love ever fresh upon my Soul.

<P>I Have been at the Table of my Lord, where He uses to meet and bless his

I went with raised Hopes that (tho' infinitely unworthy, I should have <HI>Communion with the Father,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 1.3.</NOTE> <HI>and his Son Jesus Christ;</HI> that I should be Richly entertain∣ed, and return Rejoycing: But alas how sadly am I disappointed! <HI>I came to the Pit and found no Water!</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 14.3.</NOTE> I am <HI>return'd with my Vessels empty!</HI> I am <HI>asham'd and confoun∣ded!</HI> I had prepar'd a <HI>Song of Praise,</HI> and thought to have clos'd the <HI>Festival</HI> with <HI>Hosanna's to the Son of David;</HI> but Wo is me, I am forc'd to <HI>hang my Harp upon the Willows. My Feast is turn'd into Mourning,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 8.10.</NOTE> <HI>and my Songs into Lamentation, and the End thereof as a Bitter Day.</HI> My Mind was dark, my Heart hard, my Thoughts con∣fus'd, my Affections disorder'd, my Soul and all within me utterly out of Frame; I could neither believe, nor repent, nor hope, nor love, nor do any thing as I ought to do. <HI>I</HI> try'd and struggl'd with my self in vain. <HI>I</HI> was as it were fetter'd,
<PB N="93" REF="001739_0097_0FB77DEB5D999748"/>pinion'd and becalm'd, and my very Heart asleep. In the mean Time <HI>my Enemys</HI> were <HI>lively,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 38.19.</NOTE> the Devil busy, and the World Importunate; yea Ten Thousand Trifles amusing and distracting me.</P>

I</HI> even tremble to think what a Guest <HI>I</HI> was at that Holy Table; and cannot but wonder that the Master of the Feast did not single me out and say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 22.12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Friend, how cam∣est thou in hither?</HI> That He did not say to his <HI>Servants, Bind Him Hand and Foot, and take Him away, and cast Him into outer Darkness.</HI> I am amaz'd at the Patience of God, that He could bear with such Trifling, and did not a∣waken my drowsy Soul by some terrible Judgment: That seeing the <HI>Threatning</HI> affected me no more, He did not try what the <HI>Execution</HI> would do, according

<P><HI>I</HI> adore the Divine Patience, and will not despair of Forgiveness thro' the Blood of Jesus. But <HI>I</HI> cannot <HI>for∣give</HI> my self, and am even out of all <HI>Patience</HI> when <HI>I</HI> consider how stupid <HI>I</HI> have been, and how unaccountably <HI>I</HI> have manag'd. <HI>I</HI> could wish the se∣verest Providence had detain'd me, that any thing but Sin, had prevented me from prophaning such an Ordinance, contracting so much Guilt, incurring such Danger, and creating my self so much Sorrow. But alas 'tis in vain, and perhaps unlawful, so to wish.</P>
<P>Come then, O my Soul, instead of spending Time in Fruitless Lamenta∣tions, consider seriously what the pre∣sent Circumstance makes this Duty. Humble thy self deeply before God, and <HI>entreat his Favour.</HI> See if there be any Ground of Comfort, and labour to im∣prove so sad a Disappointment (if

<P>But, O my Soul tho' there be so great Reason for Humiliation and Self-Abasement, I must not be utterly dis∣courag'd, and <HI>refuse to be comforted.</HI></P>
<P>I must hope that my Heart has been right with God, and that I have not wil∣fully prevaricated and trifled with Him;
<PB N="98" REF="001739_0102_0FB7C8CAE6252EB8"/>therefore several Circumstanees may be consider'd, to check my Fears, and mitigate my Sorrows.</P>
<P>I do not serve a <HI>Hard Master,</HI> a Kind and Gracious God can make <HI>Al∣lowancer</HI> for that Indisposition which may arise from Melancholy, or other Bodily Disorders; from extraordinary Affictions, violent Temptations, &amp;c. He <HI>considers our frame,</HI> and knows that <HI>we are but Dust,</HI> and does not expect the same from frail Mortals as he does from the <HI>Angels</HI> in Heaven, and the <HI>Spirits of Just Men made perfect.</HI> That kind Expression of my Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.41.</NOTE> <HI>The Spirit indeed is willing, but the Flesh is weak,</HI> may be us'd to comfort Real Humble Christians; tho' it be often abu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> harden the slothful and presumpt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Formalist.</P>
<P>Let me also consider that I must not always conclude an <HI>Ordinance last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> where the <HI>Affections</HI> have <HI>not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> There may be Real Communion wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="99" REF="001739_0103_0FB7C8CD038CDFE0"/>where there is not a sensible Delight. The Sacrament may be bless'd to pro∣mote Humility and Real Holiness, tho' I have wanted sensible Meltings, and desir'd Manifestations; yea, it is very possible these may be with-held on a wise Design, to carry on the Work of God in my Soul, which seems to re∣quire a Variety of Dispensations; as Wind and Rain, Frost and Darkness, are in their proper Courses equally necessary to the Earth as Calm and Sun-shine. Hereby it may be God is teaching me to live more by Faith, upon the Righteousness and Fulness of Jesus; to distrust my self more, and censure others less; to be more watch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l. humble, charitable and compassi∣onate. than ever. I may see Cause to bless God hereafter for what is so grie∣vous now.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 13.7.</NOTE> I shall never forget that Saying of my <HI>Lord</HI> to <HI>Peter, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="001739_0104_0FB7C8D4542739B8"/>
Besides, I would remember that <HI>I</HI> cannot presently judge of the Benefit of an ordinance. That which is <HI>sown, in Tears,</HI> may be <HI>reap'd with Joy,</HI> tho', at present there be but small Appearance of it. The Spiritual Medicine may gra∣dually mend my Constitution, tho' it don't operate sensibly, or prove an immediate Cure.</P>
<P>However, I have been doing my Duty, and God may accept my Ho∣nest Intentions, tho' he don't at pre∣sent smile upon me and say, <HI>Well done good and Faithful Servant.</HI></P>
<P>And after all, it's some Comfort to think that others have perform'd more acceptably, and met with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>and Peace in Believing.</HI> And I thank God for this Sign of Grace, that I can rejoyce in other's being better, and more favour'd than my self.</P>
<P>But be Things as bed as a guidty Conscience and an accusing E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> represents 'em?

<P>And now it remains that I resolve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>riously, in a better Strength than my own, to manage better for the Time to come. And 'till an Oppor∣tunity offers to make a fresh Effort, let me walk humbly under a deep Sense of my Sin; let me be more strict and circumspect in my whole Conversation, and live every Day un∣der the Awe of those <HI>Vows of God</HI> which <HI>are upon me.</HI> In an especial manner let me be careful to <HI>keep my self from Iniquity.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 18.23.</NOTE> <HI>That</HI> Sin to which by my Constitution, Business, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am most enclin'd, and with which I am most frequently <HI>overtaken.</HI> Let me be peculiarly careful to perform <HI>those</HI> Du∣tys to which I find a corrupt Heart
<PB N="102" REF="001739_0106_0FB7C8D80DD76D30"/>most averse. This will be the best way to retrieve the Loss I have sustain'd, God forbid that I should encourage my self in Future Neglects, by any Considerations whatsoever; yet I must believe that He remembers Christ in the Sacrament to the best Purpose I who under a Sense of what He has there profess'd and promis'd lives best after it: Being well assur'd that a Holy. Conversation, upon <HI>Gospel</HI> Principles and Motives, is a better E∣vidence of worthy Receiving, than all the Transports and Extasys imagina∣ble. I would not be sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy'd with∣out being <HI>affected;</HI> but surely the Principal Thing is by so apt a Means to be improv'd and <HI>better'd,</HI> to <HI>grew in Grate, and in the Knowledge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I must make it my ear∣nest and daily Prayer, that God would bless his Ordinance to this great End;
<PB N="103" REF="001739_0107_0FB7C8DA24FA08B0"/>or else my Labour will be lost, and my Expectations frustrate.</P>
<P>And Oh that he would vouchsafe his Blessing accordingly. Grant that I may never forget the Engagements I am under, but upon every Occasion remember that <HI>I am a Christian,</HI> and have solemnly own'd my self to be so <HI>before many Witnesses.</HI> That this Thought may be a Restraint from <HI>Sin,</HI> and a Spur to <HI>Duty,</HI> an Antidote against all the Poysonous <HI>Suggestions</HI> of the Grand Enemy of Souls; a Pre∣servative from the <HI>Ill Exam∣ple</HI> of those <HI>Children of Dis∣obedience in whom he rules;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2.</NOTE> and a Cordial under all the <HI>Troubles</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lictions</HI> of this Mortal Life.
