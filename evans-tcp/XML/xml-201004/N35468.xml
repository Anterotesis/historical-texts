<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>PHILIPPI was so called from <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> who much enlarged and beautified it. Afterwards it became a <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Colony, and the chief City of that Part of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> Hither St. <HI>Paul</HI> was sent by a Vision to preach; and here, not long after his Coming, he was shamefully intreated. Nevertheless many were converted by him, during the short Time of his Abode there; by whose Liberality he was more assisted, than by any other Church of his planting. And they had now sent large Assistance to him by <HI>Epaphroditus;</HI> by whom he returns them this Epistle.</P>

<HEAD>PHILIPPIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<P>PAUL and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> with the bishops and deacons, Grace <HI>be</HI> unto you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> I thank my God upon every mention of you,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> For your fellow∣ship in the gospel from the first day until now: Being persuaded of this very thing,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> that he who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect <HI>it</HI> un∣til the day of Jesus Christ,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> As it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, who were all partakers of my grace, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation
<PB N="5" REF="046353_0005_10210E4AF8709FA8"/>of the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> For God is my witness, how I long for you all,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> with the bowers of Jesus Christ. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in all knowledge and <HI>in</HI> all <HI>spiritual</HI> sense, That ye may try the things that are excellent,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> that ye may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Being filled with the fruits of righte∣ousness, which are through Christ Jesus, to the glory and praise of God.</P>
<P>Now I would have you know,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> brethren, that the things concerning me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:
<MILESTONE N="13"/> So that my bonds in Christ have been made manifest in the
<PB N="6" REF="046353_0006_10210E44E5E8DD50"/>whole palace,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> and to all others: And many of the brethren trusting in the Lord through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word with∣out fear.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"/> Some indeed preach Christ even through envy and strife;
<MILESTONE N="16"/> but some through good will. The one preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, sup∣posing to add affliction to my bonds:
<MILESTONE N="17"/> But the o∣thers out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> What then? still every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ:
<MILESTONE N="20"/> According to my earnest expect∣ation and hope, that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but that with all boldness, as always, <HI>so</HI> now also, Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</P>
<P>For to me to live <HI>is</HI> Christ,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> and to die <HI>is</HI> gain.
<PB N="7" REF="046353_0007_10210E4CC41F5028"/>But if <HI>I am</HI> to live in the flesh,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> this <HI>is</HI> the fruit of my labour, and what I should chuse, I know not. For I am in a strait between two,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, <HI>which is</HI> far better. But to remain in the flesh <HI>is</HI> more needful for you.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And being persuaded of this,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your further∣ance and joy of faith:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> That your rejoicing for me may abound through Christ Jesus, by my pre∣sence with you again.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Only let your behaviour be worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear concern∣ing you, that ye stand fast, in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel, And in nothing terrified by your adversaries,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> This also <HI>is</HI> of God. For to you it is given with regard to Christ, not only to believe on him,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> but also to suffer for him: Having the same conflict, which ye saw in me, and now
<PB N="8" REF="046353_0008_10210E496C6DA070"/>hear <HI>to be</HI> in me.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>If <HI>there be</HI> then any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> if any bowels of mercies; Fulfil ye my joy, that ye think the same thing, having the same love,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> being of one soul, of one mind. <HI>Do</HI> nothing through strife or vain glory, but in lowli∣ness of mind, esteem each the others better than themselves.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Aim not every one at his own things, but every one also at the things of others.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, Who being in the form of God,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> counted it no act of robbery to be equal with God;
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Yet emptied him∣self,
<PB N="9" REF="046353_0009_10210E4F766FC2B0"/>taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> yea, the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above every name,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> That at the name of Jesus every knee might bow, of those in heaven, and those on earth, and those under the earth:
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And every tongue might confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father. Wherefore,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> my beloved, as you have always obey∣ed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation
<PB N="10" REF="046353_0010_10210E54B2F55578"/>with fear and trembling.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For it is God that worketh in you according to his good pleasure, both to will and to do.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
<MILESTONE N="15"/> That ye may be blameless and simple, the sons of God, unrebuk∣able, in the midst of a crooked and perverse genera∣tion, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, Holding fast the word of life,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> that I may glory in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nei∣ther laboured in vain.</P>
<P>Yea,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> and if I be offered up on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate you all.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> For the same cause rejoice ye likewise, and congratulate me.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Now I trust in the Lord Jesus, to send Timotheus to you thortly, that I also may be encouraged,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> when I know your state, For I have none like-minded, who will naturally care for what concerneth you.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> For all seek their own, not the
<PB N="11" REF="046353_0011_10210E59E70691F0"/>things of Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with his father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Him therefore I hope to send, as soon as ever I know how it will go with me.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and com∣panion in labour and fellow-soldier, but your mes∣senger,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> and him that ministered to my need. For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he was sick.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> He was indeed sick nigh unto death; but God had com∣passion on him; and not on him only, but on me likewise, left I should have sorrow upon sorrow. I have sent him therefore the more willingly,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> that ye seeing him again my rejoice, and that I also may be the less sorrowful.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and honour such. Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> not regarding his own life, to supply your deficiency of service toward me.</P>

<MILESTONE N="11"/> If by any means I may attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

<P>Therefore, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <HI>my</HI> beloved.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> to be of one mind in the Lord. And I intreat thee also, true yoke-fellow, help those wo∣men who laboured together with me in the Gospel, with both Clement and my other fellow-labourers, whose names <HI>are</HI> in the book of life.</P>
<P>Rejoice in the Lord always:
<MILESTONE N="4"/> again, I say, re∣joice.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Let your gentleness be known to all men; the Lord <HI>is</HI> at hand.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanks∣giving, let your requests be made known to God:
<PB N="16" REF="046353_0016_10210E6AEAB3E668"/>And the peace of God,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> which surpasseth all under∣standing, shall keep your hearts and your minds through Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Finally,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <HI>are</HI> honest, whatsoever things <HI>are</HI> just, whatsoever things <HI>are</HI> pure, whatsoever things <HI>are</HI> lovely, whatsoever things <HI>are</HI> of good report: if <HI>there be</HI> any virtue, and if <HI>there be</HI> any praise, think on these things:
<MILESTONE N="9"/> The things which ye have both learned and received, and heard and seen in me, these do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="046353_0017_10210E6C88BA4C78"/>
<P>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> that now at last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful; but ye wanted opportunity. Not that I speak in respect of want;
<MILESTONE N="11"/> for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know how to be abased,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and I know how to a∣bound, every where and in every thing I am in∣structed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to want.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Nevertheless, ye have done well, that ye did communicate to me in my affliction.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And ye know likewise, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I depart∣ed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in respect of giving and receiving but you only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessities.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> <MILESTONE N="17"/> Not that I desire a gift, but I de∣sire fruit that may abound to your account.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having
<PB N="18" REF="046353_0018_10210E73517C4D98"/>received of Epaphroditus the things <HI>which came</HI> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, an acceptable sacrifice,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> well pleasing to God. And my God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory through Christ Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Now unto our God and Father <HI>be</HI> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
<P>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> The bre∣thren who are with me salute you.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> All the saints sa∣lute you, chiefly they that are of Cesar's houshold. <MILESTONE N="23"/> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>be</HI> with you all.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES ON St. PAUL'S Epistle to the <HI>Colossians.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P><HI>COLOSSE</HI> was a City of the <HI>Greater Phrygia,</HI> not far from <HI>La∣odicéa</HI> and <HI>Hierápolis.</HI> Though St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached in many Parts of <HI>Phrygia,</HI> yet he never had been at this City. It had re∣ceived the Gospel by the preaching of <HI>Epaphras,</HI> who was with St. <HI>Paul</HI> when he wrote this Epistle.</P>
<P>It seems the <HI>Colossians</HI> were now in Danger of being seduced by those who strove to blend Judaism or Heathen Superstitions with Christianity: Pretending, that GOD, because of his great Majesty, was not to be approached but by the Mediation of Angels: And that there were certain Rites and Observances chiefly borrowed from the Law, whereby these Angels might be made our Friends.</P>
<P>In Opposition to them the Apostle, 1. Commends the Knowledge of <HI>Christ,</HI> as more excellent than all other, and so entire and perfect, that no other Knowledge was necessary for a Christian. He 2. shews, That <HI>Christ</HI> is above all Angels, who are only his Servants; and that being reconciled to GOD through Him, we have free Access to him in all our Necessities.</P>

<P> PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> and Timotheus a brother, To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colosse, grace <HI>be</HI> unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> (praying always for you, Hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and of your love to all the saints) For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> of which ye heard before in the word of truth,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> of the gospel, Which is come to you, as also <HI>it is</HI> in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as <HI>it hath done</HI> likewise among you, from the day ye heard <HI>it,</HI> and knew the grace of God in truth: As ye likewise learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> who is a faithful minister of Christ
<PB N="21" REF="046353_0022_10210E7946500720"/>for you:
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For this cause from the day we heard <HI>it,</HI> we do not cease to pray also for you, and to desire that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
<MILESTONE N="10"/> That ye may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to partake of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and hath translated <HI>us</HI> into the kingdom of his be∣loved Son.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> In whom we have redemption through his blood,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-begotten of
<PB N="22" REF="046353_0023_10210E7AE9277A08"/>every creature.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> For through him were created all things, that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible; whether <HI>they be</HI> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And he is before all things,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> and by him all things consist, And he is the head of his body the church: who is the be∣ginning, the first-begotten from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For it pleased <HI>the Father,</HI> that all fulness should dwell in him:
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And by him to reconcile all things to him∣self (having made peace by him, through the blood of the cross) whether things on earth, or
<PB N="23" REF="046353_0024_10210E829BABD108"/>things in heaven.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And you that were one alie∣nated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, he hath now reconciled,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> By the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy, and spotless, and unreproveable in his sight:
<MILESTONE N="23"/> If ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and are not removed from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, which is preached to every creature that is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister. Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> and fill up in my flesh that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ for his body,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> which is the church: Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you, fully to preach the word of God:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> The mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations; but
<PB N="24" REF="046353_0025_10210E8425625BB8"/>now is manifested to his saints:
<MILESTONE N="27"/> To whom among the Gentiles it was the will of God to make known, what is the riches of this glorious mystery, which is Christ in you,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> the hope of glory: Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching eve∣ry man with all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect through Christ Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="29"/> For which also I labour, striving according to his mighty working, who worketh in me mightily.</P>

<MILESTONE N="6"/> for your sake. And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> with joy of the Holy Ghost. So that ye

<MILESTONE N="8"/> For from you the word of the Lord sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith toward God went abroad inevery place also,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> so that we need not speak any thing. For they themselves declare concerning us, what manner of en∣trance to you we had, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> turned from idols to God,

<P>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> that it was not in vain: But even after we had suffered before, and had been shamefully treated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention. For our exhortation <HI>is</HI> not of deceit,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> nor of unclean∣ness,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> nor in guile. But as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who trieth our hearts. For neither at any time used we flattering words,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness: God is witness:
<PB N="35" REF="046353_0036_10210EA81243C418"/>Nor sought we glory of men,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdensome, as the Apostles of Christ.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> But we were gentle in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her own children.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own souls also,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> because ye were dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Ye <HI>are</HI> wit∣nesses, and God, how hostly and justly and unblamea∣bly we behaved among you that believe:
<MILESTONE N="11"/> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his own children.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For this cause also thank we God with∣out ceasing, <HI>even</HI> because when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received <HI>it,</HI> not <HI>as</HI> the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewise effectually worketh in you that believe.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Christ Jesus, which are in Judea: for ye also suffered the same things from your own countrymen,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> as they likewise from the Jews: Who
<PB N="36" REF="046353_0037_10210EAD29F91A18"/>both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God, and are contrary to all men;
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: but wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</P>
<P>But we,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> brethren, being taken from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, laboured with great desire the more abundantly to see your face.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> but Satan hindered us. For what is our hope,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not ye also before our Lord Jesus at his appearing?</P>

<P>For ye are our glory and joy. Therefore when we could bear no longer, we thought good to be left at Athens alone,

<P>It remaineth then, brethren, that we beseech and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, that ye abound <HI>therein</HI> more and more.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For ye know what
<PB N="38" REF="046353_0039_10210EB50D818500"/>commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> For this is the will of God, <HI>even</HI> your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;
<MILESTONE N="4"/> That every one of you know <HI>how</HI> to possess his vessel in sanctification and ho∣nour;
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Not in passionate desire, as the Gentiles who know not God.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> That <HI>none</HI> circumvent or defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an a∣venger of all these things, as we have also told you before and testified.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For God hath not called us to uncleanness,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> but to holiness. He therefore that de∣spiseth, despiseth not man but God; who hath also given you his Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Touching brotherly love,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> we need not write to you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one ano∣ther.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia; but we exhort you, bre∣thren,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> that ye increase more and more, And that ye
<PB N="39" REF="046353_0040_10210EB89E9FBCA8"/>study to be quiet and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you; That ye may walk decently toward them that are without,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and may want nothing.</P>
<P>Now we would not have you ignorant,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so will God bring with him those also that sleep in Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are lest to the appearing of the Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Then we who are alive, who are lest, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.

<P>But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write to you.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> When they say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. But ye,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Ye are all children of the light and children of the day: we are not <HI>chil∣dren</HI> of the night,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep as the others, but let us awake and keep awake.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But let us who are of the day keep awake, having put on the breast-plate of faith and love, and for an hel∣met the hope of salvation.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For God hath not ap∣pointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we may live together with him. Wherefore comfort one another and edify one another,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> as also ye do.</P>
<P>Now we beseech you,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the
<PB N="41" REF="046353_0042_10210EC1D4AAA640"/>Lord,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and admonish you, And to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, <HI>and</HI> be at peace among yourselves.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And we exhort you, brethren, warn the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, sup∣port the weak, be long suffering toward all men. See that none render to any man evil for evil,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> but ever follow that which is good, both to one another and to all men.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> ,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Rejoice evermore: Pray with∣out ceasing:
<MILESTONE N="18"/> In every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> ,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Despise not prophesyings.
<PB N="42" REF="046353_0043_10210EC3F47ABCF8"/>Prove all things;
<MILESTONE N="21"/> hold fast that which is good.</P>
<P>Abstain from all appearance of evil.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> ,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and may the whole of you, the spirit and the soul and the body, be preserved blameless unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do <HI>it.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="25"/><MILESTONE N="26"/> Brethren, pray for us. Sa∣lute all the brethren with an holy kiss.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> I adjure you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>be</HI> with you. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES ON The First Epistle of St. PAUL to <HI>Timothy.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>THE Mother of <HI>Timothy</HI> was a Jewess, but his Father was a Gentile. He was converted to Christianity very early; and while he was yet but a Youth, was taken by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to assist him in the Work of the Gospel, chiefly in watering the Churches which he had planted.</P>
<P>He was therefore properly (as was <HI>Titus</HI>) an itinerant Evangelist, a kind of secondary Apostle, whose Office was, to regulate all Things in the Churches to which he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and to inspect and reform whatsoever was amiss either in the Bishops, Deacons, or People.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> had doubtless largely instructed him in private Conversa∣tion for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Execution of so weighty an Office. Yet to six Things more upon his Mind, and to give him an Opportunity of having Re∣course to them afterward, and of communicating them to others, as there might be Occasion; as also to leave Divine Directions in Writ∣ing, for the Use of the Church and its Ministers in all Ages, he sent him this excellent Pastoral Letter, which contains a great Variety of important Sentiments for their Regulation.</P>
<P>Though St. <HI>Paul</HI> stiles him his <HI>own s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in the faith,</HI> yet he does not appear to have been converted by the Apostle; but only to have been exceeding dear to him, who had established him therein; and whom he had diligently and faithfully <HI>served, like a son with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fa∣ther in the Gospel.

<MILESTONE N="4"/> Neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that afford questions, and not godly edifying, which is through faith.

<MILESTONE N="6"/> From which some, having missed the mark,

<MILESTONE N="12"/> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, in that he accounted me faithful,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> having put me into the ministry, Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecuter, and an oppressor; but I obtained mercy, because I did <HI>it</HI> ignorantly in unbelief.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came in∣to the world to save sinners of whom I am chief.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Yet for this cause I obtained mercy, that on me the chief, Jesus Christ might shew all long-suffering, for a pat∣tern to them who should hereafter believe in him to life everlasting.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> Now to the king of eternity, im∣mortal,
<PB N="53" REF="046353_0054_10210EEBD2521810"/>invisible, the only God, <HI>be</HI> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
<P>This charge I commit to thee,

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P> PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life, which is by Christ Jesus,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> To Timotheus my beloved son, grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.</P>
<P>I thank God,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> whom I serve from <HI>my</HI> forefathers with a pure conscience, that I have remembrance of thee in my prayers without ceasing night and day, Longing to see thee,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Remembering the unfeign∣ed faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grand∣mother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; I am persuad∣ed in thee also.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Wherefore I remind thee of stir∣ring up the gift of God which is in thee, by the lay∣ing on of my hands.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and so∣briety.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Therefore be not thou ashamed of the testi∣mony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be
<PB N="69" REF="046353_0070_10210F2AF1F62170"/>thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, accord∣ing to the power of God,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Who hath saved and call∣ed us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began;
<MILESTONE N="10"/> But is now made manifest, by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light thro' the gospel:
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. For which cause also I suffer these things:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> yet I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have trusted, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> until that day. Hold fast the pattern of sound words, which thou hast heard from me,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. The good thing which is committed to thee keep, through the Holy Spirit,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> who dwelleth in us. This thou knowest, that all who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermo∣genes.
<PB N="70" REF="046353_0071_10210F2E877AA470"/>
<MILESTONE N="16"/> The Lord give mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he hath often refreshed me, and hath not been ashamed of my chain:
<MILESTONE N="17"/> But when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found <HI>me.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="18"/> The Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day: And in how many things he served me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</P>

<P>Thou therefore, my son, be strong through the grace which is by Christ Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And the things which thou hast heard from me before many witnesses, these commit to saithful men, who will be able to teach others also.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Thou therefore endure affliction, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> No man that war∣reth intangleth himself in the affairs of <HI>this</HI> life, that he may please him who hath enlisted <HI>him.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And if a man strive, he is not crowned, unless he strive lawfully.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> The husbandman, that laboureth first, must be partaker of the fruits.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. Remember Jesus Christ of the feed of David,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> raised from the dead according to my gospel;
<MILESTONE N="9"/> For which I endure affliction even unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God is not bound.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Therefore I suffer all
<PB N="71" REF="046353_0072_10210F3014A47450"/>things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is through Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> <HI>It is</HI> a faithful saying; if we are dead with <HI>him,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="12"/> we shall also live with <HI>him:</HI> If we suffer, we shall also reign with <HI>him:</HI> if we deny <HI>him,</HI> he will also deny us:
<MILESTONE N="13"/> If we believe not, he remaineth saith∣ful; he cannot deny himself.</P>
<P>Remind <HI>them</HI> of these things,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> charging <HI>them</HI> be∣fore the Lord, not to strive about words to no profit, <HI>but</HI> to the subverting of the hearers.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Be diligent to present thyself unto God approved, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> But avoid profane empty babblings; for they will increase to more ungodliness,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And their word will eat as a gangrene; of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Who have erred concerning the truth, say∣ing, The resurrection is already past, and overthrow the faith of some.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But the foundation of God stand∣eth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth those that are his: and, Let every one who nameth the
<PB N="72" REF="046353_0073_10210F3272863440"/>name of the Lord depart from iniquity.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, consecrated and fit for the master's use, prepared for every good work.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Flee also youthful desires; but follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace with them that call upon the Lord, out of a pure heart. But avoid foolish and unlearned questions,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> knowing that they beget strifes:
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And a servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle toward all men, apt to teach patient of evil,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if haply God may give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth;
<MILESTONE N="26"/> And they may awake out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>TITUS was converted from Heathenism by St. <HI>Paul, Gal.</HI> ii. 3. and as it seems very early, since the Apostle accounted him as his Brother, at his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> going into <HI>Macedonia.</HI> And he managed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Churches there, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought not good to go thither himself. He had now left him at <HI>Crete,</HI> to regulate the Churches; to assist him wherein, he wrote this Epistle, as is gene∣rally believed, after the First, and before the Second to <HI>Timothy.</HI> The Tenor and Stile are much alike in this and in those, and they cast much Light on each other; and are worthy the serious Attenti∣on of all Christian Ministers and Churches in all Ages.</P>

<P> PAUL, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timo∣theus a brother, to Philemon the beloved
<PB N="87" REF="046353_0088_10210F699857B850"/>and our fellow-labourer,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And to the beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church which is in thy house:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Grace <HI>be</HI> unto you, and peace from God our father, and the Lord Je∣sus Christ.</P>
<P>I thank my God,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> making mention of thee al∣ways in my prayers,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> (Hearing of thy faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and love toward all saints) That the communication of thy faith may become effectual,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you towards Christ Jesus.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are re∣freshed by thee,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> brother. Wherefore, though I might be very bold in Christ, to enjoin thee what is convenient.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Yet out of love I rather intreat <HI>thee,</HI> being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ:
<MILESTONE N="10"/> I intreat thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bonds. On<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sunus,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Who was formerly unprofitable to thee,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> but now profitable to thee and me, Whom I
<PB N="88" REF="046353_0089_10210F6BD26EB060"/>have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> my own bowels: Whom I was desirous to have retained with me, to serve me in thy stead, in the bonds of the gospel.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> But I would do nothing with∣out thy consent; that thy benefit might not be, as it were,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> by constraint, but willingly. And perhaps for this end was he separated for a season, that thou mightest have him for ever;
<MILESTONE N="16"/> No longer as a ser∣vant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, espe∣cially to me; and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?
<MILESTONE N="17"/> If therefore thou accountest me a partner, receive him as myself. If he hath wronged thee,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> or oweth <HI>thee</HI> any thing, put that to my account.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> I Paul have written with my own hand; I will repay <HI>it;</HI> not to say unto thee, that thou owest also thyself to me besides. Yea,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Having confidence of thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Withal pre∣pare me also a lodging; for I trust I shall be given to you through your prayers.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Epaphras my fel∣low-prisoner in Christ Jesus saluteth you,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-labourers, <MILESTONE N="25"/> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>be</HI> with your spirit.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES ON The Epistle to the HEBREWS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>IT is agreed by the general Tenor of Antiquity, that this Epistle was written by St. <HI>Paul;</HI> whose other Epistles were sent to the Gentile Converts: This only to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> But this improper Inscription was added by some later Hand. It was sent to the Jewish <HI>Uel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nist Christians,</HI> dispersed through various Countries. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Method and Stile are easily observed therein. He places, as usual, the Proposition and Division before the Treatise; (c. ii. 7.) He subjoins the Exhortatory to the Doctrinal Part; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otes the same Scriptures, c. ii. 8. c. x. 30, 38. c. i. 6.) and uses the same Expres∣sions as elsewhere. But why does he not prefix his Name, which it is plain, from c. iii. 19, was dear to them to whom he wrote? Because he prefixes no Inscription, in which, it at all, the Name would have been mentioned. The Ardor of his Spirit carries him directly upon his Subject, (just like St. <HI>John</HI> in his first Epistle) and throws bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his usual Salutation and Thanksgiving to the Conclu∣sion.</P>
<P>This Epistle of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and both those of St. <HI>Peter</HI> (one may add, That of S. <HI>James</HI> and of St. <HI>Jude</HI> also) were written both to the same Persons, dispersed through <HI>Pontus, Galatia,</HI> and other Coun∣tries, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arly at the same Time. St. <HI>Paul</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <HI>Rome,</HI> three Years before the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Therefore this Epistle likewise was written, while the Temple was standing. St. <HI>Peter</HI> wrote a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before his Martyrdom, and refers to the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in particular.</P>
<P>The Scope of it is, To confirm, their Faith in <HI>Christ.</HI> And this he does, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> demonstrating his Glory. All the Parts of it are full of the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and pointed Admonitions and Exhortations. And they go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in one Tenor, the Particle <HI>Therefore</HI> every where con∣necting the Doctrine and the Use.</P>

<P>There are many Comparisons in this Epistle, which may be nearly reduced to Two Heads, 1. The Prophets, the Angels, Moses, Joshua, Aaron are great; but <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is infinitely greater: 2. The an∣cient Believers enjoyed high Privileges; but Christian Believers en∣joy far higher. To illustrate this, Examples both of Happiness and Misery are every where interspersed: So that in this Epistle there is a Kind of Recapitulation of the whole Old Testament. In this also Judaism is abrogated and Christianity carried to its Height.</P>

<MILESTONE N="7"/> He again, af∣ter so long a time, fixeth a certain day, saying by David, To-day; as it was said before, To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. For if Joshua had given them the rest,

<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>For this Melchisedek King of Salem, priest of the most high God,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> xiv. 18, &amp;c.@</NOTE> who met Abraham return∣ing from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> To whom also Abraham divided a tenth part
<PB N="109" REF="046353_0110_10210FBFA033F520"/>of all <HI>the spoils;</HI> being, by interpretation, first, king of righteousness, and then king of Salem also, which is king of peace;
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having neither begin∣ning of days, nor end of life, but being made like the son of God, remaineth a priest continually. Now consider how great this man <HI>was,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="4"/> to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And verily they of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a com∣mandment (according to the law) to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But he whose pedigree is not from them, took tithes of A∣braham, and blessed him who had the promises: And without all contradiction,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> the less is blessed of the greater.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And here men that die receive
<PB N="110" REF="046353_0111_10210FC1D922D850"/>tithes: but there, he, of whom it is testified that he liveth.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes (so to speak) through Abraham.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchise∣dek met him.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Now if perfection had been by the Levitical Priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need <HI>was there</HI> that another priest should rise, after the order of Mel∣chisedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> there is also necessarily a change of the law.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For he, of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man attended on the altar.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> For <HI>it is</HI> evident, that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And it is still sar more evident, that another priest is raised up, after the likeness of
<PB N="111" REF="046353_0112_10210FC714079040"/>Melchisedek,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Who was made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life;
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For it is testified, Thou <HI>art</HI> a priest for ever,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> after the order of Melchisedek. For verily there is a disannulling of the preceding com∣mandment, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <HI>did,</HI> by which we draw nigh to God.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And in as much as <HI>he was not made a priest</HI> without an oath:
<MILESTONE N="21"/> (For those <HI>priests</HI> were made without an oath, but this with an oath, by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <HI>art</HI> a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek:)
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Of so much better a covenant was Jesus made a surety.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And they tru∣ly were many priests, because they were hindered by death from continuing.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But this, because he
<PB N="112" REF="046353_0113_10210FC9C3271930"/>continueth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not away.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost, who come to God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
<MILESTONE N="26"/> For such an high-priest suited us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Who needeth not daily, as those high-priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people; for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> For the law maketh men high-priests that have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <HI>maketh</HI> the son, who is consecrated for evermore.</P>

<P>And verily the first <HI>covenant</HI> also had ordinan∣ces of worship and a worldly sanctuary.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For the first tabernacle was prepared, in which <HI>was</HI> the candlestick, and the table, and the shew-bread; which is cailed The holy <HI>place.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And beyond the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called The holy of holies,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Having the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, overlaid round about with gold, wherein <HI>was</HI> a golden pot having the manna, and Aaron's rod that blossomed, and the tables of the covenant:
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And over it <HI>were</HI> the Cherubim of glory, shadowing the mercy-seat; of which we
<PB N="116" REF="046353_0117_102107C537E088F0"/>cannot now speak particularly.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Now these things being thus prepared, the priests go always into the first tabernacle,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> accomplishing their services. But into the second, only the high-priest, once a year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself and the errors of the people:
<MILESTONE N="8"/> The Holy Ghost evidently shewing this, that the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest, while the first taberna∣cle was still subsisting,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Which <HI>is</HI> a figure for the time present, in which are offered both gifts and sacrifices, which cannot perfect the worshipper as to <HI>his</HI> conscience,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Only with meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, impos∣ed till the time of reformation.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> But Christ be∣ing come, an high-priest of good things to come, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, And not by the blood of goats and calves,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> but by his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption <HI>for us.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="046353_0118_10210FDAB46FBC90"/>For if the blood of bulis and goats,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> xix. 17, 18, 19.@</NOTE> ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
<MILESTONE N="14"/> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And for this end he is the Mediator of the new covenant, that by means of death for the re∣demption of the transgressions that <HI>were</HI> under the first covenant, they who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
<MILESTONE N="16"/> For where <HI>such</HI> a covenant <HI>is,</HI> there must also necessarily be the death of him by whom the covenant is con∣firmed.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For the covenant is of force after he is
<PB N="118" REF="046353_0119_10210FDD438419C8"/>dead; whereas it is of no strength while he by whom it is confirmed liveth.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Whence neither was the first <HI>covenant</HI> originally transacted without blood.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> For when Moses had spoken all the com∣mandment according to the law to all the people
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxiv. 7, 8.@</NOTE>, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and the book itself,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> and sprinkled all the people, Saying,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ver. 8.@</NOTE> This <HI>is</HI> the blood of the covenant, which God hath on-joined joined unto you.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And in like manner he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> And almost all things are according to the law purified with blood, and without shed∣ding of blood there is no forgiveness.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> <HI>It was</HI> there∣fore necessary, that the patterns of things in hea∣ven should be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these.
<PB N="119" REF="046353_0120_10210FE3F7EBB450"/>For Christ did not enter into the holy place made with hands,
<MILESTONE N="24"/> the figure of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Nor <HI>did he enter,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="25"/> that he might offer himself often (as the high-priest entered into the holy place every year with the blood of others) For then he must often have suffered since the foundation of the world:
<MILESTONE N="26"/> but now once at the consummation of the ages hath he been manifested, to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> And as it is appointed for men once to die, and after this the Judgment: So Christ also,
<MILESTONE N="28"/> having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear the second time, without sin, to them that look for him, unto sal∣vation.</P>

<P>Now faith is the subsistence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And by it the elders obtained a <HI>good</HI> testimony.

<PB N="125" REF="046353_0124_10210FE7764AB268"/>were made of things which do not appear.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacti∣fice than Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it,

<MILESTONE N="6"/> But without faith <HI>it is</HI> impossible to please <HI>him;</HI> for he that cometh to God, must be∣lieve that he is, and <HI>that</HI> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his hous∣hold, by which he condemned the world, and be∣came heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

<P>Wherefore, let us also, being encompassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which easily besetteth <HI>us,</HI> and run with patience the race that is set before us,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of <HI>our</HI> faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right∣hand of the throne of God.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> For consider him that endured such contradiction from sinners against him∣self,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> lest ye be weary and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. And yet ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh to you as to sons,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> iii. 11, &amp;c.@</NOTE> My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he re∣ceiveth.
<PB N="131" REF="046353_0130_10210FFC109E41D8"/>If ye endure chastening,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not?
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But if ye are without chasten∣ing, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Now if we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we reverenced <HI>them:</HI> Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the father of spirits and live?
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For they, verily, for a few days chastened <HI>us</HI> as they thought good: but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness. Now all chastening for the present is assuredly not joyous,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> but grievous; yet afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them that are ex∣ercised thereby.</P>
<P>Wherefore
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Is.</HI> xxxv. 3.@</NOTE> Lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees;

<MILESTONE N="17"/> For ye know that afterward, even when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.</P>
<P>For ye are not come to the mountain that could be touched,

<P>JAMES a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</P>
<P>My brethren,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> count it all joy, when ye fall in∣to divers temptations,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> But let patience have <HI>its</HI> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> If any of you want wis∣dom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea,
<PB N="140" REF="046353_0139_1021101E2F0B55C0"/>driven with the wind and tossed.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
<MILESTONE N="10"/> But the rich, in that he is made low; because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> For the sun arose with a scorch∣ing heat, and withered the grass, and the flower fell off, and the beauty of its form perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Happy <HI>is</HI> the man that endureth temptation:
<MILESTONE N="12"/> for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Let no man who is tempted say, I am tempted of God a for God cannot be tempted with evil,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by
<PB N="141" REF="046353_0140_10211020021979C0"/>his own desire and inticed.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Then desire having conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin being per∣fected, bringeth forth death.</P>
<P>Do not err,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> descend∣ing from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</P>
<P>Wherefore,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
<PB N="142" REF="046353_0141_10211021DD684260"/>
<MILESTONE N="20"/> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteous∣ness of God.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Therefore laying aside all the filthi∣ness and superfluity of wickedness, receive with meekness the ingrafted word which is able to save your souls.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only,
<MILESTONE N="23"/> deceiving yourselves. For if any one be an hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> For he beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> But he that looketh diligently into the per∣fect law, <HI>the law</HI> of liberty, and continueth <HI>therein,</HI> this man being not a forgetful hearer, but a doet of the work, this man shall be happy in his doing. If any one be ever so religious,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this
<PB N="143" REF="046353_0142_10211025AFD21890"/>man's religion is vain.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Pure religion and undefiled before God even the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <HI>and</HI> to keep himself unspotted from the world.</P>

<P>My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>the Lord</HI> of glory, with respect of per∣sons.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For if there come unto your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there come in also a poor man in dirty raiment,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And ye look upon him that weareth the fine apparel, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Ye distinguish not in your selves, but are become evil-reasoning judges. Hearken,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> my beloved brethren. Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
<PB N="144" REF="046353_0143_10211028A90DDF58"/>them that love him?
<MILESTONE N="6"/> But ye have disgraced the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the judgment-seats?
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called?
<MILESTONE N="8"/> If ye fulfil the royal law (according to the Scripture)
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lev.</HI> xix. 18.@</NOTE> Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> ye do well. But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being con∣victed by the law
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxiii. 3.@</NOTE> as transgressors.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> For whoso∣ever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> is become guilty of all; For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, do not commit murder. If then thou commit no adultery, yet if thou commit murder, thou art become a transgres∣sor of the law.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> So speak ye and so act, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For judgment without mercy <HI>shall be</HI> to him that hath shewed no mercy: but mercy glorieth over judgment.</P>
<P>What doth it profit,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can
<PB N="145" REF="046353_0144_1021102A6C5BA2F8"/><HI>that</HI> faith save him?
<MILESTONE N="15"/> If a brother or a sister be na∣ked,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> and want daily food, And one of you say to them, Depart in peace; be ye warmed and fil∣led, but give them not the things needful for the body,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> what doth it profit? So likewise faith, if it hath not works,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> is dead in itself. But one will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> Thou believest there is one God: thou dost well: the devils also be∣lieve and tremble.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> But art thou willing to know O empty man, that the faith <HI>which is</HI> without
<PB N="146" REF="046353_0145_1021102CB600E3E0"/>works is dead?
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Thou feest that faith wrought together with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And the scripture was ful∣filled which faith,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> xv. 6. 2 <HI>chron.</HI> xx. 7.@</NOTE> Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Ye see then, that a man
<PB N="147" REF="046353_0146_1021103428EBA1B8"/>is justified by works,
<MILESTONE N="25"/> and not by faith only. In like manner was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works, having received the messengers, and sent them out another way?

On another Occasion St. <HI>James</HI> himself pleaded the Cause of Faith (<HI>Acts</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 13-21) And St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself strenuously pleads for Works, par∣ticularly in his latter Epistles.

But in other Parts of the Argu∣ment the Apostle speaks of a dead, imaginary Faith. He does not therefore teach, that true Faith <HI>can,</HI> but that it <HI>cannot</HI> subsist with∣out Works. Nor does he oppose Faith to Works, but that empty Name of Faith, to real Faith working by Love, <HI>Can that faith which is without works save him?</HI> No more than it can profit his Neighbour.</P>

<P>Blessed <HI>be</HI> the God and Father of our Lord Je∣sus Christ,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> who, according to his abundant mer∣cy, hath regenerated us to a living hope, by the

<MILESTONE N="4"/> To an in∣heritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> reserved in heaven for you, Who are kept by the power of God thro' faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> Wherein ye great∣ly rejoice, though now for a little while (if need be) ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: That the trial of your faith,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> <HI>which is</HI> much more precious than gold, (that perisheth though it be tried with fire) may be found unto praise, and ho∣nour, and glory, at the revelation of Jesus Christ, Whom having not seen,

<PB N="159" REF="046353_0158_1021105B73E9A858"/>with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls. Of which salvation the prophets,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> who prophesied of the grace <HI>of God</HI> toward you, enquired and search∣ed diligently,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Searching what, and what man∣ner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them signified, when he testified before hand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that were to fol∣low.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> To whom it was revealed, that not for themselves, but for us they ministered the things which have been now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven: which things angels de∣sire to look into.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be watchful and hope perfectly for the grace that shall be brought to you at the reve∣lation

<MILESTONE N="18"/> Seeing ye know ye were not re∣deemed with corruptible things, <HI>as</HI> silver and gold, from your vain conversation delivered by tradition from your fathers,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Who verily was foreknown before the foun∣dation of the world, but was manifested in the last times for you,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> Who through him believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 2.</LABEL> <HI>According to the foreknowledge of</HI> GOD—Speaking after the Manner of Men. Strictly speaking there is no <HI>foreknowledge,</HI> no more than <HI>after-knowledge</HI> with GOD: But all Things are <HI>known</HI> to him as <HI>present,</HI> from Eternity to Eternity. This is therefore no other than an Instance of the divine Condescension to our low Capa∣cities. <HI>Elect</HI>—By the free Love and Almighty Power of GOD taken out of, separated from the World. <HI>Election,</HI> in the Scripture Sense, <PB N="157" REF="046353_0156_102107CC9C668DB8"/> is GOD's doing any thing that our Merit or Power have no Part in. The true Predestination, or Fore-appointment of GOD is, 1. He that believeth shall be saved, from the Guilt and Power of Sin. 2. He that endureth to the End, shall be saved eternally. 3. They who receive the precious Gift of Faith, thereby become the Sons of GOD: And being Sons, they shall receive the Spirit of Holiness, to walk as <HI>Christ</HI> also walked. Throughout every Part of this Appointment of GOD, <HI>Promise</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> go Hand in Hand. All is free Gift; and yet such is the Gift, that the final Issue depends on our future Obe∣dience to the heavenly Call. But other Predestination than this, either to Life or Death eternal, the Scripture knows not of. More∣over, it is, 1. Cruel Respect of Persons: An unjust Regard of one, and an unjust Disregard of another. It is mere <HI>creature partiality,</HI> and not <HI>infinite Justice:</HI> 2. It is not <HI>plain</HI> Scripture-Doctrine (if true:) but rather, inconsistent with the express written Word, that speaks of GOD's universal Offers of Grace: His Invitations, Promises, Threat∣enings, being all <HI>general.</HI> 3. We are bid to chuse Life, and repre∣hended for not doing it. 4. It is inconsistent with a State of Proba∣tion in those that <HI>must</HI> be saved or <HI>must</HI> be lost. 5. It is of fatal Con∣sequence; all Men being ready, on very slight Grounds, to fancy <HI>themselves</HI> of the Elect Number. But the Doctrine of Predestination is entirely changed from what it formerly was. <HI>Now</HI> it implies nei∣ther Faith, Peace, nor Purity. It is something that will do <HI>with∣out</HI> them all. Faith is no longer, according to the modern Predesti∣narian Scheme, a divine <HI>evidence of things not seen,</HI> wrought in the Soul by the immediate Power of the Holy Ghost: Not an <HI>evidence</HI> at all; but a <HI>mere nation.</HI> Neither is Faith made any longer a Means of Holiness; but something that will do without it. <HI>Christ</HI> is no more a Saviour <HI>from</HI> Sin; but a Defence, a Countenancer of it. He is no more a Fountain of spiritual Life in the Soul of Believers, but leaves his Elect inwardly <HI>dry,</HI> and outwardly <HI>unfruitful;</HI> and is made little more than a Refuge from the Image of the heavenly: even from Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost: <HI>thro' sanctification of the Spirit</HI>—Through the renewing and purifying In∣fluences of his Spirit on their Souls: <HI>unto obedience</HI>—To engage and enable them to yield themselves up to all holy Obedience, the Foun∣dation of all which is, the <HI>sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ</HI>— The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> which was typified by the Sprinkling of the Blood of Sacrifices under the Law; in Allusion to which it is called <HI>the blood of sprinkling.</HI></P>

<P>SIMON PETER, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us, through the righteous∣ness
<PB N="175" REF="046353_0174_1021108C00311668"/>of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> and of Jesus our Lord; As his divine power hath given us all things that per∣tain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us by glory and virtue. Thro' which he hath given us precious and exceed∣ing great promises;
<MILESTONE N="4"/> that by these, having escaped the corruption which is in the world through de∣sire, ye may become partakers of the divine nature: For this very reason,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> giving all diligence, add to your faith courage, and to courage knowledge,
<PB N="176" REF="046353_0175_10211091F9402890"/>And to knowledge temperance,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> and to temperance patience,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And to god∣liness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kind∣ness love.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> For these being in you and abounding, make <HI>you</HI> neither slothful nor unfruitful in the
<PB N="177" REF="046353_0176_10211093CBE8C078"/>knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> But he that wanteth these is blind, not able to see afar off, having forgotten the purification from his former sins.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Wherefore, brethren, be the more diligent to make your calling and election firm; for if ye do these things,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> ye shall never fall. For so an en∣trance shall be ministred to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Wherefore I will not neglect always to remind you of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the present truth;
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Yea I think it right, so long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by reminding <HI>you:</HI>
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Knowing that shortly I must put off my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ
<PB N="178" REF="046353_0177_10211095CDF60150"/>shewed me.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> But I will endeavour, that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</P>
<P>For we have not followed cunningly devised fa∣bles,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> while we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-wit∣nesses of his Majesty;
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For he received honour and glory from God the Father, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> xvii. 5.@</NOTE>; This is my beloved Son,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> in whom I delight. And we being with him in the holy mountain, heard this voice com∣ing from heaven.

If we feed on what is accord∣ing to our Nature, we grow: if not, we pine away and die. The Soul is of the Nature of GOD, and nothing but what is according to his Holiness can agree with it. Sin, of every Kind, starves the Soul and makes it consume away. Let us not try to invert the Order of GOD in his new Creation: We shall only deceive ourselves.

<HEAD>NOTES ON The First Epistle of St. JOHN.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>THE great Similitude, or rather Sameness both of Spirit and Expression, which runs through St. <HI>John</HI>'s Gospel, and all his Epistles, is a clear Evidence of their being written by the same Person. In this Epistle he speaks not to any particular Church, but to all the Christians of that Age, and in them to the whole Christian Church in all succeeding Ages.</P>
<P>Some have apprehended, that it is not easy to discern the Scope and Method of this Epistle. But if we examine it with Simplicity, these may readily be discovered. St. <HI>John</HI> in this Letter, or rather Tract (for he was present with Part of those to whom he wrote) has this apparent Aim, To confirm the happy and holy Communion of the Faithful with GOD and <HI>Christ,</HI> by describing the Marks of that blessed State.</P>
<P>The Parts of it are Three:
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>I. The Preface,</CELL>
<CELL>C. i. 1—4</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>II. The Tract itself,</CELL>
<CELL>5—C. v.—12</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>III. The Conclusion,</CELL>
<CELL>13—21</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>In the Preface he shews the Authority of his own Preaching and Writing, and expresly points out (ver. 3.) the Design of his present Writing. To the Preface exactly answers the Conclusion, more largely explaining the same Design, and recapitulating those Marks, by <HI>we know</HI> thrice repeated (ch. v. 18, 19, 20.)</P>
<P>The Tract itself has Two Parts, treating,
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>I. Severally,</CELL>
<CELL> </CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>1. Of Communion with the Father,</CELL>

</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>2. Of Communion with the Son,</CELL>
<CELL>C. ii. 1—12</CELL>

<CELL>That the Fruit of his <HI>Manifestation</HI> in the Flesh, may extend to his <HI>Manifestation</HI> in Glory.</CELL>
<CELL> </CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>3. Of the Confirmation and Fruit of this abiding through <HI>the Spirit,</HI></CELL>
<CELL>C. iv. 1—21</CELL>

<CELL>Of the Testimony of the <HI>Father,</HI> and <HI>Son,</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> On which Faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> the being born of GOD, Love to GOD and his Children, the keeping his Commandments, and Victory over the World are founded,</CELL>
<CELL>C. v. 1—12</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>The Parts frequently begin and end alike. Sometimes there is an Allusion in a preceding Part, and a Recapitulation in the subsequent. Each Part treats of a Benefit from GOD, and the Duty of the Faith∣ful derived therefrom by the most natural Inferences.</P>

<P>My beloved children, I write these things to you, that ye may not sin. But if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righte∣ous,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And he is the propitiation for our sins; and

<MILESTONE N="3"/> And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> But whoso keepeth his word, verily in him the love of God is perfected: hereby we know that we are in him.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> He that saith, he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Beloved, I write not a new com∣mandment to you, but the old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning; the old command∣ment is the word which ye have heard from the be∣ginning.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Again, I do write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is past away, and the true light now shineth. He that saith,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> he is in the light, and hateth his bro∣ther,

<MILESTONE N="11"/> But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and know∣eth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blind∣ed his eyes.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> I have written to you, beloved chil∣dren, because your sins are forgiven you for his name sake.

<MILESTONE N="16"/> For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And the world passeth away, and the desire thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.

<P>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Here∣by ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> is of God. And every spirit which confess∣eth not Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that <HI>spirit</HI> of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now already it is in the world.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Ye are of God, belov∣ed children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God;
<MILESTONE N="6"/> he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth not us: hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
<PB N="200" REF="046353_0199_102110E05DECA500"/>Beloved,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> let us love one another; for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> He that loveth not, knoweth not God;
<MILESTONE N="9"/> for God is love. Hereby was manifest∣ed the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> a propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one a∣nother.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Hereby we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And we have seen and testify, that the Father sent the son <HI>to be</HI> the Saviour of the world.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> Whosoever shall confess, that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. And we know and believe the love that God hath to us.

<MILESTONE N="18"/> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
<MILESTONE N="19"/> We love him because he first loved us. If a∣ny man say,

<MILESTONE N="6"/> This is he that came by wa∣ter and blood; <HI>even</HI> Jesus Christ; not by the wa∣ter only, but by the water and the blood: and it is the Spirit who testifieth; because the Spirit is

<DIV6 N="8" TYPE="note">
<P><LABEL>V. 8.</LABEL> <HI>And there are three that testify in heaven</HI>—The Testimony of the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, is by an eminent Gradation corroborated by Three, who give a still greater Testimony, <HI>the Father</HI> —Who clearly testified of the Son, both at his Baptism, and at his Transfiguration, <HI>the Word</HI>—Who testified of himself, on many Oc∣casions, while he was on Earth: And again, with still greater Solem∣nity, after his Ascension into Heaven: (<HI>Rev.</HI> i. 5. xix. 13.) <HI>And the Spirit</HI>—Whose Testimony was added, chiefly after his Glorifica∣tion, (ch. ii. 27. <HI>John</HI> xv. 26. <HI>Acts</HI> v. 32. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 16.) <HI>And these three are one</HI>—Even as those two, <HI>the Father and the Son are one,</HI> (<HI>John</HI> x. 30.) Nothing can separate the Spirit from the Father and the Son. If He were not one with the Father and the Son, the Apostle∣ought to have said, <HI>The Father and the Word</HI> (who are one) <HI>and the Spirit are two.</HI> But this is contrary to the whole Tenor of Revela∣tion. It remains, that these three are one. They are one in Essence, in Knowledge, in Will, and in their Testimony.</P>
<P>It is observable, the Three in the one Verse are opposed not con∣jointly, but severally to the Three in the other: As if he had said, not only the Spirit testifies, but also the Father; (<HI>John</HI> v. 37.) Not only the Water, but also the Word: (<HI>John</HI> iii. 11. x. 41.) Not only the Blood, but also the Holy Ghost. (<HI>John</HI> xv. 26, &amp;c.) It must now appear to every reasonable Man, how absolutely necessary the eighth Verse is. St. <HI>John</HI> could not think of the Testimony of the Spirit, and Water, and Blood, and subjoin <HI>The testimony of God is greater,</HI> without thinking also of the Testimony of the Son and Holy Ghost, yea and mentioning it in so solemn an Enumeration. Nor can any possible Reason be devised, why without <HI>Three testifying in heaven</HI>—he should enumerate <HI>Three,</HI> and no more <HI>who testify on earth</HI>—The Testimony of all is given <HI>on earth,</HI> not <HI>in heaven,</HI> but <PB N="204" REF="046353_0203_102110EDFA0B5448"/> they who testify are part on Earth, part in Heaven; the Witnesses who are on Earth testify chiefly concerning his Abode on Earth, though not excluding his State of Exaltation. The Witnesses who are in Heaven testify chiefly concerning his Glory at GOD's Right Hand, though not excluding his State of Humiliation.</P>
<P>The seventh Verse therefore, with the sixth, contains a Recapi∣tulation of the whole Oeconomy of <HI>Christ,</HI> from his Baptism to Pen∣tecost: The eighth, the Sum of the divine Oeconomy, from the Time of his Exaltation.</P>
<P>Hence it farther appears, That this Position of the seventh and eighth Verses, which places those who testify <HI>on earth,</HI> before those who testify <HI>in heaven,</HI> is abundantly pretetable to the other, and af∣fords a Gradation admirably suited to the Subject.</P>

<MILESTONE N="6"/> Whom if thou send forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> For they want forth for his sake,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> taking nothing of the Gentiles. We ought therefore to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> I wrote to the church; but Diótrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come I will remember his wicked deeds which he doth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> and casteth them out of the church. Belov∣ed, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that is a doer of good, is of God; he that is a doer of evil,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> hath not seen God. De∣metrius

<P>This Epistle greatly resembles the Second of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which St. <HI>Jude</HI> seems to have had in View while he wrote. That was written but a very little before his Death; and hence we may gather that St. <HI>Jude</HI> lived some time after it, and saw that grievous Declension in the Church, which St. <HI>Peter</HI> had foretold. But he passes over some Things mentioned by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> repeats some, in different Expressions, and with a different View, and adds others; clearly evidencing there∣by the Wisdom of GOD which rested upon him. Thus St. <HI>Peter</HI> cites and confirms St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Writings, and is himself cited and confirmed by St. <HI>Jude.</HI></P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>JUDE, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are beloved of God the Father, and preserved through Jesus Christ, and called,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Mercy unto you, and peace, and love be multiplied.</P>
<P>Beloved,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you and exhort you, to contend earnest∣ly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> For there are certain men crept in una∣wares, who were of old described before, with re∣gard to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and deny∣ing
<PB N="215" REF="046353_0214_10211114C2E93188"/>our only Master and Lord,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Jesus Christ. I am therefore willing to remind you, who once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed them that believed not.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 4.@</NOTE> angels, who kept not their first dignity, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, which in the same manner with these gave themselves over to fornication, and went after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> In like manner these dreamers also defile the flesh,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 10.@</NOTE> despise authority, rail at
<PB N="216" REF="046353_0215_102111179B686F08"/>dignities.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Yet Michael the archangel, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tending with the devil, he disputed concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a rail∣ing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. But these rail at all things which they know not:
<MILESTONE N="10"/> and all the things which they know naturally, as the brute beasts,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> in these they are defiled. Woe to them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.</P>
<P>These are spots in your feasts of love,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> while they banquet with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds without water, driven about of winds; trees without leaves, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Raging waves of the
<PB N="217" REF="046353_0216_1021111980956230"/>sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And of these also, Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold the Lord com∣eth with ten thousands of his holy ones,

<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<P>'TIS scarce possible for any that either love or fear GOD, not to feel their Hearts extremely affected, in seriously reading either the Beginning, or the latter Part of <HI>the Revelation.</HI> These, 'tis evident, we cannot consider too much: but the intermediate Parts I did not study at all for many Years: As utterly despairing of under∣standing them, after the fruitless Attempts of so many wise and good Men; and perhaps I should have lived and died in this Sentiment, had I not seen the Works of the great <HI>Bengelius.</HI> But these revived my Hopes of understanding even the Prophecies of this Book: At least many of them in some good Degree; for perhaps some will not be opened but in Eternity. Let us however bless GOD for the Mea∣sure of Light we may enjoy, and improve it to his Glory.</P>
<P>The following Notes are mostly those of that excellent Man; a few of which are taken from his <HI>Gnomon Novi Testamenti,</HI> but far more from his <HI>Ekklarte Offenbarung,</HI> which is a full and regular Comment on <HI>the Revelation.</HI> Every Part of this I do not undertake to defend. But none should condemn him, without reading his Proofs at large. It did not suit my Design to insert these: they are above the Capacity of ordinary Readers. Nor had I Room to insert the entire Transla∣tion of a Book which contains near twelve hundred Pages.</P>
<P>All I can do is, partly to translate, partly abridge the most neces∣sary of his Observations; allowing myself the Liberty to alter some of them, and to add a few Notes where he is not full. His Text, it may be observed, I have taken almost throughout, which I appre∣hend
<PB N="220" REF="046353_0219_1021125935E45360"/>he has abundantly defended both in the <HI>Gnomon</HI> itself, and in his <HI>Apparatus</HI> and <HI>Crisis in Apocalypsin.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I by no means pretend to understand, or explain all that is contained in this mysterious Book. I only offer what Help I can to the serious Enquirer, and shall rejoice if any be moved thereby, more carefully to read and more deeply to consider the Words of this Prophecy. Blessed is he that does this with a single Eye. His La∣bour shall not be in vain.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 1.</LABEL> <HI>The Revelation</HI>—Properly so called; for Things covered be∣fore, are here <HI>revealed</HI> or unveiled. No Prophecy in the Old Testa∣ment has this Title: It was reserved for this alone in the New. It is as it were a Manifesto, wherein the Heir of all Things declares, That all Power is given Him in Heaven and Earth, and that He will in the End gloriously exercise that Power, maugre all the Opposition of all his Enemies. <HI>Of Jesus Christ</HI>—Not, of <HI>John the Divine,</HI> a Title added in latter Ages.

It was St. <HI>John</HI> indeed who wrote this Book; but the Author of it is <HI>Jesus Christ. Which God gave unto him</HI>—According to his holy, glorified Huma∣nity, as the Great Prophet of the Church. GOD gave <HI>the Revela∣tion</HI> to <HI>Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ</HI> made it known to his Servants. <HI>To shew</HI>—This Word recurs, ch. xxii. 6. And in many Places the Parts of this Book refer to each other. Indeed the whole Structure of it breathes the Art of GOD, comprizing in the most finished Com∣pendium, Things to come, many, various; near, intermediate, re∣mote; the greatest, the least; terrible, comfortable; old, new; long, short; and these interwoven together, opposite, composite; relative to each other at a small, at a great Distance; and therefore some∣times as it were disappearing, broken off, suspended, and afterwards unexpectedly and most seasonably appearing again. In all its Parts it has an admirable Variety, with the most exact Harmony, beauti∣fully illustrated by those very Digressions which seem to interrupt it. In this Manner does it display the manifold Wisdom of GOD shining in the Oeconomy of the Church through so many Ages. <HI>His ser∣vants</HI>—Much is comprehended in this Appellation. 'Tis a great Thing to be a Servant of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> This Book is dedicated particularly to the Servants of <HI>Christ</HI> in the seven Churches in <HI>Asia:</HI> But not exclusive of all his other Servants, in all Nations and Ages.

Serve thou the LORD <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in Truth. So shalt thou learn his Secret in this Book. Yea, and thou shalt feel in thy Heart, whether this Book be divine or not. <HI>The things which must shortly come to pass</HI>—The Things con∣tained in this Prophecy did begin to be accomplished shortly after it was given; and the whole might be said to <HI>come to pass shortly,</HI> in the same Sense as St. <HI>Peter</HI> says, <HI>The end of all things is at hand;</HI> and our LORD himself. <HI>behold I come quickly.</HI> There is in this Book a rich Treasure of all the Doctrines pertaining to Faith and Holiness. But these are also delivered in other Parts of Holy Writ; so that <HI>the Revelation</HI> need not to have been given for the Sake of these. The peculiar Design of this is, <HI>To shew the things which must come to pass.</HI> And this we are especially to have before our Eyes, whenever we read or hear it.</P>

And St. <HI>John</HI> writes <HI>what he has seen,</HI> and <HI>what is,</HI> only as it has an Influence on, or gives Light to, <HI>what shall be. And be</HI>—Jesus Christ, <HI>sent and sig∣nified them, shewed</HI> them by <HI>Signs</HI> or Emblems (so the Greek Word properly means) <HI>by his angel</HI>—Peculiarly called in the Sequel, <HI>The angel of God,</HI> and particularly mentioned, ch. xvii. 1. xxi. 9. xxii. 6, 16. <HI>To his servant John</HI>—A Title given to no other single Person throughout the Book.</P>

<P>Nor are Helps wanting whereby any sincere and diligent Enquirer may understand what he reads therein. The Book itself is written in the most accurate Manner possible. It distinguishes the several Things whereof it treats by seven Epistles, seven Seals, seven Trum∣pets, seven Phials; each of which Sevens is divided into Four and <PB N="222" REF="046353_0221_1021111F171053D0"/> Three. Many Things the Book itself explains, as the seven Stars; the seven Candlesticks; the Lamb, his seven Horns and seven Eyes; the Incense; the Dragon; the Heads and Horns of the Beasts; the fine Linen; the Testimony of <HI>Jesus.</HI> And much Light arises from comparing it with the ancient Prophecies, and the Predictions in the other Books of the New Testament.</P>
<P>In this Book our LORD has comprized what was wanting in those Prophecies, touching the Time which followed his Ascension, and the End of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Polity. Accordingly it reaches from the Old <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to the New, reducing all Things into one Sum in the exactest Order, and with a near Resemblance to the ancient Pro∣phets. The Introduction and Conclusion agree with <HI>Daniel;</HI> the Description of the Man-Child and the Promises to <HI>Sion</HI> with <HI>Isaiah;</HI> the Judgment of <HI>Babylon,</HI> with <HI>Jeremiah:</HI> Again, the Determination of Times with <HI>Daniel:</HI> the Architecture of the Holy City, with <HI>Ezehiel;</HI> the Emblems of the Horses, Candlesticks, &amp;c. with <HI>Zechariab.</HI> Many Things largely described by the Prophets are here summarily repeated; and frequently in the same Words. To them we may then usefully have Recourse. Yet the <HI>Revelation</HI> suffices for the explaining itself, even if we do not yet understand those Prophecies; yea, it casts much Light upon them. Frequently likewise, where there is a Resemblance between them, there is a Difference also; <HI>the Revelation</HI> as it were taking a Stock from one of the old Prophets, and inserting a new Graft into it. Thus <HI>Zechariah</HI> speaks of two Olive-trees. And so does St. <HI>John;</HI> but with a different Meaning. <HI>Daniel</HI> has a Beast with Ten Horns. So has St. <HI>John;</HI> but not with quite the same Signification. And here the Difference of Words, Emblems, Things, Times ought studiously to be observed.</P>
<P>Our LORD foretold many Things before his Passion; but not all Things: For it was not yet seasonable. Many Things likewise his Spirit foretold in the Writings of the Apostles, so far as the Neces∣sities of those Times required, now be comprizes them all in one short Book; therein presupposing all the other Prophecies, and at the same Time, explaining, containing, and perfecting them in one Thread. It is right therefore to compare them; but not to measure the Fulness of these by the Scantiness of those preceding.</P>
<P><HI>Christ,</HI> when on Faith, foretold what would come to pass in a short Time; adding a brief Description of the last Things. Here he foretells the intermediate Things; so that both put together, consti∣tute one compleat Chain of Prophecy. This Book is therefore not only the Sum, and the Key of all the Prophecies which preceded, but likewise a Supplement to all; the Seals being closed before. Of Consequence it contains many Particulars, not revealed in any other Part of Scripture. They have therefore little Gratitude to GOD for such a Revelation, reserved for the Exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> who boldly reject whatever they find here, which was not revealed, or not so clearly in other Parts of Scripture. <HI>He that readeth and they that bear</HI> —St. <HI>John</HI> probably sent this Book by a single Person into <HI>Asia,</HI> who <PB N="223" REF="046353_0222_10211125CC3D7410"/> <HI>read</HI> it in the Churches, while many <HI>heard.</HI> But this likewise in a secondary Sense refers to all that shall duly read or hear it in all Ages. <HI>The words of this prophecy</HI>—It is a <HI>Revelation</HI> with regard to <HI>Christ</HI> who gives it, <HI>a prophecy</HI> with regard to <HI>John</HI> who delivers it to the Churches. <HI>And keep the things which are written therein</HI>—In such a Manner as the Nature of them requires; namely, with Repentance, Faith, Patience, Prayer, Obedience, Watchfulness, Constancy. It behoves every Christian, at all Opportunities to read what is written in the Oracles of GOD; and to read this precious Book in particular, frequently, reverently, and attentively. <HI>For the time</HI> of its Begin∣ning to be accomplished, <HI>is near</HI>—Even when St. <HI>John</HI> wrote. How much nearer to us is even the full Accomplishment of this weighty Prophecy?</P>

By these <HI>seven Spirits,</HI> not seven created Angels, but the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> is to be understood: The Angels are never termed <HI>Spirits</HI> in this Book: and when all the Angels <HI>stand up,</HI> while the four living Creatures and the four and twenty Elders <HI>worship him that sitteth on the throne</HI> and the Lamb, <HI>the seven Spirits,</HI> neither stand up nor wor∣ship.

In each Church there was one Pastor or Ruling Minister, to whom all the Rest were subordinate. This Pastor, Bishop, or Overseer, had the peculiar Care over that Flock: On him the Prosperity of that Con∣gregation in a great Measure depended: And he was to answer for all those Souls at the Judgment-Seat of <HI>Christ.

<P>Ch. ii. of the following Letters to the Angels of the seven Churches it may be necessary to speak first, in general, and then particularly.</P>
<P>In general we may observe, when the <HI>Israelites</HI> were to receive the Law at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> they were first to be purified. And when the Kingdom of GOD was at Hand, <HI>John</HI> the Baptist prepared Men for it by Repentance.

And whoever in any Age would profitably read or hear it, must observe the same Admonitions.</P>
<P>These Letters are a Kind of seven-fold Preface to the Book. <HI>Christ</HI> now appears in the Form of a Man (not yet under the Emblem of a Lamb) and speaks mostly in proper, not in figurative Words. It is not all ch. iv. 1. that St. <HI>John</HI> enters upon that Grand Vision which takes up the Residue of the Book.</P>

<P>To the angel of the church at Ephesus write, These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right-hand, that walketh in the midst of the

<MILESTONE N="2"/> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, that thou canst not bear evil men; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
<PB N="231" REF="046353_0230_10211140E7437BB0"/>them liars:
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And hast patience, and hast borne for my name's sake,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and hast not fainted. But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> and repent and do the first works: if not, I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of
<PB N="232" REF="046353_0231_102111429EED7718"/>its place,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> unless thou repent. But thou hast this, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</P>
<P>And to the angel of the church at Smyrna write,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> These things saith the First and the Last,
<PB N="233" REF="046353_0232_1021114510777FF8"/>who was dead and is alive.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> I know thy affliction and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the reviling of those who say they are Jews and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer: behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried, and ye shall have affliction ten days: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that overcometh shall not be hur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the second death.</P>
<P>And to the angel of the church at Pergamos
<MILESTONE N="12"/> <PB N="234" REF="046353_0233_1021114C54A1EBE0"/>write, These things saith he who hath the sharp two-edged sword.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan <HI>is;</HI> and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, in the days wherein Antipas <HI>was</HI> my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. But I have a few things against thee,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> that thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block be∣fore the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> and to commit fornication. In like manner thou also hast them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> which I hate. Repent therefore; if not, I come to thee, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
<PB N="235" REF="046353_0234_1021114DDCA45238"/>churches. To him that overcometh will I give of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which none knoweth, but he that receiveth it.</P>
<P>And to the angel of the church at Thyatira write,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> These things saith the Son of God, who hath eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass. I know thy love and faith,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> and thy service and pati∣ence,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> and thy last works more than the first. But I have against thee, that thou sufferest that woman Je∣zebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, and teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and
<PB N="236" REF="046353_0235_1021114F974BE9B8"/>to eat things sacrificed to idols.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And I gave her time to repent of her fornication; but she will not repent. Behold I will cast her into a bed,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> and them that com∣mit adultery with her, into great affliction, unless they repent of her works.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And I will kill her chil∣dren with death; and all the churches shall know, that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give you, every one, according to your works.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But I say to you, the rest that are at Thy∣atira, as many as do not hold this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay upon you no other burden.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> But what ye have,
<MILESTONE N="26"/> hold fast till I come. And he that overcom∣eth and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
<PB N="237" REF="046353_0236_102111525A4C0288"/>will I give power over the nations,
<MILESTONE N="27"/> (And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; they shall be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessels) as I also have received from my Father.
<MILESTONE N="28"/> And I will give him the morning∣star.

He need not have <HI>left</HI> this. He might have retained it intire to the End. And he did retain it in part, or there could not have remained so much of what was commendable in him. But he had not kept (as he might have done) the first tender Love, in its Vigour and Warmth. Reader, Hast thou?</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="5" TYPE="note">
<P><LABEL>V. 5.</LABEL> It is not possible for any to recover the first Love, but by taking these three Steps, 1. <HI>Remember;</HI> 2. <HI>Repent;</HI> 3. <HI>Do the first works. Remember from whence thou art fallen</HI>—From what Degree of Faith, Love, Holiness, though perhaps insensibly. <HI>And repent</HI>— Which in the very lowest Sense implies, a deep and lively Convic∣tion of thy Fall. Of the seven Angels, Two, at <HI>Ephesus</HI> and at <HI>Pergamos,</HI> were in a mixed State: Two, at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and at <HI>Laodicea,</HI> were greatly corrupted. All these are exhorted to <HI>repent;</HI> as are the Followers of <HI>Jezebel</HI> at <HI>Thyatira.</HI> Two, at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> were in a flourishing State, and are therefore only exhorted to Sted∣fastness.</P>
<P>There can be no State, either of any Pastor, Church, or single Person, which has not here suitable Instructions. All, whether Ministers or Hearers, together with their secret or open Enemies, in all Places and all Ages, may draw hence necessary Self-Know∣ledge, Reproof, Commendation, Warning or Confirmation. Whe∣ther any be as dead as the Angel at <HI>Sardis,</HI> or as much alive as the Angel at <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> this Book is sent to Him, and the <HI>Lord Je∣sus</HI> hath something to say to him therein. For the seven Churches with their Angels represent the whole Christian Church, dispersed throughout the whole World, as it subsists not (as some have ima∣gined) in one Age after another, but in every Age. This is a Point of deep Importance, and always necessary to be remembered: That these seven Churches are, as it were, a Sample of the whole Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> as it was then, as it is now, and as it will be in all Ages. <HI>Do the first works</HI>—outwardly and inwardly, or thou canst never regain the first Love: <HI>But if not</HI>—By this Word is the Warning sharpened to those five Churches which are called to repent: (for if <HI>Ephesus</HI> was threatened, how much more shall <HI>Sardis</HI> and <HI>Laodicea</HI> be afraid!) And according as they obey the Call or not, there is a Pro∣mise or a Threatning (ch. ii. 5, 16, 22. ch. iii. 3, 20.) But even in the Threatning the Promise is implied, in case of true Repentance. <HI>I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place</HI>—I will remove, unless thou repent, the Flock now under thy Care to ano∣ther <PB N="232" REF="046353_0231_102111429EED7718"/> Place, where they shall be better taken Care of. But from the flourishing State of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> after this, there is Reason to believe he did repent.</P>

<DIV6 N="6" TYPE="note">
<P><LABEL>V. 6.</LABEL> <HI>But thou hast this</HI>—Divine Grace seeks whatever may help him that is fallen to recover his Standing: <HI>that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans</HI>—Probably so called from <HI>Nicolas,</HI> one of the seven Deacons, (<HI>Acts</HI> vi. 5.) Their Doctrines and Lives were equally corrupt. They allowed the most abominable Lewdness and Adulteries, as well as sacrificing to Idols; all which they placed among Things indiffer∣ent, and pleaded for as Branches of Christian Liberty.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 7.</LABEL> <HI>He that hath an ear, let him hear</HI>—Every Man, whoever can hear at all, ought carefully to hear this. <HI>What the spirit saith</HI>—In these great and precious Promises <HI>to the churches</HI>—And in them to every one that overcometh: that goeth on from Faith, and by Faith to full Victory over the World, and the Flesh and the Devil.</P>
<P>In these Seven Letters Twelve Promises are contained, which are an Extract of all the Promises of GOD. Some of them are not ex∣pressly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again in this Book, as <HI>the hidden manna,</HI> the In∣scription o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>the name of the new Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>fitting upon the throne.</HI> Some resemble what is aftewards mentioned, as <HI>the hidden name,</HI> (ch. xix. 12.) <HI>the ruling the nations</HI> (ch. xix. 15.) <HI>the morning star,</HI> (ch. xxii. 16.) And some are expressly mentioned, as <HI>the tree of life,</HI> (ch. xxii. 2.) Freedom from <HI>the second death,</HI> (ch. ix. 6.) the Name in <HI>the book of life,</HI> (ch. xx. 12. xxi. 27.) the remaining <HI>in the temple of God,</HI> (ch. vii. 13.) the Inscription of <HI>the name of God and of the Lamb,</HI> (ch. xiv. 1. xiii. 4.) In these Promises sometimes the Enjoyment of the highest Goods, sometimes Deliverance from the greatest Evils is mentioned. And each implies the other, so that where either Part is expressed, the whole is to be understood. That Part is expressed which has most Resemblance to the Virtues or Works of him that was spoken to in the Letter preceding. <HI>To eat of the tree of life</HI>—The first Thing pro∣mised in these Letters, is the last and highest in the Accomplish∣ment (ch. xxii. 2, 14, 19.) <HI>The tree of life,</HI> and <HI>the water of I se go</HI> together (ch. xxii. 1, 2.) both implying, the living with GOD eter∣nally: <HI>in the paradise of my God</HI>—The Word <HI>Paradise</HI> means a Gar∣den of Pleasure. In the earthly Paradise there was one Tree of Life: there are no other Trees in the Paradise of GOD.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 8.</LABEL> <HI>These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive</HI>—How directly does this Description tend to confirm him against the Fear of Death? (ver. 10, 11.)

<P><LABEL>V. 9.</LABEL> <HI>I know thy affliction and poverty</HI>—A poor Prerogative in the Eyes of the World!

<P><LABEL>V. 10.</LABEL> The first and last Words of this Verse are particularly direct∣ed to the Minister; whence we may gather, that his Suffering and the Affliction of the Church were at the same Time, and of the same Continuance. <HI>Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer</HI>—Probably by Means of the false Jews. <HI>Behold</HI>—This intimates the Nearness of the Affliction.

But there is no Night in Heaven, <HI>and say, Holy, holy, holy</HI>—Is the Three-One GOD.</P>
<P>There are two Words in the Original, very different from each oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, both which we translate Holy. The one means properly <HI>me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l;</HI> but the other, which occurs here, implies much more. This Holiness is the Sum of all praise, which is given to the Almighty Creator, for all that he does and reveals concerning himself, till the new Song beings with it new Matter of Glory.</P>
<P>This Word properly signifies <HI>separated,</HI> both in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and other Languages. And when GOD is termed Holy, it denotes that Excel∣lence, which is altogether peculiar to himself; and the Glory flow∣ing from all his Attributes conjoined, shining forth from all his Works, and darkening all Things besides itself, whereby he is, and eternally remains, in an incomprehensible Manner <HI>separate</HI> and at a Distance, not only from all that is impure, but likewise from all that is created.</P>
<P>GOD is <HI>separate</HI> from all Things. He is, and works from himself, out of himself, in himself, thro' himself, for himself. Therefore He is the First and the Last, the only One and the Eternal, Living and Happy, Endless and Unchangeable, Almighty, Omniscient, Wise and True, Just and Faithful, Gracious and Merciful.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that Holy and Holiness mean the same as GOD and Godhead; and as we say of a King, <HI>His Majesty,</HI> so the Scripture says of GOD, <HI>His Holiness. (Heb.</HI> xii. 10.) The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of GOD. When GOD is spoken of, he is often named, <HI>The Holy One.</HI> And as GOD swears by his Name, so he does also by his Holiness, that is, by Himself.</P>
<P>This Holiness is often stiled Glory; often his Holiness and Glory are celebrated together. (<HI>Lev.</HI> x. 3. <HI>Isaiah</HI> vi. 3.) for Holiness is covered Glory, and Glory is uncovered Holiness. The Scripture speaks abundantly of the Holiness and Glory of the Father, the Son <PB N="246" REF="046353_0245_10211175F3F2B0D8"/> and the Holy Ghost. And hereby is the Mystery of the Holy Tri∣nity eminently confirmed.</P>
<P>That is also termed <HI>Holy,</HI> which is consecrated to Him, and for that End <HI>separated</HI> from other Things. And so is that wherein we may be like GOD, or united to him.</P>
<P>In the Hymn resembling this, recorded by <HI>Isaiah,</HI> ch. vi. 3. is ad∣ded, <HI>The whole earth is full of his glory.</HI> But this is deferred in <HI>the Revelation,</HI> till the Glory of the LORD (his Enemies being destroyed) fills the Earth.</P>

<P><LABEL>Chap. vi.</LABEL> The seven Seals are not distinguished from each other, by specifying the Time of them. They swiftly follow the Letters to the seven Churches, and all begin almost at the same Time. By the four former is shewn, That all the public Occurrences of all Ages and Nations, as <HI>Empire, War, Provision, Calamities,</HI> are made subject to <HI>Christ.</HI> And Instances are intimated of the First in the East, the Second in the West, the Third in the South, the Fourth in the North and the whole World.</P>
<P>The Contents, as of the Phials and Trumpets, so of the Seals, are shewn, by the Songs of Praise and Thanksgiving annexed to them. They contain therefore <HI>the power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing,</HI> which the Lamb received. The four former have a peculiar Connexion with each other; and so have the three latter Seals. The former relate to vi∣sible Things, toward the four Quarters to which the four living Crea∣tures look.</P>
<P>Before we proceed, it may be observed, 1. No Man should con∣strain either himself or another, to explain <HI>every thing</HI> in this Book. It is sufficient for every one to speak, just so far as he understands. 2. We should remember, that altho' the ancient Prophets wrote the Occurrences of those Kingdoms only with which <HI>Israel</HI> had to do, yet <HI>the Revelation</HI> contains what relates to the whole World, through which the Christian Church is extended. Yet, 3. We should not prescribe to this Prophecy, as if it must needs admit or exclude this or that history, according as we judge one or the other, to be of great or small Importance. GOD <HI>seeth not as a man seeth.</HI> There∣fore what we think great is often omitted, what we think little in∣serted, in Scripture-History or Prophecy. 4. We must take care, not to overlook what is already fulfilled; and not to describe as ful∣filled what is still to come.</P>
<P>We are to look in History for the fulfilling of the four first Seals, quickly after the Date of the Prophecy. In each of these appears a different Horseman. In each we are to consider, first, The Horse∣man himself; secondly, What he does.</P>
<P>The Horseman himself, by an emblematical Prosopopoeia, repre∣sents <HI>a swift Power,</HI> bringing with it either, 1. A slourishing State, or, 2. Bloodshed, or, 3. Scarcity of Provisions, or, 4. Public Cala∣raities. With the Quality of each of these Riders, the Colour of his Horse agrees. The fourth Horseman is expressly termed <HI>Death;</HI> the First, with his Bow and Crown, a Conqueror. The Second, with his great Sword, is a Warrior, or, as the <HI>Romans</HI> termed him, <HI>Mars:</HI> The Third, with the Scales, has Power over the Produce of the Land. Particular Incidents under this or that <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, are not ex∣tensive enough to answer any of these Horsemen.</P>
<P>The Action of every Horseman intimates farther, 1. Toward the East, wide spread Empire and Victory upon Victory; 2. Toward the <PB N="252" REF="046353_0251_1021118828E21080"/> West, much Bloodshed; 3. Toward the South, Scarcity of Provisi∣ons; 4. Toward the North, the Plague and various Calamities.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 2.</LABEL> <HI>And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow</HI>—This Colour, and the Bow shooting Arrows afar off, betoken Victory, Triumph, Prosperity, Enlargement of Empire, and Dominion over many People.</P>
<P>Another Horseman indeed, and of quite another Kind, appears on a white Horse, ch. xix. 11. But he that is spoken of under the first Seal must be so understood, as to bear a Proportion to the Horsemen in the second, third, and fourth Seal.</P>
<P><HI>Nerva</HI> succeeded the Emperor <HI>Domitian</HI> at the very Time when <HI>the Revelation</HI> was written, in the Year of our LORD 96. He reigned searce a Year alone; and three Months before his Death, he named <HI>Trajan</HI> for his Colleague and successor, and died in the Year 98. <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Accession to the Empire seems to be the Dawning of the seven Seals. <HI>And a crown was given him</HI>—This, considering his Descent, <HI>Trajan</HI> could have no Hope of attaining. But GOD gave it him by the Hand of <HI>Nerva:</HI> and then the East soon felt his Power. <HI>And he went forth conquering and to conquer</HI>—That is, from one Victory to another. In the Year 108 the already victorious <HI>Trajan went forth</HI> toward the East, to <HI>conquer</HI> not only <HI>Armenia, Assyria,</HI> and <HI>Misopotamia,</HI> but also the Countries beyond the <HI>Tigris,</HI> carry∣ing the Bounds of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire to a far greater Extent than ever. We find no Emperor like him for making Conquests. He aimed at nothing else: He lived only <HI>to conquer.</HI> Meantime in him was eminently fulfilled, what had been prophesied of the fourth Em∣pire; (<HI>Dan.</HI> ii. 40. vii. 23.)

<P><LABEL>V. 4.</LABEL> <HI>There went forth another horse that was red</HI>—A Colour suit∣able to Bloodshed. <HI>And to him that sat thereon it was given, to take peace from the earth—Vespasian</HI> in the Year 75, had dedicated a Tem∣ple to <HI>Peace.</HI> But after a Time, we hear little more of Peace. All <PB N="253" REF="046353_0252_1021118A6C74C490"/> is full of War and Bloodshed, chiefly in the western World, where the main Business of Men seemed to be, <HI>To kill one another.</HI></P>
<P>To this Horseman <HI>there was given a great Sword</HI>—And he had much to do with it. For as soon as <HI>Trajan</HI> ascended the Throne, <HI>Peace was taken from the earth. Decebalus,</HI> King of <HI>Dacia,</HI> which lies westward from <HI>Patmos,</HI> put the <HI>Romans</HI> to no small Trouble. The War lasted five Years, and consumed abundance of Men on both Sides: yet was only a Prelude to much other Bloodshed, which followed for a long Season.

But when there is Scarcity, they are obliged to deliver them out by Measure and Weight. <HI>Ezek.</HI> iv. 16. Accordingly these Scales sig∣nisy Scarcity. They serve also for a Token, That all the Fruits of the Earth, and consequently the whole Heavens, with their Courses and Influences, that all the seasons of the Year, with whatsoever they Produce, in Nature or States, are subject to Christ. Accord∣ingly his Hand is wonderful, not only in Wars and Victories, but likewise in the whole Course of Nature.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 6.</LABEL> <HI>And I heard a voice</HI>—It seems from GOD himself, <HI>saying</HI>— To the Horseman, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther. Let there <HI>be a measure of wheat for a penny</HI>—The Word translated, <HI>mea∣sure,</HI> was a <HI>Grecian</HI> Measure, nearly equal to our Quart. This was the daily Allowance of a Slave. The <HI>Roman penny</HI> (as much as a Labourer then earned in a Day) was about Seven-pence Half-penny <HI>English.</HI> According to this, Wheat would be near twenty Shillings per Bushel. This must have been fulfilled, while the <HI>Grecian</HI> Mea∣sure, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Money were still in Use: as also, where that Measure was the common Measure, and this Money the current Coin. It was so in <HI>Egypt</HI> under <HI>Trajan.

<PB N="254" REF="046353_0253_1021118E6E801938"/>
<P>This was also fulfilled in the Reign of <HI>Trajan,</HI> especially in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which lay southward from <HI>Patmos.</HI> In this Country, which used to be the Granary of the Empire, there was an uncommon Dearth at the very Beginning of his Reign: So that he was obliged to supply <HI>Egypt</HI> itself with Corn from other Countries. The same Scarcity there was in the thirteenth Year of his Reign, the Harvest failing, for want of the Risings of the <HI>Nile:</HI> And that not only in <HI>Egypt,</HI> but in all those other Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> where the <HI>Nile</HI> uses to overflow.</P>

So the fourth Seal reaches to the Borders of Things invisible, which are comprized in the three last Seals. <HI>And power was given to him over the fourth part of the earth</HI>—What came single and in a lower Degree before, comes now together, and much more severely. The first Seal brought <HI>Victory</HI> with it: In the Second was <HI>a Great Sword;</HI> but here a <HI>Scimetar.</HI> In the Third was moderate <HI>Dearth;</HI> here <HI>Famine,</HI> and <HI>Plague,</HI> and <HI>Wild Beasts</HI> beside. And it may well be, that from the Time of <HI>Trajan</HI> downwards, <HI>the fourth Part of</HI> Men upon the Earth, that is, within the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, died by Sword, Famine, Pestilence, and Wild Beasts. "At that Time, says <HI>Aurelius Victor,</HI> the <HI>Tyber</HI> overflowed much more fatally than under <HI>Nerva,</HI> with a great Destruction of Houses; and there was a dreadful Earthquake through many Provinces, and a terrible Plague and Famine, and many Places consumed by Fire." <HI>By Death,</HI> that is, by Pestilence. <HI>Wild Beasis</HI> have, at several times, destroyed abundance of Men. And undoubtedly there was given them, at this Time, an uncom∣mon Fierceness and Strength. 'Tis observable, that War brings on Scarcity, and Scarcity Pestilence (thro' Want of wholesome Sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nance;) and Pestilence, by depopulating the Country leaves the few Survivors an easier Prey to the Wild Beasts. And thus these Judg∣ments make Way for one another, in the Order wherein they are here represented.</P>
<P>What has been already observed may be a four-sold Proof, That the four Horsemen, as with their first Entrance in the Reign of <HI>Tra∣jan</HI> (which does by no means exhaust the Contents of the four first <PB N="255" REF="046353_0254_10211192F0E0A260"/> Seals) so with all their Entrances in succeeding Ages, and with the whole Course of the World and of visible Nature, are in all Ages sub∣ject to Christ, subsisting by his Power, and serving his Will, against the Wicked, and in Defence of the Righteous. Herewith likewise a Way is paved for the Trumpets, which regularly succeed each other. And the whole Prophecy, as to what is future, is confirm∣ed, by the clear Accomplishment of this Part of it.</P>

<MILESTONE N="4"/> And the smoke of the incense ascended before God out of the angel's hand with the prayers of the saints.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it upon the earth, and there were thun∣derings, and lightnings, and voices, and an earth∣quake.</P>
<P>And the seven angels,

For Praise is sounding in Hea∣ven Day and Night. In particular, immediately before this Silence, all the Angels, and before them the innumerable Multitude, had been crying with a loud Voice: And now, all is still at once; there is an Universal Pause. Hereby the Seventh Seal is very remarkably distinguished from the Six preceding.

<P><LABEL>V. 2.</LABEL> <HI>And I saw</HI>—The Seven Trumpets belong to the Seventh Seal, as do the seven Phials to the Seventh Trumpet. This should be carefully remembered, that we may not confound together the Times which follow each other. And yet it may be observed in ge∣neral, concerning the Times of the Incidents mentioned in this Book. It is not a certain Rule, that every Part of the Text is fully accom∣plished, before the Completion of the following Part begins. All Things mentioned in the <HI>Epistles</HI> are not fully accomplished before the <HI>Seals</HI> are opened: Neither are all things mentioned under the <HI>Seals</HI> fulfilled, before the <HI>Trumpets</HI> begin. Nor yet is the Seventh <HI>Trumpet</HI> wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, before the <HI>Phials</HI> are poured out. Only the be∣ginning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Part goes before the Beginning of the following. Thus the Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es begin before the Seals, the Seals before the Trum∣pets, the Trumpets before the Phials. One Epistle begins before another, one Seal before another, one Trumpet especially before another, one Phial before another. Yet sometimes what begins later than another Thing, ends sooner; and what begins earlier than <PB N="262" REF="046353_0261_102111AD0106F080"/> another Thing, ends later. So the seventh Trumpet begins earlier than the Phials, and yet extends beyond them all.—<HI>The seven angels which stood before</HI> GOD—a Character of the highest Emmence, <HI>and seven trumpets were given them</HI>—When Men desire to make known openly a Thing of public Concern, they give a Token that may be seen or heard far and wide: and among such none are more ancient than Trumpets, (<HI>Lev.</HI> xxv. 9. <HI>Numb.</HI> x. 2. <HI>Amos</HI> iii. 6.) The <HI>Israelites</HI> in particular used them, both in the Worship of GOD and in War, therewith openly praising the Power of GOD, before, after, and in the Battle (<HI>Josh.</HI> vi. 4. 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> xiii. 14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) And the Angels here made known by these Trumpets, the wonderful Works of GOD, whereby all opposing Powers are successively shaken, till the Kingdom of the World becomes the Kingdom of GOD and his anointed.</P>
<P>These Trumpets reach nearly from the Time of St. <HI>John.</HI> to the End of the World: And they are distinguished by manifest Tokens. The Place of the four first is specified, namely, East, West, South, and North successively: In the three last, immediately after the Time of each, the Place likewise is pointed cut.</P>
<P>The Seventh Angel did not begin to sound, till after the going forth of the Second Wo: But the Trumpets were given to him and the other six together (as were afterward the Phials to the seven An∣gels) And it is accordingly said of all the Seven together, that <HI>they prepared themselves to sound.</HI> These therefore were not Men, as some have thought, but Angels properly so called.</P>

<P>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall∣ing from heaven to the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And he opened the bottomless pit, and there ascended a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And out of the smoke there came forth locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of
<PB N="268" REF="046353_0267_102111BCA6947700"/>the earth have power:
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And it was commanded them, not to hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads. And it was given them,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> not to kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and the tor∣ment of them <HI>is</HI> as the torment of a scorpion, when he stingeth a man.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And in those days the men shall seek death, but not find it; and shall desire to die, but death will flee from them.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> And the appearances of the locusts <HI>are</HI> like horses made ready for battle; and on their heads <HI>are</HI> as it were crowns like gold, and their faces <HI>are</HI> as the faces of men.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were
<PB N="269" REF="046353_0268_102111BEF72A7F60"/>as <HI>the teeth</HI> of lions.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And they had breast-plates, as it were breast-plates of iron, and the noise of their wings <HI>was</HI> as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> And they have tails like scorpi∣ons, and stings were in their tails; their power <HI>is</HI> to hurt men five months.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And they have over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit: his name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he hath the name Apollyon.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> One wo is past: behold there come yet two woes after these things.</P>
<P>And the sixth angel sounded,

<MILESTONE N="20"/> And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear,

<P>Ch. x. From the first Verse of this Chapter to ch. xi. 13. Prepa∣ration is made for the important Trumpet of the seventh Angel. It consists of two Parts, which run parallel to each other: the former reaches from the first to the seventh Verse of this Chapter; the latter from the eighth of this to the thirteenth Verse of the eleventh Chap∣ter: Whence also the sixth Verse of this Chapter is parallel to the ele∣venth Verse. The Period to which both these refer begins during the second Wo, (as appears ch. xi. 14.) but being once begun, it extends in a continued Course far into the Trumpet of the seventh Angel. Hence many Things are represented here, which are not fulfilled till long after. So the joyful <HI>Consummation of the mystery of</HI> GOD is spo∣ken of in the seventh Verse of this Chapter, which yet is not till after <HI>the consummation of the wrath of</HI> GOD, ch. xv. 1.

Therefore the Angel comprizes in his Posture and in his Oath, both Heaven, Sea, and Earth, and makes on the Part of the Eternal GOD and Almighty Creator, a solemn Protestation, that he will assert his kingly Authority against all his Enemies. <HI>He lifted up his right hand toward heaven</HI>—The Angel in <HI>Daniel,</HI> ch. xii. 7.

It is the Trumpet of the seventh Angel alone, which is confirmed by so high an Oath, <HI>by him that liveth for ever and ever</HI>—Before whom a thousand Years are but a Day, <HI>who created the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the things that are therein</HI>—And consequently has the sovereign Power over all: Therefore all his Enemies, tho' they rage a while in Heaven, on the Sea, and on the Earth, yet must give Place to him, <HI>that there shall be no more a time, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of</HI> GOD <HI>shall be fulfilled</HI>—That is, a <HI>time,</HI> a <HI>Chronos</HI> shall not expire, before that Mystery is fulfilled. A <HI>Chronos</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Years) will nearly pass before then, but not quite. The Period then which we may term a <HI>Non-chronos,</HI> (not a whole <HI>time</HI>) must be a little and not much shorter than this. <HI>The Non-chronos</HI> here mentioned seems to begin in the Year 800, (when <HI>Charles the Great</HI> instituted in the West a new Line of Emperors, or of <HI>many kings</HI>) to end in the Year 1836: and to con∣tain among other Things, <HI>the short time</HI> of the third Wo, the <HI>three times and a half</HI> of the Woman in the Wilderness, and <HI>the Duration</HI> of the Beast.</P>

So long as the third Wo remains on the Earth and the Sea, the Mystery of GOD is not fulfilled. And the Angel's swearing is <PB N="275" REF="046353_0274_102111D58247F818"/> peculiarly for the Comfort of holy Men, who are afflicted under that Wo. Indeed the Wrath of GOD must be first fulfilled, by the pouring out of the Phials: and then comes the joyful fulfilling of the My∣stery of GOD. <HI>As he hath declared to his servants the prophets</HI>—The Accomplishment exactly answering the Prediction.

All these seven Trumpets were heard in Heaven: Per∣haps the seventh shall once be heard on Earth also, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> iv. 16. <HI>And there were great voices</HI>—From the several Citizens of Heaven.

But on Earth several dreadful Occurrences are to appear first.

In the Old Testament, from <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Samuel,</HI> GOD himself was the King of his own People. And the same will be in the New Testament: He will himself reign over the <HI>Israel</HI> of GOD, <HI>and of his Christ</HI>—This Appellation is now first given him (since the Introduction of the Book) on the mention of the King∣dom devolving upon him, under the seventh Trumpet. Prophets and Priests were anointed, but more especially Kings: Whence that Term. <HI>The Anointed,</HI> is applied only to a King.

Yet Satan, and the present World with its Kings and Lords, are risen against the Lord and against his Anointed. GOD now puts an End to this monstrous Rebellion, and maintains his Right to all Things. And this appears in an intirely new Man∣ner, as soon as the seventh Angel sounds.</P>

<P>Let him who does not regard the being seized by the Wrath of the Devil, the falling unawares into the General Temptation, the being borne away by the most dreadful Violence into the Worship of the Beast and his Image, and consequently drinking the unmixt Wine of the Wrath of GOD, and being tormented Day and Night for ever and ever in the Lake of Fire and Brimstone: Let him also who is confident, that he can make his Way thro' all these, by his own Wisdom and Strength, without Need of any such peculiar Pre∣servative as the Word of this Prophecy affords: Let him, I say, go hence. But let him who does not take these Warnings for senseless Outcries and blind Alarms, beg of GOD, with all possible Earnestness, to give him his heavenly Light herein.</P>
<P>GOD has not given this Prophecy, in so solemn a Manner, only to shew his Providence over his Church; but also that his Servants may know at all Times in what particular Period they are. And <PB N="287" REF="046353_0286_102111FEC91CCB50"/> the more dangerous any Period of Time is, the greater is the Help which it affords. But where may we fix the Beginning and End of the <HI>little time?</HI> Which is probably four-fifths of a <HI>Chronos,</HI> or some∣what above 888 Years. This, which is the Time of the third Wo, may reach from 947 to the Year 1836. For, 1. The short Interval of the second Wo (which Wo ended in the Year 840) and the 777 Years of the Woman, which began about the Year 84<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, quickly after which followed the War in Heaven, fix the Beginning not long after 864. And thus the third Wo falls in the tenth Century, extending from 900 to 1000, called the <HI>Dark,</HI> the <HI>Iron,</HI> the <HI>uhappy Age.</HI> 2. If we compare the Length of the third Wo, with the Period of Time which succeeds it in the twentieth Chapter, it is but a <HI>little time</HI> to that vast Space which reaches from the Beginning of the <HI>Non-chronos</HI> to the End of the World.</P>

<P>O Reader, this is a Subject, wherein we also are deeply concern∣ed; and which must be treated, not as a Point of Curiosity, but as a solemn Warning from GOD. The Danger is near. Be armed both against Force and Fraud, even with the whole Armour of GOD.<HI>Out of the sea</HI>—That is <HI>Europe.</HI> So the three Woes (the first being in <HI>Persia,</HI> the second about the <HI>Euphrates</HI>) move in a Line from East to West. This Beast is the <HI>Romish Papacy,</HI> as it came to a Point Six Hundred Years since, stands now, and will for some Time lon∣ger. To this, and no other Power on Earth agrees the whole Text, and every Part of it, in every Point: As me may see with the ut∣most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dence, from the Propositions following.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. It is one and the same Beast, having seven Heads, and ten Horns, which is described in this and in the xviith Chapter. Of Consequence his Heads are the same, and his Horns also.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 2. This Beast is a spiritually-secular Power, opposite to the Kingdom of Christ. A Power not merely Spiritual or Ecclesiastical, nor merely Secular or Political; but a Mixture of both. He is a Se∣cular Prince; for a Crown, yea and a Kingdom are ascribed to him. And yet he is not merely Secular. For he is also a <HI>false Prophet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 3. The Beast has a strict Connexion with the City of <HI>Rome.</HI> This clearly appears from the xviith Chapter.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 4. The Beast is now existing. He is not past: for <HI>Rome</HI> is now existing: And it is not till after the Destruction of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Beast is thrown into the Lake. He is not altoge∣ther to come. For the second Wo is long since past, after which the third came quickly. And presently after it began, the Beast rose out of the Sea. Therefore, whatever he is, he is now existing.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 5. The Beast is the <HI>Romish Papacy.</HI> This manifestly follows from the Third and Fourth Propositions; the Beast has a strict Con∣nexion with the City of <HI>Rome;</HI> and the Beast is now existing. Therefore either there is some other Power more strictly connected with that City, or the Pope is the Beast.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 6. The Papacy or Papal Kingdom began long ago.</P>
<P>The most remarkable Particulars relating to this, are here subjoin∣ed; taken so high as abundantly to shew the Rise of the Beast, and brought down as low as our own Time, in order to throw a Light on the following Part of the Prophecy.</P>

<P>He who compares this short Table with what will be observed ver. 3. and ch. xvii. 10. will see that the Ascent of the Beast out of the Sea, must needs be fixed toward the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eginning of it: and not higher than <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. nor lower than <HI>Alexander</HI> III.</P>
<P>The secular Princes now favoured the Kingdom of <HI>Christ▪</HI> but the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> vehemently opposed it. These at first were plain Ministers or Pastors of the Christian Congregation at <HI>Rome,</HI> but by Degrees they rose to an Eminence of Honour and Power over all their Brethren: Till, about the Time of <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. (and so ever since) they assumed all the Ensigns of Royal Majesty: yea of a Majesty and Power far superior to that of all other Potentates on Earth.</P>
<P>We are not here considering their false Doctrines, but their un∣bounded Power. When we think of those, we are to look at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h∣false Prophet,</HI> who is also termed <HI>a wild B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast</HI> at his Ascent out of the Earth. But the First Beast then properly arose when, after se∣veral Preludes thereto, the Pope raised himself above the Emperor.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 7. <HI>Hildebrand</HI> or <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. is the proper Founder of the Papal Kingdom. All the Patrons of the Papacy allow, that he <PB N="292" REF="046353_0291_1021120F328D21B0"/> made many considerable Additions to it: And this very Thing con∣stituted the Beast, by compleating the Spiritual Kingdom: the New Maxims and the New Actions of <HI>Gregory,</HI> all proclaim this. Some of his Maxims are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> alone is Universal Bishop:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That he alone can depose Bishops, or receive them again:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That he alone has Power to make new Laws in the Church:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That he alone ought to use the Ensigns of Royalty:</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That all Princes ought to kiss his Foot:</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That the Name of Pope is <HI>the only Name under Heaven;</HI> and that his Name alone should be recited in the Churches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That he has a Power to depose Emperors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That no General Synod can be convened but by Him:</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That no Book is Canonical without his Authority:</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. That none upon Earth can repeal his Sentence, but he alone can repeal any Sentence:</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. That he is subject to no Human Judgment:</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. That no Power dare to pass Sentence on one who appeals to the Pope:</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. That all weighty Causes every where ought to be referred to Him:</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. That the <HI>Roman</HI> Church never did, nor ever can err:</ITEM>
<ITEM>15. That the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop canonically ordained, is immediately made Holy, by the Merits of St. <HI>Peter:</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>16. That he can absolve Subjects from their Allegiance.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These, the most eminent <HI>Romish</HI> Writers own to be his genuine Sayings. And his Actions agree with his Words. Hitherto the Popes had been subject to the Emperors, tho' often unwillingly. But now the Pope began himself, under a Spiritual Pretext, to act the Em∣peror of the whole Christian World: the immediate Dispute was about the Investure of Bishops, the Right of which each claimed to himself. And now was the Time, for the Pope either to give up or establish his Empire for ever. To decide which, <HI>Gregory</HI> excom∣municated the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> IV. "having first, says <HI>Platina,</HI> de∣prived him of all his Dignities." The Sentence ran in these Terms: "Blessed <HI>Peter,</HI> Prince of the Apostles, incline I beseech thee, thine Ears, and hear me thy Servant—in the Name of the Omnipotent GOD, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, I cast down the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> from all Imperial and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egal Authority, and absolve all Christians, that were his Subjects, from the Oath whereby they used to swear Allegiance to true Kings.

<P>The some Sentence he repeated at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome</HI> in these Terms. "Blessed <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Prince of the Apostles, and thou <HI>Paul,</HI> Teacher of the Gentiles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beseech you, your Ears to me, and graciously hear me—<HI>Henry,</HI> whom they call Emperor, hath proudly lifted up his Horns and his Head against the Church of GOD—who came to me, humbly imploring to be absolved from his Excommunication—I restored him to Communion, but not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Kingdom,—neither did I allow his Subjects to return to their Allegiance. Several Bishops and Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> taking <PB N="293" REF="046353_0292_102112110636A708"/> this Opportunity, in the Room of <HI>Henry,</HI> justly deposed, chose <HI>Ro∣dulph</HI> Emperor: Who immediately sent Ambassadors to me, inform∣ing me—That he would rather obey me, than accept of a Kingdom; and that he should always remain at the Disposal of GOD and us— <HI>Henry</HI> then began to be angry, and at first intreated us, to hinder <HI>Ro∣dulph</HI> from seizing his Kingdom. I said, I would see to whom the Right belonged—and give Sentence, which should be preferred. <HI>Henry</HI> forbad this—Therefore I bind <HI>Henry</HI> and all his Favourers with the Bond of an Anathema, and again take from him all Regal Power. I absolve all Christians from their Oath of Allegiance, forbid them to obey <HI>Henry</HI> in any Thing, and command them to receive <HI>Rodulph</HI> as their King. Confirm this therefore by your Authority, ye most holy Princes of the Apostles, that all may now at length know, as ye have Power to bind and loose in Heaven, so we have Power to give and take away on Earth, Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, and whatsoever Men can have."</P>
<P>When <HI>Henry</HI> submitted, then <HI>Gregory</HI> began to reign without con∣troul. In the same Year 1077, on <HI>September;,</HI> he fixt a new Aera of Time called <HI>the Indiction;</HI> used at <HI>Rome</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>Thus did the Pope claim to himself the whole Authority over all Christian Princes. Thus did he take away or confer Kingdoms and Empires, as a King of Kings. Neither did his Successors fail to tread in his Steps. It is well known, the following Popes have not been wanting to exercise the same Power, both over Kings and Em∣perors. And this the later Popes have been so far from disclaiming, that three of them have sainted this very <HI>Gregory,</HI> namely, <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. <HI>Paul</HI> V. and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nedict</HI> XIII. Here is then the Beast, that is, the King: in Fact such, though not in Name; according to that remarkable Observation of Cardinal <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> "Antichrist will govern the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, yet without the Name of <HI>Roman</HI> Empe∣ror." His spiritual Title prevented his taking the Name, while he exerciseth all the Power. Now <HI>Gregory</HI> was at the Head of this No∣velty. So <HI>Aventine,</HI> himself, "<HI>Gregory</HI> VII. was the first Founder of the Pontifical Empire."</P>
<P>Thus the Time of the Ascent of the Beast is clear. The Apostacy and Mystery of Iniquity gradually increased, till he arose, who <HI>op∣poseth and exalteth himself above all.</HI> (2 <HI>Thes.</HI> ii. 3.) Before the seventh Trumpet the Adversary wrought more secretly. But soon after the Beginning of this, the Beast openly opposes his Kingdom to the Kingdom of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 8. The Empire of <HI>Hildebrand</HI> properly began in the Year 1077. Then it was, that upon the Emperor's leaving <HI>Italy, Gregory</HI> exercised his Power to the full. And on the 1st of <HI>September,</HI> in this Year, he began his famous <HI>Epocha.</HI></P>
<P>This may be farther established and explained by the following Observations.</P>
<LIST>

<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 4. The Ascent of the Beast out of the Sea is different from his Ascent out of the Abyss: <HI>the Revelation</HI> often mentions both the Sea and the Abyss; but never uses the Terms promiscuously.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 5. The Heads of the Beast do not begin <HI>before</HI> his Rise out of the Sea, but <HI>with</HI> it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 6. These Heads, as Kings, succeed each other.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 7. The Time which they take up in this Succession, is di∣vided into three Parts. <HI>Five</HI> of the Kings signified thereby <HI>are fall∣en: One is: the other is not yet come.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 8. <HI>One is:</HI> Namely, while the Angel was speaking this.

<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 9. The Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ance of the Beast is divided in the same Man∣ner. The Beast <HI>was: is not: will ascend out of the abyss,</HI> ch. xvii. ver. 8. and 11. Between these two Verses, that is interposed as parallel with them, <HI>Five are fallen: one is: the other is not yet come.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 10. <HI>Babylon</HI> is <HI>Rome.</HI> All Things which <HI>the Revelation</HI> says of <HI>Babylon,</HI> agree to <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> only. It commenced <HI>Babylon,</HI> when it commenced <HI>The Great.</HI> When <HI>Babylon</HI> sunk in the East, it arose in the West. And it existed in the Time of the Apostles, whose <HI>Judgment</HI> is said to be <HI>avenged on her.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 11. The Beast reigns both before and after the Reign of <HI>Ba∣bylon.</HI> First, the Beast reigns, ch. xiii. 1, &amp;c. then <HI>Babylon,</HI> ch. xvii. 1, &amp;c. and then the Beast again, ch. xvii. 8, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 12. The Heads are of the Substance of the Beast: the Horns are not. The Wounds of one of the Heads, is called <HI>the wound of the Beast</HI> itself, ver. 3. but the Horns, or Kings, receive the King∣dom <HI>with the Beast,</HI> ch. xvii. 12. That Word alone, <HI>The horns and the beast,</HI> ch. xvii. 16. sufficiently shews them to be something added to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 13. The forty-two Months of the Beast fall within the first of the three Periods. The Beast rose out of the Sea in the Year 1077. A little after<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power was given him for forty-two Months. This Power is still in being.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 14. The Time when the Beast <HI>is not,</HI> and the Reign of <HI>Ba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> are together. The Beast when risen out of the Sea raged vio∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tly, till <HI>his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom was darkened</HI> by the fifth Phial. But it was a Kingdom still, and the Beast having a Kingdom, tho' darke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, was the Beast still. But it was afterwards said, <HI>the beast was,</HI> (was the Beast, that is, reigned) <HI>and is not:</HI> is not the Beast; does not reign, having lost his Kingdom. Why? Because <HI>the woman sits up∣on the beast,</HI> who <HI>sits a queen,</HI> reigning over the Kings of the Earth: Till the Beast rising out of the Abyss, and taking with him the ten Kings, suddenly destroys her.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 15. The Difference there is between <HI>Rome</HI> and the Pope, which has always subsisted, will then be most apparent. <HI>Rome</HI> dis∣tinct from the Pope, bears three Meanings, the City itself, the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> <PB N="295" REF="046353_0294_10211218C17D7070"/> Church, and the People of <HI>Rome.</HI> In the last Sense of the World, <HI>Rome</HI> with its Dutchy, which contained Part of <HI>Tuscany</HI> and <HI>Campania</HI> revolted from the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperor in 726, and became a free State, governed by its Senate. From this Time the Senate, and not tho Pope, enjoyed the Supreme Civil Power. But in 796 <HI>Leo</HI> III. being chosen Pope, sent to <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> desiring him to come and subdue the Senate and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> and constrain them to swear Allegiance to him. Hence arose a sharp Contention between the Pope and the <HI>Roman</HI> People, who seized and thrust him into a Mo∣nastry. He escaped and fled to the Emperor, who quickly sent him back in great State. In the Year 800 the Emperor came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and shortly after, the <HI>Roman</HI> People, who had hitherto chosen their own Bishops, and looked upon themselves and their Senate as having the same Rights with the ancient Senate and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> chose <HI>Charles</HI> for their Emperor, and subjected themselves to him, in the same Manner as the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> did to their Emperors. The Pope crowned him and paid him Homage on his Knees, as was formerly done to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors: And the Emperor took an Oath "to defend the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church in all its Emoluments." He was also created Consul, and styled himself thenceforward <HI>Agustus, Emperor of the Romans.</HI> Afterwards he gave the Govern∣ment of the City and Dutchy of <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope, yet still subject to himself.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 16. In the First and Second Period of his Duration, the Beast is a Body of Men, in the Third, an Individual. The Beast with seven Heads is the Papacy of many Ages: The Seventh Head is the Man of Sin, Antichrist. He is a Body of Men from ch. xiii. 1. to xvii. 7. He is a Body of Men and an Individual, ch. xvii. from the Eighth to the Eleventh Verse. He is an Individual, from ch. xvii. 12. to ch. xix. 20.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Obs.</HI> 23. <HI>Daniel</HI>'s fourth Beast is the <HI>Roman</HI> Monarchy, from the Beginning of it, till <HI>the throned are set.</HI> This therefore comprizes both the Apocalyptic Beast, and the Woman, and many other Things. This Monarchy is like a River which runs from its Foun∣tain in one Channel, but in its Course sometimes takes in other Ri∣vers, sometimes is itself parted into several Streams, yet is still one continued River. The <HI>Roman</HI> Power was at first undivided. But it was afterwards divided into various Channels, till the Grand Divi∣sion into the Eastern and Western Empires, which likewise under∣went various Changes. Afterward the <HI>Kings</HI> of the <HI>Heru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Goths, Lombards,</HI> the Exarchs of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves; the Emperors, <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>German,</HI> besides other Kings, seized several Parts of the <HI>Roman</HI> Power. Now whatever Power the <HI>Romans</HI> had before <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. that <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Beast contains. Whatever Power the Papacy has had from <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. this the Apocalyptic Beast repre∣sents. But this very Beast, (and so <HI>Rome</HI> with its last Authority) is com∣prehended under that of <HI>Daniel. And upon his heads a name of blasphemy</HI> —To ascribe to a Man what belongs to GOD alone is blasphemy. Such a Name the Beast has, not on his Horns, nor on one Head, but on all. The Beast himself bears that Name, and indeed through his whole Duration. This is the Name of <HI>Papa</HI> or <HI>Pope;</HI> not in the innocent Sense wherein it was formerly given to all Bishops, but in that high and peculiar Sense wherein it is now given to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> by himself, and his Followers: A Name which comprizes the whole Pre-eminence of the highest and most Holy Father upon Earth. Accordingly among the above-cited Sayings of <HI>Gregory,</HI> those two stand together, that his <HI>Name alone should be recited in the Churches:</HI> and that it is <HI>the only Name in the World.</HI> So both the Church and the World were to name no other Father on the Face of the Earth.</ITEM>

<P><LABEL>V. 3.</LABEL> <HI>And I saw one</HI>—Or the first, <HI>of his heads as it were wound∣ed</HI>—So it appeared as soon as ever it rose. The Beast is first describ∣ed more generally, then more particularly, both in this and in the xviith chap. The particular Description here, respects the former Parts: there, the latter Parts of his Duration: Only that some Cir∣cumstances relating to the former, are repeated in the xviith chap.</P>
<P>This deadly Wound was given him on his <HI>first</HI> Head <HI>by the sword,</HI> (ver. 14.) that is, by the bloody Resistance of the secular Potentates, particularly the <HI>German</HI> Emperors. These had for a long Season had the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> with her Bishop, under their Jurisdiction. <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> determined to cast off this Yoke from his own, and to lay it on the Emperor's Shoulders. He broke loose and excommunicated the Emperor, who maintained his Right by force, and gave the Pope such a Blow, that one would have thought the Beast must have been killed thereby, immediately after his coming up. But he recovered and grew stronger than before. The first Head of the Beast extends from <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. at least to <HI>Innocent</HI> III. In that Tract of Time the Beast was much wounded by the Emperors. But notwithstand∣ing, <HI>the wound was healed.</HI></P>
<P>Two deadly Symptoms attended this Wound, 1. Schisms and open Ruptures in the Church. For while the Emperors asserted their Right, there were from the Year 1080 to the Year 1176 only, five open Divisions, and at least as many Antipopes, some of whom were indeed the rightful Popes. This was highly dangerous to the Papal Kingdoms. But a still more dangerous Symptom was, 2. The rising of the Nobility at <HI>Rome,</HI> who would not suffer their Bishop to be a secular Prince, particularly over themselves. Under <HI>Innocent</HI> II. they carried their Point, re-established the ancient Common-wealth, took away from the Pope the Government of the City, and left him only his episcopal Authority. "At this, says the Historian, <HI>Innocent</HI> II. and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lestine</HI> II. fretted themselves to Death: <HI>Lucius</HI> II. as he attacked the Capitol wherein the Senate was, Sword in Hand, was struck with a Stone, and died in a few Days: <HI>Engenius</HI> III. <HI>Alexander</HI> III. and <HI>Lucius</HI> III. were driven out of the City: <HI>Urban</HI> III. and <HI>Gregory</HI> VIII. spent their Days in Banishment Atlength they came to an Agreement with <HI>Clonent</HI> III. who was himself a <HI>Roman."

<P><LABEL>V. 8.</LABEL> <HI>And another angel followed—saying, Babylon is fallen</HI>— With the Overthrow of <HI>Babylon,</HI> that of all the Enemies of Christ, and consequently happier Times are connected. <HI>Babylon the great</HI>— So the City of <HI>Rome</HI> is called upon many Accounts. <HI>Babylon</HI> was mag∣nificent, strong, proud, powerful. So is <HI>Rome</HI> also. <HI>Babylon</HI> was first, <HI>Rome</HI> afterwards, the Residence of the Emperors of the World. What <HI>Babylon</HI> was to <HI>Israel</HI> of old, <HI>Rome</HI> hath been both to the literal and spiritual <HI>Israel of</HI> GOD. Hence the Liberty of the ancient <HI>Jews</HI> was connected with the Overthrow of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Empire. And when <HI>Rome</HI> is finally overthrown, then the People of GOD will be at Liberty.</P>
<P>Whenever <HI>Babylon</HI> is mentioned in this Book, <HI>the Great,</HI> is added; to teach us, That <HI>Rome</HI> then commenced <HI>Babylon,</HI> when it com∣menced <HI>the Great City;</HI> when it swallowed up the <HI>Grecian</HI> Monarchy and its Fragments, <HI>Syria</HI> in particular; and in consequence of this, obtained Dominion over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> about sixty Years before the Birth of Christ.

<P><HI>Her fornication</HI> is, Her Idolatry, Invocation of Saints and Angels, Worship of Images, Human Traditions, with all that outward Pomp, yea, and that fierce and bloody Zeal wherewith she pretends to serve <PB N="304" REF="046353_0303_10211236D8623000"/> GOD. But with spiritual Fornication, as elsewhere, so in <HI>Rome.</HI> Fleshly Fornication is joined abundantly.

<P>Of this <HI>Wine she hath</HI> indeed <HI>made all Nations drink,</HI> more especially by her later Missions. We may observe this <HI>making them drink</HI> is not ascribed to the Beast but to <HI>Babylon.</HI> For <HI>Rome</HI> itself, the <HI>Roman Inquisitions, Congregations,</HI> and <HI>Jesuits,</HI> continually propagate their idolatrous Doctrines and Practices, with or without the Consent of this or that Pope, who himself is not secure from their Censure.</P>

<P>And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go, pour out the seven phials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
<PB N="309" REF="046353_0308_10211249A7D66CE0"/>And the first went and poured out his phial upon the earth,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> and there came a grievous ulcer on the men that had the mark of the wild beast, and that worshipped his image.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And the second poured out his phial upon the sea, and it became blood, as <HI>the blood</HI> of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And the third poured out his phial on the rivers and on fountains of waters, and they became blood.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art, and who wast, the Gracious one; because thou hast judged thus.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them
<PB N="310" REF="046353_0309_1021124E5786C420"/>blood to drink.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> They are worthy. And I heard <HI>another</HI> from the altar, saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty; true and righteous <HI>are</HI> thy judgments. And the fourth poured out his phial upon the sun;
<MILESTONE N="8"/> and it was given him to scorch the men with fire.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And the men were scorched exceedingly, and blasphemed the name of God, who had power over these plagues: but they repented not to give him glory.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> And the fifth poured out his phial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his king∣dom was darkened.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of hea∣ven, because of their pains, and because of their ulcers,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> and repented not of their works. And the sixth poured out his phial upon the great river
<PB N="311" REF="046353_0310_1021124FE2AF4D90"/>Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be pre∣pared.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And I saw out of the mouth of the dra∣gon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three un∣clean spirits like frogs,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> go forth, (They are spirits of devils, working miracles) to the kings of the whole world, to gather them unto the battle of the great day of GOD,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> the Almighty. (Behold I come as a thief. Happy is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
<PB N="312" REF="046353_0311_10211252F3AE7FD0"/>shame).
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And they gathered them together to the place, which is called in the Hebrew Armaged∣don.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> And the seventh poured out his phial upon the air, and there went forth a loud voice out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were lightnings,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> and voices, and thun∣ders, and a great earthquake; such as had not been since men were upon the earth, such an earth∣quake,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> so great. And the great city was <HI>split</HI> into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the Great was remembered before GOD, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And a great hail, every hail-stone about the weight of a talent, falleth out of heaven upon the men; and the men blas∣phemeth GOD, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.</P>

<P>And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven phials, and talked with me, say∣ing, Come hither, I will shew thee the judgment of the great whore, that sitteth upon many waters: With whom the kings of the earth have commit∣ted fornication,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her forni∣cation.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, hav∣ing seven heads and ten horns.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And the woman
<PB N="314" REF="046353_0313_102107D483C7BE30"/>was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup, full of abomination and filthiness of her fornication:
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And on her fore∣head a name written, Mystery; Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw, I wondered exceed∣ingly.</P>
<P>And the angel said to me,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. The wild beast which thou sawest,
<MILESTONE N="8"/> was, and is not,
<PB N="315" REF="046353_0314_1021125C9E8B3AA8"/>and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth, (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder when they behold the wild beast, that he was, and is not,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> and yet will be. Here <HI>is</HI> the mind that hath wisdom.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sitteth, and they are seven kings: five are fallen: one is, the other is not yet come; when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
<PB N="316" REF="046353_0315_1021125E384AD7C8"/>And the wild beast that was,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven and goeth into per∣dition.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not received the kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the
<PB N="317" REF="046353_0316_102112609F692340"/>wild beast.
<MILESTONE N="13"/> These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the wild beast.
<MILESTONE N="14"/> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall o∣vercome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that <HI>are</HI> with him <HI>are</HI> called, and chosen, and faithful.</P>
<P>And he saith to me,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are people, and multitudes,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> and nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the wild beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her de∣solate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
<MILESTONE N="17"/> For God hath put <HI>it</HI> into their hearts, to execute his sentence, and to agree and to give their kingdom to the wild beast, till the words of God shall be fulfilled.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> And the wo∣man whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</P>

<P>Perhaps the First Head of the Beast is the <HI>Coelian</HI> Hill, and an it the <HI>Lateran</HI> with <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. and his Successors: The Second the <HI>Vatican,</HI> with the Church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> chosen by <HI>Boniface</HI> VIII: The Third, the <HI>Quirinal,</HI> with the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and the <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>val</HI> Palace built by <HI>Paul</HI> II. and the Fourth the <HI>Exquiline</HI> Hill, with the Temple of St. <HI>Maria Maggiore,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> V. reigned.

Accordingly in the Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Regis∣ter, four Periods are observable since <HI>Gregory</HI> VII.

Not that one Hill was deserted, when another was made the Papal Residence; but a new one was added to the other sacred Palaces.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Times hitherto mentioned might be fixed thus:<LIST>
<ITEM>1058. Wings are given to the Woman.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Fall of</HI> those <HI>five kings</HI> seems to imply, not only the Death of the Popes who reigned on those Hills, but also such a disannulling of all they had done there, that it will be said, The Beast <HI>is not:</HI> the Royal Power, which had so long been lodged in the Pope, being then transferred to the City—<HI>One is, the other is not yet come</HI>—These two are remarkably distinguished from the five preceding, whom they succeed in their Turns.

<P>And after these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was enlightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a loud voice,
<MILESTONE N="2"/> saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is be∣come an habitation of devils, and an hold of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> For all nations have drank of the wine of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich, through the abundance of her delicacies.</P>
<P>And I heard another voice out of heaven say∣ing,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> For her sins have reached even to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

<MILESTONE N="8"/> death, and sorrow, and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong <HI>is</HI> the Lord God who judgeth her.
<MILESTONE N="9"/> And the kings of the earth, who had committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas! Thou great city Babylon, thou strong city! In one hour is thy judgment come.
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her; for none

<MILESTONE N="14"/> And the fruits which thy soul desireth are departed from thee, and all things that were dainty and splendid are pe∣rished from thee, and thou shalt find them no more. The merchants of these things who became rich by her,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> Saying, Alas, alas! The great city that was clothed in fine linen, and pur∣ple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and pre∣cious stone, and pearl: in one hour so great riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are become desolate.

<MILESTONE N="18"/> and all who trade by sea, stood afar off, And
<PB N="321" REF="046353_0320_102107DBACB0F2D0"/>cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> What <HI>city was</HI> like the great city? And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas! The great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her magnificence; for in one hour she is made desolate.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and apostles, and pro∣phets; for God hath avenged you on her.</P>
<P>And a mighty angel took up a stone,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> like a great mill-stone, and threw <HI>it</HI> into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
<MILESTONE N="22"/> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no artificer of any kind shall be found any more, in thee, and the sound of a mill∣stone

<P>After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah:
<PB N="323" REF="046353_0322_10211271EF862340"/>The salvation, and the glory, and the power to our GOD.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> For true and righteous <HI>are</HI> his judg∣ments: for he hath judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. (And again they said Hallelujah) and her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> <MILESTONE N="4"/> And the four and twenty elders, and the four living creatures fell down, and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying,
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Amen, Hallelujah. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, small and great.
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord God,
<MILESTONE N="7"/> the Almighty reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him; for
<PB N="324" REF="046353_0323_1021127379B34D20"/>the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And it is given to her, to be arrayed in fine linen, white and clean; the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.</P>
<P>And he saith to me,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Write: Happy <HI>are</HI> they who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true sayings of God.
<MILESTONE N="10"/> And I fell before his feet to wor∣ship him, but he saith to me, See <HI>thou do it</HI> not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that keep the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>And I saw the heaven opened,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> and behold a white horse, and he that sitteth on him, called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he judg∣eth
<PB N="325" REF="046353_0324_10211275155EA078"/>and maketh war.
<MILESTONE N="12"/> His eyes <HI>are</HI> a flame of fire, and upon his head <HI>are</HI> many diadems, and he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself. And he <HI>is</HI> clothed in a vesture dipt in blood,
<MILESTONE N="13"/> and his name is called,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> The Word of GOD. And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses,
<MILESTONE N="15"/> clothed in clean, fine linen. And out of his mouth goeth forth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he might smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of GOD,
<MILESTONE N="16"/> the Almighty. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> and Lord of lords. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
<PB N="326" REF="046353_0325_10211278395F8BB8"/>voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the great supper of GOD.
<MILESTONE N="18"/> That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chief captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that fit on them, and the flesh of all men, both freemen and slaves, both small and great. And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> to make war with him that sat on the horse and with his army.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> And the wild beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought the mira∣cles before him, with which he had deceived them who had the mark of the wild beast, and them who had worshipped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brim∣stone.
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which went forth

From the Series of the whole Book, representing one continued Chain of Events: 2. From the Circumstances which precede. The Wo∣man's bringing forth is followed, by the casting of the Dragon out of Heaven to the Earth. With this is connected the Third Wo, where∣by the Dragon through, and with the Beast, rages horribly. At the Conclusion of the Third Wo the Beast is overthrown and cast into the <HI>lake of five.</HI> At the same Time the other grand Enemy, the Dragon, shall be bound and shut up. 3. These thousand Years bring a new, full, and lasting Immunity from all outward and in∣ward Evils (the Authors of which are now removed) and an Afflu∣ence of all Blessings. But such a Time the Church has never yet seen. Therefore it is still to come. 4. These thousand Years are followed by the last Times of the World, the letting loose of Satan, who ga∣thers together <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> and is thrown to the Beast and false Prophet in <HI>the lake of fire.</HI> Now Satan's accusing the Saints in Hea∣ven, his Rage on Earth, his Imprisonment in the Abyss, his seduc∣ing <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> and being cast into the Lake of Fire, evidently succeed each other. 5. What occurs from ch. xx. 11. to ch. xxii. 5. manifestly follows the Things related in the xixth Chapter. The thousand Years came between: whereas if they were past, neither the Beginning nor the End of them would fall within this Period. <PB N="328" REF="046353_0327_10211281382A5F48"/> In a short Time those who assert, that they are now at hand, will appear to have spoken the Truth. Mean Time let every Man con∣sider, what Kind of Happiness he expects therein. The Danger does not lie, in maintaining, that the thousand Years are yet to come, but in interpreting them, whether past or to come, in a gross and carnal Sense. The Doctrine of the Son of GOD is a Mystery. So is his Cross: And so is his Glory. In all these he is a Sign that is spoken against. Happy they who believe and confess him in all.</P>

We are very shortly to expect, one after another, the Calamities occasioned by the second Beast, the Harvest and the Vintage; the pouring out of the Phials, the Judgment of <HI>Babylon:</HI> the last raging of the Beast and his Destruction; the Imprisonment of Satan. How great Things these! And how short the Time! What is needful for us? Wisdom, Patience, Faithfulness, Watchfulness. It is no Time to settle upon our Lees. This is not, if it be rightly understood, an acceptable Message to the Wise, the Mighty, the Honourable of this World. Yet that which is to be done, shall be done. There is no Counsel against the Lord.</P>

One Kind of Death, which was particularly inflicted at <HI>Rome,</HI> is mentioned for all, <HI>for the testi∣mony of Jesus, and for the word of</HI> GOD—The Martyrs were some∣times killed <HI>for the word of</HI> GOD in general, sometimes particularly <HI>for the testimony of Jesus:</HI> the one, while they refused to worship Idols; the other, while they confessed the Name of Christ, <HI>and those who had not worshipped the wild beast nor his image</HI>—These seem to be a Company distinct from those who appeared, ch. xv. 2. Those <HI>overcame,</HI> probably, in such Contests as these had not. Before the Number of the Beast was expired, the People were compelled to worship him, by the most dreadful Violence. But when the Beast <HI>was not,</HI> they were only seduced into it, by the Craft of the false Prophet, <HI>and they lived</HI>—Their Souls and Bodies being re-united, <HI>and reigned with Christ</HI>—Not on Earth, but in Heaven. The <HI>reigning on earth,</HI> mentioned ch. xi. 15. is quite different from this, <HI>a thousand years</HI>—It must be observed, That two distinct thousand Years, are mentioned throughout this whole Passage. Each is men∣tioned thrice; the thousand wherein Satan is bound, ver. 2, 3. 7. the thousand wherein the Saints shall reign, ver. 4, 5, 6. The for∣mer end before the End of the World; the latter reach to the Gene∣ral Resurrection. So that the Beginning and End of the former thousand, is before the Beginning and End of the latter. Therefore as in the second Verse, at the first Mention of the former, so in the fourth Verse at the first Mention of the latter, it is only said <HI>a thou∣sand</HI> Years: in the other Places, <HI>the thousand</HI> (ver. 3. 5. 7.) that is, the thousand mentioned before. During the former, the Pro∣mises concerning the flourishing State of the Church (ch. x. 7.) shall be fulfilled. During the latter, while the Saints reign with Christ in Heaven, Men on Earth will be careless and secure.</P>

<P>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away: and there was no more sea.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
<PB N="333" REF="046353_0332_1021128FBA522530"/>And I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying,
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Be∣hold the tabernacle of God with men, and he will pitch his tent with them; and they shall be his people, and God himself <HI>shall be</HI> with them, <HI>and be</HI> their God. And he shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,
<MILESTONE N="4"/> and death shall be no more, neither shall sorrow, or cry∣ing, or pain be any more; because the former things are gone away.
<MILESTONE N="5"/> And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And he saith to me, Write: these sayings are faithful and true. And he said to me,
<MILESTONE N="6"/> It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely.
<MILESTONE N="7"/> He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be to him a God, and he
<PB N="334" REF="046353_0333_102112931211AFC8"/>shall be to me a son.
<MILESTONE N="8"/> But the fearful, and unbeliev∣ing, and abominable, and murderers, and whore∣mongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part <HI>is</HI> in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</P>
<P>And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials full of the seven last plagues,
<MILESTONE N="9"/> and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> the Lamb's wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
<MILESTONE N="11"/> Having the glory of God: her window was like the most precious stone, like a
<PB N="335" REF="046353_0334_10211295E822FA88"/>jasper stone,
<MILESTONE N="12"/> clear as crystal, Having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve an∣gels, and the names written thereon, which are <HI>the names</HI> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
<MILESTONE N="13"/> On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations,
<MILESTONE N="14"/> and upon them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
<MILESTONE N="15"/> And he that talked with me had a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, and

<MILESTONE N="16"/> and the wall thereof. And the city lyeth four square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length, and the breadth,
<MILESTONE N="17"/> and the height of it, are equal. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty-four <HI>reeds,</HI> the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. And the building of the wall thereof was jasper,
<MILESTONE N="18"/> and the city <HI>was</HI> of pure gold,
<MILESTONE N="19"/> like clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation <HI>was</HI> a jasper, the second a sapphire, the third a chal∣cedony,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> the fourth an emerald, The fifth a sardonyx, the sixth a sardius, the seventh a chrysolite, the eighth a beryl, the ninth a topaz, the tenth a chryso∣prase, the eleventh a jacinth, the twelfth an amethyst. And the twelve gates <HI>were</HI> twelve pearls,
<MILESTONE N="21"/> each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city <HI>was</HI> pure gold,
<MILESTONE N="22"/> transparent as glass. And I saw no tem∣ple therein; for the Lord GOD Almighty and the
<PB N="337" REF="046353_0336_1021129C12D19C98"/>Lamb are the temple of it.
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God hath enlightened it, and the Lamb <HI>is</HI> the lamp thereof.
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And the nations shall walk by the light thereof; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
<MILESTONE N="25"/> And the gates of it shall not be shut by day: and there shall be no night there. And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it.
