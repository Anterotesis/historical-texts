<HEAD>AN ESSAY on <HI>COMETS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS an admirable Work of our GOD, that the many <HI>Globes</HI> in the Universe are placed at such Distances, as to avoid all violent Shocks upon one another, and every thing wherein they might prove a prejudice to one another.</P>
<P>Even <HI>Comets</HI> too, move so as to serve the Holy Ends of their Creator! COMETS, which are commonly called <HI>Blazing Stars,</HI> ap∣pear unto later Observations to be a sort of <HI>Excentrical Planets,</HI> that move periodically about the <HI>Sun.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> from whom 'tis a difficult thing to dissent in any thing that belongs to <HI>Philosophy,</HI> concludes, that the Bodies of <HI>Comets</HI> are solid compact, fixed, and durable even like those of the other <HI>Planets.</HI></P>
<P>He has a very critical Thought upon the <HI>Heat,</HI> which these <HI>Bodies</HI> may suffer in their Transits near the <HI>Sun.</HI> A famous one, in the Year 1680, passed so near the <HI>Sun,</HI> that the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in it must be twenty-eight thousand time as intense as it is in <HI>England</HI> at Midsummer; where∣as the Heat of boiling Water, as he tried, is but little more than the dry Earth of that Island, exposed unto the Midsummer-Sun: and the <HI>Heat</HI> of <HI>red-hot Iron</HI> he takes to be three or four times as great as that of <HI>boil∣ing Water.</HI> Wherefore the <HI>Heat</HI> of that <HI>Comet</HI> in its <HI>Perihelion</HI> was near two thousand times as great as that of <HI>red-hot Iron.</HI> If it had been an Aggregate of nothing but Exhalations, the <HI>Sun</HI> would have render'd it invisible. A Globe of <HI>red-hot Iron,</HI> of the Dimensions of our Earth, would scarce be cool, by his Computation, in <HI>Fifty Thousand Years.</HI> If then this <HI>Comet</HI> cooled an hundred times as fast as <HI>red-hot Iron,</HI> yet, since his Heat was <HI>Two Thousand</HI> times greater than that of <HI>red-hot Iron,</HI> if you suppose his Body no greater than that of this Earth, he will not be cool in a Million of Years.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="005389_0003_10182BE868A65B58"/>
The <HI>Tails</HI> of <HI>Comets,</HI> which are longest and largest just after their <HI>Pe∣rihelions,</HI> he takes to be a long and very thin Smoke, or a mighty Train of Vapours, which the ignited <HI>Nucleus,</HI> or the Head of the <HI>Comet,</HI> emits from it. And he easily and thoroughly confounds the silly Notion of their being only the <HI>Beams of the Sun,</HI> shining thro' the Head of the <HI>Star.</HI></P>
<P>The Phaenomena of the <HI>Tails of Comets</HI> depend upon the Motion of their <HI>Heads,</HI> and have their Matter supplied from thence.</P>
<P>There may arise from the Atmosphere of <HI>Comets,</HI> Vapours enough to take up such immense Spaces as we see they do. Computations made of and from the Rarity of our <HI>Air,</HI> which by and by issue in Astonishments, will render this Matter evident.</P>
<P>That the Tails of <HI>Comets</HI> are extremely rare, is apparent from this; the <HI>Fixed Stars</HI> appearing so plainly thro' them.</P>
<P>The Atmosphere of <HI>Comets,</HI> as they descend towards the <HI>Sun,</HI> is very sensibly diminished by their vast running out, that they may afford Mat∣ter to produce the <HI>Blaze. Hevelius</HI> has observed, that their Atmosphere is enlarged, when they do not so much run out into <HI>Tail.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has an Apprehension, which is a little surprizing, That those Vapours which are dilated, and go off in the <HI>Blazes</HI> of <HI>Comets,</HI> and are diffused thro' all the Celestial Regions, may by little and little, by their own proper <HI>Gravity,</HI> be attracted into the <HI>Planets,</HI> and become intermin∣gled with their Atmospheres. As to the Constitution of such an <HI>Earth</HI> as ours, it is necessary there should be <HI>Seas;</HI> thus, for the Conservation of the <HI>Seas,</HI> and Moisture of the Planets, there may be a necessity of <HI>Comets,</HI> from whose condensed Vapours, all that <HI>Moisture,</HI> which is consumed in Vegetations and Putrefactions, and so turned into dry Earth, may by de∣grees be continually supplied, repaired, and recruited. Yea, he has a sus∣picion, that the Spirit, which is the finest, the most subtle, and the very best part of our <HI>Air,</HI> and which is necessarily requisite unto the Life and Being of all Things, comes chiefly from <HI>Comets.</HI> If this be so, the Ap∣pearance of <HI>Comets</HI> is not so dreadful a thing, as the <HI>Cometomantia,</HI> gene∣rally prevailing, has represented it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> will thus far allow bad Presages to <HI>Comets,</HI> That if the Tail of a <HI>Comet</HI> should be too much intermingled with our <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> or if the Matter of it should, by its <HI>Gravity,</HI> fall down upon the Earth; it may induce those Changes in in our <HI>Air,</HI> whereof we should be very sensible.</P>
<P><HI>Bernoulli,</HI> in his <HI>Systema Cometarum,</HI> supposes, That there is a <HI>Primary Planet,</HI> revolving round the <HI>Sun</HI> in the space of four Years and 157 Days; and at the Distance of 2,583 Semidiameters of the <HI>Or∣bis Magnus.</HI> This <HI>Primary Planet,</HI> he supposes, either from his mighty
<PB N="4" REF="005389_0004_10182BEAF0AAFC00"/><HI>Distance,</HI> or his minute <HI>Smallness,</HI> to be not visible unto us; to have several <HI>Satellits</HI> moving round him, tho' none descending so low as the Orbit of <HI>Saturn;</HI> and that these becoming visible to us, when in their <HI>Perigaeon,</HI> are what we call <HI>Comets.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI>'s Prediction, That a Time should come, when our Mysteries of <HI>Comets</HI> should be unfolded, seems almost accomplished. However <HI>Seneca</HI> has not obliged us with the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> observed by him, which en∣couraged this Prediction.</P>
<P>No Histories of <HI>Comets</HI> were of service to the Theory of them, until <HI>Nicephoras Gregoras,</HI> a <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Astronomer, described the Path of a Comet in 1337.</P>
<P>All that considered <HI>Comets</HI> until <HI>Tycho Brabe,</HI> consider'd them as no o∣ther than Vapours below the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>Anon, the sagacious <HI>Kepler</HI> improving on <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Discoveries, came at a true System of <HI>Comets,</HI> and found, that they moved freely through the Planetary Orbs, with a Motion that is not much different from a <HI>Rectilinear</HI> one.</P>
<P>The incomparable <HI>Hevelius</HI> went on, and tho' he embraced the <HI>Keplerian</HI> Hypothesis, of the <HI>Rectilinear Motion of Comets,</HI> yet he was aware, <HI>That the Path of a Comet was bent into a curve Line towards the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>At last the illustrious Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> arrives with Demonstrations, That all the Phaenomena of <HI>Comets</HI> would naturally follow from the <HI>Keplerian</HI> Principles. He shewed a Method of delineating the <HI>Orbits</HI> of <HI>Comets</HI> geometrically; which caused Admiration in all that considered it, and comprehended it.</P>
<P>The most ingenious Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> has made Calculations, upon which he ventures to foretell the <HI>Return</HI> of <HI>Comets;</HI> but he observes, that some of them have their <HI>Nodes</HI> pretty near the annual Orb of the Earth. I will transcribe the Words he concludes with: 'What may be the <HI>Consequences</HI> of so near an <HI>Appulse,</HI> or of a <HI>Contact,</HI> or lastly of a <HI>Shock</HI> of the Celestial Bodies, (which is by no means impossible to come to pass) I leave to be discussed by the Studious of Physical Matters.'</P>
<P>The Sentiments of so acute a Philosopher as Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> upon <HI>Comets,</HI> deserve to be transcribed. Says he,</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Species</HI> of Heavenly Bodies, call'd COMETS, which re∣volve about the <HI>Sun;</HI> in very Oblong <HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI> approaching to <HI>Parabolick Curves.</HI> The Times of their <HI>Periodical</HI> Revolutions are very long, since in three or four Thousand Years, we have not positively de∣termin'd the Returns of above one or two; however, its certain, that like our <HI>Planets,</HI> they do move in a recurring <HI>Orbit,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> is in one of the <HI>Foci</HI> of this <HI>Orbit,</HI> that by a Ray from the <HI>Sun,</HI> they describe e∣qual
<PB N="5" REF="005389_0005_10180F5B62D63298"/><HI>Area</HI>'s in equal Times, that the same <HI>Law of Gravitation</HI> obtains in them, which does in the <HI>Planets;</HI> that their <HI>Peroidical</HI> Times are cer∣tain and invariable, and that their Motions are regular, only their Course in their <HI>Orbits</HI> is not determin'd one way, but in differently some of 'em move one way, others another: They are also about the same Bulk with the <HI>Planets,</HI> generally speaking; and like them are compact solid Bodies, but surrounded with a vastly large thin Fluid, intermixt with several gros∣ser Particles, and composing an irregular unequally dispos'd and uncer∣tainly agitated Mass; which is call'd its <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> whose <HI>Diameter,</HI> is ten or fifteen Times as long as that of its Body. Besides which, it has a long lucid <HI>Train,</HI> which is rais'd in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> by the Heat thereof, and extends sometimes to four hundred Thousand Miles above its Body. It is always opposite to the <HI>Sun,</HI> because it is the thiner part of its <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> extremely rarified by his Rays; and so rare that the <HI>Stars</HI> may be seen through it. This <HI>Tail</HI> accompanies it through its Course overall the <HI>Planetary Regions,</HI> encreasing in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> and lessen∣ing in its Recess. These <HI>Comets</HI> sometimes come so near the <HI>Sun,</HI> as to be heated to such a Degree that they cannot become cool again, in many Thousands of Years. This with its violent Motion in a <HI>Curve,</HI> which comes near to a streight Line, after it has pass'd its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and the irregular Disposition of the confus'd Mass of its <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> makes it an un∣fit Habitation for Animals, that are not in a State of Punishment, so far as we can conceive of the Nature of Animals. And therefore some have tho't it design'd, to supply the Expence of Fluids in the <HI>Sun</HI> and the <HI>Planets.</HI> But as I have before hinted, this does not seem so very probable, because Nature always supplies constant and regular Expences after a constant and regular Manner. Now the Returns of these Bodies are so irregular and uncertain, and we so little feel the Effects of these Returns (which of Necessity must be felt, if these frightful Bodies made the <HI>Reimburse∣ment</HI> mentioned, since the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> as recruited all at once, or in a very short time, of all the loss they have suffer'd in their Fluids for many Years before,) that I am afraid no such benign Influences, are to be expected from them. I readily grant, that there may be some Clouds of Vapours sweep'd off the <HI>Tails</HI> of these <HI>Comets,</HI> by the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> as they approach them. But then it is uncertain of what Nature these Vapours are, for every Vapour will not become a Fluid, unless its Parts be of such a determin'd <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> as the Nature of Fluids require. Now it's certain, that Heat will raise any Body into a Vapour, provided it be sufficient to dissolve the Union of its Parts, and increase their Bulk to a necessary Dimension: Moreover its hardly accountable how the <HI>Sun</HI> shou'd draw from thence only the Fluid of Light, the Earth, that of Wa∣ter,
<PB N="6" REF="005389_0006_10182BF02CB947A0"/>the other <HI>Planets</HI> their proper Fluids; or if they were suppos'd to draw all <HI>promiscuously,</HI> how these Effects can answer the Design, since Wa∣ter in the <HI>Sun,</HI> which wanted only more of the Fluid of Light, wou'd be as improper a Guest, as Fire on the Earth which wanted only more Water. I think it is more probable, that these frightful Bodies are the Ministers of <HI>Divine Justice,</HI> and in their Visits, lend us <HI>Benign</HI> or <HI>Noxious</HI> Vapours, according to the Designs of Providence: that they may have brought, and may still bring about, the great <HI>Catastrophes</HI> of our <HI>System,</HI> by raising of <HI>Tides,</HI> changing the Figures, and the Positions of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and the very Nature of the <HI>Orbits</HI> themselves: and that they may be the Habi∣tation of <HI>Animals</HI> in a state of Punishment; which, if it did not look too <HI>national,</HI> there are many Arguments to render not improbable. But as for the Diminution of the Quantity of Fluids in the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> it is certainly so small and so inconsiderable (tho' still it be someting) that it will never be sensible in any finite Number of Years, and so needs not so magnificent of Light, I do believe it may be demonstrated, that if all the Fluid which the <HI>Sun</HI> loses in a Year were brought into a solid Form, it would not equal a Grain of Sand. Now what is that to the vast Body of the <HI>Sun?</HI> And as for the Fluids on <HI>our Globe,</HI> tho' some of them be reduc'd into a solid Form, yet upon Examination it will be found that most of the same is again dissolv'd into a Fluid; for in all <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> the Matter is plain; and as for <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals,</HI> I doubt much, whether there be very many new Productions or Generations of that kind, since their first Production. So that though there be some loss of Fluids on <HI>our Globe,</HI> yet there is store enough to supply all the Uses of Life and Vegetation, for any finite number of Years; and by the Frame, and Make of this our <HI>System,</HI> it does not seem design'd to last for ever, without some considerable Changes.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Comets,</HI> I have little more to say about them, than what I have already said, their <HI>Nature, Orbits, Motions</HI> and <HI>Situations,</HI> have been so lately determin'd, (indeed it is but of late, that the <HI>Astronomy</HI> of the <HI>Planets</HI> themselves, and their <HI>Satellits</HI> has been brought to any toler∣able Perfection, and much later since final Causes have been cultivated, with that Care becoming so noble and about 'em extant, so few of 'em, that we know of, have visited us twice, that we have scarce any solid Foundation to build our Reasoning upon. Only, as I have before hint∣ed, these <HI>blazing Stars</HI> seem not design'd for the Habitation of <HI>Animals</HI> in a State of Happiness, nay even scarce of <HI>Animals</HI> not under a State of Punishment; they may be the first <HI>Rudiments of Planets,</HI> not as
<PB N="7" REF="005389_0007_10182BF33A9FA8F0"/>yet brought into our <HI>System,</HI> or rather the <HI>Ruins</HI> of some banish'd thence, to wander in these long <HI>Eccentrick Orbits,</HI> through the World. But most likely they are the <HI>Ministers of Divine Justice,</HI> sending baneful Steams, from their long Trains, upon the <HI>Planets,</HI> they come nigh; and if what is commonly said of 'em by <HI>Astrologers</HI> be true, they seldom visit us without some such direful Salutation. However, from them we may learn that the <HI>Divine Vengeance,</HI> may find a Seat for the Punishment of his disobedient Creatures, without being put to the Expense of a new Creation.'</P>
<P>When I see a vast Comet, blazing and rolling about the unmeasura∣ble <HI>Aether,</HI> I will think;</P>
<P>'Who can tell, but I now see a wicked World <HI>made a fiery Oven in the Time of the Anger of GOD! The Lord swallowing them up in his Wrath and the Fire devouring them!</HI></P>
<P>What prodigious Mischief and Ruin might such a <HI>Ball of Confusion</HI> bring upon our sinful <HI>Globe,</HI> if the Great GOD order its Approach unto us.</P>
<P>How happy they, that are in the Favour and Friendship of that Glori∣ous Lord, who <HI>knows how to deliver the Pious</HI> out of Distresses, and <HI>reserve the Unjust for a Punishment of a Day of Judgment.</HI></P>
