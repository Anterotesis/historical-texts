<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Beg your favourable acceptance of this short account of the ancient and present state of the province of New York.</P>
<P>It is not presented for your lordship's information.—All the world knows, that the affairs of the British colonies, have been, for several years past, under your principal di∣rection: and the wisdom of the measures pursued for their prosperity and defence, are indisputable arguments of year acquaintance with their condition.</P>
<P>Nor am I induced to inscribe these pages to your lord∣ship, by interest, the common motive to addresses of this kind.—Being therefore uninfluenced by the principle, I shall not follow the example, of dedicators; but suppress those sentiments concerning your lordship, which would, nevertheless, give offence only to yourself, and to those who envy your talents and your virtues, and are enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their effects, your reputation and your power.</P>
<P>My lord, your ardent attention to the American pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tions, and assiduous labours for their protection and growth, have laid us under the most indispensible obliga∣tions to gratitude.</P>
<P>Your lordship will therefore excuse me for embracing this opportunity to make a public declaration of the deep sense I have of your kind offices to my country, and to do myself the honour of testifying, that</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER considers the number and extent of the Bri∣tish colonies, on this continent—their climates, soil, ports, rivers, riches, and numberless advantages—must be con∣vinced of their vast importance to Great Britain; and be at a loss to account for the ignorance concerning them, which prevails in those kingdoms, whence their inhabitants origi∣nally sprang. The merchants, indeed, by profitable experi∣ence, have not been altogether unacquainted with our trade and our growth; and some gentlemen of an inquisitive turn, by the help of their correspondents, have obtained the knowledge of many other particulars equally important. But the main body of the people conceive of these plantations, under the idea of wild, boundless, inhospitable, uncultivated deserts; and hence the punishment of a transportation hi∣ther, in the judgment of most, is thought not much less severe, than an infamous death. Nay, appealing to facts, we may safely assert, that even the public boards, to whose care these extensive dominions have been more especially committed, attained, but lately, any tolerable acquaintance with their condition. This is the more to be wondered at, as it is natural to imagine, that the king's governors have sta∣tedly transmitted full accounts of their respective pro∣vinces. The case had been quite otherwise. Governments were heretofore too often bestowed upon men of mean parts, and indigent circumstances. The former were incapable of the task, and the latter too deeply engrossed by the sordid views of private interest, either to pursue or study our common
<PB N="8" REF="024800_0005_0FCD62609CDA2390"/>weal. The worst consequences have resulted from these measures. Perpetual animosities being engendered between the governors, and the people subjected to their authority; all attempts for conciliating the friendship of the Indians, promoting the fur trade, securing the command of the lakes, protecting the frontiers, and extending our possessi∣ons far into the inland country, have too often given place to party projects and contracted schemes, equally useless and shameful. The conduct of the French has been just the reverse: in spite of all the disadvantages of a cold climate, a long and dangerous navigation up the river of St. Law∣rence, a rough, barren, unsettled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Encore moins peuplé." Charlevoix.</NOTE> country, locked up from all communication with the ocean, the greatest part of the year—I say, notwithstanding these difficulties, they have seized all the advantages, which we have neglected. The continent, for many hundred leagues, has been thoroughly explored—the main passes fortified—innumerable tribes of Indians either won over to their interest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Notre nation, la seule, qui ait eu le secret de gagner l'affection des Ameriquains." Charlevoix.</NOTE> subdued, or bri∣dled—the fur trade engrossed—a communication maintain∣ed between the extremes of New France—the British colo∣nies estricted to scant limits along the sea shore, and noth∣ing left remaining for the establishment of a vast empire, but to open a free water passage to the ocean, by the con∣quest of the province of New York.</P>
<P>If the governors of these plantations had formerly been animated by the same generous and extensive views, which inspired mr. Burnet; the long-projected designs of our common enemy might, with the aid of Great Britain, have been many years ago supplanted, or at least defeated, at a trifling expense. But alas! little, too little attention has been had to these important affairs, till the late encroach∣ments on the river Ohio, in the province of Pennsylvania, gave the alarm, and the ministry were apprised of the French machinations, by the seasonable representations of general Shirley; and if the colonies have now attracted the notice of his majesty and his parliament, their grateful acknowledgments are due principally to the noble lord, to whom these sheets are dedicated, for his laudable enqui∣ries into their state, and his indefatigable zeal and industry for their defence and prosperity.</P>
<P>At present our affairs begin to wear a more smiling as∣pect. We are under the guardianship of a sovereign, who
<PB N="9" REF="024800_0006_0FCD6263B16566A8"/>delights in the welfare of his people; are respected by a parliament, affected with a generous sympathy for the dis∣tresses of their fellow subjects, in all their dispersions; and by a wise improvement of the British aids, it is hoped, we shall be able, to retrieve the ill consequences of our long, reproachful, and insensible security.</P>
<P>Formerly the colonies were at home disregarded and de∣spised, nor can any other reason be assigned for it, than that they were unknown. This is, in a great degree, to be im∣puted to ourselves. If our governors withheld those infor∣mations, which their duty required them to have given, persons of private characters ought to have undertaken that useful and necessary task. But, except some accounts of the settlements in the Massachusets bay, and Virginia, all the other histories of our plantations upon the continent, are little else than collections of falsehoods, and worse than none. That this charge against those published concerning this province, in particular, can be fully supported, I persuade myself, will incontestably appear from the following sum∣mary, concerning which I shall say a few words.</P>
<P>Having been formerly concerned, according to an ap∣pointment by act of assembly, in a review and digest of our provincial laws, it was the duty of myself, and my partner in that service, to peruse the minutes of the council, and the journals of the general assembly, from the glorious re∣volution, at the accession of king William, to the year 1751: and as an acquaintance with our public transactions. was a branch of instruction, of which a student for the pro∣fession of the law ought not to be ignorant, I have since re-examined those entries, beginning with the first minutes of council, and read over many of the records in the secreta∣ry's office. From these authentic materials, the following pages were, in a great measure, compiled. For many of those parts, which concern our affairs with the French and the Indians, antecedent to the peace of Ryswick, in 1697, I am bound to make liberal acknowledgments to dr. Col∣den, the author of the history of the five nations.</P>
<P>Mr. Alexander, a gentleman eminent in the law, and equally distinguished for his humanity, generosity, great abilities, and honourable stations, supplied me with some useful papers; and has left behind him a collection, that will be very serviceable to any gentleman, who may here∣after incline to continue this narrative, through the admi∣nistrations of mr. Cosby, and lieutenant governor Clarke. The draught of this work was unfinished, at the time of
<PB N="10" REF="024800_0007_0FCD626512D59820"/>mr. Alexander's decease<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died on the 2d of April, 1756.</NOTE>: and therefore, as it never passed under his examination, many important additions are lost, which his long and intimate acquaintance with the affairs of this province would have enabled him to supply.</P>
<P>When I began to frame this digest, it was only intended for private use; and the motives which now induce me to publish it, are the gratification of the present thirst in Great Britain after American intelligences: contributing, as far as this province is concerned, to an accurate history of the British empire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As the provinces are different in their constitutions, and, with respect to government, independent of each other; no general history of America can be expected, till gentlemen of leisure, will draw up particular accounts of the respective colonies, with which they are acquainted.</NOTE> in this quarter of the world; and the prospect of doing some small service to my country, by laying before the public a summary account of its first rise and present state.</P>
<P>Influenced by these views, I am not so regardless of the judgment of others, as not to wish it may be, in some mea∣sure, acceptable. To please all sorts of readers, I know is impossible: he, who writes with such hopes, is a stranger to human nature, and will be infallibly disappointed. My design is rather to inform than please. He, who delights only in pages shining with illustrious characters, the con∣tentions of armies, the rise and fall of empires, and other grand events, must have recourse to the great authors of antiquity. A detail of the little transactions, which concern a colony, scant in its jurisdiction, and still struggling with the difficulties naturally attending its infant state, to gentle∣men of this taste can furnish no entertainment. The en∣suing narrative (for it deserves not the name of a history, though for brevity's sake I have given it that title) pre∣sents us only a regular thread of simple facts; and even those unembellished with reflexions, because they them∣selves suggest the proper remarks: and most readers will, doubtless, be best pleased with their own. The sacred laws of truth have been infringed neither by positive assertions, oblique, insidious hints, wilful suppressions, or corrupt mis∣representation. To avoid any censures of this kind, no reins have been given to a wanton imagination, for the in∣vention of plausible tales, supported only by light probabi∣lities; but choosing rather to be honest and dull, than a∣greeable
<PB N="11" REF="024800_0008_0FCD62668EFCF9A0"/>and false, the true import of my vouchers hath been strictly adhered to and regarded.</P>
<P>With respect to its sty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the critics, in that branch of literature, are at full liberty to condemn at their pleasure. The main use of language is to express our ideas. To write in the gay, pleasing pomp of diction is above my capaci∣ty. If any are disposed to blame me for being too verbose, let it be remembered, that this is the indefeasible right of my profession, founded upon immemorial prescription. Per∣spicui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is all I have endeavoured to maintain, nor am I at leisure to study any higher attainments in language.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NEW-YORK. <HI>PART I.</HI> From the discovery of the colony to the surrender in <HI>1664.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, a Genoese, employed by Ferdinand and Isabel, king and queen of Castile, was the first discoverer of America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some authors allege, that Columbus first offered his services to the republic of Genoa; then to John II. of Por∣tugal, and afterwards to our king Henry VII; but this dis∣agrees with lord Bacon's account, who informs us, that Christopher Columbus failed, before his brother Bartholo∣mew had laid the project before the king, which was owing to his falling into the hands of pirates, on his way to Eng∣land.</NOTE> He failed from St. Lucar, in August, 1492 and made sight of one of the Bahama islands, on the eleventh of October following. Newfound∣land, and the main continent, were discovered five years after, by Sebastian Gaba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, a Venetian, in the service of Henry VII. of England, from the 38th to the 68th degred of north latitude.</P>
<P>On the tenth of April, 1606, king James I. for plant∣ing two colonies, passed the great North and South Virgi∣nia patent. To sir Thomas Gates and others, leave was gi∣ven to begin a plantation, at any place on the continent, they should think convenient, between the 34th and 41st degrees of latitude: and all the lands extending 50 miles,
<PB N="14" REF="024800_0010_0FCD626AED9FF650"/>on each side, along the coast, 100 miles into the country, and all the islands within 100 miles, opposite to their plan∣tations, were granted in fee, to be called the first colony. By the same patent, a like quantity was granted to Tho∣mas Henham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and others, for a plantation between 38 and 45 degrees of latitude, under the name of the second colony. The first began a settlement in the great bay (Ches∣apeak) in 1607. The latter was planted at Plymouth in New-England, 1620.</P>
<P>Henry Hudson, an Englishman, according to our au∣thors, in the year 1608<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, a French Jesuit, author of the general his∣tory of New France, thinks this discovery was in 1609, Vol. I. 12<SUP>0</SUP>. edition, p. 221. But Stith, Douglass, Oldmixen, and other English writers agree, that Hudson's first voyage was in the preceding year.</NOTE>, under a commission from the king his master, discovered Long Island, New-York, and the river which still bears his name; and afterwards sold the country, or rather his right, to the Dutch. Their writers contend, that Hudson was sent out by the East-India com∣pany, in 1609, to discover a north-west passage to China; and that having first discovered Delaware Bay, he came hither, and penetrated up Hudson's river, as far north as the latitude of 43<SUP>0</SUP>. It is said, however, that there was a sale, and that the English objected to it, though they for some time neglected to oppose the Dutch settlement of the country.</P>
<P>In 1610, Hudson sailed again from Holland to this coun∣try, called by the Dutch, New-Netherlands; and four years after, the states general granted a patent to sundry merchants, for an exclusive trade on the North river, who in 1614 built a fort on the west side, near Albany, which was first commanded by Henry Christiaens. Captain Argal was sent out by sir Thomas Dale, governor of Virginia, in the same year, to dispossess the French of the two towns of Port royal and St. Croix, lying on each side of the bay of Fundy, in Acadia, then claimed as part of Virginia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix places this transaction in 1613. Vol. I. Hist. of N. France in 12<SUP>0</SUP>, p. 210. But Stith, whom I follow, being a clergyman in Virginia, had greater advantages of knowing the truth than the French Jesuit.</NOTE>. In his return, he visited the Dutch on Hudson's river, who, be∣ing unable to resist him, prudently submitted for the pre∣sent to the king of England, and under him to the governor
<PB N="15" REF="024800_0011_0FCD626BCE1DD0B8"/>of Virginia. The very next year, they erected a fort on the south-west point of the island Manhattans; and two others, in 1623—one, called Good-Hope, on Connecticut river, and the other Nassau, on the east side of Delaware bay. The author of the account of New-Netherland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The pamphlet is entitled, "Beschryvinghe van Vir∣ginia, Neiuw Nederland," &amp;c. and was printed at Am∣sterdam in 1651. It contains two descriptions of the Dutch possessions. The first is a copy of that published by John de Laet at Leyden. The second gives a view of this country several years after, in 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. A short representation of the country of the Mahakuase. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dians, written in 1644, by John Megapolensis, jun. a Dutch minister residing here, is annex∣ed to that part of the pamphlet concerning New-Nether∣land.</NOTE> as∣serts, that the Dutch purchased the lands on both sides of that river in 1632, before the English were settled in those parts; and that they discovered a little fresh river, farther to the east, called Varsche Riviertie, to distinguish it from Connecticut river, known among them, by the name of Varsche rivier, which Vanderdonk also claims for the Dutch.</P>
<P>Determined upon the settlement of a colony, the states general made a grant of the country, in 1621, to the West-India company. Wouter Van Twiller arrived at fort Am∣sterdam, now New-York, and took upon himself the go∣vernment, in June, 1629. His style, in the patents granted by him, was thus, "We, director and council, residing in New-Netherland on the island Manhattans, under the government of their high mightinesses, the lords states general of the united Netherlands, and the privileged West-India company." In his time, the New-England planters extended their possession westward as far as Connecticut river. Jacob Van Curlet, the commissary there, pro∣tested against it, and in the second year of the succeeding administration, under</P>
<P>William Kieft<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have no books among our Dutch records remain∣ing in the secretary's office, relating to state matters, be∣fore Kieft's time, nor any enrolment of patents, till a year after Van Twiller arrived here. Mr. Jacob Goelet suppli∣ed us with several extracts from the Dutch records.</NOTE>, who appears first in 1638, a prohibi∣tion was issued, forbidding the English trade at fort Good-Hope; and shortly after, on complaint of the inso∣lence
<PB N="16" REF="024800_0012_0FCD626F85B10800"/>of the English, an order of council was made for send∣ing more forces there, to maintain the Dutch territories. Dr. Mather confesses, that the New-England men first formed their design of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettling Counecticut river, in 1635, before which time, they esteemed that river, at least 100 miles from any English settlement; and that they first seat∣ed themselves there, in 1636, at Hartford, near fort Good, Hope, at Weathersfield, Windsor, and Springfield. Four years after, they seized the Dutch garrison, and drove them from the banks of the river, having first settled New-Haven in 1638, regardless of Kieft's protest against it.</P>
<P>The extent of New-Netherland was to Delaware, then called South river, and beyond it; for I find, in the Dutch records, a copy of a letter from William Kieft, May 6, 1638, directed to Peter Minuit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>no is Dutch author of the description of New-Netherland, in 1649, calls him Minnewits; and adds, that in 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, he arrived at Delaware with two vessels, pretending that he touched for refreshment in his way to the West-Indies, but that he soon threw off the disguise, by employing his men in e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting a fort. The same histo∣rian informs us, of the murder of several Dutchmen, at South river, by the Indians occasioned by a quarrel, con∣cerning the taking away the states' arms, which the for∣mer had erected at the first discovery of that country; in resenting which, an Indian had been killed. If Kieft's let∣ter, alludes to this affair, then Minuit preceded Van Twil∣ler, in the chief command here; and being perhaps diso∣bliged by the Dutch, entered into the service of the queen of Sweden.</NOTE>, who seems, by the tenor of it, to be the Swedish governor of New Sweden, assert∣ing, "that the whole South river of New-Netherlands, had been in the Dutch possession many years above and be∣low, beset with forts, and sealed with their blood." "Which," Kieft adds, "has happened even during your administration in New-Netherland, and so well known to you."</P>
<P>The Dutch writers are not agreed in the extent of No∣va Belgia, or New-Netherland; some describe it to be from Virginia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Canada; and others inform us, that the arms of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general were erected at Cape Cod, Connecticut, and Hudson's river, and on the west side of the entrance into Delaware bay. The author of the pamphlet mention∣ed in the notes, gives Canada river for a boundary on the
<PB N="17" REF="024800_0013_0FCD627057FAA430"/>north, and calls the country, north-west from Albany, Ter∣ra Incognita.</P>
<P>In 1640, the English, who had overspread the eastern part of Long Island, advanced to Oysterbay. Kieft broke up their settlement in 1642, and fitted out two sloops to drive the English out of Schuylkill, of which the Mary∣landers had lately possessed themselves. The instructions, dated May 22, to Jan Jansen Alpendam, who commanded in that enterprise, are upon record, and strongly assert the right of the Dutch, both to the soil and trade there. The English from the eastward shortly after sent deputies to New-Amsterdam, for the accommodation of their disputes a∣bout limits, to whom the Dutch offered the following con∣ditions, entered in their books exactly in these words:</P>
<P>"Conditiones a D. Directore gen. senatus Novi Belgil, Dominis Weytingh atque Hill, Delegatis a nobili senatu Hartfordiensi, oblatae:</P>
<P>"Pro agro nostro Hartfordiensi, annuo persolvent prae∣potentiff. D. D. Ordinibus Foed.

Actum in arce Amstelodamensi in novo Belgio, die Julii 9, anno Christi 1642."</P>
<P>We have no account, that the English acceded to these proposals, nor is it probable, considering their superior strength, that they ever did: on the contrary, they daily extended their possessions; and, in 1642, the colonies of the Massachuset's bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New-Haven, entered into a league both against the Dutch and Indians, and grew so powerful as to meet shortly after, upon a design of extirpating the former. The Massachuset's bay declined this enterprise, which occasioned a letter to Oliver Cromwell, from William Hooke, dated at New-Ha∣ven, November 3, 1653, in which he complains of the Dutch, for supplying the natives with arms and ammuni∣tion, begs his assistance with two or three frigates, and that letters might be sent to the eastern colonies, command∣ing them to join in an expedition against the Dutch colony, Oliver's affairs would not admit of so distant an attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The war between him and the states, which began in July, 1652, was concluded by a peace on the fifth of April, 1654. The treaty makes no particular mention of this country. If any part of it can be considered as relating to the American possessions, it is to be found in the two first articles, which are in these words: "Imprimis, it is a∣greed and concluded, that, from this day forwards, there be a true, firm, and inviolable peace, a sincere, in∣timate, and close friendship, affinity, confederacy, and union, betwixt the republic of England and the states general of the united provinces of the Netherlands, and the lands, countries, cities, and towns, under the domi∣nions of each, without distinction of places, together with their people and inhabitants, of whatsoever degree.
<P>II. "That hereafter all enmity, hostility, discord, and contention, betwixt the said republics, and their people and subjects, shall cease; and both parties shall hence∣forwards abstain from the committing all manner of mis∣chief, plunder, and injuries, by land, by sea, and on the fresh waters, in all their lands, countries, dominions, places, and governments whatsoever."</P></NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="024800_0014_0FCD6271D4B0A568"/>but Richard Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well afterwards drew up instruction to his commanders for subduing the Dutch here, and wrote letters to the English American governments for their aid; copies of which are preserved in Thurloe's collection, Vol. I. p. 721, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Peter Stuyvesant was the last Dutch governor; and though he had a commission in 1646, he did not begin his administration till May 27, 1647. The inroads, and claims upon his government, kept him constantly employed. New-England on the east, and Maryland, on the west, alarmed his fears by their daily increase; and about the same time, captain Forrester, a Scotchman, claimed Long Island for the dowager of Stirling. The Swedes too were perpetual∣ly incroaching upon Delaware. Through the unskilfulness of the mate, one Deswyck, a Swedish captain and supercar∣go, arrived in Raritan river. The ship was seized, and him∣self made a prisoner at New-Amsterdam. Stuyvesant's rea∣sons were these. In 1651, the Dutch built fort Casimir, now called Newcastle, on Delaware. The Swedes, indeed, claimed the country, and Printz, their governor, formally protested against the works. Risingh, his successor, under the disguise of friendship, came before the fortress, fired two salutes, and landed 30 men, who were entertained by
<PB N="19" REF="024800_0015_0FCD62734F1F8948"/>the commandant as friends: but he had no sooner disco∣vered the weakness of the garrison, than he made himself master of it, seizing also upon all the ammunition, houses, and other effects of the West-India company, and compel∣ling several of the people to swear allegiance to Christina, queen of Sweden. The Dutch, in 1655, prepared to retake fort Casimir. Stuyvesant commanded the forces in person, and arrived with them in Delaware, the 9th of September. A few days after, he anchored before the garrison, and landed his troops. The fortress was immediately demanded as Dutch property: Suen Scutz, the commandant, desired leave to consult Risingh, which being refused, he surrender∣ed the 16th of September on articles of capitulation. The whole strength of the place consisted of four cannon, four∣teen pounders, five swivels, and a parcel of small arms, which were all delivered to the conquered. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort Christina was commanded by Risingh. Stuyvesant came before it, and Risingh surrendered it upon terms, the 25th of Septem∣ber. The country being thus subdued, the Dutch governor issued a proclamation, in favour of such of the inhabitants, as would submit to the new government, and about 30 Swedes swore, "fidelity and obedience to the states general the lords directors of the West-India company, their subalterns of the province of New-Netherlands, and the director general then, or thereafter, to be established." Risingh and one Elswych, a trader of note, were ordered to France, or England, and the rest of the Swedish inhabi∣tants to Holland, and from thence to Gottenberg. The Swedes being thus extirpated, the Dutch became possessed of the west side of Delaware bay, now called the Three lower counties.</P>
<P>This country was afterwards under the command of lieutenant-governors, subject to the controul of, and com∣missioned by, the director general at New-Amsterdam. Jo∣han Paul Jaquet was the first vice director, or lieutenant-governor, of South river. His successors were Alricks, Hino∣jossa, and William Beekman. The posterity of the last re∣mains amongst us to this day. These lieutenants had power to grant lands, and their patents make a part of the ancient titles of the present possessors. Alricks' commission, of the 12th of April, 1657, shows the extent of the Dutch claim on the west side of Delaware at that time. He was appoint∣ed "director general of the colony of the South river of New-Netherlands, and the fortress of Casimir, now called Niewer Amstel, with all the lands depending thereon, according to the first purchase and deed of release of the
<PB N="20" REF="024800_0016_0FCD627579B9D118"/>natives, dated July 19, 1651, beginning at the west side of the Minquaa, or Christina kiln, in the Indian language named Suspecough, to the mouth or the bay, or river, cal∣led Bompt-Hook, in the Indian language, Cannaresse; and so far inland as the bounds and limits of the Minquaa∣land, with all the streams, &amp;c. appurtenances and de∣pendencies." Of the country northward of the kiln, no mention is made. Orders in 1658 were given to William Beekman to purchase Cape Hinlopen from the natives, and to settle and fortify it, which, for want of goods, was not done till the succeeding year.</P>
<P>In the year 1659, fresh troubles arose from the Maryland claim to the lands on South river: and in September, colo∣nel Nathaniel Utie, as commissioner from Fendal, lord Balti∣more's governor, arrived at Niewer Amstel from Maryland. The country was ordered to be evacuated, lord Baltimore claiming all the land, between 38 and 40 degrees of lati∣tude, from sea to sea. Beekman and his council demanded evidence of his lordship's right, and offered to prove the states general's grant to the West-India company, their payment to them, for the land and possession; and upon the whole, proposed to refer the controversy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the repub∣lics of England and Holland, praying, at the same time, three weeks to consult Stuyvesant, the general. The com∣missioner, notwithstanding, a few days after, warned him to draw off, beyond latitude 40°: but Beekman disregard∣ed the threat. Colonel Utie thereupon returned to Mary∣land; and an immediate invasion was expected.</P>
<P>Early in the spring of the year 1660, Nicholas Varleth, and Brian Newton, were dispatched from fort Amsterdam, to Virginia, in quality of ambassadors, with full power to open a trade, and conclude a league, offensive and defensive, against the barbarians. William Berckley, the governor, gave them a kind reception, and approved their proposal of peace and commerce, which sir Henry Moody was sent here to agree upon and perfect. Four articles, to that pur∣pose, were drawn up, and sent to the governor for confir∣mation. Stuyvesant artfully endeavoured, at this treaty, to procure an acknowledgment of the Dutch title to the country, which Berckley as carefully avoided. This was his answer.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Governor Stuyvesant was a faithful servant to the West-India company: this is abundantly proved by his letters to them, exciting their care of the colony. In one, dated April 20, 1660, which is very long and pathetic, represent∣ing the desperate situation of affairs on both sides of the New-Netherland, he writes, "your honours ima∣gine, that the troubles in England will prevent any at∣tempt on these parts: alas! they are ten to one in num∣ber to us, and are able, without any assistance, to deprive us of the country when they please." On the 25th of June, the same year, he informs them, "that the demands, encroachments, and usurpations, of the English, give the people here great concern. The right to both rivers, says he, by purchase and possession, is our own, without dispute. We apprehend, that they, our more powerful neighbours, lay their claims under a royal patent, which we are unable hitherto to do in your name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If we should argue, from this letter, that the West-In∣dia company had no grants of the New Netherlands, from the states general, as some suppose, we discredit De Laet's history, dedicated to the states in 1624, as well as all the Dutch writers, and even Stuyvesant himself, who in his letter to Richard Nicolls, at the surrender, asserts that they had a grant, and showed it under seal to the English depu∣ties. But the genuine construction of the Dutch governor's letter, is this, that in 1660, he had not the patent to the West-India company, to lay before the English in America, who disputed the Dutch right to this country.</NOTE> Colonel
<PB N="22" REF="024800_0018_0FCD627B1BC8D6B8"/>Utie being unsuccessful the last year, in his embassy for the evacuation of the Dutch possessions on Delaware, lord Balti∣more, in autumn 1660, applied, by captain Neal, his agent, to the West-India company, in Holland, for an order on the inhabitants of South river, to submit to his authority, which they absolutely refused, asserting their right to that part of their colony.</P>
<P>The English, from New-England, were every day en∣croaching upon the Dutch. The following letter, from Stuyvesant to the West-India company, dated July 21, 1661, shows the state of the colony at that time, on both sides. "We have not yet begun the fort on Long-Island, near Oysterbay, because our neighbours lay the boundaries a mile and a half more westerly, than we do; and the more, as your honours, by your advice of December 24, are not inclined to stand by the treaty of Hartford, and propose to sue for redress on Long Island and the Fresh Water river, by means of the states' ambassador. Lord Sterling is said to solicit a confirmation of his right to all Long Island, and importunes the present king, to confirm the grant made by his royal father, which is affirmed to be already obtained. But more probable, and material, is the advice from Mary∣land, that lord Baltimore's patent, which contains the south part of South river, is confirmed by the king and published in print: that lord Baltimore's natural brother, who is a rigid papist, being made governor there, has received lord Baltimore's claim, and protest to your honours in council, (where with he seems but little satisfied) and has now more hopes of success. We have advice from England, that there is an invasion intended against these parts, and the country solicited of the king, the duke and the parliament, is to be annexed to their dominions; and for that purpose, they desire three or four frigates, persuading the King, that the company possessed and held this country under an unlaw∣ful title, having only obtained of king James, leave for a watering place on Staten Island, in 1623."</P>
<P>In August 1663, a ship arrived from Holland at South river, with new planters, ammunition, and implements of husbandry. Lord Baltimore's son landed a little after, and was entertained by Beekman at Niewer Amstel. This was Charles, the son of Cecilius, who in 1661, had procured a grant and confirmation of the patent, passed in favour of
<PB N="23" REF="024800_0019_0FCD627CE6B13E30"/>his father in 1632. The papistical principles of the Balti∣more family, the charge of colonizing, the parliamentary was with Charles I. and Oliver's usurpation, all conspired to impede the settlement of Maryland, till the year 1661. And these considerations account for the extension of the Dutch limits, on the west side of Delaware bay.</P>
<P>While the Dutch were contending with their European neighbours, they had the art always to maintain a friend∣ship with the natives, until the war which broke out this year with the Indians at Esopus, now Ulster county. It con∣tinued, however, but a short season. The five nations never gave them any disturbance, which was owing to their con∣tinual wars with the French, who settled at Canada, in 1603. I have before observed, that Oliver Cromwell was applied to, for his aid in the reduction of this country, and that his son Richard took some steps towards accomplishing the scheme. The work was however reserved for the reign of Charles II. an indolent prince, and entirely given up to pleasure, who was driven to it, more, perhaps, by the dif∣ferences then subsisting between England and Holland, than by any motive that might reflect honour upon his prudence, activity, and public spirit. Before this expedition, the king granted a patent, on the 12th of March, 1664, to his brother the duke of York and Albany, for sundry tracts of land in America, the boundaries of which, because they have given rise to important and animated debates, it may not be im∣proper to transcribe.</P>
<P>"All that part of the main land of New-England, begin∣ning at a certain place, called or known by the name of St. Croix, next adjoining to New-Scotland in America, and from thence extending along the sea coast, unto a certain place called Pemaquie, or Pemequid, and so up the river thereof, to the furthest head of the same, as it tendeth northward; and extending from thence, to the river of Kimbequin, and so upwards, by the shortest course, to the river Canada, northward: and also all that island, or islands, commonly called by the several name or names of Meito∣wacks, or Long Island, situate and being towards the west of cape Cod, and the narrow Higansetts, abutting upon the main land, between the two rivers, there called or known by the several names of Connecticut and Hudson's river, together also with the said river, called Hudson's river, and all the land from the west side of Connecticut river, to the east side of Delaware bay, and also, all those several islands, called or known by the names of Martin's Vineyard, or Nan∣tuck's, otherwise Nantucket: together, &amp;c."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="024800_0020_0FCD627DD3EC4BC8"/>
Part of this tract was conveyed by the duke, to John Lord Berkley, baron of Stratton, and sir George Carteret, of Sal∣trum, in Devon, who were then members of the king's council. The lease was for the consideration of ten shil∣lings, and dated the 23d of June, 1664. The release, dated the next day, mentions no particular sum of money, as a consideration for the grant of the lands, which have the fol∣lowing description.</P>
<P>"All that tract of land, adjacent to New-England, and lying and being to the westward of Long Island, and bound∣ed on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river; and hath, upon the west, Delaware bay, or river, and extendeth southward, to the main ocean as far as Cape May, at the mouth of Delaware bay: and to the north∣ward, as far as the northermost branch of the said bay or river of Delaware, which is forty one degrees and forty minutes of latitude: which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name, or names, of Nova Caesarea, or New-Jersey."</P>
<P>Thus the New Netherlands became divided into New-Jersey, so called after the isle of Jersey, in compliment to sir George Carteret, whose family came from thence; and New York, which took its name in honour of the duke of York.</P>
<P>The Dutch inhabitants by the vigilance of their governor, were not unapprised of the designs of the English court against them; for their records testify, that on the 8th of July, "the general received intelligence, from one Thomas Willet, an Englishman, that an expedition was preparing in England, against this place, consisting of two frigates of 40 and 50 guns, and a fly boat of 40 guns, having on board 300 soldiers, and each frigate 150 men, and that they then lay at Portsmouth, waiting for a wind." News arrived also from Boston, that they had already set sail. The burgomas∣ters were thereupon called into council. The fortress was ordered to be put into a posture of defence, and spies sent to Milford and West-chester for intelligence. Boston was in the secret of the expedition; for the general court had, in May preceding, passed a vote for a supply of provisions, to∣wards refreshing the ships on their arrival. They were four in number, and resolved to rendezvous at Gardener's island, in the Sound, but parted in a fog, about the 20th of July. Richard Nicolls, and sir George Carteret, two of the com∣missioners, were on board the Guyny, and fell in first with Cape Cod. The winds having blown from the south west, the other ships, with sir Robert Carr, and mr. Mavenick,
<PB N="25" REF="024800_0021_0FCD627F9803DF78"/>the remaining commissioners, were rightly concluded to be driven to the eastward. After dispatching a letter to mr. Winthrop, the governor of Connecticut, requesting his as∣sistance, col. Nicolls proceeded to Namasket, and thence to Boston. The other ships got into Piscataway. John Endicot, a very old man, was then governor of Boston, and incapa∣ble of business. The commissioners, therefore, had a con∣ference with the council, and earnestly implored the as∣sistance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that colony. Col. Nicolls and sir George Carteret, in their letter from Boston, to sir H. Bennet, secretary of state, complain much of the backwardness of that province. The reasons urged in their excuse, were poverty and the season, it being the time of harvest; but perhaps disaffec∣tion to the Stuart family, whose persecuting fury had driven them from their native country, was the true spring of their conduct. The king's success in the reduction of the Dutch, evidently opened him a door, to come at his ene∣mies in New-England, who were far from being few<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. Dixwell, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> one of Charles I.'s judges, and excepted out of the general pardon, lived many years at New-Haven (incog.) in quality of a country merchant: sir Edmond Andross, in one of his tours through the colony of Connec∣ticut, saw him there at church, and strongly suspected him to be one of the regicides. In his last illness, he revealed himself to the minister of the town, and ordered a small stone to be set at the head of his grave, which I have often seen there, inscribed, T. D. <ABBR>esq</ABBR> While at New-Haven, he went under the name of John Davis.</NOTE>; and whether this consideration might not have given rise to the project itself, I leave to the conjectures of others.</P>
<P>On the 27th of July, Nicolls and Carteret made a formal request in writing, "That the government of Boston would pass an act to furnish them with armed men, who should be∣gin their march to the Manhattans, on the 20th of August ensuing, and promised, that if they could get other assistance, they would give them an account of it." The governor and council answered, that they would assemble the general court, and communicate the proposal to them.</P>
<P>From Boston, a second letter was written to governor Winthrop, in Connecticut, dated the 29th of July, in which he was informed, that the other ships were then arrived, and would sail with the first fair wind; and he was desired to meet them at the west end of Long-Island.</P>
<P>One of the ships entered the bay of the North river, se∣veral
<PB N="26" REF="024800_0022_0FCD62824EC15030"/>days before the rest; and as soon as they were all come up, Stuyvesant sent a letter, dated ⅓ 9/0 of August, at fort Anil, directed to the commanders of the English fri∣gates, by John Declyer, one of the chief council, the rev. John Megapolensis, minister, Paul Lunder Vander Grilft, major, and mr. Samuel Megapolensis, doctor in physic, with the utmost civility, to desire the reason of their approach, and continuing in the harbour of Naijarlij, without giving notice to the Dutch, which (he writes) they ought to have done.</P>

<P>Mr. Stuyvesant promised an answer to the summons the next morning, and in the mean time convened the council and burgomasters. The Dutch governor was a good soldier, and had lost a leg in the service of the states. He would willingly have made a defence; and refused a sight of the summons, both to the inhabitants and burgomasters, lest the easy terms offered, might induce them to capitulate. The latter, however, insisted upon a copy, that they might communicate it to the late magistrates and principal burghers. They called together the inhabitants at the stadt∣house, and acquainted them with the governor's refusal. Governor Winthrop, at the same time, wrote to the di∣rector and his council, strongly recommending a surrender. On the 22d of August, the burgomasters came again into council, and desired to know the contents of the English message from governor Winthrop, which Stuyvesant still refused. They continued their importunity; and he, in a fit of anger, tore it to piecee: upon which they protested against the act, and all its consequences. Determined upon a defence of the country, Stuyvesant wrote a letter in an∣swer to the summons, which, as it is historical of the Dutch claim, will doubtless be acceptable to the reader. The fol∣lowing is an exact transcript of the record.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR first letter, unsigned, of the 20/31 August, together with that of this day, signed according to form, be∣ing the first of September, have been safely delivered into our hands by your deputies; unto which we shall say, that the rights of his majesty of England, unto any part of America hereabout, amongst the rest, unto the colonies of Virginia, Maryland, or others in New-England, whe∣ther disputable or not, is that which, for the present, we have no design to debate upon. But that his majesty hath an indisputable right, to all the lands in the north parts of America, is that, which the kings of France and Spain will disallow, as we absolutely do, by virtue of a commission given to me, by my lords, the high and mighty states ge∣neral, to be governor general, over New-Holland, the isle
<PB N="28" REF="024800_0024_0FCD6289CE30FAF8"/>of Curacoa, Bonaire, Aruba, with their appurtenances and dependencies, bearing date the 26th of July, 1646; as also by virtue of a grant and commission; given by my said lords, the high and mighty states general, to the West-India compa∣ny, in the year 1621, with as much power and as authentic, as his said majesty of England hath given, or can give, to any colony in America, as more fully appears by the patent and commission of the said lords the states general, by them signed, registered, and sealed with their great seal, which were showed to your deputies, colonel George Carteret, cap∣tain Robert Needham, captain Edward Groves, and mr. Thomas Delavall; by which commission and patent, toge∣ther (to deal frankly with you) and by divers letters, sign∣ed and sealed by our said lords, the states general, directed to several persons, both English and Dutch, inhabiting the towns and villages on Long Island, (which, without doubt, have been produced before you, by those inhabitants) by which they are declared and acknowledged to be their subjects, with express command, that they continue faithful unto them, under penalty of incurring their utmost displea∣sure, which makes it appear more clear than the sun at noon-day, that your first, foundation, viz. that the right and title of his majesty of Great Britain, to these parts of America, is unquestionable, is absolutely to be denied. Moreover, it is without dispute, and acknowledged by the world, that our predecessors, by virtue of the commission and patent of the said lords, the states general, have, with∣out controul and peaceably (the contrary never coming to our knowledge) enjoyed fort Orange, about 48 or 50 years, the Manhattans about 41 or 42 years, the South river 40 years, and the Fresh Water river about 36 years.</P>
<P>Touching the second subject of your letter, viz. "His majesty hath commanded me, in his name, to require a sur∣render of all such forts, towns, or places of strength, which now are possessed by the Dutch, under your command;" we shall answer, that we are so confident of the discretion and equity of his majesty of Great Britain, that in case his ma∣jesty were informed of the truth, which is, that the Dutch came not into these provinces, by any violence, but by vir∣tue of commissions from my lords, the states general, first of all in the years 1614, 1615, and 1616, up the North Ri∣ver near fort Orange, where, to hinder the invasions and massacres, commonly committed by the savages, they built a little fort, and after in the year 1622, and even to this present time, by virtue of commission and grant, to the go∣vernors of the West India company; and moreover, in the
<PB N="29" REF="024800_0025_0FCD628BD8822F68"/>year 1656, a grant to the honourable the burgomasters of Amsterdam, of the South River; insomuch, that by virtue of the abovesaid commissions from the high and mighty states general, given to the persons interested as aforesaid, and others, these provinces have been governed, and consequent∣ly enjoyed, as also in regard of their first discovery, unin∣terrupted possessions, and purchase of the lands of the princes, natives of the country, and other private persons (though gentiles) we make no doubt, that if his said ma∣jesty of Great Britain, were well-informed of these pas∣sages, he would be too judicious to grant such an order, principally in a time when there is so strait a friendship, and confederacy, between our said lords and superiors, to trouble us in the demanding and summons of the places and fortresses, which were put into our hands, with order to maintain them, in the name of the said lords, the states general, as was made appear to your deputies, under the names and seal of the said high and mighty states general, dated the 28th of July 1646. Besides what hath been men∣tioned, there is little probability, that his said majesty of England (in regard the articles of peace are printed, and were recommended to us to observe seriously and exactly, by a letter written to us by our said lords, the states general, and to cause them to be observed religiously in this coun∣try) would give order touching so dangerous a design, being also so apparent, that none other than my said lords, the states general, have any right to these provinces, and con∣sequently ought to command and maintain their subjects, and in their absence, we, the governor general, are obliged to maintain their rights, and to repel and take revenge of all threatenings, unjust attempts, or any force whatsoever, that shall be committed against their faithful subjects and inhabitants; it being a very considerable thing, to affront so mighty a state, although it were not against an ally and confederate. Consequently, if his said majesty (as it is fit) were well informed, of all that could be spoken upon this subject, he would not approve of what expressions were mentioned in your letter; which are, that you are com∣manded by his majesty, to demand in his name, such places and fortresses as are in the possession of the Dutch under my government; which, as it appears by my commission before mentioned, was given me by my lords, the high and mighty states general. And there is less ground in the ex∣press demand of my government, since all the world knows, that about three years ago, some English frigates being on the coast of Africa, upon a pretended commission,
<PB N="30" REF="024800_0026_0FCD628D0713EF78"/>they did demand certain places under the government of our said lords, the states general, as Cape Vert, river of Gam∣bo, and all other places in Guyny, to them belonging. Up∣on which, our said lords, the states general, by virtue of the articles of peace, having made appear the said attempt to his majesty of England, they received a favourable an∣swer, his said majesty disallowing all such acts of hostility, as might have been done, and, besides, gave order, that re∣stitution should be made, to the East India company, of whatsoever had been pillaged, in the said river of Gambo; and likewise restored them to their trade, which makes us think it necessary, that a more express order should appear unto us, as a sufficient warrant for us, towards my lords, the high and mighty states general, since by virtue of our said commission, we do, in these provinces, represent them, as belonging to them, and not to the king of Great Britain, except his said majesty, upon better grounds, make it ap∣pear to our said lords, the states general, against which they may defend themselves, as they shall think fit. To con∣clude: we cannot but declare unto you, though the gover∣nors and commissioners of his majesty have divers times quarrelled with us, about the bounds of the jurisdiction or the high and mighty the states general, in these parts, yet they never questioned their jurisdiction itself; on the contrary, in the year 1650, at Hartford, and the last year at Boston, they treated with us upon this subject, which is a sufficient proof, that his majesty hath never been well-in∣formed, of the equity of our cause, insomuch as we cannot imagine, in regard of the articles of peace, between the crown of England and the states general, (under whom there are so many subjects in America, as well as Europe) that his said majesty of Great-Britain would give a com∣mission to molest and endamage the subjects of my said lords, the states general, especially such, as ever since 50, 40, and the latest 36 years, have quietly enjoyed their lands, countries, forts, and inheritances: and less, that his sub∣jects would attempt any acts of hostility, or violence against them: and in case that you will act by force of arms, we protest and declare, in the name of our said lords, the states general, before God and men, that you will act an unjust violence, and a breach of the articles of peace, so solemnly sworn, agreed upon, and ratified by his majesty of England, and my lords, the states general, and the ra∣ther, for that to prevent the shedding of blood, in the month of February last, we treated with captain John. Scott, (who reported he had a commission from his said majesty) touching the limits of Long Island, and concluded for the
<PB N="31" REF="024800_0027_0FCD6290154CD1E0"/>space of a year; that in the mean time, the business might be treated on between the king of Great Britain, and my lords, the high and mighty states general: and again, at present, for the hindrance and prevention of all differences, and the spilling of innocent blood, not only in these parts, but also in Europe, we offer unto you, a treaty by our de∣puties, mr. Cornelius Van Ruyven, secretary, and receiver of New Holland, Cornelius Steenwick, burgomaster, mr. Samuel Megapolensis, doctor of physic, and mr. James Cousseau, heretofore sheriff. As touching the threats in your conclusion, we have nothing to answer, only that we fear nothing, but what God (who is as just as merciful) shall lay upon us; all things being in his gracious disposal, and we may as well be preserved by him, with small forces, as by a great army, which makes us to wish you all happiness and prosperity, and recommend you to his protection. My lords, your thrice humble and affectionate servant and friend, signed, P. Stuyvesant.—At the fort at Amsterdam, the second of September, new stile, 1664."</P>
<P>While the Dutch governor and council were contending with the burgomasters and people in the city, the English commissioners published a proclamation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was in these words: "Forasmuch as his majesty hath sent us (by commission under his great seal of England) amongst other things, to expel, or to reduce to his majes∣ty's obedience all such foreigners as without his majesty's leave and consent, have seated themselves amongst any of his dominions in America, to the prejudice of his majes∣ty's subjects, and diminution of his royal dignity; we, his said majesty's commissioners, do declare and promise, that whosoever, of what nation soever, will, upon knowledge of this proclamation, acknowledge and testify themselves, to submit to this his majesty's government, as his good sub∣jects, shall be protected in his majesty's laws and justice, and peaceably enjoy whatsoever God's blessing, and their own honest industry, have furnished them with; and all other privileges, with his majesty's English subjects. We have caused this to be published, that we might prevent all inconveniencies to others, if it were possible: however, to clear ourselves from the charge of all those miseries, that may any way befall such as live here, and will [not] ac∣knowledge his majesty for their sovereign, whom God pre∣serve."</NOTE> in the country, encouraging the inhabitants to submit, and promising them
<PB N="32" REF="024800_0028_0FCD6291CFB57818"/>the king's protection, and all the privileges of subjects: and as soon as they discovered by Stuyvesant's letter, that he was averse to the surrender, officers were sent to beat up for volunteers in Middleborough, Ulissen, Jamaica, and Hemp∣sted. A warrant was also issued to Hugh Hide, who com∣manded the squadron, to prosecute the reduction of the fort; and an English ship, then trading here, was pressed into the service. These preparations induced Stuyvesant to write another letter, on the 25th of August, old style, where∣in, though he declares that he would stand the storm, yet to prevent the spilling of blood, he had sent John de Decker, counsellor of state, Cornelius Van Riven, secretary and re∣ceiver, Cornelius Steenwyck, major, and James Cousseau, sheriff, to consult, if possible, an accommodation. Nicolls, who knew the disposition of the people, answered imme∣diately from Gravesend, that he would treat about nothing but a surrender. The Dutch governor, the next day, agreed to a treaty and surrender, on condition the English and Dutch limits in America, were settled by the crown and the states general. The English deputies were, sir Robert Carr, George Carteret, John Winthrop, governor of Connecticut, Samuel Wyllys, one of the assistants or council of that colo∣ny, and Thomas Clarke, and John Pynchon, commissioners from the general court of the Massachusetts bay, who, but a little before, brought an aid from that province. What these persons agreed upon, Nicolls promised to ratify. At eight o'clock in the morning, of the 27th of August, 1664, the commissioners, on both sides, met at the governor's farm, and there signed the following articles of capitula∣tion.</P>
<P>These articles following were consented to by the per∣sons hereunder subscribed, at the governor's bowery, Aug. the 27th, old stile, 1664.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>These articles, favourable as they were to the inhabitants, were however very disagreeable to the Dutch governor; and he therefore refused to ratify them, till two days after they were signed by the commissioners.</P>
<P>The town of New-Amsterdam, upon the reduction of the island Manhattans, took the name of New-York. It consist∣ed of several small streets, laid out in the year 1656, and was not inconsiderable for the number of its houses and in∣habitants. The easy terms of the capitulation, promised their peaceable subjection to the new government; and hence we find, that in two days after the surrender, the Boston aid was dismissed, with the thanks of the commis∣sioners to the general court. Hudson's and the South river were, however, still to be reduced. Sir Robert Carr com∣manded the expedition on Delaware, and Carteret was commissioned to subdue the Dutch at fort Orange. The garrison capitulated on the 24th of September, and he cal∣led it Albany, in honour of the duke. While Carteret was here, he had an interview with the Indians of the five na∣tions, and entered into a league of friendship with them, which remarkably continues to this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutch were sensible of the importance of preserv∣ing an uninterrupted amity with those Indians, for they were both very numerous and warlike. The French pur∣sued quite different measures, and the irruptions of those tribes, according to their own authors, have often reduced Canada to the brink of ruin.</NOTE>. Sir Robert Carr was equally successful on South river; for he compelled both
<PB N="36" REF="024800_0032_0FCD629BA3ED4018"/>the Dutch and Swedes, to capitulate and deliver up their garrisons the first of October, 1664; and that was the day in which the whole New-Netherlands became subject to the English crown. Very few of the inhabitants thought proper to remove out of the country. Governor Stuyvesant him∣self held his estate, and died here. His remains were inter∣red in a chapel, which he had erected on his own farm, at a small distance from the city, now possessed by his grandson Gerardus Stuyvesant, a man of probity, who has been elect∣ed into the magistracy, above thirty years successively. Jus∣tice obliges me to declare, that for loyalty to the present reigning family, and a pure attachment to the protestant religion, the descendents of the Dutch planters, are per∣haps exceeded by none of his majesty's subjects.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NEW-YORK. <HI>PART II.</HI> From the surrender in <HI>1664,</HI> to the settlement at the revolution.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD NICOLLS being now possessed of the country, took the government upon him, under the stile of "deputy-governor under his royal highness the duke of York, of all his territories in America." During his short continuance here, he passed a vast number of grants and confirmations of the ancient Dutch patents, the profits of which must have been very considerable. Among these, no one has occasioned more animated contention, than that called the Elizabethtown grant, in New-Jersey; which, as it relates to another colony, I should not have mentioned, but for the opportunity to caution the reader against the representation of that controversy contained in Douglass's summary. I have sufficient reasons to justify my charging that account with partiality and mistakes; and for proofs, refer to the printed answer in chancery, published in the year 1751.</P>
<P>Besides the chief command of this province Nicolls had a joint power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The commission from king Charles II. was dated the 26th of April 1664. After a recital of disputes concerning limits in New-England, and that addresses had been sent home from the Indian natives, complaining of abuses re∣ceived from the English subjects; the commissioners, or any three or two of them, of which Nicolls was to be one, were authorised to visit the New-England colonies, and de∣termine all complaints, military, civil, and criminal, accord∣ing to their discretion, and such instructions, as they might receive from the crown.</NOTE> with sir Robert Carr, Carteret, and Mave∣rick,
<PB N="38" REF="024800_0034_0FCD629E0F5DA3B8"/>to settle the contested boundaries of certain great pa∣tents. Hence we find, that three of them had a conference with several gentlemen from Connecticut, respecting the limits of this and that colony. The result was an adjudica∣tion, in these words:</P>

<P>By virtue of his majesty's commission, we have heard the difference, about the bounds of the patents granted to his royal highness the duke of York, and his majesty's co∣lony of Connecticut, and having deliberately considered all the reasons alleged. by mr. Allyn, sen. mr. Gold, mr.

We also order and declare, that the creek, or river, called Ma∣maroneck, which is reputed to be about thirteen miles to the east of West-chester, and a line drawn from the east point or side, where the fresh water falls into the salt, at high water mark, north-north-west to the line of the Mas∣sachusetts, be the western bounds of the said colony of Con∣necticut, and all plantations lying westward of that creek and line so drawn, to be under his royal highness's govern∣ment; and all plantations lying eastward of that creek and line, to be under the government of Connecticut.

At the time of this determination, about two thirds of Long Island were possessed by people from New-England, who had gradually encroached upon the Dutch. As to the settlement between New York and Connecticut on the main, it has always been considered by the former, as founded upon ignorance and fraud<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The town of Rye was settled under Connecticut; and the grant from that colony is bounded by this line of di∣vision.</NOTE>. The station at Mama∣roneck was about 30 miles from New York, from Albany 150. The general course of the river is about north 12 or 150 east: and hence it is evident, that a north-north-west line will soon intersect the river, and consequently leave the Dutch country, but a little before surrendered to col. Carteret, out of the province of New-York. It has been generally esteemed, that the Connecticut commissioners in this affair, took advantage of the duke's agents, who were ignorant of the geography of the country.</P>
<P>About the close of the year, the estate of the West-India company was seized and confiscated, hostilities being ac∣tually commenced in Europe as well as America, though no declarations of war had yet been published by either of the contending parties. A great dispute between the inhabi∣tants of Jamaica on Long Island, which was adjusted by col. Nicolls, on the 2d of January, 1665, gave rise to a salutary institution, which has in part obtained ever since. The con∣troversy respected Indian deeds; and thenceforth it was ordained, that no purchase from the Indians, without the governor's license, executed in his presence, should be valid. The strength and numbers of the natives rendered it ne∣cessary to purchase their rights; and to prevent their fre∣quent selling the same tract, it was expedient, that the bar∣gain should be attended with some considerable solem∣nity.</P>
<P>Another instance of col. Nicolls's prudence, was his gra∣dual introduction of the English methods of government. It was not till the 12th of June, this year, that he incorpo∣rated the inhabitants of New York, under the care of a mayor, five aldermen, and a sheriff. Till this time, the ci∣ty was ruled by a scout, burgomasters, and schepens.</P>
<P>In March preceding, there was a great convention, be∣fore the governor at Hempstead, of two deputies from every town on Long Island, empowered to bind their con∣stituents. The design of their meeting was to adjust the li∣mits
<PB N="40" REF="024800_0036_0FCD62A28F7B70A0"/>of their townships for the preservation of the public peace.</P>
<P>The war being proclaimed at London, on the fourth of this month, Nicolls received the account of it in June, with a letter from the lord chancellor, informing him, that de Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, had orders to visit New York. His lordship was misinformed, or the admiral was diverted from the enterprise; for the English peaceably held the possession of the country during the whole war, which was concluded on the 21st of July, 1667, by the treaty of Broda. Some are of opinion, that the exchange made with the Dutch for Surinam, which they had taken from us, was ad∣vantageous to the nation: but these judges do not consider, that it would have been impossible for the Dutch to have preserved this colony against the increasing strength of the people in New-England, Maryland, and Virginia.</P>
<P>After an administration of three years, Nicolls returned to England. The time, during his short residence here, was almost wholly taken up in confirming the ancient Dutch grants. He erected no courts of justice, but took upon him∣self the sole decision of all controversies whatsoever. Com∣plaints came before him by petition; upon which he gave a day to the parties, and, after a summary hearing, pro∣nounced judgment. His determinations were called edicts, and executed by the sheriffs he had appointed. It is much to his honour, that notwithstanding all this plenitude of power, he governed the province with integrity and mode∣ration. A representation from the inhabitants of Long Island, to the general court of Connecticut, made about the time of the revolution, commends him as a man of an easy and benevolent disposition: and this testimonial is the more to be relied upon, because the design of the writers, was by a detail of their grievances, to induce the colony of Con∣necticut to take them under its immediate protection.</P>
<P>Francis Lovelace, a colonel, was appointed by the duke, to succeed Nicolls in the government of the province, which he began to exercise in May, 1667. As he was a man of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat moderation, the people lived very peaceably under him, till the re-surrender of the colony, which put an end to his power, and is the only event, that signalized his ad∣ministration.</P>
<P>The ambitious designs of Louis XIV. against the Dutch, gave rise to our war with the states general in 1672. Charles II. a prince sunk in pleasures, prosligate, and poor, was easily detached from his alliance with the Dutch, by the intrigues and pecuniary promises of the French king. The
<PB N="41" REF="024800_0037_0FCD62A6CF52AF08"/>following passage from a fine writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire's age of Louis XIV.</NOTE>, shows that his pre∣tences for entering into the war, were perfectly groundless and trifling.</P>
<P>"The king of England, on his side, reproached them with disrespect, in not directing their fleet to lower the flag be∣fore an English ship: and they were also accused in regard to a certain picture, wherein Cornelius de Witt, brother to the pensionary, war painted with the attributes of a conque∣ror. Ships were represented in the back ground of the piece, either taken or burnt. Cornelius de Witt, who had really had a great share in the maritime exploits against England, had permitted this trifling memorial of his glory: but the picture, which was in a manner unknown, was deposited in a chamber wherein scarce any body ever entered. The English ministers, who presented the complaints of their king against Holland, in writing, therein mentioned certain abusive pictures. The states, who always translated the me∣morials of ambassadors into French, having rendered abu∣sive, by the words <HI>fautifs trompeurs,</HI> they replied, that they did not know what these <HI>roguish pictures (ces tableaux trompeurs)</HI> were. In reality, it never in the least entered into their thoughts, that it concerned this portrait of one of their citizens; nor did they ever conceive this could be a pretence for declaring war."</P>
<P>A few Dutch ships arrived the year after, on the 30th of July, under Staten island, at the distance of a few miles from the city of New York. John Manning, a captain of an independent company, had at that time the command of the fort, and by a messenger, sent down to the squadron, treach∣erously made his peace with the enemy. On that very day, the Dutch ships came up, moored under the fort, landed their men, and entered the garrison, without giving or re∣ceiving a shot. A council of war was afterwards held at the stadt house, at which were present</P>
<P>Cornelius Evertse, jun, Jacob Benkes, commodores. An∣thony Colve, Nicholas Bowes, Abraham Ferd. Van Zyll, captains.</P>
<P>All the magistrates and constables from East Jersey, Long Island, Esopus, and Albany, were immediately summoned to New York; and the major part of them swore allegiance to the states general, and the prince of Orange. Col. Love∣lace was ordered to depart the province, but afterwards ob∣tained leave to return to England with commodore Benkes.
<PB N="42" REF="024800_0038_0FCD62A7D6DA99E8"/>It has often been insisted on, that this conquest did not ex∣tend to the whole province of New-Jersey; but upon what foundation, I cannot discover. From the Dutch records, it appears, that deputies were sent by the people inhabiting the country, even so far westward as Delaware river, who, in the name of their principals, made a declaration of their submission; in return for which, certain privileges were granted to them, and three judicatories erected at Niewer Amstel, Upland, and Hoer Kill. Colve's commission to be governor of this country is worth printing, because it shows the extent of the Dutch claims. The translation runs thus:</P>

<P>The Dutch governor enjoyed his office but a very short season; for on the 9th of February, 1674, the treaty of peace between England and the states general was signed at Westminster; the sixth article of which, restored this coun∣try to the English. The terms of it were generally, "that whatsoever countries, islands, towns, ports, castles, or forts, have or shall be taken on both sides, since the time that the late unhappy war broke out, either in Europe or elsewhere, shall be restored to the former lord and proprietor, in the same condition they shall be in, when the peace itself shall be proclaimed; after which time, there shall be no spoil nor plunder of the inhabitants, no demolition of fortifica∣tions, nor carrying away of guns, powder or military stores, which belonged to any castle or fort, at the time when it was taken."</P>
<P>The lenity, which began the administration of col. Ni∣colls, was continued under Lovelace. He appears to have been a man, rather of a phlegmatic than an enterprising disposition, always pursuing the common road, and scarcely ever acting without the aid of his council. Instead of taking upon himself the sole determination of judicial controver∣sies, after the example of his predecessor, he called to his assistance a few justices of the peace. This, which was cal∣led the court of assizes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a court both of law and equity, for the trial of causes of 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards, and ordinarily sat but once a year. Subordinate to this, were the town courts and ses∣sions; the former took cognizance of actions under 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the latter, of suits between that sum and twenty pounds: seven constables and overseers were judges in the first; and in the last, the justices of the peace, with a jury of seven men. The verdict of the majority was sufficient.</NOTE>, was the principal law judicatory in those times. The legislative power under the duke, was vested entirely in the governor and council. A third estate might then be easily dispensed with, for the charge of the
<PB N="44" REF="024800_0040_0FCD62AACF7C5718"/>province was small<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The manner of raising public money, was established by col. Nicolls on the first of June 1665, and was thus. The high sheriff issued a warrant annually, to the high consta∣bles of every district, and they sent theirs to the petty con∣stables; who, with the overseers of each town, made a list of all male persons above sixteen years of age, with an esti∣mate of their rent and personal estates, and then taxed them according to certain rates, prescribed by a law. After the assessment was returned to the high sheriff, and approved by the governor, the constables received warrants for levying the taxes by distress and sale.</NOTE>, and in a great measure defrayed by his royal highness, the proprietor of the country.</P>
<P>Upon conclusion of the peace in 1674, the duke of York, to remove all controversy respecting his property, obtained a new patent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some are of opinion, that the second patent was un∣necessary, the duke being revested per post liminium. This matter has been often disputed, in the ejectments between the New-Jersey proprietors and the Elizabethtown paten∣tees. In New York, the right of post liminy was disregarded, and perhaps unknown: for there are many instances, es∣pecially on Long Island, of new grants from sir Edmond Andross, for lands patented under Nicolls and Lovelace, by which the quit-rents have been artfully enlarged.</NOTE> from the king, dated the 29th of June, for the lands granted in 1664, and two days after commissioned major, afterwards sir Edmond Andross to be governor of his territories in America. After the resignation of this pro∣vince, which was made to him by the Dutch possessors, on the 31st of October following, he called a court martial, to try Manning for his treacherous and cowardly surrender. The articles of accusation exhibited against him, were in substance,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the said Manning, on the 28th of July, 1673, hav∣ing notice of the approach of the enemy's fleet, did not en∣deavour to put the garrison in a posture of defence; but, on the contrary, slighted such as offered their assistance.</P>
<P N="2">II. That while the fleet was at anchor under Staten Island, on the 30th of July, he treacherously sent on board to treat with the enemy, to the great discouragement of the gar∣rison.</P>
<P N="3">III. That he suffered the fleet to moor under the fort, forbidding a gen to be fired, on pain of death.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="45" REF="024800_0041_0FCD62AD94BF1C88"/>
IV. That he permitted the enemy to land, without the least opposition.</P>
<P N="5">V. That, shortly after he had sent persons to treat with the Dutch commodores, he struck his flag, even before the enemy were in sight of the garrison, the fort being in a condition, and the men desirous, to fight.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And lastly, that he treacherously caused the fort gates to be opened, and cowardly and basely let in the enemy, yielding the garrison without articles.</P>
<P>This scandalous charge, which Manning on his trial con∣fessed to be true, is less surprising, than the lenity of the sentence pronounced against him. It was this, that though he deserved death, yet because he had, since the surrender, been in England, and seen the king and the duke, it was adjudge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that his sword should be broke over his head in public, before the city hall, and himself rendered incapa∣ble of wearing a sword, and of serving his majesty for the future, in any public trust in the government.</P>
<P>This light censure is however no proof, that sir Edmond was a man of a merciful disposition; the historians of New-England, where he was afterwards governor, justly trans∣mit him to posterity, under the odious character of a syco∣phantic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l to the duke, and an arbitrary tyrant over the people committed to his care. He knew no law, but the will of his master: and Kirk and Jefferies were not fit∣ter instruments than he to execute the despotic projects of James II.</P>
<P>In the year 1675, Nicholas Renslaer, a Dutch clergyman, arrived here. He claimed the manor of Renslaerwick, and was recommended by the duke to sir Edmond Andross for a living in one of the churches at New-York, or Albany, probably to serve the popish cause<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another reason is assigned for the favour he met with from the crown. It is said, that while Charles II. was an exile, he predicted the day of his restoration. The people of Albany had a high opinion of his prophetic spirit, and many strange tales about him still prevail there. The parson made nothing of his claim, the manor being afterwards granted, by col. Dongan, to Killian Van Renslaer, a distant relation. This extensive tract, by the Dutch called a colony, is an oblong, extending 24 miles upon Hudson's river, and as many on each side. The patent of confirmation was issued by special direction from the king, and is the most liberal, in the privileges it grants, of any one in the province.</NOTE>. Niewenhyt, minister
<PB N="46" REF="024800_0042_0FCD62AE90DE63D0"/>of the church at Albany, disputed his right to administer the sacraments; because he had received an episcopal or∣dination, and was not app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oved by the classis of Amsterdam, to which the Dutch churches here hold themselves subordi∣nate. In this controversy, the governor took the part of Renilaer, and accordingly summoned Niewenhyt before him, to answer for his conduct. This minister was treated wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h such singular contempt, and so frequently harrassed by fruitless and expensive attendances before the council, that the dispute became interesting, and the greater part of the people resented the usage he met with. Hence we find, that the magistrates of Albany, soon after imprisoned Ren∣slaer, for several dubious words (as they are called in the record) delivered in a sermon. The governor, on the other hand, ordered him to be released, and summoned the ma∣gistrates to attend him at New York. Warrants were then issued to compel them to give security in 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> each, to make out good cause for confining the minister. Leisler, who was one of them, refused to comply with the warrant, and was thrown into gaol. Sir Edmond, fearful that a great party would rise up against him, was at last compelled to discontinue his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and to refer the controversy to the determination of the consistory of the Dutch church at Albany. It is perhaps not improbable, that these popish measures sowed the seeds of that aversion to the duke's government, which afterwards produced those violent convulsions in the province under Leisler, at the time of the revolution, in favour of the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>If sir Edmond Andross's administration at New-York, appears to be less exceptionable, than while he commanded at Boston, it was through want of more opportunities to show himself in his true light. The main course of his pub∣lic proceedings, during his continuance in the province, was spent in the ordinary acts of government, which then principally consisted in passing grants to the subject, and presiding in the court of assize, established by col. Lovelace. The public exigencies were now in part supplied by a kind of benevolence; the badge of bad times! This appears in an entry on the records, of a letter of May the 5th, 1676, from governor And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss, to several towns on Long Island, desiring to know, what sums they would contribute to∣wards the war. Near the close of his administration, he thought proper to quarrel with Philip Carteret, who in 1680, exercised the government of East Jersey, under a commission from sir Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge Carteret, dated the 31st of Ju∣ly, 1675. Andross disputed his right, and seized and brought
<PB N="47" REF="024800_0043_0FCD62B31BFA2F88"/>him prisoner to New-York; for which it is said he lost his own government; but whoever considers that sir Edmond was immediately preferred to be governor of Boston, will rather believe, that the duke superseded him for some other reasons.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the succeeding administration, in which our Indian affairs began to have a powerful influence upon the public measures, it may not be improper to pre∣sent the reader with a summary view of the history and character of the five nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the Dutch called Maquaas, by the French Iroquois, and by us, five nations, six nations, and lately the confede∣rates. They are greatly diminished, and consist now only of about twelve hundred sighting men.</NOTE>. These, of all those innumer∣able tribes of savages, which inhabit the northern part of America, are of most importance to us and the French, both on account of their vicinity and warlike disposition. Before the late incorporation of the Tuscaroras, a people driven by the inhabitants of Carolina from the frontiers of Vir∣ginia, they consisted of five confederate cantons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Tuscaroras were received upon a supposition, that they were originally of the same stock with the five nations, because there is some similitude between their languages.</NOTE>. What in particular gave rise to this league, and when it took place, are questions which neither the natives, nor Europeans, pretend to answer. Each of these nations is divided into three families, or clans, of different ranks, bearing for their arms, and being distinguished by the names of, the tortoise, the bear, and the wolf<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Their instruments of conveyances are signed by signa∣tures, which they make with a pen, representing these animals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No people in the world, perhaps, have higher notions than these Indians, of military glory. All the surrounding nations have felt the effects of their prowess; and many not only became their tributaries, but were so subjugated to their power, that without their consent, they durst not commence either peace or war.</P>
<P>Though a regular police for the preservation of har∣mony within, and the defence of the state against invasions from without, is not to be expected from the people of whom I am now writing, yet perhaps, they have paid more attention to it than is generally allowed. Their government is suited to their condition. A people whose riches consist
<PB N="48" REF="024800_0044_0FCD62B4B080A428"/>not so much in abundance, as in a freedom from want<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">An Indian, in answer to his question, what the white people meant by covetousness? was told by another, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> signified, a desire of more than a man had need of. That's st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange! said the querist.</NOTE>— who are circumscribed by no boundaries, who live by hunt∣ing, and not by agriculture—must always be free, and therefore subject to no other authority, than such as con∣sists with the liberty necessarily arising from their circum∣stances. All their affairs, whether respecting peace or war, are under the direction of their sachems, or chief men. Great exploits and public virtue procure the esteem of a people, and qualify a man to advise in council, and execute the plan concerted for the advantage of his country: thus whoever appears to the Indians in this advantageous light, commences a sachem without any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her ceremony.</P>
<P>As there is no other way of arriving at this dignity, so it ceases, unless an uniform zeal and activity for the common good, is uninterruptedly continued. Some have thought it hereditary; but that is a mistake. The son is, indeed, re∣spected for his father's services; but, without personal me∣rit, he can never share in the government; which, were it otherwise, must sink into perfect disgrace. The children of such as are distinguished for their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riotism, moved by the consideration of their birth, and the perpetual incitements to virtue constantly inculcated into them, imitate their fa∣thers' exploits, and thus attain to the same honours and in∣fluence; which accounts for the opinion that the title and power of sachem is hereditary.</P>
<P>Each of these republics has its own particular chiefs, who hear and determine all complaints in council; and, though they have no officers for the execution of justice, yet their decree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are always obeyed, from the general reproach that would follow a contempt of their advice. The condition of this people exemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s them from factions, the common disease of popular governments. It is impossible to gain a party amongst them by indirect means; for no man has either honour, riches, or power to bestow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned and judicious author of the spirit of laws, speaking of a people who have a fixed property in lands, observes, "that if a chief would deprive them of their li∣berty, they would immediately go and seek it under ano∣ther, or retire into the woods, and live there with their families." The five nations can never be enslaved, till they grow rich by agriculture and commerce. Property is the most permanent basis of power. The authority of a sachem depending only upon his reputation for wisdom and cou∣rage, must be weak and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rious, and therefore safe to the people.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="024800_0045_0FCD62B7EF3D8568"/>
All affairs, which concern the general interest, are deter∣mined in a great assembly of the chiefs of each canton, usually held at Onondaga, the centre of their country. Up∣on emergencies, they act separately; but nothing can bind the league, but the voice of the general convention.</P>
<P>The French, upon the maxim, <HI>divide et impera,</HI> have tried all possible means to divide these republics, and some∣times have even sown great jealousies among them. In con∣sequence of this plan, they have seduced many families to withdraw to Canada, and there settled them in regular towns, under the command of a fort, and the tuition of missionaries.</P>
<P>The manners of these savages are as simple as their go∣vernment. Their houses are a few crotched stakes thrust into the ground, and overlaid with bark. A fire is kindled in the middle, and an aperture left at the top for the con∣veyance of the smoke. Whenever a considerable number of those huts are collected, they have a castle, as it is cal∣led, consisting of a square without bastions, surrounded with pallisadoes. They have no other fortification: and this is only designed as an asylum for their old men, their wives, and children, while the rest are gone out to war. They live almost entirely without care. While the women, or squaws, cultivate a little spot of ground for corn, the men employ themselves in hunting. As to clothes, they use a blanket girt at the waist, and thrown loosely over their shoulders; som of their women, indeed. have besides this, a sort of a petticoat, and a few of their men wear shirts; but the greater part of them are generally half naked. In winter, their legs are covered with stockings of blanket, and their feet with socks of deer skin. Many of them are fond to or∣naments, and their taste is very singular. I have seen rings affixed, not only to their ears, but their noses. Bracelets of silver and brass round their wrists, are very common. The women plait their hair, and tie it up behind in a bag, per∣haps in imitation of the French beaux in Canada. Though the Indians are capable of sustaining great hardships, yet they cannot endure much labour, being rather fleet, than strong. Their men are taller than the Europeans, rarely
<PB N="50" REF="024800_0046_0FCD62B9128A0C48"/>corpulent, always beardless,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Because they pluck out the hairs. The French writers, who say they have naturally no beards, are mistaken; and the reasons they assign for it are ridiculous.</NOTE> straight limbed, of a tawny complexion, and black, uncurled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. In their food, they have no manner of delivery; for though venison is their ordinary diet, yet sometimes they eat dogs, bears, and even snakes. Their cookery is of two kinds, boiled or roasted; to perform the latter, the meat is penetrated by a short sharp stick set in the ground, inclining towards the fire, and turned as occasion requires. They are hospitable to stran∣gers; though few Europeans would relish their highest fa∣vours of this kind; for they are very nasty both in their governments and food. Every man has his own wise, whom he takes and leaves at pleasure: a plurality, however, at the some time, is by no means admitted among them. They have been generally commended for their chastity; but I am informed by good authority. that they are very las∣civious, and that the women, to avoid reproach, frequently destroy the foetus in the womb. They are so perfectly free, that unless their children, who generally assist the mother, may be called servants, they have none. The men frequent∣ly associate themselves for conversation, by which means they not only preserve the remembrance of their wars, and treaties, but diffuse among their youths, incitements to military glory, as well as instruction in all the subtilties of war.</P>
<P>Since they became acquainted with the Europeans, their warlike apparatus is a musket, hatcher<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Hence, to take up the hatcher, is with them a phrase signifying to declare war; as, on the contrary, to bury it denotes the establishment of a peace.</NOTE>, and a long knife. Their boys still accustom themselves to bows and arrows, and are so dextrous in the use of them, that a lad of six∣teen, will strike an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> English shilling five times in ten, at twelve or fourteen yards distance. Their men are excellent marksmen, both with the gun and hatcher; their dexterity at the latter is very extraordinary; for they rarely miss the object, though at a considerable distance. The hatcher in the flight perpetually turns round, and yet always strikes the mark with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge.</P>
<P>Before they go out, they have a feast upon dogs' flesh, and a great war dance. At these, the warriors, who are frightfully painted with vermillion, rise up, and sing their
<PB N="51" REF="024800_0047_0FCD62BB24BA4478"/>own exploits, or those of their ancestors, and thereby kin∣dle a military enthusiasm in the whole company. The day after the dance, they march out a few miles in a row, ob∣serving a profound silence. The procession being ended, they strip the bark from a large oak, and paint the design of their expedition on the naked trunk. The figure of a canoe, with the number of men in it, determines the strength of their party; and by a deer, a fox, or some other emblem painted at the head of it, we discover against what nation they are gone out.</P>
<P>The five nations being devoted to war, every art is con∣trived to diffuse a military spirit through the whole body of their people. The ceremonies attending the return of a party, seem calculated in particular for that purpose. The day before they enter the village, two heralds advance, and, at a small distance, set up a yell, which, by its modula∣tion, intimates either good or bad news. If the former, the village is alarmed, and an entertainment provided for the conquerors, who, in the mean time, approach in sight: one of them bears the scalps stretched over a bow, and elevated upon a long pole. The boldest man in the town comes out, and receives it, and instantly flies to the hut where the rest are collected. If he is overtaken, he is beaten unmercifully: but if he out-runs the pursuer, he participates in the ho∣nour of the victors, who, at their first entrance, receive no compliments, nor speak a single word till the end of the feast. Their parents, wives, and children, then are admit∣ted, and treat them with the profoundest respect. After these salutations, one of the conquerors is appointed to re∣late the whole adventure, to which the rest attentively lis∣ten, without asking a question, and the whole concludes with a savage dance.</P>
<P>The Indians never fight in the field, or upon equal terms; but always sculk and attack, by surprise, in small parties, meeting every night at a place of rendezvous. Scarcely any enemy can escape them; for by the disposition of the grass and leaves, they follow his track with great speed any where but over a rock. Their barbarity is shocking to human nature. Women and children they generally kill and scalp, because they would retard their progress; but the men they carry into captivity. If any woman has lost a relation, and inclines to receive the prisoner in his stead, he not only escapes a series of the most inhuman tortures, and death itself, but enjoys every immunity they can be∣stow, and is esteemed a member of the family into which he is adopted. To part with him would be the most igno∣minious
<PB N="52" REF="024800_0048_0FCD62BC18580A58"/>conduct, and considered as selling the blood of the deceased; and for this reason it is not without the greatest difficulty, that a captive is redeemed.</P>
<P>When the Indians incline to peace, a messenger is sent to the enemy with a pipe, the bowl of which is made of soft, red marble; and a long reed beautifully painted, and a∣dorned with the gay plumage of birds, forms the stem. This is his infallible protection from any assault on the way. The envoy makes his proposals to the enemy, who, if they approve them, ratify the preliminaries to the peace, by smoking through the pipe, and from that instant a general cessation of arms takes place. The French call it a calume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. It is used, as far as I can learn, by all the Indian nations up∣on the continent. The rights of it are esteemed sacred, and have been only invaded by the flat heads; in just indigna∣tion for which, the confederates maintained a war with them for near thirty years.</P>
<P>As to the language of the five nations, the best account I have had of it, is contained in a letter from the reverend mr. Spencer, who resided among them in the year 1748, be∣ing then a missionary from the Scotch society for propaga∣ting christian knowledge. He writes thus:</P>

<P>Except the Tuscaroras, all the six nations speak a lan∣guage radically the same. It is very masculine and sonorous, abounding with gutturals and strong aspirations, but with∣out labials. Its solemn grave tone is owing to the generosity of its feet, as you will observe in the following translation of the Lord's prayer, in which I have distinguished the time of every syllable by the common marks used in prosody<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If we had a good dictionary marking the quantity as well as emphasis of every syllable in the English language, it would conduce to an accuracy and uniformity of pronun∣ciation. The dignity of style, so far as the ear is concerned, consists principally in generous feet; and perhaps it may be a just remark, that no sentence, unless in a dialogue, ends well without a full sound. Gordon and Fordyce rarely swerve from this rule: and mr. Mason, an ingenious author, has lately written with great applause on this attribute of style.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The extraordinary length of Indian words, and the guttural aspirations, necessary in pronouncing them, ren∣der the speech extremely rough and difficult. The verbs ne∣ver change in their terminations, as in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but all their variations are prefixed. Besides the singular and plural, they have also the dual number. A strange transposition of syllables of different words, eupho∣niae gratia, is very common in the Indian tongue, of which I will give an instance. Ogīllă signifies fire, and căwāūn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ā great; but instead of joining the adjective and substantive to say great fire, căwāūnnā ōgillă, both words would be blen∣ded into this one, cŏ-gĭllă-wāūnnā. The dialect of the Oney∣das, is softer than that of the other nations; and the reason is, because they have more vowels, and often supply the place of harsh letters with liquids. Instead of R, they always use L: Rebecca would be pronounced Lequecca.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The art of public speaking is in high esteem among the Indians, and much studied. They are extremely fond of method, and displeased with an irregular harangue, because it is difficult to be remembered. When they answer, they repeat the whole, reducing it into strict order. Their speeches are short, and the sense conveyed in strong meta∣phors. In conversation they are sprightly, but solemn and serious in their messages, relating to public affairs. Their speakers deliver themselves with surprising force and great propriety of gesture. The fierceness of their countenances, the flowing blanket, elevated tone, naked arm and erect stature, with a half circle of auditors seated on the ground, and in the open air, cannot but impress upon the mind, a lively idea of the ancient orators of Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>At the close of every important part of the speech, rati∣fying an old covenant, or creating a new one, a belt is ge∣nerally given, to perpetuate the remembrance of the trans∣action. These belts are about four inches wide, and thirty in length. They consist of strings of conque shell beads fas∣tened together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those beads, which pass for money, are called by the Indians, wampum, and by the Dutch, sewant. Six beads were formerly valued at a stiver. There are always several poor families at Albany, who support themselves by coin∣ing this cash for the traders.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="024800_0050_0FCD62C2DDD5AE18"/>
With respect to religion, the Indians may be said to be under the thickest gloom of ignorance. If they have any, which is much to be questioned, those who affirm it, will find it difficult to tell us wherein it consists. They have nei∣ther priest, nor temple, sacrifice nor altar. Some traces, in∣deed, appear, of the original law written upon their hearts; but they have no system of doctrines, nor any rites and modes of public worship. They are sunk, unspeakably be∣neath the polite pagans of antiquity. Some confused no∣tions, indeed, of beings superior to themselves, they have, but of the Deity and his natural and moral perfections, no proper or tolerable conceptions; and of his general and particular providence they know nothing. They profess no obligations to him, nor acknowledge their dependence up∣on him. Some of them, it is said, are of opinion, that there are two distinct, powerful beings, one able to help, the other to do them harm. The latter they venerate most, and some allege that they address him by a kind of prayer. Though there are no public monuments of idolatry to be seen in their country, yet the missionaries have discovered coarse imagery in wooden trinkets, in the hands of their jugglers, which the converts deliver up as detestable. The sight of them, would remind a man of letters, of the lares and penates of the ancients; but no certain judgment can be drawn of their use. The Indians sometimes assemble in large numbers, and retire far into the wilderness, where they eat and drink in a profuse manner. These conventions are called Kenticoys. Some esteem them to be debauched revels or Bacchanalia: but those who have privately fol∣lowed them into these recesses, give such accounts of their conduct, as naturally lead one to imagine, that they pay a Joint homage and supplication to some invisible being. If we suppose they have a religion, it is worse than none, and raises in the generous mind, most melancholy ideas of their depraved condition. Little has been done to illuminate these dark corners of the earth, with the light of the gos∣pel. The French priests boast, indeed, of their converts, but they have made more proselytes to polities than reli∣gion. Queen Anne sent a missionary among them, and gave him an appointment out of the privy purse. He was a man
<PB N="55" REF="024800_0051_0FCD62C455233588"/>of a good life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ot slow parts, and his success very inconsi∣derable. The reverend mr. Barclay afterwards resided among the Mohawks; but no suitable provision being made for an interpreter, he was obliged to break up the mission. If the English society for propagating the gospel, that tru∣ly venerable body, instead of maintaining missionaries in rich christian congregations along the continent, expended half the amount of their annual contributions on the evan∣gelists among the heathen, besides the unspeakable reli∣gious benefits that would, it is to be hoped, accrue to the natives, such a proceeding would conduce greatly to the safety of our colonies, and his majesty's service. Much has been written upon this subject in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See mr. Hobart's letters to the episcopalians in New-England: the account of the Scotch mission at Stockbridge: Douglass's summary, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and why no∣thing to purpose has yet been attempted in England, to∣wards so laudable a design, can only be attributed to the amazing falsehoods and misrepresentations, by which some of the missionaries have long imposed upon benevolent: minds in Great Britain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is notorious to all who give themselves the trou∣ble of perusing the abstracts of their accounts published in England. It would be 2 very agreeable office to me, on this occasion, to distinguish the innocent from the guilty, but that such a task would infallibly raise up a host of enemies. Many of the missionaries are men of learning and exem∣plary morals. These in America are known and honoured, and cannot be prejudiced by an indiscriminate censure. Their joining in a representation for distinguishing the de∣linquents, who are a disgrace to the cloth, will serve as a full vindication of themselves to the society. Mr. Ogilvie is, I believe, the only person now employed by that charitable corporation among the Indians, and the greatest part even of his charge is in the city of Albany. All the Scotch mis∣sionaries are among the heathen, and their success has been sufficient to encourage any future attempts. There is a re∣gular society of Indian converts in New Jersey; and it is worthy of remark, that not one of them has apostatized into heathenism. Some of them have made such proficien∣cies in practical religion, as ought to shame many of us, who boast the illuminating aids of our native christianity. Not one of these Indians has been concerned in those bar∣barous irruptions, which have lately deluged the frontiers of the south-western provinces, with the blood of several hundred innocents of every age and sex. At the com∣mencement of these ravages, they flew into the settlements, and put themselves under the protection of the govern∣ment. These Indians no sooner became christians, than they openly professed their loyalty to king George; and there∣fore to contribute to their conversion, was as truly politic, as nobly christian. Those colonies which have done most for this charitable design, have escaped best from the late distressing calamities. Of all the missionaries, mr. David Brainerd, who recovered these Indians from the darkness of paganism, was most successful. He died the 9th of Octo∣ber 1747, a victim to his extreme mortification and inextin∣guishable zeal, for the prosperity of his mission. Those who are curious to enquire particularly into the effects of his indefatigable industry, may have recourse to his journal, published at Philadelphia, by the American correspondents of the Scotch society, in whose service he was employed. Dr. Doughlass, ever ready to do honour to his native coun∣try, after remarking that this self-denying clergyman rode about 400 miles, in the year 1744, with an air of approba∣tion, asks, "Is there any missionary, from any of the soci∣eties, for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, that has reported the like?"</NOTE>.</P>

As to the history of the five nations, before their acquain∣tance with the Europeans, it is wrapt up in the darkness of antiquity. It is said that their first residence was in the country about Montreal; and that the superior strength of the Adirondacs, whom the French call Algonquins, drove them into their present possessions, lying on the south side of the Mohawks river, and the great lake Ontario<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, in partiality to the French, limits the coun∣try of the five nations, on the north, to the 44th degree of latitude; according to which, all the country on the north side of the lake Ontario, and the river issuing thence to Montreal, together with a considerable tract of land on the south side of that river, belongs to the French. Hennepin, a recollect friar, has more regard to truth than the jesuit; for he tells us in effect, that the Iroquois possessed the lands on the north, as well as the south side of the lake, and men∣tions several of their villages in 1679, viz. Tejajahon, Kente, and Ganneousse. The map in his book agrees with the text. Charlevoix is at variance with his geographer; for mr. Bellin, besides laying down these towns in the map, contained in the fifth volume, writes on the north side of the protraction of lake Ontario, <HI>les Iroquois du nord.</HI></NOTE>. To∣wards the close of those disputes, which continued for a
<PB N="57" REF="024800_0053_0FCD62C79AF8BD48"/>great series of years, the confederates gained advantages over the Adirondacs, and struck a general terror into all the other Indians. The Hurons on the north side of the lake Erie, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Indians on the south side, were totally conquered and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ispersed. The French who settled Canada in 1603, took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>brage at their success, and began a war with them, which had well nigh ruined the new colony. In autumn 1665, m. Courcelles, the governor, sent, out a party against the Mohawks. Through ignorance of the country, and the want of snow-shoes, they were almost pe∣rished, when they fell in with Schenectady. And even there the Indians would have sacrificed them to their barbarous rage, had not Corlear, a Dutchman, interposed to protect them. For this seasonable hospitality, the French governor invited him to Canada, but he was unfortunately drowned in his passage through the lake Champlain. It is in honour of this man, who was a favourite of the Indians, that the governors of New York, in all their treaties, are addressed by the name of Corlear. Twenty light companies of foot, and the whole militia of Canada, marched the next spring into the country of the Mohawks: but their success was vastly unequal to the charge and labour of such a tedious march of 700 miles through an uncultivated desart; for the Indians, on their approach, retired into the woods, leaving behind them some old sachems, who preferred death to life, to glut the fury of their enemies. The emptiness of this parade on the one hand, and the Indian fearfulness of fire arms on the other, brought about a peace in 1667, which continued for several years after. In this interval, both the English and French cultivated a trade with the natives, very profitable to both nations. The latter, however, were most politic and vigorous, and filled the Indian country with their missionaries. The sieur Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, the very year in which the peace was concluded, travelled about 1200 miles west-ward, making proselytes of the Indians every where to the French interest. Courcelles appears to have been a man of art and industry. He took every measure in his power for the defence of Canada. To prevent the irruptions of the five nations, by the way of lake Champlain, he built seve∣ral forts in 1665, between that and the mouth of the river Sorel. In 1672, just before his return to France, under pre∣tence
<PB N="58" REF="024800_0054_0FCD62CBC59C1C88"/>of treating with the Indians more commodiously, but in reality, as Charlevoix expresses it, "to bridle them," he ob∣tained their leave to erect a fort at Cadaraqui, or lake Onta∣rio, which count Fromenac, his successor, completed the fol∣lowing spring, and called after his own name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In May 1721, it was a square, with four bastions, built of stone, being a quarter of a French league in circumfe∣rence; before it, are many small islands, and a good har∣bour, and behind it a morass. Charlevoix.</NOTE>. The com∣mand of it was afterwards given to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de la Salle, who, in 1678, rebuilt it with stone. This enterprising person, the same year, launched a bark of ten tons into the lake Ontario, and another of sixty tons, the year after, into lake Erie; about which time he enclosed with pallisadoes, a lit∣tle spot at Niagara.</P>
<P>Though the duke of York had preferred col. Thomas Dongan to the government of this province on the 30th of September, 1682, he did not arrive here till the 27th of August, in the following year. He was a man of integrity, moderation, and genteel manners, and, though a professed papist, may be classed among the best of our governors.</P>
<P>The people, who had been formerly ruled at the will of the duke's deputies, began their first participation in the legislative power under col. Dongan; for shortly after his arrival, he issued orders to the sheriffs, to summon the free∣holders for choosing representatives, to meet him in assem∣bly on the 17th of October, 1683. Nothing could be more agreeable to the people, who, whether Dutch or English, were born the subjects of a free state; nor, indeed, was the change of less advantage to the duke, than to the inhabi∣tants. For such a general disgust had prevailed, and in par∣ticular in Long Island, against the old form which col. Ni∣colls had introduced, as threatened the total subversion of the public tranquillity. Col. Dongan saw the disaffection of the people at the east end of the island, for he landed there on his first arrival in the country; and to extinguish the fire of discontent, then impatient to burst out, gave them his promise, that no laws or rates for the future should be imposed, but by a general assembly. Doubtless, this altera∣tion was agreeable to the duke's orders, who had been strongly importuned for it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The petition to his royal highness was drawn by the council, the aldermen of New York, and the justices of the peace at the court of assize, the 29th of June, 1681. I have seen a copy in the hands of Lewis Morris, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> It contains many severe reflexions upon the tyranny of sir Edmond Andross.</NOTE>, as well as acceptable to the
<PB N="59" REF="024800_0055_0FCD62CD521AD788"/>people; for they sent him, soon after, an address, expres∣sing the highest sense of gratitude, for so beneficial a change in the government. It would have been impossible for him much longer to have maintained the old model over free subjects, who had just before formed themselves into a co∣lony for the enjoyment of their liberties, and had even al∣ready solicited the protection of the colony of Connecticut, from whence the greatest part of them came. Disputes, re∣lating to the limits of certain townships at the east end of Long Island, sowed the seeds of enmity against Dongan, so deeply in the hearts of many who were concerned in them, that their representation to Connecticut, at the revolution, contains the bitterest invectives against him.</P>
<P>Dongan surpassed all his predecessors, in a due attention to our affairs with the Indians, by whom he was highly esteemed. It must be remembered to his honour, that though he was ordered by the duke, to encourage the French priests, who were come to reside among the natives, under pretence of advancing the popish cause, but in reality to gain them over to the French interest; yet he forbid the five nations to entertain them. The jesuits, however, had no small success. Their proselytes are called praying Indi∣ans, or Caghnuagaes, and reside now in Canada, at the fall of St. Lewis, opposite to Montreal. This village was begun in 1671, and consists of such of the five nations, as have formerly been drawn away by the intrigues of the French priests, in the times of Lovelace and Andross, who seem to have paid no attention to our Indian affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of late, some others of the confederates have been al∣lured to settle at Oswegatchi, called by the French, la Gal∣lette, near 50 miles below Frontenac. General Shirley's emissaries from Oswego, in 1755, prevailed with several of these families to return to their old habitations.</NOTE>. It was owing to the instigation also of these priests, that the five nations about this time, committed hostilities on the back parts of Maryland and Virginia, which occasioned a grand conven∣tion at Albany, in the year 1684. Lord Howard of Effing∣ham, the governor of Virginia, was present, and made a covenant with them for preventing further depredations, towards the accomplishment of which, col. Dongan was ve∣ry
<PB N="60" REF="024800_0056_0FCD62CEF998A100"/>instrumental<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This covenant was ratified in 1685, and at several times since.</NOTE>. Doctor Colden has published this treaty at large: but as it has no immediate connexion with the affairs of this province, I beg leave to refer the reader for a full account of it, to his history of the five nations.</P>
<P>While lord Howard was at Albany, a messenger from de la Barre, then governor of Canada, arrived there, complain∣ing of the Seneca Indians, for interrupting the French in their trade with the more distant Indians, commonly in∣cluded among us by the general name of the far nations<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">By the far nations are meant, all those numerous tribes inhabiting the countries on both sides of the lakes Huron and Erie, westward as far as the Mississippi, and the south∣ern country along the banks of the Ohio, and its branches.</NOTE>. Colonel Dongan, to whom the message was sent, communi∣cated it to the Senecas, who admitted the charge, but justi∣fied their conduct, alleging, that the French supplied arms and ammunition to the Twightwies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the French called Miamies.</NOTE>, with whom they were then at war. De la Barre, at the same time, medita∣ting nothing less than the total destruction of the five na∣tions, proceeded with an army of 1700 men to the lake Ontario. Mighty preparations were made to obtain the de∣sired success: fresh troops were imported from France, and a letter procured from the duke of York to col. Dongan, commanding him to lay no obstacles in the way. The offi∣cers posted in the out forts, even as far as Messisimakinac, were ordered to rendezvous at Niagara, with all the wes∣tern Indians they could engage. Dongan, regardless of the duke's orders, apprised the Indians of the French designs, and promised to assist them. After six weeks delay at fort Frontenac, during which time a great sickness, occasioned by bad provisions, broke out in the French army, de la Barre found it necessary to conclude the campaign with a treaty, for which purpose he crossed the lake, and came to the place, which, from the distress of his army, was called la Famine. Dongan sent an interpreter among the Indians, by all means to prevent them from attending the treaty. The Mohawks and Senecas accordingly refused to meet de la Barre: but the Oneydoes, Onondagas, and Cayugas, influenced by the missionaries, were unwilling to hear the interpreter, except before the priests, one la Main, and three other Frenchmen, and afterwards waited upon the
<PB N="61" REF="024800_0057_0FCD62D0763FE4C8"/>French governor. Two days after their arrival in the camp, monsieur de la Barre addressing himself to Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngula, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Onondaga chief, made the following speech, the Indians and French officers at the same time forming a circle round about him.</P>
<P>"The king, my master, being informed, that the five na∣tions have often infringed the peace, has ordered me to come hither with a guard, and to send Ohguesse to the Onondagas, to bring the chief sachems to my camp. The intention of the great king is, that you and I may smoke the calumet of peace together; but on this condition, that you promise me, in the name of the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Mohawks, to give entire satisfaction and reparation to his subjects, and for the future, never to mo∣lest them.</P>
<P>"The Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, have robbed and abused all the traders that were passing to the Illinois and Miamies, and other Indian nati∣ons, the children of my king. They have acted, on these occasions, contrary to the treaty of peace with my prede∣cessor. I am ordered, therefore, to demand satisfaction, and to tell them, that in case of refusal, or their plundering us any more, I have express orders to declare war. This belt confirms my words. The warriors of the five nations have conducted the English into the lakes, which belong to the king, my master, and brought the English among the nati∣ons that are his children, to destroy the trade of his sub∣jects, and to withdraw these nations from him. They have carried the English thither, notwithstanding the prohibi∣tion of the late governor of New York, who foresaw the risque that both they and you would run. I am willing to forget those things, but if ever the like shall happen for the future, I have express orders to declare war against you. This belt confirms my words. Your warriors have made se∣veral barbarous incursions on the Illinois and Umameis; they have massacred men, women, and children, and have made many of these nations prisoners, who thought them∣selves safe in their villages in time of peace: these people, who are my king's children, must not be your slaves; you must give them their liberty, and send them back into their own country. If the five nations shall refuse to do this, I have express orders to declare war against them. This belt confirms my words.</P>
<P>"This is what I have to say to Garrangula, that he may carry to the Senecas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, Cayugas, and Mohawks, the declaration which the king, my master, has
<PB N="62" REF="024800_0058_0FCD62D1CDDDD9B8"/>commanded me to make. He doth not wish them to force him to fend a great army to Cadarackui fort, to begin a war, which must be fatal to them. He would be sorry that this fort, that was the work of peace, should become the prison of your warriors. We must endeavour, on both sides, to prevent such misfortunes. The French, who are the brethren and friends of the five nations, will never trouble their repose, provided that the satisfaction which I demand, be given, and that the treaties of peace be here∣after observed. I shall be extremely grieved, if my words do not produce the effect, which I expect from them; for then I shall be obliged to join with the governor of New-York, who is commanded by his master, to assist me, and burn the castles of the five nations, and destroy you. This belt confirms my words."</P>
<P>Garrangula heard these threats with contempt; because he had learnt the distressed sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the French army, and knew that they were incapable of executing the designs with which they set out: and therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, after walking five or six times round the circle, he answered the French go∣vernor, who sat in an elbow chair, in the following strain:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>YONNONDIO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I honour you, and the warriors that are with me like∣wise honour you. Your interpreter has finished your speech; I now begin mine. My words make haste to reach your ears; hearken to them.</P>
<P>Yonnondio, you must have believed, when you left Quebec, that the sun had burnt up all the forests, which render our country inaccessible to the French, or that the lakes had so far overflown the banks, that they had surround∣ed our castles, and that it was impossible for us to get out of them. Yes, Yonnondio, surely you must have dreamt so; and the curiosity of seeing so great a wonder, has brought you so far. Now you are undeceived, since that I and the warriors here present, are come to assure you, that the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, are yet alive. I thank you, in their name, for bringing back into their country the calumet, which your predecessor re∣ceived from their hands. It was happy for you, that you left under ground that murdering hatchet, that has been so often died in the blood of the French. Hear, Yonnondio, I do not sleep; I have my eyes open; and the sun, which enlightens me, discovers to me a great captain at the head of a company of soldiers, who speaks as if he were dream∣ing. He says, that he only came to the lake to smoke on the great calumet with the Onondagas. But Garrangula
<PB N="63" REF="024800_0059_0FCD62D5EDCA59E0"/>says, that he sees the contrary, that it was to knock them on the head, if sickness had not weakened the arms of the French.</P>
<P>I see Yonnondio raving in a camp of sick men, whose lives the great spirit has sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, by inflicting this sickness on them. Hear, Yonnondio, our women had taken their clubs, our children and old men had carried their bows and ar∣rows into the heart of your camp, if our warriors had not disarmed them, and kept them back, when your messenger, Ohguesse, came to our castles. It is done, and I have said it. Hear, Yonnondio, we plundered none of the French, but those that carried guns, powder, and ball to the Twight∣wies and Chictaghics, because those arms might have cost us our lives. Herein we follow the example of the jesuits, who stave all the kegs of rum brought to our castles, lest the drunken Indians should knock them on the head. Our war∣riors have not bever enough to pay for all these arms, that they have taken, and our old men are not afraid of the war. This belt preserves my words.</P>
<P>We carried the English into our lakes, to trade there with the Utawawas and Quatoghies, as the Adirondacks brought the French to our castles, to carry on a trade, which the English say is theirs. We are born free; we neither de∣pend on Yonnondio or Corlear.</P>
<P>We may go where we please, and carry with us whom we please, and buy and sell what we please: if your allies be your slaves, use them as such; command them to receive no other but your people. This belt preserves my words.</P>
<P>We knocked the Twightwies and Chictaghics on the head, because they had cut down the trees of peace, which were the limits of our country. They have hunted bevers on our lands: they have acted contrary to the customs of all Indians; for they left none of the bevers alive, they kil∣led both male and female. They brought the Satanas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the French called Sauounons.</NOTE> into the country, to take part with them, after they had con∣certed ill designs against us. We have done less than either the English or French, that have usurped the lands of so many Indian nations, and chased them from their own coun∣try. This belt preserves my words.</P>
<P>Hear, Yonnondio; what I say, is the voice of all the five nations; hear what they answer; open your ears to what they speak. The Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks say, that when they buried the
<PB N="64" REF="024800_0060_0FCD62D716098290"/>hatchet at Cadarackui (in the presence of your predecessor) in the middle of the fort; they planted the tree of peace in the same place, to be there carefully preserved, that, in place of a retreat for soldiers, that fort might be a rendez∣vous for merchants: that in place of arms and ammunition of war, bevers and merchandise should only enter there.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Yonnondio, take care for the future, that so great a number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as appear there do not choke the tree of peace planted in so small a fort. It will be a great loss, if, after it had so easily taken root, you should stop its growth, and prevent its covering your country and ours with its branches. I assure you, in the name of the five na∣tions, that our warriors shall dance to the calumet of peace under its leaves, and shall remain quiet on their mats, and shall never dig up the hatchet, till their brother Yonnondio or Corlear shall either jointly or separately endeavour to attack the country, which the great spirit has given to our ancestors. This belt preserves my words, and this other, the authority which the five nations have given me.</P>

<P>Then Garrangula, addressing himself to monsieur la Main, said, "Take courage, Ohguesse, you have spirit, speak, explain my words, forget nothing, tell all that your brethren and friends say to Yonnondio, your governor, by the mouth of Garrangula, who loves you, and desires you to accept of this present of bever, and take part with me in my feast, to which I invite you. This present of bever is sent to Yonnondio, on the part of the five nations."</P>
<P>Enraged at this bold reply, de la Barre, as soon as the peace was concluded, retired to Montreal, and ingloriously finished an expensive campaign, as dr. Colden observes, in a scold with an old Indian.</P>
<P>De la Barre was succeeded by the marquis de Nonville, colonel of the dragoons, who arrived with a reinforcement of troops in 1685. The marquis was a man of courage and an enterprising spirit, and not a little animated by the con∣sideration, that he was sent over to repair the disgrace, which his predecessor had brought upon the French colony. The year after his arrival at Quebec, he wrote a letter to the minister in France, recommending the scheme of erect∣ing a stone fort, sufficient to contain four or five hundred men, at Niagara, not only to exclude the English from the lakes, but to command the fur trade and subdue the five na∣tions. Dongan, who was jealous of his designs, took um∣brage at the extraordinary supplies sent to fort Frontenac, and wrote to the French governors, signifying, that if he at∣tacked the confederates, he would consider it, as a breach
<PB N="65" REF="024800_0061_0FCD62D88D8AEF28"/>of the peace subsisting between the two crowns; and to prevent his building a fort at Niagara, he protested against it, and claimed the country as dependent upon the province. De Nonville, in his answer, denied that he intended to in∣vade the Five Nations, tho' the necessary preparations for that purpose were then carrying on; and yet Charlevoix commends him for his piety and uprightness, "<HI>egalement estimable</HI> (says the jesuit) <HI>pour sa valour, sa droiture, &amp; so pieté.</HI>" Colonel Dongan, who knew the importance of our Indian alliance, placed no confidence in the declarations of the marquis, but exerted himself in preparing the confede∣rates for a war; and the French author, just mentioned, does him honour, while he complains of him as a perpetual obstacle, in the way of the execution of their schemes. Our allies were now triumphing in their success over the Chic∣taghics, and meditating a war with the Twightwies, who had disturbed them in their bever-hunting. De Nonville, to pre∣vent the interruption of the French trade with the Twight∣wies, determined to divert the Five Nations, and carry the war into their country. To that end, in 1687, he collected 2000 troops and 600 Indians at Montreal, and issued orders to all the officers in the more westerly country, to meet him with additional succours at Niagara, on an expedition against the Senecas. An English party, under one M'Gregory, at the same time was gone out to trade on the lakes, but the French, notwithstanding the peace then subsisting between the two crowns, intercepted them, seized their effects, and imprisoned their persons. Monsieur Fonti, commandant a∣mong the Chictaghics, who was coming to the general's ren∣dezvous at Niagara, did the like to another English party, which he met with in lake Erie.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Both these attacks were open infractions of the treaty at Whitehall, executed in Nov. 1686; by which it was a∣greed, that the Indian trade in America, should be free to the English and French.</NOTE> The Five Nations, in the mean time, were preparing to give the French army a suitable reception. Monsieur Companie, with two or three hundred Canadians, in an advanced party, surprised two villages of the confederates, who, at the invitation and on the faith of the French, seated themselves down about eight leagues from lake Fadarackui, or Ontario. To prevent their escape with intelligence to their countrymen, they were carried to the fort, and all but thirteen died in torments at the stake, sing∣ing with an heroic spirit, in their expiring moments, the perfidy of the French. The rest, according to the express
<PB N="66" REF="024800_0062_0FCD62DA292CBDB0"/>orders of the French king, were sent to the galleys in Eu∣rope. The marquis, having embarked his whole army in canoes, set out from the fort at Cadarackui, on the 23d of June, one half of them passing along the north and the other on the south side of the lake; and both arrived the same day at Tyrondequait, and shortly after set out on their march towards the chief village of the Senecas, at about seven leagues distance. The main body was composed of the regulars and militia, the front and rear of the Indians and traders. The scouts advanced the second day of their march, as far as the corn of the village, and within pistol-shot of too Senecas, who lay upon their bellies undiscovered. The French, who imagined the enemy were all fled, quickened their march to overtake the women and old men. But no sooner had they reached the foot of a hill, about a mile from the village, than the Senecas raised the war shout, and in the same instant charged upon the whole army both in the front and rear. Universal confusion ensued. The battalions divided, fired upon each other, and flew into the wood. The Senecas improved the disorder of the enemy, till they were repulsed by the French Indians. According to Charlevoix's account, which may be justly suspected, the enemy lost but six men, and had twenty wounded in the conflict. Of the Senecas, he says, sixty were wounded and forty five slain. The marquis was so much dispirited, that he could not be persuaded to pursue the enemy that day; which gave the Senecas an opportunity to burn their village, and get off. Two old men remained in the castle to receive the general, and regale the barbarity of his Indian allies. After destroying the corn in this and several other villages, the army retired to the banks of the lake, and erected a fort with four bas∣tions, on the south-east side of the streights at Niagara, in which they left 100 men, under the command of Le Cheva∣lier de la Troye, with eight months provisions; but these being closely blocked up, all, except seven or eight of them, who were accidentally relieved, perished thro' famine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more perfidious and unjust, than this attack upon our confederates. The two crowns had but just concluded a treaty for the preservation of the peace: La Hontan, one of the French historians, censures De Nonville's conduct, and admits the British title to the command of the lakes, but Charlevoix blames him, as he does Hennepin, De L'Isle and every other author, who confesses the truth, to the prejudice of the ambitious claims of the court of Frauce.</NOTE> Soon after this expedition, colonel Dongan met the Five Nations
<PB N="67" REF="024800_0063_0FCD62DB8E13D608"/>at Albany. To what intent, appears from the speech he made to them on the 5th of August, which I choose to lay before the reader, to show his vigilance and zeal for the in∣terest of his master, and the common weal of the province committed to his care.</P>

I therefore would willingly know, whether the brethren have given the governor of Canada any provocation or not; and if they have, how, and in what manner; because, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obliged to give a true account of this matter. This business <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cause a war between the king of England and the French king, both in Europe and here, and therefore I must know the truth.</P>
<P>I know the governor of Canada dare not enter into the king of England's territories, in a hostile manner, without provocation, if he thought the brethren were the king of England's subjects; but you have, two or three years ago, made a covenant-chain with the French, con∣trary to my command (which I knew could not hold long) being void of itself among the christians; forasmuch as subjects (as you are) ought not to treat with any foreign nation, it not lying in your power. You have brought this trouble upon yourselves; and, as I believe, this is the only reason of their falling on you at this time.</P>
<P>Brethren, I took it very ill, that after you had put yourselves into the number of the great king of England's subjects, you should ever offer to make peace or war, without my consent. You know that we can live without you; but you cannot live without us; you never found that I told you a lie, and I offered you the assistance you wanted, provided that you would be advised by me; for I know the French better than any of you do.</P>
<P>Now since there is a war begun upon you by the gover∣nor of Canada; I hope without any provocation by you
<PB N="68" REF="024800_0064_0FCD62E14789DEE0"/>given, I desire and command you, that you hearken to no treaty but by my advice; which if you follow, you shall have the benefit of the great chain of friendship between the great king of England and the king of France, which came out of England the other day, and which I have sent to Canada by Anthony le Junard; in the mean time, I will give you such advice as will be for your good; and will supply you with such necessaries as you will have need of.</P>
<P N="1">1st, My advice is, as to what prisoners of the French you shall take, that you draw not their blood, but bring them home, and keep them to exchange for your people, which they have prisoners already, or may take hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That if it be possible, that you can order it so, I would have you take one or two of your wisest sachems, and one or two of your chief captains, of each nation, to be a council to manage all affairs of the war. They, to give or∣ders to the rest of the officers what they are to do, that your designs may be kept private; for after it comes among so many people, it is blazed abroad, and your designs are often frustrated; and those chief men should keep a correspon∣dence with me by a trusty messenger.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The great matter under consideration with the brethren is, how to strengthen themselves, and weaken their enemy. My opinion is, that the brethren should send messen∣gers to the Utawawas, Twightwies, and the farther Indians, and to send back likewise some of the prisoners of these na∣tions, if you have any left, to bury the hatchet, and to make a covenant-chain, that they may put away all the French that are among them, and that you will open a path for them this way (they being the king of England's subjects likewise, though the French have been admitted to trade with them; for all that the French have in Canada, they had it of the great king of England) that, by that means, they may come hither freely, where they may have every thing cheaper than among the French: that you and they may join together against the French, and make so firm a league, that whoever is an enemy to one, must be to both.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Another thing of concern is, that you ought to do what you can, to open a path for all the north Indians and Mahikanders that are among the Utawawas and further nations. I will endeavour to do the same to bring them home. For, they not daring to return home your way, the French keep them there on purpose to join with the other nations against you, for your destruction; for you know, that one of them is worse than six of the others; therefore all means must be used to bring them home, and use them kindly as they pass through your country.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="69" REF="024800_0065_0FCD62E278C38268"/>
5thly, My advice further is, that messengers go, in be∣half of all the Five Nations, to the christian Indians at Ca∣nada, to persuade them to come home to their native coun∣try. This will be another great means to weaken your ene∣my; but if they will not be advised, you know what to do with them.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, I think it very necessary, for the brethren's secu∣rity and assistance, and to the endamaging the French, to build a fort upon the lake, where I may keep stores and pro∣visions, in case of necessity; and therefore I would have the brethren let me know what place will be most convenient for it.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, I would not have the brethren keep their corn in their castles, as I hear the Onondagas do, but bury it a great way in the woods, where few people may know where it is, for fear of such an accident as has happened to the Senecas.</P>
<P N="8">8thly, I have given my advice in your general assembly, by mr. Dirk Wessels and Akus, the interpreter, how you are to manage your parties, and how necessary it is to get prisoners to exchange for your own men that are prisoners with the French; and I am glad to hear that the brethren are so united as mr. Dirk Wessels tells me you are, and that there was no rotten members nor French spies among you.</P>
<P N="9">9thly, The brethren may remember my advice, which I sent you this spring, not to go to Cadarackui; if you had, they would have served you, as they did your people that came from hunting thither, for I told you that I knew the French better than you did.</P>
<P N="10">10thly, There was no advice or proposition that I made to the brethren all the time that the priest lived at Ononda∣ga, but what he wrote to Canada, as I found by one of his letters, which he gave to an Indian to carry to Canada, but which was brought hither; therefore, I desire the brethren not to receive him, or any French priest any more, having sent for English priests, with whom you may be supplied to your content.</P>
<P N="11">11thly, I would have the brethren look out sharp, for fear of being surprised. I believe all the strength of the French will be at their frontier places, viz. at Cadarackui, and Oniagara, where they have built a fort now, and at Trois Rivieres, Montreal, and Chambly.</P>
<P N="12">12thly, Let me put you in mind again, not to make any treaties without my means, which will be more advantage∣ous for you, than your doing it for yourselves; for then you will be looked upon as the king of England's subjects; and let me know, from time to time, every thing that is done.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="024800_0066_0FCD62E3F3ABF378"/>
Thus far I have spoken to you relating to the war.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Not long after this interview, a considerable party of Mo∣haws and Mahikanders, or river Indians, beset fort Chambly, burnt several houses, and returned with many captives to Albany. Forty Onondagas, about the same time, surprised a few soldiers near fort Frontenac, whom they confined in∣stead of the Indians sent home to the gallies, notwithstand∣ing the utmost address was used to regain them, by Lamber∣ville, a French priest, who delivered them two belts, to en∣gage their kindness to the prisoners, and prevent their join∣ing the quarrel with the Senecas. The belts being sent to colonel Dongan, he wrote to De Nonville, to demand the reason of their being delivered. Pere le Vaillant was sent here about the beginning of the year 1688, under colour of bringing an answer, but in reality as a spy Col. Dongan told him, that no peace could be made with the five nations, unless the Indians sent to the gallies, and the Caghnuaga proselytes were returned to their respective cantons, the forts at Niagara and Frontenac raised, and the Senecas had satisfaction made them, for the damage they had sustained. The jesuit, in his return, was ordered not to visit the Mo∣hawks.</P>
<P>Dongan, who was fully sensible of the importance of the Indian interest to the English colonies, was for compelling the French to apply to him in all their affairs with the Five Nations; while they, on the other hand, were for treating with them independent of the English. For this reason, a∣mong others, he refused them the assistance they frequent∣ly required, till they acknowledged the dependence of the confederates on the English crown. King James, a poor, bigotted, popish, priest-ridden prince, ordered his governor to give up this point, and to persuade the Five Nations to send messengers to Canada, to receive proposals of peace from the French. For this purpose, a cessation of arms and mutual delivery of prisoners was agreed upon. Near 1200 of the confederates attended this negociation at Mon∣treal, and in their speech to De Nonville, insisted with great resolution, upon the terms proposed by colonel Dongan to father le Vaillant. The French governor declared his wil∣lingness to put an end to the war, if all his allies might be included in the treaty of peace, if the Mohawks and Sene∣cas would send deputies to signify their concurrence, and the French might supply fort Frontenac with provisions. The confederates, according to the French accounts, acced∣ed to these conditions, and the treaty was ratified in the field. But a new rupture not long after ensued, from a cause en∣tirely unsuspected. The Dinondadies had lately inclined to
<PB N="71" REF="024800_0067_0FCD62E552782258"/>the English trade at Missilimakinac; and their alliance was therefore become suspected by the French. Adario, their chief, thought to regain the ancient confidence, which had been reposed in his countrymen, by a notable action against the Five Nations; and for that purpose put himself at the head of 100 men: nothing was more disagreeable to him, than the prospect of peace between the French and the confederates; for that event would not only render the a∣mity of the Dinondadies useless, but give the French an op∣portunity of resenting their late favourable conduct towards the English. Impressed with these sentiments, out of affec∣tion to his country, he intercepted the ambassadors of the Five Nations, at one of the falls in Cadarackui river, killed some, and took others prisoners, telling them that the French governor had informed him, that fifty warriors of the Five Nations were coming that way. As the Dinonda∣dies and confederates were then at war, the ambassadors were astonished at the perfidy of the French governor, and could not help communicating the design of their journey, Adario, in prosecution of his crafty scheme, counterfeited the utmost distress, anger, and shame, on being made the ig∣nominious tool of de Nonville's treachery, and addressing himself to Dekanesora, the principal ambassador, said to him, "Go, my brethren, I untie your bonds, and send you home again, though our nations be at war. The French go∣vernor has made me commit so black an action, that I shall never be easy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ter it, till the Five Nations shall have taken full revenge." This outrage and indignity upon the rights of ambassadors, the truth of which they did not in the least doubt, animated the confederates, to the keenest thirst af∣ter revenge; and accordingly 1200 of their men, on the 26th of July 1688, landed on the south side of the island of Mon∣treal, while the French were in perfect security; burnt their houses, sacked their plantations, and put to the sword all the men, women, and children, without the skirts of the town. A thousand French were slain in this invasion, and twenty six carried into captivity, and burnt alive. Many more were made prisoners in another attack in October, and the lower part of the island wholly destroyed. Only three of the confederates were lost, in all this scene of mi∣sery and desolation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have followed dr. Colden in the account of this at∣tack, who differs from Charlevoix. That jesuit tells us, that the invasion was late in August, and the Indians 1500 strong; and as to the loss of the French, he diminishes it to only 200 souls.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="024800_0068_0FCD62E6F4E5FE00"/>
Never before did Canada sustain such a heavy blow. The news of this attack on Montreal no sooner reached the gar∣rison at the lake Ontario, than they set fire to the two barks, which they had built there, and abandoned the fort, leaving a match to 28 barrels of powder, designed to blow up the works. The soldiers went down the river in such precipi∣tation, that one of the battoes and her crew were all lost in shooting a fall. The confederates in the mean time seized the fort, the powder, and the stores; and of all the French allies, who were vastly numerous, only the Nepicirinians and Kikabous adhered to them in their calamities. The Utawawas and seven other nations instantly made peace with the English; and but for the uncommon sagacity and address of the sieur Perot, the western Indians would have murdered every Frenchman among them. Nor did the dis∣tresses of the Canadians end here. Numerous scouts from the five nations, continually infested their borders. The fre∣quent depredations that were made, prevented them from the cultivation of their fields, and a distressing famine raged through the whole country. Nothing but the ignorance of the Indians, in the art of attacking fortified places, saved Canada from being now utterly cut off. It was therefore unspeakably fortunate to the French, that the Indians had no assistance from the English, and as unfortunate to us, that our colonies were then incapable of affording succours to the confederates, through the malignant influence of those execrable measures, which were pursued under the infa∣mous reign of king James the second. Colonel Dongan, whatever his conduct might have been in civil affairs, did all that he could in those relating to the Indians, and fell at last into the king's displeasure, through his zeal for the true interest of the province.</P>
<P>While these things were transacting in Canada, a scene of the greatest importance was opening at New-York. A general disaffection to the government prevailed among the people. Papists began to settle in the colony, under the smiles of the governor. The collector of the revenues, and several principal officers, threw off the mask, and openly avowed their attachment to the doctrines of Rome. A Latin school was set up, and the teacher strongly suspected for a jesuit. The people of Long-Island, who were disappointed in their expectation of mighty boons, promised by the go∣vernor on his arrival, were become his personal enemies; and in a word, the whole body of the people trembled for the protestant cause. Here the leaven of opposition first be∣gan to work. Their intelligence from England, of the de∣signs there in favour of the prince of Orange, blew up the
<PB N="73" REF="024800_0069_0FCD62E932BA4078"/>coals of discontent, and elevated the hopes of the disaffected. But no man dared to spring in action, till after the rupture in Boston. Sir Edmond Andross, who was perfectly devoted to the arbitrary measures of king James, by his tyranny in New-England, had drawn upon himself the universal odium of a people, animated with the love of liberty and in the defence of it resolute and courageous; and therefore, when they could no longer endure his despotic rule, they seized and imprisoned him, and afterwards sent him to England. The government, in the mean time, was vested in the hands of a committee for the safety of the people, of which mr. Bradstreet was chosen president. Upon the news of this event, several captains of our militia convened themselves to concert measures, in favour of the prince of Orange. A∣mong these, Jacob Leisler was the most active. He was a man in tolerable esteem among the people, and of a mo∣derate fortune, but destitute of every qualification necessary for the enterprise. Milborne, his son-in-law, and Englishman, directed all his councils, while Leisler as absolutely influ∣enced the other officers.</P>
<P>The first thing they contrived, was to seize the garrison in New-York; and the custom, at that time, of guarding it every night by the militia, gave Leisler a fine opportunity of executing the design. He entered it with forty nine men, and determined to hold it till the whole militia should join him. Colonel Dongan, who was about to leave the province, then lay embarked in the bay, having a little before resigned the government to Francis Nicholson, the lieutenant gover∣nor. The council, civil officers, and migistrates of the city, were against Leisler, and therefore many of his friends were at first fearful of openly espousing a cause disapproved by the gentlemen of figure. For this reason, Leisler's first de∣claration in favour of the prince of Orange, was subscribed only by a few, among several companies of the trained bands. While the people, for four days successively, were in the utmost perplexity to determine what part to choose, being solicited by Leisler on the one hand, and threatened by the lieutenant governor on the other, the town was alarmed with a report, that three ships were coming up, with or∣ders from the prince of Orange. This falsehood was very seasonably propagated to serve the interest of Leisler; for on that day, the 3d of June 1689, his party was augmented by the addition of six captains and 400 men in New-York, and a company of 70 men from East Chester, who all subscribed a
<PB N="74" REF="024800_0070_0FCD62EC4C2EE580"/>second declaration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have taken an exact copy of it for the satisfaction of the reader. "Whereas our intention tended only but to the preservation of the protestant religion, and the fort of this city, to the end that we may avoid and prevent the rash judgment of the world, in so just a design; we have thought fit, to let every body know by these public proclamation, that till the safe arryvell of the ships, that we expect every day, from his royal highness the prince of Orange, with orders for the government of this country in the behalf of such person, as the said royal highness had chosen, and honoured with the charge of a governor, that as soon as the bearer of the said orders, shall have let us see his power, then, and without any delay, we shall execute the said or∣ders punctually; declaring that we do intend to submit and obey, not only the said orders, but also the bearer thereof, committed for the execution of the same. In witness hereof, we have signed these presents, the third of June 1689."</NOTE>, mutually covenanting to hold the fort for the prince. Colonel Dongan continued till this time in the harbour, waiting the issue of these commotions; and Nicholson's party being now unable to contend with their opponents were totally dispersed, the lieutenant governor himself absconding, the very night after the last declaration was signed.</P>
<P>Leisler being now in complete possession of the fort, sent home an address to king William and queen Mary, as soon as he received the news of their accession to the throne. It is a tedious, incorrect, ill-drawn narrative of the grievances which the people had endured, and the methods lately ta∣ken to secure themselves, ending with a recognition of the sovereignty of the king and queen over the whole English dominions.</P>
<P>This address was soon followed by a private letter from Leisler to king William, which, in very broken English, in∣forms his majesty of the state of the garrison, the repairs he had made to it, and the temper of the people, and con∣cludes with strong protestations of his sincerity, loyalty, and zeal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost Stoll, an ensign, on the delivery of this let∣ter to the king, had the honour to kiss his majesty's hand; but Nicholson the lieutenant-governor, and one Ennis, an episcopal clergyman, arrived in England before him; and by falsely representing the late measures in New-York, as proceeding rather from their aversion to the church of Eng∣land, than zeal for the prince of Orange, Leisler and his party missed the rewards and notice, which their activity
<PB N="75" REF="024800_0071_0FCD62EDBA095878"/>for the revolution justly deserved. For though the king made Stoll the bearer of his thanks to the people for their fidelity, he so little regarded Leisler's complaints against Ni∣cholson, that he was soon after preferred to the government of Virginia. Dongan returned to Ireland, and, it is said, succeeded to the earldom of Limerick.</P>
<P>Leisler's sudden investiture with supreme power over the province, and the probable prospects of king William's ap∣probation of his conduct, could not but excite the envy and jealousy of the late council and magistrates, who had refu∣sed to join in the glorious work of the revolution; and hence the spring of all their aversion, both to the man and his measures. Colonel Bayard, and Courtland the mayor of the city, were at the head of his opponents, and finding it impossible to raise a party against him in the city, they very early retired to Albany, and there endeavoured to foment the opposition. Leisler, on the other hand, fearful of their influence, and to extinguish the jealousy of the people, thought it prudent, to admit several trusty persons to a par∣ticipation of that power, which the militia on the 1st of July had committed solely to himself. In conjunction with these, (who, after the Boston example, were called the com∣mittee of safety) he exercised the government, assuming to himself only the honour of being president in their councils. This model continued till the month of Decem∣ber, when a packet arrived with a letter from the lords Carmarthen, Halifax, and others, directed "To Francis Nicholson, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> or in his absence, to such as for the time be∣ing, take care for preserving the peace and administering the laws, in their majesties' province of New-York in Ame∣rica." This letter was dated the 29th of July, and was ac∣companied with another from lord Nottingham, dated the next day, which, after empowering Nicholson to take upon him the chief command, and to appoint for his assistance as many of the principal freeholders and inhabitants as he should think fit, requiring also "to do every thing apper∣taining to the office of lieutenant-governor, according to the laws and customs of New-York, until further orders."</P>
<P>Nicholson being absconded when this packet came to hand, Leisler considered the letter as directed to himself, and from this time issued all kinds of commissions in his own name, assuming the title, as well as authority, of lieute∣nant-governor. On the 11th of December, he summoned the committee of safety, and agreeable to their advice, swore the following persons for his council: Peter de Lanoy, Samuel Staats, Hendrick Jansen, and Johannes Vermilie, for New-York. Gerardus Beekman, for King's county. For
<PB N="76" REF="024800_0072_0FCD62EF11D82D20"/>Queen's county, Samuel Edsel; Thomas Williams for West-Chester, and William Lawrence for Orange county.</P>
<P>Except the eastern inhabitants of Long Island, all the southern part of the colony chearfully submitted to Leis∣ler's command. The principal freeholders, however, by re∣spectful letters gave him hopes of their submission, and thereby prevented his betaking himself to arms, while they were privately soliciting the colony of Connecticut, to take them under its jurisdiction. They had, indeed, no aversion to Leisler's authority, in favour of any other party in the province, but were willing to be incorporated with a peo∣ple, from whence they had originally colonized; and therefore as soon as Connecticut declined their request, they openly appeared to be advocates for Leisler. At this junc∣ture the Long Island representation was drawn up, which I have more than once had occasion to mention.</P>
<P>The people of Albany, in the mean time, were determi∣ned to hold the garrison and city for king William, inde∣pendent of Leisler; and on the 26th of October, which was before the packet arrived from lord Nottingham, form∣ed themselves into a convention for that purpose. As Leis∣ler's attempt, to reduce this country to his command, was the original cause of the future divisions in the province, and in the end brought about his own ruin, it may not be improper to see the resolution of the convention, a copy of which was sent down to him at large.</P>

<P>Resolved, since we are informed by persons coming from New-York, that captain Jacob Leisler is designed to send up a company of armed men, upon pretence to assist us in this country, who intend to make themselves master of their majesties' fort and this city, and carry divers persons and chief officers of this city prisoners to New-York, and so disquiet and disturb their majesties liege people; that a letter be writ to alderman Levinus Van Schaic, now at New-York, and lieutenant Jochim Staets, to make narrow enquiry of the business, and to signifiy to the said Leisler, that we have received such information; and withal acquint him, that notwithstanding we have the assistance of ninety-five men

<P>Taking it for granted, that Leisler at New-York, and the convention at Albany, were equally affected to the revolu∣tion, nothing could be more egregiously foolish, than the conduct of both parties, who, by their intestine divisions, threw the province into convulsions, and sowed the seeds of mutual hatred and animosity, which, for a long time after, greatly embarrassed the public affairs of the colony. When Albany declared for the prince of Orange, there was no∣thing else that Leisler could properly require: and rather than sacrifice the public peace of the province, to the trifling honour of resisting a man who had no evil designs, Albany ought in prudence to have delivered the garrison into his hands, till the king's definitive orders should arrive. But while Leisler, on the one hand, was inebriated with his new-gotten power, so on the other, Bayard, Courtland, Schuyler, and others, could not brook a submission to the authority of a man, mean in his abilities, and inferior in his degree. Animated by these principles, both parties pre∣pared, the one to reduce, if I may use the expression, the other to retain, the garrison of Albany. Mr. Livingston, a principal agent for the convention, retired into Connecti∣cut, to solicit the aid of that colony, for the protection of the frontiers against the French. Leisler, suspecting that they were to be used against him, endeavoured not only to prevent these supplies, but wrote letters, to have Living∣ston
<PB N="78" REF="024800_0074_0FCD62F2CEFDD460"/>apprehended, as an enemy to the reigning powers, and, to procure succours from Boston, falsely represented the convention, as in the interest of the French and king James.</P>
<P>Jacob Milborne was commissioned for the reduction of Albany. Upon his arrival there, a great number of the in∣habitants armed themselves, and repaired to the fort, then commanded by mr. Schuyler, while many others followed the other members of the convention, to a conference with him at the city-hall. Milborne, to proselyte the crowd, de∣claimed much against king James, popery, and arbitrary power; but his oratory was lost upon the hearers, who, after several meetings, still adhered to the convention. Milborne then advanced with a few men up to the fort, and mr. Schuyler had the utmost difficulty to prevent both his own men, and the Mohawks, who were then in Albany, and perfectly devoted to his service, from firing upon Mil∣borne's party, which consisted of an inconsiderable num∣ber. In these circumstances, he thought proper to retreat, and soon after departed from Albany. In the spring, he commanded another party upon the same errand; and the distress of the country, on an Indian irruption, gave him all the desired success. No sooner was he possessed of the garrison, than most of the principal members of the conven∣tion absconded. Upon which, their effects were arbitrarily seized and confiscated, which so highly exasperated the suf∣ferers, that their posterity, to this day, cannot speak of these troubles, without the bitterest invectives against Leisler and all his adherents.</P>
<P>In the midst of those intestine confusions at New-York, the people of New-England were engaged in a war with the Owenagungas, Ourages, and Penocoks. Between these and the Schakook Indians, there was then a friendly communi∣cation, and the same was suspected of the Mohawks, among whom, some of the Owenagungas had taken sanctuary. This gave rise to a conference, between several commission∣ers from Boston, Plymouth, and Connecticut, and the five nations, at Albany, in September 1689, the former endea∣vouring to engage the latter, against those eastern Indians, who were then at war with the New-England colonies. Tabajadoris, a Mohawk sachem, in a long oration, an∣swered the English message; and, however improbable it may seem to Europeans, repeated all that had been said the preceding day. The art they have in assisting their memo∣ries is this. The sachem who presides, has a bundle of sticks prepared for the purpose, and at the close of every principal article of the message delivered to them, gives a
<PB N="79" REF="024800_0075_0FCD62F8B873FEF0"/>stick to another sachem, charging him with the remem∣brance of it. By this means the orator, after a previous conference with the Indians, is prepared to repeat every part of the message, and give it its proper reply. This cus∣tom is invariably pursued in all their public treaties.</P>
<P>The conference did not answer the expectation of the people of New-England, the five nations discovering a great disinclination to join in the hostilities against the eastern Indians. To atone for which, they gave the highest pro∣testations of their willingness to distress the French, against whom the English had declared war, on the 7th of May preceding. That part of the speech ratifying their friend∣ship, with the English colonies, is singularly expressed. "We promise to preserve the chain inviolably, and wish that the sun may always shine in peace, over all our heads that are comprehended in this chain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indians' conception of the league between them and us, is couched under the idea of a chain extended from a ship to a tree; and every renewal of this league they call brightening the chain.</NOTE>. We give two belts. One for the sun, and the other for its beams. We make fast the roots of the tree of peace and tranquillity which is plant∣ed in this place. Its roots extend as far as the utmost of your colonies; if the French should come to shake this tree, we would feel it by the motion of its roots, which extend into our country. But we trust it will not be in the gover∣nor of Canada's power to shake this tree, which has been so firmly, and long planted with us."</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more advantageous to these co∣lonies, and especially to New-York, than the late success of the five nations against Canada. The miseries to which the French were reduced, rendered us secure against their in∣roads, till the work of the revolution was in a great mea∣sure accomplished; and to their distressed condition, we must principally ascribe the defeat of the French design, about this time, to make a conquest of the province. De Callieres, who went to France in 1688, first projected the scheme<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix has published an extract of the memorial presented to the French king. The force demanded for this enterprise, was to consist of 1300 regulars and 300 Canadi∣ans. Albany was said to be fortified only by an inclosure of stockadoes and a little fort with four bastions; and that it contained by 150 soldiers and 300 inhabitants. That New-York, the capital of the province, was open, had a stone fort with four bastions, and about four hundred inha∣bitants, divided into eight companies.</NOTE>; and the troubles in England encouraged the
<PB N="80" REF="024800_0076_0FCD62F99C6057E0"/>French court to make the attempt. Caffiniere commanded the ships, which sailed for that purpose from Rochefort; sub∣ject, nevertheless, to the count de Frontenac, who was ge∣neral of the land forces, destined to march from Canada, by the route of Sorel-River and the lake Champlain. The fleet and troops arrived at Chebucta, the place of rendez∣vous, in September; from whence the count proceeded to Quebec, leaving orders with Caffiniere, to sail for New-York, and continue in the bay, in sight of the city, but be∣yond the fire of our cannon, till the 1st of December; when, if he received no intelligence from him, he was ordered to return to France, after unlading the ammunition, stores, and provisions at Port-Royal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Annapolis.</NOTE>. The count was in high spi∣rits, and fully determined upon the enterprise, till he ar∣rived at Quebec; where the news of the success of the five nations against Montreal, the loss of his favourite fort at lake Ontario, and the advanced season of the year, defeat∣ed his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, and broke up the expedition. De Nonville, who was recalled, carried the news of this disappointment to the court of France, leaving the chief command of the country in the hands of count Frontenac. This gentleman was a man of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge, and well acquainted with the affairs of that country. He was then in the 68th year of his age, and yet so far from consulting his ease, that in a few days af∣ter he landed at Quebec, he re-embarked in a canoe, for Mon∣treal, where his presence was absolutely necessary, to ani∣mate the inhabitants, and regain their Indian alliances. A war, between the English and French crowns, being broke out, the count betook himself to every art, for concluding a peace between Canada and the five nations; and for this purpose, the utmost civilities were shown to Taweraket and the other Indians, who had been sent to France by de Non∣ville, and were now returned. Three of those Indians, who, doubtless, were struck with the grandeur and glory of the French monarch, were properly sent on the im∣portant message of conciliating the friendship of the five na∣tions. These, agreeable to our alliance, sent two sachems to Albany, in December, with notice, that a council for that purpose was to be held at Onondaga. It is a just reflexion upon the people of Albany, that they regarded the treaty
<PB N="81" REF="024800_0077_0FCD62FB13D0C100"/>so slightly, as only to send four Indians and the interpreter with instructions, in their name, to dissuade the confederates from a cessation of arms; while the French, on the other hand, had then a jesuit among the Oneydoes. The coun∣cil began on the 22d of January, 1690, and consisted of eighty sachems. Sadekanaghtie, an Onondaga chief, open∣ed the conference. The whole was managed with great art and formality, and concluded in showing a disposition to make peace with the French, without perfecting it; guard∣ing, at the same time, against giving the least umbrage to the English.</P>
<P>Among other measures to detach the five nations from the British interest, and raise the depressed spirit of the Cana∣dians, the count de Frontenac thought proper to send out several parties against the English colonies. D'Aillebout, de Mantel, and le Moyne, commanded that against New-York, consisting of about two hundred French and some Caghnu∣aga Indians, who being proselytes from the Mohawks, were perfectly acquainted with that country. Their orders were, in general, to attack New-York; but pursuing the advice of the Indians, they resolved, instead of Albany, to surprise Schenectady, a village seventeen miles north-west from it, and about the same distance from the Mohawks. The peo∣ple of Schenectady, though they had been informed of the designs of the enemy; were in the greatest security; judg∣ing it impracticable, for any men to march several hundred miles, in the depth of winter, through the snow, bearing their provisions on their backs. Besides, the village was in as much confusion as the rest of the province; the officers, who were posted there, being unable to preserve a regular watch, or any kind of military order. Such was the state of Schenectady, as represented by colonel Schuyler, who was at that time mayor of the city of Albany, and at the head of the convention. A copy of his letter to the neigh∣bouring colonies, concerning this descent upon Schenectady dated the 15th of February 1689-90, I have now lying be∣fore me under his own hand.</P>
<P>After two and twenty days march, the enemy fell in with Schenectady, on the 8th of February; and were reduced to such streights, that they had thoughts of surrendering themselves prisoners of war. But their scouts, who were a day or two in the village entirely unsuspected, returned with such encouraging accounts of the absolute security of the people, that the enemy determined on the attack. They entered, on Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, at the gates, which were found unshut; and, that every house might be invested at the same time, divided into small par∣ties
<PB N="82" REF="024800_0078_0FCD57F5951FEDB0"/>of six, or seven men. The inhabitants were in a pro∣found sleep, and unalarmed, till their doors were broke open. Never were people in a more wretched consterna∣tion. Before they were risen from their beds, the enemy en∣tered their houses; and began the perpetration of the most inhuman barbarities. No tongue, says colonel Schuy∣ler, can express the cruelties that were committed. The whole village was instantly in a blaze. Women with child ripped open, and their infants cast into the flames, or dash∣ed against the posts of the doors. Sixty persons perished in the massacre, and twenty seven were carried into captivity. The rest fled naked towards Albany, through a deep snow which fell that very night in a terrible storm; and twenty-five of these fugitives lost their limbs in the flight, through the severity of the frost. The news of this dreadful tragedy reached Albany, about break of day; and universal dread seized the inhabitants of that city, the enemy being report∣ed to be one thousand four hundred strong. A party of horse was immediately dispatched to Schenectady, and a few Mohawks then in the town, fearful of being intercept∣ed, were with difficulty sent to apprise their own castles.</P>
<P>The Mohawks were unacquainted with this bloody scene, till two days after it happened; our messengers being scarce able to travel through the great depth of the snow. The ene∣my, in the mean time, pillaged the town of Schenectady till noon the next day; and then went off with their plunder, and about forty of their best horses. The rest, with all the cattle they could find, lay slaughtered in the streets.</P>
<P>The design of the French, in this attack, was to alarm the fears of our Indian allies, by showing that we were in∣capable of defending them. Every art also was used to con∣ciliate their friendship; for they not only spared those Mo∣hawks who were found in Schenectady, but several other particular persons in compliment to the Indians, who re∣quested that favour. Several women and children were also released at the desire of captain Glen, to whom the French offered no violence; the officer declaring he had strict or∣ders against it, on the score of his wife's civilities to cer∣tain French captives, in the time of colonel Dongan.</P>
<P>The Mohawks, considering the cajoling arts of the French, and that the Caghnuagas who were with them, were once a part of their own body, behaved as well as could be rea∣sonably expected. They joined a party of young men from Albany, fell upon the rear of the enemy, and either killed or captivated five and twenty. Several sachems, in the mean time, came to Albany, and very affectingly addressed the inhabitants, who were just ready to abandon the coun∣try;
<PB N="83" REF="024800_0079_0FCD62FFA2838688"/>urging their stay, and exciting a union of all the Eng∣lish colonies against Canada. Their sentiments concerning the French appear from the following speech of condo∣lence. "Brethren, we do not think, that what the French have done can be called a victory: it is only a farther proof of their cruel deceit: the governor of Canada sent to Onondaga, and talks to us of peace with our whole house; but war was in his heart, as you now see by woful experi∣ence. He did the same, formerly, at Cadaraqui, and in the Seneca's country. This is the third time he has acted so de∣ceitfully. He has broken open our house, at both ends; formerly in the Seneca's country, and now here. We hope however to be revenged of them."</P>
<P>Agreeable to this declaration, the Indians soon after treated the chevalier d'Eau and the rest of the French mes∣sengers, who came to conclude the peace proposed by Taweraket, with the utmost indignity; and afterwards delivered them up to the English. Besides this, their scouts harrassed the borders of the enemy, and sell upon a party of French and Indians, in the river, about one hundred and twenty miles above Montreal, under the command of Lou∣vigni, a captain who was going to Missilimakinac, to pre∣vent the conclusion of the peace, between the Utawawas and Quatoghies, with the five nations. The loss in this skirmish was nearly equal on both sides. One of our prison∣ers was delivered to the Utawawas, who ate him. In re∣venge for this barbarity, the Indians attacked the island of Montreal at Trembling Point, and killed an officer and twelve men; while another party carried off about fifteen prisoners taken at Riviere Puan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, whom they afterwards slew, through fear of their pursuers; and others burnt the French plantations at St. Aeurs. But what rendered this year most remarkable, was the expedition of sir William Phips against Quebec. He sailed up the river with a fleet of thirty-two sail, and came before the city in October. Had he improved his time and strength, the conquest would have been easy; but by spending three days in idle consultations, the French governor brought in his forces, and entertained such a mean opinion of the English knight, that he not only despised his summons to surrender, but sent a verbal answer, in which he called king William an usurper, and poured the utmost contempt upon his subjects. The mes∣senger, who carried the summons, insisted upon a written answer, and that within an hour; but the count de Frontenac absolutely refused it, adding, "I'll answer your master by the mouth of my cannon, that he may learn that a man of my condition is not to be summoned in this man∣ner."
<PB N="84" REF="024800_0080_0FCD63048CA01610"/>Upon this, sir William made two attempts to land below the town, but was repulsed by the enemy, with con∣siderable loss of men, cannon and baggage. Several of the ships also cannonaded the city, but without any success. The forts at the same time returned the fire and obliged them to retire in disorder. The French writers, in their accounts of this expedition, universally censure the conduct of sir William, though they confess the valour of his troops. La Hontan, who was then at Quebec, says, he could not have acted in a manner more agreeable to the French, if he had been in their interest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Colden supposes this attack was made upon Que∣bec, in 1691, but he is certainly mistaken; see life of sir William Phips, published at London in 1697,—Oldmixon's Brit. Empire,—and Charlevoix.
<P>Among the causes of the ill success of the fleet, the author of the life of sir William Phips, mentions the neglect of the conjoined troops of New-York, Connecticut, and the Indians, to attack Montreal, according to the original plan of operations. He tells us, that they marched to the lake, but there found themselves unprovided with batteaux, and that the Indians were dissuaded from the attempt. By what authority these assertions may be supported, I know not. Charlevoix says, our army was disappointed in the intended diversion, by the small-pox, which seized the camp, killed three hundred men, and terrified our Indian allies.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NEW-YORK. <HI>PART III.</HI> From the revolution to the second expedition against Canada.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE our allies were faithfully exerting themselves against the common enemy, colonel Henry Slough∣ter, who had a commission to be governor of this province, dated 4th of January, 1689, arrived here, and published it on the 19th of March, 1691. Never was a governor more necessary to the province, than at this critical conjuncture; as well for reconciling a divided people, as for defending them against the wiles of a cunning adversary. But, either through the hurry of the king's affairs, or the powerful in∣terest of a favourite, a man was sent over, utterly destitute of every qualification for government, licentious in his mo∣rals, avaricious, and poor. The council present at his arri∣val were

<P>If Leisler had delivered the garrison to colonel Slough∣ter, as he ought to have done, upon his first landing, be∣sides extinguishing, in a great degree, the animosities then subsisting, he would, doubtless, have attracted the favoura∣ble notice, both of the governor and the crown. But being a weak man, he was so intoxicated with the love of power, that, though he had been well informed of Sloughter's ap∣pointment to the government, he not only shut himself up
<PB N="86" REF="024800_0082_0FCD630710222850"/>in the fort with Bayard and Nichols, whom he had, before that time, imprisoned, but refused to deliver them up, or to surrender the garrison. From this moment, he lost all credit with the governor, who joined the other party against him. On the second demand of the fort, Milborne and Delanoy came out, under pretence of conferring with his excellency, but in reality to discover his designs. Slough∣ter, who considered them as rebels, threw them both into goal. Leisler, upon this event, thought proper to abandon the fort, which colonel Sloughter immediately entered. Bayard and Nichols were now released from their confine∣ment, and sworn of the privy council. Leisler having thus ruined his cause, was apprehended with many of his adhe∣rents, and a commission of oyer and terminer issued to sir Thomas Robinson, colonel Smith, and others, for their trials.</P>
<P>In vain did they plead the merit of their zeal for king William, since they had so lately opposed his governor. Leisler, in particular, endeavoured to justify his conduct, insisting, that lord Nottingham's letter entitled him to act in the quality of lieutenant-governor. Whether it was through ignorance or sycophancy, I know not: but the judges, instead of pronouncing their own sentiments upon this part of the prisoner's defence, referred it to the go∣vernor and council, praying their opinion, whether that letter "or any other letters, or papers, in the packet from White-hall, can be understood, or interpreted, to be and contain, any power, or direction to captain Leisler, to take the government of this province upon himself, or that the administration thereupon be holden good in law." The an∣swer was, as might have been expected, in the negative; and Leisler and his son were condemned to death for high treason. These violent measures drove many of the inhabi∣tants, who were fearful of being apprehended into the neighbouring colonies, which shortly after occasioned the passing an act of general indemnity.</P>
<P>From the surrender of the province, to the year 1683, the inhabitants were ruled by the duke's governors and their councils, who, from time to time, made rules and orders, which were esteemed to be binding as laws. These, about the year 1674, were regularly collected under alphabetical titles; and a fair copy of them remains, among our records, to this day. They are commonly known by the name of the duke's laws. The title page of the book, written in the old court hand, is in these bald words,</P>

<P>Those acts, which were made in 1683, and after the duke's accession to the throne, when the people were ad∣mitted to a participation of the legislative power, are for the most part rotten, defaced, or lost.

James Graham was elected their speaker, and approved by the governor.</P>
<P>The majority of the members of this assembly were a∣gainst the measures, which Leisler pursued in the latter part of his time; and hence we find the house, after consider∣ing a petition signed by sundry persons against Leisler, un∣animously resolved, that his dissolving the late convention, and imprisoning several persons, was tumultuous, illegal, and against their majesties' right, and that the late depre∣dations on Schenectady, were to be attributed to his usur∣pation of all power.</P>
<P>They resolved against the late forcible seizures made of effects of the people, and against the levying of money on their majesties' subjects. And as to Leisler's holding the fort against the governor, it was voted to be an act of rebellion.</P>
<P>The house having, by these agreeable resolves, prepared the way of their access to the governor, addressed him in these words.</P>

<P>Before this house proceeded to pass any acts, they unani∣mously resolved: "That all the laws consented to by the general assembly, under James duke of York, and the liber∣ties and privileges therein contained, granted to the people, and declared to be their rights, not being observed, nor ratified and approved by his royal highness, nor the late
<PB N="89" REF="024800_0085_0FCD630DE6FDEB18"/>king, are null and void, and of none effect; and also, the several ordinances, made by the late governors and councils, being contrary to the constitution of England, and the practice of the government of their majesties' other plantations in America, are likewise null and void, and of no effect, nor force, within this province."</P>
<P>Among the principal laws enacted at this session, we may mention that for establishing the revenue, which was drawn into precedent. The sums raised by it, were made payable into the hands of the receiver-general, and issued by the governor's warrant. By this means the governor became, for a season, independent of the people; and hence we find frequent instances of the assemblies contending with him for the discharge of debts to private persons, contracted on the faith of the government.</P>
<P>Antecedent to the revolution, innumerable were the con∣troversies relating to public townships and private rights; and hence, an act was now passed, for the confirmation of an∣cient patents and grants, intended to put an end to those de∣bates. A law was also passed for the establishment of courts of justice, tho' a perpetual act had been made to that purpose in 1683, and the old court of assize entirely dissolved in 1684. As this enacted in 1691, was a temporary law, it may hereafter be disputed, as it has been already, whether the present esta∣blishment of our courts, for general jurisdiction, by an or∣dinance, can consist even with the preceding act, or the general rules of law. Upon the erection of the supreme court, a chief justice, and four assistant judges, with an at∣torney general, were appointed. The chief justice, Joseph Dudley, had a salary of 130<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum: Johnson, the se∣cond judge, 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and both were payable out of the revenue: but William Smith, Stephen Van Courtlandt, and William Pinhorne, the other judges, and Newton, the attorney-gen∣eral, had nothing allowed for their services.</P>
<P>It has, more than once, been a subject of animated debate, whether the people, in this colony, have a right to be re∣presented in assembly, or whether it be a privilege enjoyed, thro' the grace of the crown. A memorable act, passed this session, virtually declared in favour of the former opinion, upon that, and several other of the principal and distin∣guishing liberties of Englishmen. It must, nevertheless, be confessed, that king William was afterwards pleased to re∣peal that law, in the year 1697<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was entitled, "An act declaring what are the rights and privileges of their majesties' subjects, inhabiting within their province of New-York."</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="024800_0086_0FCD630F8EC50180"/>
Colonel Sloughter proposed, immediately after the ses∣sion, to set out to Albany; but as Leisler's party were en∣raged at his imprisonment, and the late sentence against him, his enemies were afraid new troubles would spring up in the absence of the governor; for this reason, both the assembly and council advised that the prisoners should be immediately executed. Sloughter, who had no inclination to favour them in this request, chose rather to delay such a violent step, being fearful of cutting off two men, who had vigorously appeared for the king, and so signally con∣tributed to the revolution. Nothing could be more disagree∣able to their enemies, whose interest was deeply concerned in their destruction. And therefore, when no other mea∣sures could prevail with the governor, tradition informs us, that a sumptuous feast was prepared, to which colonel Sloughter was invited. When his excellency's reason was drowned in his cups, the intreaties of the company pre∣vailed with him to sign the death warrant, and, before he recovered his senses, the prisoners were executed. Leisler's son afterwards carried home a complaint to king William, against the governor. His petition was referred, according to the common course of plantation affairs, to the lords com∣missioners of trade, who, after hearing the whole matter, reported on the 11th of March 1692, "That they were hum∣bly of opinion, that Jacob Leisler and Jacob Milborne de∣ceased, were condemned and had suffered according to law." Their lordships, however, interceded for their families, as fit objects of mercy: and this induced queen Mary, who approved the report, on the 17th of March, to de∣clare, "That upon the humble application of the relations of the said Jacob Leisler and Jacob Milborne deceased, her majesty will order the estates of Jacob Leisler and Jacob Mil∣borne; to be restored to their families, as objects of her ma∣jesty's mercy." The bodies of these unhappy sufferers were afterwards taken up and interred, with great pomp, in the old Dutch church, in the city of New-York. Their estates were restored to their families; and Leisler's children, in the public estimation, are rather dignified, than disgraced, by the fall of their ancestor.</P>
<P>These distractions, in the province, so entirely engrossed the public attention, that our Indian allies, who had been loft solely to contend with the common enemy, grew ex∣tremely disaffected. The Mohawks, in particular, highly resented this conduct, and, at the instance of the Caghnu∣agaes, sent a messenger to Canada, to confer with count Frontenac about a peace. To prevent this, colonel Slough∣ter had an interview at Albany, in June, with the other
<PB N="91" REF="024800_0087_0FCD631117975E20"/>four nations, who expressed their joy at seeing a governor again in that place. They told him, that their ancestors, as they had been informed, were greatly surprised at the ar∣rival of the first ship in that country, and were curious to know what was in its huge belly. That they found christians in it, and one Jacques, with whom they made a chain of friendship, which they had preserved to this day. All the Indians, except the Mohawks, assured the governor at this meeting, of their resolution to prosecute the war. The Mo∣hawks confessed their negociations with the French, that they had received a belt from Canada, and prayed the ad∣vice of the governor, and afterwards renewed their league with all our colonies.</P>
<P>Sloughter soon after returned to New-York, and ended a short, weak, and turbulent administration; for he died suddenly on the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of July 1691. Some were not without suspicions, that he came unfairly to his end: but the cer∣tificate of the physician and surgeons who opened his body, by an order of council, confuted these conjectures; and his remains were interred in Stuyvesant's vault, next to those of the old Dutch governor.</P>
<P>At the time of Sloughter's decease, the government de∣volved, according to the late act for declaring the rights of the people of this province, on the council, in which Jo∣seph Dudley had a right to preside: but they committed the chief command to Richard Ingolsby, a captain of an inde∣pendent company, who was sworn into the office of presi∣dent on the the 26th of July 1698. Dudley, soon afterwards, returned to this province, from Boston, but did not think proper to dispute Ingolsby's authority, though the latter had no title, nor the greatest abilities for government, and was besides obnoxious to the party who had joined Leisler, having been an agent in the measures which accomplished his ruin. To the late troubles, which were then recent, and the agreement subsisting between the council and as∣sembly we must ascribe it, that the former tacitly acknow∣ledged Ingolsby's right to the president's chair; for they concurred with him, in passing several laws, in autumn and the spring following, the validity of which have never yet been disputed.</P>
<P>This summer, mayor Schuyler<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French, from his great influence at Albany, and activity among the Indians, concluded that he was gover∣nor of that city; and hence, their historians honour him with that title, though he was then only mayor of the cor∣poration. "Pierre Schuyler (says Charlevoix) <HI>etoit un fort honnete homme.</HI>"</NOTE>, with a party of Mohawks,
<PB N="92" REF="024800_0088_0FCD63124EC47CB0"/>passed through the lake Champlain, and made a bold irrup∣tion upon the French settlements, at the north end of it.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Colden relates it as a transaction of the year 1691, which is true: but he supposes it was before sir William Phips's attack upon Quebec, and thus falls into an anachron∣ism of a whole year, as I have already observed.</NOTE> De Callieres, the governor of Montreal, to oppose him, collected a small army, of eight hundred men, and encamp∣ed at la Prairie. Schuyler had several conflicts with the enemy, and slew about three hundred of them, which ex∣ceeded in number his whole party. The French, ashamed of their ill success, attribute it to the want of order, too many desiring to have the command. But the true cause was, the ignorance of their officers in the Indian manner of fighting. They kept their men in a body, while ours posted themselves behind trees, hidden from the enemy. Major Schuyler's design, in this descent, was to animate the Indi∣ans, and preserve their enmity with the French. They, accordingly, continued their hostilities against them, and, by frequent incursions, kept the country in constant alarm.</P>
<P>In the midst of these distresses, the French governor pre∣served his sprightliness and vigour, animating every body about him. After he had served himself of the Utawawas, who came to trade at Montreal, he sent them home under the care of a captain and one hundred and ten men; and to secure their attachment to the French interest, gave them two Indian prisoners, and, besides, sent very considerable presents to the western Indians, in their alliance. The cap∣tives were afterwards burnt. The five nations, in the mean time, grew more and more incensed, and continually har∣rassed the French borders. Mr. Beaucour, a young gentle∣man, in the following winter, marched a body of about three hundred men to attack them at the isthmus, at Niaga∣ra. Incredible were the fatigues they underwent in this long march over the show, bearing their provisions on their backs. Eighty men, of the five nations, opposed the French party, and bravely maintained their ground, till most of them were cut off. In return for which, the confederates, in small parties, obstructed the passage of the French through lake Ontario, and the river issuing out of it, and
<PB N="93" REF="024800_0089_0FCD63141AE9F420"/>cut off their communication with the western Indians. An Indian, called Black Kettle, commanded in these incursions of the five nations, and his successes, which continued the whole summer, so exasperated the count, that he ordered an Indian prisoner to be burnt alive. The bravery of this savage was as extraordinary, as the torments inflicted on him were cruel. He sung his military achievements without in∣terruption, even while his bloody executioners practised all possible barbarities. They broiled his feet, thrust his fingers into red hot pipes, cut his joints, and twisted the sinews with bars of iron. After this his scalp was ripped off, and hot sand poured on the wound.</P>
<P>In June 1692, captain Ingolsby met the five nations, at Albany, and encouraged them to persevere in the war. The Indians declared their enmity to the French, in the strong∣est terms, and as heartily professed their friendship to us. "Brother Corlear," said the sachem, "we are all subjects of one great king and queen: we have one head, one heart, one interest, and are all engaged in the same war." The Indians, at the same time, did not forget, at this in∣terview, to condemn the inactivity of the English, telling them, that the destruction of Canada would not make one summer's work, against their united strength, if vigorous∣ly exerted.</P>
<P>Colonel Benjamin Fletcher arrived with a commission to be governor, on the 29th of August, 1692, which was pub∣lished the next day, before the following members, in council:</P>

</LIST>
<P>William Pinhorne, one of that board, being a non-resi∣dent, was refused the oaths; and Joseph Dudley, for the same reason, removed, both from his seat in council, and his office of chief justice. Caleb Heath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote and John Young succeeded them in council: and William Smith was seated, in Dudley's place, on the bench.</P>
<P>Colonel Fletcher brought over with him a present to the colony, of arms, ammunition, and warlike stores; in grati∣tude for which, he exhorted the council and assembly, who were sitting at his arrival, to send home an address of thanks to the king. It consists, principally, of a representa∣tion of the great expense the province was continually at to defend the frontiers, and praying his majesty's direction, that the neighbouring colonies might be compelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to join their aid, for the support of Albany. The following pas∣sage
<PB N="94" REF="024800_0090_0FCD63154D326EE8"/>in it shows the sense of the legislature, upon a matter which has since been very much debated. "When these countries were possessed by the Dutch West-India company, they always had pretences (and had the most part of it with∣in their actual jurisdiction) to all that tract of land (with the islands adjacent) extending, from the west side of Connecti∣cut river, to the lands lying on the west side of Delaware bay, as a suitable portion of land for one colony or govern∣ment; all which, including the lands on the west of Dela∣ware bay or river, were in the duke of York's grant, from his majesty king Charles the second, whose governors also possessed those lands on the west side of Delaware bay or river. By several grants, as well from the crown, as from the duke, the said province has been so diminished, that it is now decreased to a very few towns and villages; the number of men fit to bear arms, in the whole government, not amounting to 3000, who are all reduced to great po∣verty."</P>
<P>Fletcher was by profession a soldier, a man of strong pas∣sions, and inconsiderable talents, very active, and equally avaricious. Nothing could be more fortunate to him, than his early acquaintance with major Schuyler, at Albany, at the treaty, for confirmation of the Indian alliance, the fall after his arrival. No man, then in this province, understood the state of our affairs with the five nations better than ma∣jor Schuyler. He had so great an influence over them, that whatever Quider<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Instead of Peter, which they could not pronounce.</NOTE>, as they called him, recommended or disapproved, had the force of a law. This power over them was supported, as it had been obtained, by repeated offices of kindness, and his singular bravery and activity in the defence of his country. These qualifications rendered him singularly serviceable and necessary, both to the province and the governor. For this reason, Fletcher took him in∣to his confidence, and, on the 25th of October, raised him to the council board. Under the tutelage of major Schuy∣ler, the governor became daily more and more acquainted with our Indian affairs; his constant application to which, procured and preserved him a reputation and influence in the colony. Without this knowledge, and which was all that he had to distinguish himself, his incessant solicitations for money, his passionate temper and bigotted principles, must necessarily have rendered him obnoxious to the peo∣ple, and kindled a hot fire of contention in the province.</P>
<P>The old French governor, who found that all his measures for accomplishing a peace with the five nations, proved abor∣tive,
<PB N="95" REF="024800_0091_0FCD6319C25248B8"/>was now meditating a blow on the Mohawks. He ac∣cordingly collected an army of six or seven hundred French and Indians, and supplied them with every thing necessary for a winter campaign. They set out from Montreal, on the 15th of January, 1693; and after a march attended with incredible hardships, they passed by Schenectady, on the 6th of February, and, that night, captivated five men and some women and children, at the first castle of the Mo∣hawks. The second castle was taken with equal ease, the Indian inhabitants being in perfect security, and, for the most part, at Schenectady. At the third, the enemy found about forty Indians in a war dance, designing to go out, up∣on some enterprise, the next day. Upon their entering the castle a conflict ensued, in which the French lost about thir∣ty men. Three hundred of our Indians were made captives, in this descent; and, but for the intercession of the savages in the French interest, would all have been put to the sword<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Colden and the jesuit Charlevoix are not perfectly agreed in the history of this irruption. I have followed, sometimes the former, and at other times the latter; ac∣cording as the facts, more immediately, related to the con∣duct of their respective countrymen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Indians were enraged, and with good reason, at the people of Schenectady, who gave them no assistance against the enemy, though they had notice of their marching by that village. But this was atoned for by the succours from Al∣bany. Colonel Schuyler voluntarily headed a party of two hundred men, and went out against the enemy. On the 15th of February, he was joined by near three hundred Indians, ill armed, and many of them boys. A pretended deserter, who came to dissuade the Indians from the pur∣suit, informed him, the next day, that the French had built a fort, and waited to fight him; upon which he sent to In∣golsby, the commandant at Albany, as well for a reinforce∣ment as for a supply of provisions; for the greatest part of his men came out, with only a few biscuits in their pockets, and at the time they fell in with the enemy, on the 17th of the month, had been several days without any kind of food. Upon approaching the French army, sundry skirmishes en∣sued; the enemy endeavouring to prevent our Indians from felling trees for their protection. Captain Syms, with eighty regulars of the independent companies, and a sup∣ply of provisions, arrived on the 19th; but the enemy had marched off the day before in a great snow storm. Our party
<PB N="96" REF="024800_0092_0FCD631BA40D37B0"/>however pursued them, and would have attacked their rear, if the Mohawks had not been averse to it. When the French reached the north branch of Hudson's river, luckily a cake of ice served them to cross over it, the river being open both above and below. The frost was now extremely severe, and the Mohawks fearful of an engagement; upon which Schuy∣ler, who had retaken about fifty Indian captives, desisted from the pursuit on the 20th of February; four of his men and as many Indians being killed, and twelve wounded. Our In∣dians, at this time, were so distressed for provisions, that they fed upon the dead bodies of the French; and the ene∣my, in their turn, were reduced, before they got home, to eat up their shoes. The French in this enterprise lost eighty men, and had above thirty wounded.</P>
<P>Fletcher's extraordinary dispatch up to Albany, upon the first news of this descent, gained the esteem both of the public and our Indian allies.</P>
<P>The express reached New-York on the 12th of February, at ten o'clock in the night, and in less than two days, the governor embarked with three hundred volunteers. The river, which was heretofore very uncommon at that season, was open<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The climate of late years is much altered, and this day (February 14, 1756) three hundred recruits sailed from New-York for the army under the command of general Shirley, now quartered at Albany; and last year, a sloop went up the river a month earlier.</NOTE>. Fletcher landed at Albany, and arrived at Schenectady, the 17th of the month, which is about one hundred and sixty miles from New-York: but he was still too late to be of any other use than to strengthen the anci∣ent alliance. The Indians, in commendation of his activity on the occasion, gave him the name of Cayenguirago, or, the great swift arrow.</P>
<P>Fletcher returned to New-York, and, in March, met the assembly, who were so well pleased with his late vigilance, that besides giving him the thanks of the house, they raised 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for a year's pay of three hundred volunteers, and their officers, for the defence of the frontiers.</P>
<P>As the greatest part of this province consisted of Dutch in∣habitants, all our governors, as well in the duke's time, as after the revolution, thought it good policy to encourage English preachers and schoolmasters in the colony. No man could be more bent upon such a project than Fletcher, a bi∣got to the espiscopal form of church government. He, ac∣cordingly, recommended this matter to the assembly, on his
<PB N="97" REF="024800_0093_0FCD631CDC6B6400"/>first arrival, as well as at their present meeting. The house, from their attachment to the Dutch language, and the mo∣del of the church of Holland, secured by one of the arti∣cles of surrender, were entirely disinclined to the scheme, which occasioned a warm rebuke from the governor, in his speech at the close of the session, in these words; "gentle∣men, the first thing that I did recommend to you, at our last meeting, was to provide for a ministry, and nothing is done in it. There are none of you, but what are big with the privileges of Englishment and magna charta, which is your right; and the same law doth provide for the religion of the church of England, against sabbath-breaking, and all other profanity. But as you have made it last, and post∣poned it this session, I hope you will begin with it the next meeting, and do somewhat toward it effectually."</P>
<P>The news of the arrival of the recruits and ammunition at Canada, the late loss of the Mohawks, and the unfulfill∣ed promises of assistance, made from time to time, by the English, together with the incessant solicitations of Milet, the jesuit, all conspired to induce the Oneydoes to sue for a peace with the French. To prevent so important an event, Fletcher met the five nations at Albany, in July 1693, with a considerable present of knives, hatchets, clothing, and ammunition, which had been sent over, by the crown, for that purpose. The Indians consented to a renewal of the ancient league, and expressed their gratitude, for the king's donation, with singular force. "Brother Cayenguirago, we roll and wallow in joy, by reason of the great favour the great king and queen have done us, in sending us arms and ammunition at a time when we are in the greatest need of them; and because there is such unity among the bre∣thren." Colonel Fletcher pressed their delivering up to him Milet, the old priest, which they promised, but never per∣formed. On the contrary, he had influence enough to per∣suade all, but the Mohawks, to treat about the peace at Onondaga, though the governor exerted himself to prevent it.</P>
<P>Soon after this interview, Fletcher returned to New-York; and, in September, met a new assembly, of which James Graham was chosen speaker. The governor laboured, at this session, to procure the establishment of a ministry throughout the colony, a revenue to his majesty for life, the repairing the fort in New-York, and the erection of a chapel. That part of his speech, relating to the ministry, was in these words: "I recommended to the former assem∣bly, the settling of an able ministry, that the worship of God may be observed among us; for I find that great and first
<PB N="98" REF="024800_0094_0FCD631E50F5E370"/>duty very much neglected. Let us not forget that there is a God, that made us, who will protect us, if we serve him. This has been always the first thing I have recommended, yet the last in your consideration. I hope you are all satisfi∣ed of the great necessity and duty, that lies upon you to do this, as you expect his blessing upon your labours." The zeal with which this affair was recommended, induced the house, on the 12th of September, to appoint a committee of eight members, to agree upon a scheme for settling a ministry, in each respective precinct, throughout the pro∣vince. This committee made a report the next day; but it was recommitted till the afternoon, and then deferred to the next morning. Several debates arising about the report, in the house, it was again "recommitted for farther considera∣tion." On the 15th of September, it was approved, the es∣tablishment being then limited to several parishes in four countries, and a bill ordered to be brought in accordingly; which the speaker (who, on the 18th of September, was appointed to draw all their bills) produced on the 19th. It was read twice on the same day, and then referred to a com∣mittee of the whole house. The third reading was on the 21st of September, when the bill passed, and was sent up to the governor and council, who immediately returned it with an amendment, to vest his excellency with an episco∣pal power of inducting every incumbent, adding to that part of the bill near the end, which gave the right of the presenta∣tion to the people, these words "and presented to the go∣vernor, to be approved and collated." The house declined their consent to the addition, and immediately returned the bill, praying, "that it may pass without the amend∣ment, having, in the drawing of the bill, had a due re∣gard to that pious intent of settling a ministry, for the be∣nefit of the people." Fletcher was so exasperated with their refusal, that he no sooner received the answer of the house, than he convened them before him, and in an angry speech broke up the session. I shall lay that part of it, relating to this bill, before the reader, because it is characteristic of the man.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>There is also a bill for settling a ministry in this city, and some other countries of the government. In that very thing you have shown a great deal of stiffness. You take up∣on you, as if you were dictators. I sent down to you an amendment of three or four words in that bill, which, though very immaterial, yet was positively denied. I must tell you, it seems very unmannerly. There never was an amendment yet desired by the council board, but what was
<PB N="99" REF="024800_0095_0FCD631FED726A28"/>rejected. It is the sign of a stubborn ill temper, and this have also passed.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, I must take leave to tell you, if you seem to understand by these words, that none can serve without your collation or establishment, you are far mis∣taken. For I have the power of collating or suspending any minister, in my government, by their majesties' letters pa∣tent; and whilst I stay in the government, I will take care, that neither heresy, sedition, schism, or rebellion, be preached among you, nor vice and profanity encouraged. It is my endeavour, to lead a virtuous and pious life amongst you, and to give a good example: I wish you all to do the same. You ought to consider, that you have but a third share in the legislative power of the government; and ought not to take all upon you, nor be so peremptory. You ought to let the council have a share. They are in the nature of the house of lords, or upper house; but you seem to take the whole power in your hands, and set up for every thing. You have set a long time, to little purpose, and have been a great charge to the country. Ten shillings a day is a large allowance, and you punctually exact it. You have been always forward enough to pull down the fees of other ministers in the government. Why did you not think it expedient to correct your own, to a more moderate allow∣ance?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I shall say no more, at present, but that you do withdraw to your private affairs in the country. I do prorogue you to the tenth of January next, and you are hereby prorogued to the tenth day of January next ensu∣ing.</P>

<P>The violence of this man's temper is very evident in all his speeches and messages to the assembly; and it can only be attributed to the ignorance of the times, that the members of that house, instead of asserting their equality, peaceably put up with his rudeness. Certainly they deserved better usage at his hands. For the revenue, established the last year, was, at this session, continued five years longer than was originally intended. This was rendering the governor for a time independent of the people. For, at that day, the as∣sembly had no treasure; but the amount of all taxes went of course into the hands of the receiver-general, who was appointed by the crown. Out of this fund, monies were only issuable by the governor's warrant; so that every officer in the government, from mr. Blaithwait, who drew annually five per cent, out of the revenue, as auditor-general, down to the meanest servant of the public, became dependent, sole∣ly, of the governor. And hence we find the house, at the close
<PB N="100" REF="024800_0096_0FCD63CA0CCBECB8"/>of every session, humbly addressing his excellency, for the trifling wages of their own clerk. Fletche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was, notwith∣standing, so much displeased with them, that, soon after the prorogation, he dissolved the assembly.</P>
<P>The members of the new assembly met, according to the writ of summons, in March 1694, and chose colonel Peirson, for their speaker, mr. Graham being left out at the election for the city. The shortness of this session, which continued only to the latter end of the month, was owing to the dis∣agreeable business the house began upon, of examining the state of the public accounts, and in particular the muster rolls of the volunteers, in the pay of the province. They, however, resumed it again in September, and formally en∣tered their dissatisfaction, with the receiver-general's ac∣counts. The governor, at the same time, blew up the coals of contention, by a demand of additional pay, for the king's soldiers, then just arrived, and new supplies for detachments in defence of the frontiers. He at last prorogued them, af∣ter obtaining an act for supporting one hundred men upon the borders. The same disputes revived again in the spring 1695; and proceeded to such lengths, that the assembly ask∣ed the governor's leave to print their minutes, that they might appeal to the public. It was at this session, on the 12th of April 1695, that upon a petition of five church wardens and vestrymen of the city of New-York, the house declared it to be their opinion, "That the vestrymen and church∣wardens have power to call a dissenting protestant minster, and that he is to be paid and maintained as the act directs." The intent of this petition was to refute an opinion, which prevailed, that the late ministry act was made for the sole benefit of episcopal clergymen.</P>
<P>The quiet, undisturbed state of the frontiers, while the French were endeavouring to make a peace with the five na∣tions, and the complaints of many of the volunteers, who had not received their pay, very much conduced to the back∣wardness of the assembly, in answering Fletcher's perpetual demands of money. But when the Indians refused to com∣ply with the terms of peace demanded by the French go∣vernor, which were to suffer him to rebuild the fort at Ca∣daraqui, and to include the Indian allies, the war broke out afresh, and the assembly were obliged to augment both their detachments and supplies. The count Frontenac now le∣velled his wrath, principally against the Mohawks, who were more attached, than any other of the five nations, to our interest: but as his intentions had taken air, he pru∣dendy changed his measures, and sent a party of three hun∣dred men, to the isthmus at Niagara, to surprise those of
<PB N="101" REF="024800_0097_0FCD638613593388"/>the five nations, that might be hunting there. Among a few that were met with, some were killed, and others taken prisoners, and afterwards burnt at Montreal. Our Indians imitated the count's example, and burnt ten Dewagunga captives.</P>
<P>Colonel Fletcher and his assembly having come to an open rupture in the spring, he called another in June, of which James Graham was chosen speaker. The count Frontenac was then repairing the old fort at Cada<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aqui; and the intel∣ligence of this, and the king's assignment of the quotas of the several colonies, for an united force<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As such an union appeared to be necessary so long ago, it is very surprising that no effectual scheme for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pur∣pose has hitherto been carried into full execution. A p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an was concerted, in the great congress consisting of commis∣sioners from several colonies, met at Albany, in 1754; but what approbation it received at home, has not hitherto been made public. The danger to Great Britain, apprehended from our united force, is founded in a total ignorance of the true state and character of the colonies. None of his majes∣ty's subjects are more loyal, or more strongly attached to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otestant principles; and the remarkable attestation, in the elegant address of the lords of the 13th of November 1755, in our favour, "That we are a great body of brave and faithful subjects," is as justly due to us, as it was nobly said by them.</NOTE> against the French, were the principal matters which the governor laid before the assembly. The list of the quotas was this.</P>

<P>As a number of forces were now arrived the assembly were in hopes, the province would be relieved from raising any more men for the defence of the frontiers; and, to obtain this favour of the governor, ordered £ 1000. to be levied, one half to be presented to him, and the rest he had leave to distribute among the English officers and soldiers. A bill for this purpose was drawn; but though his excellency thank∣ed them for their favourable intention, he thought it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his honour to consent to it. After passing several laws, the session broke up in perfect harmony, the governor, in his great grace, recommending it to the house, to appoint a com∣mittee to examine the public accounts against the next ses∣sions.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="024800_0098_0FCD57FC5DE555E8"/>
In September, Fletcher went up to Albany, with very considerable presents to the Indians; whom he blamed for suffering the French to rebuild the fort at Cadaraqui, or Fron∣tenac, which commands the entrance from Canada, into the great lake Ontario.</P>
<P>While these works were carrying on, the Dionandadies, who were then poorly supplied by the French, made over∣tures of a peace with the five nations, which the latter readi∣ly embraced, because it was owing to their fears of these In∣dians, who lived near the lake Missilimachinac, that they ne∣ver dared to march with their whole strength against Ca∣nada. The French commandant was fully sensible of the importance of preventing this alliance. The civilities of the Dionandadies to the prisoners, by whom the treaty, to pre∣vent a discovery, was negociated, gave the officer the first suspicion of it. One of these wretches had the unhappiness to fall into the hands of the French, who put him to the most exquisite torments, that all future intercourse with the Dionandadies might be cut off. Dr. Colden, in just re∣sentment for this inhuman barbarity, has published the whole process from la Potherie's history of North America, and it is this:</P>
<P>"The prisoner being first made fast to a stake, so as to have room to move round it; a Frenchman began the hor∣rid tragedy, by broiling the flesh of the prisoner's legs, from his toes to his knees, with the red-hot barrel of a gun. His example was followed by an Utawawa, who, being desi∣rous to out do the French in their refined cruelty, split a fur∣row from the prisoner's shoulder to his garter, and filling it with gun-powder, set fire to it. This gave him exquisite pain, and raised excessive laughter in his tormentors. When they found his throat so much parched, that he was no longer able to gratify their ears with his howling, they gave him water, to enable him to continue their pleasure longer. But at last, his strength failing, an Utawawa fleated off his scalp, and threw burning hot coals on his scull. Then they untied him, and bid him run for his life. He began to run, tumbling like a drunken man. They shut up the way to the east, and made him run westward, the country, as they think, of departed miserable fouls. He had still force left to throw stones, till they put an end to his misery by knocking him on the head. After this every one cut a slice from his body, to conclude the tragedy with a feast."</P>
<P>From the time colonel Fletcher received his instruction, respecting the quotas of these colonies, for the defence of the frontiers, he repeatedly, but in vain, urged their com∣pliance with the king's direction: he then carried his com∣plaints
<PB N="103" REF="024800_0099_0FCD63214D2B1418"/>against them home to his majesty, but all his ap∣plications were defeated by the agents of those colonies, who resided in England. As soon, therefore, as he had laid this matter before the assembly, in autumn 1695, the house appointed William Nicol, to go home in the quality of an agent for this province, for which they allowed him £ 1000. But his solicitations proved unsuccessful, and the instruc∣tion, relating to these quotas, which is still continued, re∣mains unnoticed to this day. Fletcher maintained a good correspondence with the assembly, through the rest of his administration: and nothing appears, upon their journals, worth the reader's attention.</P>
<P>The French never had a governor, in Canada, so vigilant and active as the count de Frontenac. He had no sooner re∣paired the old fort, called by his name, than he formed a design of invading the country of the five nations with a great army. For this purpose, in 1696, he convened at Montreal, all the regulars, as well as militia, under his command; the Owenagungas, Quatoghies of Loretto, Adi∣rondacks, Sokakies, Nipiciriniens, the proselyted praying Indians of the five nations, and a few Utawawas. Instead of waggons and horses, which are useless in such a country, as he had to march through, the army was conveyed, through rivers and lakes, in light barks, which are porta∣ble, whenever the rapidity of the stream and the crossing an isthmus rendered it necessary. The count left la Chine, at the south end of the island of Montreal, on the 7th of July. Two battalions of regulars, under the command of le Chevalier de Callieres, headed by a number of Indians, led the van, with two small pieces of cannon, the mortars, grenadoes, and ammunition. After them followed the pro∣visions; then the main body, with the count's household, a considerable number of volunteers, and the engi∣neer; and four battalions of the militia commanded by monsieur de Ramezai, governor of Trois Rivieres.</P>
<P>Two battalions of regulars and a few Indians, under the chevalier de Vaudrueil, brought up the rear. Before the army went a parcel of scouts, to descry the tracks and am∣buscades of the enemy. After twelve days march, they ar∣rived at Cadaraqui, about one hundred and eighty miles from Montreal, and then crossed the lake to Oswego. Fifty men marched on each side of the Onondaga river, which is narrow and rapid. When they entered the little lake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Onondaga lake, noted for a good salt pit at the south east end; which, as it may be very advantageous to the garrison at Oswego, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oped the government will never grant to any private company.</NOTE>, the
<PB N="104" REF="024800_0100_0FCD63252B79A380"/>army divided into two parts, coasting along the edges, that the enemy might be unce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain as to the place of their land∣ing; and where they did land they erected a fort. The Onondagas had sent away their wives and children, and were determined to defend their castle, till they were in∣formed by a deserter, of the superior strength of the French, and the nature of bombs, which were intended to be used against them; and then after setting sire to their village, they retired into the woods. As soon as the count heard of this, he marched to their huts in order of battle; being himself carried in an elbow chair, behind the artillery. With this mighty apparatus he entered it, and the destruc∣tion of a little Indian corn was the great acquisition. A brave sachem, then about a hundred years old, was the only person who tarried in the castle to salute the old ge∣neral. The French Indians put him to torment, which he endured with astonishing presence of mind. To one who stabbed him with a knife, "you had better," says he," "make me die by fire, that these French dogs may learn how to suffer like men: you Indians, their allies, you dogs of dogs, think of me when you are in the like condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Never perhaps (says Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oix) was a man treated with more cruelty, nor did any ever bear it with superior magnanimity and resolution."</NOTE>." This sachem was the only man, of all the Onondagas, that was killed; and had not thirty-five Oneydoes, who waited to receive Vaud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ueil at their castles, been afterwards basely carried into captivity, the count would have returned with∣out the least mark of triumph. As soon as he began his re∣treat, the Onondagas followed, and annoyed his army by cutting off several batteaus.</P>
<P>This expensive enterprise, and the continual incursions of the five nations, on the country near Montreal, again spread a famine through all Canada. The count, however, kept up his spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its to the last; and sent out scalping parties, who infested Albany, as our Indians did Montreal, till the treaty of peace, signed at Ryswick, in 1697.</P>
<P>Richard, earl of Bellamont, was appointed to succeed colonel Fletcher, in the year 1695; but did not receive his commission till the 18th of June, 1697: and as he delayed his voyage till after the peace of Ryswick, which was signed the 10th of September following, he was blown off our coast to Barbadoes, and did not arrive here before the 2d of April, 1698.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="024800_0101_0FCD632697E8F4D8"/>
During the late war, the seas were extremely infested with English pirates, some of whom sailed out of New-York; and it was strongly suspected that they had received too much countenance here, even from the government, du∣ring Fletcher's administration. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is lordship's promotion to the chief command of the Massachusett's bay and New-Hampshire, as well as this province, was owing partly to his rank, but principally to the affair of the pitates; and the multiplicity of business, to which the charge of three colonies would necessarily expose him, induced the earl to bring over with him John Nanfan, his kinsman, in the qua∣lity of our lieutenant-governor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His commission was dated the 1st of July, 1697.</NOTE>. When lord Bellamont was appointed to the government of these provinces, the king did him the honour to say "that he thought him a man of resolution and integrity, and with these qualities more likely than any other he could think of, to put a stop to the growth of piracy."</P>
<P>Before the earl set out for America, he became acquainted with Robert Livingston, <ABBR>esq</ABBR><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This gentleman was a son of mr. John Livingston, one of the commissioners from Scotland to king Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les II. while he was an exile at Breda. He was a clergyman distinguished by his zeal and industry; and, for his opposition to episco∣pacy, became so obnoxious, after the restoration, to the En∣glish court, that he left Scotland, and took the pastoral charge of an English presbyterian church in Rotterdam. His descendants are very numerous in this province, and the fa∣mily in the first rank for their wealth, morals, and educa∣tion. The original diary, in the hand writing of their com∣mon ancestor, is still among them, and contains a history of his life.</NOTE> who was then in England, soliciting his own affairs before the counc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and the treasury. The earl took occasion, in one of his conferences with mr. Livingston, to mention the scandal the province was under on account of the pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, The latter, who confessed it was not without reason, brought the earl acquainted with one Kid, whom he recommended as a man of integrity and courage, that knew the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ates and their rendezvous, and would undertake to apprehend them, if the king would employ him in a good sailing frigate of 30 guns and 150 men. The earl laid the proposal before the king, who con∣sulted the admiralty upon that subject: but this project drop∣ped, through the uncertainty of the adventure, and the French war, which gave full employment to all the ships in
<PB N="106" REF="024800_0102_0FCD63292D6CD478"/>the navy. Mr. Livingston then proposed a private adventure against the pirates, offering to be concerned with Kid, a fifth part in the ship and charges, and to be bound for Kid's faithful execution of the commission. The king then ap∣proved of the design, and reserved a tenth share, to show that he was concerned in the enterprise▪ Lord chancellor Somers, the duke of Shrewsbury, the earls of Romu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and Oxford, sir Edmond Harrison and others, joined in the scheme, agreeing to the expense of 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> But the manage∣ment of the whole affair was left to lord Bellamont, who gave orders to Kid to pursue his commission, which was in common form. Kid sailed, from Plymouth, for New-York, in April, 1696; and afterwards turned pirate, burnt his ship, and came to Boston, where the earl apprehended him. His lordship wrote to the secretary of state, desiring that Kid might be sent for. The Rochester man of war was dispatch∣ed upon this service; but being driven back, a general suspi∣cion prevailed in England, that all was collusion between the ministry and the adventurers, who, it was thought, were unwilling Kid should be brought home, lest he might dis∣cover that the chancellor, the duke, and others, were con∣federates in the piracy. The matter even proceeded to such lengths, that a motion was made, in the house of commons, that all who were concerned in the adventure, might be turned out of their employments; but it was rejected by a great majority.</P>
<P>The tory party, who excited these clamours, though they lost their motion in the house, afterwards impeached se∣veral whig lords; and, among other articles, charged them with being concerned in Kid's piracy. But these prosecu∣tions served only to brighten the innocency of those, against whom they were brought; for the impeached lords were honourably acquitted by their peers.</P>
<P>Lord Bellamont's commission was published in council, on the day of his arrival; colonel Fletcher, who still re∣mained governor under the proprietors of Pennsylvania, and lieutenant governor Nanfan, being present. The mem∣bers of the council were,

<P>After the earl had dispatched captain John Schuyler, and Dellius, the Dutch minister of Albany, to Canada, with the account of the peace, and to solicit a mutual exchange of
<PB N="107" REF="024800_0103_0FCD632A53A3C178"/>prisoners; he laid before the council the letters from secre∣tary Vernon and the East-India company, relating to the pirates; informing that board, that he had an affidavit, that Fletcher had permitted them to land their spoils in this province, and that mr. Nic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> bargained for their protec∣tions, and received for his services 800 Spanish dollars. Nicoll confessed the receipt of the money for protec∣tions, but said it was in virtue of a late act of assembly, al∣lowing privateers on their giving security; but he denied the receipt of any money from known pirates. One Weaver was admitted, at this time, into the council-chamber, and acted in the quality of king's council, and in answer to mr. Nicoll, denied that there was any such act of assembly as he mentioned. After considering the whole matter, the council advised his excellency to send Fletcher home, but to try Nicoll here, because his estate would not bear the expense of a trial in England. Their advice was never carried into execution, which was probably owing to a want of evidence against the parties accused. It is nevertheless certain, that the pirates were frequently in the sound, and supplied with provisions by the inhabitants of Long Island, who, for many years afterwards, were so infatuated with a notion, that the pirates buried great quantities of money along the coast, that there is scarce a point of land, or an island without the marks of their <HI>auri sacra fames.</HI> Some credulous people have ruined themselves by these researches, and propagated a thousand idie fables current to this day, among our country farmers.</P>
<P>As Fletcher, through the whole of his administration, had been entirely influenced by the enemies of Leisler; no∣thing could be more agreeable to the numerous adherents of that unhappy man, than the earl's disaffection to the late governor. It was for this reason, they immediately devoted themselves to his lordship, as the head of their party.</P>
<P>The majority of the members of the council were Fletch∣er's friends; and there needed nothing more to render them obnoxious to his lordship. Leisler's advocates, at the same time, mortally hated them; not only because they had im∣brued their hands in the blood of the principal men of their party, but also because they had engrossed the sole confi∣dence of the late governor, and brought down his resent∣ment upon them. Hence, at the commencement of the earl's administration, the members of the council had every thing to fear; while the party they had depressed, be∣gan once again to erect its head under the smiles of a gover∣nor, who was fond of their aid, as they were solicitous to conciliate his favour. Had the earl countenanced the ene∣mies, as well as the friends of Leis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, which he might have done, his administration would doubtless have been easier
<PB N="108" REF="024800_0104_0FCD632BCE4B4D40"/>to himself and advantageous to the province. But his in∣flexible aversion to Fletcher prevented his acting with that moderation, which was necessary to enable him to govern both parties. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his temper appeared very early, on his suspending mr. Nicoll from the board of council, and obliging him to enter into a recognizance in 2000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to answer fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his conduct relating to the protections. But his speech to the new assembly, convened on the 18th of May, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the fullest evidence of his abhorrence of the late ad∣ministration. Philip French was chosen speaker, and waited upon his excellency with the house, when his lordship spoke to them in the following manner:</P>
<P>"I cannot but observe to you, what a legacy my prede∣cessor has left me, and what difficulties to struggle with; a divided people, an empty purse, a few miserable, naked, half-starved soldiers, not half the number the king allowed pay for: the fortifications and even the governor's house very much out of repair, and, in a word, the whole go∣vernment out of frame. It hath been represented to the go∣vernment in England, that this province has been a noted receptacle of pirates, and the trade of it under no restricti∣on, but the acts of trade violated by the neglect and con∣nivance of those, whose duty it was to have prevented it."</P>
<P>After this introduction, he puts them in mind that the revenue was near expiring. "It would be hard, says he, if I that come among you with an honest mind, and a reso∣lution to be just to your interest, should meet with greater difficulties, in the discharge of his majesty's service, than those that have gone before me. I will take care there shall be no misapplication of the public money. I will pocket none of it myself, nor shall there be any embezzlement by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers; but exact accounts shall be given you, when, and as often as you shall require."</P>
<P>It was customary with Fletcher, to be present in the field, to influence elections; and as the assembly consisted, at this time, of but nineteen members, they were too easi∣ly influenced to serve the private ends of a faction. For that reason, his lordship was warm in a scheme of increasing their number, at present, to thirty, and so, in proportion, as the colony became more populous; and hence we find the following clause in his speech. "You cannot but know, what abuses have been formerly in elections of members, to serve in the general assembly, which tends to the subversion of your liberties. I do therefore recommend the making of a law to provide against it."</P>
<P>The house, though unanimous in a hearty address of thanks to the governor for his speech, could scarce agree
<PB N="109" REF="024800_0105_0FCD632D5331D568"/>upon any thing else. It was not till the beginning of June, before they had finished the controversies relating to the late turbulent elections; and even then six members seceded from the house, which obliged his excellency to dissolve the assembly on the 14th of June, 1693. About the same time, the governor dismissed two of the council; Pinhorne, for disrespectful words of the king, and Brook, the receiver-general, who was also turned out of that office, as well as removed from his place on the bench.</P>
<P>In July, the disputes with the French, concerning the ex∣changing of prisoners, obliged his excellency to go up to Albany. When the earl sent the account of the conclusion of the peace to the governor of Canada, all the French pri∣soners, in our custody, were restored, and as to those among the Indians, he promised to order them to be safely escort∣ed to Montreal. His lordship then added, "I doubt not, sir, that you; on your part, will also issue an order to re∣lieve the subjects of the king, captivated during the war, whether christians or Indians."</P>
<P>The count, fearful of being drawn into an implicit ac∣knowledgment, that the five nations were subject to the English crown, demanded the French prisoners, among the Indians, to be brought to Montreal; threatening, at the same time, to continue the war against the confederates, if they did not comply with his request. After the earl's in∣terview with them, he wrote a second letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix has published both these letters, at large, together with count Frontenac's answer. I have had no op∣portunity of enquiring into the jesuit's integrity, in these transcripts, being unable to find his lordship's letters in the secretary's office.</NOTE> to the count, informing him that they had importunately begged to con∣tinue under the protection of the English crown, professing an inviolable subjection and fidelity to his majesty; and that the five nations were always considered as subjects, which, says his lordship, "can be manifested to all the world by authentic and solid proofs." His lordship added, that he would not suffer them to be insulted, and threatened to exe∣cute the laws of England upon the missionaries, if they con∣tinued any longer in the five cantons. A resolute spirit runs through the whole letter, which concludes in these words: "if it is necessary, I will arm every man in the provinces, under my government, to oppose you; and redress the in∣jury that you may perpetrate against our Indians." The
<PB N="110" REF="024800_0106_0FCD633233B8F398"/>count, in his answer, proposed to refer the dispute to the commissaries, to be appointed according to the treaty of Ryswick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The count misunderstood the treaty. No provision was made by it for commissaries to settle the limits between the English and French possessions, but only to examine and de∣termine the controverted rights and pretensions to Hudson's Bay.</NOTE> but the earl continued the claim, insisting that the French prisoners should be delivered up at Albany.</P>
<P>The French count dying while this matter was contro∣verted, monsieur de Callieres, his successor, sent ambassa∣dors, the next year, to Onondaga, there to regulate the exchange of prisoners, which was accomplished without the earl's consent; and thus the important point, in dis∣pute, remained unsettled. The jesuit Bruyas, who was up∣on this embassage, offered to live at Onondaga; but the Indians ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed his belt, saying that Corlear, or the gover∣nor of New-York, had already offered them ministers for their instruction.</P>
<P>Great alterations were made in council, at his excellency is return from Albany. Bayard, Mienvielle, Willet, Townly, and Lawrence, were all suspended on the 28th of Septem∣ber; and colonel Abraham Depeyster, Robert Livingston, and Samuel Staats, called to that board. The next day, Fre∣derick Philipse resigned his seat, and Robert Walters was sworn in his stead.</P>
<P>The new assembly, of which James Graham was chosen speaker, met in the spring. His excellency spoke to them on the 21st of March, 1699.</P>
<P>As the late assembly was principally composed of Anti-Leis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erians, so this consisted, almost entirely, of the opposite party. The elections were attended with great outrage and tumult, and many applications made, relating to the re∣turns; but as Abraham Governeur, who had been secretary to Leisler, got returned for Orange county, and was very active in the house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Governeur married Misborne's widow.</NOTE>, all the petitions were rejected with∣out ceremony.</P>
<P>Among the principal acts, passed at this session, there was one for indemnifying those who were excepted out of the general pardon in 1691; another against pirates; one for the settlement of Milborne's estate; and another to raise fifteen hundred pounds, as a present to his lordship, and five hundred pounds for the lieutenant-governor, his
<PB N="111" REF="024800_0107_0FCD632FF45166F0"/>kinsman. Besides which, the revenue was continued for six years longer. A necessary law was also made for the regu∣lation of elections, containing the substance of the English statutes of 8 Hen. VI. chap. VII. and the 7 and 8 Will. III.</P>
<P>This assembly took, also, into consideration sundry ex∣travagant grants of land, which colonel Fletcher had made to several of his favourites. Among these, two grants to Delli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the Dutch minister, and one to Nicholas Bayard, were the most considerable. Dellius was one of the com∣missioners for Indian affairs, and had fradulently obtained the Indian deeds, according to which the patents had been granted. One of the grants included all the lands within twelve miles on the cast side of Hudson's river, and extend∣ed twenty miles in length, from the north bounds of Sa∣raghtoga. The second patent, which was granted to him in company with Pinhorne, Bancker, and others, contained all the lands, within two miles on each side of the Mohawks river, and along its banks to the extent of fifty miles, Bayard's grant was also for lands in that country, and very extravagant. Lord Bellamont, who justly thought these great patents, with the trifling annual reservation of a few skins, would impede the settlement of the country, as well as alienate the affections of our Indian allies, wifely pro∣cured recommendatory instructions from the lords justices, for vacating those patents, which was now regularly ac∣complished by a law, and Dellius thereby suspended from his ministerial function.</P>
<P>The earl having thus carried all his points at New-York, set out for Boston in June, where, after he had set∣tled his salary, and apprehended the pirate Kidd, he re∣turned here again in the fall.</P>
<P>The revenue being settled for six years, his lordship had no occasion to meet the assembly till the summer of the year 1700, and then indeed little else was done, than to pass a few laws. One for hanging every popish priest that came volun∣tarily into the province, which was occasioned by the great number of French jesuits, who were continually practising upon our Indians. By another, provision was made for erect∣ing a fort in the country of the Onondagas; but as this was repealed a few months after the king's providing for that purpose, so the former continues, as it forever ought, in full force to this day.</P>
<P>The earl was a man of art and polite manners, and being a mortal enemy to the French, as well as a lover of liberty,
<PB N="112" REF="024800_0108_0FCD6333DAFFAEA0"/>he would doubtless have been of considerable service to the colony; but he died here on the 5th of March in 1701, when he was but just become acquainted with the co∣lony.</P>
<P>The earl of Bellamont's death was the source of new troubles; for Nanfan, the lieutenant-governor, being then absent in Barbadoes, high disputes arose among the coun∣sellors, concerning the exercise of the powers of govern∣ment. Abraham de Peyster, Samuel Staats, Robert Walters, and Thomas Weaver, who sided with the party that ad∣hered to Leisler, insisted that the government was devolved upon the council, who had a right to act by a majority of voices; but colonel Smith contended that all the powers of the late governor were devolved upon him, as president, he being the eldest member of that board. Colonel Schuyler and Robert Livingston, who did not arrive in town till the 21st of March, joined mr. Smith, and refused to appear at the council-board, till near the middle of April. The assem∣bly, which was convened on the 2d of that month, were in equal perplexity; for they adjourned from day to day, waiting the issue of this rupture. Both parties continuing inflexible, those members, who opposed colonel Smith, sent down to the house a representation of the controversy, assigning a number of reasons for the sitting of the assem∣bly, which the house took into their consideration, and on the 16th of April resolved, that the execution of the earl's commission and instructions, in the absence of the lieute∣nant-governor, was the right of the council by majority of voices, and not of any single member of that board; and this was afterwards the opinion of the lords of trade. The disputes, nevertheless, continuing in the council, strenuously supported by mr. Livingston, the house, on the 19th of April, thought proper to adjourn themselves to the first Tuesday in June.</P>
<P>In this interval, on the 19th of May, John Nanfan, the lieutenant-governor, arrived, and settled the controversy, by taking upon himself the supreme command.</P>
<P>Upon mr. Nanfan's arrival, we had the agreeable news, that the king had given two thousand pounds sterling, for the defence of Albany and Schenectady, as well as five hundred pounds more for erecting a fort in the country of the Onondagas. And not long after an ordinance was issued, agreeable to the special direction of the lords of trade, for erecting a court of chancery, to sit the first Thursday in every month. By this ordinance the powers of the chan∣celor
<PB N="113" REF="024800_0109_0FCD6334D0BC0AD8"/>were vested in the governor and council, or any two of that board: commissions were also granted, appointing masters, clerks, and a register: so that this court was com∣pletely organized on the 2d of September, 1701.</P>
<P>Atwood, who was then chief justice or the supreme court, was now sworn of the council. Abraham de Peyster, and Robert Walters were his assistants on the bench; and the former was also made deputy auditor-general, under mr. Elaithwait. Sampson <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>helton Broughton was the attorney-general, and came into that office when Atwood took his seat on the bench, before the decease of lord Bel∣lamont. Both these had their commissions from England. The lieutenant-governor, and the major part of the board of council, together with the several officers above named, being strongly in the interest of the Leislerian party, it was not a little surprising, that mr. Nanfan dissolved the late assembly on the 1st of June last.</P>
<P>Great were the struggles at the ensuing elections, which, however, generally prevailed in savour of those who joined Leisler at the revolution; and hence, when the new assem∣bly met on the 19th of August 1701, Abraham Governeur was elected for their speaker. Dutchess was thought here∣tofore incapable of bearing the charge of a representation; but the people of that county, now animated by the heat of the times, sent Jacob Rutsen and Adrian Garretsen to re∣present them in assembly.</P>
<P>Mr. Nanfan, in his speech to the house, informs them of the memorable grant made to the crown, on the 19th of July, by the five nations, of a vast tract of land, to prevent the necessity of their submitting to the French in case of a war; and that his majesty had given out of his exchequer two thousand five hundred pounds sterling, for forts, and eight hundred pounds to be laid out in presents to the In∣dians; and that he had also settled a salary of three hun∣dred pounds on a chief justice, and one hundred and fifty pounds on the attorney-general, who were both now arrived here.</P>
<P>The fire of contention, which had lately appeared in the tumultuous elections, blazed out afresh in the house, Nicoll, the late counsellor, got himself elected for Suffolk, and was in hopes of being seated in the chair: but Abraham Governeur was chosen speaker. Several members contended, that he, being an alien, was unqualified for that station. To this it was answered, that he was in the province in the year 1683, at the time of passing an act to naturalize all the free inhabitants, professing the christian religion; and that
<PB N="114" REF="024800_0110_0FCD6336F73719F0"/>for this reason, the same objection against him had benn-over-ruled at the last assembly. In return for this attack, Governeur disputed Nicoll's right of sitting as a member of that house; and succeeded in a resolve, that he and mr. Wessels, who had been returned for Albany, were both un∣qualified according to the late act, they being neither of them residents in the respective counties for which they were citosen: This occasioned an imprudent secession of seven members, who had joined the interest of mr. Nicoll; which gave their adversaries an opportunity to expel them, and introduce others in their stead.</P>
<P>Among the first opposers of captain Leisler, none was more considerable than mr. Livingston. The measures of the convention at Albany were very much directed by his advice; and he was peculiarly obnoxious to his adversaries, because he was a man of sense and resolution, two qualifi∣cations rarely to be found united in one person at that day. Mr. Livingston's intimacy with the late earl, had till this time, been his defence, against the rage of the party which he had formerly opposed: but as that lord was now dead, and mr. Livingston's conduct in council, in favour of colonel Smith, had given fresh provocation to his enemies, they were fully bent upon his destruction. It was in execution of this scheme, that as soon as the disputed elections were over, the house proceeded to examine the state of the pub∣lic accounts, which they partly began at the late assembly.</P>
<P>The pretence was, that he refused to account for the public monies, he had formerly received out of the excise; upon which, a committee of both houses advised the passing a bill to confiscate his estate, unless he agreed to account by a certain day. But instead of this, an act was afterwards passed to oblige him to account for a sum amounting to near eighteen thousand pounds. While this matter was transacting, a new complaint was forged, and he was sum∣moned before another committee of both houses, relating to his procuring the five nations to signify their desire that he should be sent home to solicit their affairs. The crimi∣nality of this charge can be seen only through the partial optics, with which his enemies then scanned his behaviour. Besides, there was no evidence to support it, and therefore the committee required him to purge himself by his own oath. Mr. Livingston, who was better acquainted with English law and liberty, than to countenance a practice so odious, rejected the insolent demand with disdain; upon which the house, by advice of the committee, addressed the lieutenant-governor, to pray his majesty to remove
<PB N="115" REF="024800_0111_0FCD6337E85BF090"/>him from his office of secretary of Indian affairs, and that the governor, in the mean time, would suspend him from the exercise of his commission<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Livingston's reason for not accounting was truly unanswerable; his books and vouchers were taken into the hands of the government, and detained from him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was at this favourable conjuncture, that Jacob Leisler's petition to the king, and his majesty's letter to the late ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Bellamont, were laid before the assembly. Leister, dis∣pleased with the report of the lords of trade, that his fa∣ther and his brother Milborne had suffered according to law, laid his case before the parliament, and obtained an act to reverse the attainder. After which, he applied to the king, complaining that his father had disbursed about four thou∣sand pounds, in purchasing arms, and forwarding the re∣volution; in consequence of which he procured the follow∣ing letter to lord Bellamont, dated at Whitehall the 6th of February 1699/1700.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE king being moved upon the petition of mr. Ja∣cob Leisler, and having a gracious sense of his father's ser∣vices and sufferings, and the ill circumstances the petitioner is thereby reduced to, his majesty is pleased to direct, that the same be transmitted to your lordship, and that you re∣commend his case to the general assembly of New-York, being the only place, where he can be relieved, and the prayer of his petition complied with. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>your lordship's Most obedient and humble servant, JERSEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As soon as this letter and the petition were brought into the house, a thousand pounds were ordered to be levied for the benefit of mr. Leisler, as well as several sums for other persons, by a bill for paying the debts of the government; which, nevertheless, did not pass into a law, till the next sessions. Every thing that was done at this meeting of the assembly, which continued till the 18th of October, was un∣der the influence of a party spirit; and nothing can be a ful∣ler evidence of it, than an incorrect, impertinent address to his majesty, which was drawn up by the house, at the close of the session, and signed by fourteen of the members. It contains a tedious narrative of their proceedings, relating
<PB N="116" REF="024800_0112_0FCD63396D4BB018"/>to the disputed elections, and concludes with a little incense, to regale some of the then principal agents in the public affairs, in these words:</P>
<P>"This necessary account of ourselves and our unhappy divisions, which we hope the moderation of our lieutenant-governor, the wisdom and prudence of William Atwood, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> our chief justice, and Thomas Weaver, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> your ma∣jesty's collector and receiver-general, might have healed, we lay before your majesty with all humility, and deep sense of your majesty's goodness to us, lately expressed in sending over so excellent a person to be our chief justice."</P>
<P>The news of the king's having appointed lord Cornbury to succeed the earl of Bellamont, so strongly animated the hopes of the Anti-Leislerian party, that about the com∣mencement of the year 1702, Nicholas Bayard promoted se∣veral addresses to the king, the parliament, and lord Corn∣bury, which were subscribed at a tavern kept by one Hutch∣ins, an alderman of the city of New-York. In that to his majesty, they assure him, "That the late differences were not grounded on a regard to his interest, but the corrupt designs of those, who laid hold on an opportunity to en∣rich themselves by the spoils of their neighbours." The petition to the parliament says, that Leisler and his ad∣herents gained the fort at the revolution without any op∣position; that he oppressed and imprisoned the people without cause, plundered them of their goods, and com∣pelled them to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee their country, though they were well affected to the prince of Orange. That the earl of Bella∣mont appointed indigent sheriffs, who returned such mem∣bers to the assembly as were unduly elected, and in his lordship's esteem. That he suspended many from the board of council, who were faithful servants to the crown, introducing his own tools in their stead. Nay they denied the authority of the late assembly, and added, that the house had bribed both the lieutenant-governor and the chief justice; the one to pass their bills, and the other to defend the legality of their proceedings. A third address was prepared, to be presented to lord Cornbury, to congra∣tulate his arrival, as well to prepossess him in their favour, as to prejudice him against the opposite party.</P>
<P>Nothing could have a more natural tendency to excite the wrath of the lieutenant governor, and the revenge of the council and assembly, than the reflexions contained in those several addresses. Nanfan had no sooner received intelligence of them, than he summoned Hutchins to deliver them up to
<PB N="117" REF="024800_0113_0FCD633B1C2D5930"/>him, and upon his refusal committed him to jail, on the 19th of January. The next day Nicholas Bayard, Rip Van Dam, Philip French, and Thomas Wenham, hot with party zeal, sent an imprudent address to the lieute∣nant-governor, boldly justifying the legality of the ad∣dress, and demanding his discharge out of custody. I have before taken notice, that upon Sloughter's arrival in 1691, an act was passed, to recognize the right of king William and queen Mary to the sovereignty of this province. At the end of that law, a clause was added in these words, "That whatsoever person or persons shall by any manner of ways, or upon any pretence whatsoever, endeavour by force of arms or otherwise, to disturb the peace, good, and quiet of their majesties' government, as it is now established, shall be deemed and esteemed as rebels and traitors unto their majesties, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur the pains, penalties, and forfeitures, as the laws of England have for such offences made and pro∣vided." Under pretext of this law, which Bayard himself had been personally concerned in enacting, mr. Nanfan is∣sued a warrant for committing him to jail as a traitor, on the 21st of January; and lest the mob should interpose, a company of soldiers for a week after, constantly guarded the prison.</P>
<P>Through the uncertainty of the time of lord Cornbury's arrival, mr. Nanfan chose to bring the prisoner to his trial, as soon as possible; and for that purpose issued a commission of oyer and terminer, on the 12th of February, to William Atwood, the chief justice, and Abraham De Peyster and Robert Walters, who were the puisne judges of the su∣preme court; and not long after Bayard was arraigned, indicted, tried, and convicted of high treason. Several reasons were afterwards offered in arrest of judgment; but as the prisoner was unfortunately in the hands of an enraged party, Atwood over-ruled what was offered, and condemned him to death on the 16th of March. As the process of his trial has been long since printed in the state trials at large, I leave the reader to his own remarks upon the conduct of the judges, who are generally accused of par∣tiality.</P>
<P>Bayard applied to mr. Nanfan for a reprieve, till his majesty's pleasure might be known; and obtained it, not without great difficulty, nor till after a seeming confession of guilt was extorted. Hutchins, who was also convicted, was bailed upon the payment of forty pieces of eight to the sheriff: but Bayard, who refused to procure him the gift of a farm, of about fifteen hundred pounds value, was not released from his confinement, till after the arrival of
<PB N="118" REF="024800_0114_0FCD633DB97A4390"/>lord Cornbury, who not only gave his consent to an act for reversing the late attainders, but procured the queen's con∣firmation of it, upon their giving security, according to the advice of sir Edward Northey, not to bring any suits against those who were concerned in their prosecution; which the attorney-general thought proper, as the act ordained all the proceedings to be obliterated.</P>
<P>After these trials, Nanfan erected a court of exchequer, and again convened the assembly, who thanked him for his late measures, and passed an act to out-law Philip French, and Thomas Wenham, who absconded upon Bayard's com∣mitment; another to augment the number of representa∣tives, and several others, which were, all but one, after∣wards repealed by queen Anne. During this session, lord Cornbury being daily expected, the lieutenant-governor suspended mr. Livingston from his seat in council, and thus continued to abet Leisler's party, to the end of his admini∣stration.</P>
<P>Lord Cornbury's arrival quite opened a new scene. His father, the earl of Clarendon, adhered to the cause of the late abdicated king, and always refused the oaths both to king William and queen Anne. But the son recommended himself at the revolution, by appearing very early for the prince of Orange, being one of the first officers that desert∣ed king James's army. King William, in gratitude for his services, gave him a commission for this government, which upon the death of the king, was renewed by queen Anne, who at the same time, appointed him to the chief command of New-Jersey, the government of which the proprietors had lately surrendered into her hands. As lord Cornbury came to this province, in very indigent circumstances, hunt∣ed out of England by a host of hungry creditors, he was bent upon getting as much money, as he could squeeze out of the purses of an impoverished people. His talents were, perhaps, not superior to the most inconsiderable of his predecessors; but in his zeal for the church he was surpassed by none. With these bright qualifications he began his ad∣ministration on the 3d of May, 1702, assisted by a council consisting of the following members:

</LIST></P>
<P>His lordship, without the least disguise, espousing the
<PB N="119" REF="024800_0115_0FCD634086252690"/>Anti-Leislerian faction, Atwood, the chief justice, and Weaver, who acted in quality of solicitor-general, thought proper to retire from his frowns to Virginia, whence they sailed to England: the former concealing himself under the name of Jones, while the latter called himself Jackson. Colonel Heathcote and doctor Bridges succeeded in their places at the council board.</P>
<P>The following summer was remarkable for an uncommon mortality, which prevailed in the city of New-York, and makes a grand epoch among our inhabitants, distinguished by the "time of the great sickness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fever killed almost every patient seized with it, and was brought here in a vessel from St. Thomas in the West Indies, an island remarkable for contagious diseases.</NOTE>." On this occasion lord Cornbury had his residence and court at Jamaica, a plea∣sant village on Long-Island, distant about twelve miles from the city.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Jamaica consisted, at that time, partly of original Dutch planters, but mostly of New-England emigrants, encouraged to settle there, after the surrender, by the duke of York's conditions for plantations, one of which was in these words: "That every township should be obliged to pay their own ministers, according to such agreements as they should make with him; the minister being elected by the major part of the householders and in∣habitants of the town." These people had erected an edi∣fice for the worship of God, and enjoyed a handsome dona∣tion of a parsonage-house and glebe, for the use of their mi∣nister. After the ministry act was passed, by colonel Fletcher, in 1693, a few episcopalians crept into the town, and view∣ed the presbyterian church with a jealous eye. The town vote, in virtue of which the building had been erected, con∣tained no clause to prevent its being hereafter engrossed by any other sect. The episcopal party, who knew this, form∣ed a design of seizing the edifice for themselves, which they shortly after carried into execution, by entering the church between the morning and evening service, while the pres∣byterian minister and his congregation were in perfect security, unsuspicious of the zeal of their adversaries, and a fraudulent ejectment, on a day consecrated to sacred rest.</P>
<P>Great outrage ensued among the people; for the conten∣tion, being <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI> was animating and important. The original proprietors of the house tore up their seats,
<PB N="120" REF="024800_0116_0FCD634191714D30"/>and afterwards got the key and the possession of the church, which were shortly after again taken from them by force and violence. In these controversies the governor abetted the episcopal zealots, and harrassed the others by numberless prosecutions, heavy sines, and long imprisonments; thro' fear of which, many, who had been active in the dispute, fled out of the province. Lord Cornbury's noble descent and education should have prevented him from taking part in so ignominious a quarrel: but his lordship's sense of ho∣nour and justice was as weak and indelicate, as his bigotry was rampant and uncontroulable; and hence we find him guilty of an act complicated of a number of vices, which no man could have perpetrated without violence to the very slightest remains of generosity and justice. When his ex∣cellency retired to Jamaica, one Hubbard, the presbyterian minister, lived in the best house in the town. His lordship begged the loan of it for the use of his own family; and the clergyman put himself to no small inconvenience to fa∣vour the governor's request: but in return for the generous benefaction, his lordship perfidiously delivered the parson∣age-house into the hands of the episcopal party, and encou∣raged one Cardwel, the sheriff, a mean fellow, who after∣wards put an end to his own life, to seize upon the glebe, which he surveyed into lots, and farmed for the benefit of the episcopal church. These tyrannical measures justly in∣flamed the indignation of the injured sufferers, and that again the more embittered his lordship against them. They resented, and he prosecuted; nor did he confine his pious rage to the people of Jamaica. He detested all who were of the same denomination; nay, averse to every sect except his own, he insisted that neither the ministers nor school∣masters of the Dutch, the most numerous persuasion in the province, had a right to preach or instruct without his gu∣bernatorial licence: and some of them tamely submitted to his authoritative rule. A general account of his lordship's sin∣gular zeal, is preserved under the title of the Watch Tower, in a number of papers published in the New-York Weekly Mercury, for the year 1755.</P>
<P>While his excellency was exerting his bigotry, during the summer season, at Jamaica; the elections were carrying on, with great heat, for an assembly, which met him, at that village, in the fall. It consisted principally of the party which had been borne down by the earl of Bellamont and his kinsman; and hence we find Philip French, who had lately been out-lawed, was returned a representative for New-York, and William Nicoll elected into the speaker's
<PB N="121" REF="024800_0117_0FCD634493AEA688"/>chair. Several extracts from my lord's speech are proper to be laid before the reader, as a specimen of his temper and designs. "It was an extreme surprise to me (says his lord∣ship) to find this province, at my landing at New-York, in such a convulsion as must have unavoidably occasioned its ruin, if it had been suffered to go on a little longer. The many complaints that were brought to me, against the per∣sons I found here in power, sufficiently proved against them —and the miserable accounts I had of the condition of our frontiers—made me think it convenient to delay my meeting you in general assembly, till I could inform myself, in some measure, of the condition of this province, that I might be able to offer to your consideration, some few of those things, which will be necessary to be done forthwith, for the de∣fence of the country."</P>
<P>He then recommends their fortifying the port of New-York, and the frontiers; adding, that he found the soldiers naked and unarmed: after which he proposes a militia bill, the erection of public schools, and an examination of the provincial debts and accounts; and not only promises to make a faithful application of the monies to be raised, but that he would render them an account. The whole speech is sweetened with this gracious conclusion: "Now, gentlemen, I have no more to trouble you with, but to as∣sure you, in the name of the great queen of England, my mistress, that you may safely depend upon all the protec∣tion that good and faithful subjects can desire or expect, from a sovereign whose greatest delight is the welfare of her people, under whose auspicious reign we are sure to enjoy what no nation in the world dares claim but the sub∣jects of England; I mean, the free enjoyment of the best religion in the world, the full possession of all lawful liber∣ty, and the undisturbed enjoyment of our freeholds and properties. These are some of the many benefits which I take the inhabitants of this province to be well entitled to by the laws of England; and I am glad of this opportunity to assure you, that as long as I have the honour to serve the queen in the government of this province, those laws shall be put in execution, according to the intent with which they were made; that is, for the preservation and protecti∣on of the people, and not for their oppression. I heartily re∣joice to see, that the free choice of the people has fallen upon gentlemen, whose constant fidelity to the crown, and unwearied application to the good of their country, is so universally known."</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="024800_0118_0FCD6346C1189038"/>
The house echoed back an address of high compliment to his lordship, declaring, "That being deeply sensible of the misery and calamity the country lay under at his arrival, they were not sufficiently able to express the satisfaction they had, both in their relief and their deliverer."</P>
<P>Well pleased with a governor who headed their party, the assembly granted him all his requests; eighteen hun∣dred pounds were raised for the support of one hundred and eighty men, to defend the frontiers, besides two thou∣sand pounds more, as a present, towards defraying the ex∣penses of his voyage. The queen, by her letter of the 20th of April, in the next year, forbid any such donations for the future. It is observable, that though the county of Duchess had no representatives at this assembly, yet such was then the known indigence of that now populous and flourishing county, that but eighteen pounds were appor∣tioned for their quota of these levies.</P>
<P>Besides the acts above-mentioned, the house brought up a militia bill, and continued the revenue to the 1st of May, 1709; and a law passed to establish a grammar-school, ac∣cording to his lordship's recommendation. Besides the great harmony that subsisted between the governor and his as∣sembly, there was nothing remarkable, except two re∣solves against the court of chancery erected by mr. Nanfan, occasioned by a petition of several disappointed suitors, who were displeased with a decree. The resolutions were in these words: "That the setting up a court of equity in this colony, without consent of general assembly, is an in∣novation without any former precedent, inconvenient and contrary to the English law." And again: "That the court of chancery, as lately erected, and managed here, was and is unwarrantable, a great oppression to the subject, of pernicious example and consequence; that all proceed∣ings, orders, and decrees in the same, are, and of right ought to be, declared null and void; and that a bill be brought in, according to these two resolutions," which was done: but though his lordship was by no means disinclined to fix contempt on Nanfan's administration, yet, as this bill would diminish his own power, himself being the chancel∣lor, the matter was never moved farther, than to the order for the engrossment of the bill upon the second reading.</P>
<P>Though a war was proclaimed by England on the 4th of May, 1702, against France and Spain, yet as the five nations had entered into a treaty of neutrality with the French in Canada, this province, instead of being harrassed on its
<PB N="123" REF="024800_0119_0FCD6348EA91F6E8"/>borders by the enemy, carried on a trade very advantage∣ous to all those who were concerned in it. The governor, however, continued his solicitations for money, with unre∣mitted importunity, and by alarming the assembly, which met in April 1703, with his expectation of an attack by sea, fifteen hundred pounds were raised, under pretence of erecting two batteries at the Narrows, which, instead of being employed for that use, his lordship, notwithstanding the province had expended twenty two thousand pounds during the late peace, was pleased to appropriate to his pri∣vate advantage. But let us do him the justice to confess, that while he was robbing the public, he at the same time consented to several other laws for the emolument of the clergy.</P>
<P>Whether it was owing to the extraordinary sagacity of the house, or their presumption that his lordship was as lit∣tle to be trusted as any of his predecessors, that, after voting the above sum for the batteries, they added, that it should be "for no other use whatsoever," I leave the reader to determine. It is certain they now began to see the danger of throwing the public money into the hands of a receiver-general, appointed by the crown, from whence the gover∣nor, by his warrants, might draw it at his pleasure. To this cause we must assign it, that in an address to his lord∣ship, on the 19th of June, 1703, they "desire and insist, that some proper and sufficient person might be commis∣sioned treasurer, for the receiving and paying such monies now intended to be raised for the public use, as a means to obstruct misapplications for the future." Another address was sent home to the queen, complaining of the ill state of the revenue, through the frauds which had formerly been committed, the better to facilitate the important de∣sign of having a treasurer dependent on the assembly. The success of these measures will appear in the sequel.</P>
<P>Tho' our frontiers enjoyed the profoundest tranquillity all the next winter, and we had expended thirteen hundred pounds, in supporting one hundred fuzileers about Albany, besides the four independent companies in the pay of the crown, yet his excellency demanded provisions for one hun∣dred and fifty men, at the next meeting of the assembly, in April, 1704. The house having reason to suspect, that the several sums of eighteen and thirteen hundred pounds, lately raised for the public service, had been prodigally expend∣ed or embezzled, prudently declined any farther aids, till they were satisfied that no misapplication had been made. For this purpose they appointed a committee, who reported.
<PB N="124" REF="024800_0120_0FCD634AAB0D9370"/>that there was a balance of near a thousand pounds due <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the colony. His lordship, who had hitherto been treated with great complaisance, took offence at this parsimonious scrutiny, and ordered the assembly to attend him; when af∣ter the example of Fletcher, whom, abating that man's su∣perior activity, his lordship mostly resembled, he made an angry speech, in which he charges them with innovations never attempted by their predecessors, and hopes they would not force him to exert "certain powers" vested in him by the queen. But what he more particularly took notice of, was their insisting in several late bills, upon the title of "general assembly," and a saving of the "rights of the house," in a resolve agreeing to an amendment for prevent∣ing delay; with respect to which, his lordship has these words: "I know of no right that you have as an assembly, but such as the queen is pleased to allow you." As to the vote, by which they found a balance due to the colony, of nine hundred and thirteen pounds, fifteen shillings, "it is true (says his lordship) the queen is pleased to command me in her instructions, to permit the assembly, from time to time, to view and examine the accounts of money, or va∣lue of money, disposed by virtue of the laws made by them: but you can in no wise meddle with that money; but if you find any misapplication of any of that money, you ought to acquaint me with it, that I may take care to see those mistakes rectified, which I shall certainly do."</P>
<P>The house bore these rebukes with the utmost passiveness, contenting themselves with little else than a general com∣plaint of the deficiency of the revenue, which became the subject of their particular consideration in the fall. The governor, on the one hand, then proposed an additional duty of ten per cent. on certain goods, not immediately im∣ported from Europe, to which the assembly, on the other, were utterly averse, and as soon as they resolved against it, the very printer, clerk, and door-keeper, were denied the payment of their salaries. Several other demands being made for the public debts, the house resolved to address his lordship for an exact account of the revenue, which, to∣gether with their refusal, to admit the council's amendment to a money bill, gave him such high provocation, that he was induced to dissolve an assembly, whose prodigal liber∣ality had justly exposed them to the resentment of the peo∣ple. The new assembly, which met on the 14th of June, 1705, neglected the affair of the revenue and the additional duty, though his lordship strongly recommended them both. Among the principal acts passed at this meeting, is that for
<PB N="125" REF="024800_0121_0FCD634C4B407288"/>the benefit of the clergy, who were entitled to the salaries formerly established by colonel Fletcher; which, though less than his lordship recommended, was doubtless a grateful offering to his unceasing zeal for the church, manifested in a part of his speech at the opening of the session, in these words: "The difficulties, which some very worthy minis∣ters of the church of England have met with, in getting the maintenance settled upon them, by an act of the general assembly of this province, passed in the year 1693, moves me to propose to you the passing an act explanatory of the forementioned act, that those worthy good men who have ventured to come so far for the service of God in his church, and the good and edification of the people, to the salvation of their souls, may not for the future be vexed, as some of them have been; but may enjoy in quiet, that maintenance, which was by a law provided for them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The majority of our people are of a contrary opinion, if my lord thought the establishment was designed only for the episcopal clergy.</NOTE>. I farther re∣commend to you, the passing an act to provide for the main∣tenance of some ministers, in some of the towns at the east end of Long-Island, where I don't find any provision has been yet made for propagating religion."</P>
<P>Our harbour being wholly unfortified, a French priva∣teer actually entered it in 1705, and put the inhabitants into great consternation. The assembly, at their session in June, the next year, were not disinclined, through the im∣portunity of the people, to put the city in a better posture of defence for the future; but being fully convinced, by his lordship's embezzlement of 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> formerly raised for two batteries at the narrows, and near 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> levied for the protection of the frontiers, that he was no more to be trust∣ed with public monies, offered a bill for raising 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for fortifications, appointing that sum to be deposited in the hands of a private person of their own nomination; but his excellency did not pass it till their next meeting in the fall, when he informed them that he had received the queen's commands, "to permit the general assembly to name their own treasurer, when they raised extraordinary supplies for particular uses, and which are no part of the standing and constant revenue; the treasurer being accountable to the three branches of the legislature, and the governor always acquainted with the occasion of issuing such warrants".</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="024800_0122_0FCD634D8F580A20"/>
His lordship's renewing the proposal of raising fortifi∣cations at the Narrows, which he had himself hitherto scan∣dalously prevented, is a proof of his excessive effrontery and contempt of the people: and the neglect of the house, to take the least notice, either of that matter, or the revenue, occasioned another dissolution.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the transactions of the new assembly, which did not meet till the year 1708, it will not be im∣proper to lay before the reader, the account of a memor∣able proof of that persecuting spirit, which influenced lord Cornbury's whole administration.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the city of New-York consisted, at this time, of Dutch Calvinists, upon the plan of the church of Holland; French refugees on the Geneva model; a few English episcopalians; and a still smaller number of Eng∣lish and Irish presbyterians; who, having neither a minister nor a church, used to assemble themselves, every Sunday, at a private house, for the worship of God. Such were their circumstances, when Francis M'Kemie and John Hampton, two presbyterian ministers, arrived here in January, 1707. As soon as lord Cornbury, who hated the whole persuasion, heard that the Dutch had consented to M'Kemie's preach∣ing in their church, he arbitrarily forbid it; so that the public worship, on the next sabbath, was performed, with open doors, at a private house. Mr. Hampton preached, the same day, at the presbyterian church in New-Town, distant a few miles from the city. At that village both these ministers were two or three days after apprehended, by Cardwel, the sheriff, pursuant to his lordship's warrant, for preaching without his licence. From hence they were led in triumph a circuit of several miles through Jamaica to New-York. They appeared before his lordship with an un∣daunted courage, and had a conference with him, in which it is difficult to determine, whether my lord excelled in the character of a savage bigot, or an ill-mannerly tyrant. The ministers were no lawyers, or they would not have founded their justification on the supposed extent of the English act of toleration. They knew not that the ecclesi∣astical statutes had no relation to this colony; and that its religious state consisted in a perfect parity between protes∣tants of all denominations. They erroneously supposed, that all the penal laws extended to this province, and relied, for their defence, on the toleration, offering testimonials of their having complied with the act of parliament in Virgi∣nia and Maryland, and promised to certify the house, in which M'Kemie had preached, to the next sessions. His lord∣ship's
<PB N="127" REF="024800_0123_0FCD634F0F6E2E18"/>discourse with them was the more ridiculous, because he had Bickley, the attorney-general, to assist him. Against the extension of the statute, they insisted, that the penal laws were limited to England, and so also the toleration act, because the sole intent of it was to take away the penalties formerly established. But grant the position, and the con∣sequence they drew from it, argues that my lord and mr. at∣torney were either very weak, or influenced by evil designs. If the penal laws did not extend to the plantations, then the prisoners were innocent; for where there is no law, there can be no transgression; but according to these in∣comparable sages, if the penal laws and the toleration were restricted to the realm of England, as they contended, then the poor clergymen, for preaching without his licence, were guilty of a heinous crime, against his private, unpub∣lished instructions; and for this cause he issued an informal precept to the sheriff of New-York, for their commitment to jail, till further orders. They continued in consinement, through the absence of Mompesson, the chief justice, who was in New-Jersey, six weeks and four days; but were then brought before him, by writ of <HI>habeas corpus.</HI> Mom∣pesson being a man of learning in his profession, and his lordship now apprised of the illegality of his first warrant, issued another, on the very day of the test of the writ, in which he virtually contradicts what he had before insisted on, at his conference with the prisoners. For according to this, they were imprisoned for preaching without being qualified as the toleration act required, though they had of∣fered themselves to the sessions during their imprisonment. They were then bailed to the next supreme court, which began a few days after. Great pains were taken to secure a grand jury for the purpose, and among those who found the indictment, to their shame be it remembered, were several Dutch and French protestants.</P>
<P>Mr. M'Kemie returned to New-York, from Virginia, in June; and was now come to his trial on the indictment found at the last court: As to mr. Hampton, he was discharg∣ed, no evidence being offered to the grand jury against him.</P>
<P>Bickley, the attorney general, managed the prosecution in the name of the queen; Reignere, Nicoll, and Jamison appeared for the defendant. The trial was held on the 6th of June, and being a cause of great expectation, a nu∣merous audience attended. Roger Mompesson sat on the bench as chief justice, with Robert Milward and Thomas Wenham, for his assistants. The indictment was, in sub∣stance, that Francis M'Kemie, pretending himself to be a
<PB N="128" REF="024800_0124_0FCD6350B1E19B88"/>protestant dissenting minister, contemning and endeavour∣ing to subvert the queen's ecclesiastical supremacy, unlaw∣fully preached without the governor's licence first ob∣tained, in derogation of the royal authority and preroga∣tive: that he used other rites and ceremonies, than those con∣tained in the common-prayer book. And lastly, that being unqualified by law to preach, he nevertheless did preach at an illegal conventicle: and both these last charges were laid to be contrary to the form of the English statutes. For it seems that mr. attorney was now of opinion, that the penal laws did extend to the American plantations, though his sentiments were the very reverse at the first debate be∣fore his excellency: but Bickley was rather remarkable for a voluble tongue, than a penetrating head, or much learning. To support this prosecution, he endeavoured to prove the queen's ecclesiastical supremacy in the colonies, and that it was delegated to her noble cousin, the governor; and hence he was of opinion, that his lordship's instructi∣ons relating to church matters, had the force of a law. He, in the next place, contended for the extension of the sta∣tutes of uniformity, and, upon the whole, was pleased to say, that he did not doubt the jury would find a verdict for the queen. Reignere, for the defendant, insisted, that preaching was no crime by the common law; that the sta∣tutes of uniformity, and the act of toleration did not ex∣tend here; and that the governor's instructions were not laws. Nicoll spoke to the same purpose, and so did David Jamison, but M'Kemie concluded the whole defence in a speech, which sets his capacity in a very advantageous light. The reader may see it in the narrative of this trial, which was first published at the time, and since reprinted at New-York in the year 1755. The chief justice, in his charge, ad∣vised a special verdict, but the jury found no difficulty to acquit the defendant, who, through the shameful parti∣ality of the court, was not discharged from his recogni∣zance, till they had illegally extorted all the fees of his prosecution, which, together with his expenses, amounted to eighty-three pounds seven shillings and six pence.</P>
<P>Lord Cornbury was now daily losing the favour of the people. The friends of Leisler had him in the utmost abhor∣rence from the beginning; and being all spies upon his conduct, it was impossible for his lordship to commit the smallest crime unnoticed. His persecution of the presby∣terians very early increased the number of his enemies. The Dutch, too, were fearful of his religious rage against them, as he disputed their right to call and settle ministers,
<PB N="129" REF="024800_0125_0FCD63522A967358"/>or even schoolmasters, without his special licence. His ex∣cessive avarice, his embezzlement of the public money, and his sordid refusal to pay his private debts, bore so heavily upon his reputation, that it was impossible for his adherents, either to support him, or themselves, against the general opposition. Such being the temper of the people, his lord∣ship did not succeed according to his wishes in the new as∣sembly, which met on the 19th of August, 1708. The mem∣bers were all against him, and William Nicoll was again chosen speaker.</P>
<P>Among the several things recommended to their consider∣ation, the affair of the revenue, which was to expire in May following, and the propriety of making presents to the In∣dians, were the chief. The house were not insensible of the importance of the Indian interest, and of the infinite arts of the French to seduce them from our alliance: but suspi∣cious that his lordship, who heretofore had given himself little concern about that matter, was seeking a fresh oppor∣tunity to defraud the public, they desired him to give them a list of the articles of which the presents were to consist, together with an estimate of the charge, before they would provide for that donation.</P>
<P>With respect to the revenue, his lordship was not so suc∣cessful, for the assembly resolutely refused to continue it; tho' they consented to an act to discharge him from a con∣tract of 250<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards, which he had made with one Hanson for the public service. Thomas Byerly was at that time, collector and receiver-general; and by pretending that the treasury was exhausted, the debts of the govern∣ment were unpaid. This gave rise to many petitions to the assembly to make provision for their discharge. Colonel Schuyler, who had expended large sums on the public cre∣dit, was among the principal sufferers, and joined with se∣veral others in an application to the house, that Byerly might be compelled to account. The disputes, relating to this mat∣ter, took up a considerable part of the session, and were litigated with great heat. Upon the whole, an act was passed for refunding 700<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which had been misapplied.</P>
<P>The resolutions of the committee of grievances, approved by the house, show the general objections of the people to his lordship's administration. These were made at the be∣ginning of the session; and yet we find this haughty lord subdued by the opposition against him, and so dispirited thro' indigence, and the incessant solicitations of his credi∣tors, that he not only omitted to justify himself, but to show even an impotent resentment. For after all the censures of
<PB N="130" REF="024800_0126_0FCD63538C8AF000"/>the house, he tamely thanked them, for passing the bill to discharge him from a small debt, which they could not, in justice, have refused. The resolutions were in these words:</P>
<P>"Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the appointing coroners in this colony, without their being chosen by the people, is a grievance, and contrary to law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See lord Bacon's works, fol. edit. 2 vol. 152. and yet the coroners in every county are still appointed by the governor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"Resolved, That it is, and always has been, the un∣questionable right of every freeman in this colony, that he hath a perfect and entire property in his goods and es∣tate.</P>
<P>"Resolved, That the imposing and levying of any mo∣nies upon her majesty's subjects of this colony, under any pretence or colour whatsoever, without consent in general assembly, is a grievance, and a violation of the people's pro∣perty.</P>
<P>"Resolved, That for any officer whatsoever, to extort from the people, extravagant and unlimited fees, or any money whatsoever, not positively established and regulated by consent in general assembly, is unreasonable and unlaw∣ful, a great grievance, and tending to the utter destruction of all property in this plantation.</P>
<P>"Resolved, That the erecting a court of equity, with∣out consent in general assembly, is contrary to law, without precedent, and of dangerous consequence to the liberty and property of the subjects.</P>
<P>"Resolved, That the raising of money for the govern∣ment, or other necessary charge, by any tax, impost, or bur∣den on goods imported, or exported,—or any clog, or hindrance, on traffic or commerce,—is sound by experience to be the expulsion of many, and the impoverishing of the rest of the planters, freeholders, and inhabitants of this co∣lony; of most pernicious consequence, which, if continued, will unavoidably prove the ruin of the colony.</P>
<P>"Resolved, That the excessive sums of money screwed from masters of vessels trading here under the notion of port-charges, visiting the said vessels by supernumerary of∣ficers, and taking extraordinary fees, is the great discourage∣ment of trade and strangers coming among us, beyond the precedent of any other port, and without colour of law.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="024800_0127_0FCD63562DB9BFE0"/>
"Resolved, That the compelling any man upon trial by a jury, or otherwise, to pay any fees for his prosecution, or any thing whatsoever, unless the fees of the officers whom he employs for his necessary defence, is a great grievance, and contrary to justice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This had a special relation to the late prosecution of mr. M'Kemie.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Lord Corubury was no less obnoxions to the people of New-Jersey, than to those of New-York. The assembly of that province, impatient of his tyranny, drew up a com∣plaint against him, which they sent home to the queen.</P>
<P>Her majesty graciously listened to the cries of her injured subjects; divested him of his power, and appointed lord Lovelace in his stead; declaring that she would not coun∣tenance her nearest relations in oppressing her people.</P>
<P>As soon as my lord was superseded, his creditors threw him into the custody of the sheriff of New-York; and he re∣mained here till the death of his father, when succeeding to the earldom of Clarendon, he returned to England.</P>
<P>We never had a governor so universally detested, nor any who so richly deserved the public abhorrence. In spite of his noble descent, his behaviour was trifling, mean, and extra∣vagant.</P>
<P>It was not uncommon for him to dress himself in a wo∣man's habit, and then to patrole the fort in which he resided. Such freaks of low humour exposed him to the universal contempt of the people; but their indignation was kindled by his despotic rule, savage bigotry, insatiable avarice, and injustice, not only to the public, but even his private credi∣tors. For he left some of the lowest tradesmen in his em∣ployment unsatisfied in their just demands.</P>
<P>John lord Lovelace, baron of Hurley, was appointed to this government, in the spring, 1708, but did not arrive here till the 18th of December following. Lord Cornbury's oppressive, mean administration had long made the people very desirous of a change; and therefore his successor was re∣ceived with universal joy. Having dissolved the general as∣sembly, soon after his accession to the government, he con∣vened a new one on the 5th of April, 1709, which, consist∣ing of members of the same interest with the last, re-elected William Nicoll, the former speaker, into the chair. His lord∣ship told them, at the beginning of the session. "That he had brought with him large supplies of soldiers and stores of
<PB N="132" REF="024800_0128_0FCD63581C7CF418"/>war as well as presents for the Indians," than which nothing could be more agreeable to the people. He lamented the great∣ness of the provincial debts, and the decay of public credit; but still recommended their raising a revenue, for the same term with that established by the act in the 11th year of the last reign. He also pressed the discharge of the debts of the government, and their examination of the public accounts, "that it may be known (says he) what this debt is, and that it may appear hereafter to all the world that it was not con∣tracted in my time." This oblique reflexion upon his pre∣decessor, who was now ignominiously imprisoned by his creditors, was displeasing to no body.</P>
<P>Tho' the assembly, in their answer, heartily congratu∣lated his lordship's arrival, and thanked the queen for her care of the province, yet they sufficiently intimated their disinclination to raise the revenue, which the governor had requested. "Our earnest wishes (to use the words of the address) are, that suitable measures may be taken, to en∣courage the few inhabitants left, to stay in it, and others to come. The just freedom enjoyed by our neighbours, by the tender indulgence of the government, has extremely drain∣ed and exhausted us both of people and stock; whilst a dif∣ferent treatment, the wrong methods too long taken, and severities practised here, have averted and deterred the usual part of mankind from settling and coming hitherto." Towards the close, they assure him, "That as the begin∣ning of his government gave them a delightful prospect of tranquillity, so they were come with minds prepared to con∣sult the good of the country and his satisfaction."</P>
<P>The principal matter, which engaged the attention of the assembly, was the affair of the revenue. Lord Cornbury's conduct had rendered them utterly averse to a permanent support for the future; and yet they were unwilling to quarrel with the new governor. They however, at last, a∣greed on the 5th of May, to raise 2500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to defray the charges of the government to the 1st of May ensuing; 1600<ABBR>l.</ABBR> of which was voted to his excellency, and the remaining sums towards a supply of firewood and candles to the several forts in New-York, Albany, and Schenectady; and for pay∣ment of small salaries to the printer, clerk of the council, and Indian interpreter.</P>
<P>This new project of providing, annually, for the support of government, was contrived to prevent the mischiefs, to which the long revenues had formerly exposed us. But as it rendered the governor, and all the other servants of the crown dependent upon the assembly, a rupture, between
<PB N="133" REF="024800_0129_0FCD63599893AFE0"/>the several branches of the legislature, would doubtless have ensued: but the very day, in which the vote passed the house, his lordship died of a disorder contracted in crossing the ferry at his first arrival in the city of New-York. His lady continued here, long after his death, soliciting for the sum voted to her husband; but though the queen interposed, by a letter, in her behalf, nothing was allowed till several years afterwards.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NEW-YORK. <HI>PART IV.</HI> From the Canada expedition in <HI>1709,</HI> to the arrival of governor Burnet.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Lovelace being dead, the chief command devolv∣ed upon Richard Ingolsby, the lieutenant-governor, the same who had exercised the government several years before, upon the decease of colonel Sloughter. His short ad∣ministration is remarkable, not for his extraordinary talents, for he was a heavy man, but for a second fruitless attempt against Canada. Colonel Vetch, who had been, several years before, at Quebec, and sounded the river of St. Lawrence, was the first projector of this enterprise. The ministry ap∣proved of it, and Vetch arrived in Boston, and prevailed upon the New-England colonies to join in the scheme. After that, he came to New-York, and concerted the plan of o∣perations with Francis Nicholson, formerly our lieutenant-governor, who, at the request of Ingolsby, the council, the assembly, Gurdon Saitonstal, the governor of Connecticut, and Charles Gookin, lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, accepted the chief command of the provincial forces, in∣tended to penetrate into Canada, by the way of lake Cham∣plain. Impoverished as we were, the assembly joined heartily in the enterprise. It was at this juncture, our first act for issuing bills of credit was passed; an expedient without which we could not have contributed to the expedition, the trea∣sury
<PB N="136" REF="024800_0131_0FCD63600F5F1AB8"/>being then totally exhausted. Universal joy now bright∣ened every man's countenance, because all expected the complete reduction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anada before the ensuing fail. Big with the pleasing p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospect of an event, which would put a period to all the ravages o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an encroaching, merciless enemy, extend the British empire, and augment our trade, we exerted ourselves to the utmost▪ for the success of the expedition. As soon as the design was made known to the house, twenty ship and house carpenters were impressed into the service for building batteans. Commissioners also were appointed to purchase provisions and other necessa∣ries, and empowered to break open houses for that purpose, and to impress men, vessels, horses, and waggons, for trans∣porting the stores. Four hundred and eighty seven men, besides the independent companies, were raised and dis∣patched to Albany, by the 27th of June; from whence they advanced, with the main body, to the Wood Creek. Three forts were built there, besides many block-houses and stores for the provisions, which were transported with great dis∣patch. The province of New-York (all things considered) has the merit of having contributed more than any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neighbours towards this expedition. Pennsylvania ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> no kind of aid; and New-Jersey was only at the expense of 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> One hundred batteans, as many birch canoes, and two of the forts, were built entirely, and the other fort, for the most part, at the charge of this government. All the provisions and stores for the army, were transported at our expense; and besides our quota of volunteers and the in∣dependent companies, we procured and maintained six hundred Indians, and victualled a thousand of their wives and children at Albany, during the campaign.</P>
<P>Having thus put ourselves to the expense of above twenty thousand pounds towards this enterprise, the delay of the arrival of the flee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spread a general discontent through the country; and ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the fall, the assembly addressed the lieutenant-governor, to recall our forces from the camp. Vetch and Nicholson soon after broke up the campaign, and retired to New-Port in Rhode-Island, where there was a congress of governors. Ingolsby, who was invited to it, did not appear, in compliance with the inclination of the assembly, who, incensed at the public disappointment, har∣boured great jealousies of all the first promoters of the de∣sign. As soon, therefore, as lord Sunde land's letters, which arrived here on the 21st of October, were laid before the house, they resolved to send an address to the queen, to lay before he a true account of the manner, in which this pro∣vince exerted itself in the late undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="024800_0132_0FCD636291806090"/>
Had this expedition been vigorously carried on, doubt∣less it would have succeeded. The public affairs at home were conducted by a wise ministry. The allied army tri∣umphed in repeated successes in Flanders; and the court of France was in no condition to give assistance to so distant a colony as Canada. The Indians of the five nations were engaged, through the indefatigable solicitations of colonel Schuyler, to join heartily in the attempt: and the eastern colonies had nothing to fear from the Ouwenagungas; be∣cause those Indians had, a little before, concluded a peace with the confederates. In America, every thing was ripe for the attack. At home, lord Sunderland, the secretary of state, had proceeded so far, as to dispatch orders to the queen's ships at Boston, to hold themselves in readiness, and the British troops were upon the point of their embark∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion. At this juncture, the news arrived of the descat of the Portuguese, which reducing our allies to great streights, the forces intended for the American adventure were then ordered to their assistance, and the thoughts of the ministry entirely diverted from the Canada expedition.</P>
<P>As we had not a man in this province, who had more extended views of the importance of driving the French out of Canada, than colonel Schuyler, so neither did any per∣son more heartily engage in the late expedition. To pre∣serve the friendship of the five nations, without which it would be impossible to prevent our frontiers from becom∣ing a field of blood, he studied all the arts of insinuating himself into their favour. He gave them all possible encour∣agement and assistance, and very much impaired his own fortune, by his liberality to their chiefs. They never came to Albany, but they resorted to his house, and even dined at his table; and by this means, he obtained an ascendency over them, which was attended with very good consequen∣ces to the province; for he could always, in a great degree, obviate or e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dicate the prejudices and jealousies, by which the French jesuits were incessantly labouring to debauch their fidelity.</P>
<P>Impressed with a strong sense of the necessity of some vi∣gorous measures against the French, colonel Schuyler was extremely discontented at the late disappointment; and re∣solved to make a voyage to England at his private expense, the better to inculcate on the ministry, the absolute neces∣sity of reducing Canada to the crown of Great-Britain. For that purpose, he proposed to carry home with him five Indian chiefs. The house no sooner heard of his design, than they came to a resolution, which, in justice to
<PB N="138" REF="024800_0133_0FCD63640DD55220"/>his distinguished merit, I ought not to suppress. It was this:</P>
<P>"Resolved, nemine contradicento, that the humble ad∣dress of the lieutenat-governor, council, and general assem∣bly of this colony to the queen, representing the present state of this plantation, be committed to his charge and care, to be presented by himself to her sacred majesty; he being a person, who, not only in the last war, when he commanded the forces of this colony in chief at Canada, but also in the present, has performed faithful services, to this and the neighbouring colonies; and behaved himself in the offices, with which he has been entrusted, with good reputation, and the general satisfaction of the people in these parts."</P>
<P>The arrival of the five sachems in England, made a great bruit through the whole kingdom. The mob followed wherever they went, and small cuts of them were sold among the people. The court was at that time in mourning for the death of the prince of Denmark: these American kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This title is commonly bestowed on the sachems, though the Indians have no such dignity or office among them.</NOTE> were therefore dressed in black underclothes, after the English manner; but instead of a blanket, they had each a scarlet-in-grain cloth mantle, edged with gold, thrown over all their other garments. This dress was direct∣ed by the dressers of the playhouse, and given by the queen, who was advised to make a show of them. A more than or∣dinary solemnity attended the audience they had of her majesty. Sir Charles Cotterel conducted them, in two coaches, to St. James's; and the lord chamberlain introduced them into the royal presence. Their speech, on the 19th of April, 1710, is preserved by Oldmixon, and was in these words:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GREAT QUEEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have undertaken a long voyage, which none of our predecessors could be prevailed upon to undertake, to see our great queen, and relate to her those things, which we thought absolutely necessary for the good of her, and us her allies, on the other side the water.</P>
<P>We doubt not but our great queen has been acquainted with our long and tedious war, in conjunction with her chil∣dren, against her enemies the French: and that we have been as a strong wall for their security, even to the loss of our best men. We were mightily rejoiced, when we heard
<PB N="139" REF="024800_0134_0FCD6367F16C1598"/>our great queen had resolved to send an army to reduce Canada; and immediately, in token of friendship, we hung up the kettle and took up the hatchet, and, with one con∣sent, assisted colonel Nicholson in making preparations on this side the lake: but, at length, we were told our great queen, by some important affairs, was prevented in her de∣sign, at present, which made us sorrowful, lest the French, who had hitherto dreaded us, should now think us unable to make war against them. The reduction of Canada is of great weight to our free hunting; so that if our great queen should not be mindful of us, we must, with our families, forsake our country, and seek other habitations, or stand neuter, either of which will be much against our incli∣nations.</P>

<P>While colonel Schuyler was at the British court, captain Ingolsby was displaced, and Gerardus Beekman exercised the powers of government, from the 10th of April, 1710, till the arrival of brigadier Hunter, on the 14th of June following. The council then present were,

<P>Hunter was a native of Scotland, and, when a boy, put apprentice to an apothecary. He left his master, and went into the army; and being a man of wit and personal beau∣ty, recommended himself to lady Hay, whom he after∣wards married. In the year 1707, he was appointed lieu∣tenant-governor of Virginia, but being taken by the French in his voyage to that colony, he was carried into France, and upon his return to England, appointed to succeed lord Lovelace in the government of this and the province of New-Jersey. Dean Swift's letter to him, during his captivity, shows that he had the honour of an intimacy with mr. Addi∣son and others, who were distinguished for their good sense and learning; and perhaps it was by their interest, he was advanced to this profitable place.</P>
<P>Governor Hunter brought over with him near three thou∣sand palatines, who, the year before, fled to England from the rage of persecution in Germany. Many of these people seated themselves in the city of New-York, where they built a Lutheran church, which is now in a declining condition.
<PB N="140" REF="024800_0135_0FCD6369CB21A3D0"/>Others settled on a tract of several thousand acres, in the manor of Livingston. Their village there, called the camp, is one of the pleasantest situations on Hudson's river: right opposite, on the west bank, are many other families of them. Some went into Pennsylvania, and by the favourable ac∣counts of the country, which they transmitted to Ger∣many, were instrumental to the transmigration of many thousands of their countrymen into that province. Queen Anne's liberality to these people, was not more beneficial to them, than serviceable to this colony. They have behav∣ed themselves peaceably, and lived with great industry. Many are rich. all are protestants, and well affected to the government. The same must be said of those who have lately settled amongst us, and planted the lands westward of Al∣bany. We have not the least ground for jealousy with res∣pect to them. Amongst us they are few in number, com∣pared to those in Pennsylvania. There they are too numer∣ous, to be soon assimilated to a new constitution. They re∣tain all the manners and principles which prevail in their native country, and, as many of them are papists, some are not without their fears, that, sooner or later, they will be∣come dangerous to our colonies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The surprising importation of Germans into that colo∣ny, gave rise to the scheme of dispensing English clergy∣men and schoolmasters among them. The project is found∣ed on principles of sound policy. If a political mission a∣mong the Indians had been seasonably encouraged, the pro∣vince of Pennsylvania might have escaped all that shocking devastation, which ensued the fatal defeat of general Brad∣dock's army on the 9th of July, 1755; and would, perhaps, have prevented even the erection of fort Quesne, which has already cost the nation so much blood and treasure.</NOTE></P>
<P>The late attempt to attack Canada proving abortive, ex∣posed us to consequences equally calamitous, dreaded, and foreseen. While the preparations were making to invade it, the French exerted themselves in cajoling their Indian al∣lies to assist in the repulse, and as soon as the scheme drop∣ped, numerous parties were sent out to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rass the English frontiers. These irruptions were, principally, made on the northern parts of New-England, where the most savage cruel∣ties were daily committed. New-York had, indeed, hither∣to escaped, being covered by the Indians of the five nations; but the danger we were in, induced governor Hunter, soon after his arrival, to make a voyage to Albany, where he met
<PB N="141" REF="024800_0136_0FCD636C521257C0"/>the confederate chiefs, and renewed the old covenant. While there, he was strongly solicited, by the New-England governments, to engage our Indians in a war with those who were daily ravaging their borders: but he prudently declined a measure, which might have exposed his own province to a general deva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cation. A treaty of neutrality sub∣sisted, at that time, between the confederates and the Canada French and their Indians; which, depending upon the faith of lawless savages, was, at best, but precarious, and yet the only security we had for the peare of our borders. A rup∣ture between them would have involved us in a scene of mi∣sery, at a time, of all others, most unseasonable. However the people of New-England might censure the governor, it was a proof of wisdom to refuse their request. For besides a want of men and arms to desend us, our forts were fallen down, and the treasury exhausted.</P>
<P>The new assembly met, at New-York, ou the 1st of Sep∣tember. Mr. Nicoll, the speaker, mr. Livingston, mr. de Lancey, and colonel Morris, were the members most dis∣tinguished for their activity in the house. Mr. de Lancey was a protestant refugee, a native of Caen in Normandy; and by marrying a daughter of mr. Courtlandt, connected with a family, then, perhaps, the most opulent and exten∣sive of any in the province. He was an eminent merchant, and, by a successful trade, had amassed a very considerable fortune. But of all these colonel Morris had the greatest in∣fluence on our public affairs. He was a man of letters, and though a little whimsical in his temper, was grave in his manners, and of penetrating parts. Being excessively fond of the society of men of sense and reading, he was never wearied at a sitting, till the spirits of the whole company were dissipated. From his infancy, he had lived in a man∣ner best adapted to teach him the nature of man, and to fortify his mind for the vicissitudes of life. He very early lost both his father and mother, and fell under the patron∣age of his uncle, formerly an officer, of very considerable rank in Cromwell's army; who, after the restoration, dis∣guised himself under the profession of quakerism, and set∣tled on a fine farm, within a few miles of the city, called, after his own name, Morrisania. Being a boy of strong pas∣sions, (the general indications of a fruitful genius,) he gave frequent offence to his uncle, and, on one of these occasi∣ons, through fear of his resentment, strolled away into Vir∣ginia, and thence to Jamaica in the West-Indies, where, to support himself, he set up for a scrivener. After several years spent in this vagabond life, he returned again to bi
<PB N="142" REF="024800_0137_0FCD636DCE3E83D0"/>uncle, who received the young prodigal with joy; and, to reduce him to regularity, brought about his marriage with a daughter of mr. Graham, a fine lady, with whom he lived above fifty years, in the possession of every enjoyment, which good sense and polite manners in a woman could af∣for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. The greatest part of his life, before the arrival of mr. Hunter, was spent in New-Jersey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was one of the council in that province, and a judge of the supreme court there, in 1692. Upon the surrender of the government to queen Anne, in 1702, he was named to be governor of the colony; but the appointment was changed in favour of lord Cornbury, the queen's cousin.</NOTE>, where he signalized himself in the service both of the proprietors and the assem∣bly. The latter employed him to draw up their complaint against my lord Cornbury, and he was made the bearer of it to the queen. Though he was indolent in the management of his private affairs, yet, through the love of power, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> always busy in matters of a political nature, and no man in the colony equalled him in the knowledge of the law and the arts of intrigue. From this character, the reader will easily perceive, that governor Hunter showed his prudence, in taking mr. Morris into his confidence, his talents and ad∣vantages rendering him either a useful friend or formidable foe. Such were the acting members of this assembly. When brigadier Hunter spoke to them, he recommended the set∣tling a revenue, the defence of the frontiers, and the resto∣ration of the public credit, which lord Cornbury had al¦most entirely destroyed. To stifle the remaining sparks of our ancient feuds, he concluded with these words: "If any go about to disturb your peace, by reviving buried parties or piques, or creating new ones, they shall meet with no countenance or encouragement from me; and I am sure they deserve as little from you." The address of the house was perfectly agreeable to the governor. They promised to provide for the support of government, and to restore the public credit, as well as to protect the frontiers. In answer to the close of his speech, they declare their hope, "That such as excited party contentions, might meet with as little credit, and as much disgrace, as they deserve." This una∣nimity, however, was soon interrupted. Colonel Morris, for some warm words dropped in a debate, was expelled the house; and soon after a dispute arose, between the council and assembly, concerning some amendments, made by the former, to a bill "for the treasurer's paying sundry
<PB N="143" REF="024800_0138_0FCD637238460950"/>sums of money." The design of it, in mentioning the par∣ticular sums, and rendering them issuable by their own of∣ficer, was to restrain the governor from repeating the mis∣applications which had been so frequent in a late adminis∣tration. The council, for that reason, opposed it, and ad∣hered to their amendments; which occasioned a prorogati∣on, on the 25th of November, after the passing of several other necessity laws.</P>
<P>Mr. Hunter cautiously avoided entering, publicly, into the dispute between the two houses, till he knew the sen∣timents of the ministry, and then he opened the spring ses∣sions with a speech too singular not to he inserted.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I hope you are now come with a disposition to answer the ends of your meeting, that is, to provide a suitable sup∣port for her majesty's government here, in the manner she has been pleased to direct; to find out means to restore the public credit, and to provide better for your own security.</P>
<P>They abuse you, who tell you, that you are hardly dealt by in the augmentation of salaries. Her majesty's instruc∣tions, which I communicated to you at our last meeting, might have convinced you, that is was her tenderness to∣wards her subjects in the plantations, who suffered under an established custom of making considerable presents to their governors, by acts of assembly, that induced her to allot to each of them such a salary as she judged sufficient for their support, in their respective stations, with a strict prohibi∣tion of all such presents for the future; which instruction has met with a chearful and grateful compliance in all the other colonies.</P>
<P>If you have been in any thing distinguished, it is by an extraordinary measure of her royal bounty and care. I hope you will make suitable returns, lest some insinuations, much repeated of late years, should gain credit at last, that how∣ever your resentment has fallen upon the governor, it is the government you dislike.</P>
<P>It is necessary, at this time, that you be told also, that giving money for the support of government, and disposing of it at your pleasure, is the same with giving none at all. Her majesty is the sole judge of the merits of her servants. This right has never yet been disputed at home, and should I consent to give it up abroad, I should render myself unworthy, not only of the trust reposed in me, but of the society of my fellow subjects, by incurring her highest dis∣pleasure. If I have tired you by a long speech, I shall make
<PB N="144" REF="024800_0139_0FCD63731312B0C0"/>amends by parting you to the trouble of a very short an∣swer.</P>
<P>Will you support her majesty's government, in the manner she has been pleased to direct, or are you resolved that burden shall lie still upon the governor, who cannot accuse himself of any thing that may have deserved this treatment at your hands?</P>
<P>Will you take care of the debts of the government; or, to increase my sufferings, must I continue under the torture of the daily cries of such as have just demands upon you, and are in misery, without the power of giving them my hopes of relief?</P>
<P>Will you take more effectual care of your own safety, in that of your frontiers; or are you resolved for the fu∣ture to rely upon the security of an open winter, and the caprice of your savage neighbours? I shall be very sorry if this plainness offends you. I judge it necessary towards the establishing and cultivating a good understanding betwixt us. I hope it will be so construed, and wish heartily it may have that effect."</P>

<P>Perplexed with this remarkable speech, the assembly, af∣ter a few days, concluded, that as his excellency had pro∣rogued them in February, while he was at Burlington, in the province of New-Jersey, they could not sit and act as a house; upon which, they were the same day dissolved.</P>
<P>The five Indian kings, carried to England by colonel Schuyler, having seen all the curiosities in London, and been much entertained by many persons of distinction, re∣turned to Boston, with commodore Martin and colonel Nicholson; the latter of whom commanded the forces de∣signed against Port-Royal and the coast of Nova-Scotia. In this enterprise the New-England colonies, agreeable to their wonted courage and loyalty, lent their assistance; and the reduction of the garrison, which was then called Annapo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is-Royal, was happily completed on the 2d of October, 1710. Animated by this, and some other successes in New-foundland, Nicholson again urged the prosecution of the scheme for the reduction of Canada; which, having been strongly recommended by the Indian chiefs, as the only ef∣fectual means to secure the northern colonies, was now again resumed.</P>
<P>Towards the execution of this project, five thousand troops from England and Flanders, were sent over under the command of brigadier Hill, the brother of mrs. Masham, the queen's new confidant, on the disgrace of the duchess of
<PB N="145" REF="024800_0140_0FCD6374C0D14250"/>Marlborough. The fleet of transports, under the convoy of sir Hoveden Walker, arrived, after a month's passage, at Boston, on the 4th of June, 1711. The provisions, with which they expected to be supplied there, being not provid∣ed, the troops landed. Nicholson, who was to command the land forces, came immediately to New-York, where in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Hunter convened the assembly, on the 2d of July. The re∣election of the same members, who had served in the last, was a sufficient proof of the general aversion to the establish∣ment of a revenue. Robert Livingston, junior, who married the only daughter of colonel Schuyler, came in for Albauy; and, together with mr. Morris, who was again chosen for the borough of West-Chester, joined the governor's interest. Brigadier Hunter informed the assembly of the intended expedition, and the arrival of the fleet and forces; that the quota of this province, settled by the council of war, at New-London, was 600 private centinels and their officers: besides which, he recommended their making provision for building batteaus, transporting the troops and provisions, subsisting the Indians, and for the contingent charges: nor did he forget to mention the support of government and the public debts.</P>
<P>The house was so well pleased with the design upon Ca∣nada, that they voted an address of thanks to the queen, and sent a committee to Nicholson, to congratulate his ar∣rival, and make an honourable acknowledgment of his "se∣dulous application to her majesty for reducing Canada." In a few days time, an act was passed for raising forces; and the assembly, by a resolution, according to the governor's advice, restricted the price of provisions to certain particu∣lar sums. Bills of credit, for forwarding the expedition, were now also struck, to the amount of 10,000<ABBR>d.</ABBR> to be sunk in five years, by a tax on estates real and personal. After these supplies were granted, the governor prorogued the assembly; though nothing was done relating to the ordi∣nary support of government.</P>
<P>While these preparations were making at New-York, the fleet, consisting of twelve men of war, forty transports, and six store-ships, with forty horses, a fine train of artillery and all manner of warlike stores, sailed for Canada, from Bos∣ton, on the 30th of July; and, about a month afterwards, Nicholson appeared at Albany, at the head of an army of four thousand men, raised in this and the colonies of New-Jersey and Connecticut: the several regiments being com∣manded by colonel Ingolsby, colonel Whiting, and colonel
<PB N="146" REF="024800_0141_0FCD637B709A98B0"/>Schuyler, the latter of whom procured 600 of the five na∣tions to join our army.</P>
<P>The French, in Canada, were not unapprised of these designs. Vandreuil, the governor general, sent his orders, from Montreal, to the sieur de Beaucourt, to hasten the works he was about at Quebee, and commanded that all the regulars and militia should be held in readiness to march on the first warning. Four or five hundred Indians, of the more distant nations, arrived at the same time at Montreal, with messieurs St. Pierre and Tonti, who, together with the Caghnuaga proselytes, took up the hatchet in favour of the French. Vaudreuil after dispatching several Indians and two missionaries among the five nations, to detach them from our interest, went to Quebec, which Beaucourt, the engineer, had sufficiently fortified to sustain a long siege. All the prin∣cipal posts below the city, on both sides of the river, were prepared to receive the British troops in case of their land∣ing. On the 14th of August, sir Hoveden Walker arrived with the fleet in the mouth of St. Lawrence river; and fear∣ing to lose the company of the transports, the wind blow∣ing fresh at north-west, he put into Gaspy bay, and con∣tinued there till the 20th of the same month. Two days af∣ter he sailed from thence, the fleet was in the utmost dan∣ger, for they had no soundings, were without sight of land, the wind high at east-south-east, and the sky darkened by a thick fog. In these circumstances, the fleet brought to, by the advice of the pilots, who were of opinion, that if the shipe lay with their heads to the southward, they might be driven by the stream into the midst of the channel: but instead of that, in two hours after, they found themselves on the north shore, among rocks and islands, and upon the point of being lost. The men of war escaped, but eight transports, containing eight hundred souls, officers, sol∣diers, and seamen, were cast away. Two or three days being spent, in recovering what they could from the shore, it was determined, at a consultation of sea officers, to return to some bay or harbour, till a further resolution could be taken. On the 14th of September, they arrived at Spanish-River bay, where a council of war, consisting of land and sea of∣ficers, considering that they had but ten weeks provision, and judging that they could not depend upon a supply from New-England, unanimously concluded to return home, without making any farther attempts; and they according∣ly arrived at Portsmouth on the 9th of October, when, in addition to our misfortunes, the Edgar, a 70 gun ship, was
<PB N="147" REF="024800_0142_0FCD637CCD85C6D8"/>blown up, having on board above four hundred men, be∣sides many persons who came to visit their friends.</P>
<P>As soon as the marquis de Vaudreuil, by the accounts of the fishermen and two other ships, had reason to suspect that our fleet was returned, he went to Chambly, and formed a camp of three thousand men to oppose Nicholson's army, intended to penetrate Canada, at that end. But he was soon informed that our troops were returned, upon the news of the disaster which had befallen the fleet, and that the peo∣ple of Albany were in the utmost consternation.</P>
<P>The new ministry are generally censured for their con∣duct in this expedition by the whigs, who condemn both the project and the measures taken towards its execution. The scheme was never laid before the parliament, though it was then sitting; but this, it is said, was for the greater secrecy, and for the same reason, the fleet was not fully victualled at home. They relied upon New-England for sup∣plies, and this destroyed the design. For the ships tarried at Boston, till the season for the attack was over.</P>
<P>According to lord Harley's account of this expedition, the whole was a contrivance of Bolingbroke, Moore, and the lord chancellor Harcourt, to cheat the public of twenty thousand pounds. The latter of these was pleased to say, "No government was worth serving, that would not admit of such advantageous jobs."</P>
<P>Apprehensive that the enemy would fall upon our bor∣ders, as they afterwards really did, in small parties, upon the miscarriage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at enterprise; governor Hunter pressed the assembly, in autumn, to continue a number of men in pay the ensuing winter, and to repair the out-forts. After the house had passed several votes to this purpose, his ex∣cellency, during the session, went up to Albany, to withdraw the forces of the colony, and give orders for the necessary repairs.</P>
<P>The public debts, by this unfortunate expedition, were become greatly enhanced, and the assembly, at last, enter∣ed upon measures for the support of the government, and sent up to the council several bills for that purpose. The latter attempted to make amendments, which the other would not admit, and a warm controversy arose between those two branches of the legislature. The council assigned instances, that amendments had formerly been allowed: and, besides this argument, drawn from precedent, insisted that they were a part of the legislature, constituted as the assembly were, "by the mere grace of the crown;" adding that the lords of made had determined the matter in their
<PB N="148" REF="024800_0143_0FCD637E59115008"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. The house nevertheless, adhered to their resolutions, and answered in these words:</P>
<P>"'Tis true, the share the council have (if any) in the le∣gislation, does not flow from any title they have from the nature of that board, which is only to advise; or from their being another distinct state, or rank of people in the consti∣tution, which they are not, being all commons; but only from the mere pleasure of the prince, signified in the com∣mission. On the contrary, the inherent right the assembly have to dispose of the money of the freemen of this colony, does not proceed from any commission, letters patent, or other grant from the crown; but from the free choice and election of the people, who ought not to be divested of their property (nor justly can) without their consent. Any former condescensions, of other assemblies, will not pres∣cribe to the council, a privilege to make any of those amend∣ments, and therefore they have it not. If the lords com∣missioners for trade and plantations, did conceive no reason why the council should not have right to amend money bills, this is far from concluding there are none. The assem∣bly understand them very well, and are sufficiently con∣vinced of the necessity they are in, not to admit of any en∣croachment so much to their prejudice."</P>
<P>Both houses adhered obstinately to their respective opini∣ons: in consequence of which, the public debts remained unpaid, though his excellency could not omit passing a bill for paying to himself 3750 ounces of plate.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the fleet, Dudley, Saltonstal, and Cranston, the governors of the eastern colonies, formed a design of engaging the five nations in a rupture with the French, and wrote on that head to mr. Hunter; who, sus∣picious that his assembly would not approve of any project that might increase the public debts, laid their letter before the house, and, according to his expectations, they declar∣ed against the scheme.</P>
<P>About this time colonel Hunter, by the advice of his council, began to exercise the office of chancellor, having, on the 4th of October, appointed messieurs Van Dam and Philipse, masters, mr. Whileman, register, mr. Harrison, examiner, and messieurs Sharpas and Broughton, clerks. A proclamation was then issued, to signify the sitting of the court on Thursday in every week. This gave rise to these two resolutions of the house.</P>
<P>"Resolved, that the erecting a court of chancery, with∣out consent in general assembly, is contrary to law, with∣out
<PB N="149" REF="024800_0144_0FCD637FCE466B40"/>precedent, and of dangerous consequences to the liberty and property of the subjects.</P>
<P>"That the establishing fees, without consent in general assembly, is contrary to law." The council made these votes the subject of part of a long representation, which they shortly after transmitted to the lords of trade, who, in a letter to the governor, in answer to it, approved of his e∣recting a court of equity, and blamed the assembly; adding, "That her majesty has an undoubted right of appointing such, and so many courts of judicature, in the plantati∣ons, as she shall think necessary for the distribution of justice."</P>
<P>At the next meeting, in May 1712, colonel Hunter strong∣ly recommended the public debts to the consideration of the assembly, informing them, that the lords of trade had signified their opinion, with respect to the amending money bills, in favour of the council. The house neglected the matters laid before them, and the governor broke up the session by a short prorogation of three days. After which they soon passed an act for paying his excellency 8025 ounces of plate. Our public affairs never wore a more melancholy aspect than at this juncture.</P>
<P>Among the five nations many emissaries from the French were daily seducing them from the British interest, and our late ill success gave such a powerful influence to their solici∣tations, that the Indians even at Catt's Kill sent a belt of Wampum to those in Duchess county, to prepare for a war. The Senecas and Shawanas were also greatly disaffected: and it was generally apprehended that they would fall upon the inhabitants along Hudson's river. An invasion was strongly suspected, by sea, on the city of New-York, where they had been alarmed, in April, by an insurrection of the negroes; who, in execution of a plot to set fire to the town, had burnt down a house in the night, and killed several people who came to extinguish the fire, for which nineteen of them were afterwards executed. But distressed as the co∣lony then was, the assembly were inflexibly averse to the establishment of a revenue, which had formerly been wickedly misapplied and exhausted. At the ensuing session, in the fall, colonel Hunter proposed a scheme to the assem∣bly, which was, in substance, that the receiver-general should give security, residing in the colony, for the due execution of his office; and, every quarter, account, to the governor and council, for the sums he might receive. That the creditors of the government should, every three months,
<PB N="150" REF="024800_0145_0FCD63ED15BF1BB0"/>deliver in their demands to the governor and council; when, if that quarter's revenue equalled the amount of such debts, the governor, by the advice of council, should draw for it; but if the revenue for that quarter, should fall short of the governor's demands; then the warrants were to be drawn for so much only as remained, and the creditors should afterwards receive new drafts for their balances in the next quarter. That no warrant should be issued, until the quarterly account of the revenue was given in; but that then they should be paid in course, and an action of debt be given against the receiver-general in case of refusal. That he should account also to the assembly when required, and permit all persons to have recourse to his books. The house turned a deaf ear to this plausible project, and, dis∣pleased with a letter from the lords of trade, favouring the council's claim to amend money bills, they agreed upon an ad∣dress to the queen, protesting their willingness to support her government, complaining of misapplications in the treasury, intimating their suspicions that they were misrepresented, and praying an instruction to the governor to give his con∣sent to a law, for supporting an agent to represent them at the court of Great Britain. Provoked by this conduct, and to put an end to the disputes subsisting between the two houses, his excellency dissolved the assembly.</P>
<P>Before the meeting of the next assembly, the peace of Utrecht was concluded, on the 31st of March, 1713. A peace, in the judgment of many, dishonourable to Great-Britain, and injurious to her allies. I shall only consider it with relation to our Indian affairs. The reader doubtless observed, that lord Bellamont, after the peace at Ryswick, contended with the governor of Canada, that the five na∣tions ought to be considered as subjects of the British crown, and that the point was disputed even after the death of count Frontenac. It does not appear that any decision of that matter was made between the two crowns, till the trea∣ty of Utrecht, the XVth article of which is in these words:</P>
<P>"The subjects of France inhabiting Canada, and others, shall hereafter give no hindrance or molestation to the five nations, or cantons of Indians, subject to the dominion of Great-Britain, nor to the other nations of America who are friends to the same. In like manner, the subjects of Great-Britain shall behave themselves peaceably towards the A∣mericans, who are subjects or friends to France; and on both sides, they shall enjoy full liberty of going and coming on account of trade. Also the natives of these countries shall,
<PB N="151" REF="024800_0146_0FCD63841EF621D8"/>with the same liberty, resort, as they please, to the British and French colonies, for promoting trade on one side and the other, without any molestation or hindrance, either on the part of the British subjects, or of the French. But it is to be exactly and distinctly settled by commissaries, who are, and who ought to be, accounted the subjects of Britain or of France."</P>
<P>In consequence of this treaty, the British crown became entitled, at least for any claim that could justly be interpos∣ed by the French, to the sovereignty over the country of the five nations, concerning the extent of which, as it never was adjusted by commissaries, it may not be improper to say a few words.</P>
<P>When the Dutch began the settlement of this country, all the Indians on Long-Island, and the northern shore of the sound, on the banks of Connecticut, Hudson's, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers, were in subjection to the five nati∣ons; and, within the memory of persons now living, ac∣knowledged it by the payment of an annual tribute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A little tribe, settled at the sugar-loaf mountain in Orange county, to this day make a yearly payment of about 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the Mohawks.</NOTE>. The French historians of Canada, both ancient and modern, agree, that the more northern Indians were driven before the superior martial prowers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confederates. The au∣thor of the book entitled, <HI>Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee qui s' est passe de plus remarquable aux mission de peres de la compagnie de Jesus, en la nouvelle France,</HI> published with the privilege of the French king, at Paris, in 1661, writes with such singular sim∣plicity, as obviates the least suspicion of those sinister views, so remarkable in the late French histories. He in∣forms us, that all the northern Indians, as far as Hudson's bay, were harrassed by the five nations. "Partous (says he, speaking in the name of the missionaries) "<HI>nous trouvons Iroquois, qui, comme un phantome importun, nous obsede en tous lieux.</HI>" In the account he gives of the travels of a fa∣ther, in 1658, we are told, that the banks of the upper lake were lined with the Algonkins, <HI>"ou la crainte des Iroquois leur a fait chercher un asyle."</HI> Writing of the Hurons, <HI>"la nation la plus sedentaire &amp; la plus propre pour les semences de la foi,"</HI> he represents them as totally destroyed by the con∣federates. Charlevoix; whose history of New France is cal∣culated to countenance the encroachments of the French,
<PB N="152" REF="024800_0147_0FCD638784BD97B0"/>gives the following description of the territory of the con∣federates.</P>
<P>"The country of the Iroquois (says he) extends itself be∣tween the 41st and 44th degrees of north latitude, about 70 or 80 leagues from east to west, from the head of the river, bearing for its name that of Richlieu and Sorel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The river issuing from lake Champlain, is called, Riviere des Iroquois de Richelieu &amp; Sorel: but the last is now most commonly used.</NOTE>; that is, from lake St. Sacrament to Niagara, and a little above forty leagues from north to south, or rather north east and south∣west from the head of the Mohawks river to the river Ohio, Thus the last mentioned river and Pennsylvania bound it on the south. On the west it has lake Ontario; and lake Erie on the north-west; St. Sacrament and the river St. Lawrence on the north; on the south and south-east, the province of New-York. It is watered with many rivers. The land is in some places broken, but, generally speaking, very fertile."</P>
<P>In this partial description, the jesuit is neither consistent with his geographer, nor several other French authors; and yet both his history and mr. Bellin's maps, in 1744<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bellin published a new set of maps in 1745, the first plate being thought too favourable to our claims, espe∣cially in the protraction of the north side of the bay of Fun∣dy, for Nova Scotia, which, in the second plate, was called "the south part of New France." General Shirley, one of the British commissaries for settling the disputed limits, took occasion to speak of this alteration to mr. Bellin at Paris, and informed him that 100 copies of his first maps were dispersed in London, upon which he discovered some surprise; but instead of urging any thing in support of the variation in his new draft, said, smiling, "we in France must follow the command of the monarch." I mention this to show, that since the French government interposes in the construction of their maps, they are proper evidence against them. Among the English, dr. Mitchel's is the only authen∣tic one extant. None of the rest, concerning America, have passed under the examination, or received the sanction of any public board; and, for this reason, they ought not to be construed to our prejudice. Add, that they generally copy from the French.</NOTE>, which are bound up with it, furnish many strong evidences in favour of the British claims. I will point out a few in∣stances.
<PB N="153" REF="024800_0148_0FCD6388D66FAAE8"/>The ancient country of the Hurons is laid down on the north side of lake Erie, by which we are ascertained of the extent of territory, to which the five nations are enti∣tled by their conquest of that people. The right of the confederates to the south side of that lake, is also establish∣ed by their dispersion of the Cat Indians, to whom it origin∣ally belonged. The land, on both sides of the lake Ontario, is admitted to be theirs by this geographer, who writes on the north, "Les Iroquois du nord," and on tthe south side, "Pays des Iroquois." Hennepin, la Hontan, and Delis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, all concur with Bellin, in extending the right of the sive nations, to the lands on the north side of lake Ontario. The first of these, besides what appears from his map, speaking of that lake, has these words, "There are likewise on the north side, these Iroquois villages, Tejajahon, Kente, and Ganneousse;" every one of which is laid down even in Bellin's, and almost all the maps I have seen of that country whether French or English. What renders Hennepin's ac∣count the more remarkable, is, that these villages were there in 1679, seven years after the erection of fort Frontenac. From whence it may fairly be argued, that their not oppo∣sing those works, was by no means a cession of the country to the French; and indeed Charlevoix himself represents that matter as carried on by a fraud, for, says he, "under pretext of seeking their advantage, the governor had no∣thing in view, <HI>que de les tenir en bride.</HI>"</P>

This last tract, and the land on the north side of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es Erie and Ontario, were contained in their surrender to king William, in 1701; of which I took notice in its proper place: and doubtless to that, and lord Bellamont's contest with count Frontenac, we must ascribe it, that the five nati∣ons were afterwards so particularly taken notice of in the treaty of Utrecht.</P>
<P>The British title to fort Frontenac, and the lands on the north-west side of Cadaracqui river, has of late been drawn into question by some, who, from jealousy, or other motives equally shameful, were bent upon finding fault with every measure planned by general Shirley. The advocates for the French claim, relied much on a late map of the middle British colonies, and two pamphlets published by Leves Evans.</P>
<P>"The French," says he, "being in possession of fort Frontenac, at the peace of Ryswick, which they attained during their war with the confederates, gives them an un∣doubted title to the acquisition of the north-west side of St. Lawrence river, from thence to their settlement at Montreal." The writer adds; "It was upon the faith and honour of king William's promise (by the fourth article of the treaty of Ryswick) of not disturbing the French king in the fire possession of the kingdoms, countries, lands, or dominions he then enjoyed, that I said the French had an undoubted title to their acquisition of the north-west side of St. Lawrence river, from Frontenac to Montreal."</P>
<P>Whether the treaty ought to be considered, as having any relation to this matter, is a question which I shall not take upon me to determine. The map-maker supposes it to be applicable, and, for the present, I grant it. The XIIth article of this treaty is in these words: "The most christian king shall restore to the king of Great-Britain, all countries, islands, forts, and colonies, whereseoevr situated, which the English did possess before the declaration of the present war. And in like manner, the king of Great-Britain shall restore to the most christian king, all countries, islands, forts, and colonies, wheresoever situated, which the French did possess before the said declaration of war." If therefore the British subjects were in possession of fort Fron∣tenac at the commencement of the war, the French, who attained it during its continuance, according to this treaty, ought to have surrendered it to the British crown.</P>
<P>Whatever the French title to fort Frontenac might have been, antecedent to the year 1688, in which the island of
<PB N="155" REF="024800_0150_0FCD638D7932D668"/>Montreal was invaded by the sive nations, it is certain, that it was then abandoned, and that the Indians entered it, and demolished a great part of the works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le fort de Catarocouy étoit évacué &amp; ruiné. Charl.</NOTE>. But the author of the map assirms, "that the English did not possess fort Fron∣tenac before the declaration of war terminated by the peace of Ryswick." To which I reply, that the Indians acquired a title in 1688, either by conquest, or dereliction, or both: and that the crown of Great-Britain had a right to take ad∣vantage of their acquisition, in virtue of its so vereignty over the five cantons. That they were our dependents, was strongly and often infisted upon by governor Dongan and lord HeHamont, and the point remained <HI>sub judice,</HI> till the treaty of Utrecht. Then a decision was solemnly made in our favour, which looks back, as the determination of all dis∣putes do, at least as far as the first rise of the controversy; posterior to which, and prior to king William's war, his Indian subjects obtained the possession of the fort in questi∣on<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The five nations entered the fort in 1688, and the war against France was not proclaimed till May 1689.</NOTE> Whence I think it may be fairly deduced, if we take the treaty of Ryswick for our rule, that fort Frontenac, which was regained by the French during their war with us, ought to have been surrendered to the British crown. Every public transaction between the French and the five nations, without the participation of the government of Great-Bri∣tain, since the Indians were claimed as our dependents, is perhaps absolutely void, and particularly the treaty of peace made between the Indians and the chevalier de Callieres, after the death of count Frontenac<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Evans's map and first pamphlet, or analysis, were pub∣lished in the summer 1755, and that part in favour of the French claim to Frontenac, was attacked by two papers in the New York Mercury, in Jan. 1756. This occasioned his publication of the second pamphlet the next spring, in which he endeavours to support his map. He was a man in low circumstances, in his temper precipitate, of violent passions, great vanity, and rude manners. He pretended to the knowledge of every thing, and yet had very little learn∣ing. By his inquisitive turn, he filled his head with a consi∣derable collection of materials; and a person of more judg∣ment than he had, might, for a few days, receive advan∣tages from his conversation. He piqued himself much upon his two maps, which are however justly chargeable with many errors. His ignorance of language is evident, both in them and the two pamphlets of his analysis, the last of which is stuffed with groundless aspersions on general Shirley, who deserves so well from these colonies, that on that ac∣count, and to weaken the authority of a map prejudicial to his majesty's rights, I beg the reader's excuse for this in∣fraction of the old rule, <HI>de mortuis nil nisi bonum.</HI> He died at New-York, June 12, 1756, under an arrest for a gross slander, uttered against mr. Morris, the governor of Penn∣sylvania.</NOTE>.</P>

The possession of any part of the country of the five nati∣ons by the French, either before or since the close of queen Anne's war, cannot prejudice the British title, because the treaty of Aix la Chapelle renews and confirms that execut∣ed at Utrecht in 1713, and expressly stipulates that the dominions of the contracting parties shall be in the same condition, "which they ought of right to have been in be∣fore the late war." Commissaries were soon after appointed to adjust the controverted limits, who accordingly met at Paris, and continued the negociation, till the French king persidiously seized upon several parts of Nova-Scotia, or A∣cadia, the settlement of the bounds of which, was part of the very business of the commissaries. This gave rise to the present operations, and the longest sword will determine the controversy.</P>
<P>Brigadier Hunter was disappointed in his expectations upon the late dissolution; for though the elections were very hot, and several new members came in, yet the majori∣ty were in the interest of the late assembly, and on the 27th of May, 1713, chose mr. Nicoll into the chair. The gover∣nor spoke to them with great plainness, informing them, that it would be in vain to endeavour to lodge the money allotted for the support of government, in any other than the hands of the queen's officers. "Nevertheless," says he, "if you are so resolved, you may put the country to the expense of a treasurer, for the custody of money raised for extraordinary uses." He added, that he was resolved to pass no law, till provision was made for the government. The members were therefore reduced to the dilemma of passing a bill for that purpose, or breaking up immediately. They chose the former, and the governor gave his assent to that, and an excise bill on strong liquors, which continues to this day, producing into the treasury about one thousand pounds per annum. After a short recess, several other laws
<PB N="157" REF="024800_0152_0FCD63911111B488"/>were enacted in the fall. But the debts of the government still remained unnoticed, till the summer of the year 1714. A long session was then almost entirely devoted to that single affair. Incredible were the numbers of the public creditors. New demands were every day made. Petitions came in from all quarters, and even for debts contracted before the revolution. Their amount was near twenty eight thousand pounds. To pay this prodigious sum, recourse was had to the circulation of bills of credit to that value. These were lodged in the hands of the province treasurer, and issued by him only, according to the directions of the act.</P>
<P>The news of the queen's death arriving in the ensuing fall, a dissolution ensued of course; and a new house met in May, 1715, which continued only to the 21st of July. For the governor being now determined to subdue those, whom he could not allure, again dissolved the assembly. He succeeded in his design, for though mr. Nicoll was re-elect∣ed into the chair on the 9th of June, 1716, yet we plainly perceive, by the harmony introduced between the several branches of the legislature, that the majority of the house were now in the interest of the governor.</P>
<P>An incontestible evidence of their good understanding, appeared at the session in autumn, 1717, when the governor informed them of a memorial, which had been sent home, reflecting upon his administration. The house immediately voted an address to him, which was conceived in terms of the utmost respect, testifying their abhorrence of the memorial, as a false and malicious libel. It was supposed to be written by Mulford, a representative for Suffolk county, who always opposed the measures that were taken to pre∣serve the friendship of the five nations, and foolishly pro∣jected a scheme to cut them off. It was printed in England, and delivered to the members at the door of the house of commons, but never had the author's intended effect.</P>
<P>It was at this meeting, the council, on the 31st of Octo∣ber, sent a message by mr. Alexander, then deputy secreta∣ry, to the house, desiring them "to appoint proper per∣sons, for running the division line between this colony and the province of New-Jersey, his excellency being assured the legislature of the province of New-Jersey will bear half the expense thereof." The assembly had a bill before them, at that time, which afterwards passed into a law, for the payment of the remaining debts of the government, amount∣ing to many thousand pounds; in which, after a recital of
<PB N="158" REF="024800_0153_0FCD63928DF7F168"/>the general reasons, for ascertaining the limits between New-York and New-Jersey on the one side, and Connecti∣cut on the other, a clause was added, to defray the expense of those services. Seven hundred and fifty ounces of plate were enacted "to be issued by warrant, under the hand and seal of the governor of this province for the time being, by and with the advice and consent of his majesty's council, in such parts and portions as shall be requisite for that service, when the survey, ascertaining, and running the said line, limit, and boundary, shall be begun, and carried on, by the mutual consent and agreement of his excellency and coun∣cil of this province, and the proprietors of the soil of the said province of New-Jersey." According to this law, the line "agreed on by the surveyors and commissioners of each colony was to be conclusive." Another sum was also provided by the same clause, for running the line between New-York and Connecticut; and in the year, 1719, an act was passed for the settlement of that limit, of which I shall have occasion to take notice in a succeeding adminis∣tration.</P>
<P>Whether it was because mr. Nicoll was disgusted with the governor's prevailing interest in the house, or to his infirm state of health, that he desired, by a letter to the general assembly, on the 18th of May, 1718, to be discharg∣ed from the speaker's place, is uncertain. His request was readily granted, and Robert Livingston, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> chosen in his stead. The concord between the governor and this assembly, was now wound up to its highest pitch. Instead of other evi∣dences of it, I shall lay before the reader his last speech to the house on the 24th of June 1719, and their address in answer to it.</P>

<P>I have now sent for you, that you may be witnesses to my assent to the acts passed by the general assembly in this session. I hope that what remains unfinished, may be per∣fected by to-morrow, when I intend to put a close to this session.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity also to acquaint you, that my late uncertain state of health, the care of my little family, and my private affairs, on the other side, have at last de∣termined me, to make use of that license of absence, which has been some time ago so graciously granted me; but with a firm resolution to return to you again, if it is his majesty's pleasure that I should do so: but if that proves otherwise, I assure you that whilst I live, I shall be watchful and indus∣trious

<P>I look with pleasure on the present quiet and flourish∣ing state of the people here, whilst I reflect on that in which I found them at my arrival. As the very name of party or faction seems to be forgotten, may it for ever lie buried in oblivion, and no strife ever happen among you, but that laudable emulation, who shall approve himself the most zea∣lous servant and most dutiful subject of the best of princes, and most useful member of a well established and flourishing community, of which you, gentlemen, have given a hap∣py example, which I hope will be followed by future assem∣blies.

<P>Colonel Morris and the new speaker were the authors of the answer to this speech, though it was signed by all the members. Whether mr. Hunter deserved the eulogium they bestowed upon him, I leave the reader to determine. It is certain that few plantation governors have the honour to carry home with them such a testimonial as this:</P>
<P>"Sir, when we reflect upon your past conduct, your just, mild, and tender administration, it heightens the concern we have for your departure, and makes our grief such as words cannot truly express. You have governed well and wisely, like a prudent magistrate, like an affectionate parent; and wherever you go, and whatever station the divine pro∣vidence shall please to assign you, our sincere desires and prayers for the happiness of you and yours, shall always at∣tend you.</P>
<P>"We have seen many governors, and may see more; and as none of those, who had the honour to serve in your sta∣tion, were ever so justly fixed in the affections of the go∣verned, so those to come will acquire no mean reputation, when it can be said of them, their conduct has been like yours.</P>
<P>"We thankfully accept the honour you do us, in calling yourself our countryman: give us leave then to desire, that you will not forget this as your country, and, if you can, make haste to return to it.</P>
<P>"But if the service of our sovereign will not admit of what we so earnestly desire, and his commands deny us that happiness; permit us to address you as our friend, and give
<PB N="160" REF="024800_0155_0FCD63970EE606A0"/>us your assistance, when we are oppressed with an adminis∣tration the reverse of yours."</P>
<P>Colonel Hunter departing the province, the chief com∣mand devolved, the 31st of July, 1719, on Peter Schuyler, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> then the eldest member of the board of council. As he had no interview with the assembly during his short ad∣ministration, in which he behaved with great moderation and integrity; there is very little observable in his time, except a treaty, at Albany, with the Indians, for confirming the antient league; and the transactions respecting the par∣tition line between this and the colony of New-Jersey: concerning the latter of which, I shall now lay before the reader a very summary account.</P>
<P>The two provinces were originally included in the grant of king Charles to the duke of York. New-Jersey was after∣wards conveyed by the duke to lord Berkley and sir George Carteret. This again, by adeed of partition, was divided into East and West Jersey, the former being released to sir George Carteret, and the latter to the assigns of lord Berkley. The line of division extended from little Egg harbour to the north partition point on Delaware river; and thus both those tracts became concerned in the limits of the province of New-York. The original rights of lord Berkley and sir George Carteret, are vested in two different sets, consisting each of a great number of persons, known by the general name of the proprietors of East and West Jersey, who, though they surrendered the powers of government to queen Anne, in the year 1702, still retained their property in the soil. These were the persons interested against the claim of New-York. It is agreed on all sides, that the deed to New-Jersey is to be first satisfied, out of that great tract granted to the duke, and that the remainder is the right of New-York. The proprietors insist upon extending their northern limits to a line drawn from the latitude of 41° 40′ on Delaware, to the latitude of 41°, on Hudson's river; and allege, that before the year 1671, the latitude of 41°, was reputed to be fourteen miles to the northward of Tappan creek, part of those lands being settled under New-Jersey till 1684. They farther contend, that in 1684 or 1685, Dongan and Lawrie, (the former, governor of New-York, and the latter, of New-Jersey), with their respective councils, agreed, that the latitude on Hudson's river was at the mouth of Tappan creek, and that a line from thence to the latitude of 41° 40′ on Delaware should be the boundary line. In 1686, Robin∣son
<PB N="161" REF="024800_0156_0FCD6398C5048FA8"/>Wells, and Keith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same who left the quakers, and took orders in the church of England. Burnet's hist. of his own times.</NOTE> surveyors of the three several pro∣vinces, took two observations, and found the latitude of 41° to be 1′ and 25′ to the northward of the Yonker's mills, which is four miles and forty five chains to the southward of the month of Tappan creek. But against these observa∣tions the proprietors offer sundry objections, which it is not my business to enumerate. It is not pretended by any of the litigants, that a line, according to the stations settled by Dongan and Lawrie, was actually run; so that the limits of these contending provinces, must long have existed in the uncertain conjectures of the inhabitants of both; and yet the inconveniences of this unsettled state, through the in∣fancy of the country, were very inconsiderable. In the year 1701, an act passed in New-York, relating to elections, which annexed Wagachemeck, and great and little Mini∣sink, certain settlements near Delaware, to Ulster county. The intent of this law was to quiet disputes before subsist∣ing between the inhabitants of those places, whose votes were required both in Orange and Ulster. The natural con∣clusion from hence is, that the legislature of New-York then deemed those plantations not included within the New-Jersey grant.</P>
<P>Such was the state of this affair till the year 1717, when provision was made by this province for running the line. The same being done in New-Jersey the succeeding year, commissions for that purpose, under the great seals of the re∣spective colonies, were issued in May, 1719. The commis∣sioners, by indenture dated the 25th of July, fixed the north station point on the northermost branch of Delaware, call∣ed the Fish-Kill; and from thence a random line was run to Hudson's river, terminating about five miles to the north∣ward of the mouth of Tappan creek. In August, the sur∣veyors of East-Jersey met for fixing the station on Hudson's river. All the commissioners not attending through sick∣ness, nothing further was done. What had already been transacted, however, gave a general alarm to many persons interested in several patents under New-York, who before imagined their rights extended to the southward of the random line. The New-York surveyor afterwards declined proceeding in the work, complaining of faults in the instru∣ment, which had been used in fixing the north station on Delaware. The proprietors, on the other hand, think they
<PB N="162" REF="024800_0157_0FCD639A0C4042D0"/>have answered his objections, and the matter rested, with∣out much contention, till the year 1740. Frequent quarrels multiplying after that period, relating to the rights of soil and jurisdiction southward of the line in 1719, a proba∣tionary act was passed in New-Jersey, in February, 1748, for running the line <HI>ex parte,</HI> if the province of New-York refused to join in the work. Our assembly, soon after, di∣rected their agent, to oppose the king's confirmation of that act; and it was accordingly dropped, agreeably to the advice of the lords of trade, whose report of the 18th of July, 1753, on a matter of so much importance, will doubtless be acceptable to the reader.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>To the KING'S most excellent majesty:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have lately had under our consideration, an act passed in your majesty's province of New-Jersey in 1747-8, entitled, 'An act for running and ascertaining the line of partition and division betwixt this province of New-Jersey, and the province of New-York.'</P>
<P>And having been attended by mr. Paris, solicitor in be∣half of the proprietors of the eastern division of New-Jersey—with mr. Hume Campbell, and mr. Henley, his counsel, in support of the said act—and by mr. Charles, agent for the province of New-York, with mr. Forrester, and mr. Pratt, his counsel, against the said act; and heard what each party had to offer thereupon; we beg leave humbly to re∣present to your majesty, that the considerations which arise upon this act, are of two sorts, viz. such as relate to the principles upon which it is founded, and such as relate to the transactions and circumstances which accompany it.</P>
<P>As to the first; it is an act of the province of New-Jer∣sey, interested in the determination of the limits, and in the consequential advantages to arise from it.</P>
<P>The province of New-Jersey, in its distinct and sepa∣rate capacity, can neither make nor establish boundaries: it can as little prescribe regulations for deciding differences between itself and other parties concerned in interest.</P>
<P>The established limits of its jurisdiction and territory, are such as the grants under which it claims have assigned. If those grants are doubtful, and differences arise upon the constructions, or upon the matters of them, we humbly ap∣prehend that there are but two methods of deciding them; either by the concurrence of all parties concerned in in∣terest, or by the regular and legal forms of judicial pro∣ceedings:
<PB N="163" REF="024800_0158_0FCD639EB8CD7D18"/>and it appears to us, that the method of pro∣ceeding must be derived from the immediate authority of the crown itself, signified by a commission from your ma∣jesty under the great seal: the commission of subordinate officers and of derivative powers being neither competent nor adequate to such purposes: to judge otherwise would be, as we humbly conceive, to set up <HI>ex parte</HI> determinations and incompetent jurisdictions in the place of justice and legal authority.</P>
<P>If the act of New-Jersey cannot conclude other parties, it cannot be effectual to the ends proposed; and that it would not be effectual to form an absolute decision in this case, the legislature of that province seems sensible, whilst it endeavours to leave to your majesty's determination, the decision of one point relative to this matter, and of con∣siderable importance to it; which power your majesty can∣not derive from them, without their having the power to establish the thing itself, without the assistance of your ma∣jesty.</P>
<P>As we are of opinion, that the present act, without the concurrence of other parties concerned in interest, is un∣warrantable and ineffectual; we shall, in the next place, consider what transactions and proceedings have passed, to∣wards obtaining such concurrence.</P>
<P>The parties interested are your majesty and the two provinces of New-York and New-Jersey. Your majesty is interested with respect to your sovereignty, seigneurie, and property; and the said provinces with respect to their go∣vernment and jurisdiction.</P>
<P>With regard to the transactions on the part of New-York, we beg leave to observe, that whatever agreements have been made formerly between the two provinces for settling their boundaries; whatever acts of assembly have passed, and whatever commissions have been issued by the respective governors and governments; the proceedings under them have never been perfected, the work remains unfinished, and the disputes between the two provinces sub∣sist with as much contradiction as ever, but there is a cir∣cumstance that appears to us to have still more weight, namely, that those transactions were never properly war∣ranted on the part of the crown: the crown never partici∣pated in them, and therefore cannot be bound with respect to its interests by proceedings so authorized.</P>
<P>The interest, which your majesty has in the determi∣nation of this boundary, may be considered in three lights: either as interests of sovereignty, respecting mere govern∣ment;
<PB N="164" REF="024800_0159_0FCD63A05D183630"/>of seigneurie, which respect escheats, and quit-rents; or of property, as relative to the soil itself; which last in∣terest, takes place in such cases, where either your majesty has never made any grants of the soil, or where such grants have by escheats reverted to your majesty.</P>
<P>With regard to the first of these interests, viz. that of sovereignty, it has been alleged to us, in support of the act, that it is not materially affected by the question, as both provinces are under your majesty's immediate direction and government: but they stand in a very different light with re∣spect to your majesty's interest in the quit-rents and es∣cheats; in both which articles the situation of the two pro∣vinces appears to us to make a very material alteration: for although the province of New-Jersey is not under regula∣tions of propriety or charter with respect to its government, yet it is a proprietary province, with respect to the grant and tenure of its territory: and consequently as New-York is not in that predicament, the determination of the bounda∣ry, in prejudice to that province, will affect your majesty's interest with respect to the tenure of such lands as are con∣cerned in this question: it being evident, that whatever districts are supposed to be included in the limits of New-Jersey, will immediately pass to the proprietors of that pro∣vince, and be held of them, by which means your majesty would be deprived of your escheats, and the quit-rents would pass into other hands.</P>
<P>To obviate this objection, it has been alleged, that the crown has already made absolute grants of the whole terri∣tory that can possibly come in question under the denomi∣nation of this boundary, and reserved only trifling and in∣considerable quit-rents on those grants. But this argument does not seem to us to be conclusive, since it admits an inter∣est in your majesty, the greatness or smallness of which is merely accidental; and therefore does not affect the essence of the question: and we beg leave to observe, that in the case of exorbitant grants with inconsiderable quit-rents—and where consequently it may reasonably be supposed, that the crown has been deceived in such grants by its officers; your majesty's contingent right of property, in virtue of your seigneurie, seems rather to be enlarged than dimi∣nished.</P>
<P>This being the case, it appears to us, that governor Hanter ought not to have issued his commission for running the line above mentioned, without having previously re∣ceived the loyal direction and instruction for that purpose; and that a commission, issued without such authority, can
<PB N="165" REF="024800_0160_0FCD63A195B5ADA0"/>be considered, with respect to the interests of the crown, in no other light than as a mere nullity: and even with respect to New-York, we observe, that the said commission is ques∣tionable, as it does not follow the directions of the above∣mentioned act, passed in 1717, which declares, that the commission to be issued, shall be granted under the joint authority of the governor and council of that province.</P>
<P>But it has been further urged, that the crown has since confirmed these transactions, either by previous declarati∣ons or by subsequent acquiescence, and consequently parti∣cipated in them, so far as to conclude itself: we shall there∣fore, in the next place, beg leave to consider the circum∣stances urged for this purpose.</P>
<P>It has been alleged, that the crown, by giving consent to the aforesaid act, passed in New-York in 1717, for pay∣ing and discharging several debts due from that colony, &amp;c. concluded and bound itself, with respect to the subsequent proceedings had under the commission issued by governor Hunter: but the view and purport of that act appears to us so entire, and so distinctly formed for the purpose of raising money and establishing funds—so various and so dis∣tinct from any consideration of the disputes subsisting in the two provinces, with respect to the boundaries—that we cannot conceive a single clause, in so long and so intricate an act, can be a sufficient foundation to warrant the pro∣ceedings of governor Hunter subsequent to it, without a special authority from the crown for that purpose: and there is the more reason to be of this opinion, as the crown, by giving its assent to that act, can be construed to have as∣sented only to the levying money for a future purpose; which purpose could not be effected by any commission, but from itself; and therefore can never be supposed to have, thereby, approved a commission from another authority, which was at that time already issued, and carrying in exe∣cution, previous to such assent.</P>
<P>We further beg leave humbly to represent to your majesty, that the line of partition and division between your majesty's province of New-York and colony of Connec∣ticut, having been run and ascertained, pursuant to the di∣rections of an act, passed at New-York, for that purpose, in the year 1719, and confirmed by his late majesty in 1723; the transactions between the said province and colony, upon that occasion, have been alleged to be similar to, and urg∣ed as, a precedent, and even as an approbation, of the mat∣ter now in question: but we are humbly of opinion, that the two cases are materially and essentially different. The
<PB N="166" REF="024800_0161_0FCD63A30C326FC0"/>act passed in New-York, in 1719, for running and ascertain∣ing the lines of partition and division between that colony and the colony of Connecticut, recites, that in the year 1683, the governor and council of New-York, and the go∣vernor and commissioners of Connecticut, did, in council, conclude an agreement concerning the boundaries of the two provinces; that, in consequence of this agreement, commissioners and surveyors were appointed on the part of each government, who did actually agree, determine, and ascertain, the lines of partition: marked out a certain part of them, and fixed the point from whence the remaining part should be run: that the several things agreed on and done by the said commissioners, were ratified by the re∣spective governors—entered on record in each colony, in March 1700—approved and confirmed by order of king William, the third, in his privy council—and by his said majesty's letter to his governor of New-York. From this recital it appears to us, that those transactions were not on∣ly carried on with the participation, but confirmed by the express act and authority of the crown; and that confirma∣tion made the foundation of the act, passed by New-York, for settling the boundaries between the two provinces; of all which authority and foundation, the act, we now lay before your majesty, appears to us to be entirely destitute.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as it appears to us, that the act in question, cannot be effectual to the ends proposed—that your majesty's interest may be materially affected by it— and that the proceedings, on which it is founded, were not warranted in the first instance, by the proper authority, but carried on without the participation of the crown; we cannot think it advisable, to lay this act before your majes∣ty, as fit to receive your royal approbation.</P>

<P>Mr. Burnet was a son of the celebrated bishop of that name, whose piety and crudition, but especially his zeal and activity, for the glorious revolution and protestant suc∣cession, will embalm his memory to the most distant ages. The governor was a man of sense and polite breeding, a well-read scholar, sprightly, and of a social disposition. Being devoted to his books, he abstained from all those ex∣cesses, into which his pleasurable relish would otherwise have plunged him. He studied the arts of recommending himself to the people, had nothing of the moroseness of a scholar, was gay and condescending, affected no pomp, but
<PB N="168" REF="024800_0163_0FCD63A990BA0350"/>visited every family of reputation, and often diverted him∣self in free converse with the ladies, by whom he was very much admired. No governor, before him, did so much busi∣ness in chancery. The office of chancellor was his delight. He made a tolerable figure in the exercise of it, though he was no lawyer, and had a foible very unsuitable for a judge I mean his resolving too speedily, for he used to say of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣self, "I act first, and think afterwards." He spoke, how∣ever, always sensibly, and by his great reading was able to make a literary parade.—As to his fortune, it was very in∣considerable, for he suffered much in the south sea scheme. While in England, he had the office of comptroller of the customs at London, which he resigned to brigadier Hunter, as the latter, in his favour, did the government of this and the colony of New-Jersey. Mr. Burnet's acquaintance with that gentleman gave him a fine opportunity, before his ar∣rival, to obtain good intelligence both of persons and things. The brigadier recommended all his old friends to the favour of his successor; and hence we find that he made few changes amongst them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colonel Schuyler and mr. Philipse were, indeed, re∣moved from the council board, by his representations; and their opposing, in council, the continuance of the assembly, after his arrival, was the cause of it.</NOTE>. Mr. Morris, the chief justice, was his principal confidant. Dr. Colden and mr. Alexander, two Scotch gentlemen, had the next place in his esteem. He showed his wisdom in that choice, for they were both men of learning, good morals, and solid parts. The former was well acquainted with the affairs of the province, and particularly those which concerned the French in Canada and our Indian allies. The latter was bred to the law; and though no speaker, at the head of his profession for sagaci∣ty and penetration; and in application to business) no man could surpass him. Nor was he unacquainted with the affairs of the public, having served in the secretary's office, the best school in the province, for instruction in matters of government; because the secretary enjoys a plurality of offices, conversant with the first springs of our provincial economy. Both those gentlemen mr. Burnet soon raised to the council board, as he also did mr. Morris, jun. mr. Van Horn, whose daughter he married, and mr. Kennedy, who succeeded Byerly, both at the council board, and in the of∣fice of receiver-general.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="024800_0164_0FCD63AA8E8F2470"/>
Of all our governors, none had such extensive and just views of our Indian affairs, and the dangerous neighbour∣hood of the French, as governor Burnet, in which mr. Li∣vingston was his principal assistant. His attention to these matters appeared at the very commencement of his adminis∣tration; for in his first speech to the assembly, the very fall after his arrival, he laboured to implant the same senti∣ments in the breasts of the members; endeavouring to a∣larm their fears, by the daily advances of the French, their possessing the main passes, seducing our Indian allies, and encreasing their new settlements in Louisania.</P>
<P>Chief justice Morris, whose influence was very great in the house, drew the address in answer to the governor's speech, which contained a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age manifesting the confi∣dence they reposed in him. "We believe that the son of that worthy prelate, so eminently instrumental, under our glo∣rious monarch, William the third, in delivering us from arbitrary power, and its concomitants, popery, supersti∣tion and slavery; has been educated in, and possesses, those principles, that so justly recommended his father to the council and confidence of protestant princes; and suc∣ceeds our former governor, not only in power, but inclina∣tion to do us good."</P>
<P>From an assembly, impressed with such favourable senti∣ments, his excellency had the highest reason, to expect a submissive compliance, with every thing recommended to their notice. The public business proceeded without suspi∣cion or jealousy, and nothing intervened to disturb the tranquillity of the political state. Among the most remark∣able acts, passed at this session, we may reckon that, for a five years support; another for laying a duty of two per cent. prime cost, on the importation of European goods, which was soon after repealed by the king; and a third, for prohibiting the sale of Indian goods to the French. The last of these was a favourite act of the governor's, and though a law very advantageous to the province, became the source of an unreasonable opposition against him, which continued through his whole administration. From the conclusion of the peace of Utrecht, a great trade was carried on between Albany and Canada, for goods saleable among the Indians. The chiefs of the confederates wisely foresaw its ill consequences, and complained of it to the commissioners of Indian affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The governor's residing at New York, rendered it ne∣cessary, that some persons should be commissioned, at Alba∣ny, to receive intelligence from the Indians, and treat with them upon emergencies. This gave rise to the office of com∣missioners of Indian affairs, who in general transact all such matters as might be done by the governor. They receive no salaries, but considerable sums are deposited in their hands for occasional presents. There are regular minutes of their transactions from the year 1675. These were in separate quires, till mr. Alexander, who borrowed them for his perusal in 1751, had them bound up in four large volumes in folio. Here all our Indian treaties are entered. The books are kept by a secretary, commissioned in Eng∣land, whose appointment is an annual salary of one hundred pounds proclamation out of the quit-rents. The command∣ant at Oswego is generally a commissioner. The office would probably have been more advantageous than it has been, if the commissioners were not traders themselves, than which nothing is more ignoble in the judgment of the Indians. Sir William Johnson is at present the sole commis∣sioner, and within nine months after the arrival of gene∣ral Braddock, received 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling to secure the Indi∣an interest.</NOTE>, who wrote to mr. Hunter,
<PB N="170" REF="024800_0165_0FCD63AC38501B70"/>acquainting him of their dissatisfaction. The letter was laid before the house; but no effectual step taken to pre∣vent the mischief, till the passing of this act, which sub∣jected the traders to a forfeiture of the effects sold, and the penalty of one hundred pounds. Mr. Burnet's scheme was to draw the Indian trade into our own hands; to obstruct the communication of the French with our allies, which gave them frequent opportunities of seducing them from their fidelity; and to regain the Caghnuagas, who became interested in their disaffection, by being the carriers be∣tween Albany and Montreal. Among those who were more immediately prejudiced by this new regulation, the im∣porters of those goods, from Europe, were the chief; and hence the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring of their opposition to the governor.</P>
<P>All possible arts were used, both here and at home, to preserve the good temper of the assembly. Brigadier Hunter gave the ministry such favourable accounts of the members, that colonel Schuyler, during his presidentship, had orders from mr. secretary Craggs, neither to dissolve them him∣self, nor permit them to be dissolved; and at the spring session, in the year 1721, mr. Burnet informed them, that his continuance of them, was highly approved at home.
<PB N="171" REF="024800_0166_0FCD63AD8D15C6F8"/>Horatio Walpole, the auditor-general, who had appointed mr. Clarke for his deputy, thought this a favourable con∣juncture, for procuring five per cent. out of the treasury. But the house was averse to his application; and on the 2d of June, Abcaham Depeyster, jun. was appointed trea∣surer by the speaker's warrant, with the consent of the go∣vernor, in the room of his father, who was infirm; upon which he entered into a recognizance of 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the king, before a judge of the supreme court, for the faithful execution of his trust, which was lodged in the secretary's office. The house at the same time, in an address, declared their willingness that the treasurer should account; but utterly refused to admit of any drafts upon the treasu∣ry, for the auditor-general, who was constrained to de∣pend entirely upon the revenue, out of which he received about 200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P>Mr. Burnet being well acquainted with the geography of the country, wisely concluded, that it was to the last de∣gree necessary to get the command of the great lake Onta∣rio, as well for the benefit of the trade, and the security of the friendship of the five nations, as to frustrate the French designs, of confining the English colonies to narrow limits, along the sea coast, by a chain of forts on the great passes from Canada to Louisania. Towards the subversion of this scheme, he began the erection of a trading house at Oswe∣go, in the county of the Senecas, in 1722; and recom∣mended a provision for the residence of trusty persons a∣mong them, and the Onondagas, which last possess the cen∣tre of the five cantons. This year was remarkable for a con∣gress of several governors and commissioners, on the renew∣al of the ancient friendship with the Indians at Albany, Mr. Burnet prevailed upon them to send a message, to threaten the eastern Indians with a war, unless they concluded a peace with the English, who were very much harrassed by their frequent irruptions. On the 20th of May, in the year following, the confederates were augmented by their reception of above eighty Nicariagas, besides women and children, as they had been formerly, by the addition of the Tuscaroras. The country of the Nicariagas was on the north side of Missilimakinack; but the Tuscaroras possessed a tract of land near the sources of James's river, in Virginia, from whence the encroachments of the English induced them to remove, and settle near the south-east end of the Oneyda lake.</P>
<P>The strict union subsisting, between the several branches of the legislature, gave a handle to mr. Burnet's enemies to ex∣cite
<PB N="172" REF="024800_0167_0FCD63B2A55AAEE0"/>a clamour against him. Jealousies were industriously sown in the breasts of the people. The continuance of an assembly, after the accession of a new governor, was represented as an anti-constitutional project: and though the affairs of the pub∣lic were conducted with wisdom and spirit, many were so much imposed upon, that a rupture between the governor and the assembly was thought to be absolutely necessary for the weal and safety of the community. But this was not the on∣ly stratagem of those who were disaffected by the prohi∣bition of the French trade. The London merchants were induced to petition the king for an order to his governor, prohibiting the revival of the act made against it, or the passing any new law of that tendency. The petition was referred to the board of trade, and backed before their lord∣ships, with suggestions of the most notorious falsehoods. The lords of trade prudently advised, that no such direc∣tions should be sent to mr. Burnet, till he had an opportuni∣ty of answering the objections against the act. They were accordingly sent over to him, and he laid them before his council. Dr. Colden and mr. Alexander exerted themselves in a memorable report in answer to them, which drew upon them the resentment of several merchants here, who had first excited the London petition, and laid the foun∣dation for a variance between their families, which has manifested itself on many occasions. In justice to mr. Bur∣not's memory, and to show the propriety of his measures for obstructing the French trade, I cannot refrain the re∣publication of the council's report at full length.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your excellency's commands, in council, the 29th of October, referring to us a petition of se∣veral merchants in London, presented to the king's most excellent majesty, against renewing an act passed in this province, entitled, "An act for encouragement of the In∣dian trade, and rendering it more effectual to the inhabi∣tants of this province, and for prohibiting the selling of In∣dian goods to the French:" as likewise the several allega∣tions of the said merchants before the right honourable the lords of trade and plantations, we beg leave to make the following remarks.</P>
<P>In order to make our observations the more distinct and clear, we shall gather together the several assertions of the said merchants, both in their petition, and delivered ver∣bally before the lords of trade, as to the situation of this province, with respect to the French and Indian nations;
<PB N="173" REF="024800_0168_0FCD63B38D0B91B0"/>and observe on them, in the first place, they being the foundation on which all their other allegations are ground∣ed. Afterwards we shall lay before your excellency, what we think necessary to observe, on the other parts of the said petition, in the order they are in the petition, or in the re∣port of the lords of trade.</P>
<P>In their geographical accounts they say, "Besides the nations of Indians that are in the English interest, there are very many nations of Indians, who are at present in the interest of the French, and who lie between New York and the nations of Indians in the English interest. The French and their Indians would not permit the English In∣dians to pass over by their forts." The said act "restrains them (the five nations) from a free commerce with the in∣habitants of New York."</P>
<P>The five Indian nations are settled upon the banks of the river St. Lawrence, directly opposite to Quebec, two or three hundred leagues distant from the nearest British settlements in New York."</P>
<P>They (the five nations of Indians) were two or three hundred leagues distant from Albany; and that they could not come to trade with the English, but by going down the river St. Lawrence, and from thence through a lake, which brought them within eighteen leagues of Albany."</P>
<P>These things the merchants have thought it safe for them, and consistent with their duty to his sacred majesty, to say in his majesty's presence, and to repeat them after∣wards before the right honourable the lords of trade, though nothing can be more directly contrary to the truth. For there are no nations of Indians between New York and the nations of Indians in the English interest, who are now six in number, by the addition of the Tuscaroras. The Mohawks (called Annies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agnies.</NOTE> by the French) one of the five nations, live on the south side of a branch of Hudson's ri∣ver, (not on the north side, as they are placed in the French maps) and but forty miles directly west from Albany, and within the English settlements; some of the English farms, upon the same river, being thirty miles further west. The Oneydas (the next of the five nations) lie like∣wise west from Albany, near the head of the Mohawk's ri∣ver, about one hundred miles from Albany. The Ononda∣gas lie about one hundred and thirty miles west from Al∣bany; and the Tuscaroras live partly with the Oneydas, and
<PB N="174" REF="024800_0169_0FCD63B50D47D378"/>partly with the Onondagas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De L'Isle.</NOTE>. The Cayugas are about one hundred and sixty miles from Albany; and the Senecas, (the furthest of all these nations,) are not above two hun∣dred and forty miles from Albany, as may appear from mr. de L'Isle's map of Louisania, who lays down the five nations under the name of Iroquois: and goods are daily carried, from this province, to the Senecas, as well as to those nations that lie nearer, by water, all the way, except three miles (or, in the dry seasons, five miles) where the traders carry over land between the Mohawk's river and the Wood creek, which runs into the Oneyda's lake, without going near either St. Lawrenceriver, or any of the lakes upon which the French pass, which are entirely out of their way.</P>
<P>The nearest French forts, or settlements, to Albany, are Chambly, and Montreal, both of them lying about north and by east from Albany, and are near two hundred miles distant from it. Quebec lies about three hundred and eighty miles north-east from Albany. So far is it from being true, that the five nations are situated upon the banks of the river St. Lawrence, opposite to Quebec, that Albany lies almost directly between Quebec and the five nations. And to say that these Indians cannot come to trade at Al∣bany, but by going down the river St. Lawrence, and then into a lake eighteen leagues from Albany (we suppose they mean lake Champlain) passing by the French forts, is to the same purpose as if they should say, that one cannot go from London to Bristol, but way of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Before we go on to observe other particulars, we beg leave further to remark, that it is so far from being true, that the Indians in the French interest, lie between New-York and our five nations of Indians; that some of our nations of Indians lie between the French and the Indians, from whence the French bring the far greatest quantity of their furs: for the Senecas (whom the French call Sonon∣touons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isonnontouans.</NOTE>) are situated between lake Erie and Cadaracqui lake, (called by the French, Ontario) near the great fall of Iagara<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sometimes Oniagara, Ochniagara, but commonly Nia∣gara.</NOTE>, by which all the Indians that live round lake Erie, round the lake of the Hurons, round the lake of the Illinois, or Michegan, and round the great upper lake,
<PB N="175" REF="024800_0170_0FCD63B68E749790"/>generally pass in their way to Canada. All the Indians situ∣ated upon the branches of the Mississippi, must likewise pass by the same place, if they go to Canada. And all of them, likewise, in their way to Canada, pass by our trad∣ing-place upon the Cadaracqui lake, at the mouth of the Onondaga river. The nearest and safest way of carrying goods upon the Cadaracqui lake, towards Canada, being along the south side of that lake, (near where our Indians are settled, and our trade of late is fixed) and not by the north side and Cadaracqui, or Frontenac fort, where the French are settled.</P>
<P>Now that we have represented to your excellency, that not one word of the geography of these merchants is true, upon which all their reasoning is founded; it might seem needless to trouble your excellency with any further re∣marks, were it not to show with what earnestness they are promoting the French interest, to the prejudice of all his majesty's colonies in North-America, and that they are not ashamed of asserting any thing for that end, even in the royal presence.</P>
<P>First they say, "That by the act passed in this province, entitled, 'An act for the encouragement of the Indian trade, &amp;c.' all trade whatsoever is prohibited in the strictest man∣ner, and under the severest penalties, between the inhabi∣tants of New-York government, and the French of Ca∣nada."</P>
<P>This is not true; for only carrying goods to the French, which are proper for the Indian trade, is prohibited. The trade, as to other things, is left in the same state it was be∣fore that act was made, as it will appear to any person that shall read it: and there are, yearly, large quantities of other goods, openly, carried to Canada, without any hindrance from the government of New-York. Whatever may be said of the severity and penalties in that act, they are found in∣sufficient to deter some from carrying goods clandestinely to the French; and the legislature of this province are con∣vinced, that no penalties can be too severe, to prevent a trade, which puts the safety of all his majesty's subjects of North America in the greatest danger.</P>
<P>Their next assertion is, "All the Indian goods have by this act been raised 25<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 30<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per cent." This is the only allegation in the whole petition that there is any ground for. Nevertheless, though the common channel of trade cannot be altered without some detriment to it in the be∣ginning; we are assured from the custom-house books, that there has been every year, since the passing of this act, more
<PB N="176" REF="024800_0171_0FCD63BB13DB6B78"/>furs exported from New-York, than in the year immedi∣ately before the passing of this act. It is not probable that the greatest difference between the exportation, any year before this act, and any year since, could so much alter the price of beaver, as it is found to be this last year. Beaver is carried to Britain from other parts besides New-York, and it is certain that the price of beaver is not so much al∣tered here by the quantity in our market, as by the de∣mand for it in Britain. But as we cannot be so well inform∣ed here, what occasions beaver to be in greater demand in Britain, we must leave that to be enquired after in England. However, we are fully satisfied, that it will be found to be for very different reasons from what the merchants allege.</P>
<P>The merchants go on and say, "Whereas, on the other hand, this branch of the New-York trade, by the discour∣agements brought upon it by this act, is almost wholly en∣grossed by the French, who have already by this act, been encouraged to send proper European goods to Canada, to carry on this trade, so that should this act be continued, the New-York trade, which is very considerable, must be wholly lost to us, and centre in the French.—Though New-York should not furnish them, the French would find an∣other way to be supplied therewith, either from some other of his majesty's plantations, or, it might be, directly from Europe.—Many of the goods, which the Indians want, being as easy to be had directly from France or Hol∣land, as from Great-Britain."</P>
<P>This is easily answered, by informing your excellency, that the principal of the goods proper for the Indian mar∣ket, are only of the manufactures of Great-Britain, or of the British plantations, viz. strouds, or stroud-waters, and other woolens, and rum.—The French must be obliged to buy all their woolens (the strouds especially) in Eng∣land, and thence carry them to France, in order to their transportation to Canada.</P>
<P>The voyage to Quebec, through the bay of St. Law∣rence, is well known to be the most dangerous of any in the world, and only practicable in the summer months. The French have no commodities in Canada, by reason of the cold and barrenness of the soil, proper for the West India markets; and therefore have no rum but by vessels from France, that touch at their islands in the West Indies. New-York has, by reason of its situation, both as to the sea and the Indians, every way the advantage of Canada. The New-York vessels make always two voyages in a year from Eng∣land, one in summer, and another in winter, and several
<PB N="177" REF="024800_0172_0FCD63BC917CEDC0"/>voyages in a year to the West-Indies. It is manifest, there∣fore, that it is not in the power of the French to import any goods near so cheap, to Canada, as they are imported to New-York.</P>
<P>But to put this out of all controversy, we need only observe to your excellency, that strouds (without which no considerable trade can be carried on with the Indians) are sold at Albany for 10<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a piece: they were sold at Mon∣treal, before this act took place, at 13<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> and now they are sold there for 25<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards; which is an evi∣dent proof, that the French have not, in these four years time, (during the continuance of this act) found out any other way to supply themselves with strouds; and likewise that they cannot trade without them, seeing they buy them at so extravagant a price.</P>
<P>It likewise appears, that none of the neighbouring co∣lonies have been able to supply the French with these goods; and those, that know the geography of the coun∣try, know it is impracticable to do it at any tolerable rate, because they must carry their goods ten times further by land than we need to do.</P>
<P>We are likewise assured, that the merchants of Mon∣treal lately told mr. Vaudreuil, their governor, that if the trade from Albany be not by some mean or other encour∣aged, they must abandon that settlement. We have reason, therefore, to suspect, that these merchants (at least some of them) have been practised upon by the French agents in Lon∣don: for no doubt, the French will leave no method un∣tried to defeat the present designs of this government, see∣ing they are more afraid of the consequences of this trade between New-York and the Indians, than of all the warlike expeditions that ever were attempted against Canada.</P>
<P>But to return to the petitioners. "They conceive nothing can tend more to the withdrawing the affections of the five nations of Indians from the English interest, than the continuance of the said act, which in its effects restrains them from a free commerce with the inhabitants of New-York, and may too probably estrange them from the Eng∣lish interest; whereas, by a freedom of commerce, and an encouraged intercourse of trade with the French and their Indians, the English interest might, in time, be greatly im∣proved and strengthened."</P>
<P>It seems to us a strange argument to say, that an act, the whole purport of which is to encourage our own peo∣ple to go among the Indians, and to draw the far Indians through our Indian country to Albany (and which has truly
<PB N="178" REF="024800_0173_0FCD63BFB41469A8"/>produced these effects) would, on the contrary, restrain them from a free commerce with the inhabitants of New-York, and may too probably estrange them from the Eng∣lish interest; and therefore that it would be much wiser in us, to make use of the French, to promote the English in∣terest; and for which end, we ought to encourage a free intercourse between them and our Indians. The reverse of this is exactly true, in the opinion of our five nations; who, in all their public treaties with this government, have represented against this trade, as the building the French forts with English strouds: that the encouraging a free∣dom of commerce with our Indians and the Indians round them, who must pass through their country to Albany, would certainly increase both the English interest and theirs, among all the nations to the westward of them; and that the carrying the Indian market to Montreal in Canada, draws all the far Indians thither.</P>
<P>The last thing we have to take notice of, is what the merchants asserted before the lords of trade, viz. "That there has not been half the quantity of European goods ex∣ported since the passing of this act, that used to be."—'We are well assured, that this is no better grounded than the above facts they assert with the same positiveness. For it is well known, almost to every person in New-York, that there has not been a less, but rather a greater quantity of European goods imported into this place, since the passing of this act, than was at any time before it, in the same space of time. As this appears by the manifests in the custom-house here, the same may likewise be easily proved by the cus∣tom-house books in London.</P>
<P>As all the arguments of the merchants run upon the ill effects this act has had upon the trade and the minds of the Indians, every one of which we have shown to be asserted, without the least foundation to support them; there nothing now remains, but to show the good effects this act has produced, which are so notorious in this province, that we know not one person that now opens his mouth against the act.</P>
<P>Before this act passed, none of the people of this pro∣vince travelled into the Indian countries to trade. We have now above forty young men, who have been several times as far as the lakes a trading, and thereby become well acquaint∣ed, not only with the trade of the Indians, but likewise with their manners and languages; and those have returned with such large quantities of furs, that greater numbers are resolved to follow their example; so that we have good
<PB N="179" REF="024800_0174_0FCD63BE10A0C278"/>reason to hope, that in a little time, the English will draw the whole Indian trade of the inland countries to Albany, and into the country of the five nations. This government has built a public trading house upon Cadaracqui lake, at Irondequat in the Senecas land, and another is to be built, next spring, at the mouth of the Onondagas river. All the far Indians pass by these places, in their way to Canada; and they are not above half so far from the English settle∣ments, as they are from the French.</P>
<P>So far is it from being true what the merchants say, "That the French sorts interrupt all communication be∣tween the Indians and the English;" that if these places be well supported, as they easily can be from our settlements, in case of a rupture with the French, it will be in the pow∣er of this province, to intercept the greatest part of the trade between Canada and the Indians round the lakes and the branches of the Mississippi.—Since this act passed, many nations have come to Albany to trade, and peace and friend∣ship, whose names had not so much as been heard of a∣mong us.—In the beginning of May, 1723, a nation of In∣dians came to Albany, singing and dancing, with their ca∣lumets before them, as they always do when they come to any place, where they have not been before. We do not find that the commissioners of Indian affairs, were able to inform themselves what nation this was.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the same month, eighty men, be∣sides the women and children, came to Albany in the same manner. These had one of our five nations with them for an interpreter, by whom they informed the commissioners, that they were of a great nation, called Nehkereages, con∣sisting of six castles and tribes; and that they lived near a place called by the French, Missimakinah, between the up∣per lake and the lake of the Hurons. These Indians not only desired a free commerce, but likewise to enter into a strict league of friendship with us and our six nations, that they might be accounted the seventh nation in the league: and being received accordingly, they left their calumet as a pledge of their fidelity. In June, another nation ar∣rived, but from what part of the continent we have not learned.</P>
<P>In July, the Twightwies arrived, and brought an In∣dian interpreter of our nations with them, who told, that they were called by the French Miamies, and that they live upon one of the branches of the river Mississippi.—At the same time, some of the Tahsagrondie Indians, who live be∣tween lake Erie and the lake Hurons, near a French settle∣ment,
<PB N="180" REF="024800_0175_0FCD63C48ABA6620"/>did come and renew their league with the English, nor durst the French hinder them.—In July this year, an∣other nation came, whose situation and name we know not; and in August and September, several parties of the same Indians, that had been here last year: but the greatest numbers of these far Indians have been met this year in the Indian country by our traders, every one of them endea∣vouring to get before another, in order to reap the profits of so advantageous a trade, which has all this summer long, kept about forty traders constantly employed, in going be∣tween our trading-places, in our Indian country, and Al∣bany.</P>
<P>All these nations of Indians, who came to Albany, said, that the French had told them many strange stories of the English, and did what they could, to hinder their coming to Albany; but that they had resolved to break through by force. The difference on this score between the Tahsa∣grondie Indians and the French (who have a fort and set∣tlement there, called by them le Detroit) rose to that height, this summer, that mr. Tonti, who commanded there, thought it proper to retire, and return to Canada with many of his men.</P>
<P>We are, for these reasons, well assured, that this year there will be more beaver exported for Great Britain, than ever was from this province in one year; and that if the custom-house books at London be looked into, it will be found, that there will be a far greater quantity of goods for the Indians (strouds especially) sent over next spring, than ever was at any one time to this province. For the mer∣chants here tell us, that they have at this time ordered more of these goods, than ever was done at any one time before.</P>
<P>These matters of fact prove, beyond contradiction, that this act has been of the greatest service to New-York, in making us acquainted with many nations of Indians, for∣merly entirely unknown, and strangers, to us; withdraw∣ing them from their dependence upon the French, and in uniting them to us and our Indians, by means of trade and mutual offices of friendship.—Of what great consequence this may be to the British interest in general, as to trade, is apparent to any body. It is no less apparent, likewise, that it is of the greatest consequence to the safety of all the Bri∣tish colonies in North America. We feel, too sensibly, the ill effects of the French interest in the present war betwixt New England, and only one nation of Indians supported by the French. Of what dismal consequences then might it be, if the French should be able to influence, in the same
<PB N="181" REF="024800_0176_0FCD63C5903F0AD8"/>manner, so many and such numerous nations, as lie to the westward of this province, Pennsylvania, and Maryland? On the other hand, if all these nations (who assert their own freedom, and declare themselves friends to those that sup∣ply them best with what they want) be brought to have a dependence upon the English (as we have good reason to hope in a short time they will) the French of Canada, in case of a war, must be at the mercy of the English.</P>
<P>To these advantages must be added, that many of our young men having been induced by this act to travel a∣mong the Indians, they learn their manners, their lan∣guages, and the situation of all their countries, and become inured to all manner of fatigues and hardships: and a great many more being resolved to follow their example, these young men, in case of war with the Indians, will be of ten times the service, that the same number of the common mili∣tia can be of.—The effects of this act have likewise so much quieted the minds of the people, with respect to the secu∣rity of the frontiers, that our settlements are now extend∣ed above thirty miles further west towards the Indian coun∣tries, than they were before it passed.</P>
<P>The only thing that now remains to answer, is an ob∣jection which we suppose may be made, what can induce the merchants of London to petition against an act, which will be really so much for their interest in the end? The reason is, in all probability, because they only consider their present gain; and that they are not at all concerned for the safety of this country, in encouraging the most necessary undertaking, if they apprehend their profit for two or three years may be lessened by it. This inclination of the mer∣chants has been so notorious, that few nations at war with their neighbours, have been able to restrain them from sup∣plying their enemies with ammunition and arms. The count d'Estrade, in his letters in 1638, says, that when the Dutch were besieging Antwerp, one Beiland, who had load∣ed four fly-boats with arms and powder for Antwerp, being taken up by the prince of Orange's order, and examined at Amsterdam, said boldly, that the burghers of Amsterdam had a right to trade every where: that he could name a hundred that were factors for the merchants at Antwerp, and that he was one. "That trade cannot be interrupted, and that for his part he was very free to own, that if to get any thing by trade, it were necessary to pass through hell, he would venture to burn his sails." 'When this principle, so common to merchants, is considered, and that some in
<PB N="182" REF="024800_0177_0FCD63C752A44B08"/>this place have got estates by trading many years to Canada, it is not to be wondered, that they have acted as factors for Canada in this affair, and that they have transmitted such accounts to their correspondents in London, as are consistent with the trust reposed in them by the merchants of Ca∣nada.</P>
<P>In the last place, we are humbly of opinion, that it may be proper to print the petition of the merchants of Lon∣don, and their allegations before the lords of trade, toge∣ther with the answers your committee has made thereto, in vindication of the legislature of this province, of which we have the honour to be a part, if your excellency shall approve of our answers; that what we have said may be exposed to the examination of every one in this place, where the truth of the matters of fact is best known, and that the correspondents of these merchants may have the most pub∣lic notice to reply, if they shall think it proper, or to dis∣own, in a public manner, that they are the authors of such groundless informations.

<P>Governor Burnet transmitted this report to the board of trade; and it had the intended effect. About the latter end of the year 1724, and unfortunate dispute commenced in the French church, of which, because it had no small influ∣ence on the public affairs of the government, I shall lay be∣fore the reader a short account.</P>
<P>The persecutions in France, which ensued upon the re∣vocation of the edict of Nantz, drove the protestant sub∣jects of Louis XIV. into the territories of other princes. Many of them fled even into this province: the most opu∣lent settled in the city of New-York; others went into the country, and planted New Rochelle; and a few seated themselves at the New Paltz in Ulster county. Those, who resided in New-York, soon erected a church, upon the principles and model of that in Geneva; and by their growth and foreign accessions, formed a congregation, for numbers and riches, superior to all but the Dutch. They had two ministers; Rou, the first called, was a man of
<PB N="183" REF="024800_0178_0FCD63C89FB032A8"/>learning, but proud, pleasurable, and passionate. Mouli∣naars, his colleague, was most distinguished for his pacific spirit, dull parts, and unblameable life and conversation. Rou despised his fellow labourer, and, for a long time, commanded the whole congregation, by the superiority of his talents for the pulpit. The other, impatient of repeat∣ed affronts and open contempt, raised a party in his fa∣vour, and this year succeeded in the election of a set of el∣ders, disposed to humble the delinquent. Rou, being suspi∣cious of the design, refused to acknowledge them duly elected. Incensed at this conduct, they entered an act in their minutes, dismissing him from the pastoral charge of the church, and procured a ratification of the act under the hands of the majority of the people. Governor Burnet had, long before this time, admitted Rou into his familiarity, on the score of his learning: and that consideration encourag∣ed a petition to him, from Rou's adherents, complaining a∣gainst the elders. The matter was then referred to a com∣mittee of the council, who advised that the congregation should be admonished, to bring their differences to an ami∣cable conclusion. Some overtures, to that end, were at∣tempted; and the elders offered to submit the controver∣sy to the Dutch ministers. But Rou, who knew that the French church in this country, without a synod was unor∣ganized, and could not restrain him, chose rather to bring his bill in chancery before the governor.</P>
<P>Mr. Alexander was his council; and mr. Smith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These gentlemen came into the colony in the same ship in 1715. The latter was born at Newport Pagnel, in Buck∣inghamshire. They were among the principal agents in the political struggles during the administration of col. Cosby.</NOTE>, a young lawyer, of the first reputation as a speaker, appeared for the elders. He pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, in∣sisting that the matter was entirely ecclesiastical, and, in the prosecution of his argument, entered largely into an ex∣amination of the government of the protestant churches in France. According to which, he showed, that the consistory were the proper judges of the point in dispute, in the first instance; and that from thence an appeal lay to a collogue, next to a provincial, and last of all to a national synod. Mr. Burnet nevertheless over-ruled the plea; and the defen∣dants, being fearful of a decree, that might expose their own estates to the payment of Rou's salary, thought it ad∣viseable
<PB N="184" REF="024800_0179_0FCD57FB364186C0"/>to drop their debates, reinstate the minister, and leave the church.</P>
<P>All those, who opposed Rou, were disobliged with the governor: among these mr. de Lancey was the most con∣siderable for his wealth and popular influence. He was very rigid in his religious profession, one of the first builders, and by far the most generous benefactor, of the French church; and therefore left it with the utmost reluctance. Mr. Burnet, before this time, had considered him as his enemy, because he had opposed the prohibition of the French trade; and this led him into a step, which, as it was a personal indignity, mr. de Lancey could never recol∣lect without resentment. This gentleman was returned for the city of New-York, in the room of a deceased member, at the meeting of the assembly in September 1725. When he offered himself for the oaths, mr. Burnet asked him how he became a subject of the crown? He answered, that he was denizened in England: and his excellency dismissed him, taking time to consider the matter. Mr. de Lancey then laid before the house an act of a notary public, certi∣fying that he was named in a patent of denization, grant∣ed in the reign of James the second—a patent of the same kind, under the great seal of this province, in 1686—and two certificates, one of his having taken the oath of alle∣giance, according to an act passed here in 1683, and another of his serving in several former assemblies. The governor, in the mean time, consulted the chief justice, and trans∣mitted his opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What colonel Morris's opinion was, I have not been able to discover. Governor Burnet's conduct was thought to be unconstitutional, and an invasion of the rights of the assembly, who claim the exclusive privilege of determining the qualifications of their own members.</NOTE> to the house, who resolved in favour of mr. de Lancey. Several other new representatives came in, at this session, upon the decease of the old members; and Adolph Philipse, who was sometime before dismissed from the council board, was elected into the speaker's chair, in the absence of mr. Livingston. The majority, however, continued in the interest of the governor; and consented to the revival of the several acts, which had been passed for prohibiting the French trade; which, in spite of all the restraints laid upon it, was clandestinely carried on by the people of Albany. Oswego, nevertheless, grew
<PB N="185" REF="024800_0180_0FCD63CE31D57A10"/>considerable for its commerce: fifty-seven canoes went there this summer, and returned with seven hundred and thirty-eight packs of beaver and deer skins.</P>
<P>Nothing could more naturally excite the jealousy of the French, than the erection of the new trading house at the mouth of the Onondaga river. Fearful of losing a profitable trade, which they had almost entirely engrossed, and the command of the lake Ontario, they launched two vessels in it in 1726, and transported materials, for building a large store-house, and repairing the fort at Niagara. The scheme was not only to secure to themselves the entrance into the west end of the lake, as they already had the east, by the fraudulent erection of sort Frontenac, many years before; but also to carry their trade more westerly, and thus render Oswego useless, by shortening the travels of the western Indians, near two hundred miles. Baron de Lon∣guiel, who had the chief command in Canada, on the death of the marquis de Vaudreuil, in October 1725, was so in∣tent upon this project, that he went, in person, to the On∣ondaga canton, for leave to raise the store-house at Nia∣gara: and as those Indians were most of all exposed to the intrigues of the jesuits, who constantly resided amongst them, he prevailed upon them by fraud and false repre∣sentations, to consent to it, for their protection against the English. But as soon as this matter was made known to the other nations, they declared the permission granted by the Onondagas to be absolutely void; and sent deputies to Nia∣gara, with a message, signifying that the country, in which they were at work, belonged solely to the Senecas; and required them immediately to desist. The French, notwith∣standing, were regardless of the embassage, and pushed on their enterprise with all possible dispatch, while Joncaire exerted all his address among the Indians, to prevent the demolition of the works. Canada was very much indebted to the incessant intrigues of this man. He had been adopted by the Senecas, and was well esteemed by the Onondagas. He spoke the Indian language, as Charlevoix informs us, "avec la plus sublime eloquence Iroquoise," and had lived amongst them, after their manner, from the beginning of queen Anne's reign. All these advantages he improved for the interest of his country; he facilitated the missiona∣ries in their progress through the cantons, and more than any man contributed to render their dependence upon the English, weak and precarious. Convinced of this, colonel Schuyler urged the Indians, at his treaty with them, in
<PB N="186" REF="024800_0181_0FCD63CF5AEB8E48"/>1719, to drive Joncaire out of their country; but his en∣deavours were fruitless<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same thing has since been frequently laboured, but to no purpose. His son continued the course of intrigues begun by the father, till general Shirley, while he was at Oswego in 1755, prevailed upon the Senecas to order him to Canada.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The jesuit Charlevoix does honour to mr. Burnet, in de∣claring that he left no stone unturned, to defeat the French designs at Niagara. Nor is it much to be wondered at. For besides supplanting his favourite trade at Oswego, it tended to the defection of the five nations; and in case of a rup∣ture, exposed the frontiers of our southern colonies to the ravages of the French and their allies. Mr. Burnet, upon whom these considerations made the deepest impression, laid the matter before the house—remonstrated against the proceedings to Longuiel in Canada—wrote to the ministry in England, who complained of them to the French court—and met the confederates at Albany, endeavouring to convince them of the danger they, themselves, would be in, from an aspiring, ambitious neighbour. He spoke first about the affair, privately to the sachems, and afterwards, in the public conference, informed them of all the encroach∣ments which the French had made upon their fathers, and the ill usage they had met with, according to la Potherie's account, published with the privilege of the French king, at Paris, in 1722. He then reminded them of the kind treat∣ment they had received from the English, who constantly fed and cloathed them, and never attempted any act of hostilities to their prejudice. This speech was extremely well drawn, the thoughts being conceived in strong figures, particularly expressive and agreeable to the Indians. The governor required an explicit declaration of their senti∣ments, concerning the French transactions at Niagara; and their answer was truly categorical. "We speak now in the name of all the six nations, and come to you howling. This is the reason why we howl, that the governor of Canada encroaches on our land, and builds thereon." After which they intreated him to write to the king for succour. Mr. Burnet embraced this favourable opportunity to procure from them a deed, surrendering their country to his majes∣ty, to be protected for their use, and confirming their grant in 1701, concerning which there was only an entry in
<PB N="187" REF="024800_0182_0FCD63D0D0506828"/>the books of the secretary for Indian affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the territories at the west end of lake Erie, and on the north side of that, and the lake Ontario, which were ceded in 1701; the Indians now granted, for the same purpose, all their habitations from Oswego to Cayahoga river, which disembogues into lake Erie, and the country extending sixty miles from the southermost banks of those lakes. Though the first surrender, through negligence, was not made by the execution of a formal deed under seal; yet as it was transacted with all the solemnity of a treaty, and as the second surrender confirms the first, no intermedi∣ate possession by the French, can prejudice the British title derived by the cession in 1701.</NOTE>. It happened very unfortunately, that his excellency's hands were then more weakened than ever, by the growing disaffection in the house. The intrigues of his adversaries, and the fre∣quent deaths of the members, had introduced such a change in the assembly, that it was with difficulty he pro∣cured a three years support. The clamours of the people ran so high without doors for a new election, that he was obliged to dissolve the house, and soon after another disso∣lution ensued on the death of the king. The French, in the mean time, completed their works at Niagara: and mr. Bur∣net, who was unable to do any thing else, erected a fort, in 1727, for the protection of the post and trade at Oswego. This necessary undertaking was pregnant with the most im∣portant consequences, not only to this, but all our colonies; and though the governor's seasonable activity deserved the highest testimonials of our gratitude, I am ashamed to con∣fess, what I am bound to relate, that he built the fort at his private expense, and that a balance of about 56<ABBR>l.</ABBR> principal, though frequently demanded, remains due to his estate to this very day.</P>
<P>Beauharnois, the governor of Canada, who superseded Longuiel, was so incensed at the building of the fort, that he sent a written summons in July, to the officer posted there, to abandon it; and though his predecessor had done the same, a little before, at Niagara, in the country of the Senecas, the acknowledged subjects of the British crown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Though the sovereignty over the five nations was ceded to Great Britain, and Charlevoix himself had ac∣knowledged that Niagara was part of their country, yet the pious jesuit applauds the French settlement there, which was so manifest an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht. The marquis de Nonville, in his letter to the court of France, in 1686, proposed the erection of a fort there, to secure the communication with the lakes, and deprive us of a trade which he computed to be worth 400,000 francs per annum. Charlevoix, perhaps, considered these advantages sufficient to justify the violation of public faith; reasoning upon the principles of le chevalier de Callieres, who thought the legality of making a conquest of New York, during the strict peace in James IId's reign, might be infer∣red from the benefit, that would, thereby, accrue to the French colony, <HI>"qu' il n'y avoit point d'autre voye pour con∣server la colonie, que de nous rendre maitres de la Nouvelle York; et que cette conquête etoit legitime par la necessité."</HI></NOTE>,
<PB N="188" REF="024800_0183_0FCD63D281527870"/>yet, with a singular effrontery, he dispatched de la Chas∣saigne, a man of parts, and governor of Trois Rivieres, to New York, with the strongest complaints to mr. Burnet upon that head. His excellency sent him a polite, but re∣solute answer, on the eighth of August; in which he re∣futed the arguments urged by the French governor gene∣ral; and remonstrated against the proceedings of the last year at Niagara.</P>
<P>The new assembly met in September 1727, and consisted of members all ill affected to the governor. The long continuance of the last, the clamours which were excited by several late important decrees in chancery, the affair of the French church, and especially the prohibiting the Cana∣da trade, were the causes, to which the loss of his interest is to be ascribed. Mr. Philipse, the speaker, was piqued at a decree in chancery against himself, which very much affected his estate; no wonder, then, that the members, who were very much influenced by him, came, on the 25th of November, into the following resolutions. Colonel Hicks, from the committee of grievances, reported, "That as well by the complaints of several people, as by the general cry of his majesty's subjects inhabiting this colony, they find that the court of chancery, as lately assumed to be set up here, renders the liberties and properties of the said sub∣jects extremely precarious; and that by the violent mea∣sures taken in, and allowed by it, some have been ruined, others obliged to abandon the colony, and many restrained in it, either by imprisonment or by excessive bail exacted from them not to depart, even when no manner of suits are depending against them: and therefore are of opinion,
<PB N="189" REF="024800_0184_0FCD63D3CBF821F8"/>that the extraordinary proceedings of that court; and the exorbitant fees and charges, countenanced to be exacted by the officers and practitioners thereof, are the greatest grievance and oppression this colony hath ever felt: and that for removing the fatal consequences thereof, they had come to several resolutions, which being read, were ap∣proved by the house, and are as follow:</P>
<P>"Resolved, that the erecting or exercising, in this colo∣ny, a court of equity or chancery (however it may be term∣ed) without consent in general assembly, is unwarrantable, and contrary to the laws of England, and a manifest op∣pression and grievance to the subjects, and of pernicious consequence to their liberties and properties.</P>
<P>"Resolved, that this house will at their next meeting prepare and pass an act to declare and adjudge all orders, ordinances, devices, and proceedings, of the court, so as∣sumed to be erected and exercised as abovementioned, to be illegal, null, and void, as by law and right they ought to be.</P>
<P>"Resolved, that this house, at the same time, will take into consideration, whether it be necessary, to establish a court of equity or chancery, in this colony; in whom the jurisdiction thereof ought to be vested; and how far the powers of it shall be prescribed and limited."</P>
<P>Mr. Burnet no sooner heard of these votes, than he cal∣led the members before him, and dissolved the assembly. They occasioned, however, an ordinance in the spring fol∣lowing, as well to remedy sundry abuses in the practice in chancery, as to reduce the fees of that court, which, on account of the popular clamours, were so much diminished, that the wheels of the chancery have ever since rusted upon their axes, the practice being contemned by all gentlemen of eminence in the profession.</P>
<P>We are now come to the close of mr. Burnet's admini∣stration, when he was appointed to the chief command of the Massachusett's bay. Though we never had a governor, to whom the colony is so much indebted as to him; yet the influence of a faction, in the judgment of some, rendered his removal necessary for the public tranquillity. Insensible of his merit, the undistinguishing multitude were taught to consider it as a most fortunate event; and till the ambiti∣ous designs of the French king, with respect to America, awakened our attention to the general welfare, mr. Bur∣net's administration was as little esteemed, as that of the meanest of his predecessors.</P>
<P>He was very fond of New-York, and left it with reluc∣tance.
<PB N="190" REF="024800_0185_0FCD63D8D61AC870"/>His marriage here connected him with a numerous family; and, besides an universal acquaintance, there were some gentlemen, with whom he contracted a strict intimacy and friendship.</P>
<P>The excessive love of money, a disease common to all his predecessors, and to some who succeeded him, was a vice, from which he was entirely free. He sold no offices, nor at∣tempted to raise a fortune by indirect means; for he lived generously, and carried scarce any thing away with him, but his books. These, and the conversation of men of let∣ters, were to him inexhaustible sources of delight. His astro∣nomical observations have been useful; but by his comment on the apocalypse, he exposed himself, as other learned men have before him, to the criticisms of those who have not abilities to write half so well.</P>
<P>John Montgomerie, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> received the great seal of this province from mr. Burnet, on the 15th of April 1728, having a commission to supersede him here and in New-Jersey. The council board consisted of

<P>The governor was a Scotch gentleman, and bred a sol∣dier; but, in the latter part of his life, he had little con∣cern with arms, having served as groom of the bedcham∣ber, to his present majesty, before his accession to the throne. This station, and a seat he had in parliament, pa∣ved the way to his preferment in America. In his talents for government, he was much inferior to his predecessor; for he had neither strength nor acuteness of parts, and was but little acquainted with any kind of literature.</P>
<P>As in the natural, so in the political world, a violent storm is often immediately succeeded by a peaceful calm; tired by the mutual struggles of party rage, every man now ceased to act under its influence. The governor's good humour, too, extinguished the flames of contention; for being unable to plan, he had no particular scheme to pur∣sue; and thus by confining himself to the exercise of the common acts of government, our public affairs flowed on in a peaceful, uninterrupted stream.</P>
<P>The reader will, for this reason, find none of those
<PB N="191" REF="024800_0186_0FCD63D9D7552118"/>events in col. Montgomerie's short administration, which only take rise under the superintendency of a man of ex∣tensive views. Indeed, he devoted himself so much to his ease, that he has scarce left us any thing to perpetuate the remembrance of his time.</P>
<P>The two rocks upon which the public tranquillity was shipwrecked in the late administration, he carefully avoid∣ed; for he dissolved the assembly, called by his predeces∣sor, before they had ever been convened: and as to the chan∣cery, he himself countenanced the clamours against it, by declining to sit, till enjoined to exercise the office of chan∣cellor by special orders from England. He then obeyed the command, but not without discovering his reluctance, and modestly confessing to the practisers, that he thought himself unqualified for the station. Indeed the court of chancery was evidently his aversion, and he never gave a single decree in it, nor more than three orders; and these, both as to matter and form, were first settled by the coun∣cil concerned.</P>
<P>Mr. Philipse was chosen speaker of the assembly which met on the 23d of July, and continued sitting in perfect harmony till autumn. After his excellency had procured a five years support, and several other laws to his mind, of less considerable moment; he went up to Albany, and, on the 1st of October, held a treaty with the six nations, for a renewal of the ancient covenant. He gave them great presents, and engaged them in the defence of Oswego. Nothing could be more seasonable than this interview; for the French, who eyed that important garrison, and our in∣creasing trade there, with the most restless jealousy, pre∣pared, early in the spring following, to demolish the works. Governor Burnet gave the first intelligence of this design, in a letter to colonel Montgomerie, dated at Boston the 31st of March 1729. The garrison was thereupon im∣mediately reinforced by a detachment from the indepen∣dent companies; which, together with the declared reso∣lution of the Indians, to protect the fort; induced the French to desist from the intended invasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From that time, to the year 1754, this garrison was guarded only by a lieutenant and five and twenty men. Ge∣neral Shirley's parting from the forces destined against fort du Quesne, and proceeding with half the army to Os∣wego in 1755, was extremely fortunate to our colonies; the French being then determined and prepared to pos∣sess themselves of that post. Besides the vessels launched there, to secure the command of the lake, the general, be∣fore he returned to winter quarters, erected two strong square forts, with bastions, commanding as well the en∣trance into the Onondaga river, as the old fort; in the si∣tuation of which, little regard was had to any thing besides the pleasantness of the prospect.</NOTE>.</P>

Thus far our Indian affairs appeared to be under a tole∣rable direction; but these fair prospects were soon obscur∣ed by the king's repealing, on the 11th of December, 1729, all the acts which mr. Burnet, with so much labour and opposition, procured for the prohibition of an execrable trade between Albany and Montreal. To whose intrigues this event is to be ascribed, cannot be certainly determined. But that it was pregnant with the worst consequences, time has sufficiently evinced. Nothing could more naturally tend to undermine the trade at Oswego, to advance the French commerce, at Niagara, to alienate the Indians from their fidelity to Great Britain, and particularly to rivet the defection of the Caghnuagas. For these, residing on the south side of St. Lawrence, nearly opposite Montreal, were employed by the French as their carriers; and thus became interested against us, by motives of the most prevailing na∣ture. One would imagine, that after all the attention be∣stowed on this affair in the late administration, the objec∣tions against this trading intercourse with Canada, must have been obvious to the meanest capacity; and yet, so as∣tonishing has been our conduct, that from the time mr. Burnet removed to Boston, it has rather been encouraged than restrained. This trade, indeed, was subject to duties; but that at Oswego always was, and still is, exposed to the same incumbrance; while the French trade, in the interval between the years 1744 and 1750, was perfectly free: and as the duty, by the law then made, is laid only on goods sold in the city and county of Albany, the trader, to elude the act, is only exposed to the trouble of transporting his merchandise, beyond the scant district of the city, ascer∣tained in the charter. But how much soever our inattention to this matter may deserve censure, I cannot, in justice to my countrymen, help observing, that from the severest scrutiny I could make, our people are free from the charge of selling ammunition to the French, which has so unjustly
<PB N="193" REF="024800_0188_0FCD63DE507B1208"/>exposed the inhabitants of Albany, to the odium of all the colonies in New England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ever since the year 1729, the sale of arms and ammuni∣tion to the French, has been exempt both from duties and a prohibition; which I attribute to the confidence of the go∣vernment, that the calumny is entirely groundless.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The year 1731 was distinguished, only by the complete settlement of the disputed boundary between this province and the colony of Connecticut. An event, considering the late colonizing spirit, and extensive claims of the people of New England, of no small importance, and concerning which it may be proper to give a succinct account.</P>
<P>The partition line agreed upon in 1664, being consider∣ed as fraudulent, or erroneous; a second agreement, sus∣pended only for the king's and the duke's approbation, was concluded on the 23d of November, 1683, between colonel Dongan and his council, and Robert Trent, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> then go∣vernor of Connecticut, and several other commissioners ap∣pointed by that colony. The line of partition, then agreed to be established, was to begin at the mouth of Byram brook, "Where it falleth into the sound, at a point called Lyon's point, to go as the said river runneth, to the place where the common road, or wading place, over the said river is; and from the said road, or wading place, to go north north-west into the country, as far as will be eight English miles from the foresaid Lyon's Point; and that a line of twelve miles, being measured from the said Lyon's point, ac∣cording to the line or general course of the sound eastward: where the said twelve miles endeth, another line shall be run from the sound, eight miles into the country, north north-west; and also, that a fourth line be run (that is to say) from the northermost end of the eight miles line, be∣ing the third mentioned line, which fourth line, with the first mentioned line, shall be the bounds where they shall fall to run; and that from the eastermost end of the fourth mentioned line (which is to be twelve miles in length) a line parallel to Hudson's river, in every place twenty miles distant from Hudson's river, shall be the bounds there, between the said territories or province of New-York, and the said colony of Connecticut, so far as Connecticut colo∣ny doth extend northwards; that is, to the south line of the Massachusetts colony: only it is provided, that in case the line from Byram brook's mouth, north north-west eight miles, and the line, that is then to run twelve miles to the
<PB N="194" REF="024800_0189_0FCD63E1D0B344C0"/>end of the third fore-mentioned line of eight miles, do di∣minish or take away land, within twenty miles of Hudson's river, that then so much as is in land diminished of twenty miles of Hudson's river thereby, shall be added out of Con∣necticut bounds unto the line aforementioned, parallel to Hudson's river, and twenty miles distant from it; the ad∣dition to be made the whole length of the said parallel line, and in such breadth, as will make up, quantity for quantity, what shall be diminished as aforesaid."</P>
<P>Pursuant to this agreement, some of the lines were ac∣tually run out, and a report made of the survey, which, on the 24th of February 1684, was confirmed by the governor of each colony, at Milford in Connecticut. Here the matter rested, till a dispute arose concerning the right of juris∣diction over the towns of Rye and Bedford, which occa∣sioned a solicitation at home; and on the 28th of March 1700, king William was pleased to confirm the agreement in 1683.</P>
<P>Nineteen years afterwards, a probationary act was passed, empowering the governor to appoint commissioners, as well to run the line parallel to Hudson's river, as to re∣survey the other lines, and distinguish the boundary. The Connecticut agent opposed the king's confirmation of this act, <HI>totis viribus;</HI> but it was approved on the 23d of Janu∣ary 1723. Two years after, the commissioners and surveyors of both colonies met at Greenwich, and entered first in∣to an agreement, relating to the method of performing the work.</P>
<P>The survey was immediately after executed in part, the report being dated on the 12th of May 1725; but the com∣plete settlement was not made till the 14th of May 1731, when indentures, certifying the execution of the agreement in 1725, were mutually signed by the commissioners and surveyors of both colonies. Upon the establishment of this partition, a tract of land, lying on the Connecticut side, consisting of above 60,000 acres, from its figure called the Oblong, was ceded to New-York, as an equivalent for lands near the sound, surrendered to Connecticut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Douglas's late plan of the British dominions of New England.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The very day after the surrender, made by that colony, a patent passed in London to sir Joseph Eyles and others, in∣tended to convey the whole Oblong. A grant, posterior to the other, was also regularly made here, to Hauley and
<PB N="195" REF="024800_0190_0FCD63E2D376E518"/>company, of the greatest part of the same tract, which the British patentees brought a bill in chancery to repeal. But the defendants filed an answer, containing so many objec∣tions against the English patent, that the suit remains still unprosecuted; and the American proprietors have ever since held the possession. Mr. Harison, of the council, so∣licited this controversy for sir Joseph Eyles and his part∣ners, which contributed, in a great degree, to the troubles, so remarkable, in a succeeding administration.</P>
<P>Governor Montgomerie died on the 1st of July 1731; and being a man of a kind and humane disposition, his death was not a little lamented. The chief command then devolv∣ed upon Rip Van Dam, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> he being the oldest counsellor, and an eminent merchant, of a fair estate, though distin∣guished more for the integrity of his heart, than his capa∣city to hold the reins of government. He took the oaths before</P>

<P>This administration is unfortunately signalized by the memorable encroachment at Crown Point. An enemy des∣pised at first for his weakness, generally grows formidable for his activity and craft. This observation is true, applied to private persons, religious sects, or public states. The French, in Canada, have always been jealous of the in∣creasing strength of our colonies; and a motive of fear led them, naturally, to concert a regular system of conduct for their defence. Confining us to scant limits along the sea coast, is the grand object they have long had in view; and seiz∣ing the important passes from Canada to Louisania, seducing our Indian allies, engrossing the trade, and fortifying the routes into their country, were all proper expedients to∣wards the execution of their plan. By erecting fort St. Fre∣deric, they secured the absolute command of lake Cham∣plain, through which we must pass, if ever a descent be made upon Canada, either to conquer the country, or har∣rass its out-settlements. The garrison was, at first, situated
<PB N="196" REF="024800_0191_0FCD63E44BE8E788"/>on the east side of the lake, near the south end; but was afterwards built upon a commodious point, on the opposite side. Of all their infractions of the treaty of Utrecht, none was more palpable than this. The country belonged to the six nations: and the very spot, upon which the fort stands, is included within a patent to Dellius the Dutch minister of Albany, granted under the great seal of this province in 1696. Besides, nothing could be more evident than the danger to which it exposed us. Through this lake the French parties made their ancient bloody incursions upon Schenectady, the Mohawks' castles, and Deerfield; and the erection of this fort was apparently adapted, to facilitate the inroads of the enemy, upon the frontiers of the colo∣nies of New-York, Massachusetts bay, and New Hampshire; for it served not only as an asylum to fly to, after the per∣petration of their inhumanities, but for a magazine of pro∣visions and ammunition; and though it was much above 120 miles from the very city of Albany, yet by the conveyance through Sorel river and the lake, it may be reinforced from Montreal in three or four days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present fort at Crown Point is said to be a square with four bastions, and a high castle within the walls. It has no ditch, but is strengthened by a redoubt, and mounts six and thirty small cannon. While the colony forces, con∣sisting of about 4000 militia, lay at lake George, employ∣ed in erecting fort William Henry, in 1755, the French threw up an advanced work at Ticonderoge, near the north-east end of lake George; an important pass, about 16 miles to the southward of fort Frederic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Massachusetts government foresaw the dangerous consequences of the French fort at Crown Point, and gover∣nor Belcher gave us the first information of it, in a letter from Boston to mr. Van Dam. He informed him of the vote of the general court, to bear their proportion of the charge of an embassage to Canada, to forbid the works, and press∣ed him to engage the opposition of the six nations. Van Dam laid the letter before his council, on the 4th of Febru∣ary 1732; who, with singular calmness, advised him to write to the commissioners of Indian affairs, at Albany, or∣dering them to enquire, whether the land belonged to the confederates or the river Indians. That mr. Van Dam ever wrote to the commissioners, I have not been able to discover; nor whether any complaint of the encroachment was sent home, according to the second advice of council, on the 11th
<PB N="197" REF="024800_0192_0FCD63E8A2B56FE0"/>of February; who, besides the first step, were now pleased to recommend his transmitting governor Belcher's letter and the Boston vote to the several south-western colonies.</P>
<P>The passiveness we discovered, on this impudent and dangerous invasion of his majesty's rights, is truly astonish∣ing; and the more so, as the crown had, at that time, four in∣dependent companies, which had long been posted here for our protection, at the annual expense of about 7500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> ster∣ling. A very good scheme, in some measure, to repair this shameful misconduct, was afterwards projected, by settling the lands near lake George, with loyal protestant highlan∣ders from Scotland. Captain Laughlin Campbel, encourag∣ed by a proclamation to that purpose, came over in 1737, and ample promises were made to him. He went upon the land, viewed and approved it; and was intreated to settle there, even by the Indians, who were taken with his high∣land dress. Mr. Clarke, the lieutenant governor, promised him, in a printed advertisement, the grant of 30,000 acres of land, free from all but the charges of the survey and the king's quit-rent. Confiding on the faith of the government, captain Campbel went home to Isla, sold his estate, and, shortly after, transported, at his own expense, 83 protestant families, consisting of 423 adults, besides a great number of children. Private faith and public honour loudly de∣manded the fair execution of a project, so expensive to the undertaker and beneficial to the colony. But it unfortu∣nately dropped, through the sordid views of some persons in power, who aimed at a share in the intended grant; to which Campbel, who was a man of spirit, would not con∣sent.</P>
<P>Captain Campbel, afterwards, made an attempt to redress himself, by an application to the assembly here, and then to the board of trade in England. The first proved abortive, and such were the difficulties attending the last, that he left his colonists to themselves; and with the poor remains of his broken fortune purchased a small farm in this province. No man was better qualified than he, for the business he had engaged in. He had a high sense of honour and a good un∣derstanding: was active, loyal, and of a military disposi∣tion. For upon the news of the late rebellion in Scotland, he went home, fought under the duke, returned to his fa∣mily, and soon after died; leaving a widow and several children, who still feel the consequences of his disappoint∣ments.</P>
<P>Mr. Van Dam finished his administration, on the 1st of
<PB N="198" REF="024800_0193_0FCD63E98CC11360"/>August 1732; when William Cosby, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> arrived, with a commission, to govern this and the province of New-Jer∣sey. The history of our public transactions, from this pe∣riod, to the present time, is full of important and enter∣taining events, which I leave others to relate. A very near relation to the author had so great a concern in the public controversies with colonel Cosby, that the history of those times will be better received from a more disinterested pen. To suppress truth on the one hand, or exaggerate it, on the other, are both inexcusable faults, and perhaps it would be difficult for me to avoid those extremes. Besides, a writer, who exposes the conduct of the living, will inevitably meet with their fury and resentment. The prudent historian of his own times will always be a coward, and never give fire, till death protects him from the malice and stroke of his enemy.</P>

<P>THE province of New-York, at present, contains Long-Island, Staten Island, and the lands, on the east side of Hud∣son's river, to the bounds of Connecticut. From the division line between that colony and the Massachusetts bay, north∣ward, to the line between us and the French, we claim an ex∣tent to Connecticut river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The grounds of this claim are contained in the follow∣ing report of a committee of council, to governor Clinton, on the 2d of March 1753, which was drawn up by mr.

<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In obedience to your excellency's order, in council, of the 3d day of July last, referring to a committee there∣of, the petitions of Robert Livingston, jun, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and of the owners of a certain tract on land called Westenhook, com∣plaining of new claims and encroachments made upon their lands by the inhabitants of Massachusetts bay, and also the surveyor general's and the attorney general's reports on the said two petitions: the committee having maturely weighed and considered of the same, humbly beg leave to report to your excellency:</P>
<P N="1">1st, That they apprehend the claims of Massachusetts bay to the manor of Livingston, or the said tract of land, call∣ed Westenhook, cannot be well founded; because they find that the Dutch claimed the colony of New Netherland, as extending from cape Cod to cape Cornelius, now called cape Henlopen, westward of Delaware bay, along the sea coast, and as far back into the country, as any of the rivers within those limits extend; and that they were actually possessed of Connecticut river, long before any other European peop∣le knew any thing of the existence of such a river, and were not only possessed of the mouth of it, where they had a fort and garrison, but discovered the river above an hun∣dred miles up, had their people trading there, and pur∣chased of the natives almost all the lands on both sides of the said river.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That governor Stuyvesant, the Dutch governor of the said province, by his letter, dated the 2d of Septem∣ber 1664, new stile, in answer to a letter from governor Richard Nicolls, of the 20/30 August preceding, demanding the surrender of all the forts and places of strength possess∣ed by the Dutch under his (governor Stuyvesant's) com∣mand, writes as follows:—"Moreover it's without dispute, and acknowledged by all the world, that our predecessors, by virtue of the commission and patent of the said lords the states general, have without controul, and peaceably (the contrary never coming to our knowledge) enjoyed fort Orange about 48 or 50 years; and Manhattans about 41 or 42 years; the south river 40 years, and the fresh river a∣bout 36 years." Which last mentioned river, the committee find to be the same, that is now called Connecticut river.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, That the said Dutch governor Stuyvesant did, in the year 1664, surrender all the country, which the Dutch did then possess, to king Charles the second, and that the states general made a cession thereof, by the treaty of Breda, in the year 1667: that the Dutch re-conquered part of this province in 1673, and surrendered and absolutely yielded it to king Charles the second, in 1673-4, by the trea∣ty of London; and that in the year 1674, king Charles granted to the duke of York, all the land between Connec∣ticut river and Delaware bay; the whole of these lands being part of the former colony of New Netherland.</P>
<P N="4">4th, That the duke of York, in his several commissions to major Edmund Andross, on the 1st of July 1674, and to governor Dongan on the 30th of September 1682, among other descriptions of the boundaries of this province, men∣tions all the land from the west side of Connecticut river to the east side of Delaware bay: that their majesties, king William and queen Mary, by their commission, bearing date the fourth day of January, in the first year of their ma∣jesties' reign, appointed Henry Sloughter to be governor of the province of New-York, and territories depending there∣on; the boundaries whereof, to Connecticut river, on the east, were notorious, by the grant and other commissions a∣foresaid, and many other grants and commissions relating to the same.</P>
<P N="5">5th, That the committee apprehend Connecticut river continued the east bounds of this province, until the 28th of March 1700, when, by king William's confirmation of an agreement between this provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Connecticut, the western bounds of that colony were settled at twenty miles from Hudson's river: and they cannot find any other altera∣tion in the eastern bounds of this province, and have no reason to believe any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er was made before, or since, that time.</P>
<P N="6">6th, "That king James the first, by letters patent bear∣ing date the 3d of November, in the 18th year of his reign, granted unto the council of Plymouth, from forty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude inclusive, in which there is a recital to this purpose. "Now for as much as the king has been certainly given to understand, by divers good subjects, that have, for these many years, frequented those coasts and territories, between the degrees of 40<SUP>o</SUP> and 48<SUP>o</SUP>, that there are no other subjects of any christian king or state, or by any authority from their sovereigns, lords, or princes, actually in possession of any the said lands or precincts, whereby any right, claim, interest, or title, may, or ought, by that means, to accrue or belong to them," &amp;c. And also a proviso in these words, "Provided always, that the said lands, islands, or any of the premisses, by the said letters patent intended or meant to be granted, were not then ac∣tually possessed or inhabited by any other christian power or state." Which patent, the committee conceive, could not vest any thing in the grantees, by reason of the said recital and condition upon which it was granted; part of the pre∣misses being then actually possessed by the Dutch, and most of the said colony of New Netherland being within the bounds thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7th, That the council of Plymouth, by their deed, dated the 19th of March, in the third year of king Charles the first, granted to sir Henry Rosswell and others, part of what was supposed to be granted by the said letters patent, which grant, from the said council of Plymouth, the com∣mittee take to be void, as founded upon the said void pa∣tent.</P>
<P N="8">8th, That he, the said sir Henry Rosswell, and others, obtained a grant and confirmation thereof, from the crown, under the great seal of England, dated the 4th of March, in the fourth year of king Charles the first, within which grant and confirmation, the province of Massachusetts bay is in∣cluded; which grant and confirmation was adjudged void in the high court of chancery of England, in the year 1684. And the committee are of opinion, that nothing, to the westward of Connecticut river, could pass by that grant and confir∣mation; for that his majesty could not have had an inten∣tion to grant the same, it being then possessed by the Dutch, as before mentioned.</P>
<P N="9">9th, That the committee conceive the inhabitants of Massachusetts bay can claim nothing at present, but what is granted them by their last charter in 1691; all their other grants and charters being either void of themselves, or de∣clared so in the chancery of England.</P>
<P N="10">10th, That the bounds granted, by this charter, are westward as far as the colonies of Rhode Island, Connecti∣cut, and the Narraganset country: which words being in the case of a grant from the crown, the committee conceive, cannot extend their bounds farther than to Connecti∣cut colony, and therefore not to Connecticut river, and much less to the westward of it; because Connecticut it∣self, at the time of that charter, did not, in the knowledge of the crown, extend westward of that river; nor did till nine years after, when, by the royal approbation, the agree∣ment between this province and that colony taking place, (which was not to be in force till such approbation) the bounds of that colony were settled as is before mentioned: and the committee conceive it to be against reason, to sup∣pose that the crown intended, by the said charter, to grant any part of the province of New-York, under the then immediate government of the crown, without express men∣tion thereof in the charter; and without notification there∣of to Henry Sloughter, then governor of this province, that the crown had granted such a part of what was before with∣in his jurisdiction, by their majesties' commission aforesaid to him.</P>
<P N="11">11th, That both the patents, under which the peti∣tioners claim, the committee find were granted under the great seal of this province; that of the manor of Livingston in 1686, and that of Westenhook in 1735. And that the lands contained in the said grants are, the committee ap∣prehend, within the jurisdiction of this province, they being both west of Connecticut river.</P>
<P N="12">12th, That the committee are of opinion, the attempts of the inhabitants of the Massachusetts bay, to make en∣croachments upon any lands, granted by letters patent un∣der the great seal of New-York, or upon any lands within the jurisdiction of this province, are disrespectful to his majesty's authority, tend to the disturbance of the subjects of this province, and may be the cause of great mischiefs and disorders.</P>
<P N="13">13th, That the steps taken by the said inhabitants, even were the bounds of this province doubtful and unsettled, are intrusions, and disrespectful to his majesty's authority.</P>
<P>"And lastly, The committee are of opinion, that a co∣py of so much of this report, as shall be approved of by your excellency and the council, be transmitted to the lieuten∣ant governor of the province of Massachusetts bay, request∣ing that he would take effectual measures, that all encroach∣ments and disturbances, by the people of that colony, on his majesty's subjects of this province, be stayed; and that he would lay this matter before the next general court, that they may inform your excellency, by what warrant they claim or exercise any right to soil or jurisdiction, westward of Connecticut river; that the same may be considered, and such steps taken towards removing all causes of en∣croachments, or disturbances, for the future, as may be a∣greeable to equity and justice: to the end, that good un∣derstanding may be preserved, which ought to subsist be∣tween fellow subjects and neighbouring provinces.</P>

<P>The government of the Massachusetts bay never exhibited the reasons of their claim, in answer to this report, but continued their encroachments: and, in the spring, 1755, surveyed and sold lands, lying several miles west of the eastern extent of the manor of Livingston and the patent of Claverack.</P></NOTE>.

<PB N="200" REF="024800_0195_0FCD64680E0A8738"/>from the sea to the latitude of 41<SUP>o</SUP> lies New Jersey. The line of partition between that province and this, from that latitude to the other station on Delaware, is unsettled. From
<PB N="201" REF="024800_0196_0FCD580552802520"/>thence, wheresoever it may be fixed, we claim all the lands, on the east side of Delaware, to the north line of Pennsyl∣vania; and all the territory, on both sides of the Mohawks'
<PB N="202" REF="024800_0197_0FCD5809C04D7038"/>river, and westward to the Isthmus at Niagara: in a word, all the country belonging to the crown of Great Britain, not already granted; for we are to consider New York a∣mong
<PB N="203" REF="024800_0198_0FCD580C81351CD0"/>her sister colonies, to borrow a law phrase, as a resi∣duary legatee.</P>
<P>Hence we have, from the beginning, been exposed to
<PB N="204" REF="024800_0199_0FCD63EE903ED428"/>controversies about limits. The New-Jersey claim includes several hundred thousand acres, and has not a little imped∣ed the settlement of the colony. The dispute with the Massachusetts bay is still more important, and, for several years past, occasioned very considerable commotions. The New Hampshire pretensions have, as yet, exposed us to no great trouble. But when all those claims are settled, a new controversy will probably commence with the pro∣prietaries of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>This province was, in 1691, divided, by an act of assem∣bly, into twelve counties, which I shall describe in their order.</P>

<HEAD>THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of New-York, at first, included only the island, called by the Indians, Manhattans. Manning's island, the two Barn islands, and the three Oyster islands were in the county. But the limits of the city have since been aug∣mented by charter. The island is very narrow, not a mile wide at a medium, and about 14 miles in length. The south-west point projects into a fine spacious bay, nine miles long, and about four in breadth, at the confluence of the waters of Hudson's river, and the streight between Long Island and the northern shore. The Narrows, at the south end of the bay, is scarce two miles wide, and opens the ocean to full view. The passage up to New-York from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dy Hook, a point that extends farthest into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is safe, and not above five and twenty miles in length. The common navi∣gation is between the east and west banks, in two or three and twenty feet water. But it is said, that an eighty gun ship may be brought up, through a narrow, winding, un∣frequented channel, between the north end of the east bank and Coney Island.</P>
<P>The city has, in reality, no natural bason or harbour. The ships lie off in the road, on the east side of the town, which is docked out, and better built than the west side, because the freshets in Hudson's river, fill it in some winters with ice.</P>
<P>The city of New-York, as I have elsewhere had occasion to mention, "consists of about two thousand five hundred buildings. It is a mile in length, and not above half that in breadth. Such is its figure in its centre of business, and the situation of the houses, that the mean cartage from one part to another, does not exceed above one quarter of a mile, than which nothing can be more advantageous to a trading city."</P>
<P>It is thought to be as healthy a spot as any in the world. The east and south parts, in general, are low, but the rest is situated on a dry, elevated soil. The streets are irregu∣lar; but, being paved with round pebbles, are clean, and lined with well-built brick houses, many of which are co∣vered with tiled roofs.</P>
<P>No part of America is supplied with markets abound∣ing with greater plenty and variety. We have beef, pork, mutton, poultry, butter, wild fowl, venison, fish, roots, and herbs, of all kinds, in their seasons. Our oysters are a con∣siderable
<PB N="206" REF="024800_0201_0FCD63F1D0666CE0"/>article in the support of the poor. Their beds are within view of the town; a fleet of two hundred small craft, are often seen there, at a time, when the weather is mild in winter; and this single article is computed to be worth annually 10 or 12,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>This city is the metropolis and grand mart of the pro∣vince, and, by its commodious situation, commands also all the trade of the western part of Connecticut and that of East Jersey. "No season prevents our ships from launching out into the ocean. During the great severity of winter, an equal, unrestrained activity runs through all ranks, orders, and employments."</P>
<P>Upon the south-west point of the city stands the fort, which is a square with four bastions. Within the walls is the house in which our governors usually reside; and oppo∣site to it, brick barracks, built formerly for the independent companies. The governor's house is in height three stories, and fronts to the west; having, from the second story, a fine prospect of the bay and the Jersey shore. At the south end there was formerly a chapel, but this was burnt down in the negro conspiracy of the spring 1741. According to governor Burnet's observations, this fort stands in the lati∣tude 40<SUP>o</SUP> 42′ N.</P>
<P>Below the walls of the garrison, near the water, we have lately raised a line of fortifications, which com∣mands the entrance into the eastern road and the mouth of Hudson's river. This battery is built of stone, and the mer∣lons consist of cedar joists, filled in with earth. It mounts 92 cannon, and these are all the works we have to defend us. About six furlongs, south-east of the fort, lies Notten Island, containing about 100 or 120 acres, reserved by an act of as∣sembly, as a sort of demesne for the governors, upon which it is proposed to erect a strong castle, because an enemy might from thence easily bombard the city, without being annoyed either by our battery or the fort. During the late war, a line of palisadoes was run from Hudson's to the East river, at the other end of the city, with block-houses at small distances. The greater part of these still remain as a monu∣ment of our folly, which cost the province about 8000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>The inhabitants of New-York are a mixed people, but mostly descended from the original Dutch planters. There are still two churches, in which religious worship is per∣formed in that language. The old building is of stone and ill built, ornamented with a small organ loft and brass branches. The new church is a high, heavy edifice, has a very extensive area, and was completed in 1729. It has no
<PB N="207" REF="024800_0202_0FCD63F4844E2088"/>galleries, and yet will perhaps contain a thousand or twelve hundred auditors. The steeple of this church affords a most beautiful prospect, both of the city beneath and the surrounding country. The Dutch congregation is more nu∣merous than any other; but as the language becomes dis∣used, it is much diminished; and unless they change their worship into the English tongue, must soon suffer a total dissipation. They have at present two ministers: the reve∣rend messieurs Ritzma and de Ronde, who are both strict Calvinists. Their church was incorporated on the 11th of May, 1696, by the name of "the minister, elders, and dea∣cons, of the reformed protestant Dutch church of the city of New-York:" and its estate, after the expiration of sun∣dry long leases, will be worth a very great income<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their charter was confirmed by a late act of assembly, ratified by his majesty, which recites the VIIIth article of the surrender in 1664.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the Low Dutch congregations, in this and the pro∣vince of New-Jersey, worship after the manner of the re∣formed church in the united provinces. With respect to government, they are in principle presbyterians; but yet hold themselves in subordination to the claffis of Am∣sterdam, who sometimes permit, and at other times refuse them the powers of ordination. Some of their ministers con∣sider such a subjection as anti-constitutional, and hence in se∣veral of their late annual conventions, at New-York, called the coetus, some debates have arisen among them; the ma∣jority being inclined to erect a claffis, or ecclesiastical judi∣catory, here, for the government of their churches. Those of their ministers, who are natives of Europe, are, in ge∣neral, averse to the project. The expense attending the or∣dination of their candidates, in Holland, and the reference of their disputes to the claffis of Amsterdam, is very consi∣derable; and with what consequences, the interruption of their correspondence with the European Dutch, would be attended, in case of a war, well deserves their considera∣tion.</P>
<P>There are, besides the Dutch, two episcopal churches in this city, upon the plan of the established church in South Britain. Trinity church was built in 1696, and afterwards enlarged in 1737. It stands very pleasantly upon the banks of Hudson's river, and has a large cemetery, on each side, enclosed in the front, by a painted, paled fence. Before it a long walk is railed off from the broad-way, the pleasantest
<PB N="208" REF="024800_0203_0FCD63F717433340"/>street of any in the whole town. This building is about 148 feet long, including the tower and chancel, and 72 feet in breadth. The steeple is 175 feet in height, and over the door, facing the river, is the following inscription.</P>

<P>The church is, within, ornamented beyond any other place of public worship among us. The head of the chan∣cel is adorned with an altar-piece, and opposite to it, at the other end of the building, is the organ. The tops of the pillars which support the galleries, are decked with the gilt busts of angels winged. From the ceiling are suspended two glass branches, and on the walls hang the arms of some of its principal benefactors. The ailes are paved with flat stones.</P>
<P>The present rector of this church is the rev. mr. Henry Barclay, formerly a missionary among the Mohawks, who receives 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, levied upon all the other clergy and laity in the city, by virtue of an act of assembly, pro∣cured by governor Fletcher. He is assisted by dr. Johnson and mr. Auchmuty.</P>
<P>This congregation, partly by the arrival of strangers from Europe, but principally by proselytes from the Dutch churches, is become so numerous, that though the old buil∣ding will contain 2000 hearers, yet a new one was erected in 1752. This, called St. George's chapel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The length, exclusive of the chancel, 92 feet, and its breadth 20 feet less.</NOTE>, is a very great edifice, faced with hewn stone and tiled.

<P>The rector, churchwardens, and vestrymen of Trinity church, are incorporated by an act of assembly, which grants the two last the advowson or right of presentation; but enacts, that the rector shall be instituted and inducted in a manner most agreeable to the king's instructions to the governor, and the canonical right of the bishop of London. Their worship is conducted after the mode of the church of England; and with respect to government, they are em∣powered to make rules and orders for themselves, being, if I may use the expression, an independent, ecclesiastical cor∣poration.</P>
<P>The revenue of this church is restricted, by an act of as∣sembly, to 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum: but it is possessed of a real estate, at the north end of the town, which, having been lately divided into lots, and let to farm, will, in a few years, produce a much greater income.</P>
<P>The presbyterians increasing after lord Cornbury's re∣turn to England, called mr. Anderson, a Scotch minister, to the pastoral charge of their congregation: and dr. John Ni∣col, Patrick Mac Night, Gilbert Livingston, and Thomas Smith, purchased a piece of ground, and founded a church in 1719. Two years afterwards, they petitioned colonel Schuyler, who had then the chief command, for a charter of incorporation, to secure their estate for religious wor∣ship, upon the plan of the church in North-Britain; but were disappointed in their expectations, through the op∣position of the episcopal party. They, shortly after, renew∣ed their request to governor Burnet, who referred the pe∣tition to his council. The episcopalians again violently op∣posed the grant; and the governor, in 1724, wrote upon the subject to the lords of trade for their direction. Coun∣sellor West, who was then consulted, gave his opinion, in these words: "Upon consideration of the several acts of uniformity, that have passed in Great Britain, I am of opi∣nion that they do not extend to New-York, and consequent∣ly an act of toleration is of no use in that province; and, therefore, as there is no provincial act for uniformity, ac∣cording to the church of England, I am of opinion, that by law such patent of incorporation may be granted, as by the petition is desired. RICHARD WEST, 20 August, 1724."</P>
<P>After several years solicitation for a charter in vain, and
<PB N="210" REF="024800_0205_0FCD63FA0E33F898"/>fearful that those who obstructed such a reasonable request, would watch an opportunity to give them a more effectual wound; those, among the presbyterians, who were invested with the fee simple of the church and ground, "conveyed it, on the 16th of March, 1730, to the moderator of the ge∣neral assembly of the church of Scotland and the commis∣sion thereof, the moderator of the presbytery of Edin∣burgh, the principal of the college of Edinburgh, the professor of divinity therein, and the procurator and agent of the church of Scotland, for the time being, and their successors in office, as a committee of the general assembly." On the 15th of August, 1732, the church of Scotland, (by an instrument under the seal of the general assembly, and signed by mr. Niel Campbell, principal of the university of Glasgow, and moderator of the general assembly and com∣mission thereof—mr. James Nesbit, one of the ministers of the gospel at Edinburgh, moderator of the presbytery of Edinburgh—mr. Wm. Hamilton, principal of the university of Edinburgh—mr. James Smith, professor of divinity there∣in—and mr. William Grant, advocate procurator for the church of Scotland, for the time being) pursuant to an act of the general assembly, dated May, 1731, did declare, "That notwithstanding the aforesaid right made to them and their successors in office, they were desirous, that the aforesaid building, and edifice, and appurtenances thereof, be preserved for the pious and religious purposes for which the same were designed; and that it should be free and lawful to the presbyterians, then residing, or that should at any time, thereafter, be resident, in, or near, the aforesaid city of New-York, in America, or others joining with them, to convene, in the foresaid church, for the worship of God in all the parts thereof, and for the dispensation of all gospel ordinances; and generally to use and occupy the said church and its appurtenances, fully and freely in all times coming, they supporting and maintain∣ing the edifice and appurtenances at their own charge."</P>
<P>Mr. Anderson was succeeded, in April, 1727, by the rev. mr. Ebenezer Pemberton, a man of polite breeding, pure morals, and warm devotion; under whose incessant labours, the congregation greatly increased, and was enabled to erect the present edifice in 1748. It is built of stone, railed off from the street, is 80 feet long, and in breadth 60. The steeple, raised on the south-west end, is in height 145 feet. In the front to the street, between two long windows, is the following inscription, gilt and cut in a black slate, six feet in length.</P>

<P>Mr. Alexander Cumming, a young gentleman of learn∣ing and singular penetration, was chosen colleague to mr. Pemberton, in 1750: but both were dismissed, at their re∣quest, about three years afterwards; the former, through indisposition, and the latter, on account of trifling conten∣tions, kindled by the bigotry and ignorance of the lower sort of people. These debates continued till they were clos∣ed, in April 1756, by a decision of the synod, to which, al∣most all our presbyterian churches, in this and the southern provinces, are subject. The congregation consists, at pre∣sent, of 12 or 1400 souls, under the pastoral charge of the rev. mr. David Bostwick, who was lately translated from Jamaica to New-York, by a synodical decree. He is a gen∣tleman of a mild, catholic disposition; and being a man of piety, prudence, and zeal, confines himself entirely to the proper business of his function. In the art of preaching, he is one of the most distinguished clergymen in these parts. His discourses are methodical, sound, and pathetic; in sentiment, and in point of diction, singularly ornament∣ed. He delivers himself without notes, and yet with great
<PB N="212" REF="024800_0207_0FCD63FFB505C2D0"/>ease and fluency of expression; and performs every part of divine worship with a striking solemnity.</P>
<P>The French church, by the contentions in 1724, and the disuse of the language, is now reduced to an inconsiderable handful. The building, which is of stone, nearly a square<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The area is seventy feet long, and in breadth fifty.</NOTE>, plain both within and without. It is fenced from the street, has a steeple and a bell, the latter of which was the gift of sir Henry Ashurst of London. On the front of the church is the following inscription,
<Q>AEDES SACRA GALLOR. PROT. REFORM. FVNDA. 1704. PENITVS REPAR. 1741.</Q></P>
<P>The present minister, mr. Carle, is a native of France, and succeeded mr. Rou in 1754. He bears an irreproach∣able character, is very intent upon his studies, preaches mo∣derate Calvinism, and speaks with propriety, both of pro∣nunciation and gesture.</P>
<P>The German Lutheran churches are two. Both their pla∣ces of worship are small: one of them has a cupola and bell.</P>
<P>The quakers have a meeting-house, and the Moravians, a new sect among us, a church, consisting principally of female proselytes from other societies. Their service is in the English tongue.</P>
<P>The anabaptists assemble at a small meeting-house, but have as yet no regular settled congregation. The Jews, who are not inconsiderable for their numbers, worship in a synagogue erected in a very private part of the town, plain without, but very neat within.</P>
<P>The city hall is a strong brick building, two stories in height, in the shape of an oblong, winged with one at each end, at right angles with the first. The floor below is an open walk, except two jails and the jailor's apartments. The cellar underneath is a dungeon, and the garret above a com∣mon prison. This edifice is erected in a place where four streets meet, and fronts, to the south-west, one of the most spacious streets in town. The eastern wing, in the second
<PB N="213" REF="024800_0208_0FCD6400CDC82708"/>story, consists of the assembly chamber, a lobby, and a small room for the speaker of the house. The west wing, on the same floor, forms the council room and a library; and in the space between the ends, the supreme court is ordinarily held.</P>
<P>The library consists of a thousand volumes, which were bequeathed to "the society for the propagation of the gos∣pel in foreign parts," by dr. Millington, rector of Newing∣ton. Mr. Humphreys, the society's secretary, in a letter of the 23d of September 1728, informed governor Montgo∣merie, that the society intended to place these books in New-York, intending to establish a library, for the use of the clergy and gentlemen of this and the neighbouring governments of Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylva∣nia, upon giving security to return them; and desired the governor to recommend it to the assembly, to provide a place to deposit the books, and to concur in an act for the preservation of them and others that might be added. Go∣vernor Montgomerie sent the letter to the assembly, who ordered it to be laid before the city corporation: and the latter, in June 1729, agreed to provide a proper repository for the books, which were accordingly soon after sent over. The greatest part of them are upon theological subjects; and through the carelessness of the keepers, many are mis∣sing.</P>
<P>In 1754, a set of gentlemen undertook to carry about a subscription towards raising a public library, and in a few days collected near 600<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which were laid out in purchasing about 700 volumes of new, well-chosen books. Every sub∣scriber, upon payment of 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> principal, and the annual sum of 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> is entitled to the use of these books. His right by the articles is assignable, and, for non-compliance with them, may be forfeited. The care of this library, is com∣mitted to twelve trustees, annually elected by the subscribers, on the last Tuesday of April, who are restricted from making any rules repugnant to the fundamental subscription. This is the beginning of a library, which, in process of time, will probably become vastly rich and voluminous; and it would be very proper for the company to have a charter for its security and encouragement. The books are deposited in the same room with those given by the society.</P>
<P>Besides the city hall, there belong to the corporation, a large alms-house or place of correction, and the exchange, in the latter of which there is a large room raised upon
<PB N="214" REF="024800_0209_0FCD6402646064A8"/>brick arches, generally used for public entertainments, concerts of music, balls and assemblies.</P>
<P>Though the city was put under the government of a mayor, &amp;c. in 1665, it was not regularly incorporated till 1686. Since that time several charters have been passed: the last was granted by governor Montgomerie, on the 15th of January, 1730.</P>
<P>It is divided into seven wards, and is under the govern∣ment of a mayor, recorder, seven aldermen, and as many assistants, or common councilmen. The mayor, a sheriff, and coroner, are annually appointed by the governor. The recorder has a patent during pleasure. The aldermen, assis∣tants, assessors, and collectors, are annually elected by the freemen and freeholders of the respective wards. The mayor has the sole appointment of a deputy, and, to∣gether with four aldermen, may appoint a chamberlain. The mayor, or recorder, four aldermen, and as many assist∣ants, form "the common council of the city of New-York:" and this body, by a majority of voices, hath power to make bye-laws for the government of the city, which are binding only for a year, unless confirmed by the governor and coun∣cil. They have many other privileges relating to ferriages, markets, fairs, the assize of bread, wine, &amp;c. and the li∣censing and regulation of tavern keepers, cartage, and the like. The mayor, his deputy, the recorder and aldermen, are constituted justices of the peace; and may hold not only a court of record once a week, to take cognizance of all civil causes, but also a court of general quarter sessions of the peace. They have a common clerk, commissioned by the governor, who enjoys an appointment worth about four or five hundred pounds per annum. The annual revenue of the corporation is near two thousand pounds. The standing mi∣litia of the island consists of about 2300 men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole number of the inhabitants, exclusive of fe∣males above sixty, according to a list returned to the gover∣nor, in the spring 1756, amounted to 10,468 whites, and 2275 negroes; but that account is erroneous. It is most probable, that there are in the city 15,000 souls.</NOTE>: and the city has in reserve, a thousand stand of arms for seamen, the poor, and others, in case of an invasion.</P>
<P>The north eastern part of New-York island is inhabited, principally, by Dutch farmers, who have a small village there, called Haerlem, pleasantly situated on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, culti∣vated for the city markets.</P>

The county is toler∣ably settled. The lands are in general rough, but fertile, and therefore the farmers run principally on grazing. It has several towns, East-Chester, West-Chester, New-Rochelle, Rye, Bedford, and North-Castle. The inhabi∣tants are either English or Dutch presbyterians, episco∣palians, quakers, and French protestants. The former are the most numerous.

<PB N="216" REF="024800_0211_0FCD6409D07DA630"/>ago. Within the memory of persons now living, it did not contain above twelve families; and according to the late returns of the militia, it will furnish at present above 2500 fighting men.</P>

<HEAD>ALBANY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county extends from the south bounds of the ma∣nor of Livingston, on the east side, and Ulster, on the west side of Hudson's river: on the north its limits are not yet ascertained. It contains a vast quantity of fine low land. its principal commodities are wheat, pease, and pine boards.</P>
<P>The city of Albany, which is near 150 miles from New-York, is situated on the west side of the river. There our governors usually treat with the Indians dependent upon the British crown. The houses are built of brick, in the Dutch taste, and are in number about 350. There are two churches in it. That of the episcopalians, the only one in this large county, is a stone building. The congregation is but small, almost all the inhabitants resorting to the Duch church, which is a plain, square, stone edifice. Besides these they have no other public buildings, except the city hall and the fort; the latter of which is a stone square, with four bastions, situated on an eminence which overlooks the town, but is itself commanded by higher ground. The greatest part of the city is fortified only by palisadoes, and in some places there are small cannon planted in block-houses. Albany was incorporated by colonel Dongan, in 1686, and is under the government of a mayor, recorder, six alder∣men, and as many assistants. It has also a sheriff, town clerk, chamberlain, clerk of the markets, one high constable, three sub-constables, and a marshal. The corporation is empower∣ed besides to hold a mayor's court for the trial of civil cau∣ses, and a court of general quarter sessions.</P>
<P>Sixteen or eighteen miles north-west from Albany, lies Schenectady, on the banks of the Mohawks' river, which falls into Hudson's river 12 miles to the North of Albany. This village is compact and regular, built principally of brick, on a rich flat of low land, surrounded with hills. It has a large Dutch church, with a steeple and town clock, near the centre. The windings of the river through the town, and the fields (which are often overflowed in the spring) form, about harvest, a most beautiful prospect. The lands, in the vale of Schenectady, are so fertile, that they are commonly sold at 45<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per acre. Though the farmers use no kind of manure, they till the fields every year, and
<PB N="217" REF="024800_0212_0FCD640B54DA0728"/>they always produce full crops of wheat or pease. Their church was incorporated by governor Cosby; and the town has the privilege of sending a member to the assembly.</P>
<P>From this village, our Indian traders set out in battoes for Oswego. The Mohawks' river, from hence to fort Hun∣ter, abounds with rifts and shoals, which, in the spring, give but little obstruction to the navigation. From thence to its head, or rather to the portage into the Wood Creek, the conveyance is easy, and the current less rapid. The banks of this river are, in general, low, and the soil exceed∣ing good. Our settlements, on the north side, extend to Burnet's field, a flat inhabited by Germans, which produces wheat and pease in surprising plenty. On the south side, ex∣cept a few Scotch Irish, in Cherry Valley, at the head of Susquehanna, we have but few farms west of the three Ger∣man towns on Schohare, a small creek which empties itself into the Mohawks' river, about 20 miles west of Schenecta∣dy. The fur trade, at Oswego, is one of the principal ad∣vantages of this county. The Indians resort thither in May; and the trade continues till the latter end of July. A good road might be made from Schenectady to Oswego. In the summer 1755, fat cattle were easily driven there for the ar∣my under the command of general Shirley.</P>
<P>The principal settlements to the northward of Albany, are Connestigiune, eastward of Schenectady, on the Mo∣hawks' river, which, a little lower, tumbles down a preci∣pice of about seventy feet high, called the Cahoes. The surprise, which, as one might imagine, would naturally be excited by the view of so great a cataract, is much dimi∣nished by the height of the banks of the river; besides, the fall is as uniform as a mill dam, being uninterrupted by the projection of rocks.</P>
<P>At Scaghtahook, on the east side of the north branch of Hudson's river, there are a few farms, but many more several miles to the eastward, and about twenty-five miles from Albany, in the patent of Hosick. These were all broke up by an irruption of French and Indians, who, on the 28th of August 1754, killed and scalped two persons, and set fire to the houses and barns.</P>
<P>About forty miles to the northward of Albany, on the west side of the river, lies Saratoga, a fine tract of low land, from which several families were driven by the French Indians, in the late war. A project of purchasing these lands from the proprietors, settling them with Indians, raising a fort there, and cultivating the soil for them, has been often talked of since captain Campbell's disap∣pointment,
<PB N="218" REF="024800_0213_0FCD640D0CBA4148"/>as a proper expedient to curb the scalping pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ties sent out from Crown-Point.</P>
<P>In the southern part of the county of Albany, on both sides of Hudson's river, the settlements are very scattered, except within twelve miles of the city, when the banks be∣come low and accessible. The islands here, which are many, contain perhaps the finest soil in the world.</P>
<P>There are two manors in the county, Ronslaerwick and Livingston, which have each the privilege of sending a member to the assembly. The tenants of these manors, and of the patents of Claverack, have free farms, at the an∣nual rent of a tenth of the produce, which has as yet been neither exacted nor paid. At Ancram, in the manor of Livingston, is an iron furnace, about fourteen miles from the river. Its best and most improved lands lie at Tachanio in the eastern parts, which have of late been much dis∣turbed by the inroads of the Massachusetts boy, on this and the patents of Westernhook and Claverack.</P>
<P>The winters in this county are commonly severe: and Hudson's river freezes so hard, a hundred miles to the southward of Albany, as to bear sleds loaded with great burdens. Much snow is very serviceable to the farmers here, not only in protecting their grain from the frost, but in facilitating the transportation of their boards and other produce, to the banks of the river against the ensuing spring.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="county">
<HEAD>ULSTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county joins to that of Albany, on the west side of Hudson's river. Its northern extent is fixed at Saw∣yer's rill: the rivers Delaware and Hudson bound it east and west; and a west line, from the mouth of Murder∣er's creek, is its southern limit.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are Dutch, French, English, Scotch, and Irish, but the first and the last are most numerous. The episcopalians in this county are so inconsiderable, that their church is only a mean log-house. The most consider∣able town is Kingston, situated about two miles from Hud∣son's river. It contains about one hundred and fifty houses, mostly of stone; is regularly laid out on a dry, level spot; and has a large stone church and court-house near the cen∣tre. It is thought to resemble Schenectady, but far exceed it in its elevation. On the north side of the town, the Esopus Kill winds through rich and beautiful lawns. The people of Ulster having long enjoyed an undisturbed tran∣quillity,
<PB N="219" REF="024800_0214_0FCD640EA7D06200"/>are some of the most opulent farmers in the whole colony.</P>
<P>This county is most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed for fine flour, beer, and a good breed of draught horses. At the commencement of the range of the Apolachian hills, about ten miles from Hudson's river, is an inexhaustible quarry of millstones, which far exceed those from Colen in Europe, formerly imported here, and sold at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol. a pair. The Mathletown millstones cost not a fourth part of that sum. This, and the counties of Duchess and Orange, abound with limestone: and on the banks of Hudson's river, are found great bodies of blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>The principal villages, besides Kingston, are Marbletown, Hurley, Rochester, Now Paltz, and the Wall-kill, each of which is surrounded with fine tracts of low land. The mi∣litia of Ulster is about fifteen or sixteen hundred men and a company of horse.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="county">
<HEAD>ORANGE</HEAD>
<P>COUNTY is divided by a range of mountains, stretch∣ing westward from Hudson's river, called the high∣lands. On the north side, the lands are very broken, but fertile, and inhabited by Scotch, Irish, and English presby∣terians. The society's missionary in Ulster preaches here sometimes to a small congregation of the episcopal persua∣sion, which is the only one in the county. Their villages are Goshen, Bethlehem, and Little Britain, all remarkable for producing, in general, the best butter made in the co∣lony. The people on the south side of the mountains are all Dutch: and Orange town, more commonly called by the Indian name Tappan; is a small but very pleasant inland vil∣lage, with a stone court-house and church. The militia con∣sists of about thirteen hundred fighting men.</P>
<P>This county joins to the province of New-Jersey on the south; and the non-settlement of the partition-line has been the greatest obstruction to its growth.</P>
<P>There is a very valuable tract, called the Drowned Lands, on the north side of the mountains, containing about 40 or 50,000 acres. The waters, which descend from the surrounding hills, being but slowly discharged by the river issuing out of it, cover these vast meadows every win∣ter; and hence they become extremely fertile. The fires kindled up in the woods by the deer hunters in autumn, are communicated by the leaves to these meadows, before the waters rise above the channel of the river, and a dread∣ful
<PB N="220" REF="024800_0215_0FCD6412D910EA78"/>devouring conflagration over-runs it, consuming the herbage for several days. The Wall Kill river, which runs through this extensive, amphibious tract, if I may use the expression, is in the spring stored with eels of uncommon size and plenty, very useful to the farmers residing on its banks. The river is about two chains in breadth, where it leaves the drowned lands, and has a considerable fall. The bottom of it is a broken rock: and I am informed by mr. Clinton, a gentleman of ingenuity and a mathematical turn, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> channel might, for less than 2,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> be sufficiently deepened to draw off all the water from the meadows. Some parts near the banks of the upland, have been alrea∣dy redeemed from the floods. These spots are very fertile, and produce English grass, hemp, and Indian corn.</P>
<P>The mountains, in the county of Orange, are clothed thick with timber, and abound with iron ore, ponds, and fine streams for iron works. Coshen is well supplied with white cedar, and in some parts of the woods is found great plenty of black walnut.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the description of the southern coun∣ties, I beg leave to say a few words concerning Hudson's river.</P>
<P>Its source has not, as yet, been discovered. We know, in general, that it is in the mountainous, uninhabited coun∣try, between the lakes Ontario and Champlain. In its course southward, it approaches the Mohawk's river with∣in a few miles at Saucondauga. From thence it runs north and north-easterly towards lake St. Sacrament, now called lake George, and is not above 8 or 10 miles distant from it. The course then to New-York is very uniform, being in the main south 12 or 15° west.</P>
<P>The distance from Albany to lake George is computed at 65 miles. The river, in that interval, is navigable only to batteaus, and interrupted by rifts, which occasion two portages, of half a mile each<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the passage from Albany to fort Edward, the whole land carriage is about twelve or thirteen miles.</NOTE>. There are three routes from Crown Point to Hudson's river, in the way to Albany; one through lake George, another through a branch of lake Champlain, bearing a southern course, and terminating in a bason, several miles east of lake George, called the South bay. The third is by ascending the Wood Creek, a shallow stream about one hundred feet broad, which, coming from
<PB N="221" REF="024800_0216_0FCD64152DA5BEC8"/>the south-east, empties itself into the south branch of the lake Champlain.</P>
<P>The place, where these routes meet, on the banks of Hud∣son's river, is called the carrying place. Here fort Lyman, since called fort Edward, is built: but sort William Henry, a much stronger garrison, was erected at the south end of lake George, after the repulse of the French forces under the command of baron Dieskau, on the 8th of September, 1755. General Shirley thought it more advisable, to strengthen fort Edward, in the concurrence of three routes, than to erect the other at lake George, 17 miles to the northward of it, and wrote a very pressing letter upon that head to sir William Johnson who then commanded the provincial troops.</P>
<P>The banks of Hudson's river are, for the most part, rocky cliffs, especially on the western shore. The passage through the highlands, affords a wild, romantic scene, for sixteen miles, through steep and lofty mountains. The tide flows a few miles above Albany. The navigation is safe, and per∣formed in sloops of about 40 or 50 tons burden, extremely well accommodated to the river. About sixty miles above the city of New-York, the water is fresh, and, in wet sea∣sons, much lower. The river is stored with variety of fish, which renders a summer's passage to Albany, exceedingly diverting to such as are fond of angling.</P>
<P>The advantages of this river for penetrating into Cana∣da, and protecting the southern colonies from the irrup∣tions of the French, by securing the command of the lakes, and cutting off the communication between the French set∣tlements on St. Lawrence and the Mississippi, though but lately attended to, must be very apparent to every judicious observer of the maps of the inland part of North America.</P>
<P>The French, as appears from the intended invasion, in 1689, have long eyed the English possession of this pro∣vince with jealousy; and it becomes us to fall upon every method for its protection and defence.</P>
<P>The singular conveniency of Hudson's river to this pro∣vince in particular, was so fully shown in one of the late papers, published in 1753, under the title of the Inde∣pendent Reflector, that I cannot help reprinting the passage relating to it.</P>
<P>"High roads, which, in most trading countries, are ex∣tremely expensive, and awake a continual attention for their reparation, demand from us, comparatively speaking, scarce any public notice at all. The whole province is con∣tained in two narrow oblongs, extending from the city east
<PB N="222" REF="024800_0217_0FCD64168DA4C470"/>and north, having water carriage from the extremity of one, and from the distance of one hundred and sixty miles of the other; and by the most accurate calculation, has not, at a medium, above twelve miles of land carriage, through∣out its whole extent. This is one of the strongest motives to the settlement of a new country, as it affords the easiest and most speedy conveyance from the remotest distances, and at the lowest expense. The effects of this advantage are greater than we usually observe, and are therefore not sufficiently admired.</P>
<P>"The province of Pennsylvania has a fine soil, and through the importation of Germans, abounds with inha∣bitants; but being a vast inland country, its produce must, of consequence, be brought to a market over a great extent of ground, and all by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and carriage. Hence it is, that Phi∣ladelphia is crouded with waggons, carts, horses, and their drivers: a stranger, at his first entrance, would imagine it to be a place of traffic, beyond any one town in the colo∣nies: while at New-York, in particular, to which the pro∣duce of the country is all brought by water, there is more business, at least, business of profit, though with less show and appearance. Not a boat in our river is navigated with more than two, or three men at most; and these are per∣petually coming in from, and returning to, all parts of the adjacent country, in the same employments, that fill the city of Philadelphia with some hundreds of men, who, in respect to the public advantage, may justly be said, to be laboriously idle: for, let any one nicely compute the ex∣pense of a waggon, with its tackling; the time of two men in attending it; their maintenance; four horses, and the charge of their provender, on a journey of one, though they often come, two hundred miles; and he will find, these several particulars amount to a sum far from being inconsiderable. All this time, the New York farmer is in the course of his proper business, and the unincumbered acquisitions of his calling; for, at a medium, there is scarce a farmer in the province, that cannot transport the fruits of a year's labour, from the best farm, in three days at a proper season, to some convenient landing, where the market will be to his satisfaction, and all the wants from the merchant, cheaply supplied; besides which, one boat shall steal into the harbour of New York, with a lading of more burden and value, than forty waggons, one hundred and sixty horses, and eighty men, into Philadelphia; and perhaps with less noise, bluster, or show than one.</P>
<P>"Prodigious is the advantage we have in this article
<PB N="223" REF="024800_0218_0FCD64181B5F7240"/>alone, I shall not enter into an abstruse calculation, to evince the exact value of it, in all the lights in which it may be considered. Thus much is certain, that barely on account of our easy carriage, the profits of farming with us, exceed those in Pennsylvania, at least by thirty per cent. and that differ∣ence, in favour of our farmers, is of itself sufficient to enrich them; while the others find the disadvantage they are expo∣sed to, so heavy, (especially the remote inhabitants of their country) that a bare subsistence is all they can reasonably hope to obtain. Take this province throughout, the expense of transporting a bushel of wheat, is but two pence for the distance of one hundred miles: but the same quantity, at a like distance in Pennsylvania, will always exceed us one shilling at least. The proportion between us, in the conveyance of every thing else, is nearly the same. How great, then, are the incumbrances to which they are ex∣posed! What an immense charge is saved to us! how sen∣sible must the embarrassments they are subject to, be to a trading people!"</P>

<HEAD>RICHMOND</HEAD>
<P>COUNTY consists of Staten Island, which lies nine miles south westward from the city of New York. It is about eighteen miles long, and, at a medium, six or seven in breadth. On the south side is a considerable tract of good level land; but the island is, in general, rough, and the hills high. The inhabitants are principlally Dutch and French. The former have a church: but the latter having been long without a minister, resort to an episcopal church in Richmond town, a poor mean village, and the only one on the island. The parson of the parish receives 40<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum, raised by a tax upon the county.</P>
<P>Southward of the main coast of this and the colony of Connecticut, lies Long Island, called by the Indians, Ma∣towacs, and named, according to an act of assembly in king William's reign, Nassau. Its length is computed at 120 miles, and the mean breadth twelve. The lands on the north and south side are good, but in the middle, sandy and barren. The southern shore is fortified against any invasion from the sea, by a beach inaccessible to ships, and rarely to be ap∣proached, even by the smallest long-boats, on account of the surge, which breaks upon it with great fury, even when the winds are light. The coast, cast and west, ad∣mits of regular soundings far into the ocean; and as the lands are, in general, low for several hundred miles,
<PB N="224" REF="024800_0219_0FCD641AAF578D78"/>nothing can be more advantageous to our ships, than the high lands of Neversink, near the entrance at the Hook, which are scarce six miles in length, and often seen thirty leagues from the sea.

The inhabitants are divided into Dutch and English presbyterians, episcopalians, and quakers.</P>
<P>There are but two episcopal missionaries in this county, one settled at Jamaica, and the other at Hempstead: and each of them receives 60<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually, levied upon all the in∣habitants.</P>

This large county has been long settled, and except one small episcopal congregation, consists entirely of English presbyte∣rians. Its principal towns are Huntingdon, Smith-town, Brook-haven, Southampton, South-hold, and East-hampton. The farmers are, for the most part, graziers; and, living very re∣mote from New York, a great part of their produce is carried to markets in Boston and Rhode Island. The Indians, who were formerly numerous on this island, are now become very inconsiderable. Those that remain, generally bind themselves servants to the English. The whale fishery, on
<PB N="225" REF="024800_0220_0FCD641C2414B1C0"/>the south side of the island, has declined of late years, through the scarcity of whales, and is now almost entirely neglected.</P>
<P>The Elizabeth Islands, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard, &amp;c. and Pemy Quid, which anciently formed Duke's and the county of Cornwal, are now under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts bay. Sir William Phips demanded them of governor Fletcher, in February 1692-3, not long after the new charter to that province: but the government here was then of opinion, that, that colony was not entitled to any islands westward of Nantucket.</P>

<P>THIS province is not so populous as some have imagined. Scarce a third part of it is under cultivation. The co∣lony of Connecticut, which is vastly inferior to this in its extent, contains, according to a late authentic enquiry, above 133,000 inhabitants, and has a militia of 27,000 men; but the militia of New-York, according to the general esti∣mate, does not exceed 18,000.

<P><PB N="226" REF="024800_0221_0FCD641E23A6E848"/>
Many have been the discouragements to the setlement of this colony. The French and Indian irruptions, to which we have always been exposed, have driven many families into New-Jersey. At home, the British acts for the tran∣sportation of felons, have brought all the American colonies into discredit with the industrious and honest poor, both in the kingdoms of Great-Britain and Ireland. The mischievous tendency of those laws was shown in a late paper, which it may not be improper to lay before the reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The independent reflector.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"It is too well known, that in pursuance of divers acts of parliament, great numbers of fellows who have forfeited their lives to the public, for the most atrocious crimes, are annually transported from home to these plantations. Very surprising one would think, that thieves, burgla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, pickpockets, and cut-purses, and a he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of the most flagi∣tious banditti upon earth, should be sent as agreeable com∣panions to us! That the supreme legislature did intend a transportation to America, for a punishment of these vil∣lains, I verily believe: but so great is the mistake, that confident I am, they are thereby, on the contrary, highly rewarded. For what, in God's name, can be more agreeable to a penurious wretch, driven, through necessity, to seek a livelihood by breaking of houses, and robbing upon the king's highway, than to be saved from the halter, redeem∣ed from the stench of a jail, and transported, passage free, into a country, where, being unknown, no man can re∣proach him with his crimes; where labour is high, a little of which will maintain him; and where all his expenses will be moderate and low. There is scarce a thief in Eng∣land, that would not rather be transported than hanged. Life in any condition, but that of extreme misery, will be preferred to death. As long, therefore, as there remains this wide door of escape, the number of thieves and robbers at home, will perpetually multiply, and their depredations be incessantly reiterated.</P>
<P>"But the acts were intended, for the better peopling the colonies. And will thieves and murderers be conducive to that end? what advantage can we reap from a colony of unrestrainable renegadoes? will they exalt the glory of the crown? or rather, will not the dignity of the most illustri∣ous monarch in the world, be sullied by a province of sub∣jects so lawless, detestable, and ignominious? can agricul∣ture be promoted, when the wild boar of the forest breaks
<PB N="227" REF="024800_0222_0FCD6420C5B54208"/>down our hedges and pulls up our vines? will trade flourish, or manufactures be encouraged, where property is made the spoil of such who are too idle to work, and wicked enough to murder and steal?</P>
<P>"Besides, are we not subjects of the same king, with the people of England—members of the same body politic, and therefore entitled to equal privileges with them? if so, how injurious does it seem to free one part of the dominions, from the plagues of mankind, and cast them upon another? Should a law be proposed, to take the poor of one parish, and billet them upon another, would not all the world, but the parish to be relieved, exclaim against such a project, as iniquitous and absurd? Should the numberless villains of London and Westminster be suffered to escape from their prisons, to range at large, and depreda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any other part of the kingdom, would not every man join with the sufferers, and condemn the measure as hard and unreasonable? And though the hardships upon us, are indeed not equal to those, yet the miseries that flow from laws, by no means intended to prejudice us, are too heavy, not to be felt. But the co∣lonies must be peopled. Agreed: and will the transportation acts ever have that tendency? no, they work the contra∣ry way, and counteract their own design. We want people, 'tis true, but not villains, ready at any time, encouraged by impanity, and habituated upon the flightest occasions, to our a man's throat, for a small part of his property. The delights of such company, is a noble inducement, indeed, to the honest poor, to convey themselves into a strange country. Amidst all our plen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, they will have enough to exercise their virtues, and stand in no need of the association of such, as will prey upon their property, and gorge them∣selves with the blood of the adventurers. They came over in search of happiness; rather than starve, will live any where, and would be glad to be excused from so afflicting an antepart of the torments of hell. In reality, sir, these very laws, though otherwise designed, have turned out, in the end, the most effectual expedients that the art of man could have contrived, to prevent the settlement of these remote parts of the king's dominions. They have actually taken away almost every encouragement to so laud∣able a design. I appeal to facts. The body of the English are struck wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> terror at the thought of coming over to us, not because they have a vast ocean to cross, or leave behind them their friends; or that the country is new and unculti∣vated: but from the shocking ideas, the mind must necessa∣rily form, of the company of inhuman savages, and the
<PB N="228" REF="024800_0223_0FCD6421CE719220"/>more terrible herd of exiled malefactors. There are thou∣sands of honest men, labouring in Europe, at four pence a day, starving in spite of all their efforts, a dead weight to the respective parishes to which they belong; who, with∣out any other qualifications than common sense, health, and strength, might accumulate estates among us, as many have done already. These, and not the others, are the men that should be sent over, for the better peopling the planta∣tions. Great-Britain and Ireland, in their present circum∣stances, are overstocked with them; and he who would immortalize himself, for a lover of mankind, should con∣cert a scheme for the transportation of the industriously honest abroad, and the immediate punishment of rogues and plunderers at home. The pale-faced, half-clad, meagre, and starved skeletons, that are seen in every village of those kingdoms, call loudly for the patriot's generous aid. The plantations, too, would thank him for his assistance, in ob∣taining the repeal of those laws, which, though otherwise intended by the legislature, have so unhappily proved in∣jurious to his own country, and ruinous to us.—It is not long since a bill passed the commons, for the employment of such criminals in his majesty's docks, as should merit the gallows. The design was good. It is consistent with sound policy, that all those, who have forfeited their liberty and lives to their country, should be compelled to labour the residue of their days in its service. But the scheme was bad, and wisely was the bill rejected by the lords, for this only reason, that it had a natural tendency to discredit the king's yards: the consequences of which must have been prejudi∣cial to the whole nation. Just so ought we to reason in the present case; and we should then soon be brought to con∣clude, that though peopling the colonies, which was the laudable motive of the legislature, be expedient to the public; abrogating the transportation laws, must be equal∣ly necessary</P>
<P>The bigotry and tyranny of some of our governors, to∣gether with the great extent of their grants, may also be considered among the discouragements against the full set∣tlement of the province. Most of these gentlemen com∣ing over with no other view than to raise their own fortunes, issued extravagant patents, charged with small quit rents, to such as were able to serve them in as∣sembly: and these patentees being generally men of es∣tates, have rated their lands so exorbitantly high, that very few poor persons could either purchase or lease them. Add to all these, that the New-England planters have always been disaffected to the Dutch, nor was there, after the surren∣der
<PB N="229" REF="024800_0224_0FCD6423AAC23290"/>any foreign accession from the Netherlands. The pro∣vince being thus poorly inhabited, the price of labour be∣came so enormously enhanced, that we have been constrain∣ed to import negroes from Africa, who are employed in all kinds of servitude and trades.</P>
<P>English is the most prevailing language among us, but not a little corrupted by the Dutch dialect, which is still so much used in some counties, that the sheriffs find it difficult to obtain persons sufficiently acquainted with the English tongue, to serve as jurors in the courts of law.</P>
<P>The manners of the people differ, as well as their lan∣guage. In Suffolk and Queen's county, the first settlers of which were either natives of England, or the immediate descendants of such as began the plantations in the eastern colonies, their customs are similar to those prevailing in the English counties, from whence they originally sprang. In the city of New-York, through our intercourse with Europe∣ans, we follow the London fashions; though, by the time we adopt them, they become disused in England. Our af∣fluence during the late war, introduced a degree of luxury in tables, dress and furniture, with which we were before un∣acquainted. But still we are not so gay a people as our neigh∣bours at Boston and several of the southern colonies. The Dutch counties, in some measure, follow the example of New-York, but still retain many modes peculiar to the Hol∣landers.</P>
<P>The city of New-York consists principally of merchants, shopkeepers, and tradesmen, who sustain the reputation of honest, punctual and fair dealers. With respect to riches, there is not so great an inequality among us, as is common in Boston, and in some other places. Every man of industry and integrity has it in his power to live well, and many are the instances of persons, who came here distressed by their po∣verty, who now enjoy easy and plentiful fortunes.</P>
<P>New-York is one of the most social places on the contin∣ent. The men collect themselves into weekly evening clubs. The ladies, in winter, are frequently entertained either at concerts of music or assemblies, and make a very good ap∣pearance. They are comely, and dress well; and scarce any of them have distorted shapes. Tinctured with a Dutch edu∣cation, they manage their families with becoming parsi∣mony, good providence, and singular neatness. The prac∣tice of extravagant gaming, common to the fashionable part of the fair sex, in some places, is a vice with which my countrywomen cannot justly be charged. There is nothing they so generally neglect, as reading, and indeed all the arts
<PB N="230" REF="024800_0225_0FCD6425AFB3D290"/>for the improvement of the mind, in which, I confess, we have set them the example. They are modest, temperate, and charitable; naturally sprightly, sensible, and good-hu∣moured; and, by the help of a more elevated education, would possess all the accomplishments desirable in the sex. Our schools are in the lowest order; the instructors want instruction, and through a long, shameful neglect of all the arts and sciences, our common speech is extremely corrupt; and the evidences of a bad taste, both as to thought and language, are visible in all our proceedings, public and private.</P>
<P>The people, both in town and country, are sober, indus∣trious, and hospitable, though intent upon gain. The richer sort keep very plentiful tables, abounding with great varieties of flesh, fish, fowl, and all kinds of vegetables. The com∣mon drinks are beer, cyder, weak punch, and Madeira wine. For desert, we have fruits in vast plenty, of different kinds and various species.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of estates rarely reside in the country, and hence few or no experiments have yet been made in agricul∣ture. The farms being large, our husbandmen, for that rea∣son, have little recourse to art for manuring and improv∣ing their lands; but it is said, that nature has furnished us with sufficient helps, whenever necessity calls us to use them. It is much owing to the disproportion between the number of our inhabitants, and the vast tracts remaining still to be settled, that we have, as yet, entered, upon scarce any other manufactures, than such as are indispensibly necessary for our home convenience. Felt-making, which is perhaps the most natural of any we could fall upon, was begun some years ago; and hats were exported to the West Indies with great success, till lately prohibited by an act of parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this colony are in general healthy and robust, taller but shorter lived than Europeans, and, both with respect to their minds and bodies, arrive sooner to an age of maturity. Breathing a serene, dry air, they are more sprightly in their natural tempers, than the people of Eng∣land; and hence instances of suicide are here very uncom∣mon. The history of our diseases belongs to a profession with which I am very little acquainted. Few physicians amongst us are eminent for their skill. Quacks abound like locusts in Egypt: and too many have recommended themselves to a full practice and profitable subsistence. This is the less to be wondered at, as the profession is under no kind of regu∣lation. Load as the call is, to our shame be it remembered,
<PB N="231" REF="024800_0226_0FCD6427D0A79490"/>we have no law to protect the lives of the king's subjects, from the malpractice of pretenders. Any man at his plea∣sure sets up for physician, apothecary, and surgeon. No candidates are either examined or licensed, or even sworn to fair practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The necessity of regulating the practice of physic, and a plan for that purpose, were strongly recommended by the author of the independent reflector, in 1753, when the ci∣ty of New-York alone boasted the honour of having above forty gentlemen of that faculty.</NOTE> The natural history of this province would of itself furnish a small volume, and therefore I leave this also to such, as have capacity and leisure to make useful ob∣servations, in that curious and entertaining branch of natu∣ral philosophy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of our trade.</HEAD>
<P>THE situation of New-York with respect to foreign mar∣kets, for reasons elsewhere assigned, is to be preferred to any of our colonies. It lies in the centre of the British plantations on the continent, has at all times a short, easy access to the ocean, and commands almost the whole trade of Connecticut and New-Jersey, two fertile and well-cul∣tivated colonies. The projection of Cape Cod into the Atlantic, renders the navigation from the former to Bos∣ton, at some seasons, extremely perilous; and sometimes the coasters are driven off, and compelled to winter in the West-Indies. But the conveyance to New-York, from the eastward through the sound, is short and unexposed to such dangers. Philadelphia receives as little advantage from New-Jersey, as Boston from Connecticut, because the only rivers which roll through that province, disembogue not many miles from the very city of New-York. Several at∣tempts have been made to raise Perth Amboy into a trading port; but hitherto it has proved to be an unfeasible project. New-York, all things considered, has a much better situa∣tion, and were it otherwise, the city has become too rich and considerable, to be eclipsed by any other town in its neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="024800_0227_0FCD642AE8A3D6D0"/>
Our merchants are compared to a hive of bees, who in∣dustriously gather honey for others—<HI>non vobis me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i ficatis apes.</HI> The profits of our trade centre chiefly in Great-Bri∣tain, and for that reason, methinks, among others, we ought always to receive the generous aid and protection of our mo∣ther country. In our traffic with other places, the balance is almost constantly in our favour. Our exports to the West Indies are bread, pease, rye-meal, Indian corn, apples, oni∣ons, boards, staves, horses, sheep, butter, cheese, pickled oysters, beef, and pork. Flour is also a main article, of which there is shipped about 80,000 barrels per annum. To preserve the credit of this important branch of our staple, we have a good law, appointing officers to inspect and brand every cask before its exportation. The returns are chiefly rum, sugar, and melasses, except cash from Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acoa, and when mules, from the Spanish main, are ordered to Jamaica, and the windward islands, which are generally exchanged for their natural produce; for we receive but lit∣tle cash from our own islands. The balance against them would be much more in our favour, if the indulgence to our sugar colonies, did not enable them to sell their produce at a higher rate than either the Dutch or French islands.</P>
<P>The Spaniards commonly contract for provisions, with merchants in this and the colony of Pennsylvania, very much to the advantage both of the contractors and the pub∣lic, because the returns are wholly in cash. Our wheat, flour, Indian corn, and lumber shipped to Lisbon and Madeira, ba∣lance the Madeira wine imported here.</P>
<P>The logwood trade to the bay of Honduras is very consi∣derable, and was pushed by our merchants with great bold∣ness in the most dangerous times. The exportation of flax∣seed to Ireland is of late very much increased. Between the 9th of December 1755, and the 23d of February following, we shipped off 12, 528 hogsheads. In return for this article, linens are imported, and bills of exch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge drawn, in favour of England, to pay for the dry goods we purchase there. Our logwood is remitted to the English merchants for the same purpose.</P>
<P>The f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r trade, though very much impaired by French wiles and encroachments, ought not to be passed over in si∣lence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is computed that formerly, we exported 150 hogs∣heads of beaver and other fine f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, per annum, and 200 hogsheads of Indian-dressed deer-skins, besides those carri∣ed from Albany into New-England. Skins undressed are usually shipped to Holland.</NOTE> The building of Oswego, has conduced more than any thing else to the preservation of this trade. Peltry of
<PB N="233" REF="024800_0228_0FCD642C4C33FE30"/>all kinds is purchased with rum, ammuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, blankets, strouds, and wampum, or conque-shell bugles. The French fur trade, at Albany, was carried on till the summer 1755; by the Caghnuaga proselytes; and in return for their peltry, they received Spanish pieces of eight, and some other arti∣cles which the French want, to complete their assortment of Indian goods. For the savages prefer the English strouds to theirs: and the French found it their interest to purchase them of us, and transport them to the western Indians on the lakes Erie, Huron, and at the streight of Missilima∣kinac.</P>
<P>Our importation of dry goods from England is so vastly great, that we are obliged to betake ourselves to all possi∣ble arts, to make remittances to the British merchants. It is for this purpose we import cotton from St. Thomas's and Surinam—lime-juice and Nicaragua wood from Curacoa—and logwood from the bay, &amp;c. and yet it drains us of all the silver and gold we can collect. It is computed, that the an∣nual amount of the goods purchased by this colony in Great Britain, is in value not less than 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling; and the sum would be much greater, if a stop was put to all clandestine trade. England is, doubtless, entitled to all our superfluities; because our general interests are closely con∣nected, and her navy is our principal defence. On this ac∣count, the trade with Hamburgh and Holland for duck, chequered linen, oznabrigs, cordage, and tea, is certainly, upon the whole, impolitic and unreasonable; how much so∣ever it may conduce to advance the interest of a few mer∣chants, or this particular colony.</P>
<P>By what measures this contraband trade may be effectual∣ly obstructed, is hard to determine, though it well deserves the attention of a British parliament. Increasing the num∣ber of custom-house officers, will be a remedy worse than the disease. Their salaries would be an additional charge upon the public; for if we argue from their conduct, we ought not to presume upon their fidelity. The exclusive right of the East-India company to import tea, while the colonies purchase it of foreigners 30 per cent. cheaper, must be very prejudicial to the nation. Our people, both in town and country, are shamefully gone into the habit of tea-drinking: and it is supposed we consume of this com∣modity in value near 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling per annum.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="024800_0229_0FCD642FA0A423E0"/>
Some are of opinion, that the fishery of sturgeons; which abound in Hudson's river, might be improved to the great advantage of the colony; and that, if proper measures were concerted, much profit would arise from ship-building and naval stores. It is certain we have timber in vast plenty, oak, white and black pines, fir, locust, red and white mulberry, and cedar; and perhaps there is no soil on the globe, fitter for the production of hemp, than the low lands in the county of Albany. To what I have already said concerning iron ore, a necessary article, I shall add an ex∣tract from the independent reflector.</P>
<P>"It is generally believed, that this province abounds with a variety of minerals. Of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron in particular we have such plenty, as to be excelled by no country in the world of equal extent. It is a metal of intrinsic value beyond any other, and preferable to the purest gold. The former is converted into numberless forms, for as many indispensible uses; the latter, for its portableness and scarcity, is only fit for a medium of trade: but iron is a branch of it, and I am per∣suaded, will, one time or other, be one of the most valuable articles of our commerce. Our annual exports to Boston, Rhode-Island, and Connecticut, and, since the late act of parliament, to England, are far from being inconsiderable. The bodies of iron ore, in the northern parts of this pro∣vince, are so many, their quality so good, and their situati∣on so convenient, in respect of wood, water, hearth-stone, proper fluxes, and carriage, for furnaces, bloomeries, and forges, that with a little attention we might very soon rival the Swedes in the produce of this article. If any American attempts in iron works have proved abortive, and disap∣pointed their undertakers, it is not to be imputed either to the quality of the ore, or a defect of conveniences. The want of more workmen, and the villainy of those we gene∣rally have, are the only causes to which we must attribute such miscarriages. No man, who has been concerned in them will disagree with me, if I assert, that from the founder of the furnace to the meanest banksm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or jobber, they are usually low, profligate, drunken, and faithless. And yet, under all the innumerable disadvantages of such instruments, very large estates have, in this way, been raised in some of our colonies. Our success, therefore, in the iron manufac∣tory, is obstructed and discouraged by the want of work∣men, and the high price of labour, its necessary conse∣quence, and by these alone; but 'tis our happiness, that such only being the cause, the means of redress are entire∣ly in our own hands. Nothing more is wanting to open a
<PB N="235" REF="024800_0230_0FCD6432A1A10628"/>vast sund of riches to the province, in this branch of trade, than the importation of foreigners. If our merchants and landed gentlemen could be brought to a coalition in this de∣sign, their private interests would not be better advanced by it, than the public emolument; the latter, in particular, would thereby vastly improve their lands, increase the num∣ber and raise the rents of their tenants. And I cannot but think, that if those gentlemen, who are too inactive to engage in such an enterprise, would only be at the pains of drawing up full representations of their advantages for iron works, and of publishing them from time to time, in Great-Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Sweden; the province would soon be supplied, with a sufficient number of capable workmen in all the branches of that manufactory."</P>
<P>The money used in this province is silver, gold, British halfpence, and bills of credit. To counterfeit either of them is felony without benefit of clergy; but none, except the latter, and Lion dollars, are a legal tender. Twelve half∣pence, till lately, passed for a shilling; which being much beyond their value in any of the neighbouring colonies, the assembly, in 1753, resolved to proceed, at their next meeting, after the 1st of May ensuing, to the consideration of a method for ascertaining their value. A set of gentlemen, in number seventy-two, took the advantage of the discredit that resolve put upon copper halfpence, and on the 22d of December, subscribed a paper, engaging not to receive or pass them, except at the rate of fourteen coppers to a shil∣ling. This gave rise to a mob, for a few days, among the lower class of people; but some of them being imprisoned, the scheme was carried into execution, and established in every part of the province, without the aid of a law. Our paper bills, which are issued to serve the exigencies of the government, were at first equal to an ounce of silver, then valued at eight shillings. Before the late Spanish war, silver and gold were in great demand, to make remittances for Eu∣ropean goods, and then the bills sunk, an ounce of silver be∣ing worth nine shillings and three pence. During the war, the credit of our bills was well supported, partly by the num∣ber of prizes taken by our privateers, and the high price of our produce abroad; and partly by the logwood trade and the depreciation of the New-England paper money, which gave ours a free circulation through the eastern colonies. Since the war, silver has been valued at about nine shillings and two pence an ounce, and is doubtless fixed there, till our imports exceed what we export. To assist his majesty for removing the late encroachments of the French, we have
<PB N="236" REF="024800_0231_0FCD6434415B1B60"/>issued 80,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to be sunk in short periods, by a tax on estates real and personal; and the whole amount of our paper cur∣rency is thought to be about 160,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>Never was the trade of this province in so flourishing a condition, as at the latter end of the late French war. Above twenty privateers were often out of this port at a time; and they were very successful in their captures. Provisions, which are our staple. bore a high price in the West Indies. The French, distressed through a want of them, gladly received our flags of truce, though sometimes they had but one or two prisoners on board, because they were always loaded with flour, beef, pork, and such like com∣modities. The danger their own vessels were exposed to, induced them to sell their sugars to us at a very low rate. A trade was, at the same time, carried on between Jamaica and the Spanish main, which opened a fine market to the northern colonies, and the returns were, principally, in cash. It was generally thought, that if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had con∣tinued, the greatest part of the produce of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>panish and French settlements in the West Indies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> transported to Great Britain, through some one or other of her colonies; whence we may fairly argue their prodigious importance.</P>
<P>The provincial laws relating to our trade are not very numerous. Those concerned in them, may have recourse to the late edition of our acts at large, published in 1752; and for this reason, I beg to be excused from exhibiting an unentertaining summary of them in this work.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of our religious state.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the acount already given, of the rise and progress of the acts for settling a ministry in four counties, and the observations made concerning our various christian denominations, I have in a great measure anticipated what I at first intended to have ranged under this head.</P>
<P>The principal distinctions among us, are the episcopali∣ans, and the Dutch and English presbyterians; the two last, together with all the other protestants in he colony, are sometimes (perhaps here improperly) called by the ge∣neral name of dissenters; and, compared to them, the episcopalians are, I believe, scarce in the proportion of one to fifteen. Hence partly arises the general discontent on ac∣count of the ministry acts; not so much that the provision
<PB N="237" REF="024800_0232_0FCD64356665CDB0"/>made by them is engrossed by the minor sect, as because the body of the people are for an equal, universal tolera∣tion of protestants, and utterly averse to any kind of eccle∣siastical establishment. The dissenters, though fearless of each other, are all jealous of the episcopal party, being apprehensive that the countenance they may have from home, will foment a lust for dominion, and enable them, in process of time, to subjugate and oppress their fellow subjects. The violent measures of some of our governors have given an alarm to their fears; and if ever any other gentleman, who may be honoured with the chief command of the province, begins to divert himself, by retrenching the privileges and immunities they now enjoy, the con∣fusion of the province will be the unavoidable consequence of his folly. For though his majesty has no other subjects upon whose loyalty he can more firmly depend, yet an ab∣horrence of persecution, under any of its appearances, is so deeply rooted in the people of this plantation; that as long as they continue their numbers and interest in the assembly, no attempt will probably be made upon the rights of conscience, without endangering the public repose.</P>
<P>Of the government of the Dutch churches, I have al∣ready given an account. As to the episcopal clergy, they are missionaries of the English society for propagating the gospel, and ordinarily ordained by the bishop of London, who, having a commission from the king to exercise eccle∣siastical jurisdiction, commonly appoints a clergyman here for his commissary. The ministers are called by the parti∣cular churches, and maintained by the voluntary contribu∣tion of their auditors and the society's annual allowance, there being no law for tythes.</P>
<P>The English presbyterians are very numerous. Those in∣habiting New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the three Delaware counties, are regularly formed, after the manner of the church of Scotland, into consistories or kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods, and will probably soon join in erecting a general assembly. The clergy are ordain∣ed by their fellows, and maintained by their respective congregations. I except those missionaries among the In∣dians, whose subsistence is paid by the society in Scotland for propagating christian knowledge. None of the presby∣terian churches in this province are incorporated, as is the case of many in New Jersey. Their judicatories are upon a very proper establishment, for they have no authority by legal sanctions to enforce their decrees. Nor indeed is
<PB N="238" REF="024800_0233_0FCD6436D3BB21D8"/>any religious sect, among us, legally invested with powerd prejudicial to the common privileges of the rest. The do∣minion of all our clergy is, as it ought to be, merely spi∣ritual. The episcopalians, however, sometimes pretend, that the ecclesiastical establishment in South Britain extends here; but the whole body of the dissenters are averse to the doctrine. The point has been disputed with great fer∣vour, and the sum of the arguments against it is contained in a late paper, which I shall lay before the reader, at large, without any additional refle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions.</P>
<P>It was published in September 1753, under the title of the "Independent Reflector," and is in these words:</P>
<P>The arguments in support of an ecclesiastical establish∣ment, in this province, impartially considered and re∣futed.</P>
<Q><L>—Eripe turpi</L>
<L>Colla jugo: liber, liber sum, dic age.</L>
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>Whether the church of England is equally established in the colonies, as in the southern parts of Great Britain, is a question that has often been controverted. Those who hold the affirmative, have drawn a long train of consequences in favour of the episcopalians, taking it for granted, that the truth is on their side. The presbyterians, independents, congregationalists, anabaptists, quakers, and all those among us, who, in England, would fall under the general denomi∣nation of dissenters, are warm in the negative. I beg leăve, therefore, to interpose in the debate; and as I promised, in the introduction to these papers, to vindicate the reli∣gious, as well as civil rights and privileges of my country∣men; I shall devote this paper to a consideration of so im∣portant a point: to which I am the more strongly inclined, because such establishment has often been urged against the scheme I have proposed for the constitution of our college. My opinion is, that the notion of a general religious esta∣blishment in this province, is entirely groundless. Accord∣ing to the strict rules of controversy, the <HI>onus probandi,</HI> or the burden of the proof, lies upon those who affirm the po∣sition; and it would therefore be sufficient for me barely to deny it. I shall, nevertheless, wave the advantage of this rule of the schools; and, as becomes an impartial advocate for truth, proceed to state the arguments, which are gene∣rally urged in support of an establishment. I shall then show
<PB N="239" REF="024800_0234_0FCD64384D5813A0"/>their insufficiency, and conclude with the particular reasons upon which my opinion is founded.</P>
<P>They who assert, that the church of England is establish∣ed in this province, never, that I have heard of, pretend∣ed that it owes its establishment to any provincial law of our own making. Nor, indeed, is there the least ground for such a supposition. The acts, that establish a ministry in this, and three other counties, do not affect the whole co∣lony; and therefore can by no means be urged in support of a general establishment. Nor were they originally de∣signed to establish the episcopalians in preference or exclu∣sion of any other protestants in those counties to which they are limited. But as the proposition is, that the establish∣ment of the church of England is equally binding here, as in England; so, agreeable thereto, the arguments they ad∣duce are the following:</P>
<P>First, That as we are an English colony, the constitu∣tional laws of our mother country, antecedent to the legis∣lature of our own, are binding upon us; and therefore at the planting of this colony, the English religious establish∣ment immediately took place.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the act, which established the episcopal church in South Britain, previous to the union of England and Scotland, extends to, and equally affects, all the colo∣nies.</P>
<P>These are the only arguments that can be offered with the least plausibility; and if they are shown to be incon∣clusive, the position is disproved, and the arguments, of consequence, must be impertinent and groundless. I shall begin with the examination of the first: and here it must be confessed, for undoubted law, that every new colony, till it has a legislature of its own, is, in general, subject to the laws of the country from which it originally sprang. But that all of them, without distinction, are to be supposed binding upon such planters, is neither agreeable to law nor reason. The laws which they carry with them, and to which they are subject, are such as are absolutely necessary to answer the original intention of our entering into a state of society—such as are requisite, in their new colony state, for the advancement of their and the general pros∣perity —such, without which they will neither be protected in their lives, liberty, or property: and the true reason of their being considered, even subject to such laws, arises from the absolute necessity of their being under some kind of government, their supporting a colony relation and depen∣dence, and the evident fitness of their subjection to the
<PB N="240" REF="024800_0235_0FCD643D576931D0"/>laws of their mother country, with which alone they can be supposed to be acquainted. Even at this day, we extend every general act of parliament which we think reasonable and sit for us, though it was neither designed to be a law upon us, nor has words to include us, and has even been enacted long since we had a legislature of our own. This is a prac∣tice we have introduced for our conveniency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This practice is very dangerous, and is assuming little less than a legislative authority.</NOTE>; but that the English laws, so far as I have distinguished them, should be binding upon us, antecedent to our having a legislature of our own, is of absolute unavoidable necessity. But no such necessity can be pretended, in favour of the introduction of any religious establishment whatsoever; because, it is evident that different societies do exist with different eccle∣siastical laws, or, which is sufficient to my purpose, with∣out such as the English establishment; and that civil socie∣ty, as it is antecedent to any ecclesiastical establishments, is in its nature unconnected with them, independent of them, and all social happiness completely attainable without them.</P>
<P>Secondly, To suppose all the laws of England, without distinction, obligatory upon every new colony, at its im∣plantation, is absurd, and would effectually prevent the subjects from undertaking so hazardous an adventure. Upon such a supposition, a thousand laws will be introduced, in∣consistent with the state of a new country, and destructive of the planters. To use the words of the late attorney ge∣neral, sir Dudley Ryder<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Afterwards lord chief justice of the king's bench. These were his words, in an opinion against the extent of the statute of frauds and perjuries.</NOTE>, "It would be acting the part of an unskilful physician, who should prescribe the same dose to every patient, without distinguishing the variety of dis∣tempers and constitutions." According to this doctrine, we are subject to the payment of tythes, ought to have a spiri∣tual court, and impoverished, as the first settlers of the pro∣vince must have been, they were yet liable to the payment of the land tax. And had this been the sense of our rulers, and their conduct conformable thereto, scarce ever would our colonies have appeared in their present flourishing condi∣tion; especially if it be considered, that the first settlers of most of them, sought an exemption in these American wilds, from the establishment to which they were subject at home.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="024800_0236_0FCD643E5E7735A8"/>
Thirdly, If the planters of every new colony carry with them the established religion of the country from whence they migrate; it follows, that if a colony had been planted when the English nation were pagans, the establishment in such colony must be paganism alone: and, in like manner, had this colony been planted while popery was established in England, the religion of papists must have been our es∣tablished religion; and if it is our duty to conform to the religion established at home, we are equally bound, against conscience and the bible, to be pagans, papists, or pro∣testants, according to the particular religion they shall please to adopt. A doctrine that can never be urged, but with a very ill grace indeed, by any protestant minister.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If the church of England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> established in this colony, it must either be founded on acts of parliament, or the common law. That it is not established by the first, I shall prove in the sequel; and that it cannot be established by the common law, appears from the following consider∣ations.</P>
<P>The common law of England, properly defined, consists of those general laws to which the English have been accustom∣ed, from time, whereof there is no memory to the contrary: and every law, deriving its validity from such immemorial custom, must be carried back as far as to the reign of Richard I. whose death happened on the 6th of April 1199. But the present establishment of the church of England was not till the fifth year of queen Anne. And hence it is apparent, that the establishment of the church of England; can never be argued from the common law, even in England; nor could be any part of it, since it depends not for its validity upon custom immemorial. And therefore, though it be admitted, that every English colony is subject to the common law of the realm, it by no means follows, that the church of Eng∣land is established in the colonies; because, the common law knows of no such religious establishment, nor considers any religious establishment whatever, as any part of the English constitution. It does, indeed, encourage religion; but that, and a particular church government, are things entirely different.</P>
<P>I proceed now to a consideration of the second argument insisted on, to prove an episcopal establishment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the colo∣nies, founded on the act which established the church of England, passed in the fifth year of queen Anne, recited and ratified in the act for an union of the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. And that this act does not establish the church of England in the colonies, has been so fully
<PB N="242" REF="024800_0237_0FCD643FD1E67560"/>shown by mr. Hobart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A minister of one of the churches at Fairfield, in Con∣necticut.</NOTE>, in his second address to the episco∣pal separation in New England, that I shall content myself with an extract from the works of that ingenious gentle∣man, which, with very little alteration, is as follows:</P>
<P>"The act we are now disputing about, was made in the fifth year of queen Anne, and is entitled, an act for secu∣ring the church of England, as by law established. The oc∣casion of the statute was this: the parliament in Scotland, when treating of an union with England, were apprehen∣sive of its endangering their ecclesiastical establishment. Scotland was to have but a small share in the legislature of Great Britain, but forty-five members in the house of com∣mons, which consists of above five hundred; and but six∣teen in the house of lords, which then consisted of near an hundred, and might be increased by the sovereign at plea∣sure. The Scots, therefore, to prevent having their ecclesi∣astical establishment repealed in a British parliament, where they might be so easily out-voted by the English members, passed an act, previous to the union, establishing the presbyterian church within the kingdom of Scotland, in perpetuity, and made this act an essential and funda∣mental part of the union, which might not be repealed, or altered by any subsequent British parliament; and this put the English parliament upon passing this act for securing the church of England. Neither of them designed to en∣large the bounds of their ecclesiastical constitution, or extend their establishment farther than it reached before, but only to secure and perpetuate it, in its then present ex∣tent. This is evident, not only from the occasion of the act, but from the charitable temper the English parlia∣ment was under the influence of, when they passed it. The lord North and Grey offered a rider to be added to the bill for an union, viz. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it might not extend to an appro∣bation or acknowledgment of the truth of the presbyterian way of worship, or allowing the religion of the church of Scotland to be what it is stiled, the true protestant religion. But this clause was rejected. A parliament that would ac∣knowledge the religion of the church of Scotland, to be the true protestant religion, and allow their acts to extend to an approbation of the presbyterian way of worship, though they might think it best to secure and perpetuate the church of England within those bounds, wherein it was before
<PB N="243" REF="024800_0238_0FCD6441693817F0"/>established, can hardly be supposed to have designed to extend it beyond them.</P>
<P>"The title of the act is exactly agreeable to what we have said of the design of it, and of the temper of the par∣liament that passed it. 'Tis entitled, an act not for enlarg∣ing, but for securing the church of England, and that not in the American plantations, but as it is now by law estab∣lished; which plainly means no more than to perpetuate it within its ancient boundaries.</P>
<P>"The provision, made in the act itself, is well adapted to this design; for it enacts, that the act of the thirteenth of Elizabeth, and the act of uniformity, passed in the thir∣teenth year of Charles II. and all and singular other acts of parliament, then in force for the establishment and preser∣vation of the church of England, should remain in full force forever; and that every succeeding sovereign should, at his coronation, take and subscribe an oath to main∣tain and preserve inviolably the said settlement of the church of England, as by law established, within the king∣doms of England and Ireland, the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the territories there∣unto belonging. This act doth not use such expressions, as would have been proper and even necessary, had the design been to have made a new establishment; but only such as are proper to ratify and confirm an old one. The settlement, which the king is sworn to preserve, is re∣presented as existing previously to the passing this act, and not as made by it. The words of the oath are, to maintain and preserve inviolably the said settlement. If it be asked, what settlement? The answer must be, a settlement here∣tofore made and confirmed by certain statutes, which, for the greater certainty and security, are enumerated in this act, and declared to be unalterable. This is the settlement the king is sworn to preserve; and this settlement has no relation to us in America. For the act, which originally made it, did not reach hither; and this act, which perpetu∣ates them, does not extend them to us.</P>
<P>It is a mistake to imagine, that the word territories ne∣cessarily means these American colonies. "These countries are usually, in law, as well as other writings, stiled colonies or plantations, and not territories. An instance of this we have in the charter to the 'society for propaga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the gospel in foreign parts." And it is the invariable practice of the legislature, in every act of parliament, both before and after this act, designed to affect us, to use the words colo∣nies, or plantations. Nor is it to be supposed, that, in so im∣portant
<PB N="244" REF="024800_0239_0FCD6445827F5010"/>a matter, words of so direct and broad an intent, would have been omitted. "The islands of Jersey and Guernsey were properly territories belonging to the king∣dom of England, before the union took place: and they stand in the same relation to the kingdom of Great Britain since. The church of England was established in these islands, and the legislature intended to perpetuate it in them, as well as in England itself; so that as these islands were not particularly named in the act, there was occasion to use the word territories even upon the supposition, that they did not design to make the establishment more exten∣sive than it was before this law passed." Further, in order to include the plantations in the word territories, we must suppose it always to mean every other part of the do∣minions not particularly mentioned in the instrument that uses it, which is a construction that can never be admitted: for, hence it will follow, that those commissions, which give the government of a colony, and the territories there∣on depending in America (and this is the case of every one of them) extend to all the American colonies, and their governors must of consequence have reciprocal superinten∣dencies; and should any commission include the word ter∣ritories generally, unrestricted to America, by the same con∣struction, the governor therein mentioned, might exercise an authority under it, not only in America, but in Africa and the Indies, and even in the kingdom of Ireland, and perhaps, in the absence of the king, in Great-Britain itself. Mr. Hobart goes on, and argues against the establishment, from the light in which the act of union has, ever since it was passed, been considered.</P>
<P>"Dr. Bisse, bishop of Hereford, (says he) a member of the society, preached the annual sermon, February 21, 1717, ten years after the act of union took place; and he says, it would have well become the wisdom wherewith that great work (the reformation or establishment of the church of England) was conducted in this kingdom, that this for∣eign enterprise (the settlement of plantations in America) also should have been carried on by the government in the like regular way. But he owns the government at home did not interpose in the case, or establish any form of religion for us. In truth (says his lordship) the whole was left to the wisdom of the first proprietors, and to the conduct of every private man. He observes, that of late years the civil interest hath been regarded, and the dependence of the co∣lonies, on the imperial crown of the realm, secur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: but then, with regard to the religion of the plantations, his
<PB N="245" REF="024800_0240_0FCD644747E12E70"/>lordship acknowledges, that the government itself here at home, sovereign as it is, and invested, doubtless, with suf∣ficient authority there, hath not thought fit to interpose in this matter, otherwise than in this charitable way: it hath enabled us to ask the benevolence of all good christians, to∣wards the support of missionaries to be sent among them. Thus bishop Bisse thought as I do, and that the act of union, nor any other law prior thereto, did extend the establishment to the plantations: and if the society had not been of the same opinion, they would hardly have printed and dispers∣ed his sermon. Neither did the civil rulers of the nation, who may justly be supposed acquainted with its laws, think the act of union, or any other law, established the church of England in America. This is plain from the let∣ter of the lords justices to governor Dummer, in the year 1725, almost twenty years after the union, wherein they say, there is no regular establishment of any national or provincial church in these plantations.</P>
<P>"If it be urged, that the king's commission to the late bishop of London, proves an ecclesiastical establishment here, it is sufficient to answer, that his lordship was remark∣able for skill in the laws, so far as they relate to ecclesi∣astical affairs, as appears from his codex; and he was of the contrary opinion; for in his letter to dr. Colman, of May 24, 1735, he writes thus: my opinion has always been, that the religious state of New England is founded in an equal liberty to all protestants; none of which can claim the name of a national establishment, or any kind of supe∣riority over the rest. This opinion the bishop gave not only since the act of union, but even seven years after he had re∣ceived his commission; and surely it must be admitted, that as he had time enough to consider it, so he, of all others, best understood it." Thus far mr. Hobart. With respect to the act of union, I beg leave only to subjoin, that it is highly probable, the Scotch parliament believed the English intended to establish their church only in England. For in the close of the act, by which they had established the pres∣byterian church in Scotland, it is declared, in these express words, "That the parliament of England may provide for the security of the church of England, as they think ex∣pedient, to take place within the bounds of the said king∣dom of England." And whatever latitude the word king∣dom has in common speech, it, in a legal sense, is limited to England, properly so called, and excludes the planta∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="024800_0241_0FCD6448CE5CE140"/>
Nor can we suppose, that the church of England is estab∣lished in these colonies, by any acts prior to the act of union above considered. For, besides the several opinions, against such supposition, already adduced, it is unreasona∣ble to imagine, that if there was any such establishment, king Charles II. in direct repugnancy thereto, should have made the grant of Pennsylvania, and given equal privileges to all religions in that province, without even excepting the Roman catholics; and that the colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and the Massachusetts bay, should be permit∣ted to make their provincial establishments, in opposition to an antecedent establishment of the church of England, es∣pecially as the laws of the Massachusetts bay province, are constantly sent home, and the king has the absolute power of repealing every act he should think improper to be con∣tinued as a law. Whoever, therefore, considers this, and that the king is sworn to preserve the church of England estab∣lishment, must necessarily conclude, that whatever senti∣ments may obtain among the episcopalians in America, our kings and their councils have always conceived that such establishment could by no means be extended to us. As to Connecticut, all the episcopalians of that colony, and even their ministers, were legally compellable to contribute to an annual tax for the support of the congregational clergy, till of late they were favoured with a law which grants them a privilege of exemption from that iniquitous and unreasonable burden. But whether they are subject to the like unchristian imposition in the other colonies above men∣tioned, I am not sufficiently acquainted with their laws to determine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe there is no just cause for the complaints trans∣mitted by the missionaries. Dr. Douglass assigns several in∣stances of gross misrepresentations and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoods. Vid. his summary, 2d vol. p. 129. Boston edit. 1752, and the Watch Tower, no. XLI. published at New York in 1755.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>The thirteenth number of the Watch Tower published at New York in 1755, espouses the same side with the au∣thor of the Reflector, adds several new arguments and the opinions of eminent counsel at law, and considers the force of what is advanced by the late dr. Douglass in favour of his position, that the religious state of the American plan∣tations is an universal toleration of protestants of every denomination.</P>
<P>The clergy of this province are, in general, but indif∣ferently
<PB N="247" REF="024800_0242_0FCD644A4F662768"/>supported: it is true they live easily: but few of them leave any thing to their children. The episcopal mis∣sionaries, for enlarging the sphere of their secular business, not many years ago, attempted, by a petition to the late governor Clinton, to engross the privilege of solemnizing all marriages. A great clamoar ensued, and the attempt was abortive. Before that time, the ceremony was even per∣formed by justices of the peace, and the judges at law have determined such marriages to be legal. The governor's li∣cences now run to all "protestant ministers of the gospel." Whether the justices act still, when the bans are published in our churches, which is customary only with the poor, I have not been informed. Marriage in a new country ought to have the highest encouragements; and it is on this ac∣count, perhaps, that we have no provincial law against such as are clandestine, though they often happen, and, in some cases, are attended with consequences equally melancholy and mischievous.</P>
<P>As to the number of our clergymen, it is large enough at present, there being but few settlements unsupplied with a ministry, and some superabound. In matters of religion, we are not so intelligent in general, as the inhabitants of the New England colonies; but both in this respect and good morals, we certainly have the advantage of the southern provinces. One of the king's instructions to our governors, recommends the investigation of means for the conversion of negroes and Indians. An attention to both, especially the latter, has been too little regarded. If the missionaries of the English society for propagating the gospel, instead of being seated in opulent christianized towns, had been sent out to preach among the savages, unspeakable political ad∣vantages would have flowed from such a salutary measure. Dr. Douglass, a sensible, immethodical writer, often incor∣rect, expects too much<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Our young missionaries may procure a perpetual al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance and commercial advantages with the Indians, which the Roman catholic clergy cannot do, because they are for∣bid to marry. I mean our missionaries may intermarry with the daughters of the sachems and other considerable Indi∣ans, and their progeny will forever be a certain cement between us and the Indians." Dougl. Sum. &amp;c. vol. II. p. 138, Boston edit. 1753.</NOTE>: besides, he treats the missionaries with rudeness and contempt and lashes their indolence with unmerciful acrimony.</P>

They are changeable at the king's plea∣sure, but rarely undergo any very considerable altera∣tion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The salary, generally granted to the governor by the in∣structions, is 1200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling out of the revenue here; but that being an insufficient fund, the assembly, in lieu of it, give him annually 1560<ABBR>l.</ABBR> currency. The perquisites perhaps amount to as much more.</P>
<P>This office was formerly very lucrative, but becomes daily less considerable, because almost all the valuable tracts of land are already taken up.</P>
<P>The council, when full, consists of twelve members, ap∣pointed by the king's mandamus and sign manual. All their privileges and powers are contained in the instructions. They are a privy council to the governor, in acts of civil govern∣ment; and take the same oath administered to the king's council in England. The tenure of their places is extreme∣ly precarious, and yet their influence upon the public mea∣sures very considerable. In the grant of all patents, the go∣vernor is bound to consult them, and regularly they cannot pass the seal without their advice.</P>
<P>They enjoy a legislative power, as the lords do in par∣liament; and exercise also judicial authority upon writs of error and appeals. They are convened by the governor; and he is always present when they sit as a court or privy council, which is ordinarily at the fort. In their legislative capacity, they meet without the governor, and always at the city hall. They sit according to their seniority, and the eldest member present is speaker of their house. In a com∣mittee, the chairman has no voice. They cannot vote by proxy, but have the privilege of entering their dissent, and the reasons at large, on their minutes. Their proceedings are very formal, and in many respects they imitate the example of the lords. Their messages to the assembly are carried by one of their own members, and the house always rises at his entrance and receives them standing. The coun∣cil never publish their legislative minutes; but the assembly always print their own votes; nor do either of these houses permit strangers to be present at their conventions,</P>

<P>The business in council daily increases, and is now become very burdensome, being entirely transacted by a few mem∣bers. Mr. Colden resides in the country; mr. Clarke in England; mr. Rutherford, being an officer, moves with the army, and sir William Johnson has his residence in the wes∣tern part of the county of Albany.</P>
<P>The general assembly consists of twenty-seven represen∣tatives, chosen by the people, in pursuance of a writ of summons issued by the governor.</P>
<P>At the day appointed for their appearance, such as are elected, convene themselves at the assembly-chamber, in the city of New-York; and, by the clerk of the house, in∣form the governor of their meeting. If they are above thir∣teen in number, some persons (generally the judges of the supreme court) are sent to the assembly chamber, empower∣ed by a commission to take their oaths and subscriptions. They are then called before his excellency, who recom∣mends their choice of a speaker. For that purpose they again retire, and conduct the person they elect into the chair, which is seated at the upper end of a long table. Af∣ter that he is presented to his excellency in the council chamber; and upon his approbation of their choice, which is of course, the speaker addresses himself to the governor, and, in behalf of the house, prays, "that their words and actions may have a favourable construction, that the mem∣bers may have free access to him, and they and their ser∣vants be privileged with a freedom from arrests." The go∣vernor, after promising these things on his part, reads his
<PB N="259" REF="024800_0254_0FCD64663465C5C8"/>speech to both houses; and, at the request of the speaker, delivers a copy for the use of the assembly.</P>
<P>I need not enlarge upon the customs of the general as∣sembly, for they take the practice of the British house of commons for their model, and vary from them in but very few instances. Money bills are not returned to them by the council board, as the lords do to the commons; and yet the reasons for this practice are much stronger here than at home. When the governor passes the bills sent up to him, both houses are present in the council chamber. It is then customary for him to ask the advice of his council with re∣spect to every bill, and he signs them at the foot after these words, "I assent to this bill, enacting the same, and order it to be enrolled." After that the acts are published in the open-street near the city hall; his excellency and the two houses being present.</P>

<P>The continuance of our assemblies was unlimited, till the political struggles, which took rise in mr. Cosby's adminis∣tration, forced mr. Clarke, who succeeded him, to pass the act restricting them to three years: but this was repealed by the king, and a septennial law enacted soon after the arrival of governor Clinton, which is still in full force.</P>
<P>No colony, upon the continent, has formerly suffered more than ours, in the opinion of the king's ministers. This has been owing to the ill impressions made by our go∣vernors, who are scarce ever disengaged from disputes with the lower house. Our representatives, agreeable to the ge∣neral sense of their constituents, are tenacious in their opi∣nion, that the inhabitants of this colony are entitled to all the privileges of Englishmen; that they have a right to participate in the legislative power; and that the session of assemblies here, is wisely substituted instead of a representa∣tion in parliament, which, all things considered, would, at this remote distance, be extremely inconvenient and dangerous. The governors, on the other hand, in general, entertain political sentiments of a quite different nature. All the immunities we enjoy, according to them, not only flow from, but absolutely depend upon, the mere grace and will of the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We are no more than a little corporation.—I would advise these gentlemen (assemblies) for the future, to drop those parliamentary airs and style about liberty and proper∣ty, and keep within their sphere, and make the best use they can of his majesty's instructions and commission; be∣cause it would be high treason to sit and act without it.—This is our charter. If we abuse or make a wicked use of his majesty's favours, we are, of them, but tenants at will; we only hold them, during pleasure and good behaviour." These are the accurate and bright thoughts of the gentle∣man who published a pamphlet, entitled "an essay on the government of the colonies," in 1752. Sir William Jones, attorney general to James II. was of a very different opinion. For he told the king, "that he could no more grant a com∣mission to levy money on his subjects in the plantations, without their consent by an assembly, than they could dis∣charge themselves from their allegiance." Life of sir William Phips. p. 23.</NOTE>. It is easy to conceive, that contentions
<PB N="261" REF="024800_0256_0FCD64691D307150"/>must naturally attend such a contradiction of sentiments. Most of our disputes however relate to the support of go∣vernment. Before lord Cornbury's embezzlements, the re∣venue was established for a long period, but afterwards re∣duced to a few years. The violent measures, in mr. Cosby's time, led the assembly to the scheme of an annual provision. These are the words of that much famed address of the house, to lieutenant governor Clarke, on the 8th of Septem∣ber 1737, previous to the change.</P>
<P>"The true causes of the deficiency of the revenue, we believe, are too well known to your honour, to make it ne∣cessary for us to say much on that head. Had the conspicuous loyalty of the inhabitants of this province, met with a suita∣ble treatment in return, it is not unlikely, but we should now be weak enough to act like others before us, in being lavish beyond our abilities, and raising sums unnecessary to be given; and continued the donation, like them, for a longer time than what was convenient for the safety of the inhabitants: but experience has shown the imprudence of such a conduct; and the miserable condition, to which the province is reduced, renders the raising of large sums very difficult, if not impracticable. We therefore beg leave to be plain with your honour, and hope you will not take it amiss, when we tell you, that you are not to expect, that we either will raise sums unfit to be raised; or put what we shall raise into the power of a governor to misapply, if we can prevent it: nor shall we make up any other deficiencies, than what we conceive are fit and just to be paid; or continue what support or revenue we shall raise, for any longer time than one year. Nor do we think it convenient to do even that, until such laws are passed, as we conceive necessary for the safety of the inhabitants of this colony, who have reposed a trust in us for that only purpose; and which we are sure you will think it reasonable we should act agreeable to; and by the grace of God we will endeavour not to deceive them."</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="024800_0257_0FCD646A9BC05308"/>
The sentiments of this address still prevail among the peo∣ple; and therefore the success of the present solicitations, for a permanent, indefinite support, will probably be in vain.</P>
<P>The matter has been often litigated with great fervency on both sides, and the example of the British parliament urged as a precedent for our imitation. To this it is an∣swered, that the particular state of this province differs so widely from that of their mother country, that we ought not in this respect to follow the custom of the commons. Our constitution, as some observe, is so imperfect in num∣berless instances, that the rights of the people lie, even now, at the mere mercy of their governors; and granting a per∣petual support, it is thought, would be in reality little less, than the loss of every thing dear to them.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, that many plausible arguments may be assigned, in support of the jealousy of the house. A go∣vernor has numberless opportunities, not proper to be men∣tioned, for invading the rights of the people; and insuper∣able difficulties would necessarily attend all the means of redress.</P>
<P>By gradual advances, at seasonable junctures, we might have introduced such amendments, as would, at this day, have established a sound and well fortified political frame; but through our utter neglect of education, the ancient as∣semblies consisted of plain, illiterate husbandmen, whose views seldom extended farther than to the regulation of highways, the destruction of wolves, wild cats, and foxes, and the advancement of the other little interests of the par∣ticular counties, which they were chosen to represent.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of our laws and courts.</HEAD>
<P>THE state of our laws opens a door to much controver∣sy. The uncertainty, with respect to them, renders property precarious, and greatly exposes us to the arbitrary decisions of bad judges. The common law of England is generally received, together with such statutes, as were enacted before we had a legislature of our own. But our courts exercise a sovereign authority, in determining what
<PB N="263" REF="024800_0258_0FCD646C1AEB24D0"/>parts of the common and statute law ought to be extended; for it must be admitted, that the difference of circumstances necessarily requires us, in some cases, to reject the determi∣nations of both. In many instances, they have also extend∣ed, as I have elsewhere observed, even acts of parliament, passed since we have had a distinct legislation, which is ad∣ding greatly to our confusion. The practice of our courts is not less uncertain than the law. Some of the English rules are adopted and others rejected. Two things, therefore, seem to be absolutely necessary for the public security.</P>
<P>First, The passing an act for settling the extent of the English laws. And,</P>
<P>Secondly, That the courts ordain a general set of rules for the regulation of the practice.</P>
<P>To give a particular account of our laws, civil and crimi∣nal, cannot be expected in this work. All lands are held of the crown by socage tenure, as those of East-Greenwich, at home, in the county of Kent; and the manner of obtain∣ing a title to such as are vacant, or in the possession of the Indians, is this:</P>
<P>Formerly the custom was to apply to the governor in council, for a license to purchase lands of the natives in his majesty's name. A deed was then privately obtained from the Indian proprietors to the king, and annexed to a second petition to the governor, for a warrant to the surveyor-ge∣neral, to make a survey of the quantity purchased. Another warrant, upon the return of the survey, was then issued to the attorney-general, to prepare a draught of the patent; which being transmitted to the secretary's office, was then engrossed upon parchment, and the great seal affixed to it by the governor.</P>
<P>In these surveys and deeds, more lands were often inclu∣ded, than the Indians intended to sell; and these frauds being frequently complained of, an order was made by the governor and council in 1736, that thenceforth no Indian deed should be taken, until the land proposed to be grant∣ed, was actually surveyed by the surveyor-general, or one of his deputies, in the presence of the Indian proprietors; that the bounds of the tract should be then entered in the deed, and a certificate endorsed, that they are agreeable to the survey, and that he saw the consideration money or goods, <HI>bonâ fide,</HI> delivered to the vendors.</P>
<P>The patenting of lands, has long been, and still continues to be, very expensive.</P>
<P>Our law judicatories are numerous; I begin with the lowest.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE JUSTICES' COURT.</HEAD>
<P>JUSTICES of the peace are appointed by commission from the governors, who, to serve their purposes in elections, sometimes grant, as it is called, the administration to parti∣cular favourites in each county, which is the nomination of officers civil and military; and by these means, the justices have been astonishingly multiplied. There are instances of some who can neither write nor read<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon's observation, that there are many who count it a credit to be burdened with the office of a justice of the peace, is very applicable to us.

These genii, besides their ordinary powers, are by acts of assembly enabled to hold courts, for the determination of small causes of five pounds and under; but the parties are pri∣vileged, if they choose it, with a jury of six men. The proceedings are in a summary way, and the conduct of the justices has given just cause to innumerable complaints. The justices have also a jurisdiction, with re∣spect to crimes under the degree of grand larceny. For any three of them (one being of the quorum) may try the criminal, without a jury, and inflict punishments not ex∣tending to life or limb.</P>

<HEAD>THE SESSIONS AND COURT OF COMMON-PLEAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE court of common-pleas takes cognizance of all causes, where the matter in demand is in value above five pounds. It is established by an ordinance of the go∣vernor in council. The judges are ordinarily three, and hold their offices during pleasure. Through the infancy of the country, few, if any of them, are acquainted with the law. The practice of these courts is similar to that of the common-bench, at Westminster. They have each a clerk commissioned by the governor, who issues their writs, en∣ters their minutes, and keeps the records of the county. They are held twice every year. These judges, together with some of the justices, hold, at the same time, a court of general sessions of the peace.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUPREME COURT.</HEAD>
<P>THE jurisdiction of this court extends through the whole province; and its powers are very great. For it takes cognizance of all causes, civil and criminal, as fully as the king's bench and common pleas, at Westminster. In civil controversies, the value of the sum demanded must exceed twenty pounds. This court has four terms in a year, and al∣ways sits at New York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The terms commence on the third Tuesdays in January, April, and October, and on the last in July. The first and the last continue five days, and the two other terms ten.</NOTE>. The judges, for many years past, have been but three. The chief justice has ten shillings as a perquisite, upon the first motion in every cause, together with an annual allowance of three hundred pounds. The second and third justices have also yearly appointments, too in∣considerable to be worth mentioning. They hold their of∣fices by separate commissions under the great seal of the province, which were formerly during pleasure, but of late <HI>quam diu se bene gesserint</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prosecutions, by information, are often commenced in the supreme court by order of the governor and council, and criminals sometimes committed by their warrants; for which reason some are of opinion, that the judges ought not to be members of that board, which is frequently the case.</NOTE></P>
<P>The supreme court was, at first, established by several laws of the province; but the terms were, afterwards, di∣rected by an ordinance of the governor and council, which is alterable at pleasure.</P>
<P>Whether this court has a right to determine causes in a course of equity, was a question much ligitated during the troubles, in the several administrations of mr. Cosby and mr. Clarke. Colonel Morris, afterwards governor of New Jersey, sat then as chief justice upon the bench, and de∣livered a long argumentative opinion in the negative<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the printed opinion, and the arguments of messieurs Alexander and Smith, for the defendent, Van Dam, adver∣ses the attorney general; in support of a plea to the juris∣diction of the supreme court, on a bill filed there for gover∣nor Cosby in a course of equity.

<PB N="266" REF="024800_0261_0FCD64738DEEAA68"/>court bell scarce ever rung, but the city was all in con∣fusion. Petitions against the court, from several parts of the province, came up to the assembly, who desired to hear council; and accordingly mr. Smith and mr. Murray, de∣livered their opinions at their request, both which were afterwards printed by their order. The former, who spoke first, urged numerous authorities, to prove that no court of equity could be legally established except by prescription or an act of the legislature, and concluded with these words—"'Tis with the greatest submission that I tender my opinion upon these points. I have said nothing with a design to of∣fend any man, nor have I omitted saying any thing, that I thought might tend to the public good. <HI>Liberavi animam meam.</HI> I have endeavoured to discharge the trust, and sup∣port the character, with which this house has honoured me. You have my sincere and real sentiments. If I have erred in any thing, it has been unwillingly. I am heartily a friend to this colony, and earnestly wish its prosperity. I have no interest in the points in question, but what are common to all the freemen of this province. I profess the greatest veneration for the laws of my country, and am glad of every opportunity to do them public honour. They place our liberties upon the firmest basis, and put our properties under the surest protection. I rejoice in the security that we have of a long enjoyment of them, by the settlement of the succession in the house of Hanover. 'Tis the excel∣lency of our constitution, and the glory of our princes, that they are sovereign over freemen and not slaves. 'Tis the misery of an arbitrary government, that a man can enjoy nothing under it that he can call his own. Life, liberty, and property, are not his, but all at the will and disposal of his tyrannical owner. I don't wonder that our ancestors have been always so jealous of their liberties: how oft have they bravely fought, and nobly died, in the defence of them? We have received our liberties and our laws, as an inheri∣tance transmitted to us in the blood of our fathers. How highly, therefore, should we prize and value them! And what care should we take, that we and our posterity may en∣joy them in their full extent? If this be our happy case, <HI>we shall sit under our own vines and our own fig-trees, and none will make us afraid.</HI> We shall see our country flourish, and ourselves a happy people. But if an arbitrary power over our liberties and properties be let in upon us, but at a back door, it will certainly drive many of us out of our habita∣tions; and 'tis to be feared, will once more reduce our
<PB N="267" REF="024800_0262_0FCD64761C614DF8"/>country to a wilderness, and a land without inhabitant: which we doubt not but this honourable house will take care to prevent."</P>
<P>Mr. Murray laboured to show, that the chancery, king's bench, common pleas and exchequer, were of original juris∣diction, by the constitution of England; and was fearful that our establishment of these courts here, by an act of as∣sembly, would draw into question our equal rights to all the liberties and privileges of Englishmen. He closed his opinion in this manner:</P>
<P>"And now, mr. speaker, I have in the best manner that I was capable of, performed what this honourable house desired of me, in giving truly my sentiments upon the sub∣ject matter of these petitions.</P>
<P>"Mr. Smith, in delivering his sentiments last Friday, did in so handsome and elegant a manner, fully prove that the people of this colony are undoubtedly entitled to the customs, laws, liberties, and privileges of Englishment, that it was needless for me to attempt the proof thereof, which otherwise I should have done. But I do entirely agree with him, in all that he said on that head; and I hope I have proved, that the fundamental courts, by the laws of England, are as much part of those liberties and privileges, and as much by the customs and laws of England, as any other of their liberties and privileges are; and of conse∣quence, the people here as much entitled to those funda∣mental courts, as to their other privileges; and have en∣deavoured to answer all the objections that I had heard were, or thought could be, made against our being entitled to the same courts. And upon the whole thereof, as there has been much talked about the liberties and privileges of the people, I would beg leave only to propound this one question, who is he that argues most in favour of the liber∣ties of the people? He who affirms and proves, that they are entitled to those liberties and privileges, laws and cus∣toms of England, and the good old original courts, that are by those laws, without an act? or, he who argues and says, we are not entitled to them, until an act is passed to establish them? I suppose the answer would be given, with∣out hesitation, in favour of the former.</P>
<P>"But, mr. speaker, if it yet should be said, that there is a necessity for making acts, relating to those courts, I would beg leave to offer to this honourable house, the imitation of such laws relating to those courts, as the wise legislature of England have thought sit to make. I presume, it will not be said, there can be a better pattern offered for the as∣sembly
<PB N="268" REF="024800_0263_0FCD64774BA31488"/>to go by. And it is not to be supposed, but that the parliament at home has made all the regulations therein that can be thought necessary; whereas going into new schemes and new inventions, may be attended with many inconveniences, which, when they happen, may not be so easily remedied.</P>
<P>"And I beg leave to conclude, by praying that God Al∣mighty may guide, direct, and influence this honourable house, in their debates and consultations upon this momen∣tous affair, and that the end thereof may be for the good of all the inhabitants of this colony."</P>
<P>The opposition, to the exchequer, became now stronger than before the council were heard. And therefore, under these discouragements, the court has taken cognizance of no causes since Van Dam's, nor has that indeed ever been determined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Randolph wrote his sentiments concerning these disputes to captain Pearse.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By your request, I have perused and considered the arguments of mr. Smith and mr. Murray, before the ge∣neral assembly of New-York, in relation to the court of equity established there in a new court of exchequer; which, I perceive, was done, principally, for determining a dis∣pute between the governor and the president of the council, about their right to the salary annexed to the office of the commander in chief, whether he be the governor or presi∣dent; and it seems strange to me, that upon such an occa∣sion, so extraordinary a step should be taken, as the erect∣ing of a new court, exempted from the rules of the pro∣ceeding at the common law, when the matter might have been decided in an action of the case upon an <HI>indebitatus assumpsit,</HI> which is the settled method and most expeditious remedy, in cases of that nature.</P>
<P>Both these gentlemen seem to have agreed in one point, that it was necessary to trace the court of chancery and the equity court in the exchequer back to their original insti∣tution, in order to show whether the governor of a new plantation, hath a power or not, to erect courts, in imita∣tion of these high and ancient courts in England.—And from their researches, they seem to have made very different conclusions. Mr. Smith rightly concludes against the lega∣lity of this court; but mr. Murray is afraid all must be lost, if the four fundamental courts, as he calls them, cannot be obtained in New York.—I own I do not understand the force of this sort of reasoning; nor can I conceive, how any enquiry into the original of the high court of chancery, which mush, after all, end in a mere conjecture, can afford the least assistance, in forming a right judgment upon this question, which must depend upon the particular constitu∣tion of these foreign colonies.—</P>
<P>The court of chancery, in England, has its being from custom and usage, to which it owes its legality.—If it were to be erected now by the king's power, it could not stand; therefore it is undoubtedly a great absurdity to suppose, that upon the planting every new colony by the subjects of Eng∣land, new courts must spring up, as it were from the roots of the ancient courts, and be established without the consent of the legislature; because we can imitate their methods of proceeding, though we are very imperfect in comparison to their reason and Judgment.—Then I think there is another impropriety in the debate of this question: they would ar∣gue from the power and prerogative of the king, to entitle a governor to act in the same manner. I think, before they turn a governor into a king, they should take care, to pro∣vide for him the same sufficiency of wisdom and as able a council: therefore I must suppose, a mighty difference be∣tween the power of a king and the governors abroad.—Their instructions, as to the erecting of courts, or the au∣thorities granted in their patents for that purpose, are not now, as they were in the beginning, when there were no courts: but proper judicatures being long since established, there is an end of their power in that respect; and if any alteration is found necessary, it must certainly be done by the consent of the legislature. The kings of England have always, so far as I am acquainted with the history of the plantations, used a particular tenderness in the business of erecting their courts of judicature, by directing their go∣vernors, to take the advice of the general assemblies in that matter, and I dare say, that if the patents and instructions of the governor of New-York were to be inspected, no suffi∣cient warrant will be found in them, to exercise this high power of setting up new courts. But be that as it will, this is most manifest, that setting up one or more men, with power to judge men's properties, by other rules than those of the common law, by which alone we of the plantations must be governed, must subject the estates of that people to an arbitrary rule, so far as they are restrained from appeal∣ing to an higher jurisdiction, and may enslave them to the weak, if not corrupt, judgments of those men.—It really seems to be a singular misfortune to the people of New-York, that a question of this nature should be so far coun∣tenanced, as to become a subject of argument, when, I be∣lieve, in any other colony, it would not have been thought a matter of any doubt or the least difficulty. But above all, it is most extravagant, that a court of equity should be erected, for the trial of a cause, of which, without doing violence to its nature, it cannot have any jurisdiction: and I have wondered, in so warm a debate, that this point has been passed over.—I think nothing could entitle the court of equi∣ty, to proceed in the cause between the governor and Van Dam, unless there was a want of proof, of Van Dam's re∣ceiving the money in dispute, which I suppose is impossible, since it must have issued out of the public treasury of the province.—If I had been to have argued this point, I should have taken a very different method from those gentlemen. Instead of taking so much pains, in running through so many book cases, to settle what the constitution of England is, I would have stated the constitution of this particular government, as it is grounded either upon treaties or grants from the crown of England; for as New-York was a con∣quered country, it is very probable, something may have been stipulated, between the states general and crown of England, in behalf of the subjects of Holland, which were left there in possession of their estates, and so became sub∣jects to England.—If there was any such treaty, that must be looked upon as the fundamental law of the province; and next to that, the king's charters must take place.—I do not at all doubt, but some way or other, the common law was established there, and if not, as there is a legislature, I sup∣pose it is adopted by the country; for there is undoubtedly, a great difference between the people of a conquered coun∣try, and colonies established by the king's consent by the subjects of England. The common law follows them where∣ever they go; but as to the other, it must arise either from treaties or grants; therefore it is a pity, every thing in re∣lation to this matter has been omitted, which would have been of great use to those, who are unacquainted with the facts, in forming a judgment in this case.—I cannot forbear observing a mighty weakness in the lawyers of New-York, in blindly following a common error, in relation to the statutes of England being in force there; whereas there is no foundation in sense or reason for such an opinion. The common law must be the only rule; and if we wade into the statutes, no man can tell what the law is. It is certain, all of them cannot bind, and to know which do, was al∣ways above my capacity.—Those, that are declarative of the common law, serve us rather as evidences, than by any binding quality, as statutes.</P>

The judges of this court, according to an act of assembly, are judges of <HI>Nisi Prius</HI> of course; and, agreeable to an or∣dinance of the governor and council, perform a circuit
<PB N="270" REF="024800_0265_0FCD647F452B4DA0"/>through the counties once every year. They carry with them, at the same time, a commission of oyer and terminer
<PB N="271" REF="024800_0266_0FCD64804DE626B8"/>and general jail delivery, in which some of the county jus∣tices are joined.</P>
<P>The judges and practisers in the supreme, and all other courts, wear no peculiar habits as they do at Westminster-Hall, and in some of the West-India islands; nor is there, as yet, any distinction or degrees among the lawyers.</P>
<P>The door of admission into the practice is too open. The usual preparatories are a college or university education, and three years apprenticeship, or, without the former, seven years service under an attorney. In either of these cases, the chief justice recommends the candidate to the governor, who thereupon grants a license to practice under his hand and seal at arms. This being produced to the court, the usual state oaths and subscription are taken, together with an oath for his upright demeanor, and he is then qua∣lified to practice in every court in the province. Into the county courts, attornies are introduced with still less cere∣mony. For our governors have formerly licensed all persons, how indifferently soever recommended; and the profession has been shamefully disgraced, by the admission of men not only of the meanest abilities, but of the lowest employ∣ments.

<HEAD>THE COURT OF CHANCERY.</HEAD>
<P>OF all our courts, none has been more obnoxious to the people than this. There have been (as I have already shown) few administrations since its first erection, in which our assemblies have not expressed their disapprobation of its constitution by ordinance, and the exercise of the chan∣cellor's power by the governor. During the administration of governor Cosby, a bill was filed by sir Joseph Eyles and others, to vacate the oblong patent granted by his imme∣diate predecessor to Hauley and company. The defendants excepted to the governor's jurisdiction; but being over∣ruled, they resorted to the assembly with a complaint, and the house, on the 6th of November 1735, resolved,</P>
<P>"That a court of chancery in this province, in the hands or under the exercise of a governor, without consent in general assembly, is contrary to law, unwarrantable, and of dangerous consequence to the liberties and properties of the people."</P>
<P>The same sentiments obtained among the people in mr. Clarke's time, as is very evident in the memorable address of the assembly, in 1737, a part of which, relative to the court of chancery, is too singular to be suppressed.</P>
<P>"The settling and establishing of courts of general juris∣diction, for the due administration of justice, is necessary in every country: and we conceive they ought to be settled and established, by the acts of the whole legislature, and their several jurisdictions and powers by that authority limited and appointed, especially courts that are to take cognizance of matters in a course of equity.—This has been the constant practice in England, when new courts were to be erected, or old ones to be abolished or altered: and the several kings of England, in whose reigns those acts were made, never conceived, that the settling, erecting, or abo∣lishing courts, by acts of the legislature, had any tendency to destroy or in the least to diminish their just and legal pre∣rogatives.
<PB N="275" REF="024800_0270_0FCD64878BEDECB0"/>—It was the method in use here, both before and since the revolution, and particularly recommended to the assembly to be done in that manner, by a message from go∣vernor Sloughter and council, on the 15th day of April 1691. He was the first governor since the revolution; and the governors that since that time assented to those acts, we suppose, never in the least imagined, they were giving up the prerogative of their masters, when they gave that assent; nor did we ever learn, that they were censured for doing so.—On the contrary, the constant instructions, that have from time to time been given to the governors of this pro∣vince, seem clearly to point out the doing of it, by acts of the legislature, and not otherwise, as may be gathered from the instruction, for the erecting of a court for the determin∣ing of small causes, by which there are positive directions given to the governors, to recommend it to the assembly, that a law should be passed for that purpose; but notwith∣standing these directions, given in direct and express terms, the governors never would apply for such an act, but erected that court by an ordinance of themselves and council, as they did the court of chancery, which had before that time been erected by acts of the legislature in another manner.—They could not be ignorant, what dissatisfaction the erecting of a court of chancery in that manner, gave the generality of the people.—This was very manifest, by the resolves of the general assembly, at the time of its first being so erected, and often since, declaring the illegality of such a proceed∣ing. And though these resolves have been as often as made, treated by the governors with an unreasonable disregard and contempt of them, yet to men of prudence, they might have been effectual, to have made them decline persisting in a procedure, so illegal and so generally dissatisfactory; and which (as they managed it) proved of no use to the pub∣lic or benefit to themselves. For as few of them had talents equal to the task of a chancellor, which they had under∣taken to perform, so it was executed accordingly. Some of them being willing to hold such a court, others not, accord∣ing as they happened to be influenced by those about them. So that were it really established in the most legal manner (as it was not) yet being in the hands of a person not com∣pellable to do his duty, it was so managed, that the extra∣ordinary delays and fruitless expense attending it, ren∣dered it not only useless, but a grievance to the inhabitants, especially those, who were so unfortunate as to be concern∣ed in it: which we hope you think with us, that it is high time should be redressed.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="024800_0271_0FCD64888F74AA40"/>
"Your honour well knows, that the establishing that court, in the manner it has been done, has been a subject of contention, between the governors and the assembly; and since it is confessed by all, that the establishing both of that, and other courts, by act of the legislature, is indispu∣tably legal, and gives them the most uncontrovertible au∣thority; and if unquestionably legal, what is so, cannot be destructive of his majesty's prerogative.—We therefore hope, you will make no scruple of assenting to this bill, to put an end to a contention, that has not been, nor will be, while it continues, beneficial to his majesty's service."—</P>
<P>From this time, the chancery has been unattacked by the assembly, but the business transacted in it is very incon∣siderable. A court of equity is absolutely necessary, for the due administration of justice; but whether private proper∣ty ought to be in the hands of the governors, I leave others to determine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some are of opinion, that the governor's jurisdiction in this, and the spiritual, or prerogative court, are incom∣patible.</NOTE>. As the public business of the colony increa∣ses, few of them, I believe, will be ambitious of the chan∣cellor's office, as they have not the assistance of a master of the rolls. The present officers of this court (which is al∣ways held in the council chamber at the fort) are, his ex∣cellency sir Charles Hardy, knt. chancellor, two masters, two clerks, one examiner, a register, and a serjeant at arms, and not one of them has a salary. In our proceedings, we copy after the chancery in England; and indeed in all our courts, the practice at home is more nearly imitated in this and New Jersey, than in any other province upon the con∣tinent. Few of our assemblies have been capable to concert any new regulations of this kind: and hence the lawyers have had recourse to the English customs and forms, which they have generally adopted. While the New England colo∣nies, through the superior education of their representatives, have introduced numberless innovations, peculiar to them∣selves; the laws of our mother country have gradually ob∣tained here, and in this respect, the public has perhaps receiv∣ed advantages, even from the ignorance of our ancestors.</P>
