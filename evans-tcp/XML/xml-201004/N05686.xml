<P>WITH what an anxious and close Attention do Men hearken to those, who are relating, tho' re∣lating in ever so poor a Mannor, what con∣cerns their <HI>Interest?</HI> And how greedily do Men read, and how tenaciously do they re∣member what they have rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when the Matter deeply concerns them!</P>
<P>Now, seeing all Men are liable to Pain, Misery, and Death; to the Loss of Reputa∣tion, Credit, Estate, Friends, and every Thing that is dear and valuable in Life; to the ungodly Usurpation, Tyranny, and Op∣pression of their Fellow Creatures: What sort of Principles therefore, must those be actuated by, who can afflict <HI>willingly,</HI> and greviously torment the Children of Men!
<PB N="4" REF="007215_0003_102B3E39D629E788"/>How just is the Damnation of <HI>JUDAS,</HI> who for a little MONEY, betray'd Innocent Blood?</P>

And Men are so united and dependant upon one another in Society, and especially in Trade, that one Individual cannot suffer, but some others must suffer with him. This is the Case more especially with Regard to the Mer∣chants and Traders, who are every Moment liable to Misfortunes. The Hope of Gain induces Traders in general, to hazard much, and to enterprize too deeply; but if they <HI>su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d,</HI> they are on Account of their Success, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> applauded and caressed.

Success therefore (so wise we are) seems to
<PB N="5" REF="007215_0004_102B3E9594E30BC0"/>be the established Criterion to judge Men's Conduct and Characters by—<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Race <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to the Swift, nor the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> to the Strong, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Bread to the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderstanding;</HI> and therefore to <HI>judge</HI> a Man's Principles or Conduct, to be G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d or Bad, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neerly from his Success and Prosperity, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Misfortunes and Adversity, is a very weak (if not a malicious) Conclusion and Judgment.</P>
<P>But as my Design, at present, is to expose the Ill-Policy and Inhumanity of <HI>Im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning</HI> Insolvent DEBTORS, I must beg the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ader's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>est Attention to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llowing Things.</P>
<P>And in the first Place. We will consider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Case in a Political View: And then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econdly in a Moral Light.</P>
<P>Now <HI>first,</HI> in a Political Point of View, the Question is, 'Whether, when a Man's Cir∣cumstances are such, that his whole Estate will not pay his just Debts, it is best for So∣ciety, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive a Propor∣tion of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, according to their se∣veral just Demands, and his Person be sat at Liberty to seek new Employment; or that his <HI>Body</HI> be imprisoned for the Defici∣ency, until he pay the utmost Farthing, which is impossible?'</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007215_0005_102B3E3B9593ED00"/>
Now, in fairly discussing this Question, let it be well considered, That the wise End of all Laws, is the Good of the So∣ciety for which such Laws are made. Is it not best therefore, that each Member in So∣ciety, should be employed in some useful Occupation, which Nature points him out the most fit, and best qualified for? But Na∣ture has pointed out no honest Man for a Prison: Then consequently, those must be bad Laws, which authorize the Imprisoning any Man for Debt, who does honestly give up to his Creditors all that he hath in the World. Let any justly pretending to Ra∣tionality, say, to what good End, a Debtor is shut up in a Prison, after he is stripped of all his Goods. Can his Creditors, with all their Wisdom, have more than All? Will his Imprisonment increase his Estate? Will his Confinement pay or diminish his Debts<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or the Punishment of his Body be any Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Advantage to them, or to Society▪ I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, then we beg Leave to <HI>quere,</HI> Whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Legislators</HI> are acting in the Character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wise and good Rulers, when by Law, they impower Creditors to take their unfortunate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Neighbours and Debtors by the Throat, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cast them into Prison, and permit them to
<PB N="7" REF="007215_0006_102B3E3D9D1027B0"/>keep their Debtors there forever? By this inhuman Treatment, an unfortunate Debtor, whilst in Prison, is rendered utterly Useless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Society, a Burthen to himself, a Charge to his Creditors, a Lamentation to his dear Wife and Children, who are rendered com∣pleatly miserable—and all this, because he will not pay them, what GOD in his Provi∣dence, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s deprived him of—After a Man has laboured ten, twenty, or thirty Years, for a Livelihood, would it not, think ye, be Misery, great Misery indeed, to have All he had in Possession, snatched away from him at once? But must the Infamy of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail be added to his other Misfortunes, and by those too, who are, in the Nature of Things, liable to the like Vicissitudes and Changes in Life!</P>
<P>On the most candid and cool Reflections, a Conduct like this, we are of Opinion, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot be found Reasonable in itself, or Benefi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial to Society. For if it is best for Society, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Trade and Commerce, Agriculture, Navigation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be encouraged and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncreased by all reasonable and probable Means, and which are carried on by the Work and Labour of the PEOPLE; then the <HI>Labour of the People,</HI> without which all Bu∣siness
<PB N="8" REF="007215_0007_102B3E409DC3ACB8"/>stagnates, is the true Riches of the Community; the more People, the more Riches: And such Laws therefore, which protect and encourage Trade, Industry, and Equity, are the best Laws for <HI>Trading Societies.</HI> And can any say, That Manu∣factures are more encouraged, Lands better improved, Trade and Business negotiated. Navigation and Commerce carried on with more Dispatch and Safety, in those Societies or Communities where the <HI>Creditor</HI> has such Power over the <HI>Body</HI> of the Debtor, as to cast him into Prison forever? Or, in such Communities or Governments, where the Laws free and protect the <HI>Person</HI> of the Debtor, after he has honestly given up All he has in the World to his Creditor? We appeal to <HI>LONDON, Holland, &amp;c.</HI> where the Debtor is at Liberty, upon his paying All that he hath, and then goes to Work again with Spirit, upon the Foundation of HOPE. And therefore we conclude, and we think the Conclusion just, as grounded upon long Experience, That it is best for Society, that a Law of Liberty for <HI>Insolvent</HI> DEBTORS, should be Established in all Trading Communities.</P>
<P>Again: If we soundly reflect, that Man∣kind
<PB N="9" REF="007215_0008_102B3E429BA7A6A0"/>are often unstable as Water, and Way∣ward as the Wind; that they are too, too often hurried on by their Lusts and Passions, to wicked and unjust Actions; we shall then the more clearly see the Reasonableness and Wisdom of those LAWS of <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Ju∣stice,</HI> which <HI>require</HI> an equal Distribution of a Debtor's Goods and Effects amongst all his Creditors, in Proportion to their just De∣mands: For if by Fire, Storm, Cheats, <HI>or the Tongue s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on Fire of Hell,</HI> a Man in Trade and Business, who is both a Debtor and a Creditor, and is therefore liable every Mo∣ment to Accidents, unforeseen Casualties, and Contingencies; the Moment any re∣markable unfortunate Stroke befals him, away comes his greedy voracious Creditors, who like <HI>Men of Prey,</HI> glut themselves im∣mediately, not in the least caring who sinks or swims, starves or perishes: Whereas the compassionate benevolent Creditor, who is very sorry at his Neighbour's Losses and Misfortunes, and therefore cannot of himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dd more Affliction to him, by immediately falling upon him to devour him quite: The moderate, merciful Creditor, is therefore, as it were, fore-stalled, trick'd, and almost robbed of his Right by such hasty snap Dragons, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you will find always oppose Laws of Mercy Equity, and just Distribution of a Debt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Effects; wherefore it is, that in such Cases the unmerciful Creditor gets All, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compassionate Creditor often loses All.</P>
<P>Now, if this is the real State of the Case as we dare affirm it is, Is it not therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expedient, as well as just, wise, and reason∣able, that, on Account of the unfortunate Debtor, who has no Place of Shelter, or Pro∣tection from such hungry Mortals); and all on Account of <HI>all his Creditors,</HI> to have suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Laws of Equity and Distribution made as established, that equal Justice might alway be done to every Individual justly concerne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is not in the Power of the unfortunate Debtor to effect; and because, instead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Laws of Protection and Equity in this Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there are among us, only Laws which pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mit Destruction and Haveck.</P>
<P>We are of Opinion therefore, that greatly behoves the Wisdom of the Legisla∣tors, to enact and establish a <HI>Law of Liberty and Equity,</HI> for <HI>Insolvent Debtors.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, if we realize and consider, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Fear of Man bringeth a Snare</HI>—we shall be still farther convinced of the Reasonable∣ness,
<PB N="11" REF="007215_0010_102B3E476AA22388"/> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Necessity</HI> of making such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>utary, such a whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om LAW, as we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een so earnestly contending for.</P>
<P>Trade, we know, is supported by Credit; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Credit is to Trade, what the Blood is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Body; If Credit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ails, Trade stagnates; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Blood don't circulate, the Body die. The Circulation in Trade is kept up, by Men's duly performing their Contracts, Agreements, and Promises; But when a Man in Trade breaks his Agreements, Con∣tracts, and Promises, so that there can be no well grounded Dependance upon him, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon discovered, bunted down, undone, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erhaps cast into Prison: Punctuality is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Trade.</P>
<P>Now in order to avoid sudden Calamity, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wounded Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>siaan,</HI> on whom the Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Fear</HI> hath fallen, is led into Temptation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o hire Money of <HI>Usarers</HI> and Sharpers, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to Men in Necessity for Money, what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ultures are to their Prey. These <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surers</HI> must have foursold Security, and exhorbitant interest, even as much as a <HI>Thief</HI> must pay, when he is catched, which is Foursold. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hocking Refuge he flies to, in order to be punctual: And when his Refuge falls, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls to selling his Goods to Money
<PB N="12" REF="007215_0011_102B3E4935C1B800"/>Customers for 10 or 20 <HI>per Cent. Loss</HI> upon the First Cost. How in such a Case, doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Stock diminish, and his Burthen of De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> increase! which in the Language of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Dunciad,</HI> is,
<Q>Downward to climb, and backward to advance.</Q></P>
<P>But this is not all; for in so doing, he n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> only wounds his Conscience, but actually cheats his Creditors. And in Case he dies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the midst of his bad Circumstances, his Estate is justly represented Insolvent, and perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will not pay Two Shillings and Six Pence for Twenty Shillings: <HI>Thus the Fear of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> bringeth a Snare.</HI></P>
<P>Again: But in Case an <HI>honest Debtor</HI> could be <HI>protected</HI> by a LAW of Equity and Liberty, so soon as he found his Business fail, and by Losses and Disappointments, his Estate would not pay above Eighteen, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fifteen Shillings in Twenty, he would, if an honest Man, make known his Circumstances, compound and settle with his Creditors, free himself from Perplexity, Doubt, Shuffling. Evasion, and the like; and thus begin the World again with fresh Courage, home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt Experience, which is the soundest Wisdom, and soon find fresh Credit; and by Industry and Frugality, grow up in the World, a
<PB N="13" REF="007215_0012_102B3E4ACA642FD0"/>second Edition as it were, corrected of a va∣luable Book. And whereas the best, and greatest Men in the World, from Age to Age, have been bred up in, and come from the School of AFFLICTION,; all his former Pangs, Agonies, and Fears, would be turned into Gratitude, Thankfulness, Circumspec∣tion, and Watchfulness, and upon the whole, prove a much wiser and better Man, and a more useful Member in Society; for his Example would be of great Advantage to all around him.</P>
<P>Now as such good Consequences would naturally result from the above mentioned salutary Law, we leave it to the wise and thinking Part of Mankind, to say, what Sort of Men those are, who directly oppose such a <HI>Benevolent Method</HI> of accomodating Difficulties amongst Mankind, so <HI>dependant upon one another in Society.</HI></P>
<P>As the Sun is to the Day after a Tempest; or Health to the Body after Sickness; or what a Bridgroom feels coming out of his Chamber, that, LIBERTY is to a broken Trader.</P>
<P>But before we conclude this Head, we beg Leave to answer a few OBJECTIONS. For some Men are so sond of Objections, that
<PB N="14" REF="007215_0013_102B3E4DDFF8D080"/>they dislike every Thing but themselves; who indeed are an <HI>Objection</HI> to all Mercy, Peace, and Benevolence.</P>
<P>The first Objection we shall mention is, <Q>That no Man ought to agree to any Thing that is not in his Power to perform, and therefore ought to pay according to his Agreement.</Q></P>
<P>In Answer to this Objection, we must ob∣serve, That in Strictness of Speech, this is impossible, because no Man has Power over Accidents, Casualties, and Contingencies, but is liable to them all, and even this Night his Soul may be required of him, and there∣fore whatever <HI>is future,</HI> he has not absolute Power over, not even of himself, but is a dependent relative Being, <HI>whose Breath is in his Nostrils, and whose Life is a Span;</HI> and therefore all Promises and Agreements are in their Nature uncertain, casual, and con∣ditional; and when the Power of perform∣ing is wanting, the <HI>Intention</HI> is accepted: So that in some special Cases, a Man may break his Promise and Contract, and yet be an <HI>honest Man.</HI></P>
<P>But he that makes a Promise with a <HI>De∣sign</HI> to break it, or with no Resolution of performing it, cannot be so: And he that
<PB N="15" REF="007215_0014_102B3E500511DA00"/>makes a Promise, and does not positively do his Endeavour to the utmost of his Power to perform it <HI>(if it is just)</HI> cannot be an honest Man; for a Promise once made, supposes the <HI>Promiser</HI> willing to be as good as his Word, and it has a binding <HI>Influence</HI> upon him who made the Promise, so far as his Power of performing extends; but if it is not in his Power to perform it, as in the Affair of Payment of <HI>Money,</HI> is often the Case, the Man cannot be condemned as a dishonest Man: For the Performance of <HI>his</HI> Promise might depend on the Promises of <HI>Others</HI> to him, on the customary Run of the Trade and Business he is engaged in, and on many other contingent Circumstances, and all might possibly fail him, tho' ever so ho∣nest a Man himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Objection</HI> therefore, especially with Regard to Traders, is unreasonable, and of no Force against the above mentioned Law.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> Another <HI>Objection</HI> is, 'That such a LAW (as the above mentioned) would encourage Debtors to be careless, extravagant, and dishonest.'</P>
<P>To this Objection we reply, That no Hu∣man Laws can make all Men Good and Wife. Amongst the <HI>Clergy,</HI> some are not sit
<PB N="16" REF="007215_0015_102B3E51F143F428"/>for their Holy Function. Amongst the Phy∣sicians, some are Quacks, and of no Value. Amongst Counsello<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, some are of a Repro∣bate Mind. Shall we therefore be so <HI>politi∣cally Wise,</HI> as to have no Counsellors, no Physicians, nor Clergymen? And because some Traders prove Knaves and Rogues, must all Traders be liable to be treated as such?</P>
<P>Men accustom'd to do Evil, habituated to Wickedness and Villainy, ought to be duly punished. But a Man's Misfortunes does not prove him a Rogue. Nor is Weakness, In∣advertency, or Imprudence, which all Men have more or less of, a Proof of Fraud, Dis∣honesty, or Extravagancy; for Men are too often valued, not according to the Integrity of their Hearts, the Cleanness of their Hands, the Wisdom of their Heads; but only ac∣cording to the supposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of their Purses. And we too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Men good or bad Names, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>greeable to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we get or what we lose by them, not consi∣dering the <HI>Principles</HI> they may have acted from, or the general Tenor of their former Conduct. Such Treatment of Mankin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, loudly speaks for itself.</P>
<P>How many prodigious sturdy <HI>Oaks,</HI> have

<P>First; as to <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>el:</HI> When the Prophet told him what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Things he should be guilty of he was ast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nished even at the mentioning them, and cried out, <HI>Is thy Ser∣vant a Dog, that he should be guilty of so great Evil</HI>—But so soon as he had the Opportu∣nity (pardon the Expression) <HI>the Dog</HI> perpe∣trated the Crimes so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with unbounded Lust and Cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> like an An∣gel, but reigned like a Devil.</P>

<P>Moreover, the very Terms of the Objec∣tion answer themselves: For, if it be un∣reasonable in Creditors to act such an inhu∣man Part towards their Debtors, when in the above-mentioned Situation, then conse∣quently it must be unreasonable in Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sla∣tors, to establish that by a Law, which the very Objectors themselves, in this Case, al∣low to be just and right.</P>
<P>But now for Governments to <HI>presame,</HI> that every Creditor will be just and merciful, without any Laws obliging him, is pre∣suming too much, and daily Experience is a flat Contradiction to the Objection. And won't it be a very weak and pitiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for those, whose Duty obliges, and whose Wisdom and Power authorize them, to pro∣vide all necessary Laws for the Good of So∣ciety, to say, They <HI>thought</HI> Mankind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have acted right, without any Laws▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that this Mountain has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ouse.</P>

<P>And here in Allusion to a great Author, we would say, <Q>What shame to Men, who of all Rational Creatures only disagree, tho' they are under H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe of Heavenly Grace, and God proclaims Peace and good Will; yet they live in Hatred, Strife, and Envy among themselves, levying civil Wars, and wasting the Earth, to destroy each other, as if (which <HI>Consideration</HI> of itself might induce us to Amity, Unity, and Brotherly Love) Man had not <HI>hellish</HI> Foes enough besides, that Day and Night wait for his Distruction—As if we were born into the World meerly to <HI>hate,</HI> and not to love another!</Q></P>

<PB N="30" REF="007215_0029_102B3E6F8DF159E8"/>they should do unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> there was but one Way for a Man to obtain P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son for a certain Crime be had committed, and that was by running a Race, which he was ca∣pable of performing; but immediately his Legs are fast bound, his Hands t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed behind his Back, and then he is whistled to, stroak'd, and bid to run; again clapped upon the Back, and bid to run: But it is impossible for him <HI>now</HI> to run, and therefore impossible for him to perform the Condition of Pardon. Can any Man say, he should like to be treated with such Derision and Mockery, such <HI>Insult</HI> and <HI>Inhumanity?</HI> Is this doing as you would be done unto? And might not an <HI>impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oned Insolvent</HI> reply to his inhuman Creditor, as <HI>Nathan</HI> did to <HI>David; Thou art the Man!</HI></P>
<P>Again: What Son of Violence has Front enough to say, he should very well like to be cast into Prison forever? made compleatly miserable; his Family poor, despis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, naked, wretched, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, his Wise!—worse, far worse than a Widow—and his Children in a most deplorable <HI>Situation:</HI> All this, because he had been guilty of no Capital Crime, un∣less the Sin of being unfortunate, is a Capi∣tal
<PB N="31" REF="007215_0030_102B3E7185FBE7F8"/>Sin. This speaks for itself—And as no Man can approve such Treatment with Re∣gard to himself, so he ought not to be guilty of it towards others, which fully demon∣strates the Inhumanity of Imprisoning In∣solvent Debtors. And seeing we have no Law to prevent such barbarous Usage, Is it not highly reasonable, wise, and fit, we should have such a Law.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>To deprive an honest Man of Li∣berty, and the Power of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling, is Inhuman and Unreasonable.</HI></P>
<P>Liberty is dear to Man. Life without Liberty, is a Kind of dying daily. Man is born free, and born for Action, and to La∣bour, and has a natural Right to Himself, his Labour, and to the Air, the Earth, and the Seas; and his Fellow Creatures have not, in a State of <HI>Nature,</HI> any Right to in∣terrupt him in the free Enjoyment of what his Great Creator has bountifully bestowed upon, or granted to him.</P>
<P>But Man in Society, voluntarily gives up Part of his <HI>natural</HI> Liberty, in order to be governed by such Laws as are best adapted to promote the Peace and Prosperity of So∣ciety—But then he has an equal Right to
<PB N="32" REF="007215_0031_102B3E73476013A8"/>as much Liberty as the Laws grant to the other Members in the same Community. But under the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, and un∣der the Light of the glorious Gospel, is it right and fit to take away a Man's Liberty, his Labour, yea, his <HI>Liberty</HI> of Air, and shut him up in a Prison, because he has lost <HI>his Money,</HI> and cannot pay what he oweth; and this by Means out of his Power to pre∣vent?</P>
<P>Again: Is it right and sit, that Christian Communities should make Laws in <HI>direct Opposition</HI> to the Laws of GOD?</P>
<P>By the meer Providence of GOD, an he∣nest Man is suddenly deprived of all his <HI>Worldly Substance,</HI> which immediately de∣mands our sincere Pity and Commiseration and <HI>Assistance;</HI> because we are under the same Law of Nature, and therefore certainly liable to the same Effects and Consequences from the same <HI>Causes.</HI></P>
<P>But by a Law in the Community where the unhappy Man suffered under Misfortunes, it is there lawful to cast him into Prison for∣ever—for Debt only—This loose, <HI>indiscri∣minating</HI> Law, is left open, because wicked Men, by wicked Deeds, sometimes cheat
<PB N="33" REF="007215_0032_102B3E75CC13CC00"/>their <HI>Creditors,</HI> who justly, for so doing, cast them into Prison: Therefore all Men, the best Men <HI>(is this right!)</HI> who owe Money, tho' the meer Providence of God, by some remarkable Accident, has put it out of their Power to pay; yet, if their Creditors please, <HI>he shall likewise</HI> be cast into Prison—Is not this therefore, <HI>doing Evil, that Good may come of it?</HI> And is not this acting in direct Opposition to the Command of God? Is it not highly reasonable, therefore, to have some <HI>Medium,</HI> to adjust the Difference be∣twixt the <HI>Debtor</HI> and the Creditor?</P>
<P>With what sacred Rage! with what Vehemence, Indignation, and <HI>Pathos,</HI> did the Man after GOD's own Heart, call for dire <HI>Vengeance</HI> on such—<HI>For they persecute him, whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the Grief of those, whom thou hast wound∣ed,</HI> Psa. 69.</P>
<P>To <HI>afflict</HI> the <HI>Afflicted,</HI> to take away a Man's <HI>natural</HI> and his <HI>civil</HI> Liberty, and de∣prive him of the Power of acting, and im∣proving his Time, and his Talents, for the Good of himself and his Family, for the Benefit of the Community; in doing which, he so far glorifies GOD his Maker, to
<PB N="34" REF="007215_0033_102B3E78427C6210"/>deprive an honest Unfortunate, of the <HI>necessary Advantages, is, as it were,</HI> to <HI>mur∣der</HI> a Man after he is dead, and therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>unreasonable</HI> and inhuman.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>it is absolutely necessary, for the Good of the Community, to have a Law of Equity established, which should judge between the Creditor and the Debtor,</HI> in <HI>Cases extream.</HI> Because the Tempers and Passions of Cre∣ditors may hurry them on to do such bar∣barous Actions to their Debtors, when unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>their</HI> Power, and under Colour of the Law too, that may ruin a valuable Man, his Family, and deprive Society of a useful Member; and all out of meer Humour, Will, Resentment, Spite, or Malice. It is <HI>Godlike,</HI> to prevent such inhuman, such unreasonable Power.</P>
<P>But Thirdly and Lastly. <HI>The Imprisoning honest Insolvents, is Inhuman in itself, and con∣sequently in despite of the Christian Religion, which is the only Religion we profess to be∣lieve.</HI></P>
<P>Every Thing that is comprehended and implied in the <HI>Words,</HI> Goodness, Love, Peace, Mercy, Truth, and Charity, is in the most earnest Manner recommended and
<PB N="35" REF="007215_0034_102B3E7A3660AF50"/>inculcated in the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and en∣forced by the Godlike Example of its glo∣rious Author, <HI>His own Example</HI> was more <HI>Forcable</HI> than all the <HI>Arguments</HI> in a whole World full of Books—And those that love him will keep his Commandments; but those who will neither believe <HI>Moses,</HI> nor the <HI>Prophets,</HI> nor JESUS CHRIST himself (in whose Words we finish what we have at <HI>present</HI> to say on this Subject) all such we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave in the Hands of HIM who will ren∣der to every One according to their Deeds.</P>
<Q><P>Then came <HI>Peter</HI> to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my Brother sin against me, and I forgive? till seven Times?</P>
<P>JESUS saith unto him, I say not unto thee, until seven Times, but until Twenty Times Seven. Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King, which would take an Account of his Ser∣vants; and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him <HI>Ten Thousand Talents:</HI> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be sold, and his Wise and Child∣ren, and all that he had, and Payment to be made.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="007215_0035_102B3E7BC85C7508"/>
The Servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have Pa∣tience with me, and I will pay thee All. Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with <HI>Compassion,</HI> and loosed him, and <HI>for∣gave</HI> him the Debt.</P>
<P>But the same Servant went out and found one of his Fellow Servant which owed him <HI>an Hundred Pence,</HI> and he laid Hands on him, and took him by the <HI>Throat,</HI> saying, Pay me that thou owest And his Fellow Servant fell down at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Feet, and besought him, saying, Have <HI>Patience</HI> with me, and I will pay the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> All; and he would not, but went an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cast him into <HI>Prison</HI> till he should pay the Debt.</P>
<P>So when his Fellow Servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their Lord all that was done.</P>
<P>Then the Lord, after that he had cal∣led him, said unto <HI>him, O thou wicked Ser∣vant,</HI> I forgave thee all <HI>that</HI> Debt, because thou desiredst me, shouldst not thou also have had <HI>Compassion</HI> on thy <HI>Fellow Servant</HI> even as I had Pity on thee?</P>
<P>And his Lord was wroth, and delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="37" REF="007215_0036_102B3E7ED0418B78"/>him to the Tormentors, till he should pay All that was due unto him.</P>
<P>So <HI>likewise</HI> shall my Heavenly FATHER do also unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive <HI>not</HI> every one his Brother their <HI>Trespasses.</HI>—Thus spake JESUS the Son of GOD, who spake as never Man spake— Who is stiled the Wisdom of GOD, and the Power of GOD. <BIBL>See <HI>Matt.</HI> Gosp. Chap. 18.</BIBL></P></Q>
