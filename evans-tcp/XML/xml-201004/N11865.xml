<HEAD>The <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of <HI>PENNSYLVANIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS all government ought to be insti∣tuted and supported for the security and pro∣tection of the community as such, and to enable the in∣dividuals who compose it to enjoy their natural rights and the other blessings which the author of existence has bestowed upon man; and whenever these great ends of government are not obtained, the people have a right, by common consent, to change it, and take such measures as to them may appear necessary to promote their safety and happiness. <HI>AND WHEREAS</HI> the inhabitants of this Common-Wealth have, in consideration of protection only, heretofore acknowledged allegiance to the King of Great-Britain, and the said King has not only with∣drawn that protection, but commenced and still conti∣nues to carry on, with unabated vengeance, a most cruel and unjust war against them, employing therein not only the troops of Great Britain, but foreign mercenaries, savages and slaves, for the avowed purpose of reducing them to a total and abject submission to the despotic do∣mination of the British Parliament, with many other acts of tyranny, (more fully set forth in the Declaration of Congress) whereby all allegiance and fealty to the said King and his successors are dissolved and at an end, and all power and authority derived from him ceased in these Colonies. <HI>AND WHEREAS</HI> it is absolutely neces∣sary for the welfare and safety of the inhabitants of said Colonies, that they be henceforth free and independent
<PB N="4" REF="014979_0003_0F973FEAB2B892C8"/>
States, and that just, permanent and proper forms of government exist in every part of them, derived from, and founded on the authority of, the people only, agree∣able to the directions of the Honorable American Con∣gress. WE, the Representatives of the Freemen of Pennsylvania in General Convention met, for the ex∣press purpose of framing such a government, confessing the goodness of the great Governor of the Universe (who alone knows to what degree of earthly happiness man∣kind may attain by perfecting the arts of government) in permitting the people of this State, by common consent, and without violence, deliberately to form for themselves such just rules as they shall think best, for governing their future society; and being fully convinced that it is our indispensable duty to establish such original principles of government as will best promote the general happiness of the people of this State and their posterity, and provide for future improvements, without partiality for or pre∣judice against any particular class, sect or denomination of men whatever, DO, by virtue of the authority vested in us by our constituents, ordain, declare and establish the following <HI>Declaration of Rights</HI> and <HI>Frame of Go∣vernment</HI> to be <HI>THE CONSTITUTION</HI> of this Common-Wealth, and to remain in force therein forever, unaltered, except in such articles as shall here∣after on experience be found to require improvement, and which shall by the same authority of the people, fairly delegated as this Frame of Government directs, be amended or improved for the more effectual obtaining and securing <HI>THE GREAT END AND DE∣SIGN OF ALL GOVERNMENT,</HI> herein before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> A <HI>DECLARATION</HI> of the <HI>RIGHTS</HI> of the <HI>INHABITANTS</HI> of the State of <HI>PENNSYLVANIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable Rights, amongst which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty, ac∣quiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences and understanding: And that no man ought or of right can be com∣pelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any Mi∣nistry, contrary to, or against, his own free will and consent: Nor can any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his re∣ligious sentiments or peculiar mode of religious
<PB N="6" REF="014979_0005_0F973FEC34FC8F58"/>
worship: And that no authority can or ought to be vested in, or assumed by, any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner controul, the right of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship.</P>
<P N="3">III. THAT the people of this State have the sole exclusive and inherent right of governing and re∣gulating the internal police of the same.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THAT all power being originally inherent in, and consequently derived from, the people; there∣fore all officers of government, whether legislative or executive, are their trustees and servants, and at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="5">V. THAT government is, or ought to be, insti∣tuted for the common benefit, protection and secu∣rity of the people, nation or community; and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any single man, family or set of men who are a part only of that community: And that the community hath an indubitable, unalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government in such man∣ner as shall be by that community judged most con∣ducive to the public weal.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That those who are employed in the legis∣lative and executive business of the State may be
<PB N="7" REF="014979_0006_0F973FED86CF3D88"/>
restrained from oppression, the people have a right, at such periods as they may think proper, to reduce their public officers to a private station, and supply the vacancies by certain and regular elections.</P>
<P N="7">VII. THAT all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having a sufficient evident com∣mon interest with, and attachment to the commu∣nity, have a right to elect officers, or be elected into office.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. THAT every member of society hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, li∣berty and property, and therefore is bound to con∣tribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and yield his personal service, when necessary, or an equivalent thereto: But no part of a man's property can be justly taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of his legal representatives: Nor can any man who is conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, be justly compelled thereto, if he will pay such equivalent: Nor are the people bound by any laws, but such as they have in like manner assent∣ed to, for their common good.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That in all prosecutions for criminal offen∣ces, a man hath a right to be heard by himself and his Council, to demand the cause and nature of his
<PB N="8" REF="014979_0007_0F973FEDA5173958"/>
accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses, to call for evidence in his favour, and a speedy public trial, by an impartial Jury of the country, without the unanimous consent of which Jury he cannot be found guilty: Nor can he be compelled to give evi∣dence against himself: Nor can any man be justly deprived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="10">X. THAT the people have a right to hold them∣selves, their houses, papers and possessions free from search or seizure; and therefore warrants with∣out oaths or affirmations first made, affording a suf∣ficient foundation for them, and whereby any of∣ficer or messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person or persons, his or their property, not particularly des∣cribed, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="11">XI. THAT in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the parties have a right to trial by Jury, which ought to be held sacred.</P>
<P N="12">XII. THAT the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writing, and publishing their sen∣timents; therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="9" REF="014979_0008_0F973FEE6D72EEF8"/>XIII. THAT the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State; and as standing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THAT a frequent recurrence to fundamen∣tal principles, and a firm adherence to justice, mo∣deration, temperance, industry and frugality, are absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of li∣berty, and keep a government free: The people ought therefore to pay particular attention to these points in the choice of Officers and Representatives, and have a right to exact a due and constant regard to them, from their Legislators and Magistrates in the making and executing such laws as are necessary for the good government of the State.</P>
<P N="15">XV. THAT all men have a natural inherent right to emigrate from one State to another that will re∣ceive them, or to form a new State in vacant coun∣tries, or in such countries as they can purchase, whenever they think that thereby they may pro∣mote their own happiness.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THAT the people have a right to assemble together, to consult for their common good, to in∣struct their Representatives, and to apply to the Legislature for redress of grievances, by address, petition or remonstrance.</P>
