<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FOR many Years I have had a Desire of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting down and laying together, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t has occured to my Mind, either in Reading, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hinking, or Conversa∣tion, which might assist serious Persons, who have not the Advantage of Learning, in understanding the New Testament. But I have been continually deterred from attempting any Thing of this Kind, by a deep Sense of my own Inability: Of my Want not only of Learn∣ing for such a Work, but much more of Experience and Wisdom. This has often occasioned my laying aside the Thought. And when by much Importunity I have been prevailed upon to resume it, still I determined to delay it as long as possible, that (if it should please GOD) I might finish my Work and my Life together.</P>
<P N="2">2. But having lately had a loud Call from GOD, to arise and go hence, I am convinced that, if I attempt any Thing of this Kind at all, I must not delay any longer. My Day is far spent, and (even in a natural Way) the Shadows of the Evening come on apace. And I am the rather induced to do what little I can in this Way, because I can do nothing else: Being pre∣vented by my present Weakness, from either Travel∣ling or Preaching. But, blessed be GOD, I can still read, and write, and think. O that it may be to his Glory!</P>
<P N="3">3. It will be easily discerned, even from what I have said already, and much more from the Notes them∣selves, that they were not principally designed for Men of Learning; who are provided with many other Helps: And much less for Men of long and deep Ex∣perience in the Ways and Word of GOD. I desire to sit at their Feet, and to learn of them. But I write chiefly for plain, unlettered Men, who understand only their Mother-Tongue, and yet reverence and love
<PB N="iv" REF="023976_0004_0FC2A545B6DC3468"/>the Word of GOD, and have a Desire to save their Souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. In order to assist these in such a Measure as I am able, I design first to set down the Text itself, for the most Part, in the common <HI>English</HI> Translation, which is in general (so far as I can judge) abundantly the best that I have seen. Yet I do not say it is incapa∣ble of being brought in several Places nearer to the Original. Neither will I affirm, That the <HI>Greek</HI> Co∣pies from which this Translation was made, are always the most correct. And therefore I shall take the Li∣berty, as Occasion may require, to make here and there a small Alteration.</P>
<P N="5">5. I am very sensible this will be liable to Objections: Nay, to Objections of quite opposite Kinds. Some will probably think, the Text is altered too much; and others, that it is altered too little. To the for∣mer I would observe, That I have never knowingly, so much as in one Place, altered it, for Altering's Sake: But there, and there only, where, First, The Sense was made better, stronger, clearer, or more con∣sistent with the Context: Secondly, Where the Sense being equally good, the Phrase was better or nearer the Original. To the latter, who think the Altera∣tions too few, and that the Translation might have been nearer still, I answer, This is true; I acknow∣ledge it might. But what valuable End would it have answered, to multiply such trivial Alterations, as add neither Clearness nor Strength to the Text? This I could not prevail upon myself to do: So much the less, because there is, to my Apprehension, I know not what, peculiarly solemn and venerable in the Old Lan∣guage of our Translation. And suppose this to be a mistaken Apprehension, and an Instance of human In∣firmity; yet is it not an excusable Infirmity, to be un∣willing to part with what we have been long accus∣tomed to, and to love the very Words, by which GOD has often conveyed Strength or Comfort to our Souls?</P>
<P N="6">6. I have endeavoured to make the Notes as short as possible, that the Comment may not obscure or swallow up the Text: And as plain as possible, in Pur∣suance of my main Design, To assist the unlearned Read∣er:
<PB N="v" REF="023976_0005_0FC2A549771549B0"/>For this Reason I have studiously avoided, not only all curious and critical Enquiries, and all Use of the learned Languages, but all such Methods of Rea∣soning and Modes of Expression, as People in com∣mon Life are unacquainted with: For the same Reason, as I rather endeavour to obviate than to propose and answer Objections, so I purposely decline going deep into many Difficulties, lest I should leave the ordinary Reader behind me.</P>
<P N="7">7. I once designed to write down, barely what occurred to my own Mind, consulting none but the inspired Writers. But no sooner was I acquainted with that great Light of the Christian World (lately gone to his Reward) <HI>Bengelius,</HI> than I entirely changed my Design, being throughly convinced, it might be of more Service to the Cause of Religion, were I barely to translate his <HI>Gnomon Novi Testamenti,</HI> than to write many Volumes upon it. Many of his excellent Notes I have therefore translated. Many more I have abridged; omitting that Part which was purely critical, and giving the Substance of the rest. Those various Readings likewise which he has shewed to have a vast Majority of ancient Copies and Translations on their Side, I have without Scruple incorporated with the Text: Which after his Manner I have divided all along (tho' not omitting the common Division into Chapters and Verses, which is of Use on various Ac∣counts) according to the Matter it contains, making a larger or smaller Pause, just as the Sense requires. And even this is such an Help in many Places, as one who has not tried it can scarcely conceive.</P>
<P N="8">8. I am likewise indebted for some useful Observa∣tions, to Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s <HI>Theological Lectures:</HI> And for many more to Dr. <HI>Guyse,</HI> and to the <HI>Family Expositor</HI> of the late pious and learned Dr. <HI>Doddridge.</HI> It was a Doubt with me for some Time, whether I should not subjoin to every Note I received from them, the Name of the Author from whom it was taken; especially consider∣ing I had transcribed some, and abridged many more, almost in the Words of the Author. But upon farther Consideration, I resolved to name none, that nothing might divert the Mind of the Reader from keeping
<PB N="vi" REF="023976_0006_0FC2A5566C385BB8"/>close to the Point in View, and receiving what was spoke, only according to its own intrinsic Value.</P>
<P N="9">9. I cannot flatter myself so far (to use the Words of one of the above-named Writers) as to imagine that I have fallen into no Mistakes, in a Work of so great Difficulty. But my own Conscience acquits me of having designedly misrepresented any single Passage of Scripture, or of having written one Line, with a Pur∣pose of inflaming the Hearts of Christians against each other. GOD forbid that I should make the Words of the most gentle and benevolent JESUS, a Vehicle to convey such Poison. Would to GOD that all the Party Names, and unscriptural Phrases and Forms, which have divided the Christian World, were forgot: And that we might all agree to sit down together, as humble, loving Disciples, at the Feet of our common Master, to hear his Word, to imbibe his Spirit, and to transcribe his Life in our own!</P>
<P N="10">10. Concerning the Scriptures in general, it may be observed, the Word of the Living GOD, which directed the first Patriarchs also, was, in the Time of <HI>Moses,</HI> committed to Writing. To this were added, in several succeeding Generations, the inspired Wri∣tings of the other Prophets. Afterwards, what the Son of GOD preached, and the HOLY GHOST spake by the Apostles, the Apostles and Evangelists wrote. This is what we now stile the <HI>Holy Scripture:</HI> This is that <HI>Word of</HI> GOD <HI>which remaineth for ever:</HI> Of which, tho' <HI>Heaven and Earth pass away, one Jot or Tittle shall not pass away.</HI> The Scripture therefore of the <HI>Old and New Testament,</HI> is a most solid and precious System of Divine Truth. Every Part thereof is worthy of GOD; and all together are one entire Body, wherein is no Defect, no Excess. It is the Fountain of heavenly Wisdom, which they who are able to taste, prefer to all Writings of Men, however wise, or learned, or holy.</P>
<P N="11">11. An exact Knowledge of the Truth was accom∣panied in the inspired Writers with an exactly regular Series of Arguments, a precise Expression of their Mean∣ing, and a genuine Vigour of suitable Affections. The Chain of Argument in each Book is briefly exhibited in
<PB N="vii" REF="023976_0007_0FC2A55B2FF85D70"/>the Table presixt to it, which contains also the Sum thereof, and may be of more Use, than prefixing the Argument to each Chapter; the Division of the <HI>New Testament</HI> into Chapters, having been made in the dark Ages, and very incorrectly; often separating Things that are closely joined, and joining those that are en∣tirely distinct from each other.</P>
<P N="12">12. In the Language of the Sacred Writings, we may observe the utmost Depth, together with the utmost Ease. All the Elegancies of human Compo∣sures sink into nothing before it: GOD speaks not as Man, but as GOD. His Thoughts are very deep; and thence his Words are of inexhaustible Virtue. And the Language of his Messengers also is exact in the hignest Degree: For the Words which were given them, accurately answered the Impression made upon their Minds: and hence <HI>Luther</HI> says, <Q>Divinity is nothing but a Grammar of the Language of the Holy Ghost.</Q> To understand this throughly, we should observe the <HI>Emphasis</HI> which lies on every Word; the holy <HI>Affections</HI> exprest thereby, and the <HI>Tempers</HI> shewn by every Writer. But how little are these, the latter especially, regarded? Tho' they are wonderfully diffused thro' the whole <HI>New Testament,</HI> and are in Truth a continued Commendation of Him, who acts, or speaks, or writes.</P>
<P N="13">13. The <HI>New Testament</HI> is, all those Sacred Writings in which the <HI>New Testament</HI> or Covenant is deseribed. The former Part of this contains the Writings of the Evangelists and Apostles: The latter, the Revelation of JESUS CHRIST. In the former is, first, the History of JESUS CHRIST, from his Coming in the Flesh, to his Ascension into Heaven; then, the Institution and History of the Christian Church, from the Time of his Ascension. The Revelation delivers what is to be, with regard to CHRIST, the Church, and the Uni∣verse, till the Consummation of all Things.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES ON THE Gospel according to St. MATTHEW.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>THE <HI>Gospel</HI> (that is, Good Tidings) means a Book containing the Good Tidings of our Salvation by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Mark</HI> in his Gospel presupposes that of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and sup∣plies what is omitted therein. St. <HI>Luke</HI> supplies what is omitted by both the former: St. <HI>John</HI> what is omitted by all the three.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Matthew</HI> particularly points out the fulfilling of the Prophecies for the Conviction of the Jews. St. <HI>Mark</HI> wrote a short Compendium, and yet added many remarkable Circumstances omitted by St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> particularly with regard to the Apostles, immediately after they were called. St. <HI>Luke</HI> treated principally of the Office of Christ, and mostly in an historical Manner. St. <HI>John</HI> refuted those who denied his God-head: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h chusing to treat more largely on those Things, which most suited the Time when, and the Persons to whom he wrote.</P>

<P>It may be farther observed, That the Word <HI>Christ</HI> in <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Messiah</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI> signify Anointed, and imply the prophetic, priestly, and royal Characters, which were to meet in the <HI>Messiah.</HI> Among the <HI>Jews,</HI> Anointing was the Ceremony whereby Prophets, Priests, and Kings, were initiated into those Offices. And if we look into ourselves, we shall find a Want of <HI>Christ</HI> in all these Respects. We are by Nature at a Distance from GOD, alienated from Him, and incapable of a free Access to Him. Hence we want a Mediator, an Intercessor, in a Word, a <HI>Christ,</HI> in his priestly Office. This regards our State with Respect to GOD. And with Respect to ourselves, we find a total Darkness, Blindness, Ignorance of GOD, and the Things of GOD. Now here we want <HI>Christ</HI> in his prophetic Office, to enlighten our Minds and teach us the whole Will of GOD. We find also within us a strange Misrule of Appetites and Passions.

<P>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold wise men 
came from the East to Jerusalem, saying, <MILESTONE N="2"/> Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to do him homage. 
<MILESTONE N="3"/> When Herod the king had heard <HI>these things,</HI> he was

troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <MILESTONE N="4"/> And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them, Where the Christ 
was to be born? <MILESTONE N="5"/> And they said to him, in Bethle∣hem of Judea; for thus it is written by the pro∣phet, 
<MILESTONE N="6"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Micah</HI> V. 2.</NOTE> And thou, Bethlehem in the land of Judah; art in no wise the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Governor, who 
shall rule my people Israel. <MILESTONE N="7"/> Then Herod, having privately called the wise men, inquired of them with great exactness, at what time the star ap∣peared: 
<MILESTONE N="8"/> And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, inquire exactly concerning the young child, and if ye find <HI>him,</HI> bring me word again, that I 
also may come and do him homage. <MILESTONE N="9"/> And having heard the king, they departed; and lo the star which they had seen in the East, moved on before them, till it came and stood over where.the young 
child was. <MILESTONE N="10"/> And seeing the star, they rejoiced with 
exceeding great joy. <MILESTONE N="11"/> And being come into the
<PB N="18" REF="023976_0017_0FC2A584E081CAE8"/>house, they saw the young child, with Mary his mother; and falling down, they did him homage. And opening their treasures, they presented to him 
gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <MILESTONE N="12"/> And hav∣ing been warned of God in a dream, not to return to Herod, they retired into their own country ano∣ther way.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13"/> And when they had retired, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his Mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there till I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the young child to 
destroy him. <MILESTONE N="14"/> And he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and retired into 
Egypt, And continued there till the death of He∣rod; <MILESTONE N="15"/> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hosea</HI> xi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1.</NOTE> Out of E∣gypt 
have I called my son. <MILESTONE N="16"/> Then Herod, seeing he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sending forth, slew all the male chil∣dren that were in Bethlehem, and in all the confines thereof, from two years old and under; according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the 
wise men. <MILESTONE N="17"/> Then was fulfilled that which was
<PB N="19" REF="023976_0018_0FC2A59098F0C400"/>
spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, <MILESTONE N="18"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 15.</NOTE> In Ra∣ma was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because 
they are not. <MILESTONE N="19"/> But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Jo∣seph 
in Egypt, saying, <MILESTONE N="20"/> Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Is∣rael; for they are dead who sought the young 
child's life. <MILESTONE N="21"/> And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of 
Israel. <MILESTONE N="22"/> But having heard, Archelaus reigneth over Judea, in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither, and being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee. 
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</P>

<P>This Verse is a general Cantion against Vain-glory, in any of our good Works: All these are here summed up together, in the com∣prehensive Word <HI>Righteousness.</HI> This general Caution our LORD ap∣plies in the Sequel to the three principal Branches of it, relating to our Neighbour, Ver. 2—4: to GOD, Ver. 5—6: and to ourselves Ver. 16—18.</P>

<P>Should we not consider all Crosses, all Things grievous to Flesh and Blood, as what they really are, as Opportunities of embracing GOD's Will, at the Expence of our own? And consequently as so many Steps by which we may advance toward Perfection? We should make a swift Progress in the spiritual Life, if we were faithful in this Practice. Crosses are so frequent, that whoever makes Ad∣vantage of them, will soon be a great Gainer. Great Crosses are Occasions of great Improvement: And the little ones, which come daily, and even hourly, make up in Number, what they want in Weight. We may in these daily and hourly Crosses, make effectual Oblations of our Will to GOD; which Oblations, so frequently re∣peated, will soon mount to a great Sum. Let us remember then (what can never be sufficiently inculcated) That GOD is the Author of all Events: That none is so small or inconsiderable, as to escape his Notice and Direction. Every Event therefore declares to us the Will of GOD, to which thus declared, we should heartily submit. We should renounce our own to embrace it; we should approve and chuse what his Choice warrants as best for us. Herein should we exercise ourselves continually; this should be our Practice all the Day long. We should in Humility accept the little Crosses that are dispensed to us, as those that best suit our Weakness. Let us bear these little Things, at least for GOD's Sake, and prefer his Will to our own in Matters of so small Importance. And his Goodness will accept these mean Oblations; for He depiseth not the Day of small Things.</P>

<P>For the kingdom of heaven is like an houshol∣der, who went out early in the morning to hire 
labourers into his vineyard. <MILESTONE N="2"/> And he having a∣greed with the labourers for a penny a day, he 
sent them into his vineyard. <MILESTONE N="3"/> And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle 
in the market-place, <MILESTONE N="4"/> And said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I 
will give you. <MILESTONE N="5"/> And they went. Again going out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise. 
<MILESTONE N="6"/> And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing idle, and saith to them, Why stand 
ye here all the day idle? They say to him, Be∣cause no man hath hired us. <MILESTONE N="7"/> He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is 
right ye shall receive. <MILESTONE N="8"/> And in the evening the lord of the vineyard saith to the steward, Call the
<PB N="98" REF="023976_0097_0FC2A713DBCD1C78"/>labourers, and pay them their hire, beginning from 
the last to the first. <MILESTONE N="9"/> And when they came who <HI>were hired</HI> about the eleventh hour, they received 
every one a penny. <MILESTONE N="10"/> But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every one a penny, 
<MILESTONE N="11"/> And having received <HI>it,</HI> they murmured against 
the housholder, saying. <MILESTONE N="12"/> These last have wrought one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden and the heat of the 
day. <MILESTONE N="13"/> And he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst not thou agree 
with me for a penny? <MILESTONE N="14"/> Take what is thine, and go: it is my will to give to this last, even as to 
thee. <MILESTONE N="15"/> Is it not lawful to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</P>

<P>And Jesus answering, spake to them again in

<MILESTONE N="3"/> And sent forth his servants to call them that were invited, to the marriage; but they would not come. 
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them who were invited, behold I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fatlings <HI>are</HI> killed, and 
all things <HI>are</HI> ready: come to the marriage. <MILESTONE N="5"/> But they slighting <HI>it,</HI> went one to his farm, another to

<MILESTONE N="7"/> And the king hearing <HI>it</HI> was wroth, and sending forth his troops, destroyed those murderers and 
burnt their city. <MILESTONE N="8"/> Then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast is prepared, but they who were 
invited were not worthy. <MILESTONE N="9"/> Go ye therefore into the highways, and invite whomsoever ye find to 
the wedding-banquet. <MILESTONE N="10"/> So those servants going out into the ways, gathered together all whomso∣ever they found, both bad and good. And the 
feast was abundantly supplied with guests. <MILESTONE N="11"/> But the king coming in to see the guests, saw there a man 
who had not on a wedding-garment, <MILESTONE N="12"/> And saith
<PB N="107" REF="023976_0106_0FC2A0D710FD78D8"/>to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speech∣less. 
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Then said the king to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast <HI>him</HI> into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping

of men. <MILESTONE N="17"/> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not? 
But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? <MILESTONE N="18"/> Shew me the tribute-money. 
<MILESTONE N="19"/> And they brought to him a penny. 
<MILESTONE N="20"/> He saith to them, Whose <HI>is</HI> this image and super∣scription? 
They say to him, Cesar's. <MILESTONE N="21"/> Then said he to them, Render therefore to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are 
God's. <MILESTONE N="22"/> And hearing <HI>it</HI> they marvelled. And they left him and went away.</P>

<P>As <HI>Salt is good</HI> for preserving Meats, and making them savoury, so it is good that ye be seasoned with Grace, for the purifying your Hearts and Lives, and for spreading the Savour of my Knowledge, both in your own Souls, and wherever ye go.

<MILESTONE N="12"/> And Zacharias seeing <HI>him</HI> was troubled, and fear 
fell upon him. <MILESTONE N="13"/> But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shall 
call his name John. <MILESTONE N="14"/> And thou shalt have joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice at his birth. 
<MILESTONE N="15"/> For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mo∣ther's 
womb. <MILESTONE N="16"/> And many of the children of Israel 
shall he turn to the Lord their God. <MILESTONE N="17"/> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make
<PB N="211" REF="023976_0210_0FC29D7FF72B5E08"/>
ready a people prepared for the Lord. <MILESTONE N="18"/> And Za∣charias said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife advanced 
in Years. <MILESTONE N="19"/> And the Angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to thee, and to shew thee 
these glad tidings. <MILESTONE N="20"/> And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, till the day that these things are done, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. 
<MILESTONE N="21"/> And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. 
<MILESTONE N="22"/> And coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; for he beckoned to them, and remained 
speechless. <MILESTONE N="23"/> And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house. 
<MILESTONE N="24"/> And after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived,
<PB N="212" REF="023976_0211_0FC29D8176204320"/>
and hid herself five months, saying, <MILESTONE N="25"/> Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my Reproach among men.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26"/> And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, to a city of Galilee, named Naza∣reth. 
<MILESTONE N="27"/> To a virgin of the house of David, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, and the virgin's 
name <HI>was</HI> Mary. <MILESTONE N="28"/> And the Angel coming in to her, said, Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord <HI>is</HI> 
with thee: blessed <HI>art</HI> thou among women. <MILESTONE N="29"/> But she seeing <HI>him,</HI> was troubled at his saying, and reasoned, what manner of salutation this should be. 
<MILESTONE N="30"/> And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for 
thou hast found favour with God. <MILESTONE N="31"/> And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth 
a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. <MILESTONE N="32"/> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of his 
father David. <MILESTONE N="33"/> And he shall reign over the house
<PB N="213" REF="023976_0212_0FC29D8343828F40"/>of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall 
be no end. <MILESTONE N="34"/> Then said Mary to the angel, How 
shall this be, seeing I know not a man? <MILESTONE N="35"/> And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born, shall be called the Son 
of God. <MILESTONE N="36"/> And behold thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 
<MILESTONE N="37"/> For with God, nothing shall be impossible. 
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word. <MILESTONE N="38"/> And the angel departed from her.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="39"/> And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste 
into the hill-country, into a city of Judah, <MILESTONE N="40"/> And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Eli∣sabeth. 
<MILESTONE N="41"/> And when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth 
was filled with the Holy Ghost, <MILESTONE N="42"/> And cried with a loud voice and said, Blessed <HI>art</HI> thou among women,
<PB N="214" REF="023976_0213_0FC29D8FB1C30F38"/>
and blessed <HI>is</HI> the fruit of thy womb. <MILESTONE N="43"/> And whence <HI>is</HI> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should 
come to me? <MILESTONE N="44"/> For lo! when the voice of thy sa∣lutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in 
my womb for joy. <MILESTONE N="45"/> And happy <HI>is</HI> she that be∣lieved; for there shall be a performance of those 
things which were told her from the Lord. <MILESTONE N="46"/> And 
Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, <MILESTONE N="47"/> And 
my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. <MILESTONE N="48"/> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaid: for behold from henceforth all generations shall 
call me blessed. <MILESTONE N="49"/> For he that is mighty hath done 
to me great things, and holy <HI>is</HI> his name. <MILESTONE N="50"/> And his mercy is on them that fear him, from genera∣tion 
to generation. <MILESTONE N="51"/> He hath wrought strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the 
imagination of their hearts. <MILESTONE N="52"/> He hath put down the mighty from <HI>their</HI> thrones, and exalted them 
of low degree. <MILESTONE N="53"/> He hath filled the hungry with 
good things, but sent the rich empty away. <MILESTONE N="54"/> He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of
<PB N="215" REF="023976_0214_0FC29D924B939F80"/>
<MILESTONE N="55"/> <HI>his</HI> mercy, As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham 
and to his seed for ever. <MILESTONE N="56"/> And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="57"/> Now Elisabeth's full time came, that she should 
be delivered, and she brought forth a son. <MILESTONE N="58"/> And her neighbours and relations heard, that the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her, and they re∣joiced 
with her. <MILESTONE N="59"/> And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Za∣charias, 
after the name of his father. <MILESTONE N="60"/> But his mother answering, said, Nay, but he shall be called 
John. <MILESTONE N="61"/> And they said to her, There is none of 
thy kindred that is called by this name. <MILESTONE N="62"/> And they made signs to his father, what he would have 
him called. <MILESTONE N="63"/> And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they mar∣velled 
all. <MILESTONE N="64"/> And immediately his mouth was open∣ed, and his tongue <HI>loosed,</HI> and he spake, blessing 
God. <MILESTONE N="65"/> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were noised 
abroad, in all the hill-country of Judea. <MILESTONE N="66"/> And all that heard <HI>them,</HI> laid <HI>them</HI> up in their hearts, say∣ing, What manner of child shall this be? And 
the hand of the Lord was with him. <MILESTONE N="67"/> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, 
and prophesied, saying, <MILESTONE N="68"/> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his 
people, <MILESTONE N="69"/> And hath raised up an horn of salvation 
for us, in the house of his servant David: <MILESTONE N="70"/> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who
<PB N="216" REF="023976_0215_0FC29D93830481B8"/>
have been since the world began: <MILESTONE N="71"/> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of 
all that hate us; <MILESTONE N="72"/> To perform the mercy <HI>promised</HI> to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, 
<MILESTONE N="73"/> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 
<MILESTONE N="74"/> That he would grant us, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, to serve him without 
fear, <MILESTONE N="75"/> In holiness and righteousness before him, all 
the days of our life. <MILESTONE N="76"/> And thou, child, shalt be a prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before 
the face of the Lord, <MILESTONE N="77"/> To prepare his ways, To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the re∣mission 
of their sins, <MILESTONE N="78"/> Thro' the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high 
hath visited us, <MILESTONE N="79"/> to shine on them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to direct our 
feet into the way of peace. <MILESTONE N="80"/> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his being shewn to Israel.</P>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> viii. 5.</NOTE> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Caper∣naum. 
<MILESTONE N="2"/> And a certain centurion's servant, who 
was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. <MILESTONE N="3"/> And hearing of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, beseeching him to come and heal his servant. 
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And coming to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou shouldest do 
this. <MILESTONE N="5"/> For he loveth our nation, and hath himself 
built us a synagogue. <MILESTONE N="6"/> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy 
that thou shouldest enter under my roof. <MILESTONE N="7"/> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but speak in a word, and my servant shall be 
healed. <MILESTONE N="8"/> For I am a man set under authority, hav∣ing soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and 
he doth it. <MILESTONE N="9"/> Jesus hearing these things, marvelled at him, and turning, said to the people that fol∣lowed him, I say to you, I have not found so great 
faith, no, not in Israel. <MILESTONE N="10"/> And they that had been sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11"/> And he went afterward to a city called Nain, 
and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude. <MILESTONE N="12"/> And as he drew nigh the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her. 
<MILESTONE N="13"/> And the Lord seeing her, was moved with tender 
compassion for her, and said, Weep not <MILESTONE N="14"/> And coming near, he touched the bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bearer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="239" REF="023976_0238_0FC29DEC02DCC5D8"/>
speak: and he delivered him to his mother. <MILESTONE N="16"/> And fear seized all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and God hath 
visited his people. <MILESTONE N="17"/> And this rumour of him went forth through all Judea, and all the country round about.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 2.</NOTE> And the disciples of John informed him of all 
these things. <MILESTONE N="19"/> And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent <HI>them</HI> to Jesus, saying, Art thou 
he that is to come, or look we for another? <MILESTONE N="20"/> And the men being come to him, said, John the Bap∣tist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that 
is to come, or look we for another? <MILESTONE N="21"/> And in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and to many that were blind he 
gave sight. <MILESTONE N="22"/> And he answering said to them, Go and relate to John the things ye have seen and heard: the blind see; the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; 
to the poor the gospel is preached. <MILESTONE N="23"/> And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me. 
And when the messengers of John were departed, he said to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? <MILESTONE N="24"/> A reed shaken 
by the wind? <MILESTONE N="25"/> But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are splendidly apparelled, and live delicately, are 
in king's palaces. <MILESTONE N="26"/> But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say, to you, and much more 
than a prophet. <MILESTONE N="27"/> This is he of whom it is written, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 1.</NOTE> Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,

who shall prepare thy way before thee. <MILESTONE N="28"/> For I say to you, among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Bap∣tist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God, 
is greater than he. <MILESTONE N="29"/> And all the people that heard <HI>him,</HI> and the publicans, justified God, being bap∣tized 
with the baptism of John. <MILESTONE N="30"/> But the Pharisees and the Scribes made void the counsel of God toward themselves, being not baptized of him. 
<MILESTONE N="31"/> To whom then shall I liken the men of this ge∣neration, 
and to what are they like? <MILESTONE N="32"/> They are like children sitting in the market-place, and cast∣ing one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourn∣ed 
to you, and ye have not wept. <MILESTONE N="33"/> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking 
wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. <MILESTONE N="34"/> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a 
friend of publicans and sinners. <MILESTONE N="35"/> But wisdom is justified by all her children.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="36"/> And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, he sat

down to table. <MILESTONE N="37"/> And behold a woman in the city, who had been a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an 
alabaster box of ointment, <MILESTONE N="38"/> And standing at his feet behind <HI>him</HI> weeping, watered his feet with a shower of tears, and wiped <HI>them,</HI> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them 
with the ointment. <MILESTONE N="39"/> But the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing <HI>it,</HI> spake within himself, say∣ing, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known, who and what manner of woman <HI>this is</HI> 
that toucheth him; for she is a sinner. <MILESTONE N="40"/> And Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to 
say to thee. <MILESTONE N="41"/> And he saith, Master, say on. A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed 
five hundred pence, and the other fifty. <MILESTONE N="42"/> But they having nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them 
both. <MILESTONE N="43"/> Which therefore will love him most? Simon answering said, I suppose he to whom he forgave most. He said to him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? <MILESTONE N="44"/> I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath watered my seet with tears, and wiped <HI>them</HI> with 
the hairs of her head. <MILESTONE N="45"/> Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased 
to kiss my feet. <MILESTONE N="46"/> Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she hath anointed my feet with oint∣ment
<PB N="242" REF="023976_0241_0FC29DF92F458C18"/>
<MILESTONE N="47"/> Wherefore I say to thee, Those many sins of her's are forgiven; therefore she loveth much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little. 
<MILESTONE N="48"/> And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven thee. 
<MILESTONE N="49"/> And they that sat at table with him said within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

<P><LABEL>V. 32.</LABEL> <HI>This thy brother was dead and is alive</HI>—A thousand of these delicate Touches in the inspired Writings, escape an inattentive Reader. In the 30th Verse the elder Son had unkindly and inde∣cently said, <HI>This thy son.</HI> The Father in his Reply mildly reproves him, and tenderly says, <HI>This thy brother.</HI> Amazing Intimation, that the best of Men ought to account the worst Sinners their Brethren still; and should especially remember this Relation, when they shew any Inclination to return. </P>
<P>Our LORD in this whole Parable shews, not only that the Jews had no Cause to murmur at the Reception of the Gentiles (a Point which did not at that Time so directly fall under Consideration) but that if the Pharisees were indeed as good as they sancied themselves to be, still they had no Reason to murmur at the kind Treatment of any sincere Penitent. Thus does He condemn them, even on their own Principles, and so leaves them without Excuse.</P>
<P>We have in this Parable a lively Emblem of the Condition and Behaviour of Sinners in their natural State. Thus, when inriched by the Bounty of the great common Father, do they ungratefully run from him (ver. 12.) Sensual Pleasures are eagerly pursued, till they have squandered away all the Grace of GOD (ver. 13.) And while these continue, not a serious Thought of GOD can sind a Place in their Minds. And even when Afflictions come upon them (ver. 14.) still they will make hard Shifts, before they will let the Grace of GOD, concurring with his Providence, persuade them to think of a Return (ver. 15, 16)</P>
<P>When they see themselves naked, indigent, and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>one, then they recover the Exercise of their Reason (ver. 17.) Then they remem∣ber the Blessings they have thrown away, and attend to the Misery they have incurred. And hereupon they resolve to return to their Father, and put the Resolution immediately in Practice (ver. 18, 19.)</P>
<P>Behold with Wonder and Pleasure, the gracious Reception <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sind, from divine, injured Goodness! When such a Prodigal comes to his Father, He sees him afar off (ver. 20.) He pities, meets, embraces him, and interrupts his Acknowledgments, with the To∣kens of his returning Favour (ver. 21.) He arrays him with the Robe of a Redeemer's Righteousness, with inward and outward Ho∣liness, adorns him with all his sanctifying Graces, and honours him with the Tokens of adopting Love (ver. 22.) And all this he does with unutterable Delight, in that he who was lost is now found (ver. 23, 24.)</P>
<P>Let no elder Brother murmur at this Indulgence, but rather wel∣come the Prodigal back into the Family. And let those who have been thus received, wander no more, but emulate the strictest Piety of those who for many Years have served their heavenly Father, and not transgressed his Commandments.</P>

<P>IN the beginning existed the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
<MILESTONE N="2"/> The same was in the beginning with God.

<MILESTONE N="3"/> All things were made by him, and without him 
was not one single thing made that was made. <MILESTONE N="4"/> In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/> And the light shineth in darkness, but the darkness perceived it not.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/> There was a man sent from God, whose name <HI>was</HI> John. 
<MILESTONE N="7"/> The same came for a testimony, to 
testify of the light, that all thro' it might believe. 
<MILESTONE N="8"/> He was not the light, but <HI>was sent</HI> to testify of the 
light. <MILESTONE N="9"/> <HI>This</HI> was the true light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the 
world, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and the world was made by him; yet the 
world knew him not. <MILESTONE N="11"/> He came to his own, and 
his own received him not. <MILESTONE N="12"/> But as many as received
<PB N="323" REF="023976_0322_0FC2CB4406202938"/>him, to them gave he privilege to become the sons 
of God, to them that believe in his name: <MILESTONE N="13"/> Who were born, not of blood, nor by the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14"/> And the word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"/> John testified of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me. 
<MILESTONE N="16"/> And out of his fulness have we all received, even grace
<PB N="324" REF="023976_0323_0FC2CB48B3AE9B28"/>
upon grace. <MILESTONE N="17"/> For the law was given by Moses, <HI>but</HI> grace and truth was by Jesus Christ. 
<MILESTONE N="18"/> No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, 
who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <HI>him. </HI> <MILESTONE N="19"/> And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, 
to ask him, Who art thou? <MILESTONE N="20"/> And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21"/> and they asked him, What then, Art thou Elijah? 
And he saith, I am not. <MILESTONE N="22"/> Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they to him, Who art thou? That we may give an answer to them that 
sent us. <MILESTONE N="23"/> What sayest thou of thyself? He said,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> xl. 3.</NOTE> I <HI>am</HI> the voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the 
prophet Isaiah. <MILESTONE N="24"/> And they who were sent were of the Pharifees. And they asked him and said to him, 
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the
<PB N="325" REF="023976_0324_0FC2CB49AD2F5E18"/>
Christ, nor Elijah, neither the prophet? <MILESTONE N="26"/> John answered them, saying I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27"/> He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before 
me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to un∣loose. <MILESTONE N="28"/> These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29"/> The next day he seeth Jesus coming toward him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh 
away the sin of the world. <MILESTONE N="30"/> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred be∣fore 
me; for he was before me. <MILESTONE N="31"/> And I knew him not, but that he might be manifested to Israel, 
therefore am I come baptizing with water. <MILESTONE N="32"/> And John testified, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven as a dove, and it abode upon him. 
<MILESTONE N="33"/> And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, he had said to me, On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, this is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</P>
<PB N="326" REF="023976_0325_0FC2CB4B23DFCAC8"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="34"/> And I saw <HI>it,</HI> and testified, that this is the Son of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="35"/> Again, the next day, John was standing, and two of his disciples. And looking upon Jesus 
walking, he saith, <MILESTONE N="36"/> Behold the Lamb of God. And 
the two disciples heard him speak, and they fol∣lowed Jesus. <MILESTONE N="37"/> And Jesus turning and seeing them 
following, saith to them, What seek ye? <MILESTONE N="38"/> They said to him, Rabbi (that is, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou? He saith to them, 
Come and see. <MILESTONE N="39"/> They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour. <MILESTONE N="40"/> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John <HI>speak,</HI> 
and followed him. <MILESTONE N="41"/> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, the Christ.) 
And he brought him to Jesus. <MILESTONE N="42"/> And Jesus looking upon him, said, Thou art Simon, the Son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Peter.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="43"/> The day following he was minded to depart into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, 
Follow me. <MILESTONE N="44"/> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the 
city of Andrew and Peter. <MILESTONE N="45"/> Philip findeth Natha∣nael and saith to him, We have found him, whom Moses in the law and the prophets described, Jesus
<PB N="327" REF="023976_0326_0FC2CB4C9B61EB10"/>
of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. <MILESTONE N="46"/> And Nathanael saith to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see. 
<MILESTONE N="47"/> Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no 
guile. <MILESTONE N="48"/> Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, 
I saw thee. <MILESTONE N="49"/> Nathanael answered and saith to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art 
the king of Israel. <MILESTONE N="50"/> Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than 
these. <MILESTONE N="51"/> And he saith to him, Verily, verily I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</P>

He was when all Things be∣gan to be, Whatsoever had a Beginning. <HI>The Word</HI>—So termed <HI>Psal.</HI> xxxiii. 6. and frequently by the Seventy, and in the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Para∣phrase. So that St. <HI>John</HI> did not borrow this Expression from <HI>Philo,</HI> or any Heathen Writer. He was not yet named <HI>Jesus, or Christ.</HI> He is <HI>the Word</HI> whom the Father begot or <HI>spoke</HI> from Eternity; by whom the Father <HI>speaking</HI> maketh all Things; who <HI>speaketh</HI> the Fa∣ther to us. We have, in the 18th Verse, both a real Description of the Word, and the Reason why He is so called. <HI>He is the only begotten Son of the Father, who is in the bosom of the Father, and hath declared him. And the Word was with God</HI>—Therefore distinct from GOD the Father. The Word rendered <HI>with</HI> denotes a perpetual Ten∣dency as it were of the Son to the Father, in Unity of Essence. He was <HI>with</HI> GOD alone; because nothing beside GOD had then any Be∣ing. <HI>And the Word was God</HI>—Supreme, Eternal, Independent. There was no Creature, in respect of which He could be stiled GOD in a relative Sense. Therefore He is stiled so in the absolute Sense. The Godhead of the <HI>Messiah</HI> being clearly revealed in the Old Testament (<HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 6. <HI>Hos.</HI> i. 7. <HI>Psal.</HI> xxiii. 1.) the other Evangelists aim at this, To prove that <HI>Jesus,</HI> a true Man, was the <HI>Messiah.</HI> But when at length some from hence began to doubt of his Godhead, then St. <HI>John</HI> expresly asserted it, and wrote in this Book as it were a Supplement to the Gospels, as in <HI>the Revelation,</HI> to the Prophets.</P>

<MILESTONE N="9"/> When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine (he knew not whence it was, but the servants who had drawn the water knew) the governor of the

<P><MILESTONE N="12"/> After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his bretheren, and his disci∣ples: and they tarried there not many days. 
<MILESTONE N="13"/> For the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, 
<MILESTONE N="14"/> And found in the temple them that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and 
the changers of money sitting. <MILESTONE N="15"/> And having made a scourge of rushes, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the

<MILESTONE N="22"/> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which 
Jesus had said. <MILESTONE N="23"/> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name, beholding the miracles which he did. 
<MILESTONE N="24"/> But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because

<P>When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pha∣risees had heard, Jesus maketh and baptizeth more 
disciples than John <MILESTONE N="2"/> (Tho' Jesus himself baptized 
not; but his disciples) <MILESTONE N="3"/> He left Judea, and de∣parted 
again into Galilee. <MILESTONE N="4"/> And he must needs go 
thro' Samaria. <MILESTONE N="5"/> Then cometh he to a city of Sa∣maria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave 
to his son Joseph. <MILESTONE N="6"/> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with the journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
<MILESTONE N="7"/> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. 
Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink. <MILESTONE N="8"/> (For his 
disciples were gone to the city to buy meat. <MILESTONE N="9"/> ) Then saith the Samaritan woman to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews have no dealings with the 
Samaritans. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee
<PB N="336" REF="023976_0335_0FC2CB78DFAB4CC0"/>living water? The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: 
whence then hast thou that living water? <MILESTONE N="12"/> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank thereof, and his chil∣dren, 
and his cattle? <MILESTONE N="13"/> Jesus answered and said to her, Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst 
again. <MILESTONE N="14"/> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, will never thirst, but the water that I shall give him, will become in him a foun∣tain of water, springing up into everlasting life. 
<MILESTONE N="15"/> The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, 
that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. <MILESTONE N="16"/> Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hi∣ther. The woman answered and said, I have no 
husband. <MILESTONE N="17"/> Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, 
I have no husband; <MILESTONE N="18"/> For thou hast had five hus∣bands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy hus∣band: 
this thou saidst truly. <MILESTONE N="19"/> The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain: but ye
<PB N="337" REF="023976_0336_0FC2CB7F8AC654D0"/>say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men 
ought to worship. <MILESTONE N="21"/> Jesus saith to her, Woman, be∣lieve me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem, worship the 
Father. <MILESTONE N="22"/> Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is from the Jews. 
<MILESTONE N="23"/> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor∣shippers shall worship the Father in spirit and <HI>in</HI> truth; 
for the Father seeketh such to worship him. <MILESTONE N="24"/> God <HI>is</HI> a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship in 
spirit and <HI>in</HI> truth. <MILESTONE N="25"/> The woman saith to him, I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ:
<PB N="338" REF="023976_0337_0FC2CB8065B81CD8"/>
when he is come, he will tell us all things. <MILESTONE N="26"/> Jesus 
saith to her, I that speak to thee am <HI>He.</HI> <MILESTONE N="27"/> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman. Yet none said, What seekest thou? Or, Why talkest thou with her?</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28"/> The woman then left her water-pot, and went 
to the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did: <MILESTONE N="29"/> Is not this 
the Christ? <MILESTONE N="30"/> Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31"/> In the mean time his disciples prayed him, saying, 
Master, eat. <MILESTONE N="32"/> But he said to them, I have meat to 
eat that ye know not of. <MILESTONE N="33"/> The disciples said one to 
another, Hath any man brought him to eat? <MILESTONE N="34"/> Jesus saith to them, My meat is, to do the will of him that 
sent me, and to finish his work. <MILESTONE N="35"/> Say ye not, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields,
<PB N="339" REF="023976_0338_0FC2CB84528CB010"/>
for they are white already to the harvest, <MILESTONE N="36"/> And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reap∣eth 
may rejoice together. <MILESTONE N="37"/> And herein is the saying 
true, One soweth, and another reapeth. <MILESTONE N="38"/> I have sent you to reap that whereon you have bestowed no la∣bour: others have laboured, and ye are entered in∣to their labour.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="39"/> And many of the Samaritans out of the city be∣lieved on him, for the saying of the woman testifying, 
He told me all that ever I did. <MILESTONE N="40"/> So when the Samaritans were come to him, they besought him to 
tarry with them. <MILESTONE N="41"/> And he abode there two days. 
<MILESTONE N="42"/> And many more believed, because of his word, And said to the wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, We no longer believe, because of thy saying: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="43"/> After the two days, he departed thence, and went 
into Galilee. <MILESTONE N="44"/> (Now Jesus himself had testified,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 57.</NOTE> That 
a prophet hath not honour in his own country. <MILESTONE N="45"/> ) And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans receiv∣ed him, having seen all the things that he did in Je∣rusalem at the feast. For they also had come to the feast.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="46"/> So he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain 
nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. <MILESTONE N="47"/> When
<PB N="340" REF="023976_0339_0FC2CB88B59018E0"/>he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him to come down and 
heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <MILESTONE N="48"/> Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will 
in no wise believe. <MILESTONE N="49"/> The nobleman said to him, Sir 
come down, ere my child die. <MILESTONE N="50"/> Jesus said to him, Go; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that 
Jesus spake to him, and he went. <MILESTONE N="51"/> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <HI>him,</HI> saying, 
Thy son liveth. <MILESTONE N="52"/> Then he asked of them the hour when he amended. And they said to him, Yesterday 
at the seventh hour the fever left him. <MILESTONE N="53"/> So the father knew <HI>it was</HI> at the same hour, in which Jesus had said to him, Thy son liveth. And himself believed, 
and his whole house. <MILESTONE N="54"/> This second miracle again Jesus wrought, being come out of Judea into Galilee.</P>

<P>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus 
went up to Jerusalem. <MILESTONE N="2"/> Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-gate, a bath, which is called in the Hebrew 
tongue, Bethesda, having five porticos. <MILESTONE N="3"/> In these lay a great multitude of diseased, of blind, halt, withered, 
waiting for the moving of the water. <MILESTONE N="4"/> For an angel went down at certain times into the bath, and the water was troubled: and whosoever went in first, after the troubling of the water, was made whole, whatsoever dis∣ease 
he had. <MILESTONE N="5"/> And a certain man was there, who had 
been diseased eight and thirty year. <MILESTONE N="6"/> Jesus seeing him
<PB N="341" REF="023976_0340_0FC2CB8F6A881790"/>lie, and knowing that he had now been diseased a long time, saith to him, Desirest thou to be made whole? 
<MILESTONE N="7"/> The infirm man answered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the bath, when the water is troubled; and the while I am coming, another steppeth down 
before me. <MILESTONE N="8"/> Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed 
and walk. <MILESTONE N="9"/> And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked: and the same day 
was the sabbath. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Then said the Jews to him that was healed, It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee 
to take up thy bed. <MILESTONE N="11"/> He answered, He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed and walk. 
<MILESTONE N="12"/> Then asked they him, Who is the man that said to 
thee, Take up thy bed and walk? <MILESTONE N="13"/> And he that was healed knew not who he was; for Jesus had retired, 
a multitude being in the place. <MILESTONE N="14"/> Afterwards Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Lo, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come 
to thee. <MILESTONE N="15"/> The man departed and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16"/> And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, because 
he had done these things on the sabbath. <MILESTONE N="17"/> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh until now, and
<PB N="342" REF="023976_0341_0FC2CB90F17C7CD0"/>
I work. <MILESTONE N="18"/> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making him∣self 
equal with God. <MILESTONE N="19"/> Then answered Jesus and said to them, Verily verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; but what things soever he doth, 
these also doth the Son likewise. <MILESTONE N="20"/> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all Things that himself doth: And he will shew him greater works 
than these, so that ye will marvel. <MILESTONE N="21"/> For as the Father quickeneth the dead, so the Son also quick∣eneth 
whom he will. <MILESTONE N="22"/> For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the
<PB N="343" REF="023976_0342_0FC2CB94AD052580"/>Son: That all men may honour the Son, even 
as they honour the Father. <MILESTONE N="23"/> He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent 
him. <MILESTONE N="24"/> Verily, verily I say unto you, he that hear∣eth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condem∣nation, 
but is passed from death to life. <MILESTONE N="25"/> Verily, verily I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the Voice of the Son 
of God, and they that hear shall live. <MILESTONE N="26"/> For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the 
<MILESTONE N="27"/> Son also to have life in himself, And hath given him authority to execute judgment likewise, be∣cause 
he is the Son of man. <MILESTONE N="28"/> Marvel not at this: for the time is coming in which all that are in the 
graves shall hear his voice, <MILESTONE N="29"/> And shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of 
damnation. <MILESTONE N="30"/> I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that
<PB N="344" REF="023976_0343_0FC2CB96334394B8"/>
sent me. <MILESTONE N="31"/> If I testify of myself, my testimony is 
not valid. <MILESTONE N="32"/> There is another that testifieth of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifieth of me is valid.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="33"/> Ye sent to John, and he bare testimony to the 
truth. <MILESTONE N="34"/> But I receive not testimony from man; but 
these things I say, that ye may be saved. <MILESTONE N="35"/> He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were 
willing for a Season to rejoice in his light. <MILESTONE N="36"/> But I have a greater testimony than <HI>that</HI> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to fulfil, the very works that I do, testify of me, that the 
Father hath sent me. <MILESTONE N="37"/> And the Father who hath sent me, he hath testified of me: ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. 
<MILESTONE N="38"/> And ye have not his word abiding in you; for 
whom he hath sent, ye believe not. <MILESTONE N="39"/> Search the Scriptures: in them ye are assured ye have eternal 
life: and it is they that testify of me. <MILESTONE N="40"/> Yet ye will 
not come to me, that ye may have life. <MILESTONE N="41"/> I re∣ceive
<PB N="345" REF="023976_0344_0FC2CB9D38105F08"/>not honour from men, But I know you, that 
ye have not the love of God in you. <MILESTONE N="42"/> For I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: 
<MILESTONE N="43"/> If another shall come in his own name, him ye will 
receive. <MILESTONE N="44"/> How can ye believe, while ye receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour 
that is from God only? <MILESTONE N="45"/> Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth 
you, <HI>even</HI> Moses, in whom ye trust. <MILESTONE N="46"/> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for 
he wrote of me. <MILESTONE N="47"/> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</P>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xiv. 13. <HI>Mark</HI> vi. 32. <HI>Luke</HI> ix. 10.</NOTE> After these things, Jesus went over the sea of 
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Galilee, <HI>the sea</HI> of Tiberias, And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the miracles 
which he did on the diseased. <MILESTONE N="3"/> But Jesus went up into the Mountain, and sat there with his Disciples. 
<MILESTONE N="4"/> And the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 
<MILESTONE N="5"/> Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence 
shall we buy bread, that these may eat? <MILESTONE N="6"/> (But this he said trying him: for he himself knew what he 
intended to do. <MILESTONE N="7"/> ) Philip answered him, Two hun∣dred penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them,
<PB N="346" REF="023976_0345_0FC2CB9E640F0C70"/>
that each of them may take a little. <MILESTONE N="8"/> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to 
him, <MILESTONE N="9"/> Here is a lad, who hath five barley-loaves and two small fishes: but what are they among so 
many? Jesus said, Make the men sit down. <MILESTONE N="10"/> (Now there was much grass in the place) So the men sat 
down, in number about five thousand. <MILESTONE N="11"/> Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, di∣stributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down, and likewise of the fishes as 
much as they would. <MILESTONE N="12"/> When they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments 
which remain, that nothing be lost. <MILESTONE N="13"/> They there∣fore gathered <HI>them,</HI> and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which re∣mained over and above to them that had eaten. 
<MILESTONE N="14"/> Then those men having seen the miracle which Jesus did, said, Of a truth this is the prophet that 
was to come into the world. <MILESTONE N="15"/> Jesus therefore knowing, that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, again retired to the mountain all alone.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xiv. 22. <HI>Mark</HI> vi. 45.</NOTE> In the evening, his disciples went down to the sea, And entering into the vessel, they went 
over the sea toward Capernaum: <MILESTONE N="17"/> And it was now 
dark, and Jesus was not come to them. <MILESTONE N="18"/> And the 
sea ran high, a great wind blowing. <MILESTONE N="19"/> And hav∣ing rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing 
night to the vessel: and they were afraid. <MILESTONE N="20"/> But he 
saith to them, It is I; be not afraid. <MILESTONE N="21"/> Then they willingly received him into the vessel; and im∣mediately the vessel was at the land to which they were bound.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22"/> The day following, the multitude who had stood on the other side of the sea, because they
<PB N="347" REF="023976_0346_0FC2CBA340E1A1B8"/>saw there was no other vessel there, save that one into which his disciples went, and that Jesus went not into the vessel with his disciples, but <HI>that</HI> his 
disciples were gone away alone: <MILESTONE N="23"/> (But there came other little vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had 
given thanks) <MILESTONE N="24"/> When they saw, that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also went aboard the vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="25"/> And having sound him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou 
hither? <MILESTONE N="26"/> Jesus answered them and said, Verily Verily I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the 
loaves, and were satisfied. <MILESTONE N="27"/> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give 
you; for him hath God the Father sealed. <MILESTONE N="28"/> Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may 
work the works of God? <MILESTONE N="29"/> Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe 
on him whom he hath sent. <MILESTONE N="30"/> They said therefore to him, What sign dost thou then, that we may see and believe thee? What dost thou work?
<PB N="348" REF="023976_0347_0FC2CBADD5D3A580"/>
<MILESTONE N="31"/> Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness, as it is written,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxxviii. 24.</NOTE> He gave them bread from heaven to 
eat. <MILESTONE N="32"/> Then said Jesus to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread 
from heaven. <MILESTONE N="33"/> For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the 
world. <MILESTONE N="34"/> Then said they to him, Lord, ever give 
us this bread. <MILESTONE N="35"/> And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never 
thirst. <MILESTONE N="36"/> But I told you, that tho' ye have seen me, 
ye believe not. <MILESTONE N="37"/> All that the Father giveth me, will come to me, and him that cometh to me, I 
will in no wise cast out. <MILESTONE N="38"/> For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of 
him that sent me. <MILESTONE N="39"/> And this is the will of him that sent me, That of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the 
last day. <MILESTONE N="40"/> And this is the will of him that sent me,
<PB N="349" REF="023976_0348_0FC2CBB208AF6B50"/>that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="41"/> The Jews then murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from 
heaven. <MILESTONE N="42"/> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came down from heaven? 
<MILESTONE N="43"/> Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not 
among yourselves. <MILESTONE N="44"/> No man can come unto me, unless the Father who hath sent me, draw him; 
and I will raise him up at the last day. <MILESTONE N="45"/> It is writ∣ten in the prophets,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> liv. 13.</NOTE> And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and 
learned of the Father cometh to me. <MILESTONE N="46"/> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is 
from God; he hath seen the Father. <MILESTONE N="47"/> Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me 
hath everlasting life. <MILESTONE N="48"/> I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and 
<HI>yet</HI> died. <MILESTONE N="49"/> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not 
die. <MILESTONE N="50"/> I am the living bread which came down 
from heaven: <MILESTONE N="51"/> If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and the bread that I will
<PB N="350" REF="023976_0349_0FC2CBB496409C08"/>give, is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="52"/> The Jews then debated among themselves, say∣ing, How can this man give us <HI>his</HI> flesh to eat? But 
<MILESTONE N="53"/> Jesus said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, un∣less ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink 
his blood, ye have no life in you. <MILESTONE N="54"/> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, 
and I will raise him up at the last day. <MILESTONE N="55"/> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
<MILESTONE N="56"/> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, 
abideth in me, and I in him. <MILESTONE N="57"/> As the living Fa∣ther hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. 
<MILESTONE N="58"/> This is the bread which came down from Heaven; not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he that eateth 
of this bread, shall live for ever. <MILESTONE N="59"/> These things he said in the synagogue, teaching at Capernaum.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="60"/> Many of his disciples hearing <HI>it,</HI> said, This is 
an hard saying: who can hear it? <MILESTONE N="61"/> Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured about this, 
said to them, Doth this offend you? <MILESTONE N="62"/> <HI>What</HI> if ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was
<PB N="351" REF="023976_0350_0FC2CBBCB7CB1C90"/>
before? <MILESTONE N="63"/> It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken, 
<HI>they</HI> are spirit and <HI>they</HI> are life. <MILESTONE N="64"/> But there are some of you who believe not. (For Jesus had known from the beginning, who they were that believed 
not, and who would betray him. <MILESTONE N="65"/> ) And he said, Therefore said I to you, That no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="66"/> From this <HI>time</HI> many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus 
to the twelve, <MILESTONE N="67"/> Are ye also minded to go away? 
Then Simon Peter answered him, saying, Lord, to whom shall we go? <MILESTONE N="68"/> Thou hast the words of 
eternal life. <MILESTONE N="69"/> And we have believed and known, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 
<MILESTONE N="70"/> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve? 
Yet one of you is a devil. <MILESTONE N="71"/> He spake of Judas Iscar∣iot, <HI>the son</HI> of Simon; for he it was that would be∣tray him, being one of the twelve.</P>

<P>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews 
sought to kill him. <MILESTONE N="2"/> Now the Jews' feast of ta∣bernacles 
was nigh. <MILESTONE N="3"/> His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples <HI>there</HI> also may see the works which thou 
dost. <MILESTONE N="4"/> For no man doth any thing in secret, but desireth to be publickly known: if thou dost these things, shew thyself to the world. (For neither 
did his brethren believe on him. <MILESTONE N="5"/> ) Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come: your time is al∣ways 
ways ready. <MILESTONE N="6"/> The world cannot hate you, but me 
it hateth; because I testify of it, that its works are evil. <MILESTONE N="7"/> Go ye up to the feast; I go not up to this 
feast yet; <MILESTONE N="8"/> because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y time is not yet fully come. 
<MILESTONE N="9"/> Having said these things to them, he abode in Galilee.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> But when his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it 
were privately. <MILESTONE N="11"/> Then the Jews sought him at the 
feast, and said, Where is he? <MILESTONE N="12"/> And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him: for some said, He is a good man, others
<PB N="353" REF="023976_0352_0FC2CBC26638B6B8"/>
said, Nay; but he seduceth the people. <MILESTONE N="13"/> Howe∣ver, no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14"/> Now at the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. And the Jews mar∣velled, 
<MILESTONE N="15"/> saying, How doth this man know letters, 
having never learned? <MILESTONE N="16"/> Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent 
me. <MILESTONE N="17"/> If any man be willing to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, 
or whether I speak of myself. <MILESTONE N="18"/> He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory; but he that seek∣eth the glory of him that sent him, the same is 
true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. <MILESTONE N="19"/> Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you 
keepeth the law. <MILESTONE N="20"/> Why seek ye to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil. 
Who seeketh to kill thee? <MILESTONE N="21"/> Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel at it.

healed a man on the sabbath? <MILESTONE N="24"/> Judge not accor∣ding to appearance, but judge righteous judg∣ment.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="25"/> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? And lo he speak∣eth

rulers know indeed, that this is the Christ? <MILESTONE N="27"/> How∣beit, we know this man, whence he is: but when Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is: 
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, say∣ing, Do ye both know me, and know whence I am? <MILESTONE N="28"/> And yet I am not come of myself, but he 
that sent me is true, whom ye know not. <MILESTONE N="29"/> But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent 
me. <MILESTONE N="30"/> Then they sought to seize him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet 
come. <MILESTONE N="31"/> And many of the multitude believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do 
more miracles than these which this man hath done? <MILESTONE N="32"/> The Pharisees heard the multitude whis∣pering
<PB N="355" REF="023976_0354_0FC2CBC591E2EB20"/>such things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize 
him. <MILESTONE N="33"/> Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time I am with you, and <HI>then</HI> I go to him that sent me. 
<MILESTONE N="34"/> Ye shall seek, and shall not find me, and where I am 
ye cannot come. <MILESTONE N="35"/> Then said the Jews among them∣selves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the 
Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <MILESTONE N="36"/> What saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <HI>me?</HI> And where I am, ye cannot come?</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="37"/> On the last, the great <HI>day</HI> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let

<P><MILESTONE N="21"/> Then said Jesus again to them, I go, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin. 
Whither I go ye cannot come. <MILESTONE N="22"/> The Jews said therefore, Will he kill himself? Because he saith, 
Whither I go, ye cannot come. <MILESTONE N="23"/> And he said to them, Ye are of them that are beneath; I am of them that are above: ye are of this world; I am

shall die in your sins. <MILESTONE N="25"/> Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even

things which I have heard from him. <MILESTONE N="27"/> They un∣derstood not, that he spake to them of the Father. 
<MILESTONE N="28"/> Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I AM, and <HI>that</HI> I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. 
<MILESTONE N="29"/> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that 
please him. <MILESTONE N="30"/> As he spake these words, many be∣lieved on him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31"/> Then said Jesus to the Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my 
disciples indeed: <MILESTONE N="32"/> And ye shall know the truth, 
and the truth shall make you free. <MILESTONE N="33"/> They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never enslaved to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall
<PB N="361" REF="023976_0360_0FC2CBE756B51858"/>
be made free. <MILESTONE N="34"/> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily I say unto you, he that committeth sin, is the slave of 
sin: <MILESTONE N="35"/> And the slave abideth not in the house for ever: 
<HI>but</HI> the Son abideth ever. <MILESTONE N="36"/> If therefore the Son shall 
make you free, ye will be free indeed. <MILESTONE N="37"/> I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; yet ye seek to kill me, 
because my word hath no place in you. <MILESTONE N="38"/> I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do 
that which ye have heard from your father. <MILESTONE N="39"/> They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were the children of 
Abraham ye would do the works of Abraham. <MILESTONE N="40"/> But now ye seek to kill me, a man who have told you 
the truth which I have heard from God. <MILESTONE N="41"/> Abra∣ham did not thus. Ye do the deeds of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornicati∣on; 
on; we have one Father, <HI>even</HI> God. <MILESTONE N="42"/> Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth, and come from God. 
I am come not of myself, but He hath sent me. <MILESTONE N="43"/> Why do ye not understand my discourse? <HI>Even</HI> 
because ye cannot hear my word. <MILESTONE N="44"/> Ye are of <HI>your</HI>
<PB N="362" REF="023976_0361_0FC2CBE8AA42F458"/>father the devil, and your will is, to do the de∣sires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth; for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the 
father of it. <MILESTONE N="45"/> But because I speak the truth, ye 
believe me not. <MILESTONE N="46"/> Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not be∣lieve 
me? <MILESTONE N="47"/> He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye therefore hear <HI>them</HI> not, because ye are 
not of God. <MILESTONE N="48"/> Then answered the Jews and said to him, Say we not well, That thou art a Samaritan, 
and hast a devil? <MILESTONE N="49"/> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. 
<MILESTONE N="50"/> I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeketh 
<HI>it</HI> and judgeth. <MILESTONE N="51"/> Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my word, he shall never see death. 
Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. <MILESTONE N="52"/> Abraham is dead and the pro∣phets; yet thou sayest, If a man keep my word, 
he shall never taste of death. <MILESTONE N="53"/> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? The pro∣phets

also are dead. <MILESTONE N="54"/> Whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of 
whom ye say, He is our God. <MILESTONE N="55"/> Yet ye have not known him: but I know him. And if I should say I know him not, I should be a liar like you; 
but I know him, and keep his word. <MILESTONE N="56"/> Your father Abraham longed to see my day; and he saw

when no man can work. <MILESTONE N="4"/> While I am in the

me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. <MILESTONE N="12"/> And I went, and washed, and received sight. Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13"/> They bring to the Pharisees the man who had 
aforetime been blind. <MILESTONE N="14"/> (It was the sabbath, when 
Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. <MILESTONE N="15"/> ) Again the Pharisees also asked him, How he had received his sight? He said to them, He put clay on my 
eyes, and I washed, and see. <MILESTONE N="16"/> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, be∣cause he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? 
And there was a division among them. <MILESTONE N="17"/> They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, for that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, 
He is a prophet. <MILESTONE N="18"/> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and re∣ceived his sight, till they had called the parents of 
him who had received his sight. <MILESTONE N="19"/> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was 
born blind? <MILESTONE N="20"/> How then doth he now see? His pa∣rents answered them, and said, We know that this 
is our son, and that he was born blind. <MILESTONE N="21"/> But how
<PB N="366" REF="023976_0365_0FC2CBFC27EFB588"/>he now seeth, we know not, or who hath opened his eyes we know not. He is of age: ask him; 
he will speak concerning himself. <MILESTONE N="22"/> His parents said this because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, That if any man should own him <HI>to be</HI> Christ, he should be put out of the syna∣gogue. 
<MILESTONE N="23"/> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="24"/> Therefore they called a second time the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to 
God; we know that this man is a sinner. <MILESTONE N="25"/> He an∣swered and said, that he is a sinner I know not: one thing I know, that I was blind and now see. 
<MILESTONE N="26"/> They said to him again, What did he to thee? 
How opened he thine eyes? <MILESTONE N="27"/> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hearken: why would ye hear <HI>it</HI> again? Are ye also willing 
to be his disciples? <MILESTONE N="28"/> Then they reviled him and said, Thou art a disciple of that <HI>fellow;</HI> but we 
are disciples of Moses. <MILESTONE N="29"/> We know that God spake to Moses: but we know not this <HI>fellow,</HI> whence 
he is. <MILESTONE N="30"/> The man answered and said to them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not 
whence he is; altho' he hath opened my eyes! <MILESTONE N="31"/> We know that God heareth not sinners; but if a man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he

could do nothing. <MILESTONE N="34"/> They answered and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="35"/> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and hav∣ing found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe 
on the Son of God? <MILESTONE N="36"/> He answered and said, Sir, 
who is he, that I may believe on him? <MILESTONE N="37"/> Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that 
talketh with thee is he. <MILESTONE N="38"/> And he said, Lord, I be∣lieve. 
And he worshipped him. <MILESTONE N="39"/> Jesus said, For judgment am I come into the world, that they who see not may see, and that they who see may become

<P>Verily, verily I say to you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.
<PB N="368" REF="023976_0367_0FC2CC095B8F05F0"/>
<MILESTONE N="2"/> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd 
of the sheep. <MILESTONE N="3"/> To him the door-keeper openeth, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his 
own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. <MILESTONE N="4"/> And when he hath led forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they 
know his voice. <MILESTONE N="5"/> They will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they know not the 
voice of strangers. <MILESTONE N="6"/> This parable spake Jesus to them; but they understood not what things they were which he spake to them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/> Therefore Jesus said to them again, Verily, verily I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
<MILESTONE N="8"/> Whosoever are come, are thieves and robbers; but
<PB N="369" REF="023976_0368_0FC2CC0D68D6DD50"/>
the sheep did not hear them. <MILESTONE N="9"/> I am the door; if any one enter in by me, he shall be safe, and shall 
go in and out, and find pasture. <MILESTONE N="10"/> The thief cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come, that they may have life, and that they may 
have it abundantly: <MILESTONE N="11"/> I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. 
<MILESTONE N="12"/> But the hireling, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: so the wolf 
seizeth them, and scattereth the sheep. <MILESTONE N="13"/> The hire∣ling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth 
not for the sheep. <MILESTONE N="14"/> I am the good shepherd, and
<PB N="370" REF="023976_0369_0FC2CC1158410F88"/>
know my <HI>sheep,</HI> and am known of mine; <MILESTONE N="15"/> (As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father) and I 
lay down my life for the sheep. <MILESTONE N="16"/> I have also other, sheep which are not of this fold: I must bring them likewise, and they will hear my voice, and there 
shall be one flock, <HI>and</HI> one shepherd. <MILESTONE N="17"/> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my 
life, that I may take it again. <MILESTONE N="18"/> No one taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commission have I received of my Fa∣ther. 
<MILESTONE N="19"/> There was again a division amongst the 
Jews because of these sayings. <MILESTONE N="20"/> Many of them said. He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear ye him? Others said, These are not the words of one that
<PB N="371" REF="023976_0370_0FC2CC12A919AEC8"/>
hath a devil. <MILESTONE N="21"/> Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22"/> Now the feast of the dedication came on at Je∣rusalem: 
and it was winter. <MILESTONE N="23"/> And Jesus was walk∣ing 
in the temple, in Solomon's portico. <MILESTONE N="24"/> Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, how long dost thou keep us in suspence? If thou 
be the Christ, tell us plainly. <MILESTONE N="25"/> Jesus answered them, I have told you; yet ye do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, they testify of me. 
<MILESTONE N="26"/> But, as I have told you, ye do not believe, because 
ye are not of my sheep. <MILESTONE N="27"/> My sheep hear my voice, 
and I know them, and they follow me. <MILESTONE N="28"/> And I give them eternal life, and they shall never porish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. 
<MILESTONE N="29"/> My Father, who gave <HI>them</HI> me, is greater than all;
<PB N="372" REF="023976_0371_0FC2CC19F943CA40"/>and none shall pluck <HI>them</HI> out of my Father's hand.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/> I and the Father are one.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31"/> Then the Jews again took up stones to stone 
him. <MILESTONE N="32"/> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of 
those works do ye stone me? <MILESTONE N="33"/> The Jews answered him, We stone thee not for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because thou being a man, 
makest thyself God. <MILESTONE N="34"/> Jesus answered them, Is it 
not written in our law, <MILESTONE N="35"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxxxii. 6.</NOTE> I said ye are Gods? If he call them gods, to whom the word of God came 
<MILESTONE N="36"/> (and the scripture cannot be broken) Say ye of him whom God hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the 
Son of God? <MILESTONE N="37"/> If I do not the works of my Father, 
believe me not. <MILESTONE N="38"/> But if I do, tho' ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe, that the Father <HI>is</HI> in me, and I in him. 
<MILESTONE N="39"/> Therefore they sought again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hands.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/> And he went away again beyond Jordan, to
<PB N="373" REF="023976_0372_0FC2CC1AFA7DB970"/>the place where John baptized at first, and there he 
abode. <MILESTONE N="41"/> And many came to him and said, John did no Miracle: but all things that John spake of 
this man were true. <MILESTONE N="42"/> And many believed on him there.</P>

<P>Now one Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of

Lazarus was sick. <MILESTONE N="3"/> ) Therefore <HI>his</HI> Sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold he whom thou lovest is 
sick. <MILESTONE N="4"/> Jesus hearing <HI>it,</HI> said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of 
God may be glorified thereby. <MILESTONE N="5"/> Now Jesus loved 
Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <MILESTONE N="6"/> So after he had heard that he was sick, he abode still two days 
in the place where he was. <MILESTONE N="7"/> Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again. 
<MILESTONE N="8"/> The disciples say to him, Master, the Jews but now sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither 
again? <MILESTONE N="9"/> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stum∣bleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</P>
<PB N="374" REF="023976_0373_0FC2CC1C66D63708"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> But if any man walk in the night, he stumbleth, 
because the light is not in him. <MILESTONE N="11"/> Thus he spake, and after that he saith to them, Our friend 
Lazarus sleepeth; but I go to awake him. <MILESTONE N="12"/> Then the disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will recover. 
<MILESTONE N="13"/> Jesus spake of his death; but they thought he had 
spoken of the natural rest in sleep. <MILESTONE N="14"/> Then said Jesus 
to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <MILESTONE N="15"/> And I am glad for your sake I was not there, that ye may believe: 
but let us go to him. <MILESTONE N="16"/> Then said Thomas called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17"/> When Jesus came, he found he had been now 
four days in the tomb. <MILESTONE N="18"/> (Now Bethany was near 
Jerusalem, about fifteen Furlongs off. <MILESTONE N="19"/> ) And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to 
comfort them concerning their brother. <MILESTONE N="20"/> When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and 
met him; but Mary sat in the house. <MILESTONE N="21"/> Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my 
brother had not died. <MILESTONE N="22"/> But I know even now, that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give <HI>it</HI> 
thee. <MILESTONE N="23"/> Jesus saith to her, thy brother shall rise 
again. <MILESTONE N="24"/> Martha said to him, I know that he shall
<PB N="375" REF="023976_0374_0FC2CC204B6E50B8"/>rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
<MILESTONE N="25"/> Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he 
die, yet shall he live; <MILESTONE N="26"/> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. 
Believest thou this? <MILESTONE N="27"/> She saith to him, Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who 
was to come into the world. <MILESTONE N="28"/> Having said this she went and privately called Mary her sister, saying, 
the Master is come, and calleth for thee. <MILESTONE N="29"/> As soon as she heard <HI>it</HI> she arose quickly and came to 
him. <MILESTONE N="30"/> Jesus was not yet come into the town, but 
was at the place where Martha had met him. <MILESTONE N="31"/> The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforted her, seeing Mary, that she arose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She 
is going to the tomb, to weep there. <MILESTONE N="32"/> When Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst 
been here, my brother had not died. <MILESTONE N="33"/> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned deeply, 
and troubled himself, <MILESTONE N="34"/> And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
<MILESTONE N="35"/> Jesus wept. 
<MILESTONE N="36"/> Then said the Jews, Behold, how he 
loved him! <MILESTONE N="37"/> And some of them said, Could not this person who opened the eyes of the blind, have even caused that this man should not have died?
<PB N="376" REF="023976_0375_0FC2CC225A79F058"/>
<MILESTONE N="38"/> Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the 
tomb. <MILESTONE N="39"/> It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Je∣sus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith to him, Lord, by this time 
he stinketh; for he hath been <HI>buried</HI> four days. <MILESTONE N="40"/> Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Then they took away the stone <HI>from</HI> where the dead lay. 
<MILESTONE N="41"/> And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I

<P><MILESTONE N="45"/> Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary, and had seen the things, which Jesus had

come and subvert both our place and nation. <MILESTONE N="49"/> And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high-priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing, 
<MILESTONE N="50"/> Nor consider, it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation 
perish not. <MILESTONE N="51"/> He spake not this of himself, but be∣ing high-priest that year, he prophesied, that Jesus 
should die for the nation: <MILESTONE N="52"/> And not for that nation only, but that he might also gather into one all the 
children of God that were scattered abroad. <MILESTONE N="53"/> There∣fore
<PB N="378" REF="023976_0377_0FC2CC32D4333FD8"/>from that day, they consulted together to put him to death.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="54"/> Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country, near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there 
continued with his disciples. <MILESTONE N="55"/> And the passover of the Jews was nigh; and many went up to Jerusalem, 
to purify themselves. <MILESTONE N="56"/> Then sought they for Jesus, and said one to another, standing in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast? 
<MILESTONE N="57"/> Now both the chief priests and Pharisees had given order, That if any man know where he was, he should shew <HI>it,</HI> that they might apprehend him.</P>

<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<P>Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead. 
<MILESTONE N="2"/> There they made him a supper, and Martha serv∣ed; but Lazarus was one of them who sat at table 
with him. <MILESTONE N="3"/> Then Mary, taking a pound of oint∣ment, of very costly spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the oint∣ment. 
<MILESTONE N="4"/> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, 
who was about to betray him, saith, <MILESTONE N="5"/> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, 
and given to the poor? <MILESTONE N="6"/> This he said, not because
<PB N="379" REF="023976_0378_0FC2CC35EC899C80"/>he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the purse, and bare what was put therein.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/> Then Jesus said, Let her alone; against the day 
of my burial hath she kept this. <MILESTONE N="8"/> Ye have the poor always with you: but me ye have not al∣ways.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9"/> Now much people of the Jews knew that he was there, and came not only for the sake of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from 
the dead. <MILESTONE N="10"/> But the chief priests consulted, how 
to kill Lazarus also. <MILESTONE N="11"/> Because on his account many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxi. 8. <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 8. <HI>Lake</HI> xix. 36.</NOTE> The next day, a great multitude who were come to the feast, having heard, that Jesus was 
coming to Jerusalem, <MILESTONE N="13"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> cxviii. 26.</NOTE> Took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried, Ho∣sanna: blessed in the name of the Lord <HI>is</HI> he that

cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. <MILESTONE N="16"/> These things his disciples understood not at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered, that these things were written of him, and <HI>that</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="023976_0379_0FC2CC3766FEAA80"/>
they had done these things to him. <MILESTONE N="17"/> And the multitude who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the 
dead, bare witness. <MILESTONE N="18"/> For this cause also the multi∣tude went to meet him, because they heard, he 
had done this miracle. <MILESTONE N="19"/> The Pharisees therefore said to each other, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the world is gone after him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/> Now among those who came up to worship at the feast, there were certain Greeks. 
<MILESTONE N="21"/> These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus. <MILESTONE N="22"/> Philip cometh 
and telleth Andrew; and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. <MILESTONE N="23"/> And Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glo∣rified. 
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Verily, verily I say unto you, Unless a grain of wheat that falleth into the ground die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth

much fruit. <MILESTONE N="25"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> x. 39.</NOTE> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall pre∣serve 
it to life eternal. <MILESTONE N="26"/> If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27"/> Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this 
cause I came, for this hour. <MILESTONE N="28"/> Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have 
both glorified and I will glorify <HI>it</HI> again. <MILESTONE N="29"/> The multitude who stood and heard <HI>it,</HI> said, It thun∣dered; 
others said, An angel spake to him. <MILESTONE N="30"/> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of 
me, but for your sakes. <MILESTONE N="31"/> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world 
be cast out. <MILESTONE N="32"/> And I, when I am lifted up from the
<PB N="382" REF="023976_0381_0FC2CC420F46CFF8"/>earth, will draw all men to me. (He spake this, 
<MILESTONE N="33"/> signifying what death he should die.) The 
multitude answered him, <MILESTONE N="34"/> We have heard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> cx. 4.</NOTE> out of the law, that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? 
Who is this Son of man? Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. <MILESTONE N="35"/> Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness over∣take you; for he that walketh in darkness, knoweth 
not whither he goeth. <MILESTONE N="36"/> While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become children of light. These things spake Jesus, and retiring concealed himself from them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="37"/> But tho' he had done so many miracles before 
them, <HI>yet</HI> they believed not on him; <MILESTONE N="38"/> So that the word of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled which he said,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> liii. 1.</NOTE> Lord, who hath believed our report? 
And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been re∣vealed? <MILESTONE N="39"/> Therefore they could not believe, accord∣ing 
to what Isaiah said again. <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> vi. 10. <HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 14. <HI>Acts</HI> xxviii. 26.</NOTE> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with <HI>their</HI> eyes, and understand with

their heart, and be converted, that I might heal them. <MILESTONE N="41"/> These things said Isaiah, when he saw his 
glory, and spake of him. <MILESTONE N="42"/> Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed on him but they did not con∣fess <HI>him,</HI> because of the Pharisees, lest they should 
be put out of the synagogue. <MILESTONE N="43"/> For they loved the praise of man more than the praise of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="44"/> Jesus said with a loud voice, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent 
me. <MILESTONE N="45"/> And he that eth seeth me, seeth him that sent me. 
<MILESTONE N="46"/> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, may not continue in darkness. 
<MILESTONE N="47"/> If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I am not come to judge the 
world, but to save the world. <MILESTONE N="48"/> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word which I have spoken, that 
shall judge him at the last day. <MILESTONE N="49"/> For I have not spoken of myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and

<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing his hour was come, to pass out of this world, to the Father, having loved his own who
<PB N="384" REF="023976_0383_0FC2CC475DC1F738"/>
were in the world, loved them to the end. <MILESTONE N="2"/> And while they were at supper (the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, <HI>the son</HI> of 
<MILESTONE N="3"/> Simon, to betray him) Jesus knowing the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and going to God, 
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, 
and taking a towel, girded himself. <MILESTONE N="5"/> After that, he poured water into the bason, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe <HI>them</HI> with the 
towel wherewith he was girded. <MILESTONE N="6"/> Then cometh he to Simon Peter, who saith to him, Lord, dost thou 
wash my feet? <MILESTONE N="7"/> Jesus answered and said to him, 
What I do, thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. <MILESTONE N="8"/> Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If 
I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. <MILESTONE N="9"/> Si∣mon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, 
but also <HI>my</HI> hands and <HI>my</HI> head. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Jesus saith to him, He who hath been bathed, needeth only to wash <HI>his</HI> feet, and is clean all over: and ye are clean; 
but not all. <MILESTONE N="11"/> For he knew who would betray him: therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.</P>
<PB N="385" REF="023976_0384_0FC2CC48A00A7BF0"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="12"/> So after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, sitting down again, he said to them, 
Know ye what I have done to you? <MILESTONE N="13"/> Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well; for <HI>so</HI> I am. 
<MILESTONE N="14"/> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's 
feet. <MILESTONE N="15"/> For I have given you an example, that ye also 
may do as I have done to you. <MILESTONE N="16"/> Verily, verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent 
him. <MILESTONE N="17"/> If ye know these things, happy are ye, if 
ye do them. <MILESTONE N="18"/> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen, that the scripture may be fulfilled,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xli. 9.</NOTE> He that eateth bread with me, hath 
lifted up his heel against me. <MILESTONE N="19"/> Now I tell you be∣fore it is done, that when it is done, ye may 
believe that I am <HI>he.</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> x. 40.</NOTE> Verily, verily I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiv∣eth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21"/> Jesus having said this, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily I say unto 
you, one of you will betray me. <MILESTONE N="22"/> Then the disci∣ples 
looked one on another doubting of whom he spake. <MILESTONE N="23"/> Now there was lying in the bosom of Jesus one of the disciples whom Jesus loved. Simon
<PB N="386" REF="023976_0385_0FC2CC4EE80C6D18"/>
<MILESTONE N="24"/> Peter therefore beckoneth to him, to ask who it was 
of whom he spake. <MILESTONE N="25"/> He then, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it? 
Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it. <MILESTONE N="26"/> And having dipped the sop, he giveth it to Judas Iscariot, <HI>the son</HI> of 
Simon. <MILESTONE N="27"/> And after the sop, then Satan entered into 
him. <MILESTONE N="28"/> Then said Jesus to him, What thou dost, do quickly. Now none at the table knew, why 
he said this to him. <MILESTONE N="29"/> But some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of against the feast, or, Give 
something to the poor. <MILESTONE N="30"/> He then having received the sop, went out immediately. And it was night when he went out.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31"/> Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, 
and God is glorified by him. <MILESTONE N="32"/> If God be glorified by him, God will also glorify him with himself,
<PB N="387" REF="023976_0386_0FC2CC54EE4C3028"/>
and will shortly glorify him. <MILESTONE N="33"/> Little children, yet a little while I am with you: ye shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ch. vii. 34.</NOTE> Whither I go ye can∣not 
come, so now I say to you. <MILESTONE N="34"/> A new command∣ment I give you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
<MILESTONE N="35"/> By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, 
if ye have love to one another. <MILESTONE N="36"/> Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus an∣swered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow 
me now; but thou wilt follow me hereafter. <MILESTONE N="37"/> Pe∣ter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee 
now, I will lay down my life for thy sake? <MILESTONE N="38"/> Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily I say to thee, the cock shall not have crowed, till thou hast denied me thrice.</P>

<P>I have told you these things, that ye may not be offended. They will put you out of the syna∣gogues;

<MILESTONE N="3"/> These things will they do, because they have not

with you. <MILESTONE N="5"/> But now I go to him that sent me, and 
none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? <MILESTONE N="6"/> But because I have told you these things, sorrow hath

<PB N="395" REF="023976_0394_0FC2CC735AB05238"/>expedient for you that I go: for if I go not, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart

<P><MILESTONE N="12"/> I have yet many things to say to you; but ye cannot bear them now. But when he, the Spirit

in my name, he will give you. <MILESTONE N="24"/> Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask and ye shall

Father. <MILESTONE N="26"/> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father 
for you. <MILESTONE N="27"/> For the Father himself loveth you, be∣cause ye have loved me, and have believed, that 
I came forth from God. <MILESTONE N="28"/> I came forth from the Father, and am come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29"/> His disciples <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to him, Lo now speakest

and scourged <HI>him.</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"/> And the soldiers having plat∣ted a crown of thorns, put <HI>it</HI> on his head, and 
put on him a purple robe, And said, Hail, king of the Jews. <MILESTONE N="3"/> And they smote him on the cheeks. 
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Pilate went out again, and saith to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know I find 
no fault in him. <MILESTONE N="5"/> Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And 
he saith to them, Behold the man. <MILESTONE N="6"/> But when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him. 
Pilate saith to them, Take ye him and crucify <HI>him;</HI> for I find no fault in him. <MILESTONE N="7"/> The Jews an∣swered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
<MILESTONE N="8"/> When Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, And returned into the palace, and saith to
<PB N="406" REF="023976_0405_0FC2C83FF3412F70"/>
Jesus, Whence art thou? <MILESTONE N="9"/> But Jesus gave him no 
answer. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Then Pilate saith to him, Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release 
thee? <MILESTONE N="11"/> Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power over me, unless it were given thee from a∣bove: therefore he that delivered me to thee, hath 
the greater sin. <MILESTONE N="12"/> Upon this Pilate sought to re∣lease him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend to Cesar. Whesoever maketh himself a king, speaketh a∣gainst 
Cesar. <MILESTONE N="13"/> Pilate hearing this saving, brought Jesus forth, and sat on the judgment seat, is a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha; 
<MILESTONE N="14"/> (It was the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour) And saith to the Jews Behold 
your king. <MILESTONE N="15"/> But they cried out, Away <HI>with him,</HI> away <HI>with him,</HI> crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests an∣swered, 
We have no king but Cesar. <MILESTONE N="16"/> Then de∣livered he him to them, to be crucified.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxvii. 31. <HI>Mark</HI> xv. 22. <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 26.</NOTE> And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bearing his cross, went forth to the place, cal∣led <HI>the place</HI> of a skull, which is called in Hebrew,

Golgotha: <MILESTONE N="18"/> Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side, and Jesus in 
the midst. <MILESTONE N="19"/> And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross: and the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF 
THE JEWS. <MILESTONE N="20"/> Many of the Jews read this inscrip∣tion; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, <HI>and</HI> 
Greek, <HI>and</HI> Latin. <MILESTONE N="21"/> Then said the chief priests to Pilate, Write not, the king of the Jews; but 
that he said, I am the king of the Jews. <MILESTONE N="22"/> Pilate answered, What I have written, I have writ∣ten. 
<MILESTONE N="23"/> And the soldiers, when they had crucifi∣ed Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also <HI>his</HI> vesture: now the vesture was without seam, woven from the top 
throughout. <MILESTONE N="24"/> They said therefore one to another, Let us not rent it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xxii. 18.</NOTE> They parted my garments among them, and cast lots for my vesture. These things therefore the soldiers did.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="25"/> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mo∣ther, and his mother's sister, Mary <HI>the wife</HI> of
<PB N="408" REF="023976_0407_0FC2C847F586F508"/>
Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. <MILESTONE N="26"/> Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, saith to his mother, Woman, be∣hold 
hold thy son. <MILESTONE N="27"/> Then saith he to the disciple, Be∣hold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28"/> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be ful∣filled, 
saith, I thirst. <MILESTONE N="29"/> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And filling a sponge with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxix. 21.</NOTE> vinegar, and putting it on <HI>a stalk of</HI> hyssop, they put it to 
his mouth, When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, <MILESTONE N="30"/> It is finished, and bowing the head, he delivered up <HI>his</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31"/> Now because it was the preparation, lest the bodies should remain upon the cross on the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b∣bath (for that sabbath was a great day) the Jews besought Pilate, that their legs might be broken, 
and they might be taken away. <MILESTONE N="32"/> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the 
other who was crucified with him. <MILESTONE N="33"/> But coming to Jesus, when they saw he was dead already, they 
brake not his legs. <MILESTONE N="34"/> But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and forthwith there came out
<PB N="409" REF="023976_0408_0FC2C84BF2A2B908"/>
blood and water. <MILESTONE N="35"/> And he that saw, hath testified <HI>it,</HI> and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that 
he saith true, that ye also may believe. <MILESTONE N="36"/> For these things were done that the scripture might be ful∣filled, 
<MILESTONE N="37"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 46.</NOTE> A bone of it shall not be broken. And again another scripture saith,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zech.</HI> xii. 10.</NOTE> They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="38"/> And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews) asked Pilate leave to take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came 
therefore and took the body of Jesus. <MILESTONE N="39"/> And Nico∣demus also came (who at first had come to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 
an hundred pounds. <MILESTONE N="40"/> So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
<MILESTONE N="41"/> Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, 
in which no man had ever been laid. <MILESTONE N="42"/> There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the pre∣paration-day of the Jews; for the sepulchre was nigh.</P>

said, Peace <HI>be</HI> unto you. <MILESTONE N="27"/> Then said he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my 
side, and be not faithless, but believing. <MILESTONE N="28"/> And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord, and 
my God. <MILESTONE N="29"/> Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: happy <HI>are</HI> they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</P>
<PB N="413" REF="023976_0412_0FC2C85B616D4428"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/> And Jesus wrought many other miracles also, in the presence of his disciples, which are not 
written in this book. <MILESTONE N="31"/> But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life thro' his name.</P>

<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<P>After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; he 
manifested <HI>himself</HI> thus. <MILESTONE N="2"/> There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Na∣thanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <HI>sons</HI> of Ze∣bedee, 
and two other of his disciples. <MILESTONE N="3"/> Simon Peter saith to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went out and entered into the vessel, but caught nothing that 
night. <MILESTONE N="4"/> When the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it 
was Jesus. <MILESTONE N="5"/> Then Jesus faith to them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 
And he said to them, Cast your net on the right side of the vessel, and ye shall find. <MILESTONE N="6"/> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it, 
for the multitude of fishes. <MILESTONE N="7"/> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter hearing that it was the Lord, girt on his up∣per coat (for he was stript) and threw himself into 
the sea. <MILESTONE N="8"/> And the other disciples came in the vessel
<PB N="414" REF="023976_0413_0FC2C85C56246948"/>(for they were not far from land, about two hun∣dred 
cubits) drawing the net <HI>full</HI> of fishes. <MILESTONE N="9"/> When they came to land they see a fire of coals there, and 
fish laid thereon, and bread. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Jesus saith to them, 
Bring of the fishes which ye have taken now. <MILESTONE N="11"/> Si∣mon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three; and tho' there were so many, the net was 
not broken. <MILESTONE N="12"/> Jesus saith to them, Come ye <HI>and</HI> dine. And none of the disciples presumed to ask him, Who art thou? Knowing that it was the 
Lord. <MILESTONE N="13"/> Jesus then cometh and taketh bread, and 
giveth to them, and fish likewise. <MILESTONE N="14"/> This was the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"/> When they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, <HI>son</HI> of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these <HI>do?</HI> He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou know∣est that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my 
lambs. <MILESTONE N="16"/> He saith to him again, the second time, Simon, <HI>son</HI> of Jonah, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. 
He saith to him, Feed my sheep. <MILESTONE N="17"/> He saith to him the third time, Simon, <HI>son</HI> of Jonah, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep:
<PB N="415" REF="023976_0414_0FC2C8696C93E168"/>
<MILESTONE N="18"/> Verily, verily I say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <HI>thee</HI> whither thou wouldest not. 
This he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. <MILESTONE N="19"/> And having said this, he saith to 
him, Follow me. <MILESTONE N="20"/> Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, 
who is he that betrayeth thee? <MILESTONE N="21"/> Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <HI>shall</HI> this man <HI>do?</HI> 
<MILESTONE N="22"/> Jesus saith to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, 
what <HI>is it</HI> to thee? <MILESTONE N="23"/> Follow thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, That he should not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <HI>is it</HI> to thee?</P>
<PB N="416" REF="023976_0415_0FC2C86B567757C0"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="24"/> This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testi∣mony 
is true. <MILESTONE N="25"/> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were to be written particularly, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that were written.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 20.</LABEL> <HI>Peter turning</HI>—As he was walking after <HI>Christ.

St. <HI>John</HI> stays not for the Call; he rises and follows Him too; but says not one Word of his own Love or Zeal. He chose that the Action only should speak this; and even when he records the Circumstance, he tells us not what that Action meant, but with great Simplicity relates the Fact only. If here and there a generous Heart sees and emulates it, be it so; but he is not solicitous that Men should admire it. It was addressed to his beloved Master, and it was enough that He understood it.</P>
