<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Relation might be acceptable to many of my Readers, being intended impartially as near the Truth as it hath come to my Knowledge. At <HI>Philadelphia</HI> on the third Day of the Second Month 1764. GEORGE the THIRD then happily Reigning. <HI>John Penn,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> Tidings came from the <HI>North</HI> of a great Number of Men, who had assembled them∣selves in Arms, and were actually on their March for the said City, in order to take their Revenge on a Number of poor wretch∣ed Savages, then in the Barracks of said City, under the Protection of the Govern∣ment, however, just their Cause might have been in Pointing out such of them as were actually Murderers (who would have been try'd by Law, and received their Destiny) yet to fly in the Face of Government where∣on very Individual and in short our All de∣pends, must be productive of very danger∣ous and fatal Consequences.</P>
<P>HWOBEIT, <HI>Philadelphia</HI> at this Time prov'd not to be the <HI>Lancaster;</HI> expresses daily and
<PB N="4" REF="009697_0004_0F77860F1E628C98"/>hourly arriving of their nearer Approach, Orders were sent to all the Ferrys on the River <HI>Schuylkil,</HI> to stop them by cutting away the Ropes and sinking their Boats, which greatly impeded their March, and about Four Hundred cross'd the River a∣bout fourteen Miles <HI>North</HI> of the City at a Place call'd the <HI>Swedes Ford.</HI> Upon which being the Second Day of the Week, and the Sixth of the same Month, a Number of the Inhabitants of the City and others appeared under Arms, the Barracks and Streets lin'd with Cannon, and nothing was expected but the doleful Scene of War. Among the rest were the People call'd Friends, prepared with Arms like <HI>Spartans</HI> brave, striding forth with Gigantic Pace to defend their Laws and Liberty, more pre∣cious than Life, let it be Recorded in the An∣als of after Ages in LETTERS of GOLD.</P>
<P>ON the Seventh Day of the same Month an Express arrives, informing that the Ad∣vanced Guard, amounting to near two Hun∣dred Men, had come into <HI>Germantown,</HI> whereon a Council was held, in which it was determined, that they should be met in Order to know their Demands, and why
<PB N="5" REF="009697_0005_0F77860FDFD4C5F0"/>they came Arm'd in such a Manner that they might drop their Intention by being in∣formed of our Strength and Resolution to Defend our Rights to the last.</P>
<P>HOWEVER on the eighth Day of the same they were visited at <HI>Germantown;</HI> where∣upon after some Communication with the Recorder and his Associates; attended by a great Number of the Inhabitants, Gen∣tlemen of the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they were found a selected Band of Gentlemen, Decendants of the Noble <HI>Eniskillers,</HI> who were the great Means of setting that great and never to be forgotten Prince King <HI>William</HI> on the Throne. Their Demands were too reason¦able to be rejected, they were Gentle and easy, not farther then Pointing out to the Government such of these Savages as had been guilty of Murder, and a praying like∣wise that the Government would take notice, and try them by the Laws of the Place ac∣cordingly; they had no Intent in the least to molest Man, Woman or Child. Their Grievance as it is said were yet somewhat farther; they had paid for Lands, paid also their Taxes, serv'd his Majesty, and all were in a Manner taken from them; indeed
<PB N="6" REF="009697_0006_0F778610A1C09060"/>some went so far as to say, that it was given to Savage Indians, who were at this Time rioting in all the Plenty that so great and Fertile a Province could afford; notwith∣standing their Perfideous Outrages, on the Poor back Inhabitants, their Wives and de∣fenceless Children. Their Grievances by Information is at length to be laid before the Honourable Governor, and House of Representatives, and undoubtedly from so just a Constitution will receive the just Merits of their Cause, which we hope in due Time will be made Manifest and openly publish'd.</P>
<P>THESE Things are the Effects of suc∣couring a Savage Nation, who Wolf-like for these many Years have been Murdering and Destroying Poor defenceless People; and all they had thro' out our Frontiers, and when driven to Extremity for want of Cloathing or Victuals, they then propose a Treaty with our People, who generously complies with almost every Things they say and want, then the next Step will be, give them some Thousands of Pounds in Cloa∣thing, Arms, Ammunition, and in short every Thing they can say that they have
<PB N="7" REF="009697_0007_0F77861175C69A00"/>need of, and when the Renderzvous is over, and the Indians have well Eaten and Drank, they return to their own Country, killing whether Man or Beast they meet in their Way, this is the Retaliation the Government who must pay all Sums thus expended get in return, some may say it's a necessary Scourge for our Evil; others that it is not a Welcome One, and full of Ingratitude and Deceit.</P>
<P>MAY <HI>the</HI> GOD <HI>of all Nature direct us as Christians to Humility, walk humbly before him, and to love our Neighbours as ourselves,</HI> and then undoubtedly will cease all this Tumultuous Factions: <HI>He will say to the Fomenting Sea, whose Winds are Outrageous, be thou still as the fine gliding Brook, whose purling Streams are harmonious to the Hear∣ers Ears, is the earnest Prayer of your true and affectionate Lover of King and Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> It would be well in this Critical juncture of Things, as the White People most in General, hates any Thing that Sa∣vours of the Name of an Indian; that they were remov'd to their own Country and there set down in the most Peaceable terms
<PB N="8" REF="009697_0008_0F778612273206F0"/>we could make with them, in hopes for the Future they wou'd rest satisfied, and in their Way, endeavour for an honest Living by Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Trade with us in my Opinion, for their Skins and Furrs, wou'd be valuable; and the Heart scald that now subsists among People; chiefly on their Account, wou'd weare away; on the other Hand if they should misbehave; there are Men enough here, and more will be very soon here, and be able to follow them into their Towns, and undoubtedly take full Satisfaction, for any Insults they dare com∣mit. If we rightly inform'd, our Mother Country had always some Jealousy of our behaviour one Day or other, and in this Situation of Things, there is a beginning made. SOLOMON says; <HI>A rod for the Fools hack,</HI> and we shall have it, a standing Army to maintain.</P>
