<HEAD>Advice to Sinners un∣der <HI>Convictions,</HI> to pre∣vent their Miscarry∣ing in <HI>Conversion.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Poor Sinners!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send these Truths from the Eternal GOD to you in Love &amp; Faithfulness; unfeignedly desiring that you may be convinced of your Unbelief, and of all your Sins, and of your present accursed and condemned State, and that you may be taught of God to rely upon Christ, who died for the ungodly. If you continue unrege∣nerate, you will certainly ere long be the most miserable of the whole Creation, and Monuments of divine Justice, altho' you now enjoy the World in its Glory. Since divers of you are awakened, I hope that God may have Thoughts of everlasting Love to some of your Souls: therefore as I have warned you to flee for Refuge from the Wrath of God
<PB N="4" REF="004702_0003_100DBC16125803B0"/>which is coming upon you &amp; without delay, presently to come out of this dreadful Con∣dition, to Christ, who will embrace you; so I write to you, and to all others to whom these Truths may be communicated, to pre∣vent their miscarrying in Conversion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Seek to know and be convinced by the Spi∣rit thro' the Scriptures, that you are born dead in Sins and Children of Wrath, without Christ, and without Hope:</HI> Eph 2 3, 12. And that you lie every Moment under God's Curse and Wrath; in danger of eternal Condemnation; <HI>Gal</HI> 3 10 <HI>The Wicked shall be turned into Hell,</HI> Psal 9.17 <HI>The Soul thas sinneth it shall die,</HI> Ezek 18 4. Unbelievers shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on them, though they are insensible of it. The Lord saith <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God:</HI> And <HI>he that believeth not is condemned already,</HI> Joh. 3.3, 18, 36. Consider seriously then, each of you, I beseech you, <Q>What will become of me, who am not born again, nor ever had the Experience of a Work of Grace?</Q> O that your Eyes were open to behold all the Sins of your Hearts &amp; Lives, in order before you, which may cry aloud continually for Vengeance against your guilty Souls! 'Twere enough to make you tremble, who are now most senseless. Retire alone quick∣ly, and reflect upon your Ways as in the Sight of God. Put these Questions to your selves,—<Q>Have not I sometimes Lyed, or
<PB N="5" REF="004702_0003_100DBC16125803B0"/>Stole, or swore an Oath? Have I not pro∣phaned the Lord's Day? Was I never Proud, nor Wanton, nor Malicious? Have I ne∣ver taken the Lord's Name in vain? Have I not been disobedient to my Parents? Have I not a carnal, unclean, hard and unbelieving Heart? Did I never break God's Laws? Am not I dead in Sins to this Day? Yea surely I must cry out, Guil∣ty, guilty: My Conscience condemns me. What will become of me if I die in this dreadful Condition? For the righteous God hath said, <HI>Cursed is every one that con∣tinueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them</HI> He that spared not the Angels when they sin∣ned, but cast them down to Hell: He that spared not the old World, nor the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> but condemned them with an overthrow, making them an Ex∣ample unto those which after should live ungodly, will not spare me long. Does not Hell gape for me? Is there any hopes that such a Sinner as I have been, may be washed in the Blood of Christ? God may righteously damn me for these Sins, or for the least Sin; <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 23. It is of the Lord's Mercy that I am not consumed, and now in Hell, howling among the damned, crying out for a Drop of Water to cool my Tongue; <HI>Lam.</HI> 3 22 <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.24.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Seek the Lord in secret for his Spirit while he may be found;</HI> Isai. 55.6. Cry out each
<PB N="6" REF="004702_0004_100DBC17ABFE5828"/>of you for the Blood of Christ, as condemned Malefactors do for Mercy: As they did, <HI>Act.</HI> 2 37. Or as the Keeper of the Prison said trembling, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> Act. 16 30 Rest not one Day nor one Hour lon∣ger quietly or securely, till you have some Hopes that Faith is wro't in you by the Spirit, and that Jesus Christ will plead your Cause at the Day of Judgment; for without the imputation of his Righteousness there is no Remission. Follow Christ, crying after him as the blind Man did, <HI>Lord, that our Eyes may be opened,</HI> Mat. 20 30. Pray as the Leper did, Mat. 8.2. <HI>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</HI> Plead importu∣nately for the Spirit which is promised in these last Days to be poured out upon all Flesh, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Isai.</HI> 44.3. If the Lord by his Word and Spirit makes you sensible of your fearful undone Condition; beware of resting short of a thorow Work of Grace; lest you fall short of union with Christ, thro' the teachings and drawings of the Father; lest you rest in a false Peace, <HI>Luk</HI> 11.21. com∣passing yourselves about with Sparks of your own kindling, thro' slight wounding, or slight healing, <HI>Isai</HI> 50.11 Take heed of building foolishly upon the Sand, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.26, 27. And lest thou prove at best but a foolish Virgin walking with the wise, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. Fear lest you make a Christ of Duties, of Praying, Weeping, Purposing or Reforming; for the <HI>Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomination to
<PB N="7" REF="004702_0004_100DBC17ABFE5828"/>the Lord,</HI> Prov. 15.18. <HI>There is a Way that seemeth right to a Man. but the End thereof are the Ways of Death,</HI> Prov. 14.12. <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness,</HI> Prov 30.12. A Person may go very far under the awakenings of Conscience, and have a Zeal of God, &amp; yet being ignorant of God's Righteousness, go about all his Life time to establish his own Righteousness, and get no∣thing at last but the Hypocrites Hope, which shall perish. Thou that spinnest a covering for thy Nakedness out of thine own Bowels, thy Trust shall be like a Spider's Web in the Day of thy Calamity: This thou shalt have at the Hand of God, thou shalt lie down in Sorrow: For Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believ∣eth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.13, 14. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.2, 3, 4. By the Deeds of the Law there shall no Flesh be justified in the Sight of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 20. If ever thou find Mercy, thou must be justified freely by the Grace of God, thro' the Re∣demption which is in Christ Jesus by Faith without the Deeds of the Law, <HI>ver.</HI> 24, 28. 'Tis true, Faith comes by hearing, and 'tis our Duty to attend on God's Appointments, where the Spirit works; but if Righteous∣ness come by any Work of the Law, then Christ is dead in vain, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.21. To him that worketh not in the Point of Justification, but believeth on him that justifyeth the un∣godly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness:
<PB N="8" REF="004702_0005_100DBC1A8A1C7870"/>Blessed is that Man to whom God imputeth Righteousness without Works, <HI>Rom</HI> 4.5, 6</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Lock to the Lord to convince you of Sin, because you believe not in Jesus Christ, which is promised,</HI> John 16 7.8, 9. In your At∣tendance on the Means of Grace, be willing to be convinced by the Comforter, that your Hearts are so desperately wicked that you will not come to Christ; and to seel your Impotency, that you cannot believe in him, unless the Lord put forth the exceeding Greatness of his Power, <HI>Bph.</HI> 1.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Know assuredly, and welcome these glad Tidings, that Christ is come of a Truth into the World on purpose to save Sinners, and the chiefest of them,</HI> 1 Tim 1.15. <HI>God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not pe∣rish, but have everlasting Life.</HI> John 3.19. <HI>Christ havh once suffered sins, the Just for the Unjust, that he might bring us to God,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.18 Fice to this Refuge when thou seest thyself ungodly, and accursed by the Law of God, and searest thou shalt be condemned. Consider with thy self, tho' I am ungodly, yet Christ died for the Un∣godly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5 6. Though I am an Enemy, yet Christ hath reconciled Enemies to God by his Death. <HI>Verse</HI> 10. Though I am rebellious, and so abominable, that I fear lest the Earth should open and swallow up such a Wretch, and God should righteously sink me to Hell, living, and in his Wrath; yet
<PB N="9" REF="004702_0005_100DBC1A8A1C7870"/>here's good News and Encouragement for me, that Jesus Christ when he ascended on high received Gists for Men, yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord might dwell among the Rebellious, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.18. Tho' I am accursed, and I fee evidently God threatens to damn me in many Scriptures, yet is there Hopes for such a condemned sinner, since Christ hath redeemed accursed sinners from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for them, that they might re∣ceive the Blessing of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the Pro∣mise of the Spirit, <HI>Gal</HI> 3.13, 14.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Believe in Jesus Christ, because 'tis the Command of God and pleasing in his Sight, and thy Duty, though thou canst see no other Warrant or Ground of Encouragement.</HI> It is not only thy Privilege, but thy Duty to be∣lieve. <HI>This is his Commandment, that we should-believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 John 3 22, 23. <HI>Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved,</HI> Act. 16.31. Christ tells Hypocrites that sought him for their Bellies, <HI>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him whom God hath sent,</HI> Joh. 6 28, 29. Apply the Word thus for thy self; the righteous God that knows all my hainous Sins, instead of condemning me for them, commands me to believe on his Son, and assures me that I shall be saved. The Lord give thee the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of Christ, and the Obedience of Faith. The Voice of the
<PB N="10" REF="004702_0006_100DBC1C961194F8"/>Lord Jesus is powerful, and his Sheep hear it; pray earnestly that his Commands may come with Power to thy Soul.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Rejoyce to hear that Jesus Christ is be∣come an earnest Suitor for thy Love.</HI> The Lord that was crucified for the chiefest Sinners, now saith to thee, <HI>Behold I stand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice and o∣pen the Door, I will come in to him,</HI> Rev 3.20. <HI>I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners,</HI> saith the Lord, Mat. 9.13. <HI>Come un∣to me all ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest,</HI> Mat. 11.28. <HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Money, come,</HI> Isai. 55.1. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride say come, and let him that heareth say come, and let him that is a thirst come, and whosoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely,</HI> Rev. 22 17. Hearken therefore to the ravishing Voice of Christ, altho' thou mayest judge thyself the vilest and chiefest of Sinners, and mayest ve∣rily think there may be Marcy for others, but there is none for such a great monstrous Sin∣ner as thou hast been; yet here's the joy∣ful Sound, that the Son of Man, God mani∣fest in the Flesh, is come to seek and save that which was lost, <HI>Luk</HI> 19.10</P>
<P>How dreadful soever thy Condition may be in thy own Thoughts, yet Christ saith, <HI>Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out,</HI> Joh. 6.37. Though you therefore feel hard and dead Hearts, yet come as Sinners
<PB N="11" REF="004702_0006_100DBC1C961194F8"/>unto Christ, who came to seek and save such. The Lord calls stout-hearted Sinners who are far from Righteousness to hearken unto him <HI>Isai.</HI> 46.12, 13</P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>When your Hearts are sinking under the Sense of God's Wrath, then resolve in the Strength of Christ to rely upon him, to cast and rowl your selves upon him, whatever be the Issue.</HI> If I perish, I will perish at the Feet of Christ, for otherwise I am sure to perish: If he condemn me, he is righteous; if he save me, 'twill be Riches of free Grace for ever to be admired. Venture thus upon Christ against a thousand Discouragements, as the <HI>Lepers</HI> ventured into the Tents of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> 2 Kings 7.4, 5, 6. Press in upon Christ, resolving to take no Denial, as the Woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> did, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.22 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These had a blessed Issue out of their Difficul∣ties; and thou shalt find at length that the Bowels of Christ will yearn over thy faint∣ing Soul, lying at his Feet for a Crumb, and he will embrace thee with unspeakable Love. Thus let the Kingdom of Heaven suffer Violence; press thou into it, and take it by Force.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Never attempt to believe or repent in thy own Strength, but look unto Fesus in whom it hath pleased the Father all Fullness should dwell,</HI> Col. 1.19 As thou would'st not prove a rotten Hypocrite, beware of a dead Faith of thy own forming, which is not the Faith of the Operation of God, <HI>Col</HI> 2 12.
<PB N="12" REF="004702_0007_100DBC1E7B317140"/>Look not for that in thy self which is to be found in Christ, nor for that in the Law which is to be found in the Gospel: This hath been the Cause of the long Troubles of ma∣ny precious Souls. When thou fearest thou shalt die eternally because thou canit not be∣lieve, look out of thy self onto Christ, who is full of Grace, and behold his Glory, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Look unto me and be ye saved all the Ends of the Earth,</HI> Isai. 45.22. Look unto Jesus the beginner and finisher of Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2. Christ never comes expecting to find Faith or Repentance, but looks upon a filthy Soul polluted in his own Blood, and saith unto him, <HI>Live;</HI> and this Time is the Time is the Time of Love, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16 6.8. The Grace of the Lord is exceeding abundant to the chiefest of Sinners; with Faith and Love which is in Christ Jesus, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.14. When thou turnest thine Eyes inward, and fearest that the Hardness and Impenitency of thy Heart will surely be thy ruin; flee to that reviving Word, Acts 5.30, 31. <HI>God hath raised up Jesus, and exalted him with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to Israel, and Remission of Sins.</HI> The Lord hath promised in the latter Days to destroy the Veil of Unblief which is spread over all Nations, <HI>Isai.</HI> 25.7. Dost thou find by Experience that Word true, <HI>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him;</HI> behold in the next Verse what a full Promise of Help
<PB N="13" REF="004702_0007_100DBC1E7B317140"/>is made to thee; <HI>They shall be all taught of God; every Man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me,</HI> Joh. 6 44, 45. <HI>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach Sinners in the Way.</HI> Psal. 25 8 Christ saith, <HI>I am the Way un¦to the Father,</HI> Joh 16.4. Follow the Lord at the Throne of Grace with Cries and Groans unutterable, without ceasing; O draw me to Christ, help me to close with, and to rely upon Him! If thou findest still 'tis im∣possible for thee to believe, hear the Lord saying to thee; <HI>Let him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my Strength that be may make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with me, and he shall make Peace with me</HI> Isai 27 5. <HI>He giveth Power to the Faint and to them that have no Might, be encreaseth Strength,</HI> Chap 40 29. <HI>Therefore trust in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is ever lasting Strength,</HI> Chap. 26 4. It is my earnest Desire and Prayer that this may be the Time of God's special Love, and the Day of his Power; that you may be united to Christ by Faith wrought in you by the Power of God's Spi∣rit; that you may thirst after, and receive a full Assurance of God's Love, and that you may have the Love of Christ shed abroad in your Hearts; and may abide in Christ being strong in the Grace which is in him, which is sufficient for you in your greatest Straits; and that you may be taught of God to sing his Praises, and to rejoyce with trembling; and may never lose your first Love, or fall
<PB N="14" REF="004702_0008_100DBC20D38690D0"/>into a Spirit of Slumber or Delusion; but may grow in the Knowledge of Christ, and being planted in the House of God may bring forth much Fruit; denying yourselves and taking up the Cross of Christ, walking worthy of the Lord all your few Days, to the Praise of his Free Grace, who hath cal∣led you into his Kingdom and Glory.</P>
<P>O that these Lines may not hereafter rise up in Judgment at the last Day against any of you which slight them, and condemn you; but that they may be the Voice and Call of God, his Arm and Power revealed to your Salvation. <HI>The Presence of the Comforter be with you for ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>More Advice to Sinners under <HI>Convictions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>QUESTION,</P>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Beseech you since my present Con∣dition is so dreadful as God's Word reveals it, tell me, if there be any Hopes for such a Sinner, and what Course I must take?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> WHen the Keeper of the Prison asked <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> Sirs, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> they said, <HI>Believe on the Bord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thy House,</HI> Act. 16.30, 31. Therefore im∣mediately under the Means of Grace, wait
<PB N="15" REF="004702_0008_100DBC20D38690D0"/>for the Spirit to draw thee by the Gospel. Thou wilt there ear that Christ hath re∣deemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us, <HI>Gal,</HI> 3.13. God hath sent forth his Son made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law. God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him should not perish, but have everlasting Life, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. Go not therefore about to establish thy own Righteousness; for Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believes, <HI>Rom</HI> 10 34 Thou wilt there hear the joyful Sound that the chiefest of Sinners have believed and are saved; and that it is not the highest Aggra∣vation of thy Sins, nor thy present accursed State, shall hinder thee from Mercy, if thou art made willing in the Day of God's Power to come out of thy Sins and Self to Jesus Christ. The Lord will pardon abundantly, <HI>Isai.</HI> 55. The Grace of Christ doth super∣abound; he hath Gifts for the Rebellious, Psal. 68.18. <HI>This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of Acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners, of whom I am chief,</HI> (saith Paul) 1 Tim. 1.15 <HI>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out,</HI> saith CHRIST, Joh. 6 37. Therefore don't take a desperate Course, because thou thinkest no Sins are like thine; <HI>For the Blood of Jesus Christ bis Son cleanseth from all Sin,</HI> 1 Joh 1 7. God doth justify Sinners freely by his Grace,
<PB N="16" REF="004702_0009_100DBC23243D4478"/>through the Redemption which is in Christ Jesus, <HI>Rom</HI> 3 24 Let it overcome thy Heart to consider how freely Christ pro∣claimed himself to Sinners when he dwelt a∣mong us. <HI>Jeb.</HI> 7.37. when he stood and cried, <HI>If my Man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink:</HI> His precious Blood is more able to justify, than thy crying Sins are to condemn thee. <HI>Come,</HI> saith Christ to thee, <HI>for all Things are now ready.</HI> The Spirit saith, <HI>Come,</HI> and the Bride saith <HI>Come,</HI> and let him that hear∣eth say <HI>Come;</HI> and let him that is a thirst <HI>Come,</HI> and whosoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely, <HI>Rev</HI> 22 17. There is Righteousness in Christ to cover thee, and Faith to receive it too. God will have Mercy on them that have not obtained Mer∣cy, and maketh them his People, which were not his People, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.23. Christ is exalt∣ed to give Repentance, and why not to thee that need'st it? Hath not Christ called, and waited long till his Locks were wet with Dew?</P>
<P><HI>Poor condemned Sinner!</HI> How can'st thou chuse but be overcome with his Love, who still beseecheth thee to be reconciled, tho' he could glorify himself in thy Destruction? 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 20. If God would shew thee a lit∣tle of the Love of his Heart, and of the Heart of Christ to Sinners, it would dissolve thy frozen Heart, and make thee admire it, that there should be Forgiveness of the greatest Sins still for so vile a Wretch. Cry in secret
<PB N="17" REF="004702_0009_100DBC23243D4478"/>to God, that thou mayest know what it is to find Mercy, since he delights in Mercy. When Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here upon Earth, see what a win∣ning Sermon he preached to Publicans and Sinners, <HI>Luke</HI> 15. When he insinuated into them their lost Estate, and that he was come to seek and save them: And to encourage returning Prodigals, who are ready to fear there is no Mercy for them; he shews them tho' they are far off, his Bowels shall yern towards them, and he will run to them leap∣ing over Mountains to embrace them. I assure thee there is as much Love and Bowels in the Heart of Christ now he is ascended, as when he was upon the Earth. Tho' thou art a Scorner at Christ's Spirit, yet saith the Lord, <HI>How long ye Soorners will ye delight in your Scorning, turn you at my Reproof, behold I will pour out my Spirit upon you,</HI> Prov. 1 23. Thus do thou hearken to the alluring and ravishing Voice of Christ, till thou art over∣come with his Love, and art compelled and necessitated to come in, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14 23.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>I have had some Convictions, but I sear no thorough Conversion. I find many are called but sew are chosen: What Counsel can you give me that I may not miscarry for ever?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Besides what is written in my <HI>Advice to Sinners,</HI> which I shall have Reference to; take these Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Work out thy Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI> Cherish the godly Fears of com∣ing to the Birth without Strength to be bro't
<PB N="18" REF="004702_0010_100DBC24BB35C2B8"/>forth: Beware lest thy Convictions die and come to nothing; rest not in Ease without Healing through the Sprinkling of Christ's Blood.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rest not in legal Horror, short of godly Sorrow:</HI> Dig deep that thou mayest build upon a Rock. If God turn thine Eyes in∣ward; and shew thee what an open Sepul∣chre full of deadly Poyson thou art, thou wilt then justify God though he should spurn thee into Hell immediately, and wilt wonder what hath held the Hand of revengeful Justice from comsuming thee long since. The Lord will not crush under his Feet such a Prisoner of the Earth, <HI>Lam</HI> 3 34. Nor will he con∣demn thee that dost thus justify him, and con∣demn thy self, and liest at his Feet longing to be found in Christ. Wait therefore for the Spirit's Conviction of <HI>Sin,</HI> because thou believest not on Jesus Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16 8, 9. When the <HI>Comforter</HI> is come, he will reprove the World of <HI>Sin,</HI> because they <HI>believe not</HI> on me, <HI>(i e.)</HI> shall convince them of this Sin chiefly: The Spirit doth aggravate this Sin of <HI>Unbelief,</HI> where he cometh to work with Power savingly. This is promised in the lat∣ter Days, that the chiefest of Sinners shall look upon Christ whom they have pierced, and mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, <HI>Zech,</HI> 12 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Long insatiably to be found in Christ, not having thine own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but the Righteousness which is thro'
<PB N="19" REF="004702_0010_100DBC24BB35C2B8"/>the Faith of Christ;</HI> Phil. 3 9 Never expect to be healed by the Law; but thro' the Righteousness of Christ without the Deeds of the Law: For the Law can only wound thee, and give thee the Knowledge of Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20, 28. And there it leaves thee in a helpless and perishing Condition; it only works Wrath, and curseth thee, and judg∣eth and condemneth thee. It is very usual with troubled Souls to run to their Duties, or Tears, or Purposes to Sin no more; in their own Strength; instead of looking to Christ who was made Sin for them who knew no Sin, that they may be made the Righteous∣ness of God in him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. They should come without Money, as unworthy and empty Sinners to Christ, whom it pleas∣ed the Father to bruise, <HI>Isai.</HI> 53. Christ hath finished Transgression and made an End of Sins, and made Reconciliation for Iniquity, and brought in everlasting Righteousness, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24 Herein Christ's Ambassadors need to be faithfully warned, when they press Duties upon awakened Sinners, to teach them to look for Justification by Faith, with∣out the Deeds of the Law, lest they make a Generation of Self-righteous Hypocrites, instead of sound Believers. <HI>Maledicta sit omnis doctrine, vita, religio, quae conatur lege aut operibus parare justitiam coram 'Deo. All that Teaching, Doctrine, Life and Religion is accursed: which labours to provide a justi∣fying
<PB N="20" REF="004702_0011_100DBC26F2E63660"/>Righteousness before God, by the Law or the Works thereof. Lutheri</HI> Anathema.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Therefore if thou would'st be accepted of Christ, come as ungodly, as unrighteous unto him, who died for Sinners as such, and findeth them dead in Sins when be comes to call them.</HI> The Work of the Law is only to convince us that we are ungodly, dead in Sins, having no Righteousness, not Strength If thou wouldst not be rejected and prove a Pharisee, come as a Sinner helpless, and hopeless. Though thou feeleft thy self dead, senseless, asleep, nay, tho' thou knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable &amp; poor, &amp; blind, and naked; yet saith Christ, I counsel thee to buy of me Gold and white Raiment, that thou mayst be cloathed, &amp; that the shame of thy Nakedness do not appear, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.27, 28. Instead of refusing Christ by Infidelity upon Apprehensions of unworthiness, or the want of this, or the other Work of the Law, Qua∣lification, or Preparation, thou should'st ra∣ther wonder that there shou'd be justification by free Grace tendred to such a Rebel; that thou being an Enemy should be commanded and invited to come to Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Let the Threatnings against Unbelief a∣waken thee not to dare to refuse Christ offered to thee.</HI> It is a most hainous, dreadful Sin, to make light of one Tender of free Pardon of Sins by the Blond of Christ, which the De∣vils never had: For this Sin will Jesus Christ are long break through the Clouds, in

<P N="6">6. <HI>Fear Unbelief chiefly; Heb.</HI> 3 12. Many awakened Persons are troubled with ground∣less Fears, lest there is no Remission for such abominable Wretches; they sear that such hard, filthy, secure Sinners shall not be accep∣ted. But O Fear least thou shouldest re∣fuse Christ, or not welcome him: Fear lest a Promise being lest thee of entring into Rest, thou shouldest seem to come short of it through Unbelief, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>You know not what a Wretch I have been: I cannon but Fear, that my hai∣nous Sins will ruin me:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> If thy Conscience oft smites thee with tormenting Fears, that thy Uncleanness, Self Pollution, Gluttony, Passion, Pride, or Covetousness, or the like, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be thy Ruin; there is a greater Sin, which is <HI>Unbelief;</HI> thy not coming to Christ, not welcoming the glad Tidings of free Remission of Sins by <HI>Christ</HI>'s Blood, for the chiefest Sinners with all Acceptation. It is this Soul damning Sin thou hast most cause to fear; it is he only that believeth not the Son, that shall not see Life. <HI>Joh</HI> 3.36.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Be assured it is not Presumption, but thy Duty to believe though thou apprehendest thy self to be the chiefest of Sinners:</HI> For God will account himself glorified by thy believ∣ing in Hope against Hope, <HI>Rom</HI> 4 20</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004702_0012_100DBC2944098DD8"/>
Object <HI>Why do you put me thus upon be∣lieving, since you grant I have no Power?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> Because the Lord causeth his Com∣mands to come with Almighty Power upon his Elect, and doth convey his Spirit, and Strength in the Use of his instituted Ordi∣nances, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.4, 5.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Destroy not thy precious Soul, by mind∣ing Mortification before Regeneration.</HI> There is no Communion before Union; first make the Tree good, and then its Fruit will be good; <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.33. Many Persons know they must perform this and the other Duty; this and the other Grace they want; and set upon the Work in their own Strength, and are always learning: Many shall thus seek and shall not be able. If thou wouldst not miss the narrow Way here then, seek to be first planted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ by the Power of his Resurrection, and then let thy Faith work by Love abundantly. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> ob∣serves upon the <HI>Revelations</HI> that the <HI>Romish Priests</HI> in their Doctrine, like the <HI>Locusts,</HI> do sting the Conscience with the Law, and heal the Wound, by urging upon Persons external Works of Mortification; being ig∣norant of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</P>
<P>Let Christ's Ministers beware of putting awakened Sinners preposterously first upon Works before Faith, and to bring forth good Fruit, before they press them to look for a Principle by their Union with Christ through
<PB N="23" REF="004702_0012_100DBC2944098DD8"/>the Teachings of God. This is to put a Man upon building a Superstructure without a Foundation: I fear many thousands perish by such Preaching: Consult Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> of <HI>Mortification.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Especially beware of resting short of Union with Christ.</HI> There is a glorious and mysterious Union with God manifest in the Flesh by the Spirit. When Christ betroths a Sinner to himself for ever in Righteousness, and in Loving Kindness, and in Judgment, and in Faithfulness, then shall be know the Lord; <HI>Hosea</HI> 2.19, 20. Then is <HI>Christ's Prayer</HI> answered, <HI>That they all may be one, as thou Father, art in me, &amp; I in thee, that they also may be one in us,</HI> Joh. 17.21. It is he that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him. The vilest Wretches will Love Christ's Benefits, especially when they come to die. The sound Believer falls in Love with Christ himself; thou must be cut out of the Olive-Tree, which is wild by Nature, by the Hand of God, and graffed contrary to Nature into the good Olive-Tree; else <HI>Christ</HI> will not own thee as his Member, but thou wilt wither as a rotten Branch, and be gathered of Men, and cast into the Fire; <HI>Joh.</HI> 25.6. Thou must eat <HI>Christ's</HI> Flesh, and drink his Blood; else thou canst have no spiritual Life in thee: <HI>Joh.</HI> 6 53.</P>

<P>Object <HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am still sensible that I cannot believe:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. May not Christ rather complain of thee, as of those, <HI>John</HI> 5 40. Ye will not come to me that ye might have Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Under the Sense of thine Impotency, pray and wait continually for the experimental Knowledge of the Power of Christ's Resurrection, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 10 That God may put forth the exceeding Greatness of his Pow∣er, enabling thee to go to Christ's Fulness, that Grace may reign in thee, <HI>Eph</HI> 1.7.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spirit's End in convincing thee of thine Impotency, is chiefly to teach thee to look unto Christ, who is full of Grace, and in all God's Appointments to wait for the Drawings of the Father, who hath promised his Teachings, <HI>John</HI> 6 44 45.</P>
<P N="4">4 Jesus Christ hath purchased and pro∣mised the Spirit, the Comforter, to convince the World of Unbelief, and to beget Faith, <HI>John</HI> 16.8, 9, 10, 14. Therefore instead of
<PB N="25" REF="004702_0013_100DBC2BFA23E170"/>unbelieving Despondencies, look for the Ef∣fusion of the Spirit, under the Means of Grace, to enable thee to believe.</P>
<P>Object <HI>What have I to do to come to Christ, who am ungodly, asleep, unprepar'd, the chiefest of Sinners? Alas, I am condemned, and ex∣pect nothing but Hell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. It is the Lord who hath begun to open thine Eyes, &amp; to shew thee thy present Condition, according to his Promise, <HI>Isa.</HI> 25.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thou only art the Person that art called, and shalt be welcome to Jesus Christ, notwithstanding all thy Guilt, and want of Preparations, and Qualifications in thy own Sense and Apprehension. God doth com∣mand thee not to Work <HI>(i.e.)</HI> for thy Peace, but to believe in God, who justifies the un∣godly, and thy Faith shall be accounted for Righteousness; thou art to believe in God, who quickeneth the dead, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. 17. God who is rich in Mercy, for the great Love wherewith he loved dead Sinners quickneth them together with Christ, that he might shew forth the exceeding riches of his Grace, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.7. Christ commands and invites Sin∣ners and no other to come to him; and pro∣fesseth plainly that he will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice, and that he came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.11.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>This rejoyceth my Heart that such a Wretch as I may come to Christ: But may I now come to Christ so soon after I am awakned?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004702_0014_100D86BB31F0CA40"/>
<HI>Ans.</HI> Come and welcome now to Christ. Christ gave great Encouragement to <HI>Natha∣nael</HI> because he embraced the first Offer. Jesus said to him, <HI>Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the Fig Tree, believest thou? Thou sbalt see greater Things than these,</HI> John 1.50</P>
<P>Object <HI>The Lord is withdrawn from me, saith a distressed Soul, and I fear my Experi∣ences are a Delusion of the Devil, and Sparks of my own kindling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. After thou hast sung the Praises of God, do not thus soon forget his won∣derful Works, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old did, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.12, 13.</P>
<P N="2">2. Cast not away thy Confidence. Christ's Love-Tokens are Pledges of his Faithfulness in his Absence. When <HI>Asaph</HI> was at a loss, he said, I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the most High: sure I will remember thy Wonders of Old, <HI>Psal.</HI> 77.10, 11. Hath not the Lamb that was slain rent the Vail of Unbelief, and open'd the sealed Book, and shewed thee plainly of the Father? Did he never Seal his Love in one Promise? Did'st never triumph over one Lust? Hast thou not met with the Smiles of Goa's Countenance then, when thou expec∣tedst to be consumed in a Moment, being caught as it were out of the Belly of Hell, and laid in Christ's Bosom? Why dost thou thus unworthily and ingratefully forget the Day, when thy Lord delivered thee not from
<PB N="27" REF="004702_0014_100D86BB31F0CA40"/>one, but from all thy Fears? Then thou fat∣test under Christ's Shadow with great De∣light, and his Fruit was pleasant to thy Taste, <HI>Cant,</HI> 2.3. Then his Banner over thee was Love; then thy couldst Sing, <HI>My Beloved is mine, and I am his:</HI> O the heighth and depth, the length and breadth of the Love of Christ to my Soul, that passeth Know∣ledge? Canst thou not remember the Day, when Christ came leaping over the Moun∣tains, and skipping over the Hills to thy faint∣ing Soul; then thy Beloved spake, and said to thee, <HI>Rise up my Love, my fair One, and come away; for to the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone.</HI> Let not the Consolations of God be small with thee. Reflect upon the Time of thy first Espousals, when Christ dis∣covered himself and opened the everlasting Love of his Heart to thee; when thou wast in a doleful and forlorn Condition, and then ravish'd away thy Heart. Thy Love then was as strong as Death, and many Waters could not quench it; then thy Language was, Stay me with Flaggons, Comfort me with Apples, for I am Sick with Love; then perfect Love did cast out Fear, and by his Light thou walkedst through Darknefs. Call to mind the Days of Old, when thou rested thy weary Soul in everlasting Arms, rejoycing as more than a Conquerour over Sin and Law, Death, Hell and the Devil, through Christ who loved thee. Look to a full Christ, thou empty nothing Creature;
<PB N="28" REF="004702_0015_100DBC31A7AEEF80"/>thy Lord will turn again, he will not cast thee off for ever, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.31. Resolve with <HI>Joh, Though be slay me I will Trust in him, be also shall be my Salvation,</HI> Joh. 13.15, 16. The Lord hath appeared unto me of Old saying, <HI>Yea, I have loved thee with an everlast∣ing Love, therefore with loving Kindness have I drawn thee,</HI> Jer. 31 3 What though I am now in Darkness in the Deeps, in the low∣est Pit, like the slain in the Grave, whom God remembreth no more, yet doth he not shew Wonders to the dead? The Lord will command his loving Kindness in the Day Time; he will bring me forth to the Light, and I shall behold his Righteousness, <HI>Micah</HI> 7.9. Though thou now goest Mourning without the Sun, yet abida in Christ by the Power of God, that raised him from the dead; the Day will dawn, and the Shadows flee away; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the Morning, thy Light shall rise in Obscurity, and thy Darkness be as the Noon∣Day, the Lord shall be thine everlasting Light, and the Days of thy Mourning shall be ended, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.20. Pray for new Bottles to hold the new Wine upon thy Lord's re∣turn. The Lord hath had a long Controversy with many of his dear Children in these Na∣tions for the spilling of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider God's gracious Ends in with∣drawing. It is chiefly in Love to teach thee to live by Faith in Christ, and not upon thy Enjoyments, to lean upon thy Beloved
<PB N="29" REF="004702_0015_100DBC31A7AEEF80"/>in the Wilderness. If one should have asked <HI>Paul,</HI> how it was with his Soul; see the Ac∣count, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2 20. <HI>The Life I now live is the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> Though thou walkest in Darkness, and hast no Light, yet thou art commanded to trust and stay on thy God, <HI>Isai</HI> 50.10. Blessed is he that hath not seen, and yet hath be∣lieved, <HI>Joh</HI> 20 29.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>But I am a Backslider, and the Lord hath righteously hid his Face</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> It is very supporting to consider, the Heart of God and Christ towards his Chil∣dren under Backslidings, which appears in the many Gospel-Calls, and Promises of Re∣mission, and Healing, made to tempted Souls, when gone astray, and cast out of God's Sight: read <HI>Isai.</HI> 54 <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.30, 31. <HI>Hosea,</HI> 14. <HI>Luke</HI> 15.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>Surely it were better for me to de∣stroy my self,</HI> (saith another) <HI>under Tempta∣tion, than to live only to aggravate my Dam∣nation. I am condemned already, God hath set me up as a Monument of his Wrath; why should I live any longer in this Torment?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. Take heed of Soul wounding Sins, and least you run away from Christ by Un∣belief, after falls into them. Some fin a∣gainst Light, and then instead of flying to the Blood of sprinkling, they depart away farther by their Unbelief, than they did by their backsliding into Sin; and entertaining hard Thoughts of God and Christ in the Pride
<PB N="30" REF="004702_0016_100DBC3355537900"/>of their Hearts, they will rather attempt to take a desperate Course, than submit to the Righteousness of God, and fall down at the Feet of Christ, whose Arms are open to re∣seive the chiefest of Sinners.</P>
<P N="2">2. If thou hadst lain scorching in ever∣lasting Burnings, thou would think it a rich Mercy to be on this side Hell again: There are done to sympathize with thee, or to pray for thee or to give thee a Drop of Water to cool thy Tongue.</P>
<P N="3">3. Although thy present Condition be deplorable, yet be not thine own Executioner, if God will give thee a Reprieve in the World. When thou are tempted to it, I solemnly Charge thee to remember that God hath forbidden it, saying, <HI>Thou shalt not kill.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In the Hour of Temptation go not out in thine own Strength; look to Christ, and keep thine hold of him, who is able to keep thee from falling. The Lord hath laid Help upon one that is Mighty, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. Give no Place to the Devil. Be not affrighted from continuing in thy Calling: the Lord hath promised to keep thee in all thy Ways, and his Angels shall have Charge over thee, <HI>Psalm</HI> 91.11, 12.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thou art grosly mistaken in thinking no Case like thine, for no Temptation hath taken you, but such as is common to Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10 13. Many of God's dear Children have been as vehemently assaulted with such hellish Temptations, tho' thou thinkest
<PB N="31" REF="004702_0016_100DBC3355537900"/>thy Case cannot be parallel'd, and have been recovered, and their Unbelief, and all their sad Conclusions confuted.</P>
<P N="7">7. When thou art tempted to Sin, flee to that Promise, <HI>Isai.</HI> 54.17. No Weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper. The God of Peace shall bruise Satan under thy Feet shortly, <HI>Rom</HI> 16 20. God is faithful, who will not suffer thee to be tempted a∣bove that thou art able, but will with the Temptation, also make a way to escape, that thou mayest be able to bear it.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>I fear I shall faint in an Hour of Tryal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. This godly Fear is a special Pre∣servative promised in the New-Covenant against all Temptations to Sin, and Apostasy, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40.</P>
<P N="2">2. Watch and Pray always that thou mayst be accounted worthy to escape all Things, that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.36.</P>
<P N="3">3. Go not out in thine own Strength; for the eternal God is thy Refuge, and under∣neath are everlasting Arms. Be thou Par∣taker of the Afflictions of the Gospel accord∣ing to the Power of God. Be strong in the all-sufficient Grace, which is in Christ Jesus. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 1. Look to Christ to strengthen thee with all Might according to God's glorious Power unto all Patience and Long-Suffering with joyfulness. The Archers sorely grieved <HI>Joseph,</HI> and shot at him, but his Bow abode
<PB N="32" REF="004702_0017_100DBC363764E880"/>in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were strong by the Hands of the mighty God of <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 49, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="4">4 God's Word is a tried Word. Behold the great Cloud of Witnesses from the be∣ginning of the World to this Day, all set∣ting their Seals of the Faithfulness of God to his exceeding great and precious Promises.</P>
<P N="5">5 Behold Christ's wonderful Love in leav∣ing his Throne of Glory and his Father's Bosom, and hanging upon the Cross in thy Nature, bearing the Wrath of God for all thy monstrous Sins. This will constrain thee to follow God fully, to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, and to continue with him in his Temptations. Look to Christ to shed abroad his Lovs in thy Heart by his Spirit. Love is strong as Death; many Wa∣ters cannot quench Love, nor Floods drown it.</P>
<P>Object. Saith another, <HI>I have been long un∣der fearful Temptations to foul and damnable Sins, surely I am an Hypocrite, I live an Hell upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caution.</HI> I would not have any self deceiv∣ed Hypocrite, who allows himself delight∣fully in a Course of secret Sinning to cheat himself with this, that his reigning Sins are but Infirmities, because his Conscience stings him after the commission of Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. Flee to the Blood of Christ, to wash away the Guilt of thy scarlet Sins; and the Sense of God's pardoning Love shed a∣broad in thy Heart, will be one of the most
<PB N="33" REF="004702_0017_100DBC363764E880"/>effectual Means in the World to keep thee from returning again to Folly. It is most evident from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Experience, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2 20. that looking to Christ crucified for thy Sins and Backslidings, is the most expedite help to be crucified together with him, that the Body of Sin may be destroyed. The <HI>Corin∣thians</HI> experienced, that by beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord <HI>(i. e.)</HI> the Riches of God's Grace and Forgiveness through the Blood of Christ they were changed into the same Image, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.14. The Manifestations of God's pardoning Love to thee, will constrain thee; This will be thy practical Judgment; if Christ died for thee, when thou wast an Enemy, therefore thou that livest should'st not henceforth live unto thy self, but unto him that died for thee and rose again, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. If the Grace of God which brings Salvation appear to thee, 'twill teach thee to deny ungodliness and worldly Lusts; it will work evangelical Repentance in thee; it will dissolve thy frozen Heart that thou shalt remember thy Ways and be confounded and never open thy Mouth because of thy Shame, when thou be holdest that God is pacified towards thee, for all that thou hast done, <HI>Ezek,</HI> 16.61.</P>
<P>Therefore after thy Falls, tho' thy Heart be dead and stupid, yet run quickly to Christ with confusion of Face, who is exalted to give Repentance, and Remission of Sins, <HI>Act,</HI> 5.31. Believe stedfastly, though thou
<PB N="34" REF="004702_0018_100DBC37DE59FD30"/>hast Sinned, yet thou hast an Advocate with the Father, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the Righteous, who ever liveth to make Intercession for Trans∣gressors, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.2. Do not Work at all for Peace, or Healing, thereby frustrating the Death of Christ, but believe in Christ who was delivered for our Offences, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. When thou hast Sinned, run not farther from God by Unbelief, than thou hast done by thy Backslidings. Pluck not up the Foundation presently. This is one of Satan's Subtilties, by enticing thee to Sin, to break thy Peace, to torment and bewilder thee, and to take thee off thy Work, and Usefulness for God. Many Sins may cause matter of Humi∣liation, but not of questioning our Estates.</P>
<P N="3">3. Go out in the Strength of Christ, and thou shalt overcome at last, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6 9, 10. &amp;c. One Cause of our Falls in the Hour of Temp∣tations, is our going forth in the Confidence of received Grace. Therefore live continu∣ally under the actual Conviction, and Sense of thine inability to resist the least Tempta∣tion, and abide in Christ, in whom all Ful∣ness dwells</P>
<P N="4">4. It will be distinguishing Love from God; if thou through the Injection of fiery Darts and other Temptations, thou art kept awake from Luke-warmness and from a Spirit of Slumber and Security, the epidemical Sin of this Hour of Temptation which prevails ex∣ceedingly upon Saints, &amp; the World, not with∣standing
<PB N="35" REF="004702_0018_100DBC37DE59FD30"/>all awakening Dispensations, ac∣cording to Christ's Prediction, <HI>Mat.</HI> 34.25.</P>
<P N="5">5. It may be thy Temptations may con∣tinue all thy Life: Long not so much for Deliverance as for Strength to resist. Out of a slothful Principle, we often cry earnestly for Victory; therefore Temptations still con∣tinue. Observe Christ's Answer to <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. There was no Deliverance from the Thorn in the Flesh; but my Grace is sufficient for thee, for my Strength is made perfect through Weakness. Be confident of this; Sin shall not have Dominion over thee, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. Because thou art not under the Law, but under the Reign of Grace; and that God will give thee Power when thou art faint, and will increase thy Strength when thou bast no might, <HI>Isai.</HI> 40. And in the Faith of the sull Promises, purchased by Christ's Blood, take Courage: Glory in thine Infirmities, because of the Power of Christ, which shall rest upon thee. Rejoyce not against me, O mine Enemy; when I fall I shall arise, when I sit in Darkness the Lord shall be a Light unto me. Rejoyce in Christ Jesus, by, and in whom thou hast already overcome the World, and art more than a Conqueror, and art raised up together, and made to sit toge∣ther in heavenly Places in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Fight against Sin, the World, the Law, Death, and the Powers of Darkness, as a∣gainst conquered Enemies. Pray believing∣ly for that Purchase of Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. that
<PB N="36" REF="004702_0019_100DBC3B45F8E670"/>as Sin hath reigned unto Death in thee, Grace may now reign through Righteous∣ness to eternal Life. Rejoyce in Hope of everlasting Rest; where thou will more ad∣mire the Power and Wisdom of God in lead∣ing and unholding a poor weak Worm through such sad Desertions, and Tempta∣tions, and inextricable Labyrinths, than if thou hadst a calm Way to Glory. To him that overcometh, saith Christ, will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I o∣vercome, and am set down with my Father in his Throne, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21.</P>
<P>Now unto Him, who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless be∣fore the Presence of his Glory, with exceed∣ing Joy, be Honour and Dominion for ever.</P>
