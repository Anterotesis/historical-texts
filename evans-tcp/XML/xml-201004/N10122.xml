<P>OBSERVATIONS Upon the CONGREGATIONAL PLAN of CHURCH GOVERNMENT, Particularly as it respects the CHOICE and REMOVAL of CHURCH-OFFICERS, Supported by the Testimony of the FATHERS of NEW-ENGLAND, And Unanimously offered to the Consideration of the CHURCHES, BY THE CONVENTION of the MINISTERS Of the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> at their annual Meeting in <HI>Boston, May</HI> 26, 1773, and continued by Adjournment to <HI>July</HI> 23.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PECULIAR Difficulties and Perplexities having lately arisen in some of our Chur∣ches, which greatly threaten their general Peace and Welfare, the Ministers of Religion, who ought naturally to care for their State, and are under every Obligation to promote their Interest, have esteemed themselves called by the great Head of the Church to inquire with particular Attention into the Plan upon which our Churches were originally settled, and upon which they have so many Years happily flourished.</P>
<P>And as the Effect of our serious, and we hope Impartial Inquiry, we think proper to publish to the World the following Observations. This we do with a View not to infringe, but to state and defend the Rights of the Churches; fairly to represent that noble Plan of Order, so pecu∣liarly friendly to the Rights of Mankind, laid by our venerable Ancestors, after the most serious and careful Inquiry into the sacred Scriptures. Our only design has been, to find out its true Meaning; to compare its several parts with one another; to shew their consistency with them∣selves, with the Sentiments of the judicious
<PB N="4" REF="012857_0003_0F8B94213ABB37A0"/>Compilers, expressed in their other Compositi∣ons, and with the Principles and general Prac∣tice of our Churches and Pastors, from their first happy Settlement unto this Time.</P>
<P>We have no Inclination to propose any new Canon, or to impose upon the Churches any Opinion of our own. We only mean to aid the Inquiries of our Brethren into the true Nature of our Ecclesiastical Constitution, and we sub∣mit all to their candid and impartial Examina∣tion. Whatever they find, after a serious and unbiassed Consideration, opposite to this, they have an undoubted Right to reject. They will, however, allow us to entertain such an Opinion of their Christian Charity, as to rely on their kind Acceptance of our sincere Intention, in this Publication, to strengthen the Union of our Churches, to promote their Peace, and to pre∣serve the good Foundation upon which they have hitherto had Rest and been edified, and which we hope was laid for many Generations.</P>

<P>THE Compilers of the Platform of Church Disci∣pline agreed upon Anno 1648 are evidently of Opinion, that there are no Churches instituted un∣der the New-Testament Dispensation, but <HI>Congre∣gational,</HI> and expressly disclaim the name of <HI>Inde∣pendents.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Plat. Cap. 2. Sect. 5.</NOTE> Now the grand Distinction between <HI>Congre∣gational</HI> Churches and those which are erected on the <HI>Inde∣pendent</HI> Establishment consists in this; The Independents manage their Ecclesiastical Affairs solely among themselves, without supposing they are under any Obligation to ask Di∣rection or Assistance of any other Churches: But the Congre∣gational Churches, of which our Platform treats, are by our Constitutions in all Cases of Importance and Difficulty, to invite the Aid and Advice of neighbouring Churches, which our Fathers held to be an "Ordinance of Christ, though not absolutely necessary to the Being, yet many Times, thro' the iniquity of Men and perversness of Times, <HI>necessary</HI> to the well-being of Churches, for the Establishment of Truth and Peace therein."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Cap. 16. Sect. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>To suppose therefore that the Platform encourages the Churches upon its Establishment to transact their Important Affairs, without consulting the neighbouring Churches, where this Advice may be obtained, is directly to contradict the Judgment of our pious and learned Fathers upon this Point, to annihilate the Distinction which they had establish∣ed between the Churches of the Independent and Congrega∣tional Persuasion, to represent the Platform as inconsistent with itself, to destroy that Communion of Churches which they supposed ought sacredly to be maintained, and to de∣prive the Churches of an Institution of Christ greatly impor∣tant to their Order and Safety.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012857_0005_0F8B9422F80E47E0"/>
Our Fathers were too discerning to contradict themselves, and overthrow that goodly Frame of Church Government which they had erected with so much Wisdom and Judgment, after their maturest Inquiries, on a Scripture Foundation.</P>
<P>They with great Propriety and Justice assert,<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Plat. c. 8. s. 9.</NOTE> That neither <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> or <HI>Lay-Patrons,</HI> or <HI>Magistrates, as such,</HI> have Power to appoint Officers to a particular Church. This is the unalienable Right of the Brethren by a Free Elec∣tion: Yet they expressly declare, that, in the Exercise of this Right, it is agreable to Congregational Principles, "and much conducing to well-being and Communion of Churches; that, where it may conveniently be done, neighbour Chur∣ches be advised withal, and their Help be made Use of."<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Plat. c. 8. s. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the Platform evidently maintains that every Church hath Power, in the above described Method, to elect and proceed to the Settlement of their Officers, so it allows, that in Case <HI>of manifest Unworthiness, Delinquency or incorrigible offending, they have Power to depose or remove them:</HI> But the Compilers of the Platform are so far from supposing, that a Church should exercise this Power, without the Advice of other Churches; that in express Terms they are directed to proceed in so Important a Transaction by Advice from neigh∣bouring Churches.—This is plain from the very Words of the Platform, <Q>In Case an Elder offend incorrigibly, the Matter so requiring, as the Church had Power to Call to Office, so they have Power, <HI>according to Order (the Council of other Churches where it may be had, directing thereto)</HI> to remove him from his Office.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Plat. c. 10. s. 6.</NOTE></Q> These Words must convince every unprejudiced Mind, that <HI>the removal of an Elder from Office, according to Order</HI> and the Method ap∣pointed in our Platform, cannot be accomplished, but by the <HI>Council of other Churches, where it may be had, directing there∣to.</HI> Should a Church therefore of themselves, without asking or receiving Advice in the prescribed Method, pro∣ceed
<PB N="7" REF="012857_0006_0F8B9423773DF7C0"/>to dissolve the Relation between them and their Pastor, they would not only deviate from the Constitution we pro∣fess to be under, but act in direct Opposition to it. And of Consequence must be looked upon as irregular, and their Conduct must be in an higher Degree culpable, when they proceed not only without consulting, but contrary to the repeated Decisions of Ecclesiastical Councils regularly con∣vened.</P>
<P>In Opposition to what has now been said, it hath been al∣ledged, that the Platform<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Plat. c. 8. s. 5.</NOTE> declares "that if the Church have Power to chuse their Officers and Ministers, then in Case of manifest Unworthiness and Delinquency, they have Power also to depose them." —This we readily grant; and that this Power resides in them only, and not in any <HI>Synod</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastical Council,</HI> according to our Constitution—But then our Platform plainly points out on what Occasions, and in what Manner, they are to exercise this Power, viz. <HI>in Case of manifest Unworthiness and Delinquency—a Council of other Churches where it may be had, directing thereto,</HI> which is the only prescribed Method in which it can be done <HI>accord∣ing to Order.</HI> To whom is this Delinquency or Unworthi∣ness to be manifest?—Is it to that Church only to whom the Person accused belongs?—Alas! the unhappy Con∣troversies which usually usher in every Attempt to remove an Elder from his Office, render them too much a Party to be the sole constituted Judges in this Affair—The Delin∣quency must be manifest to the Council of other Churches, who are appointed to be called upon this Occasion, as well as to the Church more immediately concerned: Without this it would be the greatest Absurdity for the Council to ad∣vise and direct to the Dismission.—This Advice and Direction being obtained, the Church proceed to the regular Exercise of their Power, and dissolve the Relation between them and their Elder. This is indisputably the Meaning of our Platform: And to take it in any different Sense is to charge it with the greatest Inconsistency.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012857_0007_0F8B942A1A2947E8"/>
Upon this Point it is very observable, that the Platform makes Use of a very different Form of Expression, respecting the Introduction and Deposition of Church Officers:—As to the former, the Words of the Platform are these <Q>we judge it much conducing to the well-being and Communion of Churches, that where it may be conveniently done, Neighbour Churches be advised withal, and their Help be made Use of in the Trial of Church Officers in order to their Choice.<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Plat. c. 8. s. 8.</NOTE></Q> But as to the latter, viz. the Depo∣sition of an Elder, the Platform rises in Expression, and uses a much stronger Term,—<Q>The Council of other Churches <HI>directing</HI> thereto;</Q> most evidently signifying it to be their Mind of the Compilers, that a Church, even in Case of incorrigible Offence in an Elder, may not, <HI>according to Order,</HI> proceed of themselves alone to his Deposition, but that the Power they have, in so momentous a Matter, is to exercised under the Countenance and Direction of a Coun∣cil of other Churches regularly called.</P>
<P>Our illustrious Ancestors had too much Acquaintance with the Passions and Prejudices incident to human Nature, and too warm a Zeal for the Safety of the Churches, and the use∣fulness of the Ministry, to leave a Decision of so great and common Concern entirely to those whose Minds may have been heated by previous Contentions, and their Judgments biassed by various Prejudices and Prepossessions.</P>
<P>If this be allowed, every Church will have a Constituti∣onal Right, whenever they see fit, under the Pretence of Un∣worthiness and Delinquency in their Minister, after many Years faithful Service, to dismiss him from his Office, and resign him and his Family to seek a Maintenance from pub∣lic Charity.</P>
<P>What a Discouragement would this be to well-qualified Persons from entering into the Ministry under such a Con∣stitution—Soon
<PB N="9" REF="012857_0008_0F8B942A4837D220"/>would our Pulpits be vacant, or filled with men, no ways prepared for that important Service.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, We are fully of Opinion, that it is con∣trary to the Spirit and Letter of the Platform, for any Church to exercise the Power of dissolving the Relation between them and their Pastor, unless they act under the Direction of neigh∣bouring Churches, regularly called and convened, where such Direction may be obtained; and where a Church is rent with Divisions among themselves, and do not consult other Chur∣ches, they neglect to make Use of the Remedy which our Ec∣clesiastical Constitution hath in such Cases provided and en∣joined.</P>
<P>These are not merely our own peculiar Sentiments as to the meaning of that Church-Order, which is pointed out in our Ecclesiastical Constitution, but they are confirmed by the Suffrages of the most eminent Divines of our Communion, who lived at or near the Time when the Order of the Go∣vernment of Congregational Churches was established.</P>
<P>We have made a careful Inquiry into the Practice of the Churches, with Respect to Church Order, which, if it hath been uniform, must be esteemed a faithful Exposition of the Sen∣timents of the venerable Synod who compiled the Platform, and have the Satisfaction to find the Construction we have given of the Platform abundantly confirmed by the Writings of those Divines who were present at that Synod, and of the Ministers of the succeeding Age.</P>
<P>Before the Synod of 1648, the Churches of the Province had no Platform of their Church Government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, B 5. p. 20.</NOTE> Till that
<PB N="10" REF="012857_0009_0F8B942B0D08F9A0"/>Time, the venerable <HI>John Cotton</HI>'s Book of the <HI>Power of the Keys,</HI> in which the learned Author endeavours to lay out the just Line and Bounds of <HI>all Church Power,</HI> was generally re∣ceived as the Directory of these Churches in this Matter. In this Treatise he says, he is for that great Work of <HI>Communion and Consociation of Churches,</HI> p. 57. And speaking of the Liableness of Elders and Brethren to abuse their Power, <Q>he asserts the necessary <HI>Communion of Churches</HI> in <HI>Synods,</HI> who have Authority to <HI>determine, declare and enjoin</HI> such Things as may rectify the <HI>Male-Administrations,</HI>—which fall under their Cognizance: But still, so as to leave unto the <HI>particular Churches</HI> themselves the <HI>formal Acts,</HI> which are to be done <HI>pursuant unto the Advice of the Coun∣cil.</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, ut supra.</NOTE></Q> Upon the Churches scandalous and obstinate Refusal to comply with the Advice and Determination of Council, "The Council," says he, <Q>may withdraw Com∣munion from them, as from those who will not be <HI>counselled</HI> against a notorious Mismanagement of the Jurisdiction which the Lord Jesus Christ has given them.</Q> Upon these Citations we beg leave to remark, that, when the Disorders of Elders or Brethren had been such as in need the Counsel of other Churches, it was the Opinion of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> that the Church was to act <HI>pursuant</HI> to the Advice given them. It could not act <HI>contrary to it</HI> without destroying its Communion with other Churches, even a Re∣fusal to act agreable to the Advice given them, if it appeared to be <HI>scandalous and obstinate,</HI> was a sufficient Reason for other Churches to withdraw Communion from them.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> in his seasonable Testimony,<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">p. 13.</NOTE> speaking of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Book of <HI>the Keys,</HI> affirms that it <Q>has all along been of high Account in the Churches of this Country;</Q> and that <Q>in that Book, (as well as a the Preface to it written by Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI>) there is a full Testimony borne, to the Interest which <HI>Councils</HI> ought to
<PB N="11" REF="012857_0010_0F8B942BC01FE028"/>have in ordering the Affairs of <HI>consociated Churches.</HI></Q> He has given us the following remarkable Citation from it, which will help us to form just Sentiments of the Opinion and Practice of our venerable Fathers in the early Days of this Country. <Q>It is an <HI>holy Ordinance of Christ</HI> for <HI>particular Churches</HI> to join together, in a Consociation among them∣selves, to administer their Church Affairs, which are of <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Difficulty</HI> and <HI>common Concernment,</HI> not with∣out common Consultation and Consent of other Chur∣ches about them. Now Church Affairs of <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Difficulty</HI> and <HI>common Concernment,</HI> we account to be, the <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Ordination of Elders, Excommunication of an Elder,</HI> or of <HI>any Person of public Note and Employment;</HI> the <HI>Translation</HI> of an Elder from one Church to another.</Q> Upon which we observe, That, in the Opinion of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Matters of Weight, Difficulty and common Con∣cernment, of which the <HI>Excommunication,</HI> and by Parity, of Reason, the <HI>Deposition of an Elder</HI> was one, were not to be transacted by <HI>a particular Church,</HI> till it had consulted other Churches; and that their Sentence of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> and consequently of <HI>Deposition,</HI> was not to be administered with∣out the Consent of the Churches consulted.</P>
<P>The next Authority is that of the renowned <HI>Hooker,</HI> in his Survey of Church Discipline.<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Preface, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> He observes, <Q>That <HI>Consociation</HI> of Churches is not only lawful, but in some Cases <HI>necessary.</HI> When Causes are difficult, or particular Churches want Light and Help, they should crave the Assistance of such a Consociation. Churches so meeting, have a Right to counsel, rebuke, &amp;c. as the Case doth re∣quire. In case any particular Church shall walk <HI>pertinacious∣ly,</HI> either in the profession of Error, or sinful Practice, and will <HI>not hear their Counsel,</HI> they may and <HI>should</HI> renounce the Right Hand of Fellowship with them.</Q> According to Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> it is the Duty of a particular Church, whenever it wants <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> to ask the Counsel of other Churches,
<PB N="12" REF="012857_0011_0F8B942C855353B8"/>which when given, is not to be disregarded and slighted. For refusing to <HI>hear Counsel</HI> so given, is, according to him, just Cause for other Churches renouncing Fellowship with the Church so offending.</P>
<P>The next Father of our Churches, whose Sentiments we shall consider upon this Occasion, is Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Successor to the famous <HI>Cotton.</HI> In his Power of Congregational Churches, he maintains, "That a Congregational Church is the <HI>highest Ecclesiastical Tribunal,</HI> under Christ, in its own Matters."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">p. 134.</NOTE> He asserts. <Q>That this chief Tribunal must have no Ecclesiastical Power <HI>above it.</HI><NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">p. 135.</NOTE></Q> And <Q>That it may not be <HI>judicially</HI> censured by any Power of the same kind." That "<HI>Elders, as Officers,</HI> are above the Brethren, while they act according to <HI>Rule:</HI> But if they become <HI>Delinquents,</HI> they are under the <HI>Power of the Whole.</HI> The Church," he adds, "must submit to them as <HI>Rulers,</HI> whilst they <HI>rightly exercise</HI> the Authority of their Office, &amp;c. But they must submit to the Church, questioning, or proceeding to censure them, with <HI>good Advice of Neigh∣bour Churches and Elders,</HI> who as they concurred in giving them the Right Hand of Fellowship in their Ordina∣tion, so they should <HI>concur in approving this Censure,</HI> as justly inflicted by the Church, from Parity of Reason.<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">p. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE></Q> It is plainly the Opinion of Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> that no Censure ought to be passed on a delinquent Elder without the good Advice of neighbouring Churches: though a Con∣gregational Church is the highest Ecclesiastical Tribunal un∣der Christ, yet it ought not to exercise its Power in such a Case, till a Council of neighbouring Churches have advised them to do it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> who rendered himself famous by his Answer to <HI>Apollonius,</HI> maintains, <Q>That a <HI>confederate Fraternity</HI> is the first, proper and immediate ordinary Subject, that, from
<PB N="13" REF="012857_0012_0F8B942D756812C8"/>Christ, has derived to it <HI>all Ecclesiastical Power,</HI> or the mi∣nisterial Power of the Keys.<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">p. 57.</NOTE></Q> He insists upon it. <Q>That, in an organic State, no Ecclesiastical Act can be completed, either by the <HI>Elders</HI> excluding the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> or by the <HI>Fraternity</HI> setting aside the <HI>Presbytery.</HI><NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">p. 67.</NOTE></Q> He allows <Q>Councils to be <HI>remarkably useful,</HI> and after a Sort <HI>necessary,</HI> so that the Church cannot do <HI>well</HI> without them.<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">p. 112.</NOTE></Q> He maintains, <Q>That particular Chur∣ches ought to subject themselves to the lawful Determina∣tions of a Synod from all the Churches,</Q> and further, <Q>That the particular Churches ought to acquiesce in the <HI>lawful Decrees of a Synod,</HI> [or Council] for Fear of in∣curring the <HI>Guilt of disturbing public Order,</HI> and through the Fear of the <HI>Punishment of Non-Communion</HI> with other Churches.<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">p. 118.</NOTE></Q> According to Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> not to ac∣quiesce in the lawful Decrees of a Synod, or Council, would bring on a Church the Guilt of disturbing public Order, and expose it to the Punishment of Non-Communion with other Churches.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> in one of his last Sermons has this remarkable Passage, <Q>Let us acknowledge the Order of Eldership in our Churches in their Way, and the Order of <HI>Councils</HI> in their Way, duly backed and encouraged; <HI>without which.</HI> Experience will witness, that <HI>these Churches cannot long consist.</HI><NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Mather's Seasonable Test. p. 14.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Before we proceed to the Synod of 1662, we shall cite a Passage from an Election Sermon of Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth,</HI> formerly Minister of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> which throws great Light on the Practice of our Churches in early Times. This Sermon was preached A. D. 1670. "In our first and best Times," says he, <Q>what pious Care was there for Sister Churches,—that
<PB N="14" REF="012857_0013_0F8B94325B770D38"/>in those that wanted Peace their Dissentions might be healed? What Readiness was there in those Days to <HI>call for the Help of Neighbouring Elders and Brethren,</HI> in case of any Difference or Division that could not be healed at home? What Reverence was there then of the <HI>Sentence of the Council,</HI> as being <HI>decisive,</HI> and <HI>issuing the Contro∣versy?</HI> According to that ancient proverbial Saying, <HI>They shall surely ask Counsel at Abel, and so they ended the Mat∣ter.</HI><NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Mather's Seasonable Testimony, page 15.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>Synod</HI> of 1662. In that venerable Assembly, we have Authority from Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> who was one of the Elders in it, to assert, that in Answer to the Question about Consociation of Churches, there was a marvellous Unanimity; not <HI>one Elder,</HI> nor so much as <HI>two Brethren</HI> in all that Reverend Assembly <HI>dissenting.</HI> In this Sy∣nod it was directed, that <HI>Churches do seek and accept Help from, and give Help to, each other in Matters of more than or∣dinary Importance, as Ordination, Translation, and Deposition of Elders.</HI> <Q>Agreably to which, (says the Doctor) the Laws of the Colony once required the Approbation of <HI>three, or four Churches,</HI> to every <HI>Ordination.</HI><NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Seasonable Test. p. 10.</NOTE></Q> And those Divines who have <HI>seemed to be Pillars</HI> in the revived <HI>Congregational Discipline,</HI> espoused by our Churches, have generally expressed the same Concern, that the <HI>Usage</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Ecclesiastical Councils might be maintained.</HI> The Synod at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> earnestly asserts, <Q>That it is according to the Mind of Christ, that Churches holding Commu∣nion together, do by their Messengers meet in a Synod, or Council, to consider and give Advice—on <HI>such Occasions</HI> as the Churches in this Country have also thought proper to come under such a Cognizance.</Q> The <HI>Deposition</HI> of an <HI>Elder</HI> is one of those Matters of <HI>more than ordinary Importance,</HI> which this our <HI>New-England</HI> Synod has deter∣mined to require the <HI>Help of other Churches.</HI> In such a
<PB N="15" REF="012857_0014_0F8B94348BE2E860"/>Case the Synod has also determined, that it is the Duty of a Church, not only to <HI>seek,</HI> but to <HI>accept</HI> the Help of other Churches. It does not appear that this Synod ever thought any Church would proceed to depose their <HI>Elder,</HI> when a Council of Churches had <HI>advised his Continuance in the El∣dership.</HI> The Doctor goes on, <Q>The famous Apologists, Dr. <HI>F. Goodwin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> Mr. <HI>Simpson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bridge,</HI> assert an Obligation hereunto, in the <HI>common Law of Communion of Churches.</HI> Yea, they profess, they look upon it as the most to be abhorred Maxim, and the most contradictory and dishonorable to Christianity, that a single and particular Society of Men professing the Name of Christ, and pretending to be endowed with Power from Christ, should arrogate to themselves an Exemption from giving an Account, or being censurable by Neighbour Churches about them. So far (say these super-eminent Divines of the Congregational Way) were our Judgments from that <HI>Independent</HI> Liberty, which has been imputed to us.</Q></P>
<P>As we have now mentioned the Sentiments of these fa∣mous Apologists, who were not of this Country, it may not be amiss to add the Opinion of the great and good Doctor <HI>Owen,</HI> on this Occasion. We do it the rather, because he has ever been held in high Estimation among us, and also on Account of his having altered his Sentiments respecting Church Discipline, on his reading the celebrated <HI>Cotton</HI> on <HI>the Keys.</HI> In several of his Treatises he has advanced Posi∣tions of the same Aspect, on the <HI>Necessity and Authority</HI> of regular Councils, for the Welfare of particular Churches, with those already alledged by us. In one of his former, he says,<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Catech. p. 224.</NOTE> <Q>Churches ought to preserve a mutual, holy Communion, and exercise it in making Use of the <HI>Advice</HI> of one another. And in Case any Churches give Offence to other Churches, other Churches may require an Ac∣count of them, admonish them for their Faults, and with∣hold
<PB N="16" REF="012857_0015_0F8B943554A293D8"/>Communion from them, in Case they persist in the Error of their Way; and that because in their Difficul∣ties, and before their Miscarriages, they were <HI>bound</HI> to have <HI>desired the Advice of other Churches;</HI> which being neglected by them, the others are to recover the End of it to the utmost of their Ability.</Q> In another of his Treatises<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Nat of Ch. part 2. p. 251.</NOTE> the Doctor has these memorable Words, <Q>No Church is <HI>so Independent,</HI> as that it can always, and in all Cases, observe the Duty it owes unto the Lord Christ, and the Church catholic by all those Powers, which it is able to <HI>act in itself distinctly,</HI> without a <HI>Conjunction with others.</HI> And the Church which confines its Duty unto the Acts of its own Assemblies, cuts itself off from the external Communion of the Church catholic: Nor will it be safe for any Man to commit the Conduct of his Soul to such a Church.—Every particular Church, which extends not its Duty beyond its own Assemblies and Members, is fallen off from the principal End of its Insti∣tution. And every Principle, Opinion, or Persuasion that inclines any Church to <HI>confine</HI> its Care and Duty unto its own Edification only—<HI>is Schismatical.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Sentiment of Doctor <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> on the Subject under Consideration, fully appears from the Conclusion he draws from the immediately preceding Authorities, which he used on a special Occasion; as well as from some other Declarations, which we shall hereafter notice. His words are these,<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Seasonable Testimony, p. 15.</NOTE> <Q>From whence it will follow, that if any Church presume to transact their more <HI>weighty Affairs,</HI> and such as are of <HI>common Concern</HI> to the Churches in their Neigh∣bourhood, with a Contempt of such <HI>Councils</HI> of them as ought to be advised withal; or if they shall upon <HI>grie∣vous Differences</HI> arisen among them, refuse the <HI>Advice</HI> of those who urge them to make Use of the Remedy, which
<PB N="17" REF="012857_0016_0F8B943582ED92A0"/>the Want of <HI>Light and Peace</HI> among them calleth for; And <HI>much more,</HI> if they shall <HI>proceed in Matters</HI> after the neighbouring Churches have signified that they <HI>cannot countenance</HI> their Proceedings; these Churches will be far from expressing the <HI>Wisdom</HI> which is with the <HI>well-ad∣vised,</HI> and will sin against the second and third Com∣mandments; and will practically go too far towards <HI>ex∣cluding</HI> themselves from Communion with the Churches of the <HI>Faithful.</HI> Indeed, the more <HI>Synods and Councils</HI> are disregarded and slighted, so much the more <HI>Disorder</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> will (we fear) grow and prevail in all the Churches in the Country; which GOD of his infinite Mercy prevent.</Q>—The Doctor speaking of the <HI>Remo∣val</HI> of a Pastor, in the same Treatise, has this memorable Passage, fully expressive of his own Sentiments.<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">p. 3, 4.</NOTE> <Q>It is requisite, that the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the <HI>Removal</HI> be laid before <HI>authentick Judges;</HI> even such as may be most likely to pass an <HI>impartial Judgment</HI> upon them; and by these be pronounced such, that the <HI>Removal</HI> thereupon may be just∣ly and wisely proceeded in. And, where it can be obtain∣ed, we think, that nothing less than a Council of Chur∣ches in the Neighbourhood, should have the Mat∣ter laid before them. For, if such a <HI>Council</HI> be, accord∣ing to the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of these Churches, always convened, for the <HI>Ordaining</HI> of a <HI>Pastor,</HI> it stands to Rea∣son, that there should as much be requisite for his <HI>Remov∣ing;</HI> it being, as it was by a very considerable Number of eminent Divines on a great Occasion in these Churches once pronounced. <HI>A very considerable Act of the Kingly Government exercised by our Lord Jesus Christ, in his Churches.</HI></Q> From this Citation it is evidently the Opini∣on of the Doctor, that the <HI>Removal</HI> of a Pastor, if it be on∣ly to the Charge of another Church, ought not, for the Rea∣sons given, to be effected, without the Advice and Con∣sent of Neighbouring Churches. His Reasons more
<PB N="18" REF="012857_0017_0F8B943642A9ABD0"/>strongly conclude for the Necessity of such Advice and Con∣sent, in the <HI>Deposition</HI> of a Pastor.</P>
<P>Anno 1700 the Doctor published a Treatise, under the Title of <HI>The Order of the Gospel.</HI> In this Treatise several Questions, relating to Church Discipline, are accurately dis∣cussed. The tenth Question is in these Words, <Q>Is it ex∣pedient that Churches should enter into a Consociation, or Agreement, that Matters of <HI>more than ordinary Impor∣tance,</HI> such as the Gathering of a new Church, the Ordi∣nation, DEPOSITION, or Translation of <HI>a Pastor</HI> be done with <HI>common Consent?</HI></Q> The Dr. in answer, replies, <HI>This is both expedient and</HI> NECESSARY: And he assigns a Number of weighty Reasons in Support of his Opinion, which are not necessary to be rehearsed. We do not produce this Authority, in order to shew the Dr's Sentiments on the Subject under Consideration, <HI>that</HI> having been sufficiently done already: but we do it, on Account of the Attestation given to this Book by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> and the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI> of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> in a Testimo∣ny they published when they were just leaving the World; which Testimony is annexed by Mr. <HI>Wise</HI> to his <HI>Vindication,</HI> and spoken of by him with great Respect. The former of these Gentlemen had been 70, and the other 60 Years in the Country when they left this their dying Testimony. They must for this Reason have known the Practice of our Churches from the Beginning.—Their Words are these—</P>
<P><Q>It was a Joy to us, to see and read a Book, which the Reverend President of our College [Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>] lately published, under the Title of, <HI>The Order of the Gospel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and practised by the Churches of Christ in New-England:</HI> A Book most highly needful, and useful, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; a most elaborate and well-composed Work, and well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into these two worthy Designs; 1st. the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Congregational Church Discipline; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the maintaining the sweet Spirit of Charity and Communion towards reforming Presbyterians, who are our
<PB N="19" REF="012857_0018_0F8B9436FA1AFC18"/>united Brethren. But we must here-withal testify, that in that worthy Book, there is nothing <HI>obtruded upon the Churches,</HI> but what they who were here capable of observ∣ing what was done <HI>sixty</HI> Years ago, do know to have been <HI>professed and practised in the Churches of New-England;</HI> (except in one or two) THEN AND EVER SINCE, until of <HI>late,</HI> some who were not then born, have <HI>suggested other∣wise.</HI> Yea, it is well known, that the Churches <HI>then</HI> publickly maintained these Principles, in several judicious Discourses, which were never confuted by any Man what∣ever, unto this present Time.</Q></P>
<P>What were the Practices in which these <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> Chur∣ches deviated from the rest of the Churches, these Gentle∣men have not declared; neither have they informed us what those things were which they speak of, as having been <HI>of late suggested,</HI> contrary to the Principles and Practice of the Churches. But it is certain, they neither of them respect the Power of a particular Church to <HI>depose its Pastor,</HI> with∣out the <HI>Advice and Consent</HI> of a <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>neighbouring Churches.</HI> For Doctor <HI>Mather,</HI> in his <HI>Disquisition concern∣ing Ecclesiastical Councils,</HI> speaking of <HI>Congregational Disci∣pline,</HI> has the following Passage, worthy the Attention of those who are desirous of preserving our <HI>ancient</HI> Church Discipline.<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Pref. p. 9.</NOTE> "It has ever," says the Doctor, "been their [our Churches] Judgment, that where there is Want of either <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Peace</HI> in a particular Church, it is their <HI>Du∣ty to ask for Council,</HI> with which Neighbour Churches ought to assist by sending their Elders, and other Messengers, to ad∣vise and help them in their Difficulties. And that in momentous Matters of common Concernment, particular Churches <HI>should proceed with the Concurrence</HI> of Neighbour Churches. So in the <HI>Ordination of a Pastor,</HI> MUCH MORE in the DEPOSING <HI>of one.</HI> THUS IT HAS EVER BEEN <HI>in the Churches of New-England.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="012857_0019_0F8B9437EE9022B0"/>
It is evident from the preceding Quotations, that the venerable Fathers of these Churches, agree in Opinion, that Matters of more than ordinary Weight and Importance, and those of common Concernment ought not to be transacted without Advice of Council. And many of them are ex∣press in asserting, that the Deposition of an Elder, or Pas∣tor, is a Matter of such Weight and Importance, as to re∣quire the Counsel and Advice of neighbouring Churches.— We do not find, on the most careful Enquiry, a single In∣stance of any Congregational Church from the first Settle∣ment of the Country to the present Day, which has depo∣sed or dismissed its Teaching Elder, or Pastor, without the Advice of a Council of neighbouring Churches; except when a Dismission has been effected by the mutual Consent of the Elder and Church. And, even in this Case, it ap∣pears from what has been before adduced, that such Dis∣mission is irregular, and contrary to the Constitution of these Churches.</P>
<P>We cannot forbear, on this Occasion, in the Meekness and Gentleness of Christ, earnestly to advise these Chur∣ches, of our Lord Jesus Christ in this land, attentively to consider the Noble and truly Christian Plan, upon which our Fathers have placed us; and to preserve that Uni∣on, which they had so much at Heart, as our truest Strength and Glory; and which is so necessary to pre∣serve the Purity of the Ministry, and the Privileges of the Fraternity, both of which we are equally solicitous to support; and as a special Means of this, to seek the Advice of neighbouring Churches in all Matters of common Concernment, more particularly those of peculiar Weight and Importance, and when it is afforded them to receive it with Meekness, seriously and impartially to consider it, and not lightly to depart from it, or pertinaciously to oppose it; reflecting how earnestly our Fathers recommended this as a Gospel Institution for conveying Light and Peace to the Church; and what fatal Consequences Inattention to, and much more a Contempt of such an Institution is likely to produce.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="012857_0020_0F8B9438792D38E8"/>
From the same Considerations, we trust, the Churches will be ever ready to afford their Assistance and Counsel to Sis∣ter Churches, in all Seasons of Darkness and Perplexity, and to act on such Occasions with Deliberation, Impartiality, and Solemnity, considering how much the Honour of Christ, and the Peace and Welfare of his Churches may depend on their Results.</P>
