<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's LIFE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>STEPHEN DUCK,</HI> the Author of the following Poems, was born in the year 1705, near the seat of <HI>Pe∣ter Bathurst,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at <HI>Clarendon Park,</HI> in the county of <HI>Wilts,</HI> of parents remarkable only for their honesty and industry. However, we find he had some small share of reading and writing bestowed on him, with very little or no grammar: For before he had reached his <HI>syntaxis,</HI> his mother had a very notable complaint exhibited against him by his Schoolmaster, viz. <HI>That he took his Learning too fast, even faster than the master could give it him.</HI> So that the prudent parent, to prevent so growing an evil, removed her son from School to the Plough, lest he might become too fine a gentleman for the family that produced him.</P>
<P>The seeds of learning being once sowed in our young plowman, there was no possibility of weeding them out: for the labour of his mind generally accompanied that of his body. <HI>Milton</HI> was his constant companion in the field and the barn: He had likewise made himself mas∣ter of a set of the <HI>Spectators,</HI> and <HI>Bailey's English Diction∣ary.</HI> Our Author, thus equipped, ascends the Hill of <HI>Parnassus.</HI></P>
<P>The courteous reader must be informed that our Poet is to be unhappily numbered amongst those men, whose <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>fine parts</HI> are not able to give their yoke∣mates that <HI>satisfaction</HI> and <HI>content,</HI> which a weak mind with a vigorous constitution is generally apt to do. How∣ever, he has had three children born to him in wedlock; at the christening of the last child, one of the good wo∣men happened to blab it out to the reverend gentleman who performed the ceremony, <HI>That Mr.</HI> Duck <HI>was a man of great learning, and had wit enough to be a parson; for that he could make verses like any man, and as good as ever she heard in her life.</HI> Upon the recommendation of this wise woman, the doctor who is a dignified person in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> had some discourse with Mr. <HI>Duck,</HI> and gave him a theme, with some directions for the improvement of his genius: But when Mr. <HI>Duck</HI> had finished his Verses, and presented them to him for his approbation, the Doctor recommended them to the
<PB N="iv" REF="025421_0003_0FCD2A5843EFF710"/>
flames. This was a most cruel discouragement; so that for a long time after he was almost out of conceit with himself, and went on writing and burning, and his wife continually scolding, because he neglected his labour: And when he was <HI>scanning</HI> his lines, she would oftentimes run out and raise the whole neighbourhood, telling the people, <HI>That her Husband dealt with the Devil, and was going mad because he did nothing all day but talk to himself, and tell his Fingers.</HI></P>
<P>But mangre this ill situation of his poetical affairs, his fame at length began to rouse the Wits of <HI>Wiltshire</HI> to some consideration of him, and he was admitted to the tables of a great many worthy gentlemen. He now wrote his Poem called the <HI>Shunamite,</HI> that on <HI>Poverty,</HI> and the <HI>Thresher's Labour;</HI> which were handed about the coun∣try with great applause, in manuscript. A copy was sent to the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Tankerville</HI> at <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> where the Honourable Mrs. <HI>Clayton,</HI> of her Majesty's Bed-chamber, happening to see it, that Lady immediate∣ly presented it to the Queen: The Verses became in much reputation at Court by all judges of Poetry; and the Author was then sent for to <HI>Windsor,</HI> where her Ma∣jesty was graciously pleased to declare, <HI>she would allow him Thirty Guineas a year, and a little House at Richmond, till he should be better provided for.</HI></P>
<P>He was asked by a Noble Earl to write upon the <HI>Sun,</HI> but said, That <HI>as he had no true knowledge, nor had read any thing of the nature of that great Luminary, he was at present uncapable of such a task.</HI> He has read <HI>Milton</HI> with such attention, (whom he esteems the first of the <HI>English</HI> Poets) that he can repeat the whole book by heart. The <HI>Spectators,</HI> he says, were of singular use to him, and <HI>Bai∣ley</HI>'s <HI>English Dictionary</HI> instructed him in the significa∣tion of all words which he thought <HI>uncouth.</HI> He gave such answers as were entirely satisfactory to those who might have any suspicion that the Poems were wrote by some other person; and as he readily accounted for every thing that seemed extraordinary, it is demonstrable he walks in no other <HI>Stilts</HI> than those of his own Genius, which has justly rendered him the admiration of the pre∣sent age.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>SHUNAMITE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEIGN, Heav'nly Muses to assist my Song:</L>
<L>To Heav'nly Muses Heav'nly Themes belong.</L>
<L>But chiefly thou, O God, my soul inspire,</L>
<L>And touch my lips with thy celestial fire:</L>
<L>If thou delight'st in flow'ry <HI>Carmel</HI>'s shade,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Jordan</HI>'s stream, from thence I crave thy aid:</L>
<L>Instruct my tongue, and my low accents raise,</L>
<L>To sing thy w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders, and display thy praise;</L>
<L>And make th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inhabitants of <HI>Judah</HI>'s land</L>
<L>Give ear, and <HI>Israel</HI> to my voice attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when the <HI>Shunamite</HI> had made her pray'r,</L>
<L>The crouds promiscuous throng'd around to hear</L>
<L>Th' amazing tale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while thus her joyful tongue,</L>
<L>Mov'd by the Heav'nly pow'r, began the song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Attend, ye seed of <HI>Abram,</HI> and give ear,</L>
<L>Whilst I <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s glorious acts declare:</L>
<L>From that great source of pow'r what wonders spring,</L>
<L>If he assist my lays, my muse shall sing.</L>
<L>My Lord and I, to whom all bounteous Heav'n</L>
<L>His blessings with no sparing hand had giv'n,</L>
<L>Like faithful stewards of our wealthy store,</L>
<L>Still lodg'd the stranger and reliev'd the poor,</L>
<L>And as <HI>Elisha,</HI> by divine command,</L>
<L>Came preaching virtue to a sinful land,</L>
<L>He often deign'd to lodge within our gate,</L>
<L>And oft receiv'd an hospitable treat;</L>
<L>A decent chamber we for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prepar'd;</L>
<L>And he, the generous labour to reward,</L>
<L>Honours in camp or court to us propos'd,</L>
<L>Which I refus'd, and thus my mind disclos'd;</L>
<L>Heav'n's king hath plac'd us in a fertile land,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="025421_0005_0FCD2A5CC4380C30"/>Where he show'rs down his gifts with copious hand;</L>
<L>Already we enjoy an affluent store,</L>
<L>Why should we be solicitous for more?</L>
<L>Give martial camps, and kingly courts to them</L>
<L>Who place their only bliss in fleeting fame;</L>
<L>There let them live in golden chains of state,</L>
<L>And be unhappy, only to be great.</L>
<L>But let us in our native soil remain,</L>
<L>Nor barter happiness for sordid gain.</L>
<L>Here we may feed the indigent in peace,</L>
<L>And cloath the bare with superfluous fleece,</L>
<L>And give the weary fainting pilgrim ease.</L>
<L>This we prefer to pomp, and formal show,</L>
<L>Which only serves to varnish o'er our woe;</L>
<L>Refulgent ornaments, which dress the proud,</L>
<L>Objects of wonder to the gazing croud;</L>
<L>Yet seldom give content or solid rest,</L>
<L>To the vain man by whom they are possess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All blessings, but a child, had Heav'n supply'd,</L>
<L>And only that, the Almighty had deny'd;</L>
<L>Which, when made known to the prophetic Seer,</L>
<L>He said, and I before him did appear,</L>
<L>And the first moment I approach'd the room,</L>
<L>He gravely rose, and did new looks assume;</L>
<L>Not such a wildness and fanatic mien,</L>
<L>With which some say, the <HI>Delphic</HI> priests are seen,</L>
<L>When they for mysteries of <HI>fate</HI> explain</L>
<L>The odd <HI>cimaera's</HI> of a frantic brain;</L>
<L>But with a grave majestic air he stood,</L>
<L>And more than human in his aspect glow'd:</L>
<L>Celestial grace sat on his radiant look,</L>
<L>And pow'r diffusive shone before he spoke.</L>
<L>Then thus: Hail generous soul! thy pious cares.</L>
<L>Are not forgot, nor fruitless are thy pray'rs:</L>
<L>Propitious Heav'n, thy virtuous deeds to crown,</L>
<L>Shall make thy barren womb conceive a son.</L>
<L>So spake the Seer, and to complete my joy,</L>
<L>As he had said, I bore the promis'd boy.</L>
<L>Soon to my friends the welcome news was known,</L>
<L>Who crouded in a-pace to view my son;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="025421_0006_0FCD2A5ED4A13C18" MS="y"/>Surpriz'd, to hear my unexpected bliss,</L>
<L>And each rejoices for my happiness.</L>
<L>When all had said, I mov'd my joyful tongue,</L>
<L>And thus, to God, address'd my grateful song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O God! What eloquence can sing thy praise;</L>
<L>Or who can fathom thy stupendous ways?</L>
<L>All things obey at thy divine command,</L>
<L>Thou mak'st a fruitful field of barren land:</L>
<L>The' obdurate rock a fertile glebe shall be,</L>
<L>And bring forth copious crops, if bid by thee;</L>
<L><HI>Arabia</HI>'s Desert shall with plenty smile,</L>
<L>And fruitful vines adorn th' uncultivated soil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thus she spake, her audiance raise their voice,</L>
<L>And interrupt her song, as they rejoice.</L>
<L>O God! We gladly hear thy mighty pow'r,</L>
<L>And joyfully thy gracious name adore:</L>
<L>All nature is subservient to thy word,</L>
<L>And shifts her wonted course t' obey her lord.</L>
<L>We, for thy servant's joy, our thanks express;</L>
<L>As grows the child, so let her bliss increase;</L>
<L>And may thy delegate, who did preside</L>
<L>Over his native hour, his actions guide!</L>
<L>And, ye protecting Angels, that do still</L>
<L>Wait round the bless'd, preserve him from all ill;</L>
<L>Inspire his soul with virtue whilst on earth,</L>
<L>And be his watchful guardians until death,</L>
<L>Then safely bear—The dame here wav'd her hand,</L>
<L>The people straight obey the mute command:</L>
<L>All silent stand, and all attentive look,</L>
<L>Waiting her words, while thus she mournful spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All pleasures are imperfect here below;</L>
<L>Our sweetest joys are mixt with bitter woe:</L>
<L>And while we wait our growing happiness,</L>
<L>Some sudden grief destroys the rising bliss.</L>
<L>E'er fourteen years were measur'd by my son,</L>
<L>(So soon alas! the greatest blessing's gone)</L>
<L>He in the harvest to the reapers goes,</L>
<L>To view the bearded sheaves erect in rows;</L>
<L>Like an embattled army in the field;</L>
<L>(A new delightful prospect to the child!)</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="025421_0007_0FCD2A5FCE0ED8B0"/>But either there the scorching sun display'd</L>
<L>His heat intense, and on his vitals prey'd;</L>
<L>Or sudden blast, or apoplectic pain,</L>
<L>With racking torture seiz'd his tender brain:</L>
<L>His spirits fail'd, he straight began to faint,</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainly to his father made complaint.</L>
<L>The glowing rose was quickly seen to fade,</L>
<L>At once, his beauty and his life decay'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon, at my house, the dismal news I heard;</L>
<L>Soon, at my house, the dying child appear'd.</L>
<L>T' embrace him I with fond affection run,</L>
<L>And O! said I, what pain afflicts my son?</L>
<L>He try'd to speak; but fault'ring gave a groan:</L>
<L>No perfect word proceeded from his tongue,</L>
<L>But on his lips the broken accents hung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All means I us'd that might allay his pain,</L>
<L>And strove to give him ease, but strove in vain:</L>
<L>Short, and more short he drew his rosy breath,</L>
<L>Too sure presage of his approaching death.</L>
<L>The blood congeal'd the heaving heart beat low;</L>
<L>And his head dropt with a declining bow:</L>
<L>Thrice from my breast to raise himself he try'd,</L>
<L>And thrice sunk down again, and groaning dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, when with care we've nurs'd a beauteous vine,</L>
<L>And taught the docile branches where to twine:</L>
<L>An Eastern gale, or some pernicious frost,</L>
<L>Nips the young tree, and all our labour's lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With horror chill'd, a-while aghast I stood</L>
<L>Viewing the child, and trembling as I view'd:</L>
<L>My eyes discharg'd their humid store a-pace,</L>
<L>And tear succeeded tear a-down my face:</L>
<L>Scarce my dilated heart the grief sustain'd;</L>
<L>At length, recovering speech, I thus complain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O fleeting joys, inconstant as the wind,</L>
<L>That only for a moment please the mind,</L>
<L>Then fly, and leave a weight of woe behind!</L>
<L>But yet in vain I thus lament and mourn,</L>
<L>The Soul once fled shall never more return;</L>
<L>And the fair body now must be convey'd</L>
<L>To earth's dark bosom, and eternal shade.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="025421_0008_0FCD2A614622A208" MS="y"/>Yet let me not prescribe a bound to Heav'n,</L>
<L>'Twas by a miracle the child was giv'n;</L>
<L>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n I think the wonder is more great,</L>
<L>If the departed soul resumes her seat.</L>
<L>What if I to <HI>Mount Carmel</HI> haste away,</L>
<L>To him who did his mystic birth display?</L>
<L>His pow'rful word the barren fruitful made:</L>
<L>His pow'rful word, perhaps, may raise the dead.</L>
<L>The famous <HI>Tishbile</HI> rais'd a widow's son:</L>
<L><HI>Elisha</HI> has as wondrous actions done.</L>
<L>When he to <HI>Jordan's</HI> rapid torrent came,</L>
<L>He with the <HI>mantle</HI> smote th' impetuous stream;</L>
<L>Obsequious to the stroke, the waves divide,</L>
<L>And raise a liquid wall on either side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At <HI>Jericho,</HI> long had the barren soil</L>
<L>Deceiv'd the husbandman, and mock'd his toil;</L>
<L>Yet at his word it grew a fertile field,</L>
<L>And pois'nous springs did wholesome waters yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only such great blessings send,</L>
<L>But curses, if invok'd, on him attend:</L>
<L>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> how at <HI>Bethel</HI> call'd he vengeance down,</L>
<L>At a just scourge on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pprobrious town?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again, when <HI>Moa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> peace with <HI>Israel</HI> broke,</L>
<L>And vainly strove to quit the servile yoke:</L>
<L>Our pow'rful Kings led forth th' embattled host</L>
<L>Thro' <HI>Edom</HI>'s sultry wilds and air adust,</L>
<L>Where the confed'rate troops no water found;</L>
<L>Dry were the springs, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was the ground.</L>
<L>The captain's wanted strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> courage fail'd,</L>
<L>When thirst and foes at once the host assail'd.</L>
<L>The kings to him their joint petitions made,</L>
<L>And fainting soldi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ crav'd his timely aid;</L>
<L>Nor crav'd in vain▪ The pow'rful word he spake,</L>
<L>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing waters form'd a spacious lake;</L>
<L>The shining streams advance their humid train,</L>
<L>And <HI>Edom</HI>'s wilds soon grow a liquid plain.</L>
<L>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in more plenty did the waters run</L>
<L>Out of the rock, when struck by <HI>Amram</HI>'s son.</L>
<L>And who can that amazing act forget,</L>
<L>Which he perform'd to pay the widow's debt?</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="025421_0009_0FCD2A63797D54B8"/>Whose quantity of oil one pot contain'd,</L>
<L>Yet num'rous vessels fill'd before 'twas drain'd,</L>
<L>Then he who such stupendous acts has done,</L>
<L>If God propitious prove, can raise my son.</L>
<L>So saying, up I caught the child with speed,</L>
<L>And laid it on the sacred prophet's bed:</L>
<L>Then call'd my servant to prepare the steed.</L>
<L>Pensive and sad, my mourning husband said,</L>
<L>Fain would I from this journey thee dissuade:</L>
<L>No God to-day the prophet does inspire,</L>
<L>Nor can he aught reveal thou dost require.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To whom thus I:</L>
<L>Rather than sink, attempt my hopes to raise,</L>
<L>Tell me no more of ceremonial days,</L>
<L>His God is present still, and hears him when he prays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus said: urging my steed with eager haste,</L>
<L>Swift as the mountain roe, the plains I past;</L>
<L>O'er hills and dales my journey I pursu'd,</L>
<L>Nor slack'd my pace till flow'ry <HI>Carmel</HI> view'd:</L>
<L>On whose delightful brow, in cool retreat</L>
<L>Among the curling vines, the prophet sat,</L>
<L>Whose twining arms a beauteous arbour made;</L>
<L>The beauteous arbour form'd a grateful shade:</L>
<L>The fanning <HI>Zephyrs</HI> gently play'd around,</L>
<L>And shook the trembling leaves, and swept the ground;</L>
<L>Down humbly at his feet I prostrate fell,</L>
<L>Submiss, and weeping, told the mournful tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Calm and compose thy anxious mind, said he,</L>
<L>Tears can't revoke th' Almighty's fix'd decree.</L>
<L>We live and die, and both as he thinks fit;</L>
<L>He may command, but mortals must submit.</L>
<L>Death is a debt we all to nature owe,</L>
<L>And not an evil, but when counted so.</L>
<L>Yet if of Heav'n I can my suit obtain,</L>
<L>Thy child shall live, and thou rejoice again.</L>
<L>Thus said, with looks divine his staff he views,</L>
<L>As if some pow'rful charm he wou'd infuse;</L>
<L>Then calls his servant hastily, and said,</L>
<L>On the child's face see this discreetly laid.</L>
<L>Th' obsequious servant his command obey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="025421_0010_0FCD2A6509BBC2A0" MS="y"/>
<L>O thou, said I, on whom my hope depends,</L>
<L>Do not transfer this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork to servants hand!</L>

<L>Here to the list'ning vines, I'll vent my woe;</L>
<L>Still prostrate lie, lamenting for my son,</L>
<L>'Till ev'ry hill prove vocal to my moon.</L>
<L>More had I said, but grief the words sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss'd;</L>
<L>Yet sighs and silent tears explain'd the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length be from his verdant seat aro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>And hastily adown the mountain goes</L>
<L>To <HI>Shunem,</HI> we with speed our way pursue,</L>
<L>The city soon appears within our view;</L>
<L>And the returning servant at the gate,</L>
<L>Pensive and sad without success, we met:</L>
<L>The beauteous child by death still vanquish'd lay;</L>
<L>Still death insulted o'er the beauteous prey:</L>
<L>'Till to the house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sacred Seer was come,</L>
<L>And with supernal pow'r approach'd the room.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By the dead child a-while he pensive stood,</L>
<L>Then from the chamber put the mourning crowd:</L>
<L>That done, to God he made his ardent pray'r,</L>
<L>And breath'd upon the child with vital air:</L>
<L>And now the soul resumes her pristine seat,</L>
<L>And now the heart begins again to beat;</L>
<L>A second life diffuses o'er the dead,</L>
<L>And death, repuls'd, inglorious doth recede.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when a prowling wolf had stol'n a lamb,</L>
<L>He sternly guards it from the blea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing dam;</L>
<L>But if the keeper comes, he quits his prey,</L>
<L>And, lowring, with reluctance makes away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the prophet to my longing arms</L>
<L>Resigns the child, with more than wonted charms;</L>
<L>The blushy rose shone fresher in his face,</L>
<L>And beauty smil'd with a superior grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when Heav'n's lamp that rules the genial day,</L>
<L>Behind the sable moon pursues his way,</L>
<L>Affrighted mortals, when th' eclipse is o'er,</L>
<L>Believe him more illustrious than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here ends the dame, and the promiscuous throng,</L>
<L>With Hallelujahs thus conclude the song:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="025421_0011_0FCD2A6686E6EFF0"/>Righteous and good art thou, Lord God of Host,</L>

<L>Thou moon, and ye less glitt'ring orbs that dance</L>
<L>Round this terrestrial globe, his praise advance:</L>
<L>Ye liquid seas, still waving to and fro,</L>
<L>Praise when ye ebb, and praise him when ye flow:</L>
<L>Ye wandring rivers, and each purling stream,</L>
<L>As ye pursue your course, his praise proclaim:</L>
<L>Ye dews, and mists, and humid vapours, all</L>
<L>Praise when ye rise, and praise him when ye fall:</L>

<HEAD>THE <HI>THRESHER</HI>'s <HI>LABOUR.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE grateful tribute of these rural lays,</L>
<L>Which to her patron's hand the muse conveys,</L>
<L>Deign to accept; 'tis just she tribute bring</L>
<L>To him whose bounty gives her life to sing:</L>
<L>To him whose generous favours tune her voice,</L>
<L>And bid her 'midst her poverty rejoice.</L>
<L>Inspir'd by these, she dares herself prepare</L>
<L>To sing the toils of each revolving year:</L>
<L>Those endless toils, which always grow anew,</L>
<L>And the poor <HI>Thresher</HI>'s destin'd to pursue;</L>
<L>Ev'n these with pleasure can the muse rehearse,</L>
<L>When you, and gratitude, command the verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the harvest hath laid bare the plains,</L>
<L>And barns well fill'd reward the farmer's pains;</L>
<L>What corn each sheaf will yield, intent to hear,</L>
<L>And guess from thence the profits of the year;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="025421_0012_0FCD2A6808273438" MS="y"/>Or else impending ruin to prevent,</L>
<L>By paying, timely, threat'ning landlord's rent,</L>
<L>He calls his threshers forth: Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd we stand,</L>
<L>With deep attention waiting his command:</L>
<L>To each our tasks he readily divides,</L>
<L>And pointing, to our different stations, guides,</L>
<L>As he directs, to different barns we go;</L>
<L>Here two for wheat, and there for barley two.</L>
<L>But first to shew, what he expects to find,</L>
<L>These words, or words like these disclose his mind:</L>
<L>So dry the corn was carry'd from the field,</L>
<L>So easily 'twill thresh, so well 'twill yield;</L>
<L>Sure large day's work I well may hope for now;</L>
<L>Come, strip, and try, let's see what you can do.</L>
<L>Divested of our cloaths, with frail in hand,</L>
<L>At a just distance, front to front we stand;</L>
<L>And first the threshald's gently swung, to prove,</L>
<L>Whether with just exactness, it will move:</L>
<L>That once secure, more quick we whirl them round,</L>
<L>From the strong planks our crab-tree staves rebound,</L>
<L>And echoing barns return the rattling sound.</L>
<L>Now in the air our knotty weapon's fly;</L>
<L>And now with equal force descend from high:</L>
<L>Down one, one up, so well they keep the time,</L>
<L>The <HI>Cyclops</HI> hammers could not truer chime;</L>
<L>Nor with more heavy strokes could <HI>Aetna</HI> groan,</L>
<L>When <HI>Vulcan</HI> forg'd the arms for <HI>Thetis'</HI> son.</L>
<L>In briny streams our sweat descends a-pace,</L>
<L>Drops from our locks, or trickles down our face,</L>
<L>No intermission in our works we know;</L>
<L>The noisy threshal must for ever go.</L>
<L>Their master absent, others safely play:</L>
<L>The sleeping threshal doth itself betray.</L>
<L>Nor yet the tedious labour to beguile.</L>
<L>And make the passing minutes sweetly smile,</L>
<L>Can we, like shepherds, tell a merry tale?</L>
<L>The voice is lost, drown'd by the noisy flail.</L>
<L>But we may think—Alas! what pleasing thing</L>
<L>Here to the mind can the dull fancy bring?</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="025421_0013_0FCD2A69864D9A08"/>The Eye beholds no pleasant object here:</L>
<L>No chearful sound diverts the list'ning Ear.</L>
<L>The Shepherd well may tune his voice to sing,</L>
<L>Inspir'd by all the beauties of the Spring:</L>
<L>No Fountains murmur here, no Lambkins play,</L>
<L>No linnets warble, and no fields look gay;</L>
<L>'Tis all a dull and melancholy scene,</L>
<L>Fit only to provoke the Muses spleen.</L>
<L>When sooty Pease we thresh, you scarce can know</L>
<L>Our native colour, as from work we go;</L>
<L>The sweat and dust, and suffocating smoke,</L>
<L>Make us so much like <HI>Ethiopians</HI> look:</L>
<L>We scare our wives, when ev'ning brings us home;</L>
<L>And frighted infants think the Bug-bear come.</L>
<L>Week after week we this dull task pursue,</L>
<L>Unless when winnowing days produce a new;</L>
<L>A new indeed but frequently a worse,</L>
<L>The Threshal yield but to the master's curse.</L>
<L>He counts the bushels, counts how much a day,</L>
<L>Then swears we've idled half our time away.</L>
<L>Why look ye, Rogues! D'ye think that this will do?</L>
<L>Your neighbours thresh as much again as you.</L>
<L>Now in our hands we wish our noisy tools,</L>
<L>To drown the hated names of rogues and fools;</L>
<L>But wanting those, we just like School boys look,</L>
<L>When th' angry master views the blotted book:</L>
<L>They cry their Ink was faulty and their pen;</L>
<L>We, the Corn threshes bad, 'twas cut too green.</L>
<L>But now the winter hides his hoary head,</L>
<L>And Natur's face is with new beauty spread;</L>
<L>The Spring appears, and kind refreshing show'rs,</L>
<L>New clothe the field with grass, and deck with flow'rs.</L>
<L>Next her, the rip'ning Summer presses on,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sol</HI> begins his longest stage to run:</L>
<L>Before the door our welcome master stands,</L>
<L>And tells us the ripe grass requires our hands.</L>
<L>The long much-wish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d intelligence imparts</L>
<L>Life to our looks, and spirit to our hearts:</L>
<L>We wish the happy season may be fair,</L>
<L>And joyful, long to breathe in op'ner air.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="025421_0014_0FCD2A6D2B027B98" MS="y"/>This change of labour seems to give much ease;</L>
<L>And does, at least, imagination please.</L>
<L>With thoughts of happiness our joy's complete,</L>
<L>There's always bitter mingled with the sweet.</L>
<L>When morn does thro' the Eastern windows peep,</L>
<L>Straight from our beds we start, and shake off sleep;</L>
<L>This new employ with eager haste to prove,</L>
<L>This new employ becomes so much our love:</L>
<L>Alas! that human joys should change <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o soon,</L>
<L>Ev'n this may bear another face at noon!</L>
<L>The birds salute us as to work we go,</L>
<L>And a new life seems in our breast to glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>A cross one shoulder hangs a Scythe well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eel'd,</L>
<L>The weapon destin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to unclothe the field:</L>
<L>T'other supports the Whetstone, Scrip, and Beer;</L>
<L>That for our Scythes, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ourselves to chear.</L>
<L>And now the field design'd our strength to try</L>
<L>Appears, and meets at last our longing eye;</L>
<L>The grass and ground each chearfully surveys,</L>
<L>Willing to see which way th' advantage lies.</L>
<L>As the best man, each claims the foremost place,</L>
<L>And our first work seems but a sportive race.</L>
<L>With rapid force our well-whet blades we drive,</L>
<L>Strain ev'ry nerve, and blow for blow we give:</L>
<L>Tho' but this eminence the foremost gains,</L>
<L>Only t' excel the rest in toll and pains.</L>
<L>But when the scorching Sun is mounted high,</L>
<L>And no kind barns with friendly shades are nigh,</L>
<L>Our weary Scythes entangled in the grass,</L>
<L>And streams of sweat run trickling down a pace;</L>
<L>Our sportive labour we too late lament,</L>
<L>And wish that strength again we vainly spent.</L>
<L>Thus in the morn a Courser I have seen,</L>
<L>With headlong fury scour the level green,</L>
<L>Or mount the hills, if hills are in his way,</L>
<L>As if no labour could his fire allay,</L>
<L>Till the meridian Sun with sultry heat,</L>
<L>And piercing beams hath bath'd his sides in sweat;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="025421_0015_0FCD2A6EE8B84D18"/>The lengthen'd chace scarce able to sustain,</L>
<L>He measures back the hills and dales with pain.</L>
<L>With heat and labour tir'd, our Scythes we quit,</L>
<L>Search out a shady tree and down we sit;</L>
<L>From scrip and bottle hope new strength to gain;</L>
<L>But scrip and bottle too are try'd in vain.</L>
<L>Down our parch'd throats we scarce the bread can get,</L>
<L>And quite o'er-spent with toil but faintly eat;</L>
<L>Nor can the bottle only answer all,</L>
<L>Alas! the bottle and the beer's too small.</L>
<L>Our time slides on, we move from off the grass,</L>
<L>And each again betakes him to his place.</L>
<L>Not eager now, as late, our strength to prove,</L>
<L>But all contented regular to move:</L>
<L>Often we whet, as often view the Sun,</L>
<L>To see how near his tedious race is run;</L>
<L>At length he vails his radiant face from fight,</L>
<L>And bids the weary Traveller good-night▪</L>
<L>Homewards we move, but so much spent with toil,</L>
<L>We walk but slow, and rest at every stile.</L>
<L>Our good expecting wives, who think we stay,</L>
<L>Got to the door, soon eye us in the way;</L>
<L>Then from the pot the dumpling's catch'd in haste,</L>
<L>And homely by its side the bacon's plac'd.</L>
<L>Supper and sleep by morn new strength supply,</L>
<L>And out we set again our works to try:</L>
<L>But not so early quite, nor quite so fast,</L>
<L>As to our cost we did the morning past.</L>
<L>Soon as the rising Sun hath drank the dew,</L>
<L>Another scene is open'd to our view;</L>
<L>Our master comes, and at his heels a throng</L>
<L>Of prattling females, arm'd with rake and prong:</L>
<L>Prepar'd, whilst he is here, to make his hay;</L>
<L>Or, if he turns his back, prepar'd to play.</L>
<L>But here, or gone, sure of this comfort still,</L>
<L>Here's company, so they may chat their fill:</L>
<L>And we're their hands as active as their tongues,</L>
<L>How nimbly then would move their rakes and prongs?</L>
<L>The grass again is spread upon the ground,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="025421_0016_0FCD2A70498A6200" MS="y"/>Till not a vacant place is to be found;</L>
<L>And while the piercing Sun-beams on it shine,</L>
<L>The hay-makers have time allow'd to dine:</L>
<L>That soon dispatch'd, they still sit on the ground,</L>
<L>And the brisk chat renew'd, a-fresh goes round:</L>
<L>All talk at once, but seeming all to fear,</L>
<L>That all they speak so well, the rest won't hear;</L>
<L>By quick degrees so high their notes they strain,</L>
<L>That standers-by can nought distinguish plain:</L>
<L>So loud their speech, and so confus'd their noise,</L>
<L>Scarce puzzled echo can return a voice;</L>
<L>Yet spite of this, they bravely all go on,</L>
<L>Each scorns to be, or seem to be, outdone:</L>
<L>Till (unobserv'd before) a low'ring Sky,</L>
<L>Fraught with black clouds, proclaims a show'r nigh;</L>
<L>The tattling crowd can scarce their garments gain,</L>
<L>Before descends the thick impetuous rain:</L>
<L>Their noisy prattle all at once is done,</L>
<L>And to the hedge they all for shelter run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus have I seen on a bright summer's day,</L>
<L>On some green brake a flock of sparrows play;</L>
<L>From twig to twig, from bush to bush they fly,</L>
<L>And with continu'd chirping fill the sky;</L>
<L>But on a sudden, if a storm appears,</L>
<L>Their chirping noise no longer dins your ears;</L>
<L>They fly for shelter to the thickest bush,</L>
<L>There silent sit, and all at once is hush.</L>
<L>But better fate succeeds this rainy day,</L>
<L>And little labour serves to make the hay;</L>
<L>Fast as 'tis cut, so kindly shines the Sun,</L>
<L>Turn'd once or twice, the pleasing work is done</L>
<L>Next day the cocks appear in equal rows,</L>
<L>Which the glad master in safe reeks bestows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the field we must no longer range,</L>
<L>And yet, hard fate! still work for work we change.</L>
<L>Back to the barns again in haste we're sent,</L>
<L>Where lately so much time we pensive spent:</L>
<L>Not pensive now; we bless the friendly shade,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="025421_0017_0FCCE33BD46874F0"/>And to avoid the parching Sun are glad.</L>
<L>But few days here we're destin'd to remain,</L>
<L>Before our master calls us forth again:</L>
<L>For Harvest now, says he, yourselves prepare,</L>
<L>The ripen'd harvest now demands your care.</L>
<L>Early next morn I shall disturb your rest,</L>
<L>Get all things ready, and be quickly drest.</L>
<L>Strict to his word, scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dawn appears,</L>
<L>Before his hasty su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars.</L>
<L>Obedient to his call, straight up we get,</L>
<L>And finding soon our company complete;</L>
<L>With him, our guide, we to the Wheat-Field go;</L>
<L>He, to appoint, and we, the work to do.</L>
<L>Ye reapers, cast your eyes around the field,</L>
<L>And view the scene its different beauties yield:</L>
<L>Then look again with a more tender eye,</L>
<L>To think how soon it must in ruin lie.</L>
<L>For once set in, where'er our blows we deal,</L>
<L>There's no resisting of the well-whet steel:</L>
<L>But here or there, where'er our course we bend,</L>
<L>Sure desolation does our steps attend.</L>
<L>Thus, when <HI>Arabia</HI>'s sons, in hopes of prey,</L>
<L>To some more fertile country take their way;</L>
<L>How beauteous all things in the morn appear,</L>
<L>There Villages, and pleasing Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are here;</L>
<L>So many pleasing objects meet the sight,</L>
<L>The ravish'd eye could willing gaze 'till night:</L>
<L>But long e'er then, where'er their troops have past,</L>
<L>Those pleasant prospects lie a gloomy waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning past, we sweat beneath the Sun,</L>
<L>And but uneasily our work goes on.</L>
<L>Before us we perplexing thistles find,</L>
<L>And Corn blown adverse with the ruffling wind:</L>
<L>Behind our backs the female gleaners wait,</L>
<L>Who sometimes stoop, and sometimes hold a chat.</L>
<L>Each morn we early rise, go late to bed,</L>
<L>And lab'ring hard, a painful life we lead;</L>
<L>For toils, scarce ever ceasing, press us now,</L>
<L>Rest never does, but on the Sabbeth show,</L>
<L>And barely that, our master will allow.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="025421_0018_0FCD2A738C6B0BF0" MS="y"/>Nor, when asleep, are we secure from pain,</L>
<L>We then perform our labours o'er again:</L>
<L>Our mimic fancy always restless seems,</L>
<L>And what we act awake, she acts in dreams.</L>
<L>Hard fate! Our labours ev'n in sleep don't cease,</L>
<L>Scarce <HI>Hercules</HI> e'er felt such toils as these.</L>
<L>At length in rows stands up the well dry'd Corn,</L>
<L>A grateful seene, and ready for the barr.</L>
<L>Our well-pleas'd master views the sight with joy,</L>
<L>And we for carrying all our force employ.</L>
<L>Confusion soon o'er all the fields appear,</L>
<L>And stunning clamours fill the workmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars;</L>
<L>The bells, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hing whips, alternate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd,</L>
<L>And rattling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thunder o'er the ground.</L>
<L>The Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the Pease, and other grain,</L>
<L>Share the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and soon leave bare the plain:</L>
<L>In noisy triumph the last load moves on,</L>
<L>And loud huzza's proclaim the Harvest done.</L>
<L>Our master joyful a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he welcome sight,</L>
<L>Invites us all to feast with him at night.</L>
<L>A table plentifully spread we find,</L>
<L>And jugs of humming beer to chear the mind;</L>
<L>Which he, too generous, pushes on so fast,</L>
<L>We think no toils to come, nor mind the past.</L>
<L>But the next morning soon reveals the cheat,</L>
<L>When the same toils we must again repeat:</L>
<L>To the same barns again must back return,</L>
<L>To labour there for room for next year's Corn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, as the year's revolving course goes round,</L>
<L>No respite from our labour can be found:</L>
<L>Like <HI>Sysiphus,</HI> our work is never done,</L>
<L>Continually rolls back the restless stone:</L>
<L>Now growing labours still succeed the past,</L>
<L>And growing always new, must always last.</L>

<HEAD>ON <HI>POVERTY.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE's no ill on Earth which mortals fly</L>
<L>With so much dread, as abject Poverty.</L>
<L>O despicable name! We thee to shun,</L>
<L>On every other evil blindly run.</L>
<L>For fear of thee, distrustful Niggards go</L>
<L>In tatter'd rags, and starve their bodies too;</L>
<L>And still are poor, for fear of being so.</L>
<L>For fear of thee, the trader swears and vows</L>
<L>His wares are good, altho' his conscience knows</L>
<L>That he hath us'd his utmost art and skill,</L>
<L>Their faults and imperfections to conceal.</L>
<L>The sailor terrify'd with thoughts of thee,</L>
<L>Boldly attempts the dangers of the sea:</L>
<L>From East to West, o'er rocks and quick-sands steers,</L>
<L>'Tis Poverty, 'tis that alone he fears.</L>
<L>The soldier too, whom nought but thee can scare,</L>
<L>In hopes of plunder, bravely meets the war:</L>
<L>To fly from Poverty, he runs on death,</L>
<L>And shews he prizes riches more than breath.</L>
<L>Strange terror of mankind! by thee misled,</L>
<L>Not conscience, quick-sands, rocks, or death, they dread;</L>
<L>And yet thou art no formidable foe,</L>
<L>Except to little souls, who think thee so.</L>
<L>'Tis only the imagination, that</L>
<L>The blunted edge of Poverty can whet.</L>
<L>'Tis servile fear that does us most affect;</L>
<L>'Tis that transforms a shadow to a ghost.</L>
<L>Thus when a tim'rous man, in fears grown old,</L>
<L>Reminds the Fairy Tales his nurse has told;</L>
<L>In the dark night he oft will sideways squint,</L>
<L>And see's a Gobling, when there's nothing in't.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Contented Poverty's no dismal thing,</L>
<L>Free from the cares unwieldy riches bring:</L>
<L>At distance both alike deceive our view,</L>
<L>Nearer approach'd, they take another hue.</L>
<L>The poor Man's Labour relishes his meat;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="025421_0020_0FCD2A7892EE7B38" MS="y"/>His morsel's pleasant, and his rest is sweet.</L>
<L>The little, nature craves, we find with ease;</L>
<L>Too much but surfeit into a disease:</L>
<L>And what we have, more than we can enjoy,</L>
<L>Instead of satisfying, does but cloy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But should we in another prospect take it;</L>
<L>Was Poverty so hideous as they make it;</L>
<L>That steady Man is worthy of our praise,</L>
<L>Who in distress, or pinch'd with hunger, says,</L>
<L>Let Poverty, or Want, be what it will,</L>
<L>It does proceed from God, therefore's no ill.</L>
<L>How does his great heroic soul aspire</L>
<L>Above that sordid wealth the rest admire!</L>
<L>His noble thoughts are fix'd on things above,</L>
<L>Where by true faith, he sees the God of love</L>
<L>Hold forth th' attractive prize, which makes him run</L>
<L>His moral race, to gain th' immortal crown.</L>
<L>Not all the snares a crafty Devil can lay,</L>
<L>Can intercept, or stop him in his way;</L>
<L>His God-like soul pursues the thing that's good,</L>
<L>And soars above the common multitude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not all the scornful insults of the proud,</L>
<L>Nor censures of the base and groveling crowd</L>
<L>Nor Poverty, in all her terrors drest,</L>
<L>Can shake the solid quiet of his breast.</L>
<L>Unmov'd he stands, against his worst of foes,</L>
<L>And mocks the darts which adverse fortune throws;</L>
<L>Calm and compos'd amidst or ease or pain,</L>
<L>Enjoys that true content, which others seek in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So stands a fix'd rock, lofty and steep,</L>
<L>Within the confines of the briny deep:</L>
<L>Lash'd by the foaming surges on each side,</L>
<L>Yet can't be shaken by th' indignant tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then why should phantoms discompose the mind,</L>
<L>Or woes, so far from real, fright mankind?</L>
<L>Since wealth is but imaginary fame,</L>
<L>Since Poverty is nothing but a name;</L>
<L>Since both from God's unerring hand are sent,</L>
<L>Lord, give me neither, give me but content.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is thought proper to assure the Readers, that the follow∣ing Verses are really the productions of the Person to whom the Title-page ascribes them.</P>
<P>Tho' She pretends not to the Genius of Mr. <HI>DUCK,</HI> nor hopes to be taken notice of by the Great, yet her Friends are of opinion that the Novelty of a <HI>Washer-Women</HI>'s turning Poetess, will procure her some Readers.</P>
<P>If all that follow the same employment would amuse them∣selves, and one another, during the tedious hours of their La∣bour, in this, or some other way as innocent, instead of tossing Scandal to and fro, many reputations would remain un∣wounded, and the peace of families be lese disturbed.</P>
<P>I think it no reproach to the Author, whose Life is toilsome, and her Wages inconsiderably, to confess honestly, that the view of her putting a small Sum of Money in her Pocket, as well as the Reader's Entertainment, had its share of influ∣ence upon this Publication. And she humbly hopes she shall not be absolutely disappointed; since, though she is ready to own that her performance could by no means stand a critical examination, yet she flatters herself that, with all its faults and imperfections, the candid Reader will judge it to be some∣thing considerably beyond the common capacity of those of her own rank and occupation.</P>

<HEAD>THE WOMAN's LABOUR. TO MR. STEPHEN DUCK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IMMORTAL Bard! thou Fav'rite of the nine!</L>
<L>Enrich'd by Peers, advanc'd by CAROLINE!</L>
<L>Deign to look down on one that's poor and low,</L>
<L>Rememb'ring you yourself was lately so;</L>
<L>Accept these lines! Alas! what can you have</L>
<L>From her, who ever was, and's still a slave?</L>
<L>No learning ever was bestow'd on me;</L>
<L>My life was always spent in drudgery:</L>
<L>And not alone; alas! with grief I find,</L>
<L>It is the portion of poor Woman-kind.</L>
<L>Oft have I thought as on my bed I lay,</L>
<L>Eas'd from the tiresome labours of the day,</L>
<L>Our first extraction from a Mass refin'd,</L>
<L>Could never be for slavery design'd;</L>
<L>Till time and custom by degrees destroy'd</L>
<L>That happy state our sex at first enjoy'd.</L>
<L>When men had us'd their utmost care and toil,</L>
<L>Their recompense was but a female smile;</L>
<L>When they by arts or arms were render'd great,</L>
<L>They laid their trophies at a Woman's feet;</L>
<L>They, in those days, unto our sex did bring</L>
<L>Their hearts, their all, a free-will offering;</L>
<L>And as from us their being they derive,</L>
<L>They back again shou'd all due homage give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>JOVE</HI> once descending from the Clouds, did drop</L>
<L>In Show'rs of Gold on lovely <HI>Danae</HI>'s Lap;</L>
<L>The sweet-tongu'd poets, in those gen'rous days,</L>
<L>Unto our shrine still offer'd up their lays:</L>
<L>But now, alas! that Golden age is past,</L>
<L>We are the objects of your scorn at last.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="025421_0027_0FCD2A8734944FD8"/>And you, great DUCK, upon whose happy brow,</L>
<L>The Muses seem to fix the garland now,</L>
<L>In your late <HI>Poem</HI> boldly did declare</L>
<L><HI>Alcides'</HI> labour can't with yours compare;</L>
<L>And of your annual task have much to say,</L>
<L>Of threshing, reaping, mowing, corn and hay;</L>
<L>Boasting your daily toil, and nightly dream,</L>
<L>But can't conclude your never-dying theme,</L>
<L>And let our hapless sex in silence lie</L>
<L>Forgotten, and in dark oblivion die;</L>
<L>But on our abject state you throw your scorn,</L>
<L>And Women wrong, your verses to adorn.</L>
<L>You of hay-making speak a word or two,</L>
<L>As if our sex but little work cou'd do:</L>
<L>This makes the honest Farmer smiling say,</L>
<L>He'll seek for women still to make his hay;</L>
<L>For if his back be turn'd their work they mind,</L>
<L>As well as men as far as he can find.</L>
<L>For my own part, I many a <HI>Summer's</HI> day</L>
<L>Have spent in throwing, turning, making hay;</L>
<L>But ne'er could see, what you have lately found,</L>
<L>Our wages paid for sitting on the ground.</L>
<L>'Tis true, that when our morning's work is done,</L>
<L>And all our grass expos'd unto the sun,</L>
<L>While that his scorching beams do on it shine,</L>
<L>As well as you we have a time to dine:</L>
<L>I hope, that since we freely toil and sweat</L>
<L>To earn our bread, you'll give us time to eat.</L>
<L>That over, soon we must get up again,</L>
<L>And nimbly turn our hay upon the plain:</L>
<L>Nay, rake and row it in, the case is clear;</L>
<L>Or how should <HI>Cocks in equal Rows appear?</HI></L>
<L>But if you'd have what you have wrote believ'd,</L>
<L>I find, that you to hear us talk are griev'd:</L>
<L>In this, I hope, you do not speak your mind,</L>
<L>For none but <HI>Turks,</HI> that ever I could find,</L>
<L>Have Mutes to serve them, or did e'er deny</L>
<L>Their slaves, at work, to chat it merrily.</L>
<L>Since you have liberty to speak your mind,</L>
<L><PB REF="025421_0028_0FCD2A8872472B88" MS="y"/>And are to talk, as well as we, inclin'd,</L>
<L>Why should you thus repine, because that we,</L>
<L>Like you, enjoy that pleasing liberty?</L>
<L>What! wou'd you lord it quite, and take away</L>
<L>The only privilege our sex enjoy?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When ev'ning does approach, we homeward hie,</L>
<L>And our domestic toils incessant ply:</L>
<L>Against your coming home prepare to get</L>
<L>Our work all done, our house in order set;</L>
<L><HI>Bacon</HI> and <HI>Dumpling</HI> in the pot we boil,</L>
<L>Our beds we make, our swine we feed the while;</L>
<L>Then wait at door to see you coming home,</L>
<L>And set the table out against you come:</L>
<L>Early next morning we on you attend,</L>
<L>Our children dress and feed, their cloaths we mend;</L>
<L>And in the field our daily task renew,</L>
<L>Soon as the rising sun has dry'd the dew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Harvest comes, into the field we go,</L>
<L>And help to reap the Wheat as well as you;</L>
<L>Or else we go the ears of corn to glean;</L>
<L>No labour scorning be it e'er so mean;</L>
<L>But in the work we freely bear a part,</L>
<L>And what we can, perform with all our heart.</L>
<L>To get a living we so willing are,</L>
<L>Our tender babes into the field we bear,</L>
<L>And wrap them in our cloaths to keep them warm,</L>
<L>While round about we gather up the corn;</L>
<L>And often unto them our course do bend,</L>
<L>To keep them safe, that nothing them offend:</L>
<L>Our children that are able bear a share</L>
<L>In gleaning Corn, such is our frugal care.</L>
<L>When night comes on, unto our home we go,</L>
<L>Our corn we carry, and our infant too;</L>
<L>Weary indeed! but 'tis not worth our while</L>
<L>Once to complain, or <HI>rest at ev'ry stile;</HI></L>
<L>We must make haste, for when we home are come,</L>
<L>We find again our work but just begun;</L>
<L>So many things for our attendance call,</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="025421_0029_0FCD2A89E9638CF0"/>Had we ten hands, we could employ them all.</L>
<L>Our children put to bed, with greatest care,</L>
<L>We all things for your coming home prepare:</L>
<L>You sup and go to Bed without delay,</L>
<L>And rest yourselves till the ensuing day;</L>
<L>While we; alas! but little sleep can have,</L>
<L>Because our froward Children cry and rave;</L>
<L>Yet, without fail, soon as day light doth spring,</L>
<L>We in the field again our work begin,</L>
<L>And there, with all our strength, our toil renew,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Titan</HI>'s golden rays have dry'd the dew;</L>
<L>Then home we go unto our Children dear,</L>
<L>Dress, feed, and bring them to the field with care.</L>
<L>Were this your case, you justly might complain,</L>
<L>That day nor night you are secure from pain;</L>
<L>Those mighty troubles which perplex your minds,</L>
<L>(<HI>Thistles</HI> before, and <HI>Females</HI> come behind)</L>
<L>Would vanish soon and quickly disappear,</L>
<L>Were you, like us, encumber'd thus with care.</L>
<L>What you would have of us we do not know:</L>
<L>We oft take up the Corn that you do mow;</L>
<L>We cut the Peas, and always ready are,</L>
<L>In ev'ry work to take our proper share;</L>
<L>And from the time that harvest doth begin,</L>
<L>Until the Corn be cut and carry'd in,</L>
<L>Our toil and labour's daily so extreme,</L>
<L>That we've hardly ever <HI>Time to dream.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Harvest ended, respite none we find;</L>
<L>The hardest of our toil is still behind:</L>
<L>Hard labour we most chearfully pursue,</L>
<L>And out, abroad, a chairing often go:</L>
<L>Of which I now will briefly tell in part,</L>
<L>What fully to describe is past my art;</L>
<L>So many hardships daily we go thro'</L>
<L>I boldly say, the like <HI>you</HI> never knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When bright <HI>Orion</HI> glitters in the skies</L>
<L>In <HI>Winter</HI> nights, then early we must rise;</L>
<L>The weather ne'er so bad, wind, rain, or snow,</L>
<L>Our work appointed, we must rise and go;</L>
<L><PB REF="025421_0030_0FCD2A8C0FC5B840" MS="y"/>While you on easy Beds may lie and sleep,</L>
<L>Till light does thro' your chamber windows peep.</L>
<L>When to the house we come where we should go,</L>
<L>How to get in, alas! we do not know:</L>
<L>The maid quite tir'd with work the day before,</L>
<L>O'ercome with sleep; we standing at the door</L>
<L>Oppress'd with cold, and often call in vain,</L>
<L>E'er to our work we can admittance gain:</L>
<L>But when from wind and weather we get in,</L>
<L>Briskly with courage we our work begin;</L>
<L>Heaps of fine linen we before us view,</L>
<L>Whereon to lay our strength and patience too;</L>
<L>Cambricks and muslins which our ladies wear,</L>
<L>Laces and edgings, costly, fine, and rare,</L>
<L>Which must be wash'd with utmost skill and care;</L>
<L>With Holland shirts, ruffles and fringes too,</L>
<L>Fashions, which our fore-fathers never knew.</L>
<L>For several hours here we work and slave,</L>
<L>Before we can one glimpse of day-light have;</L>
<L>We labour hard before the morning's past,</L>
<L>Because we fear the time runs on too fast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length bright <HI>Sol</HI> illuminates the skies,</L>
<L>And summons drowsy mortals to arise;</L>
<L>Then comes our Mistress to us without fail,</L>
<L>And in her hand, <HI>perhaps,</HI> a mug of Ale</L>
<L>To cheer our hearts, and also to inform</L>
<L>Herself what work is done that very morn;</L>
<L>Lays her command upon us, that we mind</L>
<L>Her linen well, nor <HI>leave the dirt behind:</HI></L>
<L>Nor this alone, but also to take care,</L>
<L>We don't her cambricks nor her ruffles tear;</L>
<L>And <HI>these</HI> most strictly does of us require,</L>
<L><HI>To save her soap, and sparing be of fire;</HI></L>
<L>Tells us her charge is great, nay furthermore,</L>
<L>Her cloaths are fewer than the time before.</L>
<L>Now we drive on, resolv'd our strength to try,</L>
<L>And what we can we do most willingly;</L>
<L>Until with heat and work, 'tis often known,</L>
<L>Not only sweat, but blood runs trickling down</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="025421_0031_0FCD2A8E1BDFCDA0"/>Our wrists and fingers; still our work demands</L>
<L>The constant action of our lab'ring hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now night comes on, from whence you have relief,</L>
<L>But that, alas! does but increase our grief;</L>
<L>With heavy hearts we often view the sun,</L>
<L>Fearing he'll set before our work is done;</L>
<L>For either in the morning, or at night,</L>
<L>We piece the <HI>Summer</HI>'s day with candle-light.</L>
<L>Tho' we all day with care our work attend,</L>
<L>Such is our fate, we know not when 'twill end:</L>
<L>When ev'ning's come, you homeward take your way,</L>
<L>We, till our work is done, are forc'd to stay;</L>
<L>And after all our toil and labour past,</L>
<L><HI>Six-pence</HI> or <HI>Eight-pence</HI> pays us off at last;</L>
<L>For all our pains, no prospect can we see</L>
<L>Attend us, but <HI>Old Age</HI> and <HI>Poverty.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Washing</HI> is not all we have to do:</L>
<L>We oft change work for work as well as you,</L>
<L>Our Mistress of her pewter doth complain,</L>
<L>And 'tis our part to make it clean again.</L>
<L>This work, tho' very hard and tiresome too,</L>
<L>Is not the worst we hapless females do:</L>
<L>When night comes on, and we quite weary are,</L>
<L>We scarce can count what falls unto our share;</L>
<L>Pots, kettles, sauce-pans, skillets, we may see,</L>
<L>Skimmers and ladles, and such trumpery,</L>
<L>Brought in to make complete our slavery.</L>
<L>Tho' early in the morning 'tis begun,</L>
<L>'Tis often very late before we've done;</L>
<L>Alas! our labours never know an end;</L>
<L>On brass and iron we our strength must spend;</L>
<L>Our tender hands and fingers scratch and tear:</L>
<L>All this, and more, with patience we must bear.</L>
<L>Colour'd with dirt and filth we now appear;</L>

<L><PB REF="025421_0032_0FCD2A8FD1E4F690" MS="y"/>Then in much haste for brewing we prepare,</L>

<L>At other times, ev'n <HI>that</HI> will not suffice;</L>
<L>Our work at ev'ning oft we do begin,</L>
<L>And e'er we've done, the night comes on again.</L>
<L>Water we pump, the copper we must fill,</L>
<L>Or tend the fire; for if we e'er standing still,</L>
<L>Like you, when threshing, we a watch must keep,</L>
<L>Our wort boils over, if we dare to sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to rehearse all labour is in vain,</L>
<L>Of which we very justly might complain:</L>

<L>Our toil increases as the year runs round.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>These papers seal'd, were secretly convey'd</L>
<L>Beneath the pillow where <HI>Darius</HI> laid,</L>
<L>Until <HI>Aurora</HI> did the light display,</L>
<L>And <HI>Phoebus</HI> rising, usher'd in the day;</L>
<L>Then they withdraw, and when the king did rise,</L>
<L>His servants on their writings cast their eyes,</L>
<L>And to his sacred majesty made known,</L>
<L>What in the night had by his guards been done.</L>
<L>The king was pleas'd on hearing the report,</L>
<L>How the brave youths had acted in his court;</L>
<L>And straightway did his royal mandate send.</L>
<L>Commanding all his princes to attend;</L>
<L>All his wise men, and captains, he did call</L>
<L>Straight to assemble in the council-hall:</L>
<L>The king himself in judgment takes his place,</L>
<L>And with his presence will the senate grace;</L>
<L>His resolution doth to them declare,</L>
<L>Impartially to end this nice affair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="025421_0034_0FCD2A95267E62A8" MS="y"/>
<L>And now their several writings being read,</L>
<L>That with the greater force they may proceed,</L>
<L>The king commands the young men in with speed,</L>
<L>And bids them freely speak their whole intent,</L>
<L>What either of them by his sentence meant:</L>
<L>Then having leave, the first did silence break,</L>
<L>And to this purpose he before them spake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most mighty pow'rs! doth not <HI>Wine</HI> exceed</L>
<L>In strength?—It overcometh all indeed:</L>
<L>By freely drinking many are misled;</L>
<L>By <HI>Wine</HI> the strongest have been conquered:</L>
<L>The needy orphan it will quickly bring,</L>
<L>To be as gay and pleasant as the king;</L>
<L>Enslav'd him that heretofore was free;</L>
<L>Makes servants think they have their liberty:</L>
<L>The poor man and the rich alike are found,</L>
<L>While mirth and jollity go freely round;</L>
<L>Remembrance of all evils, past and gone,</L>
<L>Sorrows and debts, no more are thought upon,</L>
<L>When sparkling <HI>Wine</HI> their hearts begins to chear,</L>
<L>Nor king, nor governor, they seem to fear;</L>
<L>They speak at large, each would be chief of all,</L>
<L>Till friends and brethren at variance fall:</L>
<L>Drawn swords sometimes the pow'r of <HI>Wine</HI> attend,</L>
<L>But when 'tis gone, the quarrel's at an end;</L>
<L>Their wrath forgot, their mirth thought on no more,</L>
<L>Each man is in the state he was before.</L>
<L>The force and pow'r of <HI>Wine,</HI> consider'd well,</L>
<L>Must needs in strength all other things excel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He having spoke, the second did begin,</L>
<L>Thus to declare the pow'r of the <HI>King.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most noble lords! Of all things that were made,</L>
<L>Or ever on the earth a being had,</L>
<L>Men do excel in strength: To their command</L>
<L>All things are subject, both by sea and land:</L>
<L>How strong then is the <HI>King,</HI> whose regal sway</L>
<L>All men on earth submissively obey!</L>
<L>They yield obedience to his princely will,</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="025421_0035_0FCD2A97D2D292B0"/>And ready are his pleasure to fulfil:</L>
<L>To his dominion, high and low submit,</L>
<L>He over them bears rule as he thinks fit.</L>
<L>If he in hostile manner draws his sword,</L>
<L>Whole armed legions straight attend his word;</L>
<L>Whate'er he bids, they do with heart and hand,</L>
<L>Walls, tow'rs, nor bulwarks can before them stand:</L>
<L>When into foreign lands he doth them send,</L>
<L>They, in his quarrel, e'en their blood do spend,</L>
<L>And fight till victory doth on them attend;</L>
<L>Then with glad hearts submissively they bring,</L>
<L>The choicest spoils with homage to the <HI>King:</HI></L>
<L>While those whose bus'ness is to till the ground,</L>
<L>With whom a sword or spear is seldom found,</L>
<L>Manure their land, their fruitful vineyards dress;</L>
<L>They reap their corn, and luscious clusters press:</L>
<L>And when the harvest doth their toil reward,</L>
<L>They bring the tribute to their <HI>sov'reign lord.</HI></L>
<L>If any hapless wretch the <HI>King</HI> displease,</L>
<L>His neighbours ne'er dispute, but on him seize;</L>
<L>If he bid spare, they spare; if he bid kill,</L>
<L>They ready are his pleasure to fulfil;</L>
<L>If cities to destroy, or buildings burn,</L>
<L>They into heaps of ruin, kingdoms turn:</L>
<L>If clemency within his breast take place,</L>
<L>His people all adore his princely grace,</L>
<L>And build, and plant, what late they did deface.</L>
<L>Whene'er he please▪ he lays him down to sleep,</L>
<L>While armed bands strict watch do round him keep;</L>
<L>Nor dare depart, nor their own bus'ness mind,</L>
<L>But serve the <HI>King,</HI> as duty doth them bind,</L>
<L>Then what can equal him for strength, I pray,</L>
<L>Whom in such sort all men on earth obey:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wise <HI>Zorababel</HI> then appears in place,</L>
<L>A royal youth of <HI>David</HI>'s kingly race;</L>
<L>(Much nobler he than those that spake before,</L>
<L>Because he did the <HI>living GOD</HI> adore)</L>
<L>And thus his mind and writing did declare,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em all, that sate in judgment there.</L>

<L>Most worthy princes! I do freely own</L>
<L>The strength of <HI>Kings</HI> throughout the world is known;</L>
<L>The force of <HI>Wine</HI> all mortals know full well;</L>
<L>Yet neither of them doth in might excel:</L>
<L><HI>Women</HI> alone must bear the prize away,</L>
<L>Whom all mankind do honour and obey.</L>
<L>And well they may, because from them do spring</L>
<L>The poor and rich, the peasant and the king;</L>
<L>The greatest heroes that the world can know,</L>
<L>To <HI>Women</HI> their original must owe;</L>
<L>They nourish those that plant the fruitful vine.</L>
<L>From whence you vainly boast the pow'r of <HI>Wine:</HI></L>
<L>The glory and the praise of men they are,</L>
<L>And make the garments which they daily wear;</L>
<L>Nay, without <HI>women,</HI> men can't be at all,</L>
<L>But soon the species would to ruin fail.</L>
<L>When men have gather'd gold and treasures great</L>
<L>Of precious things, and live in pomp and state,</L>
<L>No true content their captive hearts attain,</L>
<L>Unless they can a <HI>woman's</HI> favour gain;</L>
<L>Her beauty to adore they are inclin'd,</L>
<L>Her noble virtue does attract the mind;</L>
<L>With gold and silver they will freely part,</L>
<L>To gain admission to a <HI>female's</HI> heart;</L>
<L>Her rare perfections are so much admir'd,</L>
<L>Nought in the world can be like her desir'd,</L>
<L>For if his native country lay at stake,</L>
<L>The husband quits it for his spouse's sake;</L>
<L>His parents, friends, and kindred he doth leave;</L>
<L>Unto his wife alone his heart doth cleave:</L>
<L>Nought comes amiss, he's happy if he find</L>
<L>A consort virtuous, loving, fair, and kind;</L>
<L>A willing homage he to her doth pay;</L>
<L>In toil and labour hard he spends the day,</L>
<L>To gather wealth, that so he may provide,</L>
<L>Treasure to bring unto his dearest bride:</L>
<L>Another boldly, with his sword in hand,</L>
<L>Will cross the seas, and wander on the land;</L>
<L>No horrid dangers can procure his stay,</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="025421_0037_0FCD2A9A4D2ABA40"/>He bravely dares a lion in the way;</L>
<L>Laden with booty to his mistress flies,</L>
<L>And at her feet presents the golden prize.</L>
<L>Some men, for love of <HI>women,</HI> oft we see,</L>
<L>Have been reduc'd to utmost misery,</L>
<L>And lost their senses, if they chanc'd to find</L>
<L>A beauteous <HI>female</HI> cruel and unkind.</L>
<L>How oft have wretched mortals been misled,</L>
<L>With murd'rous hands their rival's blood to shed?</L>
<L>While some as desp'rately have sought for death,</L>
<L>And by self-murder stopt their vital breath!</L>
<L>The <HI>King</HI> is strong, no people can deny</L>
<L>The honor due to sov'reign majesty:</L>
<L>All stand in fear of him; his pow'r is such,</L>
<L>'Tis death to strike, no less than death to touch.</L>
<L>This mighty monarch I did lately spy</L>
<L>In his chair of state, fair <HI>Apame</HI> sitting by;</L>
<L>At his right hand this youthful beauty bright,</L>
<L>Appear'd like <HI>Cynthia</HI>'s glitt'ring rays of light;</L>
<L>Altho' he did the <HI>Persian</HI> scepter sway,</L>
<L>This blooming lady took his crown away;</L>
<L>The diadem that on his head was worn,</L>
<L>Her lovely brows and temples did adorn;</L>
<L>Nay furthermore, when she had done this thing,</L>
<L>With her left hand she struck this puissant king,</L>
<L>Yet no displeasure did in him arise,</L>
<L>Who was a captive to her conqu'ring eyes:</L>
<L>Her radiant beauty did such beams display,</L>
<L>From her he could not turn his eyes away:</L>
<L>If this illustrious <HI>Lady</HI> deign'd to smile,</L>
<L>O'ercome with joy, the <HI>King</HI> would laugh the while:</L>
<L>If ought displeas'd her, then the <HI>King</HI> would try</L>
<L>With gentle words the <HI>Dame</HI> to pacify.</L>
<L>What mortal strength with <HI>Women</HI> can compare,</L>
<L>Since crowned Heads to them obedient are?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The king and princes then began to gaze,</L>
<L>And look upon each other with amaze;</L>
<L>For now they very plainly did descry,</L>
<L>This noble prince would have the victory;</L>
<L><PB REF="025421_0038_0FCD2A9C39297028" MS="y"/>Who, having paus'd, began to speak again,</L>
<L>Not doubting but he should acceptance gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most noble Counsellors, assembled here!</L>
<L><HI>Women</HI> are strong, as I have made appear;</L>
<L>The <HI>Earth</HI> is large, wherein all creatures dwell;</L>
<L>The <HI>Heav'n's</HI> stupendous do in height excel;</L>
<L>The glorious <HI>Sun</HI> does heat and light display,</L>
<L>And with his beams gives ev'ry region day:</L>
<L>How great then HE, by whose divine command,</L>
<L>All things at first were made, Earth, Sea, and Land!</L>
<L>Strong is the <HI>Truth,</HI> who did create all things;</L>
<L>From that blest fountain all perfection springs:</L>
<L>The heav'nly Host with rev'rence all adore,</L>
<L>While men on earth with trembling fear implore</L>
<L>Almighty <HI>Truth,</HI> which ever shall endure,</L>
<L>When worldly pomp and splendor are no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That <HI>Kings</HI> are wicked, all wise men agree;</L>
<L><HI>Women</HI> are so we know assuredly;</L>
<L>When to excessive drinking men incline,</L>
<L>The worst of evils has been caus'd by <HI>wine:</HI></L>
<L>All men on earth of high and low degree,</L>
<L>Are subject unto sin and vanity;</L>
<L>Destruction does on wickedness attend,</L>
<L>But mighty <HI>Truth</HI> shall never know an end;</L>
<L>Not only strong, but good beyond compare;</L>
<L>No wicked men with <HI>him</HI> accepted are:</L>
<L>No rich reward, no golden bribe can buy</L>
<L>License from <HI>Truth</HI> to act unfaithfully:</L>
<L>Fraud or deceit in <HI>Truth</HI> we never find;</L>
<L>Good men embrace it with a ready mind:</L>
<L>Whatever thing is virtuous, good, and great,</L>
<L>In <HI>Truth</HI> we find it perfect and complete:</L>
<L>Then prais'd be <HI>Truth</HI> to all eternity.</L>
<L>In one alone is strength and majesty!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He having finish'd th' attentive crowd,</L>
<L>With joyful acclamations shout aloud;</L>
<L>The <HI>Truth</HI> applauding, they, as one agree,</L>
<L>This brave young Prince should have the victory:</L>
<L>The king and council did his wisdom praise,</L>

<L>A massy chain of gold his neck does grace,</L>
<L>And next unto himself assigns his place:</L>
<L>And to increase his honour, after all.</L>
<L>Commands that they his cousin should him call;</L>
<L>And of his royal grace he doth decree,</L>
<L>What he would ask, performed it should be:</L>
<L><HI>Speak what thou wilt, it shall be done for thee;</HI></L>
<L>He was not long to seek what choice to make,</L>
<L>But to the King with low submission spake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most mighty Prince! I beg thou wou'dst pursue,</L>
<L>The thing that thou propos'dst long ago.</L>
<L>Behold <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in ruins laid!</L>
<L>Perform the vow which thou thyself hast made,</L>
<L>When first thou didst the <HI>Persian</HI> sceptre wield,</L>
<L>That thou the peerless city wouldst rebuild;</L>
<L>That glorious Temple, which was once the praise</L>
<L>Of all the earth, thou vow'dst again to raise;</L>
<L>That goodly Pile by <HI>Edomites</HI> destroy'd,</L>
<L>Each goodly building now in ashes laid,</L>
<L>And all the holy vessels to restore,</L>
<L>As <HI>Cyrus</HI> did design long time before;</L>
<L>That then <HI>Judea</HI>'s sons may bless thy name,</L>
<L>And babes unborn thy matchless grace proclaim:</L>
<L>No other things, great Prince! do I require;</L>
<L>No earthly pomp or grandeur I desire:</L>
<L>But if this one request thou grant to me,</L>
<L>Immortal honour thy reward will be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King observing how he stood inclin'd,</L>
<L>To serve his country with a willing mind,</L>
<L>Rose from his seat, and in that very place,</L>
<L>Before the council, doth the Prince embrace;</L>
<L>Grants his request, and doth his letters send,</L>
