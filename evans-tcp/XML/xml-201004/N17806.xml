<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE REVEREND Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COME on, my Whitefield! (since the strife is past,</L>
<L>And friends at first are friends again at last)</L>
<L>Our hands, and hearts, and counsels let us join</L>
<L>In mutual league, to advance the work Divine,</L>
<L>Our one contention now, our single aim.</L>
<L>To pluck poor souls as brands out of the flame;</L>
<L>To spread the victory of that bloody cross,</L>
<L>And gasp our latest breath in the Redeemer's cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too long, alas! we gave to Satan place,</L>
<L>When party-zeal put on an angel's face,</L>
<L>Too long we hst'ned to the couz'ning fiend,</L>
<L>Whose trumpet sounded, "For the faith contend!"</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="023064_0004_0FBC1B685720BB08"/>
With hasty blindfold rage, in error's night,</L>
<L>How did we with our fellow-soldiers fight!</L>
<L>We could not then our father's children know,</L>
<L>But each mistook his brother for his foe.</L>
<L>"Foes to the truth, can you in conscience space?</L>
<L>"Tear them, the (tempter cry'd) in pieces, tear!"</L>
<L>So thick the darkness, so confus'd the noise,</L>
<L>We took the stranger's for the shepherd's voice;</L>
<L>Rash nature wav'd the controversial sword,</L>
<L>On fire to fight the battles of the Lord,</L>
<L>Fraternal love from every breast was driv'n,</L>
<L>And bleeding Charity return'd to heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Saviour saw our strife with pitying eye,</L>
<L>And cast a look that made the shadows fly:</L>
<L>Soon as the day-spring in his presence shone,</L>
<L>We found the two fierce armies were but one;</L>
<L>Common our hope, and family, and name,</L>
<L>Our arms, our captain, and our crown the same,</L>
<L>Inlisted all beneath Emanuel's sign,</L>
<L>And purchas'd every soul with precious blood divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us cordially again embrace,</L>
<L>Nor e'er infringe the league of gospel-grace;</L>
<L>Let us in Jesus' name to battle go,</L>
<L>And turn our arms against the common foe;</L>
<L>Fight side by side beneath our Captain's eye,</L>
<L>Chase the Philistines, on their shoulders fly,</L>
<L>And, more than conquerors, in the harness die.</L>

<L>For whether I am born to <HI>"blush above,"</HI></L>
<L>On earth suspicious of electing love,</L>
<L>Or you o'er whelm'd with honourable shame,</L>
<L>To shout the universsal Saviour's Name,</L>
<L>It matters not; if, all our conflicts past,</L>
<L>Before the great white throne we meet at last:</L>
<L>Our only care while sojourning below,</L>
<L>Our real Faith by real Love to show:</L>
<L>To blast the aliens' hope, and let them see</L>
<L>How friends of jarring sentiments agree:</L>
<L>Not in a party's narrow banks confin'd,</L>
<L>Not by a sameless of opinions join'd,</L>
<L>But cemented with the Redeemer's blood,</L>
<L>And bound together in the heart of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can we forget from whence our union came,</L>
<L>When first we simply met in Jesus' name?</L>
<L>The name mysterious of the God unknown,</L>
<L>Whose secret love allur'd, and drew us on</L>
<L>Thro' a long, lonely, legal wilderness,</L>
<L>To find the promis'd land of gospel peace.</L>
<L>True yoke-fellows, we then agreed to draw</L>
<L>Th' intolerable burden of the Law,</L>
<L>And jointly lab'ring on with zealous strife,</L>
<L>Strengthen'd each other's hands to work <HI>for</HI> Life:</L>
<L>To turn against the world our steady face,</L>
<L>And, valiant for the truth, enjoy disgrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, when we serv'd our God thro' fear alone,</L>
<L>Our views, our studies, and our hearts were one;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="023064_0006_0FBC1B6D598E4C20"/>
No smallest difference damp'd the social flame:</L>
<L>In Moses' school we thought, and spake the same:</L>
<L>And must we, now in Christ, with shame confess,</L>
<L>Our love was greater when our light was less?</L>
<L>When darkly thro' a glass with servile awe,</L>
<L>We first the spiritual commandment saw,</L>
<L>Could we not then, our mutual love to show,</L>
<L>Thro' fire and water for each other go?</L>
<L>We could:—we did:—In a strange land I stood,</L>
<L>And beckon'd thee to cross th' Atlantic flood:</L>
<L>With true affection wing'd, thy ready mind,</L>
<L>Left country, fame, and ease, and friends behind,</L>
<L>And, eager all heav'ns counsels to explore,</L>
<L>Flew thro' the watry world and grasp'd the shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor did I linger, at my friend's desire,</L>
<L>To tempt the furnace, and abide the fire:</L>
<L>When suddenly sent forth, from the high-ways</L>
<L>I call'd poor out-casts to the feast of grace;</L>
<L>Urg'd to pursue the work by thee begun,</L>
<L>Thro' good and ill report, I still rush'd on,</L>
<L>Nor felt the fire of popular applause,</L>
<L>Nor sear'd the tort'ring flame in such a glorious cause</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! wherefore did we ever seem to part,</L>
<L>Or clash in sentiment, while one in heart?</L>
<L>What dire device did the old Serpent find,</L>
<L>To put asunder those whom God had join'd?</L>
<L>From folly and self-love Opinion rose,</L>
<L>To sever friends who never yet were foes;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="023064_0007_0FBC1B6EF1FE7258"/>
To baffle and divert our noblest aim,</L>
<L>Confound our pride, and cover us with shame;</L>
<L>To make us blush beneath her short-liv'd pow'r,</L>
<L>And glad the world with one triumphant hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo! the snare is broke, the captive's freed,</L>
<L>By faith on all the hostile powers we tread,</L>
<L>And crush thro' Jesus' strength the Serpent's head.</L>
<L>Jesus hath cast the curst Accuser down,</L>
<L>Hath rooted up the tares by Satan sown:</L>
<L>Kindled anew the never-dying flame,</L>
<L>And re-baptiz'd our souls into his Name.</L>
<L>Soon as the virtue of his Name we seel,</L>
<L>The storm of strife subsides, the sea is still,</L>
<L>All nature bows to his benign command,</L>
<L>And two are one in his Almighty hand.</L>
<L>One in his hand, O may we still remain,</L>
<L>Fast bound with love's indissoluble chain;</L>
<L>(That adamant which time and death defies,</L>
<L>That golden chain which draws us to the skies!)</L>
<L>His love the tie that binds us to his throne,</L>
<L>His love the bond that perfects us in one;</L>
<L>His love (let all the ground of friendship see)</L>
<L>His only love constrains our hearts t'agree,</L>
<L>And gives the rivet of Eternity!</L>
