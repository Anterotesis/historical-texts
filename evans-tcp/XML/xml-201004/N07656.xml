<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the Pamphlets you sent me on the Differences in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> none surpriz'd me so much as that entitled, "<HI>A Letter from</HI> Charles Read, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to the Ho∣nourable</HI> John Ladd, <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR>"—When I con∣sider this Letter either as the Production of the Secretary or Judge, I am amazed to think how it came into print. As Secretary, it was out of his Province to write such a Letter to Justices; he had nothing more to do, than to signify his Excellency's Orders of Protection; and had the Governor not thought it neces∣sary to give any Account of the Disturbances
<PB N="4" REF="009774_0003_0F7A563EE49A9330"/>in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> the Letter-Writer should have said so, and delivered the Governor's Sentiments, and not his Own.— As a Judge there is no Excuse; and it grieves me to think that a Justice of the Supream Court, should so far forget himself, as to give his Opinion upon Hear-say, and brand People with the Name of MURDERERS, upon bare Report.</P>
<P>The Letter has a most extraordinary Begin∣ning: I should be glad to know who the <HI>some Persons of good Character in Philadelphia,</HI> are, upon whose Application the Governor so readily granted his Licence and Protection for <HI>some</HI> Indians to reside in this Province; and who those Indians are, that we are told, <HI>"have been always in the English Interest."</HI></P>
<P>The Letter-Writer certainly knows: Why did he not then speak out? I am sure indif∣ferent Men will think it very strange to en∣deavour to interest Magistrates in Favour of
<PB N="5" REF="009774_0003_0F7A563EE49A9330"/>Indians, by Invectives against Men they are Strangers to, as well as to the Motives of their Conduct.</P>
<P>Any Application from private Persons, of ever so good Character, in my Opinion, was not a sufficient Reason to issue an Order of Go∣vernment for the Protection of Indians, charg∣ed with high Crimes, by the Inhabitants of the Frontier-Counties of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> The People will judge for themselves; and when they know that the Government of <HI>Pennsyl∣vania</HI> did not apply, but that these Indians ought to be in the City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> they will naturally construe this Letter as a preme∣ditated Thing, and an entering voluntarily on one Side of a Question, and giving a par∣tial Judgment against a Number of Men, on the bare Word of <HI>some</HI> Persons who are not known, in favour of <HI>some</HI> Indians, who may be Enemies, for ought we know</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009774_0004_0F7A56408DD74DF0"/>
But to brand a People with the Name of MURDERERS—to represent them in a State of Infatuation—to charge them with Crimes of the blackest Dye, surely requir'd better Evi∣dence than bare Report; and plainly shews that the Letter-Writer had inlisted himself as Advocate in a Matter and Measures wherein the Province was not in the least concerned, but he determined to support.</P>
<P><HI>"Weak Minds are apt to be inflamed,"</HI> he is pleased to say, <HI>"on reading an Article in the Gazette, of a few Persons being killed by In∣dians, &amp;c."</HI>— And no Wonder, as the Indian Mode of War is horrid, and their Cruelty shocking: But this is the first Time I have ever heard it palliated, and that generous Ardor that is raised on the Report of Indian Inroads, (which, if properly directed, would chastise Indian Insolence) stiled <HI>a Weakness</HI> of Mind, and lowered to a Ferment rather dis∣graceful to Human Nature. At the same
<PB N="7" REF="009774_0004_0F7A56408DD74DF0"/>Time he confesses the Affair at <HI>Lancaster</HI> has raised his <HI>Resentment;</HI> whether it is a Proof of the <HI>Weakness</HI> of his Mind, I leave to him to determine. This he must allow, that the People have as good a Right to judge as him∣self; and it may be feared they will not im∣pute <HI>Weakness</HI> to him only.</P>
<P>But he has drawn his Pen not so much to signify the Governor's Orders, as to write professedly in Favour of Measures that can∣not be justify'd; and has not hesitated to con∣demn without Evidence, and to speak of In∣dians in a Manner none can approve.</P>
<P>Had he reflected ever so little on the pre∣sent Affairs, he must have found that it was not a Time to cry up Indian Numbers, when we are justly arming to scourge them for their Insolence and Cruelty: He would have found that such Stories might discourage the inlist∣ing Men for the Campaign; and that when the People hear, from his Pen, that such are the Indians and the Situation of their Coun∣try, that half a Million of Men (for of so many as least consisted the Armies on all
<PB N="8" REF="009774_0005_0F7A56412A78E8D8"/>Sides the last War) are not able to effect their Ruin, might it not naturally follow that our People may be backward to inlist and dispirited when led to the Field: Con∣sequently he should have attended to, and consider'd, before he blindly espoused a Party, and asserted Facts he can have no Evidence to support: But his over Zeal has prevented the bad Effects his round Assertion might otherwise have produced.</P>
<P>There are many other Things in this ex∣traordinary Letter which I would take No∣tice of, but I have exceeded the Bounds I prescribed, which nothing could have induce∣ed me to, but the Regard I have for <HI>Jersey,</HI> and my real Sorrow to see the Authority of its Government prostituted, to support a Party in the Protection of Indians in this Province, which they found themselves un∣able to do in their own.</P>
