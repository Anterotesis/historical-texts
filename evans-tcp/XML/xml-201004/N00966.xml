<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Upon a serious perusal of his Reply, I do not find that he hath shown wherein I have been guilty of one Calumny against him; and for what I have charged him with, he not only in substance and effect, takes with the Charge, but doth much more charge himself there with, than I have done, throughout his Reply; and particularly this doth appear from what he hath said in p 50. of his <HI>Reply,</HI> where he hath expresly these following words, [in answer to what I drew you only by way of Consequence, upon his Opinion; and I did not charge it directly upon him, hoping he would have deny'd the consequence, but He readily grants it] thus, <HI>Nor</HI> (saith he) <HI>shall I part with mine Opinion,</HI> viz. <HI>That the Origine and Cause of the necessity of the first sin is more to be derived from God, than from Man himself; nay, farther,</HI> (saith he) <HI>that the whole cause of the futurity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is owing to the divine Decree, though still the whole sin and blame of it is due to</HI> Adam, <HI>for that in the accomplishing of his A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pstacy he abused his own free Will, and voluntarily transgressed the Command.</HI> Let the intelligent and impartial Reader judge whether in these words he hath not only confirmed my Charge, but has exceeded what I charged him with in his granting my Consequence, which I did not positively and directly load him with, as neither did I with any other of my Consequences, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that <HI>by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on it would follow, that God was the Author of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> This I only inferred by consequence, taking it for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, that he would not allow such a consequence to follow from his Opinion; and that therefore by fair Dispute he was obliged to depart from his Opinion, from which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> consequence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nely follow.

<P>The like injustice he hath used to me, in his second page, in his charging me, <Q>That I had so fouly represented the matter, that he was prevailed on to give the world a fair account of it;</Q> He adds, <Q>That he might, were it worth the while, complain of the dis-ingenuity of the man, but all that have to do with him in a way of Controversie, are well acquainted with that.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> All this is only said, but without the least shadow of Proof, and therefore that <HI>Matchiavelian</HI> Rule, <HI>Fort ter Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, &amp;c.</HI> which he would charge upon me, rebounds wholly on himself, but his affirmation, That all that have to do with me in a way of Controversie, are well acquainted with my dis-ingenuity, is such
<PB N="3" REF="001160_0006_0FB09160A2D9C0C0"/>a Calumny and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>orious Falshood, that few, I think, of his own Gang in <HI>New-England</HI> will assent to; and Thousands who are acquainted with the late printed Controversies I have been en∣gaged in, which has been altogether against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> (except in two single Ski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mishes, one with him, and another with Mr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI>) will affirm the contrary; and I think, I can almost appeal to Mr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> himself, and most of their way in <HI>New-England,</HI> in my printed Controversies against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> whether Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> hath not charged me very unjustly. Indeed he hath in this his Charge not a little gratified the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but he hath in this his so doing as much disobliged all true Christian Professors, who have read my Books of Controversies against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who have generally commended my sincerity in what I have done in way of Controversie against them, for above these ten years past, and which is more than all, that I have the Testi∣mony of a good Conscience within me, to my sincerity. There∣fore what Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> hath charged me in this, seems to be in prejudice against me, for my former engagement in Controversie against him, and some of his Brethren at <HI>Boston,</HI> when I was under the Profession of a <HI>Quaker;</HI> and though as I have freely acknowledged, and do now acknowledge, in divers points of my Controversie then with the <HI>Boston</HI> Ministers, I was blame worthy, and in error, yet I erred through ignorance, and not willfully, and having obtained Mercy and forgiveness of God, through Faith and Repentance, it would be very dis-ingenuous and unchristian in Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> to object that against me.</P>
<P>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2. He saith, "My Narrative (<HI>viz.</HI> that contained in my printed Sheet) "is not a Disputation, but a Remonstrance against "something that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him with</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That it is a Remonstrance against him, I grant, but that it is not also a Disputation, he hath not shown; for most part of that sheet is Argumentative, and contains such Arguments against his Opinion, that he has given no sollid Reply unto, but either Evasions or such Concessions that sink him deeper in the mire.</P>
<P>To my calling it <HI>A dangerous and hurtful Opinion</HI> maintained by him, he Replys, <Q>That a thing may be dangerous <HI>per se,</HI> and <HI>per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and that if there be any danger in this, it is only in the latter sense,</Q> shall be endeavour'd to be made appear an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001160_0007_0FB09162294162D8"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> Whether his performance be according to his promised endeavour, shall be lest to the judicious and impartial▪ Read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. But whereas he seemeth to disown that he maintained any such Opinion as the Title of my printed sheet beareth; and that this was neither asserted by him, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tidem verbis, i. e.</HI> in so many words, nor that which was said, insisted on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a poor evasion, and a very unjust ground to fix a Calumny upon me; for I was so far from asserting he did so affirm, to all I charged on him, <HI>totidem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erbis,</HI> that in pag. 2. of my printed sheet, I said, <Q>I did not hear them (<HI>viz.</HI> either the Students or Mr. <HI>Willard</HI>) affirm that all sinful Actions of the Creature are determined of God, so that they act them necessarily, so as by any explicit Speech to as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt it, but their manner of answering and arguing doth clearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prove it was their Opinion.</Q> The Calumny therefore that he chargeth on me lyeth at his own door; for tho' I charged not the Opinion in full upon him, <HI>tot dom Verbis,</HI> as I expressed it sufficiently, I did not yet the equivalent of it, in other words, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did charge upon him, and I do still charge upon him, and (as I have shown) he hath charged himself yet more than I had do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as in the above Quotation given by me, out of his pag. 50. doth plainly appear.</P>
<P>Pag. 4. <Q>He never yet professed himself to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Independent,</HI> not yet a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> believing there may be mistakes in both parties.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> And a little, I think, he has professed himself to be of any other Profession commonly known in Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, wherein he seemed to be very singular. But why doth he not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fess him∣self to be an <HI>Independent?</HI> for both the Name and Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems to belong to him These called <HI>Independent</HI> are so called because they acknowledge no Superiour over them in the Church, under Christ, appointed by him, so as to have any Ec∣clesiastical Rule or Authority over them; the which Definition of an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> seems to agree as fully to <HI>M.

<HEAD>SECT II.</HEAD>
<P>PAg. 7, 8. He charges it on me, <Q>That I seem to make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Novelty, and a thing of prejudice to the better part of good men, that the Decree of God is immutable, and that man hath a free Will, and that it is not impeded in its proper Liberty by this Decree, which is maintained by the greatest <HI>Protestant</HI> Divines.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In this Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> hath very unfairly and dis-ingenuously represented me, as if I had denyed the Decree of God about <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, or the sins of his Posterity, or that Gods Decree is immutable; neither of which I did deny in my printed sheet, but on the coutrary I expresly and positively said, pag. 3. <Q>That the Thesis it self, taken in a sound sence, I grant most willingly to be true, <HI>viz. That the Immutability of Gods Decree doth not take away the liberty of the Creature;</HI></Q> for it was not the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esis</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I would have impugned, taken in a sound sence, but the <HI>Consectaries</HI> inferred from the Thesis, that I would have impugned, and did impugne in my printed Sheet, which Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> did allow to follow, and which I judged, and still judge, he ought not to have allowed. Also, in my pag. 2. I did say, <Q>I willingly grant, that there is frequently a divine Determination of the Will both of Men and Angels in good Actions, and that the said Determina∣tion can well consist with the liberty of the Will.</Q> But why Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> has taken so little notice of this, that he chargeth the Contradictory on me, <HI>I</HI> leave to impartial Readers, whether it be not without all ground, to render me very erroneous and heter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dox, and contrary to the greatest Protestant Divines.</P>
<P>But for my further Vindication, well agreeing with what is said in my printed Sheet, I affirm,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That all Gods Decrees are immutable.</P>
<P>2dly, That the Decrees of God about the sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> and all other sins of men, do not take away the liberty or free-will of the Creatures, whether Men or Devils.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001160_0009_0FB09169A41C08A8"/>
3dly, That Gods Decree about the sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> and all other sins of Men and Devils, is permissive, and yet not barely permis∣sive, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffective, in a most powerful manner; yet not so, as that the Cause of the Futurity of the sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> or of other Men and Devils, is owing to the same, but upon the infallible Fore-knowledge of the Futurition of their sins, through Gods permission, in a most wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and powerful manner, setting bounds and limits to them, and powerfully disposing and ordering the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his Glory, and the good of his Chosen, even all the Heirs of Salvation.</P>
<P>4thly, That though the Decree of God about the sins of <HI>Adam,</HI> and other men, is not <HI>Subjectively,</HI> or with respect to God, Conditional, yet <HI>Objectively,</HI> and with respect to second Causes, and the connection of the Means and the End, is Conditional, according to that noted saying of <HI>Aq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nas,</HI> well approved by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Authors, <HI>Deu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hac p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pter hoc, et hoc propter hoc, sed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hoc;</HI> and to this Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> seemeth to agree, when he saith, <HI>It is a Truth, That God hath decreed Hypotheses, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hypothetically.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But by these Propositions laid down by me, wherein (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judge) I agree with all sound Protestant Divines, as well as with the Church of England, it doth not follow, that either <HI>Adam</HI> or other men sinned necessarily, either by Gods Decree, or by determining their Wills necessarily to sin, by the actual execution of his Decree in time.</P>
<P>In the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Second</HI> of these Propositions Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> seems to agree with me, as also in the <HI>Fourth,</HI> but in the <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>Fifth</HI> lyeth a great difference betwixt us, especially in that part of the <HI>Third,</HI> where I say, The cause of the futurity of the sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> or of other men and Devils, is not owing to the divine Decree, and also in the <HI>Fifth,</HI> throughout, we greatly differ.</P>
<P>Pag. 9. Whereas he saith, <Q>I do not, <HI>totidem verb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> profes∣sedly deny the Truth of the The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s defended by the Respontent,
<PB N="7" REF="001160_0010_0FB0916B27377D60"/>though it is manifest in the whole, that my Pick was against that.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In this he greatly wrongs me, and that most dis-ingenu∣ously, for I was so far from denying the Truth of the Thesis, professedly <HI>totidem verbis,</HI> that professedly <HI>totidem verbis,</HI> I did grant it, in a sound sence, to be true, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the immuta∣bility of the Decree doth not take away the liberty of the Creature.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 9. He chargeth me afresh with another thing, which he calleth a meer Calumny, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That according to him, the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI></Q> according to Gods Decree, was necessary. And a little after he saith, <Q>They deny evermore the Decree to be any Cause of sin; for the Decree is an immanent Act, whereas the divine Act which is causal of any thing out of himself, is a transient Act.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In this he wrongs me several ways, as well as he con∣tradicts himself; for, <HI>first,</HI> I did not charge him to hold, that the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> was necessary, simply and only by virtue of Gods Decree; for beside the Decree, which is an immanent Act in God, <HI>I</HI> did add both in my Title and Explanation, <HI>Gods Determination both o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Will of</HI> Adam, <HI>and of all other men to sin;</HI> Which Determination of God, if any such were, that did cause men necessarily to sin, was a transient act. But, 2dly, It no wise followeth, that because Gods Decree is an immanent Act, that therefore it is not any Cause of sin, if such a Decree were, decreeing, That <HI>Adam</HI> was necessarily to sin. This is very false Philosophy, as well as no true Divinity in Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> as if an immanent act in God could be no cause of any thing, <HI>adextra,</HI> or without him; for though it be not the next and immediate Cause, yet it is the first and remote Cause of the transient Act, and of all Gods Works, <HI>ad extra.</HI> For I ask Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> Was not his Will and Purpose to write his Book, call'd, <HI>A Peply, &amp;c.</HI> an immanent Act in him? and yet <HI>I</HI> suppose he will not deny but it was the remote Cause of it, though his Hand and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en were the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in mediate and next Causes of it▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as I have find, as in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wrongs me, so he contradicts himself, in having said, pag. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <Q>That the whole cause of the infallible Futurity of the first sin, is owing to the divine
<PB N="8" REF="001160_0011_0FB0916CB7DB1E38"/>Decree.</Q> But how can it be owing to the divine Decree, if the divine D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cause of it, not so much as remotely, let me put him in mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Causa Causa est Causa C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>suti,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come afterwards further to be discoursed of.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> is warm to purpose, but to no purpose of true Reason; for, <HI>first,</HI> though God be the true, and <HI>I</HI> think, the only cause of all created Beings, such as all Sub∣stances are, whether Spirits or Bodies, yet, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, many Philosophers say, That Actions of created Beings, are not pro∣perly <HI>Beings,</HI> but <HI>Modes</HI> of <HI>Beings,</HI> which <HI>I</HI> never heard called an intollerable Absurdity, not to say Blasphemy.

I proved my Consequence thus, That if the Cause of a Cause is the Cause of the caused Thing,
<PB N="14" REF="001160_0017_0FB0917F876D1B98"/>as God is the Cause of the Determination of mans Will to that sinful Action;</Q> so that Determination is the Cause of the same. To this he answereth, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> restrain the Maxim to Causes that are</HI> essentially subordinated, <HI>and assure us, that it is false in things that are only by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or contingently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He doth not fairly represent what Logicians say in the case; for the <HI>Maxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> holds not in Causes essentially subordinate, unless when the subordinate Cause is necessarily determined by the superiour Cause. For all good Divines, as well as good Philoso∣phers, hold. That all Creatores are essentially subordinated to God Almighty in their Beings and Actions, and yet he is not that Author of their sinful Actions. And if Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own the essential Subordination of Creatures to Almighty God, but only by accident and contingently subordinated, it is a great Error; for it impugnes the great dependency that all Creatures have upon God Almighty, and renders the Creatures a sort of Independents one way, as Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> himself is another way. But, if Creatures be only by accident and contingently subordi∣nated to God, then it may happen, that they may act without any dependence on him, and consequently they may act without any Determination of God, so as necessarily to produce any sin∣ful Action. But though the affirming of the <HI>essential Subordi∣nation</HI> of Creatures to God Almighty, doth not infer his deter∣mining them necessarily to produce sinful actions, yet the denyal of such essential Subordination of Creatures to God in their Actions, will plainly infer, that they are not under the accessity of any Determination to sinful Actions.</P>
<P>Again, the abovesaid Maxim holds good in Causes not essen∣tially subordinated, as when the Devil tempted <HI>Eve</HI> to sin, and <HI>Eve</HI> tempted <HI>Adam,</HI> both the <HI>Devil</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were moral causes of <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, and both culpable; and yet neither was <HI>Adam</HI> essentially subordinated to <HI>Eve,</HI> nor <HI>Eve</HI> to the <HI>Devil;</HI> nor was there any Subordination in the case at all, of our first Parents to the Devil, in their primitive state of Creation.</P>

To this be Replys, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very</HI> Chimerical Action, <HI>that hath neither Matter nor Form di∣stinguishable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Here again he speaks Dictator-like, without all <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of Reason; for, morally speaking, what real distinction can we make betwixt the inward act of the Mind, which is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God and our Neighbour, and the sinfulness of it? for, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some sinful Action, such as Hatred of God and our Neighbours, intrinsecally and essentially evil and sinful? Whether the sin∣fulness of them be rather a Deficiency than an Efficiency, is not material in the present Controversie; for Actions, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as Things may be essentially deficient, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are essentially (negatively at least) deficient of the Perfections of Man, though they have no moral Deficiency. And all Divines, as well as moral Philosophers, distinguish be wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Actions that are intrinsecally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and sinful; and others that are extrinsecally such; as also be∣twixt Actions intrinsecally good, as the Love of God and our Neighbour, and acts of Veracity, Sobriety, Humility, Justice, and other Actions that are good extrinsecally, only because they are commanded by some positive Precepts of God Almighty, such as many Precepts of <HI>Moses</HI> Law were, as that of Circumci∣sion and the Sacrifices, and Observation of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Festivals.</P>

<P>Pag. 23, 24.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>first,</HI> That the Exorbitancy of a sinful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, is a sinful Action, implyeth a Contradi∣ction; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might be both sinful and not sinful at once.</P>
<P>Again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Suppose a Distinction, yet seeing the Exorbitancy is the necessary effect of the Action, if God be the Cause and Author of the Action, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the Cause and Author of the sinfully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 26. He saith, <Q>It is a common received Doctrine in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Churches,</HI> and Accademies, that God concur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every operation of second Causes, so as immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by himself to influence upon every Action of the Creature.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> But all this proves nothing, that all sinful Actions of men necessarily come to pass by Gods determining mens Will necessarily to produce any sinful Actions.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001160_0020_0FB0918413B6FF40"/>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. He proceeds to argue, <Q>That God cannot be under such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Law as makes it unjust in him to determine the sinful actions of men, by several Mediums and Arguments.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> But he states not the Ques;tion fairly. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. God is not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot be under a Law, though his own essential Justice, Truth and Goodness is a Law to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, It is not against the essential Justice, Truth and Goodness of God, so to determine the sinful Actions of men, upon his fore-knowledge of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turity, as to over-rule them to his Glory, bound and limit them by his Power and Wisdom, as he doth bound the proud Waves of the Sea, and determines or confines them within their Banks. And in this sence, according to Scripture stile (<HI>Acts</HI> 2.23. chap. 4.28) I own Gods determining the sinful Actions of men; but not so as thereby men are necessitated to produce them, which is his corrupt sence and gloss upon the word <HI>Determin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on</HI> and <HI>Determinate,</HI> which has an innocent sense, according to Scrip∣ture stile, as above given by me; whereas his sense of it is most absurd, being repugnant to Gods essential Truth, Justice and Goodness, and other his essential Perfections.</P>
<P>Pag 27. His first Argument. is from <HI>Gods All-difficiency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> But allowing, in a sound sence, Gods All-efficiency, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en so far, as that God hath an actual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
<PB N="18" REF="001160_0021_0FB0918A4DCBEBE0"/>and all their operations, yet all this proves not that this all∣sufficiency of God, or his actual influence upon men, and their operations doth so determine them, that they necessarily produce their sinful actions, no more, than because the Sun with his beat or warmth, has an actual immediate influence on all men, to enable their Bodies to act both good and evil, as well as it hath on Vegetables and Brutes, that therefore men are necessarily determined by the Sun to produce their actions, whether good or evil; for the influence of the Sun, however immediate upon men, leaves them to an indifference to act, or not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, until by the free election and motion or their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They determine themselves; and no less doth the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God Almighty leave men to an indifference, as to all sinful actions, at least to act, or not to act, at they determine themselves accor∣dingly; but with this difference, that the Sun is but a secondary general Cause of humane actions; whereas God Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> first and supream Cause over all, but no Proper immediate Cause of the sinful action, being in the case not the necessitating Cause, but what School-men call <HI>Cause fine qua non.</HI> God indeed is the cause of the immediate ability whereby man produceth a sinful action, and the immediate Cause of that immediate Ability, but not of the sinful action of man it self, because, when man sineth, he abuses that power and ability which God giveth him to act, and the abuse of that ability is not of God, but of Man himself; and therefore I judge it ought not to be said not thought, that God is properly a cause of any sinful actions; for seeing God hath, by his revealed Will, commanded men not to commit any sinful action, it cannot be thought, that by his secret Will, he willeth men to produce it, and to produce it necessarily, as Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> hath affirmed. And seeing God has decreed men to produce sinful actions, by Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Opinion, as in pag. 50. of his Book, <HI>That the Origine and Cause of the Necessity of the first sin is more to be derived from God than from Man himself:</HI> This his Opinion necessarily infers <HI>Two Wills</HI> in God, contradictory the one to the other; for by his Decree, which is his <HI>secret Will,</HI> he willeth men to commit all the sinful actions which they do commit, and by his <HI>Revealed Will</HI> he doth not will them to commit them, but forbiddeth them; which at
<PB N="19" REF="001160_0022_0FB0918B66511CD0"/>it is a plain Contradiction, so it is contrary to that Veracity, Truth. Justice and Goodness, that is essentially in God, by a <HI>secret Will</HI> to will one thing, and by his <HI>Revealed Will</HI> to will the quite Contradictory; as this is repugnant to the Veracity and Sincerity of a good earthly King, to will secretly that his Subjects to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>it such actions as trespass against his Laws, which at his revealed Will, so it is no less, but rather much more repugnant to God essential Veracity, Sincerity, Justice, Goodness, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Perfections.</P>

<P>AS for the Comparison Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> brings, pag. 25. to show the distinction betwixt the Action that is sinful, and the sin∣fulness of it <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> (saith he) <HI>is frequently illustrated by a Mans riding a lame Horse, he puts forward the Horse to go, but his going laws is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Rider, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Lameness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This Comparison is same in divers respects. For, <HI>first,</HI> one main part of the Controversie betwixt us, was about the Cause and Necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that first sin of all committed by him. Now before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was not lame, but sound. But if God Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so determine the sound Will of <HI>Adam,</HI> that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> necessarily produce that sinful Action of eating the fobidden Fruit, he was the Physical Cause of that Action, and consequently the Moral; even as when a man, suppose a Smith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Horse, pricketh him, both knowingly and wil∣lingly in one of his sect, the Horse indeed is lame, but the cause of this lameness is the Smith, both the Physical and Moral Cause; for because he did it both knowingly and willingly, therefore the Smith is very blame worthy, and consequently the Moral Cause of that Lameness; and by the like necessary Consequence, by Mr. <HI>Willard</HI>'s Opinion, God is not only the Physical, but the Moral Cause of <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin and lameness; which is must afford and blasphemous. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not directly on M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Opinion, but to be the necessary and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Opinion, which therefore I would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very dangerous and hurt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ Again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Horse forward, with a Will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="20" REF="001160_0023_0FB0918D0546F3C0"/>strowed with Iron Nails and Pricks, that he knoweth will lame his Horse, or any other way use his Horse, to cause him go lame, so as to be the Physical cause of his Lameness, he is thereby blame worthy, and consequently the Moral Cause of his Lameness. And indeed, in so for the similitude quadrates, that as the Rider puts forth his Horse to go, who brought him forth sound out of the Stable, yet out of his meet Will, he either pricks him in the foot, or some other way causeth him to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, both knowingly and of set purpose, the Horse-man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rider is not only the Physical, but the Moral Cause of the Horses Lameness, and the man is only Morally blame-worthy, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Horse. So if God determined the Will of <HI>Adam,</HI> so as necessarily to produce that sinful Action of eating the forbidden fruit, as he was the Physical Cause of it, he was no less the Moral Cause thereof, seeing whatever God doth, he doth both knowingly and willingly. And, <HI>lastly,</HI> He that rideth upon a lame Horse, suppose he is not the cause of his lameness at first, yet if he put him on to ride a a Journey, he will be the cause of his being more lame (as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> known by common experience) and not only the Physical but the Moral Cause thereof. And by the like Consequence, if God Almighty determine the Wills of sinful men, so as to necessitate them to produce sinful actions, as thereby they become the more sinful, so he is more the cause thereof, both Physical and Moral. Thus I think Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> had better spared his Com∣parison of a lame Horse, which has the more exposed and dis∣advantaged his Cause, as I appeal to the judicious and impartial Reader.</P>
<P>Pag. 29. His second Medium, to prove his Opinion, is from the Nature of Gods universal Government over all Creatures, and their Actions: The substance of which Argument is com∣prehended in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se words of his pag. 29. <Q>Nothing (saith he) is more notorious than that God not only useth the Instru∣mentality of sinful men, but even of their sinful actions, in the great Affairs of the World, whereby he accomplisheth his purposes of his Praise.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> All this, in a sound sense, is readily granted; but that
<PB N="21" REF="001160_0024_0FB09191E22DE4A8"/>it doth therefore follow, That God doth so decree or determine the Wills of men to produce their sinful Actions, and that necessarily, is no ways apparent, more than that it will follow, that because a Carpenter or Joyner useth some crooked Iron Instruments to work by, that therefore he made them; or that because a good and wise King useth some of his Subjects wicked actions to be an instrumental occasion to make good Laws, for the Reforming his Subjects, by the severe Punishments provided by those Laws against wicked actions, that it therefore followeth, that the said King did determine any of his Subjects to commit those wicked Actions, so as they are necessitated to commit them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>HIs third Medium, to prove his Opinion, is from <HI>Gods Willing,</HI> (as he words it) <HI>that sin should be in the world, and from his fore-knowledge of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That the Will of God about sin, and sinful Actions of Men and Devils, is <HI>permissive,</HI> and not only barely permissive, but <HI>effective,</HI> in the sound sence above given by me, so as in a most powerful and effective manner to bound and limit, and dispose of mens sins to his praise, by his Soveraign over-ruling Arm, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> granted; and that he hath a most perfect and infallible fore-know∣ledge of all mens sins, that ever were to come to pass in time; but still, Mr <HI>Willard</HI> begs the Consequence, That therefore by Gods Decree, and his Determination of mens Wills, they neces∣sarily produce all their sinful Actions; which, I say, is no true nor proper Conclusion, and for which he giveth no shadow of proof.</P>
<P>Pag. 30 His fourth Medium is from <HI>the Divine Prediction of future things, which,</HI> he saith, <HI>is an evidence of the certain futurity of them. New whence</HI> (saith he) <HI>should this Futurity proceed? neither from his simple Intelligence, nor from his Omnipotency,</HI> and conse∣quently he infers, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t must be entirely determined by his Will;</HI> for
<PB N="22" REF="001160_0025_0FB091952E2EF3C8"/>which he quotes <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.11. <HI>That God worketh all things after the Counsel of his own Will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That all the Works of God are wrought by him, after the Counsel of his own Will, is granted; but that the sins and evil that Men or Devils work, are the work of God, or to be attributed to him, as to their proper Cause, is denyed; for then he would be the Author of them; for of whatever Work any Agent is the proper Cause, of the same he is the Author. Sin and Evil and Wickedness are said in Scripture to be the works of sinful Men and Devils, but <HI>all the Works of God are good,</HI> Psal. 111.7. <HI>The Works of his hands are Verity and Judgment,</HI> and Ps. 33.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>All his works are done in Truth.</HI> Nor doth the divine Prediction of future things prove his Opinion. And in answer to his Question, we must first distinguish of the several sorts of future things; for some of them were Substances, and of these, some <HI>Sestets</HI> some <HI>Bodies,</HI> and some <HI>Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded of Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> as Men. Again, some are Actions proceeding from Substances, as their proper Cause, some whereof are necessary Agents, and not free, as the actions of Beasts, Fowles and Fishes; others are free, as the Actions of Men. Now to answer directly to his Question, The Futurity of all created Substances, is entirely from God, both from his Power and Will, and also from his Wisdom and Goodness. And the Futurity of the Actions of necessary Agents, is from the Futurity of the Agents themselves. And the Futurity of the Actions of free-Agents, that are sinful (or generally indifferent) is from the Futurity of the free Agents themselves, such as Men and Angels are; for as the Branches, Leaves and Fruit of a Tree lie hidden in the Seed or Root of it, so all Actions, whether of necessary or of free Agents, lie in the Agents themselves, as in their Seeds and Roots or Principles, before they be brought forth into act or effect. And as it doth not surpass Mans knowledge to know what Actions will proceed from necessary Agents, and that by certain knowledge, in great part, so nor doth it surpass Gods knowledge, to know most certainly and infallibly what Actions will proceed from free Agents, such as Men and Angels, for this far surpassing knowledge, or fore knowledge of God concern∣ing the actions of free Agents, must needs be granted to God,
<PB N="23" REF="001160_0026_0FB09196C3DFE5C8"/>who is infinite in Knowledge, as well as in all other Perfections▪ otherwise wherein should be, in this case, excell the finite Un∣derstandings of Men, who can fore-tell the actions of necessary Agents, in great part, and that certainly? But to say that God fore∣knows the futurity of the sinful actions of free Agents, because be has decreed them to come to pass, (after which Decree they become as necessary as the actions of any necessary Agents) is to give to God Almighty a very imperfect kind of Knowledge, little above that of Men and Angels. Beside that, such a Notion doth impugne the perfection of Gods Holiness, as well as of his Knowledge.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, I have given a more perfect Scheme of the matter, than Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> hath done, and so far satisfied his De∣mand, if he will be reasonably satisfied.</P>

<P>FRom pag. 32. to pag. 40. Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> is so nauseously tendious about the Distinction of the <HI>Materiale</HI> and the <HI>Formale</HI> of fin∣ful actions, (which I have so fully above shewed,) makes nothing for the defence of his Opinion, that for me to enlarge upon it, by noticing his Impertinencies, would render me equally tedious and guilty of Tautologizing with him. Only I cannot omit to take notice of some of his Impertinencies upon this Head.</P>
<P>To my Arguments in my printed Sheet, repeated by him, pag. 33. <Q>What a just and good man forbids another to do, he cannot, or at least he ought not to perswade him to do, other∣wise he would do unjustly, therefore what God forbids a man to do, it is repugnant to his Justice to determine that man to do.</Q></P>
<P>This be quarrels with, as <HI>loosely formed, and as savouring of a Quaker.</HI> But he is held so fast in the Net by it, that in vain he seeks to get out. It is the ordinary Policy of weak Disputants, to cry out against the weakness of their Opponents Arguments, though ever so strong. But how does he answer?</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He tells his Reader, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at a just Man and good, during his state of Imperfection, may so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a man to do his Duty.</HI> But what is
<PB N="24" REF="001160_0027_0FB091982E110F70"/>to the purpose? My Argument was not what a good or just Man might happen to do through humane imperfection, but that be cannot, in point of Justice, perswade him to do, what he for∣bids him; and therefore I carefully added, [<HI>Or at least ought not to perswade him to do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He saith, <HI>To argue from the Creature to God, in point of Justice, bath already been detested of Folly.</HI> But he meerly saith it without all real proof. Nor do I find any thing like a proof of it, but in pag. 30. of his Book, where he saith, <Q>God is not eyed to the same Laws that man is, who cannot purposely suffer another to sin, when he can prevent it, without involving himself in Guilt; so that thor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is no injustice in God to suffer that, which if man should suffer, he should be unjust.</Q> And what he again saith, pag. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <Q>That God hath a dispensing Power, at least in regard of some of his Laws, as in the case of the <HI>Israelites</HI> borrowing the <HI>Egyptians</HI> Jewels, and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s offering up his Son.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sw.</HI> Although there are certain positive Laws, to which God hath tyed men, that be hath not tyed himself to, as in disposing the Estates or Lives of men, according to his good pleasure, which is always according to excellent Wisdom and Justice, he being the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Proprietary of all things both in Heaven and Earth, yet whatever assential Laws of Truth, Justice and Goodness be has bound us to, in all these he is a Law to himself, so that be cannot lye nor deceive, being contrary to his essential Truth, Jussice and Condness; and as contrary it is to the same, to com∣mand and will one thing by his <HI>revealed Will,</HI> and will the quite contradictory by his <HI>secr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Will.</HI> And that God permits men to fin, is no wise contrary to his essential Truth, Goodness and Justice, because he can bring good out of it, which we cannot do. But to determine men to sin necessarily, and yet not only blame them, but punish them so severely for it, is evidently against his essential Truth, Justice and Goodness, according to that above quoted place, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.23, 25. which he meerly evades, but doth not fairly answer.</P>
<P>Pag. 34. Here Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> doth greatly wrong me, by falsly quoting the words of my Argument, and then upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse
<PB N="25" REF="001160_0028_0FB09199C3E33D40"/>Foundation charging me with proving <HI>idem per idem, a meer Tautology;</HI> for thus he quotes me, <HI>If it be unjust, then it is unjust, and much more so in God.</HI> But these were not my words, nor way of arguing, but thus, pag. 4. of my printed Sheet, <HI>ad sin.</HI> <Q>If to perswade or advise a man to do what is forbidden him, be unjust, therefore for God to determine the Will of Man to what is forbidden by God, is unjust, or rather much more unjust.</Q> Here it is evident the Argument is not <HI>idem per idem;</HI> for both the Antecedent and Consequent are different Proposi∣tions; and the stress or my Argument lies not meerly upon what is just or unjust by positive written Precept, with which God can dispence, but upon essential Justice, both in God and Men, that he cannot dispense with.</P>
<P>Pag. 36. He puts another Wrong upon me, <Q>That by the <HI>Materiale</HI> of the sinful Action, I must intend an action which is sinful, as it is an Action;</Q> and so he chargeth me with a Contradiction in the Expression. And thus I know not how oft he useth the Distinction of an action <HI>Qua</HI> sinful, and of an action <HI>Qua</HI> action, as in pag. 38. Again, in pag. 24 he saith, <Q>The sinfulness of the action doth not arise from the nature of the action, as it is an action, but from the moral Deficiency of the Agent.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> His thus distinguishing betwixt an action <HI>Qua</HI> sinful and <HI>Qua</HI> action, is nothing to his purpose; for though an action is not sinful, as an action, otherwise all mens actions would be sinful <HI>per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,</HI> yet every finful action is finful, as it is such an action in <HI>specie,</HI> and also in <HI>individuo,</HI> though not <HI>in genere,</HI> barely considered as an action. As every wicked Man is a wicked Man, not as a Man, yet as <HI>[such]</HI> a Man, having committed such Wicked∣ness. And though we may distinguish betwixt the finfulness of an action, and the action, as it is an action, <HI>mentally,</HI> yet there is no real distinction, <HI>ex parte rei,</HI> betwixt the finfulness of the action, and the action it self considered in <HI>specie,</HI> as well as indi∣vidually, under all due Circumstances.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I have already, I know not how oft, answered to such Impertinencies, that we ought to distinguish betwixt what is sin∣ful <HI>per se,</HI> and what <HI>per accidens.</HI> The matter of the Prayer that God commands to wicked men, is not finful, but the mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> how wicked Men perform it, as in Hypocrisie and bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?

That God commands the matter or <HI>Material<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of sinful actions, as Murder, Rapine, Adultery? doth he not expresly forbid it? And yet to decree and determine the Wills of men to commit these actions, which he hath forbid, is to reflect most reproach∣fully on Gods essential Truth, Justice and Goodness.</P>
<P>Pag. 40. Here again Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> most unjustly chargeth me to hold a Principle which I do no wise hold, and which I never gave him any just ground to think, I hold; as where he saith, <Q>Nor doth Mr. <HI>Keith</HI> acknowledge Gods Determination in our sence, any more to a good than to an evil Action; for he sup∣poseth that it would destroy the Deity of that <HI>little Idol Free-Will,</HI> which he cannot endure; and therefore all the Determi∣nation which he will allow in either, is only Moral, and that is but Metaphorical, if not Catechrestical.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I have expresly, as he knoweth in his Conscience, owned Gods Determination of the Wills of Men and Angels frequently in good Actions, and that the said divine Determination can well consist with the liberty of the Will, to wit, that called <HI>Libertas Individuation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and I did really mean it in a Physical fence, and not in a Moral only, though not excluding the Moral in good actions, as nor doth Mr. <HI>Willard.</HI> But if <HI>Free-Will</HI> be such an <HI>Idol</HI> in his sence, why is he so earnest to reconcile Gods immutable

<P>And beside all this, according to Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> definition of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> it will agree to God Almighty; for thus be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Liberty of the Will, p. 14. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> forma∣liter libertas sit a est,</HI> i. e. <HI>Liberty (v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> of the Will) <HI>is primarily, and formally placed in the Lubency of Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son.</HI> An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pag. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he saith, <HI>That in a free Agent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> away, but as long as he still acts spontaneously, be acts freely.</HI> Which Definition would agree to <HI>God Almighty,</HI> though he were conceived to be a most necessary Agent, both in the Creation of the World, and in his Decree to create it, according to Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Notion of Free-Will.

<P>Pag. 51. Nor is he less injurious to me, in making me acknow∣ledge, <HI>the failing of my Memory in many points,</HI> in my printed sheet, which he, good man, doth easily forgive in me.

But upon my due comparing his printed Book of four sheets with my printed sheet, I find not that be hath charged me with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> failure of Memory justly in any one thing.</P>
<P>Pag. 44. To my Argument, That on the suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion of <HI>Adam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Fall being necessary, and also the fall of Angels▪ that then they must have excuse.

As when <HI>Zeno,</HI> the Sect Master of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> beat his Slave for stealing, and the Slave excused the fact, <HI>That he was Necessitated to do it.</HI> And said the Master, <HI>I am Necessitated to beat thee for it;</HI> yet both of them did voluntarily what they did, according to Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Notion. But as Bishop <HI>Bramhall</HI> well observes in his dispute with Mr <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbs,</HI> if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve had forced the Rod out of his Masters hand, and continued beat∣ing him severely, until his Master had owned he was under no necessity of beating him, he had, in fact, confuted him.</P>
<P>As for the rest of his Book, as indeed the far greatest part of the whole, being meer Banter and Satyr, with bitter Reflections and idle Impertinencies, I shall not spend either time or Paper to make much answer thereto, having sufficiently answered to all that seemed material; and what of matter in the latter part, (particularly from pag. 45. to pag. 51) is contained, is fully answered, in substance, in the fore-going Sections of this Book.

And as to that Passage of the Convocation at <HI>Dubline</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> quoted by him, <Q>God from all Eternity did, by his unchangeable Counsel, ordain whatsoever comes to pass, yet so as thereby no Violence is offered to the Wills of the reasonable Creatures, nor the contingency of second Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s is taken away, but rather established,</Q> ought to be explained by that other Passage, quoted by Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> out of Bishop <HI>Davenant</HI> his answer to <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d,</HI> where the Bishop saith, <HI>The divine Decree moveth no man, much less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> determineth him to these wicked Actions.</HI> This, I think, is point blank Contradictory to Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Opinion; for if God determines not men to sinful actions irresistibly, then those sinful actions do not necessarily follow from either Gods Decree or Determination of them. And as to the signification of the word <HI>[to Ordain]</HI> it is taken two ways, one way in a fase sence, as signifying not any necessary determining them to come to pass, but upon Gods intallible fore-fight of their coming to pass, through his permission, his ordering and disposing them, and over-ruling them to his glory. The other way, in a wrong sence, as to sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> God determining them necessarily to come to pass, which I cannot approve. And for the Term <HI>[Necessary]</HI> when understood with respect to sinful actions, by necessity of Logical Consequence, but not Physical Consequence, as the con∣clu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of a Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingism, That is also granted; but that doth no ways prove nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vour Mr. <HI>Willard</HI>'s Opinion.

<P>But how unwary and inconsiderate hath Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> been, to quote in his Book, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 63. two Passages out of Bishop <HI>Dav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>,</HI> in answer to <HI>Howard,</HI> as making for him, which evidently make against him. The first is this;</P>
<P><Q>The immutability of Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rnal Decree, is a thing un∣questionable, but that God hath made any Decree of Repro∣bation, whereby Reprobates are NECESSITATED or CAUSED to live and dye in for, is utterly false.</Q></P>
<P>The other is this;</P>
<P><Q>Neither doth he over-rule, by any Decree of his, the Wills of Reprobate and Wicked Mens that their Liberty is extinguish∣ed, or a <HI>Necessary</HI> of committing this or that particular sin i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imposed on them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> here, <HI>Reader,</HI> the words <HI>Necessary</HI> and <HI>Necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated</HI> to sin, so much in reality pleaded for by Mr. <HI>Willard, in sensu Composite,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parte Dei,</HI> and his Physical determining men necessarily to sin or sinful actions, plainly exploded by Bishop <HI>Davenant.</HI> What think ye, good Readers, was not Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> napping when he quoted those Passages, which fulfills that Proverb, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ande</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>And whereas I had once in my Printed Sheet used the word, <HI>[ya mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e]</HI> which I explained this, <HI>i. e.</HI> to determine them to do evil; and once again in another place I used the word <HI>[M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved]</HI> which I there explained thus, or <HI>determined them so to do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> to sin, Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> very unfairly chargeth me with a fallacy, for using the word <HI>Moved</HI> (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in signification with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣cermined)</HI>

And to render me impertinent, he puts a false sense upon the word <HI>Moved,</HI> far other than I intended, as if by <HI>moving</HI> and <HI>determining</HI> I intended Gods per∣swading men to sin, whereas I really intended it in a Physical sense. But still I affirm, that it reflects as much on the esten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Justice of God, Physrcally to determine men, so as necessarily to sin, as to perswade them by any moral Swasion, and doth as much excuse the sinner, and render sin, yea, the greatest sins light as a feather, and the whole mass or aggregate of them; for as I did argue in my printed Sheet, If men sin necessarily, they might have excuse, <HI>for Necessity hath no Law.</HI> Upon which Axio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he puts this odd gloss, <HI>That it</HI> ONLY <HI>intends, that when Men are in extream need they will regard no Laws.</HI> But that it ONLY intends that sence of his, or chiefly, is said without all proof; The genuine sence of it is, That what men are necessitated to do, it can be against no Law of God, nor just Law of men to do, unless men have brought that Necessity upon themselves.</P>
<P>But whereas he saith, <HI>What if he should invert is, and say, All Necessity hath a Law, for Necessity is in some sence a Lawes it self.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> hath well enforced my Argument against himself; for if <HI>Necessity</HI> be a Law to it self, and that all Necessity hath a Law, then seeing, (according to his Opinion) God doth Determine men to commit all the sins they do commit, and that they commit them of Necessity, as well as <HI>Adams</HI> first sin was of Necessity, and owing to the divine Decree, as he hath affirmed; then s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing this Necessity is of God, and is a Law, it is a Law of God, and consequently all sin is a fulfilling of a Law of God, and so it is sin, and no sin, by a genuine Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quence from his Opinion, which how scandalous it is to assert, <HI>I</HI> leave to all intelligent and impartial Readers to judge, and even to Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> himself, when he is a wakoned out of his Nap.</P>

<P>I hope, after these plain Quotations out of Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Book, he will not again charge me with so <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly representing him,</HI> and printing Calumnies against him, seeing he hath given forth to the World in print all that I have charged him with, and what is much worse, as by the several Quotations faithfully given by me out of his Book, doth plainly appear.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>IN my Re-view of Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> Book, among his many unfair and unjust Insinuations against me; as well as positive Abuses, I find in pag. 41. he very unjustly sospects me, whether I hold <HI>That God in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nseth Grace into the faithful, whereby he hath a Principle of gracious Operation given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in, which whether or no</HI> (saith he) <HI>my Antagonist will acknowledge, is to be suspected.</HI> But to case him of his Suspicion, I tell him, I do cordially believe, as well as acknow∣ledge, which at its first infusion is as a grain of Mustard-seed, but afterwards, by the blessing of God, and the operation of his holy Spirit, in the diligent use of the Means of Gods appoint∣ment, by them who have it given them, it grows up, by degrees, to be a Tree of the greatest of all Herbs.</P>
<P>Again, I find in pag. 48. he saith, <Q><HI>Adams</HI> Fall, before it came to pass, was future, how else should God know it to be so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And if he did not know it, how was it that he laid in a Remedy against the fatal Consequents of it, in some, before it was in act.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That <HI>Adams</HI> Fall, before it came to pass, was certainly future, and that God most certainly and infallibly had a fore∣knowledge of it, and therefore by his eternal Counsel and Purpose laid in a Remedy against the fatal Consequents of it, is granted, but that from thence it doth follow, that God did Necessitate <HI>Adam,</HI> or any man fince, to commit any sinful Action, or that God had decreed the futurity either of <HI>Adams</HI> sin, or did, in time, determine their Wills necessarily to sinful Actions, doth no ways follow. Therefore Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> might have spared his Consequence that he draws upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upposal, That God did
<PB N="37" REF="001160_0040_0FB091B9D88ED5B0"/>not know the Futurity of <HI>Adam.</HI> sin, <HI>viz. That</HI> (upon that Sup∣posal) <HI>if</HI> Adam <HI>had pleased he might have defeated the whole Com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Man's Redemption:</HI> I gave him not the least ground to make any such Supposal, That God did not certainly and infallibly fore-kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Alan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> would sin; therefore here, as oft else-where, (as the Proverb is) Mr. <HI>Willard makes to himself a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Straw,</HI> and then fights against it, and so unprofitably wastes both Time and Paper, and puts me to this Labour, which is not altogether in vain to me, were it but to detect his impertinency, and his unschollar-like way of arguing against what his Opponent doth not deny, but affirm as well as he No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doth it follow what certainly is future, is necessarily future by any Antecedent Necessity to its futurition; for Certainty is one thing, and Neces∣sity is another.</P>
<P>But let Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> answer me a Question or two, 1. Could not God, if he had pleased, decreed to have preserved <HI>Adam</HI> from falling? for I hope he will not say, that God did necessarily decree him to fall, although it is conustent enough with his Principle, That freedom o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Will, and Necessity, to act both im∣manently and transiently, do well agree together; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that God did necessarily decree <HI>Adam</HI> to fall, yet by Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Principle, he did voluntarily and freely decree it, or to use his phrase in another case, he did decree it <HI>Lubenter,</HI> or <HI>cum Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, i. e.</HI> with a Lubency of Will.</P>
<P N="2">2. If God had pleased by his Decree, to preserve Man from falling, Man would certainly have stood, and not have fallen, and Man had stood, willingly, without any constraint or com∣pulsion of his Will; but doth it therefore follow, that either God having decreed to keep Man from falling, or <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an</HI> being made willing, and well pleased to stand, would have deceated the whole Contrivance of Man's Redemption? How could th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be defeated, which, on the Supposition of God's having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Adam</HI> to stand, and not to fall, would never have been d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>; nor would there have been any need o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any such Decree, if <HI>Adam</HI> had stood; for the whole needs not the Physitian, and it <HI>Adam</HI> had stood, he had needed no Physitian n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>? But yet upon the certain Futurity of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tain and infal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose Fore-knowledge of it, it pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="38" REF="001160_0041_0FB091BAA4DE4350"/>eternal Council and Purpose to provide a Saviour and Redeemer for him and his lost Posterity; and seeing God has, according to the Riches of his Grace, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>posed the contrivance of mane Redemption, it could not have been de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ated.</P>
<P>And thus, I hope, I have sufficiently shewed, both the Futu∣rity of Mens sinful Actions, and Gods certain and infallible Fore∣knowledge or them, in another Glass than that of Gods Decree absolutely determining the Necessity of them, without either establishing a <HI>Stoical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate,</HI> or the Jesuits <HI>Scientia Media,</HI> one of which he would by Consequence inter on me, but without all ground. And as to <HI>Stoical Necessity,</HI> or what is equally absurd, I think I have above proved Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Notion of <HI>Free-Will</HI> is sufficiently consistent with it.</P>
<P>But that God hath Not necessitated or determined men ne∣cessarily to commit such sinful Actions, or decreed them to commit them by any secret Will or Decree, which had he done, would be contrary to his revealed Will he hath spoke by his holy Prophets, and commanded in the holy Scriptures, appears very evidently from many places of Scripture, particularly <HI>Jer.</HI> 19.5. <HI>They have built also the high Places of</HI> Baal, <HI>to burn their Sons with fire, for burnt Offerings unto</HI> Baal, <HI>which I commanded not</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>nor sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke it</HI> [consequently not according to his revealed Will] <HI>neither came it unto my Mind</HI> [consequently nor did he decree, purpose or will it, that they should be necessitated to any such wicked Action] see the Parallel places, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.31. and Chap. 32. v. 35. in the Old Testament, and in the New Testa∣ment, <HI>James</HI> 1.13, 14 <HI>Let no man say when he is Tempted, I am Tempted of God, for God cannot be Tempted with Evil, neither Temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e my man; but every man is Tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lust, and enticed.</HI> By the words <HI>[Tempted of God]</HI> I think cannot well be understood any moral Swasion or Com∣mand of God, to sin; for such a Supposition I never heard the worst of Hereticks or Blasphemers charged with; but a sort of People there were in <HI>England</HI> about forty years ago, called, <HI>Ranters,</HI> some Reliques whereof are yet extent, who (like some <HI>Gnesticks</HI> in St. <HI>James</HI>'s time) did hold, That God did inwardly

<P>BEcause Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> doth positively assert in his Book, That most of our <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> are of his Opinion, the Church of <HI>England</HI> not excepted, for which he has, as y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, produced no Authority but that of his own Devising, I intend here in the close to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e some few Passages out of a learned Author, as well as pious, a true Member and Son of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to wit, Bishop <HI>Bramhall,</HI> who was Bishop of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don-Derry</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who maintains the contrary Perswas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, in his Book, called, <HI>A Defence of true Liberty, from Ante∣redent and Extrinsical Necessity,</HI> in answer to a Book of Mr. <HI>Thomas Hobbs</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> entituled, <HI>A Treatase of Li∣berty and Necessity,</HI> wherein the said Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> doth as much agree with Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> as one Egg can be like another, and I suppose Bishop <HI>Bramhall</HI> knew the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as of other Protestant Churches, as
<PB N="40" REF="001160_0043_0FB091BDF7BCCC80"/>well, and much better than Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> doth. He writes thus in his Book against Mr. <HI>Hobbs, viz.</HI></P>
<P>Pag. 60. <Q>He (to wit, Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbs</HI>) makes <HI>Adam</HI> to have had no Liberty from Necessity before his fall, yea, he pro∣ceeds so far, as to affirm.

<P><Q>I confess (saith Bishop <HI>Bramhall</HI>) I hate this Do∣ctrine from my heart, and I believe both I have Rea∣son so to do, and all others who shall seriously ponder the Horrible Consequences which flow from it.

It makes the first Cause to be the Introducer of all Evil and Sin into the World, as much as Man, yea, more than Man, by as much as the Motion of the Watch is more from the Artificer, who did make it, and wind it up, than either from the Spring, or the Wheels, or the Threed, if God by his <HI>Special Influences</HI> into the second Causes, did Necessitate them to operate, as they did.
