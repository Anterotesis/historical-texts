<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. 1.</HEAD>
<P>THE first ten pages of the following FRAGMENTS will, probably, be thought the most interesting part of this little work. They exhibit a rude and imperfect sketch of the <HI>Natural History-Picture</HI> in the neighbourhood of Phi∣ladelphia: a picture which, if it were drawn by an able hand, could not fail to prove interesting to the lovers of science, in every part of the world. Each of these pages is divided into five columns. The first respects the day of the month when the birds mentioned in the second column arrived, or were <HI>first seen,</HI> in the vicinity of Philadel∣phia. In the second column, I have given what may be called the scientific Latin name of each bird. In this part of my subject, I have always preferred the name of Linnaeus, when I could discover that the bird had been described by this great naturalist. But several of the birds, which are here mentioned, were not known to Linnaeus: at least, I do not find that they have a place in any of the editions of his immortal work, the <HI>Systema Naturae.</HI> I have, therefore, been obliged to adopt other names, and, in a few instances, to impose them myself. I have often adopted the names of Professor Gmelin, the laborious, and often successful, editor of the new edition of the <HI>Systema Naturae.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed at Leipsie, in 1788.</NOTE> When this is the case, I have affixed to the scientific name, the letter G, thus (G.) I have in this co∣lumn, sometimes made use of the scientific names of my ingenious and good friend, Mr. William Bartram, a gentleman who has contributed much to our knowledge of the natural productions of North-America. To the names which I myself have imposed, I have affixed the word (mihi.) But I by no means pretend to assert, that all the birds thus marked are new, or have not been described by naturalists.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. II.</HEAD>
<P>In the third column, I have given the English scientific and the English provincial names. The former are chiefly taken from the <HI>Arctic Zoology</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The second edition. London: 1792.</NOTE> of my excellent friend Mr. Pennant, because this is a work of such extensive merit, that I presume it is in the hands of almost every naturalist; and because the names imposed by this gentleman are, with a very few exceptions, just and significant. By the English provincial names, I mean the names by which these birds are best known in Pennsylvania, and in various other parts of the United-States. These provincial names are always enclosed within a parenthesis, as in the instances (Pewe), (Turtle-Dove), &amp;c. They are designated in the same manner in the list of Resident Birds, &amp;c. in Section III. The greater number of these names are used in Pennsylvania.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. III.</HEAD>
<P>The fourth column relates to the "Progress Vegetation." The greater number of the vegetables which I have here enumerated are natives of Pennsylvania. Some, which are not natives of this state, are natives of other parts of the United-States; whilst others have not, hitherto, been found to grow spontaneously in any part of America. In general, the plants are designated by their Linnaean names. In a few instances, I have adopted the names of the late Mr. Aiton, in his <HI>Hortus Kewensis;</HI> those of Marshall, and other botanists. All the plants which I have men∣tioned are found, either wild, or growing in gardens, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, where the remarks on the time of their flowering and leasing have been made.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. IV.</HEAD>
<P>The fifth and last column contains "Miscellaneous Observations." In this part of my Sketches, I have done but very little. Want of time has prevented me from throwing into this column, many interesting facts, some of which will be presented, perhaps to greater advantage, to the public, in my future publications. The few Ther∣mometrical
<PB N="vi" REF="035159_0005_10012A6899289CE0"/>and Barometrical observations, which occur under this head, are given on the authority of my ever∣venerated maternal uncle, the late David Rittenhouse, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> These observations were made in Philadelphia.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. V.</HEAD>
<P>It must not be imagined, that I communicate these sketches to the public as exhibiting even the names of <HI>all</HI> the migratory birds of Pennsylvania. I am persuaded, that <HI>many</HI> of these birds have escaped my notice. This is, per∣haps, especially the case with the birds of the genera Anas, Tringa, and of the extensive order of Passeres, &amp;c. which I suspect are constant in their migrations from the north to the south, and from the south to the north. A good many of the birds which are mentioned by Mr. Pennant as natives of New-York have not hitherto, to my knowledge, been observed in Pennsylvania: but it can hardly be supposed that those species which are <HI>common</HI> in New-York (if we except such as delight in the vicinity of the sea-coast) are <HI>uncommon,</HI> or never seen, in Pennsyl∣vania. Here, however, I must observe, that I cannot but suspect, that Mr. Pennant, Mr. Latham, and other able ornithologists, have sometimes described as distinct species, birds which merely differ in sex, or in age, and in their colouring, for which these animals, at different seasons of the year, are so remarkable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. VI.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the constant migratory birds, there are others, which may be denominated <HI>occasional</HI> migratory, or visit∣ant, birds of Pennsylvania. Such, not to mention several others, are the Columba passerina, or Ground-Pigeon, the Fringilla bicolor, or Bahama-Finch, and a species of Psittacus, or Parrot.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. VII.</HEAD>
<P>The two first of these birds were seen in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, between thirty and forty years ago. The Psittacus, most probably the Psittacus pertinax, Illinois Parrot, or the Psittacus carolinensis, Carolina Parrot, has been occasionally observed in Shareman's Valley, on Shareman's Creek, a branch of the river Susquehanna, within twenty miles of the town of Carlisle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A friend of mine has informed me, that the Parakeet seen in this valley is the same species which is frequently met with in the neighbourhood of the river Ohio. This Last is supposed to be Psittacus pertina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> This last fact seems to contradict the observation of Mr. William Bartram, who says, "The parakeet (Psittacus carolinensis) never reach so far north as Pennsylvania, which to me is unaccountable, considering they are a bird of such singular rapid flight, they could easily perform the jour∣ney in ten or twelve hours from North-Carolina, where they are very numerous, and we abound with all the fruits which they delight in."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, &amp;c. P. 301. Philadelphia: 1791.</NOTE> It is well known, that the late M. de Buffon had limited the range of the whole of the Parrot-kind to exactly twenty-five degrees on each side of the equator.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. TOM. XI. P. 113 and 114. Duodecimo-edition.

Vol. 1. P. 285.</NOTE> My observation is an additional objection to the hypothesis. I may add, that a very large flight of parakeets, which came from the westward, was seen, a few years ago, about twenty-five miles to the north-west of Albany, in the state of New-York. The arrival of these birds in the depth of winter<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">In January, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE> was, indeed, a very remarkable circumstance. The more ignorant Dutch settlers were exceedingly alarmed. They imagined, in dreadful consternation, that it portended nothing less calamitous than the destruction of the world.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">This fact was communicated to me by Egbert Benson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of the State of New-York.</NOTE></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>I suspect it will be found, that, in general, our southern birds migrate farther north in the tract of country west than in that east of the great ranges of our mountains. With respect to the birds, I hazard this merely as a con∣jecture:
<PB N="vii" REF="035159_0006_10012A6A39FE09F0"/>but it is a conjecture which derives support from many interesting facts which I have collected, and which will be mentioned and explained in my <HI>Geographical View of the Trees and Shrubs of North-America.</HI> In that work, I shall show, that the southern trees and shrubs (that is, those vegetables which attain to their greatest perfection in the southern climates of our continent, particularly of the United-States) are, in general, found much farther north in the western than they are in the eastern parts of our country. This fact seems to show, and the point is put beyond any manner of doubt, by thermometrical observations, that the western climate, in the same lati∣tudes, is more temperate than the eastern. Of course, it were natural to suppose, that the southern birds, to whom heat is so genial, would often be solicited farther north in the western than in the eastern district. This, with respect to some birds, is actually the case. Mr. Jefferson has observed, that "Perroquets even winter on the Sioto, in the 39th degree of latitude."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on the State of Virginia. Page 139. The original edition.</NOTE> I have certain information, that these birds winter still farther north than is here mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. IX.</HEAD>
<P>Birds, in migrating, are fond of following the courses of rivers, and other large streams of water. This circum∣stance, in my opinion, partly explains the reason, why some of the birds of the southern parts of the United-States, and also some of the South-American birds, which have never, or very rarely, been discovered in the Atlantic coun∣tries of North-America, are not uncommon in the countries west of the Alleghaney-Mountains. These southern birds, following the courses of the Mississippi, and its branches (the Ohio, the Illinois, &amp;c.) are spread or dispersed through the rich and extensive territories that are washed by these waters. Whether or not this explanation be admitted, the fact is certainly as I have stated; and to the naturalist it cannot but appear interesting. The Psittacus pertinax is one of the birds of Brasil; and the Muscicapa Tyrannus, which is held in so much esteem by the Nau∣dowessies, and other western Indian tribes, is a native of Surinam, and of the country bordering on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> river Plata.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. X.</HEAD>
<P>It is, I think, in general, a just observation, that our Spring and Summer birds of passage continue with us about six months, and are absent for the same length of time. Accordingly, those birds which arrive early in the spring disappear early in the autumn, and those which arrive late in the spring do not disappear until late in the au∣tumn. Our late springs are commonly succeeded by late and warm autumns, which, by keeping alive the numerous species of insects, which are the favourite food of almost all our summer birds of passage, detain these birds for a considerable time among us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XI.</HEAD>
<P>The greater number of the Spring and Summer birds of passage, which I have mentioned, build and breed in Pennsylvania.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Appendix I. where I have designated with an asterisk (*) those birds which <HI>are known</HI> to breed in Pennsylvania. The greater number of them thus marked breed within a few miles of Philadelphia.</NOTE> Perhaps, they all breed in some part of this extensive state, with the exception of the Vultur Aura (Turkey-Buzzard), and a few others, which do not visit us until towards the close of the summer. It has lately been ascertained, that the Ampelis Garrulus, or Prib-Chatterer (Cedar-Bird) does breed in Pennsylvania; and I doubt not, that the same will, in time, be discovered to be the case with the Emberiza Oryzivora (Rice-Bird, Reed-Bird), and others whose nests have not hitherto been seen in Pennsylvania. It is not unlikely, however, that some of these birds of passage continue their migration farther northward, to New-York, New-England, Vermont, &amp;c. and there breed and raise their young, returning southward, through Pennsylvania, in the fall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XII.</HEAD>
<P>It is an interesting fact, for which we are indebted to Mr. William Bartram, that very few of our birds of passage from the south "build or rear their young in the south or maritime parts of Virginia and Carolina, Georgia and
<PB N="viii" REF="035159_0007_10012A6FD88C1E60"/>Florida."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, &amp;c. Page 287.</NOTE> This circumstance leads to a suspicion, that the principal cause (I will not, out of complaisance to any one, call it a necessary instinct) which leads or impels these birds to migrate to the northward, is that they may make choice of a proper climate, abounding in their favourite food, to perform their amours, to build their nests, and to rear their young. Much light might be thrown upon this curious subject, if natural history were cultivated in the United-States, with a portion of that innocent and useful zeal with which it is cultivated in Europe: with only a small portion of that ardent zeal which so strongly characterizes the Americans in their pursuit of gain. But, as yet, little attention is paid to the study of nature in the United-States. In our colleges, it is not taught as an indispen∣sable branch of polite or useful knowledge, but is obliged to yield its laurels to languages which are withered or dead, and to studies which are useless or ignoble.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I ever have been a friend to the study of the two ancient languages, the Greek and the Latin, which are taught in our schools. They are absolutely necessary to the complete attainment of some sciences, such as natural history (including botany), and medicine; and I think with Erasmus, that a physician should he ashamed not to know them. But too much time is dissipated in the acquisition of these languages. If I do not greatly mistake, this truth begins to be acknowledged among us. <HI>Video mediora.</HI> If only one-sixth part of the time which is consumed in acquiring the Greek and Latin languages (particularly the former), were appropriated to the study of natural history, in less than twenty years, the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral productions of the United-States would be pretty well investigated. But what, in the cultivation of a science so extensive, and so difficult, can be expected from the labours of two or three individuals, unaided by the public, and tra∣melled by professional engagements and pursuits?</NOTE></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>It has been supposed, that many of the birds which I have enumerated, pass, on their return to the south, during the autumnal months, through the countries which are situated to the west of the great ranges of our mountains. That this is sometimes the case, I do not doubt: but it is not the general order of the migration of our birds. My opinion, indeed, is opposed by the authority of some very respectable naturalists, whose sentiments deserve to be mentioned in this place. "The birds (says the late Mr. George Edwards), which pass through the country north∣ward in the spring, being never observed to return the same way, Mr. Bartram supposes that they go to the southward in autumn by some other passage beyond their inland mountains."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gleanings of Natural History, Part II. P. 202.</NOTE> This notion is likewise adopted by Mr. Pennant-Speaking of the Motacilla vermivora, or Worm-eater, this able zoologist says, "It does not appear in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> till <HI>July,</HI> in its passage northward. Does not return the same way; but is supposed to go beyond the mountains which lie to the west. This seems to be the case with all the transient vernal visitants of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI>"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tic Zoology VOL. II. P. 100, 101.</NOTE> In the above quotation, Mr. Edwards says, the birds are "never" observed to return the same way that they went. This is, certainly, a mistake. Our swallows, which are migratory birds, as I think I have rendered very probable in the Appendix,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See Page 16.</NOTE> are generally seen on their return southward, in the autumn, far to the east of the first ranges of our mountains. But independently of the swallows, the same may be said of many other species of birds. Indeed, I believe it may confidently be said, that most of the passenger-birds, which pass by us, in the spring, return, in the autumn, southward, the same way they went. This observation certainly applies to the Anas canadensis (Wild-Goose), the Columba migratoria (Wild-Pigeon), the Fringilla tristis (Yellow-Bird), Motacilla Sialis (Blue-Bird), Loxia Curvirostra (Crossbill), Fringilla — (Hemp-Bird), and at least fifty others, which are <HI>constantly</HI> observed on their migrations southward, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. These autumnal flocks sometimes consist of many thousands of individuals together; and it has been observed, that birds of different species sometimes mi∣grate in the same bodies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>It must not be imagined, that the birds which I have enumerated arrive uniformly, every year, at the times which are prefixed to their names, in the first column. I have long been persuaded, that the uniformity of the ar∣rival of the migratory birds, in any given country, is not so great as many naturalists have imagined. The atten∣tion which I have paid to this curious subject in Pennsylvania, has convinced me, that my suspicion was well founded. The migration of birds is not a "determinate instinct,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Dr. Adam Ferguson.</NOTE> but an act of volition, or will. Hence, the seasons and
<PB N="ix" REF="035159_0008_10012A73E3E98AE0"/>other circumstances will greatly regulate the arrival of birds in, and their flight or removal from, a particular country. Sometimes, there is a difference of three weeks or a month between the arrival, or appearance, of the same species, in two different years. This will appear from the following instances, which are selected from many others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XV.</HEAD>
<P>From an inspection of these Tables, it will appear, that the Alauda alpestris, or Shore-Lark, the Alauda rubra, or Red-Lark, the Fringilla tristis, or Golden Finch, and some others, were not observed, in the vicinity of Phila∣delphia, earlier than the twelfth of March, 1791: whereas the same birds were seen, in the same neighbourhood, as early as the twenty-eighth of February, the following year, on their passage northward.</P>
<P>I have placed the Anas canadensis (Wild-Goose) between the 15th and the 18th of April, 1791, but in the year 1794, these birds were observed, on their migration from the south, as early as the 3d of March. In the first men∣tioned year the Ardea Herodias, or Great Heron, was not observed before the 15th or 16th of April; but in the latter year, numbers of these birds were seen as early as the 1st of April. Many other instances might be mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>How much the movements of birds from one country to another depend upon the state of the seasons, will ap∣pear from different parts of this little work; particularly from the Third Section. Here we find, that during our mild winters, several of those species of birds which, in general, are undoubtedly migratory, continue the winter through in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. Such, which I have denominated the OCCASIONAL, or ACCI∣DENTAL, RESIDENT BIRDS, are the Ardea Herodias, or Great Heron, Columba carolinensis, or Turtle-Dove, the Fringilla melodia, and several others: I doubt not many more than I have mentioned. The Columba migratoria, Passenger-Pigeon, commonly returns from the northward late in the fall, and continues with us a few days, or weeks, feeding in our fields upon the seed of the buckwheat,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polygum F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pyrum.</NOTE> or in the woods upon acorns. But if the season be a very mild one, they continue with us for a much longer time. This was the case in the winter of 1792—1793, when immense flocks of these birds continued about the city, and did not migrate farther southward, until the weather became more severe in the month of January. The winter of 1792—1793, was one of the mildest that had ever been remembered in Pennsylvania. It is a common observation in some parts of this state, that when the Pi∣geons continue with us all the winter, we shall have a sickly summer and autumn. There is, perhaps, some foun∣dation for this notion. Large bodies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I say "large bodies," for I believe individuals of those birds continue with us almost every winter.</NOTE> of these birds seldom do winter among us unless the winter be very mild; and the experience of some years has taught us, that such winters are often followed by malignant epidemics. The mild winter of 1792—1793, was succeeded by a dreadful malignant fever, which destroyed between four and five thousand people in Philadelphia; and I am assured, that the same fever in 1762 was preceded by an extremely open winter, during which the pigeons remained about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the state. In the hands of a poet, a Lucretius, or a Virgil, this coincidence between the accidental hiemation of the pigeons and the appearance of the yellow-fever might be wrought up into a system of beautiful extravagance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>If birds, in their migration from one country to another, were impelled by a "determinate," or necessary instinct, the periods of their arrival and departure would be more uniform and fixed. But we have seen, that there is a considerable difference in these respects, even in two years immediately in succession. Such great regularity in the migrations of these animals by no means accords with those accommodating habits, which the naturalist discovers in his investigation of the manners of all animals; those habits which have been given to them, as to us, by a Cre∣ator
<PB N="x" REF="035159_0009_10012A7A62F94710"/>whose works so loudly proclaim his wisdom, and the extent of his benevolence and attention to the innume∣rable living objects which he has formed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>It is highly probable, that the periods of the migrations of birds will be found to be more or less uniform in pro∣portion as the climates of the countries to which they migrate are more or less variable in their temperature. It is perhaps, upon this principle, that we are to explain the difference of the times of the arrival and departure of the birds of Pennsylvania, and other parts of North-America. The climates of these countries are extremely variable; I suppose more so that most other countries that are known to us. If, as has been supposed by many writers, the hand of man, by clearing and by cultivating the surface of the earth, contributes essentially to the greater uniformity in the temperature of climates, it is reasonable to conjecture, that the time will come, when the periods of the migrations of our birds will be more constant and fixed. For in North-America, especially the United-States, the progress of population, and of clearing and cultivating the earth, is more rapid and immense than in any other portion of the world.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>It would be a very curious subject of inquiry,—What changes have taken place in the periods of the arrival and disappearance of the passenger-birds, in those countries in which observations have long been made by the ancient poets, and by naturalists? Perhaps, an investigation of this question would, in some degree, illustrate the changes which climates are said to have undergone. Thus, the time of the Swallow's coming into Italy, is particularly mentioned both by Columella and by Pliny,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columella says, the Swallow visits Italy about the twentieth or twenty-third of February. The following are his own words: "Decimo Calenda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Martii leo desinit oce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dere, ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> septentrionale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. qui vocantur ornithiae, per dies trigint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> esse solent, tum et hirunda advena." In another place, he says, "Septimo Calendas Marii ventosa temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cas, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndo conspicitur." <HI>De Re Rustica.</HI> Pliny says, this bird appeared on the twenty-second of February "Octavo calendas Martii hirun∣dinis visus."</NOTE> and it may be gathered also from a beautiful passage in the Georgies of Virgil.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orgic. IV. 305—30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Do the periods meationed by these writers correspond with the periods of the arrival of this bird, in the same country, at present? If the climate of Italy, within the last seventeen or eighteen hundred years, has altered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s much as it is, by many ingenious men, thought to have done, it is not likely that the Swallow now visits that country at the same time it did formerly, in the days of Virgil, and the naturalists whom I have mentioned. I am sorry that I cannot, without some trouble, ascertain the question.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XX.</HEAD>
<P>The fourth column of the tables will enable the curious naturalist to form some idea of the temperature of our climate (by showing the time of leasing, flowering, planting, &amp;c. of a considerable number of vegetables, both native and foreign); at the same time, that it will point out, in a number of instances, the coincidence between this progress in vegetation and the arrival and disappearance of the migratory birds. This last has long been deemed an interesting subject by naturalists, though I am inclined to think, that they have often imagined, that this coinci∣dence is greater than it really is.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="section">

<P>I will not deny, that there is a very remarkable conformity between the vegetation of some plants and the arrival of certain birds of passage. This, perhaps, is especially the case in those countries the climates of which are the most regular in their seasons. Linnaeus has observed, that the Wood-Anemone (Anemone nemorosa) blows in Sweden on the arrival of the Common Swallow,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hirundo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a.</NOTE> and that the Marsh-Marygold (Caltha palustris) blows when the

Vol. IV.</NOTE> The amiable Mr. Stillingfleet remarked nearly the same coincidence in England. Dr. Darwin ob∣serves, that the "word Coccux in Greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo, which is supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in Greece."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Botanic Garden. Part II. Canto I. note.</NOTE> Many instances of a similar coincidence might be pointed out between the flowering of our Pennsylvanian vegetables and the arrival of certain birds. Thus it is observed, that the Wood-Cock (Scolopax Gallinago) commonly visits us when the American Elm (Ulmus americana) is in full blossom: that is between the 8th and 18th of March.</P>

<P>It is well known, that the ancients were of opinion, that the arrival of certain birds of passage afforded one of the best and safest directions for the planting of different kinds of vegetables, and for other agricultural purposes. Thus Virgil, who was at once a naturalist and poet, tells us, that the best time for planting vineyards (in Italy) is when the White bird, or Storck, appears:
<Q><L>Optima vinetis satio, cum vere rubenti</L>
<L>Candida venit avis longis invisa colubrit.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Georgic. Lib. II. 319—320.</HI></BIBL></Q>
I could point out, in the happy compositions of this great poet, other instances of a similar kind. The following is too beautiful to be omitted. The poet of Mantua is here describing the method and the time for killing a steer for the purpose of obtaining from its putrid gore a stock of bees, as was practised by the ancient Egyptians.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It appears to have been a very general opinion among the ancients, that Bees were produced from the putrid bodies of animals. A very curious passage in the 14th chapter of the book of Judges shows the high antiquity of this notion. After Sampson had killed the young Lion, "he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and behold there was a swarm of Bees and honey in the carcase of the lion." The Greeks believed, that these insects arose from putrid bullocks, and hence they gave them a name expressive of this supposed origin. According to Archelaus, bees proceed from bullocks, and wasps from horses. So rude were the opinions of the ancients respecting the origin of these insects. It is certain, however, that putrid carcases are often visited by bees, and it is not unlikely that from these carcases, they may be able to procure honey. It was, doubtless, from observing, that swarms of bees frequent the dead bodies of animals, that the ancient Egyptians had re∣course to such bodies for the purpose of repairing the total loss of their honey-making insects. The manner of doing this is beautifully related by Virgil, who traces back the practice to its first source. <HI>See Georgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Lib. IV. beginning at line</HI> 281.</NOTE> He tells us this must be done early in the spring, before the meadows are painted with the colours of flowers, and be∣fore the Swallow builds its nest upon the rafters.</P>

<P>Although in Pennsylvania, and many other parts of the United-States, the arrival of our birds does not appear to be as uniform as it is in many of the countries of the old world; <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Page 10.</NOTE> the arrival of several species is, nevertheless, so regular, that it may be considered as the signal for commencing certain agricultural operations. Thus, the Muscicapa fusca, which we call Pewe, is one of the earliest Spring birds of passage, visiting the neighbourhood of Philadel∣phia about the middle of March. We have seldom hard frosts after the arrival of this bird, which seems to give a pretty confident assurance to the farmer, that he may very soon begin to open the ground and plant. It is an old ob∣servation in Pennsylvania, that when the Whip-poor-will (Caprimulgus virginianus) arrives, it is time to go bare∣footed; that is, the spring season is pretty far advanced, and sufficiently warm to admit of laying aside the use of shoes, without much inconvenience. This adage originated in the days of greater simplicity than the present. Some of our Indians believe, that this bird is a messenger sent to call their attention to the planting of the ground. Accordingly upon the arrival of the Whip-poor-will, they say to one another, "the <HI>Weecolis</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This is the Delaware. Indian name for this bird.</NOTE> is come: it is planting
<PB N="xii" REF="035159_0011_10010806E170A758"/>time;" and while the bird is uttering the sound of whip-poor-will, or weecolis, they will repeat the word <HI>"Hacki∣beek,"</HI> which is "plant the ground."</P>

<P>I am of opinion, that all the birds which are mentioned in the tables, with the exception of the Alauda magna (Meadow-Lark), Tetrao virginianus (Partridge), and a very few others, are migratory birds, or birds of passage. But I do not expect that this opinion will be universally received by naturalists. In almost every country in which natu∣ral history has been cultivated, the places of retreat of birds at the times of their disappearance has been a matter of dispute. The question concerning the Swallows is not yet settled; and in this country the notion which I deem an erroneous one with respect to these birds is gaining ground.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix I.

<P>Some ingenious gentlemen, with whom I have conversed on the subject, are even of opinion, that but a very few of our birds are, strictly speaking, birds of passage. They imagine, that some of these birds, at the coming on of cold weather, pass into a torpid state, whilst others merely take shelter from the inclemency of the wea∣ther, in close thickets, in the hollows of trees, rocks, &amp;c. without becoming torpid. This opinion may be sup∣ported by plausible arguments. Some species of Swallows have occasionally been found in a torpid state. In mild winters, several of those birds which are thought to be commonly migratory, are seen among us; and even after the disappearance of some species, such as the Motacilla Sialis, or Blue-Bird, one or two warm days in the winter time will bring them back again. This notion is likewise favoured by the torpid state into which so many of our ani∣mals pass, and continue, during the winter season; such as different species of Lizards, Tortoises, Frogs, Serpents, and Insects. Nor is it merely the animals with cold blood <HI>(Sanguis frigidus)</HI> that become torpid. Some of our quadrupeds fall into a similar state. Such are the Arctomys Monax, or Maryland Marmot (best known in the United-States by the names of Ground-Hog, and Wood-chuck), and some of the smaller animals of the order <HI>Glires,</HI> par∣ticularly some species of Dipus, or Jerboa. Other species, again, that do not become torpid, keep themselves con∣fined in close quarters, during the greater part of the winter-season. Such are some of the species of Squirrel, the Didelphis Opossum (Opossum), and others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>These various facts, it must be confessed, seem to give some degree of plausibility to the notion, that our birds <HI>hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mate,</HI> ‡ or take up their winter-quarters among us, and that they do not migrate to a distance. Still, however, I cannot but adopt the latter notion. The complete disclosure of the fact, that the serpents, frogs, some quadrupeds, &amp;c. become torpid, is rather an argument against the torpid state of our birds. Why should it be so much more difficult to discover the <HI>latter</HI> than the former in a torpid state, if <HI>they</HI> actually went into this state? Ten thousand serpents may be found in the torpid state as readily as a single Swallow, or Humming. Bird.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Appendix P. 18.</NOTE> It is recorded in some part of Mr. Bos∣well's ponderous <HI>Life</HI> of the late Dr. Samuel Johnson, that in a conversation which took place on the subject of the an∣nual disappearance of Woodcocks, in England, the doctor observed, that the discovery of a few of these birds, in the summer time, only proved that the species does, in general, emigrate from the country. <HI>"Exceptia probat regulam,"</HI> said the literary Hercules. I must confess, that to me this seems good sense. In like manner, the discovery of a few Swallows, a few Turkey-Buzzards, a single Humming-Bird, or a few birds of any other species, deemed migratory, in a tor∣pid
<PB N="xiii" REF="035159_0012_10012A84186EE9D0"/>or other state, during the winter-season, seems rather to strengthen, than to weaken, the argument, that these birds are, in general, migratory birds. If all these birds continued among us, <HI>many</HI> of them would be found. The labours of one century, or more, in cutting down the timber of the forest, in blowing rocks, in draining mill∣ponds, and marshes, would furnish more than five or six instances (and they not always quite so well authenti∣cated as we could wish) of Swallows, &amp;c. being found during the winter-season, in a benumbed state.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The argument derived from the torpid state into which so many of our animals are observed to fall upon the ap∣proach of winter, is of less weight than may, at first sight, be imagined. These animals are much less capable of migrating than the birds. If they were capable of making long journies to more favourable climates, I do not doubt they would make them. For I am persuaded, by a variety of experiments and observations which I have made, and may, perhaps, be induced to communicate to the public at some future period, that most of our hybernating ani∣mals go with reluctance into this state. I am even of opinion, that the state of torpidity of <HI>many</HI> animals is a state of pain and sufferance. This observation, at least, seems to hold good with respect to those animals (and I believe they constitute the greater number of the hybernating animals) which divide the winter between sleeping and wak∣ing: which, in other words, under the influence of cold and other causes, fall into a kind of profound sleep, during which the functions of the heart and the lungs are constantly performed; and even that of the stomach and intes∣tines, in some measure, goes on: and during all which time, such animals are sensible to the influence of mecha∣nical and other stimuli. This class of hybernating quadrupeds often, during the course of the winter, spontaneously awake from their slumber, take food, and fall into slumber, again. I do not, however, imagine, that animals, which are so torpid as to be incapable of being roused by the application of the most powerful stimuli, can be said to be in a state of pain and sufferance. But I believe, that the number of these <HI>continual</HI> sleepers is very small, even in the coldest climates.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>We are certain, that the torpid state of many animals is altogether an accidental circumstance: that is, it is not necessary to the species. I will not assert, with my learned and ingenious friend, Mr. Fabricius, that it is not natural to, nor coeval with, the species. It would be difficult to prove this position: but the position which I have advanced may be maintained. Animals of the same species have often a very extensive range over the world. Thus, the Ursus Lotor, or Raccoon, extends from Lake-Superior to the West-India-Islands, and the warm parts of South-America. The Opossum has a range not much less extensive. I trace the Rattle-Snake (Crotalus horridus) as far north as the Bay of Saguena, on Lake-Huron, and it is known in the country of Brasil. In such extensive tracts of country, these animals are exposed to very different degrees of temperature: on the one hand, to a great alternation of heat and cold; on the other hand, to a perpetual spring and summer. We ought not, therefore, to expect to find any of them torpid in the whole of this extensive range. In fact, several of those animals which become torpid in the northern parts of our country do not fall into this state in the southern and warmer climates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my account of the Dipus Americanus, or American Jerbos, in the 4th volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.</NOTE> As cold, however, is not the only cause of the torpidity of animals, we must not be surprized to find instances of animals becom∣ing torpid in climates that are warm. Extreme heat, like extreme cold, seems to predispose the animal system to this state, particularly, perhaps, when there is a deficiency of food.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>We see that quadrupeds and some other animals do occasionally, during severe winters, migrate to more southern climates. I am assured, that the Bears migrate, in great numbers, every autumn, across the Mississippi, going south (perhaps to the mountains of New-Mexico), in search of a milder climate. In the spring, they return again by
<PB N="xiv" REF="035159_0013_1001080D0257CEC8"/>same rout. This migration of the bears is particularly observed at Manchac, on the Mississippi, about the latitude of —. Many other quadrupeds perform similar migrations, both in the old and in the new world.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXX.</HEAD>
<P>Nothing seems more improbable than that a class of animals, such as the greater number of birds, which are ca∣pable of rapid and immense flights, should continue in a country in which the winter's cold is generally very intense, and in which, at the same time, the principal articles of their food are not to be procured. But I am far from deny∣ing, that some birds do pass their winters with us, either in a torpid state, or otherwise. Some species continue with us pretty regularly: and individuals of many species do occasionally continue with us. I have already observed, that "during our mild winters, several of those species of birds which, in general, are undoubtedly migratory, continue the winter through in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page ix. § XVI.</NOTE> It must be evident, therefore, that extreme cold is the great cause which compels these animals to retire south. But it is not the only cause. A deficiency of their proper food is another, not much less extensive. The greater number of our birds of the order of passeres feed upon insects, and the seeds and berries of vegetables. These, particularly the former, are not to be procured in the winter-season, in quantity sufficient to answer the demands of the immense number of birds which visit us at other seasons of the year. If our climate were more moderate than it is, and if an abundance of food were at all times to be procured, the number of our Resident Birds would, doubtless, be much greater than it is. It is evident, that a failure of their food is one of the great causes of the migrations of birds. Thus no sooner has the Zizania aquatica (Reed), which is one of the principal foods of the Rice-Birds, shed its seed, than these birds disap∣pear, returning southwards.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Tables. Page 8.</NOTE></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="31" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>Independent on the mildness of the season, and the continuance of an abundance of their favourite kinds of food, individuals (and in some instances large flocks) of many different kinds of migratory birds pass their winters with us. Dr. Darwin observes, that "those swallows that have been hatched too late in the year to acquire their full strength of pinion, or that have been maimed by accident or disease, have been frequently found in the hollows of rocks on the sea coasts, and even under water in" a "torpid state, from which they have been revived by the warmth of a fire."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zoonomia, VOL. I Sect. XVI.</NOTE> I suppose the learned doctor has not completely ascertained the fact, that such swallows were actually hatched later than others, or that they had been maimed by accident or disease. But it is highly probable, that the circumstances which he mentions are some of the cause which compel these and many other kinds of birds to pass their winters in climates, and in situations, very different from those in which the species at large, are, at such times, found.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Birds, in migrating, often lose themselves, particularly, perhaps, when they get into the currents of strong winds, to which they must sometimes be obedient. The large flight of Parakeets,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Page vi. §. VII.</NOTE> which visited the neighbourhood of Al∣bany, in the winter of 1780, was no doubt carried thither by a strong westerly wind. Such wanderers, it is pro∣bable, often go into a torpid state. It is said, that great numbers of Parakeets (I suppose the Psittacus carolinensis) are sometimes, in the winter-season, found torpid in the hollows of trees, in North-Carolina. Admitting the fact, is it not likely, that these birds have been wanderers, like the New-York flock just mentioned? Accidents of this kind are more frequent than is perhaps imagined. And I do not doubt that to such accidents we must ascribe <HI>some</HI> of the instances of swallows and other birds being found, in the winter-season, in a state of hybernation. It will be said, that this idea favours the notion, that birds are capable of entering into this state according to their situation. I do really suppose so. Perhaps all birds, all quadrupeds, in short all animals, are capable of this state. Nor are vegetables exempted from it. Those aquatic plants which, at the approach of winter, withdraw themselves to the bottom of the water, and, on the opening of the spring, emerge from their watery bed, may be denominated HYBER∣NATING
<PB N="xv" REF="035159_0014_10012A90A759E5F8"/>VEGETABLES. Perhaps this name might likewise be applied to those vegetables, which are natives of warm, southern countries, but gradually accommodate themselves to the rigorous winters of northern climates. I think, it was the late Mr. John Hunter who first ventured to conjecture, that man himself is not incapable of be∣coming torpid. Professor Fabricius is of the same opinion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am sorry, that I have not now an opportunity of examining Mr. Fabricius's memoir. I speak, from memory, of his opinions: but I hope I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Nor is it at all improbable.

<P>It it important for our purpose, in the discussion of the question of the disappearance of birds, that many of those species which are believed to be migratory are annually seen on their passage; in the spring from the south to the north, and in the autumn from the north to the south. Some of these passengers migrate in immense flocks, whilst others go and return more individually. Mr. Bartram has seen, in the autumn, large flocks of all our four species of Swallows, on their return southward from Pennsylvania, through Carolina, Florida, &amp;c. and in the spring on their return to the northward again.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Appendix I. P. 16.</NOTE> The immense migrations of the Passenger-Pigeons are well known to every body in this country. I have already hinted at the great flights of Fringilla tristis, Motacilla Sialis, Loxia Cur∣virostra, Fringilla — (Hemp-Bird), and Anas canadensis, which are annually observed on their passage to the south.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Page viii. §. XIII.</NOTE> I might mention a number of other species which move in similar bodies. I shall content myself with men∣tioning one. This is the Brown Crane of Pennant. This species is found in Mexico.

It is curious, however, that in their return, they do not move in the same form in which they came. They now form two or three circles intersecting each other, often changing the figure of the body, and forming again, as they are joined by other squadrons.

<P>I fear, I shall be thought to have taken up too much time in endeavouring to prove, that the greater number of our birds which disappear on the approach of winter, retire to southern and milder climates. Indeed, I am of opinion, that the migration of our birds is a fact so well established in the natural history of these animals, that it will not, in general, be doubted, except by those persons who are propense to doubt on every subject. In Asia, in Africa, and in Europe, where observations on this subject have long been made, the migration of many species has been com∣pletely established. In our own times, it has been particularly observed that many species visit different countries of Europe in the spring, and leave them in the autumn, in the same manner as other species visit and leave us at the same seasons of the year.</P>

<P>But it is said, we are unable to determine to what particular country these American birds of passage emigrate. This, which respect to many species, is strictly true. The observation, however, does not apply to all the migratory birds which I have mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="36" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>It is pretty certain, that some of our migratory birds do not remove to a very great distance. Of this number are those species which even in the depth of winter make their appearance among us when we have a few days of warm and open weather. The Blue-Bird is one of these birds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Section III. Page 12.</NOTE> It is probable that it does not often re∣move far. Perhaps, it goes to the sea-coast, where the temperature is more equable. Perhaps, however, these birds might, with more propriety, be considered as Residents. They, certainly, sometimes continue with us the whole winter. They may easily find a secure retreat from the winter's cold in the neighbourhood of the sea, and in close thickets of wood. Possibly, those species which are seen among us in mild winters, do not commonly re∣tire as far south as the others. But this is only conjecture. We are certain that the Turdus Polyglottos, the Ardea Herodias, and several others, which <HI>occasionally</HI> winter in Pennsylvania, do not <HI>always</HI> winter in the southern states.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The greater number of our migratory birds seem to remove to a very considerable distance from us. It is proba∣ble, that they pass their winters in the Carolinas, Georgia, the Floridas, Mexico, Surinam, Brasil, and all the warm parts of South-America, and the West-India-Islands. That, in general, they remove farther south than the south∣ern parts of the United-States may safely be inferred from the very small number of our birds that is known to hiemate in this part of the country. Thus, the Swallows are no more observed to winter in the southern states than they are in Pennsylvania. And my friend Mr. Bartram assures me, that he does not know more than three of the Spring Birds of Passage that regularly winter in that part of the Union. These are the Muscicapa carolinensis (Cat-Bird), Columba carolinensis (Turtle-Dove), and the Turdus minor, or Little Thrush. They winter as far north as Cape-Fear, in North-Carolina. I do not suppose, however, that this is the whole list of the passenger-birds of Pennsylvania that continue the winter through in the southern states. Some have, probably, escaped Mr. Bartram's observation. At any rate, it will not be doubted, that during very mild winters many species con∣tinue in these states, since, during such winters, several species remain in Pennsylvania. I am assured, that the Rice-Birds often pass the whole winter in South-Carolina; and some gentlemen, with whom I have conversed on the subject, are even of opinion, that the species regularly hiemate in that state. This, however, I presume is a mis∣take. Mr. Catesby says the Mocking Bird hiemates in Carolina. That it does so occasionally, there can be little doubt: but it is pretty certain, that, in general, it is a migratory bird.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. VOL. II. page 16. It is a curious fact, that previous to the cold winter of 1779—1780, or 1783—1784 (I am not positive which), the Mocking-Bird more commonly remained in the vicinity of Philadelphia and other parts of Pennsylvania, during the winter-season, than it has done since that time. I am inclined to think, that the extreme severity of the season I allude to has frightened these birds away. I am sensible, however, that this mode of explaining the fact will not appear satisfactory to those naturalists who believe, that the instinct of animals is a <HI>vis impellent,</HI> a "determinate" something; and that they never acquire any knowledge by experience. Very different is my opinion, as I shall fully show in a work on the Instinct of animals, in which I have been, for some time, engaged.</NOTE> I suspect that, besides the three species men∣tioned by Mr. Bartram, the following birds pretty regularly hiemate in some of the southern states, particularly South-Carolina, and Georgia, and in the country of Florida: Oriolus phoeniceus, Gracula Quiscula, Picus auratus, Picus erythrocephalus, Fringilla pecoris, Alauda alpestris, Charadrius vociferus, Rallus virginianus, Scolopax Gal∣linago, and a good many of the <HI>Anseres.</HI></P>

I shall here mention a few of these birds; viz. the Vultur Aura, Psittacus pertinax, Oriolus phoeniceus, Oriolus Baltimore? Gracula Quiscula, Gracula Barita, Picus principalis, Picus carolinus, or Carolina Woodpecker, Alcedo Alcyon?

I have annexed the mark of doubt to a few which, perhaps, are not entirely the same species in the United-States and in Southern America. Those which are designated with an asterisk are not known in Pennsylvania. Mr. Pennant (<HI>Arctic Zoology.</HI> VOL. II. P. 107.) mentions the Motacilla Guira as a native of New-York.—The Emberiza Ciris has never (that I can learn) been seen farther north than Cape-Fear in North-Carolina, and not more than one mile from the salt water. The Spoon-Bill is sometimes (though rarely) seen about the mouth of Cape-Fear-River. They are common about St. Agustine, in East-Florida, and even as far north as the Savanna-River. Mr. William Bartram.</NOTE> This circumstance renders it very probable, that many of our migratory birds pass their winters in these southern climates. How much is it to be wished, that some intelligent naturalists would furnish us with a list of the migratory birds of Mexico, Brasil, the West-India-Islands, &amp;c. noting down, with care, the times of their disappearance from those countries, and the periods of their return to them. This would throw great light upon the difficult question which I am examining. Mean∣while, I have little doubt it will be found, that several of these birds visit us about the time they leave the warm countries just mentioned. Some of the birds which I have mentioned, in the above list, are known to migrate from and to Mexico, Brasil, and the West-Indies.</P>

<HEAD>§. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>My learned and candid friend Mr. Pennant (whose name I never mention but with pleasure and with gratitude; whose works have contributed much to my information, and whose example has stimulated me to the study of na∣tural history) thinks there is the "greatest probability," that numbers of the birds of Kamtschatka are common to North-America, "and that they pass there the seasons of migration."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. VOL. II. P. 314.</NOTE> I may observe, on the other hand, that it is likely that many of the North-American species pass into Asia and Europe, making between these continents and the new-world regular migrations. I think (for I write from memory) that it is Professor Biseke who has lately shown, that several of the North-American birds annually visit the neighbourhood of Mittau, in Courland. Among others, I particularly recollect that this writer mentions the Loxia Cardinalis, or Cardinal Grosbeak. In the farther investigation of the subject of the migration of birds, we shall discover, that many species (many more than is generally imagined) are common to the old and to the new-world; and that several species are occasionally passing into countries which before they had not visited. I am not afraid, that genuine naturalists will suppose, that the regularity of migration, which I have mentioned, between the two continents, is altogether imaginary. I certainly do not carry my birds as far, in search of food, of resting places, and of better climes, as did Cotton Mather, of New-England, who fancied that the Wild-Pigeons, on leaving us, repaired "to some undiscovered Satellite, accompanying the Earth at a near Distance."<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">See the Philosophical Transactions, Abridg'd, &amp;c.

<P>The following TABLES are divided into two Sections. The first section contains an enumeration of the SPRING and SUMMER Birds of Passage. All these, with the exception of a very few, which may be called RESIDENT BIRDS, come from the south. The greater part of them are known to build and breed in Pennsylvania. At the close of the summer and in the autumn, they retire again to the south, and visit us in the Spring.</P>
<P>The second section is devoted to the AUTUMNAL and WINTER Birds of Passage. These passengers may be di∣vided into two classes: viz. I. The Spring and Summer Birds of Passage, which are now on their return to the south. In strict propriety, these ought not to be considered as Autumnal and Winter Passengers: for they leave us in cold weather, either because they are incapable of supporting the severity of the winter-season, or because they cannot, during this season, procure a sufficiency of their proper and favourite food. Perhaps, for both these causes. II. The second class comprehends the real Autumnal and Winter Birds of Passage. These, compared with the Spring and Summer Birds of Passage, are very few in number. They all come from the north, and either winter with us or in the southern states. In the spring (frequently very early in the spring), they retire northerly, where they build, breed, and rear their young.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. OF THE RESIDENT BIRDS OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>By the <HI>RESIDENT BIRDS,</HI> I mean those birds which, in general, continue in Pennsylvania the whole year; which build their nests, rear their young, and are commonly thought to continue, near the district in which they themselves were reared. I shall enumerate these birds in the order of the Linnaean arrangement.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="list of birds">
<HEAD>ACCIPITRES. RAPACIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>Falco Leucocephalus. White-Headed Eagle. (Bald-Eagle.) This, in the opinion of some persons, is the same bird as the next species. But I cannot adopt this notion.</P>
<P>Falco regalis of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Great Grey Eagle. This is our largest Eagle.</P>
<P>Falco aquilinus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Great Red-Tailed Hawk. This is the largest species of Hawk hitherto dis∣covered in Pennsylvania. The tail is of a red brick colour.</P>
<P>Falco columbarius. Pigeon-Hawk.</P>
<P>Falce glaucus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Bluish Hawk. A beautiful species. Colour a pale sky-blue. Tips of the wings black. Feeds upon its prey, as it flies along with it.</P>
<P>Strix virginiana. Great Horned Owl.</P>
<P>Strix Aslo. Red Owl, Little Owl. (Screech-Owl.)</P>
<P>Strix varius of Bartram. MS. Hen Owl. This is a large species without ears. It is next in size to the Strix virginiana, or Great Horned Owl. Of a clay or dirt colour, spotted with darker brown.</P>
<P>Lanius Excubitor. Great Shrike. (Gust Bird? Nine-Killer.) For some interesting information concerning this bird, see <HI>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.</HI> VOL. IV.</P>
<P>Lanius Collurio? Red-Backed Shrike. This species comes to us from the northward, in October or November. In very mild winters, stays in the vicinity of Philadelphia. Is always with us in the spring, on its return to the north. Does not breed with us: does not sing in the autumn, but does in the spring.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="list of birds">
<HEAD>PICAE PIES.</HEAD>
<P>Corvus Corax. Raven Crow. (Raven.) Corvus carnivorus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Larger than the next species.</P>
<P>Corvus Corone. Carrion Crow. (Crow.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is another species of Corvus which differs from both the species here mentioned. It is larger than the Common Crow (Corvus Corone) and makes a noise more like that of the Raven, or Corvus Corax. It keep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the sea-coast. Mr. Bartram <HI>(Travels</HI>) calls this species Corvus maritimus. I have never seen it.</NOTE>) This is the Corvus frugivorus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>Corvus cristatus. Blue-Crow. (Blue-Jay, Jay-Bird.)</P>
<P>Picus pileatus. Pileated Woodpecker. (Wood-Cock).</P>
<P>* Picus erythrocephalus. Red-Headed-Woodpecker. Continues about Philadelphia, in mild winters. In very cold winters, it goes farther southward.</P>
<P>* Picus auratus. Golden-Wing-Woodpecker. Some few of these birds are seen among us, in the warmer or milder winters. In general, they migrate farther southward.</P>
<P>Picus villosus. Hairy Woodpecker. <HI>Se-se-ah</HI> of the Wyandot-Indians.</P>
<P>Picus pubescens. Downy Woodpecker. <HI>Sho-ah</HI> of the Wyandot-Indians.</P>
<P>Sitta. Black-Headed Nuthatch. (Sap-Sucker.)</P>
<P>Certhia fusca of Bartram. MS. Brown-Creeper. I believe this species is not described. The general colour is a nut∣brown: speckled with black or deep dusky: some white spots on the first coverts. Edwards (<HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> vol. I. 26.) has a bird a good deal like this. I mean his Little Brown and White Creeper.</P>

<P>Motacilla Sialis. (Blue-Bird.) Stays with us in mild winters. In general, disappears upon the setting in of the very severe weather. A few days, however, of southerly wind and open warm weather, it is observed, will bring them back to us, even in the depth of winter.</P>
<P>Motacilla Troglodytes? (Marsh-Wren.) Commonly continues with us the whole year; in the winter time, taking shelter in our houses, stables, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Parus bicolor. Toupet Titmouse.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<HEAD>NOTE.</HEAD>
<P>In strict language, there are very few of our birds entitled to the name of RESIDENTS. Pennsylvania, like every other portion of the United-States, is subject to great extremes of heat and cold; and these extremes are known to have a decided insluence upon the dispositions of animals. During our coldest winters, therefore, many of those birds, which I have considered as residents, migrate to the south. This was the case in the ever-memorable winter of 1779 and 1780, when very few of the usually resident birds continued with us: and many of those, which did continue, perished with the severity of the cold.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of birds">
<PB N="13" REF="035159_0030_10012AD66673AC78"/>
<HEAD>OCCASIONAL, OR ACCIDENTAL, RESIDENTS.</HEAD>
<P>There is a propriety in the division of the Resident Birds, into such as commonly continue in the country the whole year through, and such as only occasionally continue. The latter may be called OCCASIONAL, or ACCIDENTAL, RESIDENTS. They seldom continue with us except in open, mild winters. These, in the preceding list, are marked with an asterisk.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have had the less hesitation in blending them together, because it is highly probable, that in a tract of country so extensive and various as the state of Pennsylvania, some of the birds, which about Philadelphia are only occasionally resident, may be more generally so in other parts of the country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of birds">
<HEAD>OCCASIONAL VISITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>Some of the birds which are observed in Pennsylvania may, with propriety, be thrown into a section called OCCA∣SIONAL VISITANTS. Of these I have already made mention in the Introduction to these Fragments. These Occasional Visitants are such birds as occasionally come to Pennsylvania, either from the more northern or from the more southern parts of North-America. With <HI>all</HI> the causes which induce them to visit us, I am not suffici∣ently acquainted to speak on the subject, with confidence. The following, however, are certainly some of these causes, viz. severity of cold, scarcity of food, and intensity of heat.</P>
<P N="1">I. The birds which are driven by the severity of cold all come to us from the northward. These occasional visit∣ants are pretty numerous, during our very severe winters, when some of the birds of Canada and Labrador are seen among us. The two following species of Strix deserve to be mentioned under this head, viz. the Great White Owl (Strix Nyctea?). This species is never seen in the vicinity of Philadelphia, except in those winters which are very severe, long, and close. This and the following species (See the Tables) were seen about Phila∣delphia, at the close of the winter of 1791-92, which was one of our severest winters. The Tawney-Faced Owl (Strix stridula?) is a very beautiful species. It makes its appearance, in the day-time, near houses and barns, watching for mice, or for those weakly birds which have been compelled by the severity of the cold to take shelter there.</P>
<P N="2">II. It may readily be imagined, that a scarcity of food, particularly of their favourite food, is one of the causes which induce birds to make occasional visits to other countries than their own. I am even of opinion, that this has been the original cause of some of those migrations which are now regular and extensive.</P>
<P N="3">III. I have mentioned intensity of heat, or very warm weather, as one of the causes which sometimes impel or induce birds to migrate to us. It is probable, however, that this cause more frequently operates in a secondary manner; that is, by producing a scarcity of food. All the Occasional Visitants that fall under this section come from the southward. See the Introduction, where I have mentioned some of these visitants.</P>

<P N="9">9. Loxia ludoviciana. Red-Breasted Gross-Beak.</P>
<P N="10">10. Fringilla purpurea. Purple Finch. This is one of our birds of passage. Early in the spring, sometimes in February, it comes up from the south, and returns from the north, going southward, in October.</P>
<P N="11">11. Fringilla—. (Hemp-Bird.) This is one of our migratory birds. It is not the Fringilla cannabina of Linnaeus; but, like it, feeds on the ripe hemp-feed. Is often seen about Philadelphia. On the authority of Mr. William Bartram, who thinks it an undescribed species.</P>
<P N="12">12. Hirundo Subis. Canada Swallo,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Latham.</NOTE> Great American Martin.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE> On the authority of Mr. Oppelt, who ob∣served it in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem. Has never been seen about Philadelphia. Yet it is probable, that it is a bird of passage. Perhaps, it passes from the north to the south, and returns to the north, through the country west of the great ranges of our mountains, which is certainly the rout pursued by some of the migra∣to birds that are seldom, or never, seen in the Atlantic parts of the United-States. Perhaps, this is no other than the Tapera of Brasil, the Hirundo Tapera of Gmelin.</P>
<P N="13">13. Caprimulgus curopacus. European Goatsucker. (Night-Hawk). In Maryland, if I mistake not, it is called Bull-Bat. <HI>Pischk?</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.

So that now all the fifteen species of this genus (mentioned by Gmelin) are known to be natives of America; and all, with the exception of the Caprimulgus curopaeus, are, as far as is yet known, exclusively confined to this portion of the world. This is an interesting fact, which does not favour the opinion of those writers who have imagined, that all animals and all vegetables were originally created in the old world, from whence they have been spread over every portion of the earth: an opinion which ought never to have been advanced by philo∣sophers; and which it is not likely will prevail among those naturalists who observe with attention, and deliver their sentiments without reserve or timidity.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See New W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws of the Origin of the Trib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Amrica.

<P>* ORIOLUS phoeniceus. I cannot altogether admit of the propriety of placing this bird among the <HI>Picae,</HI> as Linnaeus and other naturalists have done. The female appears to be an Emberiza, or Fringilla. This bird is the Sturnus predatorius of Mr. William Bartram. See his <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Muscicapa fusca. This is the Muscicapa nunciola of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Alauda rubra. The Alauda migratoria of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Alauda fusca of the same gentleman. The spe∣cific name rubra is an improper one: for the bird has no red feathers.</P>
<P>* Alauda alp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iris. This is the Alauda campestris of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Fringilla domestica (mihi). Motacilla domestica, or Regulus rufus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> In very mild winters, this social domestic little bird continues with us. It is the earliest of our spring singing, birds. Its note is tre∣mulous and agreeable. Catesby has sigured it, VOL. I. P. 35.</P>
<P>* Fringilla ferruginea. I suspect this is the Hedge-Sparrow of Lawson, P. 144. It is the Fringilla rufa of Bar∣tram. <HI>Travels.</HI> Edwards calls it Little Sparrow. Pl. 354. In New-York it is called the Shepherd.</P>
<P>* Fringilla albicollis. Fringilla fusca of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Fringilla melodia. In mild winters, this bird continues in Pennsylvania, associating with the Snow-Birds. Does not appear to be deseribed.</P>
<P>* Passer palustris of Bartram. This appears to be a species of Fringilla. I do not find that it is described.</P>
<P>Fringilla exilis. This a good deal resembles the Motacilla Regulus, or Golden-crested Warbler. Perh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps, they are the same.</P>
<P>* Fringilla tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is. In different parts of the United-States, this bird is known by a variety of names, such as Gold-Finch, Yellow-Bird, Lettuce-Bird, Sallad-Bird, Flax-Seed-Bird.</P>
<P>Sitta canadensis. I have been mistaken in calling this the Sitta canadensis. It is a distinct species: perhaps Le Tor∣chepot de Canada of Brisson. Tom. 3. P. 592, 593, 594. Pl. 29. Fig. 4. Sitta peregrina of Bartram. MS. Sitta varia, ventre rubro of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> I think Mr. Pennant, to whom I sent a drawing and description of it, considered it as a new species.</P>
<P>* Picus auratus. I am informed, that this bird is known, in Maryland, by the name of Dish-Washer. Linnaeu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> says this species does not climb trees; but this is a mistake: and it builds its nest, like the other species, in the holes of trees.</P>
<P>* Gracula Quiscula? Several respectable authors, and among others Mr. Pennant,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. Vol. 1. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>08, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>09.</NOTE> have confounded the bird thus noted in the Tables with the Gracula Quiscula of Linnaeus. But they are certainly distinct species. I do not
<PB N="16" REF="035159_0033_10012AE0291209C0"/>know that the Gracula Quiscula has ever been seen immediately about Philadelphia. It is commonly seen on or near the fea-coast, and not often twenty miles distant from it. It loves the neighbourhood of the sea, and of brackish water. The Gracula which I mention, in the Tables, is very common about Philadelphia, where it associates with the Red-Wing Oriole, or Oriolus phoeniceus, and with Crows (Corvus Corone), committing great depredations on the mays in the fields; and in the Southern States, on the rice that is stacked in the barn yards. Builds on trees, pretty high up, and seems, for this purpose, to give a preference to the evergreens, such as tall Pine-trees, &amp;c. Our Gracula is either the Gracula Barrita, Boat-Tail-Grakle, or very nearly allied to it.</P>
<P>* Fringilla pecoris. This bird certainly belongs to the same genus as the Oriolus phoeniceus, whether that be Emberiza or Fringilla. It follows cows and horses, pulling asunder their excrements, in order to get at the feeds. It alights on their backs, eating flies and other insects from them. In some parts of Pennsylvania, it is best known by the name of Cow-Bird. It is the Sturnus stercorarius of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Motacilla Sialis. This is one of our earliest singing birds. Its note is highly agreeable. It is the <HI>Tschi-boa-pe-ke-lis</HI> of the Delawares. See P. 12. Sect. III.</P>
<P>* Scolopax Gallinago. Scolopax americana rufa of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> It is the <HI>Me-me-u</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Charadrius vociferus. This species is observed to increase in proportion as the country becomes cleared. Is very seldom seen remote from the habitations of man.</P>
<P>* Scolopax minor. Scolopax minor arvensis of Bartram. <HI>Travels. Pi-si-co-lis?</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Hirundo purpurea. <HI>Pons-pau-cloo-moosc,</HI> or "the bird that never rests," of the Mohegan-Indians. I am of opi∣nion, that this and the three other species of Swallow, which I have mentioned, are migratory birds. I am not ignorant, that an opposite opinion is gaining ground among us. See Dr. Belknap's <HI>History of New Hampshire,</HI> Vol. III. p. 174. My friend, Mr. William Bartram, assures me, "that he has seen, in the spring, large flocks of all our Swallows, upon their passage from the south, and in the autumn, on their return southward from Penn∣sylvania, through Carolina, to Florida, where, however, neither of them winter; but continue farther on south∣ward" <HI>MS. penes me.</HI> I cannot but consider the testimony of this gentleman, in matters of this kind, as of high value. Indeed, all my enquiries convince me, that our swallows are migratory birds. I am, however, far from denying, that swallows have <HI>occasionally</HI> been found in the hollows of decayed trees, in different parts of our country, during that very season, when it supposed these birds are in a more southern climate. I will not even deny, that they have been found under the mud of rivers, &amp;c. These, however, must be considered as <HI>extraordinary</HI> instances, which very rarely occur. They only serve to show the accommodating powers of birds, which some∣times continue in a country the whole year through, and in other times migrate from these countries. It is not difficult to account for some of the instances of Swallows being found in trees, &amp;c. In these instances, I presume, the birds have been compelled to take up their habitations here, after their return from the south, having been surprized by very cold weather. The Swallows are, certainly, very impatient of cold.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">My very respectable and learned friend Dr. John Walker, Professor of Natural History in the University of Edinburgh, used to inform his class, that he "Once knew a cold night (in Scotland) to overtake the Martin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (Hirundo urbica), the Swifts (Hirundo Apu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>), and the Swallows (Hirundo rustica), which benumbed them to such a degree, that they seemed dead, but when they were brought into a warm room, they recovered, and after the sun rose, they all took to the wing. Not one of them was destroyed by the cold."</NOTE> No wonder, therefore, that in a climate so variable as that of Pennsylvania, these birds should sometimes retire into trees, &amp;c. to seek shelter. I have observed, that several weeks after the first appearance of the Swallows in the spring, the coming on of a cold day, has occasioned in them great distress. The following fact will strikingly illustrate what I am saying. The beginning of the month of April, 1773, was unusually warm. In the vicinity of Philadelphia, the clover, in some of the fields, was five or six inches high. The Martins (Hirundo purpurea) were seen about the city: at this time, there came on suddenly a very severe spell of cold weather. It destroyed many of these birds, several of which were seen to drop down, benumbed or dead, among the clover.</P>
<P>If any species of our swallows continues with us the whole year, I think it most likely to be the Hirundo—, or Little Bank-Martin. I have been informed, that in several instances, this species has been found in a torpid
<PB N="17" REF="035159_0034_10012AE402EF3C68"/>state, in the holes of banks. I am also told, that above thirty years ago, a number of these birds were found in a Gum-tree (Nyssa sylvatica<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Of Marshall: Nyssa integrisolia of Aiton.</NOTE>), about four miles from the town of Lancaster. This was in the depth of winter. They were all torpid, but some of them, upon the application of heat, recovered.</P>
<P>Of the four species of Pennsylvania swallows, (viz. Hirundo purpurea, the Hirundo rustica? the Hirundo—, and the Hirundo pelasgia) the first, or Purple Martin, is the one which commonly visits us the earliest, viz. at the end of March, or beginning of April. The House-Swallow and the Little Bank-Martin come next, and the Chimney-Bird last of all. This, at least, is the general order of the appearance of the four species.</P>
<P>* Hirundo rustica? This is not the Hirundo rustica of Europe. It wants a name. It may be called Hirundo hor∣reorum, from its so generally frequenting our barns to build its nest. But this name is liable to objections. I do not know any of our <HI>Indian</HI> names for this species. One of <HI>these</HI> (if not too long) would be the best specific name we could give to it.</P>
<P>* Hirundo—. Little Bank-Martin. This is not the Hirundo riparia of Linnaeus. It has, however, very much the manners or habits of that bird. I have never seen the Hirundo riparia in any part of America. Kalm, Pennant, Gmelin, and other writers assert that it is a native of this continent. Dr. Belknap (P. 173) mentions the Hirundo riparia in his list of the birds of New-Hampshire: but I do not doubt that he means our Little Bank-Martin. I know (without any particular allusion to my excellent deceased friend) how the nomenclature of natural history has been conducted in America.</P>
<P>* Falco piscatorius. This is Catesby's and Bartram's name. It is the <HI>Ni-me-nees</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Certhia Pinus.</P>
<P>* Fringilla graminea. This is the Passer campestris of Bartram. MS.</P>
<P>* Motacilla caerulea. Perhaps, this bird is more properly a species of the genus Parus. It forms a very curious nest of the moss which grows upon rocks, trees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>* Ardea Herodias. See Section III. p. 12.</P>
<P>* Alcedo Alcyon. <HI>Tis-ke-man-nis?</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Colymbus septentrionalis. Flocks of these birds frequent our large rivers, diving for fish. Their voice is musical, especially when a southerly wind blows strong. This is the Colymbus musicus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> It is as large as a goose.</P>
<P>* Colymbus migratorius of Bartram. This is near the size of a goose. Colour black. Bill red. Their principal food is eels and other fish. They visit the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, when the frosts are passed. They ge∣nerally fly in companies of two, three, or four together, and but a little above the surface of the water.</P>
<P>* Colymbus Podiceps. This is sometimes called the Water-Witch.</P>
<P>* Anas sponsa. This beautiful species is the <HI>Gi-gi-tschi-mu-is</HI> of the Delaware-Indians. It builds its nest in the holes of trees. Attempts have been made to domesticate it. but hitherto, they have not, I believe, been successful.</P>
<P>* Columba carolinensis. See Section III. P. 12. It is the <HI>Me-med-ba-cke-mo</HI> of the Delaware-Indians.</P>
<P>* Columba migratoria. These birds commonly pass the winter-season in the forests of Carolina, Georgia, and the two Floridas; and pass over the Gulph of Mexico to the Bahama-Islands. Upon their return southward in the autumn, they sometimes stay with us a considerable time, and they have been known, during our mild winters, to continue with us, as I have already observed. See Section III. P. 12. and Introduction. P. ix. § XVI.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035159_0035_1001081C51EDB4D8"/>
* Turdus rufus. Builds its nest of loose sticks, using no cement. In this respect, it agrees with the Turdus Poly∣glottos, or Mocking-Bird, but differs from the Turdus migratorius, or Robin. This last uses a kind of mud or mortar, in making its nest.</P>
<P>* Ardea Nycticorax. The Ardea clamator of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Motacilla Troglodytes? This is the Motacilla palustris, or Regulus minor, of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> In many re∣spects, this little bird agrees with the Motacilla Troglodytes of Linnaeus: the Wren of the English. I am not quite certain, whether they are not both the same species; but, I believe, they are different. Our bird construct, a very curious nest, resembling in shape a bottle, or pitcher. The materials which it makes use of are dry grass, among the living grass of meadows. The Motacilla Troglodytes? of which I am speaking, is a species of Certhia, or Creeper. It certainly belongs to the same genus as the Certhia familiaris mentioned below, and the Certhia floridana, afterwards taken notice of.</P>
<P>* Ardea virescens. Commonly called S—e-Poke.</P>
<P>* Certhia familiaris (mihi). I now suspect, that this is no other than the Certhia familiaris of Linnaeus, the Euro∣pean Creeper of Pennant; Le Grimpereau of Buffon. Mr. Pennant mentions this as an inhabitant of North-America, and tells us, that it is found in Sweden, "and never quits the country."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. VOL. I. P. 334</NOTE> This to the American na∣turalist, is an interesting fact; for the Creeper is with us undoubtedly a bird of passage: a bird of passage, in a much milder climate than that in which it is a continual resident!! But many facts like this will be discovered in the progress of natural science.</P>
<P>* Hirundo pelasgia. This is the Hirundo cerdo of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Caprimulgus virginianus. This is the <HI>We-coo-lis</HI> of the Delaware-Indians. Although it feeds entirely upon insects, its flesh is said to be delicious. I have been informed, that some of these birds have been found in a torpid state, in hollow trees, in Jersey. But I cannot entirely depend upon the fact; and I have little hesitation in saying, that this bird, as well as the Swallows, to which it is allied, is a bird of passage. For some notices concerning the superstitious opinions of our Indians respecting this bird, see my letter to Dr. Priestley, in the <HI>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.</HI> VOL. IV.</P>
<P>* Lanius Tyrannus. This I rather consider as a species of Muscicapa. It may be called Muscicapa rex. It eats both infects and fruit. Is very destructive to bees, and to grapes.</P>
<P>* Oriolus Baltimore. As far as I know, this is the only Pennsylvania bird that builds a pensile or hanging nest. Mr. Pennant is mistaken in saying that the Oriolus phoeniceus, or Red-Wing Oriole, which I have already men∣tioned, builds such a nest. "The Red-Winged Orioles, (says he) build their nests in bushes, and among the reeds, in retired swamps, in form of a hang-nest; leaving it suspended at so judicious a height, and by so wondrous an instinct, that the highest floods never reach to destroy it."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. VOL I. P. 300.</NOTE> Hernandez seems to have known this bird (the Red-Wing) very well. He describes it under the name of "Acolchichi, scu avis rubeorum humerorum." Pag. 14. CAP. IV.</P>
<P>* Muscicapa carolinensis. This is the Lucar lividus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> This bird seems to be nearly allied to that tribe of birds which is called, by Edwards and Brisson, Manakin. Besides insects, it feeds on many sorts of ripe fruit.</P>
<P>* Parus luteus. This is Bartram's name. <HI>Travels.</HI> Catesby has figured and described this bird under the name of Parus Carolinensis luteus, or the Yellow Titmouse. Page 63. Plate 63.</P>
<P>* Muscicapa fusca (Catesby). The Muscicapa cantatrix of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Trochilus Colubris. I have not been able to learn that the Humming-Bird winters in any, not even in the warmest, parts of the United-States. I cannot hesitate to consider it as a bird of passage. A gentleman, how∣ever,
<PB N="19" REF="035159_0036_10012AE68F9BB270"/>(whose name I do not recollect) wrote a little paper to prove, that these birds continue with us all the winter: why? because one of them was one frosty day, in the month of October, found a good deal benumbed in a church, in some part of New-England; I think in Connecticut.</P>
<P>* Turdus Trichas. This bird is most improperly arranged by Linnaeus under his genus of Turdus.</P>
<P>* Picus erythrocephalus. This is the <HI>Me-ma-koch-cus</HI> of the Delaware-Indians. See Section III. P. 11.</P>
<P>* Motacilla aurocapilla. This is very properly considered as a species of Turdus, or Thrush, both by Edwards and by Pennant. It is the Turdus minimus, vertice aurio, of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Tanagra rubra. This and the Summer-Red-Bird of Catesby (VOL. I. P. 56.) both belong to the same genus. Their note and their manners are the same. They both eat the same food, viz. fruit and insects.</P>
<P>* Muscicapa olivacea. I do not think, with Mr. Pennant,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. V. II. P. 79.</NOTE> that this is the same bird as the Whip-Tom-Kelly of the West-Indies. Our bird has no such note; but a great variety of soft, tender, and agreeable notes. It inhabits forests, and does not, like the West-India bird, build a "pendulous nest."</P>
<P>* Muscicapa Ruticilla. Ruticilla americana of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Turdus minor. Turdus melodes of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> This is, perhaps, the most musical of all the birds of the United-States, notwithstanding the assertions of Catesby and other writers to the contrary.</P>
<P>* Muscicapa viridis. This is a bird of very singular form, manners, and language. I am not satisfied as to its ge∣nus. It seems to be allied to the Manakin of Edwards and Brisson.</P>
<P>* Falco sparverius. In the month of March, it builds its nest in hollow trees, and feeds its young with mice, frogs, and small birds.</P>
<P>* Tanagra cyanea. This is sometimes called in Pennsylvania, Indigo-Bird. It is the Linaria cyanea of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Cuculus americanus. Cuculus Carolinensis of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> This bird is better figured by Buffon <HI>(Pl. Enlum.)</HI> than by Catesby.</P>
<P>* Alauda magna. See Section III. P. 12.</P>
<P>* Tringa macularia (G). Tringa maculata of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Motacilla chrysoptera. Parus alis aureis of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>* Motacilla petechia. Mr. Pennant is mistaken in saying that this pretty species does not breed in Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>* Muscicapa rapax of Bartram. I take this to be the Lesser Crested Fly-Catcher of Mr. Pennant: the Muscicapa acadica of Gmelin. It is a very useful little bird, destroying numbers of the common house-fly and other trou∣blesome insects. It continues with us until late in September, when it retires southerly to pass the winter.</P>
<P>* Ardea cinerea.</P>
<P>* Rallus virginianus. This is the bird which is so well known in Pennsylvania by the name of Rail. It is a ques∣tion much disputed among our sportsmen, whether this be a bird of passage, or whether it continues among us. I have no doubt, that it is a bird of passage. It is well known in Carolina and Florida, where it commonly con∣tinues late, devouring the seed of the Zizania, Rice, and other aquatic plants. Whether it hiemates in these countries, or goes still farther to the south, I do not know.</P>
<P>* Ardea parva of Bartram. I cannot find that this species is described. It builds its nest in the grass of meadows. It is the smallest species of the genus that is known to me.</P>
<P>* Alauda Calandra. This is the Calandra pratensis of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> The Calandra floralia of the same gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035159_0037_10012AE8DC549BF8"/>
* Motacilla vermivora. Mr. Pennant is mistaken when he asserts, that this bird "does not appear in Pennsylvania till July, in its passage northward."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arctic Zoology. Vol. II. P. 100.—See Introduction. P. viii.</NOTE></P>
<P>Certhia floridana (mihi). This bird I do not find figured or described. It is mentioned by Mr. Bartram <HI>(Travels),</HI> under the name of Motacilla coroliniana, or Regulus magnus. It is nearly twice the size of the House-Wren, or Certhia familiaris? Like it, its voice is loud and musical. The upper side of the Certhia floridana is of a nut∣brown colour, delicately marked with transverse waved lines, of a darker colour. The throat, breast, and belly are of a yellowish clay colour. A line of the same colour passes, in form of an arch, over each eye. The bill is long, and a little bent downwards. This is a common bird in Carolina and Florida. It only occasionally visits Pennsylvania, viz. in long and warm summers. Is much more common in the Jerseys.</P>
<P>Vultur Aura. This bird rears its young in the southern states, before its arrival among us. I cannot learn, that it ever breeds in Pennsylvania. I have been informed, that these birds have occasionally been found, in the winter∣season, in the hollows of trees, and in the crevices of rocks, in different parts of the United-States, even to the north of Philadelphia. It is the <HI>Wi-nan-go-u</HI> and <HI>A-ma-tschi-pu-is</HI> of the Delawares, <HI>Sot-seh-tah</HI> of the Wyandots, and <HI>Gus-soo</HI> of the Mohegans.</P>
<P>* Ardea alba. Ardea immaculata of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI></P>
<P>Ardea aequinoctialis. Ardea alba minor of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> It is Pennant's Red-Billed Egret.</P>
<P>Emberiza oryzivora. If I do not mistake, this bird in Connecticut is called the Strawberry-bird. On the autho∣rity of Mr. Catesby, it has been believed by the most respectable naturalists (Pennant and others), that the male and female Rice-Birds migrate separately, at different seasons. Thus, it is imagined, that the males make their appearance in the vicinity of Philadelphia in the spring, and the females in the autumn, or the close of summer. Some facts which have come under my notice induce me to suspect, that this is a vulgar error: one of the many mistakes with which natural history is crouded and deformed. But, at present, I can only throw out the suspicion.</P>
<P>* Parus bicolor. This is the Parus cristatus of Bartram. <HI>Travels.</HI> This species feeds both upon insects and upon seeds, picking the kernel out of the husk. In Pennsylvania, it is called Tom-tit.</P>
<P>* Parus virginianus. Parus cedrus of Bartram. This bird feeds upon feeds and berries, particularly upon the re∣sinous berries of the Juniperus virginiana, or Red-Cedar. Commonly comes to us, from the northward, about the time these berries are ripe,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Tables. P. 7.</NOTE> and seems peculiarly fond of harbouring itself among these trees. Generally continues with us as long as the berries and insects (upon which also it feeds) last, and then goes northerly. Sometimes, however, it continues with us all winter.</P>
<P>* Ampelis Garrulus. In some parts of New-England, this species is called Cherry-Bird. Like the Parus virginia∣nus, it is very fond of the ripe berries of the Red-cedar. It is also very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of the ripe fruit of the Diospyros virginiana, or Persimmon. Builds its nest in trees of a moderate size, about the end of May, or the beginning of June.</P>
<P>Fringilla cannabina? I am not quite certain whether this be the Fringilla cannabina of Linnaeus. It is certainly very nearly allied to this species. Large flocks of these birds visit us towards the end of the fall, or the begin∣ning of the winter. They often fly at very great heights in the air: so high that they cannot readily be seen, though their noise is distinctly heard. Either this species or one very nearly allied to it is found as far south as the country of the Cheerake-Indians, who call it <HI>O-na-clo-nei-ta.</HI> If this be the Fringilla cannabina, it has an ex∣tensive range in North-America, for it is found in the northern parts of this continent. It is one of the species which is common to the old and new world. It is not improbable, that it performs regular migrations from the one continent to the other.</P>
<P>* Scolopax Gallinago. I have already mentioned this species,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Appendix I. P 16.</NOTE> and have taken notice of the regularity of its arrival among us.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See Introduction. P. xi.</NOTE> It is, certainly, a bird of passage. This seems to be the same species which is so common in En∣gland,
<PB N="21" REF="035159_0038_100129EF694FD610"/>and in other parts of Europe, and concerning whose disappearance the learned have so much disputed. There are pretty good reasons for believing, that these birds perform regular migrations between Europe and America. It is remarkable, that they are more numerous on the western than on the eastern shore of Britain. They are still more numerous in the west of Ireland than in the west of Scotland. "For one Wood-Cock on the east-coast of Scotland there are twelve in the west, and for one in the west of Scotland there are twelve in Ireland."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reverend Dr Walker, of Edinburgh.</NOTE> Lord Kenmor, about the last of September, sailed from Lisbon to Falmouth, in England, and for ten or twelve days was becalmed on the coast of France. Every day, he saw from ten to twenty Wood-cocks pas∣sing from the west towards the land. These it was imagined, came from the continent of America. But I do not suppose that all our Wood-cocks thus migrate to Europe. It is pretty certain, that these birds when they visit us in the spring come from the south, and in the autumn they return to the south again. How far south they proceed, I am unable to determine. They are known in Florida, where it is not improbable, that many of them pass the winter-season.</P>
<P>Fringilla pinus (mihi). This is one of our spring birds of passage, and I think is not described. It commonly continues with us until the middle or the end of April, at which time the Apple and the Pear trees are in bloom. These blos∣soms, during some particular seasons, are remarkably infested by a species of Chermes, which proves very destruc∣tive to the fruit. By feeding on these devouring insects, the Fringilla pinus is one of the most useful of our birds. This bird, the Fringilla tristis, my Fringilla exilis, and the Fringilla cannabina? together with the Fringilla Car∣duelis of the old world, all belong to the same natural genus, or family. They seem, in some respects, to con∣stitute a genus distinct from the Fringilla.</P>
<P>AS these FRAGMENTS profess to contain some <HI>useful</HI> observations,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the motto, in the Title-Page.</NOTE> I think this a proper place to observe, that many of the birds of Pennsylvania, and other parts of the United-States, are so extremely useful to man, by destroying insects and reptiles of various kinds, that they ought studiously to be preserved, if not by the LAWS, at least by the GOOD-SENSE, of the country. It would require many observations to give a complete list and history of these USEFUL BIRDS. I am not in possession of a sufficient quantity of facts for this purpose: but some observations I can offer, as materials for future inquirers.</P>
<P>It may, in the first place, be observed, that insects appear to be the first food of almost all the birds of our country. The more I have inquired, the more I have been convinced, that almost all birds live, in some measure, upon insects. Even those species which consume considerable quantities of feeds, berries, and fruit, also consume large quantities of insects: and there are reasons to believe, that others whose principal food is the nectar of plants also live partly upon these insects. Thus Mr. Brandis<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the article Trochilus in Ginelin's edition of the Systema Natr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae. TOM. I. P. 485.</NOTE> found the vestiges of insects in the stomach of the Trochilus, or Hum∣ming-Bird, one of the last birds one would have suspected of feeding on animal food.</P>
<P>The greater number of our smaller birds of the order of <HI>Passeres,</HI> seem to demand our attention and protection. Some of them feed pretty entirely upon insects, and others upon a mixed food, that is, insects and the vegetable feeds, &amp;c. Many of them contribute much to our pleasure by the melody of their notes. I believe the injury they do us is but small compared to the good they render us. I shall mention, under six different heads, a few of the use∣ful birds of this and some other orders.</P>
<P N="1">I. Muscicapa acadica of Gmelin? This is the Lesser Crested Flycatcher of Pennant. It is called in Pennsylvania the Lesser or Wood-Pewe. This little bird builds in woods and in forests. After the young have left the nests, the parents conduct them to the gardens and habitations of men. Here the whole brood dwells in trees near the houses, where they are fed with the common house-fly, and other insects, that are caught by the old birds. The young ones are soon capable of obtaining their food in the same way. This species of Muscicapa visits us in the spring, and commonly continues with us until late in September, when it retires southerly to winter.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Motacilla Sialis, or Blue-Bird, feeds principally, if not entirely, upon insects, both such as are flying and and such as are reptile. It is said they eat currants.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="035159_0039_100129F34D8E3700"/>
III. Most of our species of Picus, or Woodpecker, appear to me to be very useful in destroying insects, particularly those which injure our forest and orchard-trees. It is true, these birds are sometimes injurious to us, by eating some of our finest fruits, particularly our cherries, and therefore pains are taken to expell them from our gardens. But they devour vast numbers of insects, particularly some of those species which prove so destructive to the trunk of the trees, such as the coleopterous insects, which, perhaps, do as much mischief as the caterpillars.</P>
<P N="4">IV. As a devourer of pernicious insects, one of the most useful birds with which I am acquainted, is the House-Wren, or Certhia familiaris?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Tables, it is called Certhia familiaris <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> This little bird seems peculiarly fond of the society of man, and it must be confessed, that it is often protected by his interested care. From observing the usefulness of this bird in destroying in∣sects, it has long been a custom, in many parts of our country, to six a small box at the end of a long pole in gardens, about houses, &amp;c. as a place for it to build in. In these boxes they build and hatch their young. When the young are hatched, the parent birds feed them with a variety of different insects, particularly such as are in∣jurious in gardens. One of my friends<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. John H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kewelder, of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, in Pennsylvania.</NOTE> was at the trouble to observe the number of times that a pair of these birds came from their box, and returned with insects for their young. He found that they did this from forty to sixty times in an hour; and in one particular hour the birds carried food to their young, seventy-one times. In this business, they were engaged the greater part of the day; say twelve hours. Taking the medium, therefore, of fifty times an hour, it appeared that a single pair of these birds took from the cabbage, sallad, beans, peas, and other vegetables in the garden, at least six hundred insects in the course of one day. This calculation proceeds upon the supposition, that the two birds took each only a single insect each time. But it is highly probable they often took several at a time.</P>
<P>The species of Certhia of which I am speaking generally hatches twice during the course of the summer. They are very numerous about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the United-States.</P>
<P>The fact just related is well calculated to show the importance of attending to the preservation of some of our native birds. The esculent vegetables of a whole garden may, perhaps, be preserved from the depredations of differ∣ent species of insects by ten or fifteen pair of these small birds: and independently of this essential service, they are an extremely agreeable companion to man: for their note is pleasing. A gentleman, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, thinks he has already reaped much advantage from the services of these Wrens. About his fruit-trees, he has placed a number of boxes for their nests. In these boxes, they very readily breed, and feed themselves and their young with the insects, which are so destructive to the various kinds of fruit-trees, and other vegetables.</P>
<P N="5">V. The services of the Ibis in devouring the reptiles of Egypt are well known. They procured to this bird a venera∣tion and regard which form an interesting fact in its history, and in the history of human superstitions. The Storks are, perhaps, not less useful. Pliny tells us, that these birds were so much regarded for destroying ser∣pents, that in Thessaly, in his age, it was a capital crime to kill them, and that the punishment was the same as that for murder. Virgil hints at the usefulness of the stork when he describes it as "longis invisa colubris." In Holland, even in our times, they go wild, protected by the government, from a sense of their usefulness in the way I have mentioned.</P>
<P>In Britain, if it were not for the Herons, and some other birds of this tribe, the frogs, the toads, and other rep∣tiles, would increase to so great a degree, as to prove a real nuisance. North-America abounds with birds of this order; and we even have some species of Ibis, very nearly allied to the Ibis of Egypt, such as the Tantalus Loculator, or Wood-Pelecan;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Wood Ibis of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnant.</NOTE> the Tantalus ruber, or Scarlet Ibis,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Red Curlew of Catesby.</NOTE> the Tantalus fuscus or Brown Ibis,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Brown Curlew of Catesby.</NOTE> and the Tantalus albus, or White Ibis.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">White Curlew of Catesby.</NOTE> Mr. Bartram informs us, that the first of these birds feeds "on serpents, young alligators, frogs, and other reptiles."<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Travels, &amp;c.

In the midst of all their superstitions, I do not find, however, that the native Americans have ever paid any par∣ticular regard to this bird. I cannot learn that any of these species of Tantalus have ever been seen in Pennsylvania.</P>

VI. Some of the birds of the Vultur-kind are extremely useful to man, by destroying immense quantities of car∣rion, which serve to vitiate the air, and perhaps in some instances to give rise to malignant epidemics. The Vultur Aura, or Turkey-Buzzard of our country, is one of the most useful of these birds. In Virginia it is protected by a law of that state. The Abbé Clavigero speaks of the usefulness of the <HI>Cozcaquauhtli,</HI> or King of the Zopi∣lots, the Vultur Papa of Linnaeus. "The Zopilot, says this writer, is a most useful bird to that country (Mexico), for they not only clear the fields, but attend the crocodiles and destroy the eggs which the females of those dread∣ful amphibious animals leave in the sand to be hatched by the heat of the sun. The destruction of such a bird ought to be prohibited under severe penalties."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The History of Mexico. Vol. 1. P 48.</NOTE></P>
<P>I am sensible, that these few facts, which are thrown together without any regard to order, can be of little use except in as far as they may turn the attention of other persons, who possess more leisure and information than myself, to the subject, which is at once curious and important. It appears to to me be a subject peculiarly interesting to my coun∣trymen. Perhaps, few parts of the world are more infested with noxious insects than the United-States. The greater number of these insects are, I believe, natives of the country, though our partiality to the soil which gave us birth has not always allowed us to acknowledge this truth. Thus we give to the Hessians the honour of in∣troducing among us that most pernicious insect, the Hessian-Fly, which, for several years, has committed, and still commits, such alarming ravages on some of our most valuable grains, particularly the Wheat and the Rye. But this insect is, undoubtedly, a native of America. How it came to be, for so long a time, overlooked, will probably be mentioned in a memoir, concerning this and other noxious insects, which I hope to publish.</P>
<P>Many of the pernicious insects of the United-States seem to be increasing, instead of diminishing. Some of these insects which originally confined their ravages to the native or wild vegetables, have since begun their depredations upon the foreign vegetables, which are often more agreeable to their palates. Thus the Bruchus Pisi, or Pea-Fly, is a native, and seems originally to have fed, in a great measure unnoticed, upon the indigenous vegetables which are allied to the Pea: but since the introduction of this last<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pisum sativum.</NOTE> among us, it is the principal, if not the only, vege∣table which suffers from the ravages of this insect. The Hessian-Fly could not originally have inhabited the Wheat, the Rye, and other similar gramina of this kind, for these vegetables are not natives of America. It is now more formidable to us than would be an army of twenty thousand Hessians, or of any other twenty thousand hirelings, supplied with all the implements of war. The caterpillar, which has begun its ravages upon the leaves of the Lombardy Poplar,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Populus dilat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton.</NOTE> that contributes so much to beautify our city, is most probably a native of our woods. It prefers this fine foreigner to the less palatable leaves upon which it has been formerly accustomed to feed. Other instances of this kind might be mentioned. They show how very necessary it is to watch the migrations of insects from the native to the introduced vegetables; and they teach us a truth, not I think suffi∣ciently attended to by naturalists, that different kinds of insects are much less confined to vegetables of the same species, or to species of the same genus, than has been commonly imagined. It is certain, that the same species of insects, in America, often feeds indiscriminately, and in succession, upon plants of very opposite genera, and even of very different natural orders.</P>
<P>Hitherto, too little progress has been made among us in the discovery of remedies for the great mischiefs occasioned by insects. The subject has not been examined with sufficient attention. It has given place to discussions and inquiries of very inferior utility; and I fear it will not claim all that industrious attention which it so well merits, until the evil shall have spread still farther. It is, doubtless, difficult, but it is by no means impossible, to prevent the ravages of noxious insects. In this important business, something has already been done in our country. We have discovered a method of diminishing the depredations of the little bug, called Cucumber-Fly, which proves so destructive to the cucurbitaceous vines, particularly those of the Cucumber, and Musk-melon.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the Tables. Page 4.</NOTE> By manuring our wheat-lands, and thereby increasing the strength and vigour of the wheat, we have lessened the evil of the Hessian-Fly. By suspending to our young apple and other trees pieces of tow, impregnated with a mixture of brimstone and train-oil, we have learned how to frighten away the periodical Locusts (Cicada
<PB N="24" REF="035159_0041_100129FCA9E28CA8"/>septem∣decim of Linnaeus), which often do so much injury to our orchards.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is only the female Cicada septemdecim that does mischief to our orchards, &amp;c. This she does by making incisions into the tender branches, to deposit her eggs. In consequence of this operation, the leaves perish. The insect does no mischief "by devouring the leaves," as has been ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rted by some respectable writers. See Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. Vol. III. Introduction. Page xxii.</NOTE> The American Philosophical Society, by calling the attention of the public to the decay of our Peach-trees, has brought us to a better acquaintance with the causes of this decay, and with the means of preventing it. Insects are no doubt one of these causes.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The peach-insect (It is an Ichn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umon) is observed to injure young trees more than old ones. Perhaps the best remedy against the mischief of this insect is to dig up the ground about the roots in the spring-season, and to take out the larva or worm. This may be done without much difficulty, and the operation does not in∣jure the tree. Do not the peach-trees suffer more from our late night-frosts than from insects? These night-frosts, especially after rainy whether, in the months of February and March, when the sap is ascending, are certainly very pernicious. They occasion the bark to crack so that the sap is permitted to run out. I suspect that this is one of the principal causes of the decay of our peach-trees.</NOTE> We have made some progress in preventing the mischief of the Bruchus Pisi, or Pea-Fly, which proves so destructive to one of the finest esculent vegetables. But all that has yet been done is very little compared to that which re∣mains to be done. The subject is as new as it is important.</P>
<P>I am very far from imagining, that the preservation of some of those species of birds which I have mentioned would be the <HI>only</HI> means of guarding against, or of limiting, the depredations of <HI>any</HI> of our noxious insects. In a system so complex, and so difficult, as this, many agents must be employed. Most of them have a necessary connection with the industry of man, which is an implement that gives him an immense, an almost unlimited, command over all the living objects of this earth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is in his power to increase or diminish the number of animals and vege∣tables about him; and even to destroy <HI>whole species.</HI> Some of these means must be suggested, if they cannot be put into immediate practice, by the ingenuity of philosophers, or observers. Their speculations will sometimes, per∣haps, be trivial, and useless. Now and then, their "wild blunders and risible absurdities" (to use the words of Dr. Johnson,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the Preface to his Dictionary of the English Language. Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> on a subject, indeed, very different from the present) may for a time furnish folly with laughter, and harden ignorance in contempt; but useful diligence will at length prevail."</P>
<P>The few facts which I have mentioned will be sufficient to show, that some good in the prevention of mischievous insects, may be expected from different species of birds. Every American farmer's experience will furnish him with some additional fact in support of this notion. If careful observations on this subject are made, we shall soon know which are our friends, and which are our enemies: which deserve to be cherished and preserved, and which it will be our interest to banish or destroy.</P>

<P>THE preceding "fragmentary rubbish" (to use the words of Donne) is thrown upon the public with some degree of confidence: —with confidence, merely because it regards a country, the natural history of which has hitherto been so little attended to. I must observe, though perhaps the reader will not believe me, that I could render these pages more worthy of his notice. But I want leisure. It is this want of leisure that has prevented me from publishing a number of tracts, relative to the natural history of North-America, which have long lain in my closet, in a state nearly as imperfect as these very imperfect FRAGMENTS. Whether they will ever be published, will depend, in some measure, upon the reception given to the present work.</P>
<P>I ask, I look for, no slattering reception. All I ask, all I require, is to be informed, by those who love and study nature, that my present labours are not altogether useless, and unentertaining. Until there shall arise among us some happy genius, qualified by that union of talents, of leisure, and enthusiastic ardour, which is necessary to form the character of a genuine naturalist, every collection of facts, every individual fact, that will tend to illustrate the natural history of the United-States, <HI>ought</HI> to be received with candour, and indulgence.</P>
<P>I have entitled these Fragments, "Part First," because if this is favourably received, I shall publish, in the course of the next year, two other parts, relative to other subjects of the natural history of our State. I have made considerable progress in an extensive work on the Vegetables of Pennsylvania, and some of the adjoining States. But this will appear in a separate form: —I will not say when. For who does not know, that "the promises of authors are like the promises of lovers?"</P>
