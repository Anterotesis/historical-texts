<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I began the following Poem, my in∣tention was only to commemorate (for my own private satisfaction) the different scenes and places which I beheld in my travels through America; but, after finishing it, I began to think it might be entertaining to the public; and at the request of some gentlemen to whom I have shewn the manuscript, have agreed to publish it. With respect to the poem in general, I shall on∣ly inform the reader, that I have frequently used the <HI>present tense</HI> instead of the <HI>past,</HI> in order to keep the action the more alive. The verses in∣troduced into the latter end of the poem, and the separate pieces added to it, were inserted in hopes of rendering the whole the more entertaining.</P>

<HEAD>Travels Through America.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY native home, and dear companions all,</L>
<L>Juvenile pleasures and the ev'ning ball,</L>
<L>The prancing steed, and the quick-scenting hound,</L>
<L>I bade adieu, and thus began my round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From fair Hibernia's healthy, verdant plain,</L>
<L>With Captain Stone, I rush'd into the main.</L>
<L>At th' age of seventeen and nine months more,</L>
<L>I bade adieu unto my native shore.</L>
<L>I soon beheld the lofty billows roll,</L>
<L>And light'ning flash, while thunder shook the pole;</L>
<L>Our vessel tossed thro' the stormy main;</L>
<L>Then oft I wish'd to be at home again.</L>
<L>Alas! how vain my fruitless wishes were,</L>
<L>'Midst seas of trouble, far from parent's care;</L>
<L>Where thunders clash'd, and seas roll'd mountain high,</L>
<L>Which made me <HI>heave</HI> 'till I thought I should die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now <HI>Aeolus</HI> ceases—<HI>Neptune</HI> rules alone—</L>
<L>The sky is clear—the sea is all in foam;</L>
<PB N="8" REF="025490_0005_0FCCE5865C34EAB0"/>
<L>Boreas shuts his magazine of storms;</L>
<L>The glass goes round, and we sing <HI>Wars-alarms.</HI></L>
<L>Thus pass'd the time for half a day or more,</L>
<L>'Till, loud on deck, we heard the trumpet roar,</L>
<L>'<HI>All hands aloft—loosen every sail'</HI></L>
<L>The wind then blowing a delightful gale.</L>
<L>All-hands arose and lent a willing hand;</L>
<L>And now we steer, due-west, for Newfoundland.</L>
<L>Six weeks elapsed, ere we reach'd the Banks,</L>
<L>Where the rude sailors shew their active pranks.</L>
<L>Here each youngster had to pay a fine,</L>
<L>As seamen do when first they cross the Line:</L>
<L>A rastic youth who did not soon agree</L>
<L>To pay his bottle, was immediately</L>
<L>To the yard-arm hois'd, with rapid motion;</L>
<L>Thence headlong plung'd down into the ocean!</L>
<L>Thus pass'd the time, while we were on the banks;</L>
<L>The youngsters suffer'd by the sailor's pranks,</L>
<L>'Till from mast-head, we heard one loudly call,</L>
<L><HI>"A fleet a-head!"</HI> which rous'd us one and all.</L>
<L>But lo! from deck, we soon did plainly see,</L>
<L>That such huge vessels never cross'd the sea!</L>
<L><HI>"Islands of Ice"</HI> the Captain loudly cries:</L>
<L>"<HI>About ship, Ho!</HI> Ere I be tak'n a prize</L>
<L>"By these huge monsters, tyrants of the main,</L>
<L>"Whose touch is Death, I'll e'en go back again,"</L>
<L>The man of war
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Our Convoy.</HI></NOTE> now fir'd a signal gun,</L>
<L>And steer'd due south 'till setting of the sun,</L>
<PB N="9" REF="025490_0006_0FCD48314B4F62C0"/>
<L>When from aloft a sailor gladly spy'd</L>
<L>The distant shore, and <HI>"Land oho!"</HI> he cry'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seven long weeks (I thought them full a score)</L>
<L>We plow'd the deep before we came on shore.</L>
<L>I soon forgot my troubles on the main,</L>
<L>And with surprize gaz'd on the woody plane
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newfoundland.</HI></NOTE>.</L>
<L>Nor Cows, nor Horses here attract the eye;</L>
<L>Nor verdant fields of Barley, Wheat, or Rye;</L>
<L>Nor meadows green, nor gentle-gliding stream;</L>
<L>Nor rural pleasures here are ever seen.</L>
<L>Nor does the huntsman ever wind his horn,</L>
<L>And give his game a timely loud alarm;</L>
<L>Nor do we hear the music of the groves,</L>
<L>The woodland Thrushes, nor the Turtle-Doves;</L>
<L>Nor purling stream, nor the loud water-fall,</L>
<L>Are ever heard in Newfoundland at all.</L>
<L>Nor do sweet odours float and scent the air;</L>
<L>Nor primrose flowers deck the virgin's hair;</L>
<L>Nor ought to please the palate have I found,</L>
<L>In all my travels thro' this desert ground.</L>
<L>Nor is the air agreeable to the touch;</L>
<L>But, here, perhaps, you'll think I say too much,</L>
<L>As it is healthy—that I don't deny;</L>
<L>But the cold winters cause many to die:</L>
<L>Once I myself beheld a dismal sight,</L>
<L>A man found frozen, in the dead of night,</L>
<L>Within a small mile of his native home,</L>
<PB N="10" REF="025490_0007_0FCD4832D19CCDE8"/>
<L>On the white path extended stiff alone!</L>
<L>A place of worship here is scarcely found,</L>
<L>But W—s, Gin and Grog, swarm the country round.</L>
<L>Whoever drinks the most indecent toast,</L>
<L>Believe me, sir, of him they think the most.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A land displeasing to each virtuous mind,</L>
<L>My muse abhors and gladly leaves behind:</L>
<L>For FREE COLUMBIA next I'll sound the lyre,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Freedoms cause</HI> poetic thoughts inspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once more I ventur'd on the stormy main,</L>
<L>And four long weeks I plow'd the sea again,</L>
<L>Ere I arrived at the blessed land,</L>
<L>Where PEACE and FREEDOM now do wave the wand.</L>
<L>My former suff'rings, thro' th' Atlantic wide,</L>
<L>Were but pleasures compar'd to Fundy's
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A stormy Bay between Halifax and New-Hampshire.</HI></NOTE> tide;</L>
<L>For, here the sea rolls roaring mountain-high;</L>
<L>And bursts of thunder rend th' encumber'd sky!</L>
<L>Quick-lightnings flash, and light the stormy main,</L>
<L>As if the gods were fighting for domain!</L>
<L>Neptune his bursting billows rolls so high,</L>
<L>That all on board conjecture they must die.</L>
<L>A sudden surge throws us on our beam-end;</L>
<L>We now prepare to meet our fatal end!</L>
<L>But lo! she rights, and stems the stormy wave!</L>
<L>And now, once more, we hope our lives to save.</L>
<PB N="11" REF="025490_0008_0FCD48341C72B700"/>
<L>Now Boreas, with a brisk and pleasant gale,</L>
<L>Triumphant rides, and fills each spreading sail;</L>
<L>The waves subside—we with mutual ardour,</L>
<L>Sail S. West, 'till we make Boston harbour—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAIL COLUMBIA! and thy martial sons,</L>
<L>Who dar'd oppose, with undisciplin'd guns,</L>
<L>The British troops, tho' long inur'd to arms,</L>
<L>And rush to battle from your peaceful farms!</L>
<L>Oft have I wish'd to join you in the toil,</L>
<L>Of gaining FREEDOM for your native soil.</L>
<L>Delightful task! tho' it was laborious,</L>
<L>To conquer tyrants and reign victorious;</L>
<L>To save a nation from base tyranny,</L>
<L>And to gain freedom for posterity!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BOSTONIANS, HAIL! your valour will resound</L>
<L>Thro' foreign climes, and thro' this country round;</L>
<L>Posterity on marble will inscribe,</L>
<L><HI>An Era new!</HI> from your throwing in the tide,</L>
<L>The tea on which England laid a duty,</L>
<L>In hopes to get, by clandestine booty,</L>
<L>An immense sum of money, to defray</L>
<L>The D'—I knows what, from North-America.</L>
<L>Let Briton know that all her pomp was vain,</L>
<L>And that Americans would <HI>Death</HI> sustain,</L>
<L>Ere they'd submit to bear the British yoke,</L>
<L>Which, they well knew, their liberty would choke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="025490_0009_0FCD48359C772F88"/>
<L>HAIL BUNKER's HILL! thou once a bloody plain,</L>
<L>Posterity will sing each hero's fame,</L>
<L>Who on thee bled, and died full of gore;</L>
<L>Fought for COLUMBIA 'till they were no more.</L>
<L>BOSTONIANS will on thee, on future days,</L>
<L>Fire thirteen guns and celebrate their praise;</L>
<L>The tuneful choir will join their lively song;</L>
<L>The groves and woodlands echo to the throng,</L>
<L><HI>An Era new!</HI>—an Era new'll resound,</L>
<L>From woods, and rocks, and heroes under ground!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Five days have I, with busy eye, survey'd</L>
<L>This martial town, renowned for its trade,</L>
<L>And now, more south, the country to explore,</L>
<L>With Captain Pillsb'ry sail'd for Baltimore.</L>
<L>With pleasure I, for three weeks and a day,</L>
<L>Survey'd the coast thence to Chesepeak-Bay;</L>
<L>Nor blust'ring storms, nor billows loud do roar,</L>
<L>But ocean smiles along this blissful shore.</L>
<L>The woodland pine, in sign of freedom, waves</L>
<L>Its lofty head, and thus old England braves;</L>
<L>The woods and groves now echo to the main,</L>
<L><HI>An Era new! Columbia's born again!</HI></L>
<L>Then Neptune answers from his oozy bed,</L>
<L><HI>An Era new! the British troops have fled</HI>—</L>
<L>Now up the Chesepeak we quickly sail'd,</L>
<L>And at Annapolis ourselves regal'd;</L>
<PB N="13" REF="025490_0010_0FCD4838E97670E0"/>
<L>The rural prospects thence along the shore,</L>
<L>Are highly pleasing up to Baltimore,</L>
<L>Which town improves like Rome in days of yore.</L>
<L>Early next day, I did a seat engage</L>
<L>To Philadelphia in the flying stage;</L>
<L>My muse was mute till we reach'd Brandiwine,</L>
<L>Whose bloody plain did rouse the sacred nine!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail purling stream,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brandiwine Creek.</HI></NOTE> once tinctured with the gore</L>
<L>Of heroes brave, who for Columbia bore</L>
<L>The pangs of death, on yon polluted plain,</L>
<L>To free their country from the tyrants reign!</L>
<L>You lofty pine beheld young heroes fall,</L>
<L>Who in obedience to their country's call,</L>
<L>Left rural sports, and love's encircling arms,</L>
<L>When Columbia call'd her injur'd sons TO ARMS!</L>
<L>Resound ye groves, resound each heroe's name,</L>
<L>Echoes convey to foreign climes their fame,</L>
<L>Who fought for <HI>freedom</HI> on yon bloody field,</L>
<L>And dar'd to die, ere they'd to Britain yield!—</L>
<L>Once more, I quit the muses warbling lyre;</L>
<L>But soon again am rous'd by yonder spire,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Christ church's steeple Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Whose lofty top, o'er the woodland, I see</L>
<L>Erected to a very high degree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I now behold Schuylkill's silver stream,</L>
<L>Whose verdant banks would grace a poet's theme;</L>
<PB N="14" REF="025490_0011_0FCD483A2A05D000"/>
<L>Here the brave youth, to cool his ardent blood,</L>
<L>Plunges headlong into the circling flood;</L>
<L>With lusty sinews, thence to yonder shore,</L>
<L>He works his way, nor dreads the waves no more.</L>
<L>Behold him now, frisking about the plain,</L>
<L>Void of those robes which Eden did disdain;</L>
<L>And now, quick-stepping to the water-side,</L>
<L>Headlong again, he dives into the tide.</L>
<L>Behold the prancing steed, with nostrils wide,</L>
<L>Snuffing the surge, and snorting thro' the tide;</L>
<L>The active boy fast holding by his mane,</L>
<L>Now sinking low, now rising high again;</L>
<L>His mighty heart, brac'd by the cooling flood,</L>
<L>Bounds fearless on, until he tips the mud;</L>
<L>Then, to the shore, the boy directs the steed,</L>
<L>And gladly boasts of his heroic deed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail nymphs and swains, sporting along the shore,</L>
<L>Now from the flood to you my muses soar;</L>
<L>Sport on ye swains, these happy hours enjoy;</L>
<L>Nor let old age innocent mirth destroy.</L>
<L>When nature prompts the sprightly youth to play,</L>
<L>Her sacred callings let him quick obey;</L>
<L>For she, unerring calls for nought in vain,</L>
<L>But always is, and e'er will be the same.</L>
<L>I must not omit yon sequester'd shade,</L>
<L>Where rural lovers sing their serenade,</L>
<L>When all is mute, save the purling stream,</L>
<L>Which joins harmoniously their warbling theme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="025490_0012_0FCD483BB26B2290"/>
<L>Hail PHILADELPHIA! I now behold</L>
<L>Thy regularity, as I've been told;</L>
<L>But more majestical thou dost appear,</L>
<L>More grand, more regular, and far more clear,</L>
<L>Than my ideas were of thy grand form,</L>
<L>Or even now my pen can well inform:</L>
<L>Governor PENN first its plan begun,</L>
<L>In imitation of old Babylon.</L>
<L>The streets are wide, and in a line direct;</L>
<L>The angles right where they do intersect;</L>
<L>The footway pav'd nicely with bricks and tiles,</L>
<L>From north to south, nearly two English miles;</L>
<L>And from both rivers
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Schuylkill, and Delaware.</HI></NOTE> to the centre street,</L>
<L>Nam'd, first, second, and so on till they meet;</L>
<L>That half alone joining the Delaware,</L>
<L>Is built out nearly to the centre square;</L>
<L>The buildings shew no great variety,</L>
<L>But the most pleasing regularity;</L>
<L>Void of extremes, the houses friendly join,</L>
<L>Nor cottage low, nor palace, rouse the nine,</L>
<L>To sound the warbling lyre. Upon the whole,</L>
<L>From the Arctic, to the Antarctic pole,</L>
<L>View all the cities round this flying ball,</L>
<L>Their commerce, shape, and regulations all;</L>
<L>Compare their climates, and situation,</L>
<L>Their buildings, cleanness, and navigation.</L>
<L>Then judge impartially, and you will find</L>
<L>That Philadelphia most will please your mind—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="025490_0013_0FCD483D1D7A5B30"/>
<L>Here I resided more than half a year,</L>
<L>During which time I've shed many a tear,</L>
<L>For an only brother, who, as I've heard,</L>
<L>Was nightly slain, and at St. John's inter'd.</L>
<L>Oft have I to the lonely fields retir'd,</L>
<L>To pay a tribute nature oft requir'd.</L>
<L>The gloomy rocks, and desolates unknown,</L>
<L>Have often heard my solitary moan.</L>
<L>Nor purling streams no more divert my mind,</L>
<L>Nor woodland music floating in the wind;</L>
<L>Pensive I pass the heavy hours away;</L>
<L>Nor pleasure find in either night or day—</L>
<L>As sadly musing on the dire event,</L>
<L>Which caus'd my grief, with body downward bent,</L>
<L>A walk'd the streets, careless whither I stray'd,</L>
<L>A lady's servant call'd to me and said,</L>
<L>"Please to walk in—here is a gentleman</L>
<L>Who wishes much to see you"—in I ran—</L>
<L>Amaz'd and speechless, as some statues stand,</L>
<L>I stood and gaz'd, nor words cou'd I command!</L>
<L>Such pleasing raptures fill'd my glowing breast,</L>
<L>As cannot well by language be express'd—</L>
<L>The stranger rose, and tears of joy we shed—</L>
<L>It was my brother, who, I thought, was dead.</L>
<L>But seeing him in visions oft by night,</L>
<L>I fear'd some phantom now deceiv'd my sight;</L>
<L>Fond nature ceas'd—and now, with language meek,</L>
<L>And trembling voice, I thus to him did speak:</L>
<PB N="17" REF="025490_0014_0FCD48421A8ED018"/>
<L>Do I dream, or did the heav'nly powers,</L>
<L>To 'bate my grief, restore thy vital pow'rs?</L>
<L>My dearest brother! art thou still alive?</L>
<L>Ah! how dist thou the mortal blow survive?</L>
<L>He now inform'd me of the false report,</L>
<L>And down we sat and drank a bottle of port.</L>
<L>Ravish'd with joy, I seize the flowing bowl,</L>
<L>And in it drown the sorrows of my soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye good distressed, learn from this t' indure</L>
<L>Those earthly troubles which ye cannot cure;</L>
<L>And doubt not but the great, almighty Jove,</L>
<L>Will in due time your troubles all remove.</L>
<L>Some you may see who suffer to the end;</L>
<L>But can you tell to what their suffirings tend?</L>
<L>Or can you prove them useless to that whole,</L>
<L>'Whose body Nature is, and God the soul?'</L>
<L>If not, believe, the universal cause,</L>
<L>Constantly acts by wise, unerring laws.</L>
<L>In the small circle of your transient years,</L>
<L>You oft will meet with troubles, sorrows, fears;</L>
<L>For these are passions, natural to man,</L>
<L>You may depress, but, shun them, never can:</L>
<L>Oh, let not these prevent your being wise,</L>
<L>And the great end, <HI>Eternal Bliss,</HI> to prize!</L>
<L>For know, fond man, thou soon wilt reach the goal,</L>
<L>Thy race will end, and thy immortal soul,</L>
<L>To realms unknown to human passions fly,</L>
<L>Where it will never, never, never die!—</L>
<PB N="18" REF="025490_0015_0FCD48431F19BB20"/>
<L>O! how important is this truth divine!</L>
<L>O, may it ring thro' ev'ry earthly clime!</L>
<L>May all our actions ever please the Lord;</L>
<L>And may our souls enjoy his blest reward!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Delaware's tide doth next attract my song,</L>
<L>While, on the shore, methinks I see a throng</L>
<L>Of British soldiers, officers and flags,</L>
<L>Preparing to engage the <HI>floating kegs</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Those kegs were, sall of powder and combuslibles, sent down the river Delaware, on float, by the Americans, in order to set sire to the British ship∣ping at Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE>.</L>
<L>Sure such a battle ne'er was known before,</L>
<L>As <HI>floating kegs,</HI> against the <HI>British corps!</HI></L>
<L>Descend ye nine, and strike each warbling string,</L>
<L>Let groves and woodlands, rocks and mountains, sing</L>
<L>This glorious battle 'twixt the British troops,</L>
<L>And a few floating kegs with wooden hoops!</L>
<L>Which side conquer'd I'll not pretend to say;</L>
<L>But report says that Britons ran away!</L>
<L>Others, in favour of the British, swear,</L>
<L>They did the rebel kegs to pieces tear;</L>
<L>And do maintain, they stood their ground till night,</L>
<L>Briskly engaged in the busy sight;</L>
<L>But that at length, for want of something t'eat,</L>
<L>They were, by hunger forced to retreat—</L>
<L>One truth is clear, their cannons roar'd all day,</L>
<L>But, what exploits they've done, I cannot say;</L>
<L>Let others praise those men of sterling courage,</L>
<L>Whose groat a day will searcely buy them porridge!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="19" REF="025490_0016_0FCD4847DC856FF8"/>
<L>I now did leave this city of renown,</L>
<L>And in a stage-boat sail'd for Bordentown;</L>
<L>The wind was fair—passengers all merry;</L>
<L>Fore and aft pass'd porter, punch and sherry.</L>
<L>Thus as we sailed merrily along,</L>
<L>One of the ladies sang a lover's song;</L>
<L>The phrase was simple, and the subject plain;</L>
<L>It was <HI>Amanda</HI> and her rural swain.</L>
<L>Her charming voice excell'd (I don't say wrong)</L>
<L>The warbling numbers of Italian song.</L>
<L>When she began, methought the atmosphere</L>
<L>Did ring with sounds seraphic in mine ear.</L>
<L>I gaz'd and listen'd—wish'd—and gaz'd again—</L>
<L>Hop'd—fear'd and doubted—sigh'd, but all in vain.</L>
<L>What else had follow'd, I must not reveal;</L>
<L>It is most prudent folly to conceal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The verdant shores afford a pleasing sight,</L>
<L>To all who do in rural scenes delight.</L>
<L>On the green margin of this silver stream,</L>
<L>The rural swains and rural nymphs are seen,</L>
<L>Frisking about, void of affectation;</L>
<L>Rul'd by nature, more than education.</L>
<L>Thrice happy they who thus can spend their days,</L>
<L>In scenes of pleasure, not in search of praise;</L>
<L>Contented with what Providence has giv'n</L>
<L>They fill their happy circle mark'd by heav'n;</L>
<L>Strangers to all the busy scenes of life,</L>
<L>To liberal arts and domestic strife;</L>

<L>What tho' Saturn's ring be to them unknown,</L>
<L>And the volcanoes Hershel saw'n the moon?</L>
<L>Or, what if they ne'er plow'd the stormy main,</L>
<L>In search of knowledge, or in search of gain?</L>
<L>Nay, what if they have never seen the town,</L>
<L>Grand buildings, shipping, or a silken gown?</L>
<L>Contentment still is theirs—and that is more</L>

<L>Let others, thro' long optic tubes descry</L>
<L>The course of planets thro' th' aerial sky;</L>

<L>When direct, when retrogade their motions;</L>

<L>What cares yon swain if Mars were headlong hurl'd</L>
<L>Into the sun, or 'gainst some other world?</L>
<L>Or if great Jupiter was whirl'd and toss'd</L>
<L>From his bright orb, and in oblivion lost?</L>
<L>Or, what cares he, if Aetna's blazing bowl,</L>
<L>Spouted its wild fire to the southern pole?</L>
<L>Or if the demons of the ocean rise,</L>
<L>And toss the foaming billows to the skies;</L>
<L>Then hurl poor sailors 'gainst a savage shore,</L>
<L>Where they are never, never, heard of more?</L>
<L>Contented still, the swain wou'd frisk along,</L>
<L>Sport with his nymph, and sing his rural song;</L>
<L>Nor feel a blow from the hand of heaven,</L>
<L>Before it was absolutely given.</L>
<L>But the Astronomer, with busy eye,</L>
<L>Wou'd view with terror, the injured sky,</L>
<L>And fear the earth, now rolling in her sphere,</L>
<L>Wou'd meet her doom before another year;</L>
<L>Perhaps conjecture, as she's next to Mars,</L>
<L>She'd next be hurl'd into some of the stars;</L>
<L>Knowing that scripture says, 'At the last day,</L>
<L>Earth will be burnt, th'elements melt away.'</L>
<L>Thus discontent wou'd arise from knowledge,</L>
<L>And pleasures dwell in a country cottage.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus was I musing on the former hint,</L>
<L>"The less man knows the greater his content,"</L>
<L>When Burlington appeared full in sight,</L>
<L>A prospect which I view'd with great delight.</L>
<PB N="22" REF="025490_0019_0FCD484D1725BC48"/>
<L>My mose would fain remain here pretty long,</L>
<L>It doth afford such subjects for a song:</L>
<L>The gliding stream, and the sequester'd grove;</L>
<L>The verdant landscape, and the grazing drove;</L>
<L>The fishes sporting in their element;</L>
<L>Now springing from it, and in their descent,</L>
<L>Lashing the water sidelong as they fall,</L>
<L>Are subjects pleasing to the muses all:</L>
<L>The pleasant prospect of this silver stream,</L>
<L>And vessels sailing, all shou'd swell my theme;</L>
<L>But the fair wind wafts us so quick along,</L>
<L>That Bristol next attracts my humble song.</L>
<L>This town, tho' small, is pleasant to the eye,</L>
<L>This I observed as we glided by,</L>
<L>And built upon a pleasant spot of land,</L>
<L>Which rises gradually from the strand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To BORDENTOWN, soft numbers to diffuse</L>
<L>'Midst vernal shades, now hastes my panting muse.</L>
<L>With equal wing, our vessel sails along,</L>
<L>The town appears, and now the decks we throng.</L>
<L>"Down mainsail ho!" the captain loudly cries,</L>
<L>"Stand by to haul the Jibb down, d—n your eyes—</L>

<L>Let go the anchor—get the boat on shore—</L>
<L>D—n your eyes, be guick, you son of a w—e."</L>

<L>They call him wicked, vulgar, and so forth,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, I haste on shore 'midst the sylvan groves</L>
<L>And curling fountains, where Vallonia roves.—</L>
<L>Ye sacred nine, on speedy wing descend,</L>
<L>And thou, Vallonia, all thy graces lend;</L>
<L>Assist me, while I sing 'midst rural shades,</L>
<L>And purling streams, ere nature's beauty fades.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas now that season of the circling year,</L>
<L>When burning Sol in Cancer did appear;</L>
<L>As I sat musing on a pleasant hill,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the music of a purling rill,</L>
<L>Which ran beneath thro' a sequester'd vale,</L>
<L>And seem'd to tell some fond, endearing tale;</L>
<L>A tale more soft than lovers can invent,</L>
<L>Whene'er they seek for <HI>reason to repent:</HI></L>
<L>While thus I sat, breathing ambrosial air,</L>
<L>I saw a damsel, slender, tall, and fair,</L>
<L>With modest steps, approaching to the stream;</L>
<L>More like a goddess than a Grecian queen.</L>
<L>A milk white dress she wore, a silken gown,</L>
<L>And to her waist her hair hung flowing down;</L>
<L>A branch of laurel in her hand she bore;</L>
<L>And with quick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ces sidelong view'd the shore.</L>
<L>She now arrived at her sylvan pool,</L>
<L>And quick disrob'd, her lovely limbs to cool.</L>
<PB N="24" REF="025490_0021_0FCD4852C1D64E70"/>
<L>Meanwhile she fearful glances cast around,</L>
<L>And trembling view'd th' inverted blue profound.</L>
<L>But when the falling lawn expos'd the fair,</L>
<L>No longer then, no longer cou'd I bear</L>
<L>The sole-distracting view—I trembling strove,</L>
<L>For to retire into the silent grove;</L>
<L>But, oh! I strove in vain—What shall be done?</L>
<L>'Twas now precisely setting of the sun;</L>
<L>And the full moon, majestically bright,</L>
<L>Shone thro' the woods, and seem'd to hail the night;</L>
<L>But, far less fair, her splendent face did seem,</L>
<L>Than this fair maid half-shaded in the stream.</L>
<L>Now struggling nature fain wou'd have her way;</L>
<L>But sacred honour will not her obey;</L>
<L>Alternate passions quickly rise and fall;</L>
<L>Oh! wretched me! why came I here at all;</L>
<L>Bear me, ye gods, from this distracting sight;</L>
<L>Or quickly shade me with the veil of night!</L>
<L>And thou, O moon, shed not thy borrow'd rays,</L>
<L>That I no longer on this scene may gaze!</L>
<L>Lo, now, with fearful eye, she look'd around,</L>
<L>As if surprised with some distant found;</L>
<L>With hasty steps then trembling gain'd the shore,</L>
<L>Afraid, methought, to stay one moment more:</L>
<L>With modest mien, she quickly did array,</L>
<L>In careless haste, and nimbly step'd away.</L>
<L>No longer to the hill was I confin'd,</L>
<L>I now cou'd go where e'er I had a mind.</L>
<L>Night coming on, I left this beauteous hill.</L>
<L>And bade Vallonia name this purling rill,</L>
<PB N="25" REF="025490_0022_0FCD485460AE1E90"/>
<L>The haunt of rural maids—and that ere long,</L>
<L>In yonder grove, once more, she'd hear my song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now bright Virgo receives the solar ball,</L>
<L>From Leo's claws, into her maiden hall;</L>
<L>And mlder rays shine thro' the atmosphere,</L>
<L>Which add new beauty to the circling year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Chanticleer joyfully hail'd the morn,</L>
<L>The howling hounds and the echoing horn,</L>
<L>From their soft slumber rous'd the tuneful train;</L>
<L>Which fill'd the groves with their melodious strain;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with their notes, I slowly to'rds the grove,</L>
<L>O'er dewy lawns, with careless steps did rove;</L>
<L>When, at some distance, to my great surprise,</L>
<L>A youthful damsel sat before mine eyes.</L>
<L>Amaz'd at this quite unexpected sight,</L>
<L>I quickly stop'd, and view'd her with delight.</L>
<L>Half afraid to approach her sylvan bow'r,</L>
<L>I stood aloof a quarter of an hour;</L>
<L>At length, resolved for to hail the maid,</L>
<L>I gently walked to her sylvan shade;</L>
<L>And with modest mien, and a loving air,</L>
<L>Held her white hand, and thus address'd the fair:</L>
<L>Be not amazed, fair, angelic maid,</L>
<L>My wand'ring steps have led me to thy shade,</L>
<L>Not to deprive thee of thy rural bliss,</L>
<L>But Oh! my fair, this milk-white hand to kiss.</L>
<L>"Alas!" she said, and trembled as she spoke,</L>
<L>"Some other person best would suit your joke:</L>
<PB N="26" REF="025490_0023_0FCD4855DE8746F0"/>
<L>Too late, alas! too late, I've learn'd to know,</L>
<L>By sad experience, what young men can do."—</L>
<L>Now sobbing sighs prevented her to speak;</L>
<L>And the big tears roll'd quickly down her cheek.</L>
<L>Again I spoke: Fair damsel have I caus'd</L>
<L>Thy sudden grief?—and for an answer pans'd.</L>
<L>"No sir," she said, with still more trembling voice,</L>
<L>"But woe is me since I approv'd his

<L>"He from my arms far, alas! is fled,</L>

<L>"And, ah! how often have I heard him say,</L>

<L>"Oh! would to God I never had been born."—</L>
<L>O, cease fair maid, cease thy pathetic strain;</L>
<L>Perhaps thy lover may return again;</L>
<L>Or, shou'd he not, pray think of him no more,</L>
<L>And a truer swain soon will you adore.</L>
<L>She rose, and to her sylvan shed did go;</L>
<L>And there she sang the story of her woe—</L>
<L>Nor turtle dove after losing its mate,</L>
<L>Nor woodland thrush, bemoaning her sad fate,</L>
<PB N="27" REF="025490_0024_0FCD485919262410"/>
<L>When the rude school-boy robb'd her of her young,</L>
<L>A more pathetic strain had ever sung:</L>
<L>The tuneful songsters jointly sing her tale,</L>
<L>'Till songs of sorrow echo thro' the vale!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye blooming fair, ye strangers yet to man,</L>
<L>Ah! learn in time your lover's mind to scan;</L>
<L>Ere you permit the freedom of a kiss,</L>
<L>Or something else, which some think not amiss,</L>
<L>Let sacred wedlock join you to your swain;</L>
<L>For without this, your love may be in vain.</L>
<L>That words prove not the heart to be sincere,</L>
<L>The sobbing sigh, and the big rolling tear,</L>
<L>Of poor ROLANDA, plainly do declare,</L>
<L>Who was not of deceitful man aware.</L>
<L>Ah! poor hapless maid, in vain did I try</L>
<L>To cheer thy mind, or stop the heavy sigh</L>
<L>Which swell'd thy loving breast—Adieu poor maid!</L>
<L>Heaven preserve thee in thy sylvan shade!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ere I enter the sequester'd grove,</L>
<L>I do invoke the great, almighty Jove,</L>
<L>To grant me patience to address the swain,</L>
<L>Who thus has caus'd ROLANDA to complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, faithless swain, who thus deceiv'd thy love,</L>

<L>Oh! think how awful to be headlong hurl'd,</L>

<L>With flaming vengeance, mid the dread abyss,</L>
<L>Where Satan's legions all do howl and hiss!</L>
<L>There, shrieking to dwell, midst infernal cries,</L>

<L>And then returned to the grove again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Ceres spreads her mantle all around,</L>
<L>And with her bounty covers o'er the ground;</L>
<L>In autumn's lap, she leaves her golden store,</L>
<L>With busy man, and thinks of it no more:</L>
<L>The bending trees discharge their heavy load,</L>
<L>And Boreas whistles from his bleak abode.</L>
<L>All the tuneful reluctant quit the grove,</L>
<L>And each in search of winter-quarters rove;</L>
<L>Quick to'rds the south to meet the genial ray,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye curling fountains, and harmonious vales,</L>
<L>Fost ring breezes, and aromatic gales,</L>
<L>Verdant lawns, and woodland towering groves,</L>
<L>Tuneful songsters, and all ye grazing droves,</L>
<L>Shepherds and swains, &amp; thou sweet-blooming spring,</L>
<L>Whose cheerful aspect makes all nature sing,</L>
<L>Reluctantly from you my muses part,</L>
<L>To touch a theme less pleasing to the heart,</L>
<L><HI>The roaring peals of War!</HI> Hail, Trenton, hail!</L>
<L>To thee my muse quick-rushes from the vale.</L>
<L>Nor learned halls, nor gentle-gliding stream,</L>
<L>Nor ought but <HI>War,</HI> now swells my roving theme:</L>
<L>Methinks I see illustrious <HI>Washington,</HI></L>
<L>Rous'd by the bloody plain of <HI>Lexington,</HI></L>
<L>Fearless and brave, with martial sounds advance,</L>
<L>While trembling Hessians run, a crazy dance,</L>
<PB N="35" REF="025490_0032_0FCD4869845102D0"/>
<L>To seek for refuge, howling thro' the town,</L>
<L>Closely pursu'd by freemen of renown.</L>
<L>Into steep sellers, ovens, and hogsties,</L>
<L>They headlong tumble, groaning fearful cries.</L>
<L>Meanwhile their drums as timid beat to-arms,</L>
<L>With broken sound; not sound of <HI>War's Alarms.</HI></L>
<L>Now the loud-roaring cannons rend the sky,</L>
<L>'Till bleeding Hessians "QUARTERS!" loudly cry,</L>
<L>And strike the British colours to the ground,</L>
<L>While shrieks of <HI>mercy</HI> echo all around!—</L>
<L>But hark!—brave Washington loudly cries:</L>
<L>"<HI>Spare, spare the sword!</HI> nor slay these Hessian flies;</L>
<L>Only deprive the insects of their stings;</L>
<L>I'll send them where they cannot use their wings."</L>
<L>Thus have nine hundred men, inur'd to arms,</L>
<L>To martial sounds, and roaring wars alarms,</L>
<L>In wild confusion, laid down all their guns,</L>
<L>To Washington and Columbia's darling sons.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'd not pass over his immortal name,</L>
<L>Without attempting for to sing his fame;</L>
<L>But my infant muse, and imperfect lays,</L>
<L>Can ill express the Heroes matchless praise.</L>
<L>Then let some Shakespear strike the founding lyre,</L>
<L>Or some brave Milton, with poetic fire,</L>
<L>And soar aloft with some new strain sublime,</L>
<L>Beyond the reach of each dull-creeping rhyme;</L>
<L>From high Olympus, let the gods descend,</L>
<L>And to this poet their assistance lend;</L>
<PB N="36" REF="025490_0033_0FCD486AF4E1B070"/>
<L>While he, in strains heroic, sings the fame</L>
<L>Of <HI>Washington,</HI> and gilds his noble name.</L>
<L>O, let the sacred nine their aid diffuse,</L>
<L>In strains sublime, t' inspire his chanting muse:</L>
<L>And may his song the sleeping echoes raise,</L>
<L>From their soft slumber to resound his praise;</L>
<L>'Till his glorious theme reaches ev'ry soul,</L>
<L>From the arctic, to the antarctic pole!</L>
<L>But if a genius with such matchless strain,</L>
<L>Cannot be found to sing our hero's fame,</L>
<L>The <HI>Sons of Freedom</HI> will, I hope, excuse</L>
<L>This imperfect strain, from a <HI>willing muse:</HI></L>
<L>Come then, ye sacred nine, inspire my song</L>
<L>With phrase sublime, and gliding numbers strong;</L>
<L>Heroic measure, teach me to command,</L>
<L>And justly praise, the glory of this land,</L>
<L>GEORGE WASHINGTON! who, tho' advanc'd in years,</L>
<L>Disdained subjection to bold British peers;</L>
<L>But, when Columbia loudly call'd him forth,</L>
<L>Display'd at once, his galantry and worth;</L>
<L>Of her land-forces, took the chief command,</L>
<L>And wisely rul'd them with his martial hand;</L>
<L>Check'd England's pride—broke her despotic band—</L>
<L>And gained <HI>Freedom</HI> for his native land !—</L>
<L>O, cou'd I sing, his conduct thro' the whole,</L>
<L>His feeling heart and sympathetic soul;</L>
<L>His love of <HI>Freedom,</HI> and his martial skill;</L>
<L>His pride to conquer, and dislike to kill;</L>
<PB N="37" REF="025490_0034_0FCD486C5C05E788"/>
<L>His perseverance in his country's cause,</L>
<L>To banish tyrants and despotic laws;</L>
<L>And, in a word, his patriotic zeal</L>
<L>For his native land, and the public weal;</L>
<L>My glorious theme should then, on golden wing,</L>
<L>Thro foreign climes, and distant nations ring!</L>
<L>But to do this requires a wiser hand,</L>
<L>And higher strains than I can now command.</L>
<L>O, may no trifling bard, with creeping lays,</L>
<L>Ever attempt to sing his matchless praise;</L>
<L>But may some Milton, full of lyric sound,</L>
<L>Whose matchless strain whole nations will astound,</L>
<L>To sing his praises, speedily be found!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now rural songs invite my roving theme,</L>
<L>To the green margin of yon purling stream,</L>
<L>Where the young student, to unbend his mind,</L>
<L>Leaps lively round, and quaffs the evening wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bright sol was sinking thro' the western grove,</L>
<L>The shepherd homeward singing to his drove,</L>
<L>Bissected Luna (may I use the phrase?)</L>
<L>Was just emerging from the solar rays;</L>
<L>The tuneful songsters all had quit their strain,</L>
<L>When <HI>Daphne</HI> thus to <HI>Strephon</HI> did complain:</L>
<L>"Oh, my Strephon, to you alone I'll tell,</L>
<L>The mournful tale, what late to me befel—</L>
<L>But, do not startle at the tragic sound,</L>
<L>Nor let my tears your manly sense astound—</L>
<PB N="38" REF="025490_0035_0FCD486FB21722A8"/>
<L>Last night as we, well pleas'd, did walk along</L>
<L>This verdant lawn, and sang a mutual soug,</L>
<L>Our voice was heard by some designing clown,</L>
<L>Who, with the news, ran quickly into town;</L>
<L>And told my parents, a malicious tale,</L>
<L>That he had seen us in yon lonesome vale."—</L>
<L>She could no more—her sobbing sighs express'd,</L>
<L>With flowing tears, to Strephon all the rest.</L>
<L>Then fir'd with noble ardour, thus the youth,</L>
<L>With manly voice exclaim'd: "O, sacred truth!</L>
<L>Thou only know'st, how falsely w're accus'd;</L>
<L>And the just Gods how Daphne's been ill-us'd!</L>
<L>But, cease my Daphne, cease to shed those tears;</L>
<L>And know, thy Strephon soon will end thy fears:</L>
<L>Ere to-morrow's sun sinks beneath the plain,</L>
<L>By all the Gods! I'll end a life of pain,</L>
<L>Or he shall die who dar'd defile thy name!"</L>
<L>"Not so my Strephon," Daphne gently cry'd,</L>
<L>"The gods are witness that we are bely'd.—</L>
<L>Why wou'dst thou then venture to end thy days,</L>
<L>To be aveng'd of what a blackguard says?</L>
<L>Our mutual bliss depends not on his fall,</L>
<L>But on ourselves, and the great God of all."—</L>
<L>Thus Daphne spoke t' appease her lovers heart;</L>
<L>And thus again young Strephon did impart:</L>
<L>My life, my Daphne, my all that I prize,</L>
<L>Can, then; thy Strephon stop those heavy sighs?</L>
<L>Say, does our future happiness depend</L>
<L>On nuptial bands which nought but death can rend?</L>
<L>If so, let Hymen, ere th'approach of day,</L>
<PB N="39" REF="025490_0036_0FCD487162AF7888"/>
<L>With torches bright, thro' the high milky-way</L>
<L>Descend, and wave his ever-binding wand</L>
<L>O'er both our heads and tie the nuptial band:</L>
<L>O, speak my Daphne, let me know your mind,</L>
<L>Or if you fault with my proposals find.</L>
<L>The charming Daphne blush'd a silent hint,</L>
<L>Which from the fair sex always means consent.</L>
<L>This happy pair are strangers now to strife,</L>
<L>And bless the day they became man and wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To rural scenes once more I bid adieu,</L>
<L>The southern states and martial plains to view;</L>
<L>And down the Delaware's majestic tide,</L>
<L>With sails all full, harmoniously we ride.</L>
<L>Now round Henlopen with a pleasant gale,</L>
<L>For Carolina, south, we brisky sail;</L>
<L>On Hatteras our bark was nearly stranded,</L>
<L>But scapeing safe in Charleston we landed.</L>
<L>On a peninsula of sandy lands,</L>
<L>Between two rivers, this proud city stands;</L>
<L>Rich in her commerce, prodigal of wealth,</L>
<L>Gay in appearance, but no friend to health.</L>
<L>In summer scorching with the solar rays,</L>
<L>Each blooming beauty rapidly decays;</L>
<L>The sprightly youth and the more active man,</L>
<L>Forget their springs, and court the ladies fan.</L>
<L>And ah, how many in the prime of life,</L>
<L>Are snatch'd from father, brother, sister, wife!</L>
<L>How many orphan children here are left,</L>
<L>By cruel death, of ev'ry friend bereft!—</L>
<PB N="40" REF="025490_0037_0FCD48726DD92EC0"/>
<L>But lo, I see a superstructure rise,</L>
<L>Magnificently grand it meets the skies;</L>
<L>An asylum for the distressed young,</L>
<L>T' improve their minds and cultivate their tongue;</L>
<L>To screen the helpless orphan from all harm,</L>
<L>From summer heat and the cold winter storm.</L>
<L>This pride of Carolina
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Orphan house.</HI></NOTE> will command,</L>
<L>The free donation from the gen'rous hand,</L>
<L>While there's a helpless orphan in the land.</L>
<L>This sickly clime (if I may speak the truth)</L>
<L>Can scarcely rear a likely, active youth;</L>
<L>And if you travel Carolina round,</L>
<L>Where wealth and luxury so much abound,</L>
<L>A rosy cheek is scarcely to be found!</L>
<L>But yet the fair possess those other charms,</L>
<L>Which please the lover and his bosom warms;</L>
<L>A graceful marriage and genteel attire;</L>
<L>A modest mien that sets his soul on fire;</L>
<L>Accomplish'd manners and education,</L>
<L>With th' art of pleasing in conversation;</L>
<L>They feel compassion for a lovers flame;</L>
<L>But <HI>int'rest—int'rest,</HI> is their ruling aim!</L>

<L>Speak ye adepts in knowledge,</L>
<L>Say, whence these roving thoughts</L>
<L>Which waft the mind to distant climes,</L>
<L>New regions to explore?</L>
<L>Whence this thirst for knowledge,</L>
<L>Which, after traversing this flying ball,</L>
<L>Springs aloft, circles round the sun,</L>
<L>Views all the planets in their airy course,</L>
<L>And marks their revolutions?</L>
<L>Then traces comets in their full career,</L>
<L>Thro' frigid regions so remote,</L>
<L>That our blazing sun,</L>
<L>Viewed thence thro' optic tube,</L>
<L>Would twinkle as a star!</L>
<L>While musing thus I write,</L>
<L>The muses waft me from those earthly climes,</L>
<L>Space immense t'explore.</L>
<L>Aloft I soar with more than eagle-speed,</L>
<L>Laboring thro' the blue abyss,</L>
<L>Till the terraqueous globe,</L>
<L>Like Luna bright,</L>

<L>Farther still,</L>

<L>Stops my bold career;—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark!—Hark!—</L>
<L>Methinks a voice than human more,</L>
<L>From God's celestial throne,</L>

<L>Thus imagination on her airy wing,</L>

<L>In admiration lost,</L>
<L>Nor can I trace th' eternal cause,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say then ye wiser heads,</L>
<L>Why does the human mind aspire to know,</L>
<L>Things beyond her sphere,</L>
<L>The greatness, essence, and primeval state</L>
<L>Of the stupendous whole?</L>
<L>If nought immortald welt within my frame,</L>
<L>I, like the brute creation, then could <HI>rest,</HI></L>
<L>When the calls of nature were supply'd.</L>
<L>But <HI>this</HI> I cannot do; and hence conclude,</L>
<L><HI>Something immortal</HI> in me dwells,</L>
<L>Which thus aspires to view the perfect whole!</L>
<L>But what this <HI>something</HI> is, he only knows</L>
<L>Whose works no thought can bound;</L>
<L>Whose beginning we cannot trace;</L>
<L>Whose immensity we can't conceive;</L>
<L>Who rules the amazing whole;</L>
<L>Who sits on heaven's high throne,</L>
<L>Jehovah, Jove and Lord,</L>
<L>Eternal, and alone!</L>
