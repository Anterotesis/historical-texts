<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"AS the people of England cannot be bound by any law, without the consent of their representatives first had in parliament; so neither can any En∣glishman suffer in his person, or estate, for the breach of any laws, or for any real, or pretended crime, without the consent of the people first had by a jury of his peers, or equals:" therefore,</P>
<P>It can never be unseasonable to in∣form, or to remind. Jurors of their duty; because they are the persons, on whom the property, the liberty, and the lives of their fellow-subjects de∣pend. When questions, however, which relate to the national liberty of the people, are agitated in the courts of justice; it becomes of the utmost con∣sequence, that those who serve upon Juries should be acquainted with their <HI>duties.</HI> For, if Juries are destitute of the instructions necessary upon these
<PB N="vi" REF="012414_0004_0F8997AAD29EF7C0"/>occasions, we must not expect that they will exert themselves with spirit: while they remain ignorant of the nature of their station, it is impossible that they should feel its impor∣tance.</P>
<P>Men of great eminence in the law have publicly declared, that encroach∣ments have lately been made upon the <HI>rights</HI> of Juries. To enquire into the truth of this charge is of the utmost consequence, not only to Jurors, but to the whole body of the people; as there is no man who may not, directly, or indirectly, be affected by these invasions. Indeed, the good intentions and dispo∣sitions of Jurymen will avail little to the security of the nation, if they are <HI>fraudulently,</HI> or <HI>forcibly,</HI> prevented from discharging the <HI>duties</HI> of their <HI>office.</HI></P>
<P>A knowledge, therefore, of whatever relates to the office of Juries, seems at this time essentially necessary; since from hence alone can arise the proper <HI>execution</HI> of its <HI>duties,</HI> and the <HI>preserva∣tion</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="012414_0004_0F8997AAD29EF7C0"/>of its <HI>rights.</HI>—To promote these purposes, the following little pamphlet is now republished. Its character for perspicuity, and strength of reasoning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so well established, that it is unneces∣sary to enlarge upon it here. If it meets with the success which its merit deserves, it will perhaps be a principal means of preserving the <HI>trial</HI> by <HI>Jury,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its full force, to posterity.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS treatise has passed through many editions. It appeared first in the year 1680; it was reprinted in the year 1731, &amp; again in 1763, 1764, 1770 and 1771; and is now presented to the public at least for the seventh time.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Many circumstances might lead the reader to suspect, that this Di∣alogue has been altered in order to ac∣commodate it to the present times. This edition, however, has been care∣fully collated with the <HI>first,</HI> which was printed in London for Richard Janeway, in Queen's Head Alley, Pater-noster-Row, in the year 1680: and so scru∣pulously has the Original been adhered to, that not a single word has been al∣tered, except in the translation of the Latin sentences in page 3, the latter of which was before unintelligible. Li∣berties, indeed, have been taken with the orthography, and pointing; but these have not in the least affected the sense.</P>

<HEAD>THE ENGLISHMAN's RIGHT.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barrister.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY old <HI>Client!</HI> a good morning to you: whither so fast? you seem intent upon some important affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worthy Sir! I am glad to see you thus <HI>opportunely,</HI> there being scarce any person that I could at this time rather have wished to meet with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall esteem myself happy, if in any thing I can serve you.—The <HI>business,</HI> I pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am summoned to appear <HI>upon a Jury,</HI> and was just going to try if I could get off. Now I doubt not but you can put me into the best way to obtain that favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is probable I could: but first let me know the <HI>reasons</HI> why you desire to <HI>decline that service.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, there is something of <HI>trouble</HI> and <HI>loss of time</HI> in it; and men's <HI>lives, li∣berties,</HI> and <HI>estates</HI> (which depend upon a jury's <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> for the plaintiff, or for the defendant) are <HI>weighty things.</HI> I would not wrong my conscience for a world, nor be accessary to any man's ruin. There are others <HI>better skilled</HI> in such matters. I have ever so loved <HI>peace,</HI> that I have forborne going to <HI>law,</HI> (as you well know many times) though it hath been much to my loss.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I commend your <HI>tenderness</HI> and <HI>modesty;</HI> yet must tell you, these are but general and <HI>weak</HI> excuses.</P>
<P>As for your time and trouble, it is not <HI>much;</HI> and however, can it be better spent than in doing <HI>justice,</HI> and serving your country? to withdraw yourself in such cases, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a kind of <HI>Sacrilege,</HI> a rob∣bing of the public of those duties which you justly owe it; the more <HI>peaceable man</HI> you have been, the <HI>more fit</HI> you are. For the office of a <HI>Juryman</HI> is, <HI>conscientiously to judge his neighbour;</HI> and needs no more <HI>law</HI> than is easily learnt to direct him therein. I look upon you therefore as a man well qualified with <HI>estate, discretion, &amp; integrity;</HI> and if all such as you should use private means to avoid it, how would the king and country be honestly served? At that rate we should have none but <HI>fools</HI> or <HI>knaves</HI> entrusted in this grand concern, on which (as you well observe) the lives, liberties, and estates of all <HI>England</HI> depend.</P>
<P>Your <HI>tenderness</HI> not to be accessary to any man's being wronged or ruined, is (as I said) much to be commended. But may you not incur it unawares, by seeking thus to avoid it? <HI>Pilate</HI> was not inno∣cent because he washed his hands, and said, <HI>He would have nothing to do with the blood of that just one.</HI> There are faults of <HI>omission</HI> as well as <HI>com∣mission.</HI> When you are <HI>legally called</HI> to try such a cause, if you shall <HI>shuffle</HI> out yourself, and thereby persons perhaps <HI>less conscientious</HI> happen to be made use of, and so a <HI>villain</HI> escapes justice, or an <HI>innocent</HI> man is ruined, by a <HI>prepossessed</HI> or <HI>negli∣gent</HI> verdict; can you think yourself in such a case wholly blameless? <HI>Qui non prohibet cum po∣test, jubet: That man abets an evil, who prevents it not, when it is in his power. Nec caret scrupu∣lo societatis occulta qui evidentèr sacinori desinit
<PB N="11" REF="012414_0007_0F8997ADB714E420"/>obviare: Nor can he escape the suspicion of being a secret accomplice, who evidently declines the pre∣vention of an atrocious crime.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I think a man is bound to <HI>do all the good</HI> he can, especially when he is lawfully called to it. But there sometimes happen <HI>nice cases,</HI> wherein it may be difficult to discharge one's conscience without incurring the <HI>displeasure</HI> of the court, and thence <HI>trouble</HI> and <HI>damage</HI> may arise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is but a <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>needless</HI> fear. For as the jurors <HI>privileges</HI> (and every <HI>Englishman</HI>'s in and by them) are very considerable; so the laws have no less providently <HI>guarded</HI> them against invasion or usurpation. So that there needs no more than, first, <HI>understanding</HI> to know your duty; and, in the next place, <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>resolution</HI> to practise it with impartiality &amp; integrity, free from accursed <HI>bribery</HI> and malice, or (what is full as bad in the end) base and servile <HI>fear.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied, that as it is for the <HI>ad∣vantage</HI> and honour of the public, that men of <HI>understanding, substance</HI> and <HI>honesty,</HI> should be em∣ployed to serve on juries, that <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>right</HI> may fairly be administered; so it is <HI>their own</HI> in∣terest, when called thereunto, readily to bestow their attendance and service, to prevent <HI>ill prece∣dents</HI> from men otherwise qualified; which may by degrees <HI>fatally,</HI> though insensibly, undermine our just birth-rights, and perhaps <HI>fall heavy</HI> one day upon us, or our posterity. But, for my own part, I am fearful lest I should suffer through my <HI>ig∣norance</HI> of the duty and office of a juryman; and, therefore, on that account principally it is, that I desire to be excused in my appearance; which if I understood but so well as I hope many others do, I would with all my heart attend the service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="012414_0008_0F8997AE724D3A50"/>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak honestly, and like an <HI>English∣man.</HI> But if that be all your cause of scruple, it may soon be removed, if you will but give your∣self a very <HI>little trouble</HI> of enquiry into the neces∣sary provisions of the law of <HI>England</HI> relating to this matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing (of a <HI>temporal</HI> con∣cern) that I would more gladly be informed in; because I am satisfied, it is very <HI>expedient</HI> to be generally known. And first, I would learn <HI>how long</HI> trials by juries have been used in this na∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even <HI>time out of mind;</HI> so long, that our best <HI>historians</HI> cannot date the original of the institution, being indeed <HI>cotemporary</HI> with the na∣tion itself, or in use as soon as the people were re∣duced to any form of <HI>civil government,</HI> and ad∣ministration of justice. Nor have the several con∣quests or revolutions, the mixtures of <HI>foreigners,</HI> or the mutual feuds of the <HI>natives,</HI> at any time, been able to suppress or overthrow it. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. That juries (the <HI>thing</HI> in effect and <HI>sub∣stance,</HI> tho' perhaps not just the number of <HI>twelve</HI> men) were in use among the <HI>Britons,</HI> the first in∣habitants of this island, appears by the ancient monuments and writings of that nation, attesting that their <HI>Freeholders</HI> had always a <HI>share</HI> in all trials and determinations of differences.</P>
<P N="2">2. Most certain it is, that they were practised by the <HI>Saxons</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lamb. p.</HI> 218. <HI>Coke,</HI> 1 <HI>part,</HI> Institutes, <HI>fol.</HI> 155.</NOTE>, and were then the <HI>only courts,</HI> or at least an essential, and the greater part of all courts of judicature: for so (to omit a multitude of other iustances) we find in king <HI>Ethelr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI>'s Laws, <HI>In sin∣gulis Centuriis, &amp;c. In every Hundred let there be a court, and let twelve ancient freemen, together with the Lord, or rather, according to the</HI> Saxon,
<PB N="13" REF="012414_0009_0F8997AF32613F50"/><HI>the Greve,</HI> i. e. <HI>the chief officer amongst them, be sworn, That they will not condemn any person that is innocent, nor acquit any one that is guilty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. When the <HI>Normans</HI> came in, <HI>William,</HI> tho' commonly called the <HI>Conquerer,</HI> was so far from ab∣rogating this privilege of Juries
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Spelman</HI>'s Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssar. in the Word <HI>Jurata.</HI></NOTE>, that in the fourth year of his reign, <HI>he confirmed all king</HI> Ed∣ward <HI>the Confessor's laws, and the ancient customs of the kingdom,</HI> whereof this was an essential and most material part. Nay, he made use <HI>of a Jury chosen in every county, to report and certify on their oaths what those laws and customs were;</HI> as ap∣pears in the <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oem</HI> of such his confirmation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Afterwards when the <HI>Great Charter,</HI> com∣monly called <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> (which is nothing else than a recital, confirmation, and corroboration of our ancient <HI>English</HI> liberties) was made and put under the great seal of <HI>England,</HI> in the ninth year of king Henry the Third, (which was <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1225.) then was this privilege of trials by Juries in an especial manner confirmed and esta∣blished; as in the fourteenth chapter, <HI>That no amercements shall be assessed, but by the oath of good and honest men of the vicinage.</HI> And more fully in that golden nine-and-twentieth chapter—<HI>No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, nor be disseised of his freehold or liberties, or free customs, or be out lawed, or exiled, or any other way destroyed, nor shall we pass upon him, or condemn him, but by the lawful judgment of his peers,</HI> &amp;c Which Grand Charter having been confirmed by above thirty acts of parliament, the said right of Juries thereby, and by constant usage, and common custom of England, which is the common-law, is brought down to us as our undoubted birth-right, and the best inheritance of every <HI>Englishman.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="012414_0010_0F8997AFF3336FE8"/>For as that famous lawyer, chief justice <HI>Coke</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>fol.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE>, in the words of <HI>Cicero,</HI> excellently avers, <HI>Major H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reditas venit unicuique nostrum a jure &amp; legi∣bus quam a parentibus:</HI> It is <HI>a greater inheritance, and more to be valued, which we derive from the fundamental constitution and laws of our country, than that which comes to us from our respective pa∣rents.</HI> For without the <HI>former,</HI> we have no claim to the <HI>latter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>But has this method of trial never been attempted to be invaded or justled out of practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but rarely that any have arrived to so great a confidence: <HI>For it is a most dangerous thing to shake, or alter, any of the rules, or funda∣mental points, of the common law, which in truth are the main pillars, and supporters of the fabric of the commonwealth:</HI> these are judge <HI>Coke's</HI> words
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Instit. <HI>p.</HI> 74.</NOTE>. Yet sometimes it has been endeavoured: but so sacred and valuable was the institution in the eyes of our ancestors, and so tenacious were they of their privileges, and zealous to maintain, and pre∣serve such a <HI>vital part</HI> of their birth right and freedom; that no such attempts could ever prove effectual, but always ended with the shame and se∣vere punishment of the rash undertakers. For example.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Andrew Horn,</HI> an eminent lawyer, in his book, entitled, <HI>the Mirrour of Justices,</HI> (written in the reign of king <HI>Edward</HI> I. now near 400 years ago) in the fifth chapter, and first section, records, That the renowned <HI>Saxon</HI> king <HI>Alfred</HI> caused <HI>four-and forty justices</HI> to be <HI>hanged</HI> in one year, as <HI>murther∣ers</HI> for their <HI>false judgments.</HI> And there recites their particular crimes, most of them being in one kind or other infringements, violations, &amp; encroachments of
<PB N="15" REF="012414_0011_0F8997B0B0CA8A20"/>and upon the rights &amp; privileges of Juries. Amongst the rest, that worthy author tells us, he <HI>hanged one justice</HI> Cadwine, <HI>because he judged one</HI> Hackwy <HI>to death without the consent of all the Jurors; for whereas he stood upon his Jury of twelve men, because three of them would have saved him, this</HI> Cadwine <HI>removed those three, and put others in their room on the Jury, against the said</HI> Hackwy's <HI>consent.</HI> Where we may observe, that though at last twelve men did give a verdict against him, yet those, so put upon him, were not accounted <HI>his Jurors;</HI> by reason all, or any of them, who were first sworn to try him, could not (by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw</HI>) by removed, and others put in their stead: And that such <HI>illegal</HI> alteration was then adjudged a <HI>capit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> crime, and forthwith the said <HI>Cadwine</HI> was <HI>hanged.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A second instance I shall give you in the words of the lord chief justice <HI>Coke</HI>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Coke,</HI> 2 <HI>part</HI> of Inst. <HI>fol.</HI> 51.</NOTE>: <Q>Against this ancient and <HI>fundamental law</HI> (and in the face thereof) there was in the eleventh year of king <HI>Henry</HI> VII. cap. 3. an act of Parliament ob∣tained (on fair pretences, &amp; a specious preamble, as to avoid divers mischiefs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>)</Q> whereby it was ordained, <HI>That from thenceforth, as well justices of assize, as justices of the peace, upon a bare informa∣tion for the king before them made, without any finding or presentment by the verdict of twelve men, should have full power and authority by their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣cretion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to hear and determine all offences and contempts committed or done by any person or per∣sons against the form, ordinance, or effect of any statute made and not repealed,</HI> &amp;c. <Q>By colour of which act (saith <HI>Coke</HI>) shaking this fundamental law (<HI>he means, touching all trials to be by</HI> Juries) it is not credible what HORRIBLE OP∣PRESSIONS and EXACTIONS, to the undoing
<PB N="16" REF="012414_0012_0F8997B1768BB308"/>of MULTITUDES of people, were committed by Sir <HI>Richard Empson</HI> knight, and <HI>Edmund Dudley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> (being justices of the peace) throughout <HI>England;</HI> and upon this unjust and injurious act (as commonly in like cases it falleth out) a <HI>new office</HI> was erected, and they made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sters of the king's forfeitures.</Q></P>
<P>But not only this statute was justly, soon after the decease of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. <HI>repealed</HI> by the stat, of the 1 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. but also the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid <HI>Emp∣son</HI> and <HI>Dud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey</HI> (notwithstanding they had such an <HI>act</HI> to back them, yet it being against <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and consequently <HI>void</HI>) were fairly <HI>executed</HI> for their pains; and several of their under-agents, as <HI>promoters, informers,</HI> and the like, severely <HI>pu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished,</HI> for a warning to all others that shall dare (on any pretence whatsoever) infringe our <HI>English</HI> liberties

<P>This question shews you have not been much conversant <HI>abroad,</HI> to observe the <HI>miserable</HI> condition of the poor people in most <HI>other nations,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="012414_0013_0F8997B231239700"/>where they are either <HI>wholly subject</HI> to the <HI>despotic arbitrary</HI> lust of their rulers; or at best under such laws as render their lives, liberties, and estates, li∣able to be disposed of at the <HI>discretion</HI> of strangers appointed their judges; most times <HI>mercenary</HI> and creatures of prerogative; sometimes <HI>malicious</HI> and oppressive; and often <HI>partial</HI> and corrupt

<P>Yes, certainly; though I never so well considered them before.

<P N="1">1.

And therefore the witnesses are always ordered to <HI>direct their speech to the jury,</HI> they being the proper judges of their testimony. And in all pleas of the crown (or matters criminal) the prisoner is said <HI>to put him∣self for trial upon his country,</HI> which is explained and referred by the clerk of the court, to be meant of the jury, saying to them, <HI>Which country you are.</HI></P>

<P>Well then, what is the part of the king's <HI>justices,</HI> or the court? what are they to take cognizance of, or do, in the trials of mens lives, liberties, and properties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their office, in general, is to do <HI>equal justice</HI> and right: particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. To see that the jury be regularly <HI>returned</HI> and duly <HI>sworn.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To see that the prisoner (in cases where it is permitable) be allowed his lawful <HI>challenges.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To advise by law, whether such matter may be given in evidence, or not, such a writing read, or not, or such a man admitted to be a witness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Because by their <HI>learning,</HI> and experience, they are presumed, to be best qualified, to ask per∣tinent questions, and, in the most perspicuous man∣ner, soonest to sift out truth from amongst tedious impertinent circumstances and tautologies: they therefore commonly <HI>examine the witnesses in the court,</HI> yet not <HI>excluding the jury,</HI> who of right <HI>may,</HI> and where they see cause, <HI>ought</HI> to ask them any necessary questions; which undoubtedly they may lawfully do with modesty and discretion, with∣out <HI>begging any leave.</HI> For if asking leave be ne∣cessary, it implies in the court a right when they list to <HI>deny</HI> it; and how then shall the jury know the truth? And since we see, that council, who too often <HI>(—Pudet haec opprobria nobis)</HI> for their <HI>sees</HI> strive only to baffle witnesses, and stif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e truth,
<PB N="20" REF="012414_0016_0F8997B530E0D140"/>take upon them daily to <HI>interrogate</HI> the evidence; it is absurd to think that the Jurors should not have the <HI>same privilege,</HI> who are upon their <HI>oaths,</HI> and <HI>proper judges</HI> of the matter.</P>
<P N="5">5. As a discreet and <HI>lawful Assistant</HI> to the Jury,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghan</HI>'s Reports in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ushell</HI>'s cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>fol.</HI> 144.</NOTE> they do often recapitulate and sum up the heads of the evidence; but the Jurors are still to consider whether it be done <HI>truly, fully</HI> and <HI>impar∣tially,</HI> (for one man's <HI>memory</HI> may sooner fail than <HI>twelve's.</HI>) He may likewise state the law to them, that is, deliver his <HI>opinion</HI> where the case is difficult, or they <HI>desire</HI> it. But since, <HI>ex facto jus oritur,</HI> all matter of law arises out of matter of fact, so that till the fact is <HI>settled</HI> there is no room for law: therefore all such <HI>discourses</HI> of a judge to a Jury are, or ought to be, <HI>hypothetical,</HI> not <HI>coercive;</HI> conditional, and not <HI>positive:</HI> viz. <HI>If you find the fact thus or thus,</HI> still leaving the Jury at liberty to find as they see cause) <HI>then you are to find for the plaintiff. But if you find the fact thus, or thus, then you are to find for the defendant,</HI> or the like, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>not Guilty,</HI> in cases criminal.</P>
<P>Lastly, they are to <HI>take the verdict</HI> of the Jury, and thereupon to give <HI>judgment</HI> according to law. For the office of a judge (as <HI>Coke</HI> well observes) is <HI>jus dicerè</HI> not <HI>jus dare;</HI> not to make any laws by strains of wit, or forced interpretations; but plain∣ly, and impartially to declare the law already esta∣lished. Nor can they refuse to accept the Jury's verdict when agreed: for if they should and force the Jury to return, and any of them should mis∣carry for want of accommodation, it would un∣doubtedly be murther; and in such case the Jury may, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout crime, force their liberty, because they are illegatly confined, having given in their verdict, and thereby honestly discharged their of∣fice,

<P>But I have been told, that a Jury is only judge of naked <HI>matter of fact,</HI> and are not at all to take upon them to <HI>meddle with,</HI> or regard, <HI>matter of law,</HI> but leave it wholly to the court.</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>'Tis most true, Jurors are</HI> judges <HI>of mat∣ters of fact: that is their</HI> proper province, <HI>their chief business; but yet not</HI> excluding <HI>the considera∣tion of matter of law, as it</HI> arises <HI>out of, or is</HI> com∣plicated <HI>with, and</HI> influences <HI>the fact.</HI> For to say, they are not at all to meddle with, or have respect to, law in giving their verdicts, is not only a <HI>false</HI> po∣sition, and contradicted by every day's <HI>experience;</HI> but also a very <HI>dangerous and pernicious</HI> one; tending to defeat the principal end of the institu∣tion of Juries, and so subtilly to <HI>undermine</HI> that which was <HI>too strong</HI> to be <HI>battered down.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is false:</HI> For, though the direction, as to matter of law separately, may belong to the judge, and the finding the matter of fact does, peculiarly, belong to the Jury; <HI>yet must your Jury also</HI> ap∣ply matter of fact and law together; <HI>and from their consideration of, and a right judgment</HI> upon both, <HI>bring forth their verdict:</HI> For do we not see in most general issues, as upon <HI>not guilty</HI>— pleaded in <HI>trespass,</HI> breach of the peace, or <HI>felony,</HI> though it be matter <HI>in law</HI> whether the party be a <HI>trespasser,</HI> a breaker of the peace, or a <HI>felon;</HI> yet the Jury do not find the <HI>fact</HI> of the case by it∣self, leaving the law to the court; but find the party <HI>guilty,</HI> or <HI>not guilty,</HI> generally? So as, though they answer not to the question singly, <HI>what is law?</HI> yet they determine the law, in all matters, where issue is joined. So likewise is it not every day's practice, that when persons are indicted for <HI>murther,</HI> the Jury not only find them <HI>guilty,</HI> or <HI>not guilty;</HI> but many times, upon hearing, and
<PB N="22" REF="012414_0018_0F8997B6B0EF5030"/>weighing of circumstances, bring them in either <HI>guilty</HI> of <HI>murther, manslaughter, per infortunium,</HI> or <HI>se defenderdo,</HI> as they see cause? Now do they not, herein, <HI>complicately resolve,</HI> both law &amp; fact? And to what end is it, that when any person is prosecuted upon any <HI>statute,</HI> the statute itself is usually read to the Jurors, but only that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>may judge,</HI> whether, or no, the matter be within that statute? But to put the business out of doubt, we have the <HI>suffrage</HI> of that oracle of law, <HI>Littleton,</HI> who in his <HI>Tenures,</HI> Sect. 368. declares, <HI>That if a Jury will take upon them the knowledge of the law upon the matter, they may.</HI> Which is agreed to likewise by <HI>Coke</HI> in his comment thereupon
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An able writer of our own times, before the present disputes arose, considers this, as a settled and allowed rule. See Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. III. p. 377.378. particularly vol. IV. p. 364. 355. 4th ed.</NOTE>. And therefore it is <HI>false</HI> to say that the Jury hath not power, or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h not use frequently to apply the fact to the law; and thence taking their <HI>measures,</HI> judge of, and determine, the <HI>crime,</HI> or <HI>issue,</HI> by their verdict
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Not only the <HI>express assertion</HI> of lawyers—and the <HI>practice of the courts,</HI> prove, that Juries are authorized to determine the law, so far as it relates to the fact; but, in the third place, the <HI>words,</HI> in which verdicts must be given, indicate, that they have this power. If Juries had been appointed to judge of facts only, the words '<HI>done,</HI>' or '<HI>not done,</HI>' or words of a like import, would have been substituted for the words '<HI>guilty,</HI>' or 'not <HI>guilty.</HI>' However, as our ancestors have placed it in their option to determine the law, so far as it is connected with the fact, the language of their verdicts comprehends, when <HI>necessary,</HI> their sentiments upon both.

<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="012414_0019_0F8997B773FD3828"/>
2. <HI>As Juries have ever been</HI> vested <HI>with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> power <HI>by law, so, to exclude them from, or</HI> disseise <HI>them of the same, were utterly to</HI> defeat the end of their institution
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>From the doctrine, that Juries, in the case of libels, are not judges of law, as well as fact, necessarily flows the following absurdity, viz. that it is the duty of Juries to declare men <HI>guilty,</HI> or <HI>not guilty,</HI> in whom they per∣ceive neither <HI>guilt,</HI> or <HI>innocence.</HI> Again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> If because a circumstance is established as a <HI>fact,</HI> it is to be reputed as a <HI>crime,</HI> every incident which happens, is a crime.

<P>It is hard to say, on what principles this right of Juries can be disputed.

And, though we apprehend not, that du∣ring the reign of his majesty that now is, <HI>(whose life God long preserve)</HI> any Judges will be made, that would so <HI>wrest the law;</HI> yet what security is there, but that some <HI>successors</HI> may not be so cau∣tious in their choice? and, though our <HI>benches</HI> of judicature be at present furnished with gentlemen of great integrity, yet, there may one day happen some <HI>Tresilian,</HI> or kinsman of <HI>Empson</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to get in, (for what <HI>has been</HI> may be) who, <HI>Empson</HI> like, too, shall pretend it to be for his master's service to in∣crease the number of criminals, that his coffers may be <HI>filled</HI> with <HI>fines</HI> &amp; <HI>forfeitures:</HI> and then such mischiefs may arise. <HI>And Juries, having
<PB N="28" REF="012414_0024_0F8997BC11E187A8"/>upon confidence parted with their just privileges, shall</HI> then, too late, <HI>strive to re-assume them, when the number of ill precedents shall be vouched to in∣force that as of</HI> right, <HI>which in truth was at first a</HI> wrong, <HI>grounded on</HI> easiness <HI>and</HI> ignorance.

<P>Yet still I have heard, that in every indictment, or information, there is always some∣thing of <HI>form,</HI> or law, and, something else, of <HI>fact;</HI> and it seems reasonable, that the Jury should not be bound up <HI>nicely</HI> to find <HI>every formality</HI> therein expressed, or else to acquit (perhaps) a notorious criminal. But if they find the <HI>essential matter</HI> of the crime, then they ought to find him guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say <HI>true,</HI> and therefore must note, that there is a <HI>wide difference</HI> to be made between <HI>words of course,</HI> raised by implication of law, and <HI>essential words,</HI> that either <HI>make,</HI> or really <HI>aggra∣vate,</HI> the crime charged. The law does suppose and imply every trespass, breach of the peace, every felony, murder, or treason, to be done VI∣IT ARMIS, with force, and arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, if a person be indicted for murder by <HI>poison,</HI> and the matter proved, God forbid the jury should scruple the finding him <HI>guilty</HI> upon the indictment; mere∣ly because they do not find that part of it, as to <HI>force, and arms,</HI> proved! For that is implied as a necessary, or allowable, <HI>fiction</HI> of law.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="012414_0025_0F8997BD15D90C50"/>
But on the other side, when the matter in issue in itself, and taken as a naked proposition, is of such a nature, as no action, indictment, or <HI>infor∣mation</HI> will lie for it <HI>singly,</HI> but it is <HI>worked up</HI> by special aggravations into matter of <HI>damage,</HI> or <HI>cime;</HI> as that it was done to <HI>scandalize the govern∣ment,</HI> to <HI>raise sedition,</HI> to <HI>affront authority,</HI> or the like, or with such, or such, an <HI>evil intent:</HI> If these aggravations, or some <HI>overt</HI> act to manifest such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll design, or intention, be not made out by <HI>evidence,</HI> then ought the Jury to find the party, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> For example:</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Latimer</HI> (afterwards a <HI>martyr</HI> in bloody queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s days, for the <HI>Protestant</HI> religion) in his sermon preached before the most excellent king <HI>Edward</HI> VI. delivered these words: <Q>I must de∣sire your grace to hear poor mens suits yourself. The saying is now, That money is heard every where: If he be rich, he shall soon have an end of his matter; others are fain to go home with weeping tears for any help they can obtain at any judge's hand. Hear men's suits yourself, I require you in God's behalf, and put them not to the hearing of these velvet-coats, these up∣skips. Amongst all others, one especially moved me at this time to speak: This it is, Sir: A gentlewoman came and told me, that a great man keepeth certain lands of hers from her, and will be her tenant in spite of her teeth. And that in a whole twelvemonth she could not get but one day for the hearing of her matter, and the same day, when it should be heard, the great man brought on his side a great sight of law∣yers for his council; the gentlewoman had but one man of law, and the great man shakes him so, that he cannot tell what to do. So that when the matter came to the point, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dge
<PB N="30" REF="012414_0026_0F8997BD71834EE8"/>was a means to the gentlewoman, that she should let the great man have a quietness in her land.—I beseech your grace, that ye would look to these matters. And you proud judges! hearken what God saith in his holy book; <HI>Audite illos, ita parvum, ut magnum,</HI> Hear them (saith he) the small as well as the great; the poor as well as the rich; regard no person, fear no man. And why? <HI>Quia Domi∣ni judicium est,</HI> The judgment is God's. Mark this saying, thou proud judge; the devil will bring this sentence against thee at the day of doom. Hell will be full of these judges, if they repent not, and amend: they are worse than the wicked judge that Christ speaketh of, <HI>Luke</HI> the 19th, that neither feared God nor the world. Our judges are worse than this judge was; for they will neither hear men for God's sake, nor fear of the world, nor importunate∣ness, nor any thing else; yea, some of them will command them to
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prison.</NOTE> ward if they be im∣portunate. I heard say, that when a suitor came to one of them, he said, What fellow is it that giveth these folks countel to be so importu∣nate? He deserves to be punished, and commit∣ted toward. Marry, Sir, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nish me then; it is even I that gave them counsel; I would gladly be punished in such a cause; and if you amend not, I will cause them to cry out upon you still; even as long as I live.</Q>—These are the very words of that good bishop, and martyr, father <HI>La∣timer:</HI> <Q>But now-a-days the judges be afraid to hear a poor man against the rich; insomuch, they will either pronounce against him, or so drive off the poor man's suit, that he shall not be able to go through with it

<P>Only this;—Suppose the judges of those times, thinking themselves aggrieved by such his <HI>freedom,</HI> should have brought an <HI>indictment</HI> against him, setting forth, <HI>that falsly, and malici∣ous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, intending to scandalize the government, and the administration of justice, in this realm, and to bring the same into contempt, he did speak, publish, and declare the false, and scandalous, words be∣fore recited.</HI></P>

<P>That is nothing to the purpose; but sup∣pose, I say, by them, or any body else, it had been <HI>done,</HI> and his <HI>speaking the words had been proved,</HI> and you had then been living, and one of the Jury?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have pronounced him <HI>Not Guil∣ty,</HI> and been <HI>starved</HI> to death before I would have consented to a contrary verdict; because the words in themselves are not <HI>criminal,</HI> nor reflecting upon any particulars; and as for what is supposed to be laid in the indictment, or information, (that they were published, or spoken, to <HI>scandalize the government, and the administration of justice, or to bring the same into contempt</HI>) nothing of that ap∣pears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You resolve, as every honest, understand∣ing, conscientious man, would do in the like case; for when a man is prosecuted for that, which, in itself, is <HI>no crime,</HI> how dreadfully soever it may be set out, as the inquisitors in <HI>Spain</HI> use to clothe innocent Protestants, whom they consing to the flames with <HI>Sambenito</HI>'s, garments all over bepaint∣est with <HI>Devils,</HI> that the people beholding them in so hellish a dress, may be so far from pitying them, that they may rather condemn them in their
<PB N="32" REF="012414_0028_0F8997BEF625C548"/>thoughts as <HI>miscreants</HI> not worthy to live, though in truth they know nothing of their cause;—yet I say, notwithstanding any such <HI>bugbear artifices,</HI> an innocent man ought to be acquitted, and not he and all his family ruined, and perhaps utterly undone, for <HI>words,</HI> or <HI>matters,</HI> harmless in them∣selves, and possibly very well intended, but only rendered <HI>criminal,</HI> by being thus hideously dressed up, and wrested with some far-fetched, forced, and odious construction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a matter well worthy the con∣sideration of all Juries; for indeed I have often wondered to observe the <HI>adverbs</HI> in declarations, indictments, and informations, in some cases to be harmless <HI>vinegar and pepper,</HI> and in others, <HI>henbane steeped in aqua fortis.</HI></P>

<P>That may easily happen, where the Jury does not <HI>distinguish</HI> legal implications, from such as constitute, or materially <HI>aggravate,</HI> the crime: for if the Jury shall honestly refuse to find the <HI>latter</HI> in cases where there is not direct proof of them, (<HI>viz.</HI> That such an act was done <HI>falsly, scandalously, maliciously,</HI> with an intent to <HI>raise se∣dition, defame the government,</HI> or the like,) their mouths are not to be stopt, nor their consciences satisfied with the court's telling them—<HI>You have nothing to do with that; it is only matter of form or matter of law: you are only to examine the fact, whether he spoke such words, wrote, or sold such a book, or the like</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, forsooth! that's the Jurymens <HI>common plea;</HI> but do you think it will hold good in the court of Heaven? 'Tis not enough that we <HI>mean no harm,</HI> but we must <HI>do none neither,</HI> especi∣ally in things of that moment; nor will <HI>igno∣rance</HI> excuse, where it is <HI>affected,</HI> and where duty obliges us to <HI>inform</HI> ourselves better, and where the matter is so <HI>plain</HI> and easy to be understood.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>judges,</HI> they have a fairer plea than you, and may quickly return the <HI>burthen</HI> back upon the Jurors: For <HI>we,</HI> may they say, <HI>did nothing but our duty, according to usual practice: the Jury, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eers, had found the fellow guilty upon their oaths, of such an odious crime, and attended with such vile presumptions, and dangerous circumstances. They are judges; we took him as they presented him to us; and according to our duty pronounced the sen∣tence, that the law inflicts in such cases, or set a fine, or ordered corporeal punishment upon him, which was very moderate, considering the crime laid in the indictment, or information, and of which they had so sworn him guilty. If he were innocent, or not so bad as represented, let his destruction lie upon the Jury,</HI> &amp;c. At this rate, if ever we should have an <HI>unconscionable judge,</HI> might he argue; and thus the guilt of the <HI>blood,</HI> or <HI>ruin,</HI> of an innocent man, when it is too late, shall be <HI>bandied</HI> to and fro, and <HI>shuffled off</HI> from the Jury to the Judge, and from the Judge to the Jury; but really <HI>sticks fast to both,</HI> but especially <HI>on the Jurors;</HI> because the very end of their institution was to prevent all dangers of such oppression; and in every such case, they do not only wrong their <HI>own souls,</HI> and
<PB N="35" REF="012414_0031_0F8997C130B446E8"/>irreparably injure a particular person, but also basely betray the <HI>liberties</HI> of their country in gene∣ral: for as <HI>without</HI> their <HI>ill compliance</HI> and act, no such mischief can happen; <HI>so</HI> by <HI>it, ill precedents are made, &amp; the plague is increased; honester Juries are</HI> disheartened, <HI>or seduced by custom from their du∣ties; just privileges are lost by</HI> disuser; <HI>and perhaps within a while some of themselves may have an hole picked in their coats, and then they are tried by ano∣ther Jury just as wise, and honest, and so deservedly come to smart under the ruinating</HI> effects, <HI>and</HI> ex∣ample, <HI>of their own folly and injustice.</HI></P>

<P>You talk of <HI>folly,</HI> and blame Jurymen, when indeed they cannot help it. They would sometimes find such a person <HI>Guilty,</HI> and such an one <HI>Innocent,</HI> and are persuaded they <HI>ought so to do;</HI> but the court over-rules, and <HI>forces</HI> them to do otherwise.</P>

<P>Good Sir! I am half ashamed to hear a <HI>Barrister</HI> talk thus: have not some in our memo∣ry been fined &amp; imprisoned? And sure that which has <HI>actually</HI> been done, is not altogether <HI>impossible.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Sir! under favour of your mighty wisdom, &amp; experience, when I said no judge <HI>could do it,</HI> I spake the more like a <HI>Barrister;</HI> for it is a maxim in law—<HI>Id possumus, quod Jure pos∣sumus;</HI> a man is said to be <HI>able</HI> to do only so much, as he may <HI>lawfully do.</HI> But such fining, and im∣prisoning, cannot <HI>lawfully</HI> be done; the judges have no <HI>right, or power,</HI> by law, to do it; and therefore it may well be said, they <HI>cannot,</HI> or are <HI>not able</HI> to do it.</P>
<P>And whereas you say, that some <HI>Juries in our memory</HI> have been fined and imprisoned, you may possibly say true; but it is as true, that it hath been only in our memory; for no such thing was practised in antient times; for so I find it asserted by a late learned judge
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord chief justice <HI>Vaughan</HI> in his Reports, fol. 146.</NOTE>, in these positive words: <HI>No case can be offered, either before attaints grant∣ed in general, or after, that ever a Jury was punish∣ed by fine and imprisonment by any judge, for not finding according to their evidence, and his direction, until</HI> Popham's <HI>time; nor is there clear proof, that he ever fined them for that reason, separated from other misdemeanours.</HI> And fol. 152, he affirms, — <HI>That no man can shew, that a Jury was ever pu∣nished upon an information, either at law, or in the Star-Chamber, where the charge was only for find∣ing
<PB N="37" REF="012414_0033_0F8997C2B53B1728"/>against their evidence, or giving an untrue ver∣dict; unless imbracery, subordination, or the like were joined.</HI> So that, you see, the attempt is an <HI>innovation</HI> as well as <HI>unjust;</HI> a thing unknown to our fore-fathers, and the ancient <HI>sages</HI> of the law: and therefore so much the more to be <HI>watch∣ed</HI> against, resisted, and suppressed, whilst <HI>young;</HI> lest in time this crafty <HI>cockatrice</HI>'s <HI>egg,</HI> hatched, and sostered by ignorance, and pusillanimous compli∣ance, grow up into a <HI>serpent</HI> too big to be master∣ed, and so blast, and destroy the <HI>first-born</HI> of our <HI>English</HI> freedoms. And indeed (blessed be God) it hath <HI>hitherto</HI> been rigorously opposed as often as it durst <HI>crawl</HI> abroad; being condemned in <HI>par∣liament,</HI> and knocked o'th' head by the resolutions of the <HI>judges</HI> upon solemn argument: as, by and by, I shall demonstrate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but are Jurors not liable then to <HI>fine</HI> or imprisonment, in <HI>any case</HI> whatsoever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you run from the point; we were talking of giving their verdict, and you speak of any case whatsoever. Whereas you should herein ob∣serve a necessary distinction, which I shall give you in the words of that learned judge last recited
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Reports, fol. 152.</NOTE>: <HI>Much of the office of Jurors, in order to their ver∣dict, is</HI> MINISTERIAL: <HI>as not withdrawing from their fellows after they are sworn; not receiving from either side evidence not given in court; not eating and drinking before their verdict; refusing to give a verdict,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>wherein if they transgress, they may be fincable. But the verdict itself when given, is not an act ministerial, but</HI> JUDICIAL, <HI>and (sup∣posed to be) according to the best of their judgment; for which they are not finable, nor to be punished, but by attaint;</HI> that is, by <HI>another Jury,</HI> in cases where an attaint lies, and where it shall be found that <HI>wilfully,</HI> they gave a verdict, <HI>false</HI> and <HI>corrupt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="012414_0034_0F8997C3704E5540"/>
Now that Juries, <HI>otherwise,</HI> are in no case <HI>punish∣able,</HI> nor can (for giving their verdict according to their consciences, and the best of their judgment) be legally <HI>fined</HI> or imprisoned by any judge, on co∣lour of <HI>not going according to their evidence,</HI> or finding <HI>contrary to the directions of the court;</HI> is a truth, both founded on unanswerable <HI>reasons,</HI> and confirmed by irrefragable <HI>authorities.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those I would gladly hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are <HI>many,</HI> but some of the most e∣vident are these that follow. As for reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. A Jury ought not to be fined, or imprisoned, because they do not follow the judge's directions; for if they do follow his directions, they may yet be attained: and to say they gave their verdict according to his directions, is no bar but the judgment shall be <HI>reversed,</HI> and they <HI>punished</HI> for doing that, which if they had not done, they should (by this opinion) have been fined, and im∣prisoned by the judge.—Which is <HI>unreasonable.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If they <HI>do not follow</HI> his direction, and be therefore <HI>fined,</HI> yet they may be <HI>attainted,</HI> and so they should be <HI>doubly</HI> punished by distinct judica∣tures for the same offence; which the common law never admits.</P>
<P N="3">3. To what end is the Jury to be returned out of the <HI>vicinage</HI> (that is, <HI>the neighbourhood</HI>) whence the issue ariseth? to what end must <HI>hundredors</HI> be of the Jury, whom the law supposeth to have near∣er knowledge of the fact than those of the vicinage in general? to what end are they <HI>challenged</HI> so scrupulously to the <HI>array</HI> and <HI>poll?</HI> to what end must they have such a certain <HI>freehold,</HI> and be <HI>probi, &amp; legales, homines,</HI> and not of <HI>affinity</HI> with the par∣ties concerned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if after all this, they <HI>implicitly</HI> must give a verdict by the dictates, and authority of another man, under pain of <HI>fines,</HI> and <HI>imprison∣ment,</HI> when sworn to do it according to the best of
<PB N="39" REF="012414_0035_0F8997C512B6B9C8"/>their <HI>own knowledge?</HI> A man cannot see by ano∣ther's eye, nor hear by <HI>another's ear;</HI> no more can a man conclude, or <HI>infer,</HI> the thing to be resolved by <HI>another's</HI> understanding, or reasoning; unless all mens understandings were equally alike. And if, merely in compliance, because the judge <HI>says thus, or thus,</HI> a Jury shall give a verdict; tho' such their verdict should happen to be <HI>right,</HI> true, &amp; just; yet they being not assured <HI>it is so</HI> from their own un∣derstanding are <HI>forsworn,</HI> atleast <HI>in foro conscientiae.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Were Jurors so <HI>finable,</HI> then every mayor, and bailiff of corporations, all stewards of leets, justices of peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whatever matters are tried before them, shall have <HI>verdicts to their minds,</HI> or else fine, and imprison the Jurors till they <HI>have;</HI> so that such must be either pleased, humoured, or gatified, else no justice, or right, is to be had in any court.</P>
<P N="5">5. Whereas a person by law may <HI>challenge</HI> the sheriff, or any Juryman, if of kin to his adversary; yet he cannot challenge a mayor, recorder, justice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who 'tis possible will have a verdict for their <HI>kinsman,</HI> or against their <HI>enemy,</HI> or else fine and im∣prison the Jury till they have obtained it: so that by this means our lives, liberties, and properties, shall be solely tried by, and remain at the arbitrary disposal of every mercenary, or corrupted <HI>justice,</HI> mayor, bailiff, or recorder, if any such should, at any time, get into <HI>office.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. 'Tis unreasonable that a Jury should be finable on pretence of their going <HI>against their evi∣dence;</HI> because it can never be <HI>tried</HI> whether or no in truth they did find with, or against, their evidence, by reason no <HI>writ of error</HI> lies in the case.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And they may of their own knowledge have infor∣mation of various matters to exculpate, or condemn, of which the judge is wholly ignorant.</NOTE></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="40" REF="012414_0036_0F8997C5B185F2B0"/>
7. Were Jurymen liable to such arbitrary fines, they would be in a <HI>worse condition</HI> than the cri∣minals that are tried by them; for in all civil ac∣tions, informations, and indictments, some appeals, or writs of false judgement, or of error, do lie into <HI>superior courts</HI> to try the regular proceedings of the inferior. But here can be no after-trial, or ex∣amination; but the Juryman (if fining at all were <HI>lawful</HI>) must either pay the fine, or lie by it; <HI>without remedy</HI> to decide, whether in his particular case he were legally fined, or not.</P>
<P N="8">8. Without a fact agreed, it is as impossible for a judge, or any other to <HI>know the law,</HI> relating to that fact, or <HI>direct</HI> concerning it, as to know an ac∣cident that hath no subject; for as, where there is <HI>no law, there is no transgression,</HI> so where there is <HI>no transgression, there is no place for law:</HI> for <HI>the law</HI> (saith divine authority) <HI>is made for the trans∣gressor.</HI> And as <HI>Coke</HI> tells us, <HI>Ex Facto Jus oritur,</HI> upon stating the fact, or transgression, matter of law doth arise, or grow out of the root of the fact. Now the Jury being the <HI>sole judges of fact, and matter in issue</HI> before them, not finding the fact on which the law should arise, cannot be said to find <HI>against law,</HI> which is no other than a superstructure on fact; so that to say they have found against the law, when <HI>no fact</HI> is found, is absurd; an expression insignificant, and unintelligible. For no <HI>issue</HI> can be joined of matter in <HI>law,</HI> no <HI>Jury</HI> can be <HI>charged</HI> with the trial of matter in law barely, no <HI>evidence</HI> ever was, or can be, given to a Jury of what is law, or not: nor can any such oath be given to, or taken by a Jury, to try matter in law, nor does an attaint lie for such oath, if false, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if <HI>by finding against the directions of the court in mat∣ter of law,</HI> shall be understood, that if the judge having heard the evidence given in court, (for he can regularly know no other, though the Jury may)
<PB N="41" REF="012414_0037_0F8997C672253438"/>shall tell the Jury upon this evidence, the <HI>law is for the plaintiff, or for the defendant,</HI> and the Jury are under <HI>pain</HI> of fine, and imprisonment, to <HI>find</HI> accordingly; then it is plain, the Jury ought <HI>of duty</HI> so to do. Now if this were <HI>true,</HI> who sees not that the Jury is but a troublesome <HI>delay,</HI> of great <HI>charge,</HI> much <HI>formality,</HI> and no real <HI>use</HI> in deter∣mining right, and wrong, but mere <HI>echoes</HI> to sound back the pleasure of the court; and consequently, that trials by them might be better <HI>abolished</HI> than continued? which is at once to spit folly in the faces of our venerable ancestors, and enslave our posterity.</P>
<P N="9">9. As the judge can <HI>never direct what the law is</HI> in any matter controverted, without <HI>first knowing</HI> the <HI>fact;</HI> so, he cannot, possibly, know the fact but from the <HI>evidence</HI> which the Jury have: but he can never <HI>fully</HI> know what evidence they have; for besides what is sworn in court, (which is all that the judge can know) the Jury, being of the <HI>neighbourhood,</HI> may, and oft-times <HI>do, know</HI> some∣thing of their own knowledge, as to the matter it∣self, the credit of the evidence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may justly <HI>sway</HI> them in delivering their verdict, and which self-knowledge of theirs is so far <HI>countenanced</HI> by law, that it supposes them capable thereby to <HI>try</HI> the matter in issue, (and so they must) though <HI>no evidence</HI> were given, on either side, in court. As when any man is indicted, and no evidence comes against him, the direction of the court al∣ways is, <HI>You are to acquit him, unless of your own knowledge you know him guilty;</HI> so that even, in that case, they may find him guilty, without any witnesses. Now how absurd is it to think, that any judge has power to <HI>fine</HI> a jury s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> going against their evidence, when he that so fine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, knoweth perhaps nothing of their <HI>evidence</HI> at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (as in the last case) or at least but some <HI>part</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="42" REF="012414_0038_0F8997C7333E31D0"/>For how is it possible he should lawfully punish them for that, which it is impossible for him to know?</P>
<P>Lastly, Is any thing more common, than for two lawyers, or judges, to deduce <HI>contrary,</HI> and opposite conclusions out of the <HI>same case</HI> in law? And why then may not two men infer distinct conclusions from the same <HI>testimony?</HI> And consequently, may not the <HI>Judge,</HI> and <HI>Jury,</HI> honestly differ in their opinion, or result from the evidence, as well as two judges may, which often happens? And shall the <HI>Jurymen</HI> merely for this difference of apprehension, merit fine, and imprisonment, because they do that which they cannot otherwise do, preserving their <HI>oath</HI> and <HI>integrity?</HI> especially when by law they are presumed to know <HI>better,</HI> and much <HI>more</HI> of the business, than the judge does, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Are not all these, gross contradicting absurdi∣ties, and unworthy (by any man that deserves a <HI>gown</HI>) to be put upon the <HI>law of England,</HI> which has ever owned <HI>right reason</HI> for its parent, and du∣tifully submitted to be <HI>guided</HI> thereby?</P>

<P>If the <HI>law,</HI> as you say, be <HI>reason,</HI> then undoubtedly this practice of <HI>fining of Juries</HI> is most <HI>illegal</HI> since there cannot be any thing more <HI>un∣reasonable:</HI> but what <HI>authorities</HI> have you against it?</P>

<P>You have heard it proved to be a <HI>mo∣dern</HI> upstart encroachment, so you cannot expect any direct, or express condemnation of it in ancient times; because the thing was not then <HI>set on foot.</HI> And, by the way, though <HI>negative arguments</HI> are not necessarily conclusive, yet that we meet with no <HI>precedents</HI> of old of Juries fined, for giving their verdict contrary to evidence, or the sense of the court, is a violent presumption that it ought not to be done: for it cannot be supposed, that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> did <HI>first of all discover,</HI> that verdicts were

Here you see it <HI>branded</HI> in <HI>parliament:</HI> Next you shall see it formally condemned on a solemn ar∣gument by the <HI>judges.</HI> The case thus.</P>
<P>At the sessions for <HI>London, Sept.</HI> 1670, <HI>William Pen,</HI> and <HI>William Mead</HI> (two of the people com∣monly called <HI>Quakers</HI>) were indicted, for that they with others, to the number of three hundred, on the 14th <HI>Aug.</HI> 22 <HI>Regis,</HI> in <HI>Gracechurch-Street,</HI> did with force, and arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unlawfully, and tu∣multuously, assemble, and congregate themselves together, to the disturbance of the peace; and that the said <HI>William Pen</HI> did there preach, and speak, to the said <HI>Mead,</HI> and other persons in the open street; by reason whereof, a great concourse, and <HI>tumult,</HI> of people in the street aforesaid then, and there, a long time, did remain, and continue, in contempt of our said lord the king, and of his law, to the great <HI>disturbance</HI> of his peace, to the great <HI>terror</HI> and disturbance, of many of his liege people, and subjects, to the ill example of all others in the like case offenders, and against the peace of our said lord the king, his crown, and dignity.</P>
<P>The prisoners pleading <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> it was proved, that there <HI>was a meeting</HI> at the time in the in∣dictment mentioned, in <HI>Gracechurch-Street,</HI> con∣sisting of three, or four hundred people, in the open street; that <HI>William Pen</HI> was <HI>speaking, or preaching,</HI> to them, but <HI>what</HI> he said, the witnesses (who were officers and soldiers sent to disperse them) could not <HI>hear.</HI>—This was the effect of the evidence; which Sir <HI>John Howel,</HI> the then record∣er, (as I find in the <HI>print</HI> of that trial) was pleased to sum up to the Jury, in these words:</P>
<P><Q>You have heard what the indictment is; it is for preaching to the people in the street, and drawing a tumultuous company after them, and Mr. <HI>Pen</HI> was speaking: if they should not be disturbed, you see they will go on: there are
<PB N="45" REF="012414_0041_0F8997C972481200"/>three or four witnesses that have proved this,— that he did preach there, that Mr. <HI>Mead</HI> did al∣low of it. After this you have heard by sub∣stantial witnesses what is said against them; <HI>Now we are upon the matter of fact, which you are to keep to, and observe, as what hath been fully sworn, at your peril.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This trial began on the <HI>Saturday;</HI> the Jury re∣tiring, after some considerable time spent in debate, came in, and gave this verdict.—<HI>Guilty of speak∣ing in Gracechurch-Street.</HI> At which the court was offended, and told them, <HI>they had as good say nothing;</HI> adding, — <HI>Was it not an unlawful assem∣bly? You mean he was speaking to a tumult of peo∣ple there?</HI> But the foreman saying, what he had delivered was <HI>all</HI> he had in commission; and others of them affirming, that they allowed of no such words as an <HI>unlawful assembly</HI> in their verdict; they were sent back again, and then brought in a verdict in writing, subscribed with all their hands, in these words: <Q><HI>We, the Jurors hereafter named, do find</HI> William Pen <HI>to be guilty of speaking, or preaching, to an assembly met together in</HI> Gracechurch-Street, <HI>the</HI> 14th <HI>of</HI> Aug. 1670. <HI>And</HI> William Mead <HI>not guilty of the said indictment.</HI></Q></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,</HI> Though this Jury, for their excellent example of courage, and constancy, deserve the commendation of every good <HI>Englishman;</HI> yet, if they had been better ad∣vised, they might have brought the prisoners in <HI>Not Guilty</HI> at first, and saved themselves the trouble, and inconveni∣encies of these two nights restraint. <HI>See</HI> State Trials, vol. II. p. 606, in fol. <HI>Vide note * to page</HI> 15.</NOTE> This the court resented still worse, and there∣fore sent them back again, and adjourned till <HI>Sun∣day morning;</HI> but then too they insisted on the same verdict: so the court adjourned till <HI>Monday morning;</HI> and then the Jury brought in the priso∣ners
<PB N="46" REF="012414_0042_0F8997CA356D69F8"/>generally <HI>Not Guilty;</HI> which was recorded, and allowed of. But immediately the court fined them <HI>forty marks</HI> a man, &amp; to lie in prison till paid.</P>
<P>Being thus in <HI>custody, Edward Bushel,</HI> one of the said Jurors, on the ninth of <HI>November</HI> follow∣ing, brought his <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> in the court of <HI>Common-Pleas.</HI> On which the sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> made return, <Q>That he was detained by virtue of an order of sessions, whereby a fine of forty marks was set upon him, and eleven others, particu∣larly named; and every of them being Jurors sworn to try the issues joined between the king, and <HI>Pen,</HI> and <HI>Mead,</HI> for certain trespasses, con∣tempts, unlawful assemblies, and tumults, and who then, and there, did acquit the said <HI>Pen,</HI> and <HI>Mead,</HI> of the same, against the law of this kingdom, and against full, and manifest, evidence, and against the direction of the court in matter of law, of, and upon the premises openly in court to them given, and declared; and that it was ordered they should be imprisoned till they seve∣rally paid the said fine, which the said <HI>Bushel</HI> not having done, the same was the cause of his cap∣tion and detention
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Bushel</HI>'s Case in <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Reports at large.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The court coming to debate the <HI>validity</HI> of this <HI>return,</HI> adjudged the same <HI>insufficient:</HI> For, 1. The words,—<HI>against full, and manifest, evidence,</HI> was too general a clause: the evidence should have been <HI>fully,</HI> and particularly, recited, else how shall the court know it was <HI>so full and evident?</HI> they have now only the judgment of the <HI>sessions</HI> for it, that it was so: but said the Judges, <HI>Our judgments ought to be grounded upon our own inferences, and understandings, and not upon theirs.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is not said, that they acquitted the per∣sons indicted against full and manifest evidence, <HI>cor∣ruptly, and knowing the said evidence to be full and
<PB N="47" REF="012414_0043_0F8997CAF0406AC0"/>manifest;</HI> for otherwise it can be no <HI>crime:</HI> for <HI>that</HI> may seem <HI>full</HI> and <HI>manifest,</HI> to the court, which does not appear so to the Jury.</P>
<P N="3">3. The other part of the return, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Jury had acquitted those indicted <HI>against the di∣rection of the court in matter of law,</HI> was also ad∣judged to be <HI>naught,</HI> and unreasonable; and the <HI>fining the Juries for giving their verdict in any case</HI> concluded to be illegal, for the several reasons be∣fore <HI>recited,</HI> and other authorities of law urged to that purpose; and all the precedents and allega∣tions, brought to justify the <HI>fine, and commitment,</HI> solidly <HI>answered.</HI> Whereupon the chief justice <HI>de∣livered the opinion of the court,</HI> That the <HI>cause</HI> of commitment was <HI>insufficient;</HI> and accordingly the said <HI>Bushel,</HI> and other his fellow-prisoners, were <HI>discharged,</HI> and left to the common law for <HI>remedy and reparation of the damages,</HI> by that tortuous <HI>il∣legal</HI> imprisonment, sustained.</P>
<P>Which case is (amongst others) reported by that learned judge Sir <HI>John Vaughan,</HI> at that time lord chief justice of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> setting forth all the arguments, reasons, and authorities, on which the court proceeded therein; from which I have extracted most of the <HI>reasons</HI> which I before recited for this point, and, for the greatest part, in the <HI>very words</HI> of that reverend author.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>This <HI>resolution</HI> hath, one would think, (as you said) <HI>knocked this</HI> illegal practice on the head, beyond any possibility of <HI>revival;</HI> but may it not one day be <HI>denied</HI> to be law, and the contra∣ry <HI>justified?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No such thing can be done without ap∣parently <HI>violating,</HI> and subverting all <HI>law, justice,</HI> and <HI>modesty:</HI> for though the <HI>precedent</HI> itself be va∣luable, and without further enquiry is wont to be allowed, when given thus <HI>deliberately</HI> upon solemn debate by the whole court; yet, it is not only <HI>that,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="012414_0044_0F8997CC92A07690"/>but the sound, substantial, and everlasting <HI>reasons,</HI> whereon they grounded such their resolves, that will, at all times, <HI>justify</HI> fining of Juries in such cases to be <HI>illegal.</HI> Besides, as the <HI>reporter</HI> was most considerable, both in his <HI>quality</HI> as lord <HI>chief justice,</HI> and for his parts, soundness of judgment, and deep learning in the <HI>law;</HI> so such his book of Reports is <HI>approved,</HI> &amp; recommended to the world, (as appears by the page next after the epistle) by the right honourable the present lord chancellor of <HI>England;</HI> Sir <HI>William Scroggs,</HI> now lord chief ju∣stice of <HI>England;</HI> my lord <HI>North,</HI> chief justice of the <HI>Common-Pleas;</HI> and, in a word, by all the jud∣ges of <HI>England</HI> at the time of publishing thereof: so that it cannot be imagined how any book can challenge greater authority, unless we should expect it to be particularly confirmed by act of parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have answered all my <HI>scruples;</HI> and since I see the law has made so good <HI>provision</HI> for Jurymen's privileges, and safety, God forbid any Juryman should be of so <HI>base</HI> a temper, as to be∣tray that, otherwise, impregnable <HI>fortress,</HI> where∣in the law hath placed him to preserve, &amp; defend, the just rights, and liberties of his country, by treache∣rously surrendering the same into the hands of <HI>vi∣olence,</HI> or <HI>oppression,</HI> though masked under ever so fair stratagems, and pretences. For my own part, I shall not now decline to appear according to my summons; and therefore (though I fear I have de∣tained you <HI>too long</HI> already) shall desire a little more of your direction about the <HI>office</HI> of a Juryman in particular, that I may uprightly, and <HI>honestly,</HI> discharge the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I think, from what we have dis∣coursed, being <HI>digested,</HI> and improved, by your own reason, you may sufficiently inform yourself; yet, to gratify your request, I shall add a few brief re∣marks, as well of what you ought cautiously to <HI>a∣void,</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="012414_0045_0F8997CD31BBB080"/>as what you must diligently <HI>pursue,</HI> and re∣gard, if you would justly, and truly, do your duty.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to what you must avoid.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am very confident, that you would not wil∣lingly violate <HI>the oath</HI> which you take; but it is possible that <HI>there are such</HI> who as frequently <HI>break</HI> them, as <HI>take</HI> them, through their <HI>careless custom</HI> on the one hand, or <HI>slavish sear,</HI> on the other, against whom I would fully caution you; that you may <HI>defend</HI> yourself, and others, against any enemies of your country's liberties, and happiness, and keep a good conscience towards God, and towards man.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is frequent, that when Juries are withdrawn, that they may consult of their <HI>verdict,</HI> they soon for∣get that solemn oath they took, and that <HI>mighty charge</HI> of the life and liberty of men, and their e∣states, whereof then they are made <HI>judges;</HI> and that, on <HI>their breath,</HI> not only the <HI>fortunes</HI> of the particlar party, but perhaps the preservation, or <HI>ruin,</HI> of several numerous families does solely de∣pend: Now I say, without due consideration of all this; nay sometimes without <HI>one serious thought,</HI> or consulted reason, offered <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con,</HI> presently the <HI>foreman,</HI> or one, or two, that call themselves <HI>antient</HI> Jurymen, though in truth they never <HI>knew</HI> what belongs to the place more than a common <HI>school-boy,</HI> rashly deliver their <HI>opinions;</HI> and <HI>all the rest,</HI> in respect to their supposed <HI>gravity,</HI> and <HI>expe∣rience,</HI> or because they have the bigest <HI>estates,</HI> or to avoid the trouble of <HI>disputing</HI> the point, or to prevent the spoiling of <HI>dinner</HI> by delay, or some such <HI>weighty</HI> reason, forthwith agree <HI>blindfold,</HI> or else go to holding up of hands, or telling of <HI>noses,</HI> and so the <HI>major vote</HI> carries away <HI>captive</HI> bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the <HI>reason,</HI> and the <HI>conscience,</HI> of the rest: thus tri∣fling with <HI>sacred oaths,</HI> and putting mens lives, li∣berties, and properties (as it were) to the hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣zard

<P N="3">3. Such a <HI>slavish fear</HI> attends many Jurors, that let but the court direct to find, <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> though they themselves see no just reason for it; yea, oft-times though their own opinions are con∣trary, and their consciences tell them it ought to go <HI>otherwise;</HI> yet, right, or wrong, accordingly they will bring in their verdict; and, therefore, many of them never regard seriously the <HI>course,</HI> and force, of the evidence, what, and how, it was de∣livered, more, or less, to prove the indictment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but <HI>as the court sums it up.</HI> they find; as if Juries were appointed for no other purpose but to <HI>echo</HI> back, what the bench would have done Such a base temper is to be avoided, as you would escape being <HI>forsworn,</HI> even though your verdict should be right: for since you do not know it so to be, by your own judgment, or understanding, you have <HI>abused your oath,</HI> and hazarded your own <HI>soul,</HI> as well as your neighbour's <HI>life,</HI> liberty, or proper∣ty; because you <HI>blindly</HI> depend on the opinion, or perhaps <HI>passion</HI> of others, when you were sworn well, and truly, to try them <HI>yourselves.</HI> Such an <HI>impli∣cit faith</HI> is near of kin to that of <HI>Rome</HI> in religion, and, at least, in the next degree, as <HI>dangerous</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though Judges are likely to be more <HI>able</HI> than Jury∣men, yet Jurymen are likely to be more <HI>honest</HI> than Jud∣ges; especially in all cales where the power of the pre∣rogative, or the rights of the people, are in dispute. Our rights, therefore, both as individuals, and as a people, are more likely to be secure, while Juries follow the result of their own opinion; for less danger will arise from the mistakes of Jurymen, than from the corruption of Judges. Besides, improper verdicts will but seldom occur; since juries will avail themselves of the abilities, and learning, of the Judges, by consulting them upon all points of law; and thus to the advantage of information, may add their own impartiality.</NOTE>.</P>

4. There are some that make <HI>a Trade</HI> of being Jurymen, that <HI>seek</HI> for the office, use means to be constantly <HI>continued</HI> in it, will not give a <HI>disobliging</HI> verdict, lest they should be <HI>discharged,</HI> and serve no more: these <HI>standing Jurors</HI> have certainly some ill game to play. There are others that hope to <HI>signalize</HI> themselves, to get a better trade, or some <HI>preferment</HI> by <HI>serving a turn.</HI> There are others that have particular <HI>piques,</HI> and a humour of re∣venge against such, or such, <HI>parties:</HI> if a man be but <HI>miscalled</HI> by some odious name, or said to be of an exploded faction—straight they cry, <HI>hang him, find him G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilty,</HI> no punishment can be too bad for such <HI>a fellow;</HI> in such a case they think it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit to <HI>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch</HI> an evidence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terhooks and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a point of law, because they fancy i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> makes for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> interest of the government; as if <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pression</HI> could in any case be for the true interest of government, when in truth nothing more <HI>weakens</HI> or <HI>destroys</HI> it. But this was an old <HI>stratagem,</HI> <Q>if thou <HI>suffer this man to escape, thou shalt not be</HI> Caesar<HI>'s friend:</HI></Q> when <HI>Caesar</HI> was so far from either <HI>needing,</HI> or <HI>thanking,</HI> them for any such base services, that, had he but truly understood them, he would severely have punished their partiality and tyranny.</P>
<P>All these, and the like, <HI>pestilent biasses,</HI> are to be avoided, and abominated, by every honest Juryman.</P>
<P>But now as to the positive qualifications requisite.</P>
<P N="1">1. You that are Jurymen, should, first of all, se∣riously regard the weight, and importance, of the
<PB N="52" REF="012414_0048_0F8997CF7437D028"/>office; your own souls, other mens lives, liberties, estates, all that in this world are dear to them, are at stake, and in your hands; there∣fore, consider things well before hand, and come substantially furnished, and provided, with sound, and well grounded, consciences, with clear minds, free from malice, fear, hope, or favour; lest, instead of <HI>judging</HI> others, thou shouldest work thy own condemnation, and stand in the sight of God, the Creator, and Judge, of all men, no better than a <HI>Murtherer,</HI> or <HI>perjured</HI> Malefactor.</P>
<P N="2">2. Observe well the record, indictment, or in∣formation that is read, and the several parts there∣of, both as to the matter, manner, and form.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take due notice of, and pay regard, to the evidence offered for proof of the indictment, and each part of it, as well to <HI>manner,</HI> and <HI>form,</HI> as <HI>matter;</HI> and if you suspect any s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bornation, foul practice, or tampering hath been with the witnes∣ses, or that they have any malice, or sinister design, have a special regard to the circumstances, or inco∣herences, of their tales, and endeavour, by apt que∣stions, to sift out the truth, or discover the villainy. And, for your better satisfaction, endeavour to write down the evidence, or the heads thereof, that you may, the better, recall it to memory.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take notice of the nature of the crime charg∣ed, and what law the prosecution is grounded upon, and distinguish the supposed criminal fact, which is proved, from the aggravating circumstances, which are not proved.</P>
<P N="5">5. Remember that in Juries there is no plurality of voices to be allowed: seven cannot over rule, or, by virtue of majority, conclude five; no, nor eleven, one. But as the verdict is given in the name of all the twelve, or else it is void; so every one of them must be actually agreeing, and satis∣fied in his particular understanding, and consci∣ence,
<PB N="53" REF="012414_0049_0F8997D030B2DF88"/>of the truth, and righteousness, of such ver∣dict, or else he is forsworn. And, therefore, if one man differ in opinion from his fellows, they must be kept together, till either they, by strength of rea∣son, or argument, can satisfy him, or he convince them. For he is not to be hectored, much less pu∣nished, by the court into a compliance; for as the lord chief Justice <HI>Vaughan</HI> says well
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rep. <HI>fol.</HI> 151.</NOTE>, <HI>if a man dif∣fer in judgment from his fellows, whereby they are kept a day, and a night, though his dissent may not in truth be so reasonable as the opinion of the rest that agree; yet, if his judgment be not satisfied, one dis∣agreeing, can be no more criminal, than four, or five, disagreeing with the rest.</HI> Upon which occasion the said author recites a remarkable case out of an antient
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> law-book: <HI>A Juror would not a∣gree with his fellows for two days, and being de∣manded by the judges, if he would agree, said he would first die in prison; whereupon he was commit∣ted, and the verdict of the eleven taken: but upon better advice, the verdict of the eleven was quashed, and the Juror discharged without fine; and the Justices said the way was to carry them in carts</HI> (this is to be understood at assizes where the Jud∣ges cannot stay, but must remove in such a time into another county) <HI>until they agreed,</HI> and NOT BY FINING THEM. <HI>And as the Judges erred in taking the verdict of eleven, so they did in imprisoning the twelfth.</HI> And therefore, you see, on second thoughts released him.</P>
<P N="6">6. Endeavour, as much as your circumstances will permit, at your spare hours to read, and un∣derstand, the fundamental laws of the country; such as <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> the Petition of Right, the late excellent act for <HI>Habeas Corpus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Horne's Mir∣ror of Justices,</HI> Sir <HI>Edw. Coke,</HI> in his 2d, 3d, &amp; 4th Parts of the Institutes of the Law of <HI>England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>
<PB N="54" REF="012414_0050_0F8997D0F1E4C420"/>Judge <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Reports: these are books frequent to be had, and of excellent use to inform any rea∣der, of competent apprehension, of the true liber∣ties, and privileges, which every <HI>Englishman</HI> is just∣ly intitled unto, and estated in, by his birthright; as also the nature of crimes, and the punishments severally, &amp; respectively, inflicted on them by law; the office, and duties, of Judges, Juries, and all of∣ficers, and ministers, of justice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are high∣ly necessary for every Juryman, in some competent measure, to know; for the law of <HI>England</HI> hath not placed trials by Juries, to stand between men, and death, or destruction to so little purpose, as to pro∣nounce men <HI>Guilty,</HI> without regard to the nature of the offence, or to what is to be inflicted thereupon.</P>
<P>For want of duly understanding, and considering, these things, Juries, many times, plunge themselves into lamentable perplexities; as it befel the Jury who were the triers of Mr. <HI>Udal,</HI> a minister, who in the 32d year of queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> was indicted, and arraigned, at <HI>Croydon</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>State-Trials,</HI> fol. Vol. 1. P. 161.</NOTE>, for high treason, for defaming the queen, and her government, in a certain book intitled, <HI>A Demonstration of the Dis∣cipline,</HI> &amp;c. And though there was no direct, but a scambling shadow of proof, and though the book, duly considered, contained no matter of treason, but certain words which by a forced construction were laid to tend to the defamation of the govern∣ment, &amp; so the thing prosecuted under that name; yet the Jury not thinking that in pronouncing him guilty, they had upon their oath pronounced him guilty of treason, and to die as a traitor; but sup∣posing that they had only declared him <HI>guilty</HI> of making the book; hereupon they brought him in <HI>guilty;</HI> but when after the Judge's sentence of death against him, which they never in the least in∣to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded, they found what they had done; they were
<PB N="55" REF="012414_0051_0F8997D1B231FDA8"/>confounded in themselves, and would have done any thing in the world to have revoked that unwary pernicious verdict, when, alas! it was too late. Dr. <HI>Ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> has this witty note on this gentleman's conviction, that it was conceived <HI>rigorous</HI> in the <HI>greatest,</HI> which at best (saith he) is <HI>cruel</HI> in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east</HI> degree. And it seems so queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> thought it, for she suspended execution, and he died naturally. But his story survives, to warn all succeeding Jurymen to endeavour better to understand what it is they do, and what the con∣sequences thereof will be.</P>
<P N="7">7. As there is nothing I have said intended to encourage you to partiality, or tempt any Juryman to a connivance at sin, and malefactors, whereby those pests of society should avoid being brought to condign punishment, and so the law cease to be a terror to evil doers, which were in him an horrible perjury, and indeed a foolish pity, or <HI>Crudelis Mi∣sericordia,</HI> a cruel mercy; for <HI>he</HI> is highly injurious to the good, that absolves the bad, when real crimes are proved against them: so I must take leave to say, that in cases where the matter is dubious, both lawyers, and divines, prescribe rather favour than rigour. An eminent and learned Judge
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fortescue, Cap.</HI> 27.</NOTE> of our own, has in this advice and wish gone before me; <HI>Mallem reverà viginti facinoresos mortem pietate evadere, quam justum unum injustè condemnari. I verily</HI> (saith he) <HI>had rather twenty evil doers should escape death through tenderness, or pity, than that one innocent man should be unjustly condemned.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude with that excellent advice of my lord <HI>Coke</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the Epilogue of his 4th Part of <HI>Institutes.</HI></NOTE>, which he generally addresses to all Judges, but may no less properly be applied to Ju∣rors.—</P>

Fear not to do right to all, and to deliver your verdicts justly according to the laws; for fear is no∣thing but a betraying of the succours that reason should afford: and if you shall sincerely execute ju∣stice, be assured of three things:</P>
<P N="1">1. Though some may malign you, yet God will give you his Blessing.</P>
<P N="2">2. That though thereby you may offend great men, and favourites, yet you shall have the favour∣able kindness of the Almighty, and be his favourites.</P>
<P>And lastly, That in so doing, against all scanda∣lous complaints, and pragmatical devices, against you. God will defend you as with a shield.— <HI>For thou, Lord, wilt give a blessing unto the righteous, and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou de∣fend him as with a shield.</HI> Psalm v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</P>
