<HEAD>THE <HI>POLITICAL</HI> CENSOR <HI>For MAY,</HI> 1796.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<HEAD>PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE OF RE∣PRESENTATIVES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the last Censor went to the press, the long contested and important question on the treaty with Great Britain was still undecided. Go! said I, gentle Censor, and, in thy mild and conciliating accents, beseech the desperate demagogues to spare us a little longer.</P>
<P>A sort of cloud had interposed between the peo∣ple and the sun of prosperity. Terror had seized on all those who had something to lose; they knew not whether it was prudent to buy or to sell, whe∣ther their ships were safest in the harbour or out at sea; the sans-culottes began to grind their teeth and whet their couteaux, while the heads of the aristocrats seemed to totter on their shoulders, and hang as it were by a bit of skin.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="030223_0004_0FE52B371A483DB0"/>In this situation were we, when, on the 29th of April, the question was taken in a committee of the whole House. The <HI>Ayes</HI> were 49 and the <HI>Noes</HI> 49: the Chairman, Mr. Muhlenberg of Penn∣sylvania gave the casting vote in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Thus was the fate of a nation suspended upon the voice of one man, and thus have we once more narrowly escaped war and anarchy.</P>
<P>Some benignant sylph certainly whispered Mr. Muhlenberg in the ear; for, it is well known, that he had been a declared enemy to the treaty from the first moment of its appearance. He was one of the leaders at the town meeting held at Philadel∣phia on the 25th of July, 1795. At this meeting "the d—ned treaty was kicked to hell," and the assembly adjourned to go and break Mr. Bingham's windows. This meeting appointed a committee to draw up a memorial, praying the President not to ratify the Treaty. The memorial after reprobating every article of the treaty singly, concludes thus: <Q>Your committee apprehend that great evils would result to these States from this treaty, if ratified, they therefore recommend that an address be prepared, and presented to the President of the United States, praying that he will not ratify the said treaty.</Q> Now, Mr. Muhlenberg was one of the very committee who drew up this memorial. Nor did his opposition cease here; for we find him voting for the papers, and for the protesting reso∣lution of Mr. Blount. Had he not voted for this latter resolution, I could have admitted, that he gave his casting vote from a persuasion that the House had no right to set the treaty aside; but, in voting for the resolution of Mr. Blount, he in∣sists on this right, and therefore the casting vote
<PB N="174" REF="030223_0005_0FE4FE6C342EE300"/>
remains to be accounted for. Idle stories go about: slander is ever on the wing: for my part I am not one of those who will give credit to nothing that he cannot see through: but I leave a mystery as I find it. This miraculous conversion is certainly to be attributed to the interposition of some <HI>invisible</HI> power; to that power let us return our thanks, and not to Mr. Muhlenberg.</P>
<P>But though the resolution for carrying the treaty into effect had passed in the committee, it had yet to get through the House, and much apprehension was entertained for its safety on the passage. The opposition was determined to dispute the ground to the last inch; accordingly when the resolution was taken up in the House, on the 30th, <HI>Mr. Dear∣born</HI> moved the following preamble to it: <Q>That although in the opinion of this House the trea∣ty is <HI>highly objectionable</HI> and <HI>may prove injurious to the United States,</HI> yet, considering all the cir∣cumstances relating thereto, particularly that the last 18 articles are to continue in force only dur∣ing the present war, and two years thereafter, and confiding also in the efficacy of measures which may be taken for bringing about a discon∣tinuance of the violations committed on our neutral rights, in regard to our vessels and sea∣men, therefore;</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This was the last shift of a baffled saction. <Q>If you do carry the treaty, said they your resolution shall contain the proofs of your own folly and incon∣sistency.</Q> The plan was well laid: it was expect∣ed that some of the members, who had voted for the resolution the day before, would also vote for the preamble; nor was this improbable; any in consistency might be expected from some of them</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="030223_0006_0FE52B389C3CB2E0"/>Mr. Muhlenberg, as if afraid of being out∣stripped by Mr. Christie and some others, hasten∣ed to give the preamble his entire approbation, and did at last actually vote for it. Thus, we see this gentleman, first opposing the treaty at a town meet∣ing, and drawing up a memorial beseeching the President not to ratify it; then we find him voting for a resolution that declares the House to have a right to set the treaty aside; but, when called on for his casting voice, he seems to have forgotten all about the evil tendency of the treaty and the unmaking power of the House. Sleep, however, seems to have refreshed his memory, and we find him, next day, voting for a preamble, that de∣clares this treaty <Q>highly objectionable, and that it may prove injurious to the United States;</Q> but, in less than ten minutes afterwards he falls back into his old state of torpidity, and really votes for this very "highly objectionable and injurious treaty," without any modification or preamble at all. What an excellent political weather-cock! He tacks with ten times the celerity of the Indian on the top of his Sugar-house.</P>
<P>When the preamble was put, there appeared ac∣cording to the counting, or rather miscounting, of the <HI>"Calm Observer" Ayes</HI> 49 and <HI>Noes</HI> 49; con∣sequently, the speaker, Mr. Dayton, was called on for the casting vote, and he gave it in the ne∣gative.</P>
<P>Thus, another casting vote preserved the honour of the House, as a former one had done that of the nation. But, it must be remarked here, that, when the names of the members came to be print∣ed, it appeared 50 had voted in the negative; so that there was a majority against the inconsistent
<PB N="176" REF="030223_0007_0FE4FE6DC589C538"/>
preamble, even without the casting vote of the Speaker.</P>
<P>Mr. Jekyll, in his account of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act (Woodfall's Reports for 1794; Vol. 4. p. 12) says: <Q>this act was first obtained by something like a miracle. In one stage, it was carried in the upper House by a sort of <HI>pious fraud:</HI> one of the tellers seeing a very <HI>fat</HI> Lord coming in, and knowing him to be a man of <HI>weight,</HI> count∣ed him for <HI>ten.</HI></Q> I should have thought that, for like reasons, Mr. Muhlenberg had been count∣ed for <HI>two,</HI> had not the error been by substraction in place of addition. Whether the <HI>fraud</HI> would have been quite so <HI>pious</HI> on this occasion, as in ob∣taining the Act of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> is another thing: yes, Mr. Beckley, that's another thing.</P>
<P>How the Clerk of the House came to miscount, or how his miscounting came to pass unreproved, when discovered, are questions well worth asking. Such mistakes are not common; nor is it likely that an extraordinary degree of inattentiveness would prevail at such an important moment. I do not pretend to dictate to members of Congress; but, were I one, I would exert my utmost to displace a Clerk who would dare to mistate a vote of the House, though that Clerk should be the very image of <HI>Lord Chalkstone</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Finally, the resolution of Mr. Hillhouse was put, in its original form: <Q>Resolved that the necessary laws be passed for carrying into effect, the trea∣ty concluded between His Britannic Majesty and the United States.</Q>—The <HI>Ayes</HI> and <HI>Noes</HI> were as follows:

<P>The resolution passed, of course, and a commit∣tee was appointed to bring in the bills.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that, to know the re∣al inclinations of the members, be must observe, who voted for the call for papers, and who did not. In the present list of <HI>Ayes,</HI> I have marked in <HI>italicks</HI> those members who voted in favour of Mr. Livingston's <HI>paper motion,</HI> that such as laboured through the heat of the day may be distinguished from such as did not drop in until the eleventh hour.</P>
<P>The Representatives who voted on this memora∣ble question may be divided into three classes: 1. staunch friends of the Constitution and the treaty; 2. the converts; 3. the hardened political sinners.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="030223_0010_0FE52AFAAA3C4568"/>As to the first of these classes I shall say nothing: the persons composing it are so much above all praise, that I could not hope to do them justice. They will find an ample reward in the success of their indefatigable efforts, and in the grateful ac∣knowledgements of all their worthy constituents.</P>
<P>The second class, or the <HI>converts,</HI> merit but lit∣tle thanks from any body. Their apologies for shifting sides were, as, indeed, apologies generally are, a most monstrous abuse of words. What, for instance, could be more ridiculous than for a man to get up and make a long harangue, in or∣der to persuade <HI>others</HI> to vote against the treaty, and conclude with saying that <HI>he</HI> should vote for it?—And why?—Because he would not create a division between the different branches of the go∣vernment! surprising! he had voted for forcing the papers out of the President's hands, he had also voted for the resolution that was to remain as a protest against the President's refusing of these pa∣pers, and, at last, he votes for the treaty in order to cultivate harmony between the different branch∣es of the government! the gentleman seems to have fallen out with the other branches, merely to have the pleasure of making it up again. This farce may, then, take the name of a comedy late∣ly written by a Citizen of Philadelphia: <Q>the tri∣umphs of love; or happy reconciliation.</Q></P>
<P>The fact is, however, this conversion was not owing to a conciliating disposition in the converted. Had it not been for the manly, prudent and well-timed measures of the Merchants of Philadelphia,
<PB N="180" REF="030223_0011_0FE52B5CB8764110"/>
this important treaty would have been set aside.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following memorial was presented to the House on the 17th of April.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Honourable the House of Representatives of the United States. THE MEMORIAL OF THE SUBSCRIBERS Merchants and Traders of Philadelphia,</HEAD>
<OPENER>Respectfully Represents,</OPENER>
<P>THAT they have waited, with anxious expectation, to see the necessary measures adopted by your honourable House for carrying into operation the Treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain, and are now seriously alarmed least those measures should be further delayed or entirely omitted.</P>
<P>Under that impression, they deem it incumbent on them to represent, That the property of the Merchants of the United States, amounting, upon a moderate computation, to more than five millione of dollars, has been taken from them by the subjects of Great Britain, the restitution of which, they verily believe, depends, in a great measure, upon the com∣pletion of the Treaty on our part.</P>
<P>Independent of this immense sum, they have embarked the principal part of their remaining fortunes in vessels and ad∣ventures, the safety of which will, as they apprehend, be materially affected by a refusal or neglect on the part of the United States to comply with stipulations so solemnly entered into. Besides their particular interests as Merchants and Traders, they feel an interest, in common with their fellow citizens of other descriptions, in the preservation of Peace, on which the prosperity of this country depends;—and they should deem themselves wanting in that spirit and indepen∣dence which ought ever to characterize freemen, if they for∣bear, on so interesting on occasion as the present, to express their wishes and expectations. They, therefore, with all due respect for the Representatives of the People of the United States, beg leave to recommend, that no partial considerations of policy may influence their decision on this important que∣stion; but that the Faith, the Honour, and the Interest of the Nation, may be preserved by making the necessary provi∣sions for carrying the Treaty into fair and honourable effect.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Nor did the Merchants of the Capitol stop here: they ap∣pointed a committee to correspond with other mercantile towns, and with the back counties of Pennsylvania. This measure brought such swarms of petitions from the people of property of every quarter of the Union, that the Opposition began to per∣ceive how little their own strength was.</P></NOTE> However indifferent the converts might be to the suspension of insurance and the general shock given to business of every kind; however they might af∣fect to laugh at the alarmists, they would have been afraid to return among their constituents,
<PB N="181" REF="030223_0012_0FE52B9DEC5A5308"/>
had they plunged the country into distress and con∣fusion. Very probably their turn for roasting would have come; they might have seen their effi∣gies dragged about in a dung-cart, with French gold in their hands. Happy might they have thought themselves, if a justly enraged people had confined their vengeance to the burning of images and pictures, when the originals were at hand. Their recantation was, in short, like that of a man who sees the stake and the faggots before him. I look upon their support of government, on the present occasion, as a sort of verbal conformity with a mental reservation. Few people are dupes enough to believe them sincere. The dose they have swallowed with so many wry faces, has only served to set their gall in motion: the executive branch of government may expect at their hands every check and impediment that disappointed ma∣lice can suggest.</P>
<P>But, little merit as I ascribe to the <HI>converts,</HI> and little hope as as I have of their reformation, I
<PB N="182" REF="030223_0013_0FE52B0492908488"/>
must still prefer them to the hardened sinners; for, though a sort of death bed repentance, such for instance, as that of the <HI>casting voice,</HI> can never be supposed to atone for a life of political sin, yet it is at any rate, less offensive to morality and decency, than to hear the sons of reprobation blaspheming to the last gasp, and expiring with curses on their lips.</P>
<P>All the 48 members, found in the opposition on the definitive question concerning the treaty, will unavoidably meet with the approbation of the French National Convention. They all certainly merit the fraternal hug; but there are some of them whom it would be unjust to mix promiscuously with the common herd: these ought to have a kiss on both cheeks, while the rest might be put off with a kiss on one; or, if French politeness will insist upon the <HI>double baises,</HI> to all the five kings might salute the leaders, while the rest might be left to the skinny-lipped blood suckers of the Council of Elders.</P>
<P>In order to regulate the ceremonial, I shall point out those whom I think entitled to the distinguish∣ed honour of being slobbered by the five sultans; observing, once for all, that I do not wish to de∣preciate the value of any man's labour, or interfere with any bargain that might be previously entered into between the parties. The labourer is worthy of his hire, whether he succeeds in his object or not.</P>
<P>To place the <HI>Italian</HI> at the head of these wor∣thies is an act of justice, and an act of justice which I have the more pleasure in performing, as I have lately been accused (how falsely every body
<PB N="183" REF="030223_0014_0FE52B26425561B0"/>
knows) of attempting to sink that gentleman in the opinion of the public.</P>
<P>When the treaty-making power was to be attack∣ed; or, in other words, when a breach was to be made in the Constitution, and such a breach as ne∣ver could have been closed, the assailants seemed at a loss for a leader. Citizen M—son shrank from the task. The eyes of the phalanx at last turned towards the <HI>Italian.</HI> Murderers, when preparing for their horrid work, always choose, from among their gang, some preciously ill-looking villain to give the first stab; that done, they fall on with less remorse, and dispatch the prostrate victim. I do not pretend to say, that the assailants of the Constitution acted upon the same maxims of phy∣siognomy: no, God forbid I should say or insinu∣ate any such thing: on the contrary, if person had any thing to do in the matter, I should rather suppose that the leader was chosen for his beauty.</P>
<P>Let, however, the motive to the choice be what it might, that it was a good one we all know. With what art did the <HI>Genevese</HI> approach! how did he twist and turn, when he found an obstacle in his way! how did his eyes glisten, when ready to dart in upon his devoted prey! Those that fol∣lowed him had little more to do than to mouth over what they had heard, as the yelping puppies of the pack give tongue, when they hear the cry of the leading old hound.</P>
<Q><L>"—The <HI>stanch old hound,</HI></L>
<L>"Guide of the pack, <HI>although gaunt and ugly,</HI></L>
<L>"Is yet of great account. He'll oft' untie</L>
<L>"The Gordian knot, when reason at a stand,</L>

<L><HI>"As party chiefs</HI> in senates who preside</L>
<L><PB N="184" REF="030223_0015_0FE52BA74BEA2FA8"/>"With pleaded reason and with artful speech</L>
<L>"Conduct the staring multitude, <HI>so he</HI></L>
<L>"Directs the pack, <HI>who with</HI> joint cry approve,</L>
<L>"<HI>And loudly</HI> boast discoveries not their own."</L></Q>
<P>Had SOMERVILLE written his beautiful poem of <HI>The Chace</HI> but yesterday, with the late proceedings of the House of Representatives before his eyes, he could not have made a more apt allusion than is contained in the above quoted passage. The rest did, indeed, with joint cry approve, and loudly boast discoveries not their own; but the sagacious
and indefatigable <HI>Genevese</HI> untied the Gordian knot; and, though his game at last escaped him, he is en∣titled to all the honours of the field. The grateful sportsman, to reward his faithful and laborious cur, claps him on the back and spits in his mouth. And so out <HI>Italian</HI> shall be distinguished from his collea∣gues, by some superior reward.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Genevese,</HI> I think we must give the pre∣cedence to the <HI>Long-man</HI> from New York and the <HI>Short-man</HI> from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>From the first of these, who labours under an ex∣treme poverty of talents, much could not be ex∣pected. His head is generally thought to be as empty as his purse ever was; yet, he certainly sur∣passed all his fellow labourers, except the cunning <HI>Italian.</HI> He set out with <HI>blushing,</HI> and I leave any one to guess at the efforts that must be made to get a blush through a skin like his. Besides, where will you find a young man of his pretentions, a kind of creole <HI>Adonis,</HI> as it were, who would risk his complexion for a single moment? who would suffer his pure yellow, his fine golden hue, to be
<PB N="185" REF="030223_0016_0FE52B3B5B323438"/>
mixed with red, and thus debased to a vile copper-colour? who would, in short, suffer himself to be changed from a guinea to a half-penny? I do not know whether the gentleman has been <HI>accustomed to such depreciations</HI> or not; but, if this be the first time, such a sacrifice is, in my humble opinion, worthy of a capital compensation.</P>
<P>I did not intend to trouble the reader with re∣marks on any particular passages of this gentlemans' speeches: they are generally such strings of plagiar∣isms, that, to censure them, you must censure their authors, and this is sometimes disagreeable. One passage or two, however, call for observation; which I am the more ready to bestow on them, as they appear to be original.</P>
<P>The gentleman, in defence of his <HI>paper motion,</HI> told the House, that <Q>it was impossible to deter∣mine that they would not <HI>impeach,</HI> until the pa∣pers were seen. Facts might then appear, which would render that an unavoidable measure which was not now contemplated. If, for instance, instead of a treaty with Great Britain, they were now discusing one formed with the Porte, where it is the custom for Ministers to give and to re∣ceive <HI>presents;</HI> and, on the production of the correspondence, it should appear that our Mini∣ster had received a <HI>douceur</HI> (bribe) on the signa∣ture of the treaty; would not the House think themselves obliged to impeach?</Q></P>
<P>This is a supposition, wound up with an interro∣gation. Now, let us see if we cannot suppose and put questions as well as this <HI>Adonis.</HI>—Suppose, then, that the electors of a certain district or city were
<PB N="186" REF="030223_0017_0FE52B068392AC40"/>
silly enough to choose, as their representative, a man at once proud and poor, haughty and mean, insolent and crawling; suppose that this man were an insolvent debtor, who had visited the inside of a jail, and who had bilked his creditors by paying them but <HI>three shillings in the pound.</HI> Now, should a man like this rise up in Congress, and, adopting the sentiments, the style and even the gesticulations of the mob, basely insinuate, that a public Minister, of unspotted fame, had received a <HI>bribe</HI> from a fo∣reign prince; what, I ask, would such a man de∣serve?—To be cut out, at full length, in a <HI>Living Stone,</HI> and stuck up at the corner of the <HI>Fly-Market,</HI> for the boys to throw rotten eggs at, till the statue became as yellow as the original.</P>
<P>The gentleman declared (and <HI>very sincerely,</HI> with∣out doubt) that his supposition was by no means applicable to Mr. Jay; and I declare, with equal sincerity, that my supposition is by no means appli∣cable to Mr. Livingston, for whose feelings, as the reader must have already perceived, I have a won∣derful tenderness; a tenderness, indeed, that I would wish to equal that which he has shown for the feelings of the President and Mr. Jay.</P>
<P>The next passage that attracts my attention seems to be a sort of side wind eulogy on the five kings and their mild and humane government. <Q>All Europe says our <HI>Adonis,</HI> was once free; all Europe, with the <HI>exception of France</HI> and Swit∣zerland <HI>are now in chains.</HI> Where then, will historical facts be found to justify the charge? In the obsequious Parliament of Britain?</Q> &amp;c.— Poor <HI>Adonis</HI> how little does he know about all Eu∣rope!—and is it possible that any one, pretending
<PB N="187" REF="030223_0018_0FE52BA8CD776340"/>
to be a reasonable creature, should yet talk to us about French liberty? a decree launched forth by their merciful lords, the other day, will give us a pretty correct idea of Frenchmens' freedom. This decree bears: <Q>that the parents of Emigrants shall <HI>now</HI> give up to <HI>the nation</HI> that portion of their property, which <HI>would have fallen,</HI> after their death, to their Emigrant children.</Q> Let any one judge from this, whether the poor devils are <HI>in chains</HI> or not. But, why do I cite particu∣lar instances of their slavery! what occasion have I here to attempt a contradiction of what every one, even the most ignorant of the people, knows to be false and ridiculous? "In Turkey, and in Morocco" says PLYFAIR, <Q>the people know under what despotism they groan; they know who their rulers are, and they know that whatever injustice they may be guilty of towards individuals, they must have some regard to the general interest, to the preservation of the whole. They have the satisfaction too of complaining to a friend in se∣cret of their misfortunes; but <HI>the miserable French slave,</HI> who thinks himself a <HI>free citizen,</HI> does not know who his masters are. He dares not com∣plain, because all around him consider that their miseries are the effects of freedom and philoso∣phy, and like the Philosopher Pangloss, though ruined and miserable, they have been taught to say, that all is as well as possible.—Wretched people among whom every thing is at the dis∣position of a gang of intriguing despots, who, by means of a printing press and reams of Assig∣nats, pillage the nation, and excite to massacre and bloodshed.</Q>—This is the only people in Eu∣rope who, our <HI>Adonis</HI> tells us, is not in chains! I can assure him, that such an assertion, at this day,
<PB N="188" REF="030223_0019_0FE52B623B7008B0"/>
is barely honoured with a sneer. The people of America have at last opened their eyes. They have seen French liberty seated on her throne, the guil∣lotine, surrounded with confiscations, guards, man∣acles and dungeons; they have seen French religion exhibited in blasphemies against the Almighty and in the adoration of a common prostitute; they have seen French humanity in the form of a child torn from its mothers womb and writing on the point of a bayonet. Yes, and they have seen the effects of French gold too, and I can tell you Mr. Living∣ston, that they despise the corruptor as well as the corrupted. French friendship they know they do not want, and French enmity is become the object of their contempt.—To ply them then, Sir, with this old, ridiculous, thread bare tale of French liberty, though it may procure you a <HI>feu de joie</HI> from the hulks at New York, is an insult to the understandings of your constituents, for which I much question if even your ignorance will be thought a sufficient apology.</P>
<P>But, it seems, there is one other nation, besides the French, who are <HI>not in chains;</HI> the Swiss.—It is something singular that our orator forgot the re∣publics of <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Geneva.</HI> They have both the happiness of having the same kind of free go∣vernment as his dear France. Their legislative and executive branches, and all their offices of state, excepting the prime minister, Citizen Guillo∣tine, are the same. What then, could render them unworthy of being called free nations! how comes Switzerland, the best part of which <HI>groans</HI> under an Aristocracy, to be prefered to these regenerated states, these apes of the French republic, these first

born of the great Baboon?—Our <HI>Adonis's</HI> head was absolutely turned with his paper-kite motion.</P>
<P>Never surely was poor youth so discomfitted, scouted and routed as he has been during this ses∣sion. After a months hard labour, the President refuses him a peep at the papers; he seeks venge∣ance, meets a second rebuff, and is at last, reduced to the mortification of seeing the schemes of nine long months overturned in a single moment, in spite of the counter efforts of his <HI>worthy</HI> relations, at New York, joined to those of Chocolate grinder and Serjeant Cl—ke. In this situation what is he to do!—Jog back quietly to daddy's, make the most of his personal charms, ogle the fair sex in place of grinning at General Washington, and con∣tent himself with reading billets doux instead of state papers. But, for mercy's sake, let him take care how he <HI>blushes:</HI> "the <HI>bankrupt,</HI>" says an au∣thor "never yet found the fair one kind;" and what then could he expect for a yellow boy who should blush himself to Jersey copper?</P>
<P>Having thus dismissed the long raw boned Knight of the <HI>Woful countenance,</HI> I must now beg the rea∣ders respectful attention, while I bring on the scene probably for the last time the little duck legged Squire.—There he is, like a balled singer in a fair! don't fright yourselves, Ladies; upon my soul he'll do you no violence. 'Tis as gentle a little creature as you ever set eyes on: you may even stroke him without apprehending the lest mischief; do but list∣en to his speech, and he'll lick your hand like a spaniel.</P>
<P>This gentlemans' efforts on the opposition may be considered as confined to the exaltation of the
<PB N="190" REF="030223_0021_0FE52B63C1A6A738"/>
<HI>magnanimity of the king of Spain,</HI> and that of <HI>his own disinterestedness.</HI> Indeed, both subjects were equally worthy of his small talk eloquence. The magnanimity of a man, who shakes hands, in an humble peace, with the murderers of the head of his family, is well matched with the disinterested∣ness of another, who aims at the destruction of his country, or at least, of all that is valuable in it, that he may raise himself on its ruins.</P>
<P>He told the House, that <Q>he had several vessels at sea, not insured; that he had landed property in great quantity,</Q> and hence he took occasion to conclude, that he could not be suspected as wish∣ing to involve the country in a war. This indeed, from a man of moderate views, from a man of mo∣derate vanity even, ought to have some weight; but, from one like the person here spoken of, it ought to have none at all.</P>
<P>There are some men, who as the poet says, <Q>never are at hearts ease, while they see a greater than themselves.</Q> Such is this gentleman. He must be every where, and every where at the head; and, as it commonly happens with those of his stamp, nature has absolutely disqualified him for the attainment by fair means. Still, however, he drives on towards his object, and in his progress em∣ploys all those little arts that worth and genius dis∣dain. How has he laboured to establish for himself the character of a man of learning and taste! how often and how barefacedly has he condescended to become his own puff in the common papers! how many letters has he written to distant places to insure the insertion of articles in praise of himself! what incredible pains has he taken to procure the
<PB N="191" REF="030223_0022_0FE52B44AD88FB80"/>
appearance of a silly poem, signed with his name, in a periodical publication of a foreign country!</P>
<P>He told the House of Representatives of his ships and his lands; he might have told them of his <HI>house</HI> too, unless indeed, he looked upon that as unne∣cessary, from its being so perfectly known. This house, which resembles in furniture a Dutch virtu∣oso's baby hutch, is become a kind of rareeshow. The vain proprietor acts the part of a despicable showman. This house-that-Jack-built is his hobby horse, and when mounted on it, he is more an ob∣ject of ridicule than the whore on the black ram, or poor Gulliver astride the nipple of the Brabding∣nagian maid of honour.</P>
<P>Money however he has, and with this he finds his way into almost every meeting that bears the name of a <HI>society,</HI> a name, by the by, of which most men of sense begin to be heartily tired. Our Lilliputian, with his dollars, gets access where, without them, he would not be suffered to appear. But, of all his little baits for admiration and con∣sequence, none is surely so perfectly ludicrous as his becoming the Mentor of the <HI>little misses.</HI> That a vain man should condescend to cajole the mob, to grease the hands of the leaders of a club or society, that he should crawl to news-printers, or even run dangling about after spectators to advance his tasty mansion, is not so very surprising: but that he should so far defy the power of ridicule as to profess himself the periodical declaimer at the breakings-up of a boarding school, and even show an uncommon anxiety to have his speeches on those occasions pub∣lished, is what no mortal could ever have expected, no, not from John Swanwick.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="030223_0023_0FE52B6545561AA8"/>What attention is due to a man like this, when he produces the coincidence of his own interest with that of his own country as a proof that his conduct is in conformity to both? such a man feels interested in nothing that does not bring food to his vanity, and if a greater quantity of this is to be obtained by the loss of his property than by its pre∣vention, he will never scruple to hazard it; Where then, is his disinterestedness, and his patriotism?</P>
<P>At first glance, one would imagine that a being like this was formed for the contempt, or, at least, for the diversion of mankind; and, under certain governments, he would, indeed, be harmless; but, in a state where all depends upon the popular voice, I do not know a more dangerous character. Of a proud man you have some hold; his pride will not let him stoop to such meannesses, by which alone he can come at the power that makes him formidable; while the vain one will stop at nothing. Knowing that the accomplishments of his hopes depends on the people and that it is to numbers he must owe his success, he speculates in their errors and their prejudices, and turns them to his own advantage at the expence of the community. No rebuss. no ill treatment or discomfit discourages him: kick him out at your front door, and he will come in at the back: drive him from one office of one as∣sembly, and he will get into another: some where he will be, where he can make himself talked of. He is ever the cringing slave of power: he adores it in whatever hands it may be found: as he wheedles a democratic populace, so would he the cruelest despot on earth; he has not a drop of independent blood in his heart, and he is the mortal enemy of all those who have.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="030223_0024_0FE52BB6D977C680"/>That such a man as this should be the represen∣tative of a State of which I am an inhabitant, is, I must confess a mortification; as to representing me, however, he never did, nor shall he ever do it: therefore, as a fraction of the sovereign people, I do hereby, once for all, enter my protest against every thing that he may do, or have a hand in. When he looks round, from his hobby-horse, on the multitude who have been weak enough to com∣mit their interests to his sapient head and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heart, let him remember, that there is one who would not trust him with the stump of an old worn out pen.</P>
<P>When I see people, who have chosen a represen∣tative like this, brought to the verge of ruin by him and his associates, I cannot say I pity them. Many of the Merchants and traders who were so alarmed the other day, on account of the oppositi∣on to the treaty, had used every effort in their power to insure this man's election. What must be their reflections, when they saw him, not only voting for the destruction of their property and themselves, but endeavouring to nullify their peti∣tion by another, signed by foreigners, blackguards and negroes? Surely this ought to be a lesson to those, who are to choose or reject him another time. But, indeed, men of property, men who ought to be of weight, are in this country, as in most others, indifferent and slothful as to their po∣litical rights. Whatever may be the cause of this, the consequences are well known, they are already felt, and will from day to day and from year to year be felt more severely.</P>
<P>Thus, I have endeavoured to justify the prefer∣ence to be given to these three heroes of the <HI>hard∣ened

The firm and <HI>indivisible</HI> phalanx of Virginia were led on by a younger, more bold and more artful comman∣der; had victory decided in their favour, the Ci∣tizen would have put in his claim to a share in the glory of the day; but the timely desertion of the <HI>heavy horse</HI> of Philadelphia, and the disgraceful de∣feat that succeded, has left him without even the hope of repairing his reputation.

<P>There are, then, but three of these gentlemen whom I look upon as entitled to the <HI>collade frater∣nelle</HI> from the five kings; the others must put up with a smack from the <HI>elders</HI> or <HI>youngers.</HI></P>
<P>There is one difficulty remaining, which it will not be very easy to get over; that is, the parties are at such a distance from each other, that to embrace in person would be impossible, unless one or the other would be content to make a voyage; a thing which we cannot expect, for, like the buz∣zard, neither likes to lose sight of their prey. 'Tis true, that, in France, they do embrace by proxy, and probably this may be now resorted to. We can very well spare a deputation, and if they should never return, few, I believe, would mourn their loss.</P>
<P>I now bid the opposers of the treaty farewel: they and I have been at war for rather better than a year; I have seen them completely beaten, and though I pretend to no other merit than the little

<HEAD>PAINE'S AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The</HI> Christian Religion teaches men to forego their private interests for the sake of doing good, it is not therefore surprising, that deists and atheists should forego their private interests for the sake of doing mischief. Things opposite in their nature must be expected to be opposite in their effects.</P>
<P>The Editor of the <HI>Aurora</HI> of Philadelphia (Mr. Franklin Bache) has advertised for sale a second part of Paine's Age of Reason, at a <HI>low price.</HI> It is said, he has received <HI>fifteen thousand</HI> copies of this from Paris, and it is very certain that he sells them at a price which will hardly pay first cost and expences. When I went to school, I re∣member we had for a copy: <Q>Zeal <HI>in a</HI> good cause <HI>deserves</HI> applause.</Q> If this old maxim be a true one, I would ask; what <HI>zeal</HI> in a <HI>bad cause</HI> deserves?</P>
<P>A person, to whom the parties were well known has assured me, that poor Paine imbibed his first principles of deism of Doctor Franklin; if so, it is possible that the Editor of the <HI>Aurora</HI> may look upon the distribution of the Age of Reason as a means of propagating his Grand Father's princi∣ples, and so far <HI>some persons</HI> will defend it, as an
<PB N="196" REF="030223_0027_0FE52B0A0C626518"/>
act of filial piety, or rather filial gratitude, for as to piety I think we may venture to leave it out of the question.</P>
<P>This grateful young man should, however, re∣collect that a vender of poison will not be excused merely because the compound was kneaded up, or the receipt for it given, by his ancestor. Deism cannot be well said to run in the blood, or I should really be afraid, that the decendant of the illustri∣ous old deist was contaminated. Charity bids me to hope the contrary, and to ascribe the excess of his zeal to the amiable motive above mentioned.</P>
<P>It is going too far, perhaps, to say, that any loss on these blasphemous pamphlets is to fall on Mr. Bache, The French republic has ever shown a sincere desire of regenerating us, and as she finds us obstinate in politics, she may be willing to try her hand in another way. The papers have told us lately, that Mad Tom takes up his lodgings at the House of the American Embassador; if this se∣cond part of the Age of Reason should have come to us under his auspices, it is a fact of a curious na∣ture indeed.</P>
<P>As to the work itself, it cannot be better descri∣ed than by saying that it is as stupid and dispicable as its author. The wretch has all his life been employed in leading fools astray from their duty, and, as nothing is more easy, he has often succeed∣ed. His religion is exactly of a piece with his po∣litics; one inculcates the right of revolting against government, and the other that of revoking against God. Having succeeded against the Lord's anoint∣ed (I mean his and our <HI>ci-devant</HI> friend the most
<PB N="197" REF="030223_0028_0FE52B6BACD4AF40"/>
Christian king) he turned his impious arms against the Lord himself. This process is perfectly natu∣ral, as has been exemplified in the conduct of others as well as that of Paine.</P>
<P>How Tom came to think of exercising his clum∣sy battered pen upon the Christian Religion is what has excited a good deal of curiosity, without ever being well accounted for in this country; notwith∣standing, the circumstances under which a man writes ought to be attended to in forming a judg∣ment of his opinions, particularly if those opinions are new and extraordinary. For this reason, I shall endeavour to trace this raggamuffin deist from A∣merica to his Paris dungeon, and to account for his having laid down the dagger of insurrection in order to take up the chalice of irreligion.</P>
<P>Thomas, after having retailed out a good deal of very <HI>Common Sense</HI> commonly called <HI>Nonsense,</HI> found himself rather richer than when he began.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his second Part of the Rights of Man, he says he has a <HI>place</HI> in the State of Delaware. Whether this be a lye or not I cannot tell; but, if it be true, it was certainly the product of the revolution; for every one knows he had nothing before. This was encouragement for him to try his talent in other coun∣tries. A confiscated castle in France, or some Abbey where he might join sacrilege to robbery, was a sufficient temptation to lead him across the ocean.</NOTE> This gave him a smack for revolutions; but find∣ing himself sinking fast into his native mud, and pretty universally despised and neglected by the people of this country: finding, in short, that the Americans were returning to order, and feeling that his element was confusion, he crossed the At∣lantic to bask in the rays of the French revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="030223_0029_0FE52AE953A89BA8"/>The <HI>Propagande</HI> at Paris, that is, the society in∣stituted for the propagation of the vile and detesta∣ble principles of the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> as laid down in the famous French Constitution, fixed their Ja∣cobinical eyes on Tom, as an excellent missionary for great Britain and Ireland. Off goes Tom with his Rights of Man, which he had the abominable impudence to dedicate to <HI>General Washington.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Second Part</HI> was dedicated to <HI>Lafayette,</HI> to which no∣body had any kind of objection.</NOTE> The English Jacobins stared at him at first: he went a step further than they had ever dreamed of: his doctrines, however, grew familiar to their ears: they took him under their wing, and he made sure of another revolution. This security was his misfortune, and had nearly cost him a voyage to the South Sea.</P>
<P>From the thief-catchers in England Tom fled, and took his seat among the thieves of Paris. Af∣ter having distinguished himself in execrating the Constitution he had written in defence of, he, and two or three others, set to work and made a new one; quite brand new, without a single ounce of old stuff. This covered Tom with glory soon after, when it was unanimously accepted by the rich, free, generous and <HI>humane</HI> French nation.</P>
<P>This may be looked upon as the happiest part of Tom's life. He had enjoyed partial revolts before, had seen doors and windows broken in, and had probably partaken of the pillage of some aristocra∣tic stores and dwelling houses; but, to live in a continual state of insurrection, <Q>sacred, holy, or∣ganized insurrection;</Q> to sit seven days in the week issuing decrees for plunder, proscription and
<PB N="199" REF="030223_0030_0FE52B9628D1EBB0"/>
massacre, was a luxurious life indeed! It was, how∣ever, a short life and a merry one: it lasted but five months. The tender-hearted philanthropic murderer, Brissot, and his faction, fell from the pinnacle of their glory: poor Tom's wares got out of vogue and his carcass got into a dungeon.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful reverse for old Common Sense. To be hurled, all in a moment, from the tip top of the <HI>Mountain</HI> of the <HI>Grande Convention Nationale</HI> down to the very bottom of a stinking dungeon, was enough to give a shock to his poor unsteady brain. But this was not all; he well knew that the national razor was at work, and had every reason to suppose that his days were num∣bered. He laid extended on the dirt like a sheep or a calf in a slaughter-house, expecting every mo∣ment that the Butcher would come for him.</P>
<P>How Thomas came to escape is something that will probably remain a mistery. It was said, that <HI>Danton</HI> (the new chief tyrant) spared his life at the request of certain Americans; but this is impro∣bable, not that some Americans might be found silly enough to petition for it, but because, when his enlargement was afterwards demanded upon the score of his being an American, the ruling tyrants answered, that he was a <HI>sacré Anglois,</HI> a d—nd Englishman. The fact is, I believe, Dan∣ton and his party despised Tom too much to run any risk of disobliging their friends in Great Bri∣tain and America by taking away his worthless life. Be the motive what it might, he was kept in his cage, and there he wrote the first part of his <HI>Age of Reason.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="030223_0031_0FE52B6FA72B5418"/>Now to the motive that led him to the compo∣sition of this blasphemous work; which was no other than that of saving his ugly uncombed head from the guillotine.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that it was under the reign of <HI>Danton</HI> that the Christian Religion was abolished by a decree. A few days before Tom's imprisonment the famous festival of Reason was held. A common strumpet was dressed up as the <HI>Goddess Reason,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She was guillotined soon after.</NOTE> seated on a throne of turf, and, while incense was burnt before her altar at some little distance, the idolatrous populace, with the Convention at their head, prostrated themselves before her. Not many days before this, the <HI>consti∣tutional</HI> Bishop of Paris,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>The</HI> constitutional <HI>clergy means the</HI> new clergy, <HI>the</HI> clergy of the revolution, the apostates.</NOTE> with his vicars and three rectors, came to the Convention and and ab∣dicated their religion, declaring themselves to have been cheats, and that in future they would profess no other worship than that of <HI>Reason.</HI> In short, <HI>Danton,</HI> and <HI>Robespierre</HI> (then second in command) were incessantly occupied in extirpating the small remains of Christianity from the minds of the poor brutified and enslaved French. It was a necessary preparation to the bloody work they intended they should execute.</P>
<P>Citizen Common Sense knew this, and therefore it was not wonderful that he should attempt to soft∣en his lot, and prolong, perhaps, his miserable days, by something from his pen, calculated at once to flatter their vanity and further their exe∣crable views. Thomas had long railed against the baseness of courtiers, but when the moment of tri∣al
<PB N="201" REF="030223_0032_0FE52B47B06C8BA0"/>
came he was found as base as the basest. The high-minded republican Paine, who had set Lords and Kings at defiance, was glad to bend the knee before a vile low-bred French pettifogger. He de∣scended to make use of the very phrases that the new tyrants had introduced. The Goddess was called <HI>Reason,</HI> the church which was profaned by her worship was called the <HI>Temple of Reason,</HI> and the inscription on the banners carried at the festival was <HI>"The Age of Reason"</HI> (Le siecle de la Raison) the very title of Tom's book. Base adulation! adu∣lation not to be excused even by the situation in which he was. The old French clergy, with the dagger at their breasts, scorned to purchase life at such a price.</P>
<P>I would by no means be understood as believ∣ing that Paine's book was a desertion of his prin∣ciples; for, as I before observed, he had been cor∣rupted years before. It is the disgraceful motive for publishing his creed that I am exposing. That it was done to make his court to the tyrants of the day cannot be doubted; for, in all his former works, if he has occasion to speak of the Christian religion, he does it in decent if not respectful lan∣guage. In his Rights of Man, for instance, he extols toleration, and observes, that <HI>all religions are good;</HI> but as soon as he got into his new-fashioned study, a dungeon, he discovered that <HI>they were all bad,</HI> or at least the Christian Religion, and it was of the divers denominations of that religion that he before <HI>pretended</HI> to speak. When he said, that all religions were good, he was an abominable hypo∣crite, or he is one now, when he tells us that the Christian Religion is a very bad one. Either he disguised his sentiments to deceive the English, or he has since done so to deceive <HI>Danton</HI> and <HI>Robe∣spierre.</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="030223_0023_0FE52B6545561AA8"/>
Tom knows the value of a character for consistency too well to run the risk of losing it un∣less upon a pressing emergency: but, the guillotine was yet red with the blood of his comrades, and he well knew that there was but this one way of keeping his own corrupted streams within his veins.</P>
<P>It will be said, by Tom's deistical Friends, that the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the Age of Reason was written after his releasement, and at a time when he was in no danger. Very true; but the die was cast; the <HI>First Part</HI> was out, and there was no recalling it. He had openly attacked both heaven and earth; he could do no more. One essay at blasphemy was as good as a thousand for establishing his new pre∣tensions to infamy; but Thomas had now some∣thing else to attend to besides his reputation; I mean his belly. The usual means of subsistence had failed: he was no longer a <HI>great</HI> Representa∣tive of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> people. The handful of assignats he received daily were gone to some more staunch patriot, and the old Rights of Man was left to dine where he could. As to political drugs Thomas's were grown out of vogue in France as much as they now are in this country: his consti∣tution was declared to be the most stupid perform∣ance that ever issued from a sick brain, and its author fell into discredit as rapidly as he had risen to fame.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Insurrection, revolution, constitution,</HI> a knowledge in all these seems to be a necessary qualification in a professor of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> Tom Paine understood the first perfectly well, he had a smattering of the second, but as to the third he was, and, if alive is, totally ignorant.</NOTE> Among thousands of others, he experi∣enced the sudden change in the opinions of the vo∣latile Parisians: from being a sort of demi-god he was become the most degraded thing in nature, a
<PB N="203" REF="030223_0034_0FE52AEB12FD5400"/>
poor, half-starved despised pretender to renown. Besides, the constitution that was now coming into play, with a council of youngers and a council of elders and five kings, elected by <HI>people of some pro∣perty,</HI> or, at least, some <HI>qualification,</HI> was what Tom never could defend with his right of univer∣sal suffrage and continual insurrection, and, for once, he had the prudence to hold his tongue.</P>
<P>Tom's fate in France was nearly what it had been in America; when it was no longer necessary to employ him he sunk into neglect. Happy if he could have ceased eating when his insurrection ta∣lents became useless; but as he could not, he must continue to write, and as he was in a country where he was permitted to revile none but the Al∣mighty, the Almighty he reviled.

<P>Those who prefer a few years of life to every thing else, may find an excuse for this degraded man: it is impossible for any of us to say how we should act at the foot of the guillotine. But, what shall be said to those, who, pressed by neither dan∣ger nor want, make uncommon exertions to spread his infamous performance among the ignorant part of their countrymen, and thereby sow in their minds the seeds of vice inquietude, and despair? Again; deists may find some apology for doing this; but who will dare to become the apologist of those book-sellers, who, professors of the Christian faith, throw out this bait of blasphemy to catch un∣wary comers, and, smiling at their simplicity, pock∣et

Such men (and they are but too numerous) are like the Hollander on the coast of Japan, who, to outstrip others in trade with the natives, tramples on the cross of his Saviour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know a printer and book-seller who has taken, for his sign, the picture of the blasphemer Paine. This undoubtedly is to inform the <HI>amateurs</HI> of insurrection and infidelity that they may be supplied within. It is no more than fair to impute this intention to him who hangs out such a sign. When <HI>Caterfelto</HI> placed the picture of the Devil over his door, it was to inform people that hell was to be seen in the house.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall here take the liberty of adding an ex∣tract from an address, delivered by <HI>Judge Rush</HI> to the Grand Jury of the County of Berks, with which I shall dismiss this article.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Christianity,</HI> we are told by our law books, is <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>law</HI> of the <HI>land;</HI> and as such a Judge may at <HI>any time,</HI> without stepping aside from the path of duty, il∣lustrate its precepts and enforce its evidences. It must therefore be particularly incumbent on him at <HI>this time,</HI> when deism is daily venting itself in ambiguous hints or sneers, or openly attacking religion with shallow ar∣gument.</P>
<P>To the native growth of infidelity among us, it is more than possible, augmentations may have been made, in consequence of our admiration of a certain great na∣tion in Europe, more especially as a member of the late convention in that country (generally supposed to have been actuated by an uncommon zeal for the Rights of Man,") availing himself of his literary re∣putation, has by an attempt to overthrow all religion, indirectly endeavoured to justify their blasphemous measures to extirpate it. It is really astonishing, Gentle∣men, that a man who calls himself a patriot, should strive to undermine religion, the <HI>only foundation</HI> of govern∣ment and morality. The penetrating genius of Mont∣esquieu,
<PB N="205" REF="030223_0036_0FE52BB85B954F50"/>
taught him to entertain sentiments very differ∣ent from those of the "Age of Reason." Having compared the effects on society produced by different religions, and examined them <HI>merely</HI> in a political light; what is the decision? "The principles of christianity," says he, "deeply engraved on the heart, would be in∣finitely more powerful than the false honour of mo∣narchies, the humane virtues of Republics, or the ser∣vile fear of despotic states." The vast comprehensive mind of the great Bacon, saw the subject in the same point of view. "There never was found," says this profound philosopher, "in any age of the world, ei∣ther philosophy, or sect, or religion, or law, a disci∣pline which did so highly exalt the public good, as the <HI>christian faith.</HI></P>
<P>I have already, Gentlemen, consumed more time than I intended, and shall therefore instantly close with a single observation.</P>
<P>If the great duties of truth and justice, and the purest precepts of morality; if the most exalted bene∣volence and unbounded humanity; if sincerity, candor meekness, magnanimity, gentleness, and forgiveness of injuries, have a native tendency to improve the heart, and diffuse peace, order, and happiness among man∣kind, and are <HI>strictly enjoined</HI> by the Christian religion, as <HI>indispensable conditions</HI> of obtaining the favour of the Deity; what must we think of the writer, who has exerted his talents to <HI>lessen</HI> our motives, or <HI>enfeeble</HI> our obligations to the practice of these benificent and god∣like virtues?</P>
<P>Save us, gracious Heaven, from <HI>such patriots,</HI> and the <HI>extension of their baneful principles among us!</HI></P></Q>
<P>I am sure the reader will join with me in admir∣ing this extract, and applauding the man by whom it was delivered. How different his conduct from that of those who are employed in sending the poi∣son of the Frenchified English desperado!</P>

<P>SOME time after this little tribute to the memo∣ry of the great Paine was sent me (which was about three months ago) it was reported, that the person, whose deeds it is intended to commemorate, was still living.

<P>With all due deference to your better judg∣ment, I presume, that the report concerning Paine can be no reason for delaying the publication of his Epitaph. He has long since given up the ghost as a politician; of this our present incer∣titude respecting his natural death is a clear, and for him, humiliating proof: who would once have thought, that the time would come when it would be unknown whether the great Rights of Man was in existence or not! being then as∣sured that he is politically dead, it is of little con∣sequence whether his person has survived his fame, whether his carcase be under ground, or

<L>WHEN the wight, who here lies beneath the cold earth,</L>

<L>He commenc'd the apostle of bloodshed and strife,</L>

<HEAD>FRENCH GENEROSITY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>On</HI> the 27th of April last, there appeared, in the Philadelphia Gazette, an order, said to be is∣sued by the French Convention (I lump the five kings and council of old ones and council of young ones all together) to the commanders of their privateers, concerning the papers of Mr. <HI>Spillard,</HI> the famous traveller. The person who sends this article to <HI>Mr. Brown,</HI> requests him to publish it, as <Q><HI>it will be acceptable to</HI> every friend of the French na∣tion, <HI>and of</HI> useful discoveries.</Q></P>
<P>Before we say any thing about the order itself, we ought to observe, that it is published to give
<PB N="209" REF="030223_0040_0FE52B80C5404CA0"/>
pleasure to the friends of the French, by extolling French <HI>generosity.</HI> The friends of <HI>useful discoveries</HI> too are to be obliged, and the paragraphist seems to hint, that those who are friends of the latter must be of the former. I must allow that the French have made several <HI>new</HI> discoveries, as, for instance, forced-loans, assignats, the maximum, requisitions, revolutionary tribunals, festivals to Reason, drowning boats, shooting <HI>en masse,</HI> and the renowned guillotine. While <HI>Spillard</HI> has been employed in exploring the back parts of America, the French have been employed in exploring both back and belly parts of the human body: they have been cutting off the breasts of women and secrets of men; they have been tearing out the heart from the breast and the embryo from the womb. These are certainly discoveries; but, I imagine, the "friends of France" alone will think them "use∣ful" ones.</P>
<P>Now to the <HI>generous</HI> order. After having run on a long while, in the usual bombastical cant of the Convention (but with <HI>less vaunting</HI> than former∣ly) the order says:</P>
<Q><P>As a philosophical traveller, he knew the chances of war: he knew how <HI>formidable the cou∣rage of the French was.</HI> By venturing on sea to reach his country, he undoubtedly puts his con∣fidence in the <HI>generosity</HI> of a <HI>great republic,</HI> found∣ed upon the love of <HI>virtue,</HI> the <HI>sciences</HI> and <HI>arts.</HI></P>
<P>No, <HI>Spillard's</HI> hope shall not be in vain, and to have recapitulated here his interesting labours, is sufficient to be convinced of the readiness of his captors to assist the views of the government. That is a debt which they will acquit in the name of the republic, a <HI>great lesson</HI> which they
<PB N="210" REF="030223_0041_0FE52B1C4D495630"/>
will give <HI>to our enemies,</HI> and a great claim to the glory which they will acquire; for a <HI>good action</HI> deserves as much as a great victory.</P></Q>
<P>The Convention could not, all at once, leave off their old style. We must yet be dunned with the <HI>formidableness of French courage;</HI> and poor <HI>Spil∣lard</HI> must be called a <HI>philosopher,</HI> a name now sy∣nonymous, with cut-throats. They must yet keep up their cant about a <HI>great republic,</HI> and their love of <HI>virtue</HI> and of the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>sciences.</HI> We have, indeed, seen some few instances of the force of their genius, and of their application, in the <HI>discoveries</HI> above ennumerated; but how long is it, I would be glad to know, since they have become the pa∣trons and protectors of the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>sciences?</HI></P>
<P>I have a book lying before me from which I shall here borrow a sact or two. The library at Aney was crammed into hogsheads; at Narbonne the books were sent to the Arsenal; at Fontaine le Di∣jon the library of the Fuillants was thrown aside as waste paper. Many of the libraries of Monks contained editions printed in the first days of the art of printing; books, sold in France for a few crowns, were sold in London for 125 guineas. A clock <HI>en malachite</HI> was sold for a trifle, though the only one existing. They mutilated or destroyed all the famous statues, one in particular that cost 200,000 livres. At Pont Mousson, a large picture, which con∣noisseurs offered to cover with guineas as its price, was sold for less than two. At Nancy, in the space of a few hours, they broke and burned to the value of 100,000 crowns in books and pictures. At Lyons 800 antique medals of gold were thrown in∣to the crucible. The antiquities of Arles were de∣stroyed to come at salt-petre.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="030223_0042_0FE52B54C86A8E68"/>One member of this Vandal Convention proposed to destroy the portal of St. Denis; another wanted to kill all the rare animals in the museum of Natu∣ral History; a third said he did not like learned men, and that the term was synonymous with aristocrat; a fourth proposed, that soldiers might be promoted to generals, without being able to write; to con∣clude, one of these monsters said, that <HI>all men of genius should be guillotined.</HI></P>
<P>These are lovers of the arts and sciences! These are the representatives of that <HI>great</HI> republic to whose <HI>generous</HI> forbearance <HI>Spillard</HI> is to owe the recovery of his papers. Amazing change! These people, who burnt <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> because they had been encouraged by kings, and who destroyed the <HI>royal</HI> library, merely because it was royal, are now using their utmost endeavours to preserve the papers of <HI>Spillard</HI> for the use of a <HI>king,</HI> and, oh, ye gods! for a king of England too! A "despot" with whom they were <Q>never to make peace, 'till he begged it on his knees, with a halter about his neck!</Q></P>
<P>Kind, forgiving, <HI>generous</HI> fellows! how are they reformed! they who, in the beginning of the war, seized on the property, even to the very cloths, of all the British subjects who happened to be in France, and threw their persons into loathsome prisons, where hundreds of them perished; they who, <HI>in the days of their success,</HI> issued a decree for murdering every Briton taken in the field of action; they, whose cannibal agents dug the half rotten body of the brave <HI>General Dundas</HI> from the grave and hung it on a gibbet. Yes, these very people are now uncommonly solicious to save, for an En∣glish
<PB N="212" REF="030223_0043_0FE52B73E7BAE600"/>
gentleman, the little memorandums he may have made in his travels!</P>
<P>How shall we possibly account for all this? let us see if the closing sentence of the extract I have given from their order, will not throw some light on the matter. "This will," say they, <Q>give a <HI>great lesson to our enemies;</HI> for a <HI>good action</HI> de∣serves as much as a <HI>great victory.</HI></Q> So, so! dad∣dy <HI>Merlin</HI> is coming round, is he? a great lesson of <HI>generosity</HI> is to be given to their enemies, and this good action is to yield them as much as a great victory? this is what you may call coaxing. No, no; none of your good actions; keep them for your friends, and your great victories for your enemies.</P>
<P>And do I live to see the <HI>Grande Convention Fran∣coise</HI> wheedling "the <HI>nation of shop-keepers?</HI>" The people of that devoted Carthage, which they pro∣mised us they would destroy? they may wheedle long enough: Billy Pitt has not forgotten that his head was to be brought before them, as a preli∣minary to any peace they might <HI>grant</HI> to the "shop-keeping nation:" he has not forgotten that they guillotined him in effigy along with his royal Master. Billy's turn is come: he may now say to them, in one of Shakespeare's characters: <Q>And thus, my lads, the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.</Q></P>
<P>When the reader compares their <HI>patronage</HI> of the arts and sciences, in their own country, and their <HI>generosity</HI> shown towards the English, in their prosperous days, with their <HI>pretended</HI> motives set forth in this generous order, I am persuaded he
<PB N="213" REF="030223_0044_0FE52B564A382A48"/>
will attribute their change of conduct to the pro∣per cause.</P>
<P>Pray then, Mr. Brown the gazette man, let us hear no more of your French generosity. For shame, Sir! how can you suffer your fine large gazette to talk about French virtue? tell your cor∣respondent, if he should pester you with such ano∣ther paragraph, that the bore is discovered. Tell him that the "friends of France" are very much reduced in numbers, and are daily and hourly de∣creasing. Tell him, above all, that nothing can keep the sans-culotte cause alive but an immediate supply of the ready; that the "friends of France" are not to be satisfied with mere sounds of <HI>genero∣sity;</HI> that fraternity and flattery go but little way at the shambles or the grog-shop, and that, in short, flour merchants or not flour merchants, they all prefer "solid pudding to empty praise."</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS. On the poetical Works of <HI>John Swanwick</HI> af Phila∣delphia.</HEAD>
<P><HI>In</HI> the last Censor I made my readers a sort of half promise to give them some account of the poe∣tical works of Mr. Swanwick, and I am now pre∣paring to fulfil it.</P>
<P>These works are, as yet, confined to a poem, which is to be found in the Gentleman's Magazine for June, 1795, published by <HI>Sylvanus Urban</HI> of the city of London. The reader will be surprised that a poem, written in Philadelphia, should be export∣ed
<PB N="214" REF="030223_0045_0FE52BBFCDA74128"/>
to England for publication: I was and am yet surprised at this; and still more, that <HI>Citizen</HI> Swanwick should send his works to the editor of a <HI>Gentlemen's</HI> Magazine. He had heard, I presume, that this is the repository of most of the little fugi∣tive pieces written by men of learning and genius, and so he condescended to enrich it with a piece of his own. This was certainly generous in him, if we recollect what a hatred he has for all that is <HI>gentleman-like.</HI></P>
<P>The poem is entitled: <Q>The prospect of seeing the Fine Arts flourish in America.</Q>—After hav∣ing spoken of the epoch, when the artists of Ame∣rica shall stay at home <Q>to finish the glories of the risen day of Columbia,</Q> our author, by a hap∣py transition, turns our eyes to what we already possess:
<Q><L>"But see what <HI>flow'rets</HI> we already claim,</L>
<L>"What lovely <HI>harbingers</HI> of future fame!</L>
<L>"Behold <HI>philosophy's</HI> bright temple rise,</L>
<L>"And fanes to learning every where surprise;</L>
<L>"What <HI>schemes of charity</HI> the soul excite</L>
<L>"To acts of bounty, and unmix'd delight;</L>
<L>"Some <HI>to the jail with pitying steps repair,</HI></L>
<L>"To minister to <HI>woes</HI> that <HI>languish</HI> there:</L>
<L>"Others <HI>the bed of raging illness smooth,</HI></L>
<L>"And the worst pangs of human <HI>sorrow sooth.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus, then, <HI>Schemes of charity, Visiting the Jail,</HI> and <HI>Ministering to the Sick</HI> are, by Mr. Swanwick called "<HI>flow'rets,</HI> the lovely <HI>harbingers</HI> of fame;" and hence are to spring the <HI>fine arts.</HI> Never did I before hear that <HI>poor-houses, jails</HI> and <HI>sick beds</HI> were places for cultivating or encouraging the <HI>fine arts.</HI> Mr. Swanwick may there practise fine arts, per∣haps,
<PB N="215" REF="030223_0046_0FE52BC45C37F408"/>
such as are necessary to gain him votes at an election; these are very fine arts indeed.—But stop, there are more of these arts to come yet.</P>
<Q><L>"Some to fair freedom <HI>living altars raise,</HI></L>
<L>"And bid <HI>the negro</HI> celebrate her praise:</L>
<L>"Others the <HI>farmer</HI> with their cares embrace,</L>
<L>"And pay due homage to his useful race;</L>
<L>"Some <HI>manufacturers and their arts</HI> protect,</L>
<L>"Others <HI>humane</HI> establishments erect.</L>
<L>"But cease <HI>the Muse!</HI>—"</L></Q>
<P>Our poet alludes to the <HI>negro society,</HI> or abolition society, as it is called; and, I am ready to allow it a place among the harbingers of the fine arts. This society is, indeed, a nursery for some of the finest arts ever practised either in Europe or Ame∣rica. But, how comes our author to number <HI>farm∣ing</HI> and <HI>manufacturing</HI> among his fine arts? Plough∣ing and grubbing and making anchors and cables, or grinding snuff or boiling up sugar; these do not seem to me to be <HI>fine</HI> arts. After these come <HI>"humane establishments;"</HI> and, though these had been before enumerated, Mr. Swanwick must thus sum them up together and express them over again, for fear we should imagine that he did not look on them as mere tricks of art. Mercy on us! who ever heard before, that <HI>humane</HI> establishments were among the hot-beds of the fine arts!</P>
<P>So much for the vein of absurdity running through this metre: now to the Nonsense.</P>
<P><HI>Ministering</HI> to <HI>woes</HI> may be a fine art, but, when we are told that these woes <HI>languish,</HI> what are we to think of the fine artist? to <HI>languish</HI> is to <HI>pine away,</HI> to <HI>droop,</HI> to <HI>sink under affliction.</HI> Now, can it be said that a woe <HI>pines</HI> and <HI>droops?</HI> let us change
<PB N="216" REF="030223_0047_0FE52B57CDD65008"/>
the principle words in this line for such as are sy∣nonymous with them, but rather more familiar, and we shall be struck, nay, knocked down with the nonsense.</P>
<Q>"To <HI>succour pains</HI> that <HI>pine</HI> in the jail."</Q>
<P>I could say something about the <HI>raging</HI> illness of <HI>sorrow,</HI> and sorrow <HI>stretched upon a bed</HI> too, but I hasten on to the <HI>living altars</HI> of freedom. The poet tells us, that the slave society raise living altars to freedom, and then bid <HI>the negroes</HI> celebrate her praise. Now, what are these <HI>living altars?</HI> why, the persons freed, <HI>the negroes themselves;</HI> and so, these kind gentlemen bid <HI>the altars praise the god∣dess!</HI>—They will stand in no need of priests at any rate.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>farmer,</HI> I will leave it to the experience and good sense of the reader to deter∣mine, whether it be either usual or fitting to <HI>pay homage</HI> to the race of him <HI>whom we have taken un∣der our care and patronage.</HI>—Our poet often makes use of figures of rhetoric, but that of the <HI>galimati∣as</HI> is the only one he has perfectly at command. It requires neither learning nor taste to discover that he has a plentiful lack of both.</P>
<P><HI>Butler,</HI> in remarking on the verses of the would-be poets of his time, says they made one line for <HI>sense</HI> and one for <HI>rhyme.</HI> It is certain that this is a most sure mark of sterility; but our little man goes a step further, or rather falls a step short, of this: he has one line for <HI>rhyme</HI> and the other for nonsense.</P>
<P>This piece of rhyming prose I do not scruple to pronounce the most miserable attempt at versifica∣tion,
<PB N="217" REF="030223_0048_0FE52BC2AF047020"/>
that ever appeared in the Gentleman's Ma∣gazine: nor can I persuade myself that the Editor would ever have admitted it without a <HI>douceur.</HI> It appeared, indeed, to have experienced some consi∣derable delay; for, it is dated in 1788. Certain I am that if old Sylvanus Urban had been acquaint∣ed with our little author's principles in politics, he never would have suffered his chiming to enter his repository.</P>
<P>Had this been a piece scratched out in a hurry and sent away to the news-paper, one might have winked at its faults, one might have yawned over its insipidity and thrown it aside; but here is a stu∣died trap for fame; this poor dull morsel had been copied over a hundred times, perhaps, before it was sent all the way to Old England. I think I see the little poet now, scratching his head and gnawing his pen, telling his fingers and searching his rhyme book. Alas! Mr. Swanwick, people do not make poetry this way. They may hammer out lines 'till they clink, but as to poetry it never was hammered out of a dull brain.</P>
<P>What is most laughable, is, to hear the little man calling out upon the <HI>Muse.</HI>—"But <HI>cease</HI> the <HI>Muse!</HI>" as much as to say that the <HI>Muse</HI> had inspired the small-beer verses we have above extracted! It is with rapture I hear Milton invoke the heavenly Muse, or Shakespear wishing for a Muse of fire; but when, at the end of fifty lines of vapid metre, I hear the little whiffling poetastor calling on his Muse to cease her course, a sneer contracts the muscles of my nose, in spite of all my complaisance and compassion.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="030223_0049_0FE52B79AD23E0B0"/>If Mr. Swanwick reckons the noble art, taught by the famous <HI>Martinus Scriblerius,</HI> I mean the <HI>art of sinking in poetry;</HI> if he reckons this among the fine arts, I congratulate him on having brought it to perfection, for he has certainly rolled from the very bottommost step of the <HI>Bathos.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is to be a pretender to universal genius without having any genius at all. Instead of get∣ting renown a man gets himself laughed at. It is a real misfortune: Mr. Swanwick might have been happy all his days as a <HI>Tide Waiter;</HI> but, from his dabbling in a variety of <HI>arts</HI> for which he is not calculated, he will most probably preserve through life that character so despicable among partizans; <Q>a <HI>Jack</HI> of all trades and <HI>master</HI> of none.</Q></P>

<HEAD>FRENCH FRATERNITY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Since</HI> the autumn of 1793, we have heard talk about little else than British depredations on the American commerce. Most of the news-papers have been crammed with phillipics against the Bri∣tish government on this account; the nation have been called thieves and their king the great sea-robber. This was not very decent language, but even this was surpassed by certain members of Con∣gress, who seemed to vie with each other in the use of that sort of rhetoric usually called <HI>Billings∣gate.</HI> I have their speeches now before me, but the extracts I would wish to give from them are too lengthy, and I should be sorry to mutilate such elegant compositions.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="030223_0050_0FE52B281D437C50"/>I am the last on earth that would attempt to ju∣stify injustice, I cannot therefore be thought to ap∣prove of the depredations of the British: but, at the same time I know they have been a thousand times falsly accused, that every art has been made use of to exaggerate their violences, that the num∣ber of vessels taken by them has been counted fifty times over, and that language has been imput∣ed to them which they never held.</P>
<P>Nor can the British be justified by saying that they have done no more than imitate the French; but, we must be permitted to wonder that the de∣predations of one nation should excite such a live∣ly resentment as to push the country within a hair's breadth of a war, while equal depredations on the part of France should excite not the least discon∣tent, except among the merchants immediately feeling the loss. At the very moment that the members of Congress were execrating the sea-rob∣bers of Britain, and ordering General Confiscation and Admiral Embargo to take up arms against them; at this very moment the depredations of our dear, generous, <HI>humane</HI> and <HI>pure fingered</HI> allies had committed greater havock and acts of dishonesty than "the king of pirates" (to use a legislative ex∣pression) or his subjects, had ever done. I have in another work quoted the report delivered to the House of Representatives on this subject, stating <Q>that the French had not only been guilty of <HI>de∣predations equal to those of</HI> the British, but that they had, besides, violated the treaty between the two countries, and had, moreover, cheated the American merchants by discharging in de∣preciated assignats a contract which should have been discharged in coin.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="030223_0051_0FE52B99AA8EFD30"/>When this report came to be examined, every <HI>uncorrupted</HI> man was astonished to hear members fall upon the British tooth and nail, while they were ready to give the <HI>baises fraternel</HI> to the robb∣ing Garmagnoles. One said that, as to the depre∣dations of France, <Q><HI>some allowance</HI> must be made for a <HI>great</HI> nation combatting in the <HI>cause of li∣berty,</HI> and that <HI>he made no doubt</HI> that magnani∣mous people would be ready to make every just compensation.</Q> This was the reasoning of those times, and so an Envoy was sent to obtain redress from Britain and which by the treaty is obtain∣ed; but some allowance was made for the <HI>great</HI> nation who was fighting in the cause of liberty, and therefore all account against her died away.</P>
<P>The merchants, however, though generally par∣tial enough towards the <HI>grande republique,</HI> still re∣collected the loss, which has been ever since in∣creasing. These men are too well acquainted with book-keeping to be real good republicans <HI>à la fran∣çoise.</HI> They were as ready as any body <Q>to make some allowances</Q> of the excesses of the French, pro∣vided always that those allowances did not come out of their pockets. Their excesses in the low countries, their robbing of the merchants at Am∣sterdam, set the bells to ringing at Philadelphia; but when they came to lay their fraternal fingers on the Philadelphians themselves, oh! then they were sad rogues, and so the merchants send a me∣morial to Congress.—Now we shall hear their own history of the affair.</P>

<OPENER>The Memorial, &amp;c. Respectfully Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT the memorialists and divers others in the re∣gular course of their trade in the year 1793, 1794

and 1795, inverted large sums of money in provisions and other merchandises suited to the West Indian mar∣ket and sent them thither, where many cargoes were sold to the officers of Colonial Administration of the Republic of France to be paid for in Cash or Colonial produce, many others were taken by force by the said officers, from the supercargoes and consignees at <HI>prices arbitrarily fixed by themselves</HI> to be paid for in produce at rates and terms of credit fixed at their pleasure, and that <HI>others have been arrested on the high seas,</HI> carried into their ports and taken for the use of the Republic with∣out any stipulated price or contract; that your memori∣alists confidently believe that the amount of property, belonging to the citizens of the United States, thus deli∣vered to and taken by the administrative bodies of the French Republic in the West Indies, <HI>exceeds two millions of dollars now in arrear,</HI> for which your memorialists and others concerned have no mode of obtaining pay∣ment, satisfaction or redress. That the usual course is after taking the cargo by force and duress to detain the vessels under pretence of paying in produce, until the masters and crews are wearied with idleness, sickness, delay, <HI>and insult,</HI> so as to be willing to return either altogether without pay, or with such small portions thereof, as scarcely to pay the freight and charges oc∣casioned by these long delays; whereby in most in∣stances the whole capital has been left behind, and in those instances where a considerable part of the cargo has been paid for in Colonial produce, the expences of demurrage have consumed almost the whole, as by vouchers ready to be laid before the House or a com∣mittee thereof will abundantly appear.</P>
<P>Your memorialists further shew that some of the earliest sufferers among them applied personally and by memorials to <HI>citizens Genet, Fauchet,</HI> and <HI>Adet, the first and suceeding ministers of the French Republic for redress without obtaining it.</HI> They also applied by memorial to the President of the United States, who referred them to the Secretary for the department of State, whose advice they pursued in committing their claims to James Monroe, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> minister plenipotentiary of the United
<PB N="222" REF="030223_0053_0FE52B87766A7738"/>
States to the Republic of France—at the time of his embarkation. That although your memorialists are perfectly satisfied that the Executive authority of the Union hath done all within its power to procure re∣dress to your memorialists, yet it has not had the de∣sired effect.</P>
<P>Your memorialists further represent that they had hoped that some arrangement would have been assent∣ed to, whereby the debt due from the Republic of France to the citizens of America might have been discharged out of the debt due to her from the Unit∣ed States, and under this expectation they <HI>exercised patience,</HI> but finding that money funded and <HI>transferr∣ed to an agent of the republic,</HI> all hope from that resource is vanished.</P>
<P>Your memorialists feel the more concern that while <HI>provision has been made by the Executive of the Union for obtaining from other nations</HI> a <HI>redress for spoliations</HI> committed on their commerce, no measures adopted have been successful for procuring similar satisfaction from that nation which the merchants of this have shewn <HI>so decided an affection to,</HI> by supplying their is∣lands with provisions and necessaries at a <HI>greater risk than attended any other branch of their trade,</HI> supplies that were absolutely necessary to their Colonies and which they could from no other place nor in any other manner be furnished with.</P>
<P>Your memorialists therefore pray that the legisla∣ture will take their suffering case into consideration and afford them such relief and protection as to their wisdom shall seem consistent with right and justice.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Some people will pity and others will laugh at these memorialists; the French republicans will be among the latter. Upon my word, it was very cruel of our dear allies, after having received such proofs of our "so <HI>decided affection,</HI>" to cheat and insult us even more than the "great sea-robber"
<PB N="223" REF="030223_0054_0FE52B8A27D328F0"/>
did I after the patriotic and affectionate captains had run the gauntlet, as it were, to get in to the ports of their dear friends and allies to save them from starv∣ing, how silly they must look to have their cargoes seized, and be themselves thrown into a dungeon! this was often the case. I have once before said, that the Carmagnoles called them, <HI>les capitaines à coup de bâton,</HI> or <HI>caned captains;</HI> just as their Con∣vention called the Prussians, <HI>les soldats à coup de bâ∣ton,</HI> or <HI>caned soldiers.</HI> Indeed, they did often kick and beat these captains, and, though the poet tells us that such kind of blows wound honour more than any other, yet we have never heard this called a na∣tional disgrace: on the contrary, the more these fellows were kicked, the louder did they cry <HI>long live the Republic,</HI> and the more lies did they bring us in her favour.</P>
<P>The hearts of the patriots at home partook of the insensibility of the backs and posteriors of the gal∣lant mariners, and, had it not been for this after-clap memorial of the merchants, the whole would have sunk into oblivion.</P>
<P>Some persons of extraordinary patriotism went so far as to apologize for the conduct of the French; as thus: <Q>The mother country engaged in com∣bating despotism at home, and endeavouring to calm those troubles which exist in her bosom, cannot pay sufficient attention to the filling the offices in the island with honest and upright cha∣racters, otherwise they certainly would not suf∣fer the conduct pursued. This is proved by the <HI>honourable and very ample payment for damages and demurage made to Americans detained in their ports.</HI> They are therefore not implicated in the
<PB N="224" REF="030223_0055_0FE52AF7A3A3C398"/>
charge of depredation.</Q> (See the <HI>Aurora</HI> of 28th. May 1795.)</P>
<P>Now, Great Britain was at war in Europe as well as France was, why then was not the same apology applicable to her? but, this apologist says, that <HI>ample payment was made for damages,</HI> &amp;c. If this be true the memorialists are mistaken, for they say there are <HI>two millions</HI> of dollars yet unpaid in May 1796. I know very well that the French promised to pay amply: I recollect that, when Mr. Randolph's report (the substance of which I have above noticed) was published, it was accom∣panied with a note from his <HI>intimate friend</HI> Fauchet, declaring the readiness of the French Republic to make immediate compensation. This had the de∣sired effect, for, though a single farthing will ne∣ver be paid, the declaration was looked upon as an acknowledgement of the debt and as a security for the future; while the English minister, not dar∣ing to make a promise which he was not sure would be fulfilled, was obliged to remain silent, and his silence was considered as a proof that his court not only authorized, but was resolved to continue its depredations. But, how deceitful are appearances! he that promises every thing pays nothing, and he that promises nothing pays every thing.</P>
<P>Either the apologist tells us a falsehood or the merchants tell us one. I have no great inclination to interfere with the matter: I leave them to settle it between themselves; or if they should be obliged to call in an umpire, none is so proper as the dear nation for whom they both have <Q>shown so de∣cided an affection.</Q></P>

<HEAD>NEW DISCOVERIES <HI>IN</HI> The Regions of Corruption.</HEAD>
<P><HI>In</HI> the introduction to this work, I promised the public <Q>to give an account of every democratic trick, whether of native growth or imported from abroad; to unravel all the windings of the pre∣tended patriots, and more particularly those of the <HI>flour-merchants.</HI></Q> Under this engagement, I should think myself inexcusable, were I to remain silent at a time, when, if new plots are not absolute∣ly discovered, such are talked of in a manner cal∣culated to excite general curiosity.</P>
<P>Satisfied in my own mind, as I have long been in the habit of declaring, that there is a numerous faction in this country acting under French influ∣ence, and even in French pay, I must naturally re∣joice at the discovery of whatever promises to be more successful, than any thing I have hitherto been able to say, in convincing the people of the existence of this faction. Under this impression it is, that I publish the following article from the <HI>Minerva</HI> of New York, and that I add such obser∣vations as appear to me pertinent.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from an American dated Paris, Feb. 14th, <HI>1796.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Could you imagine, my dear Sir, that any American citizens could be so abandoned as to invite France to
<PB N="226" REF="030223_0057_0FE52AF92672A6C0"/>
attempt, by coercion, to prevent the free exercise of the judgment of our country concerning its own interests, and to awe it into a surrender of its own opinion to the mandate of a foreign country? yet so the fact un∣doubtedly is. <HI>Influential men on your side of the water, have invited the French government to speak to ours a decided language against the execution of the treaty with Great Britain, and even to go so far, as to claim our guarantee of the French West-Indies; placing before us the alternative of war with France or Great Britain.</HI> The idea has been listened to by the government, and it has been in contemplation to send a new Minister with a fleet to carry the plan into effect: tho' I am in∣clined to hope that it has been recently laid aside. The extreme embarrassments of the affairs of their country, especially with regard to its finances, and more serious reflections on the hazard of driving us into an election to take side with Great Britain, as well from the ex∣posed state of our commerce, as from the resentment which so dictatorial a conduct would naturally inspire, have at last produced a halt, and, I trust, that the he∣sitation which has begun, will end in a resolution not to risk so unjust and so mad a proceeding. Would to Heaven that the war was at an end! for we shall not be safe from the machinations of this wicked portion of the globe till that event takes place—justice and morali∣ty have fled from Europe—but alas! are they flying from America also? <HI>I dare not trust to this mode of con∣veyance the persons supposed to be the authors of this ne∣farious plot.</HI> But a few months may enable me to make the disclosure with more certainty: <HI>where I can do it with perfect safety.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>This intelligence, if true, at once decides the question of French influence and corruption; it is therefore of the utmost importance to form a cor∣rect opinion concerning it. Let us first see what claims the letter itself has to authenticity, and then, whether the alarming information it contains be corroberated by facts already known.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="030223_0058_0FE52B299ECFCD58"/>The gazette in which this extract first appeared is remarkable for its impartiality. The Editor is a man of much experience in his business, and en∣joys a high reputation for candour and understand∣ing. It is not probable that such a man should be deceived with respect the authenticity of the let∣ter, and it is still less probable, that he should be prevailed on to print it, not believing it authentic. The manner, too, in which he introduces it to the public, seems to me to be a strong proof of his persuasion, that it would be soon followed up with a more explicit account. Indeed, had he not be∣lieved that the whole affair must finally come to light, it is hardly credible that he would have haz∣arded a piece of intelligence reflecting such indeli∣ble dishonour on a portion of his countrymen, and not capable of answering any good purpose what∣ever.</P>
<P>The Editor has never shown himself the enemy of France. He has not indeed, like hundreds of others, approved of the massacres in that country; but the instant those massacres ceased, he contri∣buted his dole of praise to the triumphant <HI>moderates.</HI> He was among the first to oppose the principles of the present constitution in France to those of our Ja∣cobins; and though he was mistaken here, though he was opposing mischief to mischief, the mistake proves, that the present French government had his appro∣bation, and as it still continues the same it must still have that approbation. There is then, no reason to suppose that he would lend his hand to a fabri∣cation tending to discredit the French government. In truth, he is over cautious in speaking of it: if the intelligence be true, the hardest terms he has for conduct of such an infamous and treacherous nature are, <HI>"unkindness and imprudence."</HI> A man
<PB N="228" REF="030223_0059_0FE52B2B1FC18FF8"/>
who could so far get the better of the feelings he must entertain upon the sight of this intelligence, is rather to be suspected of a partiality for, than against the French government.</P>
<P>The Editor of the <HI>Minerva</HI> has, 'tis true, been a bold and able defender of the British treaty; he might therefore be supposed to be anxious for its success, as all men are zealous in a cause they have decidedly espoused; but, this cause stood no long∣er in need of support when the extract appeared, the treaty having passed the House of Representa∣tives sixteen days before. Had this intelligence been a mere invention to stir the people up against the opposition, or rather against their destructrive projects, it should have made its appearance at the time when petitions were handing about for and against the treaty. At that time such a battery might have been opened to good purpose; but, af∣ter the treaty was sanctioned, it would have been playing it off upon the defeated and the dead.</P>
<P>In short, there is no reason whatever to suppose, that the Editor would have published the extract, believing it a fabrication; and as it is almost im∣possible he should be duped by any fabricator, we must believe it authentic, especially when we see the intelligence contained in it strongly corroborated by facts already most clearly and unequivocally ascer∣tained.</P>
<P>It is certain that every American who loves his country, and who consequently feels a deep con∣cern for its honour, must be fired with indignation upon hearing, that <Q>certain influential men on this side of the water had invited the French govern∣ment
<PB N="229" REF="030223_0060_0FE52B9B2C5E3B08"/>
to <HI>force</HI> the government of America to set aside the treaty, and that the French rulers had listened to the proposal;</Q> but the Editor of the <HI>Minerva</HI> must excuse me, if I think it rather sur∣prising, that he should imagine either one or the other "impossible." Says he, <Q>it seems impossi∣ble that any American citizens could be so lost to all sense of virtue and duty, as to endeavour to bring upon their country so great an evil, and it seems less probable, that the government of France should so far forget our rights as an in∣dependant nation, and be so unmindful of the spirit and genius of freedom as to be disposed to follow the pernicious advice.</Q> Now, the truth is, that what is here represented as next to impos∣sible is no more than a continuation of what we have been witnesses of during four successive years.</P>
<P>In order to form a correct opinion as to the pro∣bability of the truth of the intelligence from Paris, we must go back to the epoch when the ruinous and ruined French nation was first <HI>called</HI> a Repub∣lic,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say <HI>called,</HI> because France is no more a Republic in real∣lity than Turky or Morocco, or any other despotic state.</NOTE> and trace down the chain of the machinati∣ons of its tyrants to the moment, when the hostile determination, the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of impudence and of perfidy is said to have been formed.</P>
<P>When <HI>Brissot</HI> and his colleagues declared war against Great Britain, Holland and Spain they form∣ed the plan of forcing this country to make a com∣mon cause with them. For this purpose Citizen Genet was sent out to replace Mr. Ternant, bring∣ing with him the necessary instructions, and the
<PB N="230" REF="030223_0061_0FE52B8BA894CF28"/>
still more necessary <HI>rouleaux</HI> of <HI>Louis d'ors.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some time ago, I had a note sent me, giving an account of the deposit as well as the removal of certain <HI>rouleaux,</HI> ac∣companied with a poem entitled <Q>the confessions of <HI>François Louis d'or.</HI></Q> The author has my thanks for both; but want of room has delayed their publication for the present.</NOTE> As it was foreseen that the Executive of the United States would resolutely oppose the overtures for war, Ge∣net was to effect by force what could not be effect∣ed by persuasion. If the government of America was ready to aid the cause of France it was to be respected, but if not it was to be destroyed by stirr∣ing up the people to opposition.</P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of coming directly to the seat of government, the Citizen landed at one of the ports the most distant from it, and in a part of the Union the most likely to be led astray by his seductive and seditious arts. On his arrival he found a pro∣clamation of neutrality, strictly forbidding the peo∣ple of these States to do any thing contrary to their duty as a nation at peace with all the world; but, in place of acknowledging this right of a neutral nation, what did he do? He issued Letters of Mar∣que and military Commissions: by sea he sent Ame∣ricans to cruise on the British, and by land to in∣vade the Spanish dominions. His journey through the Southern States was a kind of triumphal pro∣cession, and he at last made his public entry at Phi∣ladelphia more like a viceroy or a conqueror than a foreign minister.</P>
<P>His introductory letter to the Secretary of State was a clear declaration of his intensions. "When," say he, <Q>the emissaries of our <HI>common enemies</HI> are making <HI>useless efforts</HI> to <HI>neutralise</HI> the gratitude of your fellow citizens, &amp;c.</Q> This language was
<PB N="231" REF="030223_0062_0FE52BC739460490"/>
an unequivocal proof that he despised the President and his proclamation of neutrality, and that he depended on the people for support. Accordingly his endeavours were all directed towards this one object, exciting discontent and disobedience.</P>
<P>Those who had succeeded in destroying one go∣vernment by the infernal agency of Jacobin clubs, knew their utility, too well to neglect employing them against another. The Jacobins had hurled the king of France from his throne, and the De∣mocrats might hurl General Washington from his chair. It is something truely singular, that a cele∣brated <HI>atronomer</HI> and a <HI>secretary of state</HI> should be the <HI>president</HI> and <HI>secretary</HI> of the mother-club in each country; it is, however, a fact: <HI>Bailly</HI> and <HI>Dumouriez</HI> once filled those honourable posts in France, as <HI>David Rittenhouse</HI> and <HI>A. J. Dallas</HI> did in the first club that was formed in America.</P>
<P>On the plan, and at the recommendation, of the mother-club at Philadelphia, others were formed all over the Union. Their affiliations were as per∣fect in their nature as those of the Jacobins in France, or of the Reformers in England and Scot∣land, and the principles and object of all were the same. It would be tedious to enter into a detail of their manoeuvres, and disagreeable also, as it would not fail to bring to mind the conduct of ma∣ny persons who now wish their folly to be forgotten.</P>
<P>When the Citizen saw that the clubs were be∣come numerous, and thought that things were ripe, he made an open avowal of his intentions of <Q>ap∣pealing from the President to the people.</Q> This precipitant avowal, dictated by French vanity, hap∣pily disconcerted all his plans. The hectoring mi∣nister
<PB N="232" REF="030223_0063_0FE52B8D2AEFB300"/>
was mistaken; he thought he had the poor doltish Parisians to deal with; but he was soon con∣vinced of the contrary. The people of America, though their partiality for the French nation, and their still greater partiality for what they <HI>then</HI> ima∣gined to be the cause of freedom, had led them into innumerable fooleries, and distinctors as unwise as unjust, showed, when it came to the trial, that they had too much love for their country, and for their friend and father to espouse the cause of a man who aimed at the destruction of both.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French republicans assert, with their usual insolence, that the <HI>people</HI> of this country began to express their dislike to Genet only when they found he was recalled. This is false. The democratic societies, indeed, played him this trick; but the <HI>people</HI> expressed their detestation of his conduct, and that most unequivocally too, the instant he talked of his <HI>appeal.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>From the moment the insolent Brissotonian found himself baffled, his myrmidons began to cry havock. They attacked the citizens of Charleston at the door of their play-house, cut the traces of their coach-horses, wounded several persons, and if I am not mistaken killed one or two. The militia were call∣ed out, and the city was struck with terror. Not long after an American had his skull cleft on board of one of their vessels, for a pretended <HI>insult to their tricolored cockade.</HI> Many persons of this city of Philadelphia had the mortification to see their peace officers hacked with swords in the middle of the street.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">How all the offenders came to escape punishment is a question to be put to the governor of Pennsylvania and others, who ought to have seen the laws executed.</NOTE> And yet we are now told that <Q>it seems <HI>impossible</HI> that the government of France should attempt any thing against our neutrality.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="030223_0064_0FE4FE64D115F660"/>I know I shall be told here, to make a distinction between the rulers in France and their ministers in this country; and I would do this, if I saw the least reason for so doing; if I were not well convinced that the latter have in no case surpassed their in∣structions. The friends of the French government make this distinction, and tell us that Genet was <HI>recalled</HI> for his misconduct. The turbulent minister was, indeed, <HI>displaced;</HI> but the manner of doing this fully proves, that it was a matter of expedien∣cy and not of choice. His masters, and the mast∣ers of unhappy France, could not reject the Presi∣dents' request, without disgusting the people of this country, who must have looked on such a step as a decided mark of approbation of Genets' insolence; nor could they call home without punishing him. Therefore, at once to preserve the good will of the Americans and avoid the punishment of a man whose conduct they did in reality approve of, they dis∣missed him from his employment and left him qui∣etly amongst us, where, besides, it was possible for him still to act, though unseen, as the show-man behind the canvass gives movement and volubility to his puppets.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If some good soul would but give us a peep into the dis∣patches that now and then go over to Long-island, we should, perhaps, see some more "precious confessions."</NOTE></P>
<P>Let it be recollected, too, that Genet was dis∣placed by Robespierre and his crew, and I leave any one to determine whether the merciful Robes∣pierre, the very prince of cut-throats, could disap∣prove of the plans of our Long-islander. The gentle Robospierre did, indeed, send us word that it pained his humane and generous soul, to think that the representative of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>brave</HI> nation
<PB N="234" REF="030223_0065_0FE52B1DCFE10488"/>
should so disobey its will; but we should have ask∣ed this bloody villain, what he would have said if Genet had succeeded in his <Q>appeal from the President to the people.</Q> Genet was displaced because he had failed, and not because he had at∣tempted our destruction. Robespierre has been aptly termed the <HI>scape-goat</HI> of the Convention, in France, and Genet may with equal aptness be termed their scape-goat in America.</P>
<P>The insurrection in the Western Counties of Pennsylvania was undoubtedly a great evil, but much good has been derived from it. This insur∣rection was imputed to the machinations of Great Britain, and as people's ears were all open to every thing, however absurd, that was advanced against that nation, it is not wonderful that many very well meaning men marched against the insurgents with a full expectation of finding them under the com∣mand of the Governor of Upper-Canada. This was sinning against conviction certainly; but, what errors will not men plunge into, when blinded by prejudice and pricked on by revenge! most peo∣ple ware heartily ashamed of having been the dupes of this trick, long before the appearance of Citizen Fauchet's intercepted letter; but that truly inesti∣mable essay on bribery and corruption has placed the whole matter in a fair light, and, as the saying is, "clapped the saddle on the right horse."</P>
<P>Every man who seeks for truth and not for false∣hood will regret, with me, that we are not in pos∣session of the famous N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2 and N<SUP>o</SUP>. 6, mentioned in Citizen Fauchet's letter, and of the other dispatches preceding that letter. Had we the perusal of these precious pieces, we might enter into some detail not having them we must content ourselves with
<PB N="235" REF="030223_0066_0FE52B35671A6040"/>
proceeding like mathematicians, from the known to the unknown.</P>
<P>We know, that the same man, who was Secretary to the first Jacobin society in this country, and who afterwards denied his report concerning the <Q>ap∣peal from the President to the people;</Q> we know that this man is named, in the intercepted letter, amongst the three or four who were balancing to decide on their party, when the overtures for money were made to the French minister.</P>
<P>We know, that all the leaders in the insurrection, as well as their partizans here, were then and are now the decided supporters of France in opposition to Great Britain. If we look back to the meetings of the insurgent committees, we shall there find the names of two members of the present House of Representatives, and if we turn to the <HI>yeas</HI> and <HI>nays</HI> of that House, we shall find them both voting against the British treaty, and opposing every mea∣sure of the Federal government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I said, in the first part of the <HI>Bone to Gnaw,</HI> that the enemies of Great Britain were invariably the enemies of the Federal Government, the good democrats affected to laugh at me: let them deny this now, if they can. I defy even their impudence to deny the fact.</NOTE></P>
<P>We know, that poor Citizen Fauchet expressed his severe regret at the failure of the insurrection; and surely we know, that when a man expresses his regret at the failure of an enterprize, it is certain he wished it to succeed. After having justified the cause of the insurgents, and whined out their discomfit, he says: <Q>Thus will the government acquire stability, <HI>for one complete cession at least!</HI> Who knows what will be the limits <HI>of this tri∣umph!</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="030223_0067_0FE52B7E06373B78"/>
perhaps advantage will be taken of it to obtain some laws for <HI>strengthening the government!</HI></Q>— I was tempted to throw in an <HI>alas,</HI> or two here; nothing else is wanting to render the passage truly pathetic; as thus: <Q>My dear Masters, in spite of my teeth this government will <HI>last one session longer at least! Alas!</HI> who knows what may be the limits of this triumph over our brothers! Per∣haps, Oh hell! we shall never be able to knock it down.</Q></P>
<P>Let the reader well remember, that these dread∣ful forebodings of Citizen Fauchet are to be found in a confidential dispatch, intended for the perusal of the Convention only. It is from documents like this, and not from public declarations, that we are to judge of the dispositions of a foreign go∣vernment. Suppose, for instance, a letter from the British Minister had been intercepted, contain∣ing expressions of his regret at the success of the government in quelling the insurrection, and justi∣fying the conduct of the insurgents. What would then have been seen? need I ask this? Poor man! the Lord have mercy upon him, if he had re∣mained here after the discovery. Our language is copious, and particularly in terms of execration; but I am mistaken if enough would have been found. Those who talk high-dutch would have had an advantage, as it is said, a man can curse harder in that language than in any other.</P>
<P>Fauchet was recalled, and, as no misconduct was imputed to him, he went home you see. But here is one circumstance that I must beg the good reader to attend to, and that is, that Citizen Joseph was
<PB N="237" REF="030223_0068_0FE52BB29CFD95C8"/>
called away <HI>after a defeat,</HI> just as his renowned pre∣decessor was. As soon as it was known in France, that Father Joseph's fatal dispatch had fallen into the hands of the English Ministry, it was perceived that the writer would become odious here; that he would always be suspected by the government, and that his friends would be afraid to trust their <HI>pre∣cious confessions</HI> to his ear. How kind was it, then, to recall him and send another, whom no mortal man could ever think of suspecting: no, certainly not; it would be hard, indeed, to suspect a third. The most unfortunate gamblers reckon with confi∣dence upon a good throw out of three.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having stumbled upon the word <HI>Gamblers,</HI> it puts me in mind of the <HI>Farro Banks, Gaming-Tables</HI> and <HI>Gambling Lotteries,</HI> in all about two hundred now in this city. These noble institu∣tions we owe entirely to the French; and, when we add to these the paganish calendar and the Age of Reason, must we not blush to think that these generous enlightners of the world are still obliged to cry out on our <HI>ingratitude!</HI> how much better are all those pretty things than the nasty broad-cloths and linens we get from those sad dogs the British!—And yet we make a treaty with them! O, fy!</NOTE></P>
<P>The third (and I hope the last) fair trial of the strength of French influence was, the attempt to set aside the British Treaty. Here it failed also; but we are not to conclude that, because it failed, it never was made. For my part, I am confident the trial was made, and have not the least doubt that it would have succeeded, had it not been for a <HI>disappointment.</HI></P>
<P>It would be useless to repeat here what has been so often said respecting the conduct of poor Mr. Randolph, at the time of the ratification, or to go over all the manoeuvres of the partizans of France, from the moment the treaty first arrived in the country till the meeting of Congress. Still less ne∣cessary

is it to enter into a detailed account of what has passed since that time, as it is fresh in every one's memory. One fact, however, I must relate here, as it is well worthy of attention.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Censor</HI> for April, page 145, it was re∣marked, that <Q>the petition against the treaty, said to be signed by fifteen hundred citizens of Philadelphia, was carried round for signature by a <HI>Frenchman;</HI></Q> to this I have now to add, that, in the State of New Jersey, two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> went about soliciting signatures of another petition of the same import. The person, who was so obliging as to furnish this information, saw them at a pub∣lic house pressing people to sign. He was himself prevailed on to do so; but, thinking, upon recol∣lection, that he had done wrong, he returned to the house and scratched out his name. Would to God that numbers of his countrymen were as ready to correct their errors!</P>
<P>After having given this short sketch of the histo∣ry of French influence down to the time when, as our Paris intelligence states, it was to break out in∣to action, let us compare that intelligence with the situation of things on this side of the water. A few sentences will suffice.</P>
<P>The substance of the Paris intelligence is this: <Q>that certain influential men in America had enter∣ed into a negociation with the French government, the result of which was; France was to oblige the Executive of the United States to abandon the treaty with great Britain, by threatening it with a war in case of refusal; but that this pro∣ject, the writer believed to be laid aside <HI>on the</HI> 14th <HI>of February.</HI></Q> On the 24th of March, Mr.
<PB N="239" REF="030223_0070_0FE52BD444DC3F58"/>
Livingston's motion passed by a majority of <HI>twenty five.</HI> This was only 38 days after France had given up the project. On the 28th of April, 35 days la∣ter, this <HI>frightful majority</HI> changed into a <HI>minority,</HI> and the treaty passed very quietly. This was 63 days after France had given up the project. So that, it is possible that this might be known when the latter vote was taken, and not when the for∣mer one was.</P>
<P>I by no means pretend to say, that any unfavour∣able news from France had an influence on these votes; on the contrary, I am, alas! (as Citizen Fauchet says) too well convinced of the purity of the Opposition, to suppose that they, or any of them, could be the <HI>"influential men,"</HI> hinted at in the extract. No, no, God forbid I should think any such thing; mercy on us all! they, poor men, changed their votes because their constituents chang∣ed their notes. It is these constituents who are to blame then, and, of course, the <HI>"influential men"</HI> are to be found among them. Now, constituents are every body, and every body is nobody; and thus you see, reader, we all of us draw ourselves decently out of the scrape.</P>
