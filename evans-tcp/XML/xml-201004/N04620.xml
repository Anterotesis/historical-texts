</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are most wise and excellent Advice, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> should be esteemed as one of the principal Sentences rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ded in this Book. They not only enjoin Obedience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> direct to the Order of it; commanding us first to obey God, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the King, as immediately subordinate to him, constituted to see Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Laws observed, and to enforce the Observation of them by enacti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> such Laws as are not repugnant to them.</P>
<P>It is universally agreed by all Persons who have with any Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> studied the Nature of Government, that Factions and Divisions ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a natural Tendency to expose Kingdoms, or any other Form of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦vernment to Destruction; and that the Peace, Safety and Secur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of all civil Society, are best secured and established, when a rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Understanding subsists between the <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>governed;</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> both Parties are heartily united to prosecute the same End, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Execution of the same Means.— This Observation will be sufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> illustrated, by calling to Mind the History of our Mother Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Beginning of the <HI>glorious Reformation.</HI> How steadily, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> invincibly did SHE bear up against the <HI>infernal Malice</HI> and Policy <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rome,</HI> the Arms of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Abettors</HI> of a <HI>Pretender</HI> to her Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and a malignant Party within her own Bowels, to second and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦mote the Interest of the Enemy without!

This Unanimity did not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦flect Honour upon our Country, but make <HI>England</HI> the Wonder <HI>Europe,</HI> and effectually subverted and confounded the Designs of

<P>And the same Cause will for ever produce the same Effects: <HI>Bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s</HI> will again become as considerable, as much revered and envied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever, if they make the Maxim in my Text the Rule of their Ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s; <HI>to fear God and the King, and meddle not with them that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en unto change.</HI></P>
<P>We are all from our Infancy instructed in our Duty to God; we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve Pastors and Teachers set over us for this Purpose, and not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but we can see with our Eyes the Duties enjoined in the Oracles Truth: This ought to be regarded as a most invaluable Blessing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ectually sapping the Foundation of that great <HI>Diana</HI> of the Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Rome, implicit Faith.</HI> I can't indeed pretend to say so much of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws of the Land, nor is there any Occasion I should: If there be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Defect in the Promulgation of them, it is sufficiently supplied by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Knowledge that every Man may acquire from the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> which Obedience to the higher Powers is indispensibly required: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d any Person whatsoever may learn from thence, upon due Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ction and Consideration, that by fearing God and the King, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> understood an unalterable Stedfastness to the holy Religion there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ealed to us; and due Subjection to the Government we live under, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d legal Obedience to it.</P>
<P>This is a very short and summary Account of our Obedience to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and the King, and the Reason is, that I may have more Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enlarge upon the latter Part of the Text, <HI>and meddle not with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m that are given unto change.</HI></P>
<P>These Words are not only a Caution, but a Prescription, to secure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fidelity and Constancy in both the forementioned Duties, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty to God and the King. As if the wise Man had said, One of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> best Preservatives against all kind of Vices, is carefully to avoid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Company; there is, my Son, a strange Contagion in ill Exam∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecious tempting Outside in every Vice, which flatters our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ses, and is but too agreeable to one or other of our Passions: Beware <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n, have nothing to do with those whom Discontent with the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> State of Affairs, fondness of Novelty, Avarice, Ambition, Va∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> or Self-conceit, put upon innovating in Religion and Govern∣ment, but preserve yourself by a stedfast regard to Duty in both these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ects: Avoid, fly from such Innovations; into their Secret be not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>itted. <HI>And meddle not with them that are given unto change.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="005749_0005_1026F4D1942B6038"/>
It may not be improper in discoursing from these Words, to assign some Causes of Men's being given unto change.</P>
<P>In the second Place, I shall represent the Danger of engaging with Men that are addicted to change.</P>
<P>And shall in the last Place, make such Improvements as Time and the Design I have in View will admit of.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I am to assign some Causes why Men are given to change. And the first and principal Cause may be, an unbounded aspirin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ambition. Men measuring themselves by their own fond Conceit and fantastical Imaginations, are led on to think that the World should pay them the same Respect and Adoration that they vainl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imagine is due to them, and conclude themselves neglected, overlook∣ed, nay, affronted, if their Expectations are baulk'd, and they hap∣pen to be consider'd as second to any. Now, when this is the Case it is impossible for any Government upon Earth to gratify such Pre∣tenders: For as there may be many Competitors, and only one Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be disposed of, upon being disappointed, <HI>such uneasy Spirits w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> naturally form Parties, and fall into Faction. We are they that oug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to speak, who is Lord over us?</HI> Psal. the 12.4. v.—</P>
<P>Another Cause which contributes greatly to Factions and Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣orders in Civil Societies, is the Fury, the Violence of Men's Passion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. These breaking thro' the Bounds of Reason and Religion, like an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣petuous Torrent, sweep all before them. Private Animosities a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> well known to have had a larger Share in publick Distempers, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Men are willing to own; and indeed it is impossible it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> otherwise, if Men are not disposed to use the proper Means for qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣fying and tempering their Passions.</P>
<P>The narrow contracted Provision Providence has been pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make for many in the World, may be another Cause of Men's <HI>be give to change.</HI> And a graceless Cause it is: The Men are strang to Contentment, and to the Law that enjoins it: No wonder th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that their pitiful Fortunes, and gaping Desires, give their ulcer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Spirits a new Edge: No wonder (that being deprived of the Com∣forts of Religion, having no Prospect of approaching Glory and Ha∣piness in another State, to qualify and allay the Afflictions and Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣bles of this Life) the Men are led on and seduced into a thous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Errors and Follies, and to satisfy their Vanity, Ambition and Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣gality,
<PB REF="005749_0006_1026F4D436F2D178"/>don't scruple to sacrifice the Peace of Society, and overthrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best ordered and most excellent Constitution.</P>
<P>Another Cause I shall just mention, which may contribute to pro∣mote Factions and Disorders in regular, well constituted Bodies, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragmatical, busy, intermedling Temper. Men can't confine them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves within their proper Limits and Sphere; they are for grasping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Things above their Fortunes, and beyond their Capacities; and because they can't be gratified, as Matters are circumstanced at pre∣sent, and no Way so probable of bringing them into Play, as an Alteration, a new State of Affairs, they will leave no Stone unturn∣ed, but engage in Courses most destructive to promote their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsanctified Ends.</P>
<P>I might assign many more Causes for Men's being addicted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hange; but as these seem to be the principal, on which all others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave a natural Dependance, I shall prosecute this Point no fur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her; but,</P>
<P>Proceed to my second Head, to lay before you the great Danger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Folly of engaging with those who are given to change.</P>
<P>I need not make use of Arguments, I believe, to convince you, that Men upon their enlisting into Parties and Factions, may design <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onestly and innocently; they may be told, their Religion, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberties, their Properties are in Danger; and these we are all satis∣fied may prove very engaging Motives to honest well designing Men, to join with such Persons as they esteem zealous Asserters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Defenders of such invaluable Blessings and Privileges. Their present Designs may not have the least Tendency to overset the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>titution; but then they may be insensibly led on by the Heads of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Faction to make one false Step, and so from one Evil to proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o another, until they are finally involved in the most indirect Courses, inextricable Mazes of Error and Sin; and not being able to make a safe Retreat, may become so intemperate, as to bear down all Considerations of Reason and Religion; and to avoid the Punishment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f one Crime, run headlong into the commission of another. Com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any causes Confidence, and Numbers give Credit and Defence; Credit to the Crime, and Defence to the Criminal.—Thus the modes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st Natures, hardned by the Fellowship and Concurrence of others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same vicious Courses, may dwindle into quite another Dis∣position and Frame of Spirit, and in a short Time lose all appre∣hension of the Indecency, the Wickedness of those Actions which they have so familiarly and so long conversed with.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005749_0007_1026F4D6ED9E6BC8"/>
An undoubted Instance of this first we have in the Case of the Royal Martyr. I charitably presume, nay, I firmly believe, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many of those miserable Men that were concerned in that <HI>Rebellion</HI> and finally in the King's <HI>Murder,</HI> would have startled and trembled at the bare mentioning so horrible a Fact, when they first engaged in the <HI>Republican Faction.</HI> But having once prostituted their Under¦standings to the Cheats and Delusions of their <HI>Ringleaders,</HI> they were naturally led to assent to any Principles, any Method that might support the Cause they had embarked in: And thus their Zeal be¦coming outrageous, transported them into Sedition, and then having no other Way to escape the Danger they perceived hanging over their Heads, they fell into the most unnatural Rebellion; and being engaged in Rebellion, what other Sanctuary, what other Security could they have recourse to, but <HI>Regicide? (i. e)</HI> cutting off the King. People little know what they are made of, and can have no Security against falling into the very Depths of Hell, but Circumspection, Care and Watchfulness, (under the Influence and Direction of Grace) in the Preservation of their Innocence, and a due Consideration of the Consequence and Tendency of every Action and Undertaking.</P>
<P>The Case of <HI>Hazael</HI> seems very a propos to the Subject I am no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon. When <HI>Elisha</HI> foretold him what mighty Mischiefs he should be Instrumental of bringing upon <HI>Israel,</HI> that he should fire their strong Holds, slay their young Men with the Sword, dash in Piece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their poor Infants, and rip up their Women with Child; Outrages <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> barbarous and bruitish, that he could not think human Nature capable of perpetrating them, as appears by his Answer: <HI>What, is thy Ser∣vant a Dog, that he should do this great Thing?</HI> It could not enter into his Heart, that he should ever be inclin'd to commit such Cru∣elties and Barbarities. But no sooner did his Ambition tempt him to stain his Hands in his Royal Master's Blood, but to attone for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> villanous Treachery, he fulfilled all that the Prophet foretold.</P>
<P>This Example should be a Warning, should teach Men to look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves, and preserve their Innocence, never to flatter themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that their Opinions will not alter with their Circumstances, or be∣lieve themselves Temptation-Proof, because their Resolutions a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> good for the present, and they design not to depart from that Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but carefully to avoid all Opportunities that may betray them in such Crimes as they seem now to abhor, and never perswade them∣selves that it is in their Power to stop at this or to'ther Offence
<PB N="8" REF="005749_0008_1026F4D9D38F7A10"/>Degree in Sin, and proceed no further. There is no Instance of any Man's arriving at a desperate Pitch in Wickedness suddenly; this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought about gradually and by Progression; one Sin drew on another, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Purposes of his Heart were changed by new and fatal Opportu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities; he yielded by little and little to Custom and Example, im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibed the Manners of his Companions, until at length he became the Man himself whose Image sometime before would have scared and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errified him. <HI>Meddle not with them</HI> then, my Brethren, <HI>that are given unto change,</HI> if you would preserve your Innocence and Virtue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree from the most dangerous Temptations.</P>
<P>But, Secondly, <HI>Meddle not with them that are given unto change,</HI> be∣cause thereby you may involve yourselves in the greatest temporal Mischiefs and Calamities.</P>
<P>We need not spend much Time to shew, that the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty God of War, is concern'd to defend the righteous Cause, and to arm his Power against the rebellious. All sovereign Power, we know, is immediately derived from him; by Commission from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im Kings act; every lawful Ruler holds his Government by a cer∣tain Deputation from the King of Kings; and the Commission by which he holds it is God's Word: This is the Voice of Scripture, this is the Voice of Reason. To fly then in the Face of such Powers, regularly constituted and set over us, to take up Arms in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebellious Manner, in order to dethrone our Prince, and overset the Government established among us, discovers not only a peremptory Disobedience to those Laws of God, which require our dutiful Sub∣mission to our lawful Superiours, but a direct Renunciation also of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he divine Authority it self; and consequently is such a Crime as the Almighty is more immediately concerned to punish. Wherefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Men would not make themselves the Marks of divine Vengeance, and expose their guilty Heads to its Almighty Thunderbolts, it con∣cerns them to be very careful not to swerve from their due Allegiance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o their Prince; it concerns them not to suffer their Pride or Discon∣tent to prey upon their Loyalty; it concerns them not to imbibe sedi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Principles, nor intrigue with factious Combinations, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he very Seminaries of Rebellion; but out of an awful Fear and Dread of the Divine Majesty, they should honour and obey the King, and avoid as they would Plague or Pestilence, meddling with those that are given to change.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005749_0009_1026F4DEE2E9DDC0"/>
Many of the <HI>Scottish Rebels,</HI> we humbly hope (without any Breach of Christian Charity) are convinced before this Time, of the pernicious Consequences of unstable Principles: They have been taken in the Devices they imagined, and have had the Reward of their Deserts. Surely such Wretches must have been addicted to change with a Vengeance, who could prevail upon themselves to join the Inhabitants of <HI>Babylon,</HI> to rase the Walls of their own <HI>Sion,</HI> to conspire and rebel against a Prince, who is a Defender of the Faith they profess, and to join with one who by the Principles of his Re∣ligion, is under the most solemn Obligations to destroy it. But this requires a more particular Consideration.</P>
<P>Now, what can be more astonishing? How could such a Relation ever obtain Credit, were it not verified in Fact, that any of our Fellow Subjects should be given over to such Infatuation; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any <HI>Protestant</HI> should have so little Regard either to his Religion or the Welfare of his native Country, as upon any Account whatsoever, to favour and encourage the Introduction of <HI>Popery,</HI> and the bringing over a <HI>French Army</HI> to subdue and enslave it? Oh! <HI>tell it not in Goth, publish it not in the Streets of Askalon!</HI></P>
<P>But however, such it seems there are Many; Many who have dared to lift up their treacherous Hands against that very <HI>Crown</HI> they had sworn to support upon his Majesty's Head, and to set up the <HI>Standard</HI> of that <HI>Pretender</HI> whom they had frequently and solemnly abjured: Many who have been audacious enough to proclaim the Title of their <HI>sham Prince,</HI> with those very Tongues with which they had often sworn, that he had no Right or Title whatsoever to the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and with which they had imprecated the Divine Vengeance upon their own Heads, if they did not act sincerely. Can such Monsters as these hope for Success? What do they take the Almighty to be? Think they that he can be imposed upon with broken Vows and Perjury? Can such be delivered? Oh, no! God has declared himself a jealous God, a God that will not hold them Guiltless that take his Name in vain.—But let us pause and consider, what Arguments can be framed, what Excuses or Pretences made for this unnatural Rebellion, this turning our Mother Country into a Scene of Confusion and Blood. Can his Majesty's Right and Title be disputed? Is not his Claim as good a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Prince's in Europe? Has not the Crown been settled on him by the concurring Votes of Lords and Common, under the auspiciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="10" REF="005749_0010_1026F4E14D9328A0"/>Influences of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne?</HI> Is not the Protestant Succession in the illustrious House of <HI>Hanover</HI> a Point in which all Parties, all Factions have at least pretended to be agreed? And has not this Title been recognized in most solemn Prayers and Thanksgivings to Almighty God, when Men could not prevaricate without the vilest Hypocrisy? I know there has a Noise been made about indefeasible hereditary Right, and the like; but the Advocates for that Scheme have not duly considered, that <HI>that</HI> Doctrine will invalidate the Right of any Prince upon Earth; for upon their Hy∣pothesis, there can be but one Person in the Universe, that has any Right to be a King, and he must prove himself descended in a right Line from the eldest Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> the Consequence of which must be Disorder, Anarchy, Confusion.</P>
<P>But, this Hypothesis will appear altogether whimsical, whether we consult the Laws of God, or the Laws and Customs of our own Country. If we consult the Scriptures, we shall there find <HI>David,</HI> who was of another Tribe and Family, succeeding <HI>Saul; Solomon</HI> suc∣ceeding <HI>David,</HI> in Preference to his elder Brother; and <HI>Jehoahaz</HI> pre∣fer'd to <HI>Jehoiakim;</HI> with many other Instances. If we consult the Laws and Customs of our own Country, we shall find, that from <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> to his present Majesty King GEORGE, (in which Time we have a Succession of thirty and one Kings and Queens) we have not had above four, who have succeeded one another in (what is called) <HI>the right Line;</HI> and we shall there likewise find, that in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> it was enacted High Treason to question the Power of Queen and Parliament to limit and bind the Crown, and the Descent and Inheritance thereof. These Authorities shew (beyond all Contradiction) that his Majesty's Title to the Crown of his Realms is consistent with, and establish'd both by the Laws of God, and the Laws and Customs of the Land.</P>
<P>But, <HI>secondly.</HI> May not his Majesty have exercised some Acts of Tyranny and arbitrary Power? May he not have made his Will the Measure of his Actions, and govern'd by Lust, Prejudice or Fancy? How the Subject is to seek for Relief in such difficult Circumstances as these, is not my Business to determine: But this we are certain of, that nothing of this Sort can be objected against our Sovereign, by the most audacious and insolent of those Rebels that are, or have been in Arms against him. The Prerogative has not in the least been stretch'd beyond its due and proper Bounds. No Man has been de∣prived

It must be the Work of those mutinous Fiends, who first excited Rebellion in Heaven against the Almighty, and now against h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Vicegerent.</P>
<P>But, <HI>thirdly.</HI> May it not be said, that Religion is in Danger? Never, I believe, was there less Reason for this Complaint; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this by and by.—</P>
<P>Our <HI>Northern</HI> Traytors then have not even <HI>Fig-Leaves</HI> to cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Nakedness of their Cause, nor the least Shadow of Reason to ex∣cuse or palliate their Perjury and Treason.

<P>But I am willing to proceed to the very extent of this Case; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll now suppose (for Argument sake) such a Thing as <HI>indefeasible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reditary Right,</HI> founded in Reason, Scripture, and the Laws of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and.</P>
<P>I will suppose, contrary to Experience and Matter of Fact, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ajesty King GEORGE has exceeded the Limits prescrib'd to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erogative, and in some Instances abused the Power lodg'd and en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted in his Hands. I will further suppose, that the <HI>Protestant Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion</HI> has not met with all the Countenance and Encouragement which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sanguine and zealous Ministers might probably expect.—And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st,</P>
<P>Of <HI>indefeasible hereditary Right:</HI> Supposing this founded in Reason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ripture, and the Laws of the Land; yet those who make use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s Plea in favour of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> do manifestly <HI>beg the Question.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how do they know that the Man ridiculously called <HI>Prince Charles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grand-son</HI> to <HI>James the second?</HI> It is well known, that his <HI>supposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther's Birth</HI> was controverted in the Day of it by some; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers who allow'd the Birth of a Child, maintained that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>angled in the Birth, and that a supposititious spurious Brat was im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed upon the Nation. But be this as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will, every one that is at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quainted with <HI>English</HI> History, very well knows, that the Laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Land were so far from being complied with, upon this Occasion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t they were treated with Disdain and Contempt. These I take to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strong Presumptions, if not Demonstrations, against the Hereditary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght of the Father.

<P>Let us now, in the second Place, suppose his Majesty had in so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Instances abused the Power lodg'd in his Hands, had stretch'd the Prerogative beyond its due Bounds, and that the People were imme∣diate Judges of his Mal-Administration: Yet we know it is a settle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Point, and establish'd Maxim, that of two temporal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> always to be chosen. Now is there any Comparison between a Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who makes the Laws of the Land the Rule of his Government, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> does not pretend to set himself above them, altho' he may at the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Time be guilty of some Frailties and Mistakes in the Course of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Administration; I say, is there any Comparison between such a Prince and one who sets himself above the Laws, claims and exercises Power of dispensing with them at Pleasure, leaves all legal Securiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at Mercy, raises Armies in Times of Peace, to subdue and terrify hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Subjects, is an inveterate Enemy to the established Religion of the Country, and sworn to exterpate it; and to compleat all, borrows h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Maxims of Government from the arbitrary tyrannical Courts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain?</HI> Is all this chimerical?

You'l fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King <HI>James</HI> exercising a dispensing Power with the Laws; you find him, by virtue of this Power, constituting Privy Counsellor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judges, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers not qualified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Law: You'l find him garbling all the Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> entirely disfranchising some of them: You'l find him raising a standing Army, keeping it on foot in Times of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace, in order to accomplis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Designs, contrary to the fundamental <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vileges of the Kingdom.

<P>Behold then the glorious Change! Behold the Advantages! Behold the Chains, the Yoke, the present Propagators of Rebellion would hammer out for us and our Posterity!

<P>Let us now, in the last Place, suppose, that the Protestant Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any particular Denomination of Protestants, has not met with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Countenance and Encouragement their sanguine Ministers might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>obably expect.</P>
<P>It would be a vain Thing in me, to pretend to enumerate the Pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>leges and Blessings that not only the <HI>Establishment,</HI> but <HI>Dissenters</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Denominations enjoy, under the auspicious Reign of King GEORGE: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are many and great. It is not indeed to be expected, that any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overnment should subsist upon Earth without Malecontents and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctions: And it is well known, that nothing is more abused than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eligion, to promote the irreligious Designs of Hypocrites. But if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en had the real Interest of Religion at Heart, they would never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l upon such Means of promoting it, as must necessarily prove de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mental to it, and subversive of it: They would certainly choose to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>joy it in its Purity, tho' under some Difficulties and Uneasiness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n truck it for Superstition. They would, instead of flying to <HI>Po∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry</HI> for Refuge, use all honest Means for Redress; and if they should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l in this Respect, they would patiently submit, until God in Mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleased to relieve them, rather than subject their Country to <HI>Papal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ranny;</HI> their Laws, their Estates, their Liberties to <HI>Papal Invasion;</HI> their Lives to <HI>Papal Persecution,</HI> and their Souls to <HI>Papal Delusion.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fifth of November</HI> is still celebrated among us, and fit it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the Memorial of it should be handed down from Generation to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eneration. I may be bold to affirm, that no good Man unacquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th the hellish Conspiracy of that Day, could with the utmost Stretch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Invention, form to himself such a complicated Piece of Villany. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t tho' such wicked Designs Could not have even been suspected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ore they were in Reality detected; yet after repeated Deliverances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m the same Quarter, not to be apprehensive of Danger from such human Adversaries, is Infatuation; not to be awake and upon our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, is Distraction. <HI>Catholicks</HI> (as they are pleased to call them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vs, with the utmost Impropriety) are the same ravenous Wolves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, retain the same savage Disposition to the Flock of Christ, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y (according to their charitable Principles) think proper to stig∣matise
<PB N="15" REF="005749_0015_1026F4F2B4E853A8"/>with the odious Apellation of <HI>Hereticks;</HI> and as such, think it not only lawful, but necessary to exterpate them off the Face o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Earth.</P>
<P>Thus I have examined the most plausible Pleas that can be urged in Favour of the Rebels; and tho' I have supposed them founded in Reason and Religion, yet you see they are all strongly in Favour of his Majesty, and directly against the <HI>Pretender.</HI> The Disturbers the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our native Country's Peace, must have Recourse to some other ex∣tenuating Pleas; and what can these be but Ambition, Avarice, Disappointment, Revenge, Vanity, Self-conceit, patching up bad Fortunes, Levity, Fickleness of Temper, scheming Heads, a love o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> innovating in Religion and Government? It is not at all then to be wondered at, that Wretches should be given to change, who are in∣fluenced by such abominable Motives, from which I pray God of his Mercy to deliver us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ringleaders</HI> of the <HI>unnatural Rebellion</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we have great Reason to think, have met with their just Deserts: (the Offences of the Nation must be very great, and their Sins in a man∣ner desperate, if Rebellion and Perjury are permitted to prosper). But however culpable and unpitied they fall, their wretched and misled Dependants, who never considered the Consequences of this atrocious Villany, are really Objects of Pity and Compassion. I am perswaded that the most barbarous among them, would have trembled at the Thoughts of taking up Arms against the Government, had they been before-hand expostulated with in this Manner: You are now entering upon a dark and dismal Scene of Blood, Disorder and Confusion You are going to do you know not what, for the sake of you know not who! That you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whimsical Notions of some Body's Right may take Place, you are going to join the inveterate Enemy of you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country, the perfidious <HI>French King,</HI> (who aims at no less than Uni¦versal Sway, to subject to himself all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI>) to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ruin not only of the Publick, but the exterpation of your selves: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you miscarry in the Villany, you sacrifice Wives and Families to Name, and you your selves die as Fools. If you succeed, it will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thro' Seas of innocent Blood; thousands are like to suffer, with who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you never had the least Quarrel or Misunderstanding: Parents wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be butchered, Children will perish and starve, the Trade of the Coun∣try will be clogg'd and obstructed, and the Growth of it utterl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consumed; the Consequences of which must be Misery and Famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
<PB REF="005749_0016_1026F4F458DCB348"/>And besides, all this Mischief, all this Destruction spring only from Notion; for you have not the least Prospect of making your selves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er or easier, but you are embarking into the greatest Danger, without the least Appearance of any Good accruing from it. Finally, you are going to put your selves under the Direction of Persons who have Policy enough to contrive, cunning enough to dissemble, In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nuation enough to perswade, Dexterity enough to execute any Mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief, and no Sense of common Honesty to restrain them, no Princi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les of sound Religion to controll them.

<P>Against the <HI>united Strength</HI> then of all his Majesty's Enemies, all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue <HI>Englishmen</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> have a Call to join with Heart and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, to unite their scattered Forces for the preservation of our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivil Constitution,</HI> and that <HI>Church</HI> which is the Fence of the <HI>English</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws and Liberties, the Eye of the Reformation, and the never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iling Bulwark against <HI>Popery;</HI> and for these Reasons has been, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er will be most vigorously attack'd by <HI>Papists,</HI> and its Subversion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>defatigably and maliciously studied.</P>
<P>We are indeed removed at too great a Distance to be aiding and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>isting to our distress'd Brethren; were we nearer them, they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d we have Hearts as warm and well affected, and Hands as ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> execute as they. Wise was the Observation of <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olsome the Advice he gave to the <HI>Nobles,</HI> the <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Peo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> Neh. 4. C. 19, 20. v. <HI>The Work is great and large, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d we are separated upon the Wall, one far from another: In what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace therefore ye hear the Sound of the Trumpet, resort ye thither unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; our God shall fight for us.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot, my Brethren, resort to his Majesty's <HI>Standard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sound of the Trumpet;</HI> but we may to the God and Father of all: Altho' we cannot with our Hands, yet we may assist our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llow-Subjects by our Prayers. Let us then supplicate, in the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mble and fervent Manner, the great and infinitely wise God, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te our <HI>Nobles, Rulers,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>People,</HI> in the Defence t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hose <HI>Ramparts</HI> which the Wisdom of our Law-givers has provi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> against the Assaults of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power;</HI> that this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t,</HI> this <HI>large</HI> Work may be carried on by joint Assistance and
<PB N="17" REF="005749_0017_1026F4F634825A30"/>well-concerted Measures, and that those who at present may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epa∣rated too far from one another, may draw nearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether for their common Defence, and that every one in his Place and Station may diligently labour in this necessary Work, and that under the Guidance and Direction of God's blessed Spirit, Prudence may direct the Con∣sultations of those that are set over us, that they may prove a Wea∣pon of Defence against the treacherous Designs of our most subtle and inveterate Enemies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Curse of God,</HI> says the Prophet <HI>Zechariah, shall enter into the House of him that sweareth falsly by my Name; and it shall remain in the midst of his House, and shall consume it, with the Timber thereof, and with the Stones thereof.</HI> 5. C. 4. v. It is really melancholy, to see any of our Countrymen thus expose themselves to the Curse of God: But however, it is Matter of some Consolation, that this Curse will attend the Cause they have espoused; will be a dead Weight upon it, and finally sink it. Oh! may we never then entertain a Thought of such Perfidiousness and Perjury; but in all Respects be∣have ourselves in a loyal and dutiful Manner to our gracious King, as our Church instructs and obliges us. The next great Duty to Piety to God, is Loyalty to our Prince, as God's Vicegerent and Minister. What Presumption then does it argue in Men, to pre∣tend to promote Religion by Sedition and Rebellion? It may as well be done by cursing, swearing and Debauchery. He that pretends Religion for an Excuse for rebelling, has lost what he contends for, before he begins the Contest. For how can any Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reason be called religious, who resists the Ordinance of God?</P>
<P>Let us then, <HI>my beloved,</HI> shew that we <HI>fear God,</HI> by <HI>honouring the King,</HI> and <HI>medling not with them that are given unto change.</HI> This is the Language of <HI>Scripture,</HI> this is the Doctrine of our <HI>Church,</HI> the very same that was taught by Christ and his Apostles, free from <HI>Popish</HI> or <HI>Fanatical</HI> Corruptions and Additions.</P>
<P>And now, may the great God of Battles guide by his Wisdom, protect by his Power, the sacred Person of his Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty King GEORGE; may Length of Days be in his right Hand, and in his left Hand Riches and Honour. May his Enemies be cloathed with Shame, but upon his Head may the Crown flourish. May his Royal High∣ness <HI>Frederick, Prince of Wales,</HI> inherit the Virtues of his Father, together with his Dominions: May his ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strious Consort be a fruitful Vine by the Sides of his House, and his Issue, those Olive Plants that
<PB N="18" REF="005749_0018_1026F4F942D0FA50"/>are round about his Table, prove certain Pledges of <HI>England</HI>'s Peace and Prosperity; and may there never be wanting one from the Loins of the illustrious House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to succeed in the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as long as the Sun and Moon endure. May his Royal Highness the Duke be safe under the Covering of the Almighty's Wings; and may the Enemies to the Peace of our Sion flee before him, as Dust before the Wind. Finally; may the Nobility, Ma∣gistrates, Officers and Gentry exert themselves in their respective Ca∣pacities at this critical Conjuncture: May the Glory of God, the Peace of the Nation, and the Salvation of Souls, be the principal Things to exercise the great Abilities of our Bishops and Clergy; and may the People of all Ranks and Conditions prove pious and well-affected, dutiful and loyal; may they <HI>fear God and honour the King, and med∣dle not with them that are given unto change.</HI>—This God of his infinite Mercy grant, for the Sake of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be ascribed all Power and Glory, Might, Majesty and Dominion, now and for evermore.</P>
