<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Sermon is inscribed to you as a Token of my unfeigned Affection to you. I have found by happy Experience, that the great GOD can, and sometimes doth bless very weak Means for the good of Souls: Else I could not have been willing to have appeared so publickly.</P>

<P>Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth; and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes; but know thou, that for all <HI>these Things</HI> God will bring thee into Judgment.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Desire with all my Heart and Soul, to bless the Name of the great GOD, who has inclined the Heart of so many to attend upon him in his House this Day.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004727_0005_100DCDFDAFA50968"/>
I thank, not only the dear People of my Charge, but those also of other Places, and especially you, that are in your Youth, for assembling your selves so readily into the House of the LORD, and coming to wor∣ship toward His holy Temple, and sit under the Droppings of His Sanctuary on this Day, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">General Election at <HI>Boston.</HI></NOTE> which you used to devote to Merri∣ment, vain and too often sinful Diversion. And while I see so large a Congregation, and especially such Numbers of young Peo∣ple around me; how might it animate me (if Possible) to say something on this Oc∣casion to you, that might indeed profit your Souls.</P>
<P>Depending on divine Help, I shall en∣deavour to offer to your Consideration, some plain and serious Truths from the Text now read, <HI>Rejoice,</HI> O <HI>young Man,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this excellent Sermon written by King <HI>SOLOMON,</HI> under divine Inspiration, the Point to be demonstrated was, that all world∣ly Enjoyments, carnal Pleasure, Wealth, Honour, and even humane Wisdom and Learning, are Vanity of Vanities; unworthy of any Esteem or Regard, when compa∣red with the Enjoyment of the Favour of God, the true Pleasures of Religion; and
<PB N="7" REF="004727_0006_100DCDFF9D04B9E8"/>that spiritual Wisdom, which is expressed in the filial Fear of God, and Conformity to His Will.</P>
<P>This Assertion our divine Preacher has proved, by an Induction of Particulars; and when he is come near to the close of his Sermon, he makes, what we should call, in an humane Author, an handsome Address to the Youth, in our Text and onward. And applys what he had said to them, to us who are in our Youth; as to those that are most prone to be led astray by the Vanities of this World: And for them to neglect the most solid and valuable Enjoyments, offered to the faithful Servants of the <HI>most High.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text begins this Address, and giveth us a Rule by which to measure our pursuit of this World's Enjoyments, and our indul∣gence of Pleasure, viz. <HI>The weight that all our Actions shall respectively have at the Judg∣ment-seat of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth—but know thou that for all</HI> these Things <HI>GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>As if he has said, "O young Man, or Woman, who takest most delight in the vain Pleasures of this Life, go on to rejoyce therein while in thy Youth, <HI>and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth;</HI> let nothing hinder, but every thing conspire to promote
<PB N="8" REF="004727_0007_100DCE01A1B17530"/>this youthful rejoicing; let thy Fancy and brisk Imagination chear thee, with the most pleasant Representation of all Things around you; thus adding to the rejoicing that even a Youth could otherwise indulge. <HI>And walk in the way of thy Heart;</HI> whatever way for worldly Pleasure, your youthful Heart and lively Imagination shall dictate to you, readily go in that Path, never fail of follow∣ing such a Tract. — <HI>And in the sight of thine Eyes.</HI> If your Eyes discover any Object that your Heart desires; pursue and obtain it: Let your outward Senses, lively Fancy, youthful Briskness and merry Indulgencies all increase the Pleasures of your early Years: But know it for a certainty, that all these Things must be called over again, at the great Day of Accounts. It may be, many of your early Pleasures are concealed from the view of Men; but the great GOD will bring them into Judgment, will publish them all in open Day, before all the Worlds of Men and Angels; and will sentence you according to their strict Demerit." Know it, O young People, that hear me, that all your youthful Pleasures, chearful Amusements merry Days and Nights and Hours, shall be remembred then, and have their just weight in the Sentence of <HI>that Day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004727_0008_100DCE03359B1178"/>
This Text is therefore, a <HI>serious Exhorta∣tion</HI> to the Youth, to take the Comfort of their Life, and the Pleasure proper to their Age; only to regulate even their chearful Seasons, by a due Remembrance of <HI>the Day,</HI> when they must appear at the Bar of CHRIST, and render an Account of all these things among others. And the wise Man then tells us, we may have much Plea∣sure in youth: But that it must be such as will bear the Light of that awful Day.</P>
<P>Or, the Text is a <HI>cutting Sarcasm,</HI> where∣in the meaning is directly opposite to the literal Sense of the Words. And because King <HI>SOLOMON</HI> knew that young Persons are exceeding fond of carnal and worldly Pleasure, he bids them rejoice and chear themselves in it, to the utmost that their Heart could wish. "Be merry, O young People, as you please, as you can; but be so at your Peril: Know that the great GOD sees you, will bring you to Judgment, and pass a Sentence infinitely just upon you; for <HI>all</HI> these things. This Last, seems to me the true Sense of the Text. But be it either; the Words naturally afford us this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That young People should indulge themselves, in no more Chearfulness and Merriment, than they can give a good Account of, to the great</HI> JUDGE.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004727_0009_100DCE0660AB6740"/>
It is equally true, that no Persons of what∣ever Age, should indulge themselves in any sort of Pleasure of which they cannot give a good Account at the great DAY. But because the Text is, as I said, an Address to the Youth, and the Occasion, and the Numbers of the Age in this Assembly, de∣termine me to express the Observation as above: For the Word of the LORD is un∣to you, O young People, in special: For <HI>each</HI> of you: and therefore let me beg, and let me have, your most serious Attention.</P>
<P>The general Proposition is directly prov∣ed by the Text: Rejoice — but go no further in your rejoicing than you can, when under the full and proper Sense, that it must soon be accounted for. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a Chearfulness and Rejoicing that is allowable</HI> Eccl. 7.14. <HI>In the Day of Prosperity be J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ful.</HI> We should take notice of, and take pleasure in, the Expressions of divine Bounty towards us. Our Spirits should be cheared when we experience, or reflect on His Blessings: But then this Joy and Chear∣fulness, should always be a Joy of Thanks∣giving. This Joy of Heart should be, in a sort, an inward, habitual Thankfulness to the Author of our Comfort. Ps. 95.1, 2. <HI>O come let us sing unto the LORD: Let us make a joyful noise, unto the rock of our Salvation.
<PB N="11" REF="004727_0010_100DCE081B01C5C8"/>Let us come before his Presence with Thanksgi∣ving, and make a joyful Noise unto him with Psalms,</HI> compar'd with 1 Thes. 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. <HI>In every Thing give Thanks,</HI> And, James 5.3. — <HI>Is any merry, let him sing Psalms.</HI></P>
<P>There is a rejoicing in the Lord, that the Saints should exercise both in Prospe∣rity and Adversity, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.4. an holy, hum∣ble Joy in this, that the LORD is infinite in all his Attributes, and that he is their Portion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Chearfulness we speak of, should be of such a King and Degree, as the Person indulging it, can give a good Account of, to the great Judge.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only offer a few Reasons to con∣firm this Proposition, and pass to the Ap∣plication.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because it is absolutely certain, that <HI>there is a Judgment Day approaching.</HI> This is an Article of the Christian Faith, plainly revealed and absolutely asserted in our Bi∣ble. In the Text particularly, <HI>Know thou that for all these Things God will bring thee into Judgment. Know Ye,</HI> is a Term an humane Conveyance denoting absolute Certainty: And a like Phrase is used in our Text, set∣ting forth the Certainty of the Judgment Day; <HI>Know thou — Rev.</HI> 20.11, 12, 13. And I saw a great white Throne, and him
<PB N="12" REF="004727_0011_100DCE0B5D320B78"/>that sat on it, from whose Face the Earth and the Heaven fled away, and there was found no Place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great stand before GOD; and the Books were opened: And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life, and the Dead were judged out of those Things which were written in the Books according to their Works. And the Sea gave up the Dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the Dead which were in them: and they were judged, every Man according to their Works. After these Texts you do not deny the Certainty of the Day of Judgment; you dare not deny it.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because all the Kinds &amp; Degrees of Men's rejoicing and chearfulness, <HI>shall be brought into Judgment.</HI> They shall be reckoned for, Eccl. 12.14. <HI>For God shall bring every Work into Judgment, with every secret Thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</HI> And if every Work, with every secret Thing, then certainly, every cheerful, every merry Day and Hour; yea, and Minute; all the Circumstances, Kinds and Degrees thereof. O young People, You think perhaps this Consideration is very serious. It is so: But not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> serious than true. Every Mo∣ment that you spend in any sort of Merri∣ment,
<PB N="13" REF="004727_0012_100DCE0D6CB01BF8"/>shall be called over at the great Day of Accounts. Your Companions perhaps entice you; "Come, say they, Let us go and spend this Day, or this Evening mer∣rily; let us go to such an House; there we may sing, dance, carouse, and be as jolly as we please: we shall be out of the reach of our Parents; they won't hear us; and the Folks there, with not check us." Go, I say, Go, O vain Youth, with them; but maintain this Thought continually, That GOD's Eye is upon you, when you go, while you are there, and when you return; and observes every Tho't, every Word and Action, and He will bring you into Judgment for <HI>All</HI> these Things. Be cheerful as you please, under a proper, regulating, Heart-deep Sense, that every Degree of this Cheerfulness shall be accounted for at the Bar of CHRIST. Be profanely rude, or needlesly company with your vain Companions, if they are profanely rude, at your Peril; since all the Circumstances of your Merriment must be in full recounted by you before the great Judge, when Time shall be no more. And this surely is a weighty Reason, why the King &amp; Degree of your Cheerfulness should be such, as you can then give a good Ac∣count of.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004727_0013_100DCE1040A8A7C8"/>
<HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Because the infinite GOD is <HI>en∣gaged</HI> to bring Persons to Judgment for these Things. If only the most powerful Men, or even the highest Angels in Heaven, where en∣gaged to bring <HI>Persons</HI> into Judgment for these Things, <HI>they</HI> might imagine a possibi∣lity of escaping that Trial. For, it is possi∣ble the highest created Wisdom or Power might fail. But, O young Man, O young Woman, an infinite, omniscient Eye is en∣gaged to find thee, wherever thou mayest be; infinite Power, to bring thee to that BAR; infinite Justice requires it; and in∣finite Truth hath spoken it, Text, <HI>GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> Ch. 12.14. Indeed, Angels may be improv'd as Instruments, to gather all Nations, and every individual Person, to that great Assembly, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.41, 42. But they are no more than Instru∣ments; and if we might suppose them all to fail, yet all Persons should be gather'd before the Son of Man, when he shall come in his Glory, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.32.</P>
<P>And I appeal to <HI>You;</HI> Do <HI>you</HI> not believe this, That GOD Almighty is engaged to bring <HI>you</HI> to an Account at last, for every idle Word, for every idle Hour, for every merry Meeting, &amp;c? You do believe it: I suppose, not one Soul of <HI>you</HI> pretends to deny it. Ponder this, and say, Is it not a
<PB N="15" REF="004727_0014_100DCE1385166228"/>weighty Reason, why <HI>you</HI> in particular should have even your Cheerfulness, of such Kind and Degree, as <HI>you</HI> can give a good Ac∣count of to this infinite Judge?</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 4. The Fourth and last Reason is, Because the Judgment of that Day is <HI>Final;</HI> the Sentence for <HI>Eternity.</HI> There lies no Appeal from that Tribunal. You, you that hear me, Young and Old, can have no af∣ter Trial. When Sentence is passed upon you by the GREAT JUDGE, it is decisive: It determines your Case for Eternity, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. ult. <HI>And these shall go away into</HI> everlast∣ing <HI>Punishment; but the Righteous into Life</HI> eternal. Eternal! Everlasting! how ex∣tensive the Term! Stretch your Thoughts forward into Eternity: Think what, think how long it is. Oh! <HI>Eternity! Eternity!</HI> how amazing the Thought! It swallows up our Soul, and Words are useless. But consider, that the Sentence to be passed, at the last awful Day, shall determine your State for this endless Eternity. And think, if this be not a sufficient <HI>Reason,</HI> why you should take Care to have even your Cheer∣fulness, of such a Kind and Degree, as may, through Grace, have a favourable Sentence pronounced upon it; and a joyful ETER∣NITY the Consequence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<PB N="16" REF="004727_0015_100DCE15886EA160"/>
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>Is it as we have heard, That our Cheer∣fulness should be of such a <HI>Kind</HI> and <HI>Degree, as we can give a good Account of to the great</HI> JUDGE? Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. How <HI>strange,</HI> and <HI>inconsistent with this Rule,</HI> hath been the Conduct of the best Men among us! Who of us can say before the Heart-searching GOD, That, in our Days and Hours of Amusement, we have kept the Temper of our Soul, and all our Words and Behaviour under such Regulation, and ey'd so steadily the Glory of GOD, and the valuable Ends of Diversion, as now to be able to give a good Account of all those Things to the infinite Judge? Doubtless, not One. And is it not strange, that good Men, who in some measure know the Im∣portance of eternal Things, should act so inconsistent with this Rule? They therein act contrary to all the Rules of the Gospel. Good Men too, too often transgress the Bounds of their Duty; so that their Con∣duct is not a Rule for the Profane &amp; Youth∣ful.</P>
<P N="2">2. How amazing is their Conduct, who <HI>go on freely indulging themselves in carnal Plea∣sure;</HI> practising according to the <HI>figurative</HI> Sense of the first part of the Text: Some
<PB N="17" REF="004727_0016_100DCE18EA8577B0"/>there are, that will indulge themselves in useless Pleasures, to a very sinful Degree; and in Pleasures, in their own Nature highly Criminal; going on in such Course from Day to Day, and from Year to Year, as are in direct Opposition to the Apostle's Words, Rom. 13.13. <HI>Let us walk honestly as in the Day, not in Rioting and Drunkenness, not in Chambering and Wantonness.</HI> Doing <HI>the Works of the Flesh,—Revellings, and such like,</HI> Gal. 5.19, 21. Are there not many of you that have spent many an Hour, many a Night, in such Behaviour, as exactly answers the Description in some of these last Clauses? And that desire still to practice the same: indulging no other, than carnal, sensual Gratifications? Now, how amazing is it, that you can go on in such Conduct, when you know that our Text, and these last quo∣ted, shall look you full in the Face at the last great Day, and you must be judged by them! Verily, you go after your Pleasure, <HI>as an Ox goeth to the Slaughter, or as a Fool to the Cor∣rection of the Stocks;</HI> you are in extream Danger, that <HI>a Dart will strike thro' your Liver.</HI> How amazing is it to see rational Creatures, as your are, hasting to your carnal, sinful Pleasures, <HI>as a Bird hasteth to a Snare;</HI> when indeed, it is for your <HI>Life,</HI> for the Life of your Soul. The House of such Pleasure is
<PB N="18" REF="004727_0017_100DCE1B67C33AD0"/>the Way to Hell, going down to the Cham∣bers of Death, <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.22, 23, 27. One would almost think, That altho' you have read it so often in your Bibles, <HI>That the Dead are there;</HI> and <HI>that her Guests are in the Depths of Hell,</HI> still you know it not. But you, O young People, do know it, but you do not ponder it, while you go on to indulge sin∣ful Pleasures, for which you must give an Account; and yet can give no good Ac∣count of them. We are amazed at you, and you may well be astonished at your selves.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it as we have heard under the Doc∣trine; hence <HI>what unspeakable need have we all of an Interest in CHRIST!</HI> We heard, That the infinite GOD will bring each of us into Judgment, and pass a decisive Sen∣tence upon us, for even our Chearfulness and Merriment, as well as for all our o∣ther Conduct: Now, how much of our Time have we spent in such rude Behaviour, sense∣less Merriment and lawless Carousing, as we cannot answer for; but we know is di∣rectly contrary to the Will of GOD? How much have you formerly, who are now ad∣vanced in Years? How much have you late∣ly, who are now in your Youth! How many Evenings; how many Nights and Days too, in such Gaming, and such Di∣versions (without any Word all the Time,
<PB N="19" REF="004727_0018_100DCE1D9FF35A10"/>that was good to the Use of edifying) as, were it now put to your Conscience, you dare not appear instantly at the most <HI>awful Tribunal,</HI> and answer for? Nay, As to those Amusements that were lawful and seasona∣ble, how careless have we been of designing the Glory of GOD, or any valuable Ends. And will not the infinite Judge be strict to call over all these Things, as well as our innumerable Crimes of other sorts? He will be infinitely exact and just. Not one Mo∣ment. O vain Youth, that ever you spent in a sinful manner, but you shall be reminded of on the Day of Judgment▪ O then, how great is our Necessity of an Interest in CHRIST! How vastly do we all need it! For there shall none be able to stand at that Day, and give up their Account with Com∣fort, but those who have <HI>washed their Robes, and made them White in the Blood of the Lamb.</HI> Hence the Apostle's Desire <HI>to be found in Christ not having on his own Righteousness which</HI> was <HI>of the Law, but that which is thro' the Faith of CHRIST, the Righteousness which is of GOD by Faith.</HI> O young People, in particular, con∣sider how <HI>You</HI> need an Interest in CHRIST. And in his Blood, to wash away even the guilt of your vain &amp; careless Hours. Think seriously whether you dare meet the Soul-Piercing-Eye of the GREAT JUDGE, with
<PB N="20" REF="004727_0019_100DCE215D95DA40"/>that guilt on your Conscience: whether you do not find in your selves a real and unspeakable need of CHRIST on this Ac∣count. Think each for himself, for you must each stand or fall for himself. Some of you, I trust have been brought to see, in a great Measure, the Sinfulness of your for∣mer Merry-meetings, and unguarded, un∣christian Rudeness: with what Resentment do you look back thereon! and how do you see your need of CHRIST, even on that Account. O that every Soul of you may be seasonably brought to a true Sight there∣of!</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Use,</HI> Of Exhortation, into two Bran∣ches, unto the whole Congregation.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Branch.</HI> Let us order our whole Con∣versation, and especially our <HI>Merriment and Chearfulness</HI> by this Rule, viz. <HI>So as we may be able to give a good Account of it.</HI> Let us see to it, that it be always of such a Kind and Degree, as we may indeed be able to hold up our Head with Comfort, on that most <HI>important</HI> Day, and freely own what we have done; that we may then be willing to re∣member, that thus we spent such an Even∣ing, or such an Hour, when it was our Du∣ty to amuse our selves, and a little unbend the Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004727_0020_100DCE2497CB3F60"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> You will perhaps ask me, <HI>How shall we do this?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer in a Word, <HI>Conform your whole Conversation, particularly in your more</HI> amusing Seasons, <HI>wholly to the Word of GOD.</HI> That should certainly be the Rule whereby your whole Conduct should be squared. That should be <HI>a Light to your Feet, and a Lamp un∣to your Path.</HI> For, it shall be the Rule by which you shall be judged at the great Day, — <HI>GOD shall judge the Secrets of Men by JESUS CHRIST</HI> according to my Gospel, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.16. i. e. According to the holy Word of GOD, of which <HI>Paul</HI> was a Preacher. Psal. 119.9. <HI>Wherewith shall a young Man cleanse his Way,</HI> from all Iniquity? <HI>by ta∣king heed thereto, according to GOD's Word.</HI> And is it not reasonable, that the <HI>Conduct</HI> of your most unguarded Hours, should now be conformed to the Rule by which it must be tried and sentenced at the last?</P>
<P>In particular, Your Diversions must be such, as in their <HI>Kind</HI> and <HI>Degree,</HI> their <HI>Sea∣son, Length of Time</HI> and <HI>designed End</HI> are glo∣rifying to GOD; or they cannot answer that general Rule in his Word, 1 Cor. 10.31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do</HI> All <HI>to the Glory of GOD.</HI> Yet by this Rule shall your Diversions be tried.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004727_0021_100DCE269EC46F30"/>
<HI>Object.</HI> But young People especially will object, <HI>That to act with such a continual Re∣gard to the Day of Judgment, will take away all the Comfort of their Life; and especially of their merry Days and Hours.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Answer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What if it doth as the Objection says?</HI> Think seriously, O young People, on a few Things. Is it not a Reality that there is such a Judg∣ment Day coming? You do not, nor dare you deny it. By going on careless and free in Sin, you might perhaps keep the Tho'ts of that Day out of your Mind a little while: But is it not better, much more prudent and safe, to act agreable to the real Nature of Things? Or had you rather go on in vain Courses, taking your fill of carnal Pleasures, as in a Dream, fancying that there will be a Reckoning-Day, when all these Things shall be brought into Judgment; but not realizing it, till you shall be suddenly sur∣prized by that Day? Would you choose this? Can you think this safer, than to be deprived of your carnal, vain Delights? Or even of all that you call Pleasure in this World?</P>
<P>Is not the Sentence to be passed on <HI>every One</HI> at that Day for Eternity? And is it not reasonable then, that in your Diversions you should be so far impressed with a Sense
<PB N="23" REF="004727_0022_100DCDB1B1DC9660"/>of that Day, and that Sentence, as to keep you from acting, what you cannot then ac∣count well for; altho' it might at present deprive you of your Comfort? Think close∣ly upon this Question; and see if there is not great weight in it. Is it not better to be deprived of Comfort a Minute, than to suf∣fer the Torments of Hell a Thousand Years, for the sinful Pleasures of a Minute? You must grant, it is. And you know that if you so act here, as you cannot give a good Ac∣count of, nor obtain a favourable Sentence at last, you must suffer as many Millions of Ages in Hell, as you enjoyed single Mi∣nutes of Pleasure on Earth: And then be no nearer the End of your Misery, than at the first Moment it began. The Argument is very plain. Consider then whether this <HI>Objection</HI> against the foregoing Arguments has any Weight in it, supposing the Ob∣jection it self were true. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Objection it self is <HI>false &amp; groundless.</HI> For infinite Wisdom it self assures us that the Ways of Wisdom are Ways of Pleasant∣ness, and that <HI>All</HI> her Paths are Peace. And Experience has ever witnessed to the Truth of this Observation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The penitential Person, as his Tears are the Joy of Angels, so they are the Joy of his Heart, and the solace of his Soul; the salter his Tears, the sweeter his Comforts; the deeper his Sighs, the fuller his Joy; the Beams of Consolation always shine into this House of Mourn∣ing, so that his Soul is in travel with a <HI>Barnabas.</HI> and his Labours bring forth the Fruits of Peace; insomuch, that I may truly say, To mourn for Sin, is to weep for Joy. These pure and pleasant Streams of Consolation, (which is the Worldlings Wonder) that flow and run in those Chrystal Rivers of eternal Pleasures, at GOD's Right Hand, they come from a weeping Spring. Why then is the Mouth of Wickedness opened against the Way of Holiness? As if Grace were the <HI>Calvary</HI> to entomb Joy, and Impiety the very Womb to bring forth Felicity; but if Experience may be heard, my Soul hath felt both, and I find such Damps of Spirit in worldly Pleasures, and such refreshing of Soul in the Depth of godly Sorrow, that I shall esteem one Drop of spiritual Joy better than an Ocean of their carnal Mirth." <HI>Divine Breathings.</HI></NOTE>. In deed you
<PB N="24" REF="004727_0023_100DCE2C090831E0"/>often see Persons convinced of, and deeply humbled for their Sins;-their Souls are bow∣ed down within them; but ask the Person that us'd to be vain and careless, and took as much seeming Delight in Frolicking and Merriment as any of you; and is now brought down even to the Dust for his Sins, deeply repenting before GOD; and he will tell you, he has unspeakably more Satisfac∣tion in the Depth of Humiliation and Re∣pentance, than ever he had in his merriest Nights &amp; Days. I believe there are many young People in this Congregation that are ready to witness for this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preached at a Time of general Awakening, especially among <HI>YOUNG PEOPLE.</HI></NOTE>. And if the
<PB N="25" REF="004727_0024_100DCE2E029919A0"/>Satisfaction of Soul, in the Depth of Humi∣liation and Sorrow for Sin far exceeds in Pleasantness, all vain and sinful Gratifica∣tions and Merriment, how far superiour is the religious Delight in the Soul; when the poor humbled Sinner is raised out of the Dust, bro't up out of the horrible Pit, and the miry Clay, and his Feet are set upon a Rock? When the weary Soul finds rest in CHRIST; and receives the Spirit of A∣doption, breathes a Child-like Temper to∣wards his heavenly Father, and feels his Fa∣ther and his dearest Saviour manifesting di∣vine Perfection and divine Love unto him. And when he tastes heavenly Joy in the sweet Incomes of divine Grace; even the Joy of the HOLY GHOST, when his Soul is filled with the Love of GOD, Oh! how far doth this exceed all the Pleasures of Sin? How doth it render them exceeding bitter, in the Remembrance of them!</P>
<P>How unreasonable is the Objection when such Delights as these are offered to you, in lieu of those Things, which may not be cal∣led Pleasures, without an Epithet, to show that they are vain, hateful and dangerous! <HI>But more of this afterward.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps some will grant the former Ob∣jection is answered, and they intend here∣after to conduct themselves so as they may
<PB N="26" REF="004727_0025_100D87A926C93EB8"/>be able to give a good Account even of their Hours of Diversion. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Object.</HI> That <HI>they cannot begin immediate∣ly so to do,</HI> and that it will be Time enough when they have spent so many Days more, or have answered such and such Agreements with some vain Companions, or the like.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer <HI>in general</HI> to this, That e∣very one of us, from this Moment, should so act at all Seasons, as we may able to give a good Account thereof to the Great Judge.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If you are resolved to go on in Sin, one Day, or one Hour more, you are this Moment an unconverted Wretch. A true Convert may, thro' the <HI>Power</HI> of Temptati∣on, design to commit some one Sin, as <HI>David</HI> premeditated the Murder of <HI>Uriah:</HI> but for any one deliberately to design a continu∣ance in Sin, and to delay turning from Sin to GOD, is an undeniable Token that he is in love with Sin, and, by consequence still at Enmity with GOD. For the true Con∣vert, who loves the Lord JESUS CHRIST in sincerity, thinks the Time long already that he has lived in Sin; and that it is high Time to cease Crucifying the LORD of LIFE.</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps you may not have <HI>Time</HI> to re∣pent, <HI>after the present Day, You</HI> know you are
<PB N="27" REF="004727_0026_100DCE30970FC348"/>uncertain, whether your Soul shall not be required of you this Night. And if it should, will it be Time enough hereafter to repent and turn from all Sin to GOD? You will indeed have an Eternity to repent in, but then your Repentance will be in vain, there shall then remain no more Sacrifice for <HI>your</HI> Sins, <HI>who</HI> have not repented till the Decree has brought forth against you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Besides, thirdly, the infinite GOD says <HI>To Day (if you will hear his Voice)</HI> harden not your Hearts. Ps. 95.7, 8. and, <HI>That it is time</HI> (this Day) to seek the LORD. Hos. 10.12. And will you say, hereafter is Time enough to repent of your Sins and effectually to seek the LORD? dare you impudently think or say, it will be Time enough for you to turn and seek the LORD, when you have had one Frolick more, when you have gone on in Sin a few Days, Months, or Years more? Knowest thou, O vain Youth, better than the alwise GOD, when is the <HI>best Time</HI> for you to repent and turn —? You say, No; but your <HI>Practice</HI> proves, you think you do, if you go on any longer in Sin, pleading that hereafter is Time enough for you to become strict and hearty in Gospel-Obedi∣ence: Or <HI>it</HI> plainly says, with <HI>Pharoah, who is the LORD that I should obey him,</HI> it is Time enough to obey him hereafter, as much as I
<PB N="28" REF="004727_0027_100DCE32930D4608"/>know of him, <HI>I will not</HI> yet <HI>obey him.</HI> This is the Language of the last <HI>Objection.</HI> Who is there among you, that dare any longer adhere to <HI>it?</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps the young People that hear me, will think <HI>mine</HI> a thankless <HI>Office</HI> to Day; while I endeavour to make them heart-sick of their sinful Pleasures, unless I direct them to superior Delight. Therefore the</P>
<P>2d. <HI>Branch</HI> of the Exhortation is. <HI>Get an Interest in JESUS CHRIST, and then may you rejoice on the best Foundation.</HI></P>
<P>Now in order this,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>You must be deeply convinced of your</HI> Origi∣nal <HI>and</HI> Actual <HI>Sins.</HI> Of indwelling Sin, and it's out-breakings. Of the Danger you are in of eternal Death and Misery▪ Of your Vileness and Pollution in the sight of an Holy GOD. On these Accounts you must be deeply humbled, <HI>weary and heavy-laden.</HI> Mat. 11.28. You must find and feel that you have destroyed, but cannot help your∣selves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>You must</HI> hate <HI>and</HI> forsake <HI>every false Way.</HI> Every Sin; of Thought, Word and Deed▪ A Sin as dear as a right Hand, or a right Eye, must be hated and forsaken. Forsaking Sin and outward Reformation will never prove your Title to divine Joy and Pleasure, unless you inwardly hate <HI>Sin.</HI> And we cannot be∣lieve
<PB N="29" REF="004727_0028_100DCE34ABFD5658"/>you hate <HI>it,</HI> unless you forsake it, un∣less you turn from it in Affection and in your ordinary, allowed Course, and really grieve and mourn when you fall into Sin, tho' it be in secret. Yea, and grieve for your in∣ward, natural Disposition to Sin. Rom. 7.23, 24. Mat. 6.24. <HI>No Man can serve two Masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and de∣spise the other. Ye cannot serve GOD and Mam∣mon.</HI> And, by Consequence, ye cannot in∣dulge the Pleasures of Sin and have the true Joys of Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>You must really receive &amp; rest upon CHRIST alone for Salvation, by a true Faith.</HI> You must become really willing to take the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to be your Prophet, to teach you by his WORD and SPIRIT: your great High-Priest to make Attonement for your Sins, to procue the acceptance of your Person and Services with GOD, by His Merits and Intercession; your King, to sub∣due you to Himself, to reign over, assist and defend you, to judge and reward you. And when your Heart it melted into a true <HI>wil∣lingness, thus to take CHRIST on his own Terms,</HI> and to devote yourself wholly to Him, (as is <HI>therein</HI> implied) the Soul indeed chooseth Him, and closeth with Him: And when you have so done, actually depend upon His
<PB N="30" REF="004727_0029_100DCE3754A391C0"/>Love, Righteousness and Strength daily; and more evidently and explicitely in every religious Duty, in every Hour of uncommon Service, and uncom∣mon Temptation and Trial.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Thus do, O young Man, and thou mayst rejoice in thy Youth; thy Heart may chear thee, in the Days of thy Youth. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1, 2. Therefore being justified by Faith, <HI>we have Peace with GOD</HI> thro' our LORD JESUS CHRIST: By whom also we have ac∣cess by Faith into this Grace wherein we stand, <HI>and rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</HI> v 3, 4, 5. And not only so, but we <HI>glory</HI> in <HI>Tribulations</HI> also, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Come then, and lay your Heart to the great and leading Article of true Religion, viz a closing with CHRIST as your beloved and al-sufficient Saviour; and take Him in very deed to be your LORD and SRVIOUR.</P>
<P><HI>Ye careless and unawakened Sinners,</HI> let me call upon you, to <HI>awake and arise from the Dead, that</HI> CHRIST <HI>may give you Light.</HI> You see the DAY is approaching when you must give an Account of <HI>all</HI> your Conduct. Careless and merry as it is now, it must, in the Light of that Day, be weighed in the Balance of the Sanctuary; and it will then <HI>be found wanting.</HI> Consider, how terrible this would be to You; and importunately Cry unto GOD, by his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> throughly to convince you of your Sin and Danger; and lead you to CHRIST for Relief. O give not over seeking, until you have obtained both these Blessings. For obtain you must, or perish E∣ternally, you that are careless in your Sins, and not others for you.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="004727_0030_100DCE397A2D0930"/>
Ye that are <HI>awakened and deeply Convinced.</HI> Be much in Prayer for the saving Influences of the Holy SPIRIT, <HI>to melt</HI> your Hearts into a real Willingness to receive CHRIST on Gospel-terms; and <HI>to guide</HI> you to an actual Closing with him; and take Courage and come to Him at his Call Mat 11.28 Stir up yourselves, use your best endeavours to obey the Gospel-Call, strive with all your Might to enter the strait Gate of Conversion, and to be happily united unto CHRIST, that you may find sweet and glorious Rest to your Souls in HIM.</P>
<P><HI>Dear young People,</HI> You have had warning of the Danger of going on still in your Trespasses; and now are invited to JESUS CHRIST, the infinite, the lovely <HI>Saviour:</HI> I hope, <HI>some</HI> of you at least, will come at <HI>this Call,</HI> and resign yourselves wholly to GOD in CHRIST, and choose and acquiesce in HIM, as your Portion for Time and Eternity. Be en∣couraged to come to CHRIST, for Life and Salvation when you consider his Words, Prov 8 17. <HI>I love them that love me, and they that seek me early shall find me.</HI> What can be more!</P>
<P><HI>Little Children,</HI> Hear CHRIST inviting you to Him for safety, and assuring you, that He is ready to bless such as you are, if you will forsake all your Sins, believe in CHRIST, and always endeavour to be like the Holy Child JESUS. Mat. 19.14. <HI>But Jesus said, suffer</HI> little Children, <HI>and forbid them not to come un∣to me, for</HI> of such <HI>is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Know assuredly, whoever hears me, that, what∣ever Age your are of, whatever Circumstances you are now in, (if ever you accept the Gospel Offer.) you will have eternal Cause to look back on <HI>the Day</HI> of your <HI>Espousing</HI> unto CHRIST, with unspeakable
<PB N="32" REF="004727_0031_100DCE3B7A664970"/><HI>Gladness of Heart.</HI> Cant. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and therefore the sooner you are <HI>espoused unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Husband, even unto</HI> CHRIST, the better; that you may while here, taste and see that the LORD is <HI>good,</HI> and the Pleasures of true Religion <HI>very sweet;</HI> and have eternal Joy in sure Reversion,</P>
<P>Pray and strive in the diligent and hearty Use of all appointed Means, that such a Day may be hasten∣ed; yea, Reader, that this may be Day. Say, <HI>Come</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>take possession of my Soul by thy Grace, Come quickly!</HI> AMEN.</P>
