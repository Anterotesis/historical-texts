<P>THE FOLLY and VANITY OF A LIFE spent in the Pursuit of WORLDLY PROFIT, EASE or PLEASURE, COMPARED WITH A LIFE wholly employed in endeavouring to GLORIFY GOD, and DO GOOD to MANKIND; ILLUSTRATED IN SOME ACCOUNT Of the pious Lady <HI>ELIZABETH HASTINGS,</HI> AND OF <HI>ARMELLE NICOLAS,</HI> A poor ignorant Country Maid in <HI>France,</HI> Commonly known by the Name of THE GOOD ARMELLE.</P>

<P>God hath sent me into the World for no other End than to love him; and by his great Mercy I have loved him to that Degree, that I can love him no longer after the Way of Mortals. 'Tis Time then for me to go to him, that I may love him after the Manner of the Blessed.</P></Q>

<P>IT is a very remarkable saying of our Lord and Sa∣viour to his disciples: <HI>Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</HI> It teaches us, that the dulness and heaviness of mens minds, with regard to spiritual matters, is so great, that it may justly be compared to the want of eyes and ears, and that God has so filled every thing, and every place, with mo∣tives and arguments for a godly life, that they who are but so blessed, so happy, as to use their eyes and their ears, must needs be affected with them.</P>
<P>Now, tho' this was in a more special manner the case of those, whose senses were witnesses of the life, miracles and doctrines of our blessed Lord, yet is it as truly the case of all Christians at this time: for the reasons of religion, and the calls to piety, are so written and engraved upon every thing, and present themselves so strongly and so constantly to all our senses, in every thing that we meet, that they can only be disregarded by eyes that see not, and ears that hear not. What greater motive to a religious life, than the vanity and poorness of all worldly enjoy∣ments? And yet who can help seeing and feeling this every day of his life! What greater call to look towards God, than the pains, the sickness, the crosses and vexations of this life! And yet whose eyes and ears are not daily witnesses of them! What miracles could more strongly appeal to our senses, or what message from heaven speak louder to us, than the daily dying and departure of our fellow-creatures does. Let us but intend to see and hear, and then the whole world becomes a book of wisdom and instruction to us. All the mistakes and disappointments that happen to ourselves, all the miseries and errors that we see in other people, become so many plain lessons of advice to us, teaching us with as much assurance as an angel from heaven, that we can no ways raise ourselves to any true happiness, but by turning all our thoughts, our wishes and endeavours after the happiness of an∣other
<PB N="3" REF="011654_0003_0F87C9DA007CA628"/>life. <HI>Octavius</HI> is a learned, ingenious man, well versed in most parts of learning, and no stranger to any kingdom in Europe. The other day, being just recovered from a lingering fever, he took upon him to speak thus to his friends: <Q>My glass, says he, is almost run out; and your eyes see, how many marks of age and death I bear about me: But I plainly feel myself sinking away faster than any standers-by imagine. I fully believe, that one year more will conclude my reckoning.</Q> The attention of his friends were much raised by such a declaration, expecting to hear something truly ex∣cellent from so learned a man, who had but a year longer to live; when <HI>Octavius</HI> proceeded in this man∣ner: <Q>For these reasons, says he, my friends, I have left off all taverns; the wine of those places is not good enough for me in this decay of nature. I must now be nice in what I drink; I can't pretend to do, as I have done, and therefore am resolved to furnish my own cellar with a little of the very best, though it cost me ever so much. I must also tell you, my friends, that age forces a man to be wise in many other respects, and makes us change many of our opinions and practices. You know how much I have liked a large acquaintance; I now condemn it as an error. Three or four chear∣ful diverting companions is all that I now de∣sire; because I find that in my present infirmities, if I am left alone, or to grave company, I am not so easy to myself.</Q> A few days after <HI>Octavius</HI> had made this declaration to his friends, he relapsed into his former illness, was committed to a nurse, who closed his eyes before his fresh parcel of wine came in. Young <HI>Eugenius,</HI> who was present at this discourse, went home a new man, with full resolutions of de∣voting himself wholly unto God. <Q>I never, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> was so deeply affected with the wisdom and importance of religion, as when I saw, how poorly and meanly the learned <HI>Octavius</HI> was to leave the world, thro' the want of it. How often had I
<PB N="4" REF="011654_0004_0F87C9DA20F0D898"/>envied his great learning, his skill in languages, his knowledge of antiquity, his address and fine manner of expressing himself upon all subjects! But when I saw, how poorly it all ended, what was to be the last year of such a life, and how foolishly the master of all these accomplishments was then forced to talk, for want of being acquainted with the joys and expectations of piety; I was thoroughly con∣vinced, that there was nothing to be envied or de∣sired, but a life of true piety; nor any thing so poor and comfortless, as a death without it.</Q> Now as the young <HI>Eugenius</HI> was thus edified and instructed, so, if you are so happy as to have any thing of his thought∣ful temper, you will find, that all the world preaches to an attentive mind; and that, if you have but ears to hear, almost every thing you meet, teaches you some lesson of wisdom. But now, if to these admonitions and instructions, which we receive from an experience of the state of human life, if to these we add the lights of religion, those great truths which the Son of God has taught us; it will be then as much past all doubt, that there is but one happiness for man, as that there is but one God. Was all to die with our bodies, there might be some pretence for those different sorts of happiness that are now so much talked of: But since our all be∣gins at the death of our bodies; since all men are to be immortal, either in misery or happiness, in a world entirely different from this; since they are all hastening hence at all uncertainties, as fast as death can cut them down, some in sickness, some in health, some sleeping, some waking, some at midnight, others at cock-crow∣ing, and all at hours that they know not of; is it not certain, that no man can exceed another in joy and happiness, but so far as he exceeds in those virtues, which fit him for a happy death.</P>
<P><HI>Serena</HI> is a lady possessed of a considerable estate, whose time and fortune is wholly employed in what is called a genteel, fashionable way of life. Now, agreeable to the doctrine of the Gospel, if <HI>Serena</HI> had been obliged by the necessities of life to wash
<PB N="5" REF="011654_0005_0F87C9DB4CEF7660"/>cloaths for a maintenance, to wait upon some mistress, or to procure a poor living by teaching little children, it would then have been her duty to serve and glorify God by such humility, obedience and faithfulness, as might adorn that state of life in which it had pleased God to place her. It would have been her duty to improve that one talent in the best manner she was able; that when the time came that mankind were to be rewarded for their labours, she might be received with a <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI> But as God has given her five talents, as he has placed her above the necessities of life, in the happy liberty of chusing the most exalted ways of virtue; as he has left her no∣thing to do but to make the best use of variety of blessings, to make the most of a short life, in studying her own perfection, the honour of God, and the good of her neighbour, it is her business and duty to turn her five talents into five more, and to consider how her time and health and fortune may be made so many happy means of purifying her own soul, improving her fellow creatures in the ways of virtue, and car∣rying her at last to the greatest heigths of eternal glory. As she has no mistress to serve, her own soul ought to be the object of her daily care; she is called to mourn for its impurities and imperfections, and study all ways and means of restoring it to its pri∣mitive purity. This, <HI>Serena,</HI> is your indispensible duty; for as sure as God is one God, so sure it is, that he has but one command to all mankind, whether they be bound or free, rich or poor; and that is, to act up to the excellency of that nature which he has given them, to live by reason, to walk in the light of religion, to glorify God in all his gifts, and dedicate every state and condition of life to his service.</P>
<P>Let us look now at a state of life, which draws the admiration and envy of far the greater part of the world, <HI>viz.</HI> the condition of those who have amassed great riches; a situation which our blessed Saviour de∣clares to be extremely dangerous, <HI>Luke</HI> 18:24. <HI>How
<PB N="6" REF="011654_0006_0F87C9DB9DF3C920"/>hardly shall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of heaven!</HI> And again, <HI>Luke</HI> 6:24. <HI>Wo to you rich; for ye have received your consolation.</HI> And yet a situa∣tion which multitudes are pressing after, many even without seeming to propose any other use from their riches, than the bare pleasure of amassing and pos∣sessing them. <HI>Negotius</HI> is a temperate honest man. He served his time under a master of great trade, but has by his own management made it a more con∣siderable business than ever it was before. The ge∣neral good of trade seems to <HI>Negotius</HI> to be the general good of life. As money is continually pouring in upon him, so he often lets it go in various kinds of expence and generosity, and sometimes in ways of charity. If you ask what it is that has secured <HI>Ne∣gotius</HI> from all scandalous vices, it is the same thing that has kept him from all strictness of devotion, it is his great business. He has always had too many im∣portant things in his head, his thoughts have been too much employed, to suffer him to fall either into any course of rakery, or to feel the necessity of an inward solid piety. If <HI>Negotius</HI> was asked, what it is he drives at in life, he would be at a loss for an an∣swer. He has several confused notions in his head, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is something great to have more business than other people, to grow continually richer and richer, and to raise an immense fortune before he dies. The generality of people, when they think of happiness, think upon <HI>Negotius,</HI> in whose life every instance of happiness is supposed to meet. Let us now look at this condition in another, but truer light. Let it be supposed, that <HI>Negotius</HI> was a painful labo∣rious man, every day deep in variety of affairs; that he was sober and regular in his business; that he grew old in this course of trading, and that the end and design of all this labour was only this, that he may die possessed of more than an hundred thousand pair of boots and spurs. Let it be supposed, that the sober part of the world say of him, when he is dead, that he was a great and happy man, a thorough
<PB N="7" REF="011654_0007_0F87C9E09AEF7260"/>master of business, and had acquired an hundred thousand pair of boots and spurs, when he died. Now if this was really the case, I believe it would be rea∣dily granted, that a life of such business was as poor and ridiculous as any that can be invented. But it would puzzle any one to shew, that a man that has spent all his time and thoughts in business and hurry, that he might die, as it is said, worth an hundred thousand pounds, has done more good for himself, than he who has taken the same pains to have as many of any thing else, when he leaves the world. For if the temper and state of our souls be our whole state; if the only end of life be to die as free from sin, and exalted in virtue, as we can; if naked as we came, so naked we are to return, and to stand a trial before Christ and his holy angels, for everlasting happiness or misery, what can it possibly signify what a man had or had not, in this world? What can it signify, what you call those things, which a man has left be∣hind him; whether you call them his, or any one's else; whether you call them trees or fields, or birds or feathers; whether you call them an hundred thou∣sand pounds, or an hundred thousand pair of boots. I say, call them; for the things signify no more to him than the names. Now as it is easy to see the folly of a life thus spent, there needs no better faculty of seeing, no finer understanding, to see the folly of a life spent in making a man possessor of ten towns be∣fore he dies; for if, when he has got all his towns or all his boots, his soul is to go to his own place among separate spirits, and his body to be laid by in a coffin, till the last trumpet calls him to judgment; where the inquiry will be, how humbly, how de∣voutly, how purely, how meekly and charitably we have spoke, thought and acted, whilst we were in the body; how can we say, that he who has wore out his life in raising an hundred thousand pounds, has acted wiser for himself, than he who has had the same care to procure an hundred thousand of any thing else. But farther: Let it now be supposed, that <HI>Negotius,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="011654_0008_0F87C9E12602FCD0"/>when he first entered into business, happening to read the gospel with attention and eyes opened, found that he had a much greater business upon his hands, than that to which he had served an apprenticeship; that there were things which belong to man, of much more importance than all that our eyes can see; so glorious as to deserve all our thoughts, so dangerous as to need all our care, and so certain as never to de∣ceive the faithful labourer. If <HI>Negotius,</HI> believing these things to be true, had entirely devoted himself to God at his first setting out in the world, resolving to pursue his business no farther than was consistent with great devotion, humility and self-denial; and for no other ends, but to provide himself with a sober subsistence, and to do all the good that he could to the souls and bodies of his fellow-creatures. Now, had this been the Christian spirit of <HI>Negotius,</HI> can any one who is truly in his senses, say he had lost any degree of true joy and happiness, by thus conforming to the spirit of Christianity: And yet I doubt not, but worldly Christians of every denomination will oppose, and endeavour to discredit such a representation of Christianity; but when you represent to your mind, how Christians ought to live unto God, and in what degree of wisdom and holiness they ought to use the things of this life, you must not look at the world, which lies in wickedness, and whose wisdom is foolishness with God; but you must look towards heaven. You must with the eyes of faith penetrate into the invisible world, the world of spirits, and con∣sider your order and condition among them; you must endeavour, by the help of grace, to put in practice the highest precepts of the gospel; you must think, how departed souls would live, if they were again to act the short part of human life, and what de∣gree of wisdom and holiness you will wish for, when you are leaving this world. Now, this is not pro∣posing to ourselves any needless perfection; it is but barely complying with the precepts of the gospel, which requires, that we <HI>be holy in all manner of con∣versation.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="011654_0009_0F87C9E1A1B79398"/>And as the holiness of Christianity conse∣crates all estates and employments of life unto God, so are we more especially obliged to observe this re∣ligious exactness in the use of our estates and for∣tunes, because, if we waste them, we don't waste a trifle, that signifies little; but we waste that, which might be made as eyes to the blind, as a husband to the widow, and as a father to the orphan. If a man had eyes, hands and feet, that he could give to those that wanted them; if he should either lock them up in a chest, or please himself with some needless and ridiculous use of them, instead of giving them to his brethren that were blind and lame; should we not justly reckon him an inhuman wretch, if he should rather chuse to amuse himself with furnishing his house with those things, than to entitle himself to an eternal reward, by giving them to those that wanted eyes and hands; might we not justly reckon him mad? for after we have satisfied our own sober and reason∣able wants, all the rest of our money is like spare eyes and hands; something that can only be well used, by giving it to those that want it. These tempers and this use of our worldly goods, is so much the doctrine of all the New Testament, that you can't read a chapter without being taught of it, particularly that remarkable passage at <HI>Matth.</HI> 25:31, 46.</P>
<P>The life of the pious lady <HI>Elizabeth Hastings</HI> is an extraordinary instance of the happy effect which Christianity has upon those who by joining with the calls of grace, become willing to give up their whole hearts to follow its dictates. This pious lady's first principle appears to have been the Glory of God, and the purity of her own heart; next to this a continual solicitude and labour to hold all her capacities, all her power and all her fortunes continually upon stretch for the good of all men, weeping with those that wept; rejoicing with those that rejoiced; given to hospitality; distributing to the necessity of the saints, and to those that were less so, having joy at the con∣version of a sinner, or the least appearance of it; but
<PB N="10" REF="011654_0010_0F87C9E261D44740"/>the care of all her cares was the stranger, the father∣less and the widow, the needy, and he that hath no helper, the lame, the halt and the blind. And in this place, says the author of her life, what shall I say! or how can I expect to be believed! The bent of her spirit ever lay towards these: She had a share in all their sufferings; she would often converse with them, and enquire into their history, with as much poverty of spirit, as they were in of outward con∣dition; she would study their particular cases, and put them in the way of better welfare. Some of these were ever in her house, and frequently in great num∣bers; and it was no neglect of her's, if any one went away unrelieved with meat, physic, raiment or mo∣ney; many of these that lived remote, had yearly allowances, and large sums frequently issued out into distant parts of the kingdom. Her still larger appli∣cations were fixed pensions upon reduced families, the maintenance of her own charity-school, contributions to others, &amp;c. &amp;c. She was a great mistress of all parts of oeconomy, with respect to what she laid out upon herself. Her body, she knew, was the temple of the Holy Ghost, which the believer must possess in sanctification and honour, wherefore her support of it in meat, drink and sleep was ever bounded by necessity; for they that walk in the Spirit, as this pious lady did, die progressively to every vanity, and dare not indulge the hurtful gratifications of the flesh, but labour to keep it under, as knowing it to be the seat and repository of their most dangerous and deadly enemy. Nevertheless she sought not her salvation by the force of her alms, highly affluent as they were; for these, though necessary duties, yet, she well knew, were not the charity of the gospel; not that charity which the Apostle Paul so divinely describes at 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 13:3. She was sensible, that Jesus Christ must be revealed in the heart, before we can have any just claim to discipleship, and that it is his ruling and bringing all things there in subjection to his Spirit that was the great and only principle of Christian
<PB N="11" REF="011654_0011_0F87C9E478433A90"/>charity. She knew, that the great scene of religion lay within, in the right government of the heart; ac∣cordingly her eye was ever upon her heart, to see that all its principles were cleansed from evil mixtures, had no taint from self-love, were not sullied with vain-glory; her care was to observe the tendency of all its motions, how its struggles weakened in sinful desires, endeavouring continually to nourish it by acts of faith and in the blood of her Redeemer. She had well learnt to overcome evil with good, to suffer long and be kind, to bear all things, and if ever by speech, carriage or otherwise she suspected, that she had disturbed the spirit of any, she had no peace with herself till she had taken care for the recovery of theirs.</P>
<P>Much more might be said of the endowments and virtues of this true disciple of Jesus Christ, more especially of her patience under sufferings, and re∣signation to Divine will; under the painful dispensa∣tion she passed through, during the last eighteen months of her life, occasioned by a cancer in her breast, which, notwithstanding she suffered it to be separated from her body, yet in the end occasioned her death. This painful operation she not only bore with patience, but even rejoiced, that she was counted worthy to suffer, knowing her Saviour had suffered in his flesh, and that, as sufferings was the way to his perfection, it must also be the way to ours, this being the declared condition of our being glorified with him; the truest marks of adoption, and the most sovereign medicine sent from heaven for our cure. These truths this truly pious Lady was so well acquainted with, that she declared, <HI>She would not wish to be out of her present situation, nor exchange it for any other at any price.</HI> Thus with great meekness and tranquil∣lity, with chearfulness scarce to be believed, in per∣fect serenity and freedom, she continued her usual life till the time appointed for the operation. When that time of deep trial came, she shewed no reluctance or struggle, but endured all even without complaint;
<PB N="12" REF="011654_0012_0F87C9E4A082C8D0"/>only towards the end she drew such a sigh, as the compassionate reader who reads this, may do. Hence it appears, how those that follow the Lamb with sin∣cerity, are endowed with virtue and power resulting from the true spirit of his religion, which others are unacquainted with. The night following the opera∣tion was not indeed a night of much sleep, but of truly celestial rest; a night of thanksgiving to her God for the visible demonstration of his power in her and about her, for his stretch'd-out arm in her great de∣liverance, for the bountiful provision her had made for her body and soul, holding all the powers of her spirit exercised in acts of love, gratitude and adora∣tion. She sooner than was expected got upon her feet, and, with every improvement that could be made, into the same way of life that she had been in before, wholly intent upon the glory of God, and the good of her fellow-creatures. But the distemper, only repressed for a time, rose upon with great malig∣nity, to the much greater affliction of numbers in the world, than of her that bore it; for she had now been, for some time, in the school of affliction, exercised with its sharp discipline, and found its salutary effects. Under these sentiments her hope was full of immor∣tality, and the eternal weight of glory, now in full view, made all her afflictions light. In this near and certain approach of death, her cherishing warmth, like that of the sun, though it might be most felt by those nearest, yet also reached those at greater dis∣tance; witness the great numbers of letters she writ, and dictated to others when she became unable to write, full of sweet counsel, having for their argu∣ment the blessedness of piety; pressing home the ne∣cessity of it, and setting forth its true nature; wit∣ness also the number of persons of all conditions who resorted at her house, to behold the living power of religion in her, and to be benefited by her wisdom. With some of these she continued in heavenly confe∣rence as long as she had strength. Her life was near drawing to its last stage; but her lamp and her life
<PB N="13" REF="011654_0013_0F87C9E55E8293D0"/>must be extinguished together, and she must occupy till her Lord comes. Accordingly she convened her houshold, to strengthen and enforce every thing that she had done or shewn them before, by her dying counsels; and would have extended this care to the whole village, but was restrained by the physician. <HI>The path of the just is as a shining light, which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> <Q>The truly re∣ligious, whose evidences for heaven are clear, ra∣tional, and well grounded, have a tide of joy springing up in their minds beyond expression; something more moving and satisfactory than any one can imagine, but they that perceive it.—When they are just entering upon the promised land, the splendor of the eternal day dawns upon them, and shines as through the breaches of their shattered bodies, and raises in the inward man such earnest of happiness, such foretastes of joy, as enables them to pass through the valley of death in peace and triumph.</Q> As death drew near, she was in trans∣port, quite melted down with the impression of glory, 'broke out with a raised accent into these words: <HI>Bless me, Lord! what is that I see!—Oh! the great∣ness of the glory that is revealed in me,—that is before me.</HI> And some time after she had so said, she fell asleep.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Christian's daily Conversation with</HI> GOD, Exemplified in a short Extract OF THE Holy Life of ARMELLE NICOLAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE person, whose daily conversation is here described, was not long since a poor simple country maid, and servant to a great family in <HI>France.</HI> The whole course of her life was very instructive, and a most shining pattern of a true spiritual conver∣sation.
<PB N="14" REF="011654_0014_0F87C9E639606E48"/>'Tis remarkable, that this person who served God with such unwearied prayer and watchfulness, was so ignorant, that she could neither read nor write, and was in the station of a servant, constantly employed in business and hard labour. Hence we see, that the true service of God is spiritual, universal, plain and easy, so that no person can be excused from it by any pretence whatsoever.</P>
<P>'Tis not so much the changing of places, or names, or modes and forms, or of any thing without us, as the changing of our will and heart, that will render our service acceptable to God. Hence the scripture declaring, what sort of change is to be wrought in a soul, requires a translation from darkness to light, (<HI>Acts</HI> 26:18.) from death to life, (<HI>Eph.</HI> 2:5.) and from being lost to be found again.</P>
<P>The Lord give his grace to all that heartily desire it, always to walk before him after such a pious man∣ner as this devout soul did! whereof she herself gave the following account to the author of her life.</P>
<P>As soon as I wake in the morning, I throw myself into the arms of my heavenly love, as a child into the arms of his father. I rise with a design to serve and please him, and if I have time to pray, I fall upon my knees in his holy presence, and speak to him as if I really saw him with my bodily eyes. I give my∣self up wholly to him, and desire him to fulfil all his holy will in me, and that he would not suffer me that day to do the least thing which might be offensive to him. In short, I love and praise him as much and as long as my affairs permit; though very often I have hardly so much time as to say the Lord's prayer. But I do not trouble myself about that; for I have God always in my heart, as well when I am about my business, which I do in obedience to his will, as when I retire on purpose to pray to him. This he himself has taught me, that whatever I do out of love to him, is a real prayer.</P>
<P>I dress myself in his presence, and he shews me that his love supplies me with raiment. And when
<PB N="15" REF="011654_0015_0F87C9E6DAA37D10"/>I go about my business, even then doth he not for∣sake me, nor I him, but he converses with me; yea, I am then as much united to him, as when I am at my prayers, set apart on purpose for my spiritual re∣collection. O! how sweet and easy is all labour and toil in such good company! Sometimes I perceive such strength and support in my mind, that nothing is to hard for me. Nothing but the body is at work, the heart and myself burn with love to God.</P>
<P>When the body begins to be weary, or to repine, or to desire unseasonable rest, being oppressed with uneasiness; my divine love enlightens me forthwith, and shews me how I ought to suppress those rebellious motions of corrupt nature, and not to nourish them at all, either by word or deed. This love keeps the door of my lips, and watches over my heart, that it may not in the least contribute to such irregular passions.</P>
<P>But if, at any time, for want of care, I am sur∣prised with these or the like faults, I cannot be at rest till I have obtained pardon, and God be recon∣ciled to me. I lie prostrate before his foot-stool, con∣fessing all my faults to him, and there I continue till he has forgiven me, renewed his friendship with me, and confirmed it more than before. If people perse∣cute me, and by foul and uncharitable censures raise scandals upon me, or any other way afflict me; or if evil spirits attack me with their crafty and cunning temptations, I then presently run to my heavenly Love, who readily stretches forth his sacred arms to receive me, shewing me his heart and wounds open for my security, in which I hide myself as in a strong castle and fortress. And then I am so mightily strengthned, that if the whole army of hell itself, together with all the creatures, should rise up against me, I fear them not, because I am under the protection of the most high God, his love being the hiding-place and safe∣guard of my soul.</P>
<P>If God at any time hides his face, making as if he would go away from me, I tell him, O! 'tis no
<PB N="16" REF="011654_0016_0F87C9EC2E3A9C28"/>matter, my Love, conceal thyself as much as thou pleasest, nevertheless I'll serve thee; for I know thou art my God. And then I stand upon my guard more than ever, to be faithful to him, for fear of displeasing my Love. And at the same time perceiving the great∣ness of my misery and poverty, I insist the more upon the merits of our Saviour, and resolve to rest con∣tented, tho' it should please him to leave me all the days of my life in such a condition. But he never lets me continue long under these circumstances, and if I may venture so to speak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</P>
<P>If I am persuaded on holidays to be merry in com∣pany, I excuse myself. For nothing can be compared to the pleasures of my Love, which are so much the sweeter and greater for my withdrawing from all com∣pany whatsoever. If people wonder, how I can stay always at home alone, I think within myself: O! if you knew the glorious company I have, you would not say that I was alone; for I am never less alone, than when I have nobody with me.</P>
<P>The night coming on, and every one going to rest, I find rest only in the arms of divine love: I sleep leaning on his holy breast, like a child in his mother's bosom. I say, I go to sleep, but being still busied about the love and praises of my God, till I fall quite asleep. Many times this love rouses up all my senses, so that I cannot sleep the greatest part of the night, but I spend it in the embraces of the grace of God, which never forsakes such a poor miserable creature as I am, but preserves me, and takes special care of me.</P>
<P>If in the night the evil spirits hover about, to tor∣ment or to surprise me, (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, it gives me grace too, to resist them courageously, as if I were awake. For they seldom continue long to as∣sault me, unless it be in my sleep.</P>
<P>And this is the life I have led for these twenty years past, without perceiving the least change of that
<PB N="17" REF="011654_0017_0F87C9EE31ACB0A8"/>love which was poured out into my heart, after my sincere conversion unto him. Nay, I have observed its daily increase, tho' every day it seemed impossible to endure any addition to what I already enjoy. But truly, it is an infinite love, which satisfies and nourishes me, so that every day I have a new hunger, tho' methinks I can receive no more, than what I possess already every moment.</P>
<P>THE author of her life says, concerning the man∣ner of her expressions, that they were always very modest, without any noise or vehemence: her com∣mon discourses were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly mis-spend their time in useless conversation and unprofitable talk.</P>
<P>For a long while she could bear no other discourse but of God and his holy love. <HI>I cannot imagine,</HI> said she, <HI>how a soul, created for heaven, can be concerned about the dross of this world.</HI> From that time, if she happened to be in company, where the subject of the discourse was but indifferent, either she did not mind it at all, entertaining herself in the mean while with God; or, as soon as she thought it proper, she diverted and changed the discourse; thinking it but lost time, which was spent in this trifles of this world.</P>
<P>To every body that had a mind to be acquainted with God Almighty, she gave this advice: To be silent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this (said she) is the be∣ginning of our union with God, and by these means the soul forgets earthly things, and raises herself up to the contemplation of heavenly objects. We ought to lose our familiarity with the creatures, if we desire to enjoy the conversation of the Creator, a moment of which doth afford more delight and satisfaction, than all the finest discourses in the world.</P>
<P>The real experience she had of the inward and spi∣ritual life of grace, and of the manifold operations it was attended with, doth abundantly appear from the larger account of her life and conversion.</P>

One time when her mistress was afraid that <HI>Armelle</HI> was like to run quite mad by an excess of devotion, she forbad her all spiritual exercises, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: <HI>Armelle,</HI> being sensible of the false step her mistress took, smiled within herself, saying, Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my Beloved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time, when I was seeking only God without me, and then I was mad indeed. This mistress of hers being of a sour and morose humour, shewed a deal of ill-nature to <HI>Armelle,</HI> of which, however, she never complained, but rather thanked God, that he was pleased to make this a means of her fuller purification. Some seeing what she suffered in hat house, advised her entirely to quit that place; she replied, according to her usual earnestness: Why would you have me flee from the cross which the Lord himself has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I shall never do it, except they turn me away by force. In which unexpected an∣swer her friends entirely acquiesced, never prompting her again to quit a place where she had daily oppor∣tunity to practise patience and self-denial; virtues so much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet so necessary for rightly framing a Christian life and conversation. At another time she said: If the soul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the insults of the devil, and of the creatures, are borne with joy and comfort. But this is misery indeed, when the Lord himself withdraws from the soul, and lets her shift for herself.</P>
<P>In what company soever she was, she talked of nothing more, than of being <HI>faithful to God.</HI> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than, <HI>Let us be faith∣ful, let us be faithful to the Lord.</HI> This word she thought fit for any time, and suitable to every com∣pany. Being asked by her friends, whether she had nothing else to say, she answered: Don't wonder at my saying this over and over again. If I should
<PB N="19" REF="011654_0019_0F87C9EF24274B78"/>live a thousand years, I should still tell you the same thing. For 'tis faithfulness, wherein the perfection of a Christian life consists.</P>
<P>Of the constraining power of the divine love she has the following expression: Whenever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations, (apt to steal in upon the mind under the specious pre∣tence of necessity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This divine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imaginable for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this reason keeps his eye constantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never so small, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <HI>says she,</HI> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me closely confined to an holy awe and wariness; and when I happened by one oversight or other to withdraw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment pur∣sued after me, and recalled me to my duty. But all this was done with so much love and tenderness, that it must be a heart of brass, if not mollified by such endearing marks of love and kindness.</P>
<P>She often wondered at some peoples dilatory doings in the service of God, and said, it was a cunning fetch and stratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another such designs as might serve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow-creatures. <HI>For,</HI> said she, <HI>it often hap∣pens, that that grace which at one hour offers itself to a man, in order to support him under some difficult enter∣prises, is not so easily met with at another time.</HI> And be∣sides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were sure to live longer, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to an∣other what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the service of God, must needs have but little love at the bottom. <HI>Wherever love is raised to any eonsiderable degree, there the soul can't rest, whilst there remains any thing to be done required by the beloved.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="011654_0020_0F87C9EFE0FF6B10"/>And this dilatory temper, <HI>she said,</HI> was a great in pe∣diment in the way to perfection. Many souls were convinced of the will of God, but being too back∣ward constantly to struggle against the corrupt pro∣pensities of their dull and lazy temper, they made but a slow progress in the work of religion. They say, to-morrow, to-morrow it shall be done in good earnest; but that to-morrow never comes. The consequence whereof is, that the longer they flatter themselves in their disorderly and wonted customs, the less able they are to resist them at last at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, since they did not improve faithfully what once they had re∣ceived.</P>
<P>Her humility was also grounded on a true and solid foundation. She confesses, that the infinite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride. I was astonished, says she, when I was told to watch against pride, for I thought whilst I was well in my wits, I could not possibly be proud. I was so fully convinced that every thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offered to per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> me to the contrary, I should never have be∣lieved them. And this sense fortified me against every kind of pride.</P>
<P>Because her love to God was so great and fervent, the love she bore to her fellow-creatures was also won∣derfully influenced and inflamed thereby. When she considered the woful state of the wicked, and the dreadful judgment that is like to befal them at last, she then felt a more tender and commiserating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compassion. When she looked upon the happy state she was ar∣rived to, and the severe doom attending such pro∣fligate wretches, she used to say, she seemed unto herself like one that had been in a great storm at sea, and by stress of weather like to be cast away every minute; but getting off at last safe and sound, re∣membered now ashore the dangers his brethren and near relations were still exposed to, being tossed up
<PB N="21" REF="011654_0021_0F87C9F09EC3D6D8"/>and down in the huge ocean, and left to the mercy of the roaring billows. Alas! said she, thus it is with me, when I lay to heart the danger sinners run themselves into. For the more endearing marks of divine grace the Lord has been pleased to bestow upon me, the more fervent is my desire, that also others might partake of the same with me.</P>
<P>AND now, ye learned men, and refined wits of the age, come hither and admire the ignorance and simplicity of this poor country-maid! Consider how far she exceeds your high flown superficial wisdom, and the dark flashes of human wit and learning? And was it possible for her to attain to this <HI>heavenly wisdom and divine knowledge,</HI> to such a nobleness and elevation of mind, without the scraps and assistance of artificial learning and philosophy? then truly there must be another school wherein those that <HI>flow unto the Lord,</HI> (Ps. 34:5) <HI>are lighted.</HI> Indeed <HI>to know the love of Christ, passeth all knowledge,</HI> Eph. 3:19. Con∣cerning which our Saviour was pleased thus to express his grateful sentiments with hearty joy and heavenly triumph: <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight,</HI> Matth. 11:25, 26. <HI>For it is written,</HI> (says St. Paul) <HI>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the un∣derstanding of the prudent? Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? But God hath chosen the foolish things of this world, to con∣found the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty. And base things of the world, and things, which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are. That no flesh should glory in his presence,</HI> 1 Cor. 1:19, 20, 27, 28, 29. Isa. 29:14. Chap. 33:18.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON Impartiality and Gospel Love, Recommended to the Notice OF THE Truly Pious of every Christian Profession.</HEAD>
<P>THE inspiration of God and the clear infor∣mation of the holy scripture assures us, that God reserves his choicest secrets for the purest minds, and that true holiness is the only safe entrance into divine knowledge. The apostle declares, <HI>Acts</HI> 10:34, <HI>That he perceived of a truth, that God is no re∣specter of persons; but in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</HI> Yet, notwithstanding the clearness of this and many more such doctrines contained in the scripture, sel∣fishness and partiality, those inhuman and base qua∣lities, are suffered to prevail even amongst such as are esteemed the most pious in the several divisions of the Christian church, so as to raise a flight, and often a kind of enmity, against those of other com∣munions. Nevertheless, the truly pious-hearted of every party are indeed nearer to one another than many of them apprehend; and it would on ex∣perience be found, that if each particular division of Christianity could produce but one man a piece, that had the piety of an apostle, and the impartial love of the first Christians, they would not want half a sheet of paper to hold the articles of union, nor be half an hour before they were of one religion, however they may differ in some external practices. If we sought truth for its own sake; if we loved our neighbour as ourselves; and, if we desired nothing by our religion, but to be accept∣able
<PB N="23" REF="011654_0023_0F87C9F21BB2C648"/>to God, this partial spirit would have no place with us. That universal love, which gives the whole strength of the heart to God, and makes us love every man as we love ourselves, is the noblest, the most divine and Godlike state of the soul; and religion does people very little good, but so far as it brings this perfect love with it. Perfection can no where be found, but in a pure, disinterest∣ed love of God and our neighbour. There is there∣fore a communion of saints in the love of God, which no one can learn from that which is called orthodoxy in the different sects, but is only to be had by a total dying to all worldly views, by a pure love of God, and by such an unction from above, as delivers the mind from selfishness, and makes it love truth and goodness with an equality of affection in every man, let his name and pro∣fession to religion be what it may. And by thus uniting in heart and spirit with all that is holy and good in all professions, we enter into the true com∣munion of saints, and become real members of the true universal Christian church. It is thus, that the angels, as ministring spirits, assist, join, unite and co-operate with every thing that is holy and good in every division of mankind. He that has been all his life long used to look with great slight upon those of other profession, must naturally ex∣pect, they will be treated by God, as they have been by him; and if he had the keys of the king∣dom of heaven, such people would find it hard to get a place in it. But it stands us greatly in hand to get rid of this temper before we die; for if no∣thing but universal love can enter into the kingdom of God, what can be more necessary for us, than to be full of this love before we die?</P>
<P>We sometimes hear people of great zeal declare on their deathbeds their strict attachment to the par∣ticular profession to which they belong, and de∣claring their disunity with all other churches; but
<PB N="24" REF="011654_0024_0F87C9F9296AC498"/>how much better would it be, if such a person was to say: In this divided state of Christendom, I have chosen to live and die in outward communion with the society to which I am joined; fully believing, that if I worship God in spirit and in truth in this divided part of the church, I shall be as acceptable to him, as if I had been a faithful member of the one whole church, before it was broken into separate parts. But as I am now going out of this disordered divi∣sion, into a more universal state of things, as I am going to the God of all churches, to a king∣dom of universal love, which must have its inha∣bitants from all people, nations and languages of the earth; so in this spirit of universal love, I de∣sire to perform my last act of communion, join∣ing in heart and spirit with all that is Christian, holy and good in all other churches; praying from the bottom of my soul, that every church may have its saints; that God's kingdom may come, his will be done in every division of Christians and men, and that every thing that hath breath, may praise the Lord!</P>
