<HEAD>A MEMORIAL Of the Present Deplorable STATE of New-England.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>New-England</HI> had for many Years before the Late Happy <HI>Revolution,</HI> Enjoy'd the Liberty and Property of as Free and Easy a <HI>Charter</HI> as a People could Desire; and this too, with as much Satisfaction and Loyalty on their part, as Malice and Envy on that of their Ene∣mies; who, from a Persecuting Spirit, looking upon this their <HI>Charter</HI> with an evil Eye, took up an Implacable Resolution of Robbing them of it. They had no sooner Effected this, but a vast Scene of Misery appear'd; and they found among the Principal Instruments of this Mischief, <HI>One,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The present Gover∣nour, J. Dodley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> is a Native of New En∣gland, Born at or near a place call'd Roxbury, 2 Miles from Boston.</NOTE> <HI>whom their own Womb had brought forth, and whose Breasts had Nourish'd!</HI> But the Unhappy (or rather Hap∣py) Reign of the Late K. <HI>J.</HI> running Precipi∣tantly upon its own Ruin, made well for the Deliverance of <HI>New-England;</HI> without which, doubtless the People had fell a Sacrifice to <HI>French</HI> and Popish Slavery:</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001331_0007_0FB27CAC11C15190"/>We shall not Recriminate here the Mismanagements of the then Governour Sir <HI>Edmond Andross,</HI> since that Gentleman is now in a Future State; but by the way, we think it highly Necessary to say some Matters of Fact, of the present Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> who, (un∣der the said Sir <HI>E. Andross</HI>) acted as President of the Council, and One of the <HI>Quorum</HI> in all his Affairs.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of this Man, so soon as he arriv'd, struck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the first Opportunity to discover him of a Mercenary Interest. In∣deed, the People were something Surpris'd to see the publick Offices and Places of Trust snatch'd from them, and Conferr'd on Strangers on one hand, and the Avarice and Beggary of a Crew of Mercenary Fellows, Supported by Extortion on t'other. But, when the Presi∣dent was pleased, out of an Active and Passive Principle, to tell our Countreymen, in open Council, <HI>That the People in</HI> New-En∣gland <HI>were all Slaves; and that the</HI> only <HI>Difference between Them and Slaves, was their not being</HI> Bought <HI>and</HI> Sold: <HI>And that they must not think the Priviledges of</HI> Englishmen <HI>would follow them to the end of the World.</HI> I say, when the People heard this, they lookt upon themselves in a manner Lost. On one Hand they saw their Enemies invested with a full Power in the Government; on t'other they saw themselves not only turn'd out of the Publick Ministry, but under a Necessitous Fear of being Quiet, lest their Estates should be Siezed, and themselves Imprisoned. On this side they saw their Wives and Children, their Fathers, Mothers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Butchered daily by a Handful of Barbarous Indians; on t'other side, little or no Resistance made by their Armies, which were Commanded by those of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion; insomuch that it seem'd rather an intended Massacre, than a Desire of putting an End to a Diabolick and Bloody War. They saw then, that they had to their Cost, brought forth a <HI>Prophet,</HI> who told them they were Slaves; and they then saw his Prophecy fulfilling; In fine, they saw all this, but per∣ceiv'd no way to Escape; till throwing up their Cryes to Heaven, they were animated by Divine Power, to Rescue themselves and Children from the approaching Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001331_0008_0FB27CAEDA27ADC0"/>Under the Pressure of all these Grievances, they Unanimously arose, upon the coming in of the late King <HI>William,</HI> of Blessed Me∣mory, Siezed the Government for His Majesty's Use; and, amongst the rest of the Authors of their Miseries, not unjustly Imprison'd this their present Governour.</P>
<P>From that time <HI>New-England</HI> took Heart, and concluded that Heaven was removing from them all the Plagues in their Land. They indeed Thankfully Rejoyced to see themselves Restored to their Ancient Liberty, as afterwards in a great Measure they were by another Ministry.</P>
<P>And thus much for the former Actions of the Author of the following Matters of Fact, which has rendred His Love to his Na∣tive Country, His Veneration for the Liberty and Property of a Free People, His Fidelity, Justice, and Loyalty, in delivering the Oppressed, and detecting the Queen's profess'd Enemies, but the Reverse of Good Mens Actions, and ought to be Remembred only as so many Monuments of Infamy.</P>
<P>But to come down to our Memorial, and inform the World of the modern Mismanagements of this unhappy Gentleman, we hum∣bly Declare, That</P>
<P>THE Trade with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> being so countenanced by the Governour, that without speedy Remedy, the Coun∣try is in great Danger of being Ruined, which will plainly Ap∣pear as follows:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> In the Year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. The Governour sent his Son, <HI>William Dudley</HI> with Captain <HI>Vetch,</HI> to <HI>Canada,</HI> under a pretence of Redee∣ming Captives; but brought very few back to <HI>Boston</HI> of those that were there, and them of the Meanest sort, leaving the Principal of the said Captives behind, to give them occasion of going again, that they might have a Pretence to Colour their Treacherous De∣sign of Trading, as Appears by the said <HI>Vetch</HI>'s Acknowledgment, of going to Settle a Correspondency with the Enemy, and carrying a Cargo out with him of 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which, according to their Disposal,
<PB N="4" REF="001331_0009_0FB27CAFC90A7FB8"/>
might amount to near 3000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as particularly Shot, which was Sold at 13 <HI>Sous per</HI> Pound; whereof they carried a considerable Quantity, also Rigging, Pitch, Iron, and other Necessaries, fit for supplying the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> and this done under a Colour, of the said <HI>Vetch</HI>'s going to get in a Debt due to him, from the <HI>French,</HI> of 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> with the Governour's Approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For Settling a Correspondency with the <HI>French</HI> Gover∣nour at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> for Exchange of Prisoners; Whereas, it was indeed, only a Cover for an Illegal Trade; when, at the same time, the <HI>French</HI> there, were drove to such extream Hardships, for want of Ammunition, Provision, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that most of their Principal People were forced to go out a Privateering on our Coasts, who were afterwards taken and brought into <HI>Boston;</HI> particularly one <HI>Battis,</HI> a Man of great Note and Service among the Enemy, who had been a Barbarous, Murdering Fellow, to the <HI>English:</HI> He, with all the other <HI>French</HI> Prisoners, were sent to <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and Discharged; but great part of our People that were Prisoners, were left behind at the same time, and that, because our Governour had been false in his Promise, to the <HI>French</HI> Governour, who had restrained the <HI>Indians</HI> from disturbing our Fishery, and indeed would not allow them any Ammunition for a considerable time, till our Governour taking that Opportunity of the <HI>Indians,</HI> great Want countenanced a Trade with them, and supply'd them by the Vessels that were sent as Transports (as aforesaid) to fetch Prisoners; when at the same time they were made Vessels of Mer∣chandize, as appears by the <HI>Indian</HI> Traders on their Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Country are at a vast Charge, in maintaining an Army Yearly, to March several Hundred Miles up into the Coun∣try, to Destroy the <HI>Indians</HI> Corn, the better to disinable them to Subsist; for they have been so Reduced (as by Information of the Captives) that a great part of them would Perish for Want, were it not for the Supply they had from the said <HI>Indian</HI> Traders; who par∣ticularly, Sold about Eight Quarts of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn for one large <HI>Beaver</HI> Skin; which Trade has been all along countenanced by the Gover∣nour, which sufficiently Appears, by his being always Unwilling
<PB N="5" REF="001331_0010_0FB27CB5D93BAFB0"/>
the Prisoners taken in that Trade should be Fined, or Punished, even owned by <HI>Vetch,</HI> as in his Petition more at large, is set forth.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Country was at a great Expence, in Erecting a For∣tification at <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> and maintaining a number of Soldiers for securing the same, thereby to suppress the Enemy, and keep sure Footting in that part of the Country; and the Governour, through some Design or Neglect, did suffer those Soldiers to remain there without any Commission Officer, to the great Dissatisfaction and Dread to the Soldiers; insomuch, that they Declared to Captain <HI>Cally,</HI> (a Member of the Assembly at <HI>Boston</HI>) that when the Enemy came upon them, they would Surrender the Fort, and dare not Resist for want of a Commission. Then Captain <HI>Cally</HI> made Ap∣plication to the Assembly, which he found Sitting when he came to <HI>Boston,</HI> and they represented to the Governour, that speedy care might be taken, that some Person might be Commissionated to Command that Fort, which, with a great deal of Difficulty, was at last Obtained.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> And further, as to the Governour's countenancing this Private and Illegal Trade, the Country has been at vast Expence, occasioned thereby; insomuch, that at one Sessions the last Summer, the Assembly were forc'd to raise 33000 Pounds, for Supporting and Maintaining the Charge they were put to, by the Enemies In∣vasions, after they had a Supply; that whereas, if things were rightly Managed, and the Enemy kept back for want of those Supplies, one Third Part of the said Sum might have answer'd the End. The <HI>Indians</HI> that were Supply'd by those Traders, are the on∣ly People that Destroyed our <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts, the Fishery, and the Coast of <HI>Accady;</HI> and also the very same that were at Destroying of <HI>New-found land;</HI> particularly one <HI>Escombu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> a Principal Comman∣der among them, who is generally one that Heads the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they come to Destroy the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> The Governour, with his Son <HI>Paul,</HI> not being Content with what Money they come fairly by, and over greedy of Gain, are very Screwing and Exacting upon the People, particularly up∣on sundry Inhabitants, taking away their Priviledge in catching
<PB N="6" REF="001331_0011_0FB27CB821168138"/>
of Whales, a Priviledge they have Enjoyed many Years before; that is, (under Pretence of Drift Fish) what Whales are taken by Her Majesty's Subjects, he takes from them by Force, not giving them the Liberty of a Tryal at <HI>Common-Law,</HI> but for his own Ends, decides the Matter in the Admiralty, where his Son <HI>Paul</HI> is the Queen's Attourny and Advocate, thereby Encroaching the whole to them∣selves, a thing never heard of before, and very much to the Preju∣dice of Her Majesty's good Subjects there, and that without Re∣medy.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> As to the Address the Governour Obtained, pretended to come over from the General Assembly at <HI>Boston,</HI> in his favour, for his Continuance, it was no more than what he Clandestinely pro∣cured, by sending to his particular Friends; such, who being ei∣ther Related to him, or bore Commissions under him, dare not deny his Request, and was never approved nor allowed of by the Assem∣bly; but on the Contrary, had not the Majority of the Country, waited in Expectation of Her Majesty's Favour, in sending another Governour, they would largely have signified their Resentments and Dissatisfaction, in the Administration of <HI>Dudly</HI>'s Government.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> While the Great and General Assembly at <HI>Boston</HI> were Sitting, there arrived a Flagg of Truce from <HI>Canada,</HI> with a haugh∣ty Demand of the Governour, for all the <HI>French</HI> Prisoners, charg∣ing of him with breach of Promise, which was the occasion of the <HI>French</HI> Governour's not sending several of the Prisoners, particularly a Minister that was taken Captive at <HI>Derefield,</HI> detained by the <HI>French,</HI> who might have been Discharged with sundry others.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> The Lower House, mistrusting the <HI>French</HI> Flagg of Truce coming upon a Trading Design, as well as for Prisoners, ordered the Flagg of Truce to be diligently Searched, who found on Board their Vessel sundry new Arms and Ammunition, hid in Private Places, particularly new Bullets, hid among Pease, and yet denied by the Commander, who was an <HI>English</HI> Renagado, which Ammunition being brought before the Assembly, were generally concluded to be Bought in <HI>Boston;</HI> whereupon, the Governour in∣terposing
<PB N="7" REF="001331_0012_0FB27CBB10385030"/>
the Matter was hushed up and Conniv'd at, to the great Dissatisfaction of the Assembly, and Country in general.</P>
<P>This being realy the State of <HI>New-England,</HI> and its Pro∣vinces, it may very well be called Deplorable, when it is render'd the very Scene of Arbitrary Power, with all that's Miserable: But to proceed, before I come down to the se∣veral Affidavits upon these Heads, it is Convenient to Recite some Letters from the Inhabitants of that Place, who, under a deep Sense of their Approaching Ruin, have breath'd forth their Complaints in the following Words.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Boston, New-England,</HI> <DATE><HI>October 2. 1706.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INasmuch, as you have Expected from me, a true and brief Repre∣sentation of several Matters, relating to this Province, I shall, with all possible Faithfulness, endeavour it. Our present Governour is not without a number of those, whom he has by Promotions and Flatteries made his Friends; but this hinders not a much more con∣siderable number, from wishing, that we had a Governour, who would put an end unto the horrid Reign of Bribery, in our Administration, and who would not infinitely Incommode Her Majesty's Service, by keeping the People in continual Jealousies of his Plots, upon their most Valuable Interests.</P>
<P>What the disposition of the People towards him is, you may guess by this: There was lately prepared an Address from hence, to the <HI>Queen,</HI> upon many important Articles; but by certain Arts there was got into it a Clause, to desire of the <HI>Queen,</HI> that this Govern∣our might be continued, the Representatives Voted all the rest of the Address, but this Clause they absolutely Rejected; they could not get above Five or Six Votes for it, so the whole Address, (which was contrived by a Party for nothing but that Clause) fell to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001331_0013_0FB27CBC9C8DC8B0"/>There happened lately a number of Persons, namely, <HI>Boreland Vetch, Rouse, Lawson, Philips</HI> and <HI>Cauplin</HI> to be taken manag∣ing an unlawful Trade with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> the Commodi∣ties wherein they Traded, were such, that the late Act of Parliament made their Crime to be <HI>High-Treason,</HI> and we had no <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Province</HI> relating to that Matter, but was defectively Expressed: Our merciful Assembly was mighty loathe to proceed unto so severe a Judgment as that of Death, upon these Offenders. The Offenders Pe∣titioning for it, the General Assembly were (very much by the Go∣vernours influence) drawn into it, to take the Tryal of them into their own Hands; and as only Guilty of an High Misdemeanour, the Vote for it was obtained in a Thin House, upon an hurry at breaking up; and some Clauses in the Charter were so Construed, as to Counte∣nance it. Ʋpon their coming together again, they would fain have revoked their Votes, as fearing, that the very Persons who had been their Tempters into it, would turn their Accusers, and improve it by way of Complaint, for the Enemies of our Charter to work upon; but the Governour would by no means permit the Revocation of that wrong Step, (if it were one) so the Tryal proceeded, and the Offenders were Fined in several Sums, by an <HI>Act</HI> of the Governour and Assembly.</P>
<P>It is now said, that the ingrateful Men who were saved from the Gallows, by the Tenderness of the Government, are now cutting our Throats, and Petition home against the Government, for Fining them instead of Hanging them; yea, it is also said, that the very Person who was the chief Cause of drawing the Assembly into this ex∣traordinary Proceeding, intends to make an ill use of it, against the Country; if you are sensible of any thing of this nature carrying on, we pray you to add unto the rest of your Offices, that of an In∣tercession, that an harmless People, surpriz'd into any Error, may not be Punished any otherwise, than by the removal of such as have been the Causes of it; and so much for that.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001331_0014_0FB27CC244827EC8"/><HI>Sir,</HI> You would do a vast Service to the Crown, if you would set forward the designs of reducing <HI>Canada,</HI> and possessing <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> a much less Fleet than what annually goes into the <HI>Indies,</HI> coming early enough in the Spring, may easily do the former, even in the way thither; and a <HI>Scotch Colony</HI> might be of good Consequence to do the latter; but if any assistance from <HI>New-England</HI> should be ex∣pected in this matter, it is of absolute necessity that the Country have a Governour whom the People may somewhat Rely upon.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> You are Born to do the <HI>Queen</HI> and the Nation Service; you are spirited for great undertakings; you are highly beloved and estee∣med among our People in this Land, and where-ever you have come, 'tis wished that you may do some considerable Action in this Affair.</P>
<P>I have been earnestly Sollicited to Address one of the most Illustrious Patriots of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, my Lord High Treasurer, with some of these Intimations: That Noble Person is known to be such a Patron to all good Men, and such a defence of Oppressed Innocence and Liberties, that we all fly to him as our unquestionable Refuge. I am well satisfied there would need nothing (to speak Humanely) to make this Country Easy and Happy, but for that excellent <HI>Person</HI> to have an exact Representation of our Circumstances; nothing hinders me from attempting it, but the hazard of doing what may be thought a presumption in one so much a stranger to him, nevertheless, I am desired by some considerable <HI>Persons</HI> to move you, that you would wait upon his Lordship, and fully acquaint him with the Matters now laid before you,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>May the Almighty prosper you; I am, Sir, Your Obliged Servant,</HI> &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I may inform you of one Action lately done among us, which I know you will be pleased withal. Upon the advice of
<PB N="10" REF="001331_0015_0FB27CC7DF68A640"/>
the extream Distress whereto the <HI>French</HI> Invasion had brought St. <HI>Christophers</HI> and <HI>Nevis,</HI> the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> in a most Christian manner expressed their Charity towards those, who perhaps would have hardly done the like for them, on a like Occasion. We made a Collection for the Relief of their Necessities, the Collection was, as I am told, between 7 and 800 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in this Collection, there were two Churches in <HI>Boston,</HI> the <HI>South</HI> and the <HI>North,</HI> one gave somewhat above a 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> the other gave a little under it. Certainly, a Country so rea∣dy to serve Her Majesty, and to help their fellow Subjects, ought to have a room in the Thoughts of all good Men in the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>The foregoing Letter carrying with it so many undeniable Truths, the World must of consequence concede with the gene∣ral Exclamations of the now Distressed <HI>New-Englanders.</HI> Indeed the Publick had not been allarm'd with these Distant Calamities, had the inexorable Authors of them adhered to reitterated Grie∣vances, from those who too severely suffer'd under their Pro∣tection. The Author of this Letter, who is a Person of a Cha∣racter beyond the reach of Envy, and one who is a great Blessing to his Native Country, had not invoked the Protection and As∣sistance of others, without a due sense of the Danger his innocent Neighbours and Country-men were expos'd to. To Report all the Letters of Complaint from these Provinces, would be too Voluminous and tiresome to the Reader; we will only mention one more, which, tho' short and plain, carries nothing but Ve∣racity with it.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL the People here are Bought and Sold, betwixt the Gover∣nour and his Son <HI>Paul;</HI> they are so Mercenary, there is no Justice to be had without Money: There is not one Publick Place in the Government that is worth Money, but what the Governour or <HI>Paul</HI> goes Halves with: In short, the whole Country is very uneasy, and the People here are so universally set against him, that Her Majesty can scarce give a greater In∣stance of Her tender Care and Regard to them, than by a re∣moval
<PB N="11" REF="001331_0016_0FB27CCA0BECEEC8"/>
of him, which, to my certain knowledge, would be soon followed by a Sincere and Hearty Acknowledgment of Her Majesty's Singular Favour to them, in that Particular.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. A</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In the foregoing Letters we find several things Worthy our Remark; but I shall only mention the Three following:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>That without Money, there is no Justice to be had in</HI> New-England; So that the meaner sort, doubtless, is in a Deplorable Condition; the faces of their Poor being ground to Dust; their Widows Houses laid Waste, and the hopes of their Offspring cut off. From whence we may infer, that <HI>New-England</HI> having a Go∣vernour, whose God is the Mammon of this World; whose Prin∣ciples act Counter to the Design of his Power; and whose Drift is the Ruin of his own Country; the Inhabitants thereof have nothing but Justice on their part to Petition Her Majesty to throw him aside.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>A general uneasiness under, and opposition to this Governour, thro' the whole Country.</HI> And this, methinks, might stop the Mouths of some People here, (who, not knowing the Nature of this affair, no otherwise than as their Interest leads them to side with the Governour, or by Virtue of a bare Friendship Contracted with him whilst he Resided in <HI>England</HI>) and put a Period to all their Objections in his Behalf; especially One, unhappily let slip from the Mouth of a Gentleman too well known for his great Lear∣ning and Parts, to be thought so over-sighted, and that is to this Effect. <HI>If a Governour must be removed for every trivial Complaint, there wou'd be no End of such Removals; and Her Majesty's Ministry would be wholly taken up with turning out, and putting in.</HI> I will not pretend to affirm the Reason that produc'd this hasty Plea for our Criminal Governour; but sure I am, the Author of it knows too much Law, than to extenuate the like Crimes in others. And a weak Argument I take it to indeavour the influencing our Su∣periors in Redressing Grievances of the Subject, when the several matters of Fact Sworn to, are laid down before them: But,
<PB N="12" REF="001331_0017_0FB27CCCD7F0AD68"/>
to say no more, this Gentleman has not been the first that has over-shot himself in Defending things of this Nature. And,</P>
<P N="3">(3dly,) <HI>A fervent Desire to be eas'd of Oppression, i: e.</HI> That they might be capable of acknowledging with Respect and Gratitude, the mighty advantages of such a Deliverance to the <HI>Queen</HI> of Great Brittain; to a <HI>Queen</HI> who is all Justice and Piety, Peace and Union; and a Queen who will not only hear the Petitions of her Subjects, but maintain them in their Rights and Priviledges. Let not <HI>New-England</HI> doubt then of finding Redress, from so Great and Gra∣cious a Mistress, notwithstanding the subtle Designs and Evasions of Evil-minded Men. And so we come to present the Reader with a further Account of the said Mismanagements, by another Hand.</P>
<P>SOmetime in the Spring of the Year, 1706. Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> the pre∣sent Governour of the Province of <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> writ a Letter from <HI>Boston,</HI> Directed to Mr. <HI>Richard Waldron,</HI> and my self, to use our Interest to prevail with the Coun∣cil at an Assembly, to Draw up an Address to the <HI>Queen,</HI> That Her Majesty would please to continue the said <HI>Dudley</HI> in the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire:</HI> Whereupon the said <HI>Wal∣dron</HI> (after he had Communicated the Letter to me) drew up an Address, and shew'd it to the Assembly, and prevailed with them to pass it in Both Houses, with little Alteration. And this is the Address that is now come over from the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> The Assembly was much against it, but we thought it would be best for us to do any thing that would please the Governour at that time; considering, that we were always in danger of the Enemy, and concluded, it was much in his Power, under God, to preserve us, having often heard him say, that he would stop the Courier of the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> (when he pleas'd) in a Month or Six Weeks time; and I did then, and do still be∣lieve, that he could prevent the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> from coming upon us, and Killing us as they did; for I know that he had Correspondence with a <HI>Fryer</HI> or <HI>Jesuit,</HI> or one so called, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> that Lives among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and hath great influence over them, who Writes himself <HI>Galen Emesary.</HI> The Governour, to my certain Knowledge, did order sundry things that were sent him;

and, considering the great Correspondence (he told me) he had with the Governour of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> it caused a firm belief in me, that he could do what he would with the Enemy: These, with other Motives, press'd us forwards to get the Address passed, concluding all these things would add to our Peace, if rightly improved; and the <HI>Indians,</HI> about that time, and for many Months before, had done little or no Mischief, and for my part, I did really be∣lieve, that it was the Governour's Interest that caused our quiet, but soon found we were Mistaken, finding out, that much about the same time that <HI>Waldren</HI> and my self were forwarding the Ad∣dress to Her Majesty, to continue Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> Governour, he was countenancing a private Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> our Enemies, as we found by woful Experience: For soon after those Traders went to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> came sharply down upon us about the latter end of <HI>June</HI> last, Killed Six People, Wounded two, and carried away two from the Town of <HI>Almsbury,</HI> and a little before they Killed Lieutenant <HI>John Shapleigh,</HI> at the Town of <HI>Kittery,</HI> and a whole Family, as a Man, Wife and Children, all Killed and Scalped out of the Township of <HI>Dover;</HI> and one Man Killed with Swan-shot out of the Township of <HI>Hampton;</HI> and Nine Killed, one Wounded, and one carried out of the Township of <HI>Exeter.</HI> All these Barbarities were committed before I came from thence, which was about the beginning of <HI>September</HI> last; God knows how many have been thus Barbarously Murther'd since. Captain <HI>Vetch,</HI> and Captain <HI>Lawson,</HI> oftentimes told me, that they had oftentimes acquainted the Governour with their de∣sign of going to the <HI>Eastward</HI> upon Trade, and had the consent of him, and did solemnly protest they would not have gone without it: And I do believe, and it is generally believed in <HI>New-England,</HI> that the Governour did know of this Trade, and no doubt but he was to have a share of the Profit. When these Tra∣ders came from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> one of their Vessels stop∣ped at the Isle of <HI>Shoals,</HI> near the Province of New <HI>Hampshire,</HI> the Master's Name was <HI>Rouse,</HI> who brought to that place from <HI>Port Royal</HI> Seven Prisoners; and Capt. <HI>Jethro Furbur</HI> being at the said Isles of <HI>Shoales,</HI> at the said time when the <HI>Vessel</HI> came in, heard the said Pri∣soners affirm, That the <HI>Eastern</HI> Indians had no Shot, nor Bullets, nor Lead to make any, and it was very scarce with the <HI>French,</HI> in∣somuch that they could not supply them, so that the <HI>Indians</HI> were
<PB N="16" REF="001331_0019_0FB27CD1FA3B5558"/>
like to Starve for want of Ammunition; for great part of their Livelihood depends on their Guns to Kill wild Beasts and Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby we find it was not the Governour's Interest he had with the Enemy, to prevent their coming upon us, but it was for want of Ammunition: And those Prisoners that were brought from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> which Capt. <HI>Furber</HI> spoke with at the Isles of <HI>Shoals,</HI> did fur∣ther affirm, That they heard the Governour of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> say, That he had given his Letter to the Governour of <HI>Boston,</HI> that he would not supply the Indians with Powder nor Shot, but that he would do all he could to prevent the <HI>Indians</HI> coming upon the <HI>English,</HI> and had been as good as his Word; but that the said Governour of <HI>Boston,</HI> or his People, had supplied the <HI>Indians</HI> with more Ammunition than he was able to do; for the Traders from <HI>Boston</HI> brought it by Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and that if this Trade had not been incouraged by the Governour, we should have had no Men Killed, nor indeed any Disturbance amongst us. It is my Belief, and it seems very plain to me, that the Governour intends to forward the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy to De∣stroy all they can, and keep the Country allarm'd, thereby to put them to such vast Charges, as will Ruin the whole Government, by Killing some and Impoverishing the rest. There was never such Taxes on the Poor People as now; 33000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> being raised a little be∣fore I came away, and many great Sums not long before that. I was credibly Informed that some Persons were forced to cut open their Beds, and Sell the Feathers to Pay their Taxes. I do'nt remember that ever there was any of the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy Kill'd or Taken since Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> came over Governour, except an Old Woman, and two others I took to be Girls by their Scalps; and some few taken near <HI>Port Royal</HI> taken by Major <HI>Church.</HI> So that instead of being De∣stroyed, I wish they be not preserv'd: For, Six Months before it came to pass, the Governour Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> told me, what Methods the <HI>Indians</HI> would take when they came again, and it proved accordingly. He told me, That the <HI>Indians</HI> would not come in any great Body as they used to do, but they would come in small Numbers, no Number above Thirty, and so Line the Woods from <HI>Dearfield,</HI> which is the South-West side of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Government, and all along the Woods, just without the Towns to <HI>Casko</HI> Bay, which is the North-East Part of Inhabitants at this time. And this Method I am afraid will be continued till the Country is for a great part Destroyed, if Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> be continued Governour. As for the Address he ob∣tained
<PB N="15" REF="001331_0020_0FB27CD646052B10"/>
of the Militia of <HI>Massachuset</HI>'s Bay, it was a forc'd thing; for the Officers are beholden to him for their Commissions, and if any Refus'd to Sign what the Governour got drawn, he could put them out, and put in others as he pleased.</P>
<P>Thus having given the Publick an Exact Relation of the present State of <HI>New-England,</HI> it remains only that we Produce a Confir∣mation of all that hath been said. To which end we will begin with the several Affidavits and Depositions already made, and which are as follows.</P>

<P><HI>JOhn Calley</HI> of <HI>Marble-head,</HI> in the County of <HI>Essex</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> now in <HI>London</HI> Mariner, Deposeth and saith, That he doth and hath good reason to Believe, That Her Majesties Colonies of <HI>New Eng∣land,</HI> are in great Danger of being Ruined by reason of Governour <HI>Dud∣leys▪</HI> Countenancing a Trade, and Correspondence with the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>In∣dian</HI> Enemies, and many other his Irregular practices: Also saith, that the said Governour did in the Year, <HI>1705.</HI> send his Son <HI>William Dud∣ley,</HI> with Captain <HI>Samuel Vetch</HI> to <HI>Canada</HI> under a Pretence of Redeem∣ing Captives; who accordingly went and brought back only a few of the meanest of the English Captives; Leaving the chiefest of them there for an Occasion of their returning again to <HI>Canada</HI> to Trade, and settle a Correspondence with the <HI>French;</HI> and that the said <HI>Vetch</HI> did carry out with him a Cargo of about <HI>800 lib.</HI> Value in Iron, Pitch, Rigging, Shot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which Cargo upon a Moderate Computation, might Produce near <HI>3000 lib.</HI> And that the said <HI>Vetch</HI> did also pretend that he went with Governour <HI>Dudley's</HI> Approbation to get in a Debt, of <HI>800. lib.</HI> Contrac∣ted in time of Peace; And due to him from the <HI>French,</HI> of which matters and things he this Deponent, hath been credibly informed▪ and Believes them to be true. And further saith that it did appear to the General As∣sembly
<PB N="17" REF="001331_0022_0FB27CD903547290"/>
of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony in <HI>New-England,</HI> that Captain <HI>William Rouse</HI> was (the better to colour a Trade with the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>) sent to <HI>Port Royal</HI> with a Flag of Truce, under Pretence of setling a Correspondence with the <HI>French</HI> Governour there for exchanging Prisoners; and did Trade not only with his own Vessel, but had also as the same Time two other Trading Vessels with him, under his own Direction, and did bring back Furrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To above <HI>2000 lib.</HI> Value; and that the said <HI>Dudley</HI> did allow one <HI>Dishey Foe,</HI> a French Prisoner on his Parole, to go in the same Vessel with the said <HI>Rouse,</HI> who acted as Interpreter between the said <HI>Rouse</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> in Trading with them; and that the said Flag of Truce meeting with one of the two other Vessels, the said <HI>Foe</HI> was put into the same with several Goods, and Merchandises, out of the said Flag of Truce, with which the said <HI>Foe</HI> was Trading; and that the said <HI>Foe</HI> returned again to <HI>Boston,</HI> and that when the said Furrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were brought to <HI>Boston,</HI> it was alledged, that they were brought to Pay <HI>French</HI> Mens Debts in <HI>New-England,</HI> but that it was Proved that the said Furrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were mostly purchased by the Goods carried out in the Vessel of the said <HI>Rouse</HI> and were Seized, yet cleared afterwards; And the said <HI>Rouse</HI> declared to the said Assembly, that he had done nothing but by Governour <HI>Dudleys</HI> approbation; and that it appeared to the said General Assembly, that the Enemies distress through want of Ammunition, Provision, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before they were by the English supplied, occasioned many of them to go out a Privateering on the English Coast, some of which were taken and brought into <HI>Boston,</HI> and were afterwards with other <HI>French</HI> Discharged and sent to <HI>Canada,</HI> and <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and among others one <HI>Battis</HI> a Prisoner kept for Murders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by him committed upon the English in cold Blood, and under a Flag of Truce, and he being a Man of great note and Service among the French and usually joyned with the <HI>Indians,</HI> whilst the English Prisoners were still detained, because Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> had as was alledged, falsified his Promise to the French Governour, who had restrained the <HI>Indians</HI> from Disturbing the English Fishery or otherwise; and would not allow them any Amunition for a con∣siderable time, nor until they were supplied by the English Vessels sent un∣der the pretence of Fetching Prisoners, about which Letters were produced from the French Governour. And this Deponent further saith, that it ap∣peared to the said General Assembly, that the endeavours of the Country, by a chargeable maintaining an Army, and sending them yearly several hundred Miles to destroy the <HI>Indians</HI> Corn, thereby to distress and subdue them, have (by their being supplied in their great Necessities, by such
<PB N="18" REF="001331_0023_0FB27CDE8DAD4820"/>
Traders, for great Prices) been in a great measure frustrated, and that if the said <HI>Indians</HI> had not been so supplied many of them must have peri∣shed thro' want; and that Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> generally shewed an unwil∣lingness that such Traders when taken, should be punished, or Fined; and further saith, that the above said Colony, was at a great Expence to Erect a Fort at <HI>Cascobay,</HI> and to maintain Souldiers for Securing the same to suppress the Enemy, and keep sure Footing in that Part of the Country, yet that Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> suffered those Souldiers to remain there with∣out any Commission Officer, to the great dissatisfaction and dread of the said Souldiers, insomuch that they declared to this Deponent, a Member of the said Assembly, that if the Enemy should come upon them they would Surrender the said Fort, and dared not Resist for want of a Commission; and that he, this Deponent coming into the Assembly then Sitting at <HI>Bos∣ton;</HI> and Informing them thereof, the said Assembly Represented to the Governour, the necessity of speedily Comissionating some person to command that Fort, which after some considerable time was obtained: And this Deponent further saith, that the said Colony, hath by reason of such Illegal Trade been put to vast Expences to secure themselves from the Invasions, of the Enemy; and that in one Sessions the last Summer was raised by the said Assembly, about <HI>33000 lib.</HI> When as otherwise one third part thereof might have been sufficient. And further saith, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> that have been thus Supplyed are the only People, that destroy the Eastern parts of the Countrey; the Fishery and Coast of <HI>Accady,</HI> and are, as this Deponent hath been credibly Informed, and doth believe the very same <HI>Indians</HI> that were at the destroying of <HI>New-Found Land,</HI> and headed by one <HI>Escombuet,</HI> that usually heads the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they come to de∣stroy the <HI>New-Englanders.</HI> And this Deponent further saith, that he hath been credibly Informed and hath good reason to believe; that Go∣vernour <HI>Dudley</HI> doth several ways Illegally exact from Her Majesties Subjects several Sums of Money, and Deprives them of their Priviledges in catching of Whales by force, taking Whales from the Fishers under Pretence of Drift-fish; and obstructs the course of Justice; and Particularly that one <HI>Clap</HI> took by force a Whale from one <HI>Newcomb,</HI> upon which the said <HI>Newcomb</HI> sued <HI>Clap,</HI> and obtained Judgment against him, and for which he was cast into Prison, and then was cleared by Go∣vernour <HI>Dudley,</HI> without any satisfaction made to said <HI>Newcomb.</HI> And this Deponent further saith, that he is informed that an Address hath been sent to Her Majesty, Representing, as if the People of <HI>New England</HI> Prayed for the continuing the said <HI>Dudley,</HI> their Governour; but that
<PB N="19" REF="001331_0024_0FB27CDFC49CE498"/>
he doth in part know, and hath been informed, and hath great grounds to believe, that the far greatest part of Her Majesties Subjects in <HI>New-England</HI> are very weary under his administration, and that the said Go∣vernour <HI>Dudley</HI> did cause to be Prepared an address to Her Majesty, for his Continuance, and the same to be sent up and down the Country, to get hands thereunto, and that the same was only Signed by such persons as were in Commission under him, or influenced by him. And that he this Deponent doth know that an Address was presented to the House of Representatives, to be Sign'd, Praying for several Favours from Her Majesty, but because in the said Address a prayer for his Continuing Governour was inserted, the whole Address was by the said House Rejected: And that he doth believe, that if an Address to Remove him hath not been presented, it was because they had an Expectation that Her Majesty, would suddenly favour that Countrey with a better Governour: And further saith, that whilst the Assembly was Sitting there arrived a Flag of Truce from the <HI>French</HI> Governour, with a haughty Demand of the <HI>French</HI> Prisoners, in <HI>New-England,</HI> and charging Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> with Breach of his Promise, and his permitting <HI>English</HI> Trading Vessels on their Coasts; whereupon the House of Representatives Suspecting the Flag of Truce to come upon account of Trade, Ordered the Vessel to be searched, and that there was found on Board the same New Arms and Ammunition, hid in private places, particularly shot among Peas, yet denied by the Commander thereof, who was an <HI>English</HI> Renegado; part of which being brought before the said House, it was Generally concluded, that they had been newly bought in <HI>Boston;</HI> but the Governour Interposing, the matter was hushed up to the great dissatisfaction of the General Assembly, and Country in General; and altho' the Assembly moved the Governour for a strict Guard to be kept on the Vessel or Flag of Truce, nothing was done. This De∣ponent further saith, that the House of Representatives, Insisted not only upon far greater Fines to be laid on the foresaid Traders, and others Concerned: but also that they should stand upon the Gallows, and suffer Twelve Months Imprisonment, and continued insisting upon the same about Three Weeks, but Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> not consenting thereto, by his Wearying out the said House, and persuading them to Moderate
<PB N="20" REF="001331_0025_0FB27CE5A2F0E688"/>
their Sentence; to the great dissatisfaction of the Council, and the said House; at last the House altered their Sentence; to the Fines they now Stand Charged with.</P>

And this Deponent Paid Ten or Twelve Pounds in Part of what was behind, that the said Officer might not be turned out of his Place, which Sum the said <HI>Atkinson</HI> afterwards repay'd to this Deponent; And that a year or two afterwards the said <HI>Paul Dudley</HI> told this Deponent, that the Governour should turn the said <HI>Atkin∣son</HI> out his of Place, for that he had not Pay'd him all that was agre∣ed for, whereupon this Deponent acquainted the said <HI>Atkinson</HI> there∣with, who reply'd that there was not above Five or Six Pounds be∣hind, and he would Pay it the next Post: And that sometime in the Month of <HI>August</HI> last, as this Deponent was coming away, to his best remembrance, the said <HI>Atkinson</HI> told him he had Paid

Twenty Pounds a year, for both his Offices: And this Deponent further saith, that having occasion to run the Bounds of a Piece of Land he had Bought in <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> he Wrote to the said Mr. <HI>Paul Dudley</HI> to Procure the Governours Order to the Sheriff, to accompany the Persons Appointed to run the Line or Bounds be∣tween this Deponent, and the Adjacent Freeholder, for fear of any Disturbance, and he would be at the Charge thereof; but sent no Money, and the said <HI>Paul Dudley</HI> sent this Deponent word that it could not be done, or to that Purpose: And the next Post this Deponent ordered his Friend in <HI>Boston</HI> to Pay the said <HI>Paul Dudley</HI> Ten Pounds, and thereupon an Order came to this Deponent by the next Post; and the Business was afterwards done in three or four Hours time, and the Charge to the Officers and Sheriff was not above the Sum of Twelve Shillings: And this Deponent further saith, that upon the Fifth Day of <HI>August</HI> last, some of the Men be∣longing to Her Majesties Ship the Deptford, then Riding in the River of <HI>Piscataqua;</HI> came on shore at the Town of <HI>New-castle</HI> a∣foresaid, and took from thence by the Captains Order as they said one <HI>Jethro Furbur</HI> Master of the Ship called the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Richard,</HI> and forthwith set Sail and Carried him to <HI>Boston,</HI> in another Pro∣vince; where Captain <HI>Stuckley</HI> Commander of the Deptford, and Captain <HI>Mathews</HI> Commander of the Dover, entred a Complaint against the said <HI>Furbur,</HI> in the Court of Admiralty at <HI>Boston,</HI> for Shipping two of their Men: whereupon this Deponent wrote to Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> the Governour, how that Captain <HI>Stuckley</HI> had Carried away the Master of his Ship, Loaded with dry Fish, bound to <HI>Leghorn;</HI> having cleared the Custom-House and obtained the Governours Pass to the Fort, and earnestly desired Relief: And Inclosed to the Governour a Protest against the said <HI>Stuckley,</HI> but sent no Money either to the Governour, or his Son; neither could he obtain any Relief; whereupon this Deponent took Horse and went to <HI>Boston</HI> and applyed himself to the Governour, acquain∣ting him, that the Fish on Board his Ship was a Perishing Co∣modity; and if any Water should come into the Ship the Cargo would be utterly lost; for assoon as Captain <HI>Stuckley</HI> carried a∣way his Master, the rest of the Men run away from the said Ship, into the Woods; And this Deponent was informed the said Ship swung too and again, in the Tyde, and was like to Sink, and could not get a Man on Board her: And this

<P><HI>William Partridge</HI> of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> maketh Oath, that he doth believe that <HI>Joseph Dudley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> present Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> did Countenance a Trade with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies, and saith, that he the said <HI>Dudley</HI> did keep Correspondence with one <HI>Gallen Emissary,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Fryar or Jesuit, that Lives among the <HI>Indians;</HI> and the said <HI>Dudley</HI> owned to this Deponent, that he had a great Correspondence with the Governour of <HI>Port-Royal:</HI> And this Deponent saith, that Captain <HI>Vetch,</HI> and Captain <HI>Lawson</HI> often told this Deponent, that they had acquainted the said <HI>Dudley</HI> with their Voyage to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> when they Traded with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and that he Consented thereto; and that soon after they had so Traded, the <HI>Indians</HI> came down and Killed Lieutenant <HI>John Shapeley</HI> at the Town of <HI>Kittery;</HI> and a Man, his Wife and Children in the Township of <HI>Dover;</HI> and Killed one Man with Swan-shot out of the Town∣ship of <HI>Hampton;</HI> and Killed Nine; and Wounded one out of the Township of <HI>Exeter;</HI> and about the latter end of <HI>June</HI> last Killed Six, and Wounded Two; and carried away Two out of the Township of <HI>Almesbury;</HI> all which Persons were Killed and taken in this Deponent's Neighbourhood, as this Deponent hath heard, and verily believes, being informed so by those that were at most of their Funerals. And this Deponent further saith, that there was not to his Knowledge, any of the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies Killed since the said <HI>Dudley</HI> was Governour, except an Old Wo∣man and two others, that seemed by their Scalps to be Girls. And this Deponent further saith, that the said <HI>Dudley</HI> told this De∣ponent Six Months before the Invasion by the <HI>Indians,</HI> that when they came again they would not come in any great Body, as they used to do, but not above Thirty in a Company, and so Line the Woods from <HI>Dearfeild</HI> to <HI>Casko-Bay,</HI> which is above a Hundred Miles, which Method the said <HI>Indians</HI> did after take in their said Invasion: but how the said <HI>Dudley</HI> came to know that they would so do, this Deponent knoweth not; but saith, that the said <HI>Dud∣ley</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001331_0031_0FB27CF8AA1D0568"/>
often told this Deponent, that he could stop the Career of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> when he pleased, in a Month or Six Weeks time.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Thomas Newton</HI>'s Affidavit.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THomas Newton</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> at present in <HI>London,</HI> Gent. maketh-Oath, that he hath Lived in <HI>New England</HI> for near Sixteen Years last past, and during that time has been well acquainted with Collonel <HI>Joseph Dudley,</HI> the present Governour of the Province of <HI>Masachusets-Bay</HI> and New-<HI>Hampshire:</HI> And that since the said Collonel <HI>Dudley</HI> was Governour there, this Deponent was credibly Informed, that several Persons having purchased Lands at <HI>Nashobah</HI> and <HI>Nipmuck,</HI> within his Government, and wanting a Confirmation of their Titles, by an Act of the General Court, (as is usual in such Cases) they could not obtain the Governour's assent thereto, without giving him Money, and part of their Lands. And this Deponent further saith, that he be∣ing Deputed by <HI>William Atwood</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to be Deputy Judge of the Court of Vice Admiralty, as well as of the Collony of <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> as for the Provinces of <HI>Masachusets Bay,</HI> and New <HI>Hampshire,</HI> was prohibited by the said Governour from going to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> and Condemning some Prizes brought in there, unless this Deponent would procure the Governour One Hundred Founds, and that his Son should go Advocate thither; and threatned this Deponent to raise the <HI>Posse Comitatus</HI> upon him, if he offered to proceed without

And this Deponent also further saith, That one Mr. <HI>Stephen Minot,</HI> having Built a very Convenient House for a Publick Inn or Tavern, upon a place called the Neck, the Governour having a Tennant who kept a Publick House near to it, Prohibited the Justice to grant a License to the said <HI>Minot,</HI> tho' it was Requested by the General Assem∣bly; but the said <HI>Minot</HI> could not obtain a License for his House, until he complied with the Governour upon hard Terms. And this Deponent moreover saith, that Sentence in the Court of Vice-Admiralty being given by this Deponent for a Saylor, against a Master of a Vessel for Wages, from which the said Master appealed to the High Court of Admiralty in <HI>England,</HI> but not giving Bond to Prosecute as is usual in such Cases, Process was granted against the said Master, and the Mareschal took him into Custody thereupon, yet the Governour abused the Officer, and discharged the said Master contrary to Law, and by that means the Saylor left his Wages, and his Charges and Costs: And lastly, this Depo∣nent saith, that the People in <HI>New-England</HI> in general, are much dissatisfied with the said Colonel <HI>Dudley,</HI> and would rejoyce to have him removed from his Government; and further saith not.</P>

<HEAD>Colonel <HI>Partridge's</HI> Certificate.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas an <HI>Address</HI> from Her Majesties <HI>Assembly,</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> has been lately sent over, Praying her Majesty's Continuance of Colonel <HI>Dudley</HI> Governour of the said Province; Now the Truth and Occasion of Procuring and sending the same, was thus:</P>
<P><Q>Coll. <HI>Dudley,</HI> who is not only Governour of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> but also of the <HI>Massa∣thusets-Bay,</HI> and lives at <HI>Boston, 60</HI> Miles from <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> Wrote to some Prin∣cipal Gentlemen, to Prevail with the Assem∣bly of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> to Present an Ad∣dress to her Majesty for the Purpose afore∣said, and in Compliance with this Desire, and in Order to Prevail with the Assembly, the said Gentlemen Prepar'd an <HI>Address</HI> accord∣ingly, and show'd it to the <HI>Assembly,</HI> who, in some time after, though with great Difficulty and Reluctancy, were prevailed on to Sign the same, with little Alteration. The Chief,
<PB N="29" REF="001331_0034_0FB27D02D99E5980"/>
and indeed the Only Inducement to which, was the Apprehension they were then under, that it was better for them to do any thing that would Please the Governour; and that it was in his Power to Contribute much to the Advantage and Security, or to the Mischief and Prejudice of that Province; and not any Opinion they had of the Conduct and Integrity of the said <HI>Dudley,</HI> who is generally Disliked and Ill-Thought of in both <HI>Provinces,</HI> where he is Governour; and has given too much Reason and Occasion to Suspect his Regard to the Good and Wel∣fare of those Places, especially when his own In∣terest stands in Competition, or a fair Opportunity offers, for his Profit and Advantage.</Q></P>

<P>Thus far the Affidavits of the Illegal and Disloyal Practices of our Governour. Can any Man that loves not a <HI>French</HI> Interest, call those Trivial; or say, they are not worthy of the severest Resent∣ments? With what Face Men now a-days can go about to Ju∣stify Crimes that have so near an affinity to High Treason, is a wonder to me; and yet pretend at the same time to be Loyal and True to their Country. Crimes of the most pernicious Consequence to a State; and which, among all Nations, have been Punish'd with the utmost Severity. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> notwithstanding the Liberty they gave to some of their Rulers, yet they appointed a Reckoning Day among them; so that those that thought themselves not accountable whilst in Authority, found at last a very strict Account to be given to certain Auditors, and a worser Punish∣ment inflicted on them if Criminal, than the abused Clemency of this Age can produce: To do Justice and Right is the most in∣valuable Jewel in <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> and a Blessing which no People in the World can boast of, like those of the <HI>Brittish</HI> Nation. The <HI>New-Englanders</HI> are of the same Tribe; have the same Liberty to, and the same Property in the Enjoyment of the many Legal Priviledges in that Charter contained: They are <HI>not Slaves,</HI> as their conceited Governour once told them; but have still a right Le∣gally to oppose his Pride and Covetousness; have still a Right to Petition for a Better, that will not be Brib'd to do Evil; they have a Right to tell the World, and that loudly, That for a Gover∣nour to furnish the Enemy with Powder and Shot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to destroy his own Country-men, is a Wretch not only fit to be Discarded, but to be for ever forgotten among Mankind.</P>
<P>The Cryes sent up to Heaven, by the many poor Souls lately most inhumanely Butchered by the Merciless <HI>Indians,</HI> with our own Instruments, have reached the Ears of the Almighty, and will certainly draw down Redress from him, who is not only <HI>Rex Magnus &amp; Rex Solus,</HI> but <HI>Judex Supremus,</HI> who hath <HI>Im∣perium fine fine,</HI> as well as <HI>fine Limite,</HI> to whom we commit all that hath been already said.</P>
<P>And now to Conclude all, (that our Readers may have a just Sense of the unaccountable Cruelties acted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> upon our <HI>English</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) we shall present them with the following Particulars, lately sent over to us by a very great and good Man.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of several Barbarities lately committed by the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> Intermix'd with some Memorable Providences.</HEAD>
<P>AStonishing Deliverances have been sent from Heaven, to many of our Captives. They have been many a time upon the Point of Destruction; but, <HI>These poor ones have Cryed unto the Lord,</HI> and He has Remarkably delivered them.</P>
<P>'Tis a Wonderful Restraint from God upon the Bruitish Sal∣vages, that no <HI>English Woman</HI> was ever known to have any Violence offered unto her <HI>Chastity,</HI> by any of them.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful, that no more of the Captives have been Murde∣red by them, neither when they were Drunk, nor when the Capri∣chio's, and the Cruelties of their Diabolical Natures were to be Gratified.</P>
<P>'Tis Wonderful, that when many of the Captives have been just going to be Sacrificed, some strange Interposition of the Divine Providence has put a stop to the Execution, and prevent∣ed their being made a Sacrifice. The Stories are numberless. Take a few of them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="001331_0037_0FB27D0A13AEC1E0"/>A C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of Indians had been three Days without any manner of Sustenance. They took an English Child, and hung it before the Fire to Roast it for their Supper; but that these Canibals might Satiate their— I want a Name for it,—as well as their Hun∣ger, they would Roast it Alive. The Child began to Swell. A Cannow arrived at that Instant, with a Dog in it. The lesser Devils of the Crue, proposed their taking the Dog instead of the Child; they did so, and the Child is yet Living! Her Name is <HI>Hannah Parsons.</HI></P>
<P>A Man had Valiantly Killed an Indian or two before the Sal∣vages took him. He was next Morning to undergo in horrible Death, whereof the Manner and the Torture was to be assigned by the Widow <HI>Squa</HI> of the Dead Indian. The French Priests told him, they had indeavoured to divert the Tygres from their bloody Intention, but could not prevail with them; he must prepare for the terrible Execution, His cries to God were hard, and heard; when the Sentence of the <HI>Squa</HI> was demanded, quite contrary to every ones Expectation, and the Revengeful Inclination so usual and well-known among these Creatures, she only said, <HI>His Death won't fetch my Husband to Life; Do nothing to him!</HI> So nothing was done to him.</P>
<P>A Woman was carried aside, by her Monster of a Master; he fastned a Rope about her Neck; it was in vain for her to con∣tend, the Hatchet must presently have dispatched her, if the Halter had failed; she had no Remedy but to Cry unto God: Her Ma∣ster throws up the end of the Rope over a Limb of a Tree; he as∣cends to hale her and tye her up; and then a fine Exploit for the Wretch! a <HI>memorable Name!</HI> However the Limb happily breaks down he falls; full of madness he goes to repeat his brave action: An Indian Commander just in the Nick of Time comes in upon him; Reproaches him very bitterly; Takes her away from him; and sends her to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>But we ought not to pass over the marvellous Display of the Power of God, in supporting and preserving the poor Captives when they Travelled thro' the horrid Wilderness, oftentimes much more than a score of Miles in a day, and thro' very deep Snows;
<PB N="33" REF="001331_0038_0FB27D0B52AFDBF8"/>
and with vast Loads on their Backs, and grievously pinched with Hunger, having scarce one bit of any Refreshment, for whole days together. Poor, Weak, sick Women have done so!</P>
<P>One cannot well imagine any other than Supernatural and Angelical assistances, in some of the instances.</P>
<P>The Indians came upon the House of one <HI>Adams</HI> at <HI>Wells,</HI> and Captivated the Man and his Wife, and assassinated the Children; whereof one, who had an Hatchet struck into his Skull, and was left for dead, was strangely recovered. The Woman had Lain in about Eight Days. Thay drag'd her out, and tied her to a Post, until the House was rifled. They then loosed her, and bid her walk. She could not stir. By the help of a Stick she got half a step forward. She look'd up to God. On the sudden a new strength entred into her. She travelled that very Day Twenty Miles a Foot: She was up to the Neck in Water six times that very Day in passing of Rivers. At night she fell over head and ears, into a Slough in a Swamp, and was hardly got out alive. She got not the least Cough nor Cold by all this: She is come home alive unto us.</P>
<P>Many more such Instances might be mentioned. We will super∣fede them all, with a Relation of what befel Mrs. <HI>Bradley</HI> of <HI>Ha∣verly. Ab una Disce omnes.</HI></P>
<P>This Vertuous Woman had been formerly for Two Years together a Captive in the Hands of the Barbarous Indians; a subject of wondrous Afflctions, of wondrous Deliverances. Her Husband at length found her out, and fetch'd her home, and their Family went on happily for six years together after it. But, <HI>the Clouds return after the Rain.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>February</HI> 6, 1703-4. She with her Sister, and a Maid or two, and some Children, (a Man being also in the Room,) were talking about the Indians, and behold, one of the fierce <HI>Tawnies</HI> looked in, with a Gun ready to fire upon them. The <HI>English∣man</HI> pull'd him in, and got him down, and Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> took the opportunity to pour a good quantity of scalding Soap, (which was then boyling over the Fire) upon him, whereby he was kill'd im∣mediately, Another of the Tawnies follow'd at the Heels of his
<PB N="34" REF="001331_0039_0FB27D0CC6719110"/>
Brother, who stabb'd the Englishman to the Heart. Unto him she dispensed also a quantity of her Sope, which not killing him, she with the other Women and Children ran into the Chamber. The House was fired by the Indians, and Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> with her Com∣panions found it necessary to retire behind the House. One of the Women fell into the Hands of the Indians; and they that remai∣ned were Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> and her Sister; each of them having a Child of Mrs. <HI>Bradlies</HI> with her. The Sister was discerned by the Indians, who commanded her to come out unto them, and threatned that they would else cut her to pieces. Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> very generously bid her sit still, and wait for a better time to escape; and offered her, that inasmuch as the Indians knew of but one there, she would be that one, and go out in her stead. She did so, and thereby her obliged Sister and the Child with her were preserved; but Mrs. <HI>Bradly</HI> was no sooner come to the Salvages, but they employ'd a Head-breaker on the Child that she brought unto them.</P>
<P>She was not entred into a Second Captivity; but she had the great Encumbrance of being Big with Child, and within Six Weeks of her Time! After about an Hours Rest, wherein they made her put on Snow Shoes, which to manage, requires more than ordinary agility, she travelled with her Tawny Guardians all that night, and the next day until Ten a Clock, associated with one Woman more who had been brought to Bed but just one Week be∣fore▪ Here they Refreshed themselves a little, and then travelled on till Night; when they had no Refreshment given them, nor had they any, till after their having Travelled all the Forenoon of the day Ensuing; and then too, whatever she took, she did thro' Sickness throw it up again.</P>
<P>She underwent incredible Hardships and Famine: A <HI>Mooses</HI> Hide, as tough as you may Suppose it, was the best and most of her Diet. In one and twenty days they came to their Head-Quarters, were they stayed a Fortnight, But then her Snow-shoes were taken from her; and yet she must go every step above the Knee in Snow, with such weariness, that her Soul often Pray'd, <HI>That the Lord would put an end unto her weary Life!</HI> until they came to another Place, where they stay'd for three Weeks together,</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001331_0040_0FB27D10A12D7C08"/>Here in the Night she found her self ill, and having the help of only one Woman, who got a little Hemlock to lay about her, and with a few sticks made shift to blow up a little Fire, she was in half an Hour Delivered of the Infant, that she had hitherto gone withal. There she lay till the next Night, with none but the Snow under her, and the Heaven over her; in a misty and rainy Season. She sent then unto a French Priest, that he would speak unto her <HI>Squa Mistress,</HI> who then, without Condescending to look upon her, allow'd her a little Birch-Rind, to cover her Head from the Injuries of the Weather, and a little bit of dried Moose, which be∣ing boiled, she drunk the Broth, and gave it unto the Child.</P>
<P>In a Fortnight she was called upon to Travel again, with her Child in her Arms; every now and then, a whole day to∣gether, without the least Morsel of any Food, and when she had any, she fed only on Ground-nuts and Wild-onions, and Lilly-roots. By the last of <HI>May</HI> they arrived at <HI>Cowesick,</HI> where they Planted their Corn; wherein she was put unto a hard Task, so that the Child extreamly Suffered. The Salvages would some times also please themselves, with casting <HI>hot Embers</HI> into the Mouth of the Child, which would render the Mouth so sore, that it could not Suck for a long while together. So that it Starv'd and Dy'd.</P>
<P>There they staid until they Wed their Corn, but then some of our Friend-Indians coming on them, kill'd Seven of them, whereat away they fled for <HI>Canada,</HI> and never saw their Corn-field any more. But they made a Forty-days Ramble of it, before they reach'd thither, in which, if at any time, her Heart began to faint, her Mi∣stress would be ready to strike the Mortal Hatchet into her Head,</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="001331_0041_0FB27D13C0FAC350"/>The <HI>French</HI> being thought more Civil to the English than to the Indians, her Mistress thereat Provoked, resolved, that she would never Sell her to the <HI>French.</HI> Accordingly she kept her a Twelve-month with her, in her Squalid <HI>Wigwam:</HI> Where, in the follow∣ing Winter, she fell sick of a Feavour; but in the very heighth and heat of her Paroxysms, her Mistress would compel her some∣times to Spend a Winters-night, which is there a very bitter one, abroad in all the bitter Frost and Snow of the Climate. She reco∣vered; but Four Indians died of the Feavour, and at length her Mi∣stress also. Another Squa then pretended an Heirship unto her, with whom she lived, and saw many more strange Deliverances. They had the Small-Pox in the Family; but she never had it. She was made to pass the River on the Ice, when every step she took, she might have struck through it if she pleased Many more such Preservations might come into her Story.</P>
<P>At Last, there came to the sight of her a Priest from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> who had known her in her former Captivity at <HI>Naridgewock.</HI> He was very Civil to Her, and made the <HI>Indians</HI> Sell her to a French Family, for Fourscore Livers, where tho' she wrought hard, she Lived more comfortably and contentedly.</P>
<P>She poured out her continoal Supplications to Heaven; Some∣times Two or Three of her own Sex, would by Stealth, come to joyn with her in Supplicating to the Glorious LORD. She had her Mind often Irradiated with Strong Perswasions and Assur∣ances, that she should yet <HI>See the Goodness of God,</HI> in this Land of the Living. Her tender and Loving Husband, accompanied Mr. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> in his Last Expedition. He found her out, and fetch'd her home, a Second time; She arriv'd with those of the Last Re∣turn from the Captivity; and affectionately calls upon her Friends, <HI>O magnifie the LORD with me, and let us Exalt his Name to∣gether▪</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Letter from a Captive at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. 18. 1703.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Occasion of my now Writing to you is because I lye under a Vow and Promise to the Great and Almighty God, to declare and make Known his wonderful Goodness and Mercy to me, and livewise to have His Name Blessed and Praised in your Congregation on my Behalf. I shall briefly Inform you.</P>
<P>Being taken a Prisoner some time last <HI>January</HI> by the <HI>French:</HI> in going to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> we met with very Tempestuous Weather, and were fast in an Harbour near Cape <HI>Sables.</HI> And here two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> had Or∣ders from their Captain to take me with them, and go to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> by Land. They took with them but little Bread; and we Travelled one Night in the Woods in a miserable Condition. I had my self no Shoes nor Stockings, but a piece of Skin wrapt about about my Feet; and the Snow being very deep, we could not Travel, being Weak for want of Provision, and lost in the Woods, not knowing which way to go.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="001331_0044_0FB27D201D513FC0"/>One of the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> Loaded his Gun, and Present∣ed it at me, telling me, <HI>That it was impossible to find</HI> Port-Royal, <HI>I must Dye, and they must Eat me.</HI> Then I begged leave to Pray unto God, before he Kill'd me, and he Granted it. As I was at Prayer, it struck in∣to my Mind, That I had formerly heard your self declare in your Pulpit, what Great and Wonderful Things hath been done by Prayer; particularly, <HI>That it had stopped the Mouths of Lions, and that it had Quen∣ched the Violence of the Fire.</HI> So I earnesty begged of God, that he would manifest his great Power to me, by turning the Hearts of those that were about to take away my Life.</P>
<P>The Words were no sooner out of my Mouth, but the <HI>Frenchman</HI> seeming to have Tears in his Eyes, bid me rise up; he would try one Day longer. And he bid me go and get Wood for a Fire. It presently grew Dark; and then I made an Escape from them, and hid my self in the Woods, until the next Day that they were gone; and then I found the way out of the Woods, unto the Water-side, where I got <HI>Clams.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>French-men</HI> found the way to <HI>Port-royal,</HI> and there told what they had done. The Governour put them in Prison, and sent out Two Men, and Charg∣ed them not to return, until they had found me, Dead or Alive. In Four Days after these <HI>Frenchmen</HI> left me, they found me Alive, and brought me Provision, and a Pair of Shoes, and carried me to <HI>Port-royal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001331_0045_0FB37DC9512C31C8"/>These and many other Favours have I received from my Good God in the time of my Impri∣sonment; Blessed and for ever Praised be his Holy Name for it. Pray, Sir, give me Directions what I shall do for the Great and Good GOD.</P>

<P>OUr Eastern Indians had no sooner, with all possible Assurance renewed their League of Peace with us, but being moved by the Instigation of the <HI>French,</HI> they Perfidiously and Barbarously Sur∣prized Seven more of our naked and secure Plantations; and co∣ming at once into the scattered Families, they did, on <HI>August</HI> 10, 11. 1703: Reward the Hospitable Civilities that were shown them, with the Murder of above Seventy <HI>English</HI> People, and the Captivity of near an Hundred. Upon this there Ensued Lesser Depredations, and Captivations, as the Treacherous Enemy found Opportunity for them.</P>
<P>About half a year after these Calamities thus begun on the <HI>East∣ern</HI> Parts of the Country, the <HI>Western</HI> had a taste of the same Cup given to them. On <HI>Feb.</HI> 29. 1703 4.

<P>They Surprised the Place about an Hour or Two before Break of Day, and in a little time, not without Loss to themselves, Butch∣ered and Captivated above 150 of the People.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Williams,</HI> the Worthy Minister of that Pious and Holy Flock, was carried into Captivity, with Five of his Children; two of which were Slain; and his Desirable Consort beginning to Faint at about a Dozen Miles of the doleful Journey, they there, like them∣selves, cruelly Murdered her, and left her for the Funeral which her Friends afterwards bestow'd on her. Before they reach'd unto <HI>Mont Real,</HI> a Journey dispatch'd by the Parcels now divided in Twenty Days, more or less, near Twenty more of the Captives lost their Lives; for the manner was, that if any found themselves not able to Travel thro' the Deep Snows now on the Ground, the Salvages would strike their Hatchets into their Heads, and there leave them weltring in their Blood.</P>
