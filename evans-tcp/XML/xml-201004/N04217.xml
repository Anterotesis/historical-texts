<HEAD>THE <HI>Danger</HI> of an <HI>unqualified</HI> Ministry.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I TIMOTHY iii. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Not a NOVICE; lest being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Introduction of well qualified Persons into the ministerial Office, being of such Importance to the true Interest of Christianity, it was found worthy of <HI>apostolick</HI> Inspection and Care. Ac∣cordingly we find the <HI>Apostle Paul,</HI> the inspired and learned Writer of this <HI>Epistle,</HI> filling up <HI>six Verses,</HI> in the Beginning of this Chapter, with serious Advice and Cau∣tion to <HI>Timothy</HI> about it, and pursuing the same Argument in many other Passages of his <HI>Epistles.</HI></P>
<P>The great <HI>Apostle,</HI> first of all, allows it to be a <HI>true and faith∣ful Saying, that if a Man desire the Office of a Bishop,</HI> an Over∣seer and Teacher in the Church of CHRIST, <HI>he desireth a good Work;</HI> an honourable (however, at the same Time, a labori∣ous and dangerous) Function. It is a most useful and sacred Employment, a <HI>good Work,</HI> whereby the Glory of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men are greatly promoted: For 'tis the evident Design of the Institution of the <HI>evangelical Ministry</HI> to instruct and save a miserable World, and thereby advance the Glory of <HI>divine Grace.</HI></P>
<P>The good <HI>Apostle</HI> then proceeds to ennumerate the superior and necessary Qualifications of <HI>a Bishop,</HI> or <HI>good Minister</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, which <HI>Timothy</HI> must carefully observe, in admitting Persons to this high and sacred Office; which
<PB N="6" REF="005198_0005_1016E1C7749E2B48"/>amount to no less than <HI>sixteen in the six following Verses, viz. A Bishop must be blameless; The Husband of one Wife,</HI> that is, <Q>One that has not put away his Wife for every Cause (as the Manner of some then was) and married another;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> in Loc.</NOTE></Q> <HI>vigilant; sober; of good Behaviour; given to Hospitality;</HI> APT TO TEACH; <HI>not given to Wine; no Striker; not greedy of fil∣thy Lucre, but patient; not a Brawler; not covetous: one that ruleth well his own House, having his Children in Subjection with all Gravity; for if a Man know not how to rule his own House, how shall he take Care of the Church of God?</HI></P>
<P>The fifteenth Qualification of a Gospel Minister, which the <HI>Apostle</HI> here gives <HI>Timothy,</HI> is contained in this wise Caution, viz. NOT A NOVICE; <HI>that is,</HI> as 'tis expressed in the Mar∣gin of the Bible, <HI>one newly come to the Faith:</HI> Plainly intima∣ting, that a <HI>Bishop</HI> must be well instructed and established in the Faith. <HI>Every Scribe, which is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, is like unto a Man that is an Housholder, which bring∣eth forth out of his Treasure Things new and old.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> 13, 52.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Word answering to the English one, NOVICE, is <HI>Neophutos,</HI> "Which properly signifies, one that is but newly planted, or instructed in the Faith." "A raw young Chris∣tian." And this inspired <HI>Apostle</HI> absolutely forbids, that such an one should be admitted into <HI>holy Orders.</HI> And the subjoins a very solemn Reason, which loudly bespeaks the great Danger of such an one's Undertaking this Ministry; viz. <HI>Lest being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil:</HI> both into the Devil's <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Punishment.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> well observes, that <HI>Neophutos,</HI> NOVICE, "Signifies not in Respect of Age," for <HI>Timothy</HI> himself was such, yet the Apostle gave him Authority to command and teach in the Church, and suffered no Man to despise <HI>his Youth:</HI> But it "signifies in Respect of receiving the Faith," one new∣ly brought over to the Profession of the Christian Faith, whe∣ther young or old. So then according to the genuine Use of the Word, a Man may be a Novice, or Babe in understand∣ing the Mysteries of the Gospel, and so very unqualified to un∣dertake the ministerial Office, who, in <HI>Respect of Age,</HI> may be honoured as a <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Master:</HI> And on the other Hand, a
<PB N="7" REF="005198_0006_1016E1F5EDF313A8"/>Person that is <HI>young in Years</HI> may yet be freed from the Im∣putation of a <HI>Novice,</HI> as was young <HI>Timothy</HI> in Respect of his good moral and ministerial Accomplishments, and so be coun∣ted worthy of some ecclesiastical Dignity and Preferment.</P>
<P>The last Qualification of a <HI>Bishop</HI> here mentioned, is, in the 7 Ver. in these Words, <HI>He must have a good Report of them which are without, lest he fall into Reproach, and the Snare of the Devil,</HI></P>
<P>Such are the Apostolick Directions here given to <HI>Timothy</HI> about introducing Men into the Gospel-Ministry; and they are of standing Use to the Church of CHRIST, and should be carefully observed by all those whose Office it is to confer <HI>holy Orders.</HI> Hence the <HI>Apostle</HI> also adds that solemn Caution, in the fifth Chapter of this Epistle and twenty-second Verse, <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on no Man.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now give you the Sum of the whole Matter in this doctrinal Note, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> That it is of very dangerous Tendency for <HI>unqualified</HI> Persons to be <HI>employed in the sacred Ministry:</HI> Or, that the <HI>Pas∣tors of the Churches</HI> should use <HI>great Caution and Vigilance in admitting Persons to the ministerial Office.</HI> For the Danger of putting unsuitable and unqualified Men into the evangelical Ministry is much every Way, tho' the <HI>Text</HI> confines it to the Persons that dare invade this sacred Office in a State of NO∣VICESHIP.</P>
<P>But yet, as Necessity is laid upon the Officers of the Church to exclude such from the Ministry, they are in Danger of in∣volving themselves in the same Guilt and Condemnation, by opening a wide Door of Entrance, and prostituting the holy Ministry to every bold Intruder. <HI>Be not Partaker of other Men's Sins, that ye receive not of their Plagues.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, such unfaithful Ministers are the very Instruments of enhancing the Guilt and Punishment of every such <HI>Novice,</HI> by admitting them to a Dignity and Office for which they have not one <HI>canonical</HI> Qualification. This is the Mean of <HI>lifting them up with Pride,</HI> and precipitating them into the <HI>Condemna∣tion of the Devil.</HI> So then, the <HI>Danger</HI> of employing <HI>unqua∣lified</HI> Men in the <HI>Ministry</HI> is greater, and of more extensive bad Influence than is at first imagined; yea, the important Interest of Christianity is vastly affected by this preposterous
<PB N="8" REF="005198_0007_1016E1C904A3CE20"/>and evil Practice, as may be shewn in the Sequel of this Discourse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danger</HI> hereof is great,
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, To every NOVICE who undertakes the Work of the Ministry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, To every <HI>Officer in the Church</HI> who authoriseth their Mission.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, The Danger hereof is great to the <HI>Souls</HI> of them that are <HI>taught and led by them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, The Ministry of unqualified Men is of very dangerous and destructive Tendency to the <HI>true Interest of Religion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Seasonableness and Importance of this Subject, in these Times, led my Thoughts to the Choice of it, when my <HI>Re∣verend Brother</HI> asked me to stand in his Place, and be his Mo∣nitor upon this solemn Occasion. He &amp; others must take it as a sure Token of my unfeigned Love to him, &amp; Desire to serve him, that I have taken this Work upon me, under great Infir∣mity of Body &amp; Mind: And this must be my Apology for the many Defects, this venerable Audience may doubtless discover in the Performance. <HI>Brethren I am with you in Weakness, in much Fear and Trembling.</HI> But in a humble Dependance on the Help of Divine Grace, shall endeavour to speak as the <HI>O∣racles of GOD,</HI> and minister as of <HI>the Ability which GOD giv∣eth.</HI> And whilst in <HI>our Doctrine we shew Uncorruptness, Gra∣vity, Sincerity, and sound Speech,</HI> we ought not to <HI>be condemned: Why then dost thou find Fault? To the Law, and to the Testi∣mony; if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no Light in them.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 8.20.</NOTE> Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that Thing which he alloweth.</HI> But to proceed,—</P>
<P N="1">1. To shew, in the first Place, the <HI>dangerous State and Sci∣tuation of every</HI> NOVICE, <HI>who undertakes the Work of the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>The great and learned <HI>Apostle</HI> represents it in strong and aw∣ful Terms; <HI>Lest being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Such is the fearful Expectation of an inspired <HI>Apostle</HI> concerning such as intrude themselves into the sacred Ministry, without some due previous Qualifications
<PB N="9" REF="005198_0008_1016E1F7787723A0"/>for it. He represents them as exposing themselves to violent Temptation, and terrible Condemnation: They are <HI>in Danger of the Judgment.</HI> Their Danger is great whether they know it, or not. The Mouth of an inspired <HI>Apostle</HI> has declared and forewarned them of it. St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself was well acquainted with the Infirmities and Temptations of Christians in general, and Ministers in particular; he experimentally knew the Dan∣ger, even an <HI>Apostle</HI> of CHRIST was in, of being <HI>lifted up with Pride,</HI> through extraordinary Manifestations of GOD unto him, as he himself expresseth it for his own Humiliation, and the Instruction of all Ages, in 2 Cor. 12.7, 8, 9. <HI>Lest I should be exalted above Measure, through the Abundance of the Reve∣lations, there was given to me a Thorn in the Flesh, the Messenger of Satan to buffet me.—For this Thing I besought the LORD thrice, that it might depart from me.</HI> But what saith the An∣swer of GOD his <HI>Saviour</HI> unto him? <HI>My Grace is sufficient for thee, for my Strength is made perfect in Weakness.</HI> It is enough that this Affliction is given thee for thy Good, and that I support thee under it. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Novice, by being admitted to the Dignity of an Ambas∣sador for CHRIST, is in Danger of being lifted up with Pride.</HI> Having but lately profess'd, and been initiated into the Chri∣stian Faith by the sacred Rites thereto belonging, he may be peculiarly exposed to this <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>devilish Lust,</HI> whether he be really sanctified, or not.</P>
<P>If he be only <HI>externally called</HI> to be a <HI>Saint,</HI> and not really converted, he only heaps up Fuel to feed this <HI>foolish and hurt∣ful Lust,</HI> by all his high and specious Professions of Godliness. <HI>Pride</HI> has an absolute Ascendency and Dominion over him, and he walks in <HI>Pride,</HI> at the same Time that he puts on the Cloak of religious Zeal. He makes a <HI>fair Shew in the Flesh,</HI> that he may more securely indulge his unmortified Lusts, and Passions, and hugs his Pride. And thus he endeavours to sanc∣tify all the deceitful Workings of it by a forward sanctimonious Zeal for the Glory of GOD and the Good of Men.</P>
<P>GOD knows the reigning Pride and Naughtiness of his Heart, at the same Time that he pretends to be high in the Favour of GOD, zealous for his Glory, and crucified to the World: And <HI>when he is judged, he shall be condemned.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005198_0009_1016E1CBABE22568"/>
He also that has but newly embraced the Christian Faith, and received CHRIST, may also be under peculiar and strong Temptations to Pride and Vanity, by receiving ecclesiastical Preferment; especially, if he be brought out of a State of dark Heathenism into this marvellous Light anti Grace. A true Convert may be justly stiled a <HI>Novice</HI> in the Things of GOD, and deemed very unworthy of the ministerial Office. So great a Dignity, so suddenly bestowed on him, may tempt him to Pride, such a Preferment in the Church tends directly to feed his Pride; and exalt him above Measure. For there is the Remainder of this spiritual Lust in the Regenerate, and it is a secret and dangerous Enemy to their Salvation; and alas! who are in more Danger of falling into this <HI>Snare of the De∣vil</HI> than Persons of little Knowledge, and great Zeal? Or than <HI>Novices</HI> in Religion?</P>
<P>Such Persons are very unfit to have the Instruction and Go∣vernment of the Church committed to them, however wise and sufficient they are in their own Conceits for these Things. This Affectation of being Teachers in the Church of CHRIST may, and doth commonly arise from bad Causes; such as gross Ignorance, Partiality, Pride, Self-Conceit, Love of po∣pular Applauses, Presumption and Confidence; and such as are influenced by it would do well to examine and know them∣selves, and the Principles and Motives by which they are rul∣ed; for 'tis no uncommon Thing to see the worst Designs covered under the goodly Appearance of religious Zeal, and high Pretences to the SPIRIT.</P>
<P><HI>Novices</HI> are <HI>Babes in Understanding,</HI> and have Need that one teach them which be the <HI>first Principles of the Oracles of GOD,</HI> instead of taking to themselves the Office of publick Teach∣ers. Ignorance, Conceit, and Pride too often consist together in the same Subject, and betray Persons into wild and extra∣vagant Conduct. We read in I Cor. 4.19. <HI>Of the Speech of them which are puffed up.</HI> Such are apt to boast of a false Gift, and pride themselves in some high Accomplishments, which exist only in their vain Imaginations. The Scripture supposeth that a <HI>Man may think himself to be something, when he is nothing,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.3.</NOTE> and thereby deceive himself, and not only so,
<PB N="11" REF="005198_0010_1016E1FA968B06D0"/>but be a Derision also to all about him. <HI>Be not wise in your own Conceits.</HI></P>
<P>Pride has always been the Bane of the Church, as it was the Ruin of the Devil. And how mysterious soever it be, that Pride should enter into such pure, intellectual Beings, as were the fallen Angels in their first Estate, yet it is not at all strange to account for the Working of it in an apostate Crea∣ture. It is here insinuated that Pride was the Devil's Sin, what threw him headlong into Perdition; this is the Offspring of the Devil, and full of all Subtilty and Mischief, the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Disobedience, and <HI>that lusteth to Envy</HI> in the Regenerate.</P>
<P>"It seems the Devil was tempted by the glorious Condition wherein he was created to aspire after the <HI>Godhead,</HI>" and be as GOD; and this was the Snare the Devil laid to seduce &amp; ruin our first Parents in their primitive and exalted State. For so the Devil insinuates to our Mother <HI>Eve, That God knew, that in the Day they eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, then their Eyes should be opened, and they should be as Gods, know∣ing Good and Evil.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. 3.5.</NOTE> So that a dignified State is not out of the Reach of Temptation to Pride; but such as receive ec∣clesiastical Honours may be exposed to peculiar and dangerous Temptations. Especially <HI>Novices</HI> are in great Danger of growing giddy and lordly in such an elevated State in the Church; and such Persons indeed most commonly <HI>love to have the Preheminence,</HI> and are most apt to be confident, assuming and desirous of <HI>vain Glory.</HI> Vain Man has naturally an insa∣tiable Thirst after Honour, not considering that Promotion is a mighty Incentive to Pride.</P>
<P>Pride, Pride is the Enemy of all Righteousness, and the true Source of Abundance of Mischief to the Church of GOD. The wise Man observes, <HI>Only by Pride cometh Contention;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 13.10.</NOTE> though it has many Coverings and Windings to hide and transform it self in. The Working of it is after the <HI>Working of Satan,</HI> with all Deceivableness and cunning Craftiness. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings</HI> Schisms, Errors, Heresies, Disorders, Intrusions, Confusions, Emu∣lations, Hatred, Wrath, Strife in the Church of CHRIST?
<PB N="12" REF="005198_0011_1016E1CE75A667D0"/>Come they not hence, even of this devilish Lust of Pride? This also is like to be the Plague and Pest of the Church, 'till this Enemy shall be destroyed, when the Church shall com∣mence triumphant. <HI>Then cometh the End when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to GOD, even the FATHER, when he shall have put down all Rule, and all Authority, and Power; for he must reign, 'till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15.24, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A Novice by being promoted to ecclesiastical Dignity is in Danger of falling into the Condemnation of the Devil:</HI> For so the <HI>Apostle</HI> teacheth us, lest—<HI>he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> This is the Condemnation that is most dreadful and amazing.</P>
<P>Pride was the leading Step, the sad Prologue and Presage to that Condemnation into which the Devil fell, who was cast out of Heaven into the Torments of Hell. This is the Con∣demnation of the Devil. Saith the Apostle <HI>Peter, God spa∣red not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkness, to be reserved unto Judgment.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pet. 2.4.</NOTE> So true is the wise Man's Observation, <HI>Pride goeth before Destruction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil, and our first Parents, and the Children of Pride, have found it so of a Truth by a woful Experience: <HI>Those that walk in Pride, he is able to abase.</HI></P>
<P>Places of the highest Dignity in Church and State, are com∣monly the most slippery and dangerous; and it may be the Pinacle of the Temple, the highest Preferments in the Church, are of all others the most so.—Which Consideration is enough, one would think, to restrain the Ambition of vain Minds, to influence all that are Candidates for the ministerial Office and Dignity, to enter upon it with Humility, Fear and Trembling, and with the most Christian Views and Designs.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Novices,</HI> or <HI>unqualified</HI> Persons, who thrust themselves into the <HI>Office of a Bishop,</HI> and take this Honour to them∣selves they are in manifest Danger of falling into the Con∣demnation of the Devil. Hence we have that wise Caution of the Apostle <HI>James, My Brethren, be not many Masters or
<PB N="13" REF="005198_0012_1016E1FD4A87ADC0"/>Teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater Condem∣nation.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The admitting unqualified Persons into the Mi∣nistry, is of dangerous Consequence to those that authorise their Mission.</HI> Herein they are accessary to their Ruin, for by ex∣alting them to be publick Teachers in the Church, they exalt them above Measure, and lead them into the <HI>Snare of the De∣vil,</HI> and so are chargeable with great Guilt, as is plainly inti∣mated in the forementioned Passages; <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on no Man, neither be Partaker of other Men's Sins, keep thy self pure,</HI> pure from the Blood of all Men: As if one Way for the Overseers of the Flocks to keep themselves pure and inno∣cent from Transgression is, to use proper Caution about filling up the Ministry, and shutting the Door of Ordination against all unqualified Persons.</P>
<P>And indeed the encouraging such Novices to undertake the Charge and Care of Souls, argues a great Degree of Unfaith∣fulness in the Ministers of Christ, and exposeth them to di∣vine and ecclesiastical Censure. Moreover, the Souls of such daring Intruders, and the Souls of them that are committed to their Trust, are greatly endangered by the Unskilfulness of such blind Guides. How then will the Rulers in the Church, who are continually negligent in this Matter, be able to give an Account of their Stewardship to the Judge of all? The Blood of Souls may be required of them: Especially the Souls of such <HI>Novices</HI> whom they have been instrumental of lifting up with Pride, and so delivering unto Satan: For by con∣ferring this Honour upon them, they have given them a pow∣erful Incentive to Lust, and cannot be innocent.</P>
<P>Furthermore, by a servile Compliance with that <HI>Spirit that lusteth</HI> to Pride and Dominion, Ministers basely betray the im∣portant Trust Christ has committed to them: And such a licentious Practice is directly contrary to sacred Canon, parti∣cularly 2 Tim. 2.2. <HI>The Things that thou hast heard of me a∣mong many Witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful Men, who shall be</HI> ABLE TO TEACH OTHERS ALSO.</P>
<P>Not but that <HI>Novices</HI> may artfully creep into the Church, after all the Precaution and Vigilance of its faithful Pastors; but then, if their Admission be not owing to the criminal
<PB N="14" REF="005198_0013_1016E1D21DA89B08"/>Neglect of CHRIST'S Ministers, in examining and proving them, he will not impute it to them for Sin.</P>
<P>However, what is here pleaded for is, that the Officers of Church, that are concern'd in this important Affair, should be very careful to acquaint themselves with the good Qualificati∣ons of those whom they put into the Ministry, and not act with an implicit blind Faith in an Affair of CHRIST'S King∣dom, upon which so much Good depends.</P>
<P>Observe the <HI>apostolick</HI> religious Care with which the <HI>College</HI> of the <HI>Apostles</HI> was filled up, after the Transgression and tra∣gical End of <HI>Judas the Traitor,</HI> as it is expressed in the first Chapter of <HI>Acts. Of these Men,</HI> says <HI>Peter</HI> to the Disciples, <HI>which have companied with us all the Time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us—must one be ordained to be a Witness with us of his Resurrection, and they appointed two,—and they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the Hearts of all Men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, that he may take Part of this Ministry, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was doubtless written for the Direction and Admoni∣tion of the Church in all Ages, and the Pastors of the Churches should remember how they have received and heard, and hold fast the <HI>faithful Word.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>The admitting unqualified Persons into the Ministry, is very dangerous and destructive to the Souls of such as are led of them.</HI> This is of very dangerous Tendency to those, to whom they are sent to minister. For not being possess'd with an awful Sense of the Worth of Souls, and the Importance of the ministerial Office, nor influenced by Christian Motives in the Undertaking of it, nor qualified to feed the Church of GOD, the precious Souls of Men will be in utmost Haz∣zard of perishing under the Ministry of such <HI>Novices.</HI></P>
<P>Such are apt to be confident enough that they <HI>themselves are Guides of the Blind,</HI> and LIGHTS of <HI>them which are in Dark∣ness;</HI> whereas it would be much more safe and becoming for them to be jealous of themselves, and with the most serious Self-Reflection <HI>take Heed that the</HI> Light <HI>which is in them be not Darkness.</HI> Thou which teachest another, teachest thou not thy self? <HI>Thou blind Parisee! Thou Hypocrite! First cast out the Beam out of thine own Eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast
<PB N="15" REF="005198_0014_1016E1FFF3FA5DB0"/>out the Mote out of thy Brother's Eye. But if the Blind lead the Blind, both shall fall into the Ditch.</HI></P>
<P>Sad and dangerous indeed is the State of the Church, when it is so forsaken of GOD, as to be left to the Care of unskilful and unfaithful Guides. GOD complains of such in the <HI>Jewish Church</HI> in old Time. <HI>The Leaders of this People cause them to err, and they that are led of them are destroyed.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. 9.16.</NOTE> <HI>His Watchmen and blind, they are all ignorant.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isai.</HI> 26.10.</NOTE> Such also was the heavy Charge our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> fastens upon the <HI>Jewish Teachers</HI> in his Time. <HI>They be blind Leaders of the Blind.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 15.14.</NOTE> And he pro∣nounces a dreadful Wo unto them, <HI>Wo unto you, ye blind Guides.</HI> It is the greatest Curse of GOD that can fall upon a sinful People, to smite their Teachers with Blindness, and give them up to the Conduct of such blind Guides.</P>
<P>But Thanks be to God, this, I firmly believe, has never been the unhappy Case of his People in this Land, from the Days of our Fathers to this Time: But GOD has highly favoured us with a learned and enlightning, converted and converting Ministry; Tho' some, with fiery Zeal, and but little Know∣ledge and Discretion have of late falsly accused the Body of the Clergy of this Country as <HI>"unconverted, and preaching an unknown Christ."

Says the foremention'd excellent Author, in his Vindication of the standing Ministry of this Land, <Q>May it not be said of the Body of the Ministers in <HI>New-England,</HI> that they are a Set of Men as sound in the Faith, and of as good a Life, as any Part of the Christian Church are favoured with? Hear the Opinion of that eminent Man of GOD, Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> upon this Head. Says he, in their Vindication, in Answer to a Slander of <HI>George Keith</HI> upon the Ministers of <HI>New-England,</HI> There is not that Spot of Ground upon the Face of GOD'S Earth, which can proportionably match <HI>New-England</HI> for Ministers, that not only have and use true Piety, but also are most exemplary for it. <HI>Neighbours,</HI> you have Reason to be thankful for such holy, humble, able, painful and prayerful Ministers as God has generally bless'd these Churches with.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I exhort you, as you would approve yourselves wor∣thy to wear the Name that begun at <HI>Antioch,</HI> that you do not forget that Command of our Lord, Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch for your Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Blessed be the glorious Head of the Church, who has all along delivered these Churches from an ignorant, base, vicious and scandalous Ministry, and has made the Seminaries of Lear∣ning, planted among us, such rich Blessings to them. God forbid, that the Glory <HI>should depart from us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and finally, <HI>The Ministry of Novices is of very dan∣gerous Tendency to the true Interest of Religion.</HI> This is vastly concerned in the good Abilities and Qualifications of all those who undertake the Office of Teachers in the Church of Christ. <HI>That they be apt to teach, sound in the Faith and well reported of all Men, able Men.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Will of GOD our Saviour, in the Institution of a standing Ministry, in his Church; that Men be well qualified and spirited for this great and <HI>good Work;</HI> that they give themselves to Prayer, and <HI>to the Ministry of the Word;</HI> that they make a Business of it, that <HI>their profiting may appear to all,</HI> and that they may profit his People.</P>

Such are <HI>Pastors according to GOD'S Heart,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 3.15.</NOTE> who shall <HI>feed his People with Knowledge and Understanding,</HI> which is Food convenient for rational and immortal Souls, <HI>Angels Food.</HI> For <HI>without Knowledge the Soul cannot be good:</HI> It is pleasant to the Soul, and Understanding shall keep it; and if thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thy self.</P>
<P>He is a <HI>good Minister</HI> of Jesus Christ, who is nourished up in the Words of <HI>Faith and good Doctrine,</HI> being <HI>able also to teach others.</HI></P>
<P>When our blessed Saviour sent forth his Disciples to preach the Gospel, he took Care to furnish them with Powers and Cre∣dentials, sufficient for their Work. He forewarned them of the Difficulty and Danger of their Mission, and for their Security gave them that divine Instruction and Counsel. <HI>Beheld I send you forth as Sheep in the Midst of Wolves; be ye therefore as wise as serpents, and harmless as Doves:</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 10.16.</NOTE> Herein shewing us, that ministerial Wisdom and Prudence are necessary Qualifi∣cations for his Ambassadors; and that it is very dangerous to send forth any in that sacred Character, without such Christian Furniture, <HI>well proved.</HI></P>
<P>Such as rush into the sacred Ministry without it, run before they are sent, and expose themselves and Religion to great Re∣proach. And such ignorant rash Zealots are in manifest Dan∣ger of <HI>corrupting the Word of God,</HI> of handling the Word de∣ceitfully, and doing infinite Injury to the Church of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ never sent them without his Credentials, and therefore they shall not profit his People. <HI>I sent them not, nor commanded them; therefore they shall not profit this People, saith the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 23.32.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is observable, that when Christ gave his Apostles their Commission to go and teach <HI>all Nations,</HI> he directs them <HI>to tarry at Jerusalem until they were endued with Power from on High;</HI> 'till they received their Credentials, in the extraor∣dinary Gifts of Tongues and Miracles, which, we read in the <HI>second Chapter of Acts,</HI> were gloriously bestowed on them, to qualify them for such an extraordinary Mission, as gospelizing the whole World.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005198_0017_1016E1D6B8FB0170"/>
The Apostles of our Lord have been very careful to give the Churches of Christ all the necessary Qualifications of good Ministers of Jesus Christ, that they may be furnished at all Times with able and faithful Pastors, and so be kept pure from a corrupt and bad Ministry.</P>
<P>Indeed, whosoever has a just Apprehension of the Great∣ness, Difficulty and Importance of the evangelical Ministry, needeth not Arguments to convince him of the Necessity of encouraging and supporting learned and godly Pastors in the Churches. It is therefore owing to Ignorance, Pride, and Want of Consideration and Judgment, that any think and speak contrarywise, That Men of mean Abilities and Attain∣ments in Knowledge, are able to preach the <HI>unsearchable Riches</HI> of Christ, open the great Mysteries of Godliness, and defend the Gospel.</P>
<P>Alas! It requires no small Compass of Reason and Learn∣ing to be able to preach and defend the Gospel; for Mini∣sters are set to defend, as well as preach the everlasting Gos∣pel: And if Need be, they must <HI>contend earnestly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. The Servant of the Lord must also be patient, in Meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.</HI></P>
<P>It is also required of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> That <HI>he hold fast the faithful Word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound Doc∣trine both to exhort, and convince the Gainsayers (for there are many unruly and vain Talkers and Deceivers,</HI> as in the Apostles Days, so in all Ages of the Church, whose <HI>Mouths must be stopped; who subvert whole Houses, teaching Things which they ought not for filthy Lucres Sake);<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.9, 10, 11.</NOTE> In Doctrine shewing Un∣corruptness, Gravity, Sincerity, sound Speech that cannot be con∣demned, that he that is of the contrary Part, may be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>But how shall they, that are <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>unlearned,</HI> be able to do this? To convince Gainsayers, and defend the great Mysteries and Truths of the Gospel, against the <HI>cunning Craf∣tiness</HI> of them that lie in Wait to deceive? Instead of doing these to any good Purpose, those <HI>Aliens</HI> will be in great Dan∣ger of corrupting the Truth, and so being <HI>put to Flight</HI> before the Adversaries thereof. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> says, that in
<PB N="19" REF="005198_0018_1016E204AE4A1900"/><HI>Paul's Epistles there are some Things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures unto their own Destruction.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.16.</NOTE></P>
<P>For GOD'S Sake, <HI>Brethren,</HI> what would have become of the Christian Religion long ago, had it not been for the wise and learned Defenders of it against its ablest Adversaries? Such as the Apostle <HI>Paul, Origen, Justin Martyr,</HI> and others among the Fathers; and many since the Time of the Re∣formation of the Church from <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>God has raised up able Advocates and Apologists to espouse and defend his own Cause from Age to Age, who have been <HI>valiant for the Truth,</HI> and quitted themselves like Men in the Cause of God, so that Truth has not <HI>fallen in the Streets,</HI> but still prevails in the Earth.</P>
<P>And indeed the Revival of Learning, since the glorious Reformation, has been a great Elucidation and Establishment of the Truths of our holy Religion: So that the Enemies of good Literature are Enemies to the true Interest of Christianity, whether they know it or not.</P>
<P>It has been publickly observed, that the Interest of Religion and good Literature, have been wont to rise and fall toge∣ther: Wherefore say <HI>our Fathers,</HI> <Q>As we desire that Reformation and Religion should flourish, it concerns us to endeavour, that both the College and all other Schools of Learning, in every Place, be duly inspected and en∣couraged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Treatise, P. 257, 8.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Alas! How soon would the Church of God be laid deso∣late, if the Hedge of a learned, able and faithful Ministry, which Christ hath set about it, were once taken down. Ig∣norance, Error, Heresy, Superstition, Confusion and every evil Work, would soon cover the Face of the Vineyard of the Lord of Hosts. It would quickly be over-grown with Thorns, and Nettles cover the Face thereof, when the Wall thereof is broken down. With such awful Severity and Judgment, God threatens the Church of <HI>Israel</HI> for their Unfruitfulness under his most gracious Cultivations in Isa. 5.5, 6. <HI>And now—I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard, I will take away the Hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up, and break down the Wall
<PB N="20" REF="005198_0019_1016E1DA11330F98"/>thereof, and it shall be troden down, and I will lay it Waste, it shall not be pruned, nor digged, and there shall come up Briars and Thorns, I will also command the Clouds that they rain no Rain upon it.</HI></P>
<P>Were the Gospel-Treasure put into broken Vessels, it would soon run out and perish. If the Teaching and Government of the Church were committed to unskilful and unfaithful Guides, <HI>Ignorance would soon be the Mother of Devotion;</HI> and Heresy and Confusion, the Doctrine and Discipline of the Christian Church. For to this Purpose testisieth the <HI>Apostle Peter,</HI> by the Spirit of Prophecy,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>There shall be false Teach∣ers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies,— and many shall follow their pernicious Ways, by Reason of whom the Way of Truth shall be Evil spoken of. And through Cove∣teousness shall they with feigned Words, make Merchandize of you.—</HI></P>
<P>How is it possible for a <HI>Novice</HI> to magnify his Office, and recommend Religion to the Esteem and Practice of Men? <HI>He that teacheth Man Knowledge should not he know? Because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the People Knowledge, and sought to find out acceptable Words.</HI> But how shameful is it, for weak, raw, illiterate Men to exalt themselves to the Priest∣hood, and set up for Teachers in the Church? who have Need that one teach them, which be the <HI>first Principles</HI> of the Oracles of God? <HI>And have Need of Milk,</HI> and <HI>should as new-born Babes desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby?</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the setting up and sending forth such Teachers in the Church of Christ, is the great Reproach to Christianity, and the direct Way to promote <HI>the Contempt of the Clergy,</HI> than which a greater Injury can scarce be offered to the true interest of Religion.</P>
<P>Thus I have finished the <HI>doctrinal Part of my Subject,</HI> and shall now close it with several useful Reflections.—</P>
<P>First, <HI>We may learn, from what has been offered upon this Argument, the great Care that the glorious Head of the Church, has taken for its Instruction and Support.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005198_0020_1016E206B73F0D18"/>
For to this End, Christ was pleased to raise up a Succession of <HI>inspired Prophets and Teachers in the Jewish Church,</HI> and <HI>at sundry Times, and in divers Manners, spake unto the Fathers by them.</HI> In the Fulness of Time, he manifested himself to Is∣rael, full of Grace and Truth, as the <HI>Lord who teacheth us to Profit,</HI> as the great Teacher of the Church, <HI>who spake as never Man spake.</HI> When he had finished the Work of GOD, and ascended up on High, he gave Gifts unto Men, <HI>Some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the Highest himself has established the Security and Safety of the Church in Opposition to the confederated Powers of Earth and Hell, in that glorious Promise, <HI>That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Its Defence is of GOD. GOD is in the midst of her, therefore the <HI>burning Bush</HI> is not consumed. <HI>We have a strong City, Salvation will GOD appoint for Walls and bulwarks.</HI></P>
<P>How beautiful and safe is the Church in the Favour and Protection of the Almighty, under all the Imperfection that cleaves to his Ministers and Members in this militant State? This is our Hope, and this our Confidence, that <HI>God will help her, and that right early.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, This Doctrine gives a Rule of Conduct to the Mi∣nisters of Christ in admitting Persons into the sacred Ministry;</HI> that they proceed with great Care and Caution in such a weigh∣ty Affair, as they would approve themselves faithful to Christ and his Interest. They are forbid to put a <HI>Novice</HI> into the evangelical Ministry. <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on no Man.</HI></P>
<P>For any of the Ministers of Christ then, to give their Cre∣dentials to unworthy Men, is to act directly in the Face of Scripture Canons, and betray the Cause of Christ. It is real∣ly to expose their own Souls and the Souls of all they are con∣cerned with to <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and doing infinite Mischief to the true Interest of Religion.</P>

I would use here great Plainness of Speech, for I apprehend the Case requires it, and freely say, that I can't see how Mini∣sters can answer to GOD and their own Consciences, their ad∣mitting raw, indiscreeit, rash, illiterate and blind NOVICES into their Pulpits, and commending them to these Churches, as useful Instruments of carrying on the Work of GOD, as hath been the Manner of some more lately.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I leave it to those Reverend Gentleman, who signed the <HI>Testi∣mony of the Assembly of Pastors in July last,</HI> to reconcile their own Conduct with the Advice therein given, in this very In∣stance (among others) viz. <Q>That Ministers do not encourage <HI>raw</HI> and <HI>indiscreet</HI> young <HI>Candidates</HI> in rushing into parti∣cular Places, and preaching publickly or privately, as some have done to the no small Disrepute and Damage of the Work where it once promised to flourish.</Q>
<P>For it is notorious that some Rev. <HI>Subscribers,</HI> or <HI>Attestators,</HI> soon after the breaking up of that <HI>Assembly</HI> admitted an illiterate and BLIND Guide into their Pulpits.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Overseers</HI> of the Flocks of Christ, are indispensably obliged, by his holy Word, to commit this sacred Treasure to <HI>faithful Men who shall be ably to teach others also,</HI> and not to cast these holy Things <HI>to the Dogs of the Flock.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be feared, that there has been too much Indifference and Coldness among the <HI>Clergy of New-England,</HI> as well as elsewhere, in this important Article, of <HI>examining and introdu∣cing Candidates</HI> into the Ministry; especially, in the Years last past, has the <HI>sacred Ministry</HI> been laid too <HI>common,</HI> as if it were not a <HI>sacred Enclosure,</HI> and any bold Intruder might take <HI>this Honour to himself,</HI> without <HI>due Qualifications,</HI> or a <HI>regular Call;</HI> which in the Nature of Things bodes very Ill to the Church of Christ: Whereas the Scripture saith, <HI>No Man taketh this Honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 16.18.</NOTE></P>
<P>Were the Ministry of the Gospel committed to ignorant, conceited <HI>Novices,</HI> 'tis not unlikely that, within two seven Years, the Church would be reduced to a State of <HI>Heathen∣ism, thick Darkness would cover the Earth, and gross Darkness the People.</HI></P>

And the present <HI>unbounded License</HI> of publick Teaching, I apprehend to be a leading Step to the scandalous Disorders and Confusions of these Times: And its high Time to correct and reform this shameful Abuse of the ministerial Authority.</P>
<P>But to the Praise of the Government of this <HI>Colony,</HI> be it spoken, that they have expressed an examplary Care in this Matter of introducing <HI>Candicates</HI> into the holy Ministry, a∣bove all the <HI>Provinces in New-England:</HI> And it is doubtless a great Part of the Beauty and Strength of your good Con∣stitution. We rejoice, <HI>beholding your Order, and the Stedfastness of your Faith in Christ.</HI> Upon this very Thing depends the Safety and Prosperity of these Churches.</P>
<P>Suffer me then, my <HI>reverend Fathers and Brethren,</HI> (though most unworthy) to press it upon you to shew all good Fidelity in this important Affair. For this <HI>Power</HI> of examining and putting Men into the Ministry, is committed to you to exercise for the Good of the Church. Oh let it not be in vain, but approve yourselves faithful to Christ, and the Souls of Men, that you may <HI>both save your own Souls,</HI> and be happily instru∣mental, in this Way, of promoting the <HI>common Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, This Doctrine also admonisheth the Churches of Christ, to take Heed of committing their Souls to the Care of unskilful Novices.</HI> For hereby the Souls of Men are exposed to eternal Ruin. Who then in his Wits would be careless and uncon∣cerned in the Choice of a Guide and Pastor to his Soul? There is surely no Affair in the whole Circle of Life that re∣quires more serious Care and assiduous Prayer, than this of choosing able, faithful, skilful Guides for our Souls. And as Christ has given these Churches Power of choosing their own Pastors, so let them be exhorted to <HI>stand fast in the Liberty</HI> wherewith he hath made them free, and not abuse it in a criminal Manner.</P>
<P>Let the Churches be advised to act with prudent Care and Caution in the Exercise of this Power. Be not fond of <HI>No∣velties,</HI> but <HI>covet earnestly the best Gifts.</HI> Ask Counsel of God, and take the best Advice of the faithful Ministers of Christ; who are commonly most able and ready to serve your best In∣terest. Oh beware of <HI>heaping to yourselves Teachers,</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="005198_0023_1016E1DF96EBE798"/>leaning to your own Understanding. <HI>For the Time will come,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>when they will not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own Lusts shall they heap to themselves Teachers, having itching Ears; and they shall turn away their Ears from the Truth, and shall be turned unto Fables.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Tim,</HI> 4.3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Verily, 'tis to be feared, we are fallen into this Time, now so many of unstable Minds are ready to forsake their own faithful and approved Pastors, and the assembling themselves together, to follow the <HI>sounding Brass</HI> of ignorant, conceited <HI>Novices. Verily, verily I say unto you,</HI> saith our Saviour, the good Shepherd, <HI>he that entereth not in by the Door into the Sheepfold, but climbeth up some other Way, the same is a Thief, and a Robber. But he that entereth in by the Door, is the Shep∣herd of the Sheep. To him the Porter openeth, and the Sheep hear his Voice.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 10.1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>This Doctrine ministers Reproof to every NOVICE that is thrusting himself into the Ministry.</HI> For do but consider the infinite Danger of so doing; <HI>Lest being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Such know not what they ask and seek, whilst they are striving for the Mastery, to enter into the sacred Ministry. <HI>My Brethren, be not many Masters,</HI> don't be too forward and hasty, in setting up for Teachers, <HI>lest ye receive the greater Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>Yet strange it is, that so many, in these Days, apprehend themselves well qualified for the ministerial Office without Learning, or Study, or any Qualification for this good Work; except Ignorance, and Confidence may be accounted such. It is to be suspected, that Pride and Self-Conceit is at the Bot∣tom of such a stupid and wild Conduct. What other Cause but Pride can be assigned for the very scandalous Intrusions of illiterate <HI>Lay-Men,</HI> and <HI>raw Novices</HI> into the Labours of GOD'S faithful Ministers, in one Place and another, to the great Vexation and Disturbance of the Churches of Christ in this Land? <HI>Only by Pride cometh Contention.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Reverend Mr. Appleton,</HI> in his late excellent Sermon to the <HI>Convention of Pastors in the Massachusetts Bay,</HI> gravely adviseth such Ministers as <HI>play the Bishop</HI> in another's Diocess,
<PB N="25" REF="005198_0024_1016E20EF15326C8"/><Q>To examine themselves and see, whether it don't proceed from, and whether it don't serve to cherish a secret Pride in the Heart, that they are not aware of, being covered o∣ver with a Zeal for doing all the Good they can?</Q> He goes on to represent the Mischiefs that commonly attend such a Practice, with peculiar Force of Expression.— <Q>And doubt∣less it is found commonly to hurt the Ministers into whose Parishes they intrude themselves, as it tends to draw off the Esteem and Affections of their People from them, and very much obstructs and hinders their Usefulness among them, and so in this Way it is also very hurtful to the Peo∣ple, and they lose very much the Benefit of the standing Ministry among them. Moreover, it has a Tendency to unhinge People, to put them in an unsteady Frame, it causes itching Ears, &amp;c.</Q>—Indeed, <HI>says he,</HI><Q>There are some <HI>Stars of Light</HI> that have their Orbits quite cross the Spheres of the Earth, and all the other Planets, such as <HI>Comets,</HI> or <HI>blazing Stars;</HI> but these are such, as are extremely heated, and set into a Blaze; and have been look'd upon as omi∣nous Appearances, and whatever Use God may make of them, for the Benefit of those Globes whose Spheres they cross;—yet it may be said, that the State they are supposed to be in, and the Manner of their Motion is such, that they give a most dreadful Shock to some Globe, that should hap∣pen to come in their Way.—So that there is no Argument from <HI>Comets</HI> for Ministers to set up for <HI>wandring Stars;</HI> in∣deed GOD may, and does bring Good out of such Things, but for Men (without any plain Call) to go from Place to Place, entering into other Men's Charges, and crossing their Spheres, I think, is very ominous to the Church of Christ, and threatens their <HI>Peace,</HI> their <HI>Purity</HI> and their <HI>Order</HI> exceedingly.—We know what Kind of Angels they were that <HI>kept not their first Estate, but left their own Habitation.</HI></Q>—</P>
<P>I am fully perswaded, that great have been the Mischiefs and Inconveniences that have risen by the Practice of <HI>Itinerant Preach∣ing,</HI> too many to be now enumerated, which this <HI>Government</HI> by a <HI>late Act,</HI> have in a great Measure restrained. And I'm heartily sorry, with many others, that the last <HI>Convention of Pastors,</HI> in the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> have left the Door still open for the Pro∣gress of Itinerants, when they gently touch this Head in these
<PB N="26" REF="005198_0025_1016E1E265AB4B98"/>Words. <Q>That Ministers do not invade the Province of o∣thers, and in <HI>ordinary Cases</HI> preach in another's Parish, with∣out his Knowledge, and against his Consent.</Q></P>
<P>It well becomes the <HI>Candidates</HI> for the sacred Office of the Ministry, to be humble, prayerful, and teachable, submitting themselves to the Order of the Gospel and these Churches, which will be an excellent Preservative from Envy, Pride, Passion, Confusion and every evil Work.</P>
<P>Says Dr. <HI>Chauncy in his late excellent Treatise on the present State of Religion,</HI> &amp;c. <Q>Its natural to expect Confusion, when meer Youths in Age, as well as Christian Knowledge and Experience, are invited into the Pulpit, and admired for their bold and ignorant speaking of Things they little understand; and shall the Want of Years, and Knowledge and Experience in these Persons be pleaded in Excuse for the wretched Mistakes and Follies they run into? It ought rather to be urged as one of the strongest Reasons against their taking upon them the Business of the Ministry; which would at once prevent all this Mischief.</Q></P>
<P>That learned and pious <HI>Prelate of the Church of England</HI><Q>Bishop <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the <HI>pastoral Care,</HI> represerits the daring Boldness of many Intruders into it, in a most af∣fecting Manner. <HI>Says he,</HI> Our <HI>ember Weeks</HI> are the Burden and Grief of my Life. The much greater Part of those who come to be ordained are ignorant to a Degree, not to be apprehended by those who are not obliged to know it. The easiest Strangers, I mean the plainest Parts of the Scriptures. They cry and think it a said Disgrace to be de∣nied Orders, though the Ignorance of some of them is such, that in a well regulated State of Things they would appear not knowing enough to be admitted to the holy Sacrament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This, <HI>says he,</HI> doth of ten tear my Heart.—These Things pierce one's Soul, and make him often cry out, Oh that I had Wings like a Dove, for then would I fly away and be at Rest.</Q></P>
<P><HI>He observes further,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet's pastoral Care. <HI>P. 50.</HI></NOTE> <Q>It were indeed happy for the Church, if those who offer themselves to Orders had but such a
<PB N="27" REF="005198_0026_1016E21219811D20"/>Sense of them as Tradesman have of their Freedom; who do not pretend to it, 'till they have finished the Time pre∣scribed, and are in some Sort qualified to set up in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whereas alas! Men who neither know the Scriptures, nor the Body of Divinity, who have made no Progress in their Studies, and can give no tolerable Account of that holy Doctrine, in which they desire to be Teachers, do yet, with equal Degrees of Confidence and Importunity, pretend to this Character, and find the Way to it too easy, and the Access to it too free.</Q></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>This Doctrine may also serve to admonish all young unexperienced Converts to take Heed to themselves, watch and be sober; lest being lifted up with Pride, they come into Condemna∣tion.</HI> GOD resisteth the Proud, but he giveth Grace unto the Humble.

If any Man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue—this Man's Religion is vain.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jam.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.26.</NOTE> If such Persons have performed the Com∣mandment of the Lord, what meaneth then this <HI>Bleating of the Sheep in our Ears, and the lowing of the Oxen which we hear?</HI> So much Clamour and evil Speaking among high Professors?</P>
<P>Nay, my Brethren, this is not a vain and trivial Matter, it ought not to be passed over with such a gentle Rebuke as the Manner of some is, in the cold Language of <HI>Eli to his wicked Sons, Why do ye such Things? Nay, my Sons, for it is no good Report that I hear.</HI> But it was a very bad one, and such an Antichristian Spirit of rash Judging ought to be <HI>rebuked sharply.</HI> For the great Founder of our holy Religion has ex∣presly said, <HI>Judge not.</HI></P>
<P>And now from whence comes such a Spirit of rash Judg∣ing? Cometh it not hence, even of this Lust of Pride? And such as indulge it are in Danger of <HI>falling into the Con∣demnation of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>There has been, of late, much Talk about Religion, and a remarkable Work of GOD in the Country; but it must be remembred, that the <HI>Kingdom of GOD is not in Word but in Power:</HI> And, for my own Part, I have been waiting to see the Work prove it self in the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> and the <HI>ge∣nuine Fruits of the Spirit of GOD, in all Goodness, Righteous∣ness and Truth.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed the unwearied Pains taken by the Friends of the late religious Commotion among us, to perswade People, that GOD has <HI>remerkably revived his Work</HI> in the Land, is so far from being a Confirmation of it, that, in my Opinion, 'tis more apt to bring a Suspicion upon it.</P>
<P>If there be such a happy <HI>Revival of GOD'S Work,</HI> as some <HI>contend earnestly for,</HI> what Need of <HI>calling of Assemblies,</HI> and
<PB N="29" REF="005198_0028_1016E214F689E618"/>so much <HI>Preaching and Writing</HI> to possess the Minds of Peo∣ple with the Belief of it? For the <HI>Work of GOD</HI> will prove itself, by producing a visible and glorious Reformation among the happy Subjects of it, which the <HI>Lord hasten in his Time.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>Let the Ministers of Christ consider what Reason they have to be humbled for the Remainder of Pride in them.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Work of the Ministry be attended with many humbling Circumstances and pressing Difficulties, particularly at this Time; yet have our Hearts, dear Brethren, been truly humbled to this Day? Are we clothed with Humility down to the Foot? Has not Pride, that Root of Bitterness, been springing and operating in us to our Shame? Is not Know∣ledge apt to puff us up, and make us Superstitious and Im∣perious? Ready to lord it over GOD'S Heritage, and make us Busy-bodies in other Men's Matters, or Bishops in another Man's Diocess?</P>
<P>Doth not the empty Applause of Men, serve to exalt us above Measure, and feed the Pride and Vanity of our Minds.</P>
<P>Are we not too apt to spend our precious Time in vain Disputes and Wranglings, instead of studying to profit the Souls of our People both in Word and Doctrine.</P>
<P>Are we patient and penitent when we hear the Defaming of many? Oh let us examine ourselves, and labour to keep under and subdue this dangerous Lust, <HI>Lest that by any Means when we have preached to others, we ourselves should be Cast∣aways.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude with a serious Address, <HI>First,</HI> To my Rev. and dear <HI>Brother,</HI> whose Consecration to God, in the Gospel of his Son, we are now attending. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People of God in this Place.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> Suffer the Exhortation that speaketh to you, as to a <HI>Son and Candidate for holy Orders.</HI> You have heard something of the great and necessary Qualifications of a good Minister of Jesus Christ, and the Danger of admitting unqualified persons to take Part of this Ministry; and I doubt not, but that your Heart is in some good Measure affected with the Sense of the Difficulty and Importance of the Work upon which you are entring.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="005198_0029_1016E1E969C80F68"/>
I have known your <HI>Education, Principles</HI> and <HI>Manner of Life</HI> from your Youth up, and have had a good Taste of your Mi∣nisterial Gifts and Accomplishments, all which, in my Judg∣ment, are so many desirable Qualifications to <HI>perfect you for the Work of the Ministry,</HI> for <HI>the edifying of the Body of Christ.</HI> These Things, being in you and abounding, both free <HI>you from the Imputation of a Novice, and us from the Guilt of puting such an one into the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>But yet, there is Room for Growth; you must Labour to increase in Wisdom and he most useful Learning; but above all Things, <HI>grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> My <HI>Son,</HI> be strong <HI>in the Grace</HI> that is in Christ Jesus. To this End give Attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine, meditate upon these Thing, give thy Self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all, <HI>and in all Things.</HI> Study to shew thy Self approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed, <HI>rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>I do this Day, with sacred Freedom and Pleasure, act the Part you have devolved upon me; (however unequal to it) and in Concurrence with other Pastors and Churches conven'd on this solemn Occasion, join Heart and Hand in seperating you to the Gospel of God. We bring you, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> to this People, and bless you in the Name of the Lord; may the <HI>Lord bless you out of Zion, and have Respect unto your Offering!</HI></P>
<P>You enter <HI>Sir,</HI> upon the Work of the Ministry, in a dark and difficult Time, wherein you will find uncommon Temp∣tations to Unfaithfulness; But be of good Courage, and let none of these Thing move you. Do the Work of a good Minister of Christ, will all Fidelity; and be valiant for the Truth.</P>
<P>And as my Subject leads me to give you this Caution, so I would do it both for your own Safety, and the Safety of pure and undefiled Religion: That is, guard your Pulpit a∣gainst every <HI>Novice;</HI> exclude, if possible, all unqualified Persons from the ministerial Office, <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on</HI> no <HI>Man; be not Partakers of other Men's Sins, keep thy self pure.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, take heed unto thyself, and unto thy Doctrine, con∣tinue in them, for in so doing this, thou shalt both save thy self, and them that hear thee.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="005198_0030_1016E217A0513D38"/>
In the Second Place, <HI>I turn and address my self to the Church and People of God in this Place.</HI> Holy <HI>Brethren,</HI> Partakers of the heavenly Calling, we congratulate you this Day upon the wise Choice, that the glorious Head of the Church has directed you to make of a <HI>Pastor,</HI> whom we trust is after his own Heart, who shall feed you <HI>with Know∣ledge and Understanding,</HI> and so fill up the Breach he has made upon you in the Decease of your late faithful and pious Pastor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr.. <HI>James Hale.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Adore the good Providence of God, Dear Brethren, in find∣ing out, and setting over this Congregation a Man to go in and out before them. May the Lord preserve his going out, and coming in, from this time forth and even for evermore!</P>
<P>And now, lift up your Hearts with your Hands to God in the Heavens to beless this his Servant, and make him a rich Blessing to your own Souls, and the Souls of your Children, yea of the Children that shall be born.</P>
<P>Continue instant in Prayer to God for your Pastor, be kind∣ly affectioned to him, in Honour preferring, esteeming him very highly in Love for his Works sake. Honour and sup∣port him according to his Character; <HI>let no man despise his Youth.</HI></P>
<P>Receive him as a precious Gift of our ascended Jesus, as a Messenger of the Lord of Hosts, and be ye thankful above all Things. Labour to profit under his holy Ministry, and hold fast the faithful word, that his Heart may rejoice, and he may go on his Way and Work rejoicing.</P>
<P><HI>Finally Brethren, Farewel, be perfect, be of good Comfort, be of one Mind, live in Peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you. Amen.</HI></P>
