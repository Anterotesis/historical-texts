<P>THE PRINCIPLES OF ELOQUENCE; ADAPTED TO THE PULPIT AND THE BAR. BY THE ABBE MAURY.</P>

<Q>We must not judge so unfavorably of Eloquence, as to reckon it only a frivolous art, that a declaimer uses to impose upon the weak imagination of the multitude, and to serve his own ends. It is a very serious art; designed to instruct people; suppress their passions and reform their manners; to support the laws; di∣rect public councils, and to make men good and happy. <BIBL>FENELON.</BIBL></Q>

<P>WHATEVER relates to the subject of <HI>Elo∣quence</HI> in general, and to the <HI>Eloquence</HI> of the <HI>Pulpit</HI> in particular has a peculiar claim to be dedicated to one, who, in addition to his other em∣inent qualities, has exhibited, both from the <HI>Pul∣pit</HI> and the <HI>Press,</HI> so distinguished a model of the excellence and commanding influence of this art.</P>
<P><HI>Should this translation, with the accompanying notes and illustrations, chiefly derived from au∣thors of celebrity, serve to promote in the Eng∣lish reader, and particularly in students for the Pulpit or the Bar, an attention to those princi∣ples which may conduce to their future usefulness in life, my utmost wishes will be gratified.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE name of the Abbé MAURY hath be∣come so distinguished not only in France, but also in this and other countries of Eu∣rope, that his literary productions will, pro∣bably, attract a degree of attention corres∣ponding with that, which his public charac∣ter and conduct have excited.</P>
<P>As a member of the Constituting Nation∣al Assembly, it was his lot to step forward at an epoch, which will for ever remain memo∣rable in the annals of France.</P>
<P>IN the midst of those contests and recrim∣inations, which prevailed among the differ∣ent orders of which that assembly was com∣posed, the Abbé MAURY stood forth as the champion of the Church, and of Aristocra∣cy. His eloquence and abilities elevated him to distinguished importance amongst his brethren, while his undaunted spirit acquir∣ed fresh energy from the number, the abili∣ties, and the attacks of his opponents: thus, though repeatedly foiled, yet like an expir∣ing
<PB N="v" REF="032455_0004_0FF26988CD547DA8"/>hero in the field of battle, he was deter∣mined not to yield, but with his latest breath.</P>
<P>His zeal and talents shone conspicuous in this crisis of public affairs; and we are in∣formed, that he hath since received from the hands of his Holiness at Rome, the reward of a strenuous defence of a tottering church.</P>
<P>BUT not only hath the Senate borne wit∣ness to his abilities: the Press, also, super-adds its testimony in various literary produc∣tions.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, the subject of that work, which is here presented in an English dress, appears to have occupied his maturest tho'ts; and the justice and enlargement of his ideas upon this subject mark the success, with which he has pursued it.</P>
<P>To boast of his attaining to originality of thought on a subject, which hath been so frequently and so ably discussed, would, doubtless, be presumptuous: to insinuate that he has written a complete system, would be to contradict his own professions; but, to acknowledge, that he has thrown out a vari∣ety of useful hints, and that in his manner of discussion, he is lively and interesting, is no more than to pay him that tribute, to which his merit may justly lay claim.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="032455_0005_0FF2695D73EF8458"/>
THE following Dissertation is only one of several, which M. MAURY hath given to the public. There are also collected in one vol∣ume <HI>the Panegyrics of</HI> S. LOUIS and of FENE∣LON; <HI>Reflections on the Sermons of</HI> BOSSUET; and <HI>the Panegyric of</HI> S. AUSTIN.</P>
<P>IN these he has discovered the talents of an Orator, particularly in that species of the art stiled <HI>Panegyric,</HI> to which the French have ever shewn more attachment than the English<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A late publication hath since appeared, and been attributed to the Abbé, consisting, chiefly, of speeches delivered by him in the National Assembly.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the work now offered to the public, and which seems the most material for a young speaker to peruse, the Abbé has prescribed those rules, and suggested those observations, by which he appears to have been guided in his own compositions.</P>
<P>IN confirmation of the good opinion, which the translator has conceived of M. MAURY'S performance, he transcribes, with pleasure, the remarks of the MONTHLY REVIEWERS on those discourses, of which the following trans∣lation constitutes the first:</P>
<Q><P>The first of these discourses relates to va∣rious parts of the Eloquence of the Pulpit, and does great honour to the taste, judg∣ment,
<PB N="vii" REF="032455_0006_0FF26A0AB4A49BB8"/>and feelings of the ingenious author. His reflections on CICERO, DEMOSTHENES, BOSSOET, FENELON, TILLOTSON, MASSIL∣LON, BOURDALOUE, SAURIN, BRIDAINE, &amp;c. are sensible and solid; and his pre∣cepts and rules are every way adapted to form the taste of a young Orator to that affecting simplicity, which disdains all friv∣olous ornaments, and has no other object in view than to touch and to persuade.</P>
<P>This discourse is followed by two Ora∣tions that were delivered before the French Academy in honour of St. Louis, and Fenelon; another in honour of St. Augus∣tine, delivered in the General Assembly of the French Clergy; and a piece intituled, Reflections on the Sermons of Bossuet last published." All these are excellent in their kinds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monthly Review,</HI> vol. lvii. p. 309.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>THE testimony of an eminent literary cha∣racter now living, were liberty allowed to transcribe it, and mention his name, would add strength to the foregoing observations.</P>
<P>THE Editor feels himself constrained to apologize for the part he has taken. He began, at first, to peruse and translate Abbé MAURY'S performance <Q>on the Eloquence of the Pulpit and the Bar,</Q> in the course of
<PB N="viii" REF="032455_0007_0FF26A0E94E31390"/>his private studies, and merely with a view to his personal improvement.</P>
<P>SOME elucidations from English authors naturally occurred to his mind, which he has, accordingly, annexed. But it was not till afterwards, and in compliance with the wish of those, whose judgment he respects, that he thought of submitting the whole to public view. He cannot be insensible that imperfections may discover themselves to the eye of rigid criticism; while, at the same time, he would indulge a hope, that the time and pains employed will render this transla∣tion of the Abbé's sentiments not wholly unacceptable to the young student and read∣er, for whose use it is principally designed.</P>
<P>IT will appear, on perusal, that the Abbé MAURY'S predilection for French Preachers and Orators gives a tincture of severity to his censures on the English; and that, in one or two instances, his zeal for the Romish Church embitters his language with regard to the conduct and writings of some Protestants.</P>
<P>EVERY man hath his partialities. For the prejudices of education, country, connexions, great allowances must, and, by every liberal mind, will be made. This is an age of free enquiry; and, in proportion as this spirit prevails, we shall say with the poet,</P>
<Q><PB N="ix" REF="032455_0008_0FF26A148C56A160"/>
<L>—Veniam petimus</L>
<L>Dabimusque vicissim.</L></Q>
<P>FREE liberty must, therefore, be allowed to every reader to judge for himself what de∣gree of regard is to be paid to a few passages, wherein the Abbé gives such an unbounded preference to some of his favourite French Catholic Preachers, above those of the Pro∣testant Church, and the English nation.</P>
<P>To the works of eloquent French writers recommended by M. MAURY, perhaps it will be no discredit to add as a model of Pulpit-Eloquence, the sermons of the late Rev. CHARLES CHAIS, Pastor of the French Church at the Hague.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sermons of the Rev. C. CHAIS were printed in 1790, in two volumes; for a character of which, the reader is referred to the Appendix to the seventy-eighth volume of the Monthly Review, and the Appendix to the third volume enlarged.</NOTE></P>
<P>FOR English authors and preachers, the reader is referred to several of the notes an∣nexed to the following translation.</P>
<P>OF those who have written professedly on the subject of Eloquence, the student may profitably peruse CICERO, QUINTILIAN, and LONGINUS among the ancients; and such modern authors as WARD, GIBBON, FORDYCE, CAMPBELL, BLAIR, and POLWHELE; to which may be added ROLLIN, and FENELON.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRINCIPLES OF ELOQUENCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>Design of this Discourse.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN presenting the public with this feeble production, I propose, with a just diffi∣dence of my own abilities, to lay before them some observations which have occurred to me in the course of my reading, or oratorial compositions, respecting the art of Eloquence, which it is the study of my life to cultivate.</P>
<P>THEY were written at first merely for my own private use. If I have sometimes giv∣en a decided opinion, I intreat the reader to remember that I speak to him with freedom yet without presumption, and that I myself
<PB N="2" REF="032455_0013_0FF26A1DDD69E070"/>am far from considering the result of my observations as laying down rules of the art.</P>
<P>THE general idea which I form, at first view, of the eloquence of the pulpit is this.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>A Description of the Eloquence of the Pulpit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A MAN of sensibility discovers his friend about to take a step contrary to his in∣terest or duty. He is desirous of opposing it, but he is afraid of repelling confidence by a hasty contradiction. He gently insin∣uates himself into his mind. He does not, at first, oppose. He enquires. He is not regarded. He requires only to be heard, and instantly he states his reasons, and offers convincing arguments with modest diffi∣dence.—No answer is returned. He then complains, not of obstinacy, but of silence. He meets all objections and refutes them. Animated by the tender zeal of friendship, he is far from attempting to shine by his wit, or to dishearten by his reproaches. He speaks only the language of affection. At length assured of having arrested the attention of his friend, he uncovers the precipice under his feet, and shews him all its depth, in or∣der
<PB N="3" REF="032455_0014_0FF26A1FD28F01D0"/>to alarm his imagination, that weakest, and yet most predominant of our faculties.</P>
<P>HE thus succeeds in moving him. He now descends to entreaty, and gives an unrestrain∣ed vent to his sighs and tears.—The work is done; the heart yields, and his friend is ful∣ly persuaded. They both embrace; and it is to the eloquence of friendship that reason and virtue are indebted for the honour of victory.</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN ORATORS! behold your model. Let that compassionate man who should be af∣fected with sympathetic tenderness in order to convince, be you; and that friend who should be moved in order to be undeceived, be your auditory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. <HI>Of the Means of persuading a large Assembly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is only necessary, in fact, for the Orator to keep one man in view amidst the mul∣titude that surrounds him; and, excepting those enumerations which require some vari∣ety in order to paint the passions, conditions, and characters, he ought merely, while com∣posing, to address himself to that one man,
<PB N="4" REF="032455_0015_0FF26A25CA2A66D8"/>whose mistakes he laments, and whose foi∣bles he discovers. This man is, to him, as the genius of Socrates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LACTANTIUS observes (<HI>de origine erroris</HI> ii. 14.) that "SO∣CRATES affirmed that there was a demon or tutelar angel constant∣ly near him, which had kept him company from a child, and by whose beck and instruction he guided his life."—See a farther ac∣count in the life of Socrates, <HI>New Biographical Dictionary,</HI> See, also, <HI>Universal History,</HI> vol. i. page 103. and <HI>Turret. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stit. The∣olog</HI> vol. i. p. 616, 617.</NOTE> standing continually at his side, and, by turns, interrogating him, or answering his questions. This is he whom the Orator ought never to lose sight of in writing, till he obtains a conquest over his prepossessions. The arguments which will be sufficiently persuasive to overcome <HI>his</HI> op∣position, will equally controul a large as∣sembly.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>The very aspect of a large assembly, engaged in some de∣bate of moment, and attentive to the discourse of one man, is sufficient to inspire that man with such elevation and warmth, as both gives rise to strong expressions, and gives them propriety. Passion easily rises in a great Assembly, where the movements are communicated by mutual sympathy between the Orator and the Audience.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 54, 4to.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>THE Orator will derive farther advantages from a numerous concourse of people, where all the impressions made at the time will con∣vey the finest triumphs of the art, by form∣ing a species of action and re-action between the auditory and the spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>. It is in this sense that Cicero is right in saying that <Q>no man can be eloquent without a multi∣tude;
<PB N="5" REF="032455_0016_0FF26A298E1B30D8"/>to hear him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Orator sine multitudine audiente eloquens esse non potest,</HI> Bru∣tus 338.</NOTE></Q> The Auditor came to hear a discourse:—the Orator attacks him; accuses him; makes him abashed; addresses him, at one time, as his confident, at another, as his mediator, or his judge. See with what address he unveils his most concealed pas∣sions; with what penetration he shews him his most intimate thoughts: with what en∣ergy he annihilates his best framed excuses!—The culprit repents. Profound attention, consternation, confusion, remorse, all an∣nounce that the orator has penetrated, in his retired meditations, into the recesses of the heart. Then, provided no ill timed sally of wit follow to blunt the strokes of Christian eloquence, there may be in the church two thousand Auditors, yet there will be but one thought, but one opinion: and all those individuals united form that ideal man whom the Orator had in view while composing his discourse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="032455_0017_0FF26A2D50DDD730"/>
<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>Advantages of an Orator's studying himself.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT, you may ask, where is this ideal man, composed of so many different traits, to be found, unless we describe some chimerical being? Where shall we find a phantom like this, singular but not outré, in which every individual may recognize him∣self, although it resembles not any one? Where shall we find him?—In your own heart.—Often retire there. Survey all its re∣cesses. <HI>There,</HI> you may trace both the pleas for those passions which you will have to combat, and the source of those false reason∣ings which you must point out. To be elo∣quent, we must enter within ourselves. The first productions of a young Orator are gen∣erally too far fetched. His mind, always on the stretch, is making continual efforts, with∣out his ever venturing to commit himself to the simplicity of nature, until experience teach him, that, to arrive at the sublime, it is, in fact, less necessary to elevate his imagination, than to be deeply impressed with his subject.</P>
<P>IF you have studied the sacred books; if you have observed men; if you have attend∣ed to writers on morals who serve you instead of Historians; if you have become familiar
<PB N="7" REF="032455_0018_0FF269452FB034C8"/>with the language of Orators; make trial of your Eloquence upon yourself: become, so to speak, the Auditor of your own discours∣es; and thus, by anticipating the effect which they ought to produce, you will ea∣sily deliniate true characters; you will per∣ceive, that, notwithstanding the shades of dif∣ference which distinguish them, all men bear an interior resemblance to one another, and that their vices have an uniformity, because they always proceed either from weakness or interest. In a word, your descriptions will not be indeterminate: and the more tho∣roughly you shall have examined what passes within your own breast, with more ability will you unfold the hearts of others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V. <HI>Of Rhetorical Composition.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE general principles are insufficient. Let us, then, pass on to particulars, and apply the rules of art to the composi∣tion of a discourse.</P>
<P>"IT is an arduous undertaking," says the Roman Orator, <Q>to appear before a nume∣rous assembly which listens to our discus∣sion of the most important subjects, since
<PB N="8" REF="032455_0019_0FF26A31153F8F58"/>there is scarcely any one who will not more nicely and rigidly observe the faults than the beauties of our discourses; for whenever we speak in public, judgment is pronounced upon us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Magnum quoddam est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us atque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nus suscipere atque profiteri se esse, omnibus silentibus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>xi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, magno in co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ventu bominum audiendum.

<P>M. Maury's translation of the former part of the above quota∣tion is periphrastic rather than just. The English translation is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the French, which is also followed in some other quo∣tations.</P></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>INDEED, besides the natural talents which Eloquence requires, and the want of which application never supplies, every Orator, who wishes to give satisfaction to his Auditory, must join to the instruction which he has de∣rived from his preparatory studies, an inti∣mate knowledge of the subject which he pro∣poses to discuss. He must meditate on it for a considerable time in order to perceive all its principles, and to discover all its relations.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>The foundation of all that can be called Eloquence, is good sense and sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thought. Let is be the first study of pub-Speakers in addressing any popular Assembly, to be previously masters of the business on which they are to speak; to be well provided with matter and argument; and to rest upon these the chief stress.

If, at such moments, he would avoid the la∣bour of the memory, he should write as fast as he composes.</P>
<P>WHEN the Orator hath once collected the principal proofs, which are like the materials of the building, he quickly makes himself master of his subject; he already discerns the whole of the discourse through those detach∣ed ideas which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd work, as soon as he directs them to one point.</P>
<P>THIS disposition costs the Orator little; <Q>for the discourse, says Fenelon, is the proposition unfolded, and the proposition is an abstract of the discourse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter on Eloquence, addressed to the French Academy,</HI> p. 180, in <HI>Stevenson's translation.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>

<P>THIS is generally the part which costs much labour, and which very much influences the success of the discourse.</P>

Though the method be not laid down in form, no discourse, of any length, should be without method; that is, every thing should be found in its proper place. Every one who speaks, will find it of the great∣est advantage to himself to have previously arranged his thoughts, and classed under proper heads in his own mind, what he is to deliver.

Genius needs to be guided in its progress, and the curb: which preserves it from wandering re∣strains, by salutary checks, and renders it the greatest service. It is thus that genius becomes strengthened and increased, when it proceeds under the guidance of reason and judgment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The following observations exactly correspond with the sen∣timent of our Author: <Q>Nothing can contribute more towards bringing the powers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to their ultimate perfection, than a severe judgment equal in degree to the genius possessed.

The proper office of judgment in composition, is to compare the ideas which im∣agination collects; to observe their agreement or disagreement, their relations and resemblances; to point out such as are of a homogeneous nature; to mark and reject such as are discordant; and finally, to determine the truth and utility of the inven∣tions or discoveries which are produced by the power of the im∣agination. This faculty is, in all its operations, cool, atten∣tive, and considerate. It canvasses the design, ponders the sen∣timents, examines their propriety and connection, and reviews the whole composition with severe impartiality.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>Of Plans drawn from the Text.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY Orator possessed of original ideas, without ever attempting to astonish, will have new and striking plans, merely by attending to the scope of his own genius.</P>
<P>PLANS are frequently singular and whim∣sical, especially when they are drawn from the text. This irksome restraint scarcely ever succeeds in moral discourses.</P>
<P>MASSILON hath sketched out the division of his sermon on confession, where we find so many beauties in detail, upon a passage in
<PB N="16" REF="032455_0027_0FF269CE66196718"/>the Gospel. He takes for his text that verse of St. John,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, ch. v. verse 3.</NOTE> <HI>There was a multitude of blind, halt, and withered.</HI> MASSILON compares the sinners, who surround the confessionals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">French—<HI>les tribunaux de la penitence.</HI></NOTE> to the sick people who were upon the side of the pool of Jerusalem; and he shews the analo∣gy of those corporeal infirmities with the most usual abuse which renders confessions of no utility.</P>
<P><HI>There were blind people;</HI> defect of know∣ledge in the examination. <HI>There were halt;</HI> insincerity in the confession. <HI>There were im∣potent folk, withered;</HI> want of sorrow in the repentance.</P>
<P>THIS application is doubtless ingenious; but it is too far fetched. The excellent taste of MASSILON only yields this once to the temptation of drawing a very artificial plan from the analysis of his text.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Methinks the censure of Doctor BLAIR applies to this quaint division of Massilon's discourse, when he remarks, that <Q>the de∣fects of most of the French sermons are these: from a mode that prevails among them of taking their texts from the lesson of the day, the connexion of the text with the subject is often unnatural and forced; and their applications of Scripture are fanciful rather than instructive."—He farther remarks, "that their method is stiff and cramped by their practice of dividing their subject al∣ways either into three, or two, main points; and their compo∣sition is in general too diffuse, and consists rather of a very few thoughts spread out, and highly wrought up, than of a rich variety of sentiments. Admitting, however, all these defects, it cannot be denied, that their sermons are formed upon the idea of a persuasive, popular Oration; and therefore, (he adds,) I am of opinion they may be read with benefit.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 119.</BIBL></NOTE></P>

HE has made a happier use of the famous passage, <HI>It is finished,</HI> in his sermon on the Passion. But this interpretation is not his own, it having been previously unfolded in various monastic pieces.</P>
<P>IT appears to me that the method of adapt∣ing the text to the plan can hardly ever be successfully made use of in instructions pure∣ly moral; and that it succeeds much better in mysteries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> les Mystères.</HI> The Author probably means here, the solemn services of the Church, such as feasts, fasts, communions, &amp;c.</NOTE>, in funeral orations and pane∣gyrics, where the text will not suit the dis∣course unless it makes known the subject, and, at least indirectly, comprehends the di∣vision.</P>
<P>IT is easy to find in the holy Scripture verses consonant to the principal idea which we intend to express; and we are always pleased with the Orator for those successful applications which, in some measure, render sacred the plan he hath chosen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>I must confess I always disliked a forced text.

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. <HI>Of the Progression of the Plan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHETHER it be a moral subject that is discussed, or one's talents be exer∣cised upon panegyrics or mysteries, it is al∣ways necessary to observe a specified progres∣sion in the distribution of the plan, in order to impart an increasing force to the points adduced, to give weight to the argument, and energy to the rhetorical movements. It is as rare as it is difficult to render both parts of a sermon equally excellent, because the same resources seldom present themselves to the imagination of the Orator. The lat∣ter, however, ought to excel the former. El∣oquence always declines when it ceases to rise. It is therefore to the second branch of the division that the most persuasive argu∣ments and pathetic sentiments ought to be reserved.</P>
<P>CICERO, whose plan is very distinct in all his Orations, although seldom announced in the exordium, adopts a method very favour∣able to the advancement of his proofs, which obliges him to be surpassing himself con∣tinually by fresh efforts in proportion as he proceeds in the difficulties of his subject.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="032455_0030_0FF26A59CC7D4BD0"/>
OPEN his Orations. He at once denies the fact which is opposed to him; and after∣wards he proves, that, by taking its truth for granted, nothing could thereby be concluded against his client.</P>
<P>I SHALL only quote here two striking ex∣amples of this excellent method.</P>
<P>In defending Archais who had been his preceptor, and of whom he always speaks with the most lively gratitude, Cicero thus divides his Oration; <Q>I shall prove that Ar∣chais is a Roman citizen; and that, if he were not, he would be very deserving to be one.</Q></P>
<P>THE plan of the Oration in favour of Milo is no less forcible. "Milo," says he, <Q>hath not slain Clodius; if he had slain him, he would have done well.</Q> The mind of man cannot reason with more per∣spicuity and energy.</P>
<P>NOR are we to conclude that Cicero pro∣ceeds thus accidentally on some particular occasions. In his "Oratorial divisions," in that charming dialogue where this great man submits to an examination upon this art, by answering all the questions which his son puts to him upon Eloquence, Cicero establishes, as a fixed rule, this manner of dividing the discourse. He says. <Q>It is thus you ought
<PB N="20" REF="032455_0031_0FF26A40883E88E0"/>to reason; you must either deny the fact that meets you, or if you admit it, you must prove that the consequences which your opponent has drawn do not result from it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>endum est ut quod ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>citur factum neges out illud quod factum fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>re neges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vim habere, atqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> id esse quod adver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rious criminetur.</HI> <BIBL>Parag. 29, 101.</BIBL></NOTE>.</Q> I am aware how seldom it is that we can follow this course in our pulpits, where the subjects discussed are not always doubtful, but the more we imitate this me∣thod, the nearer we shall arrive at perfec∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. <HI>Of the Injury Wit does to Eloquence.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO all those rules which art furnishes for conducting the plan of a discourse, we proceed to subjoin a general rule from which Orators, and especially Christian Orators, ought never to swerve.</P>
<P>WHEN such begin their career, the zeal for the salvation of souls which animates them, doth not render them always unmindful of the glory which follows great success. A blind desire to shine and to please is often at
<PB N="21" REF="032455_0032_0FF269717723D840"/>the expence of that substantial honour which might be obtained, were they to give them∣selves up to the pure emotions of piety which so well agree with the sensibility necessary to Eloquence.</P>
<P>IT is unquestionably to be wished that he who devotes himself to the arduous labours which preaching requires, should be wholly ambitious to render himself useful to the cause of religion. To such, reputation can never be a sufficient recompence: But if mo∣tives so pure have not sufficient sway in your breast, calculate, at least, the advantages of self-love, and you may perceive how insepa∣rably connected these are with the success of your ministry.</P>
<P>IS it on your own account that you preach? Is it for you that religion assembles her vota∣ries in a temple? You ought not to indulge so presumptuous a thought. However, I on∣ly consider you as an Orator. Tell me then; what is this you call Eloquence? Is it the wretched trade of imitating that criminal, mentioned by a poet in his satires, who <Q>balanced his crimes before his judges with antitheses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>—<HI>Crimi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a rasis</HI></L>

<PB N="22" REF="032455_0033_0FF26A422A50E6A8"/>of tormenting oneself by tedious stu∣dies in order to reduce sacred instruction in∣to a vain amusement? is this, then, the idea which you have conceived of that divine art which disdains frivolous ornaments, which sways the most numerous assemblies, and which bestows on a single man the most per∣sonal and majestic of all sovereignties? Are you in quest of glory?—You sly from it. Wit alone is never sublime; and it is only by the vehemence of the passions that you can become Eloquent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. HUME judiciously observes that <Q>productions which are merely surprising, without being natural, can never give any lasting entertainment to the mind. . . . Too much orna∣ment is a fault in every kind of production. Uncommon ex∣pressions, strong flashes of wit, pointed similies, and epigram∣matic turns, especially when they recur too frequently, are a disfigurement rather than any embellishment of discourse. As the eye, in surveying a Gothic building, is distracted by the multiplicity of ornaments, and loses the whole by its minute attention to the parts; so the mind in perusing a work over∣stocked with wit, is fatigued and disgusted with the constant en∣deavour to shine and surprize. This is the case where a wri∣ter overabounds in wit, even though that wit, in itself, should be just and agreeable. But it commonly happens to such wri∣ters, that they seek for their favourite ornaments, even where the subject affords them not; and by that means have twenty insipid conceits for one thought which is really beautiful. <BIBL>HUME'S <HI>Essays,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> p. 240, 241.</BIBL></Q>
<P><Q>I like none of those witty turns which have nothing in them that is either solid, natural or affecting, and which tend nei∣ther to convince, nor paint, nor persuade. All such tinsel wit (as that of Isocrates) must appear still more ridiculous when it is applied to grave and serious matters. You ask, will you then allow of no antitheses? Yes, when the things we speak of are naturally opposite one to another, it may be proper enough to shew their opposition. Such antitheses are just, and have a folic beauty, and a right application of them is often the most easy and concise manner of explaining things; but it is extremely childish to use artificial turns and windings to make words cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and play one against another. At first, this may happen to dazzle those who have no taste; but they soon grow weary of such a silly affectation. It looks very strange and aukward in a preacher to set up for wit and delicacy of invention, when he ought to speak with the utmost seriousness and gravity; out of regard to the authority of the Holy Spirit whose words he borrows.</Q> <BIBL>FENE∣LON'S <HI>Dialogues concerning Eloquence,</HI> dial. ii. p. 96, and dial. iii. p. 146.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>To form a just notion of TULLY'S eloquence, we must observe the harangues he made in his more advanced age. Then, the experience he had in the weightiest affairs, the love of liberty, and the fear of those calamities that hung-over his head, made him display the utmost efforts of his eloquence. When he en∣deavoured to support and revive expiring liberty, and to animate the commonwealth against Antony his enemy, you do not see him use points of wit and quaint antitheses: he is then truly eloquent. Every thing seems artless, as it ought to be when one is vehement; with a negligent air he delivers the most natural and affecting sentiments, and says every thing that can move and animate the passions.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Ibid,</HI> dial. ii. p. 54.</BIBL></P>

<P>WIT pleases in an epigram or a song, but it never produces great effects in a numerous assembly. True Eloquence proscribes all those thoughts which are too refined or far-fetched to strike the people; for, indeed, what else is it than a brilliant stroke affecting and enlivening a multitude, which, at first view, merely presents to the Orator in extended and motionless heap, and which so far from participating the sen∣sations of him who speaks, scarcely grants him a cold and strict attention?</P>

THE beginning of a discourse ought to be simple and modest, in order to conciliate to the preacher the good will of his auditory. The Exordium, nevertheless, deserves to be studied with the greatest care. It is proper to confine oneself in this part to the unfold∣ing of a single idea which may include the whole extent of the subject. It is here where indications of the plan should be quickly made known; where the leading aim of the discourse should be pointed out with∣out filling up too much room; where lucid principles should discover the deep reflection of the Orator who is capable of obtaining, at once, a commanding influence, over all his hearers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The first quality of an Exordium is brevity. This, however, has a proper measure, for as it ought not to be excessively long, so neither should it be too short, the middle way is best. If the Exordium were too short, it would oblige the hearer to enter too soon into the matter without preparation enough; and excessive length would weary him; for it is with an auditor, as with a men who visits a palace, he does not like to stay too long in the court, or first avenues, he would only view them transiently with∣out stopping, and proceed as soon as possible to gratify his prin∣cipal curiosity.</Q> <BIBL>ROBINSON'S CLAUDE, vol. ii. p. 469.</BIBL>
<P>M. CLAUDE farther observes that an Exordium should be clear, cool and grave; engaging and agreeable; connected with the text or subject to be discussed; simple and unadorned; not com∣mon, and sometimes figurative: his illustration of these points well deserves perusal. <HI>Ibid,</HI> p. 469—480.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>NO sooner is the subject stated, than we must hasten to define it. This precau∣tion is to be regarded especially in treating on metaphysical subjects, such as Providence, Truth, Conscience, &amp;c.

<P>IT is, nevertheless, necessary strongly to fix the attention of a wandering congregation; and I do not see that we violate the rules of art in surprising the hearer by an unexpected stroke which may draw him off from his own thoughts, provided that this sudden emotion do not beguile his expectation, and that the Orator always proceeds in the enlargement of his subject.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. <HI>Of the Production of Ideas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is this continual propagation of great ideas, by which they are mutually enliv∣ened; it is this art of incessantly advancing in composition that gives strength to Elo∣quence, rapidity to discourse, and the whole interest of dialogue to an uninterrupted suc∣cession of ideas, which, were they disjointed, would produce no effect, but languish and die.</P>
<P>THE progression which imparts increasing strength to each period is the natural repre∣sentation of those transports of soul which should enliven throughout the compositions of the Orator. Hence it follows, that an eloquent writer can only be formed by a fer∣tility and vastness of thought.</P>
<P>DETACHED phrases, superfluous passages, witty comparisons, unprofitable definitions, the affectation of shining or surprising at eve∣ry word the extravagance of genius, these do not enrich but rather impoverish a writer as often as they interrupt his progress.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The thoughts with which good authors embellish their dis∣courses are plain, natural, and intelligible; they are neither af∣fected nor far fetched, and as it were, forced in, in order to make a parade of wit, but always rise out of the subject to be treated of, from which they seem so inseparable, that we cannot think the things could have been otherwise expressed, at the same time that every one imagines he would express them the same way.</Q> <BIBL>ROLLIN'S <HI>Belle Lettres,</HI> vol. ii. chap. iii. § 2, Art. ii. p. 106.</BIBL>

LET, then, the Orator avoid, as most dan∣gerous rocks, those ensnaring sallies which would diminish the impetuosity of his ardour. Without pity on his productions, and with∣out ever regretting the apparent sacrifices which it will cost him, let him, as he proceeds, retrench this heap of flourishes which stifles his Eloquence instead of embellishing it, and which hurries him on forcibly, rather than gracefully, towards his main design.</P>
<P>IF the hearer find himself continually where he was; if he discover the enlargement, the return of the same ideas, or the playing upon words, he is no more transported with the admiration of a vehement Orator; it is a florid declaimer whom he hears without effect. He does not even hear him long. He also, like the Orator, makes idle reflections on every word. He is continually losing sight of the thread of the discourse amidst those di∣gressions
<PB N="31" REF="032455_0042_0FF269C90C009220"/>of the Rhetorician who is aiming to shine while his subject languishes. At length, tired with this redundancy of words, he feels his exhausted attention ready to expire with every breath.</P>
<P>MISTAKEN man of genius! wert thou ac∣quainted with the true method of attaining Eloquence, instead of disgusting thy hearer with thy insipid antitheses, his attention would not be at liberty to be diverted. He would partake of your emotions. He would become all that you mean to describe. He would imagine that he himself could discover the plain and striking arguments which you laid before him, and, in some measure, compose your discourse along with you. His satisfac∣tion would be at its height, as would be your glory. And you would find that it is the delight of him who hears, which always en∣sures the triumph of him who speaks.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>What formed the distinct character of Father MASSILLON'S Eloquence was, that all his strokes aimed directly at the <HI>heart,</HI> so that what was simply reason and proof in others, was feeling, in his mouth. He not only convinced, he affected, moved, and melted his hearers. He did not confine himself to discover only the injustice and unreasonableness of vice; he shewed it in such a hideous and hateful light, that you could no longer suffer your∣self to be under the empire of such a cruel tyrant; you could no longer consider it in any other light than that of a sworn ene∣my of your felicity. Entering into a holy indignation against yourself, you would appear to yourself so blind, so unjust, so miserable, that you would see no other remedy than that of fall∣ing into the arms of virtue. Sermons composed in this taste cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of being heard with extreme attention; every one sees himself in the lively and natural pictures in which the preacher paints the human heart, and discovers its most secret springs of action. Every one imagines the discourse is addressed to him, and thinks the Orator meant him only. Hence the remarkable effects of his instructions: no body after hearing him stopped to praise, or criticise his sermon. Each auditor retired in a pen∣sive silence, with a thoughtful air, downcast eyes, and composed countenance, carrying away the arrow which the Christian Ora∣tor had fastened in his heart. These silent suffrages exceed the loudest applauses. When Father Massillon had preached his first advent at Versailles, Louis XIV. said these remarkable words to him, <HI>Father, I have heard many fine Orators in my cha∣pel, and have been much pleased with them; but as for you, always when I have heard you, I have been very much displeased with my∣self.</HI> A finished encomium, which does equal honour to the taste and piety of the monarch, and the talents of the preacher.</Q>
<BIBL><HI>Preface to</HI> MASSILLON'S <HI>Sermons.</HI></BIBL>
<P>As a confirmation of this account of Massillon's Eloquence, Vol∣taire tells us that when he was preaching that sermon entitled "the small number of the elect," and which he considers as equal to any thing of which either ancient or modern times can boast, towards the close of the discourse the whole Assembly were mov∣ed; by a sort of involuntary motion they started up from their seats; and such indications of surprise and acclamations were manifested as disconcerted the Speaker, while they imparted an increased effect to the discourse.</P>

"A GOOD judge of the art of Oratory," says CICERO, <Q>need not hear an Orator in order to judge of his merits. He passes on; he observes the judges conversing to∣gether—restless on their seats—frequently enquiring in the middle of a pleading whether it be not time to close the trial and break up the court.

<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE, however, that I have of∣ten admired Advocates indifferent enough in other respects, who possessed, in the highest degree, the valuable talent of arranging their proofs methodically, and of imparting pro∣gressive energy to the reasoning. This kind of merit, as usual at the Bar as it is scarce every where else, is also much less remarked there; whether it be reserved to gentlemen of the profession to be thoroughly sensible of its value in the opening of a cause; or whether it be that arguments becoming more gradually forcible in juridical discussions, an adherence to the natural order is sufficient for the pleader to state them to advantage.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The best advice," says M.

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. <HI>Of Cicero.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT would be a vain attempt to excuse the distance so perceptible between the Ad∣vocates of the French Bar, and the Orators of the Roman Senate, by suggesting the differ∣ent interests which were entrusted to them. Cicero, I know, has sometimes had the glory of being styled "the Defender of the Repub∣lic:" But did he not often undertake causes of less importance? and are not most of his Orations devoted to the affairs of his fellow-citizens? This great man wanted not an ex∣traordinary Auditory in order to display all the riches of his genius. He was more elo∣quent when he pleaded before the Roman people, than when he spoke in the presence of Caesar.</P>
<P>HIS Oration for Ligarius is written in a charming style; but it is not considered as the most eloquent of his works. Cicero re∣quests the life of Ligarius of an usurper, as if he were imploring the clemency of a lawful sovereign. The commendations which he lavishes on Caesar in the ingenious conclusion of his speech, seem to justify the reproaches which he received from the stoic Brutus, after
<PB N="40" REF="032455_0051_0FF26A6E6C4C7828"/>the death of the Dictator, in that famous let∣ter where Brutus accuses him of flattering Oc∣tavius, and which is justly ranked amongst the chief productions of antiquity.</P>
<P>IT is in his Orations against Verres; against Cataline; in his second Philippic; in the conclusions of all his speeches; it is in his treatises of "the Orator," and "of illustrious Orators," that we find the Eloquence of Cicero. All his writings ought to be the manual of Christian Orators.</P>
<P>THE rapidity with which he composed his immortal discourses, notwithstanding the mul∣tiplicity and importance of the concerns which oppressed him, did not prevent him from be∣stowing on his style a perfection so uncom∣mon, that it is as easy to understand his Ora∣tions, as it is difficult, and perhaps even im∣possible to translate them well. His example evidently proves that our Advocates should not justify their inattention to Elocution by the inevitable avocations of their profession.</P>
<P>IT was during a very short interval, and amidst the agitation of a civil war, that Cicero published his famous Orations against Marc Antony, which he called his Philippics.</P>
<P>WE are at a loss to conceive how he could retain sufficient freedom of mind, after the death of Caesar, and in the sixty-fourth and last year of his life, to compose those fourteen

<P>BRUTUS, whose taste was as severe as were his morals, openly disapproved, in the writ∣ings of the Roman Orator, of this inexhausti∣ble exuberance, this copiousness, always ele∣gant and harmonious, which sometimes, per∣haps, enervated his vigour; and the told Cicero himself that his Eloquence wanted reins.

<P>CICERO, as an Orato, is thus characterized by Dr. BLAIR: <Q>In all his orations there is high art. He begins generally with a regular exordium; and with much preparation and insinuation prepossesses the hearers, and studies to gain their affections. His method is clear, and his arguments are arranged with great pro∣priety. His method is indeed more clear than that of Demost∣henes, and this is one advantage which he has over him: we find every thing in its proper place. He never attempts to more till he has endeavoured to convince; and in moving, especially the softer passions, he is very successful. No man that ever wrote, knew the power and force of words better than Cicero. He rolls them along with the greatest beauty and pomp; and, in the structure of his sentences, is curious and exact to the high∣est degree. He is always full and flowing, never abrupt. He is a great amplifier of every subject; magnificent, and in his sen∣timents, highly moral. Though his manner i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the whole, diffuse, yet it is often happily varied, and suited to the subject. When a great public object abused his mind, and demanded in∣dignation and force, he departs considerably from that loose and declamatory manner to which he inclines at other times, and becomes exceedingly cogent and vehement.... This great Orator, however, is not without his defects. In most of his orations there is too much art, even carried to the length of ostentation. He seems often to aim at obtaining admiration, rather than at ope∣rating conviction. Hence, on some occasions, he is shewy rather than solid; and diffuse, where he ought to have been pressing. His sentences are, at all times, round and sonorous; they can∣not be accused of monotony, for they possess variety of cadence; but from too great a study of magnificence, he is sometimes de∣ficient in strength. Though the services which he had perform∣ed to his country were very considerable, yet he is too much his own panegyrist. Ancient manners which imposed fewer re∣straints on the side of decorum, may, in some degree, excuse, but cannot entirely justify his vanity.</Q></P>

IT is not, surely, to be ascribed to any principle of taste, but to the fear of displeas∣ing Augustus, who had shamefully sacrificed his benefactor Cicero, that Virgil and Horace were cowardly enough never to make mention in their poetry of this Orator, as celebrated in the present day as is Rome itself. Virgil, especially, ought not to have forgotten him when celebrating the privileges of the Roman people.

These two Orators hold nearly an equal rank.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The opinions of learned men, have indeed been various, as M.

<P>LONGINUS, also, draws the following comparison on this subject, when he says to this effect: <Q>My dear Tereatianus, Cicero him∣self differs not in any respect more than in what I have men∣tioned, from Demosthenes Demosthenes is concisely, Cicero is diffusely, sublime. Demosthenes, who burns and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down all before him with an irresistible violence, rapidity, strength and fury, may be compared to an hurricane or a thunderbolt: but Cicero's Eloquence, I apprehend, resembles some overwhelming conflagration, that spreads and destroys all before it, retains an intense and inextinguishable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, breaks out in different forms in different places, and is nourished by inexhaustible supplies of fuel.</Q></P>
<P>FENELON <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judgment with Quintilian: <Q>I will go farther, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not afraid to say that I think Demosthenes a greater Orator than Cicero. I protest there is no man admires Cicero more than I do. He embellishes every thing he handles. He is an honour to speech; and makes that happy use of words that no on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> else could. He has a vast variety of wit. He is even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and vehement when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be so against Ca∣taline, V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But we may perceive some finery in his discourses. His art is wonderful; but still we discern it. While he is concerned for the safety of the republic, he does not forget that he is an Orator, nor does he let others forget it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>DEMOSTHENES <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> transported, and to have nothing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> naturally falls into it without reflecting. He in above admira∣tion. He uses speech, as a modest man does his clothes, only to cover himself. He thunders; he lightens; he is like a torrent that hurries every thing along with it. We cannot criticize him, for he is master of our passions. We consider the things he says, and not his words. We lose sight of him: we think of Philip only who usurps every thing. I am charmed with these two Orators; but I confess that Tully's prodigious art and mag∣nificent Eloquence affect me less than the vehement simplicity of Demosthenes.</Q></P>

<P>M. ROLLIN, remarking on this passage, says, <Q>These reflec∣tions of the Abp. are extremely rational and judicious; and the closer we examine his opinion, the more we find it conformable to good sense, right reason, and the most exact rules of true rhe∣toric. But whoever would take upon him to prefer Demosthe∣nes' Orations to those of Cicero, ought, in my opinion, to possess pretty near as much solidity, force, and elevation of mind, as Demosthenes must have had to compose them. Whether it be owing to an old prepossession in favour of an author we have con∣stantly read from our tender years; or that we are accustomed to a style which agrees more with our manners, and is more adap∣ted to our capacities, we cannot be persuaded to prefer the severe austerity of Demosthenes to the insinuating softness of Cicero; and we chuse to follow our own inclination and taste for an au∣thor who is, in some measure, our friend and acquaintance, rath∣er than to declare, upon the credit of another, in favour of one that is almost a stranger to us.</Q></P> <BIBL>ROLLIN'S <HI>Belle Lettres,</HI> vol. ii. ch. iii. §. 3. p. 261.</BIBL>
<P>Mr. HUME joins with those critics who give the preference to Demosthenes. Speaking of the charms of Cicero's Eloquence, he says, <Q>Some objections I own, notwithstanding his vast success, may lie against some passages of the Roman Orator. He is too florid and rhetorical; his figures are too striking and palpable; the divisions of his discourse are drawn chiefly from the rules of the schools; and his wit disdains not always the artifice even of pun, a rhyme, or jingle of words. The Grecian addressed him∣self to an Audience much less refined than the Roman Senate or Judges. The lowest vulgar of Athens were his sovereigns, and the arbiters of his Eloquence. Yet is his manner more chaste and austere than that of the other. Could it be copied, its suc∣cess would be infallible over a modern Assembly. It is rapid harmony, exactly adjusted to the sense: it is vehement reason∣ing, without any appearance of art: it is disdain, anger, bold∣ness, freedom, involved in a continued stream of argument. And of all human productions, the Orations of Demosthenes present to us the models which approach the nearest to perfection.</Q></P>

<P>Mr. KNOX observes, that <Q>Many critics have employed their talents in making comparisons between Demosthenes and Tully.</Q> <Q>All of them agree in attributing to the former conciseness, and to the latter diffusion: and, according to this judgment, they have not hesitated to give the preference to the Athenian. The concise vehemence of Demosthenes carried all before it by vio∣lence; the prolixity of Cicero gained ground by the soft arts of insinuation. The effect of the former was sudden and irresisti∣ble; that of the latter, comparatively weak and dilatory.</Q></P>

<P>Dr. BLAIR shall bring up the rear in the list of those critics who have compared Cicero and Demosthenes. <Q>The character of the latter is vigour and austerity; that of Cicero is gentleness and insinuation.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hath an unquestionable advantage over his rival in literature and philosophy, but he hath not wrested from him the sceptre of Eloquence. He himself regarded Demost∣henes
<PB N="45" REF="032455_0056_0FF269DFCCEAC340"/>as his master. He praised him with all the enthusiasm of the liveliest imagination. He translated his works; and, if his transla∣tions had reached us, it is probable, that
<PB N="46" REF="032455_0057_0FF269C15E3D12D8"/>Cicero would have placed himself forever below Demosthenes.</P>
<P>IT is the irrefragable force of the reasoning; it is the irresistible rapidity of the rhetorical movements, which characterize the Eloquence of the Athenian Orator. When he writes, it is to give strength, energy, and vehemence to his thoughts. He speaks, not as an elegant writer who wishes to be admired, but as a passionate man tormented by truth; as a citi∣zen
<PB N="47" REF="032455_0058_0FF269C312EED510"/>menaced with the greatest misfortunes, and who can no longer contain the transports of his indignation against the enemies of his country.</P>
<P>HE is the champion of Reason. He de∣fends her with all the strength of his genius: and the rostrum where he speaks becomes the place of combat. He at once conquers his auditors, his adversaries, his judges. He does not seem to endeavour to move you: hear him, however, and he shall cause you to weep upon reflection. He overwhelms his fellow citizens with reproaches; but, then, these are only the interpreters of their own remorse.</P>
<P>DOTH he refute an argument? He does not discuss it. He proposes a single question for the whole answer, and the objection no longer appears.</P>
<P>DOTH he wish to stir up the Athenians against Philip? It is no more an Orator who speaks: it is a General; it is a King; it is a Prophet; it is the Tutelar Angel of his country. And when he threatens his fellow citizens with slavery, we think that we hear from a distance the noise approaching of the rattling chains which the tyrant is bringing them.</P>
<P>THE Philippics of Demosthenes, and his famous Oration "pro corona," in favour of
<PB N="48" REF="032455_0059_0FF269981E370FC8"/>Ctesiphon, are justly admired; but I appre∣hend that the learned, and Christian Orators read but little of his other works; his dis∣course on the peace, his first and second Olynthiac, his Oration of Chersonesus, and many other masterly productions truly wor∣thy of his genius. In these too much for∣gotten writings, and which seem to be of no service to the reputation of Demosthenes, we might be able to find sufficient claims to jus∣tify his fame, were all his other productions of Oratory unknown.</P>
<P>IT is enough to repeat here one single pas∣sage.—</P>
<P>THE enemies of Demosthenes, (certain wri∣ters without talents, Aeschines excepted, who presumed to consider themselves as his rivals because they set themselves up for Orators in Athens,) accused him of seeking, in his dis∣courses, rather his own reputation, than the public good. This great man, abused for a long while without complaining, deigned at length to confute their clamours in the pre∣sence of all the Athenian people. He thus addresses them in his Oration of Chersonesus:</P>
<P><Q>I AM so far from regarding all those con∣temptible Orators as citizens deserving of their country, that, should any one say to me this moment, And thou, Demosthenes, what services hast thou rendered to the<PB N="49" REF="032455_0060_0FF269AD8D48D548"/>Republic? I would neither, O Athenians, speak of the expenses I have incurred on behalf of my fellow-citizens in the dis∣charge of my employments, nor of the cap∣tives whom I have redeemed, nor of the gifts which I have presented to the city, nor of all the monuments which will one day testify my zeal for my country; but this is the answer I should make: My con∣duct hath always been the reverse of the maxims of these Orators. I could, doubt∣less, have followed their example, and like them, have flattered you. But I have al∣ways sacrificed my personal advantage, my ambition, and even the desire of pleasing you. I have addressed you so as to rank myself below other citizens, and to exalt you above the other people of Greece. O Athenians! permit me now to bear this witness of myself. No; I never indulged the expectation of attaining the first place among you, were I even to make you the lowest of mankind.</Q></P>
<P>IT is to those enemies, and to the sad ne∣cessity of crushing them with all the weight of his genius and virtue, that Demosthenes is indebted for this sublime passage, one of the finest strokes of his Eloquence.</P>
<P>IT would be very easy to multiply similar quotations, when speaking of this Orator.
<PB N="50" REF="032455_0061_0FF26A701D1E5880"/>But it, is not my design to prevent public speakers from reading him.

Is Demosthenes an Orator who amuses himself barely with tickling the ear, by the sound and harmony of periods; or does he impose upon the mind by a florid style and snining thoughts? Such Eloquence may, indeed, dazzle and charm, the moment we hear it; but the impression it makes is of a short duration. What we admire in Demosthenes, is the plan, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e series, and the order and disposition of the Oration; it is the strength of the proofs, the solidity of the argument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the grandeur and nobleness of the sentiments, and of the style; the vivicity of the turns and figures; in a word, the wonderful art of repre∣senting the subjects he treats, in all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustre, and displaying them in all their strength. But that which distinguishes De∣mosthenes still more, and in which no one has imitated him, is, that he forgets-himself so entirely; is always so scrupulous in avoiding every thing that might look like a shew or parade of wit and genius; and so careful to make the Auditor attend to the cause, and not to the Orator, that no exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession, turn or thought, ever escape him, which are calculated merely to shine. This reservedness, this moderation, in so fine a genius as Demosthenes, and in topics so susceptible of graces and elegance, raises his merit to its highest pitch, and is superior to all encomiums.</Q></P>

<P>Dr. BLAIR makes the following remarks on the style of Demost∣henes: <Q>His Orations are strongly animated; and full of the im∣petuosity and fire of public spirit. They proceed in a continued strain of inductions, consequences, and demonstrations founded on sound reason. The figures which he uses are never sought after; but always rise from the subject. He employs them sparingly indeed; for splendour and ornament are not the dis∣tinctions of this Orator's composition. It is an energy of thought peculiar to himself, which forms his character, and sets him above all others. He attends much more to things than to words. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arget the Orator, and think of the business. He warms the mind, and impels to action. He has no parade and ostentation; no methods of insinuation; no laboured introductions; but is like a man full of his subject, who, after preparing his audience by a sentence or two for hearing plain truths, enters directly on busi∣ness.... The style of Demosthenes is strong and concise, though sometimes, it must not be dissembled, harsh and abrupt, His words are very expressive; his arrangement is firm and manly; and far from being unmusical. Negligent of lesser graces, he seems rather to have aimed at that sublime which lies in senti∣ment. His action and pronunciation are recorded to have been uncommonly vehement and ardent; which, from the manner of his composition, we are naturally led to believe. The character which one forms of him, from reading his works, is of the austere, rather than the gentle kind. He is, on every occasion, grave, serious, passionate; takes every thing on a high tone; never lets himself down, not attempts any thing like pleasantry. If any fault can be found to his admirable Eloquence, it is, that he sometimes borders on the hard and dry. He may also be thought to want smoothness and grace. But these defects are far more than compensated, by that admirable and masterly force of mas∣culine Eloquence, which, as it overpowered all who heard it, cannot, at this day, be read without emotion.</Q></P>

<P>AT the very name of Demosthenes, my admiration reflects on the most eloquent man of my nation, who bears the greatest refemblance to him of all his competitors.

<PB N="53" REF="032455_0064_0FF2696770B34900"/>A Writer, who frames for himself a language as new as his ideas; who imparts to his ex∣pressions such a character of energy, that the reader supposes he hears him; and gives to his style such a majesty of elocution, that the idiom he makes use of seems to transform and improve itself under his pen.... An Apostle, who instructs the world, whilst celebrating the most illustrious of his contemporaries, making them become, even from their graves, the Preachers of all ages; who, in bewail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the death of one single man, clearly shews the vanity of mankind.

<P>BOSSUET fixed the boundaries of the art in the funeral Oration: and it is a singularity worthy of being remarked, that, at the age of fifty-eight, he finished his rhetorical labours by his master-piece, the panegyric of the great Condé.</P>
<P>I SHALL say nothing here of his sermons. I have borne sufficient testimony elsewhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Abbé refers to a separate dissertation of his, entituled, "Reflexions sur les Sermo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x de M.

<P>Bishop ATTERBURY, during his exile in France, and in the course of his epistolary correspondence with his friends in England, expresses his opinion of Bossuet in the following strong terms: <Q>Of what I have read since I came on this side of the water, I have conceived a much greater opinion of the Bishop of Meaux, than I had while in England, and give him readily the prefer∣ence of all those writers of the Church of France, with which I am acquainted. He is an universal genius, and manages every thing he takes in hand, like a master. Good sense and sound reflections attend all he says; which is expressed in the most agreeable and beautiful manner, without any of the pomp <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int of false Oratory. He has particularly the secret of know∣ing not only what to say, but what not to say; the hardeft task even of the most exact and excellent writer!

In another letter, he says, The more I read of the Bishop of Meaux, the more I value him as a great and able writer, and particularly for that talent of taking as many advantages of an adversary, and giving him as few, as any man, I believe, that ever entered the lists of controversy. There is a serio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s warmth in all he says, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is manner of saying it is noble and moving.</Q></P>

<PB N="55" REF="032455_0066_0FF269E171FD2E20"/>to the lively admiration which they have ex∣cited in me; and I take pleasure in renewing the declaration, because I love always to re∣vive the homage which is due to genius.</P>
<P>BEFORE him, Maillard, Menot, Corenus, Valladier, and a multitude of other French Preachers, whose names, at this day, are ob∣scure or ridiculous, had disgraced the Elo∣quence of the Pulpit by a wretched style, a barbarous erudition, a preposterous mytholo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, low buffoonery, and, even sometimes, by obscene details.</P>
<P>BOSSUET appeared. Accustomed to find himself engaged in controversy, he was, per∣haps, indebted to the critical observations of the Protestants, who narrowly watched him, for that elovated strain, that strength of rea∣soning, that union of Logic and Eloquence, which distinguished all his discourses.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032455_0067_0FF269D83B1B68A0"/>
Do you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh to know the revolution which he affected in the pulpit? Open the writings of Bourdaloue, of whom he was the forerun∣ner and model. Yes; Bossuet never appears to me greater than when I read Bourdaloue, who, twenty years afterwards, entered this new road, where he had the skill to shew himself an original by imitating him, and in which he surpassed him in labour, without being capable of equalling him in genius.</P>
<P>Do you wish to select in more remote times another object of comparison? Place Bossuet among the most illustrious Orators of the fixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Com∣pare the discourse which he delivered on the day of the opening of the famous Assembly of the Clergy in 1682,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOSSUET's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mon, on this occasion, was preached from Num xxiv. 5, "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!"

You would imagine that between the Bishop of Bitonto, and the Bishop of Meaux, there had elapsed an interval of many ages. There is not, how∣ever, the difference of a century and a half. But these two periods, so near to each other,
<PB N="57" REF="032455_0068_0FF2699DBABF4E80"/>are divided by all the distance which removes the grossest barbarism from the most refined taste.</P>
<P>WE have in the edition of the Council of Trent, published at Louvaine in 1567, all the sermons which were delivered in the different sessions, before that Assembly. There are some funeral Orations, and more than thirty other discourses, which were preached by the Bishops, by the Doctors of the Faculty of Paris, or by the Monks. That of the Bishop of Bitonto is the only one which hath retained some celebrity; and as it is evidently the best of all, it is by this piece that we are enabled to judge of the Eloquence of the sixteenth century.</P>
<P>THIS sermon contains some beauties of Oratory; but it is written without method, or taste, and sometimes presents an indecent mixture of sacred scripture and heathen my∣thology.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. <HI>Of Interrogation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TIME, that destroyer of ill-founded repu∣tation, adds, every day, fresh lustre to the glory of Bossuet. I observe, with plea∣sure, that this great Orator, whose merit hath been for some time attacked among us, is more warmly and universally admired since there has been a renunciation of the depraved taste of the Eloquence of words. The vehe∣mence
<PB N="59" REF="032455_0070_0FF26AA8F09DE088"/>which distinguishes him, as it does Demosthenes, appears to me frequently de∣rived from accumulated interrogations which are equally familiar to each of them.</P>
<P>INDEED, of all the figures of Oratory, Interrogation is the most overwhelming and rapid. If it be employed in unfolding the principles on which the discourse is establish∣ed, it spreads over it an inevitable obscurity, and a species of declamation, which disgusts persons of good taste. It is after a clear ex∣planation of the obligations of the Christian Religion, that particular details of its moral injunctions, enlivened by this impetuous movement, forcibly strike the hearers, add remorse to conviction, and, if I may so speak, arm law against conscience. It is by earnest and repeated interrogations, that the Orator proves and attacks, accuses and answers, doubts and affirms, affects and instructs. Is there, in Eloquence, a surer way to agitate the human heart, than by such questions fol∣lowing one another in rapid succession, to which there is no need of waiting for an an∣swer, because that is unavoidable and uni∣form? Can we better manage the pride of the guilty, than by sparing him the disgrace of a direct reproach, at the very time we are in∣forming him of his foibles or his vices? Or say—how can we impart more force to truth,
<PB N="60" REF="032455_0071_0FF26A8051869A50"/>more weight to reason, than by confining ourselves to the simple privilege of interro∣gating the wicked? By what means can such an one elude the Orator, who shuts up all the avenues by which he endeavours to escape from himself? An Orator, who makes choice of him as judge, as sole judge, as the private judge, of the recesses of his own heart only, which he cannot mistake? What answer will he return, if the general questions, which be himself converts into so many personal accu∣sations, rush upon him, and gather strength? If, to these evidences overwhelming to the sinner, there follows a sublime and striking representation, which terrifies his imagina∣tion, and causes his thoughts to be greatly confused? Thus resembling a solemn sen∣tence, which the judge proceeds to pronounce upon the guilty, after having first confound∣ed him.</P>
<P>SUCH is that sublime and famous Apostro∣phe, which MASSILLON addresses to the Su∣preme Being, in his sermon, "on the small number of the elect:" "O God! where are thine elect?" These words, so plain, spread consternation. Each hearer places himself in that list of reprobates which had preceded this passage. He dares no more reply to the Orator, who had, again and again, demanded of him, if he were of the number of the right∣eous,
<PB N="61" REF="032455_0072_0FF269AF528D34E0"/>whose names alone shall be written in the book of life; but, entering with conster∣nation into his own heart, which speaks suf∣ficiently plain by its compunctions, he then imagines that he hears the irrevocable decree of his reprobation.</P>
<P>THE eloquent RACINE almost always pro∣ceeds by interrogations, in impassioned scenes; and this figure, which gives such an ardent rapidity to his style, animates and warms all his arguments, none of which are ever cold, slat, or abstracted.</P>
<P>THE success of this oratorical figure is in∣fallible in Eloquence, when it is properly em∣ployed. It is the natural language of a soul deeply affected. If you wish to see an ex∣ample of it, a famous one now occurs to me.</P>
<P>EVERY one knows that sine introduction of CICERO, who, unable to express the lively indignation of his patriotic zeal, rushes abrupt∣ly upon Cataline, and instantly overwhelms him by the vehemence of his interrogations. <Q>How long, O Cataline, wilt thou abuse our patience? How long shall we continue to be the objects of thy fury? Whither will thy headstrong audacity impel thee?

<P>HERE is Eloquence! here is nature! It it by his making use of such language, that the Orator dives to the very bottom of the human heart.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"Interrogations," says Dr. BLAIR, <Q>are passionate figures. They are, indeed, on so many occasions, the native language of passion, that their use is extremely frequent; and, in ordinary conversation, when men are heated, they prevail as much as in the most sublime Oratory. The unfigured literal use of Inter∣rogation is to ask a question; but when men are prompted by passion, whatever they would affirm, or deny, with great vehe∣mence, they naturally put in the form of a question; expressing thereby the strongest confidence of the truth of their own senti∣ment, and appealing to their hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers for the impossibility of the contrary. Thus, in Scripture; 'God is not a man that he should He, neither the son of man that he should repent. Hath he said? And shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken? And shall he not make it good?' (<HI>Numbers</HI> xxiii. 19.) So Demosthenes, address∣ing himself to the Athenians; 'Tell me, will you still go about and ask one another, what news? What can be more astonishing news than this, that the man of Macedon makes war upon the Athenians, and disposes of the affairs of Greece? Is Philip dead? No, but he is sick. What signifies it to you whether he be dead or alive? For, if any thing happens to this Philip, you will im∣mediately raise up another.' All this, delivered without inter∣rogation, had been faint and ineffectual; but the warmth and eagerness which this questioning method expresses, awaken the hearers, and strike them with much greater force.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures.</HI> vol. i. p. 355, 356.</BIBL>
<P><Q>Much to the same purpose we may add those sublime interro∣gations in the book of Job, where the Almighty is himself the Speaker; and that in the eleventh chapter of the same poem: Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is high as heaven, what canst then do? deeper than hell, what canst thou know? All the energy of this passage would be lost if once divested of the interrogations; should it be said, Thou canst not by searching find out God: Thou canst not find out the Almighty unto perfection: it is high as heaven, and thou canst do nothing; and it is deep as hell, and thou canst know nothing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Another very happy illustration of the force of this figure may be brought from the speech of St. PAUL, (<HI>Acts</HI> xxvi.) where, with astonishing effect, he transfers his discourse from Festus to Agrippa. In verse 26 he speaks of him in the third person? The King, says he, 'knows of those things, before whom also I speak freely.' He then turns abruptly upon him: 'King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets?' And immediately answers his own question: 'I know that thou believest.' The smooth∣est Eloquence, (says Mr. Smith,) the most insinuating complai∣sance, could never have made such an impression upon Agrippa as this unexpected and pathetic address.</Q> <BIBL>SMITH'S <HI>Longinus,</HI> p. 93.</BIBL></P>

<P>M. BRIDAINE, the man, who, in the pre∣sent age, is the most justly celebrated in this way, was born with a popular Eloquence, abounding with metaphorical and striking

In all he said, there were observable unexpected strokes of Orato∣ry, the boldest metaphors, thoughts sudden, new, and striking, all the marks of a rich im∣agination, some passages, sometimes even whole discourses, composed with care, and written with an equal combination of taste and animation.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER to have heard him deliver the introduction of the first discourse which he preached in the Church of St. Sulpice, in 1751. The first company in the capital went, out of curiosity, to hear him.</P>
<P>BRIDAINE perceived among the congrega∣tion many Bishops, and persons of the first rank, as well as a vast number of ecclesiastics. This sight, far from intimidating, suggested to him the following exordium, so far at least as my memory remains, of a passage, with which I have been always sensibly affected, and, which, perhaps, will not appear unwor∣thy of Bossuet, or Demosthenes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="032455_0077_0FF26A81FB0567D0"/>
<Q>AT the sight of an Auditory so new to me, methinks, my brethren, I ought only to open my mouth to solicit your favour in behalf of a poor missionary, destitute of all those talents which you require of those who speak to you about your salvation. Nevertheless, I experience to-day, a feeling very different. And, if I am cast down, suspect me not of being depressed by the wretchech uncasiness occasioned by vanity, as if I were accustomed to preach myself. God forbid that a minister of Heaven should ever suppose he needed an excuse with you! for, whoever ye may be, ye are all of you sinners like myself. It is before your God and mine, that I feel myself impelled at this moment to strike my breast. UNTIL now, I have proclaimed the right∣eousness of the Most High in Churches covered with thatch. I have preached the rigours of penance to the unfortunate who wanted bread. I have declared to the good inhabitants of the country the most awful truths of my religion. Unhappy man! what have I done? I have made sad the poor, the best friends of my God! I have conveyed terror and grief into those simple and honest souls, whom I ought to have pitied and consoled! It is here only where I behold the great, the rich, the op∣pressors
<PB N="67" REF="032455_0078_0FF26AB0A8019F78"/>of suffering humanity, or sinners daring and hardened. Ah! it is here only where the sacred word should be made to resound with all the force of its thunder; and where I should place with me in this pulpit, on the one side, Death which threat∣ens you, and on the other, my great God, who is about to judge you. I hold to-day your sentence in my hand. Tremble then in my presence, ye proud and disdainful men who hear me! The necessity of salva∣tion, the certainty of death, the uncertainty of that hour, so terrifying to you, final im∣penitence, the just judgment, the number of the elect, hell, and above all, Eternity! Eter∣nity! These are the subjects upon which I am come to discourse, and which I ought, doubt∣less, to have reserved for you alone. Ah! what need have I of your commendation, which, perhaps, might damn me, without saving you? God is about to rouse you, while his unworthy minister speaks to you! for I have had a long experience of his mercies. Penetrated with a detestation of your past iniquities, and shedding tears of sorrow and repentance, you will, then, throw your∣selves into my arms; and, by this remorse, you will prove that I am sufficiently elo∣quent.</Q></P>
<P>WHO doth not, by this time, perceive, how much this Eloquence excels the frigid
<PB N="68" REF="032455_0079_0FF269B942A05148"/>and miserable pretensions of modern wit? In apologizing, so to speak, for having preached upon hell in the villages, Bridaine boldly assumed all the authority over his auditory, which belonged to his office, and prepared their hearts for the awful truths, which he intended to announce. This Exordium alone gave him a right to say every thing. Many persons still remember his sermon on Eterni∣ty, and the terror which he diffused through∣out the congregation, whilst blending, as was usual with him, quaint comparisons with sub∣lime transports, he exclaimed, <Q>What foun∣dation, my brethren, have you for suppos∣ing your dying day at such a distance? Is it your youth? 'Yes', you answer; 'I am, as yet, but twenty, but thirty'. Sirs, it is not you who are twenty or thirty years old, it is death which has already advanced twenty or thirty years towards you. Ob∣serve: Eternity approaches. Do you know what this Eternity is? It is a pendulum whose vibration says continually, Always —Ever—Ever—Always—Always! In the mean while, a reprobate cries out, 'What o'clock is it? And the same voice answers, Eternity.</Q></P>
<P>THE thundering voice of Bridaine, added, on those occasions, a new energy to his Elo∣quence; and the Auditory, familiarized to
<PB N="69" REF="032455_0080_0FF2697B1621E4C0"/>his language and ideas, appeared at such times in dismay before him. The profound silence which reigned in the congregation, especially when he preached until the ap∣proach of night, was interrupted from time to time, and in a manner very perceptible, by the long and mournful sighs, which proceed∣ed, all at once, from every corner of the Church where he was speaking.</P>
<P>ORATORS! ye who are wholly engrossed about your own reputation, fall at the feet of this apostolic man, and learn from a mission∣ary, wherein true Eloquence consists.

<HEAD>SECTION XIX. <HI>Of the Choice of Subjects.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE success of this sort of popular Elo∣quence is infallible, when there is unit∣ed a voice sufficiently strong to maintain its
<PB N="70" REF="032455_0081_0FF26A8C2A829950"/>vehemence, and a taste sufficiently delicate to avoid its eccentricities.</P>
<P>HENCE we draw this conclusion, that it is a great error to discard, from the gospel minis∣try, those awful subjects, which enkindle the imagination of the Preacher, while they tend to arouse every conscience. Besides that re∣ligion is founded upon those awful truths, which its ministers ought not to conceal, and which men are afraid to hear, in proportion to their tendency to produce a conversion. I know no subjects which give a more ample scope to the art of Oratory.</P>
<P>THE Christian Orator, who is above enrich∣ing his compositions with them, renounces his greatest advantages.</P>
<P>BUT, while we present these objects of ter∣ror, we cannot be too strongly convinced that it would be better to leave sinners in supine∣ness than to drive them to despair; that this is not so much to reach the end as to exceed all bounds; that the gospel is a law of love, and not a code of wrath; that men are nat∣urally so weak that their faults ought to excite more compassion than anger; that a Preacher is not the minister of the vengeance of Heaven, but the dispenser of its mercies; that instead of repelling sinners, it is proper to affect, to win, to reclaim them through fear to love; and to attemper the rigour of the law with the
<PB N="71" REF="032455_0082_0FF26AB2638E0148"/>attraction of the rewards of the gospel. Yes; it would be doubtless too severe, only to an∣nounce threatenings to men, who need con∣tinually to be encouraged and consoled.</P>
<P>MAKE choice of affecting subjects, which lay hold of, and interest, the man and the Christian. Be serupulous about choosing those confined subjects, which circumscribe the Orator within too narrow bounds, which are connected with no moral precept, or which make a part of all discourses on morality. Avoid frivolous subjects, whose surface ap∣pears showy, but which when we attempt to search into them, only present us with par∣ticulars too insignificant and slender for Elo∣quence; such as treat of matters of decorum rather than of duty; such as suggest materi∣als for a letter rather than grounds for a ser∣mon. Avoid quaint subjects, which are im∣proper for the multitude, merely serving the Orator himself for a pompous declamation, in which the human heart can take no interest; philosophical and abstract subjects, equally remote from religion and Eloquence, and more adapted to the Portico or the Lyceum, than to the Gospel pulpit; those subjects, in a word, which, though they may have the ap∣pearance of being novel and animating, are really far-fetched and affected, and, in which, a discovery is made, not so much of genius, as of the want of it.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="032455_0083_0FF26A8DDD746F90"/>
MANY good subjects still remain for Chris∣tian Orators to invent or revive. But then is no need to search for them, when they do not Happen to present themselves naturally to the mind, as by an involuntary inspiration.</P>
<P>BEGIN with studying the prevailing best of your genius; and, after having tried your strength on different subjects of argument, imagination, or sentiment, constantly follow that sort, which is most peculiarly your own, and which nature itself hath destined for you.</P>
<P>BE not afraid of going in beaten tracks. A fertile Orator always discovers new trea∣sures in old mines. Wherefore should we hesitate to enter afresh upon those subjects which have been already successfully hand∣led? It is because our great masters have laid hold of all their most striking beauties, and that in draining those fields, formerly so fruit∣ful, they have changed them into barren de∣serts?</P>
<P>LET us here be candid. If we were unac∣quainted with those lucid plans, those original ideas, which we so justly admire in their writ∣ings, should we have conceived them of our∣selves? The superiority of the models ought to enkindle our emulation, instead of damp∣ing our courage.</P>
<P>IF Bossuet, Bourdaloue, Masiillon, were to return upon earth, think we, that their genius
<PB N="73" REF="032455_0084_0FF26AB89E20B138"/>would be so fettered by their former masterly performances, as to be incapable of fresh productions? or that these immortal Orators would not, even at this day, have been equal to themselves? Exert your talents and zeal! The subjects, which seem to be exhausted, will immediately receive new life: and the Orator, who can even now acquire original∣ity, after these primitive men, shall participate their renown through all ages.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XX. <HI>Of Panegyrics.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREFORE should we suppose that we could succeed better in Eloquence by making choice of subjects less known, when we so seldom observe distinguished suc∣cess in the species of Panegyric, although the masters of the art have not hitherto travelled this road with that eclat which they have ac∣quired in delivering doctrinal and moral dis∣courses? The new subjects in this branch of Eloquence, which remain for Christian Ora∣tors to handle, do not infallibly suggest to their minds the most eloquent Orations. This remark proves that not new subjects, but new
<PB N="74" REF="032455_0085_0FF26A8FA362FD90"/>ideas, are wanting, in order to excel in the art of Oratory.</P>
<P>NOTHING, however, is more adapted to in∣flame the imagination, than the praise be∣stowed by the sacred ministry on those Chris∣tian heroes, whose examples do credit to our religion, while they condemn our behaviour.</P>
<P>IF it be an excellent and pleasing sight to behold persons assembled in a Church, in or∣der to their being instructed in all the duties of religion, it is also, without doubt, a very noble institution to have altars erected to vir∣tue, and public eulogiums decreed to the most reverend saints, whom religion holds up to the imitation of her children. But men, whose lives, although in other respects unblemished, have been, notwithstanding, not much known, do not furnish sufficient materials for Elo∣quence.</P>
<P>To acquire and maintain the honour of such solemn homage, it is necessary to possess celebrity proceeding from superior genius, or brilliant actions; to have obtained a distin∣guished influence over the age, or, at least, over the country, in which one has lived; to have formed an epoch in the history of re∣ligion; to be exalted above the common vir∣tues; to have outlived oneself by illustrious monuments; and to appear before posterity with a reputation commanding respect: for,
<PB N="75" REF="032455_0086_0FF269CCC9D19490"/>in spite of all the pomp of declaimers, a saint unknown will only obtain eulogiums unno∣ticed like himself.</P>
<P>THE most common fault, attending this species of discourse, is, a failure in giving a just description of the character of the man who is praised.</P>
<P>PANEGYRISTS more or less dwell upon the surface, instead of penetrating to the bottom, of the subject.</P>
<P>MOST Panegyrics, distinguished from one another merely by the title, are equally ap∣plicable to all saints in similar circumstances, and consequently do not characterize any one.</P>
<P>IT is on this account that we have not, as yet, any collection of the kind, which could be quoted for a model.</P>
<P>THE Panegyrics of Flechier, so long ex∣tolled as master-pieces in the rhetoric of col∣leges, are, in the present day, extremely fallen from their ancient glory.</P>
<P>THOSE of Massillon are universally consid∣ered as the least valuable of his productions. We are continually losing sight of the saint, whom the Orator is praising to pursue long digressions of morality, generally foreign to the subject, and of which, not one passage is remembered.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="032455_0087_0FF26A9367AC4FA0"/>
THE inattention of Preachers has occasion∣ed the disgust of the public. This species of composition is now pretty generally abandon∣ed. Excepting a very small number of pri∣vileged subjects, which should never be given up, Panegyrics are very rarely pronounced in the pulpits of Paris.</P>
<P>IT is when composing these sacred eulogies that we ought especially to keep in view this distinguished maxim of Boileau, "Nothing is beautiful but truth."</P>
<P>IT is allowable to embellish facts by com∣parisons, or by contrasts, provided that we confine ourselves to those innocent artifices of Eloquence; but it is ridiculous to pretend a false admiration, which every one sees through, and in which no one participates.</P>
<P>INDETERMINATE commendations, common places, accumulated epithets, deceitful adula∣tions, disgustful exaggerations, discover igno∣rance or knavery, and at once destroy the con∣fidence of the auditory.</P>
<P>LET the Orator, then, always reflect that he is placed in the Pulpit of truth; that he is surrounded with a number of intelligent hearers; that that which ceases to be probable is revolting; that the public opinion is never imposed on with impunity; and that extrav∣agant compliments debase him who bestows
<PB N="77" REF="032455_0088_0FF26999CAED4978"/>them without ever exalting him who receives them. Lysippus said justly, that he had honoured Alexander more by representing him with a pike in his hand, than Apelles, who always painted him hurling the thun∣derbolt like Jupiter.</P>
<P>WHEN the subject of a panegyric is fertile in events, the moral ought to arise out of the historical narrative, without smothering, it un∣der a heap of reflections which occur to every auditor. A method too didactic would be injurious to the discourse, by impeding its rapidity.</P>
<P>THOROUGHLY comprehend the character and actions of the man whom you celebrate. Surround him with his contemporaries. De∣scribe the manners of the age in which he lived. Collect, combine, all the particulars which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end to the same point, that, with them, you may frame your materials. Arrange, so to speak, the virtues, the talents, the events, the misfortunes, which history presents to your view, and you will then impart to your narrations all the strength of argument, and all the glow of Eloquence.</P>
<P>WE cannot but reprobate the method of those inanimate Panegyrists, who confound rhetorical distribution with chronological or∣der.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="032455_0089_0FF2695097D7AB10"/>
THAT severe sentence alights on such, which the Critic Boileau passed on poets, who are destitute of poetical rapture, and who write without enthusiasm: He styles them <Q>sorry historians, that will follow the order of time without daring for one moment to lose sight of a subject.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Maigres Histori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns suivront l'ordre des temps;</L>

<P>BUT it is no less certain, that, in the plan of a Panegyric, we must attend to the plain relation of facts, so that the discourse, com∣posed in other respects according to the rules of art, may appear the simple developement of the subject.</P>
<P>IT is with some astonishment, that, after having read in Massillon all the circumstances of the death of a martyr of saint, we find the Orator afterwards promising the second part of the same Panegyric.</P>
<P>THIS confusion of the plan destroys the effect of the subject; and the hearer, contin∣ually bewildered, through the want of his∣torical order, departs without obtaining the knowledge of him, whose praises he came to hear so emphatically delivered. What, but a Panegyric, is this, which does not describe
<PB N="79" REF="032455_0090_0FF269ED168CCBF0"/>the man to whom it is consecrated, and whose history I am still obliged to consult, if I wish to form clear ideas of his life?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Memoirs and Panegyrics of eminent characters, when well selected and applied, are instructive and important branches of composition and reading.</P>

<P>Of detached E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>logiums on particular characters, none, perhaps, are more forcibly expressed, or more justly applied, than Mr. Burke's, on that singularly benevolent character, Mr. HOWARD, the fame of whose disinterested actions hath raised him in Europe, what Horace styles <HI>monumentu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re perennius.</HI></P>
<P>Says Mr. BURKE, <Q>I cannot name this gentleman, without re∣marking, that his labours and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind. He has visited all Europe— not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the stateliness of temples; not to make accurate measurements of the remains of ancient grandeur, nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art; not to collect medals, or collate manuscripts; but to dive into the depths of dungeons; to plunge into the infection of hospitals; to survey the mansions of sorrow and pain, and to take the gage and dimensions of misery, depression, and contempt; to remember the forgotten; to attend to the neglected; to visit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orsaken; and to compare and collate the distresses of all men, in all countries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His plan is original; and is as full of genius as it is of hu∣manity. It was a voyage of discovery; a circumnavigation of charity. Already the benefit of his labour is felt more or less in every country; I hope he will anticipate his final reward, by seeing all its effects realized in his own. He will receive, not by retail, but in gross, the reward of those who visit the prison∣er; and he has so forestalled and monopolized this branch of charity, that there will be, I trust, little room to merit by such acts of benevolence hereafter.</Q></P>

<P>However divided the public are respecting the political senti∣ments contained in this celebrated work, it seems to be prevail∣ing and Just opinion, that, in this description, Mr. Burke has suf∣fered his imagination and gallantry to gain the ascendancy over his sober judgment; and that, while painting the hardships of an indi∣vidual, he has discovered the very spirit of a knight-errant, and carried his readers back to the almost forgotten age of chivalry.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXI. <HI>Of S. Vincent de Paul.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the subjects of Panegyric, which the modern history of religion affords us, the best, in my opinion, is the eulogy of S. VINCENT DE PAUL; a man of great virtue, though possessed of but little renown; the best citizen whom France hath had; the Apostle of humanity, who, after having been a shep∣herd in his childhood, hath left in his country establishments of more utility to the unfortu∣nate, than the finest monuments of his sove∣reign, Louis XIV.</P>
<P>HE was, successively, a slave at Tunis, Pre∣ceptor of the Cardinal de Retz, Minister of a village, Chaplain-General of the galleys, Prin∣cipal of a college, Chief of the missions, and Joint-Commissioner of Ecclesiastical Benefi∣ces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adjoint au ministère de la feuille des Beáneáfices.</NOTE> He instituted, in France, the Semina∣ries
<PB N="81" REF="032455_0092_0FF2696B4A947B18"/>of the Lazarists, and of the Daughters of Charity, who devote themselves to the conso∣lation of the unfortunate, and who scarcely ever change their condition, although their vows only bind them for a year. He endowed hospitals for foundlings, for orphans, for the insane, for galley-slaves, and for old men. His generous compassion reached all kinds of wretchedness, with which the human species is oppressed, and monuments of his benefi∣cence are to be found throughout all the provinces of the kingdom. When reading his life, we remark, that nothing does more honour to religion, than the history of institu∣tions formed in favour of humanity, when humanity is beholden for them to the minis∣ters of the altars. Whilst kings, armed against each other, ravage the earth already laid waste by other scourges. Vincent de Paul, the son of a husbandman of Gascony, repaired the public calamities, and distributed more than twenty millions of livres in Champagne, in Picardy, in Lorraine, in Artois, where the inhabitants of whole villages were dying through want, and were afterwards left in the fields without burial, until he undertook to defray the expenses of interment. He dis∣charged, for some time, an office of zeal and charity towards the gallies. He saw, one day, a wretched galley-slave, who had been con∣demned to three years confinement for smug∣gling,
<PB N="82" REF="032455_0093_0FF26A9D40902A40"/>and who appeared inconsolable on ac∣count of his wife and children having been left in the greatest distress. Vincent de Paul sensibly affected with his situation, offered to put himself in his stead, and, what doubtless will scarcely be credited, the exchange was accepted. This virtuous man was chained among the crew of galley-slaves, and his sent continued to be swollen during the remainder of his life, from the weight of those honour∣able irons which he had borne.</P>
<P>IT is evident how much an action like this is capable of suggesting to the mind of an Orator; and that he would be unworthy or his profession, if he related it without excit∣ing tears.</P>
<P>WHEN this great man came to Paris, found∣lings were sold in the street of St. Landry for twenty sous a piece; and the charge of these innocent creatures was committed, out of charity, as was reported, to diseased women, from whom they sucked corrupted milk.</P>
<P>THESE infants whom Government aban∣doned to public compassion, almost all perish∣ed; and such as happened to escape so many dangers were introduced clandestinely into opulent families, in order to dispossess the legitimate heirs. This, for more than a cen∣tury, was a never-failing source of litigation, the particulars of which are to be found in
<PB N="83" REF="032455_0094_0FF26ABC5D842700"/>the compilation of our old lawyers. Vincent de Paul at once provided funds for the main∣tainance of twelve of these children. His charity was soon extended to the relief of all those who were left exposed at the doors of the churches. But that unusual zeal, which always gives life to a new institution, having cooled, the resources entirely failed, and fresh outrages were renewed on humanity.</P>
<P>VINCENT DE PAUL was not discouraged. He convoked an extraordinary assembly. He caused a number of those wretched infants to be placed in the church; and forthwith mounting the pulpit, he pronounced, with his eyes bathed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears, that discourse▪ which doth as much honour to his piety as his Elo∣quence, and which I faithfully transcribe from the history of his life, drawn up by M. Abelly, Bishop of Rhodes.</P>
<P><Q>COMPASSION and charity have assuredly induced you, Ladies, to adopt these little creatures for your children. You have been their mothers by kindness, since their moth∣ers by nature have forsaken them. See, now, whether ye also are willing to abandon them. Cease, for the present, to be their mothers, that ye may become their judges. Their life and their death are in your hands. I am going to put it to the vote, and to take the suffrages. It is time to pronounce their
<PB N="84" REF="032455_0095_0FF26954596A2250"/>sentence, and to know if ye are unwilling to have compassion any longer upon them. They will live, if ye continue to take a charitable care of them, and they will all die if ye abandon them.</Q></P>
<P>SIGHS were the only answer to this pathetic exhortation: and the same day, in the same church, at that very time, the Foundling Hospital at Paris was founded and endowed with a revenue of forty thousand livres.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The success attending this discourse of Vincent de Paul, in the erection of the Foundling Hospital at Paris, is elsewhere (§ 48) compared to that of the Bishop of Worcester's sermon, which in∣fluenced the public benevolence to found an Hospital for Inocula∣tion in London; and hence our author is led to remark, that "Eloquence could not obtain a more excellent triumph." In ad∣dition to these two instances of succesful discourse, it may be added, that, in consequence of Bishop Ridley's sermon on alms, King Edward the Sixth founded St. Bartholomew's Hospital for the sick and wounded, Bridewell for the wilfully idle and mad, and Christ Church for orphan. <BIBL>BURNETT'S <HI>History of the Re∣formation.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>THIS is the man, who scarcely possesses any fame in Europe! This is the man, who, ac∣cording to the judgment of his enemies, had zeal only without talents! His life was inter∣woven with good works, the benefit of which we still enjoy.</P>
<P>THE misfortune of S. Vincent de Paul (if it be one to be little praised, and even little known,) was not to be celebrated, when he died in 1661, by that eloquent Bossuet who immortalized all his heroes, and who, at the
<PB N="85" REF="032455_0096_0FF269A5EFC3D050"/>very time, was composing funeral orations for subjects far less deserving of his genius. But the honour of a public Panegyric is due to his virtues; and the Orator, who shall represent him in a point of view worthy of the admiration and gratitude of his fellow-citi∣zens, will have deserved well of his country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This singular character is styled the <Q>Founder and first Supe∣rior General of the Congregation of the Mission.</Q> BAYLE'S <HI>Dictionary,</HI> vol. i. p. 36.</P>

<P><Q>The life of JONAS HANWAY is a series of benevolent inten∣tions, recommended by his writings, promoted by his bounty, and accomplished by unceasing industry. All his efforts, except his opposition to the hill for naturalizing the Jews, were dictated by a wise, liberal, and enlarged benevolence. We calculate, with pleasing admiration, how much it is possible for a good man zeal∣ously affected to accomplish.

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. <HI>Of Describing Characters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is common in Panegyrics, or in funeral Orations, for Orators to sketch the por∣traiture of contemporaries who have been the rivals or antagonists of the man whose virtues are praised. Such passages are commonly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>cised with so much the more severity, as they always indicate design; and the Auditor is uninterested in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing them, unless a distinguished precision immediately impress them on his memory; unless each stroke of the pencil form an excellent trait; unless the man, of whose character we are forming a judgment, is already celebrated; and, in a word, unless the Orator compress many ideas into a very narrow compass.</P>
<P>WHEN Massillon preached to the Nuns of Chilot, in the presence of the Queen of Eng∣land, he drew the picture of the Prince of Orange, to please the consort of King James; but his genius rendered him no service on this occasion. Massillon only introduces one thought, in order to describe William III. which he expresses with sufficient precision, and afterwards dilates with his usual elegance, but without thoroughly investigating the cha∣racter of the Stadtholder, or availing himself of the result of the history.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="032455_0098_0FF26ABE26594E78"/>
HIS amplification was more adapted to console the Queen of England, than to de∣scribe the Prince of Orange. It may serve for an illustration of the fact, that Massillon enlarged too much on the same idea, and ex∣tremely misapplied his fluency of expression.</P>
<P>WOULD you wish to know how Bossuet has described the Protector CROMWELL? Contrast with the excessive copiousness of the Bishop of Clermont, the energetic impetuosity of the Bishop of Meaux. Nothing will more strong∣ly mark the difference of their genius.</P>
<P><Q>A MAN, in whom was combined an in∣credible depth of mind, the refined hy∣pocrite, and the skilful politician; a man, capable of any undertaking, and of pro∣found dissimulation; equally active and indefatigable in peace and war; who left nothing to Fortune, that he could take from her, either by resolution or foresight; withal so vigilant, and prepared on every side, that he never neglected the opportunities, with which she presented him. In a word, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one of those restless and daring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who seem as if they were born to effect the revolution of the world.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Funeral Oration for the Queen of England.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is thus that a few lines suffice to devel∣ope an extraordinary character, with the
<PB N="88" REF="032455_0099_0FF26B0C1773D090"/>penetration of a Moralist, the vehemence of an Orator, and the correctness of an Historian.</P>
<P>MASSILLON slightly glances upon subjects, and has a profusion of words. Bossuet acts precisely the reverse. It is not possible to deliver an opinion more adapted to establish the decision of posterity.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIII. <HI>Of Compliments.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SINCE the discussion of the different rules, to which the art of Eloquence subjects Christian Orators, hath led me on to various episodical details, I must not proceed to more it portant matters, without dwelling a little longer on another branch of ministerial wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which has much affinity to Panegyrics, and especially to the description of characters.</P>
<P>I MEAN to speak of COMPLIMENTS, with which we are sometimes led to begin, or finish, our pulpit discourses.</P>
<P>ESTABLISHED usage no longer permits the ministers of the gospel to preach the sacred word before the rulers of the world, without burning at their feet some grains of incense. Kings are, therefore, much to be pitied, who
<PB N="89" REF="032455_0100_0FF26B8C00A6EA78"/>are pursued with flattery in those very Church∣es, where they come to learn their duty, and to be humbled for their faults: but it is, also, to be regretted, that Christian Orators, who ought then to speak as the conscience of the guilty, should degrade themselves to a level with a crowd of flatterers. What must doubt∣less comfort them, is, the assurance that com∣mendations enjoined upon the man who offers them, cannot dazzle the great, to whom they are addressed.</P>
<P>LET no one, however, exceed the bounds of just praise; for religion doth not permit it any farther than is consistent with truth.</P>
<P>LET us ever recognize an Apostle as an enemy to falsehood, even in those Compli∣ments wherein one might so often suppose himself freed from the obligation of sincerity. Let us not bring a ministry, divinely com∣missioned, into contempt, by e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ggerated eulogiums, which can never impose, either upon the Great who despise them, upon the Orator who pronounces them, upon the Auditor who hears them, or upon God, who forms a just judgment concerning them.</P>
<P>ADULATION always displeases. <Q>To praise Princes for virtues which they have not,</Q> says the Duke de Rochefoucauld, <Q>is to insult
<PB N="90" REF="032455_0101_0FF26AF4384E3AF8"/>them with impunity.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thought, 320.</NOTE> It is, at least, to forget the respect which is due to them.</P>
<P>EUSEBIUS, in "the life of Constantine,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. iv. chap. 4.</NOTE> relates, that this Emperor imposed silence upon a preacher, who was base enough to imitate, in his sermon, the fiction of Virgil respecting the Apotheosis of Augustus, by telling Constantine, that, after his death, he should be associated with the Son of God in the government of the universe.</P>
<P>I ADMIRE in Bossuet, that noble and manly freedom, which he always possessed, through sear of flattery. We discern, in his Compli∣ments, a certain apostolic severity, and a marked dislike of adulation.</P>
<P>HAD an indifferent person been nominated to praise Madam de la Valliere, for entering into a religious order, in the presence of Queen Maria Theresa, he would not have declined such an opportunity of extolling the virtues of the consort of Louis XIV.</P>
<P>"IT is proper", said Bossuet to her, <Q>it is fit, Madam, that as you form by your rank so considerable a part of worldly grandeur, you should sometimes join in ceremonies, wherein we learn to undervalue it.</Q> The Orator then recals his subject, and thinks no more of the Princess.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="032455_0102_0FF26B3D44872630"/>
FENELON never weakened, in his preach∣ing, the force of the sacred maxims, which he hath recorded in Telemachus against flatterers.</P>
<P>ONE single Compliment of this kind is alone extant. It is to be found towards the conclusion of the discourse, which he deliv∣ered at the Consecration of the Elector of Cologne. That passage is alike worthy of Fenelon, by its distinguished moderation, as well as by the rhetorical expression, which he makes use of, to justify the reservedness of his eulogium.</P>
<P><Q>YOU have just heard, my brethren, all that I have said to this Prince. What have I not dared to say to him? And what ought I not to be bold to say to him, since his only fear is not to know the truth? The greatest praise would do him infinitely less honour, than the episcopal liberty with which he wishes me to address him.</Q></P>
<P>IT is difficult to adopt a direct address in Compliments, without appearing either to exaggerate, or to have an uniformity of style, and also without embarrassing the person too much, whom we mean to praise.</P>
<P>IT is preferable to include them in a para∣phrase of the holy scriptures, or in prayer to God, or in an apostrophe addressed to the auditory.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="032455_0103_0FF26B18119D0C68"/>
BUT, whatever be the mode of expression that we select, the Compliment delivered must be connected with the subject under discus∣sion; common places, which characterize no one, must be avoided; instruction must be blended with praise, or, rather, be made to proceed out of the praise itself; we must con∣fine ourselves to a small number of lively and striking ideas; and endeavour to conclude with a passage happily expressed, and easily remembered.</P>
<P>BOURDALOUE never excelled in this arti∣cle. All his compliments are trivial. In the sermon he preached at Versailles, two days after the marriage of the Duke of Bourbon, son of the great Dauphin, with Adelaide of Savoy, he repeated, towards his conclusion, a passage of scripture, the application of which forcibly struck the auditory. Some esteemed it a very happy allusion, while others were of opinion, that it degenerated into a play of words.</P>
<P>AFTER a very instructive eulogium, Bour∣daloue speaks, in these terms, of the young Princess:</P>
<P><Q>THERE is that, which, in my estimation, renders her more respectable than her rank, and which induces me to say as Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, when, beholding for the first time the spouse of the son of his
<PB N="93" REF="032455_0104_0FF26ACF76C8CBA8"/>master, cried out in a transport of admira∣tion and praise,</Q> <Q>this truly is she whom God hath chosen, to be the wife of the son of my Lord.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION XXIV. <HI>Of a direct Address; and Rhetorical Dialogue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF drawing of characters and compliments be excepted, in which the Orator may sometimes descend, without degradation, to the sparkling efforts of wit, a manly energy, of which solidity constitutes the beauty, should enliven all the members of his discourses.</P>
<P>WHENEVER he addresses an assembly, he should affect them, for the language of the passions is that alone which strike the multi∣tude.</P>
<P>I HAVE often remarked, that, in the read∣ing societies which are formed in the country, eloquent works are chosen in preference to those of instruction. Truth satisfies the mind of a solitary reader; but no sooner doth he unite with others than he wishes to be affect∣ed; and writings, otherwise excellent, cease to please, when they undergo the formidable experiment of being read aloud.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="032455_0105_0FF26AFFE3031E98"/>
ATTEMPT not, then, to write a book, when you are composing a sermon. Guard against ever adopting the languid trammels of a wri∣ter, who speaks from his pen, or his paper, while I should be attending to his discourse as the inspiration of the moment.</P>
<P>ARE you desirous that your Eloquence may be animated? Substitute for the languor of a continued discourse, the liveliness of an immediate address. Converse continually with your hearers. Instead of wandering in abstract contemplations, as if you were meditating in solitude, speak to that numerous assembly, which gathers around to hear you.</P>
<P>YOU will find a very good example of this direct address, in <Q>the familiar instruction of Massillon, upon the ceremony of Abso∣lution:</Q> an admirable exhortation, which, bears no resemblance to any of his other dis∣courses, and, in which, each expression is a dart thrown by the Orator, transfixing the hearts of his Auditory!</P>
<P>To speak to the hearers is not sufficient. It is also requisite to make them speak them∣selves, and to add to the variegated charms of an immediate address, the never failing and increasing effect of Dialogue.</P>
<P>THE ancients discussed, in Dialogues, the most philosophic subjects. These men, who
<PB N="95" REF="032455_0106_0FF26B8FCEB5BF40"/>knew so well how to imitate nature, did not compose inanimate books, when they meant to unfold the ideas which they had collected in their meditations. They approached to the manner of the drama. They placed, upon the stage, some friends, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose conversations they reported. They thus discussed various opposite opinions, with an equal mixture of wisdom and urbanity. They made choice of each reader for a judge; and hence it is, that they have diffused over the writings of anti∣quity, all that delight, which is experienced while attending to the conversation of a select number of intelligent guests, who mutually impart each other's thoughts, in the agreeable freedom of an entertainment.</P>
<P>IF, by this mode of Dialogue, Plato and Cicero have succeeded in enlivening meta∣physical subjects, how much greater impulse and life would it not impart to Eloquence?</P>
<P>IN Oratory, Dialogue supplies the place of alternate speakers, breaks the monotony, gives strength to the argument, and inspires confidence, provided the Orator does not weaken those difficulties which he ought to propose to himself; for, if the hearer can render the objections more forcible than the Orator, he will no longer attend to his an∣swers.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="032455_0107_0FF26B4C5AD199C0"/>
BESIDES, nothing is better calculated for reviving the attention, than those suspensions, properly managed, which cause the hearers to fluctuate in a kind of uncertainty, proceeding at first from an emotion of surprise, when the Orator starts objections to himself, which he afterwards converts into curiosity, when he refutes them.</P>
<P>I AM often delighted with those cogent questions in the Discourses of MASSILLON, which engage the attention of the hearers, at the very moment when they might be apt to withdraw it.</P>
<P>AN example of this sort occurs in his ser∣mon "on the mixture of the righteous and the wicked."</P>
<P><Q>THE righteous deprive iniquity of every excuse. Do you say that you have done no more than to follow established prece∣dents? But have the righteous, who are among you, conformed to them? Do you plead the unavoidable consequences of illustrious descent? You know some, who, with a name still more distinguished than your own, impart sanctity to splendor. Do you plead the vivacity of your years?—the weakness of your sex? Every day will shew you some, who, in the bloom of youth, and with all the talents suited to this world,
<PB N="97" REF="032455_0108_0FF26B921BCEF520"/>have their minds supremely bent on Heav∣en. Is it the distraction of business? You may see those engaged in the same cares with yourself, who, notwithstanding, make salvation their principal concern. Is plea∣sure your delight? Pleasure is the first desire of all men, and of the righteous, in some of whom it is even stronger, and whose natural dispositions are less favourable to virtue, than in you. Do you plead your afflictions? There are some good men dis∣tressed. Or prosperity? There are those to be met with, who, amidst their abund∣ance, devote themselves to God. Or the state of your health? You discover some, who, in sickly bodies, possess souls filled with divine fortitude. Turn yourself which way you will; as many righteous, as many the witnesses which testify against you.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The discussion of a variety of important subjects in the form of Dialogue has been frequently adopted. The ancient Greek and Roman Writers abounded in this method of composition. Among others, PLATO, LUCIAN, CICERO, MACROBIUS, the author of the <HI>Dialogue concerning the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence</HI> (ascribed by some to Tacitus, and by others to Quintilian;) AESCHINES, SOCRATICUS, MINUTIUS, FELIX, XENOPHON,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">XENOPLION may, without much impropriety, be called a Dialogue-writer; for, though his writings are not in the direct form of Dialogue, yet he continually makes his characters speak in their own language. HOMER, also, abounds in this form of Dialogue.
<P>Various instances of the same sort may be traced so early as in the writings of MOSES, and the Prophets, as well as in those of the Evangelists. Such are these; Isa. xlix. 14, 15: <Q>But Zion sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." Rom. vi. 1: "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid; How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</Q> <BIBL>In like manner, Rom. ix. 19:</BIBL> <Q>Thou wilt say unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted his will? Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same iump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</Q> <BIBL>So 1. Cor. xv. 35 —39:</BIBL> <Q>But some man will say. How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou so west is not quickened except it die,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Modern, as well as ancient, writers, have handled subjects in this form of Dialogue, or immediate address.</P>
<P>Mr. ADDISON hath left behind him his <HI>Dialogues upon the useful∣ness of ancient me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>als,</HI> which he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ems to have formed upon the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of CICERO.

<P>Dr. WARD observes, that <Q>this method seems to be attended with very considerable advantages, if well and judiciously man∣aged. For it is capable to make the driest subjects entertaining and pleasant, by its variety, and the different characters of the speakers. Besides▪ things may be canvasse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more minutely, and many lesser matters, which seem to clear up a subject may be introduced with a better grace by questions and answers, objec∣tions and replies, than can be conveniently done in continued discourse. There is likewise a farther advantage in this way of writing, that the author is at liberty to choose his speakers. And, therefore, as Cicero has well observed, when we imagine that we hear persons of an established reputation for wisdom and knowledge talking together, it necessarily adds a weight and authority to the discourse,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Amic, c. 1.</NOTE> and more closely engages the at∣tention. The subject matter of it is very extensive; for what∣ever is a proper argument of discourse, public or private, serious o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> jocose; whatever is fit for wise and ingenious men to talk opon, either for improvement or dive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion, is suitable for a Dialogue.</Q></P> <BIBL>WARD'S <HI>System of Oratory,</HI> vol. ii. p. 219.</BIBL>

<HEAD>SECTION XXV. <HI>Of an ardent Style.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN proportion to the frequency of Dialogue in a discourse, the less will Apostrophes be necessary; and the less lavish we are of this figure, the greater will be its effect.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="032455_0110_0FF26B9CAE1D5FC8"/>
IT is in Apostrophes that the Orator should display all his vehemence, if he would avoid the danger and confusion, attending himself, alone, being warmed with his subject. Feel∣ing succeeds better than reasoning in those moments of effervescence, in which the soul ought to burst forth with sufficient impetu∣osity to hurry the Auditory along one while by the strength of the proofs, another while by the energy of rhetorical strokes.</P>
<P>WHEN Apostrophes are multiplied, they discover a declaimer, who cannot write, who is confused rather than moved and who sub∣stitutes affected convulsions for the transports of Eloquence.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="032455_0111_0FF26B51CCD631A0"/>
IT is necessary, without doubt, that the Orator should enliven his compositions with that ardour of soul which indicates and awak∣ens sensibility.</P>
<P>IF his writings be destitute of those glow∣ing ideas, which proceed from the heart, his most emphatic language will only be insipid jargon.</P>
<P>"THE dull writer is a wretched author." This maxim of Boileau is incontestable.</P>
<P>BUT, if, by the term <HI>ardour,</HI> be understood, the fermentations of a roving brain, paradox united to a depraved taste, unceasing apos∣trophes, useless exclamations, obscure hyper∣boles; in a word, a style inflated with ex∣travagant metaphors; ah! guard against such digressions, O young Orator, who hast re∣ceived from nature the inestimable gift of genius. Be assured that genuine enthusiasm is no other than reason warmed by the voice of the passions, and that Eloquence is not a delirium.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Ancient Eloquence," says Mr. HUME, <Q>i. e. the sublime and passionate, is of a much juster taste than the modern, or the argumentative and rational; and, if properly executed, will al∣ways have more command and authority over mankind. The ancients, upon comparison, gave the preference to that kind, of which they have left us such applauded models. Lyfias, and others, were esteemed in their time; but, when compared with Demosth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Cicero, were eclipsed like a taper when set in the rays of a meridian sun. Those latter Orators possessed the same elegance, and subtlety, and force of argument, with the former; but what rendered them chiefly admirable, was that pathene and sublime, which, on proper occasions, they threw into their discourse; and by which they commanded the resolutions of their audience.</Q> <BIBL>HUME'S <HI>Essays,</HI> No. xii. p. 123.</BIBL>
<P><Q>The <HI>vehement</HI> style, (says Dr. BLAIR,) always implies strength; and is not, by any means, inconsistent with simplicity: but in its predominant character is distinguishable from either the strong or the simple manner. It has a peculiar ardour; it is a glowing style; the language of a man, whose imagination and passions are heated, and strongly affected by what he writes; who is there∣fore negligent of lesser graces, but pours himself forth with the rapidity and fulness of a torrent. It belongs to the higher kinds of oratory; and, indeed, is rather expected from a man who is speaking, than from one who is writing in his closet. The orations of Demosthenes furnish the full and perfect example of this species of style.</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> Lect. xix. p. 396.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. BLAIR elsewhere says, <Q>There is a still higher degree of Eloquence, wherein a greater power is exerted over the human mind; by which we are not only convinced, but interested, agitated, and carried along with the speaker; our passions are made to rise together with his; we enter into all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> notions; we love, we detest, we resent, according as he inspires us; and are prompted to resolve, or to act, with vigour and warmth. Such high Eloquence is always the offspring of passion. By pas∣sion, I mean that state of the mind in which it is agitated and fired, by some object it has in view. A man may convince, and even persuade others to act, by mere reason and argument. But that degree of eloquence which gains the admiration of mankind, and properly denominates one an Orator, is never found without warmth, or passion. Passion, when in such a degree as to rouse and kindle the mind, without throwing it out of the possession of itself, is universally found to exalt all the human powers. It ren∣ders the mind infinitely more enlightened, more penetrating, more vigorous and masterly, than it is in its calm moment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A man actuated by a strong passion, becomes much greater than he is at other times. He is conscious of more strength and force: he utters greater sentiments, conceives higher designs, and executes them with a boldness and felicity, of which, on other occasions, he could not think himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apable. But chiefly, with respect to persuasion, is the power of passion felt. Almost every man, in passion, is eloquent. Then he is at no loss for words and ar∣guments. He transmits to others, by a sort of contagious sym∣pathy, the warm sentiments which he feels; his looks and ges∣tures are all persuasive; and nature here shews herself infinitely more powerful than all art. This is the foundation of that just and noted rule; <HI>Si vis me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi.</HI></Q></P>

<P>THE genuine talent for Eloquence is dis∣tinguished among very different styles. The Orator possessed of it is always simple with∣out ever appearing vulgar.

To avoid in his discourses the tome of declama∣tion, he meditates a long time before he writes; for it is the effect of meditation to retrench the superfluity of words. The sacrifices, which he offers to taste, do not enervate his energy; they yield fresh pleasure to the auditor, who is capable of admiring a natural and true ex∣pression

<P>STYLE loses its fulness and energy, when words are environed with cumbrous epi∣thets.</P>
<P>It hath been remarked, that, in the philo∣sophical analysis of languages, the substantive
<PB N="104" REF="032455_0115_0FF26AFA2AEDBF00"/>is nothing, as it were, because <HI>abstract,</HI> and the adjective every thing, because it is <HI>sensible.</HI> But it is not so in Eloquence, where, fre∣quently, the Epithet not being required by the accompanying word, oppresses the period, without strengthening the thought.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Feeble writers," says Dr. BLAIR, <Q>employ a multitude of words to make themselves understood, as they think more dis∣tinctly; and they only confound the reader. They are sensible of not having caught the precise expression, to convey what they would signify; they do not, indeed, conceive their own meaning very precisely themselves; and, therefore, help it out, as they can, by this and the other word, which may, as they suppose, supply the defect, and bring you somewhat nearer to their idea: they are always going about it, and about it, but never just hit the thing. The image, as they set it before you, is always double; and no double image is distinct. When an author tells me of his <HI>courage</HI> in the day of battle, the expression is precise, and I understand it fully. But if, from the desire of multiplying words, he will needs praise his <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>fortitude;</HI> at the mo∣ment he joins these words together, my idea begins to waves. He means to express one quality more strongly; but he is, in truth, expressing two. <HI>Courage</HI> resists danger; <HI>fortitude</HI> supports pain. The occasion of exerting each of these qualities is differ∣ent; and being led to think of both together, when only one of them should be in my view, my view is rendered unsteady, and my conception of the object indistinct.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 190, 191.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>EVERY useless Epithet ought to be pro∣scribed.

<HEAD>SECTION XXVII. <HI>Of the Necessity of an Orator's refining his Style.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CHRISTIAN Orators, do you, yourselves, erase such disgusting pleonasms. Pass a critical judgment upon your productions, and, together with such insignificant expres∣sions, banish all those negligencies of style, which degrade the sublimity of the ideas.</P>
<P>IT is not required that the whole of a ser∣mon should be equally striking; but it is requisite that it be all equally well written, and that Eloquence make amends, by the beauty of the expression, for the quality of the thoughts when they are ordinary; just as sculpture adds, by the richness of the drapery, to the elegance of the figures.</P>
<P>WE must allow pauses for admiration. This is chiefly necessary for the sake of energy. If, therefore, it be remarked that there are many very eloquent passages in a sermon
<PB N="106" REF="032455_0117_0FF26B5376345BA8"/>composed with care, and containing forcible arguments, the praise will be sufficient; since there is none as yet extant, which is in all respects perfect.</P>
<P>Is the merit of a pure and elegant style your ambition? Multiply the copies of your discourses, and cease not to transcribe your performance until you are able to afford satisfaction to yourself.</P>
<P>AN Orator ought to adopt the motto of Caesar, who <Q>thought that he had done nothing, while there remained any thing for him to do.</Q> The more he writes, the better he writes; and it is only by surmount∣ing the tediousness of reiterated transcriptions, that he can display in his style all the elegance of his taste.</P>
<P>HENCE it is, that very few men of learning employ all their powers to advantage. The greater part, being accustomed to rest too soon contented, die without ever having known the extent of their own talents.</P>
<P>FRESH ideas, the beauties of enlargement, the exquisite sentiment of a finished passage, which Horace so well defined and relished when he called it, <HI>qui me mihi reddat amicum;</HI> in a word, the elegant and variegated turns of expression, which compose the beauty of style, do not occur to a writer in the first cast
<PB N="107" REF="032455_0118_0FF26B9E4F5A1978"/>of a work, and are generally the effect of a slow correction.</P>
<P>WHILE there remains room to alter. there is opportunity for improvement. It is the characteristic of excellence in all the arts, so sensibly to strike the spectator who admires it, that he can conceive of nothing transcending that which he beholds.</P>
<P>HOWEVER little we may have accustomed ourselves to write, we easily distinguish those passages, which have not been sufficiently studied, and which proceeded from the pen of the writer, before they had been thoroughly digested in his own mind. This hasty or negligent composition soon discovers itself, not, as is commonly supposed, by the pleasing freedom of a diction somewhat too unrestrain∣ed and irregular, but by the confusion of ex∣pression, all the constituent parts of which are stiff and forced.</P>
<P>THE more the writer hurries himself, the more dragging, of course, is his style. And, when it is said that a writing "smells of the lamp," it is an evident proof that it is not sufficiently laboured.</P>
<P>WHEN the steel hath been well polished, the edge of the file is no more perceived.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVIII. <HI>Of a proper Selection of Words.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET no one accuse me here of exhorting Orators to render their compositions insipid, with a view of improving their style.</P>
<P>I AM sensible, that, whatever we wish to finish with too much care, we enervate; and, that the impetuosity of Eloquence spurns at those minute researches, which would extin∣guish its fervour; but, I am aware also, that we can write from present impulse, and cor∣rect afterwards, at leisure, without cooling the original ardour; and, that a pnoper me∣dium is requisite to be kept between the ex∣treme of neglecting application, which adds to the defects of taste, and the excess of la∣bour, which deadens the transports of genius.</P>
<P>BOILEAU hath said before me, and better than I have, <Q>Put your work twenty times upon the frame; polish and re-polish it continually; sometimes add, and often erase.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vingt fois fier le <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tier vemettez votre ouvrage;

<P>Dr. BLAIR enforces the same attention to the work of revision and correction, in his directions for forming Style, when he ob∣ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that <Q>there may be an extreme in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great and anxious a care about words. We must not re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard the course of thought, nor cool the heat of imagination, by pausing too long on every word we employ. There is, on certain occasions, a glow of com∣position which should be kept up, if we hope to express ourselves happily, though at the expense of allowing some inadver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>encies to pass. A more severe examination of these must be left to be the work of correction. For, if the practice of composition be useful, the laborious work of correcting is no less so; it is, in∣deed, absolutely necessary to our reaping any benefit from the habit of composition. What we have written, should be laid by for some little time, till the ardour of composition be past, till the fondness for the expressions we have used be worn off, and the expressions themselves be forgotten; and then reviewing our work with a cool and critical eye, as if it were the performance of another, we shall discern many imperfections which at first escaped us. Then is the season for pruning redundancies; for weighing the arrangement of sentences; for attending to the juncture and connecting particles; and bringing Style into a regular, correct, and supported form. This <HI>Lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Labor,</HI> must be submitted to by all who would communicate their thoughts with proper advantage to others; and some practice in it will soon sharpen their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye to the most necessary objects of attention, and render it a much more easy and practicable work than might at first be imagined.</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 404.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="032455_0120_0FF26B9FF5CB9B40"/>
A PAINS-TAKING Orator, who is desirous of giving the finishing stroke to his produc∣tions, is always repaid for his trouble. If correction do not suggest to him the materials of a discourse, it, at least, points out expres∣sions unworthy of the pulpit, which sometimes escape in the ardour of composition; and<PB N="110" REF="032455_0121_0FF26B5B2030A190"/>this, doubtless, is a valuable advantage in a style wherein we apprehend, justly enough, that one bad word doth oftentimes more injury, than a weak argument.</P>
<P>CORRECTION suggests to the Orator appro∣priate expressions, which render his ideas more striking, and his sentiments more impassioned▪ "In the same manner," says Cicero, <Q>as clothes, at first invented through necessity, have afterwards become ornamental to the human body, so words, created by necessity, impart also beauty to discourse.</Q></P>
<P>THE value of well placed expressions is so striking in the art of Oratory, that the elo∣quence of a passage sometimes depends upon a single word. Take an example which is deserving of admiration. I select it from an excellent discourse, which the Cardinal de Rohan, Grand Almoner of France, pronoun∣ced upon presenting the body of Louis XIV. at the Abbey of St. Dennis. <Q>The Prince, whose loss we mourn, leaves, it is true, <HI>names</HI> celebrated upon earth; and posterity the most remote, will, like us, admire Louis the Great, the Just, the Conqueror, the Pa∣cific, the Friend of Learning, and the Pro∣tector of Kings.</Q></P>
<P>HAD the Cardinal de Rohan said, that this Monarch left upon earth a celebrated <HI>name,</HI> his expression would hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been very com∣mon;
<PB N="111" REF="032455_0122_0FF26BA4352FB518"/>but the same phrase put in the plural, while speaking only of one man, and the enumeration of the several titles of glory of Louis XIV. which at once justifies this bold ascription, appear to me a sublime stroke.</P>
<P>MASSILLON knew also, this secret of the art. In his writings, a word, which seemed to de∣clare a paradox, often expressed a new thought, and a very weighty and just idea. Such is that admirable Apostrophe, which we read in his sermon, <Q>on the mixture of the righteous and the wicked.</Q> <Q>Ye great ones of the earth! the innocent pleasure of sincerity, without which there is nothing agreeable in the commerce of mankind, is denied you, and ye have no more friends, because it is too <HI>beneficial</HI> to be one.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION XXIX. <HI>Of Metaphors.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"I AM fond," says Montaigne, "of words corresponding with the thought." But, to represent an idea in all its energy, the vulgar expression is frequently insufficient, and then the Metaphor becomes the proper word in rhetorical language.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="032455_0123_0FF26B6133E70878"/>
It is essential to the two objects of which a Metaphor is composed, that their relation to each other be obvious, and that they may be marked by no striking dissimilitude.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE could not exist without this language of imagination. "Speech," says Cicero, <Q>ought equally to strike the mind and senses of all men.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Oratio Lominum sensibus et mentibus accom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>data. <BIBL><HI>De Orat, 12.55.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> Now, the senses are not moved but by the liveliness of images. Nature herself, which is the original model of art, suggests the most expressive images to savages, to infants, and to the meanest ranks of people, when they are governed by a strong passion.</P>
<P>DUMARSAIS hath judiciously observed, that <Q>more tropes were made use of in the mar∣kets, than in the academies.</Q> It is true, those popular Metaphors are often very inac∣curate, and a writer ought to express them with exactness, when he means to admit them into elevated language.</P>
<P>THAT absurd medley of Balthasar Gratian has been quoted with propriety, as a very striking example of the abuse which may be made of figurative eloquence: <Q>Thoughts flow from the extensive coasts of memory, embark on the sea of the imagination, arrive
<PB N="113" REF="032455_0124_0FF26BAC5207C4B8"/>at the port of genius, to be registered at the custom-house of the understanding.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps it may be no unsuitable parallel to the fantastical Metaphor of Balthasar Gratian, mentioned by M. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, to quoted from the <HI>Life of</HI> GI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TIN, that absurd bombast, said to have been addressed by an High Sheriff at Oxford to the students; "Arriv∣ing," says <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, <Q>at the Mount of St. Mary, in the stony stage where I now stand, I have brought you some fine biscui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> care∣fully conserved for the chickens of the church, the sparrows of the spirit, and the sweet swallows of salvation.</Q> <BIBL>GI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ONS'S <HI>Rhetoric,</HI> p. 17.</BIBL></P>
<P>The Spectator humourously describes the abuse of figurative Elo∣quence, when he says, <Q>An unskilful author shall run Metaphors so absurdly into one another, that there small be no simile, no agreeable picture, no apt resemblance, but confusion, obscurity, and noise. Thus have I known an hero compared to a thun∣derbolt, a lion, and the sea; all and each of them proper Meta∣phors for impetuosity, courage, or force; but by had manage∣ment it hath so happened, that the thunderbolt hath overflowed its banks, the lion hath darted through the skies, and the billows have rolled out of the Lybian desert.</Q></P>
<P>The same author presents us with the following letter, as a speci∣men of the enormous abuse of metaphorical expression.—<Q>Sir, After the many heavy lashes that have fallen from your pen, you may justly expect in return, all the load, that my ink can lay upon your shoulders. You have quartered all the foul language upon me, that could be raked out of the air of Billingsgate, without knowing who I am, or whether I deserve to be cupped and sacrificed at this rate. I tell you, once for all, turn your eyes where you please, you shall never small me out. Do you think that the panics which you sow about the parish will ever build a monument to your glory? No, Sir, you may fight these battles as long as you will, but, when you come to balance the account, you will find that you have been fishing in troubled waters, and that an ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s hath bewildered you, and that indeed you have built upon a sandy foundation, and brought your hogs to a fair market.</Q> <BIBL>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>CTATOR, No. 595.</BIBL></P></NOTE></P>
<P>THERE must, doubtless, be imagination in the manner of expression; but, above all, there must be truth and judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="032455_0125_0FF26B0DC867E2D0"/>
THE image is false, when there is a contra∣diction of terms: as in that phrase, <Q>I shall ascend to the foundation of the Cartesian system.</Q> It is incoherent, when it describes, on one side, a physical substance, and on the other, a moral subject: such is that parenthe∣sis, <Q>I say then (and I always continue fixed upon my principles.)</Q> It is puerile and far-fetched, whenever it forms an affected and unusual periphrasis: as when sun-dials have been called "the registers of the sun." But it becomes descriptive and just, when it is expressed with simplicity and energy. It is thus that Bossuet describes the demands of luxury, when he says, that <Q>every art is ex∣hausted (literally sweats) to satisfy them.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To avoid such improprieties as those mentioned by our author, it is of importance to bear in mind, what Dr. BLAIR says on this subject: <Q>A good rule has been given for examining the propriety of Metaphors, when we doubt whether or not they be of the mixed kind; namely, that we should try to form a picture upon them, and consider how the parts would agree, and what sort of figure the whole would present, when delineated with a pencil. By these means, we should become sensible whether inconsistent circumstances were mixed, and a monstrous image thereby pro∣duced; or whether the object was, all along, presented in one natural and consistent point of view.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> vol. i. p. 311.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN Bossuet makes use of a Metaphor which seems bold, he sometimes apologises; and presently he rises upon that description, which he does not find sufficiently great nor daring.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="032455_0126_0FF26BADEEA7BDA8"/>
"Shall I speak to you," says he in the fu∣neral Oration for Maria Theresa, <Q>shall I speak to you concerning the death of her children? Let us figure to ourselves that young Prince, whom the graces themselves appear to have formed with their hands. Forgive me this expression: methinks I still behold this flower falling. At that time the sorrowful messenger of an event so fatal, I was also the witness, when behold∣ing the King and Queen, of the most pierc∣ing grief on the one hand, and, on the other, of the most mournful lamentations; and under different forms I saw an un∣bounded affliction.</Q></P>
<P>AN idea which would be common, were it not for the boldness of the imagination which sometimes gives sensation to inanimate beings, becomes interesting under the pencil of an Orator or a Poet.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, I know, hath less extensive privileges than Poetry. The latter is ex∣empted, according to the judicious observation of Boileau, from all the set forms of excuse to which Prose is subjected: e. g. <Q>Pardon this expression;—so to speak;—if I may venture to say so,</Q> &amp;c. We often find, however, in excellent Orators, Metaphors which we should be scrupulous about hazard∣ing in verse. Those figures are so transfused
<PB N="116" REF="032455_0127_0FF26B65317A5220"/>through the style, that they are scarcely ob∣served in the perusal.</P>
<P>RACINE was, doubtless, struck with that expression in the sermon <Q>on the mixture of the righteous and the wicked,</Q> where MASSILLON says, <Q>the righteous man can with boldness condemn in others, that which he disallows in himself; <HI>his instruc∣tions do not put his conduct to the blush;</HI></Q> as he had expressed his admiration of that other Metaphor, which is in the same discourse; <Q><HI>the Courtiers of Zedekiah charged the tears and dismal predictions of Jeremiah,</HI> occasioned by the ruin of Jerusalem, <HI>with a secret desire of pleasing the king of Babylon,</HI> who was be∣sieging sieging that unfortunate city.</Q></P>

IT is not to excite astonishment by the display of his learning, that he speaks to an assembled multitude; it is to move, it is to affect them; and he mistakes his object, if he prefer those abstract and intellectual expres∣sions, which the vulgar do not comprehend, to those tender and ardent ones, which pro∣duce a general impression.</P>
<P>A CHRISTIAN Orator is under still stronger obligation to address his hearers with that simplicity of style, without which he will never be truly eloquent. All men are bound to practise the duties of religion; it is, there∣fore, requisite that all may be able to under∣stand the minister who announces them. But, let us once more repeat it, the discharge of zeal in this, as in every other part of a ser∣mon, is inseparable from the rules of art.</P>
<P>Is it your desire to be eloquent? Be sim∣ple. I go farther—Be familiar in your discourses.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Youth," says M. ROLLIN, <Q>cannot be made too sensible of the character of simplicity which runs through the writings of the ancients. They should be accustomed to study nature in all things, and be assured that the best eloquence is that which is the most natural, and least far-fetched.

<P>"A writer of simplicity," says Dr. BLAIR, <Q>expresses himself in such a manner, that every one thinks he could have written in the same way; Horace describes it:</Q></P>
<P>—Ut sibi quivis</P>
<P>Sperèt idem, sudet multum, frustraque laboret</P>
<P>Ausus idem.</P>
<P><Q>There are no mari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of art in his expression; it seems the very language of nature; you see in the style, not the writer and his labour, but the man, in his own natural character. He may be rich in his expression; he may be full of figures, and of fancy; but these flow from him without effort; and he appears to write in this manner, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because he has studied it, but because it is the manner of expression most natural to him. This is the great advantage of simplicity of style, that, like simplicity of manners, it shews us a man's sentiments and turn of mind laid open with∣our disguise. More studied and artificial manners of writing, however beautiful, have always this disadvantage, that they ex∣hibit an author in form, like a man at court, where the splen∣dour of dress, and the ceremonial of behaviour, conceal those peculiarities which distinguish one man from another. But read∣ing an author of simplicity, is like conversing with a person of distinction at home, and with ease, where we find natural man∣ners, and a marked character.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 390.</BIBL></P>
<P>The same author elsewhere remarks, that <Q>the style which the pulpit requires must be very perspicuous.

<HEAD>SECTION XXXI. <HI>Of Dignity of Style.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS popular Elocution doth not, how∣ever, prohibit a Christian Orator from ever making use of elevated expressions.</P>
<P>NOTHING stands more opposed to the dig∣nity of the Ministry than mean words, inde∣cent allusions, or obscene representations.</P>
<P>CICERO descends to disgusting descriptions in his charges against Verres, and in relating the intemperance of Marc Antony.</P>
<P>MASSILLON, whose language is generally very guarded, has not paid sufficient respect to the decorum of the pulpit, in his eulogium of St. Agnes.</P>
<P>BOILEAU says, <Q>the Style the least ele∣vated hath still its elevation;</Q> much more
<PB N="120" REF="032455_0131_0FF26B6CD53A24A0"/>rhetorical Style, the most dignified, and, con∣sequently, the most difficult of all.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, in common with Poetry, has the happy privilege of embellishing its images with the noblest expressions, which, without this contrivance, could not belong to the Style of Oratory.</P>
<P>BOSSUET excels in that admirable talent of uniting the most familiar narrations to the dignity of his discourses; and he proves by his own example, that an able writer will always possess the art of adapting to the Style of Eloquence, whatever could be related in the freedom of conversation.</P>
<P>No excuse can, therefore, be any longer admitted in favour of those Orators, whose Style is mean, and grovelling, in relations much less common, than some of those which Bossuet has given us in his funeral Orations.

Thus the whole discourse is one; and may be reduced to one single proposition, set in the strongest light, by various views and explications of it. This unity of design shews the whole performance at one view: as in the public places of a city one may see all the streets and gates of it, when the streets are straight, equal and duly propor∣tioned.

<P><Q>An author, who does not thus methodise his discourse, is not fully master of his subject: he has but an imperfect taste, and a low genius. Order, indeed, is an excellence we seldom meet with in the productions of the mind. A discourse is perfect, when it has at once method, propriety, strength, and vehemence. But, in order to this, the Orator must have viewed, examined, and comprehended every point, that he may range each word in its proper place.

If there be any passage in the middle, or end, which might have stood in the beginning; or any in the beginning, which might have stood as well in the middle, or end; there is properly, in such a piece, neither be∣ginning, middle, nor end, it is a mere rhapsody, not a work; and, the more it assumes the air or appearance of a real work, the more ridiculous it becomes.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Characteristicks,</HI> vol. iii. p. 259, 260.</BIBL></P>
<P>Bishop BURNEY gives the following direction to Preachers.</P>
<P><Q>A text being explained, then the point, upon which the sermon is to run, is to be opened; and it will be the better heard and understood, if there be but one point in a sermon, so that one head, and only one, is well stated, and sully set out.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Discourse of the Pastoral Care,</HI> p. 249.</BIBL></P>
<P>Dr. BLAIR expands the Bishop's idea, and at the same time, gives it its proper bounds, when he says;</P>
<P><Q>Unity is of great consequence in every composition; but in other discourses, where the choice and direction of the subject are not left to the speaker, it may be less in his power to pre∣serve it. In a sermon it must be always the Preacher's own fault, if he transgress it. What I mean by unity, is, that there should be some one main point to which the whole strain of the sermon shall refer. It must not be a bundle of different subjects strung together, but one object must predominate throughout. This rule is founded on what we all experience, that the mind can attend only to one capital object at a time. By dividing, you always weaken the impression. Now this unity, without which no sermon can have much beauty, or much force, does not require that there should be no divisions or separate heads in the discourse, or that one single thought only should be, again and again, turned up to the hearers in different lights. It is not to be understood in so narrow a sense: it admits of some variety; it admits of under parts and appendages, provided always that so much union and connexion be preserved, as to make the whole concur in some one impression upon the mind. I may employ, for instance, several di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erent arguments to enforce the love of God; I may also enquire, perhaps, into the causes of the decay of this virtue; still one great object is presented to the mind; but if, because my text says, "He that loveth God must love his brother also," I therefore should mingle in one discourse argu∣ments for the love of God, and for the love of our neighbour, I should offend unpardonably against Unity, and leave a very loose and confused impression on the hearers' minds.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 108.</BIBL></P></NOTE>

<P>TRANSITIONS, which are only built on the mechanism of the style, and merely consist in a fictitious connexion between the last word of the paragraph which finishes, and the first word of the sentence which begins, cannot, with propriety, be admitted as natur∣al, but are rather forced combinations. True rhetorical Transitions are such as follow the course of the reasoning, or sentiment, with ease, almost without art, and unperceived by

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIII. <HI>Of a copious Style.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF a desultory style, if short expressions, in a word, if poor ideas can never strictly unite, let us discard them, without hesitation, from a rhetorical discourse. A broken and
<PB N="125" REF="032455_0136_0FF26BBB936C4658"/>sententious style will never make powerful impressions upon the multitude. Eloquence requires a kind of diction, expanded, lofty, sublime, in order to develope the emotions of the soul, and to impart to thought all its en∣ergy. He who renews his thoughts line by line, is always frigid, slow, monotonous, and superficial. Sublimity is simply the effort of genius transcending ordinary ideas. Let your thoughts dive deep. Stop not to pick up the sparkling grains of sand upon that ground which covers a mine of gold. Shoot beyond vulgar conceptions; and you will find the true sublime, between that which is common, and that which is exaggerated. Unconstrain∣ed in your steps, confine not yourself within the narrow limits of those curtailed phrases, which drop every moment with the expiring idea; but display in their vast extent, those copious and commanding modes of expres∣sion, which impart to Eloquence its energy, its elevation, its vehemence, and its grandeur.

<P>BUT, have we proper periods in our lan∣guage, who can scarcely ever make use of transposition; who are constrained to give a signification, if not perfect, at least very dis∣tinct, to each word of the sentence, which the reader peruses; who are subjected to uniform and feeble constructions, in which the nomi∣native is contiguous to the verb preceding the case governed; and who are perpetually em∣barrassed by the repetition or ambiguity of pronouns? The theory of our participles, too, is so obscure, our conjunctions are so insufficient, our cases, admitting we have any, so insignificant, that it becomes requisite, in writing, perpetually to recal the nominative, or the pronoun which represents it, and to sacrifice sublimity to perspicuity.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See remarks on the same subject in FENELON'S <HI>Letter to the French Academy,</HI> § 5, p. 193.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE ancients compared the period to a sling, which throws out the stone, after many circuits.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q>With respect to the form or composition of sentences, Cicero distinguishes them into two forts called <HI>tracta,</HI> strait or direct; and <HI>contorta,</HI> bent or winding.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orat. c. 20.</NOTE> By the former are meant such, whose members follow each other in a direct order, without any inflection; and by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tter, those which, strictly speaking, are called <HI>periods.

<P>Dr. WARD'S observations upon this point are as follow:</P>
<P><Q>There are two kinds of Order, in the construction of a sen∣tence, one of which may be called <HI>natural,</HI> and the other <HI>arti∣ficial.</HI> We call that order <HI>natural,</HI> when all the words in a sen∣tence are so placed, as they are connected with, or follow each other, in a grammatical construction. And it may properly enough admit of this name, as it is founded in the nature of a proposition, and the relation of the several words, of which it consists, to each other. And this seems agreeable to the natural way of conveying our thoughts which leads us first to express the subject, or thing, of which some other thing is said, before the predicate, or that which is said concerning it; and with respect to both, as every idea succeeds another in the order of our con∣ceptions, to range it in the same order, when we communicate them to others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our language in general keeps pretty much to this method. But in one thing, particularly, it recedes from it; and that is, in placing adjectives, which denote the properties of things, be∣fore their substantives or subjects, whose properties they are. As when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is said, <HI>Evil communication corrupts good manners.</HI> And this we always do, except something follows which depends upon the adjective. So we say, <HI>He was a man eminent for his virtue,</HI> not, <HI>an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent man.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Artificial order,</HI> as it respects simple sentences, has little or no regard to the natural construction of words; but disposes them in such a manner, as will be most agreeable to the ear, and best answer the design of the speaker. The Latins take a much greater liberty in this respect, than we do, or the nature of our language will permit. Quintilian says, it is best for the verb to stand last, when there is no particular reason to the contra∣ry; and he gives this reason for it, 'because the force of the sentence lies in the verb.' They likewise separate such words as have an immediate relation between them, or depend∣ance one upon another; and place any of them first or last, as they please. In short, their order seems in a manner arbi∣trary, if it does not break in upon perspicuity, to which they usually attend. But most of these things are unsuitable to the genius of our language. The Latin tongue commonly admits of a much greater var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety in the transpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion of members, as well as in that of single words, than suits with our idiom. Our com∣position is, this respect, much more limited and confined than the Latin. The natural order is certainly more plain and easy; but yet it must be owned, that the other has its advantages, and those very considerable. The language both of the Greeks and Romans has more strength, as well as harmony, than any modern tongue; which is owing, in a good measure, to this liberty in their composition. For by giving their periods the finest tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and placing the most significant words, where they may strike the mind with the greatest force, at the same time they both de∣light the ear, and excite the attention.</Q></P> <BIBL>WARD'S <HI>System of Oratory,</HI> vol. i. p. 354-364.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. BLAIR makes the following apposite remarks upon this subject.</P>
<P><Q>In the Latin language, the arrangement, which most com∣monly obtains, is, to place first, in the sentence, that word which expresses the principal object of the discourse, together with its circumstances; and afterwards, the person, or the thing, that acts upon it. Thus Sallust, comparing together the mind and the body; <HI>Animi imperi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>peris servitis, magis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> which order certainly renders the sentence more lively and striking, than when it is arranged according to our English construction; We make most use of the direction of the soul, and of the service of the body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Latin order gratifies more the rapidity of the imagination, which naturally runs first to that which is its chief object; and, having once named it, carries it in view throughout the rest of the sentence. In the same manner in poetry,</Q></P>
<L>Justum et tenacem propofiti viru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L>Non civium ardor prava jubentium,</L>
<L>Non vultus instantis tyranoi,</L>
<L>Mente quatit solida.—</L>
<P><Q>Every person of taste must be sensible, that here the words are arranged with a much greater regard to the figure which the several objects make in the fancy, than our English construction admits; which would require the <HI>Justum et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> propositi viru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> though undoubtedly, the capital object in the sentence, to be thrown into the last place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>An English writer, paying a compliment to a great man, would say thus: "It is impossible for me to pass over, in silence, such remarkable mildness, such singular and unheard of clemency, and such unusual moderation, in the exercise of supreme power." "Here, we have, first presented to us, the person who speaks. 'It is impossible for <HI>me;</HI> next, what that person is to do; impossible for him <HI>to pass over in silence;'</HI> and lastly, the object which moves him so to do, 'the mildness, clemency, and moderation of his patron.' Cicero, from whom I have translated these words, just reverses this order; beginning with the object, placing that first which was the exciting idea in the speaker's mind, and ending with the speaker and his action. <HI>Tantum mansuetudinem, tame inusitatam in auditamque clementia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tantumque in summa potestate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rum c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nium modum, tacitè multo [nullo] modo praeterire possum.</HI></Q> <BIBL>Orat. pro Marcell.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>The Latin order is more animated; the English more clear and distinct. The Romans generally arranged their words ac∣cording to the order in which the ideas rose in the speaker's imagination. We arrange them according to the order in which the understanding directs those ideas to be exhibited, in succes∣sion, to the view of another. Our arrangement, therefore, ap∣pears to be the consequence of greater refinement in the art of speech; as far as clearness in communication is understood to be the end of speech.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 119, and 121.</BIBL></P></NOTE></P>

<P>NEVERTHELESS, without this measure∣ment of periods, Style is flat and un∣harmonious. A Christian Orator should en∣deavour
<PB N="129" REF="032455_0140_0FF26B1E476E67A0"/>to please his auditors by a melody which may make them more attentive to his instructions, and thereby render the allure∣ments of art subservient to the success of his

<P>BOSSUET meant to intimate in the funeral Oration for Tellier, that that magistrate had breathed his last, while repeating this verse of the psalm, <Q>I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever;</Q> and see how the Orator recals, if I may so say, before all his auditory, this circumstance of the death of the Chan∣cellor: "Enraptured that he could pour forth his grateful acknowledgements even with his dying breath, he began the hymn of praise for divine mercies. <HI>I will sing,</HI> says he, <HI>of the mercies of the Lord forever.</HI> He expires while repeating these words, and continues singing with Angels the sacred song."</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="032455_0142_0FF26BC326334818"/>
IT is genius alone, which can form such excellent pictures, and the art of producing them is above rules; but, it is no less true, that rules of art are often useful to the Orator, in laying open to him the chief secrets of harmony.</P>
<P>NEVER conclude your sentences with monosyllables, unless they are sufficiently sonorous to strike the ear, and to assist the cadence of a period.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As an useful caution against the injudicious conclusion of sen∣timens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> monosyllables, we have this reflection: <Q>How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>greeable is the following sentence of an author, speaking of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nity! 'It is a mystery which we firmly be∣lieve the truth of, and humbly adore the depth of.' And how easily could it have been mended by this transposition! 'It is a mystery, the truth of which we firmly believe, and the depth of which we humbly adore.'

This, therefore, must be our first object, to make our meaning clearly and fully understood, and understood without the least difficulty. <HI>"Oratio,"</HI> says QUINTILIAN, <HI>"debet negligenter quoque andientibus esse aperta; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in animum audientis, sicut s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in cenios, etia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si in e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m non inten∣datur, occurrat.

Mankind are too indolent to relish so much labour. They may pretend to admire the author's depth, after they have discovered his meaning; but they will seldom be in∣clined to take up his work a second time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The great source of a loose style, in opposition to precision, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njudicious use of those words termed <HI>synonymous.</HI> They are so called, because they agree in expressing one principal idea; but, for the most part, if not always, they express it with some diversity in the circumstances. They are varied by some acces∣sory idea which every word introduces, and which forms the dis∣tinction between them. Hardly, in any language, are there two words that convey precisely the same idea, a person thoroughly conversant in the propriety of the language, will always be able to observe something that distinguishes them. As they are like different shades of the same colour, an accurate writer can em∣ploy them to great advantage, by using them so as to heighten and to finish the picture which he gives us. He supplies by one, what was wanting in the other, to the force, or to the lustre of the image which he means to exhibit. But, in order to this end, he must be extremely attentive to the choice which he makes of them. For the bulk of writers are very apt to confound them with each other; and to employ them carelessly, merely for the sake of filling up a period, or of rounding and diversifying the language, as if their signification were exactly the same, while, in truth, it is not. Hence a certain mist, and indistinctness, is unwarily thrown over style.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p, 185, 195.</BIBL></P>

IT is judgment, which points out the pro∣priety of the word; and it is the propriety of expression which renders it perspicuous. But, to give perspicuity to the ideas, it is requisite to be thoroughly informed. The writer, who is necessitated to learn while he composes, is generally obscure. He, on the contrary, who hath, during a length of time, brought his knowledge to maturity, becomes
<PB N="136" REF="032455_0147_0FF26ACC1A7020A0"/>sufficiently master of his subject, to banish from his style, ambiguity, double entendre, and declamation.</P>
<P>OBSCURITY proceeds from ignorance, when the expression is void of sense; from design, when it is far-fetched; from negligence, when the thought is confused; and from depravity of taste, when the word is more abstract than the idea. The style of sacred Eloquence ought to be clear, and, in some sort, trans∣parent. The rapidity of utterance, which never allows time for examination, requires in a sermon all the perspicuity of the most familiar language.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We should use," says FENELON, <Q>a simple, exact, easy style, that lays every thing open to the reader, and even prevents his attention. When an author writes for the public, he should take all the pains imaginable to prevent his reader's having any. All the labour should be his own; and he should leave nothing but pleasure and instruction to his readers. They should never be put to the trouble of finding out his meaning. None but those who deal in riddles are allowed to puzzle people. Augustus would rather have frequent repetitions used, than that there should be the least degree of obscurity in a discourse. Indeed the first care of one that writes only to be understood, is to ease his readers by expressing himself clearly.</Q> <BIBL>FENELON'S <HI>Letter to the French Academy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> v. p. 194.</BIBL>

<P>M. ROLLIN enforces the observations of M. MAURY, respect∣ing the importance of perspicuity in public speakers, when he says, <Q>It is a vicious taste in some Orators to imagine they have a great deal of understanding, when much is required to comprehend them. Such do not consider, that every discourse which wants an interpreter, is a very bad one. The supreme perfection of a speaker's style should be to please the unlearned, as well as the learned, by exhibiting an abundance of graces for the latter, and being very perspicuous for the former. St. Austin wrote at first against the Manichees, in a flowery and sublime style; whence his writings were unintelligible to those who had but a moderate share of learning, at least not without great difficulty. Upon this he was told, that if he desired to have his works more generally useful, he must write in the plain and common style, so as to be equally intelligible to the learned and the unlearned. The holy father received this advice with his usual humility, and made prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use of it in the books he afterwards wrote against the here∣tics, and in his sermons. His example ought to be the standard of all those who are to instruct others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As obscurity is the fault which the preacher must chiefly avoid, and that his auditors are not allowed to interrupt him, when they meet with any thing obscure, St. Austin advises him to read in the eyes and countenances of his auditors, whether they under∣stand him or not; and to repeat the same, thing by giving it dif∣ferent turns, till he perceives he is understood.</Q> <BIBL>ROLLIN'S <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> vol. ii. c 3, § 4, p. 305—307.</BIBL></P>
<P>Dr. WARD ascribes Obscurity chiefly to the three following causes: First, all ambiguity of expression, arising from the differ∣ent senses in which a word is capable of being taken. Again, Obscurity is occasioned either by too short and concise a manner of speaking, or by sentences too long and prolix. And a third cause of obscurity he states to be parenthesis, when it is either too long, or too frequent. He gives examples under each head.

<P>SUCH strokes enliven a sermon, and leave, in the mind of the auditor, an indelible impression. The more they are multiplied in a discourse, the higher we soar above those diffuse writers, whose productions, being destitute of genius, are a mere collection of common places.</P>
<P>BY common places, I mean, here, loose details equally applicable to all subjects: for every subject has its common places, which will become apposite and peculiar, in the mouth of an energetic and original Orator.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="032455_0151_0FF26BCE0C07AE70"/>
ENTER a church in the middle of a sermon: if, in a minute, you do not discern the drift of the discourse; if you be obliged to wait to the end of a division, in order to penetrate the design of the preacher, pronounce con∣fidently, that he wanders in a labyrinth of common places; that he hath not composed through inspiration; and that he labours hard to make up, by the redundancy of words, for the sterility of ideas.</P>
<P>WHAT, then, will you discover in his in∣exhaustible loquacity? disgusting repetitions, or extravagant conceptions; plagiarisms or imitations; an incurable facility of uttering expressions, which always leave the mind empty; pitiful proofs of a beggarly medi∣ocrity, from which nothing can be expected; and discourses, of which all the contents were known before they were heard.</P>
<P>HENCE arise those frequent enumerations, which are only a redundancy of words, some∣times as dazzling in the delivery, as they are insipid in the perusal. Such puerile figures have been, for a long time, applauded by a great many hearers, who regarded, as the noblest effort of human genius, the mechanical talent of collecting, into one period, accumulated substantives, crouded epithets, rapid contradictions, unexpected antitheses, trivial or unnatural metaphors, repetitions
<PB N="141" REF="032455_0152_0FF1D8B42D7EA310"/>re-echoed, abundance of synonymous words, symmetry of combinations, and unceasing contrasts.</P>
<P>BUT, it hath been at length understood, that this tiresome prating was not true elo∣quence, and it is now become disgustful.</P>

<P>CONNECTED arguments imprint them∣selves more easily on the memory, than those collections of words, which are destitute of ideas; and, especially, when the progress of Eloquence is advanced by a combination of proofs.</P>

<P><PB N="142" REF="032455_0153_0FF26BD1D36B5BF8"/>
A SUDDEN stroke is merely a hasty sally; if it be well prepared, it becomes a sublime movement.</P>
<P>MAY I be permitted to render my idea more familiar by a comparison?—You walk by yourself, in the fields, on a summer's day. You give scope successively to a variety of thoughts, with which the view of the coun∣try, and the silence of nature, inspire you. When your mind is thus wholly engaged with these pleasing reveries, all of a sudden you hear thunder which crashes at a distance. This noise at first alarms you. In the mean time, the sky is serene, the air is calm, all is tranquil about you; and this first impression of terror is soon erased from your memory. But, when the horizon lowers, and is covered with dark clouds; when the sun disappears; when the hurricane rolls whirlwinds of dust; when the lightning flashes; when the atmos∣phere is inflamed; and when the thunder af∣terwards roars over your head; you will be alarmed; and your mind, prepared by gra∣dual emotions, will then have a more lively sensation of the violence of the shock arising from such continued perturbation. It is the same with Eloquence. Through a multitude of adventitious ideas, the mind must be gra∣dually prepared to participate in all the tran∣ports of passion or terror, of joy or grief, of
<PB N="143" REF="032455_0154_0FF26C1BB3CC19F0"/>love or indignation, with which you yourself are agitated. The impression too soon wears off, if the heart be not sufficiently mollified to enable it to penetrate without meeting with opposition.</P>
<P>DOTH Bossuet intend to give you a high idea of the courage, with which the queen of England struggled against all her misfortunes? His relations, were they introduced even without art, would astonish you; but, when ushered in by this sublime image, they trans∣port you: <Q>Like a column, whose solid mass appears the firmest support of a ruinous temple, when that lofty edifice which it sustains rests upon it without overthrowing it; thus the queen discovers herself to be the firm support of the state, when, after having for a long time borne its weight, she is not even bowed down under its fall.</Q> Your mind, struck with this spectacle which the Orator had the art of representing before you, beholds the queen of England constantly raised above her adversities; and your imag∣ination is continually describing to itself this column, which remains standing in the midst of the ruins with which it is surrounded.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XL. <HI>Of Oratorial Precautions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BESIDES those preparations, which tend to set off excellent ideas to advantage, there are also precautions, which Orators ought not to neglect. Precautions of modesty, with a view to conciliate the good-will, or confidence, of their auditory: Precautions of complaisance, in order to apologize for ideas, which would appear too bold if they bluntly thwarted the prejudices intended to be op∣posed: Precautions of prudence: Appear as if you dared not accuse your hearers of cer∣tain exces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, of which they are but too cul∣pable, and which the remorse of their con∣sciences affect still more than the reproaches of your zeal. <Q>When you make known unpalatable truths,</Q> says Cicero, <Q>it is proper that you seem to do it with reluct∣ance:</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si quid persequare acri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ut invitus et coactus facere vidcare. <BIBL><HI>Cic. de Orat. lib. ii. § 182, p. 62.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> Precautions of decency: Throw a veil over particulars, to which you ought to refer, without too minutely investigating them. Bossuet does not chuse to say in direct terms, in his funeral oration for the queen of England, that Charles I. died upon a scaffold; but, to recal that event, he makes an inge∣nious
<PB N="145" REF="032455_0156_0FF26B2D73C069C0"/>application; he contents himself with causing the queen to adopt those words of the prophet Jeremiah, who, alone, he says, is capable of equalling his lamentations to his calamities. <Q>O Lord, behold my affliction, for the enemy hath magnified himself. The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all my pleasant things: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. The kingdom is polluted, and the princes thereof. For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me:</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lam.</HI> i. 9, 16, and ii. 2.</NOTE> Precautions of judgment: Write agreeably to, and some∣times in a style different from, your peculiar talent. Is it the pathetic which characterizes you? Guard against languor and monotony. Doth energy please you? Avoid obscurity and bombast. Observe the extreme, towards which your mind inclines, and endeavour to shun it: Precautions in the cadences of sentences; and particularly, in beginning paragraphs. The auditor forms his opinion of you when∣ever the conclusion of your periods leaves him a moment's pause; and his attention re∣laxes if you neglect to terminate your com∣positions with luminous ideas, or striking images: in a word, precautions of courage,
<PB N="146" REF="032455_0157_0FF26B062E8410D8"/>occasioned by subjects which present difficul∣ties, where you are attended to with an equal mixture of eagerness and severity.</P>
<P>THROW yourself, at once, into the midst of the danger, that you may the better display the resources of your genius, and make your attack while put upon your defence. This risk, to which the Orator exposes himself, imparts to Eloquence a glow of enthusiasm, which raises him superior to his usual exer∣tions. It then happens to him,— may I be forgiven this comparison? as to the soldier who said, while passing under the citadel of Namur, the day following the assault, <Q>Yes∣terday I stormed this rock in the midst of fire, and to-day I should not be able to mount it.</Q> "I firmly believe it", replied one of his comrades, <Q>nor can I—there is no more any firing against us.</Q></P>

<P>IT is evident, that on such hazardous occa∣sions, the great business of an Orator con∣sists in omitting no precautions, and in adding energy to art.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="032455_0158_0FF26AC41A2EAEB8"/>
IT is an excellent method to make choice of a proper and ingenious circumlocution to convey the meaning of what cannot be so well expressed. The Hypothesis is a figure well adapted to yield this resource to Eloquence. Cicero often uses it in his Orations, and espe∣cially in those against Verres, where he is every moment forming suppositions more striking than the facts, with a view to render the exactions of Verres odious to the people of Rome.</P>
<P>BOSSUET, whom I am pepetually quoting, because I know not a better model, hath made an admirable use of Hypothesis, in his fune∣ral Oration for Tellier. <Q>Sleep on, ye rich men of the earth, and remain in your native dust. Ah! if some ages—what do I say? if, some years after your death, ye may be∣come men forgotten in the midst of the world, ye should hasten to enter into your tombs, that ye may not behold your names tarnished, your memories extinguished, and your foresight deceived in your friends and dependants, and still more, in your heirs and children.

<HEAD>SECTION XLII. <HI>Of Egotism of Style.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET us reckon also amongst oratorical precautions, a studied attention never to speak about oneself in the pulpit.</P>
<P>FLECHIER,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>What is most distinguishable in M. Flechier, is a purity of diction, elegance of style, rich and florid expressions, beautiful thoughts, a prudent vivacity of imagination, and the consequence of it, that is, a wonderful art in painting objects, and making them, as it were, sensible and obvious. But then, I think a kind of monotony and uniformity runs through all his writings; he has every where almost the same turns, the same figures, the same method. The antithesis, engrosses very near all his thoughts, and often enervates, by an endeavour to embellish them.</Q>
<BIBL>ROLLIN'S <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> B. iii. c. 11, vol. ii. p. 39.</BIBL></NOTE> who, in the composition of his funeral Oration for Turenne, stands in the foremost rank of Orators, although he do not delineate the excellent character of his hero in private life, and his discourse be, in other respects, far inferior to the chief per∣formances of Bossuet, affords us, in a letter which is prefixed to his funeral Orations, a singular example of egotism and vanity. He draws his own portrait in this letter; and one would imagine that he is sending to his friend the materials for a panegyric; or rath∣er, it is a complete eulogium, in which he forms sparkling antitheses from the recital and contrast of his various merits. See how Fle∣chier
<PB N="149" REF="032455_0160_0FF26C1D63217438"/>describes himself in this passage: he tells us, that <Q>he hath a sort of genius capa∣ble of executing whatever he undertakes; his style is nature approaching to art, and art resembling nature. Nothing can be added to what he writes, without super∣fluity, nor retrenched without removing something necessary. He can scatter some grains of odoriferous incense to refresh, and yet not overpower; but he accepts of none which are not equally pure with those which he bestows. There is discernible in his eyes a certain something corresponding with his genius. After all, it would be better if he could inure himself to study, and if his memory, somewhat treacherous, without however being unfaithful, were equally serviceable to him as his genius. But there is no perfection in the world, and every one hath his weak side.</Q> It were to be wished, for the honour of Flechier, that posterity had confirmed this judgment, which he passed upon himself.</P>
<P>IT is, without doubt, an unnecessary ap∣prehension, that a Christian Orator could ever suffer himself to advance, in the pulpit, an egotism so preposterous. It is always dan∣gerous speak about oneself before a large assembly. We are even careful to avoid this absurdity in small companies; and it appears
<PB N="150" REF="032455_0161_0FF26BDB8595D328"/>to me, that it was owing to good taste, as much as to Christian humility, that the word <HI>I</HI> was banished from the writings of Port-Royal.</P>
<P>THE Abbé de Fleury says, that the Histo∣rian should himself be kept out of view in his narration, <Q>so that the reader may not have leisure to reflect, whether the facts re∣corded be written well or ill; whether they be written at all; whether he have a book in his hands; whether there be an author in the world. It is thus that Homer wrote.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>What the amiable FENELON says of poets, and which he strengthens with the sanction of Plato's judgment, may, with equal propriety, be applied to historians: <Q>The poems of Homer and Virgil are full of a noble simplicity; their art is entirely con∣cealed; nature itself appears in all that they say. We do not find a single word, that seems purposely designed to shew the poet's wit. They thought it their greatest glory never to ap∣pear, but to employ our attention on the objects they describe; as a painter endeavours to set before your eyes wide forests, mountains, rivers, distant views, and buildings; or the adven∣tures, actions, and different passions, of men, in such a lively manner, that you cannot trace the masterly strokes of his pencil, for art look, mean and coarse when it is perceived. Plato, who hath thoroughly examined this matter, assures us, that in com∣posing, the Poet [so also the Historian or Preacher] should al∣ways keep out of sight, make himself to be quite forgotten by his readers, and represent, only those things and persons which he would set before their eyes.</Q></P> <BIBL>FENELON'S <HI>Dialogues concerning Eloquence,</HI> p. 63.</BIBL>
<P>Mr. KNOX tells us, that his <Q>opinion coincides with that of the best judges of antiquity, that the diction of the historian should not be such, either in the construction or selection of words, as to allure the attention of the reader from the facts to the words, from the hero to the writer.</Q> The same author condemns <Q>some of the most popular historians of France, who have violated the gravity and dignity of the historic page, by perpetual at∣tempts to be witty." And he adds, "though the works of such may afford pleasure, it is not such as results from legitimate history. The writer evidently labours to display himself, and his own ingenuity: but it is one great secret in the art of writing, that the writer should keep himself out of sight, and cause the ideas, which he means to convey, fully to engross the reader's attention. They cannot indeed otherwise produce their proper effect. If there are any readers, who choose to have the writer present to their view, rather than the matter which he writes, they may be said to resemble those spectators, who go to the theatre, rather to see and hear a favourite actor, than to attend to the persons of the drama. It is not Shakespear's Hamlet, or Lear, whom they admire, but some name which stands in rubric characters on the walls, and in the play bills.</Q></P>

THERE are occasions, however, when an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ator becomes himself the subject of an argument, which interests the public, and when he may speak of himself, without being per∣sonal. Where can I find a better example to illustrate this precept, than in the following passage of Fontenelle, in his treatise <Q>of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Happiness;</Q> (a work written with distin∣guished and vast precision:) <Q>It is necessary, first of all, to investigate the pretensions of that which boasts of contributing to our happiness. Wherefore is this dignity I am pursuing so necessary for me?—It is so that I may have the pre-eminence before others. But wherefore should this be necessary?—
<PB N="153" REF="032455_0164_0FF26AD9B390BEA0"/>That I may receive their respect and hom∣age. But of what service to me is this homage and respect?—They will very much caress me. But in what estimation can I hold those caresses, which are paid to my dignity, and not to myself?</Q></P>
<P>IN thus making application to himself of a general maxim, the Christian Orator reasons in the name of his auditory. All other egot∣ism is forbidden him.</P>
<P>BOSSUET affects me when he speaks of his white hairs.

<P>WHAT I am chiefly pleased with, and admire in Bourdaloue, is, his keeping himself out of sight; that, with a style too often sacrificed to declamation, he never strains Christian duties, never converts simple
<PB N="154" REF="032455_0165_0FF26BDD3B8409C8"/>advices into positive precepts, but his morality is such as can always be reduced to practice. It is the inexhaustible fertility of his plans which are never alike, and the happy talent of arranging his arguments with that order of which Quintilian speaks, when he compares the merit of an Orator, who composes a dis∣course, to the skill of a general, who com∣mands an army;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Est velut Imperatoria virtus. <HI>Instit. 2.</HI></NOTE> it is that accurate and forcible logic, which excludes sophisms, con∣tradictions, paradoxes; it is the art with which he establishes our duty upon our in∣terest, and that valuable secret, which I sel∣dom see, but in his sermons, of converting the recital of conversations into proofs of his subject; it is that redundancy of genius, which, in his discourses leaves nothing far∣ther to be supposed, although he composed at least two, often three, sometimes even four sermons on the same subject, without our even knowing, after having read them, to which to give the preference; it is the sim∣plicity of a style, nervous and affecting, nat∣ural and noble; the profoundest knowledge of religion; the admirable use which he makes of the Scriptures, and of the Fathers; these are the talents, which never permit me to think of this great man, without saying to myself, <Q>See then, to what an elevation genius may be raised, when it is invigorated by

Massillon has more grace, more sentiment, and, in my opinion, every way more genius.

<HEAD>SECTION XLIV. <HI>Of Massillon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS rival MASSILLON seldom hath sublime strokes; but if he be inferior in his peculiar fame as an Orator, he is, doubtless,
<PB N="156" REF="032455_0167_0FF26B2812BECC30"/>of the first rank as a writer. No one has carried the excellence of style to a higher degree of perfection. He attended to this branch of Eloquence to the latest period of his life.</P>
<P>THERE were found in his port-folio, after his death, twelve transcripts of his sermons, which he revised with unwearied pains after his advancement to the episcopacy, and which of course, have never been delivered from the pulpit, such as we now read them.</P>
<P>MASSILLON retained in his old age all the purity of his taste, although he had lost the vivacity of his imagination. He then em∣ployed himself much more upon the style than upon the main points of his discourses; but he was always unwilling to revise his course of <HI>Lent Sermons,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fr.</HI> son peti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Carêm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> which he had writ∣ten at first with much care; and I do not mean to attack the glory of the immortal Massillon, I intend, on the contrary, to ren∣der him fresh homage, in boldly advancing, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, which has for a long time been quoted as his chief work, appears to me one of his feeblest rhetorical productions.</P>
<P>MASSILLON'S plans are all alike; and, be∣sides this sameness which is so perceptible, when we read his sermons in succession, he generally confines himself to combat excuses,
<PB N="157" REF="032455_0168_0FF26AED34CF2E28"/>and perhaps does not sufficiently search be∣forehand into the bottom of his subjects.</P>
<P>HE was born with very great talents for Eloquence; but, he was not sufficiently stu∣dious in his youth. He depended too much upon his quickness of parts; and we may say respecting him, what the Roman Orator said of Piso, <Q>As much as he withheld from application, so much he diminished his glory.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quantum detraxit ex studio, tantum amisit è gloriâ. <HI>BRUTUS, 236.</HI></NOTE> Yes, it is my admiration of him; it is my reading him over and over, every day, with delight, that emboldens me to apply to him the charge, which Cardinal de Retz brought against the great Condé, when he blames him for <Q>not having merited all that he might.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Memoirs,</HI> vol. i.</NOTE></P>
<P>How superior would Massillon really have been to himself, were all his sermons as elo∣quent and perfect as his "Ecclesiastical Con∣ferences;" his discourses "on the Forgive∣ness of Enemies;" "on the death of a Sinner;" "on Confession;" "on the Di∣vinity of Jesus Christ;" "on the Mixture of the Righteous and the Wicked;" his homily "of the Prodigal Son," &amp;c! In these we have Massillon's most masterly perform∣ances; it is here we discover all his genius;
<PB N="158" REF="032455_0169_0FF26BDEE370A1C0"/>while we regret that he hath not bestowed more time upon the composition of his other works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Dr. Dodd published a translation of Massillon's ser∣mons preached before Louis XV. during his minority.

<P>THIS excellent writer, misled by his co∣piousness, frequently fails in not sufficiently enriching his beautiful style with ideas; and he would unquestionably lose much of his celebrity, were he to be judged according to this maxim of Fenelon; <Q>a good discourse is that from which nothing can be retrenched without cutting into the quick.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Letter upon Eloquence.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>MASSILLON'S arguments are sometimes des∣titute of regularity, of energy, perhaps even of the solidity which he was so capable of giving them.</P>
<P>COULD it be believed, that, in his sermon "on the Certainty of a future State," which is, in other respects, full of beauty and energy, Massillon seriously refutes, and more than once, the frivolous objection, that another state of existence is incredible, because no one ever returned from it? The French Ora∣tor, so styled by way of pre-eminence, Bossu∣et, hath also deigned to take notice of this
<PB N="159" REF="032455_0170_0FF26B3BA4DF1A28"/>plea of sinners, who would call for miracu∣lous apparitions, not to convince them of the soul's immortality, but to determine their conversion. One expression at the close of the funeral Oration for Queen Henrietta (the most pathetic of all his discourses) suffices him to confute, by a sublime stroke, this ab∣surd demand. It were to be wished, that Massillon had often copied this boldness of the pencil! <Q>Do we expect God to raise the dead in order to instruct us? It is by no means necessary that the dead return, nor that any one rise out of the grave; that which to day descends into the tomb might be sufficient to convert us.</Q></P>

<DIV2 N="45" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION XLV. <HI>Of Saurin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE sometimes discover such passages after the manner of Bossuet, in the sermons of the Pastor SAURIN, whom we ought to insert at the head of Preachers of the second class.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Among the French Protestant Divines, SAURIN is the most distinguished: he is copious, eloquent, and devout, though too ostentatious in his manner.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 120.</BIBL>
<P>The sermons of the late Rev. C. CHAIS, preached at the French church at the Hague, have also considerable merit in pulpit elo∣quence.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="032455_0171_0FF26BE71E408990"/>
THE first part of his discourses generally consists of a commentary upon his text. In my opinion, all his critical discussions upon history, grammar, or chronology, are ex∣tremely different from E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oquence.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the shew of erudition, with which Saurin imposes on so many of his readers, ought not to be held of any account, even if all this scientific dress were not mistimed, in∣asmuch as it is no very difficult task to copy commentators, or to translate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>issertations.</P>
<P>ON this account, therefore, when you read Saurin, do not stop short at any of the first parts of his discourses. This manner of writ∣ing, which, at the beginning of this century, was called "the Refugeé style," has been charged against him on substantial grounds. He uses a translation of the Bible, which was made immediately after the separation of the Protestant churches; and this old language, contrasted with his modern Eloquence, im∣parts to his style a savage and barbarous air. I might quote examples, if his sermons were not so diffuse.</P>
<P>SAURIN, however, writes with ardour and vehemence. He doth not make an ostenta∣tions show of wit; he doth not lose sight of his auditory; he forcibly urges his argu∣ments; he knows when to insist upon them; he is moved, and he inflames. He hath the
<PB N="161" REF="032455_0172_0FF26C2BB819ADD8"/>merit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing a natural Orator: and, he would have acquired the taste in which he is deficient, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had joined, to the study of examples, the residence of Paris.</P>
<P>No Christian Orator, after Bossuet, (to whom there can be none compared when speaking of Pulpit-Eloquence) hath laboured more carefully or successfully the perorations of his discourses. In them, Saurin always recalled the idea of death. This object ren∣ders them as solemn as they are affecting. They commonly consist of repetitions; and this return of the same set of expressions is very proper, when making the application of a sermon to the different classes of hearers. It is by this figure, that he recapitulates his proofs; and then he points to the open grave, as if the listening congregation, ready to de∣scend into it, were not thenceforward to hear any other instruction, or rather, as if he him∣self were preaching for the last time.</P>
<P>THE sermons of Saurin, <Q>on the wisdom of Solomon,</Q> and <Q>on the discourse of St. Paul to Felix and Drusilla,</Q> appear to me the master-pieces of this Orator.</P>
<P>IT is commonly supposed, that he never allowed himself to make use of declamations against the church of Rome; but I appre∣hend that fanaticism cannot break out more passionately, than in his sermons on <Q>the
<PB N="162" REF="032455_0173_0FF26BEF57969300"/>dedication of the church of Woorburg;</Q> on "the afflictions of the church;" on "the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> incomprehensibility of God;" on <Q>the fast; observed before the campaign of 1706.</Q></P>
<P>SAURIN is transformed. He rises to the level of Demosthenes, when he speaks of the emigration of the Protestants; above all, when he thunders against Louis XIV. He is never more eloquent, nor more sublime, than when wasting his fury against this mon∣arch, whose name perpetually recurs in his discourses, and, principally, in the sermons, which I am about to quote.</P>
<P>THIS apostrophe is well known; <Q>and thou formidable Prince, whom I once hon∣oured as my king, and whom I still regard as the scourge of the Lord,</Q> &amp;c. Saurin finishes this passage by saying, that he for∣gives Louis XIV; but he does not attempt to impress this insulting moderation on the minds of the people of Holland. It is, per∣haps, in the pulpit of Saurin, where have been fabricated the arms of Hochstet, of Malpla∣quet, and Ramillies; and where that impla∣cable resentment hath been produced, which presided at the conferences of Gertruidemberg.</P>
<P>NEVER did an Orator conceive any thing more daring than the dialogue of Saurin be∣tween God and his auditory, in his sermon "on the fast of 1706." "My people," saith
<PB N="163" REF="032455_0174_0FF26AF0777A4928"/>the most High <Q>my people, what have I done unto thee?" "Ah, Lord! how ma∣ny things hast thou done unto us!—the ways of Zion covered with mourning," &amp;c. Answer, and hear witness here against the Eternal.</Q></P>
<P>THE long enumeration of the afflictions of the Protestants, which precedes these last words, gives them an energy, which causes one to tremble, at the very moment when Saurin pauses, in order to vindicate the ways of Providence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Translation of select Sermons of Saurin, by ROBINSON; in which the animated passage re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred to by M. Maury, is thus rendered; <Q>Say now, in the presence of heaven and earth, what ills hath God inflicted on you. O my people, what have I done unto thee? Ah, Lord! how many things hast thou done to us! Draw near ye mourning ways of Zion, ye desolate gates of Jeru∣salem, ye sighing priests, ye afflicted virgins, ye deserts peopled with captives, ye disciples of Jesus Christ, wandering over the face of the whole earth, children torn from your parents, prisons filled with confessors, galleys freighted with martyrs, blood of our countrymen, shed like water, carcasses, once the venerable habita∣tion of witnesses for religion, now thrown out to savage beasts and birds of prey, ruins of our churches, dust, ashes, sad remains of houses ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cated to our God, fires, racks, gibbets, punishments, till now, unknown; draw nigh hither, and give evidence against the Lord.</Q>

<P>IN his sermon "on the contempt of life," he falls into a digression, which, at first, ap∣pears whimsical, but which presently intro∣duces a sublime passage. <Q>An author has published a book with a very singular title; this title is <HI>Rome subterranean;</HI> a title full
<PB N="164" REF="032455_0175_0FF26BF0F8D0FBA0"/>of instruction and truth, teaching that Rome which strikes the senses, that there is another Rome of dead people, another Rome under ground, a natural image of that, which liv∣ing Rome must one day be. My brethren, I present unto you this day a similar object; I present unto you your Republic, not such as you see it, composed of sovereigns, of generals, of the heads of families; this is merely the surface of your Repblic. But I would describe before you the interior, the Republic subterranean—for there is another Republic under your feet, Descend there —survey those sepulchres which are in the heart of the earth. Let us lift up the stone. Whom do we see there?—My God! what in∣habitants! what citizens! what a republic!</Q></P>
<P>THE same Orator who wrote this passage so full of vivacity and enthusiasm, sometimes suffered his genius to cool, and then he adopted the forms of expression, which are used in solving geometrical problems.</P>
<P>WE even find in one of his discourses a pretty long arithmetical calculation; it is, I believe, the only example of this sort, which the Eloquence of the pulpit affords.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. PRIESTLEY, in his funeral discourse on the death of Dr. PRICE, introduces a pretty singular calculation and idea, founded upon the supposition of the soul's sleeping betwixt death and the resurrection: <Q>Supposing the amount of the expectation of life to be in my case, as I find, about fourteen years, in many of you not more than half that number, and at the most not much more than twenty, in those whose age admitted of any long acquaintance with him; and the interval betwixt the time of our death and that of our resurrection to be nothing at all, because not perceived by us, it is in effect only fourteen, or about twenty, years that we expect to be separated from him; and in this life we often pass more time without seeing those whom we most respect.</Q>

<P>YES, I shall be able, without doubt, to comprehend this scale of mortality, while ascertaining the combination of Saurin at leisure; in a book, wherein I can trace them at sight: but how shall I lay hold of these arithmetical deductions in a pulpit, where the rapidity of the delivery admits of no abstract mental operations?</P>
<P>THIS singular calculation ought not, there∣fore, to find room in a sermon, solely intend∣ed to be preached in a church.</P>

<PB N="167" REF="032455_0178_0FF26C2F469424A0"/>acknowledges, that fifty years after the day wherein he speaks, there will still remain upon the earth seventy of his hearers: now, however little we may know of the human heart, we apprehend, that there was not, per∣haps, one individual of these eighteen hun∣dred persons, who did not flatter himself with being of this small number, and, consequent∣ly, who did not regard death as still at too great a distance to hasten his conversion.</P>

<P>Mr. HUME expressly acknowledges,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treatise upon Eloquence, chap. vii.</NOTE> that England hath made less improvement in this kind of Eloquence, than in the other branches of literature. In fact, although this nation hath produced some eloquent writers, at the head of whom we ought to reckon the immor∣tal RICHARDSON;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>The most moral of all our novel writers is RICHARDSON; a writer of excellent intentions, and of very considerable capacity and genius,</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 309.</BIBL>
<P><Q>RICHARDSON, besides being a great genius, was a truly good man in all respects. He was pious, virtuous, exemplary, bene∣volent, friendly, generous, and humane to an uncommon degree; glad of every opportunity of doing good offices to his fellow crea∣tures in distress, and relieving many without their knowledge, His chief delight was doing good. His three great works were intitled "Pamela, or Virtue rewarded;" "The History of Clarissa Harlowe;" and "The History of Sir Charles Grandi∣son. "Dr. Johnson styles him "an author from whom the age has received great favours, who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the passions to move at the command of virtue." Mr. Sherlock, the traveller, observes that "Rich∣ardson is admirable for every species of delicacy; for delicacy of wit, sentiment, language, action, every thing. His genius was immense. His views were grand. His soul was noble, and his heart was excellent. He formed a plan that embraced all hu∣man nature. His object was to benefit mankind. His know∣ledge of the world shewed him that happiness was to be attained by man, only in proportion as he practised virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Richardson's reputation is far from being confined to his own country. He has been read in many of the languages, and known to most of the nations in Europe, and has been greatly ad∣mired, notwithstanding every dissimilitude of manners, or eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disadvantage of translation. "I consider him," says Dr. Young, <Q>as a truly great natural genius; as great and super-eminent in his way, as was Shakespear and Milton in theirs.</Q></P>

Maury probably refers) remarks, that, <Q>if our nation be superior to the ancients in philo∣sophy, we are still, notwithstanding all our refinements, much inferior in Eloquence. In ancient times, no work of genius was thought to require so great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s and capacity, as the speaking in public; and some eminent writers have pronounced the talents, even of a great poet, or philosopher, to be of an inferior nature to those requisite for such an undertaking. Greece and Rome produced, each of them, but one accomplished Orator; and whatever praises the other celebrated speakers might merit, they were still esteemed much inferior to these great models of elo∣quence.</Q>
<P><Q>Of all the polite and learned nations. Britain alone possesses a popular government, or admits into the legislature such numer∣ous assemblies as can be supposed to lie under the dominion of Eloquence. But what has Britain to boast of in this particular?</Q></P>
<P><Q>In enumerating the great men who have done honour to our country, we exult in our poets and philosophers; but what Ora∣tors are ever mentioned? or where are the monuments of their genius to be met with? There are found, indeed, in our history, the names of several who directed the resolutions of our parlia∣ment: but neither themselves nor others have taken the pains to preserve their speeches; and the authority which they pos∣sessed, seems to have been owing to their experience, wisdom, or power, more than to their talents for Oratory. At present, [Mr. Hume first published his Essays about the year 1742] there are about half a dozen speakers in the two houses, who, in the judgment of the public, have reached very near the same pitch of Eloquence; and no one pretends to give any one the prefer∣ence to the rest. This seems to me a certain proof that none of them have attained much beyond a mediocrity in their art, and that the species of Eloquence, which they aspire to, gives no ex∣ercise to the sublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached by ordinary talents, and a slight application. A hundred cabi∣net-makers in London can work a table, or a chair, equally well; but no one poet can write verses with such spirit and ele∣gance as Mr. Pope.</Q></P> <BIBL>HUME'S <HI>Essays,</HI> vol i.

<P>In a similar strain with the foregoing remarks, the judicious and acute Mr. KNOX animadverts on the present state of Parliamenta∣ry Eloquence, when, speaking first of the upper house, he says, that <Q>it would be difficult to name a single peer who has attracted notice or admiration for the classical elegance of his matter or his language. Of all the speeches spoken in the house, how few have ever been collected and preserved in libraries, as models of classical elegance? Passion and personal animosity have, indeed, produced many invectives which gratify the spleen of party, and are for the time extolled beyond all the productions of preceding ingenuity. But is there extant a single volume of speeches, by the most famous among the Orators of the upper house, which can be produced as a classical book, or stand in competition with the Orations of Cicero? I regret that the fury of party, and the meanness of servitude, have, for the most part, excluded that true taste, true grace, and true spirit, which is necessary to form a classical Orator, from the harangues of an assembly, which may be doomed the most august in Europe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The House of Commons has always been esteemed a very dis∣tinguished theatre of modern Eloquence. And there indeed, notwithstanding the same impediments which prevail among the peers, it is easy to produce many splendid examples. But, though we join in the applause of common fame, yet let us ask, where are to be found the volumes of oratorical elegance? Have the speeches which have gained the praise of admiring kingdoms, been no where collected and recorded? Do we lock them up in our book-cases, and put them into the hands of our children as models for imitations, as lessons to form their young minds, and raise a suc∣cession of orators and patriots? No; the speeches are celebrated at first, and while they answer a temporary purpose. They are like vegetables of the night, or insects of a day. They have sel∣dom that solidity of merit which can render the ore valuable when the stamp is effaced, and the occasion of it almost forgotten and quite disregarded; which can preserve the plate still sale∣able after the fashion is antiquated.</Q></P> <BIBL>KNOX'S <HI>Essays,</HI> No. 152.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. BLAIR joins in the same general observation: <Q>It seems surprising that Great-Britain should not have made a more con∣spicuous figure in Eloquence than it has hitherto attained; when we consider the enlightened, and the free and bold genius of the country. It must be confessed, that in most parts of Eloquence, we are undoubtedly inferior, not only to the Greeks and Ro∣mans, by many degrees, but also to the French. We have phi∣losophers, historians, and poets of the greatest name; but of Ora∣tors or public Speakers, how little have we to boast? And where are the monuments of their genius to be found?</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 38, 39.</BIBL>
<P>From the unpromising aspect of British Eloquence, according to the statement of such able writers, a motive may be adduced to the young public speaker to signalize himself by successful exertions in Oratory, since the field lies so open before him, and has hitherto been so seldom trodden.</P>
<P>"In the House of Commons, it is easy," says Mr. Knox, <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o produce many splendid examples of modern Eloquence.</Q> Sup∣ported by such an authority, the translator feels rather disposed to demur at the unqualified condemnation of M. Maury, when he says, <Q>that Great-Britain hath not as yet one single Orator who can do honour to his country in Europe.</Q></P>
<P>The Eloquence of the late Earl of CHATHAM hath left an inde∣lible impression on the minds of many who still exist, and will, doubtless, remain for ages, a glorious monument of the triumph of this art. <Q>Nations shook at the thunder of his voice. Language can scarcely supply terms to express the weight of his authority, the magnitude of his mind and his character, and the efficacy with which he thought, decided, spoke, and acted.</Q></P>
<P>It is, indeed, a subject of regret, that the speeches of this great man, and of other eminent Orators, have not been more carefully preserved as models for youth, as well as for the instruction of pos∣terity at large. Some information on this subject may, however, be obtained from a late publication, intitled, <HI>Anecdotes of the Life of the Earl of Chatham, including his speeches,</HI> in 2 vols. 4to.</P>
<P>In the present day, the names of such public speakers as those of PITT, FOX, SHERIDAN, and BURKE, stand pre-eminent. Of Mr. Burke it may be remarked, that, perhaps there are few, if any, members of parliament, whose printed speeches will bear a comparison with that which this Orator addressed to the people of Bristol, on the occasion of a general election. We find in it that beautiful panegyric of the late Mr. Howard referred to, p. 79. The conclusion of this celebrated speech has been much admired, when he said, <Q>And now, Gentlemen, on this serious day, when I come, as it were, to make up my account with you; let me take to myself some degree of honest pride on the nature of the charges brought against me. I do not here stand accused of ve∣nality, or neglect of duty. It is not said, that, in the long period of my service, I have, in a single instance, sacrificed the slightest of your interests to my ambition, or to my fortune. It is not alleged, that, to gratify any anger or revenge of my own, or of my party, I have had a share in wronging or oppressing any one man of any description: No; the charges against me are all of one kind, that I have pushed the general principles of general justice and benevolence too far; farther than a cautious policy would warrant, and farther than the opinions of many would go with me. In every accident which may happen through life, in pain, in sorrow, in depression, and distress, I will think of this accusation, and be comforted.</Q></P>
<P>But, perhaps, though the last, yet not the least of these several Orators, of whom our nation may be proud, may be ranked the venerable Earl MANSFIELD, now, like the setting sun, ready to disappear from our view.</P>
<P>His eloquence as a pleader, his uprightness as a judge, his con∣duct as a man, and as a peer, will embalm his memory to the latest posterity.</P>
<P>Upon this great character, Dr. Fordyce passes this just eulogium: <Q>Lord Mansfield joins to the most engaging manner of speaking, the art of presenting his subject in a light and language so clear and flowing, and at the same time so striking and spirited, that if his eloquence or pleadings have not produced effects equal to those recorded of Cicero or Demosthenes, it may be accounted for by reflecting on the circumstances of the different ages in which they lived. He is so filled with his subject, that he seems often to be at a loss to determine which of his ideas ought to be preferred, and which omitted in his pleadings. None of the masters of Eloquence that we know or read of, possessed this pe∣culiar talent but Demosthenes.</Q></P> <BIBL>FORDYCE <HI>on the Action proper for the Pulpit,</HI> p. 237.</BIBL>
<P>Whoever wishes to see a specimen of his Parliamentary speeches, may read, with pleasure, that excellent one he delivered on occasion of the appeal of the city of London against Mr. Evans for refusing to fine for the office of sheriff, in which the rights of conscience, and of religious toleration and liberty, are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y vindicated.

<P>THERE is nothing of this sort, which may be denominated the Eloquence of a stroke, more worthy of admiration, than the answer of the fugitive Marius, when a Lictor came to command him, by the authority of the Roman Praetor, to depart from Africa.

<P>WHEN the parliament of Great-Britain in∣tended to pass a bill, which denied to persons accused on a criminal account the privilege of defending themselves by the help of coun∣sel, Lord BOLINGBROKE, who was against this intended law, attempted to oppose it; but, intimidated by the assembly before which he was speaking, he could not articulate a sylla∣ble, and the words he attempted to utter were at every breath dying away on his lips; when, making an extraordinary effort, he cried out, <Q>You wish, Gentlemen, that the accused should appear before you in order to de∣fend themselves. If your presence hath imposed silence upon me, judge of the im∣pression which it would produce upon the unfortunate, who should behold in you judges ready to send them to the scaffold.</Q> This single reflection, unquestionably more eloquent than all the arguments which Lord Bolingbroke could have alleged, caused the rejection of this new design.</P>
<P>Mr. CHARLES FOX, who is, in the present day, considered as the most eloquent man of Great-Britain, pronounced, in parliament, the eulogium of the late General Montgomery: one of the court-party interrupted him in
<PB N="175" REF="032455_0186_0FF26C3B6CB1ECD0"/>these words, <Q>How dare you praise a rebel before the representatives of the nation?" I will not refrain,</Q> Mr. Fox immediately replied, <Q>from repelling the outrage done to the memory of a great man. You all know the meaning of the word <HI>rebel</HI> in the mouth of my adversaries. If you have any doubts of the true sense of this expression, I would entreat you to recollect, that it is to these pretended rebellions we owe our present constitution, and the privilege of being assembled at Westminster to deliberate up∣on the interests of our country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late celebrated Irish parliamentary Orator, Mr. FLOOD, is said to have rendered himself, at times, distinguished for such sort of oratorical strokes, as those which the Abbé Maury here ascribes to Bolingbroke and Mr. Fox; and also for ingenious and sentimental expressions.
<P>As a specimen of the latter sort, it is recorded, that, at the com∣mencement of the American war, having indulged himself in one of those prophecies, which experience has since proved to be so erroneous, relative to the ruin of this country, by the loss of Ame∣rica, Mr. Flood said, <Q>Destruction shall come upon the British empire, like the coldness of death; it shall creep upon it from the extreme parts:</Q> and in speaking of the conduct of Lord Chatham, upon the stamp act, and alluding to a passage in Thucy∣dides, he introduced the following beautiful episode: <Q>Illustrious man! to whose tomb posterity shall come and say, as Pericles did, over the bodies of his deceased fellow-soldiers, You are like to the Divinities above us—you are no longer with us, you are known only by the benefits, which you have conferred.</Q> Such an enlivening stroke deserves to be rescued from oblivion.</P>
<P>In BOSWELL'S Life of the celebrated Dr. JOHNSON, there is a remark inserted, in relation to the written Life of Young, which may be quoted as one of those strokes of energetic and prompt Elo∣quence which M. Maury acknowledges the English possess.</P>
<P>"The Life of Dr. Young," (in Johnson's Lives of the Poets,) was written," says Mr. Boswell, "by Mr. Croft, and displays a pretty successful imitation of Johnson's style. A certain very eminent literary character opposed this idea vehemently; ex∣claiming, "No, no, it is <HI>not</HI> a good imitation of Johnson; it has all his pomp, without his force; it has all the nodosities of the oak without its strength." This was an image so happy, that one might have thought he would have been satisfied with it; but he was not: and setting his mind again to work, he added, with great felicity, "it has all the contortions of the Sybil, without the inspiration."</P> <BIBL>BOSWELL'S <HI>Life of Johnson,</HI> vol. ii. p. 361, 4to.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>

THESE are specimens, which would be no discredit to the writings of Demosthenes. But a sublime idea does not constitute a discourse; a beautiful, detached passage does not compose the art of Eloquence.</P>

If he was not a shining Orator, according to the ideas of rhetoricians, he was a very agreeable as well as useful preacher. He was not perfectly orthodox in his opinions; a circumstance which has lowered his character among many.

<HEAD>SECTION XLVII. <HI>Of Tillotson.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Eloquence of TILLOTSON, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, is highly esteem∣ed. I have read his sermons with the strictest impartiality, and these are my sentiments of the works of this Prelate, who is universally, regarded as the first Orator of England.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="032455_0190_0FF26C3D353D0358"/>
TILLOTSON is an excellent writer. His principal merit consists in the style. He must, therefore, be much injured by a translation, in which the vernacular expression is lost, and especially by such a translator as Barbeyrac, who was always deficient in sublimity, in embellishment, in energy, and in elegance. But, while we acknowledge all the faults of this French version, the subject-matter of the Archbishop of Canterbury's sermons still re∣mains far inferior to the discourses of Massil∣lon and Bourdaloue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this acknowledgement of M. Maury, that his ideas of Tillotson's sermons are derived from this imperfect French version of Barbeyrac, it would seem, that he himself has but little ac∣quaintance with the English language; if so, it must be presumed that he is not a competent judge of English writers, and that, there∣fore, the indiscriminate censures, which he passes upon our English divines, must, in a great measure, be ascribed to his own ignorance of their works, and the language in which they are written.</NOTE></P>
<P>TILLOTSON is more of a theologian than a moralist. He scarcely ever discussed any oth∣er than controversial subjects. He employs the same dull modes of syllogism or disserta∣tion; and merely habituates himself to an insipid uniformity of method.</P>
<P>I DISCOVER in his discourses no rhetorical movements, no great ideas, no sublime strokes: he generally divides every paragraph, and has thirty or forty subdivisions in each of his ser∣mons. His particulars are insipid, futile, and often devoid of excellence. In short,
<PB N="180" REF="032455_0191_0FF26C1067491160"/>Tillotson is so much a stranger to the art of Eloquence, that he scarcely ever makes an exordium or a peroration. Is this, then, the Orator whom they are bold enough to put in competition with our French preachers?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maury had no good reason whatever, to bring Archbishop Tillotson forward as the person, generally esteemed the first Orator among English Divines. For soundness and strength of argument, few of his own country have exceeded, and none of the French Di∣vines have equalled, the celebrated and worthy Archbishop. His warmest admirers have never esteemed him as a first rate Orator, but have agreed with the general opinion in placing him in rather an inferior situation of that class. He is, however, a great favor∣ite among his countrymen, who attend so much to the <HI>sapere</HI> from the pulpit, as to neglect the <HI>fari</HI> to a faulty degree. Let it be recol∣lected, that he has been the most powerful, the unanswerable op∣ponent of the Romish church, and that Maury has indulged him∣self in attacking the Protestant church, on the weakest side of its most formidable champion, whilst he has affected to overlook many others less obnoxious, whose claim to Oratory he dared not to con∣travert. <BIBL>E. <HI>Albany.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>BUT, not to confine ourselves to indefinite criticism, let us hasten to substantiate the grounds of our opinion.</P>
<P>IN his sermon on <Q>Prejudices against Re∣ligion,</Q> Tillotson starts an objection, drawn from the opposition which man finds between his duty and his inclinations.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 35.</NOTE> This objec∣tion he copies from the tragedy of Mustapha, by Fulke, lord Brooke, from which, he recites in the pulpit a series of verses. Is a quota∣tion of this sort worthy of the majesty of a church?<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Maury has thought it inexpedient to recollect, that some of the writers of the holy Scripture, that Arnobius, Lactantius, and the generality of the ancient fathers, and the most learned writers in every age of the church, have embellished their composition, supported their arguments, and elucidated their observations, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tations from classic authors of every description, from tragedians and comedians, as well as poets, historians, and philosophers. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no more instances, has not St. Paul, in his very sublime argument on the resurrection, 1. Cor. IV. 33. made a quotation from the comic Menander, <Q>Evil communications corrupt good manners?</Q> Has he not, in his Epistle to Titus 1. xii. quoted from Epimenides, <Q>The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w bellies.</Q>? Has not St. Luke, in his memoirs of the Acts of the Apostles, xvii. 28, informed us, that St. Paul made a quotation, which was from Aratus, "For we are also his offspring."? And has not St. Peter, II. Epistle, ii. 22, quoted two proverbs, which the learned generally suppose to have been from some comic writ∣er whose works are lost, <Q>The dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.</Q>? Did not Maury recollect these, and many others; or had rancor benumbed his faculties, and obliterated every impres∣sion of memory; or did prejudice warp him, with his eyes open, from the region of truth? <BIBL>E. <HI>Albany.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> "The passions," he adds, <Q>are a

In∣temperance, and sensuality, and fleshly lusts, debase men's minds, and clog their spirits, make them gross and foul, listless and in∣active; they sink us down into sense, and glue us to these low and inferior things; like bird-lime, they hamper and entangle our souls, and hinder our flight upwards; they indispose and unfit our minds for the most noble and intellectual considera∣tions.</Q> <BIBL>TILLOTSON, vol. i.

Serm. 3, p. 148.</NOTE></P>
<P>ELSEWHERE, in order to prove that the mysteries of religion ought to be believed, although we can never comprehend them with mathematical evidence, Tillotson ex∣presses himself in this manner; <Q>we eat, we drink, every day, although, in my opinion, no one can demonstrate that his baker, his brewer, or his cook, have not put poison into the bread, the beer, or the meat.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 112; or, in the English edition, thus: <Q>Nay, which is more, men every day eat and drink, though I think no man can demonstrate out of Euclid or Apollonius, that his baker, or brewer, or cook, have not conveyed poison into his meat or drink.</Q> Vol. i. Serm. 1, p. 86.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>IN this manner did Tillotson perform the ministry of the word in the age of Dryden, Addison, Waller, Milton; and before that same Charles II. who had heard in his child∣hood the most illustrious French Orators.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Abp. Tillotson's character as an Orator must be acknowledged to be somewhat problematical. The extravagant eulogiums of those, who have extolled him as a pattern of excellence, and the first Orator of England, have, perhaps, whetted the edge of our author's severe censures on his performances.
<P>Tillotson, as a writer, had considerable merit; but he was not without his faults. His style is so deficient in accuracy and ele∣gance, that it will not, in the present day of refinement, permit him to be held up as a model for imitation. At the same time, M. Maury appears to be as much prejudiced against this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Protestant writer, as he is unreasonably partial to those of his own nation and communion.</P>
<P>An acute and polite writer of our own country refuses to Tillot∣son the character of an illustrious Orator, and thinks that no man had ever less pretensions to genuine Oratory than this celebrated preacher. "One cannot but regret," says he, <Q>that Dr. Tillot∣son, who abounds with such noble and generous sentiments should want the art of setting them off with all the advantage they de∣serve; that the sublime in morals should not be attended with a suitable elevation of language. The truth, however, is, his words are frequently ill-chosen, and almost always ill-placed; his periods are both tedious and unharmonious; as his metaphors are generally mean, and often ridiculous; a fault, which seems to be chiefly owing to his having had no sort of notion of rhetor∣ical numbers. A noble simplicity at the same time runs through his discourses.</Q></P> <BIBL>FITZOSBORNE'S <HI>Letters,</HI> Let. xiv.</BIBL>
<P>The learned Dr. DODDRIDGE, in his <Q>Character of English Divines,</Q> (in MS) makes the following concise remarks on Tillotson: <Q>Some pertinent expressions; method admirably clear, beyond almost any other man. Many sermons contain nothing remarkable, particularly in his posthumous works; yet some there are equal to any formerly published. His best pieces are those at the beginning of his first and second volumes; such are those "on evil speaking," and "forgiving our enemies." He made great use of Barrow and Wilkins, with whom compare some few of his sermons. No man ever found such lucky argu∣ments, nor represented the adversary's sentiments more artfully for confutation.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. BLAIR'S sentiments of Tillotson are thus expressed: <Q>Til∣lotson has long been admired as an eloquent writer, and a model for preaching. But his eloquence, if we can call it such, has been often misunderstood. For, if we include in the idea of eloquence, vehemence and strength, picturesque description, glowing figures, or correct arrangement of sentences, in all these parts of Oratory the Archbishop is exceedingly deficient. His style is always pure, indeed, and perspicuous, but careless and remiss, too often feeble and languid; little beauty in the con∣struction of his sentences, which are frequently suffered to drag unharmoniously; seldom any attempt towards strength or sub∣limity. But, notwithstanding these defects, such a constant vein of good sense and piety runs through his works, such an earnest and serious manner, and so much useful instruction conveyed in a style so pure, natural, and unaffected, as will justly recom∣mend him to high regard, as long as the English language re∣mains; not, indeed, as a model of the highest eloquence, but as a simple and amiable writer, whose manner is strongly expressive of great goodness and worth. As appears in the Archbishop, negligence may sometimes be carried so far, as to impair the beauty of simplicity, and make it border on a flat and languid manner.</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 393, 394.</BIBL>

<P>TOWARDS the conclusion of his sermon "on the love of our neighbour," he makes a sort of recapitulation, with a view to apply the moral of his subject to the church of Rome.

Observe, how∣ever, the consequence he draws, after having largely proved the necessity of loving all men: <Q>Whenever we speak of charity, and of the obligation of loving one another, we cannot avoid thinking of the Church of Rome; but she must recur to our minds, particularly at this time, when she hath made so fresh a discovery, and in a manner so well authenticated, of the regard she hath for us, by the merciful plot contrived against us (the pretended plot of 1678;) such a plot, as may make the ears of all who hear it related to tingle, render Pope∣ry an eternal disgrace, and cause it to be regarded with horror and execration even to the end of the world.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii. p. 53.</NOTE> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the English edition thus: <Q>We cannot chuse but think of the Church of Rome, whenever we speak of Charity, and loving one another; especially having had so late a discovery of their affection to us, and so considerable a testimony of the kindness and charity, which they designed towards us; such as may justly make the ears of all that hear it to tingle, and render Popery execrable and infamous, a frightful and a hateful thing to the end of the world.</Q> Vol. iii.

<P>It were to be wished, that the Abbé had possessed sufficient can∣dour for Tillotson to recollect the time when he lived, and the his∣tory of that time. During the greater part of the reign of Charles II. and his successor James, the nation was kept in a constant alarm through the machination of Popish emissaries, and the dread of a Popish king. Is it then, to be wondered at, if the minds of the contending parties were embittered against each other? and if plots, real or pretended, were made the occasion of mutual recriminations?</P>
<P>At this distance of time, and after calm and unbiassed reflection on the events of Charles II's reign, we shall feel much more dis∣posed to acquit the Catholics of some of those plots laid to their charge and particularly that of 1678, on occasion of which lord Stafford suffered, than at the time, and in the violence of party animosity, it was almost possible to have done.</P></NOTE></P>

I AM not acquainted with the sermons of YOUNG, in which we should, doubtless, dis∣cover that plaintive poetry, that depth of sen∣timent, and even those eccentric ideas, which the pensive Pastor of Welwyn collected to∣gether in his nocturnal meditations. But Young does not appear to me to have had an imagination sufficiently pliable and versatile for the Eloquence of the pulpit.</P>
<P>THE preachers of Charles II. who hap∣pened to hear Bourdaloue at Paris, have but faintly imitated him; and even now, when his sermons are spread through the whole of Europe, the revolution, which they ought to produce in Christian Eloquence, hath not, as yet, taken place amongst the English.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The English preachers" says a very sensible writer, <Q>are, it is certain, more distinguished by their justness of sentiment, and strength of reasoning, than by their oratorial powers, or talents of affecting the passions. More solicitous to convince than per∣suade, they chuse to employ their abilities in endeavouring to impress the mind with a sense of the truths they deliver, by the force of argumentation, instead of rousing the affections by the energy of their eloquence. We meet with no examples in their writings of those strokes of passion, which penetrate and cleave the heart at once, or of that rapid, overpowering eloquence, which carries every thing before it like a torrent. They seem to have considered mankind in the same light in which Voltaire regard∣ed the celebrated Dr. Clarke, as "mere reasoning machines;" they seem to have considered them as purely intellectual, void of passion and sensibility. This strange mistake may, perhaps, be supposed to be partly the effect of the philosophical spirit of the times, which, like all other prevailing modes, is subject to its deliriums; certain, however, it is, that, while man remains a compound being, consisting of reason and passion, his actions will always be prompted by the latter, in whatever degree his opin∣ions may be influenced by the former.</Q> <BIBL>DUET'S <HI>Essay as Genius,</HI> B. ii. § 4. p. 238, 245.</BIBL>
<P><Q>The French and English writers of Sermons proceed upon very different ideas of the Eloquence of the Pulpit; and seem indeed to have split is betwixt them. A French sermon is, for the most part, a warm, animated exhortation; an English one, is a piece of cool, instructive reasoning. The French preachers address themselves chiefly to the imagination and the passions; the En∣glish, almost solely to the understanding. It is the union of these two kinds of composition, of the French earnestness and warmth, with the English accuracy and reason, that would form, accord∣ing to my idea, the model of a perfect sermon.</Q></P>
<BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 119.</BIBL>
<P>"In the pulpit," says Dr. BLAIR, <Q>the British divines have distinguished themselves by the most accurate and rational com∣positions, which, perhaps, any nation can boast of. Many print∣ed sermons we have full of good sense, and of sound divinity and morality; but the Eloquence to be found in them, the power of persuasion, of interesting and engaging the heart, which is, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought to be, the great object of the pulpit, is far from bearing a suitable proportion to the excellence of the matter. There are few arts, in my opinion, farther from perfection, than that of preaching is among us. In proof of the fact it is sufficient to observe, that an English sermon, instead of being a persuasive, animated Oration, seldom rises beyond the strain of correct and dry reasoning: whereas, in the sermons of Bossuet, Massillon, Bourdaloue, and Flechier, among the French, we see a much higher species of Eloquence aimed at, and in a great measure attained, than the British preachers have in view. The French have adopted higher ideas both of pleasing and persuading by means of Oratory, though, sometimes, in the execution, they fail. In Great-Britain, we have taken up Eloquence on a lower key; but in our execution have been more correct. In France, the style of their Orators is ornamented with bolder figures; and their discourse carried on with more amplification, more warmth and elevation. The composition is often very beautiful; but sometimes, also, too diffuse, and deficient in that strength and cogency which render Eloquence powerful.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Modern Eloquence is much more cool and temperate than the Grecian and Roman; and in G. Britain especially, has confined itself almost wholly to the argumentative and rational. It is much of that species which the ancient critics called the "Te∣nuis," or "Subtilis;" which aims at convincing and instructing, rather than affecting the passions, and assumes a tone not much higher than common argument and discourse.</Q></P>

<P>Still, however, though much remains to be accomplished in our island in the art of pulpit-elocution, it must be confessed, that we are by no means deficient in theological discourses, which would reflect honour on any country, or in compositions, which will bear to undergo the ordeal of a correct attic taste. And it appears to be a well-founded, as it is a pleasing reflection, that our pulpit-com∣positions have been, for some length of time, in an improving style. The Divines of the last century wanted, it is true, that accuracy and refinement of taste, which characterize some of our modern discourses; but some of them abounded in lofty sentiments and un∣questionable energy. The works of JEREMIAH TAYLOR, HOP∣KINS, HOWE, BATES, and others, have in them traits of genuine Eloquence. In times somewhat later, we can boast of the sermons of SEED, ATTERBURY, HOADLY, SHERLOCK, SECKER, BUTLER, DODDRIDGE, WATTS, and others: and in the present day the names of PORTEUS, DAVIS, GERRARD, OGILVI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, LEECHMA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, BLAIR, FORDYCE, HU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ER, and many others, might perhaps be adduced as no bad specimens of the height to which the Eloquence of the pulpit hath been advanced. As to preachers, perhaps none have acquired by their natural Eloquence greater command over their hearers than the celebrated Messrs. WHITFIELD and WES∣LEY: to the former of these the description and character given by M. Maury to Bridaine, (p. 63) bears, in various respects, a con∣siderable resemblance.</P>

<P><Q>He was an excellent preacher, and a great promoter of public charities, particularly the Worcester Infirmary, and the Hospital for inoculating the Small Pox, at London. His sermon in favour of this latter institution, preached in 1752, was much admired, and contributed greatly to extend the practice of Inoc∣ulation. He published some other single sermons.

IT is asserted, that this discourse influenced the public benevolence to endow an Hospital for Inoculation.</P>
<P>IF, indeed, the Bishop of Worcester hath participated this kind of glory with Vincent de Paul, it must be acknowledged, that Elo∣quence could not obtain a more excellent triumph. This sermon is an interesting dis∣sertation, and new as to its object; but the prelate, who delivered it, will never be placed in the rank of Orators.</P>
<P>DESTITUTE of imagination, and of sensi∣bility, he wanders into abstract calculations respecting population; into low details about the secondary fever; and, after having ex∣hausted all those combinations, certainly more suited to a medicinal school than a Christian assembly, he quotes the testimonies and au∣thority of Messrs. Ranby, Hawkins, and Mid∣dleton, surgeons of London, of whom he speaks with as much veneration as if they were Fathers of the church.</P>
<P>THE more we read foreign Orators, the more we perceive the pre-eminence of the French preachers.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards and Germans are yet in the rudiments of Christian Eloquence. Father SEIGNERY has been for some time extolled as the Bourdaloue of Italy. He hath been

ELOQUENCE, become a stranger to the works of learned men, was still cultivated by a small number of real Orators, whom popular opinion placed far below all those fashionable declaimers. But, in the history of the arts there are remarkable epochs, when a superior writer recals the public attention towards those methods which have been abandoned, and draws along with him a number, who follow him in the course in which he himself has excelled.</P>
<P>SUCH is the glory, which M. THOMAS hath had among us. He contributed to the for∣tunate revolution, which has renewed the taste in Oratory for panegyrics: in these, he hath displayed as much Eloquence, as Fontenelle had discovered of penetration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FONTENELLE was a celebrated French author, and pronoun∣ced by Voltaire the most universal genius of the age of Louis XIV. He wrote on a variety of subjects, particularly a number of pane∣gyrics on the deceased members of the Academy of Sciences, to which he had been appointed perpetual secretary.

<HEAD>SECTION L. <HI>Of the Use of the Holy Scriptures.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE style, which M. Thomas cultivated, possesses much of that manner, so well adapted for the pulpit, by the elevation of the ideas, and the moral strain, which is gen∣erally to be found in them. Do we wish to see the example of this writer become service∣able to preachers? Let us recollect, that, in the corruption of Eloquence, the language of Religion was forgotten; and that, in order to impart to our ministry its former lustre, we must, at once, become Orators, and Christian Orators.</P>
<P>IT is by incessantly reading the Holy Scriptures, that we learn to speak that spiri∣tual language, which diffuses through a ser∣mon, representations alternately affecting, majestic, or terrible.</P>
<P>LET us never consider it as a painful re∣straint, that we are happily bound to incor∣porate the sacred writings into our composi∣tions. The Bible is for the style of preach∣ers, that which mythology is for the Elocu∣tion of poets. In the sacred volumes, there are to be found thoughts so sublime, expres∣sions so energetic, descriptions so eloquent,
<PB N="196" REF="032455_0207_0FF26C9DD8688CE8"/>allegories so well chosen, sentences so pro∣found, ejaculations so pathetic, sentiments so tender, that we should adopt them from taste, if we were so unhappy as not to search after them from a principle of zeal and piety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Without doubt a preacher ought to affect people by strong, and sometimes even by terrible images: but it is from the scrip∣ture that he should learn to make powerful impressions. There he may clearly discover the way to make sermons plain and popular, without losing the force and dignity they ought always to have."—"The study of the sacred writings was, in the first ages of the church, reckoned to be sufficient. Hence came that passage in the apostolical constitutions, which says, "If you want history, or laws, or moral precepts, or eloquence, or poetry, you will find them all in the scriptures." In effect, it is needless to seek elsewhere for any thing that is necessary to form our taste and judgment of true Eloquence. St. Austin says, we ought to exalt and improve our knowledge, by the authority of scripture; and our language, by the dignity of its expressions.</Q>
<P><Q>The difference betwixt them [the best heathen and inspired writings] will, upon comparison, be found much to the honour of scripture. It surpasses them vastly in native simplicity, live∣liness, and grandeur. Homer himself never reached the sub∣limity of Moses's songs; especially the last (Deut. xxxii. 1, &amp;c.) which all the Israelitish children were to learn by heart. Never did any ode, either Greek or Latin, come up to the loftiness of the Psalms: that one, in particular, which begins thus; "The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken," (Psal. 1, &amp;c.) sur∣passes the utmost stretch of human invention. Neither Homer, nor any other poet, ever equalled Isaiah describing the majesty of God, in whose sight the "nations of the earth are as the small dust; yea less than nothing, and vanity;" seeing it is He that stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in." (Ch. xl. 10, &amp;c) Sometimes this pro∣phet has all the sweetness of an eclogue, in the smiling images he gives us of peace: (See ch. xi. and xxxv.) and sometimes he soars so high as to leave every thing below him. What is there in antiquity that can be compared to the Lamentations of Jere∣miah, when he tenderly deplores the miseries of his country? (v. 2, &amp;c. ch. ii. and ch. iii.) or to the prophecy of Nahum, when he foresees in spirit the proud Nineveh fall under the rage of an invincible army? (i. 3, &amp;c.) We fancy that we see the army, and hear the noise of arms and chariots. Every thing is painted in such a lively manner, as strikes the imagination. The pro∣phet far out-does Homer. Read likewise Daniel denouncing to Belshazzar the divine vengeance ready to overwhelm him; and try if you can find any thing in the most sublime originals of an∣tiquity, that can be compared to those passages of sacred writ. In all the rest of scripture there appears a natural and beautiful variety.</Q></P> <BIBL>FENELON'S <HI>Dialogues,</HI> p. 115, 124, 127.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. BLAIR recommends the language of Sacred Scripture to Preachers, by saying, that <Q>when properly employed, it is a great ornament to sermons. It may be employed, either in the way of quotation, or allusion. Direct quotations brought from scrip∣ture, in order to support what the preacher inculcates, both give authority to his doctrine, and render his discourse more solemn and venerable. Allusions to remarkable passages, or expressions of scripture, when introduced with propriety, have generally a pleasing effect. They afford the preacher a fund of metaphorical expression, which no other composition enjoys, and by means of which he can vary and enliven his style. But he must take care that any such allusions be natural and easy; for if they seem forced, they approach to the nature of conceits.</Q> Dr. Blair refers us for examples to Bishop Sherlock's Discourses, vol. i. disc. i. and to Seed's Sermons, serm. iv.</P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 115, 116.</BIBL></NOTE></P>

A CHRISTIAN Orator may, and even ought to, seize upon all the riches, which he discovers in these divine books. It is there where plagiarism is permitted him, and the more treasures he draws from thence, the better are his auditors pleased with his thefts.</P>
<P>QUOTATIONS from inspired authors be∣come authorities, which render the ministry of a Christian Orator more venerable; and witnesses, which he derives from heaven or hell, in order to instruct the earth.</P>
<P>WOE! Woe to him, if he be ashamed of the gospel, at the very time when he is
<PB N="198" REF="032455_0209_0FF26CA1B59525D8"/>preaching it, and if, from an indecent and criminal complaisance, he dare not name Jesus Christ in that pulpit, where he comes to occupy his place!</P>
<P>AN abundance of new and unknown beau∣ties still remain in the Holy Scriptures to excite the preacher's emulation.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the thought which he wishes to express, he will always find the primary idea, at least, in the books of Revelation, if he have sufficient zeal to read them daily, and sufficient discernment properly to under∣stand them. When searching for a passage which he wants, he thereby discovers other passages, which he reserves for the subjects to which they are adapted. But he ought only to make use of striking quotations; because it is not necessary to speak the language of inspiration, in order to say common things.</P>
<P>THE preacher may derive from the Bible historical comparisons, the only ones which are suitable for the style of the pulpit, where they always succeed; and those analogies present themselves involuntarily to an Ora∣tor, who has grown familiar with the sacred books.</P>
<P>MASSILLON excels in this respect. You will find, in all his discourses, sometimes very short comparisons, which throw light upon
<PB N="199" REF="032455_0210_0FF26C7D9A145888"/>his idea, and, at other times, comparisons of greater length, which form admirable frames, in which he incloses the picture of morals.</P>
<P>SUCH is that rhetorical turn, which he em∣ploys in his sermon "on the Word of God," when he attacks that common abuse of at∣tending upon religious instruction, only with a view of depreciating the talents of the Preacher. Massillon makes a particular ap∣plication to his hearers of the reproach, which Joseph addressed, in disguise, to his brethren: <Q>It is not to seek for bread, that ye are come into Egypt; ye are come here as spies; to observe the weak places of this country <HI>ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land are ye come.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xlii. 9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THE same Orator also avails himself of this figure, in his sermon upon "Backsliding," when he paints the situation of the sinner, who, after having been recovered, finally relapses into his criminal habits: Massillon compares him to the image of Dagon, which, having been thrown down before the ark, was forthwith replaced upon the altar by the priests of the Philistines; <Q>but the idol hav∣ing fallen a second time, useless efforts were made to restore this mutilated statue, which remained stretched out upon the earth, and forever immoveable; <HI>only the

<P>THE Abbé BOISMONT, whose success has been so brilliant in the career of Christian Eloquence, and principally in the species of funeral Oration, has made a very ingenious use of a passage of sacred writ, in his Eulo∣gium of Louis XV.</P>
<P>HE begins with recalling all the misfortunes of France, from the beginning of this centu∣ry, until the wise and prosperous Ministry of Cardinal de Fleury; and, in describing the changes which took place at this period in Administration, all the branches of which had been disgraced by abuses of long standing, he rises to the tone of Bossuet: <Q>Louis said to Cardinal de Fleury, as formerly the Lord God to the Prophet Ezekiel, <HI>Breathe upon these slain that they may live.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ezekiel xxxvii. 7, 9.</NOTE> The spirit of life suddenly enters into the dry and withered bones.

Ye are the Minis∣ters of the word of GOD; ye ought, therefore, to draw the substance of your dis∣courses from the sacred books, and to speak the language of the invisible Preacher, whom ye represent. If it be true that your lips are the depositories of science, how will ye be instructive, if ye be not yourselves instructed? Ye will at best preach a morality merely hu∣man; ye will never, when discoursing on divine truths, impart to your style the energy of apt expression, if, to the study of the sacred

<P>FENELON, in his <Q>Dialogues concerning Eloquence,</Q> hath characterized, with equal precision and taste, the Fathers of the Greek and Latin Church; and the opinion of the Archbishop of Cambray ought to be law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See in the English translation of FENELON'S <HI>Dialogues,</HI> on this point, p. 128—130, and 142.

<P>Dr. BLAIR makes the following judicio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remark respecting those authors denominated "Fathers of the Church."</P>
<P><Q>Among the Latin Fathers, Lactantius and Minutius Felix are the most remarkable for purity of style; and, in a later age, the famous St. Augustine possesses a considerable share of sprightli∣ness and strength. But none of the Fathers afford any just mo∣dels of Eloquence. Their language, as soon as we descend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the third or fourth century, becomes harsh; and they are, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general, infected with the taste of that age, a love of swoln and strained thoughts, and of the play of words.</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR, vol. ii. p. 36.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>WE reckon among the Fathers, many very learned writers in profane antiquity, such as CLEMENT <HI>of Alexandria,</HI> ORIGEN, EUSEBIUS <HI>of Coesarca,</HI> JEROM, and AUGUSTINE.</P>
<P>I AM aware, that, in their writings, the pu∣rity of style doth not always correspond with the extent of erudition, especially if we com∣pare them with Cicero and Demosthenes. But, according to the judicious observation of the Abbé de Fleury<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Second Discourse.</NOTE> when it is intended
<PB N="203" REF="032455_0214_0FF26CF0AD063EC0"/>to appreciate the merits of the Fathers of the Church, we must not forget the time when, nor the country where, they lived; nor to contrast them with their most celebrated con∣temporaries, AMBROSE, with SYMMACHUS; BASIL, with LIBANIUS; and then we perceive how much superior they have been to their age.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, requisite that a Preach∣er should read all tradition. For this, his life would scarcely suffice. But, by making a selection of two or three Fathers of the church, the most consonant to his genius; by confin∣ing himself, moreover, to their rhetorical writings, he will find in them ideas suffi∣ciently striking to embellish and give weight to his sermons.</P>
<P>ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM is principally de∣serving of having the choice of a Christian Orator fixed upon him. His diction is pure and splendid; his eloquence is tender and persuasive; and he abounds so much in sub∣lime descriptions, or ingenious ideas, that we find passages to quote in every page of his writings.</P>
<P>POPE CLEMENT XI. who, during his Pon∣tificate, preached yearly at Rome on Easter and Christmas days, and the feast of St. Peter, had the art of making an admirable use of Chrysostom's writings. His homilies are an
<PB N="204" REF="032455_0215_0FF26CA357EFDA78"/>excellent assemblage of the most striking thoughts and pathetic sentiments of the Fath∣ers of the Church.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>As to the style of sermons, it offends against all rules, if it be not pathetic, nervous, and sublime. The path hath been pointed out by St. Chrysostom. He who was always with God, always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the milk of the word, and perfectly acquainted with the human heart, speaks, thunders, shakes, and leaves to sinners no other answer but cries and remorse.</Q> <BIBL>Pope GANGANELLI'S <HI>Letters,</HI> vol. iii. p. 82.</BIBL>
<P>Abp. FENELON thus characterises Chrysostom: <Q>His style is copious, but he did not study false ornaments. All his discourse tends to persuasion: he placed every thing with judgment, and was well acquainted with the holy Scripture, and the manners of men. He entered into their hearts; and rendered things famil∣iarly sensible to them. He had sublime and solid notions; and is sometimes very affecting. Upon the whole, we must own he is a great Orator.</Q> <HI>Dialogues concerning Eloquence,</HI> dial. iii. p. 143, 144.</P>
<P>"Among the Greek Fathers," says Dr. BLAIR, <Q>the most dis∣tinguished, by far, for his oratorial merit, is St. Chrysostom. His language is pure; his style highly figured. He is copious, smooth, and sometimes pathetic. But he retains, at the same time, much of that character, which has been always attributed to the Asiatic Eloquence, diffuse and redundant to a great degree, and often overwrought and tumid. He may be read, however, with advantage, for the Eloquence of the pulpit, as being freer of false ornaments than the Latin Fathers.</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 37.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>BOSSUET, who, himself, may be reckoned among the Fathers, and whom, in the pre∣sent day, we quote in our sermons as we do them, sufficiently testifies, by his example, how advantageous it is for a Christian Orator to study the Fathers. He draws from their writings the most profound maxims, the most convincing arguments, sometimes even sub∣lime
<PB N="205" REF="032455_0216_0FF26C68A4A3CE78"/>comparisons, which enrich the Elo∣quence of his discourses.</P>
<P>WHO would not be ambitious to have bor∣rowed, as he did, this admirable description from S. AUGUSTINE, which represents the troubles of human life? <Q>Worldings do not think that they use exercise, unless they disquiet themselves; nor that they move, unless they make a noise. That man, who is complaining of too much labour, were he delivered from that trouble, could not endure his repose. At one time, the day's work appears to him too short; at another time, his leisure would be to him a burden: he loves his servitude, and is pleased with his weight; and this constant impulse, which involves him in a thousand embar∣rassments, prevents him from gratifying himself with the image of unrestrained lib∣erty. As a tree, says St. Austin, which the wind seems to caress when sporting with its leaves and branches, although this wind only bends it with the agitation, and tosses it, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, with vast caprice; you would say, however, that the tree diverted itself with the freedom of its motions; in like man∣ner," saith this great Bishop, "while the men of the world have no true liberty, be∣ing almost always obliged to submit to vari∣ous

<HEAD>SECTION LII. <HI>Of Quotations from Profane Authors.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is sometimes allowable to quote, in the pulpit, the profane writers of antiquity, provided that such citations be not long, nor frequent, nor accompanied with historical relations foreign to religion.</P>
<P>OUR old preachers flattered themselves that they were very eloquent, when they had col∣lected into one barbarous compilation, which they called a Christian discourse, some shreds of poetry, eloquence, or history.</P>
<P>THE author of "Pulpit-maxims," inge∣niously compares those sermons blended with the principles of religion, and the maxims of Paganism, "to the Temple at Jerusalem built with the marble and cedars of king Hiram."</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="032455_0218_0FF26CF24D4FCA88"/>
BUT it is no less certain, that Christian Eloquence doth not exclude heathen testi∣monies, when the Orator is pointing out the duties of morality or the particulars of good conduct.</P>
<P>S. BASIL has composed a treatise, in order to prove the utility of reading heathen authors. Bossuet, whose learning equalled his elo∣quence, drew, from time to time, out of those authors, sublime thoughts, which he quoted in the pulpit; and Bourdaloue, in his ser∣mon on "the love of riches," hath paraphras∣ed this maxim of Horace,
<Q><L>Rem</L>
<L>Si possis recte, si non, quocumque modo, rem.</L></Q></P>
<P>LET us not, however, make an improper use of these examples. We shall never be blamed for not having founded our proofs upon a profane authority; and we shall do an equal injury to piety and taste, if we relate ideas taken from heathens, when we can find them equally well, and perhaps better, ex∣pressed in scripture, or in tradition.</P>

<P>I WILL not, then, read the Moralists, the Poets, and the Orators, of antiquity with a view of multiplying such heathen quota∣tions, but rather, in order to know the human heart, and to form my taste upon the models of Eloquence. This study is more useful than the reading of sermons.</P>
<P>Is it your aim to excel in Christian Elo∣quence? At first consult collections of ser∣mons. But, when once you become conver∣sant with them, shut those books; they would blunt your imagination, and thereby contract your ideas, although they may be filled with sublime passages.</P>
<P>AIM at original composition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Original writers are, and ought to be, great favourites; for they are great benefactors; they extend the republic of letters, and add a new province to its dominion.

<P>ALL men have not sufficient ability to lay hold of an ingenious idea; but all have souls capable of being affected with a weighty sentiment; and never are the hearers more universally attentive than when the Preacher becomes pathetic.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On this point let us regard two able judges and eloquent writ∣ers.

<P>THAT is a charming and flowing Elo∣quence, which, far from exciting violent agitations, gently insinuates itself into the soul, and there awakes the tenderest affec∣tions; which is a succession of natural and moving sentiments, copiously diffusing them∣selves, so that, when experienced, the Orator who inspires them is forgotten, and we sup∣pose that we are conversing with ourselves.

<P>"This man, so famous in the annals of the new world, had ac∣companied his father, in the first voyage made by Columbus. The mildness and simplicity of the Indians affected him so strongly, that he made himself an ecclesiastic, in order to devote his labours to their conversion. But this soon became the least of his attentions. As he was more a man than a priest, he felt more for the cruelties exercised against them, than for their superstitions. He employed every method in order to comfort the people for whom he had con∣ceived an attachment, or to soften their tyrants. He became the avowed patron of the Indians; and, by his bold interpositions on their behalf, as well as by the respect due to his abilities and cha∣racter, he had often the merit of setting some bounds to the ex∣cesses of his countrymen.

In it the style is adapted to the subject, without form∣ing its principal merit.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sermons of CHEMINAIS are on various subjects, and are comprised in four, and sometimes in five volumes, 8vo.

<P>CHEMINAIS'S manner of writing, so full of sweetness and tenderness, denotes the happiest talent. His sermons breathe a certain at∣tractive and affectionate languor, which must ever give us occasion to regret, that this writer, otherwise enfeebled by habitual infirmities, had not lived long enough to finish his oratorial career.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is to be confessed, that there are not so many specimens of this sort of pathetic Eloquence to be found among English writers, as could be wished. Perhaps no nation can boast of more argumen∣tative and sensible discourses, or of abler defences of every branch of Christian doctrine and duty. But to find that persuasive tender∣ness, or what the French call <HI>onction,</HI> mingled with the solidity of argument, and the effusions of piety, is mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> rare. Bishop KEN'S <HI>retired Christian</HI> resembles, in a good measure, the character ascrib∣ed by our author to the writings of Cheminais▪ In the works of FLAVEL are intermingled many tender and pathetic expressions. The noted RICHARD BAXTER, also, though too fond of contro∣versy, and his style, far from being correct or elegant, has, not∣withstanding, in some of his practical pieces, and particularly in that one intituled <HI>the Saints everlasting Rest,</HI> some fine and affecting passages. He only wanted <Q>his genius to be curbed by salutary checks,</Q> to have obtained, in his practical works, the character of a pathetic writer. There is in HOWE'S "living temple," a grand and beautiful metaphorical description of human depravity under the idea of a ruinous temple (p. 155;) and in Bishop SHER∣LOCK'S discourses, a fine and much admired piece of Eloquence, where the character of our Blessed Lord is contrasted with that of the impostor Mahomet, (v. i. p. 271;) though, perhaps, neither of these can be properly classed as <HI>pathetic</HI> pieces.
<P>Where shall we find any passages more excellent and pathetic in their kind, than in Dr. GROSVENOR'S sermon, intituled <Q>the Temper of Jesus towards his Enemies?</Q></P>
<P>The ingenious Dr. Knox has the following sensible observations on the pathetic style, particularly as it is to be found in scripture, and in the works of Sterne:</P>
<P><Q>There must be a charm added by the creative power of genius, which no didactic rules can teach, which cannot be adequately described, but which is powerfully felt by the vibrations of the heart-strings, and which causes an irresistible overflowing of the <HI>sacri fontes lachrymarum.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Florid diction and pompous declamation are, indeed, found to be the least adapted of all modes of address to affect the finer sensibilities of nature. Plain words, without epithets, without metaphors, without similies, have oftener excited emotions of the tenderest sympathy, than the most laboured compositions of Cor∣neille. A few words of simple pathos will penetrate the soul to the quick, when a hundred lines of declamation shall assail it as feebly and ineffectually, as a gentle gale the mountain of Plin∣limmon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A writer of taste and genius may avail himself greatly in pa∣thetic compositions, by adopting the many words and phrases, re∣markable for their beautiful simplicity, which are interspersed in that pleasing, as well as venerable book, the Holy Bible▪ Besides its astonishing simplicity, it has many a passage exquisitely tender and pathetic.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Throughout all the works of STERNE, there are interspersed exquisite touches of the pathetic. His pathetic stories are greatly admired. The pathetic was the chief excellence of his writings; his admirers will be displeased if we were to add, that it is the only one which admits of unalloyed applause.</Q></P> <BIBL>KNOX'S <HI>Essays,</HI> No. 145.</BIBL>
<P><Q>Sterne, who, though he is justly condemned for his libertinis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, possessed an uncommon talent for the pathetic, has availed him∣self greatly of the scriptural language. In all his mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t affecting passages, he has imitated the turn, style, manner, and simplicity of the sacred writers, and in many of them has transcribed whole sentences. He found no language of his own could equal the finely expressive diction of our common translation. I will quote only one or two instances of his imitations of scripture, taken from the most admired pieces in the tender style: "Maria, though not tall, was, nevertheless, of the first order of fine forms. Affliction had touched her looks with something that was scarce earthly, and so much was there about her of all that the heart wishes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, or those of Eliza out of mine, she should not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of my bread, and drink of my cup, but Maria should lie in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter." "A∣dieu, poor, luckless maiden! imbibe the oil and wine, which the compassion of a stranger, as he sojourneth on his way, now pours into thy wounds. The Being, who has twice bruised thee, can only bind them up for ever." Again, in his description of the captive: "As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeless eye towards the door, then cast it down, shook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle. He gave a deep sigh. I saw the iron enter into his soul." It would be easy to adduce many other instances, in which a writer, who eminently excelled in the power of moving the affections, felt himself unequal to the task of advancing the style of pathos to its highest perfection, and sought assistance of the Bible.</Q></P> <BIBL>KNOX'S <HI>Essays,</HI> No. 154.</BIBL>
<P>For more instances of the pathetic sort, the reader is referred to Sterne's well known story of "Le Fevre," in which is that beau∣tiful passage, "The accusing spirit, which flew up to heaven's chancery with the oath, blushed as he gave it in; and the record∣ing angel, as he took it down, dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever." <HI>Tristram Shandy,</HI> vol. III. c. 49. To this may be added the story of "Maria," in do. vol. IV. c. 83; and the affecting and beautiful story of "La Roche," in the <HI>Mirror,</HI> vol. II. p. 39—62; also, the story of "Mercator," in the <HI>Adven∣turer.</HI></P>
<P>To these may not be improperly added a specimen of affecting Eloquence in an American Indian. "I may challenge," says Mr. Jefferson, <Q>the whole Orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, and of any more eminent Orator, if Europe has furnished more eminent, to produce a single passage superior to the speech of Logan, a Mingo chief, to lord Dunmore, when governor of Vir∣ginia. The following incidents that occurred in the spring of the year 1774, were the occasion of it. A robbery and murder had been committed on the inhabitants of the frontiers of Virginia, by two Indians. The neighbouring whites, according to their custom, undertook to punish this outrage in a summary way. A party was collected, and proceeded in quest of vengeance. Un∣fortunately, a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was seen coming from the opposite shore, unarmed, and unsus∣pecting an hostile attack from the whites. The moment the canoe reached the shore, the white party, who had been con∣cealed, singled out their objects, and, at one fire, killed every person in it. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had been long distinguished as a friend of the whites. This un∣worthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly signal∣ized himself in the war which ensued A decisive battle was soon afterwards sought, in which the Indians were defeated and sued for peace. Logan, however, disdained to be seen among the sup∣pliants. But, lest the sincerity of a treaty should be distrusted, from which so distinguished a chief absented himself, he sent by a messenger the following speech to be delivered to lord Dunmore:</Q></P>
<P><Q>I appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>During the course of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long and bloody war, Logan re∣mained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed, as they passed, and said, "Logan is the friend of white men." I had even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sap, the last spring, in cold blood, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many: I have glu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his head to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan?—Not one.</Q></P> <BIBL>JEFFERSON'S <HI>History of Virginia.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>SECTION LVII. <HI>Of the Peroration.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF pathos be requisite in a Christian dis∣course, it is undoubtedly in the Peroration. There, the Orator ought to set in motion all
<PB N="220" REF="032455_0231_0FF26CBDD9859990"/>the springs of sensibility, and to strike the greatest strokes of Eloquence.</P>
<P>ALL moral subjects tend to pathetic con∣clusions. The attention of the auditory,
<PB N="221" REF="032455_0232_0FF26CFF9F142958"/>which always revives towards the close of the sermon, invites the Christian minister to finish instruction by moving and energetic repre∣sentations,
<PB N="222" REF="032455_0233_0FF26CC4C4199B38"/>which may powerfully affect the conscience, and leave an indelible impression upon every mind.</P>
<P>SOME rhetoricians have laid it down as an established maxim in the art of Oratory, to recapitulate, in this part of the discourse, the principal arguments, and to offer an analy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them.</P>
<P>I MAKE bold to object to this method, which neither Demosthenes nor Cicero ever followed.</P>
<P>IF this recapitulation of the proofs ought to terminate a discourse, ought it not espe∣cially to be adopted at the Bar?</P>
<P>IT would be to no purpose to object to me here the example of Cicero, in his beau∣tiful Oration against Verres. The Orator successively invokes, in his Peroration, all the gods and goddesses, whose temples this robber
<PB N="223" REF="032455_0234_0FF26D0165AE35B0"/>had pillaged, and, by this means, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e draws a more striking picture of his profanations. But what then i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are those sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e apostro∣phes an analysis of his pleading?</P>
<P>CICERO had proved, at the beginning, that Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es had no military genius, and that he was equally incapable of commanding a fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, or an army; he had afterwards gone over the excesses of his debaucheries his ava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice, and his cruelties towards the Roman citizens, whom he caused to be crucified upon the coasts of Sicily their faces being turned from the Roman shore.</P>
<P>NOW Cicero omits all these outrages at the conclusion of his discourse, and only reproach∣es the accused with his sacrileges.</P>
<P>IT is not, therefore, true, that the Roman Orator presents to his judges a summary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his speech in this Peroration.</P>
<P>OUR most illustrious Orators, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cluding a sermon, never recapitulate th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and arguments of the subject.</P>
<P>MASSILLON, I confess, hastily runs over some of his ideas in the Peroration of his discourse, "on the certainty of a future state;" but he does not grow languid, when he touches upon the contradictions with which he charges the wicked; and he quickly extricates himself by some moving passages.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="032455_0235_0FF26CCACFE01E10"/>
BESIDES, one single example should not suffice for establishing a general rule. What! ought we then to follow Massillon and Bour∣daloue, when even they would be shackled by a proceeding so didactic and uniform? Who doth not perceive, that such sort of co∣rollaries would leave both the preacher and the congregation unaffected?</P>
<P>THE Orator's conclusion must not be con∣fined to simple speculative consequences. He has done nothing as yet when he has proved the truth of his principles. This is the point from which he should proceed, in order to subdue the passions, that the sinner may re∣tain no excuse, and that conviction may bring him to repentance.</P>
<P>Now, that you may produce such effects, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke leave of your proofs and your divisions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be assured, that whatever is repeated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebles.</P>

<P>YOU may, in vain, have received from nature, this happy gift of persuading and moving; in vain may you have brought your talent to perfection by the study of rules; you may attain to Eloquence in writing; still you would never speak like an eloquent man, if you were impeded in the delivery of your discourse by the treachery of your memory.</P>

<P>WHAT is not clearly understood is badly repeated; for, to a stiff pronunciation, which is already become too perceptible in Christian
<PB N="226" REF="032455_0237_0FF26C89969B4EC8"/>pulpits, there is added a want of freedom, which wearies the congregation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quel deplai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir de voir l'Orateur entrepris Relire dans la voûte un sermon mal appris!</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN once hearers experience this disgust, they are afraid of meeting with a similar em∣barrassment, and never listen afterwards with∣out uneasiness.

<P>NEVER, therefore, consider the time lost, which you may devote to this mechanical study.

BOURDALOUE and Massillon, both of them born with treacherous memories, were obliged to have recourse to their manuscripts during almost the whole period of their exercising the sacred ministry; but they perceived at that time, with a degree of mortification, how much they diminished the pleasure, which people received in hearing them. The Bishop of Clermont, from thence, conceived such a dislike for the pulpit, that he was unwilling to mount it during the twenty-five last years of his life; and it is a fact, that, when urged one day to declare to which of his sermons he gave the preference, he very shrewdly re∣plied, "to that which I know the best."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To corroborate our author's remark respecting Bourdaloue and Massillon having treacherous memories, let it be remarked, that <Q>it is often found, that a fine genius has but a feeble memory; for, where the genius is bright, and the imagination vivid, the power of memory may be too much neglected, and lose its im∣provement.

THE custom of repeating from memory hath brought forward in the road of sacred Eloquence, that multitude of preachers, who, through indolence, or defect of talents, deliv∣er the sermons of others.</P>
<P>As for such, their ministerial labours are wholly confined to the painful and unpleasant task of imprinting in their memory discourses, which they have not had the trouble or the pleasure of composing.

<P>BUT this slight inconvenience may pro∣mote religious instruction, without prevent∣ing the improvement of the art of preaching; and it may be inferred, that he, who preaches the sermons of others, does so from an ina∣bility to produce better himself.</P>
<P>SHOULD it ever be the case, that the min∣isters of the gospel would wish to rest satisfied with reading religious instructions from the pulpit, their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arers would become fewer, and their discourses less successful; for mem∣ory refembles a sudden inspiration, whereas reading is only a cold communication.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the practice of preaching sermons memoriter be objection∣able, the practice of reading them verbatim is still more so. Against the former method, which M.

<P>A slavish attachment to written notes, which has become so pre∣valent in the present day, both among the established and dissent∣ing clergy, unquestionably tends to enervate the energy, which should accompany the delivery of sermon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and, in some measure, to weaken and prevent the desired effects.</P>
<P>The judicious reflection of our author concerning the consequen∣ces of <Q>ministers resting satisfied with reading religious instructions from the pulpit,</Q> has great weight in it, and should be seriously considered by ministers, whose concern it is to be useful. Facts strongly corroborate the justness of his reasoning. The most accu∣rate and sensible discourses of mere readers are disregarded, and their hearers are comparatively few, while the discourses of others, which appear to flow "ex imo pectore," though, perhaps, less ac∣curate and elegant are listened to with pleasure and avidity. In this respect, human nature is the same in every country, and will continue to be so till the end of time.</P>

<P>Bishop BURNET gives us his sentiments on this subject, as follow: <Q>This leads me to consider the difference that is between reading and speaking of sermons. Reading is peculiar to this nation, and is endured in no other. It has indeed made our sermons more exact, and has thus produced many volumes of the best that are extant. But, after all, though some few read so happily, pro∣nounce so truly, and enter so entirely into those affections, which they recommend, that, in them, we see both the correct∣ness of reading, and the seriousness of speaking sermons; yet every one is not so happy; some by hanging their heads per∣petually over their notes, by blundering as they read, and by a cursory running over them, do so lessen the matter of their ser∣mons, that, as they are generally read with very little life or affection, so they are heard with as little regard, or esteem. Those who read, ought certainly to be at a little more pains, than, for the most part, they are, to read true; to pronounce with an emphasis; to raise their head, and to direct their eyes to their hearers: and if they practised more, alone, the just way of reading, they might deliver their sermons with much more ad∣vantage. Man is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow sort of creature: he does not (nay, the greater part cannot,) consides things in themselves, without those little seasonings that must recommend them to their affections. Besides, the people, who are too apt to censure the clergy, are easily carried into an obvious reflection on reading, that it is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effect of laziness.</Q> BURNET'S <HI>Pastoral Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> § ix.</P>
<P>The learned Dr. WATTS, in his Thoughts, intitled <Q>Words without Spirit,</Q> describes the following character: <Q>Lectorius is a pious man; and worthy minister in a country parish; his discourses are well formed, his sentiments on almost every sub∣ject are just and proper, his style is modern, and not unpolite, nor does he utterly neglect the passions in the turn of his com∣posures; yet I cannot call him a good preacher, for he does not only use his written notes to secure his method, and to relieve his memory, but he scarce ever takes his eye from of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his book to address himself with life and spirit to the people: for this reason, many of his hearers fall asleep: the rest of them fit from January to December, regardless and unconcerned; an air of indolence reigns through the faces of his auditory, as if it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> matter of no importance, or not addressed to them, and his min∣istrations have little power or success. In his last sermon, he had a use of reproof for some vices which were practised in a public and shameless manner in his parish, and he thought that these sins ought not to escape a public rebuke. The paragraph was well drawn up, and indeed it was animated with some just and awful severities of language; yet he had not courage enough to chide the guilty, nor to animate his voice with any just degree of zeal. However, the good man did his best, he went into the pulpit, and read them a chiding.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His conduct is just the same when he designs his address in his paper to any of the softer passions; for by the coldness of his pronunciation, and keeping his eye ever fixed on his notes, he makes very little impression on his hearers. When he should awaken senseless and obstinate sinners, and pluck them as brands out of the burning, he only reals to them out of his book some words of pity, or perhaps a use of terror; and if he would lament over their impenitence and approaching ruin, he can do no more than read them a chapter of lamentation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since there are so many of the kindred of Lectorius in our nation, it is no wonder that some of them arise to vindicate the family and their practice. Do not the English sermons, say they, excee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those of other nations, because they are composed with so much justness and accuracy, and by careful reading they are delivered with great exactness to the people, without trusting o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence to the frailty of the memory, or the warmth of sudden imagination? I am sure it may be replied, that if the English sermons exceed those of our neighbours, the English preachers would exceed themselves, if they would learn the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of reading by the glance of an eye, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s never to interrupt the force of their argument, nor the vivacity and patho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their pronunciation; or if they made themselves so much masters of that they had written, and delivered it with such life and spirit, such freedom and fervency, as though it came all fresh from the head and the heart. It is by this art of pronouncing, as well as by a warm composure, that some of the French praechers reign over their assemblies, like Cicero or Demosthenes of old, and that, with superior dignity and power, as is seldom seen now-a-days in an Englisn audience, whatsoever esteem may be paid to our writings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A paper with the most pathetic lines written upon it, has no fear or hope, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal or compassion; it is conscious of no design, nor has any solicitude for the success; and a mere reader, who coldly tells the people what his paper says, seems to be as void of all these necessary qualifications, as his paper is.</Q></P>
<BIBL>WATTS'S <HI>Miscellaneous Thoughts,</HI> No. xxvi. p. 104—106, 8vo.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. BLAIR shall conclude the authorities quoted upon this point: <Q>With regard to the pulpit, it has certainly been a great dis∣advantage, that the practice of reading sermons has prevailed so universally in England. This may, indeed, have introduced ac∣curacy; but it has done great prejudice to Eloquence; for a discourse re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, is far inferior to an Oration spoken. It leads to a different sort of composition, as well as of delivery; and can never have an equal effect upon any audience. The odium of the different sects, about the time of the Restoration, drove the established Church from that warmth which the sectaries were judged to have carried too far, into the opposite extreme of a studied coolness, and composure of manner. Hence, from the art of persuasion, which preaching ought always to be, it has passed, in England, into mere reasoning and instruction; which not only has brought down the Eloquence of the Pulpit to a lower tone than it might justly assume; but has produced this farther effect, that, by accustoming the public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar to such cool and dis∣passionate discourses, it has tended to fashion other kinds of pub∣lic speaking upon the same model.</Q> BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 43, 44.</P>
<P>The same author says elsewhere, <Q>that the practice of reading sermons is one of the greatest obstacles to the Eloquence of the Pulpit in Great-Britain, where alone this practice prevails. No discourse, which is designed to be persuasive, can have the same force when read, as when spoken. The common people all feel this, and their prejudice against this practice is not without foun∣dation in nature: what is gained hereby in point of correctness, is not equal to what is lost in point of persuasion and force?</Q></P>

<P>AFTER a sermon has been composed, and even committed to memory, much still remains for the Orator to execute; for
<PB N="230" REF="032455_0241_0FF26CD09D57B800"/>the success of the composition depends upon the manner of delivery.</P>

THE ancients regarded delivery as a very considerable branch of the art of Oratory, and have carried this talent to a degree of perfection, of which we have no idea.</P>

FOR such as are merely desirous to avoid the most common faults in declamation, the following are the principal precautions which ought to be adopted.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="032455_0244_0FF26C52F8A2E6C0"/>
THEY should indulge a favourable hope of the success of their performance at the very moment of delivery, that they may speak without reluctance or uneasiness. They should be deeply penetrated with their sub∣ject, and recal what passed in their mind while engaged in composition. They should diffuse throughout every part of the discourse the ardour with which they are animated. They should speak authoritatively, in order to arrest the attention of the hearers. They should avoid the declamation of an actor, and be cautious of introducing theatrical pantomime in the pulpit, which will never succeed. They should begin with pitching their voice at a proper medium, so that the
<PB N="234" REF="032455_0245_0FF26CDB33A5C188"/>tone may be capable of rising without pro∣ducing discord, and of being lowered without becoming inaudible. They may be well assured, that the effect is lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, when they at∣tempt to strain their voice to the highest pitch; that hawling repels attention instead of assisting it, and that the lower they sink their voice in pathetic passages, the better they are he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. They should not allow them∣selves to make use of a multiplicity of ges∣tures; and they should especially guard against laying an undue stress on a particular word in the general movement of a period. They should avoid all corporeal agitation, and never strike the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lpit either with the feet or hands. They should vary the inflec∣tions of their voice with each rhetorical figure, and their intonations with every para∣graph. Let them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and im∣pressive accents of nature, in deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as well as in composition. In a word, with the rapidity of utterance, they should blend pauses, which are always striking when but seldom used and properly timed.</P>
<P>SUCH are the innocent artifices, which a Christian Orator may render subservient to the success of his ministry.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Advices respecting an Orator's action are to be found in FENHLON'S <HI>Dialogues,</HI> ii. p. 65—76; in BURC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'S <HI>Essay upon Pronunciation and Gesture;</HI> also in Dr. JAMES FORDYC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'S <HI>Sermon on the Eloquence, and Essay on the Action of the Pulpit.</HI> See also many useful hints concerning the ministerial character and conduct in the same author's <HI>Charge at the Ordination of his Successor, the</HI> Rev.

BOURDALOUE'S action was very impressive, although he continually had his eyes shut when he was preaching.</P>
<P>MASSILLON spoke also with much autho∣rity, but scarcely made use of any action.</P>
<P>THE Abbé POULLE and the Abbé RENAUD, and Orator of older standing, have united, to their other talents, action of a higher qual∣ity; and there is no preacher of this century who has been able to equal them in this re∣spect.</P>
<P>IT is an excellent method to revise a ser∣mon as soon as it has been preached. The pulpit discovers its beauties and its faults; and, provided the Orator is skilful to remark the impression that the discourse makes upon the auditory, it is easy for him to observe the weak or prolix passages, which require to be improved.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION LX. <HI>Of Motives to excite the Emulation of Christian Orators.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I AM aware that these multiplied correc∣tions occasion very painful labour to Christian preachers. Nevertheless, that which is really disheartening and seriously alarming to us in our ministry, is neither the study, which composition requires, nor the restric∣tion, which memory imposes on us; but the discouragements increasing as we grow old in our profession▪ the lassitude, which per∣petually attends the repetition of sermons, no longer delivered but with reluctance; the certainty of discovering faults continually in our discourses, and of finding ourselves, thus, not only very much on this side perfection, but even below the level of our own abilities; and, above all, the indifference of our age for religion. Hence it is, that persons attend to religious instruction, as they would to a pro∣fane spectacle; that they are desirous of re∣ducing our zeal to the sacrifice of the most important truths, and the most forcible Elo∣quence, to I know not what frivolous subject, or rhetorical flowers; and that, in fine, it seems as if it were expected of us to degrade
<PB N="237" REF="032455_0248_0FF26D1189946C50"/>ourselves, both as Apostles and Orators, in order to please the multitude.</P>
<P>THESE draughts are, no doubt, bitter. It is, however, necessary to swallow them, should we only succeed in reclaiming one wicked man to virtue, of preserving one wretched man from despair; in a word, of preventing one single crime from the earth.</P>
<P>AH! what more can be necessary in order to quicken our ardour? Is there a virtuous and feeling mind, that can despise such a de∣lightful reward?</P>
<P>WE shall have fulfilled the end of our vocation, when we render ourselves useful to men; in their felicity we shall receive an in∣demnification for all our sacrifices: the pleas∣ing remembrance of our youthful labours will serve to delight the solitude, and to console the inactivity, of our advanced years; and, when Death sahll lay his heavy hand upon our eye-lids, we shall each be able to say to that great GOD, whose laws we have publish∣ed <Q>O my Father! thou hast given me thy children to instruct. I restore them to thee better. Remember all the blessings, which thou hast poured upon thy people, through the instrumentality of thy ministering ser∣vant. Let the tears, which I have dried up, the tears, which I have excited when
<PB N="238" REF="032455_0249_0FF26C7F495C7FE8"/>pleading in thy name, plead with thee on my behalf. I have been the instrument of thy clemency: make me hereafter the ob∣ject of thy tender mercies.</Q></P>
<P>EVERY other inducement, doubtless, dwin∣dles to a point before these great objects.</P>
<P>IF it were allowable, when entering upon this course of life, to hold human encourage∣ments in any degree of estimation, I should say, without dread of contradiction, that, with a view of reviving the relish for Evan∣gelical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oquence, the same means are made use of among us, which excited so successful an emulation in the excellent days of the age of Louis XIV.</P>
<P>NEVER, in the record of ecclesiastical pre∣ferments, have Christian Orators found a more distinguished attention paid to their labours, nor a more marked good will to reward their talents.</P>
<P>AFTER having, in this manner, unfolded the ideas, which have arisen in my own mind, on the subject of Eloquence, I am not afraid of being charged with having sacrisiced the rules of taste to the purposes of my own vanity.</P>
<P>THE theories of individuals are, for the most part, only indirect apologies for the compositions of their authors; and, despair
<PB N="239" REF="032455_0250_0FF26D14468D71C8"/>of equalling the ancient models, often gives rise to extravagant systems.</P>
<P>BUT if my rhetorical writings be inferior to my theory, I can, at least, willingly bear this testimony, from the bottom of my heart, that, in deriving the Principles of Eloquence from nature, or from the chief performances of our greatest masters, I have been actuated by no other motive than a warm attachment to truth, and the most earnest solicitude to contribute to the advancement of science.</P>
