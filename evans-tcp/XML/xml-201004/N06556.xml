<HEAD>THE PROPHETIC <HI>Numbers</HI> OF DANIEL and JOHN CALCULATED, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Was led by extraordinary impres∣sions to compute the numbers of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> who are both be∣loved prophets, and the counter∣parts to each other: They contain the beginning and end of all the great confusion, which sin has brought into the works of ALEIM JEHOVAH.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I was led to consider, where the theocracy of the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> ended, after the ancient departure out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when his judges or rulers were cast off by their kings.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="008320_0003_10347A6023230A78"/>
This fell out in 427 years, when <HI>Saul</HI> was chosen: Then was I led to consider, that about this time the ANTICHRIST of false interpretation for the gospel was nourished with great ease and honour at the courts of emperors, eastern and western, who did as much destroy the spirit of the gospel, as the kings of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> did the spirit of the law and the prophets.</P>
<P>This was near 1095 years before the CHRIST of the ALEIM of <HI>Moses,</HI> who is the king or head of <HI>Israel,</HI> promulged again the theocracy of the triune JEHOVAH in the beloved Son.</P>
<P>From this date I was conducted to calculate the last number of <HI>Daniel</HI> in the close of his prophecy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 12.</NOTE>—<HI>blessed and holy is he, that cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days, but go thy way 'til the end be; for thou shalt rest and stand in the lot at the end of the days.</HI></P>
<P><HI>These two numbers make</HI> 1762.</P>
<P>In verse 9 <HI>Daniel</HI> was bid to go his way; for the words were <HI>closed up</HI> and <HI>sealed,</HI> 'til the <HI>time of the end:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 9.</NOTE> that is, it would not be revealed, 'til the season of its fulfilling was coming on and ex∣piring. The LOT here is a term of the law, the LORD'S PORTION, or the FIRST-BORN, the leading character of that dispensation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="008320_0004_10347A5E4E645F38"/>
Within four years of this time, under the gos∣pel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIXTUS III. in the year 432.</NOTE> there was a pope, whose name was Sixtus III. which period nearly agrees.</P>
<P>This ought to appear an extraordinary mark to such, who believe, that the <HI>whore of Babylon,</HI> and <HI>the great city,</HI> signify the corrupt church of Rome only: since the THIRD SIXTH in all the languages of Babylon the great, answers to 666.</P>
<P>But if this number should compose the name of the BEAST, it must be remembered, that the <HI>whore rideth</HI> on the <HI>scarlet or purple coloured beast;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xvii. 3.</NOTE> and therefore it cannot be interpreted con∣fusedly. For she appears the same as Babylon the great, which contains all the peoples,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 5.</NOTE> and multitudes and kindreds and tongues. We must allow that all mankind rise out of water and blood of <HI>fallen Adam,</HI> and the <HI>spirit</HI> of this <HI>outer court.</HI> This is the whore, sitting over these <HI>waters.</HI> The 70 tongues arose in <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall, though the typical history be shewn at old Babel. It means then in spiritual prophesying, that the carnal and corrupt heart, the animal man of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> the heart and flesh of fallen <HI>Adam,</HI> had so defiled the gospel by base in∣terpretation, that the power of the beast was set up upon the <HI>new spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John v. 8.</NOTE> <HI>water and blood</HI> of JESUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. xi. 19.</NOTE> to be poured out upon all of the old flesh. Then the schools and sons of the prophets were confined to a few only: And the two great leaders of the church in this age were <HI>Jerome</HI> and <HI>Austin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Corin. xiv. 29, 30, 31, 32.</NOTE> we need not say more.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008320_0005_10347A5CCC45F7C0"/>
The world, the corrupt heart set up the beast, a false interpretation to save the crucifying and living and dying with Jesus, because he had done all, as was pretended, and carried away the law and the prophets;<NOTE PLACE="marg">John v. 5, 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> instead of the bles∣sed Jesus opening the law and the prophets, and fulfilling his mighty powers and spiritual priest∣hood in them, of a <HI>new spirit, and water and blood,</HI> the <HI>one holy seed</HI> and <HI>work</HI> that he had been, and will be doing till sin, and misery its wages and curse, are no more,—<HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>As the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the baseness and submission of other churches of <HI>Africa,</HI> had the greatest hand, in bringing in one confusion and false lip of interpretation after another, she may be considered as an eminent <HI>Antichrist,</HI> full of false tongues and stammering lips;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah xxviii. 11.</NOTE> but in what light can she answer to the name <HI>Mystery</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> the great, which comprehendeth all the <HI>peoples,</HI> and <HI>tongues,</HI> and <HI>languages,</HI> and <HI>nations;</HI> and in <HI>her was found the blood of pro∣phets, and of saints,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xviii. 24.</NOTE> <HI>and of all that were slain upon the earth.</HI></P>
<P>Can words describe the <HI>World</HI> more plain∣ly, which our saviour uses so continually in the gospel of <HI>St. John,</HI> and he scatters this word through his epistles. This disciple of the <HI>bo∣som</HI> best knew the mysteries, the deep and prophetic sense of his master's kingdom.</P>
<P>There are many antichrists, saith this belov∣ed writer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John ii. 18.</NOTE> who understood the full force and spirit of prophesying: And antichrist will come, that is, an eminent one, the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and another, even <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008320_0006_10347A5B03400800"/>
Yet it must be considered, that the one tem∣per and disposition, which slew all the true in∣terpreters and messengers of the revelation of God, in every part of the <HI>great city,</HI> which is the world, slew them in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in <HI>Rome;</HI> under <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and in <HI>Gentilism:</HI> They slew their bodies, or rejected their interpretation by a false lip and lying tongue set up against them, which is the spiritual death of prophesying in the sense of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> evangelical prophets, and of the ancient prophets.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I was led to compute the time, when the temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> was seized by the old typical <HI>Babylonians</HI> after its building; and the spiritual prophets, or interpreters of that temple had written.</P>
<P>The siege of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> fell out in 428, and the taking of the temple, about <HI>two</HI> years after.</P>
<P>This is near the same time as before, and would expire by adding the 1335 days of <HI>Daniel,</HI> in 1763, or 1765. This is near the same time when <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the PROPHET of his own spiritual, and heavenly temple disappear∣ed in a manner: For after he had shewn the MYSTERY which he had been doing among the 70 nations, or tongues of the world, by all the rites and figures of the law; how he had killed and slain and poured out the false water and blood of <HI>Adam,</HI> and had been pour∣ing his pure and holy water, and blood and spirit, which he brought to light on the cross?
<PB N="8" REF="008320_0007_10347A58E39C7868"/>how he had done all the parts of the true sa∣crificer and feeder of his people: Then came the time, when the true temple and all its spiritual and inward priesthood was over∣thrown; when things imputed were setting up instead of the royal blessings implanted and ingrafted into the old dead tree, the tree of mortal flesh, through him as the <HI>tree of life,</HI> with <HI>twelve fruits,</HI> mediating or coming be∣tween our foul water and blood. For these holy powers were to quicken the dry bones, the dead earth, and vessels of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fallen ta∣bernacle, into living spirit, and water and blood, by continual union, touch and inha∣bitation of the Lord of the GLORY, or the CHERUBIM overshadowing the world, as the <HI>temple.</HI></P>
<P>I was then led to compute the number 666, by adding the <HI>one thousand two hundred</HI> and <HI>sixty</HI> days for the prophesying of the two wit∣nesses in sackcloth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE> before the false prophets should be cast down.</P>
<P>My mind was guided to consider the time, when <HI>Antiochus,</HI> a type of an insolent power, and defiler of the sanctuary, that should rise up in the new temple, did all those impie∣ties and mocking insults on the old temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Mac. i.</NOTE> as recorded in <HI>Maccabees,</HI> for <HI>three</HI> years and an <HI>half.</HI> This is the number of time so famous among the <HI>Jews</HI> on his account.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lightfoot. Vol. II. p. 513.</NOTE> This event fell out about 168, or 167, before <HI>Christ:</HI> Deducting these numbers from 1926, it will bring us to 1758, or 1759, when the slaying of the witnesses at the end or towards the ex∣piration of their testimony will most likely
<PB N="9" REF="008320_0008_10347A5761C45538"/>begin. This slaying of prophetic testimony does not mean only shedding blood, but mak∣ing merry over it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joshua vii. 21.</NOTE> as this <HI>golden tongue</HI> of <HI>St. John,</HI> which is covered, describes the peoples, and tribes, and languages, and nations, rejoic∣ing over the prophets;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> not suffering their dead bodies, their rejected prophesies, to be put in graves; that is, forgot and buried in silence, but talking of their testimony, and sporting with it.</P>
<P>Again, The first <HI>name</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> the great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xvii. 5.</NOTE> wrote on her <HI>forehead</HI> is <HI>mystery:</HI> Mystery always signifies something concealed, and to be explained. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word for mystery, according to the pronuniciation of the natural vowels, or sounds is sater. <HI>Samech Aleph Thau He Resh</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> 60 1 400 5 200.</P>
<P>Let us then join <HI>Antiochus</HI> under the law to his antitype under the gospel, who cast out the <HI>mystery of a life hid with Christ in</HI> GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. iii. 3.</NOTE> to a mystery of iniquity and folly, of <HI>Jewish</HI> rites and figures with an heathen sense and meaning: And this will bring us to a time, when the false prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thesal. ii. 9.10.</NOTE> the lying and stammer∣ing lip of interpretation, had got into the tem∣ple, and was working his <HI>lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and speaking lies in hypocrisy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>We shall approach the time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Babylonian Thalmud 500, or 505 years after CHRIST.</NOTE> when the <HI>Ba∣bylonian Thalmud,</HI> that spiritual captivity of the treasures, the sacred vessels and holy myste∣ries of <HI>Moses</HI> was proclaimed with universal joy and triumph. At this time such a doctri∣nal
<PB N="10" REF="008320_0009_10347A55B463AAB8"/>of the sacred truths, of the new temple of <HI>Jesus</HI> was set up, and drove out <HI>Moses</HI> and his prophets, and <HI>Jesus</HI> the son of the new house of glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. iii. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> his prophets with golden tongues.</P>
<P>Count 1260 days for the two witnesses in sackcloth from both periods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE> as they are dis∣puted: They will make 1760, or 1765. Near this time <HI>Babylon</HI> with her strife of 70 tongues will be put to silence by the golden bells,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalms xxxi. 20.</NOTE> on the typical garments, which are so many tongues and voices proclaiming the great high priest <HI>Jesus</HI> saviour,—<HI>Amen.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke ii. 10.</NOTE> Soon the false and lying tongue will be put to silence all over the earth; for the Lord of the glorious <HI>Cheru∣bim</HI> will take to himself those only, who were made holy by his own living, and divine substance being offered into their new temples, and present∣ed into them: For this only must be the power of his endless life freely communicated to them. He is the prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. vii. 16.</NOTE> priest and king in all his spiritual characters, and powers given of rich grace into his peculiar subjects, and children.</P>
<P>Others expect <HI>Christ</HI> to be a <HI>sin offering,</HI> which <HI>Paul</HI> the prophet says, was only once to be of∣fered in our flesh:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ix. 24, 25, 26, 27.</NOTE> But the people of his ho∣ly spirit, water and blood, who are truly par∣takers of his spiritual and divine nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Peter i. 4.</NOTE> were to feed on him as their daily meat and drink-offering, and peace-offering from the altar of fire: From whence he is feeding his great congregation, and covering them under the glory of all the cherubim burning to the four corners of the earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. i. 4. Chap. x. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008320_0010_10347A5409A3ED10"/>
Now this mystery of <HI>Babylon</HI> the great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalms xxxi. 20.</NOTE> is just opening; and a first-born <HI>lot</HI> out of her strife of tongues, and many peoples, and languages, and nations, will be brought under the tents of <HI>Sem,</HI> who is the first born of God the Aleim:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ix. 26, 27.</NOTE> Who is the <HI>man child</HI> of <HI>Psaiah</HI> and of <HI>St. John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. lxvi. 7.</NOTE> and the prophets. They will dwell with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xii. 5. the <HI>son,</HI> the <HI>strong male.</HI></NOTE> our elder brother the <HI>first born-Jesus</HI> under that glory, where the general assembly and church of all the first-born have been hid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xx. 15. xxx. 6.</NOTE> and will be made known at the brightness of his coming:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. i. 26.</NOTE> For all who are born of the flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. vii. 13.</NOTE> by the will of man, and of his spirit, water and blood, and live after the flesh, will die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John iii. 6.</NOTE> and their carca∣ses will be an abhorrence unto men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. lxvi. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>After these calculations I was led to consider the 2300 days of the <HI>eighth</HI> of <HI>David.</HI> which were appointed for cleasing the sanctuary.</P>
<P>An <HI>host,</HI> or holy number as some interpret, <HI>was given against the daily offering by reason of transgression,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. viii. 12, 13.</NOTE> to <HI>tread down the truth to the ground, and it practised and prospered.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>daily offering</HI> is the whole compleat ser∣vice of the temple every day, which was do∣ing for the nations of the four corners of the earth.</P>
<P>So long as this number was secret, so long should <HI>Babylon</HI> the great, and her kings, and peoples, <HI>tread down truth;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. viii. 13.</NOTE> <HI>and the sanctuary under foot;</HI> institute and support false religion in opposition to the one revelation of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="008320_0011_10347A525DF53850"/>
In the <HI>thirteenth</HI> verse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 13.</NOTE> the saint who is call∣ed the revealer of secrets, or wonderful <HI>Num∣berer</HI> in the margin, answers that the time was 2300 <HI>days.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Evening.</NOTE></P>
<P>Why they call this HOLY ONE the wonderful numberer does not appear, unless they took it from the ancient Jews, who apprehended some great truth concealed: For it is properly the <HI>one just</HI> or HOLY ONE answered to the question.</P>
<P>However it is declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 17.</NOTE> that <HI>at the time of the end, should be the vision</HI> of that number.</P>
<P>I was then led to count this number, from the time of <HI>Belshazzar</HI>'s impious feast and moc∣kery with all the great lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan v.</NOTE> and concubines of his vast kingdom, when they drank out of the sacred vessels of the temple, which his fa∣ther had taken away.</P>
<P>This is only a <HI>typical Babylon,</HI> for all nations and tongues were not shut up in this empire.</P>
<P>This fell out in 538 years according to the most exact chronologies we have, and it runs down to 1762 under <HI>Christ:</HI> The kingdom of this type was taken at midnight, and himself slain by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who put an end to the captivi∣ty of <HI>Judah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Judah</HI> is a figure of the first-born. <HI>Judah</HI> on whom the blessing was to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. xlix. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> because he was to be <HI>Joseph</HI> the younger in the flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John v. 7.</NOTE> a <HI>sin-offering</HI> of love, to the glory of <HI>Aleim Jehovah,</HI> the <HI>Father, word,</HI> and <HI>holy spirit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008320_0012_10347A50B1A31F70"/>
This feasting and drinking out of the ves∣sels of the temple expresses in that fine way, in which GOD hides himself from prophane and mocking tempers; it expresses too the blindness of the christian age we are now in, who use the vessels without the sense of the new temple.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Peter liii, 3. Jude 18. Col. i. 26. Chapt. iii. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Jude</HI> describe the last times abounding with scoffers and mockers at sacred truths, at the mystery of a life <HI>hid in Christ with</HI> GOD, the whole godhead.</P>
<P>This profanation was the first committed, after the going out of the prophesy; and it describes the general character of the sensual heart and life on earth: <HI>Cain, Ham, Ishmael,</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI> are contained under this picture, who drank out of the vessels and figures of religion without attending to the great and spiritual blessings. It points out the age when they should through all the kingdoms, and tongues and nations of the world, be drunk with wealth and pleasure, 'till <HI>Jesus</HI> should come on a sud∣den, and <HI>cut them asunder,</HI> and <HI>give them their portion</HI> in the fire and lake of Hell.</P>
<P>Our time cannot be affirmed to be exactly true; but at midnight, that is, at an hour un∣expected, as at the passover in <HI>Egypt,</HI> (though they had warning) will <HI>Babylon</HI> the great fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xi. 4.5.</NOTE> and the delivere of all the holy people, or segullah selected out of all nations shall come:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xix. 5.</NOTE> They shall go out of captivity to their own country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mal. iii. 17.</NOTE> the new Heavens and new earth un∣der the true Cyrus <HI>Christ,</HI> King of kings, and Lord over the lords of the whole earth. God appointed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> at the first deliverer in type,
<PB N="14" REF="008320_0013_10347A4F0B051738"/>by <HI>Isaiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. xliv. 28. xlv. i.</NOTE> one of the prophets of the whole gospel dispensation.</P>
<P>Hence we must look for this overthrower of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the <HI>great city,</HI> and all kingdoms, and cities and peoples of the world under the gospel, when the Lord shall be exalted in that day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah. ii. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> The prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> speaks, that he (the <HI>Messiah</HI>) shall confirm the covenant with many for <HI>one week;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. ix. 28.</NOTE> and in the <HI>division</HI> of the week, he shall cause the <HI>oblation</HI> to cease, and for the over-spreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined, shall be poured upon the desolate.</P>
<P>The 70 weeks of <HI>Daniel</HI> are 490 days;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. ix. 27.</NOTE> by centuries 49,000 years, or by <HI>ten</HI> times <HI>seven hundred</HI> for each week, they will make 7000 years according to the mystic sense of the an∣cient <HI>Jews,</HI> who allowed 7000 years for the week of the world. <HI>Seven</HI> of these weeks run up to the <HI>seven</HI> weeks of pentecoste, and to the <HI>seven</HI> sabbatic years to the jubilee. In equal por∣tions, they make 49,000 <HI>years:</HI> For <HI>ten</HI> weeks, allowing a century or double jubilee for each day, make the equal portions of the whose <HI>seventy</HI> weeks, and reduce them to <HI>seven</HI> sabbatic years.</P>
<P>On this ground a week of years in <HI>Daniel</HI> is 7000. In verse 26th he says, <HI>desolations are cut off,</HI> by which we may understand, that the time of them were shortned, as our Lord has told us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. xxiv. 22.</NOTE> that <HI>those days</HI> should be shortened for the elect's sake. It may be hence concluded,
<PB N="15" REF="008320_0014_10347A4D5E22FF10"/>that the judgments of God will be for <HI>these days,</HI> or <HI>first week</HI> of the gospel happened, by reason of the great sins, and impieties of all nations, and christian kingdoms in a more high degree.</P>
<P>This particular circumstance <HI>St. Paul</HI> also mentions: He <HI>will finish</HI> the <HI>account</HI> or num∣ber, and cut it short in righteousness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ix. 28.</NOTE> for a short account will the Lord make on earth.</P>
<P>Our Lord was crucified on the <HI>sixth day of labour,</HI> or <HI>servile week</HI> of the <HI>old law;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. xxvii. 46.</NOTE> but he expired about the <HI>three</HI> in the afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark xv. 53.</NOTE> at the <HI>ninth</HI> hour, the time of offering the <HI>evening sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>It was about the <HI>sixth hour</HI> and there was darkness over all the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xxiii. 44, 45, 46.</NOTE> until the <HI>ninth</HI> hour when <HI>Jesus</HI> gave up the <HI>spirit.</HI></P>
<P>This period does not fill up a whole day, but falls short of a portion; wherefore the spi∣ritual sense (in which alone all parts of the holy high priest's life will be fulfilled in a dignity becoming his high name) cannot compleat a <HI>sixth</HI> day of a <HI>thousand</HI> years for every day of the <HI>servile week.</HI></P>
<P>The piercing of his side before the <HI>sun of this world</HI> set, between the 3d and 6th hour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. xiv. 8.</NOTE> appears to be the time of the great pouring his living waters and precious blood into the righ∣teous;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. xlvii. 5.</NOTE> and pouring out the vials of his wrath upon all the wicked, in a double cup for all corrupt christians, and much more for those who have a purer gospel.</P>

This time of a portion of 12 hours for a day is mentioned by the greats prophet <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John ix. 12.</NOTE> <HI>are there not</HI> twelve <HI>hours in a day:</HI> But these hours cannot be measured, to pro∣portion them to <HI>one thousand</HI> years, because we are not informed how soon he was pierced after his death.</P>
<P>At this time the daily offering to the nati∣ons of the earth of the precious water and sanc∣tifying blood, the <HI>ransom,</HI> will be taken away from them; for the <HI>bridegroom</HI> will be gone, and this period of the <HI>one week</HI> from the 70 of <HI>Daniel,</HI> will be shortned for the over-spead∣ing of abominations.</P>
<P>At that time there will be no more oblation of his <HI>spirit,</HI> and <HI>water</HI> and <HI>blood,</HI> shed out of the <HI>glory</HI> of the <HI>Cherubim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John v. 6.</NOTE> which covers all kingdoms peoples and tongues and nations under its spreading wings, and its <HI>wheels</HI> are high and lifted up touching Heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Somewhere in the cutting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. i. 15, 18.</NOTE> or division of this day, will the sun be darkened, which now lightens kingdoms and cities and peoples to follow the <HI>lusts</HI> of the <HI>flesh,</HI> and the lust of the <HI>eye,</HI> and the <HI>pride</HI> of <HI>life;</HI> and above all to the <HI>lust</HI> of <HI>wealth:</HI> The stars will drop down from the heavens at once,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I John ii. 16.</NOTE> in one hour.</P>
<P>Then the rocks will be rent, the graves shall be opened, and the dead will arise, and all na∣tions shall stand before <HI>the son of man.</HI></P>
<P>The 120 years of typical <HI>Noah,</HI> were short∣ened: The <HI>Aegyptians, Chaldees</HI> and <HI>Persi∣ans</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="008320_0016_10347A4A0C98C310"/>preserved the typical sense of the 120 years, and interealated a month at the end of every <HI>hundred</HI> and <HI>twenty</HI> years, which they called the GREAT MOON.</P>
<P>Our Lord's <HI>body</HI> was 36 hours in the grave, which is the long day of typical <HI>Joshua</HI> in his great victory;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joshua x. 12, 13, 14.</NOTE> for then the sun was stopped in his course: In the <HI>antitype</HI> is meant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah xxviii. 21.</NOTE> that the <HI>sun</HI> of <HI>righteousness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. xlvi. 4.</NOTE> in the going down of this day, will arise and break forth with heal∣ing in his <HI>wings</HI> to the <HI>general assembly</HI> of the <HI>first-born</HI> out of all nations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. xii. 23.</NOTE></P>

<P>The whole congregation of the <HI>first-born</HI> and <HI>first fruits,</HI> is going with <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>head,</HI> to enter the <HI>new earth</HI> and <HI>new heavens,</HI> while <HI>the heavens that are now, are kept in store,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. iii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>reserved unto fire against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</HI></P>
<P>The VEIL of the hidden <HI>temple</HI> shall be o∣pened; the wicked and scoffer will see the kingdom of <HI>Christ</HI> within, brought to light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xvii. 21.</NOTE> and shall howl with astonishment, fear and an∣guish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark iv. 11.</NOTE> at their madness and folly in scorning the <HI>mystery</HI> of the <HI>kingdom.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xiii. 11.</NOTE></P>

<P>The word which is translated in the midst of a week,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Robertson</HI> Thes. ling. sanc. in Cheth. root. <HI>101.</HI></NOTE> signifies any division, and not an equal one, as <HI>Kimchi</HI> has shewn: This appears the concealed meaning of a <HI>time, times,</HI> and the dividing of <HI>time</HI> twice mentioned in <HI>Daniel.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. vii. 27. xii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>It seems then to refer to the cutting of the last part, whatever portion GOD shall appoint for it.</P>
<P>This circumstance is answered again by <HI>St. John,</HI> where the <HI>woman</HI> is nourished in a <HI>wil∣derness</HI> for a <HI>time, times,</HI> and half <HI>a time,</HI> from the <HI>face</HI> of the <HI>serpent.</HI></P>
<P>Both these prophets <HI>beloved</HI> of their <HI>Lord,</HI> (whose deep sense veil the whole kingdom of <HI>Jesus</HI> from the beginning to the fall of <HI>Baby∣lon of death,</HI> and <HI>hell</HI> and <HI>sin</HI>) bear a view to their <HI>master</HI>'s language; that those days, or the time of <HI>one week</HI> should be cut off, or shor∣tened; and for the reason assigned by <HI>Daniel,</HI> the <HI>over-spreading</HI> like a flood, of abominable impieties of the whole world: <HI>This Age</HI> is the exact picture of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xviii. 14.</NOTE> when <HI>Babylon</HI> falls, and all her fine and goodly things for which her soul lusted, are no more to be found.</P>
<P>The only number remaining is that of the 1290 days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 11.</NOTE> in the last chapter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>This number extends 30 days above the 1260 of <HI>St. John:</HI> And it is to be explained
<PB N="19" REF="008320_0018_10347A46AB82F638"/>in the great sense for the <HI>ages</HI> of <HI>ages</HI> to suc∣ceed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. vi. 13.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. iii. 11.</NOTE> which are mentioned in several places.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiv. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>These must be divided in a double portion for jubilees, and a third for centuries, the aera of the <HI>Gentile</HI> church.</P>
<P>860 jubilees make 43,000 years: The first 7000, or one <HI>week</HI> or <HI>age</HI> being added, they fill up the <HI>fifty</HI> days of <HI>Pentecoste,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. xxiii. 15, 16.</NOTE> and the <HI>fif∣tieth</HI> year of jubilee;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. xxv. 8, 10.</NOTE> the feast of <HI>weeks</HI> and the seven great <HI>sabbaths</HI> of <HI>years.</HI></P>
<P>The last 430 of this number reckoned by centuries of <HI>Japhet</HI> the Gentile, amount to the same number. If they are compounded, they make 86,000 years: But as the 14 sabbatic years at the end of every 6000 must be consi∣dered as years of <HI>release,</HI> by adding these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xxi. 2.</NOTE> the double year of 100,000 is filled up:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xv. 9, 12.</NOTE> 100 years was typical <HI>Noah</HI> in building his ark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii. 13, 14.</NOTE> for all creatures; where <HI>Ham</HI> the <HI>servant</HI> of <HI>ser∣vants, goes in with his brethren</HI> Shem <HI>and</HI> Japhet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiv. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>The 1260 days of <HI>St. John</HI> can give only 84,000 years; and the 14 sabbatic years will not give the two octaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. xxiii. 15.</NOTE> the eighth day to each period, which is the crown of <HI>pentecoste,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xvi. 9.</NOTE> and of <HI>jubilee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. xxv. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>We must remember, that this <HI>first</HI> great <HI>week,</HI> or <HI>first age</HI> will be shortened: It will not run so many sabbatic years, nor years of jubilee, nor centuries, as the prophesies re∣garding <HI>time</HI> declare, in many places <HI>produced</HI> and explained.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="008320_0019_10347A44A8901FF0"/>
The prophesy of Mr. <HI>Love</HI> ought not here to be omitted, as it is not his own. I have not seen a word of his, or the calculations of any one.</P>
<P>Let us give the account of this prophesy in his own expressions.</P>
<P>"The prophesy which <HI>Jehoram</HI> copied off, and translated out of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> language as it is written on <HI>Seth</HI>'s pillar in <HI>Damascus:</HI> Which pillar is said to have stood since before the flood, and was built by <HI>Seth, Adam</HI>'s son, and written by <HI>Enoch,</HI> the <HI>prophet;</HI> as likewise the holy precepts whereby the patriarchs walk∣ed, before the <HI>law</HI> was given to <HI>Moses,</HI> which was also engraven on the said pillar, whereof many <HI>Jews</HI> have copies in their own language, written on parchment, and engraven on brass and copper: But the alteration of the date makes them to stagger at it, not knowing that the dates were to be altered by the birth of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>"First, this prophesy is intitled, a <HI>short work</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI>'s in the <HI>latter age</HI> of the <HI>world.</HI></P>
<P>"Great earthquakes and commotions by sea and land shall come in the year of God 1756.</P>
<P>"Great wars in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>America</HI> 1757.</P>
<P>"The destruction of popery, or <HI>Babylon</HI>'s fall, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>"The anger of GOD against the wicked in the year 1759.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="008320_0020_10347A4325C37EE8"/>
"GOD will be known by many in the year 1760. And this will produce a great man.</P>
<P>"The stars will wander, and the moon turn as blood in 1761.</P>
<P>"<HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America</HI> will tremble in 1762.</P>
<P>"A great earthquake over the whole world in 1763.</P>
<P>"GOD will be universally known by all: Then general reformation and peace for ever; when the people shall learn war no more: Hap∣py is the man that liveth to see this day."</P>
<P>These things have hitherto had an accom∣plishment sufficient for the opening of a vision of prophesy. Popery is his own conception of <HI>Babylon;</HI> and it's fall will be by the spirit of <HI>prophesying,</HI> that is, of <HI>interpreting</HI> sacred writ, which is the <HI>testimony</HI> of <HI>Jesus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xix. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>The year 60 appears the rising of the wit∣nesses, when greater gifts of the <HI>spirit</HI> will be poured forth over the christian world.</P>
<P>The other effects 1761, 1762, 1763, ap∣pear to be the physical changes, which the <HI>messiah,</HI> the <HI>Lord of the glory</HI> of the <HI>Cherubim</HI> is working, 'till he bring the glory to open view.</P>
<P>Spiritual prophesying, or unfolding the my∣stery of GOD, even the father;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. ii. 3.</NOTE> and of <HI>Christ</HI> (in whom are hid the treasures of wisdom and knowledge) will run like a a silent stream, and
<PB N="22" REF="008320_0021_10347A4179F11588"/>speak like a soft voice a <HI>Bath-col:</HI> It will es∣cape the carnal heart and eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. iii. 18.</NOTE> which have not the <HI>unction</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>great prophet</HI> in them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John ii. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>As for my own part I shall leave myself to be judged by the <HI>sons</HI> of the <HI>prophets;</HI> for the <HI>spirits</HI> of the <HI>prophets</HI> or interpreters of holy writ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xvi. 32.</NOTE> are subject to the <HI>prophets.</HI></P>
<P>The false prophet of the <HI>law,</HI> and of <HI>Christ,</HI> is the false representation of the <HI>mistery</HI> of the gospel: And this is that character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. ii. 9.</NOTE> which <HI>worketh lying wonders</HI> even to deceive if it were possible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiii. 13.</NOTE> the chosen people of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> No manifestation of the divine good∣ness; no execution of judgments ever came without a <HI>double voice</HI> of comfort to the <HI>good</HI> and of terror to the <HI>wicked.</HI> It is of small mo∣ment who is the mouth, an angry <HI>Jonah,</HI> or a <HI>Daniel;</HI> a covetous <HI>Balaam,</HI> or a <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>For these are public characters, designed for the edifying of the whole church, whatever may be the end of the messengers: for both good and bad men have been made instruments to cut off all evasion and objection on this point.</P>
<P>No time carries more marks than the pre∣sent <HI>world</HI> and <HI>age</HI> for the fall of <HI>Babylon the great,</HI> when every kingdom is looking out for more gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xviii. 13.</NOTE> and silver, and precious stones, and odours, and wine and ointment, like the old <HI>Jews</HI> at the first revelation of the <HI>mystery,</HI> of the <HI>Messiah:</HI> He will come as in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> and <HI>Lot</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> He will hide himself under the spiritual glories of his kingdom from
<PB N="23" REF="008320_0022_10347A3FF3EBE690"/>the prophane, and sensual; from the <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>noble according to the flesh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 26.</NOTE> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the humble and lowly in heart, in whatever part of the earth, or station of life, shall find <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. lxii. 32.</NOTE> revealed in their souls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John iii. 29.</NOTE> and shall be ready with the <HI>holy garment</HI> of the <HI>bride,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. ix. 15.</NOTE> to meet the <HI>bridegroom</HI> at his open manifestation and <HI>marriage.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xxi. 2.9.</NOTE></P>
<P>He, that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">xxii. 17. Mat. xi. 15. Mark iv. 9. Luke viii. 8. Rev. ii. 7.</NOTE> AMEN.</P>
<P>We will now draw all the numbers into a short view.</P>
<P>The 70 years of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in chap. xxv. 12. xxix. 20. were understood by <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. ix. 21.</NOTE> and they appear to be the 70 weeks of years which <HI>Gabriel</HI> informs him of at the 24th verse.</P>
<P>These 70 weeks make 490 days; and these days allowing a century or double jubilee for each day, which is the end of time with the church of <HI>Christ</HI> among the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> they will make 49,000 years. This number will answer to the <HI>seven</HI> weeks of <HI>Pen∣tecoste,</HI> and to the <HI>seven</HI> times seven years up to the jubilee. Thus are filled up the seven Ages of the gospel, before the <HI>Messiah</HI> shall have finished his glorious conquest over <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>death.</HI></P>
<P>The proper <HI>theocracy</HI> of <HI>God</HI> was thrown off by ask∣ing a king about the year 427:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. viii. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> The theocracy of <HI>God</HI> by the <HI>Messiah</HI> under the gospel was departing about this time: The famous number of <HI>Daniel</HI> of 1335 days in chap. xii. 12. measured from this year of the <HI>Christ</HI> of God, runs down to 1762.</P>
<P>Within four years of this period we meet with the pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the third, or third sixth: by adding these we shall come to 1766.</P>
<P>The typical temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> was taken by the typical <HI>Babylonians</HI> in 430, but the siege of <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="008320_0023_10347A3E245AF220"/>began in 428 years after the building of the tem∣ple. Under the <HI>Messiah</HI> the <HI>prince</HI> of peace, and <HI>Lord</HI> of the true temple, spiritual interpretation ceased about this time. If we measure this period by 1335 days of <HI>Daniel,</HI> they will expire in 1763, or 1765.</P>
<P>The number of <HI>St. John</HI> of 666 and 1260 days for the prophets in <HI>sackcloth</HI> added together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE> make 1926 years. Measure this period from <HI>Antiochus</HI> who defiled the temple under <HI>Moses,</HI> 167 or 168 years before <HI>Christ,</HI> to his antitype of the gospel, or the power of <HI>Anti∣christ:</HI> This will lead us to the year of <HI>Christ</HI> 1758, or 1759.</P>
<P>Again. Let us compute the period of the <HI>Baby∣lonian Thalmud</HI> proclaimed after <HI>Christ,</HI> in the year 500, or 505: reckon 1260 days or years, before <HI>Meses</HI> and the <HI>Messiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi.</NOTE> <HI>two witnesses of God</HI> rise and come forth: and this will reach to the year 1760, or 1765.</P>
<P>If we reckon the number of <HI>Daniel</HI> in chap. viii. 12, 13. of 2300 days appointed for the cleansing of the <HI>sanctuary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. v.</NOTE> from <HI>Belshazzar</HI>'s impious feast, and the taking of the typical <HI>Babylon</HI> 538 years before <HI>Christ;</HI> this will conclude in 1762 of our time.</P>
<P>The <HI>cutting short</HI> of this first <HI>age</HI> of the gospel has been fully explained: So that the only number of <HI>Daniel</HI> remaining is the 1290 days from the taking away the <HI>daily oblation.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>These appear to be days of jubilees and centuries, whose meaning I have opened in page 18 and 19; according to my light, and the gift of <HI>God</HI> in <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>witnesses</HI> of God in <HI>prophetic numbers</HI> concur∣ring so nearly in time are left to speak for themselves. May the <HI>Christ</HI> of <HI>God anoint</HI> our eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. iii. 18.</NOTE> that <HI>we may see</HI> and be <HI>wise to understand</HI> the <HI>signs</HI> of the <HI>times.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 10.</NOTE></P>
