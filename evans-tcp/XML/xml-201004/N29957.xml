<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have given us lately a fine and just Dialogu∣e between a <HI>Dutch</HI> Magistrate and a <HI>French</HI> Hugonot Preacher; let me here present you with one between a Clergyman and a Quaker. It lately happened at a Meeting of some Gentlemen of our Country; and I was so taken with it, that as soon as I came home, I recollected what had been said on both Sides, and think I have done both Sides Justice. This Dialogue will shew that the Quakers are not such contemptible Reasoners as Men of more Learning and Name would gene∣rally make them; and that good Sense is suffi∣cient Match for Art, and some Sorts of Education.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clergyman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>am glad of this Opportunity of talking with you. It was what I wanted.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why didst not take it before? I never shunn'd thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am your Minister: It became you to come to me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I promise thee, thou art none of my Mi∣nister: I'll have none but of my own chusing. Be∣sides, if thou mindest thy Pride more than my Salvation, and art too great to come, to thy Pa∣rishioners, small is my Encouragement to come to thee: The Apostles stood not thus upon their Dignity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Apostles went to those who could not come to them</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to those that would not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>A modest Man would have doubted, and heard what I had to say.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, hast thou thy self no Doubts about the Streightness of the Way thou art in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Certainly no.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then am not I more modest than thou art? I often doubt, and go to God with my Doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But you should go to him in proper Way.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go to him in Prayer, and in his Word: Knowest thou a Way more proper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Do you understand his Word?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is thy Fault, and the Fault of thy Bre∣thren, if I do not. The Clergy have translated it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But there are still many difficult Places in it which the Clergy understand best.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Clergy understand them, then are they not difficult to Laymen, who know all Lan∣guages: And why do not the Clergy explain them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>That is their Business.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they ill understand their Business, since they vary and quarrel so much about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>They only differ in Controverted Points.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more don't thee and I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But I mean Points controverted amongst us.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to say, ALL Points. Even where you say, you believe alike, you explain different∣ly; which sheweth a manifest Difference also in believing. And art not thou unreasonable to ex∣pect, nay to demand Union amongst the People, when the Clergy themselves are the Authors of Disunion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Therefore we renounce such Clergymen.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they renounce thee. And do not the Quakers act wisely to renounce you ALL, as you ALL do one another?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="039823_0004_10148B4F95A4FC30"/>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You speak harshly, and untruly; There are Numbers of us who adhere together in our Senti∣ments.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there are Numbers who adhere toge∣ther against you, and yet call themselves of the same Church with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am sorry for it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>So oughtest thou to be for charging me with speaking untruly, when thou thy self bearest Testimony to the Truth I speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But you go too far.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not, nay, I will go farther, and main∣tain, that the Numbers thou boastest of in Union with thee, were every Man to explain his Belief his own Way, would all vary from thee, and from one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I do not think so: However, their varying in Belief is no Reason against believing.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is a good Reason why every Man should have his own Belief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then there will be no End of Confusions.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more there is not in Opinions and Doctrines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>And is not that a deplorable Case?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>So is the Fall of <HI>Adam:</HI> canst thou cure it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>They are not parallel Cases.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, thou may'st as easily bring back <HI>Adam</HI> into a State of Innocence, as all his Posterity into one Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What! can't I reason a Man into my Opi∣nion?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, if he like thy Opinion, and thy Rea∣soning: Perhaps he will think them both stark naught.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>That may be his Fault.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it may be thine. How are thy Opi∣nions better than mine? I think them worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>They are warranted by the Word of God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="039823_0005_10148B81EF562A00"/>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think mine are: I'll promise thee I try them by that Word, which I think I can interpret as well as thou can'st. I'll tell thee further, that I am satisfied the God of Mercy never damn'd any Man for mistaking it; for I take it, in reveal∣ing his Word he mocketh not Men, by giving them a Riddle instead of a Revelation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You know little of Scripture, if you do not know there are Places in it which you cannot un∣derstand.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor can'st thou. As to those Places, tho' they may be his Will, yet I am sure they are not his reveal'd Will, because he hath not reveal'd it; and if I take thy Interpretation and Conjec∣tures for his Word, then do I believe in thy Word, and not in his. Now, where hath he commanded me to believe in thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He has commanded you to believe me when I speak in his Name.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so art thou to believe me when I speak in his Name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But I am his Ambassador.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I do not believe thee, because thou speakest in thy own Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, does not St.</HI> Paul <HI>say,</HI> We are Ambas∣sadors in his Stead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Art thou St. <HI>Paul?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am only his Successor; he himself is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>So are his Gifts and Miracles: Can'st thou work Miracles? If not, how dost thou succeed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I preach the Gospel which he preach'd.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I, and bear my own Charges as he did his; and why should I pay thee for doing what I can do as well my self? I do not find that <HI>Paul</HI> has left thee any Wages, and I am sure he has left thee nothing else; his Epistles are left to every Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="039823_0006_10148B51B288B8C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, he has left Ministers to wait upon God's Ordinances in the House of God. I am one of those Ministers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, as thou art a Christian, thou must needs know that every House is alike to Almigh∣ty God, who filleth Heaven and Earth, and dwel∣leth not in Houses made with Hands: And as to what you call Ordinances, thou knowest that the Apostles administer'd none. Every Man did it for himself, and it was done from House to House. There were no bloody Sacrifices in the Religion of Jesus, and consequently no Priests, their only Office being to slay Beasts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dare you say that God has appointed no Bo∣dy in his Church to preach and explain his Word?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I neither do, nor dare say it; and thou may'st spare thy big Words. He hath left every Man to preach it to another; nor hast thou any more Call from him than every one of thy Parish hath. If thou wouldst resemble the Apostles, go and preach to the unconverted without Money, and without Price. Thy whole Parish believe in Christ already, as much as thou do'st, and did before they knew thee. They have the Bible themselves; and if thou bringest them any Ti∣dings that are not in it, and that they them∣selves see not in it, they ought not to believe thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You argue very insincerely with me. Just now you contended that I had none of St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Gifts; and now you would have me go without those Gifts; and do what he did with them; namely, travel over the World, and convert the unconverted.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I only would shew thee, that as thou dost not resemble him, thou art vain in pretending to succeed him; and so far I reason consistently, as thou dost weakly, if thou claimest all his Re∣verence, without any of his Merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="039823_0007_10148B83B6F605C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I do not set up for the Abilities of St.</HI> Paul; <HI>but still have Qualifications superior to Laymen.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are those Qualifications?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I know Languages; I have had an Uni∣versity-Education; and—.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>All these are civil Qualifications, common to all Men, who would be at the Pains and Charge. Laymen understand <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> as well as thou dost. The Gospel wanteth no Embelishment from those thou callest <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace;</HI> and Christ crucified, is not sought nor found in Uni∣versities, nor indeed the Flesh crucified. If I am not misinformed, they abound with young Men who are too often Sinners, and with old Men who are no Saints. They are Schools of Words; but the Gospel hath nothing to do with thy Lo∣gick and vain Philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I was going to tell you too, that I had stu∣died Divinity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Knowest thou any Divinity, but what is in the Bible? and have not I the Bible? I think, and am sure, that it is a plain and intelligible Book, at least as much of it as is meet for a Chri∣stian, and to turn it into Doubtfulness, and Dis∣putation, and Science, and Gain, favoureth not of Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This is insolently said: Who turns it into Gain?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>He who maketh a Gain of it; which is worse than Insolence, whereof, thou dost ground∣lesly accuse me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! do you not declare against Preach∣ers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already told thee, I do not: I would have all Men Preachers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, Tinkers, Taylors, and Coblers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, beware of thy Words: What were the Apostles? They were no University Gentry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="039823_0008_10148B5471E6CBA8"/>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But you say we want the Apostles Gifts.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish thou couldst confute me. How∣ever, we have all of us the Apostles Books; and canst thou mend them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No. But I can enforce them; and the La∣bourer is worthy of his Hire, if you will believe St.</HI> Paul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he laboureth for himself, why should I pay him? I profit not by thy Labour, why shouldst thou profit by my Substance? I believe <HI>Paul;</HI> but <HI>Paul</HI> hath given thee no Property in my Pigs and Barley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But the Law has.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Law is not <HI>Paul:</HI> But I perceive, whoever is the Giver, thou wilt be the Taker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir, you are rude.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? Because I do thee Justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Let me tell you, Sir, there is Reason in it, as well as Law.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy Interest may be Reason to thee: But thou wilt be put to it, to give me a Reason for giving thee something for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don't you know, that, under the Law, the Priests had their Lot in the Land?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: But they were <HI>Jewish</HI> Priests, or Sacrificers. Art thou a <HI>Jew?</HI> and dost thou kill Cattle, as they did? And wouldst thou reconcile Judaism to Christianity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No; I would only shew, that it is reasona∣ble that Priests should have a proper Appointment.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already shewn thee the Unreasona∣bleness of having any Priests in Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>In this you saucily differ from all the Soci∣eties of Christians in the World.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not differ from Christianity; nor am I saucy in differing from those that do. The bles∣sed Jesus hath left thee no Legacy, that I know of, nor so much as named thee in his Will.</P>

<SP>

<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Man grows profane.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou meanest unanswerable. Is it any Article of thy Creed, that Truth is profane?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Your having no establish'd Ministers amongst you, is enough to render your Sect odious to all Sorts of Christians.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have Religion establish'd amongst us. Is Religion odious in thy Eyes, where there is not a Livelihood to be got out of it? We establish no Clergy, lest they should disestablish the Peace and Purity of the Gospel; and whilst our Preach∣ers have Grace, we reckon they will seek no Mo∣ney. We therefore do not keep in Pay Men who sell Speech.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Truth is, the Speeches utter'd amongst you are not worth buying.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, no Speeches in the House of God ought to be bought, nor the Tabernacle be turn'd into a Shop. Why sellest thou thine, which, as Report saith, are not alluring? <HI>Freely you have receiv'd, freely give.</HI> Friend, what did the Gos∣pel cost thee? Or why should we purchase it at thy dear Price, when we have it in our Houses in more Purity and Plainness than thou canst give it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, and you understand it by the Spirit!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou sayest it. We trust to the Spirit to direct us, who is promis'd to all that ask him. Thou trustest to <HI>John Hammond</HI> and <HI>Daniel Whit∣by</HI> for Direction. Whether art thou or we best directed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I shall not believe that the Spirit is the Author of the Enthusiasm and Dreams that are found amongst you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Carnal Man discerneth not the Things of God. Paul</HI> was call'd a Babbler by the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI> whose Priests, who were many, had no Il∣lumination,
<PB N="11" REF="039823_0010_10148B57D36EF9C0"/>
but being Men of dark and voluptu∣ous Minds, and feeding upon Sacrifices and Of∣ferings, preferr'd <HI>Bacchus</HI> and his Grapes to the Spirit of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Comparison you would insinuate is im∣pudent and profane.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, Meekness becometh a Preacher. Thou hast the Passion of a Priest, but not the Meekness of a Minister of the Gospel. Why dost thou fall upon me with bitter Words, for telling thee a Fact, which, in Answer to thee, it was necessary to tell. Is it profane to say that the Heathen Clergy took Offerings? Nay, since thou dost urge me, dost not thou take Offerings? and did the Apostles take any? I have put thee be∣tween these Priests and the Apostles, that by com∣paring thy self with both, thou may'st see whom thou resemblest most.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>If this is not Profaness, I know not what it is.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Profaneness is not on my Side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Let me inform you, Sir, that for this Lan∣guage, in some Countries, you would have your Tongue cut out of your Head.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it; and praise God that I am not in those Countries, and that thou canst not bring those Countries hither. It is plain, thou appro∣vest their Barbarity, else why dost thou think it due to me? I beg thou wouldst not be provok'd, if I mention to thee once more the Example of the Apostles: Where did they justify Savageness and Severity to any Man for any Opinion, or any Words? Where did they ever talk to Pagans as thou dost to me, who am a Christian, and endea∣vour to possess the Temper of the Gospel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, you have a Form of Godliness: But—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, in the first Place, <HI>judge not:</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="039823_0011_10148B87F54E1E40"/>
and secondly, beware what thou sayest against Forms, for thy own Sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I say, if your Preachers had Power, they would quickly find Texts for Persecution.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess thou judgest by thy self; and thou judgest well. We know it; and therefore give them no Power, nor the Sinews of Power. Pride and Impatience are inseparable from it: It destroy∣eth all Humility, and maketh Men imperious, and Persecutors. Why are the Popish Priests more cruel and mischievous than Protestant Priests, but because they have more Power? And why is the Pope the most mischievous of all Priests, but because he hath most Power?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You carry every Thing too far. Preachers of the Gospel ought to be kept above Contempt.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, they who are rich in Grace, want no other Riches to save them from Contempt; and they who are rich without it, ought to be contemn'd. Riches may render them formidable; but Piety only, and a holy Conversation, can make them reverenced. Revenues do not place them above Contempt, but only encourage them to despise their People. The Poverty of the Apo∣stles was great Part of their Glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Of all People I think the</HI> Quakers <HI>have the least Pretence to glory in their Poverty.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Thou seemest in this, to aim at being se¦vere, but I feel it not. Our moderate Wealth is the Effect of our honest Industry, and we are no ashamed of it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Repetitions are silly, why shuttest not thou thy Common-Prayer Book, which aboundeth therein? And as to our Language, if the Spirit was a Dealer in Style, why doth <HI>Paul</HI> write such bad <HI>Greek,</HI> as the Learned say? But I can tell thee, we have many Men amongst us, who preach in as decent Language, and as free from Tauto∣logies, as thou canst read out of thy Note-Book. I could mention the different Efficacy too, and the manifest Disinterestedness of our Preachers; but I spare thee.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Spare me! I fear you not.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, nor I thee, since thou defiest me. I have found thee no terrible Adversary, which may not be the Fault of the Man. Thy Bishop would not do better, tho' his Pay is great∣er.</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>It is too true, he could not: Reason is thrown away upon you, and such as you.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The same Difference as there is between a good Understanding, and a wild hot Imagination.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy Words sound well, but thy Reason∣ing is naught. Is not the Gospel above the best Understanding? and was it not to the <HI>Greek</HI> Phi∣losophers Foolishness? They had as much Sense as thou or thy Bishop, and knew their own Lan∣guage better, but could not comprehend the In∣carnation and Crucifixion of God, nor Original Sin and the Resurrection. The Light of the Spi∣rit hath therefore no Analogy with the natural Understanding, as you your selves contend when you would confute or punish People for following their Reason, and departing from your Systems. I must tell thee too, that the Spirit warmeth both the Heart and the Imagination; for which Cause <HI>Festus</HI> reckon'd <HI>Paul</HI> mad, and the first Christians sought Martyrdom. And if—</P>

<P><HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>are Enthusiasts.</HI></P>

<P>It is well for thee they do not. But to keep thee to the Point if I can, I tell thee, that we are no Enthusiasts, and I will give thee a Rea∣son: We pretend to no more of the Spirit than

<P>I thank thee; thou givest a Reason why it should cost nothing. The Spirit is not bought nor sold, nor are the Works of the Spirit: Where∣fore he neither receives Fees, nor claimeth Dues. <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> who traded in Conjuration and Spells, was profanely for making a Commodity of the Holy Ghost, and offered Money for him, doubt∣less with a Design to make more. Thou knowest his Doom; and yet, Friend, there are many <HI>Si∣mon Magus's</HI> in the World, yea worse than <HI>Simon Magus.</HI> There be many who raise great Reve∣nues out of the Spirit, yea, and have him not.</P>

<P>Thou sayest well. Now by what Work of ours do we appear to be Enthusiasts? We are sober in Society, sober in our Families: We fear God, and have an awful Reverence for his Word,

which we read continually, insomuch, that for this our Love to the Bible, some of thy Brethren laugh us to Scorn, and scoffingly say, that we are <HI>Bible-mad.</HI> We fast and we pray in private, and preach and pray in our religious Assemblies, and we have universal Charity. We open our Purses chearfully for the Support of the Publick; we are dutiful Subjects, and meddle not in Factions; we maintain all our own Poor, and contribute not the less to thine; and even the Clergy have Part of our Substance. Seest thou in this true Character, the Marks of Enthusiasm.</P>

<SP>

<P>We do, and thou may'st. Friend, our Devotion and holy Exercises are not taken out of a Book, but begin first at the Heart; and when the Heart dictateth not, we speak not. Our God∣liness is not performed like a Play by Rehearsal.</P>

<P><HI>This is a villanous Reflection upon the Common-Prayer.</HI></P>

<P>I rejoice in it? I like all Devotion that is paid to God, and warranted by his Word. I find not Fault with thine, only it is not meet for me, who find more Fervency in my own, and more Edification. And what is the End of Devo∣tion but Edification?</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>Yes, the Glory of God.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, the Rule of Certainty.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is Certainty. Other Certainty than this is not found amongst Men, who must all an∣swer for themselves, and therefore must all wor∣ship God, as each thinks best.</P>

<P><HI>Which wou'd introduce a thorough Anarchy in Worship.</HI></P>

<P>So there is in Faces; and what Harm en∣sueth? God made Faces different; canst thou make them uniform?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><HI>No; but Minds are different from Faces. The Mind may be alter'd by Reasoning.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes for the worse, as well as the better; and so may Faces be altered by good or bad Keeping. But thou may'st depend upon it, Minds will always vary as infinitely as Faces; and for ought I know, more as their Substance is more delicate and quick, and knoweth no parti∣cular Figure and Dimensions.</P>

<P><HI>But in Case of Obstinacy and Disobedience, what Remedy is there?</HI></P>

<P>None. God only can judge the Heart; which he only can see. Thou may'st think me ob∣stinate: But I declare sincerely I am not; and thou in Charity oughtest to believe me. If thou dost not, thou art not a good Christian; and if thou wouldst punish me, thou art no Christian. I do not think thou art obstinate, and adherest to Opinions thou dislikest; and I would not hurt a Hair of thy Head, no, not tho' I thought thee obstinate.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, but you are only a private Man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, all Christians, as Christians, are private Men. There is neither High nor Low in Christianity, but in the Degrees of Grace; and to found Dominion in Grace, is indeed Fanati∣cism, as the Clergy, in their Disputes with the Presbyterians, have justly call'd it.</P>

<P>We our selves are Part of the Church of Christ, and give no Disturbance to the rest; and if thy Pride is disturb'd at our Christian Liberty, the Scripture condemneth thee.

<P>Friend, there are Clergy who do so; who for their own Pride and Debaucheries starve the Laiety that feed their Luxury; who receive all their Power and Revenues from the Laiety, and leave the Laiety none. And there are others who have great Benefices for the Exercise of Religious Functions, and never exercise any, but convert them into <HI>Sine Cures,</HI> or leave them to a Hire∣ling. This, Friend, is worse than Impudence, whereof I am not guilty. Does the Spirit call them to this? For if I am not deceiv'd, you all declare your selves call'd by the Spirit.</P>

<P>It is the <HI>Scripture-Stile.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>To Man as well as to God. Besides, Friend, let me tell thee, that the using the plural Num∣ber to single Persons, was begun in Flattery to Princes and great Men; as was also the Ceremo∣ny of the Hat and the Knee, and came to be practis'd as Marks of Adoration paid to Men, who were thereby set up in God's Stead; and where they cannot go that Length, yet they feed natu∣ral Pride, and make Differences amongst Men, where Nature hath made none.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We do not use them as Marks of Adorati∣on.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe thee; but still they are Marks of Insincerity, and of a Submission which is not due from Man to Man. Friend, these civil Ce∣remonies are of evil Efficacy, and apt to deceive the Mind into a slavish and superstitious Vene∣ration for Persons. They make unnatural Distan∣ces in Society; and set Men too far above and below one another. By such Steps Kings came to be worshipp'd as Gods, as several of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors formerly, and lately thy Friend <HI>Louis</HI> was deified by many of thy <HI>French</HI> Brethren.</P>

<P><HI>Commend me to their human Prudence! the Quakers will make no Man their Enemy by Their Zeal for Christianity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, thy Abuse ends in Praise. The Quakers use no Man as an Enemy for his Religi∣on; and they who do have not Zeal, but Fury and Fanaticism. Our Saviour and his Apostles
<PB N="34" REF="039823_0033_10148BA31107E8B8"/>
had no such Zeal. Ill Usage, Fierceness, and Barbarity, convince no Man; nor is any Man made a Christian by Rage and Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It would be great Pity that such as you should make any: A Pagan converted into a Qua∣ker, makes but a sorry Exchange.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those Words would fit the Mouth of a Pagan better than thine; and a Quaker is better qualified to reason with a Pagan than thou art: We have nothing to desire of him but to be a Chri∣stian, and we gain neither Money nor Authority by his Conversion. But with what Face can such as thou art, tell a Nation of Heathens, <Q>Gentle∣men, be of my Religion, and in Requital I will be your Lord and Master, and take the Tenth of all you have, and all else that I can get: None of which can ever return to you again, let me use it, or abuse you how I will.</Q> And yet can Men of thy Spirit and Pretensions reason in Sincerity at any other Rate with any Set of Men in the World.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Man raves.</HI>— Can People pay too much for their Souls?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>They ought to pay nothing: The Blood of Christ is already paid. Is not that sufficient? And dost thou really confess that thou wouldst not save Souls without Payment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I will bear no more.— This is audacious beyond human Patience!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doctor, Nothing is beyond Christian Pa∣tience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too much Liberty makes you insolent.—We shall find some other Way of confuting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou meanest Force, which is the Cham∣pion of bad Reasoning, and a bad Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hold your Tongue, Prater.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have Liberty of Speech from Christ and the Law. Wouldst thou restrain it by thy Breath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It is pity thy Breath were not restrain'd.</HI></P>

<P>Friend, God forgive thee. Farewell.</P>
