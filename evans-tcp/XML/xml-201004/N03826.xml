<HEAD>AN ANSWER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to your Desire I now send you some Remarks upon Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> GAR∣DEN'S LETTERS to the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD, which you may either <HI>publish</HI> or suppress, as you think they deserve.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Remarks on Mr. GARDEN'S <HI>First</HI> LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>First</HI> consists chiefly of an endeavour to prove Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> guilty of a Self-Contradiction, founded upon what he saith in his Sermon <HI>Entitled,</HI> <Q><HI>What think ye of Christ.</HI> pag. 18. <HI>viz.</HI> Observe my Dear Brethren the Words of the Article, Good Works are the Fruits of Faith, <HI>and follow after Justification.</HI> How then can they <HI>precede,</HI> or be any ways the cause of it? No; our Persons must be Justified before our Performances are <HI>Accepted</HI></Q> Upon which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> observes, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> (hath ex∣plain'd) this Article into a Contradiction to his own Doctrine, since he hath taught, <HI>that a true Faith necessarily preceeds Justi∣fication;</HI> and the latter part of the Article saith, <HI>that Good Works do necessarily spring out of a true and lively Faith.</HI> From
<PB N="2" REF="004705_0004_100DBD3C22C3F6A0"/>both which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> thinks it will follow, that Good Works do in fact go <HI>before Justification.</HI> The Argument is all con∣tained in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI> "Now if Good Works do ne∣cessarily spring out of a true and lively Faith; and a true and lively Faith necessarily preceeds Justification, the conse∣quence will be, that <HI>Good Works do not only follow after Justi∣fication, but preceed it also.</HI></P>
<P>This he assures us is a plain Consequence. But I am apt to think it is a plain Consequence to none, who have not that <HI>Scotch Second-Sight</HI> he speaks of; i. e. an Ability of seeing that which is not. Indeed if Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had said, that <HI>Faith necessarily preceeds Justification</HI> any <HI>space</HI> of <HI>Time, tho' ever so small,</HI> he would have owned in Effect that Good Works <HI>go before Justification as well as follow it;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> might have sang <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um</HI> with a much better <HI>Grace</HI> than he doth at present. The whole turns upon this single Point: If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> hath said, that Faith preceeds Justification, any real space of Time; <HI>Actum est;</HI> he must fall before his Adversary. But if he doth not hold this Thing, the Commissary triumphs without any Victory.</P>
<P>Now what Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> holds, as to Faith's preceeding Justification, this Reverend Gentleman tells us himself. In pag. 19. he saith, <Q>That some sew, who disturb, insult and abuse their Neighbours for differing from them (meaning Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and others) suppose that <HI>Faith and Justifica∣tion are coexistent,</HI></Q> and <HI>that there is no space between the first Act of a justifying Faith and Justification for Good Works to be exerted in.</HI> That is in other Words, that Faith <HI>preceeds</HI> Justifi∣cation, not in Time, but only in the order of <HI>Conception.</HI> Well then, this being Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Idea <HI>of Faith's preceeding Justification,</HI> (his Enemy himself being Judge) wherein doth it appear that he hath explained the Article into a <HI>Contradiction to himself?</HI> Doth it follow that because he holds <HI>Faith and Justification to be coexistent</HI> that therefore they are <HI>not coexistent;</HI> that because he supposes there is no room for Good Works to be exerted in between them, that therefore he supposes there is some room for them? If these are no Consequences, then Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is no Conqueror. How naturally might his own Words be returned to him again! <HI>Away with such con∣fused and contradictory Gibberish!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004705_0004_100DBD3C22C3F6A0"/>
Surely this Man of Logick, when he comes to see there was no <HI>Knot</HI> at <HI>all,</HI> will <HI>wish he had been Asleep when he challenged Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>to untie it if he could;</HI> and be heartily <HI>asham'd of this same confident boasting.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Remarks on Mr. GARDEN'S <HI>Second</HI> LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Whitefield</HI> having given this <HI>Gentleman</HI> to understand that <HI>be</HI> was too warm for a Dispute; and desit'd him to peruse the Sermon again, and confute it in <HI>Print</HI> if he could. He Answers in his Second Letter, <Q>That he is free from Warmth, and not willing to be put off in a Mat∣ter which was of so much Importance to his own Soul, and the Souls of his People: and therefore tells him what he hath firmly believed, and taught his People, beseeching him in the most solemn Manner to restore him, if <HI>therein</HI> he hath departed from the Gospel, and the Articles of his own Church.</Q></P>
<P>What he firmly believes and hath always taught his Peo∣ple, he faith is this, <Q>That Good Works do as necessarily spring from a true and lively Faith, whither before or after Justification as Light and Heat do the Sun</Q> It is well worth the while to Inquire here what he means by a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lively Faith.</HI> And this he tells us very honestly in Pag 9. Line 1. <HI>That it is a Faith actually producing Good Works.</HI> This then being the settled meaning of a true and lively Faith, if we consider aright, we shall find that the amount of what he ushers in with so much Solemnity, is only this; <HI>viz.</HI> That he hath always <HI>firmly</HI> believed, and taught his Hearers, that <HI>Good Works always spring from the Faith that produceth Good Works;</HI> or to be plainer still; that the Faith <HI>which produceth</HI> Good Works, <HI>produceth</HI> Good Works; than which it is impos∣sible any thing should be <HI>more Orthodox,</HI> or <HI>less Instructive.</HI> 'Tis needless for him to desire to be set more right in this Matter: Nay as he hath always taught his Hearers this Doc∣trine, so let him teach it to them still, for tho' it will do them no manner of Good, it may do them <HI>less</HI> Harm than other Doctrines they might hear in lieu of it. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> to do him Justice, did not attain to this unlucky Expression <HI>Proprio Marte.</HI> It seems rather to be a Form of Words, <HI>venerable</HI> for <HI>Antiquity;</HI> their very <HI>Giants in Divinity</HI> speak the same Things,
<PB N="4" REF="004705_0005_100DBD3E455518D8"/>and feed their People with the same <HI>wholesome</HI> but not very <HI>nourishing Food.</HI></P>
<P>The good <HI>Commissary</HI> goes on in continuation of the Sen∣tence; Or <HI>that as the Body without the Soul is dead, so Faith without Works, whither before</HI> or after Justification, is dead also.</P>
<P>In which Words he makes no Declaration of his Idea of Faith in Man's <HI>Justification,</HI> since he only sets down a Scrip∣ture Passage, without explaining it; which he knows his Adversaries maintain to be <HI>their</HI> Belief as well as he that 'tis <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>This is just as if an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> should say, that he firmly believed and had always taught his Hearers, that <HI>Jesus Christ is the Son of God;</HI> and without explaining him∣self further, desire to be set Right, if in this he hath assered any Thing contrary to the Scriptures. Would not Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> himself think such an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian,</HI> had said <HI>nothing</HI> in all this, and therefore deserved no Notice. And yet this is exactly his own Case, in saying that he be∣lieves with St. <HI>James,</HI> that Faith <HI>without Works is dead,</HI> and desiring to be restored, if he hath said amiss. Upon the whole, I have often heard of some who have a Talent of saying a great deal in a little: of others, whose Talent is to say a little in a great deal; and with these I incline to rank Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> tho' some critical Readers, may be apt to thrust him down to a third Class, alledging that thro' this whole Epistle he hath said just nothing at all:
<Q><L>Quid tulit hic Tanto Dignum promissor Hiatu!</L>
<L>Parturiunt Montes &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Remarks upon Mr. GARDEN's <HI>Third</HI> LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Garden</HI>'s third Letter, is as he saith, a Supplement to his former, and containing a few Queries to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> concerning his Behaviour as a Presbyter of the Church of England. And he immediately attacks him with a Charge of wilful and malicious Slander against his Brethren Conformists, in the before mentioned <HI>Sermon</HI> pag. 18. <Q>You have accused them in that Sermon,
<PB N="5" REF="004705_0005_100DBD3E455518D8"/>saith Mr. GARDEN, <HI>of not Preaching the Truth as it is in Jesus, of falling from our Established Articles. and of Preaching only the Law, &amp; not the Way of Salvation by Jesus Christ;</HI> i. e. <HI>of Preach∣ing Justification by Works, and not by Faith only.</HI></Q> And then instead of saying in Words, (whatever he said in his Heart) <HI>Pudet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aec opprobria nobis, et dici potuisse et non potuisse refelli;</HI> he very couragiously asks Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> where are his Evi∣dences, what Proof he hath to support his Charge; and chal∣lenges him to make out the Assertion; which alas! is a thing <HI>Deplorably easy</HI> to be done. Accordingly I shall set my self to shew that the Clergy in general have run away from their own Articles, leaving them to the Dissenters to keep for them: And more particularly that of <HI>Justification by Faith only,</HI> crying up <HI>dead Works</HI> in Lieu of it. That they have Deserted the Articles Solemnly Subscribed by them, will appear from the Proof of these two Assertions, <HI>viz</HI> (1) That their Articles were Industriously compiled in opposition to what are <HI>now</HI> called <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors; and (2) that their Clergy generally speaking are Infected with this <HI>deadly Poyson;</HI> and spread the Infection with all their Might.</P>
<P>FIRST then I will attempt to make it evident that the Ar∣ticles were Industriously composed, to confront what are called <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors. And this is so plain, at first sight, that he that Runs may Read it in them. I doubt not but if a Million of unprejudiced Men, were to peruse them, they would to a Man construe them in this Sense. Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> therefore, a Man of chief Note among them, being both afraid &amp; asham'd of twisting them into the Sense of <HI>Arminius,</HI> acknowledges that they directly and expresly assert the <HI>Calvinian Doctrines,</HI> and therefore he advises the Convocation to alter them, or to lay them quite aside. (See Mr. <HI>Whiston's</HI> Preface to Dr. <HI>Mather.</HI>)</P>
<P>I know the Men of this Way have this Subterfuge, viz. that the Compilers of the Articles intended a <HI>double Meaning</HI> that so honest Men on both Sides the Question might see their own Principles in them, and subscribe them with a good Conscience. But this is a broken Reed to lean upon. For in the first Place, it doth not seem consistent with Simplicity and godly Sincerity, that a Number of Ministers of the Gospel, should avoid <HI>Plainness of Speech</HI> with their utmost En∣deavours, and study Words of <HI>an uncertain Sound,</HI> while they
<PB N="6" REF="004705_0006_100DBD4095BE8358"/>were declaring what they <HI>thought to be the Truth as it was in Jesus.</HI> And the very Gentlemen who use this Evasion, re∣flect greatly upon themselves, as well as upon the Authors of the Articles: For they do in Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that if they had been of the Number of the ancient Compilers, or were they now to compile Articles which contained the true Belief of the Church of England, they would easily be carried <HI>away with su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Dissimulation,</HI> and <HI>slily</HI> hunt after Words that have a double, and a treble Meaning too, if they could find them. Charity therefore for those worthy Compilers of the Articles, and a Regard to their own Reputation, should keep these Men from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imating that they were so <HI>full of Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty,</HI> and acted <HI>not uprightly, according to the Truth of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, (in the next Place) the <HI>Preamble to the Articles</HI> saith, that they were compos'd with this View, that there might be <HI>Uniformity</HI> touching the Doctrine of true Religion: and if <HI>Uniformity</HI> and <HI>Diversity</HI> be not the same Thing, then it follows, that the Compilers had no double Meanings in the Articles. In a Word, the Compilers say, that they design'd Men should be of <HI>one</HI> Mind; these Gentlemen say, they <HI>design'd</HI> Men should be of <HI>two Minds;</HI> and who could tell their Intent best, <HI>they themselves,</HI> or <HI>these Men,</HI> let the World judge. And as the Articles were compes'd upon the <HI>Calvin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stick Scheme,</HI> so have they been publickly understood ever since.</P>
<P>I am now, (which was the SECOND Thing) to shew that the Clergy, generally speaking, have r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn'd their Backs upon their own Articles, and have embrac'd, and propagated the Errors of <HI>Arminius.</HI> I say, generally speaking; because, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> observes, there are some sew who dare to ad∣here to the Doctrines of the Reformation, and are not asha∣med to preach what they have subscribed, but <HI>Apparent Rari:</HI> and those that do appear, have Trials of <HI>cruel Mockings,</HI> are treated <HI>as the filth and off-scourging of all Things;</HI> and as bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Enemies to what is <HI>now</HI> called the Church. This is so evident and a Thing they so much G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory in, that I shall not Summon any Arguments to prove <HI>Arminianism</HI> upon them, lest I come under that Censure of CICERO; <HI>Utitur in re non Dubia Tessibus non Necessar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is.</HI> Tho' it is probable that Mr.
<PB N="7" REF="004705_0006_100DBD4095BE8358"/><HI>Johnson</HI> may rise up, and disapprove of my taking this Point for granted. For in his second Letter to his <HI>dissenting Parishioners</HI> (i.e. to those Parishioners of his, that are not his Parishioners) he asserts it is very abusive to call him and his Brethren <HI>Arminians,</HI> since they don't hold every Thing just as <HI>Arminius</HI> did. But at this Rate, he might deny that there is an <HI>Arian,</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> upon the Face of the Earth, since those that are called <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> differ in some Things (full as much as they from <HI>Arminius</HI>) from their respective Founders, <HI>Arius</HI> and <HI>Socinus.</HI> However, if the Name of <HI>Arminians</HI> doth not exactly suit them; they must have some other Name invented for them, which sig∣nifies f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll as bad. Nay, as Multitudes of them are less Orthodox than <HI>Arminius,</HI> they had better be contented with the Name they have at present, for fear of a <HI>worse.</HI></P>
<P>I now proceed to the <HI>particular Charge</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> brings against his Brethren of the Established <HI>Clergy,</HI> viz. Their preaching up Justification by Works, and not by Faith only, as they are enjoined by their own Article. And hath Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> the Forehead to deny this? Yes, surely; and calls it a malicious Slander, without the least Foundation of Truth to support it; and yet poor Man, while he would clear the Clergy from this Charge, he owns the very Thing charg'd against them; and is a <HI>swift Witness against himself.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Doctrine (saith he) which you are so angry at, and censure as preaching Justification by Works, and not by F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th only, is this; That we are justified by Faith only, and not by Works; thus explained, viz. that we are justi∣fied by such a Faith as is true and lively, that is actually producing good Fruits or Works, and consequently <HI>im∣plying</HI> them, as a necessary Condition, (but no meritorious Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se) of our Justification. pag. 8, 9.</Q> That is, we are justified by such a Faith as <HI>implies</HI> Works. <HI>Works</HI> are part of this Man's Definition of <HI>justifying Faith;</HI> nay an essential Part according to Bishop <HI>Williams,</HI> whom our Author cires, as giving his own Sentiments. For "the Faith which justifies, (saith the Bishop) 'is a <HI>practical Faith,</HI> and to which <HI>Repentance</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>Obedience</HI> (i.e. Works) do belong as <HI>the essential</HI> Parts of it." Which is exactly the same that others mean when they tell
<PB N="8" REF="004705_0007_100DBD4225DFA5F0"/>us, that Faith in Christ, signifies Faith in him, and Faith∣fulness to him; an assent to the Gospel, and compliance with it. However, tho' Works are an essential Part of justifying Faith, yet if we will believe Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> they don't at all justify. Egregiously absurd! As if that which is the <HI>essential Part</HI> of a Thing, should have no Hand in what is done <HI>by</HI> that Thing. Common Sense will tell any one, that if Faith doth justify, whatever is Faith doth justify; and since <HI>Works</HI> are Part of Faith, an essential Part of it, <HI>Works</HI> must also justify in Part: And then what becomes of their <HI>Justification by Faith only,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is not ashamed to say, he and his Brethren maintain. His way to creep out is no better, nor bigger than this: by Faith he means Faith and Works too; and then very cunningly holds, that we are justified by Faith only. Which is just about as Good, as if a Man should say that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> only commanded in such a Battle, and that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was not with him: and being urged, that he asserted what was contrary to <HI>known Fact;</HI> should insist upon it, <HI>that it was a certain Truth that the Duke only commanded, and that the Prince was not with him;</HI> making out his Assertion thus; that by the <HI>Duke of Marlborough</HI> he always means, <HI>the Duke</HI> of <HI>Marlborough, and Prince Eugene too.</HI></P>
<P>But then if this is what Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> means, what need is there of fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, that we are justified by <HI>Faith only.</HI> For if his Defi∣nition of Faith be so large as to take in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> too, what is there left to justify: By saying that we are justified by Faith <HI>only,</HI> he seems to exclude something else which er∣roneous Men are apt to think doth justify; and in reality, he takes in every thing, and excludes nothing at all. And the Amount of this saying in his Mouth, and the Mouths of his Brethren, is only this; that Men are justified <HI>only</HI> by every thing, and by nothing else. It were to be wished therefore that they would be a little more Logical for the future, and only say, <HI>that men are justified by Faith;</HI> leaving the needless Word <HI>only</HI> out of all their Writings and Dis∣courses for ever.</P>
<P>The Truth is, Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Friends see so much of Justi∣fication by <HI>Faith only</HI> in the Scriptures of Truth, especially the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> that they are ashamed of holding
<PB N="9" REF="004705_0007_100DBD4225DFA5F0"/>any Thing else but Justification by Faith only themselves. But in as much as they don't <HI>believe it with the Heart;</HI> whenever they take it upon them to explain themselves, they are always found out. They try to say <HI>Shibboleth,</HI> as well as others; but they can't frame their Mouths for such an hard Word; after all their Endeavours an unavoidable <HI>Sibboleth</HI> comes and discovers who they are. Even the good Bishop of Lon∣don himself is an Instance, shewing how impossible it is that any one whose Heart is not Right in the Article of <HI>Justification by Faith,</HI> should express himself upon that Sub∣ject, to the Satisfaction of those who have a true Idea of it. For, when in his pastoral Letter, he exhorts his Clergy, <Q>to preach Justification by Faith only, so as to leave no Doubt upon the Minds of their Hearers but that Good Works are a <HI>necessary Condition of Justification:</HI></Q> 'Tis no better than if he had accosted them thus; My very good Presbyters, when∣ever you teach your People that they are <HI>justified by Faith only,</HI> never leave them till you have made them believe that they are not justified by Faith only: which Injunction of his Lord∣ship they are too careful to observe.</P>
<P>If it be said, that whatever Stress the <HI>Bishop,</HI> Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> and all the <HI>Men of this Device</HI> lay upon Good Works, they don't look upon them as meritorious Causes of <HI>Man's Justifi∣cation,</HI> but that they allow that the Death and Sufferings of Christ, are what alone merit Justification for the rebellious Sons of Men. I answer, whoever charges them with this? The <HI>Papists</HI> themselves own Christ's Passion to be the merito∣rious Cause that Justification may be had for us with God. But then doth it follow that because they don't hold Merit in this <HI>high</HI> Sense, that therefore they don't hold it in any Sense? That because they are not worse than the <HI>Papists</HI> in this Point, that therefore they are nothing like them?</P>
<P>But to come directly to our Charge against them; and it is this; That since Christ hath merited Justification for Man∣kind, they together with the <HI>Papists</HI> hold that the way for them to <HI>merit,</HI> or to be intitled to this <HI>merited</HI> Justification, are <HI>Works of Righteousness which they do</HI> The Reverend <HI>Commissary</HI> surely will not deny this Charge; for he hath ex∣pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly told the World, that, GOOD WORKS ARE MEANS OF OUR JUSTIFICATION. Page 30. Which is so contrary
<PB N="10" REF="004705_0008_100DBD448D90A418"/>to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and so agreab'e to his pretended <HI>Holiness at Rome,</HI> that were there a proper Opportunity, he would bid fair for an <HI>Euge</HI> from that <HI>Man of Sin.</HI> For upon this single D c∣trine it is, that the Papists build their <HI>Pilgrimages,</HI> supersti∣tious <HI>Austerities,</HI> and almost every thing else abhorrent from Reason and Scriptures. Could the <HI>Papists,</HI> but once <HI>disbe∣lieve,</HI> what Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> firmly <HI>believes,</HI> Popery would no lon∣ger cumber the Earth.</P>
<P>What is it that sets poor deluded Souls upon offering up Gists to my <HI>Lady of Loretto;</HI> upon trave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> after the <HI>Bones of Thomas a Becket,</HI> and other <HI>Saints</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h good and bad; and practising uncommanded Austerities <HI>upon their own Bodies;</HI> but a firm belief of Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Doctrine, in∣stilled into them by their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n blind Guides the Friars and Jesuits; viz. <HI>That</HI> GOOD WORKS ARE MEANS OF JUSTI∣FICATION! When they are in bitterness at any Time, thro' a Sense of their Guilt, and sollicitous <HI>to escape the Wrath to come,</HI> they immediately betake themselves to the doing of <HI>good Works,</HI> which they have been told are <HI>Means of Justification;</HI> and never leave doing them till they have done <HI>enough to be justified;</HI> to the neglect of that <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, which whosoever hath is <HI>justified,</HI> and whosoever hath not is <HI>condemned</HI> even tho' he had all the good Works of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or of the whole World of Man∣kind, plac'd to his Account, to screen him from the Wrath of an angry God.</P>
<P>And as Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Friends harmonize with the <HI>Pa∣pists</HI> in their belief of this Principle, that GOOD WORKS ARE MEANS OF JUSTIFICATION; so do they, in their Practice upon it. Instead of finding convinced Sinners to God for the obtainment of <HI>precious Faith,</HI> and exhorting them to give God and themselves no rest till they have a Princi∣ple of justifying and sanctifying Faith infused into them, by his almighty Spirit; they only tell them to forsake their Sins, and to do their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, and especially to abound in Works of Charity, which covereth a Multitude of Sins: which indeed is no more likely to convert them, than sending them to <HI>Loretto</HI> ordering them to tell their Beads, to whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Bodies for the Sins of their Souls; or to do an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dted other foolish Things, usually prescribed by the Romish
<PB N="11" REF="004705_0008_100DBD448D90A418"/>Priests on such Occasions. I say not, that the forsaking of Sin, and doing our Duty comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in God's Word, are not to be prefer'd to the abovementioned and such like Fool∣eries of the Roman Catholick Church. God forbid that I should say any thing like it! But this I say, that for Mi∣nisters of the Gospel to order convinced Sinners to reform their Lives, <HI>by departing from Evil and doing Good,</HI> without shewing them the necessity of a Principle of <HI>Faith</HI> infused in∣to them by the Spirit of the ever living God, in order to their Acceptance: I say for the reformed Clergy to do so (and all do so, that follow <HI>Arminius</HI> whosoever they be) is not taking a more likely way to convert them, and bring them into a justified State, than it they had bid them to en∣dow <HI>Hospitals,</HI> to go Pilgrimages after sacred Reliques &amp;c. For in the first Place, these Sinners cannot forsake their Sins as to the love and practice of them, not comply with the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies enjoined by God's Word, they being yet Strangers to the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> which alone can purify the Heart, and amend the Life. And then, in the next Place, could they <HI>cease to do Evil,</HI> and <HI>learn to do well</HI> better than any unregenerate Persons ever did; yet their Obedience not springing from <HI>Faith,</HI> and being <HI>depended</HI> upon by them, would be but a vain <HI>Oblation</HI> and no more incline their Ma∣ker to justify them, than if they had only <HI>visited</HI> and <HI>kissed Bones,</HI> told their <HI>Beads,</HI> and practised other sanctified Fop∣peries of the <HI>Church of Rome.</HI> The Truth is, these <HI>Teachers</HI> suppose <HI>that all Men have Faith</HI> (who live under the Gospel and are not Infidels) and therefore when they are applied to by their Hearers, inquiring <HI>what they shall do to be saved;</HI> they only tell them to live obedient Lives, and through the Merits of Christ, their imperfect Obedience shall be accepted of them: Which tho' it may appear plausible at first view, is in reality only to cause them to seek to be <HI>justified</HI> by the Works of the Law: A fundamental Principle taught by that Mother of Abominations the <HI>Church of Rome.</HI></P>
<P>It was not therefore without Reason, that our pious Fore∣fathers accused Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> with <HI>another mitred Brother</HI> in Iniquity of a Design to introduce <HI>Popery</HI> paving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Way to it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Arminianism,</HI> and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>latly <HI>the Denial of Justifica∣tion by Faith only.</HI> This being as <HI>Luther</HI> well observes <HI>Arti culus stantis vel cadentis E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chsioe</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004705_0009_100DBD4662AA7B30"/>
I do not pretend to say that these Men have any Design of a total Reconciliation with that Church; or that they are as bad as Papists: For Mr. <HI>Bradbury</HI>'s saying, is what I agree to; viz. <Q>That those Protestants who hold Justification by Works have only the <HI>Heart</HI> of Popery without the <HI>Head:</HI></Q> And 'tis certainly better to have only the <HI>Heart,</HI> than to have <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Heart</HI> too.</P>
<P>Thus we see that Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> who charges Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> with Faishood and Slander, for saying he and others held Justification by Works, hath in Fact owned the very Thing by saying <HI>Good Works are Means of Justification.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> I know, will be ready to say, as he hath said, that tho' <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>Means of Justification,</HI> yet <HI>they don't justify.</HI> Which is no better than it he should say, that Blows given with an <HI>Ax,</HI> were Means of cutting down a certain Tree; but yet the Tree was not cut down <HI>by those Blows.</HI> For my Part I should think that Means which do nothing are very poor Means; or rather no <HI>Means at all.</HI></P>
<P>But however, if <HI>Good Works</HI> must be <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Justification,</HI> as I am perswaded Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> thinks they are thorough Means, let what will become of his other Assertion, viz that Men are <HI>justified by Faith only;</HI> I shall mention several Things which follow from it. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Will it not follow from hence that Good Works are <HI>the Only Means of Justification?</HI> I am apt to think that if they do <HI>any Thing</HI> in Man's Justification, they do <HI>every Thing;</HI> as may appear from the following Instance. Sup∣pose two Men to have only <HI>that Faith without Works which is dead;</HI> they are at present undoubtedly in an unjustified State. Suppose further, that one of them doth <HI>Good Works,</HI> and doth them long enough <HI>to be justified;</HI> while the <HI>other's Faith is yet alone.</HI> The <HI>former</HI> will be justified, the <HI>latter</HI> not. And yet what is the Cause that the former is justified while the latter is not? why nothing, but <HI>Works of Righteousness which he did.</HI> So that the <HI>whole</HI> of this Man's Justification curtis upon his <HI>Good Works.</HI> If i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be said, that this Man is not justified <HI>by his Works,</HI> but because his Faith was <HI>lively</HI> and operative (as I expect it will be said) I answer, this is saying nothing; and I shall
<PB N="13" REF="004705_0009_100DBD4662AA7B30"/>take Notice of it But if it be said that this happy Man, besides his <HI>Works,</HI> had an increasing <HI>Faith,</HI> more than he had when he first set out; and more than the other ever had; I Answer, The good Man's Faith was of the same Kind with the wicked Man's, and only superiour in Degree (both being only Faith of Assent.) And if the bad Man's Faith did not justify him at all; so neither can a greater Degree of the same Faith be of a justifying Nature; And consequently he that <HI>was justifyed,</HI> was justified by <HI>Works,</HI> and not by <HI>Faith.</HI> Or, if any Man will say, that he was justified <HI>by Faith,</HI> it can be only in <HI>this poor Sense,</HI> viz. he was justified by Faith, only as Faith help'd him to do <HI>justifying Works.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If good Works are Means of Justification, then a cer∣tain Number of Good Works is necessary to justify every Person that comes into the World. I say not that the same Number of good Works will do for all. For, to keep to their Principle, they must suppose that a greater or lesser Number shall be required, according as Persons have been greater or lesser Sinners; and according as the good Works they do are <HI>more</HI> or <HI>less</HI> vertuous, not to say <HI>meritorious.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Consequently no Man can tell exactly when he o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> others are justified; contrary to the Scripture, which ex∣horts Men to be sure of their Justification, and to rejoyce in a Sense of it; because 'tis impossible to know just how many Works will do. There are some that hold that no Man is justified <HI>in this Life:</HI> and that <HI>we must needs go out of the World</HI> before it can be said of us, that God is at Peace with us. And I shall shew, that Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Works have led him into this Error by and by: If he stands by one of his Bishops whom he hath cited as giving his own Sentiments.</P>
<P N="4">4. If Good Works are Means of Justification, this is an undeniable Consequence, that a Man may attain to <HI>one half, two thirds, three quarters, ninety nine hundredths</HI> of Justification; may arrive so near to it that one Prayer, or good Wish more would certainly justify him; which Divinity St. <HI>Paul</HI> would never have own'd. The most <HI>unseeing</HI> of Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Friends may be sensible of no Consequence <HI>here:</HI> And others may call it Cavilling and <HI>Sophistry,</HI> that don't deserve an Ans∣wer; and thereby keep up their Credit with their Hearers.
<PB N="14" REF="004705_0010_100DBD491320FCE8"/>But let them attempt fairly to prove that this <HI>frightful Di∣vinity</HI> is <HI>good Divinity;</HI> Or if they are asham'd to own it to be <HI>good Divinity,</HI> then let them prove that it is not <HI>their Divinity,</HI> and get rid of it they can: And they will find that <HI>Hic Labor hoc opus erit.</HI></P>
<P>I say again; that if Good Works are the <HI>Means of Justi∣fication,</HI> there will be a necessity l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id upon these Men to ac∣knowledge what I have now objected; and particularly that a Man may be so near a justified Estate, that one little good Work more, would certainly bring him into it. This will hold good in all manner of Works which require a Conti∣nuance of Time for their performance. Thus in the finish∣ing an House, or writing a Book, there is a certain Time, wherein one Blow more with the Hand, or one Letter more with the Pen, would compleat the <HI>House</HI> or <HI>Book</HI> And so in Justification which is tho't by them a Work of long Conti∣nuance, and effected by good Works as the Means; there must of necessity be a critical Instant, in which a Man may be so near being justified, that the doing the least good Work that can be tho't of would justify him intirely. Well then; this being inseperable from Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s dear Doctrine of <HI>Good Works being the Means of Justification,</HI> I would ask, (if it be lawful to ask a civil Question) what would become of a poor Sinner, that should be taken out of the World in that unhappy <HI>Juncture,</HI> wherein his Justifica∣tion was so near being effected, that there wanted but one good Wish, one, Lord have Mercy upon me, more, to have compleated it? Shall the Man be miserable for ever for this Defect? Or, shall he be look'd upon as justified, tho' he had not quite worked out his own Justification? Or, lastly, shall he be doom'd to <HI>Purgatory</HI> for a while, to satisfy for what was wanting, and thereby to be <HI>made meet for the In∣heritance of the Saints in Light?</HI> As the Papists positively hold, being induc'd by Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s Principle of <HI>Good Works being the Means of Justification.</HI> Lastly, I would ask, what will become of those <HI>Good Works,</HI> which are the <HI>Overplus</HI> after a Man is justified? And whether it be not from this Doctrine that the Popish Priests teach that some Men may have more good Deeds than they need themselves, and a little to spate for those that want,</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004705_0010_100DBD491320FCE8"/>
Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> having to'd the "strange Way, in which he and some others, hold Justification; he applies himself to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> thus, <Q>This is the Doctrine which you cen∣sure, and are so angry at; but which notwithstanding is the true Doctrine of the Gospel; and agreably taught by the ancient Fathers; by the Church of <HI>England;</HI> by her Clergy at all Times; and (be not surprized) by your Re∣verence, and Brethren Methodists, tho' not without ap∣parent Shuffle &amp;c. pag. 9.</Q></P>
<P>To each of which Assertions I shall endeavour a proper Answer: And,</P>
<P N="1">1. I utterly deny <HI>his</HI> Justification to be the Doctrine of the Gospel: Nay I affirm it to be <HI>another Gospel,</HI> brought from <HI>Rome;</HI> which St. <HI>Paul</HI> knew nothing of St. <HI>Paul</HI> every where concludes that <HI>Men are justified by Faith without the Works of the Law,</HI> Rom 3.28. If he had thought that Works did any thing in Man's Justification, tho' never so little, he would certainly have acknowledged it, notwithstanding all his Zeal for Faith; and not have determined peremptorily that they did nothing at all. How careful is he to distinguish between <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> in Man's Justification, left any one <HI>should seek Justification, as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI> i.e. b. <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> mixed together, <HI>Gal</HI> 2.16. But do Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Brethren make this Distinction? No, verily; they chuse to jumble them together for a Reason well known to themselves, and to almost every Body else. Nay, St. <HI>Paul</HI> not only inculcates the Doctrine of Justification by Faith without any <HI>impure Mixture</HI> of Works; but shews it to be of the last Importance to be believed. He testifies to the <HI>Galatians</HI> over and over, and to all Christians to the End of the World, that whoever sought to be justi∣fied by the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> (as well moral as ceremonial Works) they <HI>had fallen from Grace, and Christ would profit them nothing,</HI> Gal. 5.4.</P>
<P>This was what St. <HI>Paul</HI> testified seventeen Hundred Years ago And would to God that all his Successors, would testify the same Thing, and not directly the contrary! Then should we have the Doctrine of <HI>Grace</HI> restored to us, <HI>as it was at the first,</HI> and pure <HI>Christianity, as it was in the begin∣ning.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="004705_0011_100DBD4B64289780"/>Then would perishing Souls no longer be starv'd with the dry Husks of Morality, but be fed with Food convenient for them, and grow fat and flourishing in the Courts of our God.</P>
<P>And blessed be the Name of God, that he hath in this Day of Darkness and Error raised up several Men full of Faith and of the Holy Ghost; Men whose great Business it is to preach this <HI>Truth as it is in Jesus;</HI> and who have some of them spread the Savour of this Knowledge into distant Parts, undaunted with all the Persecutions they meet with from <HI>wicked and unreasonable Men Sing O Heavens, and Rejoyce O Earth!</HI> May they <HI>still be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might;</HI> and may the <HI>Word of the Lord spoken by them, have free Course, run, and be glorified.</HI> May the <HI>Lord of the Harvest send forth other Labourers into the Vineyard of the same Spirit and Power.</HI> And may the <HI>Know∣ledge of Justification by Faith</HI> ONLY, <HI>cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>But to return; Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> having conceded that St. PAUL held Justification <HI>by Faith,</HI> would have him expounded by St. JAMES, who saith that <HI>Faith without Works is dead being alone</HI> And it is very true that St PAUL should be so understood. But tho' St. PAUL held undoubtedly that Works were the effect of a Justifying Faith, yet it never entered into his Heart, that Works had any Hand in <HI>justifying;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Brethren Dream it hath. I cannot but observe that as the Apostle PAUL and Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> differ, so there is no great Harmony between <HI>him</HI> and St. JAMES, even in this Passage, which he hath cited from him, as co respondent to his own Thoughts For certainly St. JAMES by saving that <HI>Faith without Works is Dead;</HI> saith that Faith <HI>with Works is not Dead</HI> Whereas our Divine thinks, that <HI>Faith with Works</HI> may be Dead as well as <HI>Faith without Works.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Friends may Cry out <HI>Slander</HI> and <HI>Abuse;</HI> but let them have a little Patience. For, in speaking to the <HI>Twelfth Article</HI> of the Church, pag. 18. He saith that the Article dont mean to exclude <HI>good Works going before Justification provided that they are the fruits of Faith;</HI> so that there may be good Works according to him, which are the <HI>fruits of Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Man that hath this Faith and Works,</HI> not <HI>justified</HI> and con∣sequently
<PB N="17" REF="004705_0011_100DBD4B64289780"/>Faith <HI>with Works, which is Dead.</HI> For if Faith with Works dont <HI>Justify,</HI> then it <HI>is Dead.</HI> Astonishing Divinity this! This can only be avoided by saying what I wonder any Man is not ashamed to say, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Faith with Works which goes before Justification is <HI>not Dead</HI> but <HI>Alive,</HI> as <HI>far as it goes:</HI> and that it there were more of it, or rather more Works <HI>tack'd</HI> to it, it would Justify compleatly.</P>
<P N="2">II. This is so far from being the Doctrine of the <HI>Ancient Fathers,</HI> that the <HI>Fathers</HI> he hath selected as most for his pur∣pose, dont say one Word in its Favour, but quite the contrary. For all that is here cited, is perfectly agreable to what is held by those who suppose <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Justification are coexistent; and that there can be no good Works preceeding Justification.</HI></P>
<P>But to show the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Ancient Fathers,</HI> I need only now confront him with his own Authentick <HI>Book</HI> of HOMILIES, compiled for every Minister to Read to his Congregation, in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI, by the excellent <HI>Reformers</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> who Seal'd their Doctrine with their Blood, in the Reign of his next Successor Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. In the 2d <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Sermon</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> They say as follows, <Q><HI>Faith</HI> ONLY <HI>Justifieth,</HI> is the Doctrine of <HI>old Doctors.</HI> And after this wite, <HI>To be justified</HI> ONLY <HI>by this true and lively</HI> FAITH in CHRIST, speak ALL the Old and <HI>Ancient Authors,</HI> both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> of whom I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the Minister was to Read in Publick.</NOTE> will especially re∣hearse Three; <HI>Hilary, Basil</HI> and <HI>Ambrose.</HI> St <HI>Hilary</HI> saith these Words plainly in the Ninth Canon upon <HI>Mathew; Faith</HI> ONLY <HI>justifieth.</HI> And St. <HI>Basil</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> Author writeth thus. <HI>This is a perfect and whole Rejoycing in</HI> GOD, <HI>when a Man advanceth</HI> NOT <HI>himself for his own Righteousness, but acknowledgeth himself to</HI> LACK <HI>true Justice and Righteousness, and to be justified by the</HI> ONLY FAITH <HI>in</HI> CHRIST: and <HI>Paul</HI> (saith he) <HI>doth glory in the Contempt of his own Righteousness, and that he looketh for the Righteousness of</HI> GOD <HI>by</HI> FAITH. These be the very Words of St. <HI>Basil.</HI> And St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> a <HI>Latin</HI> Author saith these Words, <HI>This is the Ordinance of</HI> GOD, <HI>that they which believe in</HI> CHRIST <HI>should be saved,</HI> WITHOUT WORKS, <HI>by</HI> FAITH ONLY, <HI>freely receiving Re∣mission

<P N="3">III. Is it not Astonishing that he should bring in the good old Orthodox <HI>Eleventh Article</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as favouring his wild Notion of Justification; and that the HOMILY which he press'd to stand by him, should fight most powerfully against him? The <HI>Homily</HI> (which, 'tis agreed on both Sides, gives the true Sense of the Article) tells us that St <HI>Chrysestom,</HI> saith, <HI>that Faith of it self is full of Good Works; and that as scon as a Man doth believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be gar∣nish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with them.</HI> Which is <HI>very true</HI> if we understand <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>that special Faith</HI> of which Mr <HI>Colvin</HI> and Followers speak, which is in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used into the Soul by the Spirit of the
<PB N="19" REF="004705_0012_100DBD4D9C6A98E0"/>ever li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing God, and which is <HI>simultaneous with Justification:</HI> Bar <HI>absolutely false,</HI> if we understand it of any other: For these Men themselves suppose <HI>the Faith of Assent</HI> doth not necessarily <HI>produce Good Works;</HI> and that in some that have is, it is accompanied with <HI>Good Works,</HI> in others <HI>not</HI> Where∣fore when the <HI>Homily</HI> cites St. <HI>Chrysosteme</HI> as saying that <HI>Faith it self is full of Good Works;</HI> and that as soon <HI>as a Man doth believe be shall be garnished with them;</HI> it explains the <HI>Article</HI> into a <HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mistick Faith</HI> (which will not suffer Good Works to go before it) or else it asserts what all Sides hold to be false.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> will say, that the <HI>Homily</HI> means, that the <HI>Faith which is true and lively is full of Good Works &amp;c.</HI> and that therefore there is no need of supposing that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speaks of an infused <HI>Calvinistick Faith,</HI> simultaneous with Justification, and inconsistent with Good Works going before it. And I grant him that if the <HI>Homily</HI> doth mean <HI>his</HI> true &amp; <HI>lively</HI> Faith, there is no more to be said. But I have one very strong Reason to the contrary, and that is this; that I can hardly believe they were shallow enough to have no better a Meaning We have already seen what <HI>his true</HI> and <HI>lively Faith</HI> is, viz. <HI>A Faith actually producing good Works.</HI> And therefore, if the Authors of the HOMILY <HI>intended Mr.</HI> Gar∣den's <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue and lively Faith;</HI> the Amount of what they said in the forecited Words would be only this, viz. that the <HI>Faith</HI> which actually produceth Good Works, produceth Good Works; and when he hath <HI>a Faith</HI> that <HI>garnisheth him with Good Works,</HI> then <HI>he is garnished with Good Works.</HI> In a Word, the Authors of the <HI>Homily</HI> understood the <HI>Eleventh Article</HI> to speak of <HI>such a Faith</HI> which is <HI>coexistent with Justification;</HI> and between <HI>which</HI> and <HI>Justification</HI> there can be <HI>no</HI> Good Works.</P>
<P>But for your full Conviction, I shall show from your Book of Homilies and Articles (1) What is that Faith which they hold does justify; and (2) That this Faith only is <HI>That</HI> which justifies. (1) In the 3d Part of the Sermon of Salva∣tion their Note in the <HI>Margin</HI> is in these Words—<HI>What is the true and justifying Faith,</HI> and answering to it in the <HI>Page</HI> is the Description following — <Q>For the <HI>right and true Christian Faith</HI> is not only to believe that holy Scrip∣ture and all the foresaid Articles of our Faith are true;
<PB N="20" REF="004705_0013_100DBD515E0F8E80"/>but also to have a sure Trust and Confidence in God's merciful Promises, to be saved from everlasting Damnation by CHRIST: whereof doth follow a loving Heart to obey his Commandments.</Q> (2) That THIS FAITH is <HI>That</HI> which ONLY <HI>justifies</HI> appears also further both from the 35th and 11th <HI>Articles</HI> of the Church of England, in Conjunction with the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Homilies</HI> For <HI>Article</HI> 35 is in these Words, <Q>The <HI>second Book</HI> of <HI>Homilies,</HI> the several Titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain <HI>a Godly and wholsome Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>necessary for these Times,</HI> as doth the <HI>former Book</HI> of Homilies, which were set forth in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. and therefore we judge them to be <HI>Read in Churches</HI> by the <HI>Ministers</HI> DILIGENTLY and <HI>distinctly,</HI> that they may be understanded of the People.</Q> And <HI>Article</HI> 11th is This—<Q>We are accounted <HI>Righteous</HI> before God, <HI>only</HI> for the Merit of our Lord and Savioar JESUS CHRIST, by <HI>Faith,</HI> and not for our own Works, or Deservings. Wherefore <HI>that we are justified by</HI> FAITH <HI>only,</HI> is <HI>a most wholsome Doctrine,</HI> and very full of Comfort, <HI>as more largely is expressed in the</HI> HOMILY <HI>of Justification.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now these <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> thus included in them, <HI>you</HI> and <HI>all the Clergy</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> have solemnly <HI>Declar'd your</HI> UNFEIGNED ASSENT <HI>unto, and have</HI> SUE∣SCRIBED <HI>to the same</HI> And now we'll see what the <HI>Homily</HI> further says in this Point of <HI>Justification,</HI> which the said 11th <HI>Article</HI> expresly refers to, and which you have Declar'd and Subscribed your unfeigned Assent to.</P>
<P>For besides what I recited before from the said <HI>Homily,</HI> affirming that WITHOUT WORKS <HI>by</HI> FAITH ONLY <HI>we are</HI> JUSTIFIED, and that THIS <HI>is the Doctrine of</HI> ALL <HI>the</HI> ANCIENT AUTHORS; since this authentick Book enlarges on this GreatPoint, I shall add the following Passages from it, to your utter Contusion: In <HI>Part</HI> I of the said <HI>Sermon</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> are the following Passages, viz. <Q>St. <HI>Paul</HI> declareth here <HI>nothing</HI> upon <HI>the Behalf of Man</HI> concerning his <HI>Justification,</HI> but ONLY a true and lively <HI>Faith,</HI> which nevertheless is the Gift of GOD, and not Man's only Work without GOD: and vet that FAITH doth not shut out <HI>Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread</HI> and the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD, to be join'd with FAITH in every Man that is justified; but <HI>it shutteth</HI> THEM <HI>out from
<PB N="21" REF="004705_0013_100DBD515E0F8E80"/>the Office of</HI> JUSTIFYING. So that altho' they be all pre∣sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether in him that is justifyed, yet <HI>they justify</HI> NOT <HI>all together:</HI> neither doth <HI>Faith</HI> shut out the Justice of our GOOD WORKS, necessarily to be done after wards of Duty towards GOD (for we are most bounden to serve GOD in doing good Deeds commanded by him, in <HI>his holy Scripture</HI> all the Days of our Life) But <HI>it exclud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th</HI> THEM <HI>so that we may not do them to this Intent, to be made Just by Doing of them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And after the above recited Passages of the Doctrine of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in the said 2d <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Sermon</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> wherein the Homily teaches Justification without Works by Faith only; the Homily condemns you and all your Clergy who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou say preach Good Works as a necessary Condition of Justification; I say, the said Homily fearfully condemns you in the following Words—in the Margin, "WHAT THEY BE <HI>that impugn the Doctrine that</HI> FAITH ONLY JUSTIFIETH." And against the said Margin in the Body of the Page, the Clauses following, viz. <Q><HI>This Faith</HI> the holy Scripture teach∣eth us is the strong Rock and Foundation of Christian Re∣ligion: THIS DOCTRINE <HI>all old and ancient Authors</HI> of Christ's Church do approve: <HI>This Doctrine</HI> advanceth and setteth forth the true Glory of CHRIST &amp; beateth down the vain Glory of Man: THIS whosoever denieth, <HI>is not to be accounted for a Christian Man,</HI> nor for a setter forth of CHRIST's Glory, but for <HI>an Adversary</HI> to CHRIST and <HI>his Gospel,</HI> and for a setter forth of Men's vain Glory.</Q></P>
<P><HI>This Doctrine</HI> then, viz. of <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> ONLY <HI>without Works</HI> so fully declar'd in the said Article &amp; Homily, whosoever Denies, tho' he be Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> or the <HI>Author of the Whole Duty of Man,</HI> or Bishop <HI>Williams</HI> or ArchBishop <HI>Tilletson,</HI> or any of the <HI>Present Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church of England;</HI> the said <HI>Homily</HI> says, <HI>He is not to be accounted for a Christian Man,</HI> but <HI>for an Adversary to</HI> CHRIST <HI>and his Gospel:</HI> and this both Mr <HI>Commissary,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>all the Clergy</HI> of said Church, have solemnly <HI>Declared and Subscribed their unfeigned Assent to.</HI> And yet the <HI>Commissary</HI> both denies this Doctrine, and even reproaches and derides it as an <HI>An∣tinomian</HI> Doctrine at the End of his <HI>Letter</HI> IV. to Mr <HI>White∣field,</HI> in the following Words. — <Q>Then what becomes of your <HI>remarkable</HI> ANTINOMIAN Challenge,— <HI>Who dares
<PB N="22" REF="004705_0014_100DBD5315AF4500"/>ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt that we are not justified in the Sight of God m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erly by an Act of Faith in Jesus Christ, without any Regard to Works, past, present, or to come.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yes what a <HI>horrid Scandal</HI> does Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> Charge on <HI>his own Clergy?</HI> For <HI>contrary</HI> to their own Book of <HI>Homilies,</HI> and to their own <HI>Articles</HI> asserting the Book of <HI>Homilies</HI> to contain <HI>a godly and wholsome Doctrine</HI> and <HI>necessary for these Times,</HI> and THEREFORE <HI>to be read in Churches by the Mini∣ster</HI> DILIGENTLY <HI>and distinctly, that they may be understanded of the People:</HI> And especially <HI>contrary</HI> to the 11th <HI>Article,</HI> which asserts that <HI>we are justified by</HI> FAITH ONLY <HI>is a</HI> MOST WHOLSOME <HI>Doctrine, as more largely expressed in the Homily of Justification;</HI> yea lastly <HI>contrary</HI> to their own solemn <HI>Declaration of their</HI> UNFEIGNED ASSENT <HI>and their Sub∣scription to the same</HI> — Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> affirms in <HI>Print</HI> that THEIR CLELGY <HI>teach</HI> GOOD WORKS <HI>as a</HI> NECESSARY CONDITION <HI>of</HI> JUSTIFICATION.</P>
<P N="4">IV. As to his saying that he explains Justification by Faith, in Harmony with <HI>the Clergy at all Times,</HI> I have al∣ready prov'd the contrary, by shewing that this Justifica∣tion of <HI>his</HI> is altogether <HI>Popish,</HI> and hath had publick Testi∣mony born against it from the Reformation. He hath indeed pick'd up several great Names between whom and himself, he would have us think there is a perfect Agreement in this Matter; concerning each of whom I would make a few Remarks. And</P>
<P N="1">1. We have a Passage from Bishop DOWNAM brought in thus—<Q>And as of the CHURCH, so agreably is this the Doctrine at all Times preached by her CLERGY—<HI>We are justified by Faith only and not by Works:</HI> and, <HI>yet</HI> (saith Bp DOWNAM, Treatise of Justific. Pag 15) <HI>That Faith which is alone severed from all other Inward Graces and Out∣ward Obedience, doth not justify either alone, or at all: because it is not a true and lively, but a counterfeit and dead Faith.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now in this the <HI>Commissary</HI> seems greatly to impose on the ignorant Part of the World; whether consciously to him∣self or not I don't determine. For Bp DOWNAM did in 1639, publish a <HI>Folio</HI> upon <HI>Justification,</HI> containing about 660
<PB N="23" REF="004705_0014_100DBD5315AF4500"/><HI>Pages.</HI> The whole Design of which large Work, is against the <HI>Papists,</HI> to show, that the RIGHTEOUSNESS of CHRIST, <HI>imputed</HI> to us, is the <HI>only meritorious</HI> Cause of our <HI>Justification,</HI> and that FAITH in CHRIST is the ONLY <HI>Instrument</HI> of our Receiving <HI>Justification</HI> from his <HI>Righteousness;</HI> or that FAITH in CHRIST is the ONLY Thing on our Part whereby we are Justified, and this not as a <HI>Work,</HI> but ONLY as an <HI>Instrument</HI> and the ONLY <HI>Instrument</HI> of our apprehending CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness;</HI> upon which <HI>That Righteousness</HI> becomes <HI>imputed</HI> to us for our <HI>Justification.</HI></P>
<P>This is the main Purport of that old and excellent Divine in that large Performance: and that the Reader may more surely see it, I shall here recite that <HI>whole Paragraph</HI> out of which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> selected the Scrap abovesaid. It is ex∣actly in the following Words, <Q>SIXTHLY, <HI>When we say that</HI> FAITH <HI>doth justify</HI> ALONE. Two <HI>Things are implied:</HI> FIRST, <HI>that we are justified by the</HI> Righteousness <HI>of</HI> CHRIST ALONE <HI>apprehended by</HI> FAITH, <HI>and not by any Righteousness inherent in us.</HI> SECONDLY, <HI>That this Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST <HI>by which</HI> ALONE <HI>we are justified, is apprehended by</HI> FAITH ONLY. <HI>Not that justifying Faith is or can be alone; but because there being</HI> MANY GRACES <HI>in the Faithful, which all have their se∣veral Commendations; yet</HI> NONE OF THEM <HI>serveth to appre∣hend</HI> CHRIST's <HI>Righteousness, but</HI> FAITH ONLY; <HI>and yet that Faith which is alone, severed from all other inward Gra∣ces and outward Obedience doth not justify either alone or at all; because it is not a true and a lively, but a counterfeit and dead Faith. For even as the</HI> EYE <HI>among all the Parts of the Body, which all have their several Uses, hath</HI> ONLY <HI>the</HI> FACULTY <HI>of</HI> SEEING; <HI>and yet that Eye which is separated from the rest of the Parts, doth see neither alone nor at all, be∣cause it is but the Carcase of an Eye: so among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all the Groces of the Soul, it is the</HI> OFFICE <HI>of</HI> FAITH ALONE, <HI>as the</HI> EYE <HI>of the</HI> SOUL, <HI>to</HI> LOOK <HI>upon</HI> HIM <HI>that was figur'd by the</HI> BRAZEN SERPENT: <HI>yet if it should be severed from the Rest, it evere Dead For as St</HI> James <HI>saith</HI> [Jam. 2. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.] <HI>That Faith which is alone and by it self is dead And as the</HI> EYE <HI>in respect of</HI> PEING <HI>is not alone yet in respect of</HI> SEEING <HI>it is</HI> ALONE; <HI>so</HI> FAITH <HI>which is not alone, doth justify</HI> ALONE.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004705_0015_100DBD55C42D84E0"/>
This is Bp DOWNAM'S whole Paragragh in pag. 15. and the same Things he repeats in other Places, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and with more Enlargement in Chap. IV III, which he who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y spends in pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Justification by <HI>Faith</HI> ALONE without any Regard to <HI>Works</HI> or <HI>other Graces.</HI> For thus he begin the Chapter, Sect. I. <Q>Now I come to the 3d QUESTION, which is the <HI>Principal</HI> concerning FAITH, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be justified by FAITH ALONE, as WE with ALL ANTIQUITY do hold: or not by Faith alone, but also by OTHER HABITS of GRACE, as Charity and the rest, and by the WORKS of GRACE which the PAPISTS hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concur in us to the Act of Justification, as the Causes thereof?</Q> In Sect III. he says— <Q>But the Word ALONE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>please the PAPISTS, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill needs part S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes with CHRIST in their Justification</Q> In Sect VI He proceeds to prove our <HI>Justification</HI> by FAITH ALONE and brings this Argu∣ment, <Q>For if we be justifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by he IMPUTED RIGHTE∣OUSNESS of CHRIST ALONE, and if in us there be NO∣THING which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th us Partakers of CHRIST'S RIGHTEOUSNESS, but FAITH ONLY; then there is nothing in us by which we are justified, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ONLY FAITH</Q>. In Sect. VII. He pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nces several <HI>Scriptures</HI> to prove the same. In Sect. VIII He brings this Argument — <Q>All those Places which exclude Works from Justification, do by necessary Consequence teach Justification by FAITH ALONE</Q>. In Sect. IX He argues thus — <Q>THAT by which ALONE the Promise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Justification, by which ALONE Justification, by which ALONE CHRIST Himself who is our Righteousness is received THAT a one justifieth: By FAITH ALONE the Promise, by it ALONE Justification, by it ALONE CHRIST himself is received.</Q> In Sect X. He argues thus — <Q>THAT which is the ONLY CONDITION of the COVENANT OF GRACE by THAT ALONE we are justified, because to THAT ALONE Justification is pro∣mised: FAITH is the ONLY CONDITION of the COVE∣NANT OF GRACE. [<HI>Job</HI> 3.16 <HI>Act</HI> 10 43. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3 9.] which is therefore called THE LAW OF FAITH [<HI>Rom.</HI> 3 27] Therefore by FAITH ALONE we are justified. If against the ASSUMPTION it be OBJECTED, that CHARITY and OBEDIENCE and OTHER VIRTUES are also required: I ANSWER. That THE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are NOT the CONDITIONS of the COVENANT, but the Things by Covenant <HI>Promised</HI> to them

H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> argues thus. —<Q>The Holy Scriptures where∣soever they speak of THAT by which we are justified, mention <HI>Nothing</HI> in us but FAITH; not WORKS, not OTHER GRACES. unless it be to EXCLUDE THEM from the Act of Justification: which is a plain Evidence that FAITH doth justify ALONE</Q> In Chap. IX. the Title is— <Q><HI>Testimonies of the ancient</HI> Fathers, <HI>and of</HI> Others <HI>in all Ages for Justification by</HI> FAITH ALONE.</Q> Then he begins the Chapter thus—<Q>Now that this Doctrine is no No∣velty, but that which in ALL AGES hath been the received Doctrine of the CHRISTIAN CHURCHES. I will prove by the Testimony of the CHRISTIAN WRITERS in ALL AGES, but chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the ancient FATHERS.</Q> And then he fills he Chapter with Quotations from between thirty and forty of them to the same Purpose. All these comma'd Pas∣sages are the <HI>very Words</HI> of the excellent Bp DOWNAM.</P>
<P>But all this Doctrine is directly contrary to Mr. <HI>Commissary's</HI> Scheme, and to the present Scheme of <HI>most</HI> of his Brethren <HI>Clergymen</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> lays it down in Pag 8, 9. in the following Words— <Q><HI>Well then the Doctrine the</HI> CLERGY <HI>preach is this,</HI> viz. <HI>That we are justified by such a Faith only as is trus and lively, that is actually producing</HI> GOOD FRUITS <HI>or</HI> WORKS, <HI>and consequently implying</HI> THEM <HI>as a</HI> NECESSARY CONDITION <HI>(but no meritorious Cause) of our</HI> JUSTIFICATION. <HI>This is indeed the true Doctrine of the Gospel; and agreably taught by the ancient</HI> FATHERS — <HI>by the</HI> CHURCH <HI>of</HI> ENGLAND— <HI>by her</HI> CLERGY <HI>at</HI> ALL TIMES &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004705_0016_100DBD58042B9C98"/>
And now which shall we believe— Mr. <HI>Commissary,</HI> or the learned Bp DOWNAM, as to Matter of Fact? For as the <HI>Bishop</HI> asserts and proves that <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>no Condition</HI> at all of our Justification, but that <HI>Faith in</HI> CHRIST <HI>is the</HI> ONLY <HI>Condition,</HI> and this <HI>only</HI> as an <HI>Instrument</HI> apprehending the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST, and that this is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England</HI> and of the ancient <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Christian Writers</HI> in <HI>all Ages,</HI> whose Testimonies he expresly produces. Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> plumply contradicts him, and says with the <HI>Papists</HI> whom the <HI>Bishop</HI> opposes, that <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>implied</HI> as a NECESSARY CONDITION of our <HI>Justi∣cation;</HI> and (without any Proof) that <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>true Doctrine of the Gospel</HI> and agreably taught by the ancient <HI>Fathers,</HI> by the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and by <HI>her Clergy,</HI> at <HI>all Times.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Commissary</HI> happened here to own <HI>one</HI> most sor∣rowful and evident Truth, viz that the <HI>Present Clergy</HI> preach GOOD WORKS implied as a NECESSARY CONDITION of our <HI>Justification.</HI> But every Man of Learring knows that this is a Doctrine which the excellent Bp DOWNAM calls a <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine and which he strenuously opposes; and is indeed a <HI>modern Doctrine</HI> in the <HI>Protestant Church of England,</HI> and was never own'd, but oppos'd in the Church till the Return of those two <HI>Popish Princes</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> viz <HI>Charles</HI> the II and his Brother <HI>James,</HI> in 1660 And now Mr <HI>Com∣missary</HI> boldly asserts that <HI>This</HI> which Bp <HI>Downam</HI> opposes as a <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine, <HI>is the true Doctrine of the Gospel,</HI> and that <HI>this is the Doctrine which the Church of England Clergy Preach &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In short, it appears a most astonishing and horrible Thing, that when the <HI>Commissary</HI> had both Bp DOWNAM and the BOOK <HI>of</HI> HOMILIZS in his Hand, where the ancient <HI>Fathers</HI> are produced as utterly <HI>excluding</HI> WORKS from being any <HI>Condition</HI> of <HI>Justification</HI> and strongly asser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>Justification</HI> by FAITH ONLY; that yet in direct Opposition to those known and authentick <HI>Treatises,</HI> he should roundly affirm that <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>implied</HI> as a NECESSARY CONDITION of <HI>Justification,</HI> and that the ancient <HI>Fathers</HI> and the <HI>Church of England</HI> and <HI>her Clergy</HI> at all Times have <HI>taught the same<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> It is also strange, that in Opposition to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> who charges the <HI>modern</HI> Divines for departing from the Doctrine of the <HI>old</HI> Divines of the Church in the Point of <HI>Justifica∣tion;</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="004705_0016_100DBD58042B9C98"/>yet Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> should bring Bp DOWNAM in, as if <HI>He</HI> were a <HI>modern</HI> Divine; when he printed his <HI>Folio</HI> in 1639 and was <HI>one</HI> of those <HI>old Orthodox</HI> Divines, from whom Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> justly complains, that the <HI>present Clergy</HI> have sadly departed in the Point of <HI>Justification!</HI> And that Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> should yet quote <HI>this</HI> worthy BISHOP, and there∣by make the ignorant Part of the World who have not his Book, believe, as if Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> with his <HI>present Clergy</HI> and <HI>that</HI> old Orthodox BISHOP were of the same Mind!</P>
<P>In the</P>
<P N="2">2. Place, we have the Suffrage of Bishop <HI>Beveridge;</HI> whose Words, (besides many other Things spoken by him just as Mr. <HI>Garden's</HI> Opposers speak upon the same Point) are these; <HI>That it is not from our</HI> WORKS <HI>that accompany our</HI> FAITH, <HI>but from our</HI> FAITH <HI>which is accompanied by our</HI> WORKS, <HI>that we are justified</HI> By which Words it appears that his next Bishop will do him more Harm than Good, and therefore he had better have said nothing about him. For, doth Mr <HI>Gar∣den</HI> hold to what I have just quoted from him concerning the <HI>Bishop?</HI> No, by no Means. Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> holds that <HI>Faith implies Works;</HI> and as hath been shewn, with Bishop <HI>Williams</HI> asserts. that WORKS <HI>are an essential Part of justifying</HI> FAITH. And if they are an essential Part of <HI>justifying Faith,</HI> 'tis from them that we <HI>are justifyed</HI> So that Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> whom he <HI>summoned to Witness for him,</HI> bears full Testimony against him</P>
<P>To this I add what Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> says in his <HI>Private Thoughts</HI> under <HI>Article</HI> VIII. in the following Words — <Q>How is it <HI>possible</HI> that I should be justified by <HI>Good Works,</HI> when I can do <HI>no</HI> Good Works <HI>at all</HI> before I be <HI>first justified?</HI> my <HI>Works</HI> cannot be accepted as <HI>Good</HI> till my <HI>Person</HI> be <HI>so:</HI> not can my <HI>Person</HI> be accepted by GOD, till <HI>first engrafted</HI> into CHRIST; before which engrafting into the true Vine, 'tis <HI>impossible</HI> I should bring forth Good Fruit: For <HI>the Plowing of the Wicked is Sin</HI> says <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. xxi. 4. Yea <HI>the Sacrifices of the Wicked are an Abomi∣nation to the Lord,</HI> Chap. xv. 8. And if both the civil and spiritual Actions of the Wicked be Sin; which of all their Actions shall have the Honour to justify them in the Sight of GOD?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004705_0017_100DBD5A287F3BB8"/>
And now Mr. <HI>Garden!</HI> would you have the World be∣lieve that you are of the same Sentiment with the pious Bp <HI>Beveridge</HI> in the Point of <HI>Justification?</HI> when <HI>you</HI> assert <HI>Good Works</HI> are a NECESSARY CONDITION of <HI>Justification;</HI> and the said Bishop asserts that, <HI>before</HI> we are <HI>justified.</HI> we can do NO <HI>Good Works</HI> AT ALL, and that this is <HI>impossible.</HI></P>
<P>In the</P>
<P>3d Place, Comes the Bishop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> whom I readily grant to be on our A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor's Side; for it appears from what he hath quoted from him, especially the last Sentence, that together with Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> by <HI>justifying Faith,</HI> he means <HI>Faith, Love Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Obedience;</HI> that is every Thing. But yet there is this Difference between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; that where∣as Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> faith. <HI>we are justified by this Faith only;</HI> the <HI>Bishop</HI> rememb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing that <HI>his Faith</HI> stood for <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works too,</HI> very Logically left out the Word <HI>only.</HI></P>
<P>But both Bishop <HI>Barnet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s next cited Author Bishop <HI>Williams,</HI> are some of those <HI>modern Writers</HI> whom all Men of Learning know have, in the Point of <HI>Justification,</HI> openly departed from the Doctrine of the <HI>first Reformers</HI> in the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And to convince every one of this, he needs only read the Passages Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> cites from Bishop <HI>Barnet</HI> and Bishop <HI>Williams</HI> and then compare them with the Passages I have recited from the <HI>Articks,</HI> the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Ho∣milies,</HI> and Bp <HI>Downam.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Rear of this Episcopal Army is brought up by Bishop <HI>Williams:</HI> who also is a Man after Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s own H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for his Justifying <HI>Faith</HI> comprehends in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>all that Duty and those Graces,</HI> which he saith, <HI>are made the Condition of the Gos∣pel Covenant; and which gives a Title to all the benefits of it.</HI> i. e. Justifying Faith, signifies Faith and all manner of Good Works in Conjunction. And in the last Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, he tells us that not only <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> but <HI>Perseverance also</HI> belongs to this justifying Faith, and is an essential Part of it. See Pag 11. lin. ult From which Words of the <HI>Bishop.</HI> and Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s citing them with Approbation, may we not discover a very odd Opinion held by them both. viz. That no Man is, justified in this Life; and that we must needs go out of the World before it can be said that we are
<PB N="29" REF="004705_0017_100DBD5A287F3BB8"/>reconciled to our Maker? contrary to the Tenor of the Bible. For if <HI>Perseverance</HI> is an essential Part of <HI>justifying Faith,</HI> there can be no such Thing as Justification, while an essential Part of that which justifies is wanting; and this essential Part must be wanting all the Days of a Man's Life: for <HI>Perseverance</HI> intends the whole of our Course.</P>
<P>But however horrid this Opinion appears, considered in it's Repugnancy to Scripture, and Reason, it must be confess'd it looks much better if we take a View of it as grafted upon Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Bosom <HI>Tenet,</HI> that Good Works are Means of Justifi∣cation. Nay, if I could once swallow down the latter, I should make no difficulty with the former If I really tho't Good Words to be Means of Justification. I should think it more likely that a Man should be justified by the Good Works he performed thro' his whole Life; than by the <HI>Obedience</HI> of (perhaps) a few Days Nay it looks much more modest, and ascribes a less degree of Merit to Good Works, to maintain that all the Good Works a Man ever did are required to justify him, than to maintain, that half or one quarter of them (perhaps) will do very well.</P>
<P>And besides, by this Means I should get rid of what I should be glad to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of by any Means, <HI>viz.</HI> the Doctrine of a Man's being in a <HI>State of Grace</HI> to Day, <HI>and out of it</HI> To∣morrow; his being a <HI>Child of</HI> GOD, and <HI>a Child of the Devil</HI> by <HI>turns,</HI> no one knows how often. And as to the Doctrine of a Man's attaining to <HI>one half two thirds, nine tenthts,</HI> &amp;c of Jus∣tification; I should be no more perplex'd with it upon the <HI>new Hypothesis,</HI> than upon the <HI>old</HI> Thus I have fairly shewn the Doctrine of <HI>no forgiveness in this Life,</HI> may be charg'd upon the <HI>Bishop,</HI> and Mr <HI>Garden,</HI> since the Passage which <HI>the former wrote,</HI> and which the latter vouches as his own Sentiments, un∣deniably contains it. However if Mr. <HI>Garden will do Penance,</HI> and own that the good <HI>Bishop</HI> and he wrote <HI>both besides them∣selves;</HI> the one in blundering so eg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egriously, the other in publishing <HI>his Blunder</HI> with Approbation and Veneration; the Publick will doubtless exercite suitable Charity towards them.</P>
<P N="5">V. As to his saying that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and Brethren <HI>Methodists,</HI> hold Justification by Faith as he himself doth:
<PB N="30" REF="004705_0018_100DBD5C672ED688"/>I Answer, that Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> doth not really think this Charge against them to be just; because in pag. 19 he tells how dif∣ferently from him they explain Justification by Faith, and blames them for it. All therefore that he can found his Charge upon, must be some Passages of theirs wherein they have contradicted themselves, and before they were aware of it, come over to him. And I allow Mr <HI>Garden</HI> to treat them as I have treated him, and as I design to treat him again; that is to set them a Fighting with their own selves, if he can do it fairly. But the Passages he hath adduced are not really in any measure inconsistent with their avowed Principles. They have asserted, <Q>That true Faith continually excites Men to shew forth that Faith by abounding in every good Word and Work. And that the Faith which justifies, is not a Faith exclusive of Good Works, but <HI>inclusive,</HI> or <HI>(productive)</HI> of them. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Sermon, <HI>What think ye of Christ?</HI> And Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esley</HI> Sermon on, <HI>Salvation by Faith,</HI> pag. 14.</Q></P>
<P>And doth it follow that because these Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lemen hold that Faith always produceth Good Works, that therefore he and they must have he same idea of Faith and Works in Man's Justification? No in no wise. Is it not strange, that Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Friends can see no <HI>Medium</HI> between <HI>Antinomianism</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmianism;</HI> and that they should assert that all those who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves of the former <HI>Error,</HI> join with them in espou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the latter?</P>
<P>This Gentleman having shewn or rather attempted to shew how agreable his Idea of Justification by Faith, is to the Gospel, to the ancient Fathers, to the Church of England, to her Clergy at all Times, and lastly to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and Friends; he accuses Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> of arrogant and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icked Stander in accusing him and Brethren of holding Justification by Works, since he could not do it upon an, Grounds but what would equally support the Charge against himself, and Friends the <HI>Methodists.</HI> In which Accusation, after what hath been said, I believe there is no Man will think his Fault was want of Courage! He seems indeed in the very next Breath to be sensible of his misrepresenting these two excellent Gen∣tlemen; and he addresses himself to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> thus</P>
<P><Q>But you will say this is not a fair Representation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> State of the Matter in Question. For the Ground on which you
<PB N="31" REF="004705_0018_100DBD5C672ED688"/>accuse the Clergy of preaching only the Law, or Justifica∣tion by Works, is not their preaching that Good Works such as are pleasing to God, are the necessary Fruits and Effects of a justifying Faith; no, but their preaching that such Good Works are the necessary Conditions of Justifica∣tion, and consequently not only follow after, but go before it also, contrary to sound Doctrine, and the 12th Article of the Church,</Q> Pag. 13. To which he Answers, That this is a miserable Distinction, serving only to intangle and amuse, and not to instruct the Minds of the weak and un∣wary Populace. And his strong Reasons are these that follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> a Wrangler in Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> own Way, (so he calls an eminently pious and peaceable Man) owns that Goods Works may be a Condition of Justification, in another Sense than that of meritorious Causes. <HI>Ergo quid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Why, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> wrongs him and Fraternity in say∣ing that they hold Works to be meritorious Causes of Justifi∣cation. Doth it follow that because they <HI>might</HI> have another <HI>Sense,</HI> that therefore they had? <HI>A Posse ad esse an unquam va∣luit consequentia?</HI></P>
<P>But it will be said, that since it is possible, according to Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> that Men may hold Good Works to be Con∣ditions of Justification in another Sense than that of their being <HI>meritorious Causes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> ought in Charity to think they did.</P>
<P>I Answer, Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Charity must have been extra∣vagantly large, to have suppos'd that they don't look upon Good Works as <HI>meritorious,</HI> when by Preaching, Writing, and Conversation, they declare they <HI>do.</HI> I don't say that they look upon Good Works to be meritorious of <HI>Condignity,</HI> but of <HI>Congruity only,</HI> with the more <HI>moderate Papists.</HI> Indeed the Word <HI>Merit,</HI> is a <HI>Name</HI> of such evil Report, that they are perfectly ashamed of it; but then they hold <HI>fast</HI> the <HI>Thing,</HI> which is worse than the <HI>Name;</HI> and will never be perswa∣ded to let it go. Nay, they have some of them the Cou∣rage, to tax the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> as if this Doctrine was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culiar to them; and yet they cannot bring one Argument to support the Charge against the more moderate Papists, which will not equally conclude against themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="004705_0019_100DBD5F2E7FD6D0"/>
This I have prov'd already, and need not do it again.</P>
<P>To return therefore; Must Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> be deem'd a malicious Slanderer of these Men in what he hath said of them? No verily. Unless, they may be thought Slande∣rers of their own Selves. For when they <HI>speak</HI> or <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite,</HI> they make out full as much against themselves, as he ever charg'd them with. Their very Charges of Falshood against him, unluckily for them, prove <HI>that he is a Man of Truth,</HI> and <HI>that in his Spirit there is no Guile.</HI> And the grand Reason why they <HI>count him</HI> their <HI>Enemy</HI> is <HI>because he tells them the Truth;</HI> having found our, and born Testimony against that base smugling Trade of Importing prohibited Goods from <HI>Rome,</HI> in which they are so deeply engaged.</P>
<P>His 2d Argument (for 'tis very probable, <HI>he</HI> tho't it an Argument) is taken from what he saith no one will deny, viz. That <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Good Works</HI> are both <HI>Conditions</HI> of Salva∣tion; and if of Salvation, then he inters they must be Con∣ditions of Justification too; and consequently that Good Works go before Justification. <HI>Q. E D.</HI></P>
<P>But then, I would tell him, that when he builds an Argu∣ment upon the <HI>Consent of all,</HI> he must be sore that all <HI>do Consent;</HI> otherwise he will have no Foundation, and the Su∣perstructure, will be just good for nothing. And accordingly I now take away this Foundation, and set <HI>all a tumbling,</HI> by denying that Good Works, are so necessary to <HI>Salvation,</HI> that there can in <HI>no Case</HI> be <HI>Salvation</HI> without them. In which Denial I shall be born out by all that hate the Ora∣cles of <HI>Arminius;</HI> by the Church of England; and parti∣cularly by Mr <HI>Garden</HI> himself: for this Gentleman seems (by his Conduct) so set upon being consuted, that least his Ad∣versary should not do it effectually without him, he scarcely ever falls to confute himself.</P>
<P>The Followers of Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> it is well known hold that as soon as a Man believes he is justified, and that if God should please to take him out of the World in that Instant, <HI>he would not perish, but have everlasting Live:</HI> tho' not <HI>one</HI> Good Work had been done by him. The Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines of this Way do indeed more than any Men, press the Necessity of an universal Obedience to the Laws of God, testi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying unwea∣riedly, that <HI>Faith without Works is dead;</HI> that is, that what∣ever
<PB N="33" REF="004705_0019_100DBD5F2E7FD6D0"/>Pretences Men may have to Faith, yet if they dare to rebel against the most high God, their Faith will not stop them from the Damnation of Hell whither they are hastning. But yet in as much as they believe Men are justified <HI>by Faith only;</HI> they suppose that where there is the reality of <HI>Faith</HI> there is the reality of <HI>Justification,</HI> and would be of <HI>Salvation,</HI> were the Subject of it immediately to depart this Life. The Church of England also, being Calvinistical, as I have shewn; might from <HI>hence</HI> be argued to be of this Opinion: but they expresly shew themselves to be <HI>like minded,</HI> in their ordering <HI>the Minister,</HI> in his <HI>Visitation of the Sick,</HI> after saying to, and hearing a few Words from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he dying Person to forgive his Sins <HI>upon the Spot.</HI> Many Things might be excepted against <HI>this Form;</HI> but yet it sully implies their Be∣lief of this Truth, viz that a Man may be <HI>forgiven</HI> and in a State of <HI>Salvation</HI> without doing any <HI>Works of Righteousness at all.</HI> Nay, Mr <HI>Garden</HI> (for I am now come to <HI>him</HI>) hath undoubt∣edly affirmed in the most solemn manner, to departing <HI>Pro∣fligates</HI> that by Vertue of the Power deriv'd to him from his Saviour, <HI>be forgave their Sins.</HI> Which (at the least) im∣plie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that if they were sincere in what they said to Mr. <HI>Gar∣den,</HI> their Sins <HI>were forgiven by God.</HI> And if so, then there is no doubt, but that if they had been snatched away the very Moment of their <HI>Absolution,</HI> Heaven &amp; Happiness would have been their Portion. The Truth is, Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is either in <HI>Jest,</HI> or <HI>in Earnest,</HI> when <HI>he forgives the Sins of poor dying People.</HI> If he is in <HI>Jest,</HI> (which I can't think of him) there is no more to be said. But if he is in <HI>Earnest,</HI> why then he confutes himself: holding in effect, with the Church of Eng∣land and all <HI>Calvinists,</HI> what he said every Body <HI>deny'd,</HI> and upon the denial of which he builds all his <HI>Reasoning:</HI> which indeed is very good <HI>Reasoning,</HI> and would never fall to the Ground, were there any Thing under it, to keep it up.</P>
<P>Perhaps, some Friend of Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> will be ready to say, that when he forgives the Sins of dying wicked Men, upon their saying what is prescrib'd for them to say in the <HI>Common Prayer Book, he</HI> hath Regard to some Good Works he supposes they have sormerly done; or rather to all the Good Works which the poor sick wicked Men ever did in the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse of their Lives. So that tho' they are really <HI>forgiven</HI> upon Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s absolving them, yet they are not forgiven
<PB N="34" REF="004705_0020_100DBD6282D24E28"/><HI>without Good Works,</HI> that is Good Works <HI>formerly</HI> done by them. Without stopping to put several Questions which natural∣ly arise here; I will evade this Solution, by supposing the dying Penitent to be one, who had formerly been <HI>justified,</HI> but had at the Time the Minister comes to absolve <HI>him,</HI> fallen from <HI>Grace;</HI> nor done one Good Work towards reinstating himself into the divine Favour: I would now <HI>ask,</HI> whither, upon his saying in sincerity what is <HI>prescribed,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s <HI>forgiving him,</HI> he would <HI>really be forgiven by Gad.</HI> and taken to Happiness, if he dy'd that Instant? If it be said <HI>Yes</HI> (and I think no one will say <HI>No</HI>) then it is most plain, that the dying Penitent is forgiven (and would be sav'd if he then dy'd) with∣out any Regard to Good Works.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be said, that tho' in such a Case, there is no Regard to Good Works <HI>past,</HI> yet there is to Good Works which the Person <HI>would have done,</HI> had he had a longer space: That <HI>such</HI> a Sinner, so <HI>dying</HI> is forgiven and received up to Glory, because God saw the Validity of his Repentance, and that if there had been Opportunity, he would have brought forth Fruits meet for Repentance This is that <HI>vertual Obe∣dience which Dr.</HI> TILLDTSON, speaks of, in his Sermon, from these Words, <HI>If ye live after the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, ye shall die &amp;c.</HI> And which he thinks will save a Man. where there is no room for that which is <HI>actual. Such miserable Inventions do Men seek out to themselves,</HI> who will not believe that we are justified by <HI>Faith only, according to the Scriptures!</HI> I say, <HI>miserable Inventions:</HI> For if God hath Regard to the <HI>Good</HI> which he foreseer <HI>wicked Men</HI> would have done had they liv'd longer; then by a Pa∣rity of Reason be will have Regard to the <HI>Evil</HI> which he fore∣sees <HI>Good Men</HI> would have done, <HI>had they lived longer:</HI> And then the Rule of his Proceedings at the Great Day, will not be according to the Good and Evil Men have done in the Body, but according to the Good and Evil they would have done, had they lived longer: which is horrible <HI>Divinity,</HI> and therefore shews the absutdity of the Supposition from whence it flows.</P>
<P>What hath been said, might be applied to what he cites from Dr <HI>Jackson</HI> However, lest it should he tho't a neglect to say nothing to him in particular, I shall consider the Case which he supposes, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>of a Man's <HI>Departing in the very
<PB N="35" REF="004705_0020_100DBD6282D24E28"/>Instant in which be is Justified.</HI> He saith, no Man will doubt either of his <HI>Absolution</HI> or <HI>Salvation.</HI> He then asks, is he sav'd <HI>with Works,</HI> or <HI>without?</HI> If without, then our Savioue's Rule fails, Math. 5.20 <HI>Except your Righteousness exceed the Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> As if it was not a great deal more na∣tural, to suppose, that Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the <HI>Truth</HI> are joyn'd together in the <HI>Soul of a Believer,</HI> as they are in the Scripture; and that a Man may be <HI>Righteous,</HI> and so his Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, though there be no Opportunity to Work <HI>Righteousness;</HI> even as a <HI>Tree</HI> may be <HI>good,</HI> and yet cat down before it bring <HI>forth good Fruit.</HI> The Man who Repents and Believes to the Salvation of his Soul, is certainly at the very instant, and before he hath done one Good Work, a more <HI>Righteous Person</HI> than any of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> were. Nay was all the Righteousness of all the Scribes and Phari∣sees from the beginning to this very Day (and perhaps there never were so many Pharisees in the World at a time, as there are at this Day) I say, was all this Righteousness transferr'd to one <HI>Man,</HI> he would not be so <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Righteous,</HI> as the Believer is the very moment of his receiving <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> by Faith. But if we should grant Dr. <HI>Jackson</HI> what there is no need of granting him, <HI>viz.</HI> that by <HI>Righteousness</HI> our Saviour means outward <HI>Acts of Righteousness,</HI> as if it had been said, <HI>Except your good Deeds, and Acts of Righteousness</HI> are more and better than those of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> &amp;c; there is no Difficulty in explaining the Words: The meaning will be this, that whatever Confidence Professors may put in their <HI>Faith and Attainments,</HI> yet if in their Lives and Conversation, they don't exceed the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> they may conclude that <HI>their Faith</HI> is not the right sort, and that they <HI>shall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But then how those of Doctor <HI>Jackson</HI>'s Mind, who explain the Words according <HI>to the severity of them,</HI> as denying Heaven absolutely to all whose outward <HI>Good Works</HI> are not more and better than those of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisers;</HI> I say, how they will get over their own Explanation, I am not able to understand. For, not to mention the Case of <HI>Infants,</HI> which seems to be desperate: How will they make out their giving Thanks to God that he hath in great Mercy taken to him∣self, <HI>the Souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all</HI> that die <HI>Church-Men,</HI> provided they have
<PB N="36" REF="004705_0021_100DBD64A7725F98"/>been <HI>Baptised, were not excommunicated and did not lay violent Hands upon themselves;</HI> even tho' they be the vilest of Men, <HI>Lyars, Fornicators, Profane Swearers, Drunkards,</HI> that <HI>die Drunk, and the like</HI> Do these all exceed the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the <HI>Scribes and Pharisees?</HI></P>
<P>Let any Man consider the many good Things these vile Men were remarkable for; or at least their treedom from scandalous Sins, and he will judge that they were not <HI>compa∣rable</HI> for <HI>Vileness,</HI> to <HI>thousands</HI> of the <HI>Sons of the Church,</HI> who as soon as Dead, are as it were Canonnised for <HI>Saints,</HI> and have solemn <HI>Thanksgivings put up to God for their Reception into Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>For my Part, tho' I doubt not but that there have been and still are <HI>many good Christians</HI> of the <HI>Prelatical Church;</HI> yet at the same time I believe it to be matter of common and sorrowful <HI>Observation,</HI> that the very highest part of High Church are generally speaking, much worse than <HI>Scribes and Pharisees:</HI> and vet the Men who officiate at their Funerals, and testify to their <HI>good Estate;</HI> insist upon it, that unless a Man's Righte∣ousness, his <HI>outward Acts of Righteousness</HI> and Obedience exceed those of the <HI>Scribes and Pharisees,</HI> he can in no Case <HI>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And as they contradict <HI>their own Exposition</HI> of <HI>Math</HI> 5 20, by officiating at <HI>Funerals,</HI> so do they by gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>Absolution</HI> to dying Sinners; as is evident from what hath been said upon that Head.</P>
<P>There is not one of them I believe that dares to deny, but that in Case a Person whom he knew to have been as bad as a <HI>Scribe</HI> or <HI>Pharisee,</HI> should be sick nigh unto Death, and desire <HI>Absolution,</HI> saying over what is appointed him to say; he would <HI>absolve</HI> him: And yet how he could do it, consist∣ently with their <HI>Exposition,</HI> is what <HI>he</HI> nor I shall ever be able to comprehend.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> hath also a great deal about Dr <HI>Edwards,</HI> la∣bouring to prove him guilty of a <HI>Self Contradiction.</HI> (that is to bring him into the same Comdemnation with himself) and withal representing him as one of the worst of Men. Whether the <HI>Doctor</HI> is really inconsistent with himself in any thing, he
<PB N="37" REF="004705_0021_100DBD64A7725F98"/>hath cited from him, is a Matter of great uncertainty with me; not having the <HI>Original,</HI> and not clearly understanding the Passages, and Remarks upon them, as they stand in Mr. <HI>Garden's Letters.</HI> However, if either Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or any other Gentleman, hath in fair <HI>Construction,</HI> done <HI>once,</HI> what Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> hath a great many times; con∣tradicted his own self; I shall <HI>so far readily</HI> give up his Cause, It being my Motto;</P>
<Q>Nullius Addictus Jurare in Verba Magistri.</Q>
<P>And as for the Cry which Mr <HI>Garden</HI> and Company make against this <HI>excellent Divine</HI> of their own Communion: 'tis well known that they hate him for the same Reason which made <HI>Cain</HI> hate <HI>Abel,</HI> viz. because he was more Righteous than themselves, <HI>Adhearing Steadfastly</HI> to the <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and Reproving them for turning their Backs upon them.</P>
<P>Our Reverend <HI>Commissary</HI> having prov'd (as he thought) that he and those that are with him, don't hold any <HI>Merit</HI> in <HI>Good Works;</HI> and that Good Works must go before <HI>Justifica∣tion,</HI> because they go before <HI>Salvation:</HI> He comes in the</P>
<P>3d Place to speak to the <HI>Twelfth Article</HI> of the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had said, was full against Good Works <HI>preceeding</HI> Justification; and which he labours to prove is not inconsistent with that Doctrine. Pag. 18. And to this purpose he observes, that the Article don't mean to exclude Good Works from going before Justification, because it <HI>hath no Ne∣gative Words to exclude them</HI> For my Part, I should think, that the Article saving that <HI>Good Works</HI> are the <HI>Fruits of Faith,</HI> and follow <HI>after Justification,</HI> doth sufficiently exclude any Good <HI>Works from going before:</HI> and am persuaded he would think so too, were it not that he hath such a Kindness for them, as to bring them into the Condition of our Justification, and is not <HI>willing</HI> they should be excluded. Supposing <HI>the Article</HI> of the Church which speaks of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> had contain'd a Clause similar to this; and asserted that Men were chargea∣ble with Guilt in the Sight of God, <HI>after</HI> they arrived to Years of <HI>Discretion;</HI> would not the <HI>Commissary</HI> have seen <HI>clearly</HI> that <HI>the Article</HI> intended to exclude any Sin from <HI>going before;</HI> and rejoyce that it was so full in their Favour; crying out,

<P>He goes on and saith that the <HI>next following Article,</HI> entitled of <HI>Works before Justification,</HI> confirms his Assertion, viz. That <HI>the other did not mean to exclude Good Works from going before Justification.</HI> The Words are <HI>Works before the Grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit are not pleasing to God:</HI> He asks <HI>why?</HI> And then answers in the following Clause of the Article, <HI>Because they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ.</HI> Upon which his Remark is, that here it is plain, that <HI>by Works be∣fore Justification</HI> the Article means Works that are <HI>so</HI> before it, as to be before the <HI>Grace</HI> of Christ, and consequently <HI>Faith</HI> in him; that is in a <HI>State of meer Heathenism, and Infide∣lity:</HI> And therefore he inters that Works that <HI>are not so be∣fore the Grace of Christ,</HI> that is, Works perform'd by all that live under the Gospel, and are not Infidels, by this Article, are suppos'd to be good and acceptable to God.</P>
<P>This Gentleman speaks of several trembling Fits which came upon him while he was writing his Letters; and in my Opinion <HI>this</HI> was a Place for him to have trembled in, and to have been horribly afraid. For it seems utterly im∣possible, that it should enter into any Man's Heart, that the <HI>Compilers</HI> of the Article design'd to be understood in this Sense. He knows that the <HI>whole Article</HI> was level'd at the <HI>Papists,</HI> who held that <HI>Good Works,</HI> which were <HI>meritorious</HI> of <HI>Condignity</HI> or <HI>Congruity,</HI> went <HI>before</HI> Justification, and were <HI>Means of it.</HI> The meridian Sun is not plainer, to any one that reads it. And yet he would give the World to understand, that the De∣sign of the Article was only to shew that the Good Works of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI> were of but little Value. How∣ever, if Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> will declare that he expounded <HI>this Arti∣cle</HI> in the simplicity of his Heart; that he verily believes this wild romantick Sense was intended by the Authors; and that he doth not feel something within him at the same time, pu∣nishing him for saying so; the Publick may have a better Opinion of his <HI>Honesty,</HI> tho' not of his <HI>Judgment.</HI> It is <HI>for a

And here I shall detach but one single Passage of the whole Army of them, which are ready to make out this Truth And that is what we read in Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth is not condemned.</HI> Which shews, (it Words of the Holy Ghost can shew it) that as soon as it may be said of a Man that he <HI>Believes in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, with <HI>such a Kind of Faith</HI> as is there intended; so soon it may be said of him, that <HI>he is not condemned, but justified.</HI> I don't sup∣pose this Text will signify any Thing with Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and <HI>Friends;</HI> for they have such a knack of explaining away the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> that they care not how <HI>many of them stand in their way?</HI></P>
<P>But what will they say here? Why, that <HI>by</HI> BELIEVING <HI>the Apostle means</HI> BELIEVING <HI>and</HI> WORKING <HI>too.</HI> But why will they say so? For no other Reason in the World, but because they would have it so: their <HI>Wills</HI> and not their <HI>Un∣derstandings</HI> helping them to explain or rather to darken the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Words: for the <HI>Apostle</HI> seems to have guarded with all his Might, against Good Works going <HI>before</HI> Justification, to the Conviction of all <HI>Legalists</HI> in his Days, and to <HI>the End of Time: but almost to none Effect.</HI> If what he hath said will not convince these Men, I am sore nothing would. Nay, if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had said, <HI>that the first meer Act of Faith and Justifica∣tion are coexistent,</HI> in so many Words; which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> faith now <HI>is absolutely false:</HI> I say, if these had been <HI>Words</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> would not he and Friends confure them as perfectly consistent with their beloved <HI>Nation of Good Works going before Justification?</HI> I doubt not but they would. Nay, I could tell the Way they would go to work in such a difficult Case.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="004705_0023_100DBD67E4909C68"/>
Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> assures us, <Q>that no one can be under any Temp∣tation of disbelieving that Men are justified immediately upon their believing: and gives this very odd Reason for it, viz. Because the less we are required to do, so much the happier is it for us, who are able to do so little, and who are so unwilling to do any thing at all.</Q> Pag. 20</P>
<P>That is in other Words, Since Salvation is easier upon the Supposition that Men are justified by Faith, before the doing of Good Works, than upon Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Supposition, that Works are necessary before Justification; therefore any one would be rather tempted to believe the former to be right, than the latter, provided there were Grounds for it in Scripture. And I grant that were <HI>justifying Faith</HI> a Thing so scandalously cheap as the <HI>Faith of Assent</HI> is, he would be <HI>right;</HI> it would be an easier way to Heaven than <HI>his,</HI> and Men would NATURALLY hold <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith.</HI> But since <HI>justifying Faith</HI> is supposed to be a <HI>Principle infused</HI> into the Soul by the SPIRIT OF GOD, which Man can't attain to of himself, and which therefore is infinitely harder than doing <HI>dead Works,</HI> before Justification; 'tis the Difficulty of Salvation this way which makes Men <HI>naturally</HI> reject it, <HI>tho' a Man declare it unto them,</HI> and chuse Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s way be∣fore it.</P>
<P>For they say thus within themselves; if this <HI>infused Faith</HI> is necessary, as we know nothing of it at present, to it being out of our Power, it may be we never shall: And hence they will hold to <HI>that Way</HI> which seems <HI>most in their Power,</HI> and in spight of Scripture seek to be <HI>justifyed</HI> by the <HI>Works of the Law;</HI> tho' God himself by Inspiration assures us that <HI>by the Deeds of the Law no Flesh living shall be justified,</HI> Rom, 3.20.</P>
<P>Nay, I would appeal to the Consciences of Mr <HI>Garden</HI> and Abettors, whether or no the grand Cause of <HI>their</HI> Malignity against Justification by an <HI>infused Faith,</HI> be not a Fear that they are unacquainted with <HI>the Thing;</HI> and consequently an Apprehension that if the <HI>Doctrine</HI> be <HI>true,</HI> they themselves are in a State of Damnation as yet, and without so much Power to work out their own Salvation, as they chuse to think themselves possess'd of Had they comfortable Hopes that let this Doctrine be ever so true, they should run no Risque of <HI>Eternal Salvation;</HI> would they oppose the Doctrine with so much Vigour and Rage? I am sure they would not. Vast
<PB N="42" REF="004705_0024_100DBD6AB48A9B78"/>Allowances ought therefore to be made by their Hearers and Readers, when they find them set for the Defence of the contrary way of Justification: For it is for their Interest; <HI>by this Craft they have their Comfort:</HI> If the other Way be right, they are undone for ever: And therefore it stands them in Hand, to be zealous against it.</P>
<P>But with the <HI>Opposers</HI> of <HI>their Doctrine</HI> it is not so. Let it be never so <HI>Right</HI> they are not hurt by it. If <HI>this Faith</HI> should be a Whimsey (as <HI>they</HI> think and call it) yet they hold and practice <HI>Good Works,</HI> at least as much as their Bre∣thren; and therefore if the <HI>Arminian Justification</HI> be the right one, they shall be justified with an <HI>Arminian</HI> Justification.</P>
<P>It would therefore be highly proper for <HI>Laymen,</HI> when they hear <HI>Ministers</HI> on both Sides zealously cry down each others Method of Justification, to inquire with the wise Romans, <HI>Cui bono?</HI> i. e. What Advantage they propose to themselves by their Zeal? And if they find those who preach <HI>against Justification</HI> by an <HI>infused Faith,</HI> are afraid that the Doctrine should be true; as most certainly they are, lest they should lose their Peace: And on the contrary that those Ministers, who preach down <HI>their Justification,</HI> have no Interest to pro∣mote by it, but only the <HI>common Salvation;</HI> these Considera∣tions ought in Reason to go a great way with them.</P>
<P>I am afraid Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Confederates, will make them∣selves <HI>merry</HI> rather than <HI>serious</HI> with these Things; alledging that <HI>this Faith</HI> is a meer <HI>Nonentity,</HI> and that all the Arguments in the World, cannot give a real Existence to it. But why should <HI>they speak Evil of the Things which they know not; and sport themselves with their own Deceivings?</HI> They are sensible that the Scripture speaks almost every where of <HI>a certain Faith</HI> which <HI>doth justify.</HI> They themselves are ashamed to say that the <HI>Faith of Assent</HI> doth <HI>justify.</HI> And as to what <HI>they</HI> call <HI>justifying Faith,</HI> they know it is not properly <HI>Faith,</HI> but a <HI>compound</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> together. Would it not be their Wisdom therefore to conclude that there is <HI>some other thing</HI> which is <HI>truly</HI> JUSTIFYING FAITH, and to seek after it? They have the <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>thousands,</HI> and <HI>thousands,</HI> whom they must own to be as wise and as good Men as themselves, <HI>who have obtained this Mercy of the Lord:</HI> and who will tell them that they build all their Hopes upon it, counting <HI>Faith
<PB N="43" REF="004705_0024_100DBD6AB48A9B78"/>of Assent,</HI> and <HI>unregenerate Morality</HI> in <HI>all its Glory,</HI> to be <HI>but Loss and Dung</HI> in comparison of it.</P>
<P>Nay, there are many who can assure them that they them∣selves in the <HI>Times of their Ignorance,</HI> were <HI>Scoffers</HI> and <HI>Mockers</HI> at the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> being elated with <HI>unsanctified Rea∣son,</HI> and the Pride of <HI>Philosophy falsly so called:</HI> And that they have had their towering Thoughts and <HI>lofty Imaginations</HI> brought down to the <HI>Foolishness of an infused Faith;</HI> and that they would not be deprived of it for Millions of Worlds. Why therefore, should these Men reject it upon the <HI>Foun∣dation</HI> of <HI>their own Want of Experience:</HI> for <HI>other Foundation can no Man have against it?</HI> Would not they themselves call that <HI>Debauchee</HI> a <HI>Madman,</HI> who should affirm there was no <HI>Pleasure</HI> in a <HI>religious Life,</HI> because he <HI>never found</HI> any in it? And yet this is exactly <HI>their own Case,</HI> who deny that the <HI>exceeding Greatness of God's Power</HI> is exerted upon the Souls of <HI>Believers,</HI> meerly because they are not conscious of any such blessed Operations upon their own.</P>
<P>Surely if they would be prevail'd upon to <HI>act as Men,</HI> and <HI>as Christians;</HI> they would <HI>be jealous over themselves with a godly Jealousy,</HI> and <HI>cry mightily to GOD, that what they know not be would teach them:</HI> giving themselves no rest till the same Spirit which <HI>worketh</HI> in others, work <HI>effectually in them also,</HI> making them <HI>Partakers of like precious Faith:</HI> Which GOD of his infinite Mercy grant unto all that are destitute of it; through JESUS CHRIST our <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Which brings me to the</P>
<P>2d Thing, which was to shew that the Doctrine of a Man's being <HI>justified</HI> immediately upon his <HI>believing,</HI> is not only true, but a Doctrine of <HI>Importance</HI> Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> faith, that as long as this Foundation is <HI>held sure,</HI> that Men are justi∣fied by a true and lively Faith, that is, a Faith actually pro∣ducing Good Works; it is of no manner of Consequence whether <HI>Good Works go before Justification, or not.</HI> And I grant that there is an Appearance of Truth in what he faith: And 'tis this <HI>Deceivableness of Error,</HI> which causes many inconsiderate Persons, to conclude that 'tis not worth the while to set up one <HI>way of Justification,</HI> and to pull <HI>down the other;</HI> since both hold, that it Men don't <HI>Maintain Good Works,</HI> as well as <HI>Be∣lieve,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="004705_0025_100DBD6D9DDFEF18"/>there will be no Heaven for them. But yet there is really a <HI>vast</HI> and <HI>amazing</HI> Difference between these <HI>two Opi∣nions;</HI> that <HI>Men</HI> ARE <HI>justified as soon as they believe;</HI> and that <HI>other</HI> of Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s, viz. that <HI>Men are</HI> NOT <HI>justified so soon as they believe, nor till they have done a Number of Good Works.</HI> The Belief of the <HI>former</HI> causes Sinners to go the right Way to work in Religion, viz. to <HI>seek to God in the first Place,</HI> and with their whole Hearts, that he would reveal his Son in them, and give them <HI>that Faith</HI> in <HI>him,</HI> which intitles to his <HI>Merits,</HI> and which alone can purity their Hearts, and amend their Lives: The Belief of the <HI>latter</HI> causes Persons to treasure up an heap of <HI>Good Works</HI> in hopes, that together with <HI>the Faith of Assent</HI> (which Reprobates are capable of) they shall be render'd so acceptable to their Maker that he will be <HI>merciful to their Unrighteousness, and remember their Iniquities no more.</HI> They do indeed <HI>make mention of the Righteousness</HI> (passive) <HI>of Christ,</HI> and own that 'tis through the Merit of <HI>his Sufferings,</HI> that there is <HI>Forgiveness</HI> and <HI>Justification for them with God:</HI> But then, as was said before, they think the Way to intitle themselves to this <HI>merited Justification,</HI> is by <HI>doing Works of Righteousness</HI> To give my Sentiments freely upon this Doctrine: It leads Men <HI>from</HI> CHRIST, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him. It doth not tend to make Men true <HI>Christians,</HI> but only true <HI>Pharisees.</HI> Every Preacher of it, whoever he be, is a <HI>Pharisee;</HI> and every Man begotten by him into the Be∣lief of it, is himself a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> and the Son of a <HI>Pharisee.</HI> Away, away with it then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence it came: And there let it abide as long as the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon endure;</HI> if it may not perish <HI>from under the whole Heavens through the tender Mercies of our God.</HI> Let the Friends of it but carry it back to the <HI>Land of its Nativity;</HI> and if they make no <HI>Returns</HI> or worse than none, bringing home <HI>Salt, Cream, Spittle,</HI> and other superstitious <HI>Fooleries</HI> in Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of it; they will make a <HI>saving Voyage.</HI> For there is really <HI>more deadly Poison</HI> in this <HI>one Tenet</HI> of <HI>Good Works going before Justification,</HI> than there is in <HI>one half</HI> of the <HI>Popish Ceremonies</HI> put together.

<P>The great Outcry of the Clergy against them, and what makes them set the <HI>profaner Populace</HI> a roaring as them, is a Pretence that they are so full of <HI>Zeal,</HI> that they have no <HI>Charity:</HI> and yet whoever is present at their <HI>Devo∣tions,</HI> and observes the vehement and <HI>flaming Love to GOD, and the Souls of Men,</HI> which runs through them all; will be ready to think, that of <HI>all Men living</HI> these Men have <HI>Cha∣rity;</HI> or else that what their Enemies call <HI>Charity</HI> is a poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sorry Thing, and not worth the having. And indeed there is sorrowful Occasion to observe, that <HI>Charity</HI> (as <HI>well as Faith</HI>) is <HI>quite another Thing</HI> from what it was in the Days of the A∣postles. It now mostly stands for a woful <HI>Neutrality,</HI> with regard to <HI>those Truths we are bid to contend earnestly for;</HI> and consequential <HI>Belief</HI> that <HI>the Way to Heaven is very broad and easy.</HI> And accordingly <HI>those Ministers</HI> who are most <HI>formal</HI> and <HI>sleepy</HI> in the House of the <HI>living God;</HI> who are most regardless of <HI>working out their own Salvation with fear and trembling;</HI> and of taking others by the Hand, and leading them in the way in which they should go; are the most <HI>charitable Men,</HI> according to the common, and perverse Ac∣ceptation of the Word. And indeed, <HI>this Thing must needs be so:</HI> For he that hardly believes there <HI>is an Heaven,</HI> will ordinarily hare any Disputes about the <HI>Way</HI> to it; and will rather <HI>charitably</HI> believe that almost all Mankind are tra∣velling to <HI>Heaven,</HI> as well as himself, if there be <HI>an Heaven.</HI> Of <HI>this Charity,</HI> I readily grant Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and those o∣ther Gentlemen, know but little; saving that they frequently observe and lament it in their <HI>Enemies.</HI> But then, as for St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Charity</HI> which consists in an ardent <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>GOD and CHRIST,</HI> and an <HI>unquenchable Desire</HI> after the <HI>Salvation of perishing Souls,</HI> to say the least of them, <HI>they come not a whit behind the chiefest of their</HI> Adversaries.</P>
<P>And inasmuch as the Pleasure of the Lord apparently prospers in their Hands; inasmuch as <HI>Ministers of all Deno∣minations</HI>

<P>Mr <HI>Garden</HI> coming near the close of his Letter, rattles off Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> upon the old Score, of his accusing him and the Clergy of his Mind, of holding <HI>Good Works</HI> to be <HI>me∣ritorious;</HI> or <HI>that Men are justified by them:</HI> telling him that he hath not prov'd this poisonous Insinuation; and that he dares not pretend to do it for these two Reasons; <HI>because he hath no Talent at proving any Thing;</HI> and <HI>because he is conscious to himself</HI> that the same Arguments which he must bring to prove Merit upon them, will help the <HI>Solifidian</HI> to prove Merit upon himself.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first</HI> of them; viz his having <HI>no Talent at proving any Thing,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> saith of him <HI>in his haste;</HI> were this true, he might nevertheless, make out his <HI>Assertion.</HI> For there requires <HI>no Genius for Disputing,</HI> to prove so plain a Matter, as that of the indicted Clergy, holding <HI>Good Works to be meritorious; or that Men are justified by them.</HI> He needed only to have collected what they themselves have said, and then the unprejudiced Part of Mankind would have seen that <HI>they were condemned out of their own Mouths.</HI></P>
<P>And then, as to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s being scared from such an Attempt, by an Apprehension of the <HI>Solifidians</HI> being upon his back, and mauling him with the same Weapons, which he must use in mauling his Clerical Brethren: I answer, this would <HI>have been fearing where no fear was.</HI></P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> looks upon Good Works as <HI>what</HI> do (at least in Part) <HI>justify:</HI> But Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> don't imagine that Good Works <HI>save</HI> Men in any Measure; but are only the <HI>genuine Effects</HI> of that which doth instrumentally <HI>save</HI> them, i. <HI>Faith.</HI> So that since <HI>Good Works</HI> are not <HI>so</HI> necessary to <HI>Salvation</HI> ac∣cording to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> as they are <HI>to Justification,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Garden;</HI> nor necessary <HI>in the same Manner;</HI> it is abundantly evident, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Arguments against the Clergy upon the Point of Merit, could not have been improv'd against himself by the <HI>Solifidians.</HI> And yet Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is so perswaded to the contrary, that he gives <HI>his Word and Honour,</HI> that in Case it can be shewn, that <HI>he</HI> can defend himself against a Charge of Merit, from <HI>Solifidians,</HI> better than <HI>himself</HI> and Friends can from the same Charge brought by <HI>him</HI> against <HI>them;</HI> he will turn <HI>Methodist,</HI> the next Moment.

<P>I purposely omit making any Answer to what follows in this Letter about <HI>Fire, Fagot, Jesuits, Deists, Persecution</HI> &amp;c. because there is nothing material contained in these Para∣graphs, that needs answering; and also because I have been so long already in discussing other Matters.</P>
<P>In <HI>his Postscript;</HI> he desires Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> to help out Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> against a <HI>Self Contradiction</HI> which he endeavours to prove upon him from two Expressions cited from him. Concerning which I would remark, that the <HI>Contradiction,</HI> is <HI>only</HI> a <HI>seeming.</HI> and <HI>not a real</HI> one.

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, Concerning the Rev. Mr. GARDEN'S Treatment of his Christian Brother the Rev. Mr. WHITEFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occasion of this Appendix is that vain glorious Paragraph in Mr. Commissary's Third Letter, dated at Charlestown <HI>April</HI> 8. 1740, in the following Words—<Q>But still PERSECUTION—you cry out; — <HI>for</HI> WANT <HI>of it</HI> you mean: For OURS <HI>is</HI> NO <HI>Persecuting Country for Religion;</HI> EVERY MAN <HI>may enjoy</HI> HIS OWN WAY <HI>in</HI> PEACE <HI>and</HI> SAFETY. But as you may regard the being <HI>Persecuted</HI> as something essential to a true Christian, and ne∣cessary to keep up the Spirit of Christianity, you seem to be <HI>in Quest and Pursuit</HI> of it; <HI>Please only to step into a Neighbour∣ing Country,</HI> SPAIN <HI>or</HI> PORTUGAL, <HI>and you'l hid fair, I dare say, to find it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And now we'l see <HI>how long</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> will keep his Rev. and Christian Brother <HI>Whitefield</HI> in WANT of <HI>Perse∣cution;</HI> and how long the Bishop's <HI>Commissary</HI> will maintain the King's Province of <HI>South Carolina,</HI> to be <HI>no Persecuting Country</HI> for Religion; how long <HI>every Man</HI> may enjoy <HI>his own way</HI> there in <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Safety;</HI> and how long his pious and excellent Brother Clergyman Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had need of stepping into <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> to <HI>find</HI> out <HI>Persecution.</HI> For</P>
<P N="1">I. As <HI>Ishmael</HI>'s MOCKING <HI>Isaac,</HI> Gen. 21.9 is by the inspired Apostle thus described, Gal. iv. 29. <HI>As then be that was born after the Flesh</HI> PERSECUTED <HI>him that was born after the Spirit; even so it is</HI> NOW. I may for the same Reason assert the
<PB N="50" REF="004705_0028_100D86CCEDFA5ED8"/>same Thing both of the present Age and of the present Case—<HI>Even so it is</HI> NOW. Or it <HI>Mockings, Scoffs</HI> and <HI>Jeers</HI> of the Pious and Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> for his strict Adherence to the Holy Scriptures, as well as the Articles and Homi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of the Church of England, in the great Point of Justifica∣tion by Faith in Christ, and by this Faith alone; be <HI>Perse∣cution:</HI> Then Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> has Persecuted Mr. <HI>Whitefield;</HI> as <HI>Ishmael</HI> Persecuted <HI>Isaac.</HI></P>
<P>To make this evident, I shall here set down some of Mr. Commissary's bitter Words and Scoffings in his <HI>Third &amp; Fifth</HI> Letters, as follow — LETTER III. Dated <HI>April</HI> 8.</P>
<P>In Page 8. Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> charges Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> with 'wilful and malicious Slander'. Pag 9. 'Your Reve∣rence'. — Apparent Shuffle'. Pag. 12. 'Your Reve∣rence'. — Not without Shuffle — Thus your Reverence'. Pag. 13. 'Arrogant and wicked Slander in you— Miserable Distinction, a poor Jingle of Words — A Wrang∣ler in your own Way'. Pag 14 'Your Mob Harangues— Guilty of wilful Slander'. — Nonsense'.</P>
<P>In Page 16, 17, 18 are Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s following Flouts on the late Rev. Learned, Pious and highly esteemed Dr <HI>Edwards,</HI> one of the principal Ornaments of the Church of England in his Day, and doubtless now in Glory. — Page 16. 'Sense∣less Distinction'.—'Silly Subterfuges'.—'Rare Champion of Grace!'—'Wonderful Fears!' Pag. 17. 'A very sorry Decision'.—'His Apprehension of the Matter is absurd'. Pag. 18. 'Sanctified Logick out of all Question!' — 'Arrant Piece of Nonsense'.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary</HI> returns to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> with the following reviling and jeering Passages, Pag. 20. 'You reach and deceive the People'.—'Your poisoned Insinuation; false and insidious!' <Q>—You have no Talent at proving any Thing.</Q>—<Q>Up starts a hair-brain'd Solifidian, &amp;runs about a Mouthing—</Q>. Pag. 21, 22 <Q>Lay your Hand on your Mouth! Nay rather open it wide, and recall the Slan∣der you have scattered far and wide around you</Q> — <Q>The Fire you have kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed is that of Slander and Defamation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Fire which no Devil in Hell, no nor Jesuit nor Deist on Earth will ever go about to extinguish, but fagot and foment it with all their Might—</Q> Is it not you that falsely accuse
<PB N="51" REF="004705_0028_100D86CCEDFA5ED8"/>the Brethren? '—Pursue the first Plan you amused the World with'.— <Q>But why poor Gentleman are you thus to be Ban∣tered? Are you not really Persecuted? Are you not cast out of the Synagogues; excluded the Church of England Pulpits; and treated as a Disciple of Fox or MUGGLETON? And is not all this PERSECUTION? But for what Cause ARE YOU THUS TREATED? Why only for the trifling Cause of accusing the Clergy &amp;c.</Q>— 'Will your Reverence be pleased &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI>'s IVth LETTER, dated <HI>April</HI> 15. is about an <HI>Anonymous Pamphlet,</HI> which he says <HI>He presumes not to know whether Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>approves of all and every Thing it con∣tains.</HI> But in his Vth Letter, dated <HI>April</HI> 21. Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> readily returns to the same kind of abusive Language, in the following Passages:</P>
<P>Pag. 32. <Q>Had you observed common Decency or good Manners — But your contrary Behaviour, exposes you to the utmost Scorn &amp; Contempt.</Q>—<Q>You know how, pretend∣ing the Cause of God, to bring railing Accusations, to sup∣port some Crotchets you have got in your own Brains.</Q> Pag. 33. <Q>You know how to dispense it to the Populace in a Vehicle of cant Terms, without Sense or Meaning.</Q> Pag. 35. 'Arrant Gibberish!' Pag. 36. 'Your monstrous Inference'. —'You love dearly to shuffl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e among Terms'.—<Q>Alas my old Friend, whether is your poor Head now a wandering?</Q>— <Q>In your Mountebank Way, you have young <HI>David</HI> like, as you fancy, slain your <HI>Geliah.</HI></Q>—<Q>In the Pride and Naugh∣tiness of your Heart, you have made so absurd an Attempt and so foolishly manag'd it.</Q> — 'Your dirty Pamphlets'. Pag. 36, 37. <Q>But might not one such Conquest have sufficed you, as it did young <HI>David,</HI> at a Time? No, your noble Spirit scorns only to imitate, but must excel. No sooner have you dispatch'd this Champion of the un∣circumcised in Heart and Ears; but advancing from a <HI>David</HI> into a Knight of <HI>Lamanca,</HI> you go straight in Pur∣suit of new Adventures! And who unhappily falls in your Way, but another Son of <HI>Anak,</HI> the Author of the Whole Duty of Man? Down he must come; — and thus you gird your self for the Battle.</Q> Pag. 37. <Q>Choice Ar∣mour indeed! who shall be able to stand before you? None sure but the Pope and the Mufti — a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Tri∣umvirate
<PB N="52" REF="004705_0029_100DBD780E34DF10"/>of Infallibles! Your Reverence, the Pope and the Mufti — most consummate Assurance, wherewith you jointly and severally disturb and confound the World</Q> — 'Who dares dispute your Infallibility'. Pag 38. <Q>Thus an elder Brother of yours, the ever memorable GEORGE Fox, an Infallible also in his Day, to whom God had given the true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace.</Q>—<Q>Your Reverence.</Q>—'Another noble Champion of Grace'. —'Your 'Reverence'.—'This Brother Champion of yours'. Page 39. 'Your Infallibility'. — 'Enlighren'd with your Reve∣rence'. Pag 40. <Q>Have you not been dabling with the <HI>Marrow of modern Divinity,</HI> or some such precious Book, which puz∣zles your Head, and lies crude on your Understanding? Or are you deputed by some other Head or Hand behind the Curtain, to put off such Stuff upon the World? Or finally, do you really mean to burlesque the Bible &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I might recite other Passages; but am weary of them, and so I believe is the Christian Reader. But on the whole, I would ask, whether this is the Language of a grave, meek and humble <HI>Minister</HI> and <HI>Disciple of</HI> JESUS; or of a <HI>Bishop's Commissary?</HI> Exalted with a secular Dignity over, and look∣ing down with Scorn upon his pious and labourious Brother; and a Brother flaming with a wondrous Zeal, and spending his Strength more than all other Men in these Parts of the World, for the <HI>Conversion</HI> of Souls, and <HI>Recovery</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> to those <HI>Pure Doctrines of Grace and Justifi∣cation;</HI> for which her <HI>first Reformers</HI> gloriously suffered Mar∣tyrdom; but which Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> now <HI>Derides,</HI> and says the <HI>present Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> are of the same Opi∣nion with him: tho' both He and They have all solemnly declared <HI>their unfeigned Assent</HI> to the contrary.</P>
<P>And as when <HI>there was a Strife among</HI> the <HI>First Ministers of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which of them should be accounted the Greatest</HI> — JESUS <HI>called them to him and said, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise</HI> DOMINION <HI>over them; and they that are Great exercise</HI> AUTHORITY <HI>upon them; but</HI> IT SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU, Luk. xxii. and Math. xx. So Mini∣sters of a worldly Spirit, have in all Ages affected worldly <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority;</HI> like even those first Ministers of CHRIST, for which he justly blamed them; and like the Princes
<PB N="53" REF="004705_0029_100DBD780E34DF10"/>and other great Ones among the Gentiles, which he forbids them in the least to imitate lin the Exercise of <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority.</HI> A most wise and gracious Prohibition! As all Ages restisy; who have always found that the raising the Ministers of Christ to worldly <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> has rais'd their Pride, and made them Worldly, nourished their spiteful Passions, ruined their humble Character; and given them a dreadful Scope to wreak their Malice and Revenge on those beneath them. And <HI>none in the World have so cruelly used their Power as Clergymen invested with a worldly Dominion and Authority.</HI></P>
<P>The BRITISH COLONIES have indeed <HI>till now</HI> been hap∣pily free from their terrible <HI>Dominion.</HI> But whoever considers the <HI>Spirit</HI> which Mr <HI>Garden</HI> shows in <HI>the above Expressions,</HI> will be apt to think that he only wanted a <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Opportunity</HI> to vex his Rev and Pious <HI>Brother</HI> in a more grievous Manner. And it is not long ere the <HI>Commissary</HI> finds an <HI>Opportunity,</HI> and readily lays hold on it, to make Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> know and feel his <HI>Power.</HI> As we in the</P>
<P N="2">II. Place proceed to show. For in the latter End of <HI>June</HI> following Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> goes from the Province of <HI>Georgia</HI> into the Province of <HI>South Carolina.</HI> On Thursday <HI>July</HI> 3. enters <HI>Charlestown.</HI> The next Day being Friday <HI>July</HI> 4, receives a Letter from the <HI>Commissary,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> immediately answers. On Saturday <HI>July</HI> 5, Preaches twice: and Lord's Day <HI>July</HI> 6 twice more. On the same Day he goes to <HI>Church</HI> both Forenoon and Afternoon: and as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> writes in the following Words—<Q>I heard the <HI>Commissary</HI> Preach as <HI>virulent</HI> and <HI>unorthodox, inconsistent Dis∣course,</HI> as ever I heard in my Life. His Heart seemed full of Choler and Resentment: Out of the Abundance thereof, he poured forth so many bitter Words against the <HI>Methodists</HI> (as he called them) in general, and <HI>Me</HI> in particular, that several who intended to receive the Sacrament at his Hands, withdrew. Never I believe was such a Preparation Sermon preach'd before. I could not help thinking the Preacher was of the same Spirit with Bishop <HI>Gardner</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days. After Sermon he sent his Clerk to desire me not to come to the Sacrament, till he had spoke with me — I immediately retired to my Lodging, rejoycing that I was
<PB N="54" REF="004705_0030_100DBD7BED060BF8"/>accounted worthy to suffer this further Degree of Contempt for my dear Lord's Sake. <HI>Blessed Jesus lay it not to the Com∣missary's Charge.</HI> Amen and Amen.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this I appeal to every impartial Reader, whether Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> had not by this preceeding Management utterly <HI>disqualified</HI> Himself from being look'd upon as an <HI>impartial Judge</HI> over a Brother Clergyman, whom he had so openly and opprobriously Reviled?</P>
<P>But the more the <HI>Commissary</HI> rails, the more his People grow offended, and the more they leave him, and grow more cager of hearing another sort of Preaching and another sort of Language in the meek and humble Person reviled. And Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> being denied the Priviledge of Preaching in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> tho' desired by great Numbers of that So∣ciety: where, when ever he officiates, he always uses the <HI>Common Prayer Book</HI> and conforms thereto; as he accounts himself obliged, when in the <HI>Episcopal Churches:</HI> At the Desire of the People, he Pray'd and Preach'd in the <HI>Presby∣terian Meeting House:</HI> and accounting himself not obliged by Law to use the Common Prayer Book in them, <HI>be Pray'd without it.</HI> Upon which the very next Day, viz <HI>Monday July</HI> 7. Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> could bear no longer, but begins the Exercise of his COMMISSARIAL <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> in the follow∣ing <HI>Writ</HI> or <HI>Order.</HI></P>

And Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> objected, <HI>That tho' there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght be a</HI> GENERAL POWER <HI>given the</HI> Bishop <HI>to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>siastical
<PB N="57" REF="004705_0031_100DBD7F831571A8"/>Jurisdiction in that Province; yet the</HI> EXTENT <HI>of that Power was to be determined by</HI> PARTICULAR ACTS <HI>of</HI> ASSEM∣BLY. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> further urged, <HI>that a Court of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was intirely unprecedented in</HI> AMERICA; <HI>that be belong'd to</HI> GEORGIA, <HI>a different Province, not under the Commissary's Power, and was at</HI> SOUTH CAROLINA <HI>only as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> He also added that tho' he had preach'd in the Fields near <HI>London</HI> some Months, yet the <HI>Bishop</HI> never attempted to exercise such Authority over him — that the <HI>Commissarys</HI> in <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Penfilvania</HI> were meer Cyphers — that the <HI>Trustees,</HI> to his Knowledge. Questioned the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI>'s having any Juris∣diction in those Parts — and that he desired he might have till To-morrow 9 o'Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourn'd, to inform himself of the Extent of their Ecclesiasti∣cal Jurisdiction in that Province: And tho' at first the Com∣missary said, <HI>He had indulg'd Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>too far already;</HI> yet after some Consideration granted his Request, and adjourn'd. And Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> preach'd twice more that Day in <HI>Charistown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> July 16. At 10 in the Morning, Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> appeared; and by the Advice of his Friends, exhibited a <HI>Recusatio Judicis,</HI> that is, <HI>his Exception against the</HI> COMMISSA∣RY'S <HI>being his</HI> Judge <HI>in this Cause; having too great Reason to believe the Commissary prejudic'd against him.</HI> At first the <HI>Com∣missary</HI> refused to Read it. At length he took Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Paper, read it to himself, and said, <HI>He wou'd not except it</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> then stood up according to Law a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d said he would go and Protest against all further Proceedings as null &amp; void, and lest the Court: But being called back by the <HI>Appariter</HI> and <HI>Register,</HI> he return'd, and gave in <HI>his Exception,</HI> to be Read and Filed. By this time the <HI>Commissary</HI> had gotten Mr. <HI>Gra∣ham</HI> an Attorney to appear in behalf of <HI>the Court,</HI> who insisted on having <HI>the Exceptions tried in Court:</HI> But as according to La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr <HI>Whitefield</HI> had referred them to the Examininaion of <HI>six Arbitrators,</HI> 3 nominated by him, and 3 by the <HI>Commissary;</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Attorney Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> in his Behalf, <HI>Protested against all further Proceedings, and against his appearing at the next Court, till the Reference to Arbitrators was complied with:</HI> it being quite improbable to imagine that the <HI>Commissary,</HI> who must be <HI>judged</HI> if the Exceptions should be tried by <HI>that Court,</HI> should allow himself prejudiced. — Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> being de∣sire: then went to <HI>James Island</HI> and read Prayers and Preach∣ed, and stay'd all Night.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="004705_0032_100DBD81DEB04ED8"/>
Next Day, viz. <HI>Thursday July</HI> 17, He return'd, and by his Attorney's Advice appear'd in Court again, to see if <HI>his Excep∣tions</HI> were <HI>admitted to Arbitration,</HI> according to Law, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Repelled.</HI> And finding <HI>his Exceptions</HI> REPELLED, and his Attorney stop∣ped, as he was rising up to invalidate what the other Attorney said; Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> APPEALED <HI>to</HI> HIS MAJESTY <HI>in the High Court of Chancery,</HI> and <HI>declared all other Proceedings in that Court against him to be null and void.</HI> Which caused many to re∣joyce and give Thanks to God on his Behalf.</P>
<P><HI>Friday July</HI> 18, and <HI>Saturday July</HI> 19, He Preached twice each Day again at <HI>Charlestown.</HI> And <HI>Saturday</HI> after the After∣noon Exercise, being desired by the <HI>Apparitor</HI> to go to the <HI>Commissary;</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> went: and at his Desire to <HI>sware</HI> he wou'd <HI>lodge his Appeal</HI> within a <HI>Twelve Month,</HI> and to De∣posite <HI>Ten Pounds Sterling,</HI> and finding the Commissary's Orders gave him Authority to require it; Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> took the <HI>Oath,</HI> and promised to leave <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in the Hands of a Friend &amp;c.</P>
<P>And thus Ends this famous &amp; FIRST <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> or rather <HI>Clergical Court</HI> in the BRITISH COLONIES. But what a Thou∣sand Pities, that it was not the first Time erected, to punish some <HI>notorious Immorality</HI> or other either in the <HI>Episcopal Clergy</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> to <HI>whom alone</HI> it belongs, and among whom, <HI>as well as others,</HI> there are <HI>notorious Immoralities</HI> enough abounding in all the Colonies? Or if an <HI>Episcopal Clergyman</HI> must be the primary Object of this Commissarial Power &amp; Severity; what a thousand Pities, that their <HI>First Court</HI> was not erected to pu∣nish some or other for Playing at <HI>Cards</HI> and <HI>Dice,</HI> or <HI>haunting Taverns,</HI> or <HI>too much constant Drinking,</HI> or <HI>some other Misde∣meanour,</HI> which they need not take much Pains to find or prove.</P>
<P>But <HI>instead of this</HI>—To begin with <HI>a young Clergyman</HI> of such extraordinary Sanctity of Manners, and of such slaming Zeal to promote the highest Degrees of Piety, as we find none superiour since the Apostles Days — It cannot possibly re∣commend <HI>these Courts</HI> to the Esteem of the British Colonies; but rather to their universal and great Displeasure. For tho' the <HI>common People</HI> in EUROPE are generally so ignorant and weak as to hug the Chains of the Clergy, and keep them on as fast and long as possible — the AMERICANS live in a freer Air, more generally taste the Sweets of Liberty; and being nearer an Equality of Birth and Wealth, there being Land enough for every industrious Person; there are fewer a∣mong them in Dependance on others, they are generally more
<PB N="59" REF="004705_0032_100DBD81DEB04ED8"/>knowing than the <HI>common People</HI> in EUROPE; and are not like for several Ages, or as long as this near Equality remains, to desire the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> over them</P>
<P>Upon viewing the <HI>Terms</HI> of the WRIT, I believe there is scarce a Man of common Sense in all the Colonies that can forbear smiling to read of the mighty heinous Articles ob∣jected to the <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Rev.</HI> Mr WHITEFIELD—<HI>concerning the meer</HI> HEALTH <HI>of</HI> HIS SOUL <HI>and the</HI> REFORMATION <HI>and</HI> CORRECTION OF HIS MANNERS <HI>and Excrsses; and</HI> CHIEFLY [CHIEFLY] <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or</HI> OMITTING <HI>to use the Form of Prayers prescribed in the Communion Book</HI> Tho' every Man of common Know∣lege among us knows that the <HI>Form of Prayers prescribed in the Communion Book,</HI> was Prescribed to be used <HI>only</HI> in <HI>Episcopal Churches</HI> or <HI>Chapels:</HI> and not Prescribed to be used in other Congregations, either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> And how hugely does this Affair concern <HI>the mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> HEALTH of Mr <HI>White∣field's</HI> SOUL and the <HI>Reformation</HI> and <HI>Correction</HI> of <HI>his Manners?</HI> Tho' <HI>this Omission,</HI> even in a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Congregation, is the <HI>chief</HI> Thing to be objected to this most labourious Brother Minister; and for such an Omission chiefly or only, the <HI>Commissary</HI> has put Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> to near <HI>Two Hundred Pounds Sterling</HI> Charge, which I suppose is near <HI>Two Thousand Pounds</HI> Carolina Currency, to carry his <HI>Appeal</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and main∣tain it There.</P>
<P>And is not such a prodigious Expence as this a <HI>grievous Persecution?</HI> or is Mr. <HI>Commissary</HI> so full of Humanity as to account it no Persecution at all?— the <HI>Crime</HI> so great, and the <HI>Fine</HI> so little! —I said the <HI>Fine;</HI> For tho' strictly speaking, it may not be called a <HI>Fine;</HI> it is in Reality <HI>E∣qually heavy</HI> on the helpless Sufferer. And I do not see but it is in the Power of the <HI>Commissary</HI> and the <HI>rest of his Brethren,</HI> to put Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> or <HI>any other Episcopalian,</HI> offensive to them, to the <HI>like Expence</HI> even <HI>every Year,</HI> by forcing him to <HI>Appeal</HI> to <HI>England</HI> till they utterly ruin him: and then he must lie down under thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power. But as, alas, it is not <HI>One</HI> in a <HI>Hundred</HI> in the <HI>British Colonies</HI> that can bear the Expence of Appealing to <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Power</HI> of this <HI>Commissarial Court</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> seems to be in effect, to the most, <HI>Supream</HI> and <HI>So∣vereign.</HI> Or if the <HI>Commissaries</HI> should say — <Q>You that are able, or have able Friends to help you, need never put your selves or them to the ruinous Expence of Appealing to <HI>England;</HI></Q> This seems no more than to say, <Q>You had
<PB N="60" REF="004705_0033_100DBD8403B33460"/>better lie down &amp; submit to us, as your Sovereign or Dernier Power</Q> And I see no Way for the <HI>Episcopalians</HI> in the <HI>British Colonies</HI> to get rid of this Power, but either by joining with the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> or by lowly Submissions making Friends with their COMMISSARIES; or by obtaining the Grace of the KING and PARLIAMENT to allow of <HI>Appeals</HI> from the COM∣MISSARIAL <HI>Courts</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to the CIVIL JUDICATORIES in the <HI>several Colonies;</HI> where the People will not be afraid to be severely Punished for Trifles; and where they will be apt to expect Humanity and common Justice.</P>
<P>In the mean while, we congratulate Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> for taking such effectual Care so soon to Prove —That Mr <HI>Whitefield cries out for</HI> WANT <HI>of</HI> PERSECUTION; and that <HI>South Carolina</HI> is <HI>no Persecuting Country for Religion;</HI> but that <HI>every Man</HI> [even Mr. WHITEFIELD] <HI>may enjoy his own Way</HI> [even of Praying in a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Congregation without the Communion Book] <HI>in Peace and Safety;</HI> and if Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> wants PER∣SECUTION, He must [alter all this,] even <HI>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p into</HI> SPAIN or PORTUGAL, <HI>to find it.</HI> For Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Commissarial Pro∣secution does not near arise to his dear Doctor <HI>Sach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>s</HI> WHOLSOME SEVERITIES; i e. but wholesome Medicines for <HI>the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> HEALTH <HI>of the</HI> SOUL.</P>
