<HEAD>PREFACE to the last Edition.</HEAD>
<P>THE Public is here presented with a New Translation of the MORAL MAXIMS of Francis the Sixth, Duke de la Rochefoucault: a performance of such estimation, that its noble Author lived to see five or six Editions of it; and since his death it has run through as many more; not to mention Translations. As far as the two languages permit, the Translator has followed in the disposition of the Maxims the alphabetical order of Mr. Amelot de la Houssaye: to whom he is also beholden for many well-col∣lected authorities from the judicious Ta∣citus, and some other ancient writers. In his own notes he has chiefly aimed at the explanation, or illustration, of his Author's system. He has rejected such maxims as were manifest repetitions, or apparently spurious; and retained only such as, after comparison of the best Edi∣tions, he concluded to be genuine. He has also taken great care to <HI>express the sense of the Original</HI> (in which the Eng∣lish
<PB N="6" REF="015864_0004_0F9A315E1F991C80"/>Translations have been hitherto de∣fective); and at the same time (what none of them have attempted) to do the Duke de la Rochefoucault the justice to make him <HI>speak English.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Advertisement to the Lon∣don Edition of 1775.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Edition of the Duke de la Roche∣foucault's Maxims is not merely a republication of the last. The Transla∣tion has been revised, and treated with that sort of freedom, which the former Editor seems to have taken with the edi∣tion that preceded. From this attention, and various additional Notes, the Edition now submitted to the Public may have obtained, it is hoped, some degree of ad∣vantage. But, after all, to transfuse into our language the force and spirit of the original with conciseness and perspicuity is rather to be attempted than executed.</P>
<P>High in esteem as these Maxims are held, it must be allowed that the ingeni∣ous Writer stands criticised by many as too severe a Censor, giving ill constructi∣ons to indifferent actions, and ascribing e∣ven to good ones unworthy motives.</P>
<P>In favour of our Author's system it is alledged, that perfect virtue is not to be found in the present state of things; that
<PB N="8" REF="015864_0006_0F9A31620B5611B0"/>a mixture of error and truth constitutes too many of our actions; that He has consi∣dered the heart of man as corrupted by pride, seduced by self-love, encompassed by bad example; that certain human ac∣tions, which the world mistake for vir∣tues, are really no more than their resem∣blances; that, in spite of the efforts of Reason, Pride and Self-love never fail to lurk in the recesses of the heart, and dif∣fuse their venom, for the most part, through its motions and inclinations.</P>
<P>But to enter into a regular defence of this noble Author is not the present design. M. De Voltaire indeed has not scrupled to assert, that these Maxims contributed more than any other work to form the taste of the French nation, and give it a true relish for propriety and correctness. "Though," says he, <Q>there is but one truth running through the whole piece, namely, that self-love is the spring of all our actions and determinations; yet this thought presents itself under such a variety of forms, as never fail to strike with new surprize. This little collec∣tion
<PB N="9" REF="015864_0007_0F9A316379C70FB8"/>was much read and admired; it accustomed our authors to think, and to comprize their thoughts in a lively, correct, and delicate turn of phrase; which was a merit utterly unknown to any European writer before him, since the revival of letters. His Memoirs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem d'Anne d'Autriche.</NOTE> are still read, and his Maxims <HI>are known by heart.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Slecle de Louis XIV.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>In the Earl of Chesterfield's Letters, lately published, we frequently view his Lordship both as an admirer and defender of our Author. <Q>La Rochefoucault is, I know, blamed,</Q> says his Lordship, <Q>but, I think, without reason, for deriv∣ing all our actions from the source of self-love. For my own part, I see a great deal of truth, and no harm at all, in that opinion. It is sufficient that we seek our own happiness in every thing we do; and it is as certain that we can only find it in doing well, and in con∣forming all our actions to the rule of right reason, which is the great law of
<PB N="10" REF="015864_0008_0F9A31648291B318"/>Nature. It is only a mistaken self-love that is a blameable motive, when we take the immediate and indiscriminate gratification of a passion, or appetite, for real happiness. But am I blameable, if I do a good action upon account of the happiness which that honest conscious∣ness will give me? Surely not. On the contrary, that pleasing consciousness is a proof of my virtue, &amp;c. &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> 129.</NOTE></Q>—Again, <Q>Read in the morning some of La Roch∣efoucault's Maxims; consider them, examine them well, and compare them with the real characters you meet in the evening.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> 225.</NOTE></Q>—<Q>Till you come to know mankind by your own experience, I know no thing, nor no man, that can, in the mean time, bring you so well ac∣quainted with them as Le Duc de la Rochefoucault. His little Book of Maxims, which I would advise you to look into, for some moments at least, every day of your life, is, I fear, too like and too exact a picture of Human Na∣ture. I own, it seems to degrade it,
<PB N="11" REF="015864_0009_0F9A3164DE20C8A8"/>but yet my experience does not con∣vince me that it degrades it unjustly.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chesterfield's Letters</HI> 273.</NOTE></Q></P>

<HEAD>ABILITY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE desire of appearing to be persons of ability often prevents our being so.</P>
<P N="2">II. Some weak people are so sensible of their weakness, as to be able to make a good use of it.</P>
<P N="3">III. The height of ability consists in a thorough knowledge of the <HI>real</HI> value of things, and of the <HI>genius</HI> of the age we live in.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s says of Seneca, <Q>amoenum illi ingenium, &amp; <HI>temporis illius auribus accommodatum.</HI></Q> He had a pleasing genius, which was well-adapted to the times he lived in. M. <HI>Amelot de la Houssaye.</HI>
<P>Most of the authors immortalized by their cotemporaries have been indebted to this knowledge; or else to the good fortune of living in an age with whose turn their abilities coincided. The Augustan age, fond of their new acquain∣tance the Greek writers, advanced to the pinnacle of fame all such Romans as imitated them tolerably well. Hence the undeserved reputation of some of the author, of that period. Among ourselves, the last age considered Poetry as compre∣hensive of all qualifications, even those of ambassadors and secretaries of slate. The present, on the contrary, thinks it scarce worth a reading.</P></NOTE></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="015864_0011_0F9A31665CB8CC68"/>
IV. It requires no small degree of abi∣lity to know when to conceal it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Unus ex legatis (Helvetiorum) Claudius Cossus, notae facundiae sed <HI>dicendi artem apta trepidatione oc∣cultans, atque eo validior,</HI> militis animum mitigavit.</Q>

<BIBL><HI>Houssaye.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="5">V. Few men are able to know all the ill they do.</P>
<P N="6">VI. There are some affairs, and distem∣pers, which ill-timed remedies make worse; and great ability is requisite to know when it is dangerous to apply them.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">"Felix <HI>intempestivis remediis</HI> delicta accendebat."

<BIBL>Tac. A. <HI>iii.</HI></BIBL>
<P>There are inveterate aisorders, which it is more prudent to connive at, than to manifest our impotence by a vain attempt to suppress, <Q>Nocuit (Galba) anti∣quus rigor &amp; nimia severitas cui jam <HI>pares non sumus.</HI></Q></P>

</DIV2>

<HEAD>ACCIDENTS.</HEAD>
<P N="8">VIII. No accidents are so unlucky, but that the prudent may draw some ad∣vantage from them: nor are there any so lucky, but what the imprudent may turn to their prejudice.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>ACTIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="10">X. Great actions, the lustre of which dazzles us, are represented by politicians as the effects of deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whereas they are commonly the effects of caprice and passion. Thus th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> between Augustus and Antony, supposed to be owing to their ambition to give a master
<PB N="16" REF="015864_0013_0F9A316B157A90D0"/>to the world, arose probably from jea∣lousy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Inter Caepionem &amp; Drusum ex <HI>annulo</HI> in auction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> venali inimicitiae coepere, unde origo Socialis Belli.</Q>—
<BIBL>Plin. <HI>l. xxxiii. c. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Pliny the Historian says, that the Social War had its rise from a private quarrel between Livius Drusus and Caepio about a ring under sale, for which they bid against one another.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Houssaye.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="11">XI. Men may boast of their great ac∣tions; but they are oftener the effect of chance, than of design.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Our actions may seem to be un∣der the influence of good or bad stars, to which they owe the praise or blame they meet with.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A thousand superstitions of this sort were furnished by the religion of the Pagans, which served to raise their hopes as well as fears.</NOTE></P>
<P N="13">XIII. How brilliant soever an action may be, it ought not to pass for <HI>great</HI> when it is not the effect of great design.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. A certain proportion should be observed between our designs and actions, if we would reap from them the advan∣tage they might produce.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Our actions are like the jingle
<PB N="17" REF="015864_0014_0F9A316C0D141178"/>of rhime, which every one repeats in his own manner.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. We should often be ashamed of our best actions, if the world were wit∣ness to the motives which produce them.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. To praise great actions with sincerity, may be said to be taking part in them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>ADVICE.</HEAD>
<P N="18">XVIII. There is nothing of which we are so liberal as of advice.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. Nothing is less sincere than our manner of asking and of giving advice. He who asks advice would seem to have a respectful deference for the opinion of his friend; whilst yet he only aims at getting his own approved of, and his friend re∣sponsible for his conduct. On the other hand, he who gives it, repays the confi∣dence supposed to be placed in him by a seemingly disinterested zeal, whilst he sel∣dom means any thing by the advice he gives but his own interest or reputation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Shaftesbury, in his Soliloquy, says, <Q>No one was ever the better for advice: for that in general what we called giving advice, was properly taking an occasion to shew our own wisdom at another's expence; and to receive advice, was little better than tamely to afford another the occasion of raising himself a character from our defects.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P N="20"><PB N="18" REF="015864_0015_0F9A316C6A0D6568"/>
XX. There is near as much ability requisite to know how to make use of good advice, as to know how to act for one's self.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. We may give advice; but we cannot give conduct.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>AFFECTATION.</HEAD>
<P N="22">XXII. We are never made so ridicu∣lous by the qualities we have, as by those we affect to have.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. We had better appear to be what we are, than affect to appear what we are not.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>AFFLICTION.</HEAD>
<P N="24">XXIV. Whatever we may pretend, interest and vanity are the usual sources of our afflictions.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. There are in affliction several kinds of hypocrisy. Under the pretence
<PB N="19" REF="015864_0016_0F9A316D4B7CEB00"/>of weeping for the loss of one who was dear to us, we weep for ourselves: we weep over the diminution of our fortune, of our pleasure, of our importance. Thus have the dead the honour of tears which stream only for the living. I call this a sort of hypocrisy, because we impose on ourselves. There is another hypocrisy, which is less innocent, because it imposes on the world. This is the affliction of such as aspire to the glory of a great and immortal sorrow: when time, which con∣sumes all things, has worn out the grief which they really had, they still persist in their tears, lamentations, and sighs. They assume a mournful behaviour; and labour, by all their actions, to demonstrate that their affliction will not in the least abate till death. This disagreeable, this troublesome vanity is common among am∣bitious women. As the sex bars all the paths to glory, they endeavour to render themselves celebrated by the ostentation of an inconsolable affliction. There is yet another species of tears, whose shallow springs easily overflow, and as easily day
<PB N="20" REF="015864_0017_0F9A316DDD4FFB88"/>away: we weep, to acquire the reputation of being tender; we weep, in order to be pitied; we weep, that we may be wept over; we even weep, to avoid the scandal of not weeping.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. We sometimes lose friends whom we regret more than we grieve for; and others for whom we grieve, yet do not regret.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Most women lament not the death of their lovers so much out of real affection, as because they would appear to be the more worthy of having been beloved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>AGE.</HEAD>
<P N="28">XXVIII. Most people, as they ap∣proach old age, show in what manner their body and mind will decay.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To a skilful observer, the future desects of a man's mind and body may sometimes be visible from the time he is adult: us a good mechanic, from the accurate inspection of a ma∣chine, may perhaps predict where it will decay.</NOTE></P>
<P N="29">XXIX. We arrive novices at the dif∣ferent ages of life; and want experience,
<PB N="21" REF="015864_0018_0F9A317141E11828"/>though we have had many years to gain it.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Age does not necessarily confer experience; nor does even precept; nor any thing but an inter course and acquaintance with things. And we frequently see those who have want∣ed opportunities to indulge their juvenile passions in youth, go preposterous lengths in old age, with all the symptoms of youth except ability.</NOTE></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>AGREEABLENESS.</HEAD>
<P N="30">XXX. We judge so superficially of things, that common words and actions, spoke and done in an agreeable manner, with some knowledge of what passes in the world, often succeed beyond the greatest ability.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How often have I seen the most solid merit and know∣ledge neglected, unwelcome, and even rejected; while flimsy parts, little knowledge, and less merit, introduced by the Graces, have been received, cherished, and admired!
<BIBL>Ld. Chesterfield's Letters <HI>(136th.)</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="31">XXXI. We may say of agreeableness, as distinct from beauty, that it is a symme∣try whose rules are unknown; it is a secret conformity of the feat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es to one another, to the complexion, to the carriage.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="015864_0019_0F9A317284827310"/>
<HEAD>AMBITION.</HEAD>
<P N="32">XXXII. The ambitious deceive them∣selves in proposing an end to their ambiti∣on; for that end, when attained, becomes a means.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. When great men suffer themselves to be subdued by the length of their misfortunes, they discover that the strength of their ambition, not of their understanding, was that which sup∣ported them. They discover too, that, allowing for a little vanity, heroes are just like other men.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. The greatest ambition en∣tirely conceals itself, when it finds that what it aspired to is unattainable.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. What seems to be generosity is often no more than disguised ambition; which overlooks little interests, in order to gratify great ones.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. Moderation must not claim the merit of combating and conquering ambition; for they can never exist in the same subject. Moderation is the languor
<PB N="23" REF="015864_0020_0F9A3173754A45E0"/>and sloth of the soul; ambition its activity and ardour.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. We pass often from love to ambition: but we seldom return from ambition to love.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="maxims">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Those who apply them∣selves too much to little things, common∣ly become incapable of great ones.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. Few things are impractica∣ble in themselves; and it is for want of application, rather than of means, that men fail of success.</P>

<P N="42">XLII. Avarice is more opposite to oeconomy than liberality.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. Extreme avarice almost always makes mistakes. There is no passion that oftener misses its aim; nor on which the present has so much influence, in preju∣dice of the future.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. Avarice often produces con∣trary effects. There are many people who sacrifice their whole fortunes to du∣bious and distant expectations; there are others who contemn great future for little present advantages.</P>

<HEAD>BENEFITS.</HEAD>
<P N="45">XLV. We like better to see those on whom we confer benefits, than those from whom we receive them.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. Men are not only apt to for∣get benefits and injuries; but even to hate those who have obliged them, and to cease to hate those who have injured them. The very attention to requite kindnesses, and revenge wrongs, seems to be an insupportable slavery.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>To have received from one greater benefits than there is hope to requite, disposeth to counterfeit love, but really to secret hatred; and puts a man into the estate of a des∣perate debtor, who, in declining the sight of his creditor, tacitly wisheth him there where be might never see him more.

At the death of Lucretia, Brutus, happening to be present, threw off the mask: be drew the potgnard reeking from her wound and lifting it up towards beaven: "Be witness, ye Gods," be cried, <Q>that from this moment I proclaim myself the aven∣ger of the chaste Lucretia's death; from this moment I profess myself the enemy of Tarquin.</Q>—An amazement seized the bearers!—In the sequel, Tarquin was expelled, and Brutus was proclaimed Deliverer of the people.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>DEATH.</HEAD>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. Few people are well ac∣quainted with Death. It is generally submitted to through stupidity and cus∣tom, not resolution: most mer die mere∣ly because they cannot help it.</P>
<P N="87">LXXXVII. Death and the sun are not to be looked at steadily.</P>
<P N="88">LXXXVIII. After having spoken of the falsity of seeming virtues, it is proper to say something about the falsity of the contempt of death: I mean that contempt
<PB N="36" REF="015864_0033_0F9A318261612A80"/>of death which the heathens boasted to derive from their natural strength, unsup∣ported by the hopes of a better life. There is a wide difference between suffer∣ing death courageously, and contemning it: the one is common enough; but the other, I believe, never sincere. Every thing has been written that can persuade us that death is no evil; and some of the weakest as well as the greatest of men have given celebrated examples in con∣firmation of this tenet. Yet I doubt whether any person of good sense ever be∣lieved it; and the pains we take to per∣suade ourselves and others of it plainly e∣vince that it is no easy task. A man may, for many reasons, be disgusted with life; but he can have no reason for contemning death. Even suicides esteem it no slight matter, and are as much startled at it, and decline it as much as other people, when it comes in any other shape except that which they have chosen. The remarka∣ble inequality in the courage of many va∣liant men proceeds from death's appearing differently to their imaginations, and
<PB N="37" REF="015864_0034_0F9A3182E4E1C9A8"/>seeming more instant at one time than a∣nother. By this means it happens, that, after having contemned what they did not know, they are at last afraid of what they do know. We must avoid considering death in all its circumstances, if we would not think it the greatest of all ills. The wisest and bravest are those who make the best pretences for not considering it at all: for every one that views it in its proper light will find it sufficiently terrible. The necessity of dying made the whole of phi∣losophic fortitude. The philosophers thought it best to do that with a good grace which was not to be avoided; and, being unable to make themselves immor∣tal, they did all they could to immortalize their reputations, and save what they might out of the general wreck. To be able to put a good face on the matter, let us by no means discover even to ourselves all we think about it; let us trust rather to constitution, than to those vain reason∣ings which make us believe we can ap∣proach death with indifference. The glory of dying resolutely, the hopes of be∣ing
<PB N="38" REF="015864_0035_0F9A31839E61AA08"/>regretted, the desire of leaving a fair reputation, the assurance of being deliver∣ed from the miseries of life, and freed from the caprice of fortune, are alleviat∣ing reflections, not to be rejected: but we must by no means imagine them infalli∣ble. These serve indeed to embolden us, just as in war a poor hedge emboldens the soldiers to approach an incessant fir∣ing. At a distance, they view it as a shelter; when they come up, they find it but a sorry defence. We flatter ourselves too much, in fancying that death, when near, will appear what we judged it to be when distant; and that our opinions, which are weakness itself, will be firm e∣nough not to give way on this severest of trials. We must be also but ill-acquain∣ted with the effects of self-love, to ima∣gine that <HI>that</HI> will permit us to think lightly of an action which must necessarily be its destruction. Reason, from whom we expect mighty assistance, is too feeble, on this occasion, to make us believe what we wish to find true. It is she, on the contrary, who betrays us; and, instead of
<PB N="39" REF="015864_0036_0F9A3185624BD0D0"/>inspiring a contempt of death, helps only to discover its horrors. Indeed all she can do for us is, to advise us to avert our eyes, and six them on some other object. Cato and Brutus chose noble ones. A footman, some time since, amused himself with dancing upon the scaffold he was going to be broken on. Thus different motives sometimes produce the same ef∣fect. And so true it is, that whatever dis∣proportion there may be between the great and the vulgar, we often see them meet death with the same countenance: but there is always this difference, that the contempt of death shewn by heroes is owing to their love of glory, which hides it from their sight; and in common peo∣ple it proceeds merely from their want of sensibility, which prevents their being a∣ware of the greatness of the evil, and leaves them at liberty to think of some∣thing else.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The contempt of death has been always very justly ac∣counted a virtue of the first class. Virgil makes it (as it truly is) essential to the character of a happy man: <Q>Quique metus omnes, &amp; inexorabile fatum, Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.</Q>
<P>He must be superior to every fear; even that of death, and its consequences.—The fear of death is peculiar to man; and may perhaps be a necessary instinct to counterbalance rea∣son, which might else, too frequently, prompt him to quit his post: according to that noble thought of Lucan, <Q>Victurosque dei celant, ut vivere durent, Felix esse mori.</Q></P>
<P>The Gods cenceal from men the happiness of death that they may endure life.—And though we find this instinct operates sufficiently in men, when under no immediate pres∣sure; yet we may also observe that it is surmountable by the exertion of every passion, even in the weakest and most timid people; of this the numberless examples we continually see will not admit a doubt. Nor is there wanting, among the few philosophic men who have been superior to instinct, in∣stances of such as have given <HI>the irrefutable demonstration, the irrevocable fact,</HI> in confirmation of their rational sorti∣tude, and sincere contempt of the bugbear death; which, without passion's aid, they have encountered, with <HI>unaver∣ted eyes,</HI> and <HI>undiverted attention.</HI> Nerva's death is thus related by Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itus: <Q>Cocceius Nerva, continuus prin∣cipis, omnis divini humanique juris sciens. integro statu, corpore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so, mortendi consilium cepit.

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P N="166">CLXVI. What is commonly called friendship is no more than a partnership; a reciprocal regard for one another's in∣terests, and an exchange of good offices; in a word, a mere traffic, wherein self-love always proposes to be a gainer.</P>
<P N="167">CLXVII. Though most of the friend∣ships of the world ill deserve the name of friendships; yet a man may make use of them occasionally, as of a traffic whose returns are uncertain, and in which it is usual to be cheated.</P>
<P N="168">CLXVIII. In the distress of our best friends we always find something that does not displease us.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This maxim gave occasion to the celebrated <HI>Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift.</HI> The introductory lines of the poem give the Dean's opinion of our author, and a poetical version of the maxim. They are as follow:
<Q><L>As Rochefoucault his maxims drew</L>
<L>From nature, I believe them true:</L>
<L>They argue no corrupted mind</L>
<L>In him: the fault is in mankind.</L>
<L>This maxim, more than all the rest</L>
<L>Is thought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> base for human breast:</L>
<L>"In all distresses of our friends,</L>
<L>"We first consult our private ends;</L>

<P N="169"><PB N="56" REF="015864_0053_0F9A319D42CB1680"/>
CLXIX. The reason we are so change∣able in our friendships is, that it is diffi∣cult to know the qualities of the heart, and easy to know those of the head.</P>
<P N="170">CLXX. We love nothing but on our own account, and only follow our taste and inclination when we prefer our friends to ourselves; and yet it is this preference that alone constitutes true and perfect friendship.</P>
<P N="171">CLXXI. It is more dishonourable to distrust a friend, than to be deceived by him.</P>
<P N="172">CLXXII. We often imagine we love men in power; but interest alone is the true reason of our friendship for them: we espouse not their party to do them good, but from their hands to receive good.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Fatebor &amp; fuisse me Sejano amicum, &amp; ut essem ex∣petisse. —Ut quisque Sejano intimus, ita ad Caesaris ami∣citiam validus.</Q>

CLXXIII. Self-love magnifies, or di∣minishes, the good qualities of our friends, in proportion to the satisfaction we take in them; and we judge of their merit by the terms they keep with us.</P>
<P N="174">CLXXIV. We sometimes lightly com∣plain of our friends, to be beforehand in justifying our own levity.</P>
<P N="175">CLXXV. We are not much afflicted at the misfortunes of our friends, when they give us an opportunity of signalizing our affection for them.</P>
<P N="176">CLXXVI. We are fond of exaggera∣ting the love our friends bear us; but it is often less from a principle of gratitude, than the desire of prejudicing people in favour of our own merit.</P>

Self-love makes men idolize themselves, and tyrannize over others, when Fortune gives the means.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Self-love.] Self-love is the spring of all animal action. It is implanted by Nature in animals with a twofold view; the good of the individual, and that of the species: and ope∣rates on them by a twofold impulse; an insupportable unea∣siness attendant on its suppression, and a pleasurable sensation annexed to its gratification. In brutes, this motive to action, being under the sole direction of instinct, is in general uniform and evident, In man, instinct has been superadded to reason, and self-love becomes complex and mysierious. It is plain, from fact, that all animals are in some degree social; some of them (if we may so speak) living under monarchal, some oligarchal, others democratical, and the rest patriarchal go∣vernment. The stifling, or exerting, the principle that thus unites them, has always its concomitant pain or pleasure. And instinct, where she is sole governess, impells them un∣variably and unerringly to Nature's end and their own good; which are always united, though not always absolutely the same. For example, animals eat to appease their bunger, or please their palate; they have no more view to sustenance than the sexes, in their intercourse, have to propagation. Men, too, so far as they act under instinct, act unerringly; when that leaves them, they have recourse to reason; which not being at all times, nor in all persons, equally right and strong, does not always prompt to what is equally true and just. Society is undoubtedly the interest of all mankind; and though an universal government has never yet been, nor most probably ever will be formed, yet the wants of every man make him confederate with, and join himself to, some particular public. Now, as in order to the establishment of a state it is indispensably necessary to supersede some private rights, which are indeed compensated reflectively, though in a less obvious manner, this seems to produce cases wherein the good of the government and that of the subject clash. And certainly there are occasionally instances where the ne∣cessities of the commonwealth bear so bard on particular members as would give them a distaste to society, did not the uniting principle, the love of the species, the affection for the community of which they are part, lighten the oppression, still the grievance, and, by benevolent reflection, even ren∣der it pleasureable. To actions deduced from this source, the self-love of the rest of the Community (which reaps the benefit of these seeming self-sacrifices) ascribes extraordinary merit, annexes attendant glory, and calls them virtuous: which virtue, though, relatively to the kind, it be highly meritorious, is yet not disinterested, because repaid by the reflex pleasure of the actor: and may also be carried so far as to become irrational and vicious; for 'to be vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous," says Lord Shaftesbury, vol. <HI>II.</HI> p 77, <Q>is to have one's affections right in respect to one's self as well as of society.</Q> So that virtue will be found to be, not a ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterested bene∣volence toward the species, but a love of that kind which is its own reward; not a boundless enthusiasm for the public, but the social affection conducted by reason.

From the night that envelopes him springs the ridi∣culous notions he entertains of himself: thence his errors, his ignorance, his gross and filly mistakes with respect to himself. Thence is it that he imagines his sensati∣ons dead, when they are only asleep, that he shall never desire to run again when once tired; and that he has lost all the appetites he has sated. But this thick darkness, which hides him from himself, hinders him not from seeing perfectly well whatever is without him; in which he resembles the eye, that sees all things except itself. In his great concerns and important affairs, where the violence of desire summoneth his whole attention, he sees, perceives, understands, invents, sus∣pects, penetrates, and divines all things; so that one would be tempted to believe that

No∣thing is so close and strong as his attach∣ments; which he in vain attempts to break through on discovery of the greatest impending misery. Yet sometimes, in a short time, he effects, and without trou∣ble, what he had not been able to com∣pass with the greatest efforts, for years. Whence may well be concluded, that it is by himself that his desires are inflamed, more than by the beauty and merit of their objects; that it is his taste that heightens and embellishes them; that it is himself that he pursues; and that he fol∣lows his inclination, when he follows things that are agreeable to his inclination. He is composed of contrarieties; imperious and obedient, sincere and hypocritical, merciful and cruel, timid and bold. He has different inclinations, according to the different tempers that possess and devote him sometimes to glory, sometimes to wealth, sometimes to pleasure. These he changes, as age and experience alter: and it is indifferent to him whether he has many inclinations, or only one; because
<PB N="109" REF="015864_0106_0F9A3067104924C8"/>he can split himself into many, or collect himself into one, as it is convenient or a∣greeable to him. He is inconstant; and the changes, besides those that happen from external causes, are numberless which proceed from himself. He is in∣constant through levity, through love, through novelty, through satiety, through disgust, through inconstancy itself. He is capricious; and sometimes labours with eagerness and incredible pains to obtain things that are no ways advantageous, nay even hurtful; but which he pursues mere∣ly because it is his will. He is whimsical, and often exerts his whole application in employments the most trifling; takes the utmost delight in the most insipid, and preserves all his haughtiness in the most contemptible. He is attendant on all ages and conditions; he lives every where; he lives on every thing; he lives on nothing. He makes himself easy either in the enjoy∣ment, or privation, of things; he even goes over to those who are at variance with him; he enters into their schemes, and, which is wonderful! along with
<PB N="110" REF="015864_0107_0F9A3067CFEE7208"/>them hates himself; he conspires his own destruction; he labours to undo himself; he only desires to BE; and, that granted, he consents to be his own enemy. We are not therefore to be surprized if he sometimes closes with the most rigid au∣sterity; and enters boldly into a combina∣tion therewith to ruin himself; because what he loses in one place he regains in another. When we think he relinquishes his pleasures, he but suspends, or changes them; and even when he is discomfited, and we think we are rid of him, we find him triumphant in his own defeat. Such is self-love! of which man's life is only a long and great agitation. The sea is its representative; in the flux and reflux of whose waves, self-love may find a lively expression of the turbulent succession of its thoughts, and of its eternal motion.</P>

There are those who expose themselves boldly at the be∣ginning of an action; and who slacken and are disheartened at its duration. There are others who aim only at preserving their honour, and do little more. Some are not equally exempt from fear at all times alike. Others give occasionally in∣to a general panic: others advance to the charge because they dare not stay in their posts. There are men whom habitual small dangers encourage, and fit for great∣er. Some are brave with the sword, and fear bullets: others desy bullets, and dread a sword. All these different kinds of valour agree in this, that night, as it augments fear, so it conceals good or bad actions, and gives every one the opportu∣nity

<P>It is difficult to say whether our author or Lord Chester∣field has been hardest upon the sex. His Lordship however (among other douceurs) acknowledges, that <Q>women are the only refiners of the merit of men; that it is true they cannot add weight, but they polish and give a lustre to it; that they absolutely stamp every man's character in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> and make it either current, or cry it down, and stop it in payments.</Q></P>

<P>PHILOSOPHICAL, and POLITICAL STRICTURES, on the good and bad EFFECTS of NATIONAL PRIDE: Translated from the German of Mr. ZIMMERMAN, Physician in ordinary to his Britannic Majesty at Hanover.</P>
<P>EXTRACT from the PREFACE by the English TRANSLATOR.</P>
<Q><P>THIS <HI>production bears so much the stamp of truth, freedom and virtue, that it is sur∣prising a work of such character has not yet been translated into Eng∣lish, and laid before a nation ne∣ver wanting to countenance merit, wherever met with. The author is a</HI> SWISS, <HI>and writes with the freedom becoming a virtuous man, born in a country from whence li∣berty, virtue, truth and simplicity, have not yet been expelled by op∣pression, vice, flattery and luxury. The applause of his own country and of Germany has rendered four large impressions necessary; to the last of which the author made im∣portant additions. The French, a people not easily pleasea in works of this nature, have read this per∣formance, translated into their lan∣guage, with distinguished appro∣bation; and some of their capital writers have bestowed large enco∣miums upon it</HI></P>
<P><HI>Impartial judges will, on peru∣sal of this work, find it to abound with sterling sense and judicious sentiments; and although it may possibly appear to disadvantage in the translation, there will however still remain some of the masterly strokes of our author, however weakened through the transfusion of his original ideas into English expressions</HI></P>
<P><HI>But what gives us the best grounded hopes of the success of this publication is derived from our au∣ther's aim to combat prejudice, and to promote the cause of liberty and virtue, which have always found the most numerous and most zealous friends in the thinking part of this great and wealthy nation.</HI></P></Q>

<P>An ESSAY ON CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS: Written by the MARQUIS BECCARIA, of MILAN.</P>
<P>With a COMMENTARY, Attributed to Monsieur De VOLTAIRE.</P>
<P>EXTRACT from the PREFACE of the TRANSLATOR.</P>
<Q><HI>PENAL</HI> laws, so considerable a part of every system of legisla∣tion, and of so great importance to the happiness, peace and security of every member of society, are still so imperfect, and are attended with so many unnecessary circum∣stances of cruelty in all nations, that an attempt to reduce them to the standard of reason must be in∣teresting to all mankind. It is not surprising, then, that this little book hath engaged the attention of all ranks of people in every part of Europe. It is now about eighteen months since the first publication; in which time it hath passed no less than six editions in the origi∣nal language; the third of which was printed within six months af∣ter its first appearance. It hath been translated into French; that translation hath also been several times reprinted, and perhaps no book on any subject was ever recei∣ved with more avidity, more ge∣nerally read, or more universally applauded.</Q>
<P>N. B. At Bell's Book-Store may also be had, great variety of Books in all arts, sciences, and lan∣guages; especially Greek, Latin, French, and Eng∣lish classics, Bibles of various kinds, likewise the very best French and English Dictionaries.</P>
