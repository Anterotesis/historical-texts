<HEAD>A Constitution or Form of Go∣vernment for the Common∣wealth of MASSACHUSETTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="preamble">
<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of the institution, maintenance and ad∣ministration of government, is to secure the exist∣ence of the body-politic; to protect it; and to furnish the individuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying, in safety and tranquility, their natural rights, and the blessings of life: And whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the govern∣ment, and to take measures necessary for their safety, pros∣perity and happiness.</P>
<P>THE body-politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals: It is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, there∣fore, in framing a Constitution of Government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his security in them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016845_0004_0F9EBEC5B8BFB5C0"/>WE, therefore, the people of Massachusetts, acknow∣ledging, with grateful hearts, the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording us, in the course of His Providence, an opportunity, deliberately and peace∣ably, without fraud, violence or surprize, of entering into an original, explicit, and solemn compact with each other; and of forming a new Constitution of Civil Government, for ourselves and posterity; and devoutly imploring His direction in so interesting a design, DO agree upon, or∣dain and establish, the following <HI>Declaration of Rights, and Frame of Government,</HI> as the CONSTITUTION of the COMMONWEALTH of MASSACHUSETTS.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="7" REF="016845_0005_0F9EBEC6794B7330"/>
<HEAD>PART THE FIRST. A DECLARATION of the RIGHTS of the Inhabitants of the Common∣wealth of MASSACHUSETTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. I.</NOTE>ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain natural essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, pos∣sessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is the right as well as the duty of all men in so∣ciety, publicly, and at stated seasons, to worship the SU∣PREME BEING, the great creator and preserver of the universe. And no subject shall be hurt, molested, or re∣strained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshiping GOD in the manner and season most agreeable to the dic∣tates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession or sentiments; provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship.</P>
<P N="3">III. As the happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially depend upon piety, religion and morality; and as these cannot be generally diffused through a community, but by the insti∣tution of the public worship of GOD, and of public in∣structions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote their happiness, and to secure the good order and preservation of their government, the people of this Com∣monwealth have a right to invest their legislature with power to authorize and require, and the legislature shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several towns, parishes, precincts and other bodies politic, or reli∣gious societies, to make suitable provision, at their own ex∣pence, for the institution of the public worship of GOD,
<PB N="8" REF="016845_0006_0F9EBEC78E1D1D08"/>
and for the support and maintenance of public protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality, in all cases where such provision shall not be made voluntarily.</P>
<P>AND the people of this Commonwealth have also a right to, and do, invest their legislature with authority to enjoin upon all the subjects an attendance upon the instruc∣tions of the public teachers aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any on whose instructions they can con∣scienciously and conveniently attend.</P>
<P>PROVIDED notwithstanding, that the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious societies, shall, at all times, have the exclusive right of elec∣ting their public teachers, and of contracting with them for their support and maintenance</P>
<P>AND all monies paid by the subject to the support of public worship, and of the public teachers aforesaid, shall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the support of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious sect or de∣nomination, provided there be any on whose instructions he attends; otherwise it may be paid towards the sup∣port of the teacher or teachers of the parish or precinct in which the said monies are raised.</P>
<P>AND every denomination of christians, demeaning themselves peaceably, and as good subjects of the Com∣monwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law: And no subordination of any one sect or denomina∣tion to another shall ever be established by law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE people of this Commonwealth have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free, so∣vereign, and independent state; and do, and forever here∣after shall, exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expresly delegated to the United States of America in Congress assembled.</P>
<P N="5">V. ALL power residing originally in the people, and being derived from them, the several magistrates and offi∣cers
<PB N="9" REF="016845_0007_0F9EBEC7FB14B9B0"/>
of government, vested with authority, whether legis∣lative, executive, or judicial, are their substitutes and a∣gents, and are at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. NO man, nor corporation, or association of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and exclusive privileges, distinct from those of the com∣munity, than what arises from the consideration of services rendered to the public; and this title being in nature nei∣ther hereditary, nor transmissible to children, or descendents, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a magistrate, lawgiver, or judge, is absurd and unnatural.</P>
<P N="7">VII. GOVERNMENT is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity and happiness of the people; and not for the profit, honor, or private interest of any one man, family or class of men: Therefore the people alone have an incontestible, unalienable, and inde∣feasible tight to institute government; and to reform, alter, or totally charge the same, when their protection, safety, prosperity and happiness require it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. IN order to prevent those, who are vested with authority, from becoming oppressors, the people have a right, at such periods and in such manner as they shall esta∣blish by their frame of government, to cause the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant pla∣ces by certain and regular elections and appointments.</P>
<P N="9">IX. ALL elections ought to be free and all the inhabi∣tants of this Commonwealth, having such qualifications as they shall establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected, for public employments.</P>
<P N="10">X EACH individual of the society has a right to be pro∣tected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and proper∣ty, according to standing laws. He is obliged, consequent∣ly, to contribute his share to the expence of this protecti∣on; to give his personal service, or an equivalent, when necessary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, with justice, be taken from him, or applied to public
<PB N="10" REF="016845_0008_0F9EBEC9758176C8"/>
uses, without his own consent, or that of the representative body of the people: In fine, the people of this Common∣wealth are not controulable by any other laws, than those to which their constitutional representative body have given their consent. And whenever the public exigencies require, that the property of any individual should be appropriated to public uses, he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor.</P>
<P N="11">XI. EVERY subject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in his person, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and jus∣tice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it; com∣pleatly, and without any denial; promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="12">XII. NO subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself. And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa∣vourable to him; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by himself, or his council, at his election. And no subject shall be arrest∣ed, imprisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his property, im∣munities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P>AND the legislature shall not make any law, that shall subject any person to a capital or infamous punishment, ex∣cepting for the government of the army and navy, without trial by jury.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. IN criminal prosecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greatest securities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. EVERY subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his hou∣ses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, there∣fore,
<PB N="11" REF="016845_0009_0F9EBECCADDE85F0"/>
are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmati∣on; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accom∣panied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be is∣sued but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.</P>
<P N="15">XV. IN all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practiced, the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this me∣thod of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in causes ari∣sing on the high-seas, and such as relate to mariners wagers, the legislature shall hereafter find it necessary to alter it.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THE liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom in a state: it ought not, therefore, to be re∣strained in this Commonwealth.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. THE people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be main∣tained without the consent of the legislature; and the mi∣litary power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority and be governed by it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A FREQUENT recurrence to the fundamental principles of the constitution, and a constant adherence to those of piety, justice, moderation, temperance, industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary to preserve the ad∣vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government: The people ought, consequently, to have a particular at∣tention to all those principles, in the choice of their officers and representatives: And they have a right to require of their law-givers and magistrates, an exact and constant ob∣servance of them, in the formation and execution of the laws necessary for the good administration of the Common∣wealth.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="12" REF="016845_0010_0F9EBECD86F2EE40"/>XIX. THE people have a right, in an orderly and peace∣able manner, to assemble to consult upon the common good: give instructions to their representatives; and to request of the legislative body, by the way of addresses, petitions, or remonstrances, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they suffer.</P>
<P N="20">XX. THE power of suspending the laws, or the execu∣tion of the laws, ought never to be exercised but by the le∣gislature, or by authority derived from it, to be exercised in such particular cases only as the legislature shall expresly provide for.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. THE freedom of deliberation, speech and debate, in either house of the legislature, is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any ac∣cusation or prosecution, action or complaint, in any other court or place whatsoever.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. THE legislature ought frequently to assemble for the redress of grievances, for correcting, strengthening, and confirming the laws and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. NO subsidy, charge, tax, impost, or duties, ought to be established, fixed, laid, or levied under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people, or their re∣presentatives in the legislature.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. LAWS made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been declared crimes by proceding laws, are unjust, expressive, and in∣consistent with the fundamental principles of a free go∣vernment.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. NO subject ought, in any case, or in any time to be declared guilty of treason or felony by the legislature.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. NO magistrate or court of law, shall demand ex∣cessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. IN time of peace no soldier ought to be quar∣tered in any house without the consent of the owner; and in time of war such quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magistrate, in a manner ordeined by the legislature.</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="13" REF="016845_0011_0F9EBECE3B7DF718"/>XXVIII. NO person can in any case be subjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual service, but by authority of the legi∣slature.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. IT is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and administration of justice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit. It is therefore not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the supreme judi∣cial court should hold their offices as long as they behave themselves well; and that they should have honorable sa∣laries ascertained and established by standing laws.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. IN the government of this Commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or ei∣ther of them: The judicial shall never exercise the legis∣lative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.</P>

<HEAD>PART THE SECOND. The Frame of Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE people inhabiting the territory formerly called the Province of Massachusetts-Bay, do hereby so∣lemnly and mutually agree with each other, to form them∣selves into a free, sovereign, and independent body-politic or state, by the name of THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.</P>

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. The General Court.</HEAD>

<P N="2">II. NO bill or resolve of the Senate or House of Repre∣sentatives shall become a law, and have force as such, un∣til it shall have been laid before the Governor for his revi∣sal: And if he, upon such revision, approve thereof, he shall signify his approbation by signing the same. But if he have any objection to the passing of such bill or resolve, he shall return the same, together with his objections there∣to, in writing, to the Senate or House of Representatives, in which soever the same shall have originated; who shall enter the objections sent down by the Governor, at large, on their records, and proceed to reconsider the said bill or resolve: But if after such reconsideration, two thirds of the said Senate or House of Representatives, shall, not∣withstanding the said objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of the legislature, where it shall also be reconsider∣ed, and if approved by two thirds of the members present it shall have the force of a law: but in all such cases, the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays; and
<PB N="15" REF="016845_0013_0F9EBECFCD7D56B0"/>
the names of the persons voting for, or against, the said bill or resolve, shall be entered upon the public records of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>AND in order to prevent unnecessary delays, if any bill or resolve shall not be returned by the Governor within five days after it shall have been presented, the same shall have the force of a law.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE General Court shall forever have full power and authority to erect and constitute judicatories and courts of record, or other courts, to be held in the name of the Commonwealth, for the hearing, trying, and determining of all manner of crimes, offences, pleas, processes, plaints, actions, matters, causes and things, whatsoever, arising or happening within the Commonwealth, or between or con∣cerning persons inhabiting, or residing, or brought within the same; whether the same be criminal or civil, or whe∣ther the said crimes be capital or not capital, and whether the said pleas be real, personal, or mixt; and for the a∣warding and making out of execution thereupon: To which courts and judicatories are hereby given and grant∣ed full power and authority, from time to time, to admi∣nister oaths or affirmations, for the better discovery of truth in any matter in controversy or depending before them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. AND further, full power and authority are hereby given and granted to the said General Court, from time to time, to make, ordain, and establish, all manner of whole∣some and reasonable orders, laws, statutes, and ordinances, directions and instructions, either with penalties or without; so as the same be not repugnant or contrary to this Consti∣tution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of this Commonwealth, and for the government and or∣dering thereof, and of the subjects of the same, and for the necessary support and defence of the government thereof; and to name and settle annually, or provide by fixed laws, for the naming and settling all civil officers within the said Commonwealth; the election and constitution of whom
<PB N="16" REF="016845_0014_0F9EBED3469EF628"/>

<P>AND while the public charges of government, or any part thereof, shall be assessed on polls and estates in the manner that has hitherto been practiced; in order that such assessments may be made with equality, there shall be a va∣luation of estates within the Commonwealth taken anew once in every ten years at the least, and as much oftener as the General court shall order.</P>

<P N="2">II. THE Senate shall be the first branch of the legisla∣ture; and the Senators shall be chosen in the following manner, viz. There shall be a meeting on the first Mon∣day in April annually, forever, of the inhabitants of each town in the several counties of this Commonwealth; to be called by the Selectmen, and warned in due course of law, at least seven days before the first Monday in April, for the purpose of electing persons to be Senators and
<PB N="18" REF="016845_0016_0F9EBED4CC45CCC8"/>
Counsellors: And at such meetings every male inhabi∣tant of twenty-one years of age and upwards, having a freehold estate within the Commonwealth, of the annual income of three pounds, or any estate of the value of six∣ty pounds, shall have a right to give in his vote for the Senators for the district of which he is an inhabitant. And to remove all doubts concerning the meaning of the word "Inhabitant," in this Constitution, every person shall be considered as an inhabitant, for the purpose of electing and being elected into any office or place within this State, in that town, district or plantation, where he dwelleth, or hath his home.</P>
<P>THE Selectmen of the several towns shall preside at such meetings impartially; and shall receive the votes of all the inhabitants of such towns present and qualified to vote for Senators, and shall sort and count them in open town-meeting, and in presence of the Town-Clerk, who shall make a fair record, in presence of the Selectmen, and in open town-meeting, of the name of every person voted for, and of the number of votes against his name; and a fair copy of this record shall be attested by the Selectmen and the Town Clerk, and shall be sealed up, directed to the Secretary of the Commonwealth for the time being, with a superscription, expressing the purport of the con∣tents thereof, and delivered by the Town-Clerk of such towns, to the Sheriff of the county in which such town lies, thirty days at least before the last Wednesday in May annually; or it shall be delivered into the Secretary's of∣fice seventeen days at least before the said last Wednesday in May; and the Sheriff of each county shall deliver all such certificates by him received into the Secretary's office seventeen days before the said last Wednesday in May.</P>
<P>AND the inhabitants of plantations unincorporated, qualified as this Constitution provides, who are or shall be empowered and required to assess taxes upon themselves toward the support of government, shall have the same privilege of voting for Counsellors and Senators in the
<PB N="19" REF="016845_0017_0F9EBED587B91CA0"/>
plantations where they reside, as town inhabitants have in their respective towns; and the plantation meetings for that purpose shall be held annually on the same firs;t Mon∣day in April at such place in the plantations respectively, as the Assessors thereof shall direct; which Assessors shall have like authority for notifying the electors collecting and returning the votes, as the Selectmen and Town Clerks have in their several towns, by this Constitution. And all other persons living in places unincorporated (qualified as afore∣said) who shall be assessed to the support of government by the Assessors of an adjacent town, shall have the privi∣lege of giving in their votes for Counsellors and Senators, in the town where they shall be assessed, and be notified of the place of meeting by the Selectmen of the town where they shall be assessed, for that purpose accordingly.</P>
<P N="3">III. AND that there may be a due convention of Sena∣tors on the last Wednesday in May annually, the Gover∣nor, with five of the Council, for the time being, shall, as soon as may be, examine the returned copies of such re∣cords; and fourteen days before the said day he shall is∣sue his summons to such persons as shall appear to be cho∣sen by a majority of voters, to attend on that day, and take their seats accordingly: Provided nevertheless, that for the first year the said returned copies shall be exa∣mined by the President and five of the Council of the former Constitution of Government; and the said Presi∣dent shall, in like manner, issue his summons to the per∣sons so elected, that they may take their seats as afore∣said.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE Senate shall be the final judge of the electi∣ons, returns and qualifications of their own members, as pointed out in the Constitution; and shall, on the said last Wednesday in May annually, determine and declare who are elected by each district, to be Senators by a ma∣jority of votes: And in case there shall not appear to be the full number of Senators returned elected by a majority of votes for any district, the deficiency shall be supplied
<PB N="20" REF="016845_0018_0F9EBED64208A528"/>
in the following manner, viz The members of the House of Representatives, and such Senators as shall be declared elected, shall take the names of such persons as shall be found to have the highest number of votes in such district, and not elected, amounting to twice the number of Se∣nators wanting, if there be so many voted for; and out of these, shall elect by ballot a number of Senators suffi∣cient to fill up the vacancies in such district; and in this manner all such vacancies shall be filled up in every dis∣trict of the Commonwealth; and in like manner all va∣cancies in the Senate, arising by death, removal out of the State, or otherwise, shall be supplied as soon as may be, after such vacancies shall happen.</P>
<P N="5">V. PROVIDED nevertheless, that no person shall be ca∣pable of being elected as a Senator, who is not seized in his own right of a freehold within this Commonwealth, of the value of three hundred pounds at least, or possessed of personal estate to the value of six hundred pounds at least, or of both to the amount of the same sum, and who has not been an inhabitant of this Commonwealth for the space of five years immediately preceeding his election, and at the time of his election, he shall be an inhabitant in the district for which he shall be chosen.</P>
<P N="6">VI. THE Senate shall have power to adjourn them∣selves, provided such adjournments do not exceed two days at a time.</P>
<P N="7">VII. THE Senate shall choose its own President, ap∣point its own officers, and determine its own rules of pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. THE Senate shall be a court with full authority to hear and determine all impeachments made by the House of Representatives, against any officer or officers of the Commonwealth, for misconduct and mal-administra∣tion in their offices.
