<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOEL, III. 19, 20 and 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>EGYPT</HI> shall be a desolation, and <HI>EDOM</HI> shall be a de∣solate wilderness, for the violence against the chil∣dren of Judah, because they have shed INNO∣CENT BLOOD in their land. But <HI>Judah</HI> shall dwell for ever, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from generation to generation. For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed; for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEXT to the acknowledgement of the existence of a Deity, there is no one principle of greater importance in religion, than a realizing belief of the divine government and providence, as superintending the affairs of the universe, and in∣timately concerned in whatever happens to mankind, both as nations and kingdoms, and as individuals.</P>
<P>Deeply to be impressed with a sense of the divine providence, to realize that GOD is Govornor among the nations, that his government is wise and just, and that all our times and changes are in his hands, and at his disposal, will have the happiest tendency to excite the most grateful acknowledgements of his good∣ness in prosperity, the most cordial resignation to his paternal discipline in adversity, and the most placid composure and equanimity of mind in all the chang∣ing scenes of life. Inspired with this divine principle, we shall contemplate, with grateful wonder and de∣light,
<PB N="6" REF="043231_0004_101CD950BAD441C8"/>
the goodness of God in prosperous events, and devoutly acknowledge and adore his sovereign hand in days of darkness and perplexity, and when the greatest difficulties press. This will be a source of comfort and support under private afflictions and trials, and this shall encourage our hope in God and trust in his name, under public calamities and judgments.— Yea, however dark and mysterious the ways of pro∣vidence may appear; yet nothing shall overwhelm the mind, or destroy the trust and hope of those, that realize the government of heaven,—that realize, that an alwise God is seated on the throne, and that all things are well appointed for his chosen people,—for them that fear him.</P>
<P>This principle and these sentiments therefore, being of so great use and importance in religion, un∣der the various dispensations of providence, one great design of the present discourse, is to rouse and excite us to a religious acknowledgment of the hand of God, in those distressing scenes of MURDER, BLOOD∣SHED and WAR, we are met to commemorate, upon this solemn occasion</P>
<P>The passage before us, it is humbly conceived, is well suited to confirm our faith, to excite our trust, and encourage our hope, under such awful dispensa∣tions, as it points out the method of God's govern∣ment and the course of his providence towards the enemies and oppressors of his people, and the fate of those that shed <HI>innocent blood;</HI> and at the same time, represents his peculiar care of his church and chosen, and the assurance they have, when under oppression, of restoration and establishment,—and that <HI>God him∣self</HI> will plead their cause and both <HI>cleanse</HI> and <HI>avenge</HI> their <HI>innocent blood. "Egypt</HI> shall be a desolation, and <HI>Edom</HI> shall be a desolate wilderness, for the <HI>vio∣lence</HI> against the <HI>children of Judah,</HI> because they
<PB N="7" REF="043231_0005_101CD953D00ABC38"/>
have shed <HI>INNOCENT BLOOD in their land.</HI> But <HI>Judah</HI> shall dwell forever, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from generation to generation. For <HI>I will cleanse their blood,</HI> that I have not cleansed; for the LORD dwelleth in Zion."</P>
<P>It is not necessary to enquire as to the immediate occasion, or literal fulfilment of the prephecy before us, with respect to the particular nations, or kingdoms here mentioned. It is sufficient to our present pur∣pose to observe, that <HI>Egypt</HI> was early noted, in scrip∣ture history, for oppressing God's people, and causing them to serve with <HI>cruel bondage. Edom</HI> also is mentioned as guilty of <HI>violence</HI> towards them, and expressing a most imbittered hatred and revenge against them; and from the expressions in the text, it is natural to suppose, that there had been some, if not many instances of their shedding <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Psal. cxxxvii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Israel,</HI> God's chosen people, had often suffered violence, from both these states: So that we have good reason to suppose, that both <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> in the language of scripture prophecy, in the text and other passages, may intend not <HI>Egypt</HI> or <HI>Edom</HI> only, but (proverbially) in a more general sense, enemies, persecutors or oppressors of God's people, who violated their rights and liberties, religi∣ous and civil, and by the sword of persecution or op∣pression, shed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land.</P>
<P>Prophecies, especially those that are, or may be, of general use to the people of God, are but seldom literal, either in prediction or fulfilment. They are rather of use to foreshew great and interesting events, as taking place in the world, in such time and man∣ner, and upon such persons, societies, nations, or kingdoms, as shall display the justice and equity of divine government, and the peculiar care which
<PB N="8" REF="043231_0006_101CD95564FA1C38"/>
Heaven takes of the church and people of God, for their correction, instruction, preservation or estab∣lishment. Agreeably St. Peter speaks strongly for this method of explaining and improving scripture prophecies, where he says expressly, that "no pro∣phecy of the scripture is of any private interpretati∣on."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 20.</NOTE> It is, therefore, rational to suppose, that though prophecies may have special or immediate reference to particular persons, societies, nations or kingdoms, and to events in which they may be im∣mediately interested; yet they may be fitly con∣sidered as having a further and more important in∣terpretation, which may be of general use for the di∣rection and edification of God's church and people, in all ages, to the end. In this general sense, there∣fore, you will permit me to consider the prophecy in the passage before us: and thus understood, it is easy to see several things suggested in it, worthy our most serious attention and religious improvement, upon such an occasion as this.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is admitted, that for wise pur∣poses, a just God may permit powerful enemies, or oppressors, to injure, do violence unto and distress his people, and to carry their measures of violence and oppression to such lengths among them, as to strike at their life and "shed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land."</P>
<P>As God is the Sovereign of the world, and exer∣cises his government for the glory of his name, in the good of the whole, so he hath a paternal concern for the special benefit and improvement of his church and people. All creatures are his servants: and God accomplisheth his designs and carries his coun∣sels to effect, by what means and instruments he pleases. It is with him alone, 'who is wonderful in counsel
<PB N="9" REF="043231_0007_101CD95C59245EF0"/>
and excellent in working," to bring good out of evil. When God designs the re roof and correction of his people, he can exercise this holy discipline in various ways and by various means, as shall best an∣swer the purposes of his government. This holy discipline is accordingly exercised, sometimes by the immediate hand of providence: as in wasting sick∣ness parching drought, awful and desolating earth∣quakes, or other judgments, which are immediately from God himself. Or this may be done more im∣mediately, by the instrumentality of his creatures; and even the wicked, and those that love the wages of unrighteousness, that delight in oppression, waste and spoil, or thirst for <HI>innocent blood,</HI> may be im∣proved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the rod in his hand to correct, or punish the sins of his people. With this view the oppressor is per∣mitted to injure, insult, oppress and lay waste in a land; and to carry his measures to the shedding of inno∣cent blood. With the same design does a sovereign God give the enemy a commission, in war, with fire and sword, to distress and destroy.</P>
<P>In such public calamities, it is true, it often comes to pass, that as individuals, the innocent are involved and suffer with the guilty; and sometimes the in∣nocent alone. But however unjust, or cruel the op∣pressor, and those that thirst for blood may be, in contriving and carrying into execution their wicked, opprssieve, or <HI>bloody</HI> designs, they are no other than instruments in providence and the rod in the hand of the great Governor of the world, for the reproof and correction of his people. These things happen not by accident, or chance, but by the direction, or per∣mission of that God, who is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works. When Israel sinned and did evil in the sight of the LORD, it is said, "the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
<PB N="10" REF="043231_0008_101CD95E12351260"/>
delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their ene∣mies round about and they were greatly distressed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. ii. 14, 15.</NOTE> Hence also the <HI>Assyrian King</HI> is expressly called <HI>"the rod of</HI> GOD'S <HI>anger,"</HI> for the correction of his people.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. x. 5.</NOTE> And thus <HI>Egyp</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> in the pro∣phecy before us, in committing violence upon the children of <HI>Judah</HI> and in shedding <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land, are held up to view as the rod in GOD'S hand, for the correction, reproof and instruction of his people. Agreeably▪ this is the language of a just and faithful GOD, in such dispensations, "<HI>hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mic. vi. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>It matters not, therefore, who are the immediate instruments of violence and oppression, or by whose hands the blood of innocent persons is shed, or their substance wasted and habitations destroyed; nor yet from what motives, or views such acts of oppression and cruelty are perpetrated, with respect to the re∣ligious improvement, that GOD expects us, or any people, to make of such heavy dispensations. 'Tis GOD, and his hand—'tis GOD and his providence, which we are first of all concerned to notice, acknow∣ledge and improve. However unjust our sufferings may be from man; yet, when we realize the hand of GOD, the great and wise Governor of the world, as concerned herein, silence and submission is our indis∣pensible duty, and no murmer, or complaint ought ever to be heard, but with reverence and humility it becomes us to bow before the LORD, and adoring his sovereignty, ascribe righteousness to our GOD. Neither the insults of oppressors, nor the flames of our once delightful habitations, nor even the <HI>inno∣cent blood</HI> of our <HI>brethren slain,</HI> should move to a murmuring word or an angry thought, against GOD,
<PB N="11" REF="043231_0009_101CD962785FEE38"/>
his government, or providence.—"Shall we receive good at the hand of GOD, and shall we not receive evil?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job ii. 10.</NOTE>—And "shall not the Judge of all the earth do right!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 25.</NOTE> The more grievously we are smitten, the more deeply we are affected, the more carefully should we endeavour to realize our dependence upon GOD, the more religiously acknowledge his hand, and the more earnestly return to him that smites. This is the lesson of instruction, which GOD expects we should learn, by such bitter dispensations, and this the improvement he looks for, in us and his peo∣ple, in order to the restoration of his favour and our redemption from enemies and oppressors, who threaten to lay waste and destroy. May these things, then, be deeply impressed on each of our hearts.—But I pass</P>
<P>Secondly, To observe the fate of oppressors, and the sentence of heaven against those, that do violence to GOD'S people and shed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land. <HI>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</HI></P>
<P>However just it may be in GOD to correct his peo∣ple, and whatever right is ascribed to him of improv∣ing the wicked, as the rod in his hand to correct, or the sword to punish them; yet this alters not the nature of their oppressive designs, neither does it abate their guilt, or alleviate their crime, in these measures of injustice, violence or cruelty, by which the people of GOD are distressed.</P>
<P>Thus GOD speaks of the Assyrian king, a prince noted in history for his avarice and ambition, cruelty and oppression, (and in him, of the <HI>Assyrian state,</HI> whose character was included in that of its king) saying—"O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and
<PB N="12" REF="043231_0010_101CD9640FE9F980"/>
the staff in their hand is mine indignation. I will send him to an hypocritical nation; and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. Howbeit, he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so, but it is in his heart to destroy. Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the LORD hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. x. 5.—12.</NOTE> And so it came to pass: For this power, that with such a mighty hand, and for so long a time, oppressed GOD'S people and other nations, in GOD'S due time, felt the weight of the iron yoke and received double for all the injustice, oppression and cruelty it had exercised towards others.</P>
<P>In this, and many other circumstances, with which history abounds, it is easy to see the fate of the ene∣mies of GOD'S people and oppressors of mankind.— But we need not go from the text, for satisfaction in this matter. In the words of the prophecy before us, we have the sentence of heaven against the oppressors of GOD'S people and the doom of those common enemies of mankind, pronounced, and the reason thereof assigned, in the clearest terms. <HI>Egypt shall be a desolation, Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judas, be∣cause they have shed innocent blood in their land.</HI></P>
<P>The LORD is a GOD, that loveth righteousness and hateth iniquity, in whatever shape, or character it appears. Injustice, oppression and violence (much less the shedding of innocent blood) shall not pass un∣noticed, by the just Governor of the world. Sooner, or later, a just recompence will be made upon such workers of iniquity.—Yea, though hand join in hand,
<PB N="13" REF="043231_0011_101CD968ADC08E10"/>
in measures of oppression and violence, against GOD'S people; and though their avarice, ambition, and law∣less thirst for power and domination, may carry them on, 'till their steps shall be marked with <HI>innocent blood;</HI> yet, certain it is, they shall not, finally, go unpunished. For a time, indeed, and but for a ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, such workers of unrighteousness, such destroyers of mankind may practise and prosper; but 'vengeance slow, is vengeance sure.' Their ways are marked before GOD. Their punishment and destruction are sealed in his presence: And the time is hastning, when destruction, without remedy, shall be their portion.</P>
<P>The truth of these sentiments hath often been verified in providence, and the proud princes and the most powerful states have been taught, by severe, by fatal experience, that desolation from the LORD awaits the impiety of those, that do v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olence to his people and 'shed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land.'</P>
<P>Here then we may see the light in which that peo∣ple, or nation, are to be considered, that walk in the ways of oppression, and that thirst for and shed inno∣cent blood. Here we may also see the ruin to which they are hastning, the awful judgments that await them, and the great reason they have to fear the sen∣tence of heaven, denounced against them, in the pro∣phecy before us, and its literal fulfilment upon them. Which naturally leads in the last place.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To observe, in the prophecy before us, the peculiar care GOD takes of his church and people, and the assurance they have, even when actually suffering violence and under the cruel hand of op∣pression, of redemption, restoration and establishment; and that GOD himself will plead their cause, and both <HI>cleanse</HI> and <HI>avenge</HI> their innocent blood. Nothing can be more directly expressive of this sentiment, or
<PB N="14" REF="043231_0012_101CD96A4208A910"/>
a firmer ground of assurance, for the confirmation of the faith and hope of God's chosen people in the be∣lief of it, than the promise and prephecy, concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the text. While <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> while the enemies and oppressiors of God's people, are doomed to that desolation, they so justly deserve, the strongest assurances are given, "that <HI>Judah</HI> shall dwell forever, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from ge∣neration to generation For I, saith God, will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: For the Lord dwelleth in Zion." The words are plain, and need no comment. They speak the language of scripture, fact and experience, for the confirmation of the faith and hope of God's church and chosen, in days of per∣plexity and darkness and when actually under the in∣justice, violence and cruelty of inveterate enemies, or <HI>blood thirsty</HI> oppressors.</P>
<P>Here are two things, for the inducement and con∣firmation of the faith and hope of God's church and people, in such times of darkness and distress, which are well worthy serious notice and attention.</P>
<P>First, God's word and promise, in which he assures his people, that notwithstanding the violence of their enemies against them, and the distress and sorrow their oppressors may have caused them, by shedding <HI>innocent blood</HI> among them; yet they shall never avail to overthrow, or destroy them; but they shall assuredly be redeemed and delivered out of their hands, and re∣stored and established, as his church and people, in a flourishing state.</P>
<P>And then, secondly, To leave no doubt upon their minds, as to the fulfilment of this blessed promise, a gracious God condescends to explain him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf in the clearest terms possible, and to satisfy them, that no∣thing should fail of all that he had promised, he as∣sures them that he would take the work into his own
<PB N="15" REF="043231_0013_101CD96BD18CCC40"/>
hands, and see to the accomplishment of it himself; that thus it might appear to them and to the world of mankind, that the Lord was with them and dwelt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the midst of them. "Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation: For <HI>I</HI> will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed; for <HI>the Lord dwelleth in Zion.</HI>"—Words well suited to chear and comfort the sinking spirits of God's afflicted, op∣pressed people: and words which might rouse the faith, and give a spring to the hope of the most feeble and faint-hearted, among God's people, in the depths of distress. For 'God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. 1. Sam. 15.29.</NOTE>— 'Hath he promised, and shall he not perform?— Hath he spoken, and shall he not bring it to pass?'—</P>
<P>Blood is said to be cleansed, or avenged, when justice hath taken place, and the murderer is punished. God may be said to cleanse the innocent blood, which may have been shed among his people, by the sword of oppressors, or enemies, when in providence he un∣dertakes for them, avenges their blood upon them that slew them, and reduces them to reason or ruin.</P>
<P>The sword is an appeal to heaven,—when there∣fore, the arms of a people are eventually successful, or by the immedate interposition of providence, their enemies and oppressors are subdued or destroyed.— When a people are reinstated in peace, upon equitable terms, and established in the enjoyment of all their just rights and liberties, both civil and sacred: then may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be said, that the Lord hath cleansed their in∣nocent blood, and then will it be manifestly evident, that their God is with them and dwelleth in the midst of them.</P>
<P>Now of this God hath given his people the strongest assurances, in the prophecy before us: and these
<PB N="16" REF="043231_0014_101CD96EECFDBEF8"/>
assurances are conformed by the word of God, to his people, throughout the sacred scriptures. So that, though for their sins and the multitude of their transgressions, a righteous God may justly afflict and correct his people, by the hand of oppressors, and permit their most important rights to be violated, their substance destroyed, their habitations to be laid waste, or even the <HI>innocent blood</HI> of their brethren to be wantonly shed in their land; yet still he is their God, in the midst of them, and will readily appear for their help, when they return from their evil ways, acknowledge his hand and implore his mercy and assistance. This holy disciple is no more than what God hath given his people to expect, as a reproof of their declensions, and as a means of bringing them to a sense of their dependence upon him. Such dis∣pensations, are so far from being an evidence, that God hath forsaken his people, given them up, or for∣gotten to be gracious, that they are rather to be con∣sidered as demonstrations of his paternal care and faithfulness towards them. Agreeably, in his coven∣ant with his servant David and his house, this method of conduct is expressly stipulated, as a token of his special care and faithfulness, and of the remembrance of the covenant he had made. "If his children for∣sake my law, and walk not in my judgments:—Then will I visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving kind∣ness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal lxxxix. 30.31.32. and 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>In such visitations, God evidently intends the best good of his people; not their destruction, but their reformation: and if they see his hand, humble them∣selves under it and seek him aright, God will not
<PB N="17" REF="043231_0015_101CD974988A8438"/>
fail to remember his covenant and his promises for them, and in his due time appear, in his power and glory, for their relief.—Yea the bowels of his mercy will be moved at their distresses, and his language will be the same as unto his people of old, when un∣der the <HI>Egyptian yoke,</HI> they were caused to serve with cruel bondage—"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts vii. 34.</NOTE> And to encourage his saints and people, to trust on his name and hope in his mercy, a gracious God hath most explicitly promised them his presence, direction and assistance, in all their distresses, be they ever so numerous, ever so great. His language is merciful, condescending and endearing—especially when by the prophet Isaiah, he says to his afflicted people—"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy One of Israel, thy Saviour."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. xliii 2.3.</NOTE> From these passages of sacred writ, it appears, that as God in in∣finite wisdom, sees fit to exercise his people with trials and afflictions; and sometimes to call them to pass through the depths of adversity: so he hath provided for their support, and given them the greatest reason to hope for his presence and assistance, and the strong∣est assurances, that they shall be carried through all, and in the end rejoice in God, <HI>as the holy One of Israel, their SAVIOUR.</HI>—In short, nothing can be more expressive of God's care of his people in distress, and of the solid ground they have to hope for re∣demption and salvation, in his way and time, which are always the best.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="043231_0016_101CD9761E142E18"/>We may add, that further to confirm our faith and encourage our hope, in those blessed assurances of God's presence with his people, even in their heaviest trials and greatest perplexities, we might safely ap∣peal to the experience of his chosen, in every age, from the beginning to the present time. This will show how easy it is, with an infinitely wise God, to bring good out of evil, and by the over-ruling hand of Providence, to cause the councils and measures of persecutors and oppressors, to hasten the redemption and establishment of the injured and oppressed, as well as to bring upon themselves, that confusion and deso∣lation they so justly deserve.—And this will also prove, how truly applicable the words of the prophet are, to God's chosen people in their distresses, in every age, when speaking of the large experience Israel had had, of the tender love and faithful care of a merciful God exercised towards them, he says, that, "In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: In his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. vi. 3.9.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident from history and experi∣ence, than God's care of his people, and the wisdom of his providence, in causing the violence and oppres∣sion of their enemies, to operate for their advantage, and promote their more speedy deliverance. This appears too plain, from various instances, to admit of dispute.</P>
<P>The <HI>children of Israel</HI> would not have been, so early, persuaded to have left the gardens of <HI>Egypt</HI> or the fertile fields of the land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> and in the face of every danger, attempted to free themselves from the <HI>Egyptian yoke,</HI> had not their burdens been increased to an unreasonable degree, by the violence
<PB N="19" REF="043231_0017_101CD97A159C6110"/>
and cruelty of those that oppressed them, in that house of <HI>bondage.</HI> And <HI>Pharoah and his armies</HI> would never have met with that disgraceful defeat, and awful destruction, which overtook them in the <HI>red sea,</HI> had they not been infatuated to pursue their measures of oppression and violence, when after it was evident that their cause was desperate, and that God was against them.</P>

At the same time, <HI>Spain</HI> had the best regulated army in Europe, commanded by the renowned <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Alva,</HI> the most experienced General then upon the stage. This wise, experienced and victorious General, with his veteran, victorious troops, was sent by the <HI>Monarch</HI> and court of Spain (like <HI>Gage to Britain</HI>) upon the <HI>wholesome</HI> and <HI>pacific</HI> business of supporting government in the <HI>Dutch</HI> provinces, and enforcing obedience to what were called the laws of the kingdom, or the mandates of their sovereign. Accordingly, after renewed in∣juries and repeated insults and cruelties, which rather invigorated than disheartned the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>truly noble</HI> spirits of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at last, it came to blood!—The contest was, as might be expected, <HI>long</HI> and <HI>bitter!</HI>—But, under every disadvantage, but the righteousness of their cause, they rose superior to their mighty and numerous oppressors; and heaven, at length, decided in their favour, crowned their endeavours with desired success, and gave and established unto them that <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>independence,</HI> for which they had so <HI>bravely fought</HI> and so <HI>freely bled.</HI> This free∣dom and independence, so dearly purchased, they well knew how to prize and preserve; and by the smiles of heaven, upon the wisdom and policy of their government, they have now enjoyed the blessings thereof, with but little interruption from enemies abroad, or factions at home, for near two hundred years: And, in proportion to the extent of their territories and the number of inhabitants, they are, at this very time, justly esteemed one of the richest and most flourishing states in Europe. Thus hath a righteous God been pleased to plead their cause, and <HI>cleanse</HI> and <HI>avenge</HI> their <HI>innocent blood;</HI> and set them free from the oppres∣sors hand.

rod of oppression and tyranny, and seen their danger and the absolute necessity of such resistance, to pre∣vent the total deprivation, of all they held dear and sacred, as <HI>Freemen, Christians</HI> and a <HI>free People.— Charles</HI> would not have lost his kingdom, and finally his life upon the <HI>Scaffold,</HI> by the hand of the executioner; nor <HI>James</HI> been obliged, in disgrace, to quit his throne and abdicate the government of the kingdom, had it not been for their own violent coun∣sels and measures, to oppress and enslave the people, whom they were called to govern and protect.</P>
<P>Our <HI>fathers</HI> would never have forsook their native land, delightsome habitations and fair possessions, and in the face of almost every danger and distress, sought a safe retreat, for the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty, among savage beasts and more savage men in the <HI>inhospitable wilds of America;</HI> had they not been drove from thence, by the violence and cruelty of persecutors and oppressors, in church and state. The <HI>hierarchy of the church,</HI> by which they looked upon the rights of conscience infringed, and the <HI>arbitrary measures of the state,</HI> by which they esteemed their civil liberties abridged, if not grossly violated, rather than any views of worldly gain (as hath been enviously hinted by some) were the prin∣cipal causes of their emigration, and the hope and ex∣pectation of deliverance therefrom, gave the spring to the hazzardous undertaking.</P>
<P>And when heaven so far smiled upon their enter∣prize, as to give them footing in the land; and when, after numerous hardships and dangers, toils and dis∣tresses, they had secured a possession for themselves and posterity, and obtained a confirmation of those civil and religious liberties they had sought; still re∣taining a filial affection towards their <HI>native country,</HI> they seemed to have nothing more at heart than that

<HI>Americans</HI> might be happy, in the enjoyment of their just rights and liberties, as men and christians, under the protection of <HI>Britain;</HI> and that <HI>Britain</HI> might be flourishing and glorious, in receiving the profits of the labour, trade and industry of <HI>Americans:</HI> And that the connection of <HI>America</HI> with <HI>Britain,</HI> and her de∣pendence, in this way, upon the <HI>Parent State,</HI> might have been preserved inviolate to the end of time.— And it may be added, that there is no just ground to suppose, that it would have ever entered the heart of <HI>Americans,</HI> to have desired a dissolution of so happy a connection with the <HI>Mother-Country,</HI> or to have sought independence of <HI>Britain,</HI> had they not been urged, and even forced upon such an expedient, by measures of oppression and violence, and <HI>the shedding of inno∣cent blood.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas!—Ill-judged counsels!—Ill-fated mea∣sures of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the <HI>British administration,</HI> with respect to <HI>America,</HI> have broken in upon the pleasing scene, and fatally destroyed the happy pros∣pects of both <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America!</HI></P>
<P>At the close of the last war, we arrived at that happy period, to which our ancestors looked, with earnest expectation as the utmost of their wishes, as the answer of their prayers, and the reward of all their toils and sufferings. The <HI>savages</HI> were subdu∣ed, those restless neighbours, the <HI>French</HI> were sub∣jected, and this wide extended continent seemed to be given us for a possession: And we were ready to say, 'there was none to make us afraid.'—But how un∣certain the most blooming prospects?—How vain— how disappointing the most <HI>rational,</HI> as well as raised expectations, in this imperfect state?—Scarcely em∣erged from the dangers and fatigues of a long and distressing war, we are unexpectedly involved in per∣plexities

and anxieties of different kind, which by degrees have increased, 'till they are become more serious, dangerous and distressing, than any ever yet felt, by God's people, in this <HI>once</HI> happy land.</P>
<P>Through the crafty insinuations, false representa∣tions and diabolical counsels, of the enemies of God's people and the common rights of mankind, in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> and <HI>Britain, acts of oppression</HI> are made by the <HI>Parliament of England,</HI> in which we are not represented, which deeply affect our most valuable priviledges. In open violation of our <HI>chartered</HI> rights, these acts of unrighteousness and oppression, are attempted to be carried into execution, in these <HI>colo∣nies.</HI> After various threats of coercive measures, a <HI>military force</HI> is sent to inforce them. An innocent, loyal people are distressed, and every art, which wit or malice could invent, is used to flatter or fright, to divide or dishearten, and finally subject us to the will of a power, not known in our <HI>charters,</HI> or even in the <HI>British constitution itself.</HI> And as one of the natural consequences of <HI>standing armies</HI> being stationed in populous cities, for such execrable purposes, many of the inhabitants of <HI>Boston</HI> are insulted. At length, under pretence of ill-treatment, the streets of that once flourishing city, are stained with the <HI>innocent blood</HI> of a number of our brethren, wantonly or cruelly slain, by those sons of oppression and violence!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This refers to the <HI>horrid massacre,</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> on the evening of the 5th of March, 1770, when the guards, under the com∣mand of <HI>Capt.

<P>Upon the high resentments of the people, in con∣sequence of this <HI>horrid outrage</HI> and <HI>violence,</HI> there was, for a short time, a pause in their measures.—

For a moment the oppressors themselves seemed to be struck with the horrid effects of their own iniqui∣tous proceedings, and stand <HI>aghast</HI> at the sight of the <HI>innocent blood</HI> they had shed! Perhaps they were not, at that time, so thoroughly hardened in sin, as they have proved themselves since!—But this pause seem∣ed to be, not to repent of their evil deeds, but rather to collect themselves, and devise some measures more effectual: For so far from giving over the <HI>execrable</HI> design, the plan of oppression is renewed. <HI>New acts</HI> are passed to distress and inslave us. The lust of domination appears no longer in disguise, but with open face.—The <HI>starving Port-Bill</HI> comes forth— <HI>Gage</HI> arrives with his forces by sea and land, to carry it into execution, with vigour and severity.—And to compleat the scene, and at once, to make thorough work of oppression and tyranny, immediately follow <HI>the Bills,</HI> that subvert the constitution, vacate our <HI>charter,</HI> abridge us of the right of trial by juries of the vicinity, in divers specified capital cases, and ex∣pose us to be seized, contrary to the laws of the land, and carried to <HI>England</HI> to be tried for our lives!— As also <HI>the Bill</HI> for establishing the <HI>popish</HI> religion in <HI>Canada,</HI> contrary to the faith of the crown and the statutes of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Many inhabitants both of the town and country, are daily abused and insulted, by the troops.

<P>ON the evening of the <HI>eighteenth</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1775, we received two messages; the first verbal, the other <HI>by express, in writing,</HI> from the <HI>committee of safety,</HI> who were then sitting in the westerly part of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> directed to the Honorable JOHN HANCOCK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> (who, with the Honorable SAMUEL ADAMS, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was then providentially with us) informing, "that <HI>eight</HI> or <HI>nine officers</HI> of the <HI>king's troops</HI> were seen, just be∣fore night, passing the road towards <HI>Lexington,</HI> in a <HI>musing, con∣templative</HI> posture; and it was suspected they were out upon some evil design."</P>
<P>As both these gentlemen had been frequently and even <HI>pub∣licly,</HI> threatened, by the enemies of <HI>this people,</HI> both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> with the <HI>vengeance</HI> of the <HI>British administration:</HI>— And as Mr. <HI>Hancock</HI> in particular had been, more than once, <HI>personally insulted,</HI> by some officers of the troops, in Boston; it was not without some just grounds supposed, that under cover of the darkness, <HI>sudden arrest,</HI> if not <HI>assassination</HI> might be attempted, by these <HI>instruments of tyranny!</HI></P>
<P>To prevent any thing of this kind, <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twelve</HI> men were immediately collected, in arms, to guard my house, through the night.</P>
<P>In the mean time, said <HI>officers</HI> passed through this town, on the road towards <HI>Concord:</HI> It was therefore thought expedient to watch their motions, and if possible make some discovery of their intentions. Accordingly, about 10 o'clock in the evening, three men, on horses, were dispatched for this purpose. As they were <HI>peaceably</HI> passing the road towards <HI>Concord,</HI> in the borders of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> they were suddenly stopped by <HI>said officers,</HI> who rode up to them, and putting pistols to their breasts and seizing their horses bridles, <HI>swore, if they stirred another step, they should be all dead men!</HI>—The officers detained them several hours, as <HI>prison∣ers,</HI> examined, searched, abused and insulted them; and in their hasty return (supposing themselves discovered) they left them in Lexington.—Said officers also took into custody, abused and <HI>threatened with their lives</HI> several other persons; some of whom they met peaceably passing on the road, others even at the doors of their dwellings, without the least provocation, on the part of the inhabitants, or so much as a question asked by them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="043231_0031_101CD9A2EDBB65C0"/>Between the hours of <HI>twelve</HI> and <HI>one,</HI> on the morning of the NINETEENTH OF APRIL, we received intelligence, by express, from the Honorable JOSEPH WARREN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at <HI>Boston,</HI> "that a large body of the <HI>king's troops</HI> (supposed to be a brigade of about 12, or 1500) were embarked in boats from <HI>Boston,</HI> and gone over to land on <HI>Lech∣mere's-Point</HI> (so called) in <HI>Cambridge:</HI> And that it was shrewdly suspected, that they were ordered to seize and destroy the <HI>stores, belonging to the colony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen deposited at Concord,</HI>" in consequence of <HI>General Gage's unjustifiable seizure of the provincial magazine of powder at Medford,</HI> and other <HI>colony stores</HI> in several other places.</P>
<P>Upon this intelligence, as also upon information of the conduct of the officers as above-mentioned, the <HI>militia</HI> of this town were alarmed, and ordered to meet on the usual place of parade; not with any design of <HI>commencing hostilities</HI> upon the <HI>king's troops,</HI> but to consult what might be done for our own and the people's safety: And also to be ready for whatever service provi∣dence might call us out to, upon this alarming occasion, in case <HI>overt-acts</HI> of <HI>violence,</HI> or <HI>open hostilities</HI> should be committed by this <HI>mercenary band of armed and blood-thirsty oppressors.</HI></P>
<P>About the same time, two persons were sent express to <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> if possible, to gain intelligence of the motions of the troops, and what rout they took.</P>
<P>The <HI>militia</HI> met according to order; and waited the return of the messengers, that they might order their measures as occa∣sion should require. Between 3 and 4 o'clock, one of the ex∣presses returned, informing, that there was no appearance of the troops, on the roads, either from <HI>Cambridge</HI> or <HI>Charlestown;</HI> and that it was supposed that the <HI>movements in the army</HI> the evening before, were only <HI>a feint</HI> to alarm the people. Upon this, there∣fore, the <HI>militia company</HI> were dismissed for the present, but with orders to be within call of the drum,—waiting the return of the other messenger, who was expected in about an hour, or sooner, if any discovery should be made of the motions of the troops.— But he was prevented by their silent and sudden arrival at the place where he was, waiting for intelligence. So that, after all this precaution, we had no notice of their approach, 'till the <HI>brigade</HI> was <HI>actually in the town,</HI> and upon a quick march within about a mile and a quarter of the <HI>meeting house</HI> and <HI>place of parade.</HI></P>
<P>However, the commanding officer thought best to call the company together,—not with any design of opposing so superior a force, <HI>much less of commencing hostilities;</HI> but only with a view to determine what to do, when and where to meet, and to dismiss and disperse.</P>
<P>Accordingly, about half an hour after four o'clock, <HI>alarm guns were fired, and the drums beat to arms;</HI> and the <HI>militia</HI> were col∣lecting
<PB N="3" REF="043231_0032_101CD9A475E3A398"/>
together.—Some, to the number of about 50, or 60, or possibly more, were on the parade, others were coming towards it.—In the mean time, the troops, having thus stolen a march upon us, and to prevent any intelligence of their approach, having seized and held prisoners several persons whom they met <HI>unarmed</HI> upon the road, seemed to come <HI>determined for MURDER</HI> and <HI>BLOODSHED;</HI> and that whether provoked to it, or not!— When within about half a quarter of a mile of the <HI>meeting-house,</HI> they halted, and the command was given to <HI>prime</HI> and <HI>load;</HI> which being done, they marched on 'till they came up to the east end of said meeting-house, in sight of our <HI>militia</HI> (collecting as aforesaid) who were about 12, or 13 rods distant.—Immediately upon their appearing <HI>so suddenly,</HI> and <HI>so nigh,</HI> Capt. <HI>Parker,</HI> who commanded the <HI>militia company,</HI> ordered the men to disperse, and take care of themselves; and <HI>not to fire.</HI>—Upon this, our men dispersed;—but, many of them, not so speedily as they might have done, not having the most distant idea of such <HI>brutal barbarity</HI> and more than <HI>savage CRUELTY,</HI> from the troops of a <HI>British KING,</HI> as they immediately experienced!—!—For, no sooner did they come in sight of our company, but one of them, supposed to be an officer of rank, was heard to say to the troops, <HI>"Damn them; we will have them!"</HI>—Upon which the troops shouted aloud, huzza'd, and rushed furiously towards our men.—About the same time, three officers (supposed to be Col. <HI>Smith,</HI> Major <HI>Pitcaira</HI> and another officer) advanced, on horse back, to the front of the body, and coming within 5 or 6 rods of the <HI>militia,</HI> one of them cried out, <HI>"ye villains, ye Rebels, disperse; Damn you, disperse!"</HI>—or words to this effect. One of them (whether the same, or not, is not easily determined) said, <HI>"Lay down your arms; Damn you, why don't you lay down your arms!"</HI>—The second of these officers, about this time, fired a pistol towards the <HI>militia,</HI> as they were dispersing.—The foremost, who was within a few yards of our men, brandishing his sword, and then pointing towards them, with a loud voice said, to the troops, "Fire!—By God, fire!"—which was in∣stantly followed by a discharge of arms from the said troops, succeeded by a very heavy and close fire upon our party, dis∣persing, so long as any of them were within reach.—<HI>Eight were left dead upon the ground!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the names of the killed and wounded, see Ser. page 28, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Ten were wounded.</HI>—The rest of the company, through divine goodness, were (to a miracle) preserv∣ed unhurt in this <HI>murderous</HI> action!—</P>
<P>As to the question, 'Who fired first?'—if it can be a question with any; we may observe, that though <HI>General Gage</HI> hath been pleased to tell the world, in his account of this <HI>savage transaction,</HI> "that the troops were fired upon by <HI>the rebels</HI> out of the <HI>meeting-house,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="043231_0033_101CD9A77307EF30"/>
and the <HI>neighbouring houses,</HI> as well as by those that were were in the field; and that the troops <HI>only</HI> returned the fire, and passed on their way to Concord;"—yet nothing can be more certain than the contrary, and nothing more <HI>false, weak,</HI> or <HI>wicked,</HI> than such a representation.</P>
<P>To say nothing of the absurdity of the supposition, 'that 50, 60, or even 70 men, should, in the <HI>open field, commence hostilities</HI> with 12, or 1500, of the best troops of <HI>Britain,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1200, or 1500, was the number we then supposed the brigade to consist of: though afterwards, by the best accounts, it appeared, that there were but about 800.</NOTE> nor of the <HI>known</HI> determination of this small party of <HI>Americans,</HI> upon no conside∣ration whatever, to begin the scene of blood <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From a most intimate acquaintance with the sentiments of the inhabitants of this town, then collected in arms, I think I may holdly assert, that it was their <HI>know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> determination not to commence hostilities, upon the king's troops; though they were equally determined to stand by their rights to the last.</NOTE>—<HI>A cloud of wit∣nesses,</HI> whose veracity cannot be justly disputed, <HI>upon oath</HI> have declared, in the most express and positive terms, '<HI>that the British troops fired first:</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See narrative and depositions, published by authority.</NOTE>—And I think, we may safely add, without the least reason or provocation.—Nor was there oppor∣tunity given, for our men to have saved themselves, either by laying down their arms, or dispersing, as directed, had they been disposed to; as the command to fire upon them was given almost at the same instant, that they were ordered, by the <HI>British officers,</HI> to <HI>disperse,</HI> to <HI>lay down their arms,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In short, so far from <HI>firing first</HI> upon the king's troops; upon the most careful enquiry, it appears, that but very few of our people fired at all; and even <HI>they</HI> did not fire till after being fired upon by the troops, they were wounded themselves, or saw others killed, or wounded by them, and looked upon it next to impossible for them to escape.</P>
<P>As to any firing from the <HI>meeting-house,</HI> as <HI>Gage</HI> represents; it is certain, that there were but <HI>four men</HI> in the meeting house, when the troops came up: and they were then getting some am∣munition, from the town stock, and had not so much as loaded their guns (except one, who never discharged it) when the troops fired upon the <HI>militia.</HI> And as to the <HI>neighbouring houses,</HI> it is equally certain, that there was no firing from them, unless, after the dispersion of our men, some, who had fled to them for shelter, might fire from them upon the troops.</P>
<P>One circumstance more, before the brigade quitted Lexington, I beg leave to mention, as what may give a further specimen of the <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>character,</HI> of the officers and men, of this body of troops.—After the <HI>militia company</HI> were dispersed and the firing
<PB N="5" REF="043231_0034_101CD9A967A19D58"/>
ceased, the troops drew up and formed, in a body on the com∣mon, <HI>fired a volley</HI> and <HI>gave three huzzas,</HI> by way of <HI>triumph,</HI> and as expressive of the <HI>joy of VICTORY</HI> and <HI>glory of CON∣QUEST!</HI>—!—Of this transaction, I was a witness, having, at that time, a fair view of their motions, and being at the distance of not more than 70 or 80 rods from them.</P>
<P>Whether this step was <HI>honorary</HI> to the detachment, or agreeable to the rules of war—or how far it was expressive of <HI>bravery, heroism</HI> and <HI>true military glory,</HI> for 800 disciplined troops of <HI>Great-Briain,</HI> without notice or provocation, to fall upon 60, or 70, undisciplined <HI>Americans,</HI> who neither opposed nor molested them, and <HI>murder</HI> some and disperse the rest, and then to <HI>give the shout</HI> and <HI>make the triumph of victory,</HI> is not for me to determine; but must be submitted to the impartial world to judge.—That "there is a God with whom is the power, and the glory, and the victory," is certain: but whether he will <HI>set his seal</HI> to the triumph, made upon this most <HI>peculiar</HI> occasion, by following it with further successes, and finally giving up <HI>this people</HI> into the hands of those, that have thus <HI>cruelly</HI> commenced hostilities against them, must be left to time to discover.—But to return from this digression, if it may be called a disgression.</P>
<P>Having thus <HI>vanquished the party</HI> in <HI>Lexington,</HI> the troops marched on for <HI>Concord,</HI> to execute their orders, in destroying the stores belonging to the colony, deposited there—They met with no interruption in their march to <HI>Concord.</HI>—But by some means or other, the people of <HI>Concord</HI> had notice of their approach and designs, and were alarmed about break of day; and collecting as soon, and as many as possible, improved the time they had be∣fore the troops came upon them, to the best advantage, both for concealing and securing as many of the public stores as they could, and in preparing for defence. —By the stop of the troops at Lexington, many thousands were saved to the colony, and they were, in a great measure, frustrated in their design.</P>
<P>When the troops made their approach to the easterly part of the town, the provincials of <HI>Concord</HI> and some neighbouring towns, were collected and collecting in an advantageous post, on a hill, a little distance from the <HI>meeting-house,</HI> north of the road, to the number of about 150, or 200: but finding the troops to be more than three times as many, they wisely retreated, first to a hill about 80 rods further north, and then over, the <HI>north-bridge</HI> (so called) about a mile from the town: and there they waited the coming of the <HI>militia</HI> of the towns adjacent, to their assistance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the British detachment marched into the center of the town. A party of about 200, was ordered to take possession of said bridge, other parties were dispatched to various
<PB N="6" REF="043231_0035_101CD9AB2C195650"/>
parts of the town, in search of public stores, while the remainder were employed in seizing and destroying, whatever they could find in the <HI>town-house,</HI> and other places, where stores had been lodged.—But before they had accomplished their design, they were interrupted by a discharge of arms, at <HI>said bridge.</HI></P>
<P>It seems, that of the party above-mentioned, as ordered to take possession of the bridge, one half were marched on about two miles, in search of stores, at Col. <HI>Barret's</HI> and that part of the town: while the other half, consisting of towards 100 men, under Capt. <HI>Lawrie,</HI> were left to guard the bridge. The pro∣vincials, who were in sight of the bridge, observing the troops attempting to take up the planks of said bridge, thought it necessary to dislodge them, and gain possession of the bridge.— They accordingly marched, but with express orders not to fire, unless first fired upon by the king's troops. Upon their approach towards the bridge, Capt. <HI>Lawrie's</HI> party fired upon them, killed Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and another man dead upon the spot, and wounded several others. Upon this our <HI>militia</HI> rushed on, with a spirit becoming <HI>free-born Americans,</HI> returned the fire upon the enemy, killed 2, wounded several and drove them from the bridge, and pursued them towards the town, 'till they were covered by a reinforcement from the main body. The provin∣cials then took post on a hill, at some distance, north of the town: and as their numbers were continually increasing, they were preparing to give the troops a <HI>proper discharge,</HI> on their departure from the town.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the king's troops collected; and having dressed their wounded, destroyed what stores they could find, and insulted and plundered a number of the inhabitants, pre∣pared for a retreat.</P>
<P>"While at <HI>Concord,</HI> the troops disabled two 24 pounders; destroyed their 2 carriages, and seven wheels for the same, with their limbers. Sixteen wheels for brass 3 pounders, and 2 carriages with limber and wheels for two 4 pounders. They threw into the river, wells, &amp;c. about 500 weight of ball: and stove about 60 barrels of flour; but not having time to perfect their work, one half of the flour was afterwards saved."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rev. Mr. Gordon's account.</NOTE></P>
<P>The troops began a hasty retreat about the middle of the day: and were no sooner out of the town, but they began to meet the effects of the just resentments of this injured people. The pro∣vincials fired upon them from various quarters, and pursued them (though without any military order) with a firmness and intrepidity, beyond what could have been expected, on the first onset, and in such a day of confusion and distress!—The fire was returned, for a time, with great fury, by the troops as they
<PB N="7" REF="043231_0036_101CD9AF499F1E98"/>
retreated, though (through divine goodness) with but little ex∣ecution.—This scene continued, with but little intermission, till they returned to Lexington; when it was evident, that, having lost numbers in killed, wounded, and prisoners that fell into our hands, they began to be, not only fatigued, but greatly disheartened. And it is supposed they must have soon surren∣dered at discretion, had they not been reinforced.—But <HI>Lord Percy's</HI> arrival with another brigade, of about 1000 men, and 2 field pieces, about half a mile from Lexington <HI>meeting-house,</HI> towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> gave them a seasonable respite.</P>
<P>The coming of the reinforcement, with <HI>the cannon,</HI> (which our people were not so well acquainted with then, as they have been since) put the provincials also to a pause, for a time.—But no sooner were the <HI>king's troops</HI> in motion, but our men renewed the pursuit with equal, and even greater ardor and intrepidity than before, and the firing on both sides continued, with but little in∣termission, to the close of the day, when the troops entered <HI>Charlestown,</HI> where the <HI>provincials</HI> could not follow them, with∣out exposing the worthy inhabitants of that <HI>truly patriotic town,</HI> to their rage and revenge.—That night and the next day, they were conveyed in boats, over <HI>Charles-River</HI> to <HI>Boston,</HI> glad to secure themselves, under the cover of the shipping, and by strengthning and perfecting the fortifications, at every part, against the further attacks of a justly incensed people, who, up∣on intelligence of the <HI>murderous transactions</HI> of this fatal day, were collecting in arms, round the town, in great numbers, and from every quarter.</P>
<P>In the retreat of the king's troops from <HI>Concord</HI> to <HI>Lexington,</HI> they ravaged and plundered, as they had opportunity, more or less, in most of the houses that were upon the road.—But after they were joined by <HI>Piercy's brigade,</HI> in Lexington, it seemed as if <HI>all the little remains</HI> of humanity had left them; and rage and revenge had taken the reins. and knew no bounds!—<HI>Cloathing, furniture, provisions, goods, plundered, broken, carried off, or destroy∣ed!—Buildings (especially dwelling houses) abused, defaced, battered, shattered and almost ruined!—And as if this had not been enough, numbers of them doomed to the flames!—Three dwelling houses, two shops and a barn, were laid in ashes, in Lexington</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deacon Loring's house and barn, Mrs. Lydia Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken's house, and her son's shop, and Mr. Joshua Bond's house and shop.</NOTE>!—<HI>Many others were set on fire, in this town, in Cambridge, &amp;c. and must have shared the same sate, had not the close pursuit of the provincials pre∣vented, and the flames been seasonably quenched!—Add to all this; the unarmed, the aged and infirm, who were unable to flee, are in∣humanly stabbed and murdered in their habitations!—Yea even wo∣men in child-bed, with their helpless babes in their arms, do not escape
<PB N="8" REF="043231_0037_101CD9B271105D20"/>
the horrid alternative, of being either cruelly murdered in their beds, burnt in their habitations, or turned into the streets to perish with cold, nakedness and distress</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See dep. published by authority.</NOTE> — <HI>But I forbear—words are too insignifi∣cant to express, the horrid barbarities of that distressing day!</HI>—!—!<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Quorum parts magna sui!" <BIBL>VIR.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Our loss, in the several actions of that day, was 49 killed, 34 wounded and 5 missing, who were taken prisoners, and have since been exchanged. The enemy's loss, according to the best accounts, in killed, wounded and missing, about 300.</P>
<P>As the war was thus began with <HI>savage cruelty,</HI> in the aggress∣ors; so it has been carried on with the same temper and spirit, by the enemy in but too many instances. Witness the <HI>wanton cruelty,</HI> discovered in <HI>burning Charlestown, Norfolk, Falmouth,</HI> &amp;c. But as events which have taken place since the <HI>ever memorable nineteenth of April,</HI> 1775. do not properly come within the com∣pass of this narrative, they must be left for some abler pen to relate.</P>
