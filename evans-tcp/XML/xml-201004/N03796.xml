<HEAD>To all the Ignorant, Carnal, and Ungodly, who are Lovers of Pleasure more than God, and seek this World more than the Life Everlasting, and live after the Flesh, and not after the Spirit. These Calls and Counsels are directed, in hope of their Conversion to GOD, and of their Salvation.</HEAD>

<Q>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Miserable Souls!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere is that <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> in every <HI>True Believer,</HI> but especially in every <HI>faith∣ful Minister</HI> of CHRIST, which engageth them to long and labour for your Salvation. <HI>Life</HI> is communicative and active. It maketh us sen∣sible that Faith is not a Fantasy, nor true Religi∣on a Stage-Play, nor our Hopes of our eternal Hap∣piness a Dream. And as we desire nothing more for ourselves, than to have more of the Holy Life which we have, alas! in so small a Measure; so what is it that we should more desire for others? With the Eye of an infallible (tho' too weak) Faith, <HI>we see</HI> the Heaven which you neglect, and the blessed Souls in Glory with Christ, whose Companions you might be forever: We see the multitude of Souls in Hell, who came thither by the same Way that you are going in. Who are shut out of the glorious Presence of God, and are now among those Devils that deceived them, remembering that they had their good Things here, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.25. And how they spent the Day of their Visitation, and how light they once set by God, by Christ, by Heaven, by Mercy, whilst Mercy was an earnest Solicitor for their Hearts: And with our bodily Eyes we see at the same time, abundance of poor Sinners living about us, as if there were no God, no Christ, no Heaven, no Hell, no Judgment; nor no Death to be expected;
<PB N="iii" REF="004663_0003_100DE88416055C10"/>
as if a Man were but a Master-beast, to rule the rest, and feed upon them, and perish with them. And if it were here our own Case, to see what Souls do in Heaven and Hell, and at once to see how unbeliev∣ingly, carelesly and sensesly most Men live on earth, as if there were no such difference in another world: Would it not seem a pitiful sight to you? If you had once seen the five Brethren of <HI>Dives</HI> on Earth, eat∣ing, drinking laughing and merry, cloathed and fa∣ring daily with the best, and at the same time seen their Brother's Soul in Hell, begging in vain for a little Ease, and wishing in vain that one from the dead might go warn his Brethren, that they come not to the Place of Torment; would it not seem to you a pitiful Sight? Would not Pity have made you think, [<HI>Is there no way to open these Gentlemen's Eyes? No way to acquaint them what is become of their Bro∣ther, and where</HI> Lazarus <HI>is, and whither they them∣selves are going? No one driveth or forceth them to Hell, and will they go thither of themselves? And is there no way to stop them or keep them back?</HI>] Did you but see yourselves, what we see by Faith (be∣lieving God) and at once beheld the Saints in Hea∣ven, the lost despairing Souls in Hell, and the sense∣less sensual Sinners on Earth, that yet they will lay none of this to Heart, sure it would make you won∣der at the stupidity of Mankind. Would you not say, O what a Deceiver is the Devil, that can thus lead on Souls to their own Damnation? O what a Cheater is this transitory World, that can <HI>make</HI> Man <HI>so forget the World</HI> where they must live forever? O what an Enemy is this Flesh, that thus draweth down Men's Souls from God? O what a besotting thing is Sin, that turneth a reasonable Soul into worse than a Beast? What a Bedlam is this wicked World, when Thousands are so busily labouring to undo them∣selves and others, and gratifying the Devil, against the GOD and Saviour who would give them an everlasting blessed Life!</P>
<P>And as we have such a Sight as this by Faith to make us pity you, so have we so much Taste of the
<PB N="iv" REF="004663_0004_100DE886B59D20D0"/>
<HI>Goodness</HI> of God, the Sweetness of his Ways, and the <HI>Happiness</HI> of Believers, as must needs make us wish, that you had but once tried the same de∣lights, which would turn the Pleasures of sin into detestation. God knoweth that we desire nothing more for <HI>ourselves,</HI> than the Perfection and <HI>Eterni∣ty</HI> of this <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> which we <HI>believe and taste.</HI> And should we not desire the same for you?</P>
<P>And being thus moved with necessary Pity, we ask of God what he would have us to do for your Salvation; and he hath told us in Scripture, that the Preaching of his Gospel, to acquaint you plainly with the Truth, and earnestly and frequently in∣treat you to turn from the Flesh and World to God by Jesus Christ, is the Means with which his Grace is ready to concur for your Salvation; when obsti∣nate Resistance causeth the Holy Spirit to forsake the Sinner, and leave him to himself, to follow his own Counsels, Lusts and Wills.</P>
<P>In this Hope we undertook the sacred Ministry, and gave up ourselves to this great and most im∣portant Work, in the great Sense of our Unwor¦thiness, but yet in the sense of your Souls Necessi∣ty. We were not such Fools at our first setting out, as not to know it must be a Life of Labour, Self-denial and Patience, and the Devil would do his worst to hinder us, and that all sorts of his Instru∣ments would be ready to serve him against our La∣bours, and against your Souls. <HI>Christ</HI> your <HI>Captain</HI> saved by <HI>Patient Conquest,</HI> and so must we save <HI>our∣selves and you;</HI> And so must <HI>you save yourselves</HI> under Christ, if ever you be saved. It was not strange to <HI>Paul,</HI> that Bonds and Afflictions did eve∣ry where abide him; nor did he account his Life dear, that he might finish his Course with Joy, and the Ministry committed to him by the Lord, <HI>Acts</HI> 20, 23, 24. It was no strange thing to him, to be <HI>forbidden to preach to the Gentiles, that they might be saved,</HI> by such as were <HI>filling up the measure of their Sins,</HI> and where, under God's <HI>uttermost Wrath</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="004663_0005_100DE8884F0E08D0"/>
on Earth, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.15, 16 Devils and Pharisees, and most where they came, both high and low, were against the Apostles preaching of the Gospel, and yet they would not sacrilegiously and cruelly break their Covenant with Christ, and perfidiously de∣sert the Souls of Men, even as their Lord, for the love of Souls did call <HI>Peter Satan,</HI> that would have tempted him to save his Life and Flesh, instead of making it a Sacrifice for our Sins.</P>
<P>What think you should move us to undertake a calling so contrary to our fleshly ease and interests? Do we not know the the way of Ease and Honour? of Wealth and Pleasures, as well as others? And have we not Flesh as well as others? Could we not be content that the Cup of Reproach, and Scorn and Slander, and Poverty and Labours, might pass from us, if it were not for the Will of God and your Sal∣vation? why should we love to be the lowest, and troden down by malignant Pride, and counted as the filth of the World, and the Off-scouring of all things, represented to Rulers whom we honour, as Schismaticks, disobedient, turbulent, unruly, by e∣very Church-Usurper, whom we refuse to make a God of; why give you not over this Preaching of the Gospel, at the will of Satan, that is, for the <HI>ever∣lasting suffering of your Souls,</HI> under the pretence of <HI>making us suffer?</HI> Is not all this that you may be con∣verted and saved? If we be herein besides ourselves, it is for you. Could the words of the Ignorant or Proud, have perswaded us that either your wants or dangers are so inconsiderable, or your other Supplies and Helps sufficient, that our Labours had been un∣necessary to you, God knoweth we should have rea∣dily obeyed <HI>the silencing sort of Pastors,</HI> and have be∣taken us to some other land, where our Service had been more necessary. Let shame be the Hypocrites re∣ward, who take not the saving of Souls, and the plea∣sing of God, for a sufficient reward, without Eccle∣siastical Dignities, Preferments, or worldly Wealth.</P>
<P>I have told you our Motives, I have told you our Business, and the Terms of our Undertaking
<PB N="vi" REF="004663_0006_100DE889FA61BD60"/>
It is God, and you <HI>Sinners,</HI> that next must tell us what our Entertainment and Success shall be. Shall it still be Neglect and unthankful Contempt, and turning away your Ear and Heart, and saying, we have somewhat else to mind? Will you still be cheated by this deceiving World? And spend all your Days in pampering your Guts, and providing for your Flesh, that must lie rotting very shortly in a Grave? Were you made for no better Work than this? May not we bring you to some sober thoughts of your Condition, nor one awakened look into the World where you must be forever? Nor one Heart-raising Thought of the everlasting Glory? Not one Heart-piercing Thought of all your Saviour's Love? Not one Tear for all your sinful Lives? O God forbid! Let not our Labour be so despised: Let not your God, your Saviour, and your Souls be set so light by. O let there be no profane Person among you like <HI>Esau,</HI> who, for <HI>one morsel, sold</HI> his Birth-right.</P>
<P>Poor Sinners! we talk not to you as on a Stage in customary words, and because that talking thus was our Trade; we are in as good earnest with you as if we saw you all Murdering yourselves, and we are persuading you to save your Lives. Can any Man be in a Jest with you who believeth God? Who by Faith foreseeth whither you are going, and what you lose, and where the Game of Sin will end? It is little better to jest now in Pulpit or in private, than to stand jesting over your departing Souls, when at Death <HI>you</HI> are Breathing <HI>out your</HI> last.</P>
<P>Alas! with Shame and Grief we do confess that we never speak to you of these things as their truth and weight deserve, nor with the Skill and Wisdom, the Affection and Fervency which beseemeth one engaged in the saving of poor Souls. But yet you may perceive that we are in good Sadness with you (for God is so) what else do we study for, labour for, suffer for, live for? Why else do we so much trouble ourselves, and trouble you with all this ado, and anger them that would have had us silent? For my own Part, I will make my free confession to you
<PB N="vii" REF="004663_0007_100DE88E09EDF248"/>
to my shame: That I never grew cold and dull, and pitiless to the Souls of others, till I first grew too cold and careless of my own (unless when weakness or speculative studies cool me, which I must confess they often do.) We never cease pitying you, till we are growing too like you, and so have need of Pity ourselves.</P>
<P>When, through the Mercy of my Lord, the Pro∣spect of the World of Souls which I am going to, hath any powerful Operation on myself; O then, I could spend and be spent for others. No Words are too earnest, no Labour too great, no Cost too dear, the Frowns and Wrath of malignant Opposers of the preaching of Christ's Gospel are nothing to me. But when the World of Spirits disappears, or my Soul is clouded, and receiveth not the vital illuminating Influences of Heaven, <HI>I grow cold,</HI> first to <HI>myself,</HI> then to others.</P>
<P>Come then poor Sinners, and help us who are willing at any rate to be your Helpers. As we first crave God's Help, so we next crave yours. Help us, for we cannot save you against your Wills, nor save you without your Consent and Help. God himself will not save you without you, and how should we? We know that the Devil is against us, &amp; will do his worst to hinder us, and so will all his Ministers by what Names or Titles soever dignified or distin∣guished. But all this is nothing, if you will but take our parts yourselves; I mean, if you will take Christ's part, and your own, and will not be against yourselves. Men and Devils cannot either help or hinder us in saving you, as you may do yourselves. If God and you be for us, who shall be against us?</P>
<P>And <HI>will you help us?</HI> Give over striving against God, and Conscience, give over fighting against Christ and his Spirit: Take part no more with the World and the Flesh, which in your Baptism you renounced. Set your Hearts to the Message which we bring you. Allow it your <HI>Man-like sober Thoughts,</HI> search the Scriptures, and see whether the things which we speak be so or no. We offer you
<PB N="viii" REF="004663_0008_100DE88F8E602148"/>
nothing but what we have resolvedly chosen our selves, and that after the most serious deliberation that we can make. We have looked round about us, to know what is the Happiness of Man: And had we found better for <HI>ourselves,</HI> we had offered better to you. If this World would have served our turns, it should have served yours also, and we would not have troubled you with the talk of <HI>another World;</HI> but it will not; I am sure it will never serve your turns, to make you happy, nor shall you long make that sorry, self-deceiving shift with it, as now you do.</P>
<P>But if you will not think of these things, if you will not use the Reason of Men, alas what can we do to save your Souls? O pity them, Lord, that they may pity themselves. Have Mercy on them, that they may have some more Mercy on themselves and us. Help them, that they may help themselves. If you still refuse, will not your loss be more than ours? If we lose our Labour, (which to ourselves we shall not) if we lose our hopes of your Salvati∣on, what is this to your everlasting Loss of Salva∣tion itself? and what are our Sufferings for your sakes, in comparison of your endless Sufferings?</P>
<P>But O, this is what breaketh our Hearts, that we leave you under more guilt than we found you; and when we have laid our Life and Labour to save you, the impenitent Souls must have their Pains in∣creased for the refusing of these Calls. And that it will be Part of your Hell to think forever how madly you refused our Counsel; and what Pains and Cost, and Patience were used to have saved you, and all in vain. It will be so, it must needs be so: Christ saith, <HI>It shall be easier for</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>in the Day of Judgment,</HI> than for the Re∣jecters of his Gospel-calls. The Nature of the <HI>thing,</HI> and the Nature of <HI>Justice</HI> certainly tell you, that it must be so</P>
<P>O turn not our Complaints to God against you; Turn us not from beseeching you to be reconciled to God, to tell him you will not be reconciled.
<PB N="ix" REF="004663_0009_100DE892DB9F0798"/>
Force us not to say, That we earnestly invited you to the Heavenly Feast, and you would not come. Force us not to say, That we earnestly invited you; <HI>Lord, we could have born all our Labour and Suffer∣ings for them, much easier, if they would but have yielded to thy Grace. But it was they themselves that broke our Hearts, that lost our Labour, that made us Preach and intreat in vain: It was easier to Preach without Maintenance than without Suc∣cess. It was they that were worse to us than all the Persecutors in the World. How oft would we have gathered them but they would not, but are unga∣thered still?</HI> How many Holy, Faithful Mini∣sters have I known these Eleven Years last past, who have lived in pining Poverty and Want, and hardly by Charity got Bread and Clothing, and yet if they could but have truly said, <HI>(Lord, the Sermons which I preach privately and in Danger, have won many Souls to thee)</HI> It would have made all their Burden easy. But I tell thee, senseless and Impenitent Sinner, thou that deniest God thy Heart, and them thy Conversion, which was the End of all their Labours, hast dealt much more cruelly with them, than they that denied the <HI>Le∣vite</HI> Bread.</P>
<P>Poor Sinners? I know that I am speaking all this to these that are <HI>dead in Sin,</HI> but it is a <HI>Death consisting</HI> with a <HI>Natural Life,</HI> which hath a <HI>Ca∣pacity of Spiritual Life.</HI> Or else I would no more speak to you than to a Stone. And I <HI>know</HI> that you are <HI>blind</HI> in <HI>Sin:</HI> But it is a <HI>Blindness consist∣ing</HI> with a <HI>Reasonable</HI> Faculty, which is capable of Spiritual <HI>Illumination;</HI> Or else I would no more perswade you than I do a Beast. And I <HI>know</HI> that <HI>you</HI> are in the Fetters <HI>of your own Lusts;</HI> your <HI>Wills,</HI> your <HI>Love,</HI> your <HI>Hearts</HI> are turned away from God, and strongly bewitched with the Dreams and Dalliances, with the Flesh and World. But your Wills are not forced to this Captivity. Surely those <HI>Wills</HI> may be changed by God's Grace, when you clearly see sufficient Reason for to change
<PB N="x" REF="004663_0010_100DE894828C86E0"/>
them: Else I would as soon preach (were I capa∣ble) to Devils and damned Souls. Your Case is not yet desperate. O make it not desperate. There is just the same Hope of your <HI>Salvation</HI> as there is of your <HI>Conversion</HI> and <HI>Perseverance,</HI> and no more; without it there is no Hope And with it you are safe, and have no cause to doubt and fear. Heaven may be yet yours, if <HI>you will.</HI> Nothing but your own Wills, refusing Christ and a Holy Life, can keep <HI>you</HI> out, and shall that do it? Shall Hell be <HI>your own choice?</HI> And <HI>will you (I say) will you not be saved?</HI></P>
<P>O think better what <HI>you do!</HI> God's Terms are reasonable, his Word and Ways are good and equal, Christ's Yoke is easy, and his Burden light, and his Commandments are not grievous to any, but so far as Blindness and a bad and backward Heart doth make them so. You have no true Reason to be un∣willing. God and Conscience shall one Day tell you and all the World, that you had no Reason for it. You may as wisely pretend Reason to cut your Throats, to torment yourselves, as plead Reason a∣gainst a true Conversion unto God. Were I per∣suading you not to kill yourselves, I would make no Question, but you will be persuaded; and yet must I be hopeless, when I persuade you from everlasting Misery, and not to prefer the World and Flesh <HI>before your Saviour</HI> and <HI>your God,</HI> and be∣fore a sure everlasting <HI>Joy? God forbid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> I take it for a great Mercy of God, that before my Head lieth down in the Dust, and I go to give up my Account unto my Judge; I have this Opportunity once more, earnestly to bespeak thee for thy own Salvation. I beg it of thee, as one that must shortly be called away, and speak to thee no more, till we come unto our endless State, that thou wouldest sometimes retire into thyself, and use the Reason of a Man, and look before thee, whi∣ther thou art going, and look behind thee, how thou hast lived, and what thou hast been doing in the World till now; and look within thee, what a Case thy Soul is in, and whether it be ready to enter
<PB N="xi" REF="004663_0011_100DE897B181A908"/>
upon Eternity; and look above thee, what a Hea∣ven of Glory thou dost neglect, and what a God thou hast to be thine everlasting <HI>Friend</HI> or <HI>Enemy,</HI> as thou choosest, and as thou livest, and that thou art always in his sight. Yea, and look below thee, and think where they are, that died unconverted. And when thou hast soberly thought of all these things, then do as God and true Reason shall direct the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And is this an unreasonable Request? I ap∣peal to God, and to all wise Men, and to thine own Conscience, when it shall be awakened, if I speak against thee, or if it be not true and sure, then re∣gard not what I say; if I speak not that Message which God hath commanded his Ministers to speak, then let it be refused as contemptuously as thou wilt. But if I do but in Christ's Name and stead beseech thee to be reconciled to God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19, 20. Re∣fuse it at thy Peril; and if God's beseeching thee shall not prevail against thy Sloth, Lust, thy Ap∣petite, against the Desires of thy Flesh, against the Dust and Shadows of the World, remember it when with fruitless Cries and Horror, thou art beseeching him too late.</P>
<P>I know poor Sinner that Flesh is brutish, and Lust and Appetite have no Reason. But I know that thou hast Reason thy self which was given thee to over-rule them; and that he that will not be a Man, cannot be a Saint, nor a happy Man. I know that thou livest in a tempting and a wicked World, where Things or Persons will be daily hindring this. But I know that this is no more to a Man that by Faith seeth Heaven and Hell before him, than a Grain of Sand is to a Kingdom, or a blast of wind to one that is fighting or flying for his Life, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.4 O Man! that thou didst but know the dif∣ference between that which the Devil and Sin will give thee, if thou wilt sell thy Soul and Heaven, and that which God hath promised and sworn to give thee, if thou wilt heartily give up thy self to him. I know thou mayst possibly fall into company (at least amongst some Sots and Drunkards) that will
<PB N="xii" REF="004663_0012_100DE8996C420848"/>
tell thee, all this is but troublesom Preciseness, and making more ado than needs But I know withall, what that Man deserveth, <HI>who will believe a Fool before his Maker</HI> (For he can be no better than a miserable <HI>Fool,</HI> that will contradict and revile the Word of God, even the Word of Grace, that would save Mens Souls.)</P>
<P>And alas, it is possible thou mayest hear some of the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> (or rather of <HI>Cain</HI>) deriding this <HI>Serious Godliness</HI> as mere <HI>Hypocrisy, Fantaticism,</HI> and <HI>Self-conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tedness:</HI> As if you must be no better than the Devil's Slaves, lest you be proud in thinking that you are better than they; that is, you must go with them to Hell, lest in Heaven ye be proud Hy∣pocrites, for thinking yourselves happier than they.</P>
<P>It may be they will tell you, that this talk of Con∣version is fitter for <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> to hear, than <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Protestants.</HI> Because such Mens <HI>Big∣looks</HI> or <HI>Coats</HI> may make the Poyson the easier ta∣ken down; I will intreat thee but as before God to answer these following Questions, or to get them answered, and then judge whether it be they or we that will deceive thee: And whether that as Men use to talk against Learning that have none them¦selves, so such Men prate not against Conversion and the Spirit of God, because they have no such thing themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. I pray ask them, whether it be a Pu∣ritan or Fanatick Opinion, that Men must die? And what all the Pomp, and Wealth &amp; Pleasures of the World would signify to a departing Soul? Ask them whether they will live on Earth for ever, and their merry Hours, and lordly Looks will have no End? And whether it be but the Con∣ceit of <HI>Hypocrites</HI> and <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> that their Carcase must be rotting in a darksome Grave?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Ask them whether Man hath not an im∣mortal Soul, and a longer Life to live when this is ended? <HI>Luke</HI> 12.41.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 3. Ask them whether Reason requires not eve∣ry Man to think more seriously of the Place or State
<PB N="xiii" REF="004663_0013_100DE89B93C3C8B0"/>
where he must be forever, than of that where he must be for a little while, and from whence he is posting Day and Night? and whether it be wiser to lay up our Treasure where we must stay, than where we must not stay, but daily look to be hasted away, and never more to be seen on Earth? <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.19, 20. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.16, 17, 18. &amp; 5.1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 4. Ask them whether God should not be loved with all our Heart, and Soul and Might? <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.27. And whether it be not the Mark of an un∣godly Miscreant, to be a Lover of Pleasure more than God, 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.4. and a Lover of this World above him? 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.15, 16. And whether we must not <HI>seek first God's Kingdom and his Righteous∣ness,</HI> Matth, 6.63. and <HI>labour most for the Meat that never perisheth,</HI> John 6 27. <HI>And strive to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> Luke 13.24, <HI>And gave all diligence to make our Calling and Election sure?</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 5. Ask them whether without Holiness any shall see God? <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.14. <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.8 <HI>Tit.</HI> 2 14. and whether the Carnal Mind is not Enmity to God; and to be carnally minded is not Death; and to be spiritually minded, Life and Peace? And whether if you live after the Flesh you shall not die, and be condemned? And they shall live and be saved that walk after the Spirit? And whether any Man be Christ's that hath not his Spirit? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13</P>

<P><PB N="xiv" REF="004663_0014_100DE8A09F7B47C8"/><HI>Q</HI> 7. Ask them whether it be credible or suitable to God's word or workings, that he that will not give them the Fruits of the Earth without their Labour, nor feed and clothe them without them∣selves, will yet bring them to Heaven without any Care, Desire or Labour of their own? when he hath bid them care not for the one, and called for their greatest Diligence for the other, <HI>Matth</HI> 6.23, 25, 33. <HI>John</HI> 6.27.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 8.

I mention not now the Drunkards and Flesh-pleasing Gentlemen, that live in Pride, Fulness and Idleness and Sport, and play away their precious Time; nor the filthy Fornicator, nor the merciless Oppressors, nor the malignant haters of a godly life, nor the perjured perfidious Betrayers of Mens Souls, and of the Gospel, or of their Country's good, nor such other Men of seared Conscience, whose Misery none questioneth, but such as are blind and miser∣able.

<P>Q. 11. <HI>Ask</HI> them whether in their Baptism (which is their Christning as a Covenant) they did not re∣nounce the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, and vow and deliver up themselves to God their Father, their Saviour and their Sanctifier? And whether all or most Men perform this Vow? And whether a perjured <HI>Covenant braker</HI> against God, is fitter for salvation than one that never was baptized?</P>
<P>Q. 12. <HI>Ask</HI> them whether the holy Nature of God be not so contrary to Sin, as that it is Blasphemy to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that he will bring to Heaven, and into the Bo¦som of his Eternal Delights, <HI>any unholy unrenewed Soul.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.</P>

<P>Q. 14. <HI>Ask</HI> them why they believe, and were bap∣tized into the <HI>Holy-Ghost;</HI> and whether a Man can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, that is not born of the <HI>Spirit</HI> as well as of <HI>Water,</HI> Joh. 3.3, 5, 6. and

<P>Q. 15 Ask them why Christ gave the World so many Warnings of the Damnableness of the <HI>Phari∣sees Hypocrisy,</HI> if Hypocritical Christians may be saved? and what were these <HI>Pharisees?</HI> They were the Masters of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church. The <HI>Rabbies</HI> that must have high Places, high Titles, and Ceremo∣nies, formal Garments, and must be reverenced of all: That gave God Lip-service without the heart, and made void his Commands, and worshipped him in vain, teaching for Doctrines the Command∣ments of Men, and strictly tythe the Mint and Cummin, while lovely Mercy and Justice were past by? Who worshipped God with an abundance of Ceremonies, and builded the Tombs, and garnish∣ed the Sepulchres of the Saints, while they killed and persecuted those that did imitate them, and ha∣ted the living Saints, and honoured the dead. They were the bitterest Enemies and Murderers of Christ, on pretence that he was a Blasphemer, and a sediti∣ous Enemy to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and the common Peace, and one that spake against the Temple: They were the greatest Enemies of the Apostles, and silencers of those that preached Christ's Gospel, and persecuted them that called upon his Name. And had these no need of <HI>Conversion,</HI> because they could say, God is our Father (when the Devil was their Father, <HI>John</HI> 8.44) and that they were <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Seed? and are not Hypocritical Christians, drunken Christians, fornicating Christians, carnal, worldly infidel Chri∣stians, false-named hypocritical Christians, as bad, yea worse, as they abuse a more excellent Pro∣fession? <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.7, 8 and 22.18. and 6.2. <HI>&amp;c.

<P>Q. 17 What is the difference between the <HI>Church</HI> and the World? Is not the Church a Holy Society of regenerate Souls? Yea, the Church visible, is on∣ly those that in Baptism vow Holiness and profess it: Look those Hypocrites in the Face, and see whe∣ther they do not blush, when they repeat in the Creed <HI>I believe in the Holy Ghost, I believe in the Holy Catholick Church, and the Communion of Saints,</HI> who shall have the <HI>forgiveness of Sins,</HI> and <HI>Life ever∣lasting?</HI> Ask them whether they mean Holy Adul∣terers, holy Worldlings, holy perjur'd Persons? Ask them whether they mean a holy Communion of Saints in a Tavern, in a Play house, in a Gam∣ing house, in a Whore house, or a Jesting, canting Stage play Communion If the Church be holy, be holy if you will be of the Church. If it be a Communion of Saints, make it not a Communion of Swine, and make not Saints and their Commu∣nion seem odious either for their Infirmities or their Crossness to your Carnal Interests or Conceits.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 18 Ask them whether there be a Heaven and a Hell or not? If not, why are they pretended Christians? If there be, will God send one Man to Heaven and another to Hell, to so vast, so amaz∣ing a difference of States, if there be no great difference betwixt them here! If holiness no more differenced Christians from others, than saying a Sermon, or saying over a Prayer, doth difference one from an Infidel, where were the Justice of God, in saying some and damning of others? And what were Christianity better than the Religion of <HI>An∣tony, Plato, Socrates, Seneca, Cicero, Plutarch,</HI> if not much worse!

of each Passenger in a Glass, and to the Peri∣wig-shops, and see a wooden Head with a Peri∣wig on the Block, and you have seen something like the difference of a holy Soul, and of a dead and dressed formal Hypocrite, <HI>Psalm</HI> 33.77.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 19. Ask them whether Kings and all Men make not a great difference between Man and Man: the Loyal and Perfidious, the Obedient and the Disobedient? And whether they difference not themselves between a Friend and a Foe, one that loveth them, and one that robbeth or would kill them? And shall not the most holy GOD make more difference between the Righteous and the wicked? <HI>Malachy</HI> 8.17, 18.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 20. But if they are dead in every Point save to Carnal Interests, ask them whether they are <HI>Preachers</HI> or <HI>Priests?</HI> And if Conversion and Holi∣ness be a needless thing, what use they themselves are of? And why the Country must be troubled with them, and pay them Tythes, and owe them Reverence? when these twenty Questions are well answered, conclude that you may be saved without Conversion.</P>
<P>But if, poor Soul, thou art fully convinced, and asketh, <HI>What shall I do to be converted?</HI> The Lord make thee willing, and save thee from <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> and I will quickly tell thee in some few words.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Give not over sober thinking of these things,</HI> till thy Heart be changed, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119 59.</P>

<P>Pity, O Lord, and perswade these Souls: Let not Christ's Blood, his Doctrine, his Example, his Spirit be lost unto them, and they lost for ever. Let not Heaven be as no Heaven to them, while they dream and dote on the shadows of the world. And O save this Land from the greater Destructi∣on than all our late Plagues and Flames, and Divisions, which our sins and thy threatnings make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fear.

<P>Having thus contributed my Endeavour in this Preface, to the furtherance of the design of this excellent Book; I must tell thee, Reader, that I take it for an Honour to commend so masculine a Birth unto the world. The Midwife of <HI>Alexander</HI> or <HI>Aristotle</HI> need not be ashamed of her Office. Who the Author of this Treatise was, how he preached, how he lived, how suffered, (and for what) and how he died, his Life and Letters lately printed fully tell you. And I earnestly commend the Reading of them to all, especially to Ministers, not to tell them what Men have been here forbid∣den to preach Christ's Gospel, and for what, nor what Men they are that so many Years have done it, or to tell you what Men Christ's Ministers should be. But say not, he killed himself with excessive Labour, and therefore I will take warning, and take my ease, For, 1. He lived in perfect Health all his days, notwithstanding all his Labours, till after his hard and long Imprisonment. 2. It was not the greatest Labours of his Times of Liberty that hurt him, but his preaching six or seven or eight Times in a week, after that he was silenced, because he could not speak to all his People at
<PB N="xx" REF="004663_0020_100DE8ADA714E9D0"/>
once. Make not an ill use of so excellent Example <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay not like <HI>Judas, what need this waste!</HI> His La∣bour, his Life, his Sufferings, his Death, were not in vain. The Ages to come that read his Life, and read this little popular Treatise, and his <HI>Call to Archippus,</HI> shall say, They were not in vain. And tho' he was cut off in the midst of his Age, and his longer Labours, and more elaborate Writings thus prevented, take thankfully this small but metho∣dical warm and serious Tractate. Read it seriously, and it cannot be but it must do thee good.</P>
<P>I am one that have lookt into Books and Scien∣ces, and Speculations of many sorts, and seriously tell thee as a dying Man, that after all my Searches and Experiences, I have found that Philosophical Enquiries into the Divine Artifices, and the Nature of Things, hath among a great Number of Un∣certainties, a great many Pretty Probabilities which a holy Soul can make good Use of in admiring GOD, and may find us a lawful kind of Sport; but in the Moralities which <HI>Atheists</HI> count Uncertain∣ties, the Knowlege of GOD, and our Hopes, the Doctrine and Practice of Holiness, Temperance, and Charity, and Justice, and the diligent seeking, and joyful hopes of Life Everlasting, is all the true Wisdom, Goodness, the Rest and Comfort of a Soul; whatever be our Plea, this is the satisfying certainty, thy Business, and the beautifying Im∣provement of our selves.</P>
<P>I have done when I have sought to remove a little Scandal, which I foresaw, that I should my self write the Preface to his Life, where himself and two of his Friends make such a mention of my Name, which I cannot own; which will seem a praising him for praising me. I confess it looketh ill-sa∣vouredly in me: But I had not the Power of other Mens Writings, and durst not therefore forbear that which was his due. Had I directed their Pens, they should have gone a middle way and only esteem∣ed me a very unworthy Servant of Christ, (who yet
<PB N="xxi" REF="004663_0021_100DE8AF365397C0"/>
longs to see the Peace and Prosperity of his Church) and should have forborn their undeserved Praise, as other Men should have done their slanderous Li∣bels. But if the Reader get no harm by it, I assure him the use I made of it was, to lament that I am really so much the worse then they esteemed me, and fear lest I should prove yet worse than I discern my self, who see so much Sin and Weakness in my Betters, and much more in my self, as to make it the constant Sentiment of my Soul, that Pride of Mens Greatness, Wisdom and Goodness, is the first Part of the Devil's Image on Man's Soul, and the Dark∣ness is the second, and Malignity the Third.</P>

<P>HOw well were it if there were no more uncon∣verted ones among us, than those to whom this is directed!

And how little Hopes is there that this Excellent Trea∣tise should reach its End, with those who apprehend themselves not concerned in it? Art not thou one of them? Art thou a Convert, or art thou yet in thy sins? What is sin? What is Conversion? It may be thou canst tell me neither, and yet a Convert thou sayest thou art; but to what purpose is it then like to be, for the Servant of God to treat with thee about this Matter? Let him bid thee believe, thou art a Believer already; Let him bid thee repent and turn to the Lord, that work thou sayest is not

now to do; what can there be said to this Man that's like to bring him to good? Friend, know thy self better, or thou perishest with out Remedy. Thou mayest pray, but what hope is there in thy Pray∣ing: Thou mayest read, but what Hope is there in thy Reading? Yet read on, this little hope there is, in this Book there is <HI>Eye salve</HI> that may heal thee of thy Blindness. In this Book there is a <HI>Glass,</HI> that will shew thee thy Face. Dost thou know thine own Face when thou seest it? Behold thy very I∣mage in those Marks that are given of an uncon∣verted Person. Read and consider them, and then say, if thou be not the Man.</P>
<P>Be willing to know thy self, and to know the worst of thy Case. Wink not at the Light; hide not thy self from thine own Soul. Wilt thou never know thy Disease till it be past remedy?</P>
<P>Much of our hardest Work would be over, if we could see the Sinners to whom we are sent, to be convinced Sinners: If we could but open the blind Eyes, there were hopes we should shortly raise the Dead.</P>
<P>Sinner, of a truth thou art in evil case, whether thou know it or not; thou art among the dead, and there is but a step betwixt thee and Hell. Thou wilt not believe it though it be told thee; yet once again let me beseech thee, come to the Glass that is here presented to thee, and narrowly observe whether the very Marks of the Dead be not found upon thee.</P>
<P>If there be miscarriage in this first work, if thou wilt not understand thy Misery, and thy danger, there is an end of all hopes concerning thee. Whilst Self-ignorance abides upon thee, all the Counsels that are necessary for a Man in thy case, will do thee no good, they are never like to prosper with thee, because thou wilt not count them proper for thee. Who will be perswaded to do that which he believes is already done? Who will take the Counsel of the Physician that does not think himself sick? The Man of God may spare his pains of perswad∣ing thee to Conversion, whilst thou art confident
<PB N="xxiii" REF="004663_0023_100DE8B618767B50"/>
thou art converted already: Who will be at the pains of Repentance that concludes he hath re∣pented? who will bear the Labour and the Pangs of the New Birth, that is confident he is already passed from Death to Life.</P>
<P>But Friend, let me a little reason with thee; thou art confident it is well with thee, yet why wilt thou not yield to thus much at least, to put it to the que∣stion, <HI>Am I not mistaken?</HI> Thou art worse than mad, if thou thinkest such a Question may not be put. Dost thou know that thy Heart is false and de∣ceitful, and yet because it speaks good conerning thee, must it not be questioned whether it speaks truth or no? Be so wise as to conclude, <HI>I may be mistaken,</HI> and thus come to the Trial whether thou art mistaken or not.</P>
<P>And if upon Trial by the Marks that are before thee, thou come to be undeceived, and see thy self wrapped up in that Misery which hitherto thou wouldest not suspect, the next news <HI>I expect</HI> to hear from thee is, <HI>What must I do to be sav'd?</HI> O were it come to that once, Then thou hast an answer at hand in those means thou wilt find prescribed thee. And because they are such as thou wilt hardly be per∣swaded to use, take in the Motives that follow, and these will help down the means Consider both the one and the other, and if thou dost not find the means proper, and the motives weighty, I think I shall do thee no wrong, if I tell thee, thou art still of a blind Mind, and an harder Heart.</P>
<P>The matter which this little Book comes to treat with thee about, is of the highest Importance; 'Tis a matter of Life or Death. If thou sayest the Terms upon which Life is offered, are hard; consider, is it not harder to die? He is worthy to die who will lose his Soul to save his Labour. If thou could step down into the deep, and take a turn or two with those damned Souls who are drenched with Fire and Brimstone, and bound in everlasting chains of vengeance, and should ask them now what do you think of the Terms upon which Life was offered?
<PB N="xxiv" REF="004663_0024_100DE8B876970D48"/>
Now, what think you o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Repentance, of that Obedience, of that Circumspection, Self denial, and the greatest Severity, which by the Gospel were imposed upon you? If you might once again have the same terms granted you for your Redemption from this place of torment, would you yet say hard terms! Let me rather die this death for ever, than live such a Life▪ let me broil in this furnace, rather then escape with such difficulty. Shouldest thou ask them thus that have felt what it is to be damned, what answer dost thou think they would make? <HI>O Friend, never again groan under the difficulties of Con∣version till thou believe them to be worse than Hell.</HI> But I will not further anticipate my worthy Author.</P>
<P>Nor is there much need I should commend either himself or his Work; for the Author himself thou mayest at a small charge get acquaintance with him in that History of his Life and Death, which is extant, concerning which I shall only say,
<Q>Sic mihi contigat vivere sicque mori.</Q></P>
<P>And for this work of his, what Commendation I shall give of it, would be needful no longer than till thou hast read it over. Thou wilt find such wine in it as needs no bush.

<P>DEarly Beloved, and longed for; I gladly ac∣knowledge my self a Debtor to you all; and am concerned, as I would be found a good Steward to the Houshold of God, to give to every one his Portion. But the Physician is most solicitous for those Patients, whose Case is most doubtful and hazardous; and the Father's Bowels are especially turned towards his dying Child. The Numbers of the Unconverted Souls among you, call for my most earnest Compassions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asty Diligence, to pluck them out of the Burning. <HI>Jude</HI> 23. and therefore to these <HI>First</HI> I shall apply my self in these Lines.</P>
<P>But whence shall I fetch my Arguments, or how shall I choose my Words? Lord, wherewith shall I woo them? wherewith shall I win them? Oh, that I could but tell! I would write unto them in Tears, I would weep out every Argument, I would empty my Veins for Ink, I would petition them on my Knees; verily (were I able) I would. Oh, how thankful I would be, if they would be pre∣vailed with to repent and turn!</P>

might you make me, if you would but hearken to me, and suffer me to carry you over to Jesus Christ!</P>
<P><Q>But, Lord, how insufficient am I for this work! I have been many a Year wooing for Thee, but the Damsel would not go with me Lord, what a Task hast thou set me to do? Alas, wherewith shall I pierce the Scales of <HI>Leviathan,</HI> or make the Heart to feel that it is hard as a Stone, hard as a Piece of the Nether-milstone! Shall I go and lay my Mouth to the Grave, and look when the Dead will obey me, and come forth? Shall I make an Oration to the Rocks, or declaim to the Moun∣tains, and think to move them with Arguments? Shall I give the blind to see?

But Thou, O Lord, canst pierce the Scales and prick the Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Sinner.

Now set your selves to seek him Now set up the Lord Jesus in your Hearts, and set him up in your Houses: Now come in and kiss the Son, <HI>Psalm</HI> 2.12. and embrace the Tenders of Mercy. Touch his Sceptre and live; why will you die? I beg not for my self; but fain I would have you happy: This is the Prize I run for, and the white I aim at. My Soul's Desire and prayer for you is, that you may be saved, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.1.</P>
<P>The Famous <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> having instituted most strict and wholesome Laws for his People, told them he was necessitated to go a Journey from them, and got them to bind themselves in an Oath, that his Laws should be observed till his return. This done, he went into a voluntary Banishment, and never returned more, that they might, by vertue of their Oath, be engaged to the perpetual ob∣serving of his Laws. Methinks I should be glad of the hard Conditions which he endured (tho' I love you tenderly) so I might but hereby engage you throughly to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Dearly beloved, would you rejoice the Heart of your Minister? Why then, embrace the Counsels of the Lord by me: forego your Sins: set to Pra∣yer: up with the Worship of God in your Families: keep at a distance from Corruptions of the Times. What greater joy to a Minister, than to hear of Souls born unto Christ by him, and that his Chil∣dren walk in Truth? 2 <HI>John</HI> 4.</P>

But how much better are the Wounds of a Friend, than the fair Speeches of the Harlot, who flattereth with her Lips, till the Dart strike through the Li∣ver, and hunteth for the precious Life! <HI>Prov</HI> 7.21, 22, 23. and <HI>Prov</HI> 6.26.

<P N="2">2. <HI>It is not the being washed in the Laver of Regener∣ation,</HI> or putting on the Badge of Christ in Baptism. Many take the Press-money, and wear the Livery of Christ, that yet never stand to their Colours, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> follow the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Leader. <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> and <HI>Magus,</HI> were baptized, as well as the rest. How fondly do many mistake here, deceiving, and be∣ing deceived! dreaming that effectual Grace is ne∣cessarily tied to the external Administration of Baptism (which, what is it, but to revive the Popish Tenent, of the Sacraments working Grace, <HI>ex opere</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) and so every Infant shall be regenerated, not only <HI>(Sacramento tenus)</HI> sacramentally, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ally and properly. Hence Men do fancy, that be∣ing regenerated already, when baptized, they need no farther work</P>
<P>But if this were so, then all that were baptized (in their Infancy) must necessarily be saved? be∣cause the Promise of pardon and Salvation is made to Conversion and Regeneration.</P>
<P><HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.4. <HI>Matth.</HI> 19.28. Our calling Sanctification (as to the beginnings of it) or Con∣version (which are but the same things, under dif∣ferent Conceptions and Expressions) is but a mid∣dle link in the golden Chain, fastned to Election at the one end, and Glorification at the other, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. 2 <HI>Thess</HI> 2.13. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2 The Silver to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d may not be broken, nor the connexion between Sanctification and Salvation, between Grace and Glory, impiously violated, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.8.

And if the very Regenerate may perish at last in their Sins, we will no more say, that he that is born of God, his Seed remaineth in him, and that he cannot sin, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.9. <HI>i. e.</HI> unto Death, nor that it is impossible to deceive the very Elect, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>And indeed, were this true, we need look no

f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther to see our names written in Heaven, than on∣ly to search the Register, and see whether we were baptized: Then I would keep the Certificate of my Baptism, as my fairest Evidence for Heaven, and should come by assurance of my gracious state, with a we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Finger: Then Men should do well to carry but a Certificate of their Baptism, under the Regi∣ster's Hand, when they died, (as the Philosopher would be buried with the Bishop's Bond in his hand, which he had given him for receiving his Alms in another World;) and upon sight of this, there were no doubt of their admission into Heaven.</P>
<P>In short, if there be no more necessary to Conver∣sion or Regeneration, than to be turned to the Chri∣stian Religion, or to be baptized in Infancy, this will fly directly in the Face of that Scripture, <HI>Matt.</HI> 7.14. as well as multitudes of others. For <HI>First, W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will then no more say, <HI>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way;</HI> for if all that were baptized, &amp; of true Religion, are saved, the door is become heavenly wide, and we will henceforth say, Wide is the gate, &amp; broad is the way that leadeth unto life; for if this be true, whole Parishes, yea, whole countries, &amp; whole kingdoms may go in a breast; and we will no more teach, that the righteous is scarcely saved, or that there is need of such a sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in taking the king∣dom of Heaven by Violence, and striving to enter in. Surely if the way be so easy as many make it, that there is little more necessary, than to be regenerated in our Baptism, and cry God-a-Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy, and be ab∣solved by the Minister at our end; 'tis more ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then needs to put our selves to such running and seeking, &amp; knocking, &amp; fighting, &amp; wrestling, as the word requires as necessary for Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If this be true, we will no more say, <HI>Few there be that find it;</HI> yea we will rather say, <HI>Few there he that miss it:</HI> We will no more say, that of the many that are called, <HI>but few are chosen,</HI> Matth. 22 14 <HI>and that</HI> even of the professing <HI>Israel, but a rem∣nant shall he saved,</HI> Rom. 11.5. If this Doctrine be true, we will not say any more with the Disciple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="9" REF="004663_0033_100DE8CE79FCECC8"/>
<HI>who then shall be saved?</HI> but rather, who then shall not be saved? Then if a Man be called a Brother, (that is, a Christian) and be baptized, tho' he be a Forni¦cator, or a Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, or covetous, or a Drunkard, yet he shall inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 Cor. 5.11.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Arminian</HI> will reply, Such as these, tho' they did receive regenerating Grace in Baptism, are since fallen away, and must be renewed again, or else they cannot be saved.</P>
<P>I answer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That there is an infallible connexion between regeneration and Salvation, as we have al∣ready shewed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten to be farther evidencing, but that 'tis against designed brevity. 2. Then Men must be born again, which carries a great deal of absurdity in its very Face. And why may not Men be twice born in Nature, as well as in Grace? Why not as great an absurdity to be twice regenerated, as to be twice generated? But 3. and above all, This grants however the thing I contend for, that whatever Men do, or pretend to receive in Baptism, if they be found afterwards to be grosly ignorant, or profane, or for∣mal, without the Power of Godliness, they must be born again, or else be shut out of the Kingdom of God. So then they must have more to plead for them¦selves, than their Baptismal Regeneration.</P>
<P>Well, in this you see all are agreed, that be it more or less that is received in Baptism, if (when Men come to years) they are evidently unsanctified, they must be renewed again by a thorough and powerful change, or else they cannot escape the damnation of Hell. Friends and Brethren, be not deceived, God is not mocked, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.7. whether it be your Baptism, or whatever else that you pretend, I tell you from the living God, that if any of you be prayerless Per∣sons, <HI>John</HI> 15.14. or unclean, or malicious, or co∣vetous, or riotous, or a Scoffer, or a lover of evil Company, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.20. In a word, if you are not holy, strict and self-denying Christians, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.14. <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.24. you cannot be saved, except you be transformed by a further Work upon you, and re∣newed again by Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004663_0034_100DE8D1C141EA28"/>Thus I have shewed, that it is not enough to evi∣dence a Man to be regenerate, that he hath been baptized, effectual grace not necessarily accompany∣ing Baptism, as some have vainly asserted. But I must answer one Objection before I pass.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> The Sacraments do certainly attain their ends, where Man doth not <HI>ponere obicem,</HI> or lay some obstruction, which Infants do not.</P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> I answer, it is not the end of Baptism, to rege∣nerate, 1. Because then there would be no Reason, why it should be confined only to the seed of Belie∣vers, for both the Law of God and the Nature of Charity, requires us to use the Means of Conversion for all, as far as we can have Opportunity. Were this true, no such Charity as to catch the Children of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> and baptize them, and dispatch them to Heaven out of hand, like the bloody wretches that made the poor Protestants (to save their Lives) to swear they would come to Mass, and that they would never depart from it, and then put them forth∣with to Death, saying, <HI>They would hang them while in a good mind.</HI> 2. Because it presupposeth Regeneration, and therefore cannot be intended to confer it. In all the express Instances in Scripture, we find that Bap∣tism doth suppose their repenting, believing, re∣ceiving the Holy Ghost, <HI>Acts.</HI> 8 37. &amp; 2.38. and 10.37. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. And to imagine, that Baptism was instituted for an end of which not one of the first Subjects was capable (for they were all adult Persons, and supposed to have Faith and Repentance ac∣cordingly as they professed, and their Children were not baptized till after them, in their Right) were no little absurdity. Were this Doctrine true, Baptism would make Disciples; but we find it doth bespeak them such before hand, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19.3. Because Bap∣tism, being but a Seal of the Covenant, canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> convey the Benefits, but according to the tenour of the Covenant, to which it is set.</P>
<P>Now the Covenant is conditional, therefore the Soul conveys conditionally. The Covenant re∣quires Faith and Repentance, as the condition of the
<PB N="11" REF="004663_0035_100DE8D4175CC238"/>
grand Benefits, Pardon, and Life, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.31. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.19. And what the Covenant doth not convey, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t upon these Conditions, the Seal cannot. So that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptism doth presuppose Faith and Repentance in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he subject, without which, it neither doth, nor can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvey the saving Benefits; otherwise the Seal should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvey contrary to the Tenour of the Covenant to which it is affixed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It lies not in a moral Righteousness.</HI> This exceeds not the righteousness of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and therefore cannot bring us to the Kingdom of God, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.20 <HI>Paul,</HI> while unconverted, touching the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighteousness which is in the Law, blameless, <HI>Phil.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.6.

Luke 18.11. Thou must have something more than all this to shew, or else (however thou mayest justify thy self) God will condemn thee. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondemn not Morality, but warn you not to rest here: Piety includes Morality, as Christianity doth Hu∣manity, and Grace Reason, but we must not divide the Tables.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>It consists not in an external conformity to the Rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Piety.</HI> 'Tis too manifest, Men may have a Form of godliness, without the power, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5.

They must have more to plead for themselves, than that they keep to their Church, and give Alms, and make use of prayer, to prove themselves sound Converts. No outward service, but an Hypocrite may do it; even to the giving all his Goods to the Poor, and his Members to the Fire, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.3.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It lies not in the chaining up of Corruption, by edu∣cation, human laws, or the course of incumbent affliction.</HI> 'Tis too common and easy to mistake Education for Grace; but if this were enough, who a better Man than <HI>Jehoash?</HI> While <HI>Jehoiadah</HI> his Uncle lived, he was very forward in God's Service, and calls upon

<P N="6">6. <HI>In short, it consists not in illumination or conviction; in a superficial change, or partial reformation:</HI> An <HI>Apostate</HI> may be a Man enlightned, <HI>Heb</HI> 6 4. &amp; a <HI>Felix</HI> tremble under Convictions, <HI>Acts.</HI> 24.25 and a <HI>Heord</HI> amend many things. <HI>Mark</HI> 6.20. 'Tis one thing to have Sin alarm'd only by Convictions, and another to have it captivated and crucified by Converting Grace. Many, because they have been troubled in Conscience for their Sins, think well of their case: miserably mistaking Conviction for Conversion.

Others think, that because they have given off their riotous courses, and are broken off from evil Company or some particular lust, and reduced to sobriety, and civility, they are now no other than real Converts; forgetting that there is a vast Difference between being sanctified, and civilized; and that many seek to enter into the kingdom of Heaven, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.24. and are not far from it, <HI>Mark</HI> 12.34. and arrive to the <HI>almost</HI> of Christianity, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.28. and yet fall short at last: While Conscience holds the whip over them, many will pray, hear, and read, and forbear their delightful sins; but no sooner is this Lion asleep, but they are at their vomit again.

So a Man my pass through divers transmutations, from Ignorance to Knowledge, from Profaneness to Civility, thence to a form of Religion; and all this while he is but carnal and unregenerate, while his Nature remains unchanged.</P>
<P><HI>Application. Hear then, O Sinners, hear; as you would live, so come and hear,</HI> Isa. 55.3. Why would you so wilfully deceive your selves, or build your Hopes upon the Sand? I know he shall find hard work of it, that goes to pluck away your hopes. It cannot but be ungrateful to you, and truly it is not pleasing to me. I set about it as a Surgeon, when to cut off a putrified Member from his well-beloved Friend; which of force he must do, but with an aking heart, a pitiful Eye, a trembling Hand. But understand me, Brethren, I am only taking down the ruinous House, (which will otherwise speedily fall of it self, and bury you in the rubbish,) that I may build fair, and strong, and firm for ever. The Hope of the wicked shall perish, if God be true of his word, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.7. And wert not thou better, O Sinner, to let the Word convince thee now in time, and let go thy false and self-deluding Hopes, than to have Death too late to open thine Eyes, and find they self in Hell, before thou are aware? I should be a false and faithless Shepherd, if I should not tell you, that you who have built your hopes upon no better grounds then these fore-mentioned, are yet in your Sins. Let your Conscience speak; What is it that you have to plead for your selves? Is it that you wear Christ's Livery? that you bear his Name? that you are of the visible Church? that you have knowledge in the points of Religion; are civilized, perform Re∣ligious Duties, are just in your Dealings, have been troubled in Conscience for your Sins? I tell you from the Lord, these Pleas will never be accepted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> God's Bar. All this, tho' good in it self, will not prove you converted, and so will not suffice to

your Salvation. Oh look about you, &amp; bethink your selves of turning speedily and soundly. Set to Pray∣ing, and to Reading, and studying your own Hearts; rest not, till God hath made thorow work with you; for you must be other Men or else you are lost Men.</P>
<P>But if these be short of Conversion, what shall I say of the profane Sinner; It may be he will scarce cast his Eyes, or lend his Ears to this Discourse. But if there be any such reading, or within hearing, he must know from the Lord that made him, that he is far from the Kingdom of God. May a Man be civi∣lized, and not converted? where then shall the Drun∣kard, and Glutton appear? May a Man keep Com∣pany with the wise Virgins, &amp; yet be shut out? shall not a companion of fools much more be destroyed? <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.20. May a Man be true and just in his deal∣ing, and yet not be justified of God? What then will become of thee, O wretched Man, whose Conscience tells thee thou art false in thy Trade, and false of thy word, and mak'st thy advantage by a lying Tongue? If Men may be enlightned, and brought to the perfor∣mance of Holy Duties, and yet go down to perdition for resting in them, and sitting down on this side of Conversion; what will become of you, O miserable Families, that live as without God in the World? &amp; of you, O wretched Sinners, with whom God is scarce in all your Thoughts; that are so ignorant, that you cannot, or so careless, that you will not pray? O repent and be converted! break off your Sins by righteousness, away to Christ for pardoning and renewing Grace; give up your selves to him, walk with him in Holiness, or else you shall neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see God.

<HEAD><HI>Chap. II.</HI> Shewing positively what Conversion is.</HEAD>
<P>I May not leave you with your Eyes half open, as he that saw Men as Trees walking, <HI>Mark</HI> 8.24. The Word is profitable for Doctrine, as well as Reproof. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. And therefore having thus far conducted you by the shelves and rocks of so many dangerous Mistakes, I would guide yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at length into the Harbour of Truth.</P>
<P>Conversion then, in short, lies in the thorough Change both of the Heart and Life. I shall briefly describe it in its Nature and Causes.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>The Author of it is the Spirit of God;</HI> and therefore it is called the sanctification of the Spirit, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.13. and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. Yet not excluding the other Persons in the <HI>Trinity:</HI> For the Apostle teacheth us, to bless the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for that he hath begotten us again, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1.3. and Christ is said to give Re∣pentance to <HI>Israel, Acts</HI> 5.31. and is called the ever∣lasting Father, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9 6. and we his Seed, and the Children which God hath given him, <HI>Heb</HI> 2.13. <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.10. O blessed Birth! Seven Cities, contend∣ed for the Birth of <HI>Homer:</HI> but the whole Trinity fathers the new Creature. Yet is this Work princi∣pally ascribed to the Holy Ghost, and so we are said to be born of the Spirit, <HI>John</HI> 3.8.</P>
<P>So then it is a work above Man's power. We are born, not of the will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God, <HI>John</HI> 1.13. Never think thou canst convert thy self: If ever thou wouldst be fa∣vingly converted, thou must despair of doing it in thine own strengh; <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.18. It is a Resurrection from the Dead, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.5. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1. a new creati∣on, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.15. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. a Work of absolute Om∣nipotency, <HI>Eph.</HI> 19. Are these out of the reach of Human power? If thou hast no more than thou hadst by thy First-birth, a good Nature, a meek and chaste Temper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thou art a very strang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to true Con∣version. This is a supernatural W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="004663_0040_100DE8E013925488"/>2. <HI>The moving Cause is Internal, or External.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The internal mover is only Free grace; not by works of righteousness which we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne, but of his own Mer∣cy he saved us — by the renewing of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Titus 3.5. <HI>Of his own Will began he us,</HI> James 1. We are chosen and called unto Sanctification, not for it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4.</P>
<P>God finds nothing in a Man to turn his Heart, but to turn his Stomach; enough to provoke his loa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h∣ing, nothing to provoke his love Look back upon thy self, O Christian: Take thy verminous Rags: Look upon thy self in thy blood, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.6. Oh, reflect upon thy swinish Nature, thy filthy swill, thy once beloved mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2 Canst thou think, without loathing, of thy trough and draugh?

Grace! <HI>Zech</HI> 4.7 Hear and blush, you Children of the most High: O you unthankful Generation! that Free grace is no more in your Mouths, in your thoughts; no more adored, admired, commended by such as you. One would think you should be nothing but praising and admiring God, whatever you are. How can you mak a shift to forget such Grace, or to pass it over with a slight and seldom mention! What but Free-grace should move God to love you, unless enmity could do it, or deformity could do it, unless vomit or rottenness could do it? How affectionately doth <HI>Peter</HI> lift up his Hands? <HI>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who of his abundant Mercy hath begotten us again,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.3. How feel∣ingly doth <HI>Paul</HI> magnify the Free-mercy of God in it. <HI>God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s rich in Mercy, for his great Love where∣with

he loved us, hath quickned us together with Christ? by Grace ye are saved,</HI> Eph. 2.4, 5.</P>
<P><HI>The external Mover is the Merit &amp; Intercession of the blessed Jesus.</HI> He hath obtained gifts for the rebel∣lious, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.18. and through him it is, that God worketh in us what is well-pleasing in his sight, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.21. Through him are all spiritual Blessings be∣stowed upon us in heavenly things, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.3. He in∣terceedeth for the Elect that believe not <HI>John</HI> 17.20. Every Convert is the fruit of his Travel, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.11. Oh, never was Infant born into the World with that difficulty that Christ endured for us! How empha∣tically he groaneth in his travail! All the Pains that he suffer'd on his Cross, they were our Birth pains, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.24 <HI>odinas,</HI> the pulls and throws that Christ endured for us. He is made Sanctification to us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. He sanctified himself (that is, set apart himself as a Sacrifice) that we may be sanctified, <HI>John.</HI> 17 19 We are sanctified through the Offer∣ing of his Body once for all, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.10.</P>
<P>'Tis nothing then without his own Bowels, but the Merit and Intercession of Christ, that prevails with God to bestow on us converting grace. If thou art a new creature, thou knowest to whom thou ow∣est it, to Christ's Pangs and Prayers. Hence the na∣tural affection of a Believer to Christ. The Foal doth not more naturally run after the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, nor the Suckling to the Dugs, than a Believer to Jesus Christ. And whither else shouldst thou go? If any in the World can shew that for thy Heart that Christ can, let them carry it. Doth Satan put in, doth the World court thee? Doth Sin sue for thy Heart? Why, were these crucified for thee? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.13. O Christian, love and serve the Lord whilst thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast a Being. Do not even the <HI>Publicans</HI> love those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat love them?

Ministers are they that are sent to open Mens Eyes, and to turn them to God, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18.</P>
<P>O unthankful World, little do you know what you are doing, while you are persecuting the Messengers of the Lord: These are they whose Business is (un∣der Christ) to save you. Whom have you reproach∣ed and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalt∣ed your Voice, and lifted your Eyes on high? <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.23. Those are the Servants of the most high God, that shew unto you the way of Salvation, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.17. and do you thus requite them, O foolish and un∣wise; <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.6.

These are the Instruments that God useth to convert and save you, and do you spit in the Face of your Physicians, and throw your Pilots over board? <HI>Fa∣ther forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Instrument Real is the Word.</HI> We were begotten by the Word of Truth: This is it that enlightens the Eyes, that converteth the Soul, <HI>Psalm</HI> 19.7, 8. that maketh wise to Salvation, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15. This is the incorruptible Seed, by which we are born again, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1.23. If we are washed, 'tis by the Word, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.26. If we are sanctified, 'tis through the Truth, <HI>John</HI> 17.17. This regenerates Faith, and regenerates us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.17. <HI>James</HI> 1.18.</P>
<P>O ye Saints, how shuold ye love the Word? For by this you have been converted: O ye Sinners, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow should you ply the Word? for by this you must be converted: No other ordinary Means but this.

Perverse Sinner, wilt thou be∣gin where thou shouldst end? Is not the word before thee?

<P>More particularly this Change of conversion passes throughout the whole Subject. A Carnal Person may have some Shreds of good Morality, a little near the list; but he is never good throughout the whole cloth, the whole Body of Holiness and Chri∣stianity; Feel him a little further near the Ridge, and you shall see him to be but a deceitful Piece. Conversion is no repairing of the old Building, but it takes all down, and erects a new Structure: It is not the putting in a patch, or sowing on a List of Holiness: but with the true Convert, Holiness is woven into all his Powers, Principles, and Practice. The sincere Christian is quite a new Fabrick, from the Foundation to the Top stone, all Fire-new. He is a new Man, <HI>Eph</HI> 4, 24. a new Creature. All things are become new, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. Conversion is a deep Work; a Heart-work, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. and 6.14. it turns all upside down, and makes a Man be in a new World. It goes throughout with Men, through∣out the mind, throughout the Members, through∣out the Motions of the whole Life.</P>

He that could see little Sin in himself, and could find no mat∣ter for confession (as it was said of that learned Ignora∣mus <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> who, it seems, while he knew so much abroad, was a miserable Stranger to himself) that when he was to be confessed by the Priest, could not remember any thing to confess; but was fain to run back to the Sins of his Youth: I say, he that could not find matter for confession, unless it were some few gross and staring Evils, now Sin reviveth with him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. he sees the Rottenness of his Heart, and desperate and deep pollution of his whole Na∣ture: he cries, Unclean, unclean, <HI>Levit.</HI> 13.45. <HI>Lord, purge me with byssop, wash me throughly, create in me a new heart,</HI> Psalm 51.2, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 10.

Now let all the World be set on one side, and God alone on the other; Let the Harlot put on her paint and gallan∣try, and present her self to the Soul (as when Satan would have tempted our Saviour with her) in all the glory of her kingdoms; yet the Soul will not fall down and worship her, but will prefer a naked, yea, a crucified, persecuted Christ before her, <HI>Philip</HI> 3.8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.2: Not but that a Hypocrite may come to yield a general assent to this, that God is the chief good: yea, the wiser <HI>Heathens,</HI> some dew of them, have at last stumbled upon this; but there is a Dif∣ferance between the absolute and comparative Judg∣ment of the Understanding; no Hypocrite comes so far, as to look upon God as the most desirable and suitable good to him, and thereupon to acquiesce in him: This was the Convert's Voice. <HI>The Lord is my portion, saith my Soul: Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth, that I desire besides thee: God is the strength of my Heart, and my portion for ever,</HI> Psalm 73.25, 26.

<P N="1">1. <HI>The Terms from which we turn in this motion of Conversion,</HI> are <HI>Sin, Satan, the World, and our own Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First, Sin.</HI> When a Man is converted, he is for ever out with sin; yea, with all sin, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119, 128, but most of all with his own sins, and especially with his Bosom-sin, <HI>Psalm</HI> 18.23.

If God should give him his choice, he would choose any Affliction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be might be rid of sin; he feels it like the

cutting Gravel in his Shoes, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cking and paining him as he goes</P>
<P>Before Conversion, he had light thoughts of Sin; he cherished it in his Bosom, as <HI>Uriah</HI> his Lamb; he nourished it up, and it grew up together with him; it did eat, as it were, of his own Meat, and drank of his own Cup, and lay in his Bosom, and was to him as a Daughter▪ But when God open his Eyes by Conversion, he throws i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away with abhorrence, <HI>Isa</HI> 30.22 as a Man would a loathsome Toade, <HI>which</HI> in the dark he had hugged fast in his Bosom, and thought it had been some pretty and harmless Bird: When a Man is savingly changed, he is not only deeply convinced of the Danger, but Defilement of Sin; and Oh, how earnest is he with God to be purified! He loaths himself for his Sins, <HI>Ezek</HI> 36.31. He runs to Christ, and casts himself into the Foun∣tain, for Sin, and for Uncleanness, <HI>Zech.</HI> 13.1. If he fall, what a stir is there to get all clean again! He flies to the Word, and washes, and rubs, and rinses; labouring to cleanse himself from all Filthi∣ness, both of Flesh and Spirit; he abhors his once beloved sin, <HI>Psalm</HI> 18.23. as a cleanly Nature doth the trough and mire wherein he sees the Swine delight.</P>
<P>The sound Convert is heartily engaged against sin: he wrestles with it, he wars against it; he is too often foiled, but he never yields the Cause, nor lays down the Weapons; but he will up and to it again, while he hath Breath in his Body: He will never give quiet possession, he will make no peace, he wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give no quarter, he falls upon it, and fires upon it and is still disquieting of it with continual Alarms. He can forgive his other Enemies, he can pity them, and pray for them, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.60. But here he is im∣placable, here he is set upon revenge; he hunteth, as it were, for the precious Life; his Eye shall not pity, his Hand shall not spare, tho' it be a right-hand, or a right Eye: Be it a gainful Sin, most delightful to his Nature, or Support to his Esteem with carnal Friends; yet he will rather throw his Gai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down the Kennel, see his credit fall, or the Flower o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Pleasure wither in his hand▪ than he will allow him∣self in any known way of sin, <HI>Luke</HI> 19.8. He will grant no Indulgence, he will give no Toleration, but he draws upon sin, where-ever he meets it, and frowns upon it with this unwelcome Salute, <HI>Have I found thee, O mine Enemy!</HI></P>
<P>Reader, hath Conscience been at work, while thou hast been looking over these Lines? Hast thou pon∣dered these things in thine Heart? Hast thou search∣ed the Book within, to see if these things be so? if not, read it again, and make thy Conscience speak, whether or no it be thus with thee.</P>
<P>Hast thou crucified thy Flesh with its Affections and Lusts; and not only confessed, but forsaken thy Sins; all sin in thy fervent desires, and the ordinary practice of every deliberate and wilful sin in thy life? If not, thou art yet unconverted. Doth not Conscience fly in thy Face, as thou readest, and tell thee that thou livest in a way of lying for thy Ad∣vantage, that thou usest deceit in thy Calling, that there is some way of secret wantonness that thou liv∣est in? why then, do not deceive thy self, thou art in the Gall of Bitterness, and Bond of Iniquity.</P>
<P>Doth not thy unbridled Tongue, thy brutish In∣temperance, thy wicked Company, thy Neglect of Prayer, of Hearing and Reading the Word, now witness against thee, and say, <HI>We are thy Works, and we will follow thee?</HI> Or if I have not hit thee right, doth not the Bird within tell thee, there is such or such a way, that thou knowest to be evil, that yet for some carnal respect thou dost tolerate thy self in, and art willing to spare? If this be thy Case, thou art to this Day Unregenerate, and must be changed or condemned.</P>

Before, the Devil could no sooner hold up his Fin∣ger to the Sinner, to call him to his wicked Com∣pany, sinful Games, filthy Delight, but presently he followed, like an Ox to the Slaughter, and a Fool
<PB N="32" REF="004663_0056_100DE90868F970E0"/>
to the Correction of the stocks; as the Bird that hasteth to the Prey, and knoweth not that it is for his Life: No sooner could <HI>Satan</HI> bid him lie, but presently he had it upon the top of his Tongue, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.3. No sooner could <HI>Satan</HI> offer a wanton Object, but he was stung with Lust. The Devil could do more with him than God could: It the Devil say, Away with these Family duties, be sure they shall be rarely enough performed in his house: If the Devil say, Away with this strictness, this Precise∣ness, he will keep far enough from it: If he tells him, there's no need of these Closet-duties, he shall go from Day to Day, and scarce perform them: But now he is converted, he serves another Master, and takes quite another course, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 4.4 he goes and comes at Christ's beck, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.24. <HI>Satan</HI> may some∣times catch his Foot in a trap, but he will no longer be a willing captive: he watches against the snares and Baits of <HI>Satan,</HI> and studies to be acquainted with his devices; he is very suspicious of his Plots, and is very jealous in what comes athwart him, lest <HI>Satan</HI> should have some Design upon him: He wrestles against Principalities and Powers, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. he entertains the Messenger of <HI>Satan,</HI> as Men do the Messenger of Death: he keeps his Eye upon his E∣nemy, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 5.8. and watches in his Duties, lest <HI>Satan</HI> should put in his Foot.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, the World.</HI> Before a sound Faith, a Man is overcome of the <HI>World;</HI> either he bows down to <HI>Mammon,</HI> or idolizes his reputation, or is a Lover of Pleasure more than a Lover of God, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.4. Here's the Root of Man's Misery by the Fall; he is turned aside to the Creature, instead of God, and gives that esteem, confidence, and affection to the Creature, that is due to him alone, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.25. <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.37. <HI>Prov</HI> 18.11. <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.5.</P>
<P>O miserable Man! What a deformed Monster hath sin made the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? God made thee little lower than the Angels; Sin little better than the Devils, <HI>John</HI> 6.70. &amp; 8.44. A monster, that hath his Head, and Heart where his Feet should be, and his Feet
<PB N="33" REF="004663_0057_100DE90AD0C11000"/>
kicking against Heaven, and every thing out of place; the World, that was formed to serve thee, is come to rule thee, and the deceitful Harlot hath bewitch∣ed thee with her Inchantments, and made thee bow down and serve her.</P>
<P>But converting Grace sets all in order again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d puts God in the Throne, and the World at his Foot∣stool, <HI>Psalm</HI> 73: 25. Christ in the Heart, and the World under Feet, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3, 17, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12, 1. So <HI>Paul I am crucified to the World, and the World to me,</HI> Gal. 6.14 Before this change, all the cry was, <HI>Who will shew us any (worldly) good?</HI> But now he sings another tune, <HI>Lord, lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon me,</HI> and take the Corn and Oil whoso will, <HI>Psal.</HI> 4.6, 7. Before, his Heart's delight and content was in the World; then the Song was, <HI>Soul take thine case; eat, drink, and be merry; thou hast much Goods laid up for many Years:</HI> But now all this is withered, and there is no comeliness, that he should desire it; and he tunes up with the sweet <HI>Psalmist</HI> of <HI>Israel, The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, the lines are fallen to me in a fair place, and I have a goodly heritage.</HI> He blesseth himself, and boasts himself in God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.2. <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.24. nothing else can give him content. He hath written Vanity and Vexation upon all his worldly enjoyments, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 1 2. and loss and dung upon all human excellencies, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3: 7, 8: He hath Life and Immortality now in chase, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2, 7: He trades for Grace and Glory, and hath a Crown incorruptible in pursuit, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8: 25. His Heart is set in him to seek the Lord, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 22: 19: and 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.15. He first seeks the Kingdom of Hea∣ven, and the Righteousness thereof; and Religion is no longer a matter by the by with him, but the main of his care, <HI>Matt.</HI> 9.33. <HI>Psalm</HI> 17.4. Now the gaudy Idol is become <HI>Nebushtan,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.4; and he gets up and trends upon it, as <HI>Diogenes</HI> trampling upon <HI>Plato's</HI> Hangings, saying, <HI>Celco Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tonis Fastum.</HI> Before the World had a swaying Interest with him; he would do more for gain than godliness, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.6. more to pleasure his Friend, or his Flesh than
<PB N="34" REF="004663_0058_100DE90D2F44D868"/>
to please the God that made him; and God must stand by till the World were first served: But now all must stand by; he hates Father and Mother, and Life and all, in comparison of Christ, <HI>Luke</HI> 1.26.</P>
<P>Well then, pause a little, and look within; Doth not this nearly concern thee? Thou pretendest for Christ, but doth not the World sway thee? Dost thou not take more real delight and content in the World than in him? Dost thou not find thyself better at ease when the World goes to thy Mind, and thou art encompassed with carnal Delights, than when retired to Prayer and Meditation in thy Closet, or attending upon God's Word and Worship? No surer evidence of an unconverted State, than to have the things of the World uppermost in our Aims, Love and Estimation, <HI>John</HI> 2.15. <HI>James</HI> 4.4.</P>
<P>With the second Convert, Christ hath the Supre∣macy. How dear is this Name to him? How pre∣cious is its favour? <HI>Cant.</HI> 13. <HI>Psalm</HI> 54.8. The name of Jesus is engraven upon his Heart, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. and lies as a bundle of Myrrhe between his breasts, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.13.14. Honour is but Air, and Laughter is but Madness, and <HI>Mammon</HI> is fallen like <HI>Dagon</HI> before the Ark, with Hands and Head broken off on the Threshold, when once Christ is savingly revealed. Here is the Pearl of great price to the true Convert, here is his Treasure, here is his Hope, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.44.45. This is his Glory, <HI>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</HI> Gal 6.14. Cant. 2.16. Oh, 'tis sweeter to him to be able to say, Christ is mine, than if he could say, The Kingdom is mine, the <HI>Indies</HI> are mine.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, Your own Righteousness:</HI> Before Conver∣sion, Man seeks to cover himself with his own Fig-leaves, <HI>Phil,</HI> 3.6 7. and to lick himself whole with his own Duties, <HI>Micah</HI> 6 6, 7. He is apt to trust in himself, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.15. &amp; 18.9. and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up his own Righteousness, and to reckon his Counters for Gold, and not submit to the Righteousness of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. But Conversion changes his Mind; now he casts away his filthy Rags, and counts his own Righteousness but a menstruons Cloth? He casts it
<PB N="35" REF="004663_0059_100DE9105DA6E970"/>
off, as a Man would the verminous tatters of a nasty Beggar, <HI>Isa</HI> 64.7. Now he is brought to Poverty of Spirit, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.3. complains of, and condemns himself, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. and all his Inventory is, <HI>Poor, and miserable, and wretched and blind, and naked,</HI> Rev. 3.17, He sees a World of Iniquity in his holy things and calls his once idolized Righteousness but Flesh, and Loss, and Dogs Meat, and would not for a thou∣sand Worlds be found in himself, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.4, 7, 8, 9. His Finger is even upon his Sores, <HI>Psalm</HI> 51.3. his, Sins, his Wants. Now he begins to set a high Price upon Christ's Righteousness; he sees the Need of a Christ in every Duty, to justify his Person, and justify his Performances; he cannot live without him, he cannot pray without him. Christ must go with him, or else he cannot come into the Presence of God; he leans upon the Hand of Christ, and so he bows himself in the House of his God; he sets himself down for a lost, undone Man, without him: His Life is hid in Christ, as the Life of a Man in the Heart; he is fixed in Christ, as the Roots of the Tree spread in the Earth, for Stabi∣lity and Nutriment. Before, the News of a Christ was a stale and sapless thing; but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how sweet is a Christ; <HI>Augustine</HI> could not relish his before so much admired <HI>Cicero,</HI> because he could not find the Name of Christ, how pathetically cries he, <HI>Dul∣cissime, amantis. benignis. caris.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>quando te videbo? quando satiabo de pulchritudine tua? Medit. c.</HI> 37. <HI>O most sweet, most loving, most kind, most dear, most precious, most desired, most lovely most fair,</HI> &amp;c. all in a Breath, when he speaks of, and to his Christ: In a Word, the Voice of the Convert, is with the Martyr, <HI>None but Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Terms which</HI> are ether <HI>Ultimate,</HI> or <HI>Sub∣ordinate,</HI> and <HI>Mediate.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ultimate,</HI> is God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, whom the true Convert takes, as his Allsuf∣ficient and Eternal blessedness. A Man is never truly Sanctified, till his very Heart be in Truth set upon God above all things, as his portion and chief
<PB N="36" REF="004663_0060_100DE91206A91BD0"/>
good. These are the natural Breathings of a Belie∣ver's Heart; <HI>thou art my portion,</HI> Psal. 119.57. <HI>My Soul shall make her boast in the Lord,</HI> Psal 34, 2. <HI>My ex∣pectation, is from him, he only is my rock, and my Salvation, he is my defence: in God is my Salvation, and my Glory, the Rock of my Strengh, and my Refuge is in God,</HI> Psalm 62.1, 2, 5, 6, 7. Psalm 18.1, 2.</P>
<P>Would you put it to an Issue, whether you be converted or not? Now then let thy Soul and all that is within thee attend.</P>
<P>Hast thou taken God for thy Happiness? Where doth the content of thy Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly? Whence doth thy choicest comfort come in; Come then, and with <HI>Abraham,</HI> lift up thine Eyes Eastward, and West∣ward, and Northward, and Southward, and cast about thee, what is it that thou wouldst have in Heaven or Earth to make thee happy? If God should give thee thy choice, as he did to <HI>Solomon,</HI> or should say to thee, as <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> to <HI>Esther, What is thy Pe∣tition, and what is thy Request, and it shall granted thee,</HI> Esther 5.3. What wouldst thou ask? Go into the Gardens of Pleasure, and gather all the fragrant Flowers from thence: Would these content thee? Go to the Treasures of <HI>Mammon;</HI> suppose thou mightest lade thy self while thou wouldst from hence: Go to the Towers, to the Trophies of Honour: What thinkest thou of being a Man of renown and having a name like the name of the great Men of the Earth? Would any of this, all this suffice thee, and make thee count thy self a happy Man? If so then certainly thou art Carnal and Unconverted; if not, go farther; wade into the Divine excellencies, the sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of his Mercies, the hiding of his Power, the deeps unfathomable of his All-sufficiency; Doth this suit thee best, and please thee most? Dost thou say. <HI>'Tis good to be here, Matth.</HI> 17.4. <HI>Here I will pitch. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere I will live and die?</HI> Wilt thou let all the World go, rather than this? Then 'tis well between God and thee: Happy art thou, O Man! Happy art thou that ever thou wast born: If a God can make thee happy, thou must needs be
<PB N="37" REF="004663_0061_100DE9138C596C38"/>
happy; for <HI>thou hast avouched the Lord to be thy God,</HI> Deut. 26.17. Dost thou say to Christ, as he to us, <HI>Thy Father shall be my Father, and thy God my God,</HI> John 20.17. Here is the turning Point. An un∣sound Professor never takes up his rest in God, but converting grace doe the work, and so cures the fatal misery of the fall, by turning the heart from its Idols, to the living God, 1 <HI>Thess</HI> 1.9. Now says the Soul, <HI>Lord, whither should I go? Thou hast the Words of Eternal Life,</HI> John 6.68. Here he cen∣ters, here he settles: O, 'tis as the entrance of Hea∣ven to him, to see his Interest in God. When he discovers this, he saith, <HI>Return unto thy rest, O my Soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee, Psalm</HI> 116, 17. And it is even ready to breathe out <HI>Simeon's</HI> Song, <HI>Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, Luk.</HI> 2.29. and saith with <HI>Jacob,</HI> when his old heart revived at the welcome tidings, <HI>It is enough,</HI> Gen. 45 28. When he sees he hath a God in Covenant to go to, <HI>this is all his Salvation, and all his desire,</HI> 2 Sam. 23.5.</P>
<P>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, is this thy Case? hast thou experienced this? Why then, blessed art thou of the Lord: God hath been at work with thee, he hath laid hold on thy heart by the power of converting Grace, or else thou couldst never have done this:</P>
<P>The <HI>Mediate</HI> Term of Conversion is either <HI>princi∣pal,</HI> or <HI>less principal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Principal</HI> is Christ, the only Mediator be∣tween God and Man, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5. His Work is to bring us to God, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3.18. He is the way to the Father, <HI>John</HI> 14.6. the only plank on which we may escape, the only door by which we may enter, <HI>John</HI> 10.9. Conversion brings over the Soul to Christ, to accept of him, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.6. as the only means to Life, as the only way, the only name given under Hea∣ven, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. He looks not for Salvation in any other but him, nor in any other with him; but throws himself on Christ alone, as one that should cast himself with spread A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms upon the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Here</HI> (saith the convinced Sinner) <HI>here I will ven∣ture,
<PB N="38" REF="004663_0062_100DE916D9A50C58"/>
and if I perish, I perish: if I die, I will die here. But, Lord, suffer me not to perish under the pitiful Eyes of thy mercy. Intreat me not to leave thee, or to turn away from following after thee,</HI> Ruth 1 16. <HI>Here I will throw my self: If thou kick me, if thou kill me,</HI> Job 13.15. <HI>I will not go from thy door.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the poor Soul doth venture on Christ, and resolvedly adhere to him. Before Conversion, the Man made light of Christ, minded the Farm, Friends, Merchandise, more than Christ, <HI>Matth</HI> 22 5. Now Christ is to him as his necessary Food, his Daily-bread, the Life of his Heart, the Staff of his Life, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3 9: His great design is, that Christ may be magnified in him, <HI>Philip.</HI> 1.20. His Heart once said, as they to the Spouse, <HI>What is thy Beloved more than another?</HI> Cant. 5.9. He found more sweetness in his merry Company, wicked Games, earthly De∣lights, than in Christ. He took Religion for a Fancy, and the Talk of great Enjoyments for an idle Dream. But now, to him to live is Christ. He sets light by all that he accounted precious, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of <HI>CHRIST, Phil.</HI> 3.8.</P>
<P>All of Christ is accepted by the <HI>Sincere Convert.</HI> He loves not only the wages but work of <HI>Christ, Rom.</HI> 7.12. not only the Benefits, but the <HI>burden of Christ:</HI> He is willing not only to tread out the Corn, but to draw under the Yoke: He takes up the Commands of Christ, yea, and Cross of Christ, <HI>Matth</HI> 11. <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.24.</P>
<P>The unsound closeth by the halves with Christ: He is all for the Salvation of Christ, but he is not for Sanctification: He is for the Privileges, but ap∣pretrates not the Person of Christ: He divides the Offices and Benefits of Christ. This is an Error in the Foundation: Whoso loveth Life let him beware here; 'tis an undoing mistake, of which you have been often warned, and yet none more common. Jesus is a sweet name, but Men love not the Lord Jesus in Sincerity, <HI>Eph</HI> 6.24. They will not have him as God offers, <HI>To be a Prince, and a Saviour,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="004663_0063_100DE91A4C139168"/>
Acts 5, 31. They divide what God hath joyned, the King and the Priest; Yea, they will not ac∣cept the Salvation of Christ, as he intends it; they divide it here. Every Man's Vote is for Salvation from Suffering, but they desire not to be saved from sinning; they would have their Lives saved, but withall, they would have their Lusts. Yea, many divide her again; they would be content to have some of their Sins destroyed, but they cannot leave the Lap of <HI>Dalilah,</HI> or divorce the beloved <HI>Herodias.</HI> They cannot be cruel to the Right-eye, or Right-hand; the Lord must pardon them in this thing, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 5.18. Oh! be infinitely tender here; your Souls lye upon it. The sound Convert takes a whole Christ, and takes him for all intents and purposes: without exceptions, without limitations, without reserves. He is willing to have <HI>Christ</HI> upon his terms upon any terms. He is willing of the Dominion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Christ,</HI> as well as deliverance by <HI>Christ;</HI> he saith with <HI>Paul, Lord, what will thou have me to do?</HI> Acts 9.6. Any thing, Lord. He sends the blank to <HI>Christ,</HI> to set down his own <HI>Conditions,</HI> Acts 1.37. and 16.30.</P>
<P>The <HI>less Principal is the Laws Ordinances and Ways of Christ.</HI> The Heart that was once set against these, and could not endure the strictness of these Bonds, the severity of these ways, now falls in love with them, and chooses them as its Rule and Guide for ever, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.111, 112.</P>
<P>Four things (I observe) God doth work in every sound Convert, with reference to the Laws and Ways of Christ, by which you may come to know your Estates, if you will be faithful to your own Souls; and therefore keep your Eyes upon your Hearts as you go along.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Judgment is brought to approve of them, and subscribe to them as most righteous and most reasonable Psalm</HI> 11.112.128, 137, 138. The Mind is brought to like the Ways of God, and the corrupt Prejudices that were once against them, as unreasonable, and intolerable, are now removed. The Understanding assents to them all, as holy, just and good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7
<PB N="40" REF="004663_0064_100DE91BCFE463D0"/>
12. How is <HI>David</HI> taken up with these Excellencies of God's Laws; How doth he explain in their praises both from their inherent Qualities and ad∣mirable Effects, <HI>Psalm</HI> 19.8, 9, 10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a two-fold Judgment of the Understand∣ing, <HI>Judicium abs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iutum &amp; comparatum.</HI> The abso∣lute Judgment is, when a Man thinks such a course best in the general, but not for him, or not under the present circumstances he is in, <HI>pro hic &amp; nunc.</HI> Now a godly Man's Judgment is for the Ways of God; and that not only the absolute, but compara∣tive Judgment; he thinks them not only best in ge∣neral, but best for him; he looks upon the Rules of Religion, not only as tolerable, but desirable; yea, more desirable than Gold, fine Gold; yea, much fine Gold, <HI>Psalm</HI> 19.10.</P>
<P>His Judgments are settledly determined, that 'tis best to be holy, that 'tis best to be strict, that it is in it self the most eligible course; and that 'tis for him the wisest, and most rational, and desirable choice. Hear the Godly Man's Judgment. <HI>I know O Lord, that thy judgments are right. I love thy commandment; above Gold, yea, above fine Gold. I esteem all thy pre∣cepts, concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false Way,</HI> Psalm 119.127, 121. Mark, he did approve of all that God required, and disallowed of all that he forbad; <HI>Righteous, O Lord, and upright are thy Judgments. Thy testimonies that thou hast com∣manded, are righteous and very faithful. Thy word is true from the beginning, and every one of thy righteous Judgments endureth forever,</HI> Psalm 119.86, 160, 162, 163. See how readily and fully he subscribes: he declares his assent and consent to it, and all and e∣very thing therein contained.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The desire of the Heart is to know the whole mind of Christ,</HI> Psalm 112.124, 125, 169 and 25.4.5. He would not have one Sin undiscovered, nor be ignorant of one Duty required. 'Tis the natural and earnest breathing of a sanctified Heart: <HI>Lord, if there be any way of wickedness in me, do thou dis∣cover it. What I know not, teach thou me; and if I
<PB N="41" REF="004663_0065_100DE91DB7511E18"/>
have done Iniquity, I will do it no more.</HI> The unsound is willingly ignorant, 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 3.5. loves not to come to the light, <HI>Job</HI> 3.20. He is willing to keep such or such a Sin, and therefore is loath to know it to be a Sin, and will not let in the Light at that Window. The gracious Heart is willing to know the whole latitude and compass of his Maker's Law, Psalm 119.18, 19, 27, 33, 64, 66, 68, 78, 108, 124. He receives with all Acceptation the Word that convinceth him of any Duty that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he knew not, or minded not before; or discovereth any Sin that lay hid before, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.11.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The free and resolved choice of the Will is deter∣mined for the ways of Christ, before all the pleasures of Sin, and prosperities of the World,</HI> Psalm 119.103. 127, 162. His consent is not extorted by some Ex∣tremity of Anguish, nor is it only a sudden and hasty resolve, but he is deliberately purposed, and comes off freely to the choice, <HI>Psalm</HI> 17.3. and 119. 39. True, the Flesh will rebel, yet the prevailing Part of his Will is for Christ's Laws and Govern∣ment, so that he takes them not up as his toil or burden, but his bliss, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.3. <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.60, 72. When the unsanctified goes in Christ's w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys as in Chains and Fetters, he doth them naturally, <HI>Psalm</HI> 40.8. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.13. and counts Christ's Law his liber∣ty, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.32, 45. <HI>James</HI> 1.25. <HI>He is willing in the beauties of holiness.</HI> Psalm 110.3. and hath this inseparable mark; <HI>That he had rather (if he might have his choice) live a strict and holy Life, than the most prosperous and flourishing Life in the World.</HI> 1 Sam. 10.26. <HI>There went with</HI> Saul <HI>a band of Men, whose Hearts God had touched.</HI> When God touched the Hearts of his chosen, they presently follow Christ, <HI>Matth.</HI> 4.22.

People. They are (through his Grace) freely re∣solved for his Service, and do it out of choice, not as Slaves, but as the Son or Spouse, from a Spring of Love, and a loyal Mind. In a Word, the Laws of Christ are the Convert's Love, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.159, 163, 167. Desire, <HI>Verse</HI> 5, 20, 40. Delight, <HI>Verse</HI> 77, 92, 103, 111, 143. and continual Study, <HI>Verse</HI> 99, 79. <HI>Psalm</HI> 1.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The bent of his course is directed to keep God's Sta∣tutes.</HI> Psalm 119.4, 8, 167, 198. 'Tis the daily Care of his Life to walk with God.

He aims at nothing less than Perfection: He desires it, he reaches after it, he would not rest in any Pitch of Grace, till he were quite rid of Sin, and had per∣fected Holiness, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.11, 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>Here the Hypocrites rottenness may be discovered. He desires Holiness (as one says well) only as a Bridge to Heaven, and enquires earnestly, what is the least that will serve his Turn; and if he can get <HI>but</HI> so much as may just bring him to Heaven, this is all he cares for.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itch thee as thou goest? Is this thy judgment, and this thy choice, and this thy way, that we have de∣scribed? If so, then 'tis well. But doth not thy Heart condemn thee, and tell thee, there is such a Sin thou livest in, against thy Conscience? Doth it not tell thee, there is such and such a secret way of Wicked∣ness, that thou makest no bones of? Such or such a Duty, that thou makest no Conscience of?</P>
<P>Doth not Conscience carry thee to thy closet, and tell thee how seldom Prayer and Reading is perform∣ed there? Doth it not carry thee to thy Family, and shew thee the Charge of God, and the Souls of thy Children and Servants that be neglected there? Doth not Conscience lead thee to thy Shop, thy Trade, and tell thee of some mystery of Iniquity there? Doth it not carry thee to the Ale-shop, or to the Sack-shop, and round thee in thine Ear for the loose Company thou keepest there, the precious time thou mis-spend∣est there, for the Talents of God which thou throw∣est down this sink, for thy gaming, and thy swil∣ling? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Doth it not carry thee into thy Secret-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amber, and read thee a curtain Lecture?</P>
<P>O Conscience! do thy Duty: In the Name of the living God, I command thee, discharge thine office. Lay hold upon this Sinner, fall upon him, arrest him, apprehend him, undeceive him; What! Wilt thou flatter and sooth him, while he lives in his Sins? Awake, O Conscience! What meanest thou, O Sleep∣er? What! Hast thou never a reproof in thy Mouth? What! Shall this Soul die in a careless neglect of God and Eternity, and thou altogether hold thy Peace? What! Shall he still go on in his Trespasses, and yet have Peace? Oh, rouze up thy self, and do thy Work. Now let the Preacher in the Bosom speak: Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet; let not the Blood of this Soul be required at thy Hands.</P>

you with such earnestness, still ringing one Lesson in your Ears, <HI>That you should repent and be converted,</HI> Acts 3.19. But I must say unto you, as <HI>Ruth</HI> to <HI>Naeomi, Intreat me not to leave you, nor to turn aside from following after you,</HI> Ruth 1.16. Were it a Mat∣ter of Indifferency, I would never keep so much ado: Might you be saved as you be, I wou'd gladly let you alone. But would you not have me sollici∣tous for you, when I see you ready to perish? As the Lord liveth, before whom I am, I have not the least hopes to see one of your Faces in Heaven, ex∣cept you be converted: I utterly despair of your Salvation; <HI>except</HI> you will be prevailed with to turn throughly, and give up yourselves to God in Holi∣ness, and Newness of Life. Hath God said, <HI>Except you be born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God?</HI> John 3.3. and yet do you wonder why your Mini∣sters do so plainly travail in Birth with you? Think it not strange, that I am earnest with you to fol∣low after Holiness, and long to see the Image of God upon you: Never did any, nor shall any enter in∣to Heaven by any other way but this. The Con∣version described, is not an high pitch of some tal∣ler Christians; but every Soul that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asseth this Universal Change.</P>
<P>It was a Passage of the noble <HI>Roman,</HI> when he was hasting with Corn to the City in the Famine, and the Mariners were loth to set sail in foul weather, <HI>Neces∣sarium est navigare, non est necessarium vivere:</HI> Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Voyage is of more necessity than our Lives. Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is it that thou dost account necessary? Is thy Brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> necessary? is thy Breath necessary? Then thy Con∣version is much more necessary. Indeed, this is the <HI>unu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessarium,</HI> the one thing necessary. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Estate is not necessary; thou mayest sell all for the Pearl of great Price; and yet be a Gainer by the Pur∣chase. <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.46.

1 <HI>Peter</HI> 4.4. <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.10, 11. But thy Conversion is necessary, thy Damnation lies upon it: And is it not needful in so important a Case to look about thee? Upon this one Point depends thy making, or marring, to all Eternity.</P>
<P>But I shall more particularly shew the Necessity of Conversion in Five Things; for without this,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Thy Being is in vain:</HI> Is it not Pity thou shouldest be good for nothing, an unprofitable bur∣then of the Earth, a wart or wen in the Body of the Universe? Thus thou art, whilst unconverted; for thou canst not answer the End of thy Being: Is it not for the divine Pleasure thou art and wert crea∣ted? <HI>Rev.</HI> 4.11. Did he not make thee for him∣self? <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.4. Art thou a Man, and hast thou rea∣son? Why then bethink thyself, why and whence thy Being is. Behold God's Workmanship in thy Body, and ask thyself, To what end did God rear this Fabrick? Consider the noble Faculties of thy Heaven-born Soul: To what end did God bestow these Excellencies: To no other, than that thou shouldest please thyself and gratify thy Senses? Did God send Men, like the Swallows, into the World, only to gather a few sticks and dirt, and build their Nests, and breed up their young, and then away! The very <HI>Heathens</HI> could see farther than this. Art thou so fearfully and wonderfully made, <HI>Psalm</HI> 139. 14. and dost thou not yet think with thyself, surely it was for some noble and raised end!</P>
<P>O Man! set thy Reason a little in the Chair▪ Is it not pity such a goodly Fabrick should be raised in vain! Verily, thou art in vain, except thou art for God; better thou hadst no being, than not to be for him. Would thou serve thy End? Thou must repent, and be converted; without this, thou art <HI>to us Purpose;</HI> yea, <HI>to had Purpose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First, To no purpose:</HI> Man unconverted, is like a choice Instrument, that hath every String broke, or out of Tune; the Spirit of the living God must re∣pair and tune it by the Grace of Regeneration, and sweetly move it by the power of actuating Grace, or
<PB N="46" REF="004663_0070_100DE92C0117ADA8"/>
else thy Prayers will be but how sings, and all thy Services will make no Musick in the Ears of the most Holy, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. <HI>Philip.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Hosea</HI> 7.14. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.15. All thy Powers and Faculties are so cor∣rupt in thy Natural State, that except thou be purged from dead Works, thou canst not serve the living God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.14. <HI>Titus</HI> 1.15.</P>
<P>An Unsanctified Man cannot work the Work of God. 1. <HI>He hath no Skill in it.</HI> He is altogether as unskilful in the Work, as in the Word of Righteous∣ness, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.13. There are great Mysteries, as well in the Practices, as Principles of Godliness; now the Unregenerate knows not the Mysteries of the King∣dom of Heaven, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13: 11.1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. You may as well expect him that never learned the Alphabet, to read; or look for goodly Musick of the Lute, from one that never set his Hand to an Instrument, as that a natural Man should do the Lord any pleasing Service: He must first be taught of God, <HI>John</HI> 6.45. taught to pray, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.1. taught to profit, <HI>Isa.</HI> 48. 17. taught to go, <HI>Hosea</HI> 11.3. or else he will be ut∣terly at a Loss. 2. <HI>He hath no Strength for it,</HI> How weak is his Heart? <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.30. He is presently tired. The Sabbath, what a weariness is it, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1 13. He is without strength, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.6. yea, stark dead in Sin, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.5, 3. <HI>He hath no Mind to it.</HI> He desires not the Knowledge of God's ways, <HI>Job</HI> 21.14. He doth not know them, and he doth not eare to know them, <HI>Psalm</HI> 82 5. He knows not, nei∣ther will he understand. 4 <HI>He hath neither due In∣struments, nor Materials for it.</HI> A Man may as well hew the Marble without Tools, or limn without Colours or Instruments, or build without Materials, as perform any acceptable Service without the Graces of the Spirit, which are both the Materials and Instruments in the Work. Alms-giving is not a Service of God, but of Vain-glory, unless dealt forth by the Hand of divine Love. What is the Prayer of the Lips without Grace in the Heart, but the Carcase without the Life? What are all our Confessions, unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be Exercises of godly Sor∣row,
<PB N="47" REF="004663_0071_100DE92E65EFDE48"/>
and unfeigned Repentance? What our Petiti∣ons, unless animated all along with holy Desires, and Faith in divine Attributes and Promises? What our Praises and Thanksgivings, unless from the Love of God, and a holy Gratitude, and Sense of God's Mercies in the Heart? So that a Man may as well expect that Trees should speak, or look for Lo∣gick from the Brutes, or Motion from the Dead, as for any Service holy and acceptable to God from the Unconverted. When the Tree is evil, how can the Fruit be good? <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.18.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To <HI>bad purpose.</HI> The unconverted Soul is a very Cage of unclean Birds, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18 2. a Sepul∣chre full of corruption and rottenness, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.27. a loathsome Carcase, full of crawling Worms, and sending forth a hellish and most noisom Savour in the Nostrils of God, <HI>Psalm</HI> 14.3. O dreadful Case! Dost thou not yet see a change to be needful? Would it not have griev'd one, to have seen the golden consecrated Vessels of God's Temple turned into quaffing Bowls of Drunkenness, and polluted with the Idols Service, <HI>Dan.</HI> 5.2, 3. Was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> such an A∣bomination to the <HI>Jews,</HI> when <HI>Antiochus</HI> set up the Picture of a Swine at the Entrance of the Temple? How much more abominable then would it have been, to have had the very Temple itself turned into a Stable or a Sty, and to have the Holy of Holies served like the House of <HI>Baal;</HI> to have the Image of God taken down, and be turned into a Draught-house? 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 10.27. This is the very Case of the Unregenerate; All thy Members are turned into In∣struments of unrighteousness, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.19. Servants of Satan: and thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nmost powers into receptacles of uncleanness. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.2. <HI>Titus</HI> 1.15. You may see the goodly Guests within, by what come out. <HI>For out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adul∣teries, Fernicatione, Thefts, False Witness, Blasphemies, &amp;c.</HI> This black Guard discovers what a Hell there is within.</P>
<P>O Abuse insufferable! to see a Heaven-born Soul abased to the filthiest Drudgery; to see the Glory of
<PB N="48" REF="004663_0072_100DE930FA975BF0"/>
God's Creation, the chief of the Works of God, the Lord of the Universe, a lapping with the Prodigal at the trough, or licking up with greediness the most loathsom Vomit? Was it such a lamentation to see those that did feed delicately, to sit desolate in the street; and the precious Sons of <HI>Sion,</HI> comparable to fine Gold, to be esteemed as earthen pitchers; and those that were clothed in Scarlet, to embrace dung∣hills, <HI>Lam.</HI> 4.2, 5. And is it not much more fear∣ful, to see the only thing that hath Immortality in this low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> world, and carries the stamp of God, to become as a Vessel wherein there is no Pleasure, <HI>Jer.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.28. (which is but a modest Expression of the Vessel Men put to the most sordid Use): O Indig∣nity untolerable! Better thou wert dashed in a thousand pieces, than continue to be abused to so filthy a Service.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Not only Man, but the whole visible Creation is in vain without this:</HI> Beloved, God hath made all the visible creatures in Heaven and Earth for the Service of Man, and Man only is the Spokesman for all the rest. Man is in the Universe, like the Tongue in the Body, which speaks for all the Members: The other Creatures cannot praise their Maker, but by dumb signs hint to Man, that he should speak for them: Man is (as it were) the High-Priest of God's Creation, to offer the Sacrifice of Praise for all his Fellow-creatures, <HI>Psalm</HI> 147, and 148, and 250. The Lord expecteth a Tribute of Praise from all his works, <HI>Psalm</HI> 103.22. Now all the rest do bring their Tribute to Man, and pay it in by his Hand: So then, if Man be false, and faithless, and selfish, God is wronged of all, and shall have no active Glory from his Works.</P>
<P>O dreadful Thought to think of! That God should build such a World as this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d And lay out such infinite Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness thereupon, and all in vain; and Man should be guilty, at last, of robbing and spoiling him of the Glory of all: Oh think of this! while thou art unconverted, all the Offices of the Creatures to thee are in vain:
<PB N="49" REF="004663_0073_100DE932887BB8F0"/>
Thy Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t nourishes thee in vain, the Sun holds forth his light to thee in vain, the Stars that serve thee in their Courses, by their most powerful, tho' hidden Influence, <HI>Judg'</HI> 5.20. <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.21, 22. do it in vain; thy Clothes warm thee in vain; thy Beast carries thee in vain: In a Word, the unwearied labour and continual travel of the whole Creation (as to thee) is in vain. The Service of all the Creatures, that drudge for thee, and yield forth their Strength unto thee (that therewith thou shouldest serve their Maker) is all but lost Labour. Hence the whole Creation groaneth under the Abuse of the unsancti∣fied World, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.22. that pervert them to the service of their Lusts, quite contrary to the very end of their Being.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Without this, thy Religion is in vain,</HI> J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1.26. All thy religious Performances will be but lost; for they can neither please God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.8. nor save thy Soul, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.2, 3. which are the very Ends of Re∣ligion. Be thy services never so precious, yet God hath no Pleasure in them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.10. Is not that Man's Case dreadful, whose sacrifices are as murder, and whose prayers are a breath of abomi∣nation, <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.3. <HI>Prov</HI> 28.9. Many, under Con∣victions, think they will set upon mending, and that a few Prayers and Alms will solve all again: But alas, Sirs! while your Hearts remain unsanctified, your Duties will not pass. How punctual was <HI>Jehu!</HI> and yet all was rejected, because his Heart was not upright, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 10, with <HI>Hos.</HI> 1.4. How blameless was <HI>Paul?</HI> and yet, being unconverted, all was but loss, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.6, 7. Men think they do much in at∣tending God's Service, and are ready to twit him with it, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.3. <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.22. and set him down so much their debtor, when as (their Persons being unsanctified) their Duties cannot be accepted.</P>
<P>O Soul! do not think, when thy Sins pursue thee, a little praying and reforming thy course will pacify God: Thou must begin with thine Heart; if that be not renewed, thou canst no more please God, than one that having unspeakably offended thee, should
<PB N="50" REF="004663_0074_100DE9342D0A55A0"/>
bring thee his Vomit in a Dish to pacify thee; or having fallen into the Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, should think with his loathed Embraces to reconcile thee.</P>
<P>It is a great Misery to labour in the Fire. The Poets could not invent a worser hell for <HI>Sis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plous,</HI> than to be getting the barrel still up the hill, and then that it should presently fall down again, and renew his labour. God threatens it, as the greatest of temporal Judgments, that they should build and not inhabit, plant and not gather, and their Labours should be eat up by Strangers, <HI>Deut.</HI> 23.30, 38, 39, 41. Is it so great a misery to lose our common labours, to sow in vain, and build in vain? how much more to lose our pains in Religion, to pray and hear, and fast in vain? This is an undoing and eternal loss. Be not deceived, if thou goest on in thy sinful state, tho' thou shouldst spread forth thine Hands, God will hide his Eyes; tho' thou make many prayers, he will not hear, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.15 If a Man without Skill set about our Work, and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it in the doing, tho' he take much Pains, we give him but small thanks. God will be wor∣shipped after the due Order, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.13. If a Servant do our Work, but quite contrary to our Or∣der, he shall have rather stripes than praise. God's Work must be done according to God's mind, or he will not be pleased; and this cannot be, except it be done with a holy Heart, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25.2.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Without this, thy bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s are in vain,</HI> Job 12.13. <HI>The Lord hath rejected thy Confidence,</HI> Jer. 2.37.</P>
<P><HI>First, Thy hopes of Comfort here are in vain.</HI> 'Tis not only necessary to the Safety, but Comfort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Condition, that you be converted. Without this, you shall not know Peace, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59. Without the Fear of God, you cannot have the Comforts of the Holy Ghost, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.31. God speaks peace only to his People, and to his Saints, <HI>Psalm</HI> 35.8. If you have a false Peace, continuing in your Sins, 'tis not of God's speaking, and then you may guess the Au∣thor. Sin is a real Sickness, <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.5. yea, the worst of Sickness; 'tis a Leprosy in the Head, <HI>Lev.</HI> 13.44. the Plague in the Heart, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8: 31. 'tis

brokeness in the Bones, <HI>Psalm</HI> 51.8. it pierceth, it woundeth, it racketh, it tormenteth, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. A Man may as well expect Ease, when his Diseases are in their strength, or his Bones out of Joynt, as true Comfort, while in his Sins.</P>
<P>O wretched Man, that canst have no Ease in this Case but what comes from the Deadliness of the Di∣sease! You shall have the poor sick Man, saying in his lightness, He is well, when you see Death i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Face: He will needs up and about his Business, when the very next step is like to be into the Grave. The unsanctified often see nothing amiss; they think themselves whole, and cry not out for the Physician; but this shews the Danger of their Case.</P>
<P>Sin doth naturally breed Distempers, and Distur∣bances in the Soul. What a continual tempest and commotion is there in a discontented Mind? What an eating evil is inordinate care? What is Passion, but a very Fever in the Mind? What is Lost, but a Fire in the Bones? What is Pride, but a deadly Tym∣pany, or Covetousness but an unsatiable and unsuf∣ferable Thirst? or Malice and Envy, but Venom in the very Heart? Spiritual Sloth is but a Scurvy in the Mind, and carnal Security a mortal Lethargy? and how can that Soul have true Comfort that is un∣der so many Diseases? but converting Grace cures, and so eases the Mind, and prepares the Soul for a settled, standing, immortal Peace, <HI>Great Peace have they that love thy Commandments, and nothing shall offend them,</HI> Psal. 119.165. They are the Ways of Wis∣dom, that afford Pleasure and Peace, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.17. <HI>David</HI> had infinitely more pleasure in the Word, than in all the Delights of his Court, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.103, 127: The Conscience cannot be truly pacified, till s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dly purified, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. Cursed is that Peace, that is maintained in a Way of Sin, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.19, 20. Two Sorts of Peace are more to be dreaded, than all the Troubles in the World; Peace with Sin, and Peace in Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Thy hopes of Salvation hereafter are in vain;</HI> yea, worse than in vain, they are most injurious
<PB N="52" REF="004663_0076_100DE93A65B3B008"/>
to God, most pernicious to thy self: There is Death, Desperation, Blasphemy in the Bowels of this Hope. 1. <HI>There is Death in it. Thy Confidence shall be rooted out of thy Tabernacles</HI> (God will up with it root and branch) <HI>it shall bring thee to the King of Terrors,</HI> Job 18.14. Tho' thou mayest lean upon this House, it will not stand, <HI>Job</HI> 8.15. But will prove like a ruinous building, which when a Man trusts to, it falls down about his Ears. 2. <HI>There is Desperation in it. Where is the hope of the Hypocrite, when God takes away his soul?</HI> Job 27.8. Then there is an end for ever of his <HI>Hope.</HI> Indeed, the Hope of the Righteous hath an end; but then 'tis not a destructive, but a perfective end; his hope ends in fruition, others in frustration, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10. 28. The Godly must say at Death, <HI>It is finished;</HI> but the Wicked. <HI>It is perished;</HI> and in too sad earnest bemoan himself (as <HI>Job</HI> in a mistake) <HI>Where now is my hope? he hath destroyed me, I am gone, and my hope is removed like a tree,</HI> Job 19.10. <HI>The righteous hath hope in his Death,</HI> Prov. 14.32. When Nature is dying, his Hopes are living; when his Body is languishing, his Hopes are flourishing; his Hope is a living Hope, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.3. <HI>eis alpida Zodan;</HI> but others a dying, yea, a damning, Soul-undoing Hope. <HI>When a wicked Man dieth, his Expectation shall perish; and the Hope of unjust Men perisheth,</HI> Prov. 11.7. <HI>It shall be cut off, and</HI> prove like the <HI>Spider's Web,</HI> Job 8.14. which he spins out of his own Bowels; but then comes Death with the Broom, and takes down all, and so there is an eternal end of his Confidence, wherein he trusted: <HI>For the Eyes of the Wicked shall fail, and their Hopes shall be as the giving up of the Ghost,</HI> Job 11.20. Wicked Men are settled in the Carnal Hope, and will not be beaten out of it: They hold it fast, they will not let it go. Yea but Death will knock off their fingers: Tho' we cannot undeceive them, Death and Judg∣ment will: When Death strikes his dart through thy Liver, it will let out thy Soul, and thy Hopes toge∣ther. The unsanctified have Hope only in this Life, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.19. and therefore are, of all Men, most

miserable: When Death comes, it lets them out into the amazing Gulf of endless Desperation. 3. <HI>There is Blasphemy in it.</HI> To hope we shall be saved, tho' continuing unconverted, is to hope we shall prove God a liar. He hath told you, that so merciful and pitiful as he is, he will never save you notwithstand∣ing, if you go on in Ignorance, or a Course of Un∣righteousness, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9. In a Word, he hath told you, that whatever you be, or do, nothing shall avail you to Salvation, without you be New Creatures, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.15. Now, to say God is merciful, and we hope he will save us nevertheless, is to say, in effect, we hope God will not do as he saith. We may not set God's Attributes at variance: God is resolved to glorify Mercy, but not with the Preju∣dice of Truth; as the presumptuous Sinner will find, to his everlasting Sorrow.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>Why but we hope in Jesus Christ, we put our whole Trust in God, and therefore doubt not but we shall be saved.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. <HI>This is not to hope in Christ, but against Christ.</HI> To hope to see the Kingdom of God without being born again; to hope to find eternal Life in the broad Way, is to hope Christ will prove a false Prophet. 'Tis <HI>David</HI>'s Plea, <HI>I hope in thy Word,</HI> Ps. 119.81. but this hope is against the Word. Shew me a Word of Christ for thy hope, that he will save thee in thine Ignorance, or profane Neglects of his Service, and I will never go to shake thy Confidence.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God doth with abhorrence reject this hope.</HI> Those condemned in the Prophet, went on in their Sins, <HI>yet</HI> (saith the Text) <HI>they will lean upon the Lord,</HI> Micah 3.11. God will not endure to be made a prop to Men in their Sins: The Lord rejected those presumptuous Sinners, that went on still in their Trespasses, and yet would stay themselves upon the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> Isa. 48.1, 2. as a Man would shake off the Briars (as one said well) that cleaves to his Garment.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If thy Hope be any thing worth, it will purify thee from thy Sins,</HI> 1 John 3.3. but cursed is that hope, which doth cherish Men in their Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="004663_0078_100DE94064197868"/><HI>Object.</HI> Would you have us to despair?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> You must despair of ever coming to Hea∣ven as you are, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. that is, while you remain unconverted You must despair ever to see the Face of God, without holiness; but you must by no means despair of finding Mercy, upon your thorough Repentance and Conversion; neither must you despair of attaining to Repentance and Conver∣sion, in the Use of God's Means.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Without this, all that Christ hath done and suffer∣ed will be (as to you) in vain,</HI> John 13.8. Tit. 2.14. That is, it will not avail to your Salvation. Many urge this as a sufficient ground for their Hopes, that Christ died for Sinners: But I must tell you, Christ never died to save impenitent and unconverted Sin∣ners (so continuing) 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.19. A great Divine was wont, in his private Dealings with Souls, to ask two Questions, 1. <HI>What hath Christ done for you?</HI> 2. <HI>What hath Christ wrought in you?</HI> Without the Application of the Spirit in Regeneration, we can have no saving Interest in the Benefits of Redemption. I tell you from the Lord, Christ himself cannot save you, if you go on in this estate.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>It were against his Trust.</HI> The Mediator is the Servant of the Father, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.1. shews his Commission from him, acts in his Name, and pleads his command for his Justification, <HI>John</HI> 10.18, 36. and 6.38, 40. And God hath committed all Things to him, en∣trusted his own Glory, and the Salvation of the Elect with him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.27. <HI>Job.</HI> 17.2. Accordingly, Christ gives his Father an account of both parts of his trust, before he leaves the World, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.4, 6, 12. Now Christ should quite cross his Father's Glory, his greatest Trust, if he should save Men in their Sins; for this were to overturn all his Councils; and to of∣fer Violence to all his Attributes.</P>
<P><HI>First, To overturn all his Counsels:</HI> Of which this is the Order, that Men should be brought through Sanctification to Salvation, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.13. He hath chosen them, that they should be holy, <HI>Eph,</HI> 1.4. They are elected to pardon and life throught Sancti∣fication,
<PB N="55" REF="004663_0079_100DE9430085ED28"/>
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. If thou canst repeal the Law of God's immutable Counsel, or corrupt him whom the Father hath sealed, to go directly against his com∣mission, then, and not otherwise, mayest thou get to Heaven in this Condition. To hope that Christ will save thee while unconverted, is to hope that Christ will falsify his Trust. He never did, not will save one Soul, but whom the Father hath given him in Election, and drawn to him in effectual Calling, <HI>John</HI> 6.34, 37. Be assured, Christ will save none in a Way contrary to his Father's Will, <HI>John</HI> 6.38.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To <HI>offer Violence to all his Attributes.</HI> 1. To <HI>his Justice:</HI> For the Righteousness of God's Judgment lies, in rendring to all according to their Works, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.5, 6. Now, should Men sow to the Flesh, and yet of the Spirit reap everlasting Life, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.7, 8. where were the Glory of Divine Justice, since it should be given to the Wicked according to the work of the Righteous? 2. <HI>To his Holiness:</HI> If God should not only save Sinners, but save them in their Sins, his most pure and strict Holiness would be ex∣ceedingly defaced. The unsanctified is, in the Eyes of God's Holiness, worse than a swine or viper, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.33. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22. Now, what cleanly Nature could endure to have the filthy Swine bed and board with him in his Parlour or Bed-chamber? It would offer the extreamest Violence to the infinite Purity of the divine Nature, to have such to dwell with him. They cannot stand in his Judgment, they cannot abide in his Presence, <HI>Psalm</HI> 1.5. and 5.4, 5. If holy <HI>David</HI> would not endure such in his House, no nor in his sight, <HI>Psalm</HI> 101.3, 7. shall we think God will? Should he take Men as they be, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Trough, to the Table; from the Harlot's Lips, from the Sty and Draff, to the Glory of Heaven, the World would think God were at no such a distance from Sin, nor had such dislike of it, as we are told he hath: They would conclude, God were altogether such a one as themselves, (as they wickedly did, but from the very Forbearance of God, <HI>Psalm</HI> 50.21) 3. <HI>To his Vera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y:</HI> For God hath declared from Heaven, <HI>That if any

shall say, he shall have Peace, tho' he should go on in the Imagination of his Heart: his Wrath shall smoke against that Man,</HI> Deut. 29.10, 20. <HI>That they (only) that con∣fess and forsake their Sins, shall find Mercy,</HI> Prov. 28.13. <HI>That they that shall enter into his Hill, must be of clean Hands, and a pure Heart,</HI> Psalm 24.3, 4. Where were God's Truth, if notwithstanding all this, he should bring Men to Salvation without Conversion? O desperate Sinner, that darest to hope that Christ will put the Lye upon his Father, and nullify his Word, to save thee! 4. <HI>To his Wisdom▪</HI> For this wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to throw away the choicest Mercies on them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would not value them, nor were any way suited to them. <HI>First,</HI> They would not value them. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣sanctified Sinner puts but little Price upon GOD's great Salvation, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.5. He sets no more by Christ, than the Whole by the Physician, <HI>Matth.</HI> 9. 12. He prizeth not his Balm, values not his Cure tramples upon his Blood, <HI>Heb.</HI> 20, 29. Now, would it stand with Wisdom, to force pardon and life upon them that would give him no thanks for them? Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the All-wise God (when he hath forbidden us to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it) thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his holy Things to Dogs, and his Pearls to Swine, that would (as it were) but turn again, and rend him? <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.6.

<P N="2">II. <HI>Against his Word:</HI> We need not say, <HI>Who shall ascend into Heaven, to bring down Christ from above? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who shall descend into the Deep, to bring up Christ from beneath?

One Word, one would think, were enough from Christ; but how oft and earnestly doth he reiterate it? <HI>Verily, verily, verily, Except a Man be born again, he shall not see the King∣dom of God,</HI> John 3.3, 5 Yea, he doth not only assert, but prove the Necessity of the New birth, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Fleshliness and Filthiness of Man's First birth, <HI>John</HI> 3.6. by Reason of which, Man is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more fit for Heaven, than the Beast is for the Cham∣ber of the King's Presence.

<P N="3">III. <HI>Against his Oath.</HI> He hath lifted up his Hand to Heaven, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath sworn, that those that remain in Unbelief, and know not his Ways (that is, are

And would not this be a distracted Hope?</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Against his Honour.</HI> God will so shew his love to the Sinner, as withal to shew his hatred to Sin. Therefore, he that names the name of Jesus must de∣part from Iniquity, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.19. and deny all Un∣godliness: And he that hath hope of Life by Christ, must purify himself, as he is pure, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3 3. <HI>Titus</HI> 2.12. otherwise Christ would be thought a favourer of Sin. The Lord Jesus would have all the World to know, tho' he pardon sin, he will not protect it. If holy <HI>David</HI> shall say, <HI>Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity,</HI> Psalm 6.8. and shall shut the Doors a∣gainst them, <HI>Psalm</HI> 101.7. shall not such much more expect it from Christ's Holiness? would it be for his Honour, to have the Dogs to the Table, or to lodge the Swine with his Children, or to have <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bosom to be a Nest of Vipers?</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Against his Offices,</HI> God hath exalted him to be a <HI>Prince and a Saviour,</HI> Acts 5.31. He should act against both, should he save Men in their Sins? It is the Office of a King,
<Q>Parcere subjectis, &amp; debellare superbos.</Q></P>
<P><HI>To be a Terror to Evil doers, and a Praise to them that do well,</HI> Rom. 14.34. <HI>He is a Minister of God, a Re∣venger to execute Wrath on him that doth Evil.</HI> Now,
<PB N="60" REF="004663_0084_100DD7CA300365A8"/>
should Christ favour the ungodly, (so continuing) and take those to reign with him that would not that he should reign over them? <HI>Luke</HI> 19.27. this were quite against his Office; He therefore reigns, that he may put his Enemies under his Feet, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.24. Now, should he lay them in his Bosom, he should cross the end of his regal power. It belongs to Christ, as a King, to subdue Hearts, and stay the Lusts of his chosen, <HI>Psalm</HI> 45.5. and 110.3. What King would take the rebels, in open hostility, into his Court? What were this, but to betray life, king∣dom, Government, and all together? It Christ be a King, he must have Homage, Honours, Subjection, <HI>&amp;c. Mal.</HI> 1.6. Now, to save Men while in their natural enmity, were to obscure his Dignity, lose his Authority, bring a Contempt on his Government, and sell his dear bought Rights for nought.</P>
<P>Again, as Christ should not be a Prince, so nei∣ther a Saviour, if he should do this; for his Salva∣tion is spiritual: He is called Jesus, because he saves his People <HI>from</HI> their Sins, <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.21. so that should he save them <HI>in</HI> their Sins, he should be neither Lord nor Jesus. To save Men from the Punishment, and not from the Power of Sin, were to do his Work by halves, and be an imperfect Saviour. His Office, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Deliverer,</HI> is, <HI>to turn away Ungodliness from</HI> Jacob <HI>Rom</HI> 11.26.

greatest Part will be as they have been, and do as they have done I know the Drunkard will to his Vomit again, and the Deceiver will to his Deceit again, and the lustful Wanton to his Dalliance again: Alas! that I must leave you where you were; in your Ignorance or Looseness, or in your lifeless For∣mality and customary Devotions! However, I will sit down and bemoan my fruitless Labours, and spend some Sighs over my perishing Hearers.</P>
<P>O distracted Sinners! What will their End be? <HI>What will they do in the Day of Visitation? Whither will they flee for Help? Where will they leave their Glory?</HI> Is. 10 3 How powerfully hath Sin bewitch'd them? How effectually hath the god of this World blinded them? How strong is their Delusion? How uncir∣cumcised their Ears? How obdurate their Hearts? Satan hath them at his Beck. But how long may I call, and can get no Answer? I may dispute with them Year after Year, and they will give me the hear∣ing, and that is all. They must and will have their Sins, say what I will: Tho' I tell them there is Death in the Cup, yet they will take it up; Tho' I tell them 'tis the Broad-way, and endeth in Destruc∣tion, yet they will go on in it: I warn them, yet cannot win them. Sometimes I think, the Mercies of God will melt them, and his winning Invitations will overcome them, but I find them as they were. Sometimes, that the Terror of the Lord will per∣suade them; yet neither will this do it. They will approve the Word, like the Sermon, commend the Preacher; but they will yet live as they did They will not deny me, yet they will not obey me. They will flock to the Word of God, and sit before me as his People, and hear my Words; but they will not do them. They value, and will plead for Ministers, and I am to them as the lovely Song of one that hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleasant Voice; yet I cannot get them to come under <HI>Christ</HI>'s Yoke. They love me, and will be ready to say, they will do any thing for me; but for my Life, I cannot persuade them to leave their Sins, to fore-go their evil Company, their Intemperance,
<PB N="64" REF="004663_0088_100DE95921601140"/>
their unjust Gain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I cannot prevail with them to set up Prayer in their Families and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osets, yet they will promise me, like the forward Son, that said, <HI>I go, Sir, but went not,</HI> Matth 21.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. I cannot persuade them to learn the Principles of Religion, tho' else <HI>they will die without Knowledge.</HI> Job 36.12. I tell them their Misery, but they will not be∣lieve but 'tis well enough: If I tell them particu∣larly, I fear for such Reasons their state is bad, they will judge me censorious, or if they be at present a little awakened, are quickly lull'd asleep by Satan again, and have lost the Sense of all.</P>
<P>Alas for my poor Hearers! must they perish at last by Hundreds, when Ministers would so fain save them? What Course shall I use with them, that I have not tried? <HI>What shall I do for the Daughter of my People?</HI> Jer. 9.7. <HI>O Lord God, help. Alas! shall I leave them thus? If they will not hear me, yet do thou hear me: Oh that they might yet live in thy Sight! O Lord, save them, or else they perish. My Heart would melt to see their Houses on Fire about their Ears, when they were fast asleep in their Beds, and shall not my Soul be moved within me, to see them falling into endless Perdition! Lord, have Compassion, and save them out of the Burning: Put forth thy divine Power, and the Work will be done: But as for me, I cannot prevail.</HI></P>

<P>WHile we keep aloof in generals, there is little fruit to be expected: It is the Hand fight that does execution. <HI>David</HI> is not awaken'd by the Pro∣phet's hovering at a Distance, in parabolical Insinu∣ations: He is forced to close with him, and tell him Home, <HI>Thou art the Man.</HI> Few will, in Words, deny the Necessity of the New-birth; but they have a Self-deluding Confidence, that the work is not now to do: And because they know themselves free from that gross Hypocrisy, that doth take up Religion merely for a colour to deceive others, and for the Covering of wicked Designs, they are confident of their

Sincerity, and suspect not that more close Hypocrisy (where the greatest Danger lies) by which a Man de∣ceiveth his own Soul, <HI>Ja.</HI> 1.26. But Man's deceitful Heart is such a matchless Cheat; and Self-delusion so reigning and so fatal a Disease, that I know not whether be the greater, the difficulty, or displicency or the necessity of the undeceiving Work that I am now upon. Alas, for my unconverted Hearers, they must be undeceived, or undone. But how shall this be effected? <HI>Hic labor, hoc opus est.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Help, O All searching Light! and let thy discerning Eye discover the rotten Foundation of the Self deceiver; and lead me, O Lord God, as thou didst the Prophet, into the Chambers of Imagery, and dig through the Wall of Sinners Hearts, and discover the hidden Abominations that are lurking out of sight, in the dark. Oh send thine Angel before me, to open the sundry Wards of their Hearts, as thou didst before</HI> Peter, <HI>and make even the Iron gates to fly open of their own Accord. And as</HI> Jonathan <HI>no sooner tasted the Honey, but his Eyes were enlightened; so grant, O Lord, that when the poor deceived Souls with whom I have to do, shall cast their Eyes upon these Lines, their Minds may be illuminated, and their Consciences convinced and awakened, that they may see with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and be converted, that thou mayest heal them.</HI></P>
<P>This must be premised, before we proceed to the Discovery, That it is most certain Men may have a confident Perswasion, that their Hearts and States be good, and yet be unsound. Hear the Truth him∣self, who shews in <HI>Laodicea</HI>'s Case, that Men may be wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and yet not know it; yea, they may be confident they are rich, and increased in Grace▪ <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. <HI>There is a Generation that is pure in their own Eyes, and yet is not washed from their own Filthiness,</HI> Prov. 30.12. Who better perswaded of his Case than <HI>Paul,</HI> while yet he remained unconverted? <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. So that they are miserably deceived, that take a strong Confidence, for a sufficient Evidence. They
<PB N="66" REF="004663_0090_100DE11BF1299628"/>
that have no better Proof, than barely a strong Per∣swasion, that they are converted, are certainly as yet Strangers to Conversion.</P>
<P>But to come more close; as it was said of the Adherents of Antichrist, so here; some of the Un∣converted carry their Mark in the Foreheads more openly; and some in their Hands more covertly. The Apostle reckons up some, upon whom he writes the Sentence of Death, as in these dreadful Cata∣logues, which I beseech you to attend with all Dili∣gence, Eph. 5.5, 6. <HI>For this you know, that no Whore-monger, nor unclean Person, nor covetous Man, who is an Idolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ, and of God: Let no Man deceive you with vain Words; for because of these Things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of Disobedience,</HI> Rev. 21.8. <HI>But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abo∣minable, and Murderers, and Whore-mongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Lyars, shall have their Part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimstone, which is the Second Death.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <HI>Know ye not, that the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither Fornica∣tors, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God,</HI> See Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. Wo to them that have their Names written in these Bead-rolls: Such may know as certainly as if God had told it them from Heaven, that they are unsanctified, and under an Impossibility of being saved in this Condition.</P>
<P>There are then these several Sorts, that, past all dispute, are unconverted; they carry their Marks in their Foreheads.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Unclean.</HI> These are ever reckoned among the Goats, and have their Names, whoever be left out, in all the fore mentioned Catalogues, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.9, 10.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Drunkards.</HI> Not only such as drink away their Reason, but withall, yea, above all, such as are too strong for strong drink: The Lord fills his Mouth with Woes against these, and declares them to have no Inheritance in the Kingdom of God, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.11, 12, 22. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.21.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Lyars.</HI> The God that cannot lie hath told them, that there is no place for them in his Kingdom, no entrance into his Hill; but their Portion is with the Father of Lies (whose Children they are) in the Lake of Burnings, <HI>Psalm</HI> 15.1, 2. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8, 27. <HI>James</HI> 8.44. <HI>Prov.</HI> 6.17.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Swearers.</HI> The End of these, without deep and speedy Repentance, is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ift Destruction, and most certain and unavoidable Condemnation, <HI>James</HI> 5.12. <HI>Zech.</HI> 5.1, 2, 3.</P>

<P N="7">7. <HI>Thieves:</HI> Extortioners, Oppressors, that grind the Poor, over-reach their Brethren when they have them at an Advantage: These must know that <HI>God is the Avenger of all such,</HI> 1 Thess. 4.6.

<P N="8">8. <HI>All that do ordinarily live in the profane Neglect of God's Worship,</HI> that hear not his Word, that call not on his Name, that restrain Prayer before God, that mind not their own, nor their Families Souls, but live without God in the World, <HI>John</HI> 8.47. and 15: 4. <HI>Psalm</HI> 14.4. and 79.6. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12. and 4.18.</P>

<P>Sinner, consider diligently whether thou art not to be found in one of these Ranks! for if this be thy Case, thou art in the Gall of Bitterness, and Bond of Iniquity; for all these do carry their Marks in their Foreheads, and are undoubtedly the Sons of Death;</P>
<P>And if so, the Lord pity our poor Congregations. Oh, how little a Number would be left, when these ten Sorts are left out? Alas, on how many Doors, on how many Faces must we write, Lord, have Mercy upon us! Sirs, what shift do you make to keep up your Confidence of your good Estate, when God from Heaven declares against you, and pronounces you in a State of Damnation? I would reason with you, as God with them; how canst thou say, I am not pollu∣ted? <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.23: See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done. Man, is not thy Conscience privy to thy tricks of Deceit, to thy Chamber-pranks, to thy Way of lying? Yea, are not thy Friends, thy Family, thy Neighbours, Witnesses to thy prophane Neglects of God's Worship, to thy covetous Practices, to thy envious and malicious Carriage! May not they point at thee, as thou goest, There goes a gaming Prodi∣gal; There goes a drunken <HI>Nabal,</HI> a Companion of Evil-doers; There goes a Railer or a Scoffer, a loose Liver, Beloved, God hath written it, as with a Sun∣beam, in the Book out of which you must be judged, that these are not the Spots of his Children, and that none such (except renewed by converting Grace) shall ever escape the Damnation of Hell.</P>
<P>Oh that such of you would now be persuaded to repent and turn from all your Transgressions; or else Iniquity will be your Ruin! <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.30. Alas, for
<PB N="69" REF="004663_0093_100DE121AD0DEB98"/>
poor hardned Sinners! Must I leave you at last where you were? Must I leave the Tipler still at the Ale∣bench? Must I leave the wanton still at Dalliance? Must I leave the malicious still in his Venom? And the Drunkard still at his Vomit? However you must know that you have been warned, and that I am clear of your Blood. And whether Men will hear, or whe∣ther they will forbear, I will leave these Scriptures with them, either as Thunder-bolts to awaken them, or as searing Irons to harden them to a reprobate Sense, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.21. <Q>God shall wound the Head of his Enemies, and the hairy Scalp of such an one as goeth on still in their Trespasses, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.1. He that, being often reproved, hardneth his Neck shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without Remedy, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24, &amp;c. Because I have called, and ye refu∣sed: I have stretched out my Hand and no Man re∣garded, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I will mock at your Calamity,</Q>— when your Destruction cometh as a Whirlwind.</P>
<P>And now I imagine, many will begin to bless themselves, and think all is well, because they can∣not be spotted with the grosser Evils above-mention∣ed. But I must further tell you, that there are ano∣ther Sort of unsanctified Persons, that carry not their Marks in their Fore-heads, but more secretly and covertly in their Hands: These do frequently de∣ceive themselves and others, and pass for good Chris∣tians, when they are all the while unsound at Bot∣tom. Many pass undiscovered▪ till Death and Judg∣ment bring all to light. These Self-deceivers seem to come even to Heaven's Gate with Confidence of their Admission, and yet are turned off at last, <HI>Mat</HI> 7.22. Brethren, beloved, I beseech you deeply to lay to heart, and firmly to retain this awakning Consi∣deration; That Multitudes miscarry by the Hand of some secret Sin, that is not only hidden from others, but (for want of observing their own Hearts) even from themselves. A Man may be free from open Polluti∣ons, and yet die at last by the fatal Hand of some un∣observed Iniquity: And there be these twelve hidden Sins, by which Souls go down by Numbers into the
<PB N="70" REF="004663_0094_100DE1235FEAE9E8"/>
Chambers of Death. These you must search carefully for, and take them as black Marks (wherever they be found) discovering a graceless and unconverted Estate: And as you love your Lives, read carefully, with a holy Jealousy of yourselves, lest you should be the Persons concerned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Gross Ignorance.</HI> Ah, how many poor Souls doth this Sin kill in the dark, <HI>Hos.</HI> 4.6. while they think verily they have good Hearts, and are in the ready Way to Heaven! This is the Murderer that dispatch∣eth thousands in a silent Manner, when (poor Hearts) they suspect nothing, and see not the Hand that mis∣chiefs them. You shall find whatever Excuses you have for Ignorance, that it is a Soul-undoing Evil, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.21. 2 <HI>Thess</HI> 1. S. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3. Ah! would it not have pitied a Man's Heart to have seen that woful Spectacle, when the poor Protestants were shut up, a Multitude together, in a Barn, and a Butcher comes, with his inhuman Hands warm in human Blood, and leads them, one by one, blind-fold to a Block, where he slew them (poor Innocents!) one after an∣other, by Scores, in cold Blood? But how much more should our Hearts bleed, to think of the hun∣dreds in great Congregations, that Ignorance doth bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher in secret, and lead them blindfold to the Block? Beware this be none of your Case; Make no Pleas for Ignorance. If you spare that Sin, know that that will not spare you. Will a Man keep a Murderer in his Bosom?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some Reserves in closing with Christ.</HI> To forsake all for Christ; to hate Father and Mother, yea, and a Man's own Life for him; this is a hard saying, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.26. Some will do much, but they will not be of the Religion that will undo them; they never come to be intirely devoted to Christ, not ful∣ly to resign to him; they must have the sweet Sin, they mean to do themselves no harm; they have se∣cret Exceptions for Life, Liberty, or Estate: Many take Christ thus hand over head, and never consider his self-denying Terms, nor cast up the Cost; and this Error in the Foundation marrs all, and sweetly

ruins them forever, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.28. <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.21.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Formality in Religion.</HI> Many stick in the Bark, and rest in the outside of Religion, and in the exter∣nal Performances of holy Duties, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.35. And this oft-times doth most effectually deceive Men; and doth more certainly undo them, than open loose∣ness; as it was in the <HI>Pharisee</HI>'s Case, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.21. They hear, they fast, they pray, they give Alms; and therefore will not believe but their Case is good, <HI>Luke.</HI> 18.11. Whereas resting in the Works done, and coming short of the Heart-work, and the inward Power and Vitals of Religion, they fall at last into the Burning, from the flattering Hopes and confident Persuasions of their being in the ready Way to Hea∣ven, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.22.23. O dreadful Case, when a Man's Religion shall serve only to harden him, and effectually to delude and deceive his own Soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Prevalency of false Ends in holy Duties,</HI> Mat. 23.25. This was the Bane of the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> Oh, how many a poor Soul is undone by this, and drops into Hell, before he discerns the Mistake! He per∣forms good Duties, and so thinks all is well, and perceives not that he is <HI>actuated</HI> by carnal Motives all the while: It is too true, that even with the truly sanctified, many carnal Ends will often-times creep in; but they are Matter of his hatred and hu∣miliation, and never come to be habitually prevail∣ing with him, and to bear the greatest Sway, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.7. But now, when the main Thing that doth ordinarily carry a Man out to religious Duties, shall be some carnal End, as to satisfy his Conscience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> get the Repute of being religious, to be seen of Men, to shew his own Gifts and Parts, to avoid the Re∣proach of a prophane and irreligious Person, or the like; this discovers an unsound Heart, <HI>Hos.</HI> 19.1: <HI>Zach.</HI> 7.5, 6. O Christians, if you would avoid Self-conceit, see that you mind, not only your Acts, but withall, yea, above all, your Ends.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Trusting in their own Righteousness,</HI> Luke 18.9. This is a Soul-undoing Mischief, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. When Men do trust in their own Righteousness, they do
<PB N="72" REF="004663_0096_100DE12B1C0FEA08"/>
indeed reject Christ. Beloved, you had need b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> watchful on every Hand; for not only your Sins, but your Duties may undo you: It may be you ne∣ver thought of this, but so it is, that a Man may a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> certainly miscarry by his seeming Righteousness, and supposed Graces, as by gross Sins; and that is, when a Man doth trust to these as his Righteousness before God, for the satisfying his Justice, appeasing his Wrath, procuring his Favour, and obtaining of his own Pardon; for this is to put Christ out of Office, and make a Saviour of our own Duties and Graces. Beware of this, O Professors! you are much in Du∣ties, but this one Fly will spoil all the Ointment. When you have done most, and best, be sure to go out of yourselves to Christ, reckon your own Righteousness as filthy Rags, <HI>Psalm</HI> 143.2. <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.8. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 64 6. <HI>Nah.</HI> 13.22.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>A secret Enmity against the Strictness of Religion.</HI> Many moral Persons, punctual in their formal Devo∣tion, have yet a bitter Enmity against Preciseness, and hate the Life and Power of Religion, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.6. compared with <HI>Acts</HI> 9.1. They like not this For∣wardness, nor that Men should keep such a Stir in Religion: They condemn the Strictness of Religion, as Singularity, Indiscretion, and intemperate Zeal: And with them, a lively Preacher, or lively Christi∣an, is but a Heady-fellow. These Men love not Ho∣liness, as Holiness (for then they would love the Height of Holiness,) and therefore are undoubtedly rotten at Heart, whatever good Opinion they have of themselves.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The Resting in a certain Pitch of Religion.</HI> When they have so much as will save them (as they suppose) they look no further, and so shew themselves short of true Grace, which will ever put Men upon aspi∣ring to further Perfection, <HI>Philip.,</HI> 3.13. <HI>Prov.</HI> 4 18.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>The predominant Love of the World.</HI> This is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sure Evidence of an unsanctified Heart, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.31 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.15.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="004663_0097_100DE12DB56C6FF8"/>
such a Power of Deceit is there in this Sin, that many times, when every Body else can see the Man's Worldliness, and <HI>Covetousness,</HI> he cannot see it him∣self; but hath so many Colours, and Excuses, and Pretences for his Eagerness on the World, that he doth blind his own Eyes, and perish in his Self-Deceit. How many Professors be here, with whom the World hath more of their Hearts and Affections than Christ▪ Who mind earthly things, and thereby are evident∣ly after the Flesh, and like to end in Destruction? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 5. <HI>Philip.</HI> 3, 19. Yet ask these Men, and they will tell you confidently, they prize Christ a∣bove all, God forbid else! And see not their own Earthly-mindedness, for Want of a narrow Observa∣tion of the Workings of their own Hearts. Did they but carefully search, they would quickly find, that their greatest Content is in the World, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.19. and their greatest Care, and main Endeavour to get and secure the World; which are the certain Disco∣very of an unconverted Sinner. May the professing Part of the World take earnest heed, that they perish not by the Hand of this Sin unobserved.

<P>SO unspeakably dreadful is the Case of every Un∣converted Soul, that I have sometimes thought, if we could, but convince Men that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e yet

unregenerate, the Work were upon the Matter done. But I sadly experience, that such a Spirit of sloth and slumber (<HI>Rom.</HI> 11.8. <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.15.) possesseth the unsanctified, that tho' they be convinced that they are yet unconverted, yet they oft-times carelesly sit still; and what through the Avocation of sensual Pleasures, or Hurry of Wordly Business, or Noise and Clamour of Earthly Cares, and Lusts, and Affec∣tions, <HI>Luke</HI> 8.14. the Voice of Conscience is drown∣ed, and Men go no farther than some cold Wishes, and general Purposes of repenting and amending, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.25.</P>
<P>It is therefore of high Necessity, that I do not only convince Men that they are unconverted, but that I also endeavour to bring them to a Sense of the fearful Misery of this Estate.</P>
<P>But here I find my self a-ground at first putting forth. What Tongue can tell the Heirs of Hell sufficiently of their Misery, unless 'twere <HI>Dives</HI>'s in that Flame? <HI>Luke</HI> 16.24. Where is the ready Writer whose Pen can decipher their Misery, that are with∣out God in the World? <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12. This cannot fully be done, unless we knew the infinite Ocean of that Bliss and Perfection which is in that God, which a State of Sin doth exclude Men from: <HI>Who knoweth</HI> (saith <HI>Moses) the Power of thine Anger?</HI> Psalm 90.11. And how shall I tell Men that which I do not know? Yet so much we know, as one would think, would shake the Heart of that Man that had the least Degree of spiritual Life and Sense.</P>
<P>But this is yet the more posing Difficulty, that I am to speak to them that are without Sense. Alas, this is not the least Part of Man's Misery upon him, that he is dead, stark dead in Trespasses and Sins, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1.</P>

If the unreasonable and inanimate Creatures had Speech and Reason, they would cry out under it, as Bondage unsufferable, to be abused by the ungodly, contrary to their Natures, and the Ends that the great Creator made them for.

And if God should open the Mouths of the Creatures, as he did the Mouth of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s Ass, the proud Man's Garment on his Back would groan against him. There is ne∣ver a Creature, but if it had Reason to know how it is abused, till a Man be converted, it would groan against him: The Land would groan to bear him, the Air would groan to give him breathing, their Houses would groan to lodge them, their fleds would groan to ease them, their Food to nourish them, their Cloaths to cover them, and the Creature would groan to give them any Help and Comfort, so long as they live in Sin against God.</Q> Thus far he.

No, if thou but say the Word, he shall be Breathless for me. His poor Beast would say, Lord, must I carry him upon his wicked Designs?

If he suggest a Lie, or prompt you to Revenge, you readily obey: If he forbid you to read or pray, you hearken to him, and therefore his Servants you are.

Dost thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>augh at Hell and Destruction? or canst thou drink the envenomed Cup of the Almighty's Fury, as if it were but a common Potion?</P>
<P>Gird up now thy Loins like a Man, for I will de∣mand of thee, and answer thou me, <HI>Job</HI> 40.7. Art thou such a <HI>Leviathan,</HI> as that the Scales of thy Pride should keep thee from thy Maker's coming at thee? Wilt thou esteem his Arrows as Straw, and the Instru∣ments of Death as rotten Wood? Art thou Chief of all the Children of Pride, even that thou shouldest count his Darts as Stubble, and laugh at the Shaking of his Spear? Art thou made without Fear, and con∣temnest thou his barbed Irons? <HI>Job</HI> 41. Art thou like the Horse that paweth in the Valley, and rejoiceth in his Strength, who goeth out to meet the armed Men? Dost thou mock at Fear, and art not affrighted, neither turnest back from God's Sword, when his Quiver rai∣leth against thee, the glittering Spear and the Shield? <HI>Job</HI> 39.21, 22, 23. Well, if the Threats and Calls of the Word will not fear thee, nor awaken thee, I am sure Death and Judgment will. Oh, what wilt thou do when the Lord cometh forth against thee, and in his Fury falleth upon thee, and thou shalt feel what thou readest! If when <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Enemies were cast in∣to the Den of Lions, both they, and their Wives, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Children, the Lions had the Mastery of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd brake all their Bones in Pieces, ere ever they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame at the Bottom of the Den, <HI>Daniel</HI> 6.24. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall be done with thee, when thou fallest into the Hands of the living God? When he shall gripe thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his Iron-arms, and grind and crush thee to a thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and Pieces in his Wrath?</P>
<P>Oh, do not then contend with God, Repent and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e converted, so none of this shall come upon thee, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa.</HI> 55.6, 7. <HI>Seek the Lord while be may be found; call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon him while he is near.

<P>And there came one, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, What shall I do that I may inherit Eternal Life?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEfore thou readest these Directions, I advise thee, yea, I charge thee before God, and His Holy Angels, to resolve to follow them (as far as Consci∣ence shall be convinced of their Agreeableness to God's Word, and thy Estate) and strive in his Assistance and Blessing that they may succeed. And as I have sought the Lord, and consulted his Oracles, what Advice to give thee, so must thou entertain it with that awe, reverence, and purpose of Obedience, that the Word of the living God doth require.</P>
<P>Now then attend, <HI>Set thine Heart unto all that I seal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> testify unto thee in this Day; for it is not a vain Thing, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is your Life,</HI> Deut. 32.46. That is the End of all that has been spoken hitherto, to bring you to set upon turning, and making use of God's Means for you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conversion. I would not trouble you, nor tormen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you before the Time, with the Fore-thoughts of you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eternal Misery, but in order to your making you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Escape. Were you shut up under your present Mi∣sery, without Remedy, it were but Mercy (as one speaks) to let you alone, that you might take i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that little poor Comfort that you are capable of, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this World: But you may yet be happy, if yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do not wilfully refuse the Means of your Recovery Behold, I hold open the Door unto you; arise, tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Flight: I set the Way of Life before you: wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in it, and you shall live, and not die, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jer.</HI> 9 16.

ravished by the King, and hereupon exciting the Duke, her Father, to Revenge, he called in the <HI>Moors</HI> to his help; who, when they had executed his Design, miserably wasted and spoiled the Country, which this Virgin laying so exceedingly to Heart, shut her self up in a Tower belonging to her Father's House, and desired her Farher and Mother might be called forth, and bewailing to them her own Wretchedness, that she should have occasioned so much Misery and Desolation to her Country for the satisfying of her Revenge, she told them she was re∣solved to be avenged upon herself. Her Father and Mother besought her to pity her self and them, but Nothing could prevail, but she took her Leave of them, and threw her self off the Battlements, and so perished before their Faces.</P>
<P>Just thus is the wilful Destruction of ungodly Men. The God that made them beseecheth them, and crying out to them, as <HI>Paul</HI> to the distracted Jaylor, when about to murder himself, <HI>Do thy self no harm.</HI> The Ministers of Christ forewarn them, and follow them, and fain would have them back; but alas! no Expostulations nor Obtestations will prevail, but Men will hurry themselves into Perdition, while Pity itself looketh on.</P>
<P>What shall I say? Would it not grieve a Person of any Humanity, if in the Time of a reigning Plague he should have a Receipt (as one said well) that would infallibly cure all the Country, and recover the most hopeless Patients, and yet his Friends and Neighbours should die by the Hundreds about him, because they would not use it? Men and Brethren, tho' you carry the certain Symptons of Death in your Faces, yet I have a Receipt that will cure you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, that will cure infallibly; follow but these few Directions, and if you do not then win Heaven, I will be content to lose it.</P>
<P>Hear then, O Sinner! and as ever thou wouldst be converted and saved, embrace this following Counsel.</P>
<P>Direct. I <HI>Set it down with thyself, as an undoubted Truth, that it is impossible for thee ever to get to Heaven in

Doth he not keep the Keys of Heaven? And canst thou get in without his leave? As thou must, if ever thou comest thither in thy natural Con∣dition, without a sound and thorow Renovation?</P>
<P>Direct. II. <HI>Labour to get a thorow Sight and lively Sense and Feeling of thy Sins.</HI> Till Men are weary and heavy laden, and pricked at the Heart, and stark sick of Sin, they will not come unto Christ, in his Way, for Ease and Cure; nor to purpose enquire, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> Matth. 11.28. Acts 2.37. Matth. 9.12. They must set themselves down for dead Men before they will come unto Christ, that they may have Life, <HI>John</HI> 5.40. Labour therefore to set all thy Sins in Order before thee; never be afraid to look upon them, but let thy Spirit make diligent Search, <HI>Psal.</HI> 77.6 Enquire into thine Heart and into thy Life; enter into a thorow Examination of thy self, and of all thy Ways, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.59. that thou mayest make a full Discovery: and call in the Help of God's Spirit, in the Sense of thine own Inability hereunto, for it is his proper Work to convince of Sin, <HI>John</HI> 16.8. Spread all before the Face of thy Conscience, till thine Heart and Eyes be set abroach. Leave not striving with God, and thine own Soul, till it cry out under the Sense of thy Sins, as the enlightned Jailor, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> Acts 16.30. To this Purpose,</P>

body but 'tis poisoned with Sin? What Duty dost thou ever perform, into which Poison is not shed? Oh, how great is the Sum of thy Debts, who hast been all thy Life long running upon the Books, and never didst, nor canst pay off one Penny? Look over the Sin of thy Nature, and all its cursed Brood, the Sins of thy Life; call to Mind thy Omissions, Commis∣sions, the Sins of thy Thoughts, of thy Words, of thine Actions, the Sins of thy Youth, the Sins of thy Years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be not like a desperate Bankrupt, that is afraid to look over his Books.

that deadly Poison, so powerful of Operation, as that one Drop of it shed upon the Root of Mankind, hath corrupted, spoiled, and poisoned, and undone his whole Race at once, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.18, 19. This is the common Butcher, the bloody Executioner, that hath killed the Prophets, burnt the Martyrs, murdered all the Apostles, all the Patriarchs, all the Kings and Potentates, that hath destroyed Cities, swallowed Empires, butchered and devoured whole Nations Whatever was the Weapon that 'twas done by, Sin was it that did Execution, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. Dost thou yet think it but a small Thing? If <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Children could be digged out of their Graves, and their Bodies piled up to Heaven, and an Inquest were made, what matchless Murderer were guilty of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Blood; it would be all found in the Skirts of Sin. Study the Nature of Sin, till thy Heart be brought to fear and loath it. And meditate on the Aggrava∣tions of thy particular Sins, how thou hast sinned against all God's Warnings, against thine own Pray∣ers, against Mercies, against Corrections, against clearest Light, against freest Love, against thine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Resolutions, against Promises, Vows, Covenants o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better Obedience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Charge thine Heart home wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Things, till it blush for Shame, and be brought out of all good Opinion of itself, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9.6.</P>

hateful Deformity of thy Nature, than to see the Devil. There is no Mire so unclean, no Vomit so loathsom, no Carcase or Carrion to offensive, no Plague or Leprosy so noisom, as Sin, in which thou art all inrolled, and covered with its odious Filth, whereby thou art rendered more displeasing to the pure and holy Nature of the glorious God, than the most filthy Object, composed of whatever is hateful to all thy Senses, can be to thee, <HI>John</HI> 15.15, 16. Couldst thou take up a Toad into thy Bosom? Couldst thou cherish it, and take Delight in it?

it, of an Habitation of Holiness, to become a very Hell of iniquity, <HI>James</HI> 3.6. This is that that hath defiled, corrupted, perverted all thy Members, and turned them into Weapons of Unrighteousness, and Servants of Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.19. that hath filled the Head with carnal and corrupt Designs, <HI>Mic.</HI> 2.1. the Hand with sinful Practices, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.15. the Eye with Wan∣dring and Wantonness, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.14. the Tongue with deadly Poison, <HI>James</HI> 3.8. that hath opened the Ears to Tales, Flattery, and filthy Communication, and shut them against the Instruction of Life, <HI>Zech.</HI> 7.11, 12. and hath rendered thy Heart a very Mint and Forge for Sin, and the cursed Womb of all deadly Concep∣tions, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.16. so that it poureth forth its Wic∣kedness without ceasing, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.14. even as natural∣ly, freely and unweariedly, as a Fountain doth pour forth its Waters, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.7. or the raging Sea doth cast forth Mire and Dirt, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.20. And wilt thou yet be in Love with thyself, and tell us any longer of thy good Heart? Oh, never leave meditating on this desperate Contagion of original Corruption, till, with <HI>Ephraim,</HI> thou bemoan thyself, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.8: and with deepest Shame and Sorrow, smite on thy Breast, as the <HI>Publican, Luke</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.13. and with <HI>Job</HI> abhor thy self and repent in Dust and Ashes, <HI>Job</HI> 42.6, 22. The particular Evil that thou art most addicted to, find out all its Aggravations, set home upon thy Heart all God's Threatnings against it: Repentance drives before it the whole Herd, but especially sticks the Arrow in the beloved Sin, and singles this out above the rest, to run it down, <HI>Psal.</HI> 11.23. Oh, labour to make this Sin odious to thy Soul, and double thy Guards, and thy Resolutions, against it, because this hath, and doth most dishonour God, and endanger thee.</P>
<P>Direct. III. <HI>Strive to affect thy Heart with a deep Sense of thy present Misery.</HI> Read over the foregoing Chap∣ter again and again, and get it out of the Book, into thine Heart. Remember when thou liest down, that for aught thou knowest, thou mayst awake in Flames, and when thou risest up, that by the next Night
<PB N="109" REF="004663_0133_100DE0044A983FF0"/>
thou mayst make thy Bed in Hell. Is it a jesting Mat∣ter to live in such a fearful Case? To stand tottering upon the Brink of the Bottomless-pit, and to live at the Mercy of every Disease, that if it will but fall upon thee, will send thee forthwith into the Burnings? Suppose thou sawest a condemned Wretch hanging over <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s burning fiery Furnace, by nothing but a Twine-Thread, which were ready to break every Moment, would not thy Heart tremble for such an One? Why, thou art the Man. This is thy very Case, O Man, Woman, that readest this, if thou be yet unconverted. What if the Thread of thy Life should break? (Why, thou knowest not but it may be the next Night, yea, the next Moment) Where wouldst thou be then? Whither wouldst thou drop? Verily upon the Crack but of this Thread, thou fallest into the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimstone; where thou mayest lie scalding and swel∣tering in a fiery Ocean, while God hath a Being, if thou die in thy present Case. And doth not thy Soul tremble as thou readest? Doth not thy Tears bedew the Paper, and thy Heart throb in thy Bosom? Dost thou not yet begin to smite on thy Breast, and bethink thy self what Need thou hast of a Change? Oh, what is thy Heart made of? Hast thou not only lost all Regard to God, but art without any Love and Pity to thy self?</P>
<P>Oh, study thy Misery, till thy Heart do cry out for Christ, as earnestly as ever a drowning Man did for a Boat, or the Wounded for a Chirurgeon: Men must come to see the Danger, and feel the Smart of their deadly Sores and Sickness, or else Christ will be to them a Physician of no Value, <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.12. Then the Man-slayer hastens to the City of Refuge, when pursued by the Avenger of Blood. Men must be even forced and fired out of themselves, or else they will not come to Christ. 'Twas Distress and Extremity that made the Prodigal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk of return∣ing, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.16, 17. While <HI>Laodicea</HI> thinks herself rich, encreased in Goods, in need of Nothing, there is little Hope. She must be deeply convinced of
<PB N="110" REF="004663_0134_100DE194198AFC78"/>
her Wretchedness, Blindness, Poverty, Nakedness, before she will come to Christ for his Gold, Raiment, Eye salve, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17, 18 Therefore hold the Eyes of Conscience open, amplify thy Misery as much as possible, do not fly the Sighs of it, for fear it should fill thee with Terror. The Sense of thy Misery is but (as it were) the Supputation of the Wound, which is necessary to the Cure. Better fear the Torments that abide thee now, than feel them hereafter.</P>
<P>Direct. IV. <HI>Settle it upon thy Heart, that thou art under everlasting Inability ever to recover thy self.</HI> Never think thy Praying, Reading, Hearing, Confessing, Amending, will do the Cure. These must be at∣tended, but thou art undone if thou restest in them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. Thou art a lost Man, if thou hopest to escape drowning upon any other Plank, but Jesus Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. Thou must unlearn thy self, and renounce thine own Wisdom, thine own Righteous∣ness, thine own Strength, and throw thy self wholly upon Christ, as a Man that swimmeth casteth him∣self upon the Water, or else thou canst not escape. While Men trust in themselves, and establish their own Righteousness, and have Confidence in the Flesh, they will not come savingly to Christ, <HI>Luke</HI> 18.9. <HI>Philip</HI> 3.3.

Wilt thou have the merciful, the gracious, the Sin pardoning God to be thy God?

holy, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.16. holy in Heart, holy in Life. Thou must put away all thine Iniquities, be they ne∣ver so near, never so natural, never so necessary to the maintaining thy fleshly Interest. Unless thou wilt be at Defiance with Sin, I cannot be thy God. Cast out the Leaven, put away the Evil of thy Doings, cease to do Evil, learn to do well, or else I can have nothing to do with thee, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.16, 17.18. Bring forth mine Enemies, or there is no Peace to be had with me: What doth thine Heart answer? Lord I desire to have thee as such a God; I desire to be holy, as thou art holy, to be made Partaker of thy Holiness. I love thee, not only for thy Goodness and Mercy, but for thy Holiness and Purity I take thy Holiness for my Happiness. Oh, be to me a Fountain of Holiness, set on me the Stamp and Impress of thy Holiness, I will thankfully part with all my Sins at thy Com∣mand: My wilful Sins I do forthwith forsake; and for my Infirmities that I cannot get rid of, tho' I would, I will strive against them in the Use of the Means. I detest them, and will pray and war against them, and never let them have quiet Rest in my Soul. Beloved, whosoever of you will thus accept of the Lord for his God, he shall have him.</P>
<P>Again, He tells you, I am the all-sufficient God, <HI>Gen</HI> 17.1. Will you lay All at my Feet, and give it up to my Dispose, and take me for thine only Porti∣on?

I set my Hopes in thee, I take up my Rest with thee. Let me hear thee say, I am thy God, thy Salvation, and I have enough, all I wish for. I will make no Terms with thee, but for thyself: Let me but have thee sure, let me be able to make my Claim, and see my Title to thyself; and for other Things, I leave them to thee; give me more or less, any thing, or nothing, I will be satisfied in my God. Take him thus and he is thine own.</P>
<P>Again, He tells you, I am the sovereign Lord: If you will have me for your God, you must give me the Supremacy, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.24. I will not be an Un∣derling: You must not make me a Second to Sin, or any worldly Interest. If you will be my People, I must have the Rule over you; you must not live at your own List. Will you come under my Yoke? Will you bow to my Government? Will you sub∣mit to my Discipline, to my Word, to my Rod? Sinner, What sayest thou to this? Lord, I had rather be at thy Command, than live at mine own List: I had rather have thy Will to be done, than mine: I approve of, and consent to thy Laws, and account it my Privilege to lie under them. And though the Flesh rebel, and often break over Bounds, I am resolved to take no other Lord but thee, I wil∣lingly take the Oath of thy Supremacy, and acknow∣ledge thee for my Liege Sovereign, and resolve all my Days to pay the Tribute of Worship, Obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Love, and Service to thee, and to live to thee, as the End of my Life. This is a right accepting of God.</P>

and depend on my Faithfulness, and take my Bond for your Security? Will you be content to follow me, in Poverty, and Reproach, and Affliction here, and to see much going out, and little coming in, and to tarry till the next World for your Preferment? <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.21. I deal much upon Trust: Will you be content to labour, and suffer, and to tarry for your Returns till the Resurrection of the Just? <HI>Luke</HI> 14.14. The Womb of my Promise will not presently bring forth: Will you have the Patience to wait? <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.36. Now, Beloved, What say you to this? Will you have this God for your God? Will you be content to live by Faith, and trust him for an unseen Happiness, an unseen Heaven, an unseen Glory? Do your Hearts answer, Lord, we will venture ourselves upon thee, we commit ourselves to thee, we roll upon thee, we know whom we have trusted, we are willing to take thy Word, we will prefer thy Promises before our own Possessions, and the Hopes of Heaven before all the Enjoyments of the Earth, we will wait thy Leisure: What thou wilt here, so that we may have but thy faithful Promise for Heaven hereafter? If you can in Truth, and upon Deliberation, thus accept of God, he will be yours. Thus there must be, in a right Conversion to God, a Closing with him suitable to his Excellencies. But when Men close with his Mercy, but yet love Sin, hating Holiness and Purity; or will take him for their Benefactor, but not for their Sovereign; or for their Patron, but not for their Portion; this is no thorow, and no sound Conversion.</P>

If thou diest, 'tis because thou wouldst not come to him for Life, <HI>John</HI> 5.40. Now accept of an offered Christ, and thou art made up for ever: Now give up thy Consent to him, and the Match is made, all the World cannot hin∣der it. Do not stand off because of thine Un∣worthiness. Man, I tell thee, nothing in all the World can undo thee, but thine own Unwilling∣ness Speak, Man; Art thou willing of the Match? Wilt thou have Christ in all his Relations to be thine; thy King, thy Priest, thy Prophet? Wilt thou have him with all his Inconveniencies? Take not Christ Hand over Head, but sit down first, and count the Cost. Wilt thou lay all down at his Feet? Wilt thou be content to run all Hazards with him? Wilt thou take thy Lot with him, fall where it will? Wilt thou deny thyself, take up thy Cross, and fol∣low him? Art thou deliberately, understandingly, freely, fixedly, determined to cleave to him in all Times, and Conditions? If so, my Soul for thine, thou shalt never perish, <HI>John</HI> 3.16. but art passed from Death to Life.

When God's Command crosseth their Inclination,

Art thou resolved, in the Strength of Christ, to set upon the conscientious Practice of every Duty that thou findest to be there required of thee, and to set against every Sin that thou findest there forbidden? This is the Way to be found in God's Statutes, that thou mayest never be ashamed, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.80. 3dly, <HI>Observe the special Duties that thy Heart is most against, and the special Sins it is most inclined to; and see whether it be truly resolved to perform the one, and forego the other.</HI> What sayest thou to thy Bosom-sin, thy gainful Sin? What sayest thou to costly and hazardous, and Flesh displeasing Duties? If thou haltest here, and dost not resolve, by the Grace of God, to cross thy Flesh, and put to it, thou art unsound, <HI>Psal.</HI> 18.23. and 119.6.</P>
<P>Direct. X. <HI>Let all this be compleated in a solemn Covenant between God and thy Soul,</HI> Psalm 119.10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Nch. 10.29. For thy better Help therein, take these following Directions.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Set apart some time, more than once, to be spent in secret before the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In seeking earnestly his special Assistance, and gra∣tious Acceptance of thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In considering distinctly all the Terms or Conditi∣ons of the Covenant, expressed in the Form hereafter proposed.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In searching thine Heart, whether thou art sincerely willing to forsake all thy Sins, and resign up thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Body and Soul, unto God and his Service, to serve him in Holiness and Righteousness, all the Days of thy Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Compose thy Spirit into the most serious Frame possible, suitable to a Transaction of so high Importance.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Lay hold on the Covenant of God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly upon the Promise of giving Grace and Strength,
<PB N="123" REF="004663_0147_100DE0AB14F15FB8"/>
whereby thou mayest be enabled to perform thy Promise. Trust not to thine own Strength, to the Strength of thine own Resolutions, but take hold on his Strength.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Resolve to be faithful; having engaged thine Heart, opened thy Mouth, and subscribed with my Hand unto the Lord, resolve in his Strength never to go back.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Being thus prepared, on some convenient Time set apart for that Purpose, set upon the Work, and in the most solemn Manner possible, as if the Lord were visibly present before thine Eyes, fall down on thy Knees, and spreading forth thine Hands toward Heaven, open thine Heart to the Lord in these, or the like Words.</P>
<P>O Most dreadful God! For the Passion of Thy Son, I beseech Thee accept of thy poor Pro∣digal, now prostrating himself at thy Door: I have fallen from Thee by mine Iniquity, and am by Na∣ture a Son of Death, and a Thousand-fold more the Child of Hell, by my wicked Practice; but of thine Infinite Grace, thou hast promised Grace to me in Christ, if I will but turn to thee with all my Heart:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Terms of our Communion are either from which, or to which.</NOTE> therefore up∣on the Call of thy Gospel, I am now come in; and, throwing down my Weapons, submit my self to thy Mercy.</P>
<P>And because thou requirest, as the Condition of my Peace with thee, that I should put away mine Idols, and be at Defiance with all thine Enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Terms from which we must turn: Sin, Satan, the World, and our own Righte∣ousness, which must be thus renounced.</NOTE> which I acknowledge I have wickedly sided with, against thee; I here from the Bottom of my Heart, renounce them all, firmly covenanting with thee not to allow my self in any known Sin, but conscientiously to use all the Means that I know thou hast prescribed for the Death and utter

Destruction of all my Corruptions. And whereas I have formerly inordinately and idolatrously let out my Affection upon the World, I do here resign up my Heart to thee that madest it, humbly protesting before thy glorious Majesty, that it is the firm Resolution of my Heart; and that I do unfeignedly desire Grace from thee, that when thou shall call me hereunto, I may practise this my Resolution, through thy Assistance, to forsake all that is dear unto me in this World, rather than to turn from thee, to the Ways of Sin; and that I will watch against all its Temptations, whether of Prosperity, or Adversity, left they should withdraw my Heart from thee; beseeching thee also to help me against the Temptations of Satan, to whose wicked Suggestions I resolve by thy Grace, never to yield my self a Servant. And because my own Righteousness is but menstruous Rags, I renounce all Confidence therein, and acknowledge that I am of my self a hopeless, helpless, undone Creature, without Righteousness or Strength.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Terms to which we must turn, are either ultimate, or me∣diate.</NOTE>And for as much as thou hast of thy bottomless Mercy offered most graciously to me wretched Sinner, to be again my GOD, through Christ, if I would accept of thee; I call Heaven and Earth to record this Day, that I do here solemnly avouch thee for the Lord my God; and with all possible Veneration, bowing the Neck of my Soul under the Feet of thy most sacred Majesty, I do here take thee, Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for my Portion, and chief Good;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ultimate is God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who must be thus accepted.</NOTE> and to give up my self, Body and Soul for thy Servant, promising and vowing to serve thee in Holiness and Righteousness all the Days of my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="004663_0149_100DE0AE63F1EF50"/>And since thou hast appointed the Lord Jesus Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The medate Terms are either principal, or less principal.</P>
<P>The principal is Christ the Medi∣ator who must be thus embrac'd.</P></NOTE> the only Means of coming unto thee, I do here, upon the bended Knees of my Soul, accept of him, as the only new and living Way, by which Sinners may have Access to thee; and do hereby solemnly join my self in Marriage-Covenant to him.</P>
<P>O blessed Jesus, I come to thee hungry and hard∣ly bestead, poor and wretched, and miserable, and blind and naked, a most loathsom polluted Wretch; a guilty, condemned Malefactor, unworthy for ever to wash the Feet of the Servants of my Lord, much more to be solemnly married to the King of Glory: But such is thine unparallel'd Love, I do here with all my Power accept thee, and do take thee for my Head and Husband; for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; for all Times and Conditions, to love, honour and obey thee before all others; and this to the Death. I embrace thee in all thy Offices: I renounce mine own Unworthiness, and do here avow thee to be the Lord my Righteousness: I renounce mine own Wisdom, and do here take thee for mine only Guide. I renounce mine own Will, and take thy Will for my Law.</P>
<P>And since thou hast told me that I must suffer if I will reign, I do here covenant with thee to take my Lot, as it falls, with thee: and, by thy Grace assisting, to run all Hazards with thee; verily sup∣posing that neither Life nor Death shall part be∣tween thee and me.</P>
<P>And because thou hast been pleased to give me thy Holy Laws as the Rule of my Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The least princi∣pal are the Laws, of Christ, which must be thus ob∣served.</NOTE> and the Way in which I should walk to thy Kingdom, I do here willingly put my Neck under thy Yoke, and set my Shoulder to thy Burden; and subscribing to all thy Laws, as holy, just, and
<PB N="126" REF="004663_0150_100DE0B3907B73B0"/>
good, I solemnly take them as the Rule of my Words, Thoughts and Actions, promising, that tho' my Flesh contradict and rebel, yet I will endeavour to order and govern my whole Life according to thy Direction, and will not allow my self in the Neglect of any Thing that I know to be my Duty.</P>
<P>Only because, through the Frailty of my Flesh, I am subject to many Failings, I am bold humbly to protest, that unallowed Miscarriages, contrary to the settled Bent and Resolution of my Heart, shall not make void this Covenant; for so thou hast said.</P>
<P>Now, Almighty God, Searcher of Hearts, thou knowest that I make this Covenant with thee this Day, without any known Guile or Reservation, beseeching thee, that if thou espiest any Flaw or Falshood therein, thou wouldst discover it to me, and help me to do it aright.</P>
<P>And now, Glory be to thee, O God the Father, whom I shall be bold from this Day forward, to look upon as my God and Father, that ever thou shouldst find out such a Way for the Recovery of undone Sinners. Glory be to Thee, O God the Son, who hast loved me, and washed me from my Sins, in thine own Blood, and art now become my Saviour and Redeemer. Glory be to Thee, O God the Holy Ghost, who by the Finger of thine Almighty Power, hast turned about my Heart from Sin to God.</P>
<P>O dreadful <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Lord God Omnipotent, Father, Son and Holy Ghost! Thou art now be∣come my Covenant Friend, and I, through thine infinite Grace, am become thy Covenant Servant, <HI>Amen,</HI> So be it. And the Covenant which I have made on Earth, let it be ratified in Heaven.</P>

<HEAD>The AUTHOR's Advice.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THIS Covenant I advise you to make, not only in Heart, but in Word; not only in Word, but in Writing; and that you would, with all possible Reverence, spread the Writing before the Lord, as if you would present it to him as your Act and Deed: And when you have done this, set your Hand to it; keep it as a Memorial of the solemn Transactions that have passed between God and you, that you may have Recourse to it in Doubts and Temptations.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. XI. <HI>Take Heed of delaying thy Conversion, and set upon a speedy and present Turning. I made haste and delayed not,</HI> Psal. 119.60. Remember and tremble at the sad Instance of the foolish Virgins, that came not till the Door of Mercy was shut, <HI>Matth.</HI> 21. and of a convinced <HI>Felix,</HI> that put off <HI>Paul</HI> to another Season; and we never find that he had such a Season more, <HI>Acts</HI> 94.25. Oh, come in while it is called to Day, lest thou shouldst be hardned thro' the Deceit∣fulness of Sin; left the Day of Grace should be over, and the Things that belong to thy Peace should be hid from thine Eyes. Now Mercy is wooing of thee: Now Christ is waiting to be gracious to thee, and the Spirit of God is striving with thee: Now Mini∣sters are calling; now Conscience is stirring: Now the Market is open, and Oil may be had, thou hast Opportunity for the Buying: Now Christ is to be had for the Taking. Oh! strike in with the Offers of Grace: Oh, now or never. If thou make light of this Offer, God may swear in his Wrath, thou shalt never taste of his Supper, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.24.</P>
<P>Direct. XII. <HI>Attend conscientiously upon the Word as the Means appointed for thy Conversion,</HI> James 1.18, 19. 1 Cor. 4.14. Attend, I say, not customarily, but conscienciously; with this Desire, Design, Hope and Expectation, that thou mayest be converted by it;
<PB N="128" REF="004663_0152_100DE0B6992CE688"/>
To every Sermon thou hearest, come with this Thought; <HI>Oh, I hope God will now come in; I hope this Day may be the Time, this may be the Man by whom God will bring me Home.</HI> When thou art coming to the Ordinances, lift up thy Heart thus to God: <HI>Lord, let this be the Sabbath, let this be the Season, wherein I may receive renewing Grace. Oh, let it be said, that to Day such a One was born to thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Thou wilt say, I have been long a Hearer of the Word, and yet it hath not been effectual to my Conversion? <HI>Answ.</HI> Yea, but thou hast not attended upon it in this Manner, as a Means of thy Conversion, nor with this Design, nor praying for, and expecting of this happy Effect of it.</P>
<P>Direct. XIII. <HI>Strike in with the Spirit, when he begins to work upon thy Heart.</HI> When he works Con∣victions, oh do not stifle them, but join in with him; and beg the Lord to carry on Convictions, to Conversion. Quench not the Spirit, do not out∣strive him, do not resist him. Beware of putting out Convictions by evil Company or Worldly Business. When thou findest any Troubles for Sin, and Fears about thy eternal State, beg of God, that they may never leave thee, till they have wrought off thy Heart throughly from Sin, and wrought it over to Jesus Christ. Say to him, <HI>Strike home, Lord; leave not the Work in the Midst. If thou seest that I am not yet wounded enough, that I am not troubled enough, wound me yet deeper, Lord: Oh, go to the Bottom of my Corruption, let out the Life-Blood of my Sins.</HI> Thus yield up thy self to the Workings of the Spirit, and hoist thy Sails to his Gusts.</P>
<P>Direct XIV. <HI>Set upon the constant and diligent Use of serious and fervent Prayer.</HI> He that neglects Prayer, is a profane and unsanctified Sinner, <HI>Job</HI> 15.4. He that is not constant in Prayer, is but an Hypocrite, <HI>Job</HI> 27.10. (unless the Omission be contrary to his ordinary Course, under the Force of some instant Temptation.) This is one of the Things Conversion
<PB N="129" REF="004663_0153_100DE0B9763551C0"/>
appears in, that it sets Men on praying. <HI>Acts</HI> 9.11. Therefore set to this Duty; let never a Day pass over thee, wherein thou hast not, Morning and Evening, set apart some Time for set and solemn Prayer in secret. Call thy Family also together daily and duly, to worship God with thee. Wo be unto thee, if thine be found amongst the Families that call not on God's Name, <HI>Jer</HI> 10.25. But cold and lifeless Devotions will not reach half Way to Heaven; Be fervent and importunate; Importunity will carry it, but without Violence the Kingdom of Heaven will not be taken, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.12. Thou must strive to enter, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.24. and wrestle with Tears and Supplications, as <HI>Jacob,</HI> if thou meanest to carry the Blessing, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.24. compared with <HI>Hos.</HI> 12.4. Thou art undone for ever without Grace, and therefore thou must put to it, and resolve to take no Denial. That Man that is fixed in this Resolution, <HI>Well, I must have Grace; and I will never give over till I have Grace, and I will never leave seeking and waiting, and striving with God, and mine own Heart, till he do renew me by the Power of his Grace;</HI> This Man is in the likeliest Way to win Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But God heareth not Sinners, their Prayer is an Abomination?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Distinguish between Sinners. 1. There are <HI>Resolved Sinners:</HI> Their Prayers God abhors. 2. <HI>Returning Sinners:</HI> These God will come forth to, and meet with Mercy, tho' yet affar off, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.20. Tho' the Prayers of the Unsanctified cannot have full Acceptance, yet God hath done much at the Request of such; as at <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Humiliation, and <HI>Nineveh</HI>'s Fast; 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 21.26. <HI>Jonah</HI> 3.8, 9, 10. Surely thou mayest go as far as these, tho' thou hast no Grace: And how dost thou know but thou mayest speed in thy Suit, as they did in theirs? Yea, is he not far more likely to grant thee, than them; since thou askest in the Name of Christ, and that not for temporal Blessings, as they, but for Things much more pleasing to him, <HI>viz.</HI> For <HI>Christ, Grace, Pardon,
<PB N="130" REF="004663_0154_100DE0BC9FC3C278"/>
that thou mayest be justified, sanctified, renewed and fitted to serve him?</HI> Turn to these Soul-encouraging Scriptures, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.1. to 6. <HI>Luke</HI> 11.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.34, 35.</P>
<P>Is it not good Comfort that he calleth thee? <HI>Mark</HI> 10, 49. Doth he set thee on the Use of Means, and dost thou think he will mock thee? Doubtless, he will not fail thee, if thou be not wanting to thy self. Oh, pray and faint not, <HI>Luke</HI> 18.1. A Person of great Quality having offended the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI> the King's great Favourite, being admitted into his Presence, after long waiting, prostrates him∣self at his Feet, saying, <HI>I am resolved never to rise more till I have obtained your Grace's Favour.</HI> With which Carriage he did overcome him. With such a Reso∣lution do thou throw thy self at the Feet of God: 'Tis for thy Life, and therefore follow him, and give not over: Resolve thou wilt not be put off with Bonds, with common Mercies. What tho' God do not presently open to thee? Is not Grace worth the Waiting for? Knock, and wait; and no Doubt but sooner or later Mercy will come.</P>
<P>And this know, That thou hast the very same Encouragement to seek and wait, that the Saints now in Glory once had; for they were once in thy very Case. And have they sped so well, and wilt thou not <HI>go to the same Door,</HI> and <HI>wait upon God in the same Course?</HI></P>
<P>Direct. XV. <HI>Forsake thy evil Company;</HI> Prov. 9.6. <HI>and forbear the Occasions of Sin,</HI> Prov. 23.31. Thou wilt never be turned from Sin, till thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decline and fore-go the Temptations of Sin.</P>
<P>I never expect thy Conversion from Sin, unless thou art brought to some Self-denial, as to fly the Occasions. If thou wilt be nibling at the Bait, and playing on the Brink, and tampering and meddling with the Snare, thy Soul will surely be taken. Where God doth expose Men in his Providence, unavoid∣ably to Temptations, and the Occasions are such as
<PB N="131" REF="004663_0155_100DE0BEF5765B08"/>
we cannot remove, we may expect special Assistance in the Use of his Means: But when we tempt God, by running into Danger, he will not engage to sup∣port us when we are tempted. And of all Temp∣tations, one of the most fatal and pernicious, is evil Company. Oh, what hopeful Beginnings have these often stifled. Oh, the Souls, the Estates, the Fami∣lies, the Towns, that these have ruined! How many a poor Sinner hath been enlightned, and convinced, and hath been just ready to give the Devil the Slip, and hath even escaped the Snare, and yet wicked Company have pull'd him back at last, and made him Seven fold more the Child of Hell. In one Word, I have no Hopes of thee, except thou wilt shake off thy evil Company. Christ speaketh to thee, as to them in another Case; <HI>If thou seek me, then let these go their Way,</HI> Job 18.8. Thy Life lies upon it: Forsake these, or else thou canst not live, <HI>Prov.</HI> 9.9. Will thou be worse than the Beast, to run on when thou seest the Lord with a drawn Sword in the Way? <HI>Numb.</HI> 22.23. Let this Sentence be written in Capitals upon thy Conscience, A COMPANION OF FOOLS SHALL BE DESTROYED, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.20. The Lord hath spoken it, and who shall reverse it? And wilt thou run upon Destruction, when God himself doth forewarn thee? If God do ever change thy Heart, it will appear in the Change of thy Company. Oh, fear and fly this Gulf, by which so many thousand Souls have been swallowed into Perdition. It will be hard for thee, indeed, to make thine Escape: Thy Companions will be mocking thee out of thy Religion, and will study to fill thee with Prejudices against Strictness, as ridiculous and comfortless: They will be flattering thee, and alluring thee, but remember the Warnings of the Holy Ghost, <HI>My Son, if Sinners entice thee, consent thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot. If they say, Come with us, cast in thy Lot among us; walk not thou in the Way with them, refrain thy Feet from their Path; avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away: For the Way of the
<PB N="132" REF="004663_0156_100DE0C0888A7660"/>
Wicked is as Darkness, they know not at what they stumble. They lay wait for their own Blood, they lurk privily for their own Lives,</HI> Prov. 1.10, to 18. and 4.14. to 19. My Soul is moved within me, to see how many of my Hearers are like to perish, both they and their Houses, by this wretched Mischief, even the Haunt∣ing of such Places and Company, whereby they are drawn into Sin, Once more I admonish you, as <HI>Moses</HI> did <HI>Israel,</HI> Numb. 16.26. <HI>And he spake unto the Congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the Tents of these wicked Men.</HI> Oh! flee them as you would those that had the Plague sores running in their Fore-heads. These are the Devil's Panders and Decoys; and if thou dost not make thine Escape, they will toll thee into Perdition, and will prove thine eternal Ruin.</P>
<P>Direct. XVI. <HI>Lastly. Set apart a Day to humble thy Soul in secret, by Fasting and Prayer, to work the Sense of thy Sins and Miseries upon thy Heart.</HI> Read over the <HI>Assembly</HI>'s <HI>Exposition of the Commandments,</HI> and write down the Duties omitted, and Sins committed by thee against every Commandment, and so make a Catalogue of thy Sins, and with Shame and Sorrow spread them before the Lord. And if thy Heart be willing to the Terms, join thy self solemnly to the Lord in that Covenant set down in the ninth Direc∣tion, and the Lord grant thee Mercy in his Sight.</P>
<P>Thus I have told thee, what thou must do to be saved. Wilt thou not now obey the Voice of the Lord? Wilt thou arise, and set to thy Work? O Man, what Answer wilt thou make, what Excuse wilt thou have, if thou should perish at last through very Wilfulness, when thou hadst known the Way of Life? I do not fear thy miscarrying, if thine own Idleness do not at last undo thee, in neglecting the Use of the Means that are so plainly here prescribed. Rouze up, O Sluggard, and ply thy Work: Be doing, and the Lord will be with thee.</P>

<HEAD>A short Soliloquy for an Unregenerate Sinner.</HEAD>
<P>AH Wretched Man that I am! What a Condi¦tion have I brought myself into by Sin? Oh! I see my Heart hath but deceived me all this while, in flattering me that my Condition was good. I see, I see, I am but a lost and undone Man, for ever un∣done, unless the Lord help me out of this Condition My Sins! my Sins! Lord, what an unclean, polluted Wretch am I! More loathsome and odious to thee▪ than the most hateful Venom, or noisome Carcas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can be to me. Oh! what a Hell of Sin is in this Heart of mine, which I have flattered myself to be a good Heart. Lord, how universally am I corrupted, in all my Parts, Powers, Performances! All the Imaginations of the Thoughts of my Heart are only evil continually. I am under an Inability to, Averse¦ness from, and Enmity against any Thing that is good; and am prone to all that is evil. My Heart is a very Sink of all Sin: And Oh the innumerable Hosts and Swarms of sinful Thoughts, Words and Actions, that have flown from thence! Oh the Lord of Guilt that is on my Soul! <HI>My Head is full, my Heartfull, my Mind and my Members, they are full of Sin.</HI> O my Sins! how do they stare upon me? How do they witness against me? Wo is me, my Creditors are upon me, every Commandment taketh hold upon me, for more than ten Thousand Talents, yea, ten Thousand times ten Thousand. How end∣less then is the Sum of all my Debts! If this whole World were filled up from Earth to Heaven with Paper, and all this Paper written over, within and without, by Arithmeticians; yet when all were cast up together, it would come unconceivably short of what I owe to the least of God's Commandments. Wo unto me, for my Debts are infinite, and my Sins
<PB N="134" REF="004663_0158_100DE0C575045B70"/>
are increased; they are Wrongs to an infinite Maje∣sty: And if he that committeth Treason against a silken Mortal, is worthy to be racked, drawn, and quartered; what have I deserved, that have so often lifted up my Hand against Heaven, and have struck at the Crown and Dignity of the Almighty?</P>
<P>O my Sins! my Sins! Behold, a Troop cometh! Multitudes, Multitudes! there is no Number of their Armies. Innumerable Evils have compassed me about: Mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me; they have set themselves in Array against me. Oh! it were better to have all the Regiments of Hell come against me, than to have my Sins to fall upon me, to the spoiling of my Soul. Lord, how am I surrounded? how many are they that rise up against me? They have beset me behind and before: They swarm within me, and without me: They have possessed all my Powers, and have fortified mine unhappy Soul as a Garrison, which this Brood of Hell doth man, and maintain against the God that made me.</P>
<P>And they are as mighty, as they are many: The Sands are many, but then they are not great: The Mountains great, but then they are not many: But wo is me! my Sins are as many as the Sands, and as mighty as the Mountains; their Weight is greater than their Number. It were better that the Rocks and the Mountains should fall upon me, than the crushing and insupportable Load of my own Sins. Lord, I am heavy loaden; let Mercy help, or I am gone. Unload me of this heavy Guilt, this sinking Load, or I am crushed without Hope, and must be pressed down to Hell. If my Grief were thorowly weighed, and all my Sins laid in the Ballances to∣gether, they would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea; therefore my Words are swallowed up; the would weigh down all the Rocks, and the Hills, and turn the Ballance against all the Isles of the Earth O Lord, thou knowest my manifold Transgressions and my mighty Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="004663_0159_100DE0C8F6F55600"/>Ah, my Soul! Alas, my Glory! Whither art thou humbled? Once the Glory of the Creation, and the Image of God; now a Lump of Filthiness, a Coffin of Rottenness, replenished with Stench and Loathsomness. Oh, what Work hath Sin made with thee! Thou shalt be termed <HI>Forsaken,</HI> and all the Rooms of thy Faculties <HI>Desolate,</HI> and the Name that thou shalt be called by, it is <HI>Ichabod,</HI> or, <HI>Where is the Glory?</HI> How art thou come down mightily? My Beauty is turned into Deformity, and my Glory into Shame. Lord, what a loathsome Leper am I? The ulcerous Bodies of <HI>Job</HI> or <HI>Lazarus</HI> were not more offensive to the Eyes and Nostrils of Men, than I must needs be to the most Holy God, whose Eyes cannot behold Iniquity.</P>
<P>And what Misery have my Sins brought on me? Lord, what a Case am I in! Sold under Sin, cast out of God's Favour, accursed from the Lord, cursed in my Body, cursed in my Soul, cursed in my Name, my Estate, my Relations, and all that I have. My Sins are unpardoned, and my Soul within a Step of Death. Alas! what shall I do? Whither shall I go? Which Way shall I look? God is frowning on me from above; Hell gaping for me beneath; Conscience smiting me within; Temptations and Dangers surrounding me without. Oh, whither shall I flee? What Place can hide me from Omnisciency? What Power can secure me from Omnipotency?</P>
<P>What meanest thou, O my Soul, to go on thus? Art thou in League with Hell? Hast thou made a Covenant with Death? Art thou in Love with thy Misery? Is it good for thee to be here? Alas! what shall I do? Shall I go on in my sinful Ways? Why then certain Damnation will be mine End. And shall I be so besotted and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dded, as to go and sell my Soul to the Flames for a little Ale, and a little Ease; for a little Pleasure, or Gain, or Con∣tent to my Flesh? Shall I linger any longer in this wretched Estate? No, if I tarry here, I shall die.
<PB N="136" REF="004663_0160_100DE0CA94E6A1B8"/>
What then? Is there no Help, no Hope? None, except I turn. Why, but is there any Remedy for such woful Misery? Any Mercy after such provok∣ing Iniquity? Yes, as sure as God's Oath is true, I shall have Pardon and Mercy yet, if presently, un∣feignedly and unreservedly I turn by Christ to him.</P>
<P>Why then I thank thee upon the bended Knees of my Soul, O most merciful <HI>Jehovah,</HI> that thy Patience hath waited upon me hitherto: For hadst thou took me away in this Estate, I had perished for ever. And now I adore thy Grace, and accept the Offers of thy Mercy: I renounce all my Sins, and resolve, by thy Grace, to set myself against them, and to follow thee, in Holiness and Righ∣teousness, all the Days of my Life.</P>
<P>Who am I, Lord, that I should make any Claim unto thee, or have any Part or Pottion in thee, who am not worthy to lick up the Dust of thy Feet? Yet since thou holdest forth the golden Scepter, I am bold to come and touch. To despair, would be to desparage thy Mercy; and to stand off when thou biddest me come, would be at once to undo myself, and rebel against thee, under the Pretence of Humi∣lity. Therefore I bow my Soul to thee, and with all possible Thankfulness accept thee as mine, and give up myself to thee as thine. Thou shalt be Sovereign over me, my King, and my God: Thou shalt be in the Throne, and all my Powers shall bow to thee, they shall come and worship before thy Feet: Thou shalt be my Portion, O Lord, and I will rest in thee.</P>
<P>Thou callest for my Heart: O that it were any Way fit for thine Acceptance! I am unworthy, O Lord, everlastingly unworthy to be thine: But since thou wilt have it so, I freely give up my Heart to thee; take it, it is thine: Oh that it were better. But, Lord, I put it into thine Hand, who alone canst mend it: Mould it after thine own Heart; make it as thou wouldst have it, holy, humble, heavenly, soft, tender, flexible; and write thy Law upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="004663_0161_100DE0CEF9E03D08"/>Come, Lord Jesus; come quickly; enter in tri∣umphantly: Take me up to thee for ever. I give up to thee, I come to thee, as the only Way to the Father, as the only Mediator, the Means ordained to bring me to God. I have destroyed myself, but in thee is my Help: Save, Lord, or else I perish: I come to thee with the Rope about my Neck; I am worthy to die, and to be damned. Never was the Hire more due to the Servant, never was the Penny more due to the Labourer, than Death and Hell, my just Wages, is due to me for my Sins: But I fly to thy Merits, I trust alone to the Value and Vertue of thy Sacrifice, and Prevalency of thy Intercession: I submit to thy Teaching, I make choice of thy Government. Stand open, ye everlasting Doors, that the King of Glory may come in.</P>
<P>O Thou Spirit of the Most High, the Comforter and Sanctifier of thy chosen; come in with all thy glorious Train, all thy courtly Attendants, thy Fruits, and Graces. Let me be thine Inhabitation. I can give thee but what is thine own already; but here with the poor Widow, I cast my two Mites, my Soul and my Body, into thy Treasury; fully resigning them up to thee, to be sanctified by thee, to be Servants to thee. They shall be thy Patients, cure thou their Malady; they shall be thy Agents, govern thou their Motions. Too long have I served the World, too long have I hearkned to Satan; but now I renounce them all, and will be ruled by thy Dictates and Directions, and guided by thy Counsel.</P>
<P>O Blessed Trinity! O glorious Unity! I deliver up myself to thee, receive me; write thy Name, O Lord, upon me, and upon all that I have, as thy proper Goods: Set thy Mark upon me, upon every Member of my Body, and every Faculty of my Soul. I have chosen thy Precepts, thy Law will I lay before me: This shall be the Copy which I will keep in my Eye, and study to write after. Accord∣ing to this Rule do I resolve, by thy Grace, to walk; after this Law shall my whole Man be governed;
<PB N="138" REF="004663_0162_100DE0D2B5888760"/>
and tho' I cannot perfectly keep one of thy Com∣mandments, yet I will allow myself in the Breach of none. I know my Flesh will hang back, but I resolve, in the Power of thy Grace, to cleave to thee, and thy holy Ways, whatever it cost me. I am sure I cannot come off a Loser by thee, therefore I will be content with Reproach, and Difficulties, and Hardships here; and will deny myself, and take up my Cross, and follow thee. Lord Jesus, thy Yoke is easy, and thy Cross is welcome, as it is the Way to thee. I lay aside all Hopes of worldly Happiness, I will be content to tarry till I come to thee: Let me be poor and low, little and despised here, so I may be but admitted to live and reign with thee hereafter. Lord, thou hast my Heart and Hand to this Agree∣ment: Be it as the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> never to be reversed: To this I will stand, in this Resolution, by Grace, I will live and die. I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments; I have given my free Consent, I have made my everlasting Choice: Lord Jesus confirm the Contract, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Chap. VIII.</HI> Containing the Motives to Conversion.</HEAD>
<P>THO' what is already said of the Necessity of Conversion, and of the Miseries of the Un∣converted, might be sufficient to induce any consi∣dering Mind to resolve upon a present Turning, or Conversion unto God; yet knowing what a Piece of desperate Obstinacy and Untractableness the Heart of Man naturally is, I have thought it necessary to add to the Means of Conversion, and Directions for a Covenant closure with God in Christ, some Motives to persuade you hereunto</P>
<P><Q>O Lord, fail me not now, at my last Attempts. If any Soul have read hitherto, and be yet un∣touched, now, Lord, fasten in him, and do thy Work. Now take him by the Heart, overcome

him, perswade him, till he say, Thou hast pre∣vailed, for thou wert stronger than I. Lord, didst thou not make me a Fisher of Men? And have I toiled all this while, and caught nothing? Alas, that I should have spent my Strength for nought! And now I am casting my last; Lord Jesus, stand thou upon the Shore, and direct how and where I shall spread my Net; and let me so inclose with Arguments the Souls I seek for, that that may not be able to get out.</Q> Now, Lord, for a Multitude of Souls! Now for a full Draught! O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me this once, O God.</P>
<P>But I turn unto you.</P>
<P>Men and Brethren, Heaven and Earth doth call upon you; yea, Hell itself doth preach the Doctrine of Repentance unto you: the Angels of the Churches travail with you, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. the Angels of Heaven wait for you, for your repenting, and turning unto God. O Sinner, why should the Devil make merry with thee? Why should thou be a Morsel for that devouring <HI>Leviathan?</HI> Why should Harpies and Hell∣hounds tear thee, and make a Feast upon thee; and when they have got thee into the Snare, and have lastned their Talons in thee, laugh at thy Destruction, and deride thy Misery, and sport themselves with thy damnable Folly? This must be thy Case, except thou turn. And were it not better thou shouldst be a Joy to Angels, than a Laughing-stock and Sport for Devils? Verily, if thou wouldst but come in, the heavenly Host would take up their Anthems, and sing, <HI>Glory be to God in the Highest;</HI> the Morning-Stars would sing together, and all the Sons of God shout for Joy, and celebrate this new Creation as they did the first. Thy Repentance would, as it were, make Holy-day in Heaven, and the glorious Spirits would rejoice in that there was a new Brother added to their Society, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.9. another Heir born to their Lord, and the lost Son received safe and sound.
<PB N="140" REF="004663_0164_100DE0D5EECFA480"/>
The true Penitent's Tears, are indeed the Wine that cheareth both God and Man.</P>
<P>If it be little, that Men and Angels would rejoice at thy Conversion, know that God himself would rejoice over thee, even with singing, and rest in his Love, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.9. <HI>Isa.</HI> 62.5. Never did <HI>Jacob</HI> with such Joy weep over the Neck of his <HI>Joseph,</HI> as thy heavenly Father would rejoice over thee, upon thy coming in to him. Look over the Story of the Prodigal; methinks I see how the aged Father lays aside his Estate, and forgets his Years. Behold how he runneth, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.20. Oh the Haste that Mercy makes! the Sinner makes not half that Speed. Methinks I see how his Bowels turn, how his Compassions yearn. (How quick-sighted is Love!) Mercy spies him a great Way off, forgets his riotous Courses, unnatural Rebellion, horrid Unthankfulness, debauched Practice (not a Word of these) but receives him with open Arms, clasps about his Neck, forgets the Nastiness of his Rags, kisseth the Lips that deserve to be loathed, the Lips that had been joined to Harlots, that had been Commoners with the Swine; calls for the fatted Calf, the best Robe, the Ring, the Shoes, the best Chear in Heaven's Store, the best Attire in Heaven's Wardrobe, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.6, 9, 23. Yea, the Joy cannot be held in one Breast, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> others must be called to participate; the Friends must meet, and make merry: Angels must wait, but the Prodigal must be set at the Table, under his Father's Wing: He is the Joy of the Feast; he is the sweet Subject of the Father's Delight: The Friends sympathize, but none knows the Felicity the Father takes in his new-born Son, whom he hath received from the Dead. Methinks I hear the Musick and the Dancing at a Distance. Oh the Melody of the heavenly Choristers! I cannot learn the Song, <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.3. but methinks I over-hear the Burden, at which all the Harmonious Quire with one Consent strike sweetly in; for thus goes the Round at Heaven's Table, <HI>For this my Son was dead, and
<PB N="141" REF="004663_0165_100DE0D88498E528"/>
is alive again, was lost, and is found,</HI> Luke 15.23, 24, 32. I need further explain the Parable; God is the Father, Christ is the Chear, his Righteousness the Robe, his Graces the Ornaments, Ministers, Saints, Angels, the Friends and Servants, and thou that readest (if thou wilt but unfeignedly repent and turn) the welcome Prodigal, the happy Instance of this Grace, and blessed Subject of this Joy and Love.</P>
<P>O Rock! O Adamant! What! Not moved yet? Nor yet resolved to turn forthwith, and to close with Mercy; I will try thee yet once again: If one were sent to thee from the Dead, wouldst thou be perswaded? Why, hear the Voice from the Dead, from the Damned, crying to thee that thou shouldst repent. <HI>I pray thee, that thou wouldst send him to my Father's House; for I have five Brethren, that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this Place of Torment. If one went unto them from the Dead, they will repent,</HI> Luke 16.27, 28, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hear, O Man! thy Predecessors in Impenitence preach to thee from the infernal Gibbets, from the Flames, from the Rack, that thou shouldst repent. Oh, look down in the Bottomless pit: Seest thou how the Smoke of their Torment ascendeth for ever and ever? <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.11. How black are the Fiends? How furious are their Torments! 'Tis their only Musick to hear how their miserable Patients roar, to hear their Bones crack: 'Tis their Meat and Drink to see how their Flesh frieth, and their Fat droppeth; to drench them with burning Metal, and to rip open their Bodies, and to pour in the fierce burning Brass into their Bowels, and the Recesses and Ventricles of their Hearts. What thinkest thou of those Chains of Darkness, of those Instruments of Cruelty? Canst thou be content to burn? Seest thou how the Worm gnaweth, how the Oven gloweth, how the Fire rageth? What sayest thou to that River of Brimstone, that dark and horrible Vault, that Gulf of Perdition? Wilt thou take up thy Habitation here? Oh, lay

How do they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oar and yell, and gnash their Teeth? How deep are their Groans? How feeling are their Moans? How unconceivable are their Miseries? If the Shrieks of <HI>Corah, Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> were so terrible (when the Earth clave asunder, and opened her Mouth, and swallowed them up, and all that apper∣tained to them) that all <HI>Israel</HI> fled at the Cry of them, <HI>Numb.</HI> 19.33, 34. Oh, how fearful would the Cry be, if God should take off the Covering from the Mouth of Hell, and let the Cry of the Damned ascend in all its Terror amongst the Children of Men? And of all their Moans and Miseries, this is the piercing, killing Emphasis and Burden, <HI>For ever, for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Why, as God liveth, that made thy Soul, thou art but a few Hours distant from all this, except thou repent, and be converted.</P>
<P>Oh! I am even lost and swallowed up in the Abundance of these Arguments that I might suggest: If there be any Point of Wisdom in all the World, it is to repent, and come in; if there be any Thing righteous, any Thing reasonable, that is it: If there be any Thing in the World that may be called Mad∣ness and Folly, and any Thing that may be counted sottish, absurd, brutish, unreasonable, it is this, to go on in thine unconverted Estate. Let me beg of thee, as thou wouldst not wilfully destroy thy self, to sit down and weigh, besides what hath been said, these following Motives, and let Conscience speak, if it be not Reason that thou shouldst repent and turn.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The God that made thee doth most graciously invite thee.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His most sweet and merciful Nature doth in∣vite thee. O the Kindness of God, his working Bowels, his tender Mercies! They are infinitely above our Thoughts: <HI>Higher than Heaven, what can

This is a great Argument to persuade Sinners to come in, <Q>Turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to Anger, and of great Kindness, and repenteth him of the Evil.</Q> If God would not repent him of the Evil, it were some Discourage∣ment to us, why we should not repent. If there were no Hope of Mercy, it were no such Wonder if Rebels should stand out; But never had Subject such a gracious Prince, such Piety, Patience, Clemency, Pity, to deal with, as you have. <HI>Who is a God like unto him that pardoneth Iniquity,</HI> &amp;c. Micah 7.18. O Sinners, see what a God you have to deal with! If you will but turn, <Q>He will turn again, and will have Compassion on you; He will subdue your Iniquities, and cast all your Sins into the Depth of the Sea, <HI>Verse</HI> 19.

Art thou willing to come in? Why the Lord hath laid aside his Terror, erected a Throne of Grace, holds forth the Golden Scepter: Touch, and live. Would a merciful Man slay his Enemy, when prostrate at his Feet, acknow∣ledging his Wrong, begging Pardon, and offering to enter with him into a Covenant of Peace? Much less will the merciful God.

How passionately it wooeth thee: <Q>Return, thou back-sliding <HI>Israel,</HI> saith the Lord, and I will not cause mine Anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep Anger for ever: Only acknowledge thine Iniquity. Turn, O back-sliding Children, saith the Lord, for I am married unto you: Return, and I will heal your Back-slidings. Thou hast play'd with many Lovers, yet return unto me, saith the Lord, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3 11, 12, 13, 14, 22. As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked, but that he turn from his Way, and live: Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil Ways; for why will ye die, O House of <HI>Israel?</HI> Ezek. 33.11. If the Wicked will turn from all his Sins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his Transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: In his Righteousness that he hath done, shall he live. Repent and turn yourselves from all your Transgressions, so Iniquity shall not be your Ruin. Cast away from you all your Transgressions, and make you a clean Heart, and a new Spirit; for why will ye die, O House of <HI>Israel?</HI> For I have no Pleasure in the Death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.21, 23, 30, 31, 32.</Q></P>
<P>O melting, gracious Words! The Voice of a God, and not of a Man! This is not the Manner of Men, for the offended Sovereign to sue the offending, traitorous Varlet. Oh, how doth Mercy follow thee, and plead with thee! Is not thy Heart broken yet? Oh, that to Day you would hear his Voice!</P>

Word, He will be a God to you, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.7. And what can be said more? What may you expect that a God should do for you, and be to you, that he will not be, and will not do? She that marries a Prince, expects he should do for her like a Prince, that she may live in a suitable State, and have an answerable Dowry. He that hath a King for his Father, or Friend, expects he should do for him like a King. Alas! the Kings and Monarchs of the Earth, so much above you, are but like the painted Butter-flies amongst the rest of their Kind, or the fair-coloured Palmer-Worm amongst the rest of the Worms, if compared with God. As he doth infinitely exceed the Glory and Power of his glitter∣ing Dust, so he will, beyond all Proportion, exceed in doing for his Favourites, whatever Princes can do for theirs. He will give you Grace and Glory, and withhold no good Thing from you, <HI>Psalm</HI> 84.11. He will take you for his Sons and Daughters, and make you Heirs of his Promises, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.17. and establish his Everlasting Covenant with you, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40. He will justify you from all that Law, Conscience, Satan, can charge upon you, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.33, 34. He will give you free Access into his Presence, and accept your Person, and receive your Prayers, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.12: and 1.6. 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.14. He will abide in you, and make you the Men of his Secrets, and hold a constant and friendly Commu∣nion with you, <HI>John</HI> 14.23. and 15.15. 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.3. His Ear shall be open, his Door open, his Store open at all Times to you. His Blessing shall rest upon you, and he will make your Enemies to serve you, and work about all Things for good unto you, <HI>Psalm</HI> 115.13. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Terms of Mercy are brought as low as possible to you.</HI> God hath stooped as low to Sinners, as with Honour he can. He will not be thought a Fauto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Sin, nor strain the Glory of his Holiness: And whither could he come lower than he hath, unles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he should do this?

He doth not impose any Thing unreasonable or impossible, as a Condition of Life upon you. Two Things were necessary to be done, according to the Tenour of the first Covenant, by you: 1. <HI>That you should fully satisfy the Demands of Justice for past Offences.</HI> 2. <HI>That you should perform personally, perfectly and perpetually the whole Law for the Time to come.</HI> Both these are to us impossible, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.3. But behold God's gracious Abatement in both: He doth not stand upon Satisfaction, he is content to take of the Surety (and he of his own providing too) what he might have exacted from you, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. He declares himself to have received a Ransom, <HI>Job</HI> 33.24. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.6. and that he expects nothing but that you should accept his Son, and he shall be Righ∣teousness and Redemption to you, <HI>John</HI> 1.12. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. And for the future Obedience, here he is content to yield to your Weakness, and omit the Rigour. He doth not stand upon Perfection (as a Condition of Life, tho' he still insists upon it as due) but is content to accept of Sincerity, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.20. Tho' you cannot pay the full Debt, he will accept you according to that which you have, and take willing for doing, and the Purpose for the Performance, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.12. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.8. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.17. And if you come in his Christ, and set your Hearts to please him, and make it the Chief of your Cares, he will approve and reward you, tho' the Vessel be marred in your Hands.</P>
<P>Oh, consider your Maker's Condescension. Let me say to you, as <HI>Naaman</HI>'s Servant to him, <HI>My Father, if the Prophet had bid thee do some great Thing, wouldst thou not have done it? How much rather when he saith unto thee, wash and he clean?</HI> 2 Kings 5 13. If God had demanded some terrible, some severe and rigorous Thing of you, to escape eternal Damnation, would you not have done it? Suppose

it had been to spend all your Days in Sorrow in some howling Wilderness, or pine your selves with Famine, or to offer the Fruit of your Bodies for the Sin of your Souls, would you not have thank∣fully accepted Eternal Redemption, tho' these had been the Conditions? Yea, further, if God should have told you, you should have fried in the Fire for Millions of Ages, or been so long tormented in Hell, would you not have gladly accepted it? Alas! all these are not so much as one Sand in the Glass of Eternity. If your offended Creator should have had you but one Year upon the Rack, and then bid you come and forsake your Sins, accept of Christ, and serve him a few Years in Self-denial, or lie in this Case for ever and ever: Do you think you should have stuck at the Offer, and disputed the Terms, and have been unresolved whether you were best to accept of the Motion? O Sinner, return and live: Why shouldst thou die, when Life is to be had for the Taking, and Mercy should be beholding to thee (as it were) to be saved? Couldst thou say indeed, <HI>Lord, I knew that thou wast an hard Man,</HI> Matth. 25.24. thou hadst some little Excuse: But when the God of Heaven had stooped so low, and bated so far, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now thou shouldst stand off, who shall plead fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thee?</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>Wherein you are impotent, God doth offer Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to enable you. I have stretched out my Hand, and no Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> regarded,</HI> Prov. 1.24. What tho' you are plunge

into the Ditch of that Misery, from which you can never get out? Christ offereth to help you out: He stretcheth his Hand to you, and if you perish, it is for refusing his Help. <HI>Behold, I stand at the Door, and knock: If any Man open to me, I will come in,</HI> Rev. 3.20. What tho' you are poor, and wretched, and blind, and naked, Christ offereth a Cure for your Blindness, a Cover for your Naked∣ness, a Remedy for your Poverty, he tendereth you his Righteousness, his Graces: <HI>I counsel thee to buy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me Gold, that thou mayest be rich; and white Raiment, that thou mayest be cloathed; and anoint thine Eyes with Eye-salve that thou mayest see,</HI> Rev. 3.17.18. Do you say, The Condition is impossible, for I have not wherewith to buy? You must know, that this buying is without Money, and without Price, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. this buying is by begging, and seeking with Diligence and Constancy in the Use of God's Means, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.3, 4. God commandeth thee to know him, and to fear him. Dost thou say, Yea, but my Mind is blinded, and my Heart is hardned from this Fear? I answer, God doth offer to enlighten thy Mind, and to teach thee his Fear, that is presented to thy Choice, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.29. <HI>For that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey hated Knowledge, and did not chuse the Fear of the Lord.</HI> So that now, if Men live in Ignorance and Estrangement from the Lord, it is because <HI>they will not understand, and desire not the Knowledge of his Ways,</HI> Job 21.14. <HI>If thou criest after Knowledge, if thou seekest her as Silver,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Then shalt thou understand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God,</HI> Prov. 2.3, 4, 5. Is not here a fair Offer? <HI>Turn you at my Reproof: Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you,</HI> Prov. 1.23. Tho' of your selves you cannot do nothing, yet you may do all through his Spirit enabling you; and he doth offer Assistance to you. God bids you <HI>wash, and make you clean,</HI> Isa. 1.16. You say, you are unable, as much as the Leopard to wash out his Spots, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.23. Yea, but the Lord doth offer to purge you; so that if you be

O Jerusalem, <HI>wilt thou not be made clean, when shall it once be?</HI> God doth wait when you will be made clean, when you will yield to his Motions, and accept of his Offers, and let him do for and in you, what you cannot do for your selves. You do not know how much God will do upon your Impor∣tunity, if you will be restless, and instant with him, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.8. and 18.5.</P>
<P>If God hath not bound himself by express Pro∣mise to wicked Men, to give them Grace in the diligent Use of the Means, yet he hath given then abundant Encouragement to expect it from him, if they seek it earnestly in his Way. His mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gracious Nature is abundant Encouragement. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a rich and most bountiful Man should see thee in Misery, and bid thee come to his Door; wouldst thou not, with Confidence, expect, at thy coming, to find some Relief? Thou art not able to believe, nor repent; God appoints thee to use such and such Means in order to thy obtaining Faith and Repentance: Doth not this argue that God will bestow these upon thee, if thou dost ply him diligently in Prayer, Meditation, Reading, Hearing, Self-Examination, and the rest of his Means▪ Otherwise God should but mock his poor Creatures, to put them upon these Self-denying Endeavours and then, when they have put hard to it, and continued waiting upon him for Grace, deny them at last. Surely if a sweet natured Man would not deal thus, much less will the most merciful and gracious God.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclusion of the Whole.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, my Brethren, let me know your Minds: What do you intend to do? Will you go on and die? or will you set upon a thorough and speedy Conversion, and lay hold on Eternal Life? How long will you linger in <HI>Sodom?</HI> How long will you halt between two Opinions? 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.21. Are you not yet resolved whether Christ o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Barab∣bas,</HI> whether bliss or torment, whether the Land of <HI>Cabul,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 9.13. or the Paradise of God, be the better choice? Is it a disputable Case, whether the <HI>Abana</HI> and <HI>Parphar</HI> of <HI>Damascus,</HI> be better than all the Streams of <HI>Eden?</HI> or whether the vile puddle of Sin be to be preferred before the Water of Life, clear as Crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb? Can the World in good earnest, do that for you, that Christ can? Will it stand by you to Eternity? Will Pleasures, Titles, Lands, Trea∣sures, descend with you? <HI>Psa.</HI> 49.17. 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 6.7. If not, had you not need look after somewhat that will? What mean you to stand wavering, to be off and on? Foolish Children! how long will you stick between the womb and the world? Shall I leave you at last no farther than <HI>Agrippa,</HI> but almost persuad∣ed? Why, you are forever lost, if left here: As good not at all, as not altogether Christians. You are half of the mind to give over your former ne∣gligent Life, and to set a strict and holy course; you could wish you were as some others be, and could do as they can do: How long will you rest in idle Wishes, and fruitless Purposes? When will you come to a fixed, full and firm Resolve? Do not you see how Satan gulls you, by tempting you to De∣lays? How long hath he toll'd you on the Way of Perdition? How many Years have you been pur∣posing to amend? What if God should have taken you off this while?</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="004663_0178_100DE0FC896E3EE0"/>Well, put me not off with a dilatory Answer: Tell me not of hereafter, I must have your present Consent. If you be not now resolved, while the Lord is treating with you, and wooing of you, much less are you like to be hereafter, when these Impressions are worn out, and you are hardned through the Deceitfulness of Sin. Will you give me your Hands? Will you set open the Doors, and give the Lord Jesus the full and present Possession? Will you put your Names into his Covenant? Will you subscribe? What do you resolve upon? If you are still upon your Delays, my labour is lost, and all is like to come to nothing. Fain I would, that you should now put in your adventures: Come cast in your Lot, make your choice: <HI>Now is the accepted Time, now is the Day of thy Salvation: To Day if you will hear his Voice.</HI> Why should not this be the Day from whence thou shouldst be able to date thine Happiness? Why shouldst thou venture a day longer in this dangerous and dreadful condition? What if God should this Night require thy Soul? <HI>Oh that thou mightest know in this thy day the things that be∣long unto thy peace, before they be hid from thine eyes,</HI> Luke 19.42. This is the day, and it is but the day, <HI>John</HI> 9.4. Others have had their day, and have re∣ceived their doom; and now art thou brought upon the stage of this World, here to act thy part for the whole Eternity. Remember thou art now upon thy good Behaviour for everlasting; if thou make not a wise Choice now, thou art undone forever. Look what thy present choice is, such must thine Eter∣nal Condition be, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.24. and 16.25. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.27, 28, 29.</P>
<P>And is it true indeed? Is Life and Death at thy choice? Yea, it is as true as Truth is, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.19. Why then, what hinders but that thou shouldst be happy? Nothing doth or can hinder, but thine own wilful neglect, or refusal. It was the passage of the <HI>Eunuch</HI> to <HI>Philip, See, here is Water: What doth hin∣der me to be baptized?</HI> So I may say to thee, See, here
<PB N="155" REF="004663_0179_100DE0FF20C67120"/>
is Christ, here is Mercy, Pardon, Life: What hin∣ders, but that thou shouldst be pardoned and saved? One of the Martyrs, as he was praying at the stake, had his Pardon set by in a Box, which indeed he refused deservedly, because upon unworthy terms: But here the terms are most honourable and easy. O Sinner! wilt thou burn with thy Pardon by thee? Why, do but forthwith give up thy Consent to Christ, to renounce thy Sins, deny thyself, take up the Yoke, and the Cross, and thou carriest the Day, Christ is thine, Pardon, Peace, Life, Blessedness, all are thine: And is not this an offer worth em∣bracing? Why shouldst thou hesitate, or doubtfully dispute about the Case? Is it not past controversy, whether God be better <HI>than Sin, and Glory better</HI> than Vanity? Why shouldst thou forsake thine own mer∣cy, and sin against thine own Life? When wilt thou shake off thy Sloth, and lay by thine Excuses? <HI>Boast not thyself of to Morrow,</HI> thou knowest not where this Night may lodge thee, <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.1.</P>
<P>Beloved, now the holy Spirit is striving wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>you:</HI> He will not always strive. Hast thou not felt thy Heart warmed by the Word, and been almost per∣suaded to leave off thy Sins, and come into God? Hast thou not felt some good motions in thy mind, wherein thou hast been warned of thy Danger, and told what thy careless Course would end in? It may be thou art like young <HI>Samuel,</HI> who when the Lord called once and again, he knew not the Voice of the Lord, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.6, 7. But these Motions and <HI>Items</HI> are the offers, essays, calls and strivings of the Spirit: Oh, take the Advantage of the Tide, and know the Day of thy Visitation.</P>
<P>Now the Lord Jesus stretcheth wide his Arms to receive you; he beseecheth you by us. How mov∣ingly, how meltingly, how pitifully, how passionate∣ly he calleth! The Church is put into a sudden ex∣tasy upon the sound of his Voice, <HI>The Voice of my Be∣loved,</HI> Cant. 2.8. Oh, wilt thou turn a deaf Ear to his Voice? It is not the Voice that breaketh the Ce∣dars,
<PB N="156" REF="004663_0180_100DE100AFF3E100"/>
and maketh the Mountains to skip like a Calf; that shaketh the Wilderness, and divideth the Flames of Fire: It is not <HI>Sinai</HI>'s Thunder, but the soft and still voice. It is not the voice of Mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> a voice of cursing and terror, but the Voice of Mount <HI>Ge∣riz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> the Voice of Blessing and of glad Tidings of good Things.

<P>Behold, O ye Sons of Men, the Lord Jesus hath thrown open the Prisons, and now he cometh to you (as the Magistrates once to them, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.39.) and beseecheth you to come out. If it were from a Palace, or a Paradise, that Christ did call you, it

were no wonder if you were unwilling: (and yet, how easily was <HI>Adam</HI> tolled from thence!) but it is from your Prison, Sirs, from your Chains, from the Dungeon, from the Darkness that he calleth you, <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.6, 7. and yet will you not come? He calleth you unto Liberty, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.13. and yet will you not hearken? His Yoke is easy, his Laws are liberty, his Service Freedom, <HI>Matt.</HI> 11 30. <HI>James.</HI> 1.25. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.22. and (whatever Prejudices you have against his Ways) if a God may be believed, you shall find them all Pleasure and Peace, and shall taste Sweetness and Joy unutterable, and take infinite Delight and Felicity in them, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.161. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 118. <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.103, 111.</P>
<P>Beloved, I am loth to leave you: I cannot tell how to give you over: I am now ready to shut up, but fain I would drive this Bargain between Christ and you, before I end. What! shall I leave you as I found you at last? Have you read hitherto, and are not yet resolved upon a present Abandoning all your Sins, and closing with Jesus Christ! Alas, what shall I say, What shall I do! Will you turn off all my Importunity! Have I run in vain! Have I used so many Arguments, and spent so much time to per∣suade you, and yet must sit down at last in Disap∣pointment? But is it a small Matter that you turn me off? You put a Slight upon the <HI>God</HI> that made you; you reject the Bowels and Beseechings of a <HI>Sa∣viour,</HI> and <HI>will he sound Resisters of the Holy Ghost, Acts</HI> 7.41. if you will not now be prevailed with to repent and be <HI>converted.</HI></P>

Why should the passionate Pleadings and Woo∣ing of Mercy be turned into the horrid Aggravations of your Obstinacy, and Additions to your Misery?

would not continue and increase the Pains of your travailing Ministers, do not stick in the Birth. If the God that made you have any Authority with you, obey his Command and come in. If you are not the Despisers of Grace, and would not shut up the Doors of Mercy against yourselves, repent and be conver∣ted. Let not Heaven stand open for you in vain: Let not the Lord Jesus open his Wares, and bid you buy without Money, and without Price, in vain: Let not his Ministers, and his Spirit strive with you in vain, and leave you now at last unpersuaded, lest the Sentence go forth against you, <HI>The Bel∣lows are burnt, the Lead is consumed of the Fire, the Founder melteth in vain. Reprobate Silver shall Men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them,</HI> Jer. 6.29, 30.</P>
<P>Father of Spirits, take the Heart in Hand that is too hard for my Weakness: Do not thou have ended tho' I have done; half a Word from thine effectual Power, will do the Work. O thou that hast the Key of <HI>David,</HI> that openest when no Man shutteth: Open thou his Heart, as thou didst <HI>Lydia</HI>'s and let the King of Glory enter in, and make this Soul thy Captive. Let not the Tempter harden him in Delays: Let him not stir from this Place, nor take his Eyes from these Lines, till he be resolved to forgo his Sins, and to accept of Life upon thy self-denying Terms: In thy Name, O Lord God, did I go forth to these La∣bours: In thy Name do I shut them up: Let not all the Time they have cost, be but lost Hours: Let not all the Thoughts of Heart, and all the Pains that hath been about them, be but lost La∣bour. Lord, put thine Hand into the Heart of this Reader, and send thy Spirit, as once thou didst <HI>Philip,</HI> to join himself to the Chariot of the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> while he was reading the Word: And tho' I should never know it it while I live, yet I beseech thee, Lord God, let it be found at the last Day, that some Souls are converted by these Labours: And let some be able to stand forth, and say, That by these

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Allein</HI>'s Counsel for Personal and Family Godliness.</HEAD>
<P>BEloved, I despair of ever bringing you to Sal∣vation, without Sanctification; or possessing you of Happiness, without persuading you to Ho∣liness. God knows, I have not the least Hope ever to see one of your Faces in Heaven, except you be converted and sanctified, and exercise yourselves unto Godliness. I beseech you, study Personal-God∣liness, and Family-Godliness.</P>
<P N="1">1. Personal-Godliness. Let it be your first Care to set up Christ in your Hearts: See that you make all your worldly Interests to stoop to him, that you be intirely and unreservedly devoted unto him. If you wilfully, and deliberately, and ordinarily harbour any Sin, you are undone, <HI>Psa.</HI> 68.21. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.20. See that you unfeignedly take the Law of Christ as the Rule of your Words, Thoughts and Actions; and subject you▪ whole Man, Mem∣bers and Mind faithfully to him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.34. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.13. If you have not a due Respect to all God's Commandments, you are unsound at Heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119 6. Oh, study to get the Image and Im∣press of Christ upon you within. Begin with your Hearts, else you would build without Foundation. Labour to get a saving Change within, or else all external Performances will be to no Purpose: And then study to shew forth the Power of Godliness in the Life. Let Piety be your first and great Bu∣siness: 'Tis the highest Point of Justice to give God his due. Beware that none of you be a prayerless Person; for that is a most certain Discovery of a Christless and a Graceless Person; if one that is a very Stranger to the Fear of God, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 14.4. <HI>Job.</HI> 15.4. Suffer not your Bibles to gather Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="163" REF="004663_0187_100DE113662D8388"/>
see that you converse daily with the Word, <HI>John</HI> 5.39. That Man can never lay claim to Blessedness, whose delight is not in the Law of the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1.1, 2. Let Meditation and Self-Examination be your daily Exercise.</P>
<P>But Piety, without Charity, is but the Half of Christianity, or rather impious Hypocrisy. We may not divide the <HI>Tables:</HI> See therefore that you do justly and love Mercy, and let Equity and Charity run like an even Thread, throughout all your Dealings. Be you temperate in all things, and let Chastity and Sobriety be your undivided Companions. Let Truth and Purity, Seriousness and Modesty, Heaviness and Gravity, be the con∣stant Ornaments of your Speech. Let Patience and Humility, Simplicity and Sincerity shine out in all the Parts of your Conversations. See that you for∣get and forgive Wrongs, and requite them with Kindness, as you would be found the Children of the Most High. Be merciful in your Censures, and put the most favourable Construction upon your Bre∣thren's Carriage, that their Actions will reasonably bear. Be slow in promising, punctual in fulfilling. Let Meekness and Innocency, Affableness, Yield∣ingness and Courtesie commend your Conversations to all Men. Let none of your Reflections want that Love and Loyalty, that Reverence and Duty, that Tenderness, Care and Vigilancy, which their seve∣ral Capacities call for. This is throughout Godliness. I charge you before the Most High God, that none of you be found a Swearer or a Lyat, or a lover of evil Company, or a Scoffer, or Malicious, or Cove∣tous, or a Drunkard, or a Glutton, unrighteous in Dealing, unclean in his Living, or a Quarreller, or a Thief, or a Backbiter, or a Railer: For I de∣nounce unto you, from the Living God, that De∣struction and Damnation is the End of all such, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.20. <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.12. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6, 9, 10. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.19, 20, 21.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="164" REF="004663_0188_100DE114EDD0D608"/>2. Family-Godliness. He that hath set up Christ in his Heart, will be sure to study to set him up in his House. Let every Family with you be a Chris∣tian Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.19. every House a House of Prayer: Let every Housholder say, with <HI>Joshua, I and my House will serve the Lord,</HI> Josh. 24.15. and resolve with <HI>David, I will walk within my House with a perfect Heart,</HI> Psal. 101.2. Let me press upon you a few Duties in general.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Let Religion be in your Families, not as a Matter by the by (to be minded at Leisure, when the World will give you leave) but the standing Business of the House: Let them have your Prayers as your Meals: Is there any of your Families but have time for their taking Food? Wretched Man! Canst thou find Time to eat in, and not find Time to pray in?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Settle it upon your Hearts, that your Souls are bound up in the Souls of your Families. They are committed unto you, and if they be lost through your Neglect, will be required at your Hands. Sirs, if you do not, you shall know, that the Charge of Souls is a heavy Charge, and that the Blood of Souls is a heavy Guilt. O Man! hast thou a Charge of Souls to answer for, and dost thou not bestir thy self for them, that their Blood be not found in thy Skirts? Wilt thou do no more for immortal Souls, than thou wilt do for thy Beasts that perish? What dost thou do for thy Children and Servants? Thou providest Meat and Drink for them, agreeable to their Natures; and dost thou not the same for thy Beast? Thou givest them Medicines, and cherishest them when they be sick: And dost thou not as much for thy Swine? More particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the solemn Reading of the Word and sing∣ing of Psalms, be your Family-Exercises, <HI>Isa.</HI> 34.26. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.39 <HI>Psal.</HI> 118.15. See Christ singing with his Family, <HI>viz.</HI> His Disciples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.30. <HI>Luk.</HI> 6 18.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="165" REF="004663_0189_100DE1174B30DE40"/>2. Let every Person in your Families be duly called to an Account of their profiting by the Word heard or read, as they be about doing your own Business: This is a Duty of Conscience unspeakable, and would be a Means to bring those under your Charge, to re∣member and profit by what you receive. See Christ's Example in calling his Family to an Account, <HI>Matt.</HI> 16.11, 13, 15.</P>
<P N="3">3. Often take an Account of the Souls under your Care, concerning their Spiritual Estates; (herein you must be Followers of Christ, <HI>Matth,</HI> 13.10, 36, 51. <HI>Mark</HI> 4.10, 11.) make Inquiry into their Conditions, insist much upon the Sinfulness and Misery of their natural Estate, and upon the Necessity of Regeneration and Conversion, in or∣der to their Salvation. Admonish them gravely of their Sins, encourage their Beginnings. Follow them earnestly, and let them have no quiet for you, till you see them in a saving Change. This is a Du∣ty of high Consequence, but (I am afraid) fearfully neglected. Doth not Conscience say, Thou art the Man?</P>
<P N="4">4. Look to the strict Sanctifying of the Sabbath by all your Houshold, <HI>Exod</HI> 20.19. <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.3. Ma∣ny poor Families have little Time else. O improve but your Sabbath Days as diligently in labouring for Knowledge, and doing your Master's Work, as you do the other Days in doing your own, and I doubt not but you may come to some Proficiency.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let the Morning and Evening-sacrifice of so∣lemn Prayer, be daily offered up in all your Families, <HI>Psal.</HI> 92.1, 2 <HI>Exod.</HI> 30.7.8. <HI>Luke</HI> 1.9, 10. Beware they be found among the Families that call not upon God's Name, for why should there be Wrath from the Lord, upon your Families? <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.25. O mise∣rable Families, without God in the World, that are without Family-Prayer! What! have you so many Fa∣mily-Sins, Family Wants, Family Mercies? Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and yet no Family-Prayers?

<PB N="166" REF="004663_0190_100DE26F48B42258"/>
Family-Prayer? <HI>Eph</HI> 6.18. Say not, I have no Time What, hast thou all thy Time, on purpose to serve God, and save thy Soul? and yet is this it for which thou canst find no Time? Find but a Heart, and I will find Time. Pinch out of your Meals and Sleep, rather than want for Prayer. Say not, my Business will not give Leave. This is the greatest Business to save thyself, and the Souls committed to thee. Bu∣siness, a Whet will be no Let. In a Word, the Bles∣sing of all is to be got by Prayer, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.11, 12. 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 7 29. And what is thy Business without God's Blessing? Say not, I am not able: Use the one Ta∣lent, and God will increase, <HI>Matt.</HI> 25.24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Helps are to be had, till thou art better able. But if there be no other Remedy, thou must join with thine abler Neighbour, GOD, hath special Regard to joint Prayer, <HI>James</HI> 5.4. to 19. <HI>Acts</HI> 12.5, 10, 12. 2 <HI>Corinthians</HI> 1.11. and therefore you must improve Family-Advantages for the perform∣ing of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Put every one in your Familes upon pri∣vate Prayer. Observe whether they do perform it. Get them the Help of a Form, if they need it, till they are able to go without it. Direct them how to pray, by minding them of their Sins, Wants and Mercies, the Materials of Prayer. This was the Practice of <HI>John,</HI> and of Jesus, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.1, 2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Set up Catechising in your Families, at the least once every Week. Have you no dread of the Almighty's Charge, that you should <Q>teach these Things diligently to your Children, and talk of them as you sit in your Houses.</Q> <HI>&amp;c. Deutero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omy</HI> 6.6, 7, 8, 9. and 4.9, 10. and 11 18, 19, 20. and <HI>train them up in the Way wherein they should go.</HI> Prov. 22.6. the Margin. Hath God so com∣manded <HI>Abraham,</HI> that he would teach <HI>his Children and Houshold,</HI> Gen. 18.19. and that he had many <HI>instructed Servanti,</HI> Gen. 14.14. see the Margin, and given such a Promise thereupon; and will not you
<PB N="167" REF="004663_0191_100DE1A7E06DF4C8"/>
put in for a Share, neither in Praise, nor the Promise? Hath Christ honoured Catechising with his Presence, <HI>Luke</HI> 2.46. and will you not own it with your Practice? Say not, they are careless, and will not learn: What have you your Authority for, if not to use it for God, and the good of their Souls? You will call them up, and force them to do your Work; and should not you at least be as zealous in putting them upon God's Work? Say not, they are dull, and are not capable: If they be dull, God requires of you the more Pains and Patience; but so dull as they are, you will make them learn how to Work; and can they not learn as well how to live? Are they capable of the Mysteries of your Trade, and are they not capable of the plain Principles of Religion? Well, if ever you would see the Growth of Reli∣gion, the Cure of Ignorance, the Remedy of Pro∣faneness, the Downfall of Error, fulfil you my Joy in going thorough with this Duty.</P>
<P>Will you answer the Calls of divine Providence? Would you remove the incumbent, or prevent the impending Calamities? Would you plant Nurseries for the Church of God? Would you that God should build your Houses, and bless your Substance? Would you that your Children should bless you? O then set up Piety in your Families, as ever you would be blessed, or be a Blessing: Let your Hearts and your Houses be the Temples of the living God, in which his Worship (according to all the said mentioned Directions) may be with Constancy reverendly performed, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.1. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardneth his Heart, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without Remedy.</HI> Oh! be wise in Time, that you be not miserable to Eternity.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="case">
<HEAD>1. Case of Conscience. On Matth. v. 47. <HI>What do you more than others?</HI></HEAD>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>WHEREIN should Christians be singu∣lar in their Obedience? or what may they, and must they do more than others?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Take the answer in these 16 <HI>Rules:</HI> Con∣taining the Character and Compass of a Christian:</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004663_0193_100DE1AB336B2D70"/><HI>Rule</HI> I. Heartily to love them that slight you, and to wish and seek the good of those that hate you, and seek to hurt you: This is the very thing urged in the Text. <HI>If you salute your Brethren, only, and love them that love you, do not even the</HI> Publicans <HI>the same?</HI> Matth. 5.46, 47. To love them that do respect and value us, this every one can do; but to love them truly that think meanly of us, and have Prejudices and hard Thoughts against us, and to speak well of them that speak Evil of us, (as the sweet-spirited <HI>Calvin</HI>) Let <HI>Luther</HI> call me Dog or Devil, I will say of him nevertheless, he is a precious Servant of Christ Jesus. This is to do more than others. Thus the Martyr <HI>Cranmer,</HI> of whom it was a Proverb (Do the Bishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI> a Displeasure, and you shall ever have him your Friend.) Thus that Holy Man, in his much to be admired parting Words, (I had never any greater Pleasure in all my Life than to forget and forgive Injuries, and to shew Kindness to them that sought Evil to me.) Study who have offend∣ed you, and disobliged you, and slighted you, and keep up good Thoughts of them (if the Case will bear it) and speak nothing but good of them, and think what Kindness you may shew them: <HI>Pray for them, wish well to them, so shall ye be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven,</HI> Matth. 5.45.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> II. To swim against the Stream of the Multitude: The dead Fish will swim with, but the Living, against the Stream. Many will tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jews,</HI> when their Interest will carry it in the World. When Religion is in Fashion, every one will be in it. But to bear Head against the Cur∣rent of the Times, and to be for strict Godliness in all your Ways, when the Stream runs quite a∣gainst it, to bear it down, and to resolve as <HI>David</HI> did, <HI>to be yet more vile;</HI> this is to be, and to do more than others. The <HI>Samaritans</HI> will need be <HI>Jews,</HI> when <HI>Alexander</HI> favours and helps them;
<PB N="3" REF="004663_0194_100DE1B025A9B558"/>
but when <HI>Antiochus</HI> bloodily rages against them, (as in the Time of the <HI>Maccabees</HI>) then they will be none of the Kin, but pretend themselves to be of another Stock (which, by the Way, was the Rea∣son of the deadly Hatred afterwards between the <HI>Jews</HI> and them.) But to be singular in your good Choice and Resolutions, with <HI>Joshua;</HI> though all should vote against you with one Consent; and with <HI>Noah</HI> to be perfect in our Generation, when never so adulterous, and to walk with God when all Flesh have corrupted their Way, and tread a contrary Course, this is to do more than others. Thus the three Children, or rather the three Champi∣ons (who would not fear the Flouts of the Multi∣tude, nor the Frowns of the great Ones, nor the Charge of Singularity, but when all the Princes, Governours, Captains, Counsellors, Sheriffs, and all the People, Nations and Languages fell down and worshipped, they stood by themselves, and would not sinfully comply, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.3, 7, 18.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> III. To take most care of that which is most out of Sight. A Christian's Eye is most on the Things least seen; first upon his Heart, herein he doth exceed the Righteousness of the Pharisees, whose great Care was to keep all fair and clean that came to view, but looked no farther: Make great Conscience of your Carriage in secret, and let your main Guard be upon your Hearts, and this will be more than others reach to. This was <HI>Paul's</HI> Care, to keep his Conscience, his Inside, clean and undefiled, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.16. and <HI>Job's</HI> Care, that tho' all the World did reproach him, he might not put a Reproach in the Mouth of his Conscience, <HI>Job</HI> 27.6. and <HI>David's</HI> Care that his Heart might be clean. 2. <HI>Upon his Hope.</HI> Others look to the Things <HI>seen,</HI> Things in Hand; but the true Believer eyes his <HI>Hopes,</HI> walks by <HI>Faith,</HI> not by <HI>Sight,</HI> and lives a quite different Life from many others in the World besides; as living upon the Hope of Heaven doth differ from living on the Pleasures, Profits and Ho∣nours of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004663_0195_100DE0082F0F9798"/><HI>Rule</HI> IV. To be merciful to others Failings, and very severe to our own. The noble Roman <HI>Cato,</HI> could more easily forgive any than himself To aggravate our <HI>own Evils,</HI> and to have an Excuse ready for our Brothers, and to censure ourselves freely, and to come with the Mantle behind us to cover our Brother; this is to do more than others. The Hypocrite is a Censurer abroad; he is like the Eye that can see any thing but itself: He can discern a Mote in his Brother's Eye, but not a Beam in his own. But the Servant of God rebukes others with Meekness, but falls out easily and bitterly with himself.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> V. <HI>To suffer rather than to sin.</HI> This was <HI>Moses's</HI> choice, but the Hypocrite is quite contra∣ry: He chooseth Iniquity rather than Affliction. To go so far with Christ as our Way lies together, is to do no more than an unsound Professor may reach to: The Trial is when Christ's Interest and ours do cross, and we must either baulk our Duty, or our Safety and Advantage. The famous Martyr under <HI>Julian,</HI> would not give one Half-penny to∣wards the Building of the Idol's Temple, tho' he was offered his Life by the Emperor on those Terms: The godly high Priest <HI>Eleazer,</HI> when the Nobles persuaded him to eat other Meat under Colour of Swine's Flesh, and they would persuade the King <HI>Antiochus</HI> that he had eaten Swine's Flesh, would die rather than stain his Profession with the Appear∣ance of Evil. When a Man shall lie in outward Misery, and have a Door of Deliverance opened, if he would but sin, and yet he will not accept of it, as those Worthies in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Martyrology: This is to do more than others, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.36.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> VI. <HI>To rejoice for Losses in Christ, and glory in the Cross.</HI> When others be discouraged at the News of Hardship, as that forward and seemingly resolved Disciple, or shall be offended as soon as the Sun of Persecution is up. When we shall take pleasure <HI>in Infirmities, in Tribulations,</HI> and rejoice
<PB N="5" REF="004663_0196_100DE1B2D9E40D40"/>
that we are <HI>counted worthy to suffer</HI> Shame for the Name of Christ; this is to do more than others. When the Servants of God shall not only <HI>patiently and triumphantly</HI> undergo the Crosses that crack the Brains, and break the Hearts of others, and shall shake off the Viper without receiving any hurt, when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> shall sing in the Stocks, and the resolved Martyr shall embrace the Faggots, and kiss the Stake: When the valiant <HI>Philpot</HI> shall say of his Prison (In the Judgment of the World we are in Hell, but I find in it the sweet Conso∣lation of Heaven) and the Holy <HI>Bradford</HI> (My Prison is sweeter to me than any Parlour, than any Pleasure I have had in all my Life.) This is indeed to exceed others.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> VII. <HI>To be good when we shall be evil spoken of for our Labour.</HI> A <HI>Pharisee</HI> will do those Duties that will gain Applause with Man, but to take up with despised Duties, disgraceful Duties, and with <HI>Davia</HI> to be religious, when it shall render him vile: This is to do more than others. The Philo∣sopher could say, <HI>It is noble indeed for a Man to do Well, when he knows he shall bear Ill for it.</HI> To take up Religion when every one kicks it off, to stand up alone with <HI>Luther</HI> for the Truth, when the whole World is gone a Wandering after the Whore. To have his Hand against every Man, and to be for Christ with <HI>Athanasius,</HI> against the whole Uni∣verse: This is indeed to do some singular Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> VIII. <HI>To strike in with God's Interest when it is falling.</HI> To join ourselves with the Lord's People, when it is the weakest, to espouse their Interest with <HI>Moses,</HI> when they were in deep Af∣fliction, <HI>Heb</HI> 11.25, 26. To own ourselves to be some of them undauntedly, when this Way is every where spoken against, this is to tread Anti∣podes to the Course of this World.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> IX. <HI>To be most cruel to the Sin that is natu∣rally most dear.</HI> The Hypocrite hide▪ his sweet Morsel under his Tongue, he spares as it were the

But when a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n shall off with his right Hand, out with his right Eye, serve his <HI>Absalom,</HI> as <HI>Joab</HI> did, when he took three Darts and thrust thorough his Heart: This is to do more than others. The sincere Christian is mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> angry with the Sin of his Temper, against this he aims the Arrows of all his Prayers. <HI>He keeps him from his Iniquity,</HI> he drives the whole Herd of Sin before him, but especially shoots at, singles out this to run it down.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> X. <HI>To live upon the divine Promises when o∣thers live upon their Possessions.</HI> Others are all for what is in Hand, with them Words are but Wind, they cannot live upon them, the Promises are to them <HI>a barren Heath and dry Breasts.</HI> But when we make the Promises our Heritage, the Staff of our Life, the Life of our Hearts, when the Promises are the Bottle we run to in all our Fainting; and while others hope to their Wealth, our Hope is in the Word. This is to do more than others.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> XI. <HI>To love that best and choose that soonest which doth cross the Flesh most.</HI> The godly Man's Rule is to take the Self-denial aside, so he be sure it be safe; when others Study is to please themselves, his is to curb himself: The Life of others is a <HI>Flesh-pleasing,</HI> his a <HI>Self denying</HI> Life; others Joy is, when they can <HI>gratify themselves,</HI> his, when he can get <HI>victory over himself.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> XII. <HI>To be most hot in that wherein Self i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> least concerned. Paul</HI> is meek as a Lamb under per∣sonal Injuries, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.12. <HI>Acts</HI> 7.16. But how is his Spirit stirred when God is dishonoured? A Man of Understanding is of a cool Spirit, that is in his own Concern; but <HI>Moses</HI> the Meek waxes hot with Indignation at the Sight of the Calf. To be hot and forward in those Duties where the Flesh's In∣terest is concerned, is to do more than <HI>Jehu,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 10.16, 20.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004663_0198_100DE1B74A027C18"/><HI>Rule</HI> XIII. <HI>To make a true Conscience of the least Sins, but most Conscience of the greatest.</HI> In one of these will the Hypocrite be found tardy. It may be he will fly from open Sins, and startle at gross staring Sins; but of little Sins he makes little Con∣science; this he allows of, and connives at. Or else he will be very tender of <HI>little Things,</HI> scruple the Plucking the Ears of Corn on the <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> or the Curing of the Sick, and strain at the Gnat; when he will in other Things swallow a Camel, devour Widows Houses. The Sincere will indulge no Sin; grieves for, groans under, cries out feeling∣ly against his very Infirmities; but most dreads what God most hates.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> XIV. <HI>To allow yourselves in the Neglect of no Duty, but to reserve your Zeal for the Duties of most Weight.</HI> To tithe Mint and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>min, and ne∣glect Judgment, Mercy and Faith, to be zealous for Human Ceremonies, Ordinances, and Men's Traditions, and omit the weightier Matters of the Law, is right the <HI>Pharisees</HI> guise, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.2. To eye both the Tables, to join sweetly together Morality and Piety, to be punctual with Men, but not careless of God, to give to <HI>Cesar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Cesar's,</HI> but first to give to God the Things that be God's, this is to do more than others. The sincere Christian hath Respect to all God's Commandments; walks in all his Statutes; He is throughout with God, but he is most zealous in those Things that lie next the Heart of Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> XV. <HI>To love your Reprovers.</HI> Herein <HI>David</HI> doth more than <HI>Ahab,</HI> see their contrary Frames, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22.8. <HI>Psa.</HI> 141.5.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> XVI. <HI>To subject all your worldly Interests to your Maker's Glory,</HI> and perform holy Duties with Holy Ends, and while others do their best Actions with carnal Aims; you must do your common and civil Actions with heavenly Aims.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004663_0199_100DE1BB70893390"/>Q. <HI>How may we know whether we be, and do more than others that are unsound?</HI></P>
<P>I shall answer this Question by propounding eight Questions to you, beseeching you to retire to the most solemn and strict Examination, and make Conscience to give a clear Answer to these few Interrogatories, and that will resolve the Case.</P>
<P>Q. I. <HI>When others do pick and choose, have you re∣spect to all God's Commandments?</HI> The Hypocrite may have great respect to the Comforts, but he hath little to the Commands of Religion: He is much for the Privilege and Promises: little for the Pre∣cepts and Duties: He is partial in the Law; he will take but here and there where he likes, and where God's Commands will serve his Interest, or at least will not pinch too hard upon the Flesh. The sound Christian sets all God's Commands be∣fore him; he eyes all his Copy; and heartily de∣signs and studies a throughout Conformity: He hath no starting Holes, no contrived Haunts; nor doth he halt between the Lord and <HI>Baal,</HI> nor serve two Masters: He doth not fear the Lord, and serve other Gods, nor divides his Service be∣tween God and Mammon, but he is all for Uniformity and entirely devoted to God's Service, and Fear alone; he hath a good Conscience willing in all Things to live honestly, and doth truly, though not perfectly forsake all his Sins, and keep all his Statutes that are known to him. Let me therefore ask you two Questions: (1. When others divide the Tables, do you sweetly conjoin them in your Practice? The Hypocrite, may be, is <HI>just</HI> and <HI>square</HI> towards Men, but follow him to his Family or Closet, you shall find but little of God: His Family is neglected, his Soul is neglected; or it may be he is a forward First-Table-Man, but you shall find him tardy in the Second. He will make many Prayers and long Prayers, yet make no Con∣science of devouring Widows Houses. He is a great
<PB N="9" REF="004663_0200_100DE1BD45890DA0"/>
Pretender to Piety, but mean while neglects Judg∣ment and Mercy. The Sincere join all together. He is so far careful of Justice with Men, that mean∣while he will not neglect the first and great Part of <HI>Justice, viz</HI> To give God his Due: He doth justly, he loves Mercy, but withal walks humbly with God: He walketh soberly with respect to himself, righteously towards his Neighbour, and godly towards his Maker. He is not one of those that are good only on their Knees, but you shall find him every where conscientious: You shall have Temperance at his Table, Chastity and Mo∣desty in his Behaviour, Grace and Truth in his Works, Charity in his Deeds, Faithfulness in his Trust, Justice in his Dealings. He doth not only seem to be religious, but bridleth his Tongue; He is not only <HI>a good Christian, but a good Neigh∣bour,</HI> not only <HI>a good Man, but a good Husband, a good Master, a dutiful Child, a diligent and faithful Servant, a good Subject:</HI> In a Word, he makes a great Conscience of discharging the Du∣ties of his Relations among Men. (2) When others stick in <HI>Externals,</HI> do you look to the spiritual Part of every Command, and principally mind the Inwards and Virals of Religion? Do you not on∣ly make Conscience of performing Duties, but do you carefully look to the <HI>Manner</HI> of performing of them, and the Ends for which we do perform them? Do you not only make Conscience of open, but of secret Sins? Do you abound above all in secret Duties? Do you keep a Watch upon your Hearts, and make Conscience, not only of the gross Acts of Sin, but even of sinful Thoughts, Inclinations and Desires; and are grieved even with your very Infirmities, and the corrupt Dis∣positions of your Natures, which you cannot help, tho' you would?</P>
<P>Q. II. <HI>When others have their Reserves in Closing with Christ, do you give up all to him entirely?</HI> Have you taken Christ not Hand over Head, but deli∣berately,
<PB N="10" REF="004663_0201_100DE1C096E4EA88"/>
understandingly, sitting down first, and counting the Cost? Have you not secret Reserves for your own Ease, Safety, Estates, Esteem, on some be∣loved Sin? Have you, upon solemn Consideration, accepted Christ as the Lord your Righteousness, for better, for worse, for all Changes of Times and Con∣ditions, to run all Hazards with him, and to take your Lot with him, fall as it will?</P>
<P>Q. III. <HI>When others are for a little of Religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the by, do you make Religion your Business?</HI> Do you not put off God with the World's Leavings, and serve him when you are at Leisure? Must not God stand by, while the World is first served: And are not your Souls the least of your Cares? And put off with some <HI>by Scraps</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> of your time? Is Re∣ligion your Trade, and your Conversation in Hea∣ven? Do you <HI>walk with God?</HI> Or have you only now and then a Turn with him? When you have ended your Prayers, is there an End of your Reli∣gion till you come to them again? Or do you car∣ry on a Design of Religion throughout your whole Course? Have you only a List of Religion at the out-side of the Piece? Or is the Woof of Religion woven into the whole Cloth, into Heart and Life, into your Discourse, and Trades, and Table? Do you first seek the <HI>Kingdom of God, and the Righte∣ousness thereof?</HI> Is it the chief Care of your Lives, that God be served, and your Souls be saved? And is this the one Thing necessary with you, that you chiefly mind, and are most solicitous about? Do your very Hearts say with <HI>David, One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Q. VI. <HI>When are others are for the Wages of Religion, are you for the Work?</HI> Can you say with <HI>David, I have chosen thy Precepts?</HI> Do your Hearts come off freely in this Choice? Had you rather be Holy than otherwise, if you were at your Choice? Had you rather be God's Servants, and live at his Com∣mand, than at your own Lusts? Do you count the Laws of Christ your Heritage, or rather do you no
<PB N="11" REF="004663_0202_100DE1C322B38798"/>
count them your Bondage? Do you choose not only the <HI>Wages</HI> of Righteousness, but the <HI>Ways</HI> of Righteousness? Are God's Commandments your <HI>Delight?</HI> And are the <HI>sweetest Hours</HI> of your Lives the Hours ye spend with him? Do you never en∣joy yourselves so much as when you most enjoy God? Is his Service the greatest Comfort, and is it Meat and Drink to you to do his Will, unless when you are not yourselves in the time of Temptation and Desertion? Do you make Use of holy Duties only as Men do of Physick, when they are ill at Ease, when Conscience lasheth, or Affliction stings, as it were, to conjure down the frightful Furies? Or to pacify God, that he may not hurt you? Or else do you use them as your daily Bread, and the very Staff of your Life, and Means of your Com∣forts?</P>
<P>Q. V. <HI>When others are for the cheap and easy Reli∣gion, are you for Self-Denial?</HI> When others are for the Religion that will serve them best, are you for that which will serve God best? When others are all upon the sparing Hand, and will spare what may be spared, and study how they may best save Charges in going to Heaven, are you of princely Spirits, to resolve not to serve the Lord with that which will cost you nothing? Is your Course of Religion such as doth put your Flesh to it, and cross and curb its Desires, or do you love to give it what it craves, and suffer it to make its own Way? Have you no Enemy you dread so much as Self? Do you pamper and please it and make Provisions for it? or do you pray and watch against it, and grieve for its unhappy Infirmities in your Actions? And had rather than all the World that this Enemy were under your Feet?</P>
<P>Q. VI. <HI>When others are for no more of Religion than needs must, are you for the Height of Religion?</HI> The Hypocrite (as one well) is very inquisitive what is the lowest Pitch that a Man may have and go to Heaven; and upon this Design, if he could
<PB N="12" REF="004663_0203_100DE1C5B6FC3F88"/>
find but this, he would look no farther: But the sincere Christian, though satisfied that his State is safe, will rest in no Attainments in Grace, but reaches forward and presses on, if it were possible, to attain to the Resurrection of the Dead. He that doth not <HI>desire, and design, and endeavour Perfection, never yet came up to Sincerity.</HI> A true Believer desires <HI>Holiness for Holiness</HI> sake, and therefore is set upon <HI>perfecting Holiness:</HI> Others desire it only for Heaven sake, and therefore only for so much as will bear their Charges thither; others make use of Holiness only as a Bridge to Heaven, and therefore are for no more than will just serve their turn. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And they have a false Notion of Heaven itself, else they might justly desire it as the End of their present Holiness, it being the Fruition of God in perfect Holiness.</NOTE> The true Believer hath a holy Nature, and therefore Ho∣liness is his Element; and natu∣ral Employment; and he must needs desire Holiness in its Height because every Nature reaches af∣ter Perfection in its Kind; the godly Man desires not Holiness, because it is the Way to Heaven, but he he loves Heaven the better for the holy Way that leads to it, and for the perfect Holiness which is there.</P>
<P>Q. VII. <HI>When others are all for the Salvation of Christ, are you as truly by Sanctification for Christ?</HI> Do you take Christ as God offers him, with all his Offices and Benefits, to be both a Prince and a Saviour, to give you Repentance as well as Re∣mission of Sins? Are you willing of the Domini∣on of Christ, as well as Deliverance by Christ? Do you close with his Burden, as well as his Be∣nefits? Do you count his Laws your Liberty? His Government not your Bondage, but your Pri∣vilege? His Service your Freedom? Do you go in Christ's Ways, as in Goals and Fetters? Or do you run with Enlargement of Heart, Delight, or real Willingness?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004663_0204_100DE1C73B17BF20"/>Q. VIII. <HI>When others do make Self their Ends do you set up God above all, as your highest End?</HI> The Hypocrite doth the same Duties with the God∣ly, but with different Ends; He eats for himself, and fasts for himself, and prays with no better than Self-Ends, and therefore is rejected. Now is it your great Design in your whole Course to glo∣rify God, and enjoy God: Do you count this your whole Business and Blessedness? Do you make other Business to stoop to this? Other In∣terests to yield to this? Do your Souls breath after this above all worldly Good, that Christ may be magnified in you? Do you count your Name and your Estate as Loss, and the Delights of Sense but Puddle-Water in Comparison of Christ? If Con∣science give a comfortable and clear Answer to these Questions, go in Peace: Blessed are you of the Lord, God is your Friend, Heaven is your Heri∣tage, the Promises are your Portion, Christ is yours, all is yours; for he that doth these Things shall never be moved, <HI>Psalm</HI> 15.5.</P>

<P>Q. <HI>WHAT may and must a Christian be, and do, that he may please God:</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To your Pleasing of God something is neces∣sary, as to your Persons and Estates, and something as to your Performance and Acts.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to your Persons or Estates, it is neces∣sary in general, that you be in a State of Reconcili∣ation with God: If you would walk worthy of the Lord unto All-pleasing, you must first be Friends with him, for how can two walk together except they be agreed? Get the Controversy taken up between God and thee, and then thou shalt with <HI>Levi, walk with God in Peace.</HI> Labour to get the Breaches made up, to have the Enmity slain, to have divine Displeasure removed. Till thy Par∣don
<PB N="14" REF="004663_0205_100DE1C9CEB49660"/>
be obtained, and thy Peace made, nothing thou canst do will please God, he will be angry with thy Person, and angry with thy Prayers. What a fart Message is that to impenitent Sinners, <HI>Mal</HI> 1.10. God cannot take Pleasure in their Persons; <HI>I have no Pleasure in you, saith the Lord of Hosts,</HI> nor in any of their Performances; <HI>neither will I ac∣cept an Offering at your Hand:</HI> He professeth that his Soul had no Delight in them, and tells them that they are unto him <HI>as a Vessel wherein there is no Pleasure,</HI> Jer. 22.28. It's the modest Expression of that Vessel into which Nature empties itself. Come in then, and touch the golden Scepter, yield to Mercy, kiss the Son, resign to Christ; accept of the Peace tendered you in the Word of Recon∣ciliation, and then God will be friends. More par∣ticularly, that you may be in a State of Reconcili∣ation, and so in a Capacity of pleasing God, you must follow these Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Put off every Sin:</HI> It is your Iniquity that se∣parateth between you and your God, this is the Make bate. If thou wouldst have God pleased, turn every Sin out of Doors, pluck it out, cast it from thee: <HI>If thou regard Iniquity in thine Heart, God will not h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thee,</HI> nor <HI>regard thee,</HI> Psal. 66.1. If thou art of them that have <HI>Pleasure in Unrigh∣teousness,</HI> the Lord hath no <HI>Pleasure in thee.</HI> He is not a God that hath Pleasure in Wickedness, Evil shall not dwell with him: The Foolish shall not stand in his Sight: He hateth all the Workers of Iniquity. See that thou abandon every Sin that thou knowest, spare not one <HI>Agag,</HI> not a right Eye, not an <HI>Herodias;</HI> for then God will not spare thee, give the Darling of thy Bosom a Bill of Di∣vorce, say to all thy Idols, <HI>Get thee hence.</HI> God will not look to that Man that looks pleasantly upon any Sin; the jealous God will not endure to see thee Hankering on the Harlot's Lips, embra∣cing any Sin with Delight. He will not bear it to see thee smile upon any Sin: He holds thee for
<PB N="15" REF="004663_0206_100DE1CD26774E28"/>
a Traitor to his Crown, if thou willingly har∣bour his Enemy. Tho' thou be very diligent in God's Service, and presentest him with Multitudes of Sacrifices, and many Prayers, he will be pleased with nothing, but hides his Face, and stops his Ears, whilst thou keepest thine Iniquities in thine Hands, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.16, 17, 18. God will not amicably treat with them, that will not put away the Evil of their Doings. O look not into thine Hands, look into thy Heart, look into thy House! into thy Shop! thy Trade! thy Calling! see if there be not some Way of Wickedness that thou art found in. Thou canst not have Peace with God, nor he Pleasure in thee, till this be removed; put off therefore the old Man with his Deeds.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Put on the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> Rom. 13.</P>
<P>First, <HI>The red Robe of his Righteousness for Justi∣fication.</HI> The Lord will never give thee a good Look, nor a good Word but in Christ: He is a re∣venging, a consuming Fire out of Christ, but get on his Robes, and he will be well pleased. <HI>Enoch</HI> had his Testimony that he pleased God; but Christ had much more, that God was well pleased with Sinners, in and for him. Away with these Rags, and with these Fig-leaves. How can the Righte∣ous Soul of God but abhor you, whilst in the men∣struous Cloths of your own Righteousness? Dare not to come to God, but with Christ in your Arms. Approach him not but in the Garments of your elder Brother, lest you carry away the Curse. <HI>Jo∣shua</HI>'s filthy Garments must be put off, and Christ's Raiment put on; or else there is no standing be∣fore the bright and burning Eyes of infinite Holi∣ness. Put on the Lord Jesus in Believing; that is, accept of him in all his Offices, with all his In∣conveniencies, and deliver up thyself to him, and this will intitle thee to his Merit and Righ∣teousness: Without this, nothing will avail. If thy Head were Waters, and thine Eye a Foun∣tain of Tears, if thou should wear thy Tongue
<PB N="16" REF="004663_0207_100DE1CF78D754A0"/>
to the Roots with Praying, if thou shouldst weep an Ocean, and wash thyself in thine own Brine; all could not get out one Spot; nothing can be accepted, while thou art out of Christ; and there∣fore in the first Place apply thyself to him. God will accept of no Gift but off his Altar.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The white Robe of his Grace of Sanctification,</HI> Rev. 5.11. Thou that art in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> that is, unrenewed, unsanctified, <HI>canst not please GOD,</HI> Rom. 8.8. Never think to <HI>make</HI> up the Matter by a little <HI>mending and reforming</HI> particular Acts: Man, thy <HI>Heart</HI> must be <HI>renewed,</HI> thy State must be clean <HI>altered,</HI> or God cannot be pleased, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.17, 18. The Tree must be made good, the Fountain must be healed, or else the Stream will be salt, and the Fruit sowre. If Christ be once formed in thee, that is, his Image in his Grace: Like∣ness is the Ground of Love: Similitude and Suit∣ableness of Nature is the Lead-stone of Affection. God cannot but love his own Likeness: Wouldst thou have his Favour? Wouldst thou be his De∣light? then conform to his Pleasure, study to be like him, purify thyself as he is pure. The righteous Lord loveth Righteousness; he desireth Truth in the inward Parts, and takes infinite Com∣placency in the Graces of his People. These are the Spikenard and Saffron, the Spices, the Beds of Lillies; the sweet Ointment that Christ is so taken up with: These are the Cinnamon and the Trees of Frankincense; the Calamus and Camphire, the Myrrhe and the Aloes; the Chains of the Neck, and the precious Pearls, that he is so ravished withal, and doth so superlatively commend, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.9. This is the Raiment of Needle-work, and Gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> wherein the Queen is presented to her Royal Husband, <HI>Psalm</HI> 45.9, 3. Therefore as the Elect of God, Holy and Beloved, <HI>Col.</HI> 5.12, 13. Put ye on <HI>Bowels of Mercy, Kindness;</HI> put off all these, <HI>Anger, Wrath, Malice, filthy Communication, and put on the New-Man,</HI> Coloss. 3.9, 10. Particularly,
<PB N="17" REF="004663_0208_100DE1D1505C52F0"/>
let me commend to you some special Graces which God doth manifest himself to be wonderfully plea∣sed withal. As ever you would please God, get on these.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Be clothed with Humility,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.5. This is a Garment which must be put on, or else you can∣not be accepted or saved, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.3. Here is the Dress that you must come to God in: He must be <HI>serv'd in humility of Mind,</HI> Acts 20.14. You must humble yourselves to walk with him, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.8. Humility is a plain, but yet a comely Garment: This Grace doth eminently honour God; and there∣fore God doth put a peculiar honour upon, and manifest a most special Delight in this: Of all the Men in the World, this is the Man that God will look unto; even he that is pure, and of a con∣trite Spirit, that trembleth at his Word, <HI>Isaiah</HI> 66.2. Though he be the high and lofty One, who in∣habiteth Eternity, whose Name is holy: From whence the trembling Soul is ready to conclude, that surely such a fearful Majesty cannot but de∣spise him; such sin-hating Purity cannot but abhor him; yet he will lay, <HI>Isaiah</HI> 47.15, aside his Ma∣jesty, and bear with Man's impurity, and conde∣scend to most familiar and constant Communion and Cohabitation with his poor Dust, when contrite at his Feet, and prostrate in Humility: If thou would∣est be accepted of God, come as <HI>Benhadad</HI>'s Servants to the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> with a Rope about thy Neck, and Ashes on thy Head, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.32. think mean∣ly on thy self, and God will honour thee, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.30. Put thy self in the lowest Rooms, and God will set thee higher: Be little in thine own Eyes, and thou shalt be high in his: A proud Heart and a proud Look is with God the first-born of Abomi∣nation: As ever thou wouldst have God well plea∣sed with thee, be throughly displeased with thyself. If thou dost throughly loath thy self, God doth love thee, if thou abhorrest thyself, God delighteth in thee: Be angry with thy self, and the Almighty
<PB N="18" REF="004663_0209_100DE1D3BA2CAB70"/>
will turn away his Anger from thee: Condemn thyself, and God will acquit thee. In no wise extenuate thy Sins, nor justify thyself. Think the worse of thyself and be willing that others should think meanly of thee, and heartily love them that slight thee. This is the Frame in which God is well pleased: Pass Sentence on thyself, and God will absolve thee: Set thyself at his Foot-stool, and he will lift thee up into the Throne, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Labour for sincerity.</HI> This is not a distinct Grace from the rest, yet for Doctrine-sake I speak to it distinctly. Uprightness is the great thing that God looks after, and covenants for, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. It renders all our Persons and Performances accepta∣ble before God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.8. Such as are upright in the Way, are God's delight, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11 20. To these are all the Promises of Peace, Salvation, Par∣don, Preservation, Blessedness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 87.10. In a Word, there is <HI>no good thing God will withhold from them that walk uprightly,</HI> Prov. 28.10. This was <HI>Noah</HI>'s Praise that he was upright <HI>in his Genera∣tion.</HI> This was that which set off <HI>Job</HI> at such a Rate, that God doth so extol him for, and as it were, makes his Boast of him: The singular sincerity and integrity of his Heart. Study to be upright: that the main bent of your Hearts be to please God, and honour him; that God's interest be up∣permost with you; that he hath the chief Share in you, and the Eye of the Soul be principally to him; for in this sincerity doth consist, as to your State. Let your great care be your Heart; here is a Christian's great Work. The Lord seeth not as Man seeth, for Man looketh on the outward Ap∣pearance, but the Lord looketh to the Heart; see therefore that thou look to it. Let thine Eye be chiefly there where God's Eye is. He looketh not so much what thou dost, as with what a Heart go then and do likewise. Yet be not satisfied in this, that you are upright as to your State, but labour to

approve yourselves in Uprightness to God in spiri∣tual Actions. Do common, as well as spiritual Actions, with holy Ends. Much of our Lives are lost for want of this. So much is done for God; of his strange Grace, he accounts himself our Deb∣tro. But what is done for no higher End than Self, is lost from our Account.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Put on a Spirit of Zeal and Activity.</HI> How wonderfully is God pleased with <HI>Phineas</HI>'s Zeal <HI>Numb</HI> 15 11, 12, 13, What great Approbation doth he manifest of him? What Attestation doth he give to him? He is so greatly pleased with his zealous Appearance for him, that he turns away his Displeasure from the whole Congregation of <HI>Israel,</HI> and overlooks their Crimson Provocations against him: On the contrary, there is nothing that God is more displeased with, than the remissness, and lifelessness, and indifference in Religion. The Luke-warm Water is not a greater Offence to the Stomach, than the Luke-warm Professor is to God: And therefore he will Spew such a one out of his Mouth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.16. Christians, where is your Zeal for the Lord of Hosts? Christ's redeemed must be zealous of good Works, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. not slothful in Business, but fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord, <HI>Acts</HI> 18.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12, 11. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.6.7. instant∣ly Night and Day for the hope of the Promise. Do not only that which is right in the sight of the Lord, but do it with all your Heart; the Lord loveth a willing Servant: Bestir yourselves for the Lord. Be ye followers of Christ, who went up and down doing good. Every Christian should be a common Blessing, a publick Good. This is to be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, who is good unto all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works. And be sure the Father doth best love that Child that is most like him. A private narrow Spirit is a low and a base Spirit, unworthy of a Christian. A Catholick communicative Spirit is full of great Desires, and
<PB N="20" REF="004663_0211_100DE1D9708CE8C8"/>
great Designs: A large Heart set upon doing good, whose Fire, though ever hottest within, will be breaking forth of his Breast and provoking others; whose Love will not be confined to a Party, but gladly and thankfully owneth Christ wherever he sees him: This Catholick Spirit, I say, is the Glo∣ry of Religion, the Church's Blessing, and God's Delight.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Live by Faith,</HI> Heb. 10.38. This is a preci∣ous Grace in God's Account, 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 1, 1. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1.7. It giveth Glory to God, and therefore God taketh no small pleasure in it. By Faith <HI>Enoch</HI> obtains that Testimony, that he pleased God, <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.20. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.5. 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 4 18. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.39. <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.10.11. If you would so walk as to please God, you must walk by Faith. Christians must look to the things unseen; they must not live at the com∣mon Rate. Christ must be their Life and Breath, their Prayers and their Promises, their daily Bread. By Faith did the Elders obtain that good Report; 'twas Faith that Christ was so greatly taken with in the <HI>Centurion,</HI> which made him to commend him for a <HI>none such.</HI> This was that which won such a singular Praise and Approbation from our Saviour to the Woman of <HI>Canaan;</HI> even her Victo∣rious Faith, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.28. Thou hast taken away my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse, thou hast taken away my Heart with one of thine Eyes, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.9. that is, with thy Faith. Live in the Power of Faith, and thou wilt please him to the Heart, give Glory to him by believing. Let the Life that thou now livest in the Flesh, be by the Faith of the Son of God: Faith, as one well says, is the Navel of Morality.</P>
<P>Live by Faith in <HI>Prosperity:</HI> Tho' thou hast the World about thee, let it not be above thee, keep it at thy Feet, use it as thy Servant: Be much in the views of Glory and Contemplation of Eternity: Buy as tho' thou possessest not, rejoice as tho' thou rejoicest not, love as tho' thou lovest not, use this
<PB N="21" REF="004663_0212_100DE1DAF5C778A8"/>
World as not abusing it. It is but a Fashion, not a Substance, and that which passeth away, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.30, 31. Use it therefore with mortified Affections, and prove the Sincerity of your Faith by the Victory over your inordinate Content and Delight in, and Desires after, and Cares for, the Things of this World, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.4.</P>
<P>Live by Faith in <HI>Adversity:</HI> Weep as tho' thou wept not, enduring the Cross, and despising the Shame, as looking unto Jesus, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2 <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.26. accounting Christ's Reproaches your Riches, his Shame your Glory, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.41. Compare these light Afflictions with the weight of Glory, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.18. Ply your Hearts with the Pro∣mises; count if you can get the Riches that are laid up in them; roll yourselves upon the Lord, <HI>Psalms</HI> 37.1. and know that your Heavenly Father hath no greater Delight, than to see his Children trust him with Confidence, when all visible Helps are out of sight, and he seems to be their Enemy, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.15.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Put on the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit;</HI> this is in the sight of God of great Price: Study to be (1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3.3.) like your Father, slow to Anger, ready to forgive, <HI>Psalm</HI> 130.1, 8. for∣getting Injuries, loving Enemies, requiting Ill-will with Kindness, Ill words with Courtesies, Neglects with Benefits; and if any wrong you, do him Kindness the sooner; so shall you bear his Likeness, and be his Delight: And know ye that are of unmortified Passions, and unbridled Tongues, God hath an especial hatred and displeasure against a <HI>Froward Heart,</HI> and a Froward Tongue, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.32.1.20.1.12.8.12. Oh seek Meekness: How can the Holy Dove rest in a wrathful Heart? Christ is a Lamb of Meekness, how can he take Pleasure in an unquiet and contentious Spirit! Verily, with the Froward, he will shew himself froward, <HI>Psalm</HI> 18.26. If you will nor forgive others, he will not forgive you. Art thou hard to be pleased,
<PB N="22" REF="004663_0213_100DE1DC89C62AB0"/>
a froward Wife, a froward Master, a cross and wil∣ful Servant? Surely God will not be pleased with thee; he will mete to you as you Measure to others, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.24.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Get a Spirit of Self denial.</HI> God is then pleased best, when Self is displeased most. When we can be content to be empty, content to be aba∣sed, that God might be honoured, and with the Holy <HI>Baptist,</HI> are willing to be eclipsed by Christ: willing to decrease that he may encrease; count∣ing ourselves no Losers, whilst his Interest is a Gainer, <HI>John</HI> 3.29, 30. rejoicing that we are made low for Christ's Advancement; this is well-pleasing unto God; how greatly was he pleased with <HI>So∣lomon's</HI> Self-denying Choice, and gives him his Asking, throwing in Riches, and Honour into the Bargain? 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 3.10, 11, 12. Strange was <HI>A∣braham</HI>'s Self-denial. What? to sacrifice with his own Hand, the whole Hope of his Family? the Heir of Promise! the Child of his Years! a Son! and only Son! wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his Life was bound up in the Lad's Life! Was ever Mortal thus put to it? But <HI>Abraham</HI> shall not be a Loser. God gives him a Testimony from Heaven, blesses him, blesses his Seed, blesses all Nations in him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.15, 16, 17, 18. Wonderful was <HI>Moses</HI> his <HI>Self denial,</HI> but more wonderful was his Acceptation and Reward, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.24. None like <HI>Moses, Deut.</HI> 34.20 God preferreth him in another manner than <HI>Pharoah</HI> could. He must speak with him Face to Face, as a Man with his Friend; his Word shall be as it were a Law with God. Speak for whom he will, they shall be spared, though they seem to be devoted to Destruction. But speak against him who duist, he shall be sure to bear his Iniquity, <HI>Numb.</HI> 12.8. Forget Self: Renounce thine own Wisdom, thine own Worthiness, thine own Will: Bite in thy Passions, curb thine Appetite; bridle thy Tongue: This do, and thou shalt be gently accepted, and shall find that God's Favour will infinitely reward
<PB N="23" REF="004663_0214_100DE1E07745DB48"/>
thee, for all the murmuring Oppositions, and dis∣contents of thy Flesh, which will be ready to be impatient to have the Reins held so hard.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Maintain a Spirit of Resolution and Constancy in the Ways of God,</HI> Heb. 10.38. This was the Renown of the three Worthies, <HI>Daniel</HI> 3. They feared not the Fierceness of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI> Rage, nor yet the Fire of the Furnace: All the World could not make them bow; and how gloriously did God own them, and miraculously evidence his Pleasure in them: Stand your Ground. Re∣solve to live and die by substantial Godliness. Cleave to the Lord with full Purpose of Heart. Let no Difficulties make you change your Station: Then shall you be an Honour and a Pleasure to the God that made you. Well then, would you know what Frame of Heart is pleasing to God? Why, this <HI>Humble, Sincere, Zealous Active Frame, this Be∣lieving, Meek, Self-denying, resolved Frame,</HI> this is the Frame that is well pleasing in the sight of GOD.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>As to your Performances,</HI> more briefly that those may please God, you must heedfully look to these five things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they be done by the right Rule;</HI> which is God's Word: You must not follow the Imagina∣tions of your own Hearts, <HI>Numb.</HI> 15.39. You must not do that which is right in your own Eyes; in all Sacred-Actions, you must have God's Command to warrant you. You may not offer to God of that, of which you are not able to say, <HI>Thou requirest these things at our Hands,</HI> Isa. 1.12. In all civil Actions you must have God's Allowance. Be sure he will never accept that which his Word condemns; under pain of God's Displeasure, dare not to set your Hands to what the Word forbids.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That they be done to the right End,</HI> which is <HI>God's Glory:</HI> How damnably did the <HI>Pharisees</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? How miserably did <HI>Jehu</HI> miscarry? And both in Acts for the <HI>Matter commanded,</HI> for want of aiming at this End.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="24" REF="004663_0215_100DE1E45D7726E0"/>3. <HI>That they proceed from right Principles,</HI> (1.) <HI>Faith,</HI> without which, it is impossible to please God. Prayer will not avail, except it be the Prayer of Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. We believe, and therefore we speak. (2) <HI>Love:</HI> If we should give our Goods to the Poor, and Bodies to the Fire, and not from Love, it would profit us nothing; where the slavish Fear of Hell only, or of the Lashes of Con∣science, or the Love of Man's Praise, carries Men to Duties; where any other carnal Principle is Predominant in the Act, it cannot please God. (3) <HI>Fear:</HI> We cannot serve God acceptably, with∣out Reverence and godly Fear, (no slavish Fear) The Lord <HI>taketh Pleasure in them that fear him,</HI> in them that hope in his Mercy. Observe the happy mixture; where these two are conjoyned, that is a true filial Fear, Saith <HI>David, I will come to thy House in the Multitude of thy Mercy;</HI> (Behold his Faith) <HI>and in thy Fear will I worship toward thy holy Temple;</HI> there is his Fear with Faith) <HI>Faith without Fear</HI> were bold Presumption: Fear without Faith is sin∣ful Despair; joyn them together and God is well pleased.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they may be done in a right Manner;</HI> pre∣paredly, not rashly and inconsiderately, in the Pre∣sence of so dreadful a Majesty: Prudently, for lawful Acts may be spoiled and be done unlawfully, without consideration had to the Offence that may (in some Cases) attend them; yea holy Duties as well as common Actions may be turned into Sins, by being ill timed, and for want of a due attending the present Circumstances. <HI>Holily;</HI> not <HI>rashly</HI> utter∣ing any thing with our Months before God; but behaving ourselves as in his Sight: Heartily, not feignedly with our Lips going, when our Minds are gadding.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they be directed through the right Means, that is, Jesus Christ the only Way to the Father.</HI> Bring all thy Sacrifices to the High Priest, offer all upon
<PB N="25" REF="004663_0216_100DE1E6F0955CD8"/>
this Altar, else all is lost; not that it is enough to say <HI>(Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen)</HI> at the end; but in every Duty you must come with lively de∣pendance on him for Righteousness and Strength, for Assistance and Acceptance. Remember to do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, to come leaning upon his Hand, without this, all your Services will be rejected at last.</P>

<P>For I do always those things that please him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>Qu. 1. <HI>IS any Man able in this Life to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up to the Example of Christ in this, to do always those things that please God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In Regard there is none that doth good and sinneth not, and God is not, not can be pleased with Sin, no not in his own People, but most of all hates it in them, it cannot be that any Man in this Life should fully come up to Christ's Example in this; yet may we come on so far towards it as that not only in our immediate Addresses to God, but in the general course of our Lives, we may come to please God. <HI>Thus</HI> Enoch <HI>and</HI> Noah <HI>walked with God, i. e.</HI> in their general Course they walked so as to please God, and approve themselves in his Sight: Thus the meanest of Actions, if done by us unto the Lord as the Servants of Christ, have a Promise of Acceptance and Reward, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.22.23.24.</P>
<P>Q. II <HI>How may we come in our Measure to be followers of Christ, in this, to do always those things that please God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In order to this, there is something ne∣cessary,
<PB N="26" REF="004663_0217_100DE1E9C391FC78"/>
with reference, 1. <HI>To our Persons.</HI> 2. <HI>To our Principles.</HI> 3. <HI>To our Practices.</HI> 1. <HI>With Reference to our Persons.</HI> And here it is necessary, 1. That there be an Alteration of our Natures by renewing Grace, for they that are in the Flesh cannot please God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.8.</P>
<P>These <HI>wild Vines</HI> must needs bring forth sower Grapes, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.4. The Fruit that they bear (how specious and fair soever to the Eye) is evil Fruit, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7, 16. Where there is not a good Treasure of Grace in the Heart, a Man cannot in his Actions <HI>bring forth good things,</HI> Matth. 12.36.</P>
<P>Many enlightned Sinners think by Reading and Praying, and forsaking some gross and foul Sins, to pacify God, and set all Right: Mistaken Souls, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t me undeceive you; you begin at the wrong End, your first and greatest Care must be to get your Hearts and Natures changed, and renewed by the Power of converting Grace; you labour in vain at the Streams, while the Fountain of Corruption in the Heart remains in its Strength: You must not think it is with you, as it is with a ruinous House, where the mending of here and there a little will make up all again; but the old Building must be quite taken down, and the Foundation Stone laid a-new in a sound Repentance from dead Works, and thorough Conversion unto God. Till this be done, you must know, that God hath no Pleasure in you, neither will accept an Offering at your Hand, <HI>Malachy</HI> 1.10. as he doth from those that are Friends.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there be the Acceptation of your Persons through Faith in Christ Jesus.</HI> For in him alone it is that God is well pleased, <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. last. So that <HI>without</HI> Faith interesting us in him, <HI>it is impossible to please God,</HI> Heb. 11.6.</P>
<P>For the better understanding both these Particu∣lars, know that there are two Attributes of God to which you must bear a Conformity, or else you cannot please him.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="27" REF="004663_0218_100DE1EC78E7F670"/>1. <HI>The Holiness of God:</HI> For he is not a God that hath pleasure in Iniquity: He heareth no Sinner: The Foolish shall not stand in his Sight. He ha∣teth all the workers of Iniquity, <HI>Psal.</HI> 5.4, 5. <HI>John</HI> 9.31. God can no more take Pleasure in the un∣sanctified, than we in Swine or Serpents.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Justice of God:</HI> For he will by no means clear the Guilty, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34, 7. Could we have in∣herent Holiness in us; in our unpardoned State, yet Justice could not but be infinitely offended while Guilt lieth unremoved; as you may see in Christ, for tho' he were perfectly holy, yet being under the Guilt of our Sins imputed to him, the severity of God's Justice broke out against him.</P>
<P>Now, Man being naturally an Offence both to the <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of God, there must of ne∣cessity pass upon him in order to his pleasing God, this two fold Change.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The real change of Sanctification:</HI> I call this a real change, because by this there is a real change ensuing of new Qualities and Dispositions, making him of proud, humble, of carnal, spiritual and hea∣venly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Relative Change of Justification:</HI> I call this a relative Change, because there is not a real Change in a Man's Nature, but in his Condition, making him to stand in a new Relation to the Law, with Reference to which he was before guilty and condemned, but now the Law pronounces the same Man clear and acquitted, and this not for any Righ∣teousness infused into him, but for the Satis∣faction and Payment of another laid down for him; Satisfaction there must be, and Righteousness must be tendered, or else God cannot be at Peace. We have nothing to pay, <HI>Luke</HI> 7.49. Oh Sinner, away to Christ for it; hide thee in the Clifts of that Rock; run to the Fountain opened for Sin and Uncleanness. Appear not before God, but in the Robe of Christ's Righteousness. He sends you to
<PB N="28" REF="004663_0219_100DE1EF248EB420"/>
Jesus, as he did them to <HI>Job,</HI> Chap, 42. last. <HI>Go to my Servant</HI> Job. <HI>be shall pray for you, him will I accept:</HI> Get out of yourselves: Flee to Christ, labour to be found in him, else all your Endeavours in rinsing and washing yourselves will be to no Effect.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>With Reference to our Principles.</HI> And here it is necessary that some <HI>corrupt Principles be un∣learned,</HI> and some <HI>holy Principles</HI> be <HI>received</HI> and <HI>retained.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Some corrupt Principles must be unlearned.</HI> As 1. That <HI>it is enough if we serve God on the Lord's Day, and we may serve ourselves all the rest of the Week.</HI> Tho' God hath reserved one Day in seven wholly for his immediate Service, which is therefore in a peculiar Sense called the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> yet we must know that every Day is His, and that he hath not allowed us one Hour nor Inch of Time, but only for His Service. Indeed he hath Service of <HI>more sorts than one;</HI> but we must know that the Business of our ordinary Affairs, if rightly done, is a <HI>Serving of the Lord Christ,</HI> Col. 3, 24 God is as truly served by you in the <HI>working Days Labour,</HI> as the <HI>Sabbath-days rest,</HI> if you do it in a right Manner, and to holy Ends.</P>
<P>There is a Generation whose Religion is but a <HI>Sunday's Religion,</HI> which they put on and off with their <HI>Sunday's</HI> Clothes, and then they think God is fairly served for the Week; altho' God knows, that little they do then is but poorly done neither. Never think God will accept it at thy Hands, when thou livest six Days to the World and thyself, for <HI>One</HI> that thou spendest for him. This shews thee to be under the mortified Power of Self-love, and not to be the Lord's, for none of us liveth to himself, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.7. You must remember, that you are but to learn upon the Sabbath, how to serve God all the Week; and not think when the Lord's Day is ended, his Work is done.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That if God be served Morning and Evening, it
<PB N="29" REF="004663_0220_100DE1F0A84737E0"/>
is enough,</HI> tho' we serve ourselves the rest of the Day; God must be served every Day, and all the Day, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.17. You must be serving him not only in your Feasts, but at your Meals; not only on your Knees, but in your Callings.</P>
<P>Some think that if they keep up <HI>Religious Duties,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey may do what they list at other times; that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey be Intemperate, Lascivious, Unrighteous, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but to make even again with God at Night, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l will he well: Like the Whore in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat having made her Offering, was presently ready of new Wickedness, <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.14. as if she had paid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff the old Score, and might now boldly run upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>new.</P>
<P>Others think, that tho' they may not serve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evil at any time, yet giving God his Dues Morn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g and Evening, they may serve themselves the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of the Time. But in vain do they lay claim to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, who live more to themselves than they do to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im. This will be found horrible Sacrilege to put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff God but with the Tenth. God is to be eyed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd served in all that you do; and this is that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rive at, that we may not divide ourselves between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od and the World; between his Service and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Ends, and so put him off with a Partial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervice; but that we may do all in Obedience to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, and we may be entirely the Lord's. That he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>all Things may be glorified by us,</HI> and that we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot lose our Reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some Holy Principles must be received and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined. As,</P>
<P>Pr. 1. <HI>That the pleasing of God is our only Business, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d our highest Blessedness.</HI> First. <HI>our only Business,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is it that we call or count our <HI>Business?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That is a Man's Business which his Liveli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od and Subsistence depends upon: The <HI>Lawyer</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unts his Law his Business, and the <HI>Tradesman</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unts his Trade his Business; because upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Livelihood and Subsistence depends: Bre∣thren,
<PB N="30" REF="004663_0221_100DE1F3249C96D0"/>
our Whole depends upon the <HI>Pleasing of God.</HI> Do this, and do all: Miss in this, and you marr all; please him, and you are made up for ever. If he be not pleased, you are undone for ever. How careful is the Selfish-Courtier to please his Prince? How will he crouch and Flatter? and if he can but divine what will gratify and please him, he thinks himself happy: And why? But because all his Dependance is upon his Prince's Fa∣vour; much more do we depend upon the Favour of God. <HI>Blessed is the Man whom he chooseth,</HI> Psalm 65.4. <HI>In his Favour is Life,</HI> Psalm 30.5. But wo to them that have God against them, these are per∣fectly miserable: <HI>Reprobate Silver shall Men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them,</HI> Jer. 6.30. If the Lord do but say to a Man as he did to <HI>Moses, Thou hast found Grace in my Sight, and I know thee by Name,</HI> Happy is that Man. But if he thus say, <HI>I have no Pleasure in thee,</HI> you may cover the Face of that Man, as they did <HI>Haman</HI>'s, and carry him away: Miserable must his End be, if he continue.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That is a Man's Business which he hath his Stock and Talents for.</HI> If a Man be intrusted as a Stew∣ard or a Factor, his Business is to buy in the Com∣modities that are useful. Beloved, all our Time, Parts, Interest, Food, Raiment, and whatever Mercies, Spiritual or Temporal, are the Stock wherewith God hath intrusted us, and all for his own Use and Service, And is it not a sad and fear∣ful case, that God should have so great a Stock go∣ing, as lies in the Hands of all the Sons of Men, and yet have (if I may so speak) so little profit of it? I mean so little Glory by it: That he should sow so much, and reap so little? straw so much, and gather so little: Is it not sad, that Men should have so much in vain? Hast thou Health and Wealth, and dost not use it for God? It is all in vain. Hast thou understanding, and yet improvest it but for contriving thine own Affairs, and
<PB N="31" REF="004663_0222_100DE1F5D31FD408"/>
worldly Designs? thy Reason and Understanding are become vain. Oh, how wilt thou answer it, that thou hast had so great Stock in thine Hands, and made so little Improvement of it? It had been good for some Men, if they had never had a Foot of Land, or an Hour's Ease, if they never had the Understanding of Men, because they have not used their Talents for God, and for the Ends for which they were put into their Hands.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That is a Man's Business which his Capacities do call for,</HI> It is a Man's Business if in the Capa∣city of a Judge, to do Justice, or of a Servant, to do his Master's Will: Brethren, all your Capaci∣ties do evidence it to be your Business to <HI>please God</HI> you are his Friends, you are his Servants, there¦fore you must <HI>please him well in all Things,</HI> Titus 2.9. His Children, and therefore must set yourselves to <HI>honour him.</HI> Malachi 1.6. His Spouse, and therefore it is your Business to <HI>please your Husbands,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.34.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That is a Man's Business which he hath his Maintenance for.</HI> If a Man be maintained in the Place of a School master, it is his Business to teach; If of a Soldier, it is his Business to fight. Belov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do you not know at whose Feeding you are: And do you think God keeps so many Servants to be idle, or to mind their own Designs and Pleasures? God hath cut you out every one his Work, every Man his Hands full: So much work is to be done within Doors, and so much without Doors: So much towards God, towards your Neighbour, towards your own selves, that you have no Time to be idle in. And you shall dearly reckon for it, if you will eat his Bread, and will not do his Work. And as pleasing God is our chiefest Business,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> So it is also our highest Blessedness: For Man's Happiness lies in God's Favour, <HI>Psalm</HI> 4.6. Our Happiness is in attaining the End of our Being, and therefore the great Query amongst
<PB N="32" REF="004663_0223_100DE1F911BBB7F8"/>
the Philosophers still was, <HI>What was the End or the Happiness of Man?</HI> now the true End of our Be∣ing is, that we may please God: <HI>for his Pleasure we are and were created</HI> Rev. 4.11. And for this End also we are <HI>new created,</HI> that we should yield ourselves unto God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.13. and being <HI>built up a spiritual House, should offer up to him spi∣ritual Sacrifice acceptable through Christ,</HI> 1 Peter 2.5. This is the End of our <HI>Redemption,</HI> that we should serve not ourselves, <HI>but him in Holiness and Righ∣teousness all the Days of our Lives.</HI> Luke 2.75. <HI>And that we should not henceforth live to ourselves, but to him that died for us,</HI> 2 Cor 5.15. 'T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the End likewise of our Justification, that our Consciences being purged, we should acceptably serve the liv∣ing God. In a word, 'tis the End of our Glorifica∣tion, that being translated into Heaven, we should perfectly <HI>please God,</HI> and serve him Night and Day in his <HI>Temple,</HI> Rev. 7.15. and 22.3. So that the Pleasing of God, is the whole End or whole Happi∣ness of Man, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. And this will be clear, be∣cause <HI>we do then promote ourselves most, when we please God best.</HI> For by this you shall have this two-fold Advantage.</P>
<P>First, <HI>You shall be the Favourite of God.</HI> O glo∣rious Promotion! <HI>Haman</HI> thought himself no lit∣tle Man when he was on <HI>Ahafuerus</HI> Right-Hand, and yet he was at length but preferred to the Gal∣lows, <HI>Esther</HI> 5.11. and 7.10. But what shall be done to the Man whom God delights to honour? O blessed is that Man! wo be to him that toucheth him: <HI>It had been better for him that a Milstone had been hanged about his Neck, and drowned in the midst of the Sea,</HI> than that he should offend such a one, <HI>Luke</HI> 17.2. God is infinitely chary of his Favourites. The Apple of his Eye is touched when they are injured, <HI>Zech.</HI> 2.8. <HI>Whosoever touch∣eth them shall not be innocent,</HI> Psal. 107.15. God hath a Blessing for these that shew them Kindness, <HI>Gen.</HI> 12.3. He will render Vengeance upon the un∣godly
<PB N="33" REF="004663_0224_100DE1FA959F08C0"/>
for every <HI>hard Speech</HI> they utter against them, <HI>Jude</HI> 15.</P>
<P>O Man, doth not thy Soul say, <HI>Happy is the Peo∣ple that is in such a Case;</HI> Will not thy Condition be most blessed, when God shall be thus infinitely tender of thee, to take all the Kindnesses done to thee, as done to himself? <HI>Matth</HI> 25.45. And all the Injuries done to thee, as Affronts to himself, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.4. This is the happy Case of his Favou∣rites.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Every thing you do shall be found upon your Account with God.</HI> Brethren, are you Belie∣vers, or are you not? Do you believe the Im∣mortality of the Soul, and the Life to come, or do you not? the Ways of the most do de∣clare them to be real Infidels, tho' professed Chris∣tians. If you think there be an Eternal State to come, will it not be your highest Wisdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be providing for it, and laying up what possible you can, that you may inherit it in the other World. Will not every wise Man, that knows, he is shortly to be removed into ano∣ther Country, be careful to transport all that he can, that he may enjoy it at his coming? Belov∣ed, if you do believe indeed, that you must be for∣ever in another World, will it not be your best course to be doing that, the Fruit whereof you shall enjoy forever? Were not he a Mad man, that having but a very short Term upon a Living, should yet go to building and planting there, when he had Land of Inheritance to build upon? Infi∣nite is the Mischief that comes of <HI>Self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeking</HI> and <HI>Self-pleasing.</HI></P>
<P>You are eternal Losers by it: God will say, <HI>You have your Reward,</HI> Matth. 6.5. Something you may have in Hand, but the <HI>Eternal Reward</HI> is lost. Brethren, I am ambitious for you that what you do, you <HI>should</HI> do for ever, that all should meet you in the other World, and that there you should reap the Everlasting Fruit of what
<PB N="34" REF="004663_0225_100DE1FDD7B949B8"/>
you are doing now. A wise Builder will build forever, and not only that <HI>which</HI> shall last for a Day, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a Year. O that you would be wise Builders. Do all for God, and you shall <HI>have</HI> eter∣nal Advantage. Learn but this Lesson, <HI>To set your selves in all things to please God, and you will be promoting and advancing yourselves in all that ever you do, always laying up a Treasure in Heaven, still adding to the Heap.</HI> And O what Riches will you come to, <HI>when</HI> by every Day and every Hour, and every Action you are Gainers? For God will not let the least thing that is done for him, no not a Cup of cold Water, go without an everlasting Reward, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.42. nor your Labour be in vain, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.58.</P>
<P>Pr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>That when you have done all, if God be not pleased, you have done nothing.</HI> Settle it upon your Hearts, that all is in vain that is not done for God: when <HI>you</HI> do not please God, you do not profit yourselves. When Men offer never so richly and freely, if not in such a manner as is pleasing to God, all is but a vain Oblation, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.13. If Men will do more than ever God required, and be zealous in Things that God hath not com∣manded, 'tis but in <HI>vain that they Worship him,</HI> Matth. 15.9. Beloved, so much time as <HI>you</HI> have lived to yourselves, you have lived in vain, be∣cause it was quite besides your End. O it is a Heart-cutting Consideration to a tender Christian to think of this, that when his Life is so short, and Time so little in all, yet he must be fain to cut off so much! Why Man, so many Hours must thou cut off from thy Days, and so many Years from thy Life, as thou hast lived not to God, but to thyself; they are all lost as to the Ends of Life and Time. If on Repentance thou be forgiven, thou art not <HI>rewarded</HI> for them.</P>
<P>Beloved, you must count that you have lived no longer than you have lived unto God, <HI>Philip.</HI> 1.21. <HI>To me to live is Christ,</HI> I should account I did not
<PB N="35" REF="004663_0226_100DE2024D90E298"/>
live, if I did not live to him! 'Tis the only Em∣ployment of my Life to serve him. I should not tell what to do with my Life, unless it were to spend it for him.</P>
<P>Christian, Thus thou must reckon: So much Time as I have li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to Christ, so much have I lived; and so much as I have lived to myself, so much I have lost. 'Tis not the <HI>Man</HI> but the <HI>Beast</HI> that lives, while we live below our Reason, which distinguishes the <HI>Human Life</HI> from that of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes.</HI> Now while we live not to God, we live utterly below our Reason it self, which is sufficiently discovered, in that God is the Author and End of Man. Doth not <HI>Reason</HI> dictate that GOD should have the Glory of his own Work, and the Vessel should be to the Potter's Use? Doth any plant a Vineyard, or keep a Flock, and not expect the Fruits or Milk? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7. GOD hath made thee, O Man, <HI>for himself.</HI> Prov. 16.4. And hast thou the Face of a Man, and dost not blush at this, to think that God should make and maintain thee in vain? If thou hast one Grain of Ingenuity, thou wilt abhor the thought of this, that thou shouldst be in vain. Why, so much as thou art for thy self, thou art for nothing. It may be thou livest a very busy Life; but thou actest not for God, thou art all this while but busily doing nothing. Thou mayest set down in the Evening, and say, I have been all this Day doing nothing. <HI>Thou</HI> wilt find a blank in God's Book for that Day, nothing upon thine Account: on this sad Record such a Day spent and nothing done. God hath his Day-book, and takes Notice of all your Carriages, how you rise, and how you go forth to your Labours: how you speak, how you eat, and whether you eye him and his Glory, in all, or look no higher than yourselves, <HI>Luke</HI> 5.5. <HI>We have been toiling all Night, and caught no∣thing.</HI> May not this be the sad Cōmplaint of many a Man? I have been toiling all my Life, and ye
<PB N="36" REF="004663_0227_100DE203D2932468"/>
I have done nothing, because what I did was not done unto the Lord. How would you take it of your Servants, if coming home in the Evening, you should find every one of them minding their own Business and Pleasure, and your Work left un∣done. Is it not sad, Sirs, that so many Hours and Days should pass over us, and we no nearer our End than ever we were before? Your little Chil∣dren are busie from Morning to Night, and yet all the while have been doing nothing: And so are you, when you are but seeking your carnal Selves, and not serving and pleasing God in what you undertake.</P>
<P>Pr. <HI>That the Favour of all the World can no∣thing stead you, if God be not pleased with you, and by you.</HI> If there were any that could save you from his Wrath, you need not be so so licitous to please him, but if he be not pleased, we are all undone. <HI>Thou, even thou, art to be feared, and who shall stand when once thou art angry?</HI> Psalm 79.7. Isa. 43.13. When Men have flight thoughts of God's anger, and the Fear and Dread of him is not upon their Hearts, no wonder if they be not, careful to please him. You must be convincede that the displeasure of God is the most formidabln thing in the World, or else you will never leare this great Lesson. Beloved, if you should pleas, Men, and all the World should be on your side what would this avail while God is your Enemy? If all Men should bless you, and speak well of you, what would this profit, when God should rise up in Judgment against you, and condemn you? It is nor at Man's Bar, but God's that you must stand: It is not at Men's Votes that you must be cast or quitted: It will not go by most Voices, but God himself is the Judge, <HI>Psal.</HI> 75.7. In his Breast it is, whether you shall live or die: If a Man were upon a Trial for his Life, what would it avail him, that all his Fellow-prisoners, and the whole Croud about him, were for him, when the
<PB N="37" REF="004663_0228_100DE2070D2CF0A8"/>
whole Bench and Jury were against him? If your Lives and Estates were in Question, to whom would you go to make your Friend? The Judge of the People? Sirs, be convinced, that if God be against you, it's as bad as if God and all the World were against you, for all signifies nothing without him. Oh, whatever you do, study to get in, and keep in with him; I tell you, the Time is coming, when the Breath of Men will signify nothing; when their Condemnation will do you no good, O Man! though all the World should give thee their Hands, and subscribe thy Certificate, it should signify nothing in God's Ac∣count, or his Court. Many build their Hopes for Heaven upon the good Opinion that others have of them; But I tell thee, Man, though thou couldst carry Letters of Commendation with thee when thou diest, and all the Ministers of the Gospel should give thee their <HI>Bene decessit,</HI> all would be no more than a Blank-paper, and he would not save thee a Jot the sooner, if he should find thee to have been but a secret Hypocrite, a rotten hearted Professor all the while.</P>
<P>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 5 <HI>That God would not be pleased with you in any Thing, except you make it your Care to please him well in every Thing.</HI> You will be one Day ashamed, except you have Respect to all God's Commandments, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.6. You have not a good Conscience, except it be your Care in all Things to live honestly, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.18. If <HI>Naaman</HI> must be excused in one Thing, to bow in the House of <HI>Rimmon,</HI> that he might not displease his Master, this is enough to spoil every thing, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 5.18. Some will needs keep God's Good-will, and the World's too, and so will give both their turn; they will serve God at home, and conform to the World abroad; and it shall be a great thing indeed that they will not swallow, rather than lose the Good-will of Men, especially great Men. These Men have two Faces, and two Tongues; the one of
<PB N="38" REF="004663_0229_100DE208ACA86B38"/>
the Good and the other for the bad Company that they come into. Some held two <HI>first Principles,</HI> the one the common Fountain of all Good (which is God) and the other the Cause of all Evil, and they worshipped both, the good Principle for Love, and the evil for Fear. Just such a Religion are many among us now of. But let them know, who∣ever they are, that while they grasp all, they lose all: For God will never own Time-servers, nor Men-pleasers, for the Servants of Christ, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.6. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>With Reference to your Practices.</HI> And here as ever you desire to come to this blessed Life of doing always those Things that please God, you must carefully follow these six Rules.</P>
<P>Rule 1. <HI>Look round about you to the whole Lati∣tude and Compass of your Duty.</HI> Great is the La∣titude of Christianity: <HI>the Commandment is exceed∣ing broad,</HI> Psalm 119.96. And many Professors do scarce look more than one Way, but while they intensly mind one Thing, they neglect another. It may be while they are taken up with the Care of religious Duties, they forget relative Duties: or they are careful of personal Duties, but very remiss in the Duties that they owe to the Souls of their Families; or they complain and mourn over their own Sins, but lay not to heart other Sins: It may be they are more punctual in their more immediate Duties towards God, but are very negligent in their Duties towards Men; or they will spend much time for their Souls, but do little lay to heart the Case of the Church, and the Misery of perishing Souls that are round about them; possibly they keep the Sabbath strictly, and pray and hear, and fear an Oath, but in the mean Time make little Conscience of breaking their Promises, passing hasty and uncharitable Censures, spending time vainly, being unprofitable in their Discourse, close-handed to godly uses; suffering Sin to go unreproved; let∣ting out their Passion at every petty Cross. Many
<PB N="39" REF="004663_0230_100DE20C99C09B08"/>
will mind their Duty to them that are within, and in the the mean Time are very short in their Duties to them that are without: This is too common a Case. Where is the Christian almost that seriously bethinks himself, what might I do to win Souls? It may be you will go on in the Company of the Godly where you may be edified, but when do you go to your poor Neighbour, whom you see to live in a sinful State, and tell him of his Danger, and Labour to gain him to Christ, Yea, so much is this great Duty neglected and out of Fashion, that I am afraid, many question whether it be a Duty or no. As if you might let Sin lye upon the Soul of your Brother, and yet be innocent, <HI>Lev</HI> 19.17. If it were but his Ox or Ass that lay ready to perish, you would make no question but it were your Duty to help him out of the Ditch: And do you think in earnest that you owe more to these than you do to his Soul? Is it to Ministers only, or to all Believers that Scripture belongs <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.30. <HI>The Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life, and he that winneth Souls is wise.</HI> Surely the Lives of too many Christians do speak the same Language that <HI>Cain</HI> spake with his Mouth. <HI>Am I my Brother's Keeper?</HI> Gen. 4.9. 'Tis true, God will have you keep every one within the Bounds of your proper Stations, but so as to take Occasions, yea, to seek Occasions, as you are able, to be doing good to others. Do you not know how to get within your poor Neighbours? carry an Alms with you, do him a Kindness. oblige him by your courteous and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning Carriage. Then I shall look to see the Kingdom of Christ flourish gloriously, when every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at professeth Godliness, shall arise and take ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Skirt of his Neighbour. Oh see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Night<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this, do not think it enough to keep your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Vineyard; Let your Friends and Neighbours have no quiet for you, till you see them setting in good earnest to seek after Heaven. Oh if you might bring in but every

one his Man to Christ, what a blessed thing were this, I lose myself in this A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gument, but I am content to do so, this Duty being so miserably ne∣glected.</P>
<P>Too many live as if Religion lay all in praying and hearing, holy Conference, and the like, for∣getting that pure Religion and undefiled is this, <HI>To visit the Fatherless and the Widow in their af∣flictions,</HI> James 1.17. The other should be so done, as that this should not be left undone. You make Conscience of being just and true, and faith∣ful, but do you not forget to win upon others by your Kindness and Affableness? As if it were not written in your BIBLES: <HI>Be pitiful, be courteous, having Compassion one of another,</HI> 1 Peter 3.8. Say not, it is not my Nature? What doth Grace serve for, but to correct the Evils of your Temper? Is not ours a Religion of Self-denial? Do not the Rules of our Religion enjoyn us to be followers of whatsoever is lovely and of good Report, and may render Religion amiable to the World? <HI>Phil</HI> 4.8.</P>
<P>Rule II. <HI>Use a wise Fore cast, that every Duty may fall in its Time and Order, and every Work may have its Room.</HI> It is not enough to do God's Work, but it must be done in his Order. That which in itself is good and necessary, may be so ill-timed, as to become a Sin: It is a Duty to tell your Bro∣ther of his Sin: But to rip up in your Passion, or to be retorting upon him when he is Christianly admonishing you, is a Sin. Your worldly Business must not shut out Religion, nor religious Duties take you so up, as to neglect your Callings, but every Duty must have its Place. But for the doing all in God's Order, take these five <HI>Direc∣tions.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. I. <HI>Begin at Home in provoking to good.</HI> Why should God plead with you? <HI>Thou that teachest another, Teacheth thou not thyself?</HI> Rom. 2.21. Be an Example of thine own Rule, else the
<PB N="41" REF="004663_0232_100DE2109BE40B90"/>
Hypocrites Charge will come in against thee, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.4. <HI>They bind heavy Burdens, but evill not touch them with one of their Fingers.</HI> Observe God's Order, <HI>Deut</HI> 6.6, 7. <HI>These Words which I command thee, shall be in thine Heart.</HI> That must be our first Care. And then having got our Lesson well ourselves, we must then teach it to others. <HI>And thou shalt teach them diligently to thy Children, and tell of them what thou,</HI> &amp;c. At least if thou hast not already attained it, be sure to learn with the first; and when thou pressest a Duty, intend thyself first, and speak most to thine own Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In reproving Evil;</HI> otherwise thou wilt be branded for an Hypocrite, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7 5. <HI>First cast the Beam out of thine own Eye.</HI> We may not think, as many do mistakenly, that we must not reprove another when we are guilty of the same Sin: But we must in such a Case be sure to cast the first Stone at ourselves. Be soonest angry with thyself, and more severe to thine own Sins, than any others. 'Tis strange to see the great Censoriousness of Pro∣fessors to others, and how tender they are of their own Corruptions, and impatient of Reproof. Rea∣der, fear and avoid this Sin.</P>
<P>Direct. 2 <HI>Let God be first served.</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t God have the first of thy Thoughts, the first of the Day, the first of thy Strength: How heavily is God displeased with the prophane Priests, because they will serve themselves first with Sacrifices be∣fore him, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.15, 16. And it is the Holy Council that one gives, hold the Door of thy Heart fast against the World in the Morning, till thy Heart hath been first in Heaven, and seasoned and fortified from thence, against the Temptations that thou art like to meet with as soon as thou comest down below. Indeed, all must be done as God's Service, but so as that his immediate Service must be done first. It is the Council of several Hea∣thens, <HI>That all undertakings should be begun with Prayer.</HI> Saith <HI>Arra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, let us begin with God.</HI> And
<PB N="42" REF="004663_0233_100DE213C959AD40"/>
the very <HI>Mahometons</HI> began their Books always as Men do use to do their Wills, <HI>In the Name of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. III. <HI>First, cleanse the Inside,</HI> Matth. 23.26 Cleanse first that which is within the Cup. Tho' they are much out that live as if all their Work were within Door, yet remember that it lies chiefly here. It's a most preposterous Course in Religion, to begin first with the Outside, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4.14. O Jerusalem, <HI>wash thine Heart!</HI> When once this is done, Reformation will soon follow in the Life: but not otherwise: Many are careful that all that appears to Men should be beautiful, but their Hearts are neglected. These carry upon them the Marks of the Hypocrite, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.27.28. And what will it profit thee, O vain Man, to have all kept secret from Men, since God knows and detects thee? And hath appointed a Day wherein he will rip open thy Pack, and anatomize thy Heart before the World, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.5. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2 16.</P>
<P>Direct. IV. <HI>Eye those Duties most that are of most Importance,</HI> Matth 22.23. The Hypocrite is very punctual in lesser Matters, but neglects the weightiest Things of the Law, Judgment and Mercy, and Faith. He is for a Religion, that will cost him little: And therefore Words being good cheap, he will be forward in talk as a mighty Zealot in Circumstantials of Religion, and marve∣lous censorious of others that come not up to his Mind, as Men of wide Principles and large Con∣sciences: But in the mean time he is very negligent in secret Duties, a great Stranger to Self-denial, and walking humbly with God. He strains won∣derfully at a Ceremony? But it may be he can swallow the Gains of Unrighteousness, or the Baits of Intemperance fast enough. It may be he will decry Superstition, and never want a Stone to fling at a prophane Church-man: But in the mean time walks loosly in his Family, makes little Conscience
<PB N="43" REF="004663_0234_100DE217E6FC9358"/>
of his Dealings, or will take up his Cups as freely as another, so he be not drunk. Or if he will not take a Penny of his Neighbour's Estate, he is most unmerciful to his good Name, and will take up any Report that is going. Brethren, you must make Conscience of the least Sin and of the least Duty. But it is a fearful Sign when Men are zealous against lesser Sins, and yet connive at greater, as these are, <HI>Matth.</HI> 20.24.</P>
<P>Direct. V. <HI>Take the first Opportunity when God gives a fit season for any Duty.</HI> Let not Satan be∣guile you, by telling you of another or better Time. It may be thou hast a Purpose to reprove thy Bro∣ther for his Sin, but how long wilt thou be a Pur∣posing? Now God gives thee an Opportunity, it may be thy backward Heart saith, <HI>[not now, but another time.]</HI> And so it is put off, till he or thy∣self are removed, or he is hardned, or at least thou art guilty of the Sin that he commits in the mean while; because thou hast not done thy Duty to prevent it. It is in thine Heart to deal with thine unconverted Friend or Neighbour about his spiritual Estate, but it may be while thou art delaying, Death comes and snatches him away in his Sins, or takes thee off, and so farewell for ever to any Op∣portunity for doing the Soul of thy Brother any good. How often are our Closet Duties hindred or miserably disturbed, for want of Care to lay hold on the first Opportunity? We think another Hour in the Day may do as well, but then one thing or another unexpectedly falls in, that nothing is done, or nothing to purpose. Therefore beware of this Cheat. A Man scarce peeps into the World, but one Briar or Thorn, or another will catch him. Therefore, take Opportunity by the Fore-top. Our Saviour would take his Season for Prayer before Day, when his other Work was pressing, <HI>Mark</HI> 1.35.</P>
<P>Rule III. <HI>Do nothing of Things Sacred without
<PB N="44" REF="004663_0235_100DE21A83BAE138"/>
GOD's Command: Nothing in Things civil without God's Allowance.</HI> Offer not with strange Fire; In God's Worship you must see you be well able to answer that Question, <HI>Who hath required these Things at your Hands?</HI> Here the Command must be observed, without adding or diminishing, <HI>Deut.</HI> 12.32, yet understanding this with Two Cautions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho' Men may not stamp their invented Cere∣monies with a moral Signification, nor impose, nor use them, tho' with good Intentions of edifying the People by devised Means, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.2. as if Christ had not sufficiently provided for the edyfying his People without their Devises. And tho' nothing may be used as a Part of Worship that God hath not commanded, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.23. (for it is enough to make any thing rejected of the Lord of divine Worship, if he shall say, <HI>I commanded it not, spake it not, neither came it into my Mind,</HI>) Jeremiah 7.31 and 19.5. Yet nevertheless those things that are merely circumstantial, and are in their general kind necessary, and not intended as any Part or Means of Worship, may be determined of by humane Prudence, according to the general Rules of the Word) which must always be observed, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.26 42. And for want of Understand∣ing, many have ignorantly condemned Preaching by an Hour-glass, in a high Place, in Churches, by way of Doctrine and Use, &amp;c. running from the one Extream to another.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may not think that God's Ordinanee re∣maining for substance may be forsaken, because of some Faults of the Administrators, or in the Way of their Administration. The Administring of God's Ordinanees belong not to the People, but to the Minister:: And if he fail in his Duty by Ad∣ministering them in a way that is not, and is less edyfying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B.</NOTE> it is my Grief, but his Sin. <HI>Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas</HI> were corrupt in their Lives, and brought in much Corruption
<PB N="45" REF="004663_0236_100DE21D2A7E24B0"/>
and Rudeness into the Service of God. Yet <HI>El∣kannah</HI> and <HI>Hannah,</HI> with others of the Godly, did nevertheless attend God's Worship and Sanctuary, 1 <HI>Samuel</HI> 1.2 much Corruption was crept in, both into the Doctrine and Worship, and Lives of the Administrators of the Church of the Jews.<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B.</NOTE> Yet our Saviour (though he still cry'd down the Corruptions, and would not join in them) never prohibited Communion with them in God's Worship, but enjoins it, <HI>Matthew</HI> 5.24. <HI>Mark</HI> 4. <HI>Luke</HI> 5 4. and practise it, both he, and his Parents, and Apostles, <HI>Luke</HI> 2.21, 22, 24, 39, 41, 46 <HI>Acts</HI> 21.23, 24, 26</P>
<P>But now, in Things civil, it is sufficient, that you have the Allowance of the Word, though not the Commands, always provided, that the general Rules he here observed, <HI>to do all to the Glory of God,</HI> 1 Cor. 10.31. And not to abuse our lawful Li∣berty to the Offence of others, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.2. Now your Actions being thus justifiable, as to the Mat∣ter of them (without which it is impossible, had you never so good Intentions to please God) the Influence and Virtue of holy Ends into them will be effectual, as to turn all into religious Duties, as the Touch of the Philosophers-Stone turns the baser Metal into Gold.</P>
<P>Rule IV. <HI>In every Action let God be uppermost, but in religious Actions, let God be All.</HI> Let none of your Actions terminate in yourselves, but labour to be able in Sincerity, to give this Account of any Thing you set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that this you do, because it is pleasing un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause this is his Will concern∣ing you. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon this Caution. Beware in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Actions wherein Self may bear a Part, lest it should sweep Stakes and carry all. You may in you common Actions have an Eye to your outward Commodity, and comfortable Being in the World; but this must not be the chief Thing, much less the All that you design herein: For by looking no higher than Self, you incur this double
<PB N="46" REF="004663_0237_100DE21F8B81A9D8"/>
Mischief. 1. You lose so much from your own Account. 2. You usurp upon the great Preroga∣tives of God. I fear we are not aware of the fear∣ful Evil that is in <HI>Self-seeking;</HI> It is no less than jostling God beside the Throne, and setting our∣selves in his Room. It is God's great Prerogative, and the proper Worship that is due to Him as GOD, that he should be the last End of all the Operations of us his Creatures, and that all our Motions should terminate in him. Now, when we eye our <HI>own Commodity,</HI> and <HI>not God,</HI> and look to this more than unto GOD, we arrogate the Divine Prerogative to ourselves, and set ourselves above him, which is no less than heinous Idolatry. And if it be such an heinous Sin to bow down to an Image, which is but the giving God's <HI>outward Worship</HI> to the Creature, how much more to seek and honour ourselves before <HI>GOD,</HI> which is to give his inward Worship? which of all is the Prin∣cipal, to the Creature: Oh! how many, that pass for good Christians, will be found heinous Idola∣ters? Because they have sought their own carnal Ends more than <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Glory.</HI> And many real Christians, tho' they mainly design <HI>GOD</HI> and his <HI>Glory; yet,</HI> in many particular Actions, contract great Guilt, by <HI>looking</HI> no higher than themselves in what they <HI>do.</HI> I know <HI>you cannot</HI> be always thinking of <HI>God,</HI> yet I would have <HI>you</HI> never to forget what <HI>you</HI> have been taught; in the En∣trance of every <HI>solemn Action,</HI> to remember. <HI>GOD,</HI> and make him your End. Lie down in the Name of <HI>GOD</HI> every Evening: Go f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Name every Morning, resolving to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtake All <HI>for</HI> him. When <HI>you</HI> enter upon <HI>your Callings,</HI> sit down at <HI>your Meals,</HI> make any Journey or Visit, do it as unto the LORD, with Design to please him therein. This <HI>you</HI> may come to, with Care and Watchfulness.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>In religious Actions let God be All.</HI> Here <HI>Self (I meane carnal Self)</HI> must be shut out, otherwise
<PB N="47" REF="004663_0238_100DE22250602768"/>
this dead Fly will spoil the Box of most precious Ointment. 'Tis true, <HI>self</HI> will be crowding in, but you must knock it down carefully; otherwise, if this be the predominant Ingredient, all your Du∣ties will be but lost Labour. What is more pleasing to God than Prayer? This is <HI>Incense</HI> before him, <HI>Psalm</HI> 1.1, 2. What more delightful than <HI>Alms?</HI> This is a Sacrifice acceptable and well pleasing unto him, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.8. How happy a Testimony had <HI>Conelius? Thy Prayers and Alms are come up as a Memorial before God,</HI> Acts 10.4. Yet when <HI>Self</HI> is predominant in those Duties, <HI>Prayers, Alms,</HI> &amp;c. are all Lost, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.7. and 23.5.</P>
<P>Rule V. <HI>When you have done all, be careful to deny all,</HI> Luke 7.10. or not deny God's Mercy in en∣abling and assisting you. This must be with all Thankfulness observed: But attributing Nothing to yourselves, and giving God all the Glory. Take the Pattern of holy <HI>David,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.14. <HI>But who am I, and what is my People, that we should offer so willingly?</HI> Of thine own have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given thee, [And of blessed <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10. <HI>Not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.</HI>] And of good <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> who when he had done most eminent Service for God, flies at last for pardoning Mercy, <HI>Nehem.</HI> 13.22. <HI>Remember me, O God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the Greatness of thy Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Rule VI. <HI>Do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> Col. 3.17. Having carefully set out for God in the Morning, and directed your common Actions to <HI>Him</HI> as <HI>your End</HI> throughout the Day, doing all in his Sight, and with a Desire to please him there∣in, bring all to Christ in the Evening, and present all unto God by him, confidently expecting God's Acceptance and Reward for all that you have done. For this he hath promised, be your Actions never so mean, <HI>because they were done as his Service,</HI> Col. 5 21, 23, 24. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.6, 7, 8. If you neglect this, you lose all at last: For God will accept of no
<PB N="48" REF="004663_0239_100DE2250FF7FB70"/>
Sacrifice but from the hand of the <HI>Priest,</HI> and therefore you must look for no Acceptance with God, nor any reward from him, but only through, Christ, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5 <HI>John</HI> 14.6. You must be sure therefore not only to make a formal Mention of Christ's Name, but to build all your Hope of Suc∣cess only upon him, and to come to GOD, with an actual and lively dependance upon him.</P>
<P>Thus I have resolved the Case propounded, I will but answer an Objection, and briefly press your Duty by some Motives, and so con∣clude.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> You bind heavy Burdens; What must we be always in the traces? Surely this Severity of Religion is more than needs.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Burden Man! why, it is thy Happi∣ness. If Holiness and pleasing God be a Burden, Health is a Burden, Heaven and Happiness are Burdens.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 2.

Dispute not against God, but up and be doing It is an ill Sign when the Heart rises against the Strictness of the Duty: You utterly mistake in thinking this Life of Strictness to be a Bondage. Who have Joy unspeakable and full of Glory? Who do know the Peace that passeth all Understanding, if not those that do thus walk with GOD?</P>
<P>Now, my Brethren, let me beseech you to be the conscientious Practitioners of this great Lesson. Study to do always those Things that are <HI>pleasing unto God.</HI> Oh that I knew, how but to engage you; that I co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but get you to set these Rules before you, all the Days of your Lives, for your Practice! 'Tis not enough that you give the Hearing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Preacher, and approve the Doctrine. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what will you do?

What say you Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, will you learn with me? O that I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad you on to a thorough Acquaintance with the St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness and Power of Religion, and that holy Frame that will be <HI>God's Delight,</HI> and your <HI>Felicity.</HI> Brethren, what seek I for? God knows this is my Ambition, that I may but help you on in the way of Holiness. I would not that you should be such bad Proficients as to be always of the lower Form, and keep on merely in a dull and barren Course: My Desire for you is, that you should not be Shrubs, but Cedars of tall Growth, choice Experience, singular Com∣munion, walking with God, shining to the Con∣viction of the World. Will you let me but prevail with you in so good a Design? Why should you mourn at the last and say, <HI>How have I hated Instruc∣tion and my Heart despised Reproof? I have not obeyed the Voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine Ears to them that instructed me,</HI> Prov. 4.11, 12, 13. That I may invite you to this holy Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consider,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>It is very possible: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God is very easy to be pleased:</HI> He is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ward Master that
<PB N="50" REF="004663_0241_100DE22917ACC698"/>
cannot, that will not be pleased. If you do but make it your Study and your Care to please him, and throughly set your Hearts to it, you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> willing Mind shall be accepted, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.12. And tho' you should not go through with the Work, God will say, <HI>Thou didst well that it was in thy Heart,</HI> 2 Chr. 6.8. When the <HI>Heart is set</HI> to please the Lord, and we do unfeignedly put to it, tho' there be very many Failings, God will overlook them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 30.18, 19, 20.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> God hath told you what will please him, and hath cut out your Work to your Hand. You need not say, <HI>Wherewith shall we come before the Lord? He hath shewed you what is good, and what he requireth of you,</HI> Mic 6.6, 7, 8. You need not say, <HI>Who shall ascend into Heaven to bring down the Mind of God from Heaven?</HI> No, <HI>the Word is nigh you,</HI> Rom. 10.6, 7, 8. God hath set before you in his Law, as in a Table, on one Side the Things that please; on the other, those that displease him. Oh, that ye may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound among those that chuse the <HI>Things that please him,</HI> Isa. 56.4, 5. Otherwise since <HI>you know your Master's Will, and do it not,</HI> you will be found worthy of <HI>many Stripes,</HI> Luke 12.47.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> God hath given particular Rules for the doing of all your Work in that manner that will <HI>please him.</HI> Had God told you only what must be done, and not how it must be done, you might have been at a Loss: But he hath prescribed the very Manner how every Thing must be done, that you might have full Directio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Romans</HI> 12.8. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 4.1. He hath shewed yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou must pray, and hear, and give Alms: How y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must carry it in all your Relations. He hath told you not only how you must fast, but how you must ear, <HI>to wit,</HI> with Watchfulness and Temperance, not as those who have Nothing to do, but to fill their Paunches; but with an Eye to his Glory, as those that are feeding and refreshing the Servants of JESUS CHRIST. He hath shewed you, not only how you should <HI>rest
<PB N="51" REF="004663_0242_100DE22C8073BCE8"/>
on the Lord's Day,</HI> but how you must follow your Calling on the rest, <HI>to wit,</HI> with Diligence and Discretion, minding him as your End, as those that herein serve the LORD CHRIST. He hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old you, how you must manage your Dealings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Equity and Charity, doing the very same to others, that your Consciences tell you, you would have them in the like Case to do unto you: How you must sleep, even as those that know he compasseth your Path, and your lying down, and how you must awake, <HI>to wit,</HI> so as to be still with him.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>God hath given you special Helps to this End. You have the Mind of Christ,</HI> 1 Corinthians 2.16. And you have the <HI>Spirit of Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.12. Indeed, <HI>they that are in the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h cannot please GOD.</HI> But <HI>you are not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.8, 9. You that are Believers, have not the Law only in <HI>your Bibles,</HI> but in <HI>your Hearts,</HI> Heb. 8.16.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>It is very profitable Glorious Advantages shall you have by this Course. First,</HI> This is the most speedy and certain Way to <HI>Assurance,</HI> for Want of which many of you complain; but henceforth you most complain no more: For either you will follow this Course, and then you will have it: Or you will not, and then cease your hypocritical Complaints, when it is through your own wilful Disobedience that you are without. When once you are habituated to this Course, and do find it to be the Chief of your Care, and that which your very Hearts are set upon above all Things else, to <HI>glorify and please God, and approve your selves in his Sight,</HI> you cannot want Assu∣rance, unless through your own Ignorance: For this is the most undoubted Evidence in the World, that you are the Children of God, whatever unallowed Failings you may be guilty of.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Hereby you shall be certain of God's gracious and favourable Presence always with you: See the Text, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that sent me is with me, for I do always those Things that please him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="004663_0243_100DE23000A89440"/><HI>Thirdly,</HI> By this means you shall be always laying up a Treasure in Heaven. Brethren, <HI>What are you for?</HI> Are you Men for Eternity, or are you for present Things? Is your Design for Glory, Honour and Immortality? Are you for Riches in the other World? Or, of Dung hill Spirit, preferring your Part in <HI>Paris,</HI> before your Part in <HI>Paradise:</HI> If you are for True Riches, here is your Way: By this you shall be daily and hourly increasing the Stock of your own Glory. My Vehemency is only that Fruit may abound to your account, that all you do might meet you in Heaven, and CHRIST may shew your good Works another Day, as the Widows did <HI>Dorcas</HI> her Garments, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.39.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> A Fourth <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Conscience.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>WHat Weariness in, and Unwillingness to Duties, may stand with Grace, and what not?</HI> For the Resolving this, some Distinctions must be premised, and then some Conclusions elicited.</P>
<P><HI>Distinction.</HI> This <HI>Weariness</HI> and <HI>Unwillingness</HI> must be distinguished, 1. According to the <HI>Degrees</HI> of it, and so it is either <HI>Partial</HI> and <HI>Gradual,</HI> or else <HI>Prevalent</HI> and <HI>Plenary.</HI> 2. According to the <HI>Subject</HI> of it: And so this <HI>Weariness</HI> is either of the <HI>Mem∣bers,</HI> or else of the <HI>Mind.</HI> 3. According to the <HI>Prevalency</HI> of it; and so it is either <HI>transient</HI> and <HI>occasional,</HI> or else <HI>settled</HI> and <HI>habitual.</HI> 4. According to the <HI>Sense</HI> we have of it; and so it is either Matter of <HI>Allowance</HI> to us, or Matter of <HI>Annoyance.</HI> 5. According to the <HI>Cause</HI> of it; and so it is either from a <HI>fixed Dislike of Food,</HI> or else from an <HI>accidental Distemper</HI> of the Stomach. 6. According to the
<PB N="53" REF="004663_0244_100DE231A83F7398"/>
<HI>Effects</HI> of it; for it is either <HI>victorious,</HI> and makes us give ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>abhorred,</HI> and repulsed by Grace, the Christian still holding on in the Way of Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Conclusion</HI> 1. Where his <HI>Weariness</HI> is only in the <HI>Members</HI> (or at least <HI>chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) but there is still a <HI>Wil∣lingness</HI> of the <HI>Mind;</HI> this is no Matter of questioning our Estate. Where the <HI>Mind</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>goes and outdoes the Body, and the Appetite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Duties continues in Vigour, tho' there be a languishing of the <HI>natural Strength,</HI> and weariness of the <HI>bodily Organs;</HI> this is not our Sin, but Affliction. But too commonly the <HI>Body</HI> hath so much Influence upon the <HI>Mind,</HI> and causeth a Listlesness and Sluggishness there, and makes it negligent in its Office: Yet when this doth proceed from the failing of the Spirits, tired with bodily Labour and Exercise, and from the Distempers of the Parts, our most pitiful Father considers our Frame, and remembers we are but Dust: And our merciful High Priest, that is not untouched with the Sense of our Infirmities, is ready to frame our Excuse, <HI>That the Spirit is willing, but the Flesh is weak.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Where our <HI>Weariness</HI> in and <HI>Unwillingness</HI> to Duties, is only <HI>gradual</HI> and <HI>partial,</HI> not <HI>plenary</HI> and <HI>prevalent,</HI> it is not sufficient to conclude our selves graceless: While the Twins are together in the Womb, and two Nations within our Bowels, there will be contrary Inclinations. The Flesh will never say <HI>Amen,</HI> to a good Motion as such, but will be lusting against the Spirit, and will hang back when the Spirit puts forward, and pulls down when the Spirit bends upwards: So that while Corruption remaineth, there will be always a dissenting Party, and continual Conflicts; from whence it is no Wonder there should arise some Weariness: Yet the <HI>Spirit</HI> is the prevailing Interest, and tho' oft times foiled, yet hath mostly the Mastery in the Combat, and carries it against the Flesh, though not
<PB N="54" REF="004663_0245_100DE23629948800"/>
without much Resistance and Reluctancy from the Rebel Opponent.</P>
<P N="3">3. When this <HI>Weariness</HI> is only <HI>transient,</HI> during the present Temptation or Defection, which as soon as the tired Soul can get out of it, returns to its former Temper and Pleasure in Holy Duties, there is only Matter of Humiliation. But when it is the settled permanent and habitual Frame of the Mind, it is a Matter of questioning our Condition. The Holy Psalmist under a Desertion, was even almost perswaded to give over with Religion; but when he is himself, nothing is so sweet, nothing is so lovely and desirable to him, as the Duties of Holiness. But for them who have in their ordinary settled Course and Frame, no Mind of Duties, but are called to them by Conscience, or engaged by Company, as Custom or the like, their Case is fearful in that mea∣sure, that Duty is unpleasing and not loved.</P>
<P N="4">4. Where this <HI>Weariness</HI> of and <HI>Unwillingness</HI> to Duties is painful and grievous, as a Sore in the Eye, as a Sickness in the Heart, the State is good, but where it is naturally allowed, and meets with little or no Resistance, it is a black Mark. For this argues there is nothing but Flesh, that there is no contrary Principle in such a Heart. For if there were, the Spirit would at least make Opposition: This was the very Frame of those unsanctified Sinners that counted the Sabbaths and Services of God an unprofitable Burden, a very Weariness, a Bondage not to be born, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.13. A gracious Heart, when under such a Distemper, as that God's Service seems a <HI>Weariness,</HI> is even weary of himself, whiles this is burdensome, he is a Burden to himself. He cannot enjoy himself while in such a Frame wherein he cannot enjoy God: and if this be the Case, our State is good, though the Frame be bad.</P>
<P N="5">5. Where this <HI>Weariness</HI> and <HI>Unwillingness</HI> is not from a rooted Dislike of the Food, but an accidental and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ematural Indisposition of the Stomach, or being disappointed of God's Presence in Duties, the
<PB N="55" REF="004663_0246_100DE2399DC37608"/>
main State is safe. You know under a Distemper, the Appetite may disgust, and nauseate the Food that a Man doth love above all other Meats when he is well, and so it is here. Do you when you are your selves relish more Sweetness in God's Service than in your Meats and Drinks? Are no Sweets so delight∣ful to you as Fellowship and Communion with God, when you can attain to it in Duties? Do you come away discontented, because you cannot meet with God? Is the Ground why your Countenances fall, and your Hearts be discouraged, because you have <HI>(with them)</HI> toiled and spread the Net, and have not caught what you went for: because you have no Answer nor Income from God? If it be thus, it is a Sign your Hearts be set upon God; and that you place the Happiness and Comfort of your Lives in God; and so that your State is safe: Otherwise when there is a fixed Antipathy to Duties, and an habitual Dislike of them, and Contrariety to them, the Case is very sad.</P>
<P N="6">6. Where our <HI>Weariness</HI> and <HI>Unwillingness</HI> is such as makes us to give over our Duties, so as to live in the ordinary Neglect of them, it is a fearful Sign: But where notwithstanding present Discouragements, we hold on in the Performance of our Duties, and a humble waiting upon God, for Removal of our Difficulties, till we are brought to a better Frame; this argues well The Church herself may be greatly deserted, but then she gives not over Duties, but seeks after her Beloved, and makes diligent Enquir∣ing, and will not be at rest until she hath found him, but the Hypocrite gives up, and will not wait upon the Lord any longer. Not but that a deserted Soul, may under the Violence of Temptations omit Duties for a time; but his Condition this while is most <HI>pain∣ful, restless</HI> and <HI>grievous</HI> to him, and he quickly returns again, and never comes to live quiet, in the ordinary Omission of known Duties.</P>
<P><HI>Conclu</HI> 7. When our <HI>Weariness</HI> and <HI>Unwillingness</HI> is such as makes us fall out with the Service of Christ,
<PB N="56" REF="004663_0247_100DE23B213D9520"/>
and willing to ease ourselves of his Yoke, and to throw off his Burden: This is a bad Sign: But when we fall out with ourselves, and justly and approve Christ's Ways and Service, it is well. Thus it was with <HI>Paul:</HI> He doth not quarrel with the Law, as too strict and too severe, nor think of breaking off his Bonds, and taking his Liberty, but he <HI>pleads</HI> for the Law, and greatly approves it, and commends it, and condemns the Backwardness of his own Nature, <HI>Rom,</HI> 7.12, 25. When Men are more willing to be rid of CHRIST's Burden, than of the Distemper that makes it grievous, and cast about for Ease, by winding their Bonds, and not by bringing their Minds to them, it is a woful Discovery of an unsound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And thus much for this Case.</P>

<HEAD>Awakening <HI>Questions</HI> propounded to the <HI>Un∣converted;</HI> and <HI>Counsels</HI> to the <HI>Converted.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THat I may rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h every Man's Case, I shall speak something to the Unconverted, and something to the Converted.</P>
<P>For the Unconverted, there are these <HI>six Questions</HI> which I would advise them to put to their Souls</P>
<P>Quest. I. <HI>What Estate did my Soul come into the World first in?</HI> Was it not in a State of <HI>Death,</HI> Eph. 2.1. An Estate of Wrath, <HI>verse</HI> 3. Sirs, Awake and bethink yourselves where you are, and whither you are going. While you are in your natural un∣converted, unbelieving State, all your Sins are unpardoned, and the Wrath of GOD abideth on you, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. <HI>John</HI> 3.3, 36. Suppose you saw a poor Creature hanging over a burning fiery Furnace, by nothing but a twined Thread, like to break every Moment, would not your Hearts shake for such an one? Sirs, it is your very Case; you hang over the
<PB N="57" REF="004663_0248_100DE23CA54EB478"/>
infernal Burnings by Nothing but the small Thread of your Lives, which you know not but it may crack the next Moment, and then where are you? Is this a Case for you to go on merrily and conten∣tedly in?</P>
<P>Q. II. <HI>What Condition is your Soul now in?</HI> Am I changed and renewed by Conversion, or am I not? Speak Conscience, hath this Man, this Woman, been soundly and savingly changed both in Heart and Life? Where are your Evidences? Can you shew the Marks of the Lord Jesus upon your Souls? Let your Conscience answer, where was the Place? What was the Means? When was the Time that thy Soul was throughly renewed? At least if thou cannot shew the Time, Place nor Means, can you prove the Thing? Can you say, with him, <HI>[one Thing I know, that where∣as I was blind, I now see]</HI> Sirs, be not deceived, I tell you, whatever you be, and whatever you do, nothing will avail you to Salvation, except you be new Creatures, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.15.</P>
<P>Q. III <HI>What if I should lose my Soul? What fair Work should I make of it then?</HI> This is very possible, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16 26. Yet it is the Case of the most: There are but few, few of the Children of Men, that do escape safe to Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.14. Sirs, be aware of your Danger, and fear, lest a Promise being left of entring into his Rest, any of you should at last come short of it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.1. Suppose a Man were to travel through some perillous Wood or Wilderness, having but one Jewel in all the World, in which his <HI>All</HI> was bound up, and should see some stand on one Hand, and some on the other, and hear one Com∣pany in this Place, and another in that, crying out under the Hands of some cruel Robbers: Oh, in what Fear would this Traveller go, lest he should lose his Jewel, and be robbed of all at once? Why, thou art the Man. This Traveller is thy self: This Jewel is thy Soul: This Wilderness, or Wood, is this World; thou art to travel through Swarms of Sins, Legions of Devils, a whole World of Temp∣tations.
<PB N="58" REF="004663_0249_100DE23FEA1A5DB8"/>
These are the Robbers that lie in wait for thy Soul, and if all that these can do, can keep thee out of Heaven, thou shalt never come there. Oh, what if thy Pride or Worldliness, thy Delays, and Triflings in Religion, should at last betray thy Soul into the Robbers Hands! Other Losses may be repaired, but thy Soul being once lost, GOD is lost, CHRIST is lost, Heaven, all lost for evermore!</P>
<P>Q. IV. <HI>What do I do for my Soul?</HI> What, have I a Soul, an immortal Soul to care for, and look no better after it, nor bestow no more of my Time or Pains upon it, no more of my Thoughts about it? When <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperor saw the outlandish Women carrying <HI>Apes,</HI> and such kind of strange Creatures, in the Streets in their Arms, he asked, <HI>What! have the Women in these Countries no Children?</HI> So it may be said of many among us that are early and late at their Worldly Business, but let the Care of Religion lye by neglected; <HI>What! have these Men no Souls?</HI> Why Man, hast thou a Soul, and yet dost so little in thy Closet, so little in thy Family, from Day to Day for it? What meanest thou, O Sleeper? Arise, call upon thy GOD, that thou perish not, <HI>Jonah</HI> 1.6. What will become of thy Soul, if thou lookest to it only at this careless Rate?</P>
<P>Q. V. <HI>What if God should this Night require thy Soul? Where would Death land thee?</HI> Luke 12.19, 20. There was one that promised himself many <HI>merry Days</HI> and <HI>Years,</HI> as it is like thou dost; but that same Night God called for his Soul. Sirs, are you in your Postures? Are you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to die? Oh, dare not to live in such a Case, nor in that Course, in which you would not dare to die?</P>
<P>Q. VI. <HI>What a happy Case were I in, if I had but secured my Soul?</HI> Oh, if this were but once done, how sweetly mightest thou live! then thou mightest eat thy Bread, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart, when assured that God accepteth thee and thy Works, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 9.7. Then thou mightest lye down in Peace, and rise up in Peace, go out and
<PB N="59" REF="004663_0250_100DE243A5B82890"/>
come in in Peace; then thou mightest look Death in the Face, thou mightest look Dangers in the Face, yea, look Devils in the Face, and never be afraid. Oh, Sirs, if there be any Insurance Office for Souls in all the World, one would think you should be seeking of it. And thus much for the <HI>Questions,</HI> which though of Use to all, yet were intended chiefly for unconverted, impenitent Souls.</P>

<P>THat you put hard to it, to get that by these hazardous Opportunities that may quit all your Cost.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>What Pity is it that you should adventure much, and yet gain but little? How sad would it be, if you should at last suffer deeply for your Conscientious Attendance upon God in such Seasons, and when you come into a Prison, or into Banishment should find that you had not got that by them that would bear you out.</P>
<P>Coun. II. <HI>That you value no Mercy barely as it serves in content to your Flesh, but as it stands in order to Eternity, and may serve to the furthering your Maker's Glory.</HI> God hath preserved your Liberties, and hath restored mine: But what of all this, Unless we improve our Liberties for Eternity, what are we better than those that are in Prison, if this be all the Advantage we have a little more Content to our Flesh? The Cypher put to the Figure is of great Consideration, but put it by it self, it signifies nothing at all. These Creature Comforts separated from their Respect to God and Eternity, are of no Value: But in order to these Ends they signify much. We have Ease and Fulness, when many others are in Pain, and in Pover∣ty; and we have much the Start of them, if we be
<PB N="60" REF="004663_0251_100DE24641B6CC08"/>
wise to improve our Health, in saying in a-pace against a wet Day, and preparing a pace for Eternity. And if we serve the Lord with the more abundant Diligence and Chearfulness, and Gladness of Heart in the Abundance of all Things But if this be all we have by it, that our Bones do lie a little softer, and our Palates are tickled with a little the more Delight, what Profit have we by our Health, or our Estates? If they that be sick or poor do love the Lord as well, or serve the Lord as much as we; they have the Advantage of us, and better were it for us to be poor and sick as they be.</P>
<P>Coun. III. <HI>Rest not in Probabilities for Heaven, but labour for Certainties.</HI> Beloved, Certainty may be had, else the Counsel of God to make our Calling and Election sure were in vain, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10 Else the Experience of the Saints were but a Delusion, who tell us they know they are passed from Death to Life, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.14. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.1. <HI>Job</HI> 19.25, 26. Else the Power of Self-reflection were to no Purpose, and the Spirit which is in Man should not know the Things of the Man, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 11. Now if a Cer∣tainty may be had, will you not put in for it, and turn every Stone, but you will get it? Sirs, now, if ever, you have need to put hard to it to get Assu∣rance. We are at miserable Uncertainties for all outward Enjoyments; we know not how soon we may be called to part with them all: Christians, What do you mean? Will you be content to have nothing sure? Will you not settle your everlasting Condition, now you are so unsettled as to your outward Condition? What will you do in the Day of Visitation, when Extremity comes in upon you, if you have no Assurance that God will receive you? It would make ones Heart tremble to think of being put upon such a fearful Temptation to part withall for Christ, and not to be sure of him neither? O Man! what an Advantage will the Tempter now have upon thee, when he shall suggest, Wilt thou be such a Fool as to let go all at once? Thou seest
<PB N="61" REF="004663_0252_100DE247D715A718"/>
Heaven is not sure, Christ is not sure, therefore keep the World while thou hast it, and hold what thou hast sure: Beloved, what a fearful slighting of God, and Contempt of Heaven, and Glory, and all the Promises, doth this argue, that you can be content to be at Uncertainties whether they be yours or no? How many of you be there that do not know whether you be going to Heaven or to Hell? And what desperate Carelessness doth this argue, to go on from Week to Week in such a Case? Some Hopes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have that you shall do well, but put not me off with Hopes, never be satisfied, till you are able to say, not only, <Q>I hope I shall be saved; but, I know I am passed from Death to Life; I know that when the earthly House of this Tabernacle shall be dissolved, I have a Building not made with Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.1.</Q></P>
<P>Couns. IV. <HI>Be not satisfied with the Truth of Grace, but reach after the Growth.</HI> Do not think all is done, when you have attained the Evidence of Grace, but put on hard towards the Increase. That Person that doth not desire and design Perfection, never came up to Sincerity. He that desires Grace truly, desires it not barely as a Bridge to Heaven, and so to seek no more than will just bear his Charges thither: But he desires it for its own Sake; and therefore desires the Height of it: That Person that desires Grace only for Heaven's Sake, and enquires what is the lowest Measure of Grace that any one may have and come to Heaven, (by which he meaneth but to be saved from Misery) upon this Design, that if he could but come to that Pitch, he would desire no more; that Person is rotten at the Heart. Christians, the Lord doth expect of you, that you should not be Babes and Dwarfs; He looks now, especially that you should make some Progress: What do you more than heretofore? What! Do you feel his Spurs in your Sides, and his Whip at your Backs; and yet never mend your Pace in Religion, not stir one Jot the faster? Let me commend to you <HI>Paul</HI>'s
<PB N="62" REF="004663_0253_100DE24AAA658FB8"/>
Study, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 12, 13, 14. It argues a base and unworthy Spirit to content ourselves with little Things in Religion.</P>
<P>Couns V <HI>Labour that Holiness may become your Nature, and Religion your Business.</HI> Then you are come to somewhat indeed in Religion, when the Work of God is become your natural and beloved Employment, your Meat and Drink, your Work and Wages When your Tongues and Hearts do as naturally run on God, as others on, and of the World: Much of that may be attained by constant Care and Prayer. Brethren, let God's Work be done by you, not by the Bye, but as your greatest Business: <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God,</HI> Mat. 6.33. And so whatsoever you be, you may be able to give that Account of yourselves, that our Saviour did when they enquired of him, <HI>that you are about your Father's Business,</HI> Luke 2.59.</P>
<P>Couns. VI. <HI>Confine not your Religion to your Knees, but carry on an even spun Thread of Holiness through your whole Course</HI> Brethren, 'tis the Disgrace of Religion, that Christians are so unlike themselves, unless it be when they are in Holy Duties. This wounds Reli∣gion to the Quick, when it shall be said of Pro∣fessors, These Men indeed, will pray like Angels, but for aught we can see, they are as peevish, and as touchy, as any other Men, and they are as hard in their Dealings, and make as little Conscience of their Words, as others do. Beloved, think not Religion lies only, or chiefly, in praying, hearing, reading: No, you must be throughout religious. Sirs, bring forth your Religion out of your Closers into your ordinary Course. Let there not be a List of Holiness on the Outside of the Cloth, but let Holiness be woven into the Whole of your Conver∣sations. Here lies the Excellency and Difficulty of Religion: When you have the Baits of Intemperance before you, then hold the Reins hard, and deny your Flesh; and when you have Provocation before you, then to bite in your Passions, and bridle the
<PB N="63" REF="004663_0254_100DE24E8110E360"/>
unruly Members: When you have Dealings with others, then to proceed by that Golden Rule of Equity and Charity, <HI>To do to others as your Conscience tells you, you would have them do in like Case to you.</HI> When you are called upon in your several Relations, then to behave yourselves with that Tenderness and Love, with that Reverence and Obedience, with that Courtesy and Condescension, and Kindness that be∣comes you in your various Capacities: In this I say, lies the Excellency of Religion.</P>
<P>Couns. VII. <HI>Ever walk with your End in your Eye:</HI> It is true, according to the usual Similitude, The Traveller thinks not of his Journey's End in every Step, nor need he; yet there is no Traveller but thinks of it at his setting out: Brethren, there is nothing hinders, but that with Prayer and Watch∣fulness you might come to this, <HI>in every solemn Action to mind GOD as your End:</HI> Impose this upon your∣selves as your daily Rule to walk by, never to lye down but with these Thoughts, <HI>[Well, I will make use of my Bed as an Ordinance of God for my natural Refreshment, that a Servant of his may he fitted for his Work.]</HI> Never to rise up but with these Thoughts. <HI>[I will set forth this Day in the Name of the Lord, and make it my Business this Day throughout to please him.]</HI> Never to set about our Callings, but in the Entrance to think thus, <HI>[I will set about my Employment in Obedience to God, because this is his Will, that I should walk with him in my Place and Station.]</HI> Never to sit down to your Tables but thinking, <HI>[I will now eat and drink not merely to feed my Flesh, but to cherish a Servant of Christ Jesus, that he might have Strength for his Service.]</HI> Charge this upon yourselves, and examine in the Evening, how you have minded it, and check yourselves wherein you come short. Once learn this, and you are come to something: And you shall have the undoubted Evidence of your Sincerity, and shall know the Inside of that blessed Mystery of walking with God.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="004663_0255_100DE25166F8E5F0"/>Couns. VIII. <HI>Be and do more than ordinary in your Families and Closets, now in the Defects of the more publick Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In your Closets see that your Consciences be able to bear you witness, that under GOD's extra∣ordinary Providences, you do more than ever in Answer thereunto. It may be you prayed twice in the Day before; Why should you not at such a Time as this is, make one Visit more than ordinary to Heaven, daily to represent before God the Cala∣mities of his Church. This be sure of, that somewhat more than heretofore must be done, else God must look upon himself as intolerably slighted, and upon his Church as most unnaturally neglected, if we do not now put to it. Be more than ever, in Self-Examination God doth look, that when he is trying of us, we should be much in the Trial of ourselves. And here let me put it to your Conscien∣ces, How are your Rules for daily Examination looked after? Do you try yourselves by them from Day to Day? Ah wretched Negligence! What have you given your Approbation, and passed your Pro∣mise, and yet even in such a Day as this, so much forget your Duty? God expects it of you, that now you see him angry, you should with more jealous Fear, and tender Circumspection, and holy Watch∣fulness and Self-denial, walk before him, else you will greatly incense his Indignation, when he shall see that you slight his Anger.</P>
<P N="2">2. In your Families; Christians, now the Lord calls aloud upon you, to set your Houses in Order. Oh see what is amiss in them, and strive to cast out that which may be a Provocation. Three Things I advise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou in reference to your Families.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That you set up the solemn Exercise of Catechising Weekly among you:</HI> Methinks I would not question. but that in every Godly Family there is a Care of the <HI>Catechism.</HI> But when Governors do only impose it in general upon their Families, and occasionally take an Account, I find little Progress is made:
<PB N="51" REF="004663_0256_100DE252F0BED220"/>
and therefore I beseech you to make it a solemn, standing, and constant Exercise, and to expect of your Children and Servants as due an Account Weekly of what they have learn'd in the Principles of Religion, as of any Business of your own. Oh the incredible Benefit that would speedily come of this, if I could but persuade, and prevail with my Hearers in so small a Request as this.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That you be often enquiring into their Spiritual Estates:</HI> Follow them close, and let them have no Quiet, till you see they seriously mind and seek spiritual Things. Put them upon secret Prayer, provide Helps for them till they are able to go without them: Shew them often the Necessity of Regeneration, and Conversion, and the Nature thereof. Put them in mind of the fearful Misery of an unregenerate Estate. Ask them often, Whether they are converted or not? Shew them the Danger of delaying in such a Case. Beloved, 'tis too sadly evident, that as the Ordinances are now some-where managed, there is little Conversion-work like to be done. Oh you Governors of Families, do but your Duties in your several Places, and I doubt not but many Souls will nevertheless be born to CHRIST, even in such a Day as this.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Call them to an Account of their Proficiency by every Opportunity.</HI> If there be but a Sermon, or a Chapter read, let them give you some Account of it. Thus our Saviour, when the Disciples (his Family) were in private, he was asking them Whe∣ther they did understand, and profit by what they heard in Publick, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.1.</P>
<P>Couns. IX. <HI>Be not discouraged by the present Diffi∣culties of Religion, but rather rejoyce in the Opportunity, to shew your Love and Loyalty to your Lord.</HI> Do not think that God hath dealt hardly with you, now your Religion is like to cost you something, and and presently think of your shrinking and drawing back to preserve your Safety. If you do love the Lord Jesus, you should rejoice, and be exceeding
<PB N="66" REF="004663_0257_100DE255E87930D8"/>
glad in the Opportunity to shew it. Brethren, what hath your Religion cost you hitherto? And for Shame suffer not your shrinking, and withdrawing to tell the World that you have not Love enough to Christ, to engage you to run any Hazard for him. Do you indeed love the Lord? Oh then, now re∣joice and be exceeding glad, for never had you such an Opportunity, in all your Lives, to shew your Love as now; for never were you called to adven∣ture so for him, and his Service, as now you be. Now resolve, that if Religion will make you vile, you will be yet more vile; and let your Zeal and Resolution for God be intended and heightned by Opposition.</P>

Oh happy and blessed Meeting! Christians, do not forget your Errand; remember where you are, and what you are come for, and know that you are upon the solemnest Transaction that ever passed between the Creator and the Creature. It is God's admira∣ble Condescension, that he will be tied to us, and enter into Bonds with us, to bless us, and reward us. And because our Faith is weak, he hath brought his Surety with him, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is a Surety on his Part, as well as ours, to undertake for the fulfilling of the Pro∣mises. And he hath brought the visible Signs, and Pledges by which all shall be firmly past and ratified before your Eyes. <HI>This is the New-Testament in my Blood,</HI> Luke 22.20.

<P>I will judge your Cause, I will defend your Rights, you shall not stand nor fall at Man's Bar; you shall not be cast at their Votes: Let them curse, I will bless; let them condemn, I will justify: Who shall accuse when I shall acquit you? Who shall lay any thing to your Charge, when I do dis∣charge you?

<PB N="69" REF="004663_0260_100DE25F383DC420"/>
to be true, that it were Presumption in us to count upon all this. What; shall they that must say to Corruption, that thou art my Father, be able to say to the incorruptible God, Thou art my Father? Shall they that must say to the Worm, thou art my Mother and my Sister, be able to say to the Angels of Light, Ye are my Fellow-Servants? And to the King of Glory, Thou art my Brother, and my Kinsman? Shall Majesty espouse himself to Misery? and the Worms Meat be married to Immortality and Life? How can these Things be?</P>
<P>Nay, but O Heart of Infidelity, what art thou that repliest against God? Dost thou, under a sly Pretence of Humility, question with thy Master, and call his Veracity into Doubt? Is not this his Word, his Promise, his Covenant? And is not there of his Seal? Why then dost thou doubt, O thou little Faith?</P>
<P>Art. II. <HI>That he will intitle you to all the divine Per∣sons and Perfections,</HI> Gen. 17.7. <HI>I will be a God unto thee:</HI> Mark, God gives away himself, and he gives his Son to you, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.6. <HI>I will give thee for a Cove∣nant of the People.</HI> This is the Church's Triumph, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.6. <HI>Unto us a Son is given.</HI> And he gives his Spirit to you, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.16. <HI>He shall give you another Comforter.</HI> And Believers acknowledge the Receipt. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12. <HI>We have received the Spirit which is of God.</HI> Thus you see all the <HI>Persons</HI> of the God-head are made over to you, and so are all the <HI>Perfections</HI> of the God-head; and all the Covenant runs, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. <HI>I am the Almighty God,</HI> or, <HI>the All-sufficient God, walk before me and be upright:</HI> These are the Terms between God and a Believer. Be thou up∣right before me, and I will be All-sufficient to thee: The All-sufficiency of God is the Comprehension of all his <HI>Perfections.</HI> Truth without Power, or Power without Wisdom, or both, without Good∣ness, would not be <HI>All-sufficiency.</HI> All-sufficiency takes in all that is in God, (if we may speak of Good most simple Essence according to the shallow reach
<PB N="70" REF="004663_0261_100DE260C637F6F8"/>
of our present Capacity) yea, it comprehends infi∣nitely more than can be said or thought. Why now this is the Covenant of Grace, which God establishes with you this Day; that he will be a God All sufficient to you.</P>
<P>Christians, rouse up your Faith: Now appropri∣ate and apply the Promises: Now believe strongly, and stedfastly, and Believing will fill you with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory. I do not wonder if your Faith be put to it in so high and great a Mys∣tery; to draw nigh to infinite Majesty, and consider∣ingly and without Hesitancy to say, <HI>Thou art mine and all that thou hast;</HI> this is no easy thing. But thou mayest not dare to doubt it: Canst thou question him who is the Truth? Can the Strength of <HI>Israel</HI> lie, or in his Word deceive thee? But the Soul is ready to reply, Oh the Things are too high and too great for me to presume to believe, and is ready with <HI>Peter</HI> astonished, to cry out, <HI>Depart Lord, for I am a sinful Man.</HI> But why doth thine Hand trem∣ble and thine Heart fail thee: And thy Feet (with <HI>Peter</HI>'s when walking on the Waters) begin to sink? What dost thou stick at? Is it at the Truth of the Promise? No, saith the trembling Soul, but sure so much can never belong to one so sinful. I am afraid it is not mine. Why, what saith the Promise? <HI>Only be upright.</HI> What though thou hast an hundred Failings, yet thy Heart is upright: The Bent of thy Heart is mainly for God and Holiness; thou makest Conscience of all Sin, little as well as great, secret as well as open; and dost thou deliberately allow thyself in any: Thou doest in the settled Frame of thy Heart prefer the Pleasing of God, and value his Favour and Fellowship above all worldly Good; therefore thou art upright: These Marks are infal∣lible. What, dost thou object thy Failings? Art thou under a Covenant of Works? Do you think God now stands upon Perfection? The Covenant is plain: God accepteth of Uprightness: And God hath wrought in thee that Condition that he requires
<PB N="71" REF="004663_0262_100DE263994F6A78"/>
of thee. What can be more plain? Wilt thou suf∣fer the Devil and Unbelief to catch the Bread out of thy Hand, when God tells thee it is thine? Wilt thou be against thyself, and refuse thine own Peace, when God is come to seal thee up to the Day of Redemption? This is that which the Lord here seals to thee, <HI>That he will be God All-sufficient to thee.</HI> O believe and be thankful, and rejoice in thine own Blessedness! Oh happy, thrice happy Souls, whom the living God thus signifieth and sealeth to, and assigns over all his infinite Perfections as its ever∣lasting Possession.</P>
<P>Art. III. <HI>That he will discharge you from all your Debts,</HI> Heb. 8.10, 12. <Q>This the Covenant, I will be merciful to their Unrighteousness, and their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.18. Tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow.</Q> Believest thou this? Cone near beloved Christian, approach believingly, and here thou shalt see the Lord crossing out all thy Debs, taking away the Hand-Writing that is against thee, declaring that he hath received a Ransom, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is satisfied, contented and paid. O happy Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat shall leave all thy Sins behind thee; why, this is the very thing that the faithful God doth here sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto thee: Thy Pardon is written in his most sacred Blood, which is here shed for the Re∣mission of Sins. So that thou mayest triumph with the Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, <HI>Who is he that condemneth, it is Christ that died,</HI> Rom. 8.34.</P>
<P>Art. IV. <HI>That he will save you from your Enemies;</HI> not from the Combat, but from the Conquest. The Victory shall be sure, so far as God is engaged. So the Covenant runs in the first Discovery, that <HI>the Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpent's Head, though he should brui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Heel,</HI> Gen. 3.15. by <HI>the Seed of the Woman,</HI> understand not <HI>Christ only,</HI> but <HI>all Believers,</HI> by the <HI>Serpent</HI> understand not <HI>Satan only,</HI> but all his <HI>Party,</HI> the ungodly persecuting World, which are his Children; and all our tyrranous Lusts, which are
<PB N="72" REF="004663_0263_100DE266F9D22B78"/>
his Brood, his Works. By his <HI>bruising our Heel,</HI> un∣derstand his Molesting and Wounding of us, but not mortally. By our <HI>breaking his Head,</HI> understand the total and final Victory which we shall most cer∣tainly obtain over him and his Party at last. Christians, what should we fear! Death? The Covenant here sealed, makes over Death as a Legacy to you, and behold it brings you the Head of your conquered Enemies in a Charger, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 3.22. Death is yours. O blessed and most grateful Present. <HI>Satan?</HI> The Covenant assures you God will <HI>bruise him under your Feet shortly,</HI> Rom. 16.20. The World? <HI>Be of god chear, Christ hath overcome the World,</HI> Joh. 16.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Hell? <HI>There is no Condemnation for them that are in Christ Jesus,</HI> Rom. 8.1. <HI>Sin?</HI> This indeed is to be dreaded, but with a watchful and cautious Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, not with a fainting discouraging Fear: <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you,</HI> Rom. 6.13, 14.</P>
<P>Christians, here is now Meat for your Faith. What do all these Holy Promises nothing move you? Or carry little savour or relish with them? What shall the Almighty God give it to thee un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er his own Hand, that thou art a Free-Man, and thou make little Account of it? Shall he give tlee thy Protection, and thou lay it by as as useless Paper that signifies little? Oh Sirs, when your Hearts are ready to faint because of the Sons of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that be in the Way; when you see the Black Guad gaping upon you, and the King of Terrors leveling at you, and a wicked World armed with Rage against you, and full of Malice, and the Thieves and Conspira∣tors in the Bosom, watching their Opportunity to betray all to them, yet let not this discourage you. These were enough indeed to make a considering Man's Heart to melt and die within him, but that the Covenant of Grace yields such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple Relief against all. Oh be ever mindful of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Covenant: Remember what hath past this Day between the li∣ving God and your Souls: Watch, O Christian, and stand fast, quit thee like a Man. The Conquest is sure: Who would not fight with Courage, hat hath Assur∣ance of the Victory?</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="004663_0264_100DE268D7075320"/>Art. V. <HI>That He will befriend you in all Conditions.</HI> He will be a fast Friend to you in every Change, and turn all Things to your good, and when you are ready to say unbelievingly, with <HI>Jacob, All these Things are against me,</HI> Rom. 8 28. Gen 42.36. If he bring you into the Wilderness; <Q>There he will speak comfortably unto you, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.14. In the Fire, and in the Water, He will be with you, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43.2. He will be a Strength to the Poor, a Strength to the Needy in his Distress, a Refuge from the Storm, and a Shadow from the Heat, when the Blast of the terrible Ones is as a Storm against the Wall, <HI>Isa.</HI> 25.4.</Q></P>
<P>Beloved, here the Lord is come to seal all these Promises to you. Oh go home, and bless yourselves in the sweet Security of your Estate. God hath pro∣mised you, that whatever Condition you be in, you shall have Succour and Support from him, and enjoy his Presence with you; and see his Finger in all your Troubles, sweetly turning all to the best: Go away, and live like Believers, be not afraid of Sufferings, but shew that you believe what God hath promised, that Affliction shall not hurt you. The next time any Trouble comes upon you, remember what a Pro∣mise GOD hath passed unto you this Day, and wait on him believingly for the happy Issue and Event of every Trial that shall befal you.</P>
<P>Art. VI. <HI>That he will take upon him the Care of all of all your Concernments.</HI> <Q>You must be careful in nothing, <HI>Philip.</HI> 4.5. He careth for you, <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.7. Take no Thought what you shall eat or drink, neither be of doubtful Mind, but rather seek you the Kingdom of God, and all these Things shall be added to you, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.29, 31.</Q> Come you to this Holy Ordinance in any Distress or Trouble? Methinks you should go from it as <HI>Hannah,</HI> and your Countenance be no more sad. God will number your Hairs: And will take care that nothing be lost, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.26. <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.7. He will take care of your Names, and bring forth your Righteousness as the

Light, <HI>Psa.</HI> 37.5, 6. Of your Subsistance; He will give Meat to them that fear him, and be ever mind∣ful of his Covenant, <HI>Psa.</HI> 111.5. Of your <HI>Seed,</HI> for he will be a God unto them, and will entail the Blessing upon them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.7. He commands that your Widows and fatherless Children should be left on him. He is by Covenant to look after their Concerns, you need not be solicitous. He is tender of you, when he seems most to neglect you, as <HI>Moses</HI>'s Sister that was secretly watching behind the Bush, and wishly looking on, to see what was done to the Child, though to the Finders it seemed exposed to Famine and Death in the Flags.</P>
<P>Art. VII. <HI>That he will give you, or be himself to you Instead of all Comforts. He will be a Sun and a Shield, and will give Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly,</HI> Psa 84.11. Oh! the Treasure in these Words, <HI>I am thy Shield, and exceeding great Reward.</HI> I will undertake both for thy Protection and Provision. When Evil as∣sails thee, I will be a Shield to thee: When any good is wanting, I will be a Supply. Thou shalt have Children, or I will be better to thee than ten Children. Thou shalt have Riches, or I will be thy Store: Thou shalt have Friends, if best for thee, or else I will be thy Comforter in thy Solitude, thy Counsellor in thy Distress. My Secrets, my Ear, and my Door shall ever be open unto thee, <HI>Mark</HI> 10 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. <HI>He shall receive an hundred fold in this time:</HI> Tho' he have not the Things themselves, yet he shall have all these, and more than all in me: I will be House, and Friend, and Father to him, all in one If you should have an hundred Candles burning in the Room, and should put out every one, and open the Window and let in the Sun, this would be better than the hundred Lights that were put out: So here, tho' thou still be called to forsake all, 'twill be but as letting the Cistren run, and open the Fountain.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="004663_0266_100DE005CE54DA90"/>Art. VIII. <HI>That he will maintain you all your Days, in his Service.</HI> [He will be your Guide even unto Death, <HI>Psalm</HI> 48.14. Christians, whilst you have a Day to live, God will stand by you. He will never leave you nor forsake you, <HI>Hebrews</HI> 13.5. Surely Goodness and Mercy shall follow you all the Days of your Lives, <HI>Psalm</HI> 23.26. And the Lord will never turn away from you, to do you good, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40.] O happy Covenant that the Lord sealeth to you.</P>
<P>Art. IX <HI>That when you come to Age, he will give the Kingdom to you.</HI> God saith to the Believer here, <HI>Thine is the Kingdom;</HI> What ever is promised in the Covenant, is sealed in the Sacrament, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.32. <HI>It is your Father's good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom,</HI> Luke 22.29. <HI>I appoint unto you a Kingdom.</HI> Mark the Promises pregnant with a Kingdom. 'Tis no less than a Crown, a Kingdom that is here delivered unto you, <HI>Luke</HI> 19.12. <HI>A certain Nobleman went into a far Countrey, to receive to himself a Kingdom, and to return,</HI> This is the Business you are come for hither, <HI>To re∣ceive te your selves a Kingdom, and so to return.</HI> Oh! methinks you should forget what ground you go upon, as you are going home, to think what you have received here. Me-thinks you should go forth as <HI>Haman</HI> from the Banquet joyful, and with a glad Heart. Sirs, do you know what you are doing? Why the Lord doth by these Signs give you the Kingdom, as a Man by the delivering unto you a <HI>Turs,</HI> or a <HI>Key</HI> gives possession of an House or Land. Bretheren, have you ever read of the <HI>King∣dom of Glory,</HI> of the <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> of the <HI>Robes of Righteousness,</HI> of the <HI>Throne of Glory?</HI> Why all this God here makes all over to you. I tell you, Sirs, these are not big Words, nor cunningly devised Fables. God Almighty is here come to certifie you of the Reality of his Promises. As sure as you do now sit on your Seats, you shall shortly sit on your Thrones. As sure as you are now clothed with Flesh so surely shall you be clothed with Glory. Are you
<PB N="76" REF="004663_0267_100DE270CC570308"/>
sure you are now on Earth? So sulely shall you be in Heaven: The Lord intendeth you but for a very little while in this lower Region, you must dwell above; where Christ is, there you must be also. As sure as you now see a crucified Christ, so surely shall you see a glorified Christ. The Lord Jesus doth anticipate his Sentence here, and calls to you Guests; <HI>Come ye Blessed, inherit the Kingdom.</HI> Take the Writing, behold the Seals, there are the Conveyances of the Kingdom. The Donation is sure and full, unalterable, irrevocable.</P>
<P>Christians, Do you believe? If you do me-thinks you should be ravished: Me-thinks you should be filled with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory! But do you stagger at the Promise, through unbelief? Do you say, O it is to much, and too great? Why, how can this be? What, too great for God to make good? Thou darest not think so. But it is too great for me to think upon. Why, but Man, dost thou not bear upon thee the <HI>Mark of the Lord Jesus; Whose Image and Superscription is this?</HI> Doth not your very Heart prize Christ above all the World? Hast thou not made a deliberate Choice of him, for thy head and Husband? Hast thou not entered into a solemn Contract with him, to be his in all Times and Con∣ditions, and love, honour, and obey him, before all others to the Death? And doth not thy Heart stand to all his choice? Hast not thou taken him with his Yoke, and with his Cross? And dost not thou in thy Prastice first seek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness thereof? And hast not thou chosen the Way of the Kingdom? Art thou not in Love with the Holiness? And desirest Grace more than Gold? Dost not thou prefer an Holy Spiritual Life, before all the Grandeur of the World, and Pleasure of the Flesh? And all this not only for a Fit or Flash, but in the settled Frame and Disposition of thy Heart? Surely thou must wrong God and thy self, if thou deniest it to be thus with thee. Why these are the Marks <HI>of the Lord Jesus</HI> upon thee, the sure Marks:
<PB N="77" REF="004663_0268_100DE2737533BC58"/>
Fear not, these cannot deceive thee: The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evidence that thou art born of God, that thou art a Son, and so an Heir; and therefore lay claim to the Inheri∣tance.</P>
<P>Come then, Beloved Christian, be of good Com∣fort, why shouldst thou doubt? Thou hast the Mark of the Sheep, and therefore thy Portion shall be at the Right Hand, thy Sentence among the Blessed. Well then, receive this Holy Sacrament as the Pledge of all this. Go home and look over all these Blessed Promises, and count them thine. Do not read them (as too often heretofore) as if they did not concern thee. Remember what GOD hath here promised under Hand and Seal to thee, and let not all be left behind thee, when thou goest hence, but let the Remembrance, the Fruit and Sweet of this abide upon thee whilst thou hast a Day to live. Never forget what the Lord hath here spoken to thy Soul: Make more of the Promises than ever in thy Life before: Bless thy self in them. Remember how the Lord <HI>delivered thee</HI> the Promises: How he sealed to the several Articles, how he sprinkled the Blood upon the Book of the Covenant, and gave it thee, and said, <HI>This is the New Testament in my Blood:</HI> Oh live henceforth a Life of Joy and Faith, as a Man that is elevated above the World. Do not live at the old, dull and slothful Rate, carry it like a Believer; and in a Word, walk as one that doth in∣deed take all for Truth that the Lord hath spoken to thee this Day. Let that of the Apostle be a Close to all, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1. <HI>Having therefore these Promises, Dearly Beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all Filthiness, both of Flesh and Spirit. Perfecting Holiness in the Fear of GOD.</HI></P>
