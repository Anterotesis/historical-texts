<HEAD>A LETTER from a GENTLEMAN in one of the Frontier-Counties, to his Friend in Phi∣ladelphia, relating to the Paxton-Men.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE PAXTON RIOT (as it is called) makes so great a Noise, and is so much the general Topick, that a Man must be but little in Conversation, without having his Opi∣nion ask'd concerning this Affair.—In Truth, Matters are now come to such a Pass, that some People are of Opinion, that an Endeavour to make them worse may probably be the Way to make them better. Resentment rages high, and gathers thick from every Quarter; and where it will stop, I must leave to those that have more <HI>Light within them,</HI> than I can boast of, to determine.</P>
<P>For my Part, I am no Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt in Politicks, and have but seldom troubled my Head about that Science, beyond the reading of a common News-Paper.—It has long been my unhappy Lot to be a Spectator of the Distresses and Suffer∣ings of my Fellow Subjects; my Heart has often bled for them;—and I should still have continued a secret Mourner for what I had not Power to redress, had not the unaccouta∣ble Conduct of your City Quakers provoked me to speak my Sentiments, and unburthen myself to my Friend.—By my Principles as well as Situation in Life, you know, my dear Sir, that I have no political Ends to serve; that I have no∣thing to hope or fear from Party Connections; and that I can have no other View in troubling you with this Let∣ter than to rescue the miserable Frontier People, who lately rose in Arms, from the Infamy and Odium thrown upon them, by <HI>those</HI> whose unfeeling Hearts have never suffered them to look beyond their own private Interest and Party.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Author of this Letter, hopes he will not be understood as approving of these People's having taken up Arms. Such violent Steps can never possibly be productive of any thing, but WILD UPROAR and CONFUSION. Whatever therefore can have a Tendency to promote this; or that offers the <HI>least Insult</HI> to the LAWS and GOVERNMENT of his Country, he will ever think it his Duty to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Testimony against, and to discountenance by every Means in his Power.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="009594_0004_0F76DC5D959F3F70"/>
The INSURGENTS themselves hand about a Kind of <HI>Mani∣festo,</HI> which contains the following Declaration, Grievances, Complaints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—viz.</P>
<Q><P>That a trifling Dispute, between a few English and French Traders upon the <HI>Ohio,</HI> was neglected; the profer'd Mediation and Assistance of the Indians to end the Quarrel, and the Proprietary-Offer of £. 400, for erecting a small Fortification there, together with £. 100 yearly, towards the Support of it, were contemptuously rejected <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Governor MORRIS'S Message of November 22, 1755.</NOTE> till it kindled the Flames of War, which at last spread and raged over half the Globe.—That from the Neglect of the <HI>Legis∣lative Part</HI> of this Province, and the horrid Doctrines of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> at that Time so strenously maintain'd, such Calamities ensued, that near <HI>one Hundred Miles</HI> of as thriv∣ing a Settlement as any in Pennsylvania has been reduced to Desolation; many of the Inhabitants murdered or carried into Captivity, and the Rest often drove from their Habi∣tations in the utmost Distress and Want.—And besides these particular Effects of this War, some of the best Blood in Christendom has been spilt in it—whole Kingdoms have been almost depopulated; and Misery and Ruin en∣tail'd upon Millions of their Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>That even in the Midst of this Desolation and Carnage, every publick Measure was clogg'd— the King's Demands for Men and Money procrastinated— unnecessary, or at least ill-timed Disputes, about <HI>Proprietary Instuctions and Taxes,</HI> were brought upon the Carpet, in Order to divert the Reproach and Dishonour which the Province, thro' Quaker Measures, had incurr'd, and throw the whose Blame of the War at the <HI>Proprietary</HI> Doors.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See the Speeches and Messages between the Governer and Assem∣bly, from the Year 1753, to the Year 1760.</NOTE> And that this villainous Scheme might carry with it a better Face, the late infamous TEDYUSCUNG was treated with, and employed to charge the Proprietaries with having defrauded the Indians of some Lands, and to declare that this was the Occasion of all their Uneasiness and Enmity to the <HI>English.</HI>—But infamous as TEDYUSCUNG was, he own'd at last that his Complaints were unjust; publickly renounc'd his Claim, and declared in open
<PB N="5" REF="009594_0005_0F76DC5E60755768"/>
Treaty that he was urged to act this base Part, and that <Q>he was only the <HI>Mouth of some Persons</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> whom he did not chuse to name.<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e declared at the last Treaty at <HI>Lancaster.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>That they have always manifested, and are still upon every Occasion ready to manifest their Allegiance and Loy∣alty to their most gracious Sovereign King GEORGE, whom they have ever esteemed as the kind and careful Father of his People.</P>
<P>That tho' born to Liberty, and all the glorious Rights and Privileges of BRITISH SUBJECTS, they were denied Protection, at a Time when the Cries of Murder and Distress might have made the very Stones relent; and tho' roused to Vengeance and eager to maintain and defend their Lives and sacred Rights, their Hands were basely tied up!</P>
<P>They could obtain no proper Law to collect their Strength; nor any Sanction or Encouragement to pursue the Ene∣mies of their Country!</P>
<P>That they have suffered and bled in the Cause of their Country, and have done more to protect it from the Vio∣lence of a rapacious Enemy than any others in the Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>That agreeable to the Command of the Prophet, they have <Q>fought for their Brethren, their Sons, and their Daughters, their Wives and their Houses.</Q>—That in this Contest, many of them have lost their dearest Relatives; their Houses, their Lands, their all; and from a plenti∣full independent People have been reduced to Misery and Want.</P>
<P>That they have been treated as <HI>Aliens</HI> of the Common-Wealth, and denied a just and <HI>proportionable Share in Legislation:</HI> For that out of 36 Members which the eight Counties in the Province send to Assembly, the three Counties of <HI>Philadel∣phia, Chester</HI> and <HI>Bucks,</HI> where the Quakers are chiefly settled, return 26 of that Number; while the 5 remaining Counties, where these LORDLY RULERS could have no Chance of getting elected, are suffered to send but the other Ten.</P>
<P>That by this iniquitous Policy, the Inhabitants of these five Frontier-Counties, altho' a great Majority, have been
<PB N="6" REF="009594_0006_0F76DC5F4F509010"/>
rendered unable to act in Defence of their Lives and Pro∣perties; and therefore have lain for above eight Years at the Mercy of a cruel Savage Enemy and an unrelenting Quaker Faction: Whereas had they been justy represented in Legislation, instead of presenting PACIFICK ADDRESSES to the Assembly, telling them that <Q>the raising large Sums of Money, and putting them into Hands of COMMIT∣TEES, who might apply them to Purposes inconsistent with their PEACEABLE TESTIMONY, was in its Consequen∣ces destructive of RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See the Quaker-Address to the Assembly, November 6, 1755.</NOTE></Q> Instead of doing this, I say,— the first great Law of Nature, that of SELF-DEFENCE, would have been administred to the Peo∣ple upon the first Alarm of Danger, and the Hands of the HARDY and the BRAVE would have been set at Liberty, til they had taken ample Vengeance of their MURDERERS.</P>
<P>That they have often, in the most suppliant Manner, laid their Grievances before the Assembly; and instead of being redress'd, have been abused, insulted, and even by some Members of that <HI>venerable House,</HI> deem'd as unwor∣thy of Protection, as <Q>A Pack of insignificant SCOTCH-IRISH, who, if they were all <HI>killed,</HI> could well enough be spared.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">This unchristian and ungenerous Speech was made by N—L G—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a Quaker, Member of Assembly for <HI>Chester</HI> County, and some others.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>That whilst they were thus abused, and thus stript of their <HI>Birth-Rights,</HI>—ISRAEL and JOSEPH, two pet∣ty Fellows, who ought to have no higher Claims than themselves, were permitted to lord it over the Land; and in Contempt of the Government, and the ex∣press Orders of the Crown, forbiding them to hold private Treaties with the Indians, exchange Belts of Wam∣pum with them—make them Presents—all this they have done, and in their own Name, without so much as in∣cluding the simple MENONISTS, from whom they had extorted large Sums of Money to Support this Expence.— Nay, even with the most matchless Impudence, insinuated to the Indians that they were Rulers and Go∣vernors; as plainly appear'd at the late Treaty at LAN∣CASTER,
<PB N="7" REF="009594_0007_0F76DC5FE1EC18E8"/>
where the Principal CHEIF and SPEAKER told Mr. H—N, then Governor, <Q>That as he understood there were two GOVERNORS in the Province, he would be glad to know which of them he was to treat with.<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">That you may be convinc'd that such was the Opinion of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> I must observe to you, that one PATRICK A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NEW, of the Bo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> White-smith, having been duly sworn upon the HOLY EVANGELISTS, before the CHIEF BUROESS of that Town, hath deposed and said▪ That he, the said Deponent, being a Constable at the last Indian Treaty at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> was commanded by the <HI>Gevernor,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o proclaim, that no Person should sell or give any Kind of spirituous Liquors to the Indians, on any Pretence whatever; that he proclaim'd his Order thro' the Town accordingly; and that upon his making Pro∣clamation, and saying, <HI>by Order of the Governor,</HI> an Indian named TE∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>YUSCUNG, cry'd out <Q>D—n your G—r, D—n your G—r; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m—t-n is my Governor, P-m—t-n is our Governor, he allows RUM enough;</Q> and offer'd Violence to this Deponent; who also, upon his Oath, declares that, notwithstanding the Proclamation, the Indians were privately entertain'd at a certain Tavern in the Town.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>That the Indians were induced to look upon ISRAEL as the <HI>first Man, or</HI> CHEIF SACHEM of the Province, from seeing the Haughtiness and Contempt with which he treated his Fellow Subjects, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> insolent and ar∣rogant Behaviour to Sir W—M <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—N at <HI>Easton;</HI> and to Governor H—N, at <HI>Lancaster:</HI> And that this, among other Things, has been productive of manifold Evils, by weakening our Credit with Indians, frustrating the good Intention of holding Treaties with them, and encouraging them, after they return'd from us loaded with Money, Cloaths, Arms and Ammunition, to look with Contempt upon us as a pusillanimous Pack of <HI>old Women,</HI> divided among ourselves, without SPIRIT or RESOLUTION to call them to an Account, let them commit what Outrages they pleased upon us.—</P>
<P>That they have been made Tributaries to support the immense Expence of <HI>Indian Treaties;</HI> to which they chearfully submitted, in Hopes that their dear Relati∣ons and Fellow Subjects, who have been long detained in barbarous Captivity, would have been restored; But that instead of <HI>insisting</HI> upon the Promises and Engage∣ments made by the Indians to this End, an extensive and valuable Trade was opened with these faithless
<PB N="8" REF="009594_0008_0F76DC609F83FE40"/>
and perfidious Villains; and their poor unhappy Friends left to spend perhaps the Remainder of their days, in all the Sorrow and Miseries of <HI>Heathenism</HI> and <HI>Bar∣barity,</HI> and to bow their Necks to the cruel Slavery of Savages</P>
<P>That at a Time when their ungenerous and merciless Enemies, had again, without the least provocation, in∣vaded the Province, with the very Arms and Ammuni∣tion which they received at the late Treaties; and when the Frontiers were yet reeking with the Blood of their slaughter'd inhabitants; and the murdered Ghosts of their Friends and Relatives cry'd aloud for Vengeance, a Number of Indians (many of which were concerned in this horrid Butchery) were escorted to the <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and there protected, cherished, and maintained in Luxury and Idle∣ness, whilst they, the poor Sufferers, were abandoned to Misery, and left to starve, or beg their Bread.</P>
<P>That upon seeing themselves thus abused and thus ne∣glected, and considering that the Influence of a <HI>Quaker Fac∣tion</HI> was the Source from whence all these Evils flow'd; and that <HI>pretended</HI> Scruples against War and Fighting were the Root from whence all their Calamities and heavy Suffer∣ings sprang, and if yet permitted, might produce worse and more heavy, they were determined to bear no longer.</P>
<P>That <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> appear'd to them to be really in a dangerous CACHEXY; and that at such a Crisis they look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon it as their Duty to administer such Remedies (however severe they might be look'd upon by some) as might raise her drooping Head, and restore her to Health and Vigour.—And should their first Trial fail of Suc∣cess, that in that Case they are determined to <HI>double the Potion,</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">By this Expression, I am told, these People mean, that they will renew their Application and ADDRESSES, with DOUBLE the NUMBER of Signers; and it is said, they are likely to get TEN to One, that they had before, to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emonstrate</HI> with them.</NOTE> which they hope will intirely purge off the pec∣cant Humours, restore the Solids, and secure her hereafter from the Infection of <HI>Quaker Non-Resistance.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Such is the Declaration, and such the Complaints of these People. —And indeed nine Tenths of the Inhabitants
<PB N="9" REF="009594_0009_0F76DC615474ADD8"/>
of the Back-Counties either tacitly, or openly, ap∣prove and support them—Every cool and well thinking Man, as well as Men among themselves, are sensibly con∣cern'd that they were reduced to the Necessity of having Re∣course to such Methods as might be deem'd an Insult to the Government and Laws of their King and Country.</P>
<P>The Names of RIOTERS, REBELS, MURDERERS, WHITE SAVAGES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See the NARRATIVE, and a Letter from 'SQUIRE READ, the JER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EY DEMOST<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ENES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> have been liberally and indiscriminately bestowed upon them: But all this they look upon only as the Effects of disappointed Malice, and the Resentment of a destructive FACTION, who see their <HI>darling Power</HI> in Dan∣ger.—The <HI>Merciful</HI> and the <HI>Good</HI> however, they trust, will rather pity than condemn them.— And they are pleased with the Thoughts that they have been able at last to lay bare the PHARASAICAL BOSOM of QUAKERISM, by obliging the NON-RESISTING QUALITY to take up Arms, and to become Pro∣selytes to <HI>the first great Law of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>But this Triumph of theirs is founded upon a false Suppo∣sition, that <HI>Quakers</HI> never us'd Arms before.— Whereas, it can be prov'd that these People have <HI>taken up Arms,</HI> and <HI>fought well too,</HI> upon many other Occasions.—Whoever will take the Trouble to read the printed Trials of G. KEITH, will find, that when a <HI>Quaker</HI>-Sloop, belonging to <HI>this</HI> Pro∣vince, was formerly taken by some <HI>PIRATES,</HI> and finding it impossible to save both the <HI>Sloop,</HI> and their so much-cried-up <HI>Principle, against outward Force,</HI> they at last resolved to give up the <HI>Principle,</HI> rather than the <HI>Sloop!</HI> and so opposed Force to <HI>Force</HI>—retook their Vessel, and made some of the <HI>Pirates</HI> Prisoners!</P>
<P>It is plain that the first <HI>Quakers</HI> were never against Force of Arms, if <HI>they</HI> thought the Quarrel just.</P>
<P>If you will believe their own Writers, they fought well in the Reign of OLIVER CROMWELL.—<HI>G. Fox,</HI> in the Fifth Page of his Letter directed <HI>"To the Council of Officers of the Army, &amp;c."</HI> complains, That many <HI>Quakers</HI> were disbanded out of the Army, for no other Fault than their being <HI>QUA∣KERS,</HI> though <HI>they</HI> were good <HI>Fighters</HI> and good <HI>Soldiers.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="009594_0010_0F76DC6296706668"/>
<Q>Many valiant Captains, Soldiers and Officers, says he, have been put out of the Army by Sea and Land, of whom it hath been said among you, that they had rather have had <HI>One</HI> of Them, than <HI>Seven</HI> Men, and could have turn'd out <HI>one</HI> of them to <HI>seven</HI> Men, who, because of their Faithfulness to the Lord God, and it may be for saying <HI>Thou</HI> to a particular Person, and for wearing their <HI>Hats,</HI> have been turn'd out from among you.</Q></P>
<P>This same Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> in a Book publish'd by him and some others of his Brethren, intitled, WEST <HI>answering to the</HI> NORTH, Page 96, 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, exults in these Words,— <Q>Multi∣tudes of People flock'd up to <HI>Westminster</HI> to complain of their Sufferings—which CHARLES STUART call'd <HI>Tumults;</HI> and by the Guard one of them was slain, at the Place of the shedding of whose Blood, CHARLES STUART'S Head was struck off.</Q>—Thus their Enemies are punished.</P>
<P>In Page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>02 are these Patriotick Expressions,—<Q>The righteous Ends of War's for Liberty and Laws.</Q>—And in Page 16 they boast— <Q>The Defence of them (the Laws) have we in the late Wars, vindicated in the Field, with our Blood.</Q></P>
<P>One <HI>Bishop,</HI> a Quaker Writer, in a Letter of his to the Council of State, in the Time of the <HI>Usurpation,</HI> written in the Year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, advises them in these Words, <Q>It concerns you, while ye have Time, to bear down this <HI>Enemy,</HI> (meaning the King) and to secure Places necessary for <HI>Defence.</HI></Q>—And again he urges them to <HI>kill</HI> all that should appear in Favour of the Royal Cause; <Q>Do Justice, says he, on those whom God hath given into your Hands, lest out of this SERPENT'S EGG do come a COCKATRICE, and his Fruit be a fiery flying <HI>Serpent.</HI></Q>—And in Page 26 he tells them, <Q>There is a Necessity for the continual marching of your <HI>Horse</HI> up and down in all Parts, especially where these INSURRECTIONS have been.</Q></P>
<P><HI>George Fox,</HI> in his COUNCIL and ADVICE, a Letter wrote by him to <HI>O. Cromwell,</HI> dated the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1th Month. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, Page 26, 27, &amp;c. tells him, That if he had been directed by his Advice, <Q>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ANDERS (says he to him) had been thy Subjects—GERMANY had given up to thy Will—The SPANIARD had quivered like a dry Leaf—The <HI>King
<PB N="11" REF="009594_0011_0F76DC62F7354530"/>
of France</HI> should have bowed under thee his Neck—The POPE should have withered as in the Winter—The TURK<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all his Fatness, should have smok'd— Thou should'st have <HI>crumbled Nations</HI> to Dust—Therefore, (says he) let thy SOLDIERS go forth with a free and willing Heart, that thou mayest <HI>rock Nations as in a Cradle.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Robert Rich,</HI> another Author, informs us, That in the Usurpation, <HI>Friends</HI> had such an Interest, that by the Act of Parliament, bearing Date <HI>June</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, 1659▪ for settling the Militia, the Quakers were made Commissioners to form <HI>Troops</HI> and <HI>Regiments;</HI> to nominate the <HI>Officers;</HI> and to as∣sess Money for buying <HI>Horses, Arms, &amp;c.</HI>—He names Five by their Names, whom he knew, who were of the Com∣mittee for the <HI>Militia</HI> of <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Friends</HI> will deny all these Things. — And if you turn over to the Place, and shew them the very Expressions, they will still endeavour to evade you, and will s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer at your Ignorance for taking them in a <HI>literal Sense,</HI> and tell you with a very grave Phyz, that they are all to be taken <HI>spi∣ritually.</HI></P>
<P>If any Man has a Mind to be imposed upon by such Quibbles, I have no Objection—Let him believe that no more is meant here, than <HI>spiritual Soldiers—spiritual Armies—spiritual Wars—spiritual Regiments and Militias!</HI>—Let him believe <HI>spiritual Troops,</HI> and <HI>spiritual Horse</HI> too, if he will!—<HI>Si vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> the great Apostle of Quakerism, has indeed taken great Pains in his <HI>Apology,</HI> to quote the Testimonies of the <HI>Fathers</HI> against <HI>Fighting:</HI>— And in Page 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5 lays down this Proposition, <Q>That it is not lawful for Christians to resist Evil, or to make war <HI>in any Case.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But did not your <HI>Philadelphia Quakers</HI> take up Arms, and declare they would fight in <HI>one Case,</HI> namely, In Defence of <HI>Friend Indians?</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, these Quakers of Philadelphia have surely ei∣ther committed a Thing <HI>unlawful for Christians;</HI> or belied their Apostle, and done Despite to the Spirit of <HI>Barclay.</HI>—Again in Page 558, <HI>St. Robert</HI> says, <Q>Whoever can recon∣cile this, <HI>resist not Evil,</HI> with, <HI>resist Violence by Force; Give also thy other Check,</HI> with, <HI>Strike again;</HI> whoever
<PB N="12" REF="009594_0012_0F76DC639285D240"/>
(says he) can find a Means to reconcile these Things, may be supposed also to have found out a Way to recon∣cile <HI>God</HI> with the <HI>Devil, Christ</HI> with <HI>Antichrist, Light</HI> with <HI>Darkness,</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> with <HI>Evil.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But did not your Philadelphia Quakers, instead of <HI>Re∣sist not Evil,</HI> attempt to <HI>Resist Violence by Force:</HI> and in∣stead of <HI>Give also thy other Cheek,</HI> even plant Cannon (and surely not Spiritual Cannon) in Order to Strike again? They opened their most noted Meeting-House in Phila∣delphia to the Soldiers; and devoted it to War and Revenge.</P>
<P>What can we say or think of such People as these?—I am sure if their peaceable and meek Apostle could come upon the Earth again, and see his <HI>Esteemed Friends</HI> become like other Men, and <Q>clashing with the Pot∣sheards of the Earth.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">A Phrase made use of by a QUAKER TEACHER, to his Con∣gregation in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in exhorting them to adhere to their PEACE∣ABLE PRINCIPLES.</NOTE></Q>—he would blush and disown them as his Disciples.</P>
<P>In short, it is evident from the late Conduct of <HI>Friends,</HI> that the <HI>Peaceable Testimony</HI> which they have so long born to the World, at the Expence of the Lives and Properties of Thousands of their Fellow Subjects, is now no more—and that they have no more Scruple against taking up Arms, and Fighting than any others—Nay, that they can go into more violent Measures to <HI>Resist Evil</HI> than perhaps were ever hear'd of in the most <HI>Warlike Nations.</HI>—</P>
<P>Where do we find or read of an Instance of <HI>Trenches</HI> being thrown up, and <HI>Cannon</HI> planted, to oppose an insignificant Mob?—And yet this was done by your <HI>Philadelphia Quakers,</HI> against a Handful of <HI>Freemen</HI> and the <HI>King's Subjects,</HI> who thought it their Duty to kill a Pack of vil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inous, faith∣less Savages, whom they suspected, and had Reason to be∣lieve, were Murderers, Enemies to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> his Govern∣ment, and Subjects—Were such violent Proceedings consist∣ent with the Principles which <HI>Quakers</HI> have professed to the World?

<P>Whoever will examine the Proceedings and Debates of Parliament, especially those in the Year 1737, will find the Sentiments of the wisest and bravest People under Heaven, concerning Tumults and Riots.—As these Things were in∣troduced into the Debates of that Session, I shall trouble you with a few Extracts of the Speeches on that Occasion.</P>
<P>Lord C—T declared himself thus—<Q>The People (says he) seldom or never assemble in any riotous or tumultuous Manner, unless when they are oppressed, or at least ima∣gine they are oppressed▪ If the People should be mistaken, and imagine they are oppressed, when they are not, it is the Duty of the <HI>Magistrate</HI> to endeavour first to correct their Mistake by fair Means and just Reasoning; in common Humanity he is obliged to take this Method, before he has Recourse to such Methods as may bring <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Destruction</HI> upon a great Number of his Fellow-Countrymen; and this Me∣thod will generally prevail, where they have not met with any real Oppression: But when this happens to be the Case, it cannot be expected that they will give Ear to their Op∣pressor; nor can the severest Laws, nor the most rigorous Execution of those Laws, always prevent the People's be∣coming tumultuous:—You may shoot them—You may hang them—But till the Oppression is removed or al∣leviated, they will never be quiet, till the greatest Part of them are destroyed. The only effectual Method to suppress Tumults will be, to enquire into the Causes, and to take such Measures as may be proper for removing those Causes: For in the <HI>Body Political,</HI> as in the <HI>Body Natural,</HI> while the Cause remains, it is impossible to remove the Distemper.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009594_0014_0F76DC65DFE880B8"/>
Lord B—ST spoke to this Effect—<Q>The chief End of a Parliamentary Enquiry is not to <HI>discover</HI> or to <HI>punish</HI> the Persons concerned in any Tumult; it is the Conduct of the <HI>Magistrate</HI> that we are principally to enquire into; and if upon such Enquiry, it should appear, that the Tu∣mult was occasioned by any unjust or <HI>Oppressive Conduct,</HI> or by <HI>Negligence</HI> and <HI>Indolence,</HI></Q> we ought to censure or to punish such a Magistrate—Such an Enquiry, and such an Issue on <Q>Enquiry, will satisfy the People, it will remove the Cause of Tumults, and consequently will prevent them for the future: Whereas if we employ ourselves solely in disco∣vering and punishing the Rioters, we do not remove but encrease the Cause of Tumults;—we shall make the Peo∣ple more discontented than they are—The Severity of the Punishment may sear up the Wound for a Time, but it will not be healed; it will fester, and endanger the total Disso∣lution of the Political Body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By these Kind of Proceedings (says another noble Lord) we may for a While keep the People quiet, or knock out the Brains of those who shall presume to be otherwise; but we shall never remove their Discontents, or gain their Af∣fections; and this must be done, or our Government must be made Arbitrary; for a free Government cannot be sup∣ported but by having the Affections of the Generality of the People.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, had your Quakers, those <HI>Children of Peace,</HI> adopted these wise Sentiments, and pursued these humane just and truly politic Measures, every Thing might have been easy. But instead of this, they neglected and despised the Complaints of an injured and oppressed People; refused to redress their Grievances; they promoted a <HI>military Apparatus; fortify'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; Barracks; pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted Cannon,</HI> and strutted about in all the Parade of War, as if they chose rather to have the Province involv'd in a Civil War, and set the Blood of per∣haps 5 or 600 of his Majesty's Subjects shed, than give up, or banish to their native Caves and Woods, a Parcel of treacherous, faithless, rascally Indians, some of which can I be proved to be Murderers. But if they were all innocent, by what Law are we obliged to maintain 140 idle Vagabonds? Must <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> work for murdering Savages as their Lords and Masters?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="009594_0015_0F76DC66A67B6CD8"/>
But in the Name of Wonder! What could be meant by all these warlike Preparations? Surely the Quakers did not intend to make Use of <HI>Musquetry</HI> and <HI>Cannon</HI> too, in case the <HI>Rioters</HI> had proceeded! If they did, they must either be very ignorant or very desperate and cruel—It has often been declared in Parliament, That <Q>the Liberty of Firing at Random, upon any Multitude of his Majesty's Subjects, is a Liberty which ought to be most cautiously granted; and never made use of but in Cases of the most absolute Necessity—And in this Way of thinking (says one of the great Speakers upon the Subject) I am supported by the whole Tenor of the Laws of England—It is now 2 or 300 Years since <HI>Fire-Arms</HI> came in Use amongst Us, yet the Law has never suffered them to be made Use of by the common Officers of Justice—Pikes, Halberts, Battle-Axes, and such like, are the only Weapons that can be made Use of according to Law by such Officers.—It it well known that by a late Statute, which is in Force in <HI>Scotland</HI> as well as in <HI>England;</HI> the Power of the Civil Magistrate, in the Cases of any Mob or riotous Assembly, is fully and distinctly regulated; yet even by that Law (which I have often heard complained of as a Law not to∣lerable in a free Country) there is no express Order given to the Magistrate or his Assistants, to make Use of <HI>Fire-Arms;</HI> so cautious was the Legislature of giving a legal Authority for making use of such Weapons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know it will be said that Officers of justice and their As∣sistants, especially his Majesty's Troops, when they hap∣pen to be called to the Assistance of the Civil Magistrate, are in a very unlucky Situation, if they are not allowed to make use of the Arms in their Hands to prevent their be∣ing knocked on the Head—Their Situation, I shall readily grant, may be unlucky enough; but we are to consider the Law as it stands; and as the Law stands in <HI>England</HI> as well as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if a Person suffers Death by <HI>firing,</HI> the Person that fired, and he who gave him Orders to fire, might both be prosecuted for <HI>Murder;</HI> and I am afraid neither of them would have any Resourse, but in the King's Mercy.—The Soldiers may upon such Occasions make Use of their screw'd Bayonets, for dispersing or seiz∣ing
<PB N="16" REF="009594_0016_0F76DC6765DFF410"/>
the Rioters; by so doing they can hurt none but those that resist them; but I would not advise them to <HI>fire,</HI> un∣less they should find themselves in very great Danger of be∣ing overpower'd, and perhaps murdered by the Mob.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the Sense of the greatest Men in England, and such the Caution and Lenity of a British Parliament.</P>
<P>But what will the World say, or Posterity think of your meek and peaceable Quakers, who thro' pretended Scruples against Resistance! thro' Obstinacy and Love of worldly Power, which they themselves would neither ap∣ply to the Ends for which it ought to be used, nor re∣sign into the Hands of those that would; who have so long suffer'd the Province to bleed beneath the <HI>Savage Knife,</HI> its fairest and most fruitful Fields to be deluged in Gore, and laid waste and desolate by <HI>Barbarian Spoilers!</HI> when they have been frequently supplicated, entreated and conjured, by all the ties of brotherly Love, Friendship, Humanity and Justice, to consider the Misery and Distraction of their Coun∣try —but could never be prevailed upon to stand up in its Defence, or to use proper Means to rescue it from these sad Calamities: Yet have lately appeared with Arms and all the <HI>dread Machinery of War,</HI> to fight their beggar'd, ruined, miserable Fellow Subjects; and to afford that Protection to their cruel Enemies and Murderers, which their Unhappy Countrymen, in their most deplora∣ble Circumstances, could never obtain from them?—O ungenerous, unfeeling Men! Was this the way to treat a ruined, desparing People?—Will not Religion, Reason, Humanity, Justice, Charity, answer No?—Who was it that reduc'd them to the disagreable Neces∣sity of proceeding in the Manner they did?—From what Source are they to derive their Misery? and, Who was it that provok'd and moved them to Resentment? Who is it that has made them Rioters, and then Reproach∣es, and desires they may be <HI>Shot</HI> or <HI>Hang'd</HI> for being so? Who is it that has thrown so many Obstacles in the Way of their Protection and Security? Who is it that has screened and supported the Enemies of their Country, and pours out Vengeance and Destruction upon those that attempt to chas∣tise

and punish them? These are Questions which every Body, with a Moments Reflection, may answer.</P>
<P>A mighty Noise and Hubbub has been made about kill∣ing a few Indians in Lancaster-County; and even <HI>Philoso∣phers</HI> and <HI>Legislators</HI> have been employed to raise the Holloo upon those that killed them; and to ransack <HI>Tomes</HI> and <HI>Sys∣tems,</HI> Writers ancient and modern, for Proofs of their Guilt and Condemnation! And what have they proved at last? Why, that the WHITE SAVAGES of <HI>Paxton</HI> and <HI>Donnegall</HI> have violated the Laws of Hospitality! I can sincerely as∣sure the ingenious and worthy Author of the NARRATIVE, that a Shock of <HI>Electricity</HI> would have had a much more sen∣sible Effect upon these People than all the Arguments and Quotations he has produced.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I utterly abhor and disclaim every Act and Species of Cruelty, and I do solemnly declare, that I disapprove of the Manner of killing the Indians in <HI>Lancaster,</HI> as it was a Kind of Insult to the Civil Magistrates, and an Encroachment upon the Peace and Quiet of that Town; and I wish that the <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>little Ones</HI> at least, could have been spared.—But no doubt the Actors in that Affair, thought with <HI>Friend Bishop,</HI> whom I quoted before, that the best Way was, while their Hands were in, to <HI>kill all,</HI> <Q>lest out of the SERPENT'S EGG, there should come a COCKATRICE, and his Fruit should be a fiery flying SERPENT.</Q></P>
<P>However, Matters of this Kind will always be told with shocking Aggravations— I am persuaded had not Things been misrepresented, some Circumstances in the <HI>Narrative</HI> would never have been sent into the WORLD.</P>

<P>The Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> proceeds with all the <HI>Path<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of Language and Expression, and tells us, <Q>That when the poor Wretches saw that they had no Protection nigh, they divided into their little Families, the Children clinging to their Parents; —They fell on their Knees, protected their Innocence, declared their Love to the <HI>English,</HI> and that in their whole Lives, they never had done them any Injury; and in this Posture they all received the Hatchet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men, Women and little Children!</Q>—This was cruel in∣deed, if it was so—But I would be glad to know who could give this Gentleman so very particular an Account—I have been told, that not a single Circumstance happened which could have given rise to it; and that the above Story was pick'd up from among a Parcel of old Papers in a <HI>Hop-Garden</HI> or a <HI>Hemp-field</HI> (I forget which) upon <HI>Susquehanna.</HI>—And indeed this seems most likely to have been the Case:—For who could possibly tell what pass'd, or how these Indians behaved in the short Interval between their being attacked and all killed, which is said not to have been above Two Minutes:<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">It is confidently said, that the PA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TONIANS were not above twelve Minutes altogether in the Town, and not above two Minutes in dispatching the Indians.</NOTE> No one had any Kind or Intercourse with them, nor even saw them during that Time, except those that kil∣led

them, and they declare, that not one of them appeared in that Posture, not spoke a Word; and that if they had, it would have been impossible to have heard them for the Noise of the shouting of the Multitude.</P>
<P>It is also asserted in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> <Q>That the Bodies of the murdered were brought out and exposed in the Street.</Q>—This appears likewise to have been misrepre∣sentation—I have been informed by some of the most reput∣able Inhabitants of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> that they were never removed out of the <HI>Work-house</HI> and <HI>Work-house-yard,</HI> where they were shot, till they were brought out to be carried to their Graves.</P>
<P>The next Charge usher'd in by the <HI>Narrative</HI> to blacken these unhappy People, is, <Q>That with the <HI>Scriptures</HI> in their Hands and Mouths, they can set at nought that ex∣press Command, <HI>Thou shall do no Murder;</HI> and justify their Wickedness by the Command given to <HI>Joshua,</HI> to destroy the Heathen.</Q>—And then follows a dreadful Ex∣clamation in these Words,—<Q>Horrid Perversion of Scripture and of Religion!</Q> I am really amazed that the <HI>Philosophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Writer of this Paper should suffer himself to be so much im∣pos'd upon, and influenc'd by the malevolent TITTLE TAT∣TLE of every lying Sycophant.

to know, Who appointed him a Judge or Jury upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fair? Does he find that the Government has call'd it <HI>Mur∣der</HI> in either of the Proclamations he has quoted? I have already declared, that I disapprove of the Manner of killing these Indians; and yet I am persuaded this Writer, with all His Ingenuity, will find it too hard a Task to prove it <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>The Faith of Government, we are told, was pledged to these Indians—No doubt of it:—And so it is to every <HI>Robber</HI> and <HI>Villain</HI> before he becomes such:<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the solemn Engagements and Articles of Agree∣ment into which these Indians had entered with WILLIAM PENN, they often broke thro' them, even in his Time.—In Governor KEITH'S Time, about the Year 1719, these Indians were accused by one JOHN CART∣LIDGE, of many Misdemeanors, and among the rest of having <HI>furnished our Enemies with Ammunition,</HI> which obliged Mr. KEITH to write to them, and threaten them, it they did not behave better. These are Facts well known to many now living.</NOTE> But will any Man suppose thus a <HI>Robber and Villain</HI> should rely upon that Faith, when he has forfeited it; and claim Protection from the <HI>Gallows</HI> or the <HI>Gibbet,</HI> or from being shot down it he can∣not be brought to Punishment any other Way?

The Author of CATO'S <HI>Letters</HI> very justly observes, that <Q>It is a most wicked and abs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Position, to say, that a People can ever be in such a Situation, as not to have a Right to oppose a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> a <HI>Robber,</HI> or a <HI>Traitor,</HI> who, by <HI>Violence, Treachery, Rapine,</HI> infinite <HI>Murders</HI> and <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vastations,</HI> has deprived them of Safety and Protection.</Q></P>
<Q><P>It was a known Maxim of Liberty amongst the great, the wise, the free Antients, that a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> or a <HI>Traytor,</HI> was a <HI>Beast of Prey,</HI> which might be killed by a Spear as well as by a fair Chace; in his <HI>Court</HI> as well as in his <HI>Camp;</HI> that <HI>every</HI> Man had a Right to destroy One, who would

<P>If we read the Stories of the most celebrated Heroes of Antiquity, (Men of whom the present World is not wor∣thy) and consider the Actions that gained them their high∣est Reverence and Renown, and recommended their Names to Posterity with the most Advantage, we shall find those in the first Rank of Glory, who have resisted, destroy'd or expell'd <HI>Traitors</HI> and <HI>Tyrants,</HI> the <HI>Pests,</HI> the <HI>Burthens,</HI> and the <HI>Batche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of Mankind.—And indeed such an Action could never have been censured in the World, if there had not lived in all Ages, abject Flatterers, and servile Crea∣tures of Power, always prepared to sanctify and abet the most enormous Wickedness, if it were gainful: And these are they who have often misled good Men in the worst Prejudices.</P>

<P>Have we not read of Men who have killed themselves, ra∣ther than become a Prey to a merciless Enemy—<HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius,</HI> the <HI>Decii, Otho, Celanus, Cato,</HI> and many others, have done this, prefering Death to Slavery.—Most strange then! that the killing of a few treacherous Savages, who by their Perfidy, had forfeited their Lives, should be esteemed so enormous a Crime!—But we are told that this Action
<PB N="25" REF="009594_0025_0F76DC6F0DD89610"/>
was a Breach of the Rites of <HI>Hospitality, which, Heathens, Turks, Saracens, Moors, Negroes</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> have held more sacred than the PAXTONIANS. The Author here prostitutes his own good Sense, and contrary to the known Rules of Logic and sound Reason, draws an universal Conclusion from particular Premises: As well might he argue that <HI>Goliah</HI> was a Giant, and so were all the Soldiers in the Army of the <HI>Philistines;</HI> or <HI>David</HI> spared <HI>Saul</HI> asleep in the Cave, and therefore he spared all his Enemies.</P>
<P>Would the Limits I have prescribed to myself in this Let∣ter allow me, I could easily shew you, that every one of those Nations have, in a Thousand Instances, violated the Laws of Hospitality, and Faith too, in a much higher Degree than these People could possibly have been guilty of.—But with∣out carrying you through <HI>Homer,</HI> old <HI>Legends,</HI> and <HI>fabulous Travels</HI> and <HI>Voyages—</HI> if you look into your <HI>Bible,</HI> you will find a very notable instance, which will set this Matter right.—We read in the 4th Chapter of <HI>Judges,</HI> that when <HI>Israel</HI> was sold into the Hands of <HI>Jabin,</HI> King of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Captain of whose Army was <HI>Sisera,</HI> who had nine hun∣dred Chariots of Iron, and had mightily oppressed the Chil∣dren of Israel for 20 Years; the Lord at last, by his Instru∣ments <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> delivered <HI>Israel</HI> from <HI>Jabin</HI> and <HI>Sisera.</HI>—<Q>And the Lord discomfited <HI>Sisera,</HI> and all his Chariots, and all his Host with the Edge of the Sword, before <HI>Barak;</HI> so that <HI>Sisera</HI> lighted down off his Chariot, and fled away on his Feet, to the Tent of <HI>Jael,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Heber</HI> the <HI>Kenite:</HI> For there was Peace between Jabin the King of Hazor, and the House of <HI>Heber</HI> the <HI>Kenite.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And <HI>Jael</HI> went out to meet <HI>Sisera,</HI> and said unto him, Turn in, my Lord, turn into me, <HI>fear not:</HI> And when he had turned in unto her into the Tent, she covered him with a Mantle,</Q> (or Blanket, as you find it express'd in the Margin.)</P>
<Q><P>And he said unto her, give me, I pray thee, a little Water to drink, for I am thirsty; and she opened a Bot∣tle of Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and gave him Drink, and covered him.</P>
<P>Again he said unto her, stand in the Door of the Tent, and it shall be when any Man doth come and enquire of thee and say, Is there any Man here? that thou shall say, No.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="009594_0026_0F76DC6FA1718600"/>
Then <HI>Jael, Heber</HI>'s Wife, took a Nail of the Tent, and took an Hammer in her Hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the Nail in his Temples, and fastened it into the Ground; (for he was fast asleep and weary) so he died.</P></Q>
<P>Now was this Action (which has every Appearance of Cruelty in it) deemed a Breach of Faith, or a Violation of the Rites of Hospitality? No.—In the 5th Chapter we find the Angel of the Lord pronouncing a Blessing upon her; no doubt for ridding the World of an Oppressor, and a cruel V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lain—<Q>Blessed above Women shall <HI>Jael</HI> the Wife of <HI>He∣ber</HI> the <HI>Kenite</HI> be, blessed shall she be above Women in the Tent.</Q></P>
<Q><P>He asked <HI>Water,</HI> and she gave him <HI>Milk,</HI> she brought forth <HI>Butter</HI> in lordly Dish.</P>
<P>She put her Hand to the Nail, and her right Hand to the Workman's Hammer; and with the Hammer she smote <HI>Sisera,</HI> she smote off his Head, when she had pierced and stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken through his Temples.</P>
<P>At her Feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down, there he lay down dead.</P></Q>
<P>In the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> we have another Instance no less re∣markable than the above—We find that <HI>Judith</HI> killed <HI>Ho∣lofernes</HI> even deceitfully, when it could be done no other Way.—<HI>Holofernes</HI> was the chief Captain of the Army of <HI>Assur,</HI> who made War against <HI>Israel;</HI> and when he was go∣ing out against them, he threaten'd in these Words;—<Q>I will go forth in my Wrath, and will cover the whole Earth with the Feet of my Army, and I will give them for a Spoil unto them:—So that their Slain shall fill their Valleys and Brooks, and the River shall be filled with their Dead, till it overflow—And I will lead them Cap∣tives to the utmost Parts of the Earth.</Q></P>
<P>But <HI>Judith,</HI> a Widow, of whom it was said—<Q>There was none that gave her an ill Word; for she feared GOD greatly</Q>— I say, this good Woman, having humbled herself, and prayed to God to prosper her Purpose, went over to the Camp of the Enemy; and being taken by the Watch and conducted to <HI>Holofernes,</HI> she declared to him that she had fled from her own Nation—<Q>Now therefore, my
<PB N="27" REF="009594_0027_0F76DC705B48A268"/>
Lord, (says she) I will remain with thee, and thy Servant will go out by Night into the Valley, and I will pray unto God, and he will tell me when they have committed their Sins.</Q></P>
<Q><P>And I will come and shew it unto thee: Then thou shalt go forth with all thine Army, and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee.</P>
<P>And I will lead thee through the Midst of <HI>Judea,</HI> un∣til thou come before <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and I will set thy Throne in the Midst thereof, and thou shalt drive them as Sheep that have no Shepherd, and a Dog shall not so much as open his Mouth at thee.</P></Q>
<P>Yet notwithstanding these Declarations we find that when she was left alone in the Tent, and found <HI>Holofernes</HI> drunk, and lying upon his Bed—<Q>She came to the Pillar of the Bed which was at <HI>Holofernes'</HI> Head, and took down his Faulchion from thence, and approached to his Bed, and took hold of the Hair of his Head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this Day. And she smote twice upon his Neck with all her Might, and she took away his Head from him.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which Ozias said unto her, <Q>O Daughter, blessed art thou of the most high God, above all the Women upon the Earth; and blessed be the Lord God, which hath created the Heavens and the Earth, which hath di∣rected thee to the cutting off the Head of the Chief of our Enemies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And God turn these Things to thee for a perpetual Praise, to visit thee in good Things, because thou hast not spared thy Life for the Affiliction of our Nation, but hast revenged our Ruin, walking a straight Way before our God. And all the People said, So be it, So be it.</Q></P>
<P>But no doubt it will be objected here, that these were not <HI>Christians</HI>— And perhaps I might be challeng'd to produce an Example from any <HI>"civiliz'd Nation in Europe"</HI>—Left you should be prevailed upon to believe that it was not in my Power to answer such a Challenge, I shall give you an In∣stance of the horrid Cruelty and Inhumanity of a <HI>civilized Nation,</HI> whose Honour and Hospitality the Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> has taken great Pains to applaud and extol; and
<PB N="28" REF="009594_0028_0F76DC7148205280"/>
I am induced to point out this Fact in particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at it hap∣pened in our own Time, and in our own Country.</P>
<P>In the Year 1746, or 1747, a <HI>Spanish Privateer</HI> entered the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> and proceeded almost up to <HI>Newcastle:</HI> The Crew went on Shore, and plundered two or more Plan∣tations—On their Return they met with, and attacked, an English Ship commanded by Captain <HI>Brown,</HI> who gallantly defended himself, till being overpowered, he was obliged at last to strike and submit; but the <HI>Spanish Officers</HI> were so exasperated at the gallant and brave Defence he made, for which a generous and merciful Enemy would have esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and honour'd him, that they barbarously <HI>stabb'd</HI> and <HI>mur∣der'd</HI> him, tho' an humble Suppliant on his Knees, begging Quarter, and praying them to spare his Life!</P>
<P>What need I adduce any further Instances than these? If killing the Indians in <HI>Lancaster</HI> County, was a Violation of the Laws of Faith and <HI>Hospitality,</HI> I must then declare it, as my Opinion, that every Nation under Heaven, have been guilty of this Crime in a much higher Degree than the <HI>Pax∣ton People,</HI> and with les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Provocation.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> tells us, that <Q>ONE HUN∣DRED and FORTY Indians yet remain (he should have said are yet maintained, caressed and cherish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d) in this Go∣vernment.</Q></P>
<P>I do not pretend to know the Motives of the Government for so doing; they perhaps knew little of the true Character of these Savages; perhaps they were hurried into it by the Importunities of a Faction; but this we firmly believe, that no other Colony on this Continent would chuse to follow their Example. The Province of <HI>New York,</HI> with great good Sense and Policy, and with a proper Spirit of of Indig∣nation against such perfidious Wretches, refus'd them even a Passage through their Territories.— But the <HI>humane,</HI> the <HI>merciful,</HI> the <HI>charitable Pennsylvania,</HI> can receive these <HI>Vil∣lains</HI> and <HI>Murderers</HI> into her Bosom,<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">It is well known to some of the Officers now in Philadelphia, that many of those Indians were engag'd against Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> and his brave Men.—The Murderer of <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ton,</HI> has been visited and comforted; a warm Bed and Stove have been set up for him, while many of our <HI>Fel∣low-Christians,</HI> less criminal th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him, have been neglected; and left to struggle with their Misery and Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, in the Dungeon.—That the <HI>Moravian</HI> Indians have been Traytors to us, is prov'd by one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of one <HI>Thomas Moore,</HI> who being sworn on the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Evange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s, before the chief Burgess of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> has declar'd, that during his four Years Captivity with the Indians, they had frequent Intelligence and Advice of the Motions of the English, from the <HI>Bethleh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Indians,</HI> who came constantly among them, and kept up a Correspondence with them.</NOTE> disoblige three

<P>Is it any Wonder then if the unhappy Frontier People were really <HI>mad with Rage,</HI> (as they express themselves) under such cruel Treatment?—Shall <HI>Heathens,</HI> shall <HI>Traytors,</HI> shall <HI>Rebels</HI> and <HI>Murderers</HI> be protected, cloathed and fed?

the Paws of the Enemy, to be equalled in all the Volumes of History. Figure to yourself some Thousands of Families, seated in Ease and Plenty, enjoying every Necessary of Life, which hard Labour and Industry had procured for them; without a Moment's Warning, and in the Shades of Night, driven from their Habitations; and obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e through a lonely tractless Wilderness, without so much as knowing whither they directed their trembling Steps — When the Morning arrives— O what a Scene does it discover — The Husband lamenting his murder'd faithful Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e —The Wife tearing her Hair in all the Horror of Distress, shrieking, and calling upon her breathless Husband to hasten to her Relief!—<HI>Rachael</HI> weeping for her dear Children, who are now no more!—<HI>Here</HI> lies the provident Father welt'ring in his own Blood, hit Scalp tore off, his Body ript up, his Bowels dragg'd out, and his private Parts stuffed into his Mouth!<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">These are no aggravated Scenes, in order to raise the Commisse∣ration of the Reader; they are shocking Matters of Fact: It was done in the GREAT COVE.</NOTE>—<HI>There</HI> the virtuous tender Mother lies stretched on her Bed, dreadfully mangled, with her new-born Infant scalp'd and placed under her Head for a Pillow, and a Stake drove into her—Modesty forbids me to say more!<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">This was near <HI>Shippensburg.</HI></NOTE>—On <HI>this Side</HI> lie the Bodies of a numerous Family, half devoured by Wolves and Swine!<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">In Sheerman's Valley; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Cumberland County.</NOTE>—On <HI>that Side</HI> lie the mangled Limbs of Men, Women, Children, and Brute Beasts, promisc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ously scattered upon the Earth,<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><HI>James Smith,</HI> Son of <HI>Robert Smith,</HI> late of Chester County, who was a Captive four Years and an half among the Indians, reports, that he at sundry Times saw the Remains of mangled Bodies in the Woods, that were burnt by the Indians; and that the Captives told him they were Witnesses to these horrid Cruelties exercised towards their Fellow Captives, sometimes only for attempting to escape; and that this was done even by the Tawawaas, the gentlest of the Savages.</NOTE> scarce to be distinguished from one another —Or perhaps the Bodies of these unhappy Peo∣ple, with their Horses, their Cattle, their Houses and their Grain, all burnt to Ashes in one general Flame!<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">This was the dismal Fate of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adenhutten, a <HI>Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vian</HI> Village, in Northampton.</NOTE></P>

I may well cry out in the Language of the NARRATIVE, <Q>Unhappy People!—to have liv'd in such Times, and by such Neighbours▪</Q>—If the Characters of the several Nation, with which the Author of this Piece has fur∣nish'd us, be just—I am sure these unhappy Frontier-People would have been safer and better protected in any of those Nations, than they have been in a <HI>Quaker Government</HI>—"They would have been safer among the antient <HI>Heathens,"</HI> by whom, it seems, <Q>they would have been considered as <HI>Guests</HI> of the Publick, and the Religion of the Country would have operated in their Favour—They would have been safer, if they had submitted to TURKS,</Q> or had come under their Protection—<Q>They would have been safer a∣mong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ARAC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NS, if they had once drank Water with them—They would have been safer among the MOORS of SPAIN, it Faith had once been pledg'd to them, and a Promise of Protection given—They would have been safer among POPISH SPANIARDS, if they had been in Dis∣tress—They would have been safer among the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ORO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S of AFRICA, where at least one manly Soul would have been found, with Sense, Spirit, and Humanity enough to stand in their Defence— In short, it appears that they would have been safe in any Part of the known World—except in the Neighbourhood of the RELENTLESS and OB∣STINATE QUAKERS of PENNSYLVANIA!</Q></P>
<P>But Complainings (you will say) cannot mend the Matter.—What then is to be done —Have there been any Re∣medies provided against future Misfortunes?—Must these unhappy People still crouch beneath their Sufferings?—Or will not the Government go into any Measures to redress them?—It would be cruel as well as absurd, to suppose it will not.—To stifle the Notions of Revenge, it prudent and religious in private Persons—And I hope these People will never again be reduced to the disagreeable Necessity of proceeding as they did—The <HI>executive Part</HI> of the Go∣vernment, at least, deserves their Esteem and Affection. I trust therefore, they will never do any Thing that may bring their Obedience and Regards to the LAWS and MA∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ISTRACY of their Country in Question.—But at the
<PB N="33" REF="009594_0033_0F76DC75C9A836B8"/>
same Time, it is undoubtedly true, that a proper Spirit of JEALOUSY, and REVENGE too, in a People who are op∣press'd and injur'd, is a politick and commendable Virtue; without which they will never be valued or respected.—Upon such Occasions, I think they should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse the Spirit of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> PEOPLE, and make it appear by all <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>loyal</HI> Methods, that they scorn to be any longer the Property of a Faction— And that they have a Right to <HI>demand,</HI> and to <HI>receive</HI> Protection.</P>
<P><HI>Salus Populi suprema Lex esto;</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Sentence that deserves to be written in Letters of Gold—It is a Sentence that should be the MOTTO of every Government, where LIBERTY and FREEDOM have any Existence.</P>
<P>We are told that in the <HI>wise,</HI> the <HI>free</HI> Cities of ATHENS and ROME, <Q><HI>The awful Authority of the</HI> PEOPLE, <HI>the sacred Privileges of the</HI> PEOPLE, <HI>the inviolable Majesty of the</HI> PEO∣PLE, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unappealable Judgment of the</HI> PEOPLE, were com∣mon Phrases.</Q></P>
<P>But it seems that there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in PENNSYLVANIA, who (to us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Words of the great LO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>NO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> SIDNEY) look upon the People <Q>like <HI>Asses</HI> and <HI>Mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iff D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs,</HI> who ought to <HI>work</HI> and to <HI>fight,</HI> to be <HI>oppress'd</HI> and <HI>kill'd</HI> for them.</Q>—And that they have neither <HI>Privileg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Authority</HI> to complain of their Sufferings, or remonstrate their Grievances.</P>
<P>However, I would have such Men know, that (whatever contracted Sentiments they may entertain) as a Patriot Wri∣ter justly observes, "It is the undoubted Right of the Peo∣ple, and acknowledg'd to be so in the <HI>Bill of Rights</HI> pass'd in the Reign of King CHARLES I. and since by the <HI>Act of Set∣tlement</HI> of the CROW<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the REVOLUTION, to represent their publick Grievances, and to petition for Redress to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e whose Duty it is to right them, or to see them righted: And it is certain, that in all Countries, the People's Misfortunes are greater or less, in Proportion as this Right is encourag'd or check'd."</P>
<P>It is indeed the best and only just Way that they can take to breathe their Grievances; and whenever this Way has been taken even KINGS have always accepted their Appli∣cation.— The PARLIAMENTS of GREAT BRITAIN too, who are the grand Barriers of our LIBERTY, have always
<PB N="34" REF="009594_0034_0F76DC76682F3F28"/>
shewn themselves ready and willing to receive the Complaints of their Principals, and to apply quick Remedies to the Grievances contain'd in them.— It has, indeed, been al∣ways thought highly imprudent, not to say dangerous, to resist the Groans of the People, utter'd in this Manner.</P>
<P>This has been a Method, which has always had great Weight with good Men, and has always been a great Terror to Bad.—It has therefore always been encourag'd or dis∣courag'd, according to the Innocence or Guilt of Men in Power.</P>
<P>TITUS and TRAJAN, conscious of their own virtuous Ad∣ministration and worthy Purposes, encourag'd Addresses and Informations of this Kind, from their People:—They wisely knew, that if the ROMAN People had free Leave to <HI>speak,</HI> they would not take Leave to <HI>act;</HI>—and that whilst they could have <HI>Redress,</HI> "they would not seek <HI>Revenge.</HI>"</P>
<P>I shall now conclude, Sir, with this Request to you, that you will advise your visionary QUAKERS and DON QUIXOTES, to consider these Things—And, that instead of yoking themselves to CANNON, and dragging them along to defend BARRACKS, and fight WIND-MILLS, they will suffer the Complaints of the People to be heard, their Grievances re∣dress'd, and their Country rescued from total Ruin.—That they will immediately remove the INDIANS, or whatever else may create their Jealousy, and give them Cause to murmur.— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd then we may expect to feel the happy Effects resul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing from LIBERTY and LAW—to see the Quiet of the Pro∣vince restor'd—and the Harmony and good Order of Govern∣ment re-establish'd amongst us.</P>
