<HEAD>THE CANDID RETROSPECT.</HEAD>
<P>THE political creed of America (for I make no esti∣mate of two parties, who taken together are a <HI>Mi∣nority</HI> of the continent) may be comprised in the twelve following articles.</P>
<P N="1">I. Every nation has authority to frame such a govern∣ment for itself, as will, without injury to others, be most conducive to its own felicity.</P>
<P N="2">II. The national sovereignty under every form of go∣vernment whether in the hands of one, or of many per∣sons, or however modelled, is absolute; for no State can exist, if any of its members may by force or fraud attempt its subversion with impunity: And therefore, every na∣tion punishes treason, or an attempt tending to overturn the constitution, as the highest crime of which a subject can be guilty.</P>
<P N="3">III. No man can be innocent, even <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro Conscienti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> in an endeavour to change the government of his country, if the meditated revolution will light up a civil war, and the miseries in prospect are likely to exceed those, which the community have been accustomed to endure.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The establishments made in America by English emigrants and their associates, <HI>might</HI> in the early day of the colonies, if the parent country had been so determined, have been prevented or broken up.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Lords and Commons of England, being con∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sant of the grants and charters of their Kings and Queens, for the encouragement of the colonies, and of the transactions under them; and afterwards co-operating
<PB N="4" REF="016729_0003_0F9DF04A2E194118"/>for regulating the plantations, rendering them secure a∣gainst foreign invasions and useful to Great-Britain, they cannot therefore be considered as <HI>merely Royal,</HI> but Parli∣amentary, or national establishments.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The grants and charters to the colonies, and the posterior settlements, regulations and usages by the per∣mission, and with the knowledge or privity, and without the interdiction of Parliament, are incontestible proofs of a great national covenant between the Mother Country and the colonies, for her favours (which undeniably have been many and great) by inspiring the Colonists with confidence, and exposing them to hazardous and ex∣pensive undertakings, created rights; and gratitude never obliges to returns and surrenders, incompatible with those rights which are essential to the felicity of the receiver of the benefits.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Before the year 1764, the King, Lords and Com∣mons, were universally acknowledged to be the supreme law-givers of the whole empire; of which the colonies were members.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The national c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enant bound the parent country to protect and promote the colonies, according to the good faith implied in the grants and charters, and other royal and national acts in their favour, as far as was consitient with the general weal of all the dispersions of the nation; and it obliged the plantations to submit to her authority, in all cases not repugnant to their grants, charters and establishments; and to such acts aad contributions, as were necessary for the <HI>common</HI> defence and felicity of the empire.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Neither of the contracting parties may dissolve this compact, as lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as their joint aim in the union, to wit, <HI>their mutual</HI> prosperity, can be attained by it.</P>
<P N="10">X. As no provision was made for constituting an impar∣tial Judge between them, to bridle or correct the partiality or infidelity of either party, therefore their controversies
<PB N="5" REF="016729_0004_0F9DF04CA5AB0930"/>are to be decided by negotiation and treaty, or on appeal by battle to the Lord of Hosts; for neither is obliged to surrender its essential rights at the <HI>will</HI> of the other, and each is justifiable in exerting its own self-preserving powers.</P>
<P N="11">XI. When one of them wants either will or ability to fulfil its engagements, the other, if not instrumental to this disaffection or impotence, will be discharged from the original obligation. But,</P>
<P N="12">XII. Since amongst imperfect beings offences are inevi∣table, the contractors are by the laws of a judge who can∣not be deceived, reciprocally bound, upon exceptions ta∣ken, to pursue every measure of a re-conciliatory nature, consistent with the end of the union; and to such mutual condescensions, as tend to the re-establishment of the ge∣neral felicity, peace and harmony: And this is the more eminently their duty, since the empire consists of <HI>other</HI> branches, which have offended neither of the parties at strife, and will nevertheless be ruined if the controversy ends in a separation,</P>
<P>In the application of these principles to the present quar∣rel, perhaps neither Great-Britain nor America will ap∣pear to be without blame.</P>
<P>What a new and awful idea of the constitution did the Parent Country hold up to her Colonies, at the passing of the stamp act! Her language was this:</P>
<P>"You Americans are absolutely ours. We may dis∣pose of your persons, your commerce, your lands and ac∣quisitions as we please. You have no rights. The grants of our Kings to your ancestors do not bind this nation. The privileges and securities of Englishmen cannot be yours unless you return to the old realm. Our ancient indulgences were <HI>temporary</HI> permissions, from which you can deduce no title to <HI>permanent</HI> enjoyments. Your plea that our Commons are not of your electing, and that we and they are interested in the increase of your burdens,
<PB N="6" REF="016729_0005_0F9DF04D898CFA10"/>can come with propriety only from the mouth of a British inhabitant —All America is subject to our taxations; nor will we hear your complaints, until you first own our authority to deal with you as we please, and acknowledge that such benefits as you request, are to be expected not as of right, but of grace."</P>
<P>Had England such principles at the first emigrations, she was bound to declare them to the adventurers, before they gave themselves to the winds and the seas, to gain her a share of the wealth and commerce of the new world, by which her island has been converted into a <HI>Nation of Princes.</HI></P>
<P>But thus she never did speak till this memorable aera; and therefore the Colonies were in consternation at the haughty tone, uttering this novel explanation of the nature of the union. They remonstrated—they resisted —and the instant Great-Britain took off the new burden, America re∣garded her <HI>deeds</HI> more than her words, submitting without cavalling, to that rational sovereignty she had formerly ex∣ercised, to the common advantage of the empire.</P>
<P>The grand desideratum of the moment in which the stamp-act was repealed (1766) was some plan for obtain∣ing in future the reasonable contributions of the Colonies for the <HI>common defence,</HI> consistent with the supremacy of Parliament and the freedom of America, either in the old or in some new and unexceptionable mode. If assemblies were <HI>no longer</HI> to be trusted, for grants on seperate requisi∣tions from the Crown (though the Colonies had in this way the credit of having overacted their parts) an Ameri∣can Parliament might have been constituted to <HI>insure</HI> and <HI>quicken</HI> the supplies; or permanent funds might have been set a part in every plantation for their quotas to the nati∣onal charge, rising and falling with the commerce of a co∣lony, perfectly consistent with <HI>their</HI> safety and the <HI>national supremacy,</HI> and requisite for the union and direction of their
<PB N="7" REF="016729_0006_0F9DF04DF0947A48"/>force: But to the astonishment of common sense, Great-Britain, blind to futurity, and anxious only for present peace, contented herself with an empty declaration of her authority to bind the colonies <HI>in all cases whatsoever;</HI> and as if this would have prevented America from indulging jealousies, or have induced her to slide into security and confidence, she absurdly enrolled it among her laws. Easy themselves, the ministers of the day, devised nothing to counteract the poison administered by their predecessors, and seemed to be regardless of the durable interests of the Monarch they served, and the nation who resigned to their counsels. But to proceed, we remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the present animosities are imputable to the pride and avarice of Great-Britain, in assuming an au∣thority, inconsistent with the compact by which the em∣pire had been long prosperously united. The colonies had the merit of returning to their submission, as soon as they were disburdened of the stamp-duties, the irritating asser∣tion of a right to despotic sovereignty over them notwith∣standing. They remained quiet till Mr. Townshend re∣vived the old claim in a new form, by imposing duties upon paper, paint, &amp;c. for raising a revenue, subversive of the Colony Legislatures and the ancient customs of he empire.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Colonies were justifiable in censuring the new law devised to execute the tea duty act; for that aim∣ing to enforce the claim of absolute sovereignty obliged to some conduct or declaration against an unconditional sub∣mission—<HI>Perhaps</HI> it justified the open violation to which they resorted.—Representations and petitions having been tried without effect, what could be expected from the mere influence of dissuasions against the purchase of the dutied article? Had not the patriot dissuader to apprehend pro∣secution and ruin, unless when imprisoned, his country∣men would rise up against the government for his redemp∣tion?
<PB N="8" REF="016729_0007_0F9DF04EB3837448"/>And which measure was least exceptionable, the de∣struction of the commodity, or the rupture of gaols, for a deliverance of the prisoners in the confederacy, and the sudden overturning of the Colony Government for defeat∣ing the <HI>regular</HI> course of the law?</P>
<P>That the resentment of Great-Britain, on the destruc∣tion and expulsion of the tea cargoes, manifested in the co∣ercive measures of 1774, by altering the charter of the Massachusetts Bay, extinguishing the commerce of Boston, collecting an army there, rendering the soldiery dispunish∣able for the shedding of blood, modelling the province of Quebec favourable to the designs of compulsion and vio∣lence, was utterly unjustifiable, and an infraction of the league, which obliged Great-Britain to protect the colo∣nies; and these severities were the more inexcusable, since to that moment her sovereignty in <HI>all cases</HI> (the matter of taxation excepted) had not been denied by the Colonies; but was by all their courts, and in all their proceedings, confessed or implied, adjudged, <HI>and</HI> supported.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the provinces were not blameable in forming a Congress, to unite their counsels and ward off danger, as they did in September 1774.</P>
<P N="5">5. That it was the duty of the American Assemblies, and of the Congress acting for the whole continent, <HI>at that</HI> time to tender a plan to the Mother Country, for restoring peace, consistent with the compact, by which the Parlia∣ment of Great-Britain was to enjoy a supremacy for the common felicity of the empire; and consequently, that the declaration they then made, of the right of the colonies to an <HI>exclusive legislation,</HI> not only in cases of taxation but of <HI>internal polity,</HI> subject only to the negative of their so∣vereign, was a departure in terms from the original league; since it left no authority to the Parliament of Great-Britain over the Plantations, except for the regulation of the <HI>ex∣ternal</HI> commerce of the empire; and gave vigour to the
<PB N="9" REF="016729_0008_0F9DF04F7A323D38"/>jealousy <HI>before</HI> excited, by the misrepresentations of their enemies, of a design to maintain an inauspicious union and confederacy with the <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and not with the <HI>Le∣gislature and People</HI> of Great-Britain; and that the intima∣tion of the same Congress, of the willingness of the colo∣nies, to acquiesce in their condition, <HI>prior to</HI> 1763, gave Great-Britain no sufficient ground to expect their submis∣sion, to the ancient acknowledged claims of her Parlia∣ment; since the repeal of the offensive statutes, <HI>without a retraction</HI> of the denial of her legislative authority, would, by a violent implication, establish the <HI>Congress's declara∣tion,</HI> and amount to a consent, that America was thence∣forth to be the Ally of Great-Britain, and not what the Congress, at <HI>that very time,</HI> averred her to be, a Member of the Empire. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract from that part of the Proceedings of the Continental Congress, assembled at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, 5th of September, 1774, which was called "The American Bill of Rights."
<P><Q>The inhabitants of the English Colonies in North-America, by the immutable law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of nature, the principles of the English Constitution, and the several char∣ters or comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, have the following Rights.</Q></P>
<P>After affirming in the three first resolves, That the Americans are entitled to Life, Liberty and Property; that their ancestors had at the time of their emigra∣tion, all the rights, liberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects within the realm; that they were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the emigration, and that their de∣scendants have a right to enjoy such of them, as consist with their local circumstan∣ces, it is</P>
<P><Q>Resolved 4thly, That the foundation of English liberty and of all free govern∣ment, is a right in the people to participate in their Legislative Councils; and as the English Colonies are not represented, and from their local and other cir∣cumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British Parliament, they are entitled to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree and exclusive power of legislation, in their several Provincial legislatures; where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and INTERNAL POLITY, subject only to the negative of their Sovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed. But from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual interests of both coun∣tries, we cheerfully CONSENT to the operation of such acts of the British Parlia∣ment, as are 'bona fide' restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purposes of securing the commercial advantages of the whole Empire to the Mother Country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members; ex∣cluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects in America without their consent.</Q></P>
<P>Can it be doubted that the party who introduced this resolve, had any other de∣sign than the severance of the Empire? Precluded as Great-Britain was to be in fu∣ture, from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of legislation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ting the internal polity of every colony, how then could she check practices injurious to the common weal? she must rely, said the independant, upon the vigilance and fidelity of her Sovereigns: What? let can∣dour answer it, had the people of Great-Britain nothing to fear from their Kings? from Kings at the head of Colonies, that have already (even without the aid of the Crown) braved all the rest of the Empire? nay what security would those Monarchs have had for the continuance of their power.</P>
<P>But the Congress consented (a term properly used after the whole authority of Parliament had been denied) to be subject to the laws of trade; and with this the honest and simple hearted Americans were contented, for few of them were aware of the craft which tacked to every such law, a condition to render it nugatory and void, unless while it continued the advantages of the commerce to Great-Britain, I should say, of the external commerce of the whole Empire, it secured at the same time, the commercial benefits of its respective members. An insidious addition, which brought some Delegates within doors, and thousands without, to approve in terms, a sentiment which in their hearts they abhorred. Is it in the understanding of man, to frame an act of trade, that will be proof against the cavils, to which such an article gave an handle? And would not the assent to it as a fundamental of the union, have set every colony upon the high ground of a contracting potentate; au∣thorised to resist by violence, what she might not be able to prevent by dissuasion? It was only to shew that an act of Parliament was not so beneficial to the Empire, or any part of it, as it might have been, to be void, and as easy to foresee that this principle admitted, it was impossible to pen a law, that would be valid in all or any of the Provinces. In short, if Great-Britain had run into one extreme for asserting her right to bind the Colonies in all cases whatsoever, was it not equally extrava∣gant to hold that she could bind us in none? I shall not disparage America, by assert∣ing that there were no persons here who discerned and detested at the day of these transactions, the design and tendency of this article of the declaration of rights; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere were, and with grief we must add, that there were members of that very Con∣gress, who, then overreached, have since died of vexation; as well as others, who to avoid the like imputation, sacrifice integrity to pride, and boast of being from the beginning in that plot, which has cost their coumtrymen an ocean of blood. Thousands must be able to point to the men, once as loud in denying, as they are at present in owning, the intention of severing that Empire from the year 1774. They have my consent for the fame they aspire after, and that what they wished to be be∣lieved, may never be questioned till that happy day, when themselves shall find safety, in producing the proofs they now are desirous to conceal.</P>
<P>Is it asked, what should have been substituted for the resolve we condenm? I an∣swer, one safe to America and not injurious to the rest of the Empire. Had the De∣legates of that day the general felicity in their eye, might we not have looked for something like the following declaration as most consistent with the safety and sen∣timents of those, with whose lives and fortunes they were intrusted?</P>
<P>The foundation of English liberty and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their Legislative Council. The Colonists are not, and from local and other circumstances cannot, be represented as the inhabitants of the ancient realm are, in the British Parliament. If only the objects of the bounty and care, and not contributory to the burdens of the parent nation, they could not complain of their not participating in her councils. But the case was altered after the Provi∣dence of God had enabled them to sustain, and we called them to bear, a part of the general charge for the common defence of the British stock, now dispersed in all quarters of the world. America has no unnatural desire to shrink from the load, but declares herself willing to submit to an equitable ratio. She expects it from the wis∣dom and justice of the Parent State to set limits to her power, that Great-Britain will abstain from all measures directly and indirectly tending to levy taxes, and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ements and innovations for humbling the Colonies into a base devotion to her arbitrary pleasure. She has drawn aids from them by her commercial regulations. Let a council be convoked to deliberate upon a settlement, to ascertain what con∣tributions the Provinces shall afford in future, for the protection she ought not to refuse.</P>
<P>Such language as this could only have offended those, who meant to subject us to despotism: And it must be confessed to the honour of Great-Britain, that she threw out the first hint for an accommodation of differences by compact, in the resolve of the 20th of February, 1775. It is at the same time the misfortune of the Colonies, that their leaders preferred a defiance of her power to the tenders of her love. Look at the sullen answer to the conciliatory declaration, entered in the Congress minutes of the 31st of July, 1775, an answer too, unfairly suspended from the pre∣ceding April, that the multitude might in the interval, be the better prepared to approve its insidious contents. What incredible pains were taken to practise upon the Provincial Congresses, and inculcate the ludicrous idea uttered in Parliament, that liberty was set up at auction, to be sold to the Provinces bidding highest? And how grateful the poison of that parricide, to an inflamed populace, gulled into a destructive war, by the hope of paying nothing towards the charge for supporting and defending the liberties they enjoyed! Miserable Americans! say now who are your foes!</P></NOTE></P>

6. That it would not have been inconsistent with the dignity of Great-Britain, if instead of declaring war against her Colonies, as in the joint address of the Lords and Com∣mons to the King in January, 1775, she had animadvert∣ed upon the denial of her authority in all cases respecting internal polity, as <HI>an error;</HI> and have specified in what particulars the Americans should be restored to a <HI>uti posi∣detis</HI> relative to their charters, patents, assemblies, elec∣tions, and modes of government, &amp;c. on condition of their contributing to the necessities of the Empire. And that the parliamentary vote of the 20th of February, 1775, would have more naturally effected a treaty of reconcilia∣tion, had it <HI>explicitly</HI> asserted, that the right reserved to Parliament, of <HI>approving</HI> the quantum of the Colony con∣tributions towards the common defence, was not claimed
<PB N="11" REF="016729_0010_0F9DF0514F43F580"/>upon the supposition, that Parliament authoritatively com∣mand levies, but only on her right to judge of the exercise or defect of a due sympathy in any branch of the empire, to the general necessities of the whole body; and especially if Great-Britain had at the same time intimated a readiness to consent to such checks, limitations and restraints, as might be necessary to insure the application of them, to
<PB N="12" REF="016729_0011_0F9DF051AF33E490"/>the end for which they were given; and had with these, promised a restitution of rights and <HI>act of oblivion.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>YOU will have sees in the King's answer to the joint address of both Houses of Parliament on the 7th of February, which address and answer have already been transmitted to you, how much attention his Majesty was most graciously pleased to give to the assurance held out in that address, of the readiness of Parliament to afford any just and reasonable indulgence to the Colonies, whenever they should make proper application on the ground of any real grievance they might have to complian of: And therefore I have the less occasion now, to enlarge upon the sa∣tisfaction it has given his Majesty, to see that address followed by the inclosed re∣solution of the House of Commons; which, whatever may be the effect of it, (I hope a happy one) will forever remain an evidence of their justice and moderation, and man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est the temper which has accompanied their deliberations upon that ques∣tion, which has been the source of so much disquiet to his Majesty's subjects in America, and a pretence for acts of such criminal disorder and disobedience.</P>

That it was a fault to issue that proposal, in terms <HI>capable</HI> of being construed, into an attachment to the prin∣ciple of unlimited submission, and accompanying it with acts for augmenting her force at Boston, and restraining the fishery and commerce of her Colonies, and for neg∣lecting to command a cessation of arms, until the Colonies had an opportunity to deliberate, with composure of mind, upon that proposal—more especially for her irritating sally to Concord and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exington, on the 19th of April 1775, when no Governor but Mr. Gage had received the Parlia∣ment's <HI>conciliatory resolve.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That as this vote, under these circumstances, and the partial direction of her wrath against the New-England Colonies, favoured the opinion of its being contrived, to deceive and divide the Provinces, the Congress of 1775, had some pretext for flying to arms, to repel further in∣cursions of the British troops, till Government gave them an opportunity, in a condition less alarming, to explain the declaration of 1774 into a <HI>consistency</HI> with the ancient supremacy of Parliament, and to state the limitations re∣quisite for their safety, in answer to the February resolu∣tion or proposal.</P>
<P N="9">9. That the total rejection of it in August 1775, and the neglect of the Congress to recall or explain the decla∣ration
<PB N="14" REF="016729_0013_0F9DF054D22C4860"/>of 1774, had natural tendency to exasperate the nation; and as the Continental successes in Canada, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the impotent state of the British army at Boston, did leave America in a condition for a more cool and deliberate con∣sideration of the controversy, than could have been expect∣ed <HI>immediately</HI> after the irritations at Lexington, Concord, and Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lestown, her Congress deserves the charge of abandoning to passion, if not to motives less excusable; it being then the palpable duty of both countries, by pro∣per agents in a confidential way, to state and explain their respective claims and desires.</P>
<P N="10">10. That the neglect of Great-Britain to supersede the orders to the navy, for sacrificing every town on the Ame∣rican coast, which should prepare for defence; and<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her continuance of hostilities after the petition to the King, preferred by Mr. Richard Pean in August 1775, submit∣ting it to his wisdom to point to some plan for the restora∣tion of harmony, confirmed the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of her commencing a war to maintain an illiberal dominion.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the Congress would have had merit with their countrymen, if instead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it to the King to direct <Q>to a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, by which the united applications of his faithful Colonists to the throne, in pursuance of their common councils, may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into a happy and permanent reconciliation;</Q> they had at the same time expressly assured his Majesty, that they meant not by their <HI>declaration of rights</HI> in 1774, to <HI>exclude</HI> Parliament from participating in the regulations respecting the <HI>internal</HI> po∣lity of the Colonies: And that an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ission so naturally confirming the suspicion of a design to involve the Empire in blood, by a struggle for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, discovers, <HI>at least</HI> great imperfection in the counsels of that Congress; as it was reasonable to suppose, that the petition would be compared with the principles and temper manifested in the preparations for an offensive war into Canada, and the
<PB N="15" REF="016729_0014_0F9DF055BA584398"/>disdainful rejection of the Parliament's proposal, of the month of February preceding.</P>
<P N="12">12. That every partial view, whether of Great Britain, to aggrandize herself by extortionate exactions from the Plantations, regardless of their felicity; or of America, to figure as an independent power, on the ruins of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the other Colonies, Factories and Settlements, is unrighteous in the sight of God; and upon the belief of the manifestation of his justice in the govern∣ment of nations, must expose to the correction of his irre∣sistible and unerring hand.</P>
<P N="13">13. Both countries being chargeable with inattention to the obligations they were under to pursue the measures requisite to a reconciliation, neither of them could reject terms consistent with the <HI>original compact,</HI> though no re∣imbursements were offered for the losses they had sustain∣ed. Add to this, that the controversy arose from—neglect in our <HI>early</HI> days, to concert such specifick stipulations as were necessary to prevent doubts and strife, and reconcile the safety of the Colonies with the general supremacy of Parliament; and that a definitive treaty restoring each country to a situation preferable to her primitive condition, afforded a reasonable security for her future felicity; Great-Britain's best hopes being founded on the dependence and union of America; and the Colonies being arrived at such a maturity of strength, as to command upon the principles of utility, a <HI>system of liberality,</HI> in the future management of their affairs.</P>
<P N="14">14. That Great Britain even in passing the <HI>prohibitory act</HI> of December 1775, opened a door to pacification, as it repealed the Boston port act. and the two other coercive statutes for restraining the fishery and the commerce of the Colonies; and enabling the Crown to appoint Commis∣sioners, to render the <HI>prohibiting act itself useless,</HI> upon a treaty to be made with the Colonies, or with any port or
<PB N="16" REF="016729_0015_0F9DF0562FB2E448"/>place within either of them; and more especially as the King's Ministers had so early as September (soon after the Congress's petition to the King) dispatched messengers, who in January 1776, had interviews with certain of the Delegates at Philadelphia, and made such intimations, as gave just ground to hope for an immediate termination of all differences had the Congress sent others on their part, to confess <HI>their</HI> willingness to <HI>negotiate</HI> upon the overtures, which Administration (then supposed by the Colonies or their Congress to have the lead of Parliament) stood ready to recommend to the national approbation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prohibitory Act of December 1775, authorized the making captures of American vessels, and though it repealed that for shutting up the port of Boston, and two others for restraining the commerce of the Colonies, and enabled the Crown to appoint Commissioners for opening negotiations to terminate the present animo∣sities, and to render all the denunciations of the prohibitory statute itself utterly in∣efficatious, in every Colony, County or Village desirous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> peace, yet it was artfully made a handle of to induce the multitude to believe, that they were thereby put out of the King's protection, except upon the terms of unconditional submission.
<P>How few not in Congress were at that time, or have since been informed of what all should have known, and upon which the collective body ought to have been con∣sulted, viz.</P>
<P>That Lord Drummond left England in September, 1775, three months before the passing of the prohibitory act, and after touching at Halit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Boston, arrived at New-York, and with Mr. Elliot, made a journey to the Congress at Philadelphia, in January 1776.</P>
<P>That it was then confidentially signified to certain of the Delegates attending there, that the Minister of the Court of Great-Britain was desirous of a treaty for a pacification of differences, upon the following equitable propositions.</P>
<P N="1">1. To assertain the proportion each Colony was able to contribute towards the common defence.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the supply should be raised by acts of Assembly, in duties upon imports or exports, most likely to keep pace with the growth or decline of the Colony.</P>
<P N="3">3. That other duties for regulating trade, should be paid into the Colony trea∣sury, and be subject to the disposal of the Assembly, and.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Great-Britain to renounce the claim of taxation, and depend for aids in all exigencies, upon the free gift of the Colonies.</P>
<P>It was also intimated that these points agreed, the repeal of the statutes offensive to America would follow; and such a limitation proposed for the quartering of troops, and the partition of them through the provinces, as to induce one of the then Delegates, to declare that he should consider them as hostages for the good behaviour of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It was at the same interview candidly hinted, that the mother country would arm at all points in the spring, and precede her operations by overtures for a treaty; and as a means to prevent even the arrival of the intended armaments, Lord Drummond urged, that Congress should declare themselves on these proposals, by special messengers of their own to go home immediately.</P>
<P>How this pacifick message was received, the people of any Colony may know, if they have spirit and power left under their present tyrants, to call the Delegates of that day to an examination upon oath. It is asserted that a motion was made in Congress, to commit their Messengers to close custody; and certainly true, that they were not dismissed till their paroles were exacted; and that much pains were taken to hide these momentous transactions from the publick eye. If the enquiry (which it imports every province to make into the conduct and fidelity of her agents) is not slovenly conducted, it will come out, that two of the Delegates sought a con∣veyance from New-York to England upon this business in February 1776, and that the design was relinquished, as soon as the news of an event in Virginia gave the party for the intended independency, advantages for subduing the common reluc∣tance of a great majority of the Continent, to advance to that dangerous precipice, from which they have launched so many of their credulous countrymen into the ocean of eternity; while scores of thousands remain behind them, in all the com∣plicated wretchedness of want and despair.</P>
<P>Such, America, was the patriotism of your leaders! Do you wonder that they who cheated you into ruin, have ever since practised the arts of delusion, to screen themselves from a detection, that must expose them to your vengeance?</P></NOTE></P>
<P N="15"><PB N="17" REF="016729_0016_0F9DF056EFC56E60"/>
15. That the concealment of these pre-intimations, so explanatory of the <HI>true intent</HI> of the armanents expected in June and July, 1776, and of the nature of the commission and instructions given to Lord and General Howe, added to the guilt of the Congress, and favored the perilous design of drawing the people into the precipitate renunci∣ation of the dependency of the Colonies, the 4th of July, 1776, and of plunging their countrymen into a tedious and desolating war. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract from the Prohibitory Act, called by some an Act to cast the Americans out of the King's Protection, passed 22d of December, 1775.
<P>After authorizing the capture of their vessels, &amp;c. there is this clause:—Provided always neverthelss, and it is hereby enacted by the authority aforesaid, That in order to encourage all well affected persons in any of the said Colonies, to exert themselves in suppressing the rebellion therein, and to afford a speedy protection to those who are disposed to return to their duty, it shall and may be lawful, to and for any person or persons appointed and authorized by his Majesty to grant a par∣don or pardons to any number or description of persons by proclamation, in his Majesty's name, to declare any Colony or Province, Colonies or Provinces, or any county, town, port, district or place in any Colony or Province, to be at the peace of his Majesty; and from and after the issuing of any such proclamation in any of the aforesaid Colonies or Provinces, or if his Majesty shall be graciously pleased to signify the same by his Royal Proclamation, then and after the issuing of the same, this act, with respect to such Colony or Province, Colonies or Provinces, county, town, port district or place, shall cease, determine and utterly void.</P>
<P>Extract from the Commission to Lord Howe and General Howe, dated 5th May, 1776.</P>
<P>After the power to pardon, &amp;c. it runs thus,—And we do hereby strictly charge and command you the said Lord Viscount Howe and William Howe, and each of you, from time to time to enquire diligently into the state and condition of the said Colonies and Provinces, and of every county, town, port, district and place within the same, or any of them respectively; and to receive and entertain all dutiful complaints and representations, made to you or either of you, by the inhabitants thereof, and faithfully and duly to transmit the same to one of our prin∣cipal Secretaries of State; that such reformation and redress may follow thereupon, as the nature of the case may require.

<P>It concludes with authority to the Commissioners to put a peaceful Colony in full-possession of her rights, by calling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an Assembly and proclaiming the King's peace, after which the prohibiting act is to cease and be void.</P>

<P>I have the honour to inclose you for the perusal and consideration of Congress, sundry papers, the whole of which, except No. 2 and 7, I received yesterday even∣ing by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congress.</P>
<P>Report of the Committee (Mr. Franklin, Mr. John Admas, and Mr. E. Rutledge) appointed on wait on Lord Howe.</P>
<P>In obedience to the orders of Congress, we have had a meeting with Lord Howe. It was on Wednesday last upon State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Island, opposite to Amboy, where his Lord∣ship received and entertained us with the utmost politeness.</P>
<P>His Lordship opened the conversation, by acquainting us that though he could not treat with us as a Committee of Congress, yet as his powers enabled him to confer and consult with any private gentlemen of influence in the Colonies, on the means of restoring peace between the two countries, he was glad of this opportu∣nity of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erring with us on that subject, if we thought ourselves at liberty to enter into a conference with him in that character. We observed to his Lordship, that as our business was to hear, he might consider us in what light he pleased, and communicate to us any propositions he might be authorized to make for the purpose mentioned; but that we could consider ourselves in no other character, than that in which we were placed by the order of Congress. His Lordship then entered into a discourse of considerable length, which contained no explicit propo∣sition of peace, except one, viz. that the Colonies should return to their allegiance and obedience to the Government of Great-Britain.—The rest consisted principally of assurances, that there was an exceeding good disposition in the King and Ministers to make that government easy to us; with intimations, that in case of our submis∣sion, they would cause the offensive acts of Parliament to be revived, and the in∣structions to Governours to be re-considered; that so, if any just causes of com∣plaint were found in the acts, or any errors in Government were perceived to have crept into the instructions, they might be amended or withdrawn.</P>
<P>We gave it as our opinion to his Lordship, that a return to the domination of Great-Britain was not to be expected; we mentioned the repeated humble petitions of the Colonies to the King and Parliament, which had been treated with contempt, and answered only by additional injuries; the unexam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed patience we had shewn under their tyrannical government and that it was not until the last act of Parlia∣ment, which denounced war against us, and put us out of the King's protection, that we declared our independence. That this declaration had been called for by the people of the Colonies in general—that every Colony had approved of it when made, and all now considered themselves as independent States, and were settling or had settled their governments accordingly; so that it was not in the power of Congress to agree for them, that they should return to their former dependent state. That there was no doubt of their inclination to peace, and their willingness to enter into a treaty with Britain, that might be advantageous to both countries—that though his Lordship has at pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent no power to treat with them as Independent States, he might it there was the same good disposition in Britain, much sooner obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> powers from thence for that purpose, than powers could be obtained by Congress from the several Colonies to consent to a subm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The intelligent American wants no aid to convict this report of the want of truth and good faith. Some of them were so far from the calling for Independence, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all authority to declare it, to this hour. And when uttered it shocked, and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> divided the Continent, and drove its advocates to violences and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> demonstrate the general discontent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> His Lordship then saying, that he was sorry to find that no accommodation was like to take place, put an end to the conference.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it did not appear to your Committee, that his Lordship's com∣mission contained any other authority of importance, than what is expressed in the act of Parliament, viz. that of granting pardons, with such exceptions as the Com∣missioners shall think proper to make, and of declaring America, or any part of it, to be in the King's peace upon submission: For as to the power of enquiring into the state of America, which his Lordship mentioned to us, and of conferring and consulting with any persons the Commissioners might think proper, and represent∣ing the result of such conversations to the Ministry, who (provided the Colonies would subject themselves) might after all, or might not at their pleasure, make any alterations in the former instructions to Governours, or propose in Parliament any amendment of the acts complained of; we apprehend any expectation from the effect of such a power, would have been too uncertain and precarious to be relied on by America, had she still continued in her state of dependence.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of Lord Howe's letter to Lord George Germaine, dated Eagle off New-York, 20th September 1776, communicated to the House of Lords, and taken from the Parliamentary Register for 1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FINDING in a conversation with Mr. Sullivan, a Major General in the rebel army, taken prisoner in the action of the 27th of August, that the leaders of the disaffected Americans, professed to understand the powers delegated by the King's commission, were restricted to grating pardons and declaring the Colonies at peace, without authority to enter into any discussion of grievances, I thought proper to inform that gentleman, that the object of his Majesty's paternal desire was to make his American subjects happy, as well as to relieve them from the calamities of war—That the Commissioners were willing to consult and confer with any persons of in∣fluence, upon the means of attaining these ends; and that reconciliation, union and redress of grievances, might be the happy consequence. Mr. Suilivan hereupon proposed, and with General Howe's approbation, I consented, that he should go to Philadelphia, and undeceive those who appeared to entertain that confined opinion of the King's most gracious intentions.</P>
<P>On the 9th instant he returned, and acquainted me, that he had made known the sentiments I had expressed to him; and that according to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r of a resolution of Congress, three Deputies might soon be expected in this province, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more particularly into the grounds of the information he had communicated.</P>
<P>I have the honour to send inclosed to your Lordship a copy of that resolution.</P>
<P>Although the object of this deputation apparently was to interrogate rather than to confer, General Howe concurred in opinion with me, that I should not, on that account, decline any proposition for a meeting.—We thought it material to contro∣vert the real or affected ideas before mentioned, which had probably been circulated with a view of persuade the ignorant, that the offer of peace and pardon held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in our Declaration of the 14th of July, was merely an artifice to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, and that their liberties and properties were only to be secured by a perseverance in their resolution, to throw off all dependence upon the King and Parliament of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>In the evening of the same day I received information that Doctor Franklin, Mr. John Adams, and Mr. Rutledge, would meet me, at any appointed place, on the morning on the 11th. General Howe's presence being that day necessary with the army, he could not accompany me to the meeting which I appointed should be on State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Island, opposite to the town of Amboy.</P>
<P>I acquainted them, that King's desire to restore publick tranquility, had in∣duced him to constitute Commissioners open the spot, to remove the restrictions upon trade and intercourse, to dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Royal cleamency to those who had been hurried away from their allegiance, to receive representations of grievances, and to discuss the means whereby that mutual confidence and just re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lution which ought to ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful between the Coloni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Parent State, might be restored and preserved I also gave them to understand, that his Majesty was graciously disposed to a revision of such of his royal instructions as might have laid too much restraint upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gimation, and to concur in a revisal of any of the plantation laws, by which the Co∣lonies might be aggrieved—That the Commissioners are earnest, on their part, to prevent the further effusion of blood, and to proceed upon all such measures as might expedite the accomplishment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their commission—That they were willing to confer with any of his Majesty's subjects, and to treat with Delegates of the Colonies, legally chosen, upon all matters relating to grievance and regula∣tions; but that, for very obvious reasons, we could not enter into any treaty wish their Congress; and much less proceed in any conference of negociation upon the inadmissible ground of Independency—I pretension which the Commissioners had not, nor was it possible they ever should have, authority to acknowledge.</P>
<P>The three gentlemen were very explicit in their opinions, that the associated Co∣lonies would not accede to any peace or alliance, but as free and independent States; and they endeavoured to prove, that Great-Britain would derive more extensive and more durable advantages from such an alliance, than from the connection it was the object of the Commission to restore.—Their comments not meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a serious atten∣tion, the conversation ended, and the gentleman returned to Amboy.</P>
<P>In consequence of the result of the above-mentioned interview, we judge it necessary to publish the declaration inclosed in our joint letter to your Lordship of this day's date.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The examination of Mr. John Brown, who was sent out in November, 1777, from Philadelphia, by Mr. Willing, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, not long before a member of the Congress, communicated from York; in Pennsylvania, to a friend at Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imore, and there published—Republished in the Remembrancer for 1778, page 92.

<P>Instead of an enquiry by a flag, whether Mr. Brown was dispatched from Phila∣delphia according to his declaration, he was conveyed from York to Lancaster as a spy, and committed to gaol; but his message having taken air, the leaders thought it requisite to circulate the following publication.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="publication">
<P>THE base artifices of tyrants are not less dangerous than their arms. Of this truth the present contest is one among a thousand examples. The British leaders have proved themselves alike bloody and deceitful.</P>
<P>The faith of publick proclamations, and even the words of sacred honour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Chiefs in person, most solemnly plighted to individuals for the protection of their property, have been violated. The miserable wretches starving in the gaols <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> New-York and Phialdelphia, were tempted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the enemy, by assurances that General Washington had refused to exchange them, when in truth General Howe had broke the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had settled, and had eluded every offer he had after∣wards made, as fast as they were complied with on our part.</P>
<P>But above all, the repeated attempts of our enemies to seduce the people of this country from their virtuous efforts, by the false ideas of peace and reconciliation which they never meant, are highly insidious and delusive.</P>
<P>The last year General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulliy, then a captive, was sent by Lord and General Howe from Long Island to Philadelphia, with very plausible terms; but when a Commit∣tee or Congress waited on the British Commissioners, they receded from every thing they had told him. The opportunity was, however, diligently improved, for the double purpose of blasting negotiations in Europe, by assurances to fo∣reign Courts, that the quarrel wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> settled, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to debauch the minds of the Americans, with the pretence that Congress was averse to peace. That at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that their emissaries were buzzing about in this country, that Congress refused to listen to the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easonable terms of accommodation, Lord Stormont was very industriously pledging his honour to the Court of France, that the treaty was far advanced, if not finally ratified.</P>
<P>No sooner was the world undeceived on this head, than the attempt was renewed, through the means of the unfortu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ante General Lee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Lee, while a prisoner at New-York, wrote two letters to intimate the willingness of Lord and General Howe to suspend the war, and enter upon a treaty for a permanent peace; he was then high in the confidence of the Congress, and re∣quested to the appointed one of their Commissioners on this important service. Can any reason be assigned for a flog from the British General to them, which does not call as loud for one from them to him after so many previous attempts? How soon might they have known by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine to General Howe, or Mr. Willing, whether the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, they for a blind had imprisoned, was an impostor, or the real messenger of peace</NOTE>, but still the Commissioners declined to pledge themselves for any thing—nothing appears from them—nothing in writing is sent forward; but the Commissioners were left at liberty to retract and deny every thing, is soon as they had answered the end of misleading the people here, and amusing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nations. And o! Mr. John Brown is employed to tell a rid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ulous tale of peace, and at the same time a large number of emissaries are let loose, to propagate the story throughout the State; still nothing appears in writing. A mere verbal talk of Mr. Willing, that he (Mr. Willing) had a talk with General Howe. Were we a tribe of savages, this talk would at least be accompanied with a belt of wampum, but to us not even the sligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t token was vouchsafed. The sole word of John Brown is again to gull us into a sham treaty which is again to be spread throughout Europe, to defeat our most promising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from that quarter, and again to deceive and mislead our own people, while his Excellency is again ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he is pretended to have told Mr. Willing to tell John Brown and to laugh at the mischief he had mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>Friends and Country men, be not deceived: If General Howe has any thing to propose to Congress, the way is open to him through the usual channels. He can send a flag of truce. He is under no necessity of sending out an obscure person, like a thief of a spy, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through our camp, without passports, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence.</P>
<P>Does the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a treaty of peace require less ceremony? No, but a message in writing by a flag of truce is not so easily evaded. General Howe might be loth to deny his hand-writing, though it seems he has not hesitated to deny his words.</P>
<P>France and Spain are likely to take a decisive part in our quarrel. A few months perseverance will establish our liberty and independence FOR EVER.</P>
<P>If we are not false to ourselves; if we are not driven to and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and deceived by every idle artifice of our perfidious enemies, trusting in Providence we may look forward with confidence, to the hope of being speed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and for ever delivered from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and perfidy of Britain; from the bloody and vind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive malice of our cruel enemies.</P>

<P>The reader will recollect, that it was not till after the message by Mr. Brown, that the Congress then at York in Pennsylvania, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned the paper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> "Articles of Confederation and Union, &amp;c." by which they hoped to gain the consent of the Colonies, to enter into treaties with foreign nations.

<P>But the Parent State had still more liberality.

<P>Among the statutes passed since 1763 and subjected to immediate suspension, and on a treaty to be marked out for future alteration or repeal, were those complained of as extending the Admiralty jurisdiction, depriving parties of the trial by jury, exacting security from claimants, indemnifying captors from damages, that direct∣ing the trial of certain criminals in England, the Quebec or Canada act, the statute of supremacy, claiming authority to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d America in all cases whatsoever, and those respecting the Board of Commissioners in Boston, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>What has prevented the Americans from being the ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est possession of all the peace, felicity and prosperity they can reasonably desire, but the want of a disposi∣tion in the Congress, to treat with the British Commissioners on the momentous con∣cerns of the Empire?</P>
<P>A door was opened for the requisitions of all orders of men, civil and ecclesiastical. It was not shut against any propositions that could, in the smallest degree, contribute to the common weal.

<P>The transactions of the Commissioners, and the manner in which they have been treated, and the miseries of America slighted by the Congress, will never be for∣gotten.

20. It being manifest that nothing will satisfy the di∣rectors of the American Councils (by whom several of the Colonies suffer themselves to be ruled) but measures in∣compatible with the safety of the many millions of the same natural stock with themselves in Europe, Asia and Africa, and in the contended dispersions in the Islands, as well as on the continent of America, Great-Britain will be justifi∣able in exerting the powers she enjoys for her preservation, to render the rebelled Plantations as <HI>impotent</HI> as they ap∣pear to be <HI>unfriendly,</HI> to the welfare of that vast commu∣nity, with whom they may be, as they once were, happily united; and from whom they are not sullenly severed, upon principles of partiality, reprobated by great multi∣tudes of their own countrymen, who have suffered insults, imprisonments, fines, sequestrations, and many of them <HI>death itself.</HI></P>

<P N="22">22. That the sufferings of the loyalists in all parts of the con∣tinent, from the hands of fellow subjects, who while violating the rights of private judgment, are nevertheless appealing in their fasts, prayers and thanksgivings, so the God of love and mercy, for their innocence, will eternally demonstrate the hypocrisy, avarice and profligacy of some, and the fanaticism of the rest of their oppressors; as the forbearance of Great-Britain, in not having yet executed a single rebel in her power, and in restrain∣ing from the devastations and complicated calamities, she might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brought upon the avowed ally of her inveterate enemy, is of her lenity and ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erosity: And that it will become her in future, to have tender regard, not only to her friends in Ame∣rica, but to discriminate the ignorant, the timid, the helpless, the uninformed and the seduced, by proportionable indulgen∣cies; and to remember at the final termination of the war in a reunion, the fidelity and affection she found here, and to strike hands with the Colonies, in a free and generous establishment of their privileges, bought by the blood of the American, as well as the European loyalist.</P>
<P>Lastly, That Great-Britain independent of her own interest in the controversy, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, all circumstances considered, bound by justice and honour to prevent the ruin of her American friends, at every risk short of certain destruction to herself: And that it will be her duty, if compelled by adversity to conclude a disad∣vantageous peace, and to part with one or more of her Colonies to France, Spain or any other foreign nation, to stipulate in clear and strong terms, in behalf of the loyalists who may be found there, for every advantage of disposing of their estates, and free liberty to remove to such of the Colonies or Dominions as may not be unfortunately surrendered at the end of the war, to a popish or arbitrary power.</P>
