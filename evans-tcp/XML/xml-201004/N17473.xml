<HEAD>TO HENRY FUSELI, <HI>A. M.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TAKE, dear observer of men, from the hand of your unbiassed friend, this testimony of esteem for your genius.</P>
<P>All the world know that this is no flattery; for, in an hundred things, I am not of your opinion; but, in what concerns the knowledge of mankind, we are nearer to one another than any two in ten thousand.</P>
<P>What I give here is the result of long experience, matured and confirmed by various and daily application. It will be found, I hope, an useful book for every class of men, from the throne to the cottage. All is not, cannot be, new; but all ought to be true, useful, im∣portant; and much, I trust, is new and individual.</P>
<P>I give you liberty not only to make improvements, but to omit what you think false or unimportant.</P>
<P>The number of rules may appear large, yet it is small compared to what might have been written; in the mean time you and I, as well as our readers, may find ample employment in studying these.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following collection of Aphorisms the reader is not to expect a set of maxims compiled from the author's own, or by him selected from the works of others; but an original, meditated and composed in the series here offered during the autumn of <HI>1787,</HI> and trarsmitted in the author's own manuscript to the publisher.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the rapidity that attended this work, (and the world know that all this author's works are affusions,) it will be found to contain what gives their value to maxims—verdicts of wisdom on the reports of experience. If some are truisms, let it be considered that Sclomon and Hippocrates wrote truisms: if some are not new, they are recommended by an air of novelty: if whim should appear to have dictated others, it was the whim of humanity; and what may be deamed rash will be found to flow from the fervour of indignant honesly, or the exultations of benevolence. Acute and perspicuous, they are not infected by the cant of sects, or circumscribed by local notions, but general as the passions and feelings of the race.</P>
<P>It is the intention of the editor to add another volume of <HI>AMPHORISMS ON ART, WITH CHARACTERS AND EXAMPLES,</HI> not indeed by the same author, which the reader may expect in the course of the year.</P>

<P>Existence is self-enjoyment, by means of some object distinct from ourselves.</P>

<P>Who pursues means of enjoyment contra∣dictory, irreconcilable, and self-destructive, is a fool, or what is called a sinner—Sin and destruction of order are the same.</P>

<P>The more unharmonious and inconsistent your objects of desire, the more inconse∣quent, inconsistent, unquiet, the more igno∣ble, idiotical, and criminal yourself.</P>

<P>Joy and grief decide character. What exalts prosperity? what imbitters grief? what leaves us indifferent? what interests us? As the interest of man, so his God—as his God, so he.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="aphorism">
<HEAD>14.</HEAD>
<P>What is a man's interest? what consti∣tutes his God, the ultimate of his wishes, his end of existence? Either that which on every occasion he communicates with the most unrestrained cordiality, or hides from every profane eye and ear with mysterious awe; to which he makes every other thing a mere appendix;—the vortex, the centre, the comparative point from which he sets out, on which he fixes, to which he irresisti∣bly returns;—that, at the last of which you may safely think him inconsolable;—that which he rescues from the gripe of danger with equal anxiety and boldness.</P>

The story of the painter and the prince is well known: to get at the best piece in the artist's collection, the prince ordered fire to be cried in the neighbourhood—at the first noise the artist abruptly left the prince, and seized his darling—his Titian. The alarm proved a false one, but the object of purchase was fixed. The application is easy: of thousands it may be decided what loss, what gain, would affect them most. This the sage of Nazareth meant when he said, <HI>Where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.</HI>—The object of your love is your God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="aphorism">

<P>The more independent of accidents, the more self-subsistent, the more fraught with internal resources—the greater the character.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="aphorism">
<HEAD>16.</HEAD>
<P>The greatest of characters, no doubt, would be he, who, free of all trifling acci∣dental helps, could see objects through one grand immutable medium, always at hand, and proof against illusion and time, reflect∣ing every object in its true shape and colour through all the fluctuation of things.</P>

<P>The study of man is the doctrine of uni∣sons and discords between ourselves and others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="aphorism">
<HEAD>19.</HEAD>
<P>As man's love or hatred, so he. Love and hatred exist only personified. As his hatred and love, so his will and its energy. As the energy of will, so the value, the character of man. Investigate then <HI>what</HI> and <HI>how</HI> he loves or hates—as these are in perpetual unison, you discover his energy of will, and by that himself.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="aphorism">
<HEAD>20.</HEAD>
<P>Distinguish with exactness, in thyself and others, between <HI>wishes</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> in the strictest sense.</P>
<P>Who has many wishes has generally but little will. Who has energy of will has few diverging wishes. Whose will is bent with energy on <HI>one, must</HI> renounce the wishes for <HI>many</HI> things. Who cannot do this is not stamped with the majesty of human nature.
<PB N="10" REF="022609_0010_0FB9B4D7957DCCF0"/>The energy of choice, the unison of various powers for one, is alone <HI>will,</HI> born under the agonies of self-denial and renounced desires.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="aphorism">

<P>Calmness of will is a sign of grandeut. The vulgar, far from hiding their <HI>will,</HI> blab their wishes.—A single spark of occasion discharges the child of passions into a thou∣sand crackers of desire.</P>

<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="aphorism">

<P>The acquisition of <HI>will,</HI> for one thing ex∣clusively, presupposes entire acquaintance with many others. Search into the progress of exclusive <HI>will,</HI> and you may learn whether it was formed by accident, or judgment, or both.</P>

<P>Who is open without levity; generous without waste; secret without craft; humble without meanness; bold without insolence; cautious without anxiety; regular, yet not formal; mild, yet not timid; firm, yet not tyrannical—is made to pass the ordeal of honour, friendship, virtue.</P>

<P>The glad gladdens—who gladdens not is not glad. Who is fatal to others is so to himself—to him, heaven, earth, wisdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, virtue, vice, are equal—to such an one tell neither good nor bad of yourself.</P>

<P>Man is for ever the same; the same under every form, in all situations and relations that admit of free and unrestrained exertion.

<P>Each heart is a world of nations, classes, and individuals; full of friendships, enmities, indifferences; full of being and decay, of life and death: the past, the present, and the future; the springs of health and engines of disease: here joy and grief, hope and fear, love and hate, fluctuate, and toss the fullen and the gay, the hero and the coward, the giant and the dwarf, deformity and beauty, on ever restless waves. You find all <HI>within</HI> yourself that you find <HI>without:</HI> the number and character of your friends within, bears an exact resemblance to your external ones; and your internal enemies are just as many, as inveterate, as irreconcilable, as those with∣out: the world that surrounds you is the magic-glass of the world, and of its forms within you; the brighter you are yourself, so much brighter are your friends—so much more polluted your enemies.
