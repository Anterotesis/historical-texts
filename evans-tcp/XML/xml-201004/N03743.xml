<HEAD>To the READERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Friends;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Queries and Remarks <HI>seem</HI> to us to concern Matters of the utmost Im∣portance. We are represented in Scripture as Pilgrims and Travellers to a better Country; and as a <HI>wrong Choice of the Road</HI> may ruin us eternally, we ought to <HI>examine</HI> every Step we tread, and take Notice that our Guides be not <HI>blind</HI> nor <HI>mistaken,</HI> lest they lead us astray. None can blame us when our Souls are in Danger of eternal Ruin, to look to our selves, and to secure the one Thing need∣ful; nor dare we allow ourselves to fellow the Multitude, if we fear they go astray; nor re∣gard any Man further than he follows Christ: And we hope this will justify us in what we have done in the following Pages; for, if all our Christian Brethren, who may think it worth while to read our Remarks, have such
<PB N="v" REF="004588_0005_100D834B1E70ADC8"/>
superior Attainmments as to <HI>see clearly,</HI> that all that Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI> has printed, is sound and agreeable to the holy Scriptures; yet we hope that their Christian Charity is so great, that they will not condemn us for applying as we have done to our Teachers, and by their Advice to Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI> himself, to remove some un∣happy Stumbling-Blocks out of our Way. We cannot help thinking for ourselves and judging of Things according to the Light they appear in; and we promise, that when that Gentle∣man satisfies us in these Things, we will be∣lieve him; and we <HI>cannot</HI> do it sooner. But when we reflect, that he is but a Man; that great and good Men have <HI>been mistaken;</HI> and that Infalibility <HI>(as far as we know)</HI> is entailed neither on him nor his followers, we hope that both he and they are better Christians than to blame us if we can be the Instruments of pointing out their Mistakes, <HI>if there be any:</HI> We believe, that they regard their Souls, and will look on it as the most eminent Service can be done them, if by our Means they receive a Kindness that will turn to their Account, through a boundless Eternity.</P>
<P>We confess, that we are at a Loss to know what to make of some of his Expressions; if they have <HI>any Meaning at all,</HI> we fear it is
<PB N="vi" REF="004588_0006_100DA599A0257248"/>
a bad one; and will rejoice to find ourselves disappointed, if he shews us that they are sound and good. But if he pretends Hurry or Want of Time, and <HI>does not either justify</HI> or <HI>condemn them,</HI> or give us <HI>some Satisfac∣tion,</HI> he will <HI>constrain</HI> us to think, that he has his own <HI>Glory</HI> in View more than the <HI>Glory</HI> of God or the <HI>Good</HI> of his Church. He has such <HI>high</HI> Conceptions of Man, or such <HI>low</HI> Con∣ceptions of God, that we fear he has <HI>just</HI> Conceptions of neither; to say, "That Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, That he was the Perfection of the <HI>mo∣ral</HI> and <HI>material World,</HI>" as he does, <HI>Pag. 17. Vol. 2d. of Sermons,</HI> is what we can <HI>neither believe,</HI> nor find Ground from Reason nor Revelation to support it. When our Divines prove the Divinity of our blessed Lord, they sometimes do it <HI>(we think to a good Purpose)</HI> by proving, that the Scriptures attribute to him <HI>all the Perfections of the Deity,</HI> and of Con∣sequence that he is the eternal God, equal with the Father and Holy Spirit; but if a <HI>meer Man</HI> may be adorned with <HI>all these Per∣fections,</HI> we know not what to make of this Argument, 'till he give us better Light.</P>
<P>Again if Men be baptized <HI>into the Nature</HI> of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as he seems
<PB N="vii" REF="004588_0007_100DA59B2C816AD8"/>
to assert, <HI>p. 128, vol. 2.</HI> is not this to make them, on their Conversion, Partakers of the Godhead, or someway equal to the Supream Being? What shall we think of the Doctrine, that one while <HI>finks us</HI> into <HI>Brutes and Di∣vels,</HI> and <HI>again exalts</HI> us to be equal to <HI>God?</HI> This puts us in Mind of some <HI>Antinomian</HI> Reveries, of being goded with God, and christed with Christ: And we hope the Rea∣ders will pardon us, tho' we desire to get Light in these Things, seeing it is our great Concern to have <HI>right Notions of God</HI> and <HI>ourselves,</HI> and to Act accordingly.</P>
<P>When we hear him tell us, "That the Re∣generate washes away the Guilt of Sin <HI>by the Tears</HI> of a sincere Repentance, <HI>joined with</HI> Faith in the Blood of Christ," <HI>p. 22, 23. vol. 2.</HI> we think that it savours of <HI>Popery and Arminianism,</HI> to join any Thing with the Blood of Christ to wash away Sin; and hope it will offend none, that we cannot believe this on his <HI>bare Word</HI> contrary to many Scrip∣ture Texts, for we abhor an implicit Faith. Is not that Expression of the same <HI>Stamp? Vol. 1, p. 7.</HI> Where he says, "That a sin∣gle Aim at God's Glory, — <HI>alone</HI> can ren∣der our Actions <HI>acceptable</HI> in God's Sight:" If a single Aim at God's Glory <HI>alone</HI> can ren∣der
<PB N="viii" REF="004588_0008_100DA59D48F81CB0"/>
our Actions acceptable in his Sight, what need is there for the Blood of Christ? We hope none of our Brethren will be offended, that we cannot believe this <HI>popish</HI> Doctrine, till he explain or prove it from Scripture.</P>
<P>He further tells us, <HI>p. 128. vol. 2.</HI> (if we mistake him not) "That our Lord commanded his Disciples to baptize Men <HI>into</HI> the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost," which is either to convert them, or rather to make them equal with God: And if he has given Men <HI>Ability</HI> to do either the one or the other, by repeating the Words of the Institution; Why <HI>may</HI> they not as easily change a Wafer into his Body and Blood? And this <HI>smells of Po∣pery,</HI> and will <HI>support</HI> the Doctrine of Tran∣substantion. — When he tells us, "That we must be justified by the inherent Righteous∣ness of Christ, "if by this he intends our Sanc∣tification, or good Habits, and good Works per∣formed by the Aid of the Spirit, does not he here again give another <HI>fair Invitation</HI> to bring us to <HI>Rome?</HI> And we hope we will be excused from <HI>setting</HI> our Face <HI>that Way,</HI> till we be once convinced, that it is the <HI>sure Road</HI> to eternal Happiness. Are not these Doctrines full of <HI>Arminianism?</HI> And 'tis no Wonder, that we are surprized to find them in his <HI>own
<PB N="9" REF="004588_0009_100DA59ED8615928"/>
Writings,</HI> and to hear him <HI>continually ap∣plaud</HI> Mr. <HI>Westly,</HI> who (we are informed) is an <HI>Arminian,</HI> when we find him cry them down in <HI>all but</HI> themselves: We <HI>detest</HI> these <HI>Errors</HI> in both, and cannot see through this Piece of Management.</P>
<P>But possibly by inherent Righteousness, in <HI>vol. 1. p. 16.</HI> he understands the Righteous∣ness of Christ inherent in us; if so, we hope every one will desire to know, as well as our∣selves, how the <HI>infinite Righteousness</HI> of Jesus Christ can inhere in a <HI>finite</HI> Creature? Unless, as has been already observed, he make the Believer in some Measure equal with God; but when we compare this with Mr. <HI>Flavel's 2d Appendix, vol. 1. Fol.</HI> and find it the <HI>seventh Antinomian Error,</HI> that he there condemns, what can we say? When we find Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> countenancing Mr. <HI>West∣ly's</HI> Preface to <HI>Halyburton's Memoirs,</HI> which is <HI>big</HI> with <HI>Antinomian Absurdities;</HI> when he can <HI>applaud</HI> that Gentleman, and not discover the <HI>false Divinity,</HI> that he has there sent a broad to poison the World; Can we think that himself is sound? When he tells us in his Letter against the Book, entitled, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man, p. 4,</HI> and <HI>5.</HI> "That <HI>God never made a second Covenant with</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004588_0010_100DA5A0CCB806F8"/>
Adam <HI>himself, nor any of his Posterity; That it is a Promise</HI> and no Covenant; <HI>That there are no Terms</HI> nor <HI>Conditions</HI> in it." We cannot take his <HI>bare Word,</HI> while we think that above <HI>one hundred and Fifty Texts</HI> in our Bibles assert the <HI>contrary.</HI> How many of our ablest Divines have long since re∣futed this wild <HI>Antinomian Notion?</HI> And among others, Mr. <HI>Flavel, Vol. 1. Fol.</HI> in his <HI>2d Appendix.</HI> where he <HI>exposes</HI> it as the <HI>Ninth</HI> of their Errors.</P>
<P>When we find him, <HI>vol. 1. p. 7.</HI> giving Rea∣sons why Men must be <HI>New Creatures,</HI> in order to <HI>qualify them</HI> to be <HI>savingly in Christ,</HI> Why does he condemn Archbishop <HI>Tillotson;</HI> Letter first against the Archbishop, <HI>page the 3d.</HI> for shewing the Nature of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and its <HI>Necessity,</HI> in order to <HI>our Justification</HI> and <HI>Salvation?</HI> Is not the <HI>New Creature</HI> in Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and the <HI>Regenerate</HI> in the Archbishop's Words, of the <HI>same Meaning</HI> and <HI>Import?</HI> Is not <HI>being savingly in Christ,</HI> as the First <HI>expresses</HI> it, and <HI>obtain∣ing Justification</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> as the other <HI>has</HI> it, the very same Thing? Why did not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> correct this Error in <HI>his own</HI> Writings, as well as in the others? If it be an Error in the one, to say, That we must be
<PB N="11" REF="004588_0011_100DA5A396FF5C10"/>
<HI>regenerate</HI> or be <HI>New Creatures, in order</HI> to Justification and Salvation, or being saving∣ly in Christ, is it not so in the other? Or, does Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> expressing the <HI>same Error</HI> in <HI>different Words,</HI> make it a <HI>Gospel Truth?</HI> We dislike what looks like the <HI>Ar∣minian</HI> in both, and we hope none of his Friends will blame us for this, when he <HI>some∣times</HI> does it himself.</P>
<P>If we have dropt any Expressions in our Queries, that may in any wise <HI>displease</HI> any other religious Society, we hope they will par∣don our Bluntness; we profess▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earty Cha∣rity and Good Will towards all that hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the fundamental Truths of the Gospel; we <HI>claim no Dominion</HI> over any Man's Con∣science, but chearfully allow every one the <HI>Liberty we take, to judge for ourselves,</HI> to seek for the best Information he can get in such weighty Concerns, and to <HI>adhere</HI> to what Doctrines are most agreeable to the holy Scrip∣tures: But when we find <HI>any Person Pro∣fess one Thing,</HI> and <HI>yet seem to run into another;</HI> when any of another Denomination <HI>seem</HI> to come <HI>nearer</HI> to us <HI>than others</HI> of our Neighbours, when at the same Time we ima∣gine, that he is at <HI>as great</HI> or <HI>even a greater</HI> Distance than they, <HI>we cannot help</HI> having a

worse Opinion of such Practices, than theirs, who plainly tell us <HI>in what</HI> they <HI>agree</HI> with us, and <HI>in what we differ.</HI> If any <HI>Weak∣ness</HI> or <HI>Mistakes</HI> be discovered in this, and what follows, by Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or any of our Christian Brethren, and it be pointed out with a <HI>Spirit of Meekness,</HI> we gain <HI>our End,</HI> which is only to be able to <HI>find out</HI> and <HI>maintain the Truth:</HI> And that the Holy Spirit may guide us all in the Ways of <HI>Truth,</HI> and preserve us from <HI>Errors,</HI> is the earnest Prayer of your sincere Friends,</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>ADDRESS</HI> of several Persons of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Persuasion, being Members of several Congregations in our Bounds, to the Presbytery of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> met at <HI>Whiteclay Creek, September</HI> the Ninth, <HI>1740.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE venerable and sacred Cha∣racter the Reverend Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> bears, as an incomparable Reformer; and the high Com∣mendations given to his publick Perform∣ances and Writings, both from the Pulpit and Press, as well as in private Conference, and that, by some Ministers and People of our own Denomination, having raised our Expectations very high, we were induced to attend his Sermons, and to read and per∣use his Books, hoping to receive much Light and Benefit thereby: But, upon the
<PB N="14" REF="004588_0014_100DA5AB70DA1698"/>
best Perusal we could make of them, al∣beit, we find that great Part of his Writ∣ings do answer the Character given them, as being sound, yet, to our great Surprize, we every now and then stumble upon something that seems to jar with those sounder Parts, as well as with other good Books; and, if we be not mistaken, with Scripture and sound Reason.— Our Jea∣lousies hereanent, whether Right or Wrong, giving us some Uneasiness, we were much perplexed what to do: If we should think of going to some of Mr <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s warm Adherents, we were afraid, by Reason of the Treatment that others (and it may be some of ourselves) met with, that nothing could be expected thereby, but incensing them against us, to call us blind and carnal Men, as usual. Now tho' Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> himself, by some Part of his Writings, would seem to be a Man of another Spirit and Sentiments from such warm inconsi∣derate Adherents, as appears by many Ex∣pressions in his Letters against Archbishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> and the Author of <HI>The Whole Duty of Man;</HI> particularly by his taxing the Dis∣senters for acting very partially, for not speaking so explicitly as they ought against
<PB N="15" REF="004588_0015_100DA5ADD6DAEFD8"/>
the Archbishop's Doctrine, when known to be contrary to the Truth of the Gospel, al∣beit, the Arch-bishop was their Friend, and behaved with much Moderation towards them, whilst he lived; we cannot see, how be could, consistent with this, tax any of the Lovers of Truth for acting unchristianly, for enquiring into the Reasons of some of his Assertions, when we judge that they appear to us as contrary to Truth as some of the said Archbishop's Doctrines: For, if we mistake not, it is the Duty and pri∣viledge of every doubting Christian, to enquire into the Reasons of the plainest Scripture Doctrine, when he hesitates about it: But we should not speak explicitly a∣gainst any Doctrine, but what upon mature Deliberation we have found false. But when we consider the Treatment a Neigh∣bouring Minister had from Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI>'s warm Adherents, and their Cries still a∣gainst him for desiring a Conference with Mr. <HI>Whitfield,</HI> about some Points in his Ser∣mon, which said Minister was in Doubts about; we do dispair of Access to him.</P>
<P>The only Remedy therefore left us, to solve us of our Doubts, as we see, is, an Ad∣dress to you our Teachers, now in Presby∣tery
<PB N="16" REF="004588_0016_100DA5B07A876600"/>
met, and setting our Scruples in order before you: And we promise, that if you, or any of you, can satisfy us with Scrip∣ture and sound Reason, we shall not only chearfully submit to the same, but also re∣turn you our most hearty Thanks, as coun∣ting the Discovery of Truth our Gain and Joy. But if you decline, or cannot agree among yourselves, about solving us herein, we desire your Judgments, whether it be any Breach of Order, for us, at our own Expences, and such as shall join with us, to put our Scruples into Print, that so there may be an Opportunity given to Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> to clear his Doctrine, if misrepresented or misapprehended by us: And that we may make a fair Essay to have our Doubts cleared, which for the present seem to be Bars and Letts to hinder us to join with our Christian Brethren in Matters of Com∣mon Concern, with that Oneness of Mind and Heart, which is desirable and necessary for our mutual Comfort: For when one Side is as zealous for, as the other is jea∣lous of a controverted Point, and Assertions about it in Matters of Conscience, it is well known how Difficult it is to go Hand in Hand. We find by Experience, that the
<PB N="17" REF="004588_0017_100DA5B2B8FAA798"/>
other side have their Difficulties to enter∣tain a good Opinion of those Ministers that except against some of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Expressions as unsound: And we, accord∣ing to our present Light, find it hard to en∣tertain a good Opinion of those that pro∣claim all his Doctrines sound in the strong∣est Terms. We have therefore endeavour∣ed to put our Scruples in the most inoffen∣sive Way we could, by not only transcrib∣ing some Paragraphs out of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Printed Writings; but also, according to our Capacities, we have endeavoured to propose our Doubts by raising proper Que∣ries upon such Paragraphs, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in his Sermon on <HI>Acts</HI> 19.5. <HI>Page.</HI> 5. * where speaking of Man's Creation, he has these Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>He, <HI>that is God,</HI> breathed into Man the Breath of spiritual Life, and his Soul be∣came adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. Must not that Man have either very diminutive Thoughts of God, or else mon∣strously exalted Thoughts of Man, that can think, much more speak and write, that the Soul of Man in its best State was a∣dorned with all the Perfections of the Dei∣ty!
<PB N="18" REF="004588_0018_100DA5B44CD7B458"/>
What then is become of the Distinc∣tion, that all sound Divines make between the communicable and incommunicable At∣tributes of God? Doth not Scripture and Reason support this necessary Distinction? if the Soul of Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, without Ex∣ception of any, what is the native and ne∣cessary Consequence therefrom, but that the Soul then was in some s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt equal to God; which is too horrid to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, without a De∣testation of it? Were not Expressions of this Import condemn'd for Blasphemies in the Mouths of <HI>Fox</HI> and <HI>Naylor?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. In the same Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 9. [<HI>Vol.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 22, 23.] Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> speaking of the Re∣generate, when fallen into Sin, hath these Words: <Q><HI>He,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Regenerate Person, quickly</HI> Rises <HI>again, and goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly,</HI> washes away the Guilt of Sin, by the Tears <HI>of a sincere Re∣pentance,</HI> join'd with Faith in the <HI>Blood of Jesus Christ.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> I. Is not the Blood of Christ to be applied by Faith, the <HI>sole</HI> or <HI>only</HI> Laver, to wash away the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.7. 'Tis true, Faith in grown Believers, to make Application of his Blood to the Soul, must
<PB N="19" REF="004588_0019_100DA5B5E3508318"/>
be exercised thereon: And it is true, that a Believer must renew the Exercises of Re∣pentance, in order to regain the Sense of Pardon; but still, what <HI>solely</HI> obtains the Pardon, and blots out the <HI>Guilt,</HI> is the Blood of the attoning Sacrifice. Is it not by our Justification that the Guilt of Sin is washed away? How then can there be any Room to <HI>join</HI> our <HI>Tears</HI> with Faith in the Blood of Christ, to justify us before God, without we suppose the Satisfaction of the Cross to be incompleat? By what Art can our Tears be <HI>joined</HI> with Faith in the Blood of Christ to cleanse away the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin? What Quantity of the one and of the other will make a due Composition, without spoiling the whole? Why may not some Grains of new Obedience be again added to our Tears to make the Composition more compleat; for surely this is Duty, and a necessary Fruit of Faith as well as godly Sorrow, and as inseperable from it?</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> II. How is this consistent with what Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> himself saith, in his Letter against the Book entituled the Whole Duty of Man, <HI>p.</HI> 6. <Q>God's Law was ho∣nourable, Jesus Christ fulfilled it in our steads; and upon account of that Righte∣ousness
<PB N="20" REF="004588_0020_100DA5B883DBA7D8"/>
imputed to us, and received by Faith, and <HI>not</HI> on our <HI>hearty Endeavour</HI> or <HI>Repentance,</HI> are we accepted by him?" What is there in our <HI>hearty Endeavour</HI> or <HI>Repentance,</HI> to recommend us to the Favour of God, or render them worthy of <HI>being joined</HI> with the Righteousness of Christ; as tho' that was not <HI>sufficient</HI> of itself?</Q> Further, Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> adds the Words of pious Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> to the same purpose, <HI>p.</HI> 7. who saith, <Q>Nay I cannot confess my Sins, but my very Confessions are still Agra∣vations of them: My Repentings need to be repented of: <HI>My Tears need Washing;</HI> and the very <HI>Washing</HI> of <HI>my Tears</HI> need still to be washed over again with the Blood of my Redeemer.</Q> Now if Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> speaks right in <HI>p.</HI> 8. of the same Letter; <HI>for there is no Hopes of bringing People to the right Knowledge of the Gospel, till their fa∣vourite tho' erroneous Authors, are discounte∣nanced and laid aside:</HI> And it is therefore accounted a becoming Zeal in Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> to write warmly and keenly against the Writings of others upon this Account; How then can others be blamed for oppos∣ing such Expressions in <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Books as are as erroneous as those he condemns in
<PB N="21" REF="004588_0021_100DA5BA9E038478"/>
others? Nay, should not Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and his warm Adherents, be as careful in Correcting his own Sermons as the Books of others, if found faulty in some of the same Points, or other Points as material? if it be said, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> is so busi∣ly employ'd in Preaching, and Writing a∣gainst other Men's Writings, that he hath no Time to look back upon his former Writings; may not some of his Adherents assist herein to a good Purpose? Or if a By-Stander should mark some of those Ex∣pressions that look exceptionable; by what Rule, but that of Contraries, can he be judged an Opposer of God's Work, or of the Gospel?</P>
<P N="3">III. In the same Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 18. [<HI>vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 33.] He saith, <Q>You have passed thro' the Pangs of the New-Birth and now rejoice, that the <HI>Man</HI> Christ Jesus is <HI>spiritually</HI> form∣ed in your Hearts.</Q> To the same Purpose, if we rightly apprehend it, is what we find in the Letter aforesaid, <HI>p.</HI> 5. where paraphrasing upon those Words, <HI>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head;</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> writes thus, <Q>The Seed of the Wo∣man, <HI>i. e.</HI> Jesus Christ (who in all Probability was <HI>spiritually</HI> conceived that instant in the
<PB N="22" REF="004588_0022_100DA5BCD3DF72B8"/>
Heart of <HI>Eve</HI>) shall bruise the Serpent's Head:</Q> Agreeable to which Notion we have in Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> Vol. I. of Sermons printed at <HI>Philadelphia, p.</HI> 53. <Q>The many Souls that are nourished weekly by the <HI>Spiri∣tual Body and Blood</HI> of Jesus Christ by your Means.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. Had the Man Christ Jesus a read tho' a spiritual Being or Conception in the Days of <HI>Eve?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. <HI>What</HI> or <HI>who</HI> was that which was <HI>spiritually conceived</HI> that Instant in the <HI>Heart of</HI> Eve, wherein the Promise was given, but the <HI>New-Creature,</HI> or the Image of Christ? If so, in what Sense can the New Creature, or Image of Christ in us, be called <HI>the Seed of the Woman,</HI> or <HI>the Man Christ Jesus?</HI> Is the Man Christ Jesus, and the New Creature in us, one and the same? Are we to believe in the New Creature, as the Christ held forth in this Promise? How, or when, did this New Creature, or this spiritual Man Christ Jesus, who then had a Conception, bruise the Serpent's Head by his Obedience and Sufferings? Had the Man Christ Jesus, as the Seed of the Wo∣man, any other Conception, besides that suppernatural One by the Power of the Ho∣ly

Ghost, in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Ma∣ry?</HI> We would be glad to know, where there is any Scripture Ground to support the spiritual Conception of Christ, as the Seed of the Woman; or the spiritual Man∣hood of Christ? Are not these Notions as unintelligible as those of <HI>Barclay</HI> in his <HI>Apo∣logy, p.</HI> 135. 136. where he speaks of <HI>the Christ within?</HI> It is true, the Apostle speaks of <HI>Forming of Christ in us, Gal.</HI> 4.19. but are we not to understand that Place as in∣tending the Image, and not the Person of Christ, as God-Man? much less, can we understand it of Christ, as the Seed of the Woman, or as Man. We hope we do (ac∣cording to our Measure) understand what it is to feed on a crucified Christ; but yet, we would desire to know what is that <HI>spiri∣tual Body</HI> and <HI>spiritual Blood,</HI> with which Souls are nourished? Is this <HI>spiritual Body and Blood of Christ, Humane</HI> or <HI>Divine?</HI> Are these <HI>finite</HI> or <HI>infinite?</HI> Was it not the natural Body of Christ that suffered for us? Was it not the natural Blood of Christ that was shed for our Sins? How then can we feed upon the spiritual Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, which never (as we know of) had a Being in Heaven, nor on Earth? It
<PB N="24" REF="004588_0024_100DA5C0828FD688"/>
is true, we own, according to the Scriptures, that Christ's Soul and Body have under∣gone a glorious and an ineffable Change; so that if we speak of Christ's Body, as it now subsists in an exalted State, it may well be called <HI>a spiritual Body:</HI> But yet, when we feed by Faith on a crucified Christ, doth not Faith look to Christ's Body as Hanging on the Cross; and to the real Sufferings of Christ in his humane Nature in a State of Humiliation, as what attones Justice for us, and as what feeds and nourishes our Souls?</P>
<P N="4">IV. In the aforesaid written Letter against the Book entituled, <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> wherein Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> quotes the 17th Para∣graph of the Preface of that Book, wherein the Author, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> observes, talking of the second Covenant, speaks thus: <Q>The second Covenant, says he, was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, presently after his Fall, and is briefly contained in these Words, <HI>Gen. 3.15.</HI> where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head: And this was made up, as the First was, of some Mercies to be afforded us by God, and some Duties to be performed by us." 'Who that is any way enlightned, cannot but see the false Divinity and funda∣mental
<PB N="25" REF="004588_0025_100DA5C2994F9958"/>
Errors of this Passage: For how can it be proved, that the second Covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> or that God ever entered into any Covenant at all with Man after he had broken the First? It is true, God the Father did enter into a second Covenant (and that from all Eternity) with the second <HI>Adam,</HI> the God-Man Christ Jesus, in our Stead: But it cannot be proved, that he made any second Covenant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> himself, or any of his Posterity.</Q></P>
<P>Before we come to propose Queries on this Head, it will not be amiss to premise a Word or two, to prevent Mistakes, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We freely grant that Christ Jesus is our second <HI>Adam,</HI> our common Head and Surity in the second Covenant, and that the first <HI>Adam,</HI> was only a private Believer or Person, and so must come in, or enter into Covenant with God by or thro' a Me∣diator, and at a second Hand (if we may so speak) as well as we his Posterity. And when we read the 16th Paragraph of the Preface of that 'fore cited Book, we cannot but judge that the Author thereof doth ful∣ly own this, when he saith, <Q>For tho' by that Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> all Mankind were under the Sentence of eternal Condemnation, yet it
<PB N="26" REF="004588_0026_100DA5C5A2D98DF8"/>
pleased God so far to pity our Misery, as to give us his Son, and in him to make a new Covenant with us, after we had broken the First.</Q> Thus far the Author seems sound enough.</P>
<P>Whether the next Paragraph that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> condemns may bear a favourable Construction, we leave you to judge; but we cannot but heartily join with him in shewing our Dislike to whatsoever in <HI>any Author may mislead the Weak or Ignorant, or countenance the Erroneous:</HI> Yet, whether this may lay Foundation for such a <HI>hard Censure</HI> as that he was <HI>not a Real Christian at Heart,</HI> or had not so much as <HI>a Head Knowledge of the Gospel of Christ,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> asserts, is what we are at a Loss to determine? How would Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or some of his warm Adherents, like it, if another would take the same Liberty to censure his Writings, and him for them, to the same Degree? Upon the like Ground, we must, and do condemn the Author of <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> for asserting that the second Covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, if thereby is meant, his be∣ing our publick Head and Surety in the second Covenant. And may we not also
<PB N="27" REF="004588_0027_100DA5C7BA9B2898"/>
condemn Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> for running into another Extreme and an Error, that seems as dangerous as this, in asserting that God never made any second Covenant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> himself, or any of his Posteri∣ty? And must beg Leave to lay before you the following Queries.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. How can Christ be a Mediator of the new Covenant, if there be no other Par∣ties in the Covenant, but God the Father, and Christ engaging for us? Must not the Elect or Believers, be considered as a third Party in the second Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. How can the new Covenant be called a Testament, and Christ the Testator of it, if there be no Parties in it but the Father and him? He receives all from the Father as Mediator: On whom then doth he bestow Legacies, without there be a third Party in this Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> III. How is the second <HI>Adam,</HI> Christ Jesus, a publick Head and Surety of his e∣lect Seed, unless such come under the Bond of the second Covenant; and that not only virtually, as elect, but also in Time actually as Believers; so that the Covenant may be truly said to be established and made with them in Christ?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004588_0028_100DA5C94BD7AD60"/><HI>Q.</HI> IV. How can any justify Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI>'s Calling the second Covenant <HI>a bare Promise,</HI> and that in a Way of <HI>Distinction from</HI> and <HI>Opposition to</HI> its being a Covenant? when the Apostle calls it, in Respect of the several Editions of it, <HI>the Covenants of Pro∣mise, Eph.</HI> 2.12. Is there any Promise made to the Sinner or Believer, but what is or may be, yea, must be owned to be a second Covenant Promise? And are not all that are Strangers to the Covenant of Promise, or out of the Bond of the second Covenant, without God, without Christ, and without Hope? How poor then is the Condition of all the Posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> if it cannot be proven, that God did make a second Covenant with any of them? Must not then all of them be under the Law as a broken Covenant, and under the Curse thereof, without Remedy?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> V. If there be not any second Co∣venant at all made with <HI>Adam</HI> himself, or any of his Posterity; what then can we make of plain Scripture Texts, that speak of God's covenanting or making a Cove∣nant with Men, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.7. <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.2. — 29.10, 15. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5. 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 8.9, 21. <HI>Is.</HI> 55.3. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.10. <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.18, 19. with many more that may be quoted
<PB N="29" REF="004588_0029_100DA5CB60933BC0"/>
to the same Purpose? Do not we on the other Hand, read of Men's Covenanting with God, 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> 23.3. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34.31. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.10. <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.38? How can we give up the <HI>many</HI> Scores of Scripture Texts, that seem plainly to import that the second Covenant is made with Believers in Christ Jesus? <HI>Would this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Reformation?</HI> May not we as rationally give up the whole Bi∣ble, as any considerable Part of it? Will it do, that we <HI>believe as Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>speaks or writes contrary to plain Scripture Texts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> VI. Is it any Thing like a solid Way of Arguing, for Men to say, that there is a Covenant of Redemption, therefore there is no Covenant of Grace; when the very Design of the one was to lay a Foundation for the other: Or, because there is a Co∣venant made with the Redeemer, therefore there is none made with the Redeemed Ones, to whom Christ is said to be <HI>given as a Covenant of the People?</HI> Is it any Ar∣gument, that because there was a Covenant made with Christ as second <HI>Adam</HI> and pub∣lick Head of his elect Seed; therefore there was no Covenant made with his Seed in Time? Is it any Argument that because
<PB N="30" REF="004588_0030_100DA5CD24D23D30"/>
there was a Council of Peace from all E∣ternity, between the Father and the Son, that therefore there is no Covenant of Peace and Reconciliation transacted in Time, thro' the Mediator, with fallen Sinners? How could the former be of any Use without the latter follow?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> VII. If it be said, that the second Co∣venant could not be made with <HI>Adam,</HI> or any of his Posterity, because it was made primarily with Christ; may not we as well say, that the first Covenant was not at all made with us, because it was made pri∣marily with <HI>Adam,</HI> as our Surety and Co∣venant Head? Was not the very mak∣ing of the first Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> as a publick Person, the making of that Cove∣nant at least virtually with us in him? Was not the making of the second Cove∣nant with Christ as a publick Person, vir∣tualy the making that Covenant with us? Did not the Consent of our Representative make us Parties in the first Covenant? Why then will not the Consent of the se∣cond <HI>Adam</HI> make his Covenant-Seed Parties in his Covenant as well? If the Consent of our Representative doth not make us Par∣ties in the first Covenant, how are we born
<PB N="31" REF="004588_0031_100DA5D0093E97A8"/>
under the Guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s first Sin? How are Infants in the Womb bereaved of Ori∣ginal Righteousness and born in Sin? Is not the Original Pollutions of our Natures the Fruit and Punishment of the first Trans∣gression of <HI>Adam?</HI> If an implicite Consent to the Terms of the first Covenant in grown Persons, and acting accordingly, be a Bond firm enough to keep and hold us Parties in that Covenant; Why will not an explicite Consent to the Terms of the second Cove∣nant make us Covenanters with God? Do not Believers, when they come to believe and profess Faith in Christ, as expressly and explicitly enter under the Bond of the second Covenant, as any of the Sons of <HI>A∣dam</HI> ever entered into the Bond of the first? Besides, if the Consent of our Head and Su∣rety in the second Covenant, doth not make us Subjects and Parties in the Cove∣nant; How then can Infants be regenerated and saved?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> VIII. If there be not any second Co∣venant at all made with Men, how can the Sacraments be called sealing Ordinances? Can they Seal the Covenant to us, if it be true there is <HI>none</HI> made with us? Can the Covenant be confirmed to us by Seals, be∣fore,
<PB N="32" REF="004588_0032_100DA5D21AFC14C0"/>
or without it is made with us? And doth not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> seem to allow, that the Sacraments are sealing Ordinances? when he saith in his Journal, <HI>p.</HI> 110. <Q>This Day <HI>24</HI> Years, was I baptized; Lord! to what little Purpose have I lived? However, I sealed my <HI>baptismal Covenant</HI> with my dear Saviour's most blessed Body and Blood, and trust in his Strength I shall keep and per∣form it.</Q> Now, what Covenant is that, which is transacted over between God and Believers in all Ages, in the Use of sealing Ordinances, if it be not the Covenant of Grace, or the second Covenant?</P>
<P N="5">V. In the same Letter, <HI>p.</HI> 4. Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> further Asks, Where any Covenant is contained in these Words, "the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head," and how it is "made up of some Mercies to be afforded by God, and some Duties to be performed by us?" Here is a free Gift and Promise of Salvation made to <HI>Adam,</HI> but no Covenant. Here is not a Word of a <HI>Condition mentioned.</HI> — No, it was the free Gift of God in Christ.—</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. Was not here (besides a Promise of Salvation through Christ) so also the Pro∣mise of Christ himself to be a Saviour and
<PB N="33" REF="004588_0033_100DA5D48753AFC8"/>
Covenant of the People herein included and primarily intended?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. Tho' we freely grant there is no express Condition mentioned in said Pro∣mise, yet we would again ask doth not every Promise in our Bible, in the Nature fo it, require Faith to believe and embrace it, before we can reap the Benefit of it, and consequently contain an <HI>implicit Condition?</HI> besides what are the both Testaments, but a fuller Explication of this Promise? And is it not evident, that there are many <HI>con∣ditional Promises</HI> added to the absolute Pro∣mises, that so we may have a compleat View of this Covenant? Can any Man expect to have a truer View of the second Covenant, as to the compleat Nature of it, in that initial and first Edition of it, than by a fuller View of all its Edition com∣pared together? Are there not many weighty Truths and Lessons to be learned from the after Editions thereof, touching the Nature of this Covenant, which are of absolute Necessity to Salvation, now under the Dispensations we are under? Is not there more required of those that received more?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> III. Whether it be not as great an Er∣ror in Divinity, to deny consequent Con∣ditions
<PB N="34" REF="004588_0034_100DA5D7B007DA48"/>
for Duties in the second Covenant, as to assert antecedent Conditions therein? Doth not the one run as far into the <HI>Anti∣nomian</HI> as the other runs in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme; and so leave the true Gospel Doc∣trine, or <HI>Calvinistical</HI> and <HI>Lutheran</HI> Scheme, in the Middle betwen these two strained Extremes? Doth not the Law, as a Rule of Life, require Duties of those that are de∣livered from under the Law as a Cove∣nant? if there be <HI>no Duties required</HI> in the second Covenant, to what Purpose are we so often press'd to the Performance of them, in the Old and New Testament; and why are the Neglecters of them so often blamed and reproved?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> IV. Whether Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> well a∣grees with himself or Truth, in seemingly denying <HI>any Condition or Duties</HI> in the se∣cond Covenant <HI>one while,</HI> as may be seen in the forecited Letter, <HI>p.</HI> 4, 5. when he him∣self <HI>elsewhere</HI> presses Men to perform <HI>those easy Conditions</HI> prescribed by our Saviour, as necessary to Salvation, and upon Pain of Damnation, as appears by <HI>p.</HI> 71. &amp; 92. of <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. of his Sermons printed at <HI>Phila∣delphia?</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="35" REF="004588_0035_100DA5D9E2A5FAD8"/>VI. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> in his Sermon on <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.37, 38, 39. in his opening or explaining the Apostle's Commissiion, <HI>p.</HI> 8, 9. [<HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 128.] hath these Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>For tho' we translate these Words, <HI>baptizing them in the Name;</HI> yet as the Name of God, in the Lord's Prayer, and several other Places, signifies his Nature, they might as well be translated thus, <HI>baptizing them into the Nature of the Father, into the Nature of the Son, and into the Nature of the Holy Ghost.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. Whether it be not an Error to say, that <HI>by God's Name, in the Lord's Prayer, we are to understand his Nature?</HI> Are not we to understand by God's Name there, his Word, his Works, his Ordinances, especi∣ally his Titles, Attributes, and every Thing whereby God makes himself known, as we are taught by other Authors?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. Whereas Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> before ac∣knowledges, that this Commission author∣izes Ministers to baptize the proper Subjects of Baptism in all Ages, we would ask, in what Age of the New Testament Church, could mere Men fulfil it, in the Sense Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> gives of it, by baptizing Men <HI>in∣to the Nature of the Father, and into the Na∣ture
<PB N="36" REF="004588_0036_100DA5DBF93CAA08"/>
of the Son, and Holy Ghost?</HI> What can be meant by <HI>baptizing Men into the Nature of the Father, &amp;c.</HI> unless it be regenerating Men? If so, can one Man regenerate an∣other? How then could this Commission be fulfilled? If the Priest can fulfil this Commission in this Sense of it, why may not he as well <HI>turn</HI> the Bread and Wine in the other Sacrament, into the true Body and Blood of Christ? And when Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> as we have noted already, speaks elsewhere of the <HI>spiritual Body</HI> and <HI>spiritual Blood</HI> of Jesus Christ, with which <HI>Souls are nourished,</HI> we would ask, whether this doth not savour something of Transubstantia∣tion? For tho' we freely own, according to the Scripture, that God prepared him a natural Body, which he offered once a Sa∣crifice for Sin; yet we would know a Crea∣ture of whose making is Christ's spiritual Body and Blood, if it be not a Creature of the Priest's Making?</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Q.</HI> I. How doth Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> a∣gree with himself, when in <HI>p.</HI> 9. [<HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 128] of last cited Sermon, he saith, <Q>It is evident, that we all must <HI>actually receive the Holy Ghost,</HI> e'er we can say, <HI>that we truly believe in</HI> Jesus Christ,</Q> compared with
<PB N="37" REF="004588_0037_100DA5DEB0867858"/>
what he saith in <HI>p.</HI> 18. [<HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 137.] of the same Sermon, which is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>For notwithstanding you are all now sunk into the Nature of the Beast and the Devil, yet if you <HI>truly believe</HI> on Jesus Christ, <HI>you shall receive</HI> the quickning Spirit promised in the Text, and be restored to the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God?</Q> Doth not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in this last Clause seem to make <HI>true Faith</HI> an antecedent Condition to Men in the State of Nature, to be performed by them <HI>in order</HI> to receive the quickning Spi∣rit? May not a dead Man walk as easy as this? Is not not there better Divinity in that Paragraph of the Book entituled, <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> excepted against, than this, when he saith, <Q>that the third Thing Christ was to do for us, was <HI>to enable us,</HI> or give us Strength, to do what he requires of us? <HI>Now, if we must</HI> 'truly believe, e'er we receive the quickning Spirit,</Q> are we not left to our <HI>own Strength</HI> in the first and most difficult Step?</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In the <HI>Vol.</HI> I. of <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Sermons printed at <HI>Philadelphia, p.</HI> 7. Whether or no Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Doctrinal Query or Propo∣sition, which runs thus, <Q>why we must be <HI>new Creatures,</HI> in <HI>order</HI> to <HI>qualify</HI> us for
<PB N="38" REF="004588_0038_100DA5E09FAC6DD0"/>
<HI>being savingly in</HI> Christ,</Q> be not of the same Purport, and amount to as much <HI>He∣terodoxy,</HI> as what Arch-Bishop <HI>Tillotson</HI> saith, by entituling his Book, <Q>On the Nature of Regeneration, and its Necessity in order to our Justification and Salvation</Q>? And may not the same Consequences be as natively drawn from the former, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> draws from the latter, in his first Letter against the Archbishop, <HI>p</HI> 3?</P>
<P N="9">IX. In <HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 14. Whether or no Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s calling <Q>Prayer, Fasting, Hear∣ing, Reading, and the Sacraments, not only Means, but also <HI>essential ones</HI> too,</Q> be not <HI>popish Dialect?</HI> We own the Means of Grace and Use of them, necessary to us, be∣cause commanded; but cannot God save Men without them?</P>
<P N="10">X. In <HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 16. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> hath these Words, <Q>It is to be feared we shall be found naked at the great Day, and in the Number of those who vainly depend on their own Righteousness, and not on the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, imputed to <HI>and inherent</HI> in them, as necessary to their eternal Salvation.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. How can the Righteousness of Christ, which is <HI>infinite</HI> Righteousness, <HI>in∣here</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="004588_0039_100DA5E27483C190"/>
in any <HI>finite Creature?</HI> Must not we be <HI>equally Righteous</HI> with Christ himself, if his Righteousness <HI>inhere in us?</HI> If Christ's Righteousness <HI>inhere in us,</HI> where should there be any Room for, or Need of the <HI>Im∣putation</HI> of it to us?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. If it be said that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in∣tends no more than the Necessity of inhe∣rent Righteousness, as part of our Sanctifi∣cation, then we would ask, is this to be <HI>de∣pended upon</HI> as well as imputed Righteous∣ness? Or, are we to have and excercise <HI>a joint Dependance</HI> upon <HI>inherent</HI> and <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> as the Righteousness of Christ? Is not this <HI>Calvinism</HI> and <HI>Quaker∣ism</HI> mixt together? Is it not the false No∣tion that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> elsewhere seems to entertain of a real, tho' a spiritual forming of the <HI>Man Christ Jesus</HI> in Believers, the Ground of his Error in this Point?</P>
<P N="11">XI. In <HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 79. where Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> speaking of Self denial and a <HI>single Aim</HI> at God's Glory, hath these Words, <Q>It is this, my Brethren, that distinguishes the true Chri∣stian from the meer Moralist and formal Pro∣fessor, and <HI>which alone can render any</HI> of our Actions acceptable in God's Sight.</Q></P>

Whether Men may not <HI>aim at God's Glory</HI> in those Actions done in a <HI>blind Zeal?</HI> And may not some such deny themselves in giving up their own Understandings and Wills, Believing, and Acting as the Church, or their Guides do? Are such Actions, <HI>contrary to Rule,</HI> acceptable merely upon <HI>Account</HI> of a <HI>good Aim?</HI> It is hard to say, but that <HI>Uzzah</HI> might have a <HI>good Aim</HI> in stretching forth his Hand to touch the Ark; but did not the Event prove that the Action was not <HI>acceptable?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> II. Must not all good Actions pro∣ceed from a good Principle, be done in a right and due Manner, and for a good End; and after all, must not the Merits of Christ be the <HI>sole Cause</HI> of the <HI>Acceptance</HI> of such Ac∣tions? How <HI>Harsh</HI> doth it sound in the Ears of all true Protestants, that <HI>any Thing</HI> in the Action itself, be proclaimed as the <HI>alone Cause</HI> or Reason of its being accepta∣ble in God's Sight?</P>
<P N="12">XII. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in his Journal, <HI>p.</HI> 20. speaking before of the <HI>Scotch▪</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Protestants keeping distinct Societies at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> makes this Remark, <Q>What a pity it is that Christ's seamless Coat should be rent in Pieces on the Account of Things in themselves <HI>purely indifferent!</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="004588_0041_100DA5E800A55050"/><HI>Quer.</HI> I. What is meant by Christ's seamless Coat that is rent in Pieces by Men's meeting in different Places to Wor∣ship God in a Way that seems to them most agreeable to God's Word; when in some of those Places, Things in themselves purely indifferent, and more than that (as has been often shewn) some Things of a more dark and doubtful Nature, at least according to the Apprehension of the one side, are imposed as necessary Terms of Communion? Doth not Men's Agreements in Fundamentals save the seamless Coat whole, tho' Men worship in different Pla∣ces, because of disagreement in some <HI>lesser Point.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> II. Doth not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s join∣ing cordially (as we suppose) with both Parties, by conforming to their different Ways and Modes, strengthen the Hands of the one in imposing, and of the other in separating, and so help to make the <HI>Rent wider?</HI> It is true, he may in his Doctrine cry against the one and the other for Bigot∣ry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But how is this <HI>convincing,</HI> when his Practice seems to <HI>justify</HI> both Sides?

If <HI>Antinomians, Arminians,</HI> and <HI>Calvinists,</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> while each of them adheres to his different Scheme, should, for some <HI>politick End,</HI> lay aside their Jarrs, and join Hands, and agree to make one Community or Church; whe∣ther there may not be just Grounds to fear that such a Church may sooner turn a <HI>Ba∣bel,</HI> than a <HI>Pillar of Truth?</HI> Whether it be an advisable Remedy, for Men to swal∣low whole Pounds of <HI>Babel Bigotry,</HI> upon the bare Advice of some hot-headed Empyrick, to purge out a few Grains of <HI>Party Bigotry,</HI> till we know that the former is of a <HI>purging Nature?</HI> We grant that Unity among all

<P N="14">XIV.

If the Word was <HI>silent,</HI> what need was there of determining it? If the Word spoke, why was not the <HI>Sentence there

And we would be glad to know how far this may be safe? And further, we desire to know, how far it may <HI>be safe to trust to such Guides who are so much in the Dark that they are obliged at Seasons to solve their own Doubts by Lots?</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in his Journal, <HI>p.</HI> 127. saith, <Q>I find I gain greater Light and Knowledge by preaching extempore; so that I fear I should <HI>quench the Spirit,</HI> did I not go on to speak as <HI>He gives me utterance.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. If by preaching <HI>extempore,</HI> be meant preaching without Premeditation or Study∣ing, we would ask, whether any since the Days of <HI>Moses,</HI> that were sound in the Faith, have <HI>said</HI> that they gained more scripture Light and Knowledge by not read∣ing and meditating on God's Word, than by so doing? Doth not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in this differ in Judgment from Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="004588_0046_100DA5F3E7D37EE0"/>
as far as the Doctor differed in other Points from Archbishop <HI>Tillotson?</HI></P>
<P>Is it any Way likely, that God should own us the <HI>better,</HI> because <HI>we neglect plain Duties,</HI> than if we perform them? If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> means any thing else by preach∣ing extempore, should he not explain him∣self, that so <HI>Quakers</HI> and others may not be misled, to depend on immediate impul∣ses and Revelations by such Hints;</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. Is there any Grounds of Fear of <HI>quenching God's Spirit,</HI> whether in his ordi∣nary or extraordinary Gifts, <HI>by performing the plain Duties</HI> of Reading of and meditat∣ing on God's Word? Is not here a plain Insinuation of immediate Impulses, and De∣pendance thereupon? If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> will allow us <HI>to try the Spirits,</HI> what Spirit is that Mr. <HI>Whitefield fears to quench</HI> by reading the Scriptures, or meditating on them? or by reading and studying other good Books, or by writing his Sermons, and making a moderate Use of his Notes to help his Memory? yea, would not this be much better than making plain Blunders for want thereof, if Men's Memories do not serve them without this Care? For tho' we own, that we like no Preacher the better
<PB N="47" REF="004588_0047_100DA5F65E345C60"/>
for his using Notes, if he hath a good Inven∣tion and Memory to do well without them; yet, doth not preaching with Notes, if done to Purpose, require as much, if not more Premeditation and Study, than when they are not used? For tho' we own that <HI>Con∣fidence and Assurance</HI> may help Men to rub along and a good Utterance may please many <HI>who regard Sound more than Matter;</HI> yet, is it not evident, by comparing Mt. <HI>White∣field</HI>'s printed Sermons with other good Sermon Books, that some of our old <HI>Scots</HI> Divines have <HI>more Matter in one Page</HI> than he hath <HI>in several Pages?</HI> And is it not true, that tho' Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> speaks many sound Truths on some <HI>common Heads of Di∣vinity;</HI> yet, we desire to know, what Point in Divinity is that which some other Di∣vines of our own have not <HI>more than treb∣bled him in Distinctness, Exactness and Expli∣citeness?</HI> And will any tell us what is the Reason, that <HI>many late Sermons</HI> preached by Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s warm Adherents, are (if we mistake not) <HI>more barren of Matter and Method,</HI> than some of their former Sermons, as being more hung on a common String, if this proceed not <HI>from Want of Studying?</HI>

<P><HI>Quer.</HI> I. Do not <HI>Quakers</HI> in general cast off the written Word from being a primary Rule of Faith and Practice, and make it at best but a secondary Rule, which only some of them will grant; which, in Effect, is to say, that it is none at all; for if Scripture be only a secondary Rule, then it is no Rule; for a Rule must be primary in its Kind; for if so, the Scripture is no further a Rule than thus, if the Spirit, at Seasons, speaks well of any Part, that is then to be followed; but if the Spirit doth prompt to throw off any Part of it, then it is not to be regarded; for the Spirit is not to be try∣ed by the Rule of the Scripture, as being a higher Rule? If this be not their Notion, we do not understand their Writings.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. How can Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> be thought sound and orthodox in this Point, if he judges those that pretend to walk by im∣mediate Revelations and Impulses, have right and good Notions?

<P N="19">XIX. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> in his Journal, <HI>p.</HI> 212. partly speaking and partly writing to Mr. <HI>Kinchin,</HI> who, as it would seem, was under some Scruples about the Habits, and some other Things, probably the Ceremonies and Canons in the establish'd Church, and so was like to leave the Church and turn Dissenter, says thus, <Q>This, I must needs con∣fess gave me a <HI>great Shock:</HI> For I knew what dreadful Consequences would attend a <HI>needless Separation</HI> from the establish'd Church. — As for my own Part, I can see <HI>no Reason</HI> for <HI>leaving</HI> the Church, however I am treated by the <HI>corrupt Members</HI> and Ministers of it: For I judge the State of the Church, not from the Practice of its Members but its <HI>primitive</HI> and publick Constitutions.</Q></P>

the Vestments, Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be a <HI>needless Separation?</HI> Is it not evident, to those that are any Way conversant in the late History of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> that many <HI>conscientious Churchmen</HI> suffered severe Pe∣nalties, by Exclusions and Imprisonments, for not conforming to those, before there was a <HI>separate Dissenter</HI> in <HI>England?</HI> Did not many of the Bishops then declare against the Vestments, in plain Terms, who com∣plied afterwards <HI>merely</HI> in Obedience to their Sovereign, as Head of the Church? What are the dreadful Consequences that have attended such a Separation, in consci∣entious and orthodox Dissenters, who have kept themselves <HI>within the Limitts of the Act of Tolleration?</HI> Would not more dreadful Consequences attend Men's conforming a∣gainst the Dictates of their own Conscien∣ces? Do not more dreadful Consequences attend Men's <HI>making schisms or Factions in the Church,</HI> than <HI>by a quiet and peaceable Separation from it?</HI> Did not Dr. <HI>Sacheveral,</HI> in his Time, make <HI>more Disturbance and Uproar,</HI> by raising the Mobs and warming them, than all the Dissenters in <HI>England?</HI> In what Country was it, that designing Men, that aimed <HI>to draw a Party after them,</HI>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. Whether Corruption in Ministers and Members, <HI>when incurable,</HI> either for Want of Discipline, or the due Exercise of it, be not a just Cause of Separation, to e∣very one that judges in Conscience that Mi∣nisters and Members are generally become corrupt?

<P N="21">XXI.

<P><HI>Quer.</HI> I. Why should the Business of an Attorney be thought <HI>unlawful,</HI> or at least <HI>exceeding dangerous,</HI> if <HI>conscientiously</HI> dis∣charged? Is not the Civil Law, in its Place, as well as the Divine, still Good, if foun∣ded upon Equity, and lawfully used? How can poor Farmers have the Priviledge of the Law, unless they are <HI>brought up to it</HI> themselves, without the Help of consci∣entious Attornies, well versed in the Law, to plead for them?

are some how put in a Way to obtain the Priviledge of them in proper Seasons? Is it not more dangerous by far, for Men to <HI>trust</HI> Lives and Fortunes in the Hands of <HI>unchristian Advocates</HI> and Judges? Are not honest and Christian Attornies <HI>one great Defence,</HI> under God and the King, of our Christian and Civil Priviledges? What will engage Men to <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in such Places, <HI>more</HI> than the <HI>true Fear of God,</HI> and the <HI>firm Attachment</HI> to true Christian Prin∣ciples, and their viewing of the <HI>Sacred and Civil Priviledges of</HI> others as <HI>their own</HI> in common with others? Have not even <HI>Quakers</HI> now adays in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> come over their Scruples in this Point?</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> II. If a <HI>Civil Office</HI> in the Com∣mon-Wealth be <HI>unlawful,</HI> at least exceed∣ing dangerous, <HI>how dangerous</HI> and unlaw∣ful must a Military-Office be?

<HEAD>A LETTER from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> to some Church-Members of the <HI>Presbyte∣rian</HI> Perswasion. In Answer to certain Scruples lately Proposed in proper Queries raised on each Remark.</HEAD>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE Received your Queries and Scruples. — Whether they were compli'd by Church Mem∣bers, or Ministers of the <HI>Presby∣terian</HI> Perswasion, I shall not take upon me to Determine. — I think I may say with <HI>David,</HI> on another Occasion, <HI>Joab's Hand is in this.</HI> — If your Ministers were really the Authors, and you only their Represen∣tatives, they have not acted with simplici∣ty, They had better have spoken out, I should have as readily answered them as

<PB N="61" REF="004588_0061_100DA61C094C3BD8"/>
— No Wonder then that I was not so clear at the first setting out in the Ministry. — Our Lord was pleased to Enlighten me by degrees, and I desire your Prayers that His Grace may shine more and more in my Heart, till it breaks forth into per∣fect Day.</P>
<P>But to come to the Exceptionable Passa∣ges of my Sermons. You blame me for saying, Pag. 17. vol. 2. That <HI>Adam</HI> was a∣dorn'd with all the Perfection of the Deity. It's a wrong Expression, I would correct it thus, <HI>All the Moral Communicable Perfections of the Deity.</HI> Again, Man was the Perfec∣tion of the <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Materail World.</HI> — Let it stand thus, <HI>The Perfection of all the Visible World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 22. 23. vol. 2. <HI>Washes the Guilt of sin away by the Tears of a sincere Repentance, joyn'd with Faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ.'</HI> This is false Divinity, I would now alter it thus, <HI>Recovers his former Peace by renew∣ing his Acts of Faith on the perfect Righteous∣ness of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P><HI>P.</HI> 16. vol. 1. <HI>Who vainly depend on their own Righteousness, and not on the Righteous∣ness of Jesus Christ imputed to and inherent in them, as necessary for their Eternal Salva∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>To avoid all mistakes, I would express myself in this manner, <HI>Who have neither Christ's Righteousness imputed to them for Jus∣tification in the sight of God, nor Holiness wrought in their Souls as the Consequence of that, in order to make them meet for the En∣joyment of God.</HI></P>

<P>I see no Reason to alter my Explanation of the Words, <HI>Baptizing them into the Na∣ture of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</HI> and <HI>Christ spiritually conceived in the Heart of</HI> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. — I mean no more by these Expres∣sions than the Apostle when he says, <HI>Know you not that Christ is</HI> IN <HI>you, except you be Reprobates.</HI> And again, <HI>No Man can call Christ Lord but by the Holy Ghost.</HI> And again, <HI>We are made Partakers of a Divine Nature.</HI></P>

<P>These, if I mistake not, are all the Passages in my Sermons which you object against.
<PB N="64" REF="004588_0064_100DA623235ADF70"/>
And now to convince you, that I am not a∣shamed to ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Faults, I can inform you of other Passages as justly exceptionable. In my Sermon <HI>on Justification,</HI> I seem to as∣sert <HI>universal Redemption,</HI> which I now abso∣lutely deny. — In my <HI>Almost Christian,</HI> I talk of <HI>Works procuring us so high a Crown.</HI> In my Sermon <HI>on the Marks of the new Birth,</HI> I say, <HI>We shall endure to the End, if we con∣tinue, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These, and perhaps some other Passages, tho' capable of a candid Interpretation, I now mislike, and in the next Edition of my Sermons, God willing, I propose to alter them. — In the mean while, I shall be thankful to any that will point out my Er∣rors and I promise, by divine Assistance, they shall have no Reason to say, that I am one who hates <HI>to be reformed. Let the Righteous smite me, it shall be a Kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent Oil, which shall not break my Head; for yet my Prayer also shall be in their Calamites.</HI></P>
<P>As for your insinuating, that I counte∣nance Mr. <HI>Wesly</HI> in his Errors, it is no such Thing. I prefaced <HI>Haly Burton's</HI> Memoirs, before I saw what Mr. <HI>Wesly</HI> wrote, and since I have seen it, have more than once
<PB N="65" REF="004588_0065_100DA62572135600"/>
said, if I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> known what Mr. <HI>Wesly</HI> had wrote, I would not have prefaced <HI>Haly Bur∣ton</HI> at all. — I do not understand Mr. <HI>Wesly</HI> in his Interpretation of these Words, <HI>He that is born again of God, sinneth not;</HI> and therefore have torn that Part out of several of those Books which I have given away lately, and have acquainted him of what I think on this Particular he errs, in sundry <HI>Letters.</HI></P>
<P>You wrong me if you think I am an <HI>An∣tinomian:</HI> For when I say, <HI>God made no second Covenant with</HI> Adam, I mean no more than this, <HI>God made no second Covenant with</HI> Adam <HI>in his own Person, in behalf of his Posterity.</HI> Nor did Man's Acceptance in the Sight of God, after the Fall, depend either wholly or in Part on his Works, as before the Fall. Whoever reads the Author of <HI>the whole Duty of Man,</HI> will find he thinks otherwise, and I believe your Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> will not thank you for defend∣ing <HI>the Whole Duty of Man,</HI> as you seeming∣ly have done in the late Queries.</P>
<P>Your Objection concerning my favoura∣ble Opinion of some particular <HI>Quakers,</HI> I conversed with, and also about some parti∣cular Promises, which I think have been
<PB N="66" REF="004588_0066_100DA6279D120440"/>
made me; you may be satisfied in my <HI>An∣swer to the Bishop of London's last Pastoral Letter,</HI> and in a Letter sent to the Bishop of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and published in one Part of my Journals.</P>
<P>I am no Friend to casting Lots: But I believe on extraordinary Occasions, when Things can be determined no other Way, God, if applied to, and waited on by Pray∣er and Fasting, will answer by Lots now, as well as formerly.</P>
<P>Do not condemn me <HI>for Preaching extem∣pore,</HI> and saying, <HI>I am helped often immediate∣ly in that Exercise,</HI> when Thousands can prove as well as my self, it has been so.— Neither should you censure me as one that would lay aside Reading. I am of Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI>'s Mind▪ <HI>Study without Prayer is A∣theism. Prayer without Study Presumption.</HI>— Blame me not for the Warmth of some of my Adherents, as you call them. One of your Ministers knows how sharply I rebuk∣ed one of them for his Warmth at <HI>Fogg's</HI> Mannor. I am for loving as Brethren, and wish all would copy after the lowly <HI>Jesus:</HI> But then I cannot discommend those (sup∣posing they do it in the Spirit of Meekness) who complain against <HI>dry sapless unconverted
<PB N="67" REF="004588_0067_100DA629EB7DF8E0"/>
Ministers.</HI> — Such surely are the Bane of the Christian Church.</P>
<P>But my other Affairs will not permit me to enlarge. Some of the latter part of your Queries, for your own, and not for my sake I shall not mention. I hope I can say with more Sincerity than <HI>Hazael, Is your Servant a Dog, that he should do what you suggest?</HI> But I pray God forgive you. He knows my Heart. My own Design is to bring poor Souls to Jesus Christ. I desire to avoid Ex∣treams, so as not to be a Bigot on the one Hand, or confound Order and Decency on the other. And I could heartily wish, the Rev. Presbytery, when they advised you to publish your Queries, had also cautioned you against dipping your Pen in so much Gall. Surely your Insinuations are contra∣ry to that Charity, that <HI>hopeth and believeth all Things for the best.</HI> And I appeal to your own Hearts, whether it was right, especial∣ly since you heard the constant Tenour of my Preaching in <HI>America,</HI> has been <HI>Calvi∣nistical,</HI> to censure me as a <HI>Papist</HI> or <HI>Armini∣an,</HI> because a few unguarded Expressions dropped from my Pen just as I came out of the University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> Could Arch-Bi∣shop <HI>Tillotson</HI> or the <HI>Author of the whole

<P>I Have seen your printed Answer to certain <HI>Queries</HI> lately published, and observe with great Satisfaction, the Evidence you there give of a truly Christian Humility. And it is this emboldens me to tell you, That, in my Opinion, you have not in all Points set Things right; but some of your Corrections are as liable to Exceptions as the Passages you have corrected. I will give you a Specimen: Instead of "A∣dam <HI>was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity</HI>" you correct it, "<HI>All the</HI> moral communicable <HI>Perfections of the Deity.</HI> "— Was not Man created a little lower than the Angels? And if so, were there not some

<HI>moral Perfections</HI> communicated to them, which were not communicated to him? For otherwise in what Sense could he be said to be <HI>inferior</HI> to them? And it would be absurd to say, That any Thing could be <HI>communicated</HI> that was not <HI>communicable.</HI>— I hope I have a true Sense of the Power and Usefulness of your Ministry, and wish it, from my Soul and Spirit all the Success it deserves: But at the same Time sincerely wish, that all Errors may be removed, and every Let and Hinderance taken away. I therefore beg, that you will furnish me with the means of Answering what may be objected to the above Passage, by leaving a Letter at Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI>'s, directed to.</P>

<P>IN your Answer to the <HI>Queries</HI> you say, That to the Honour of free distinguish∣ing Grace, you recieved the Spirit of A∣doption, before you had conversed with one Man, or read a single Book, on the Doctrine of <HI>Free Justification by the Imputed Righte∣ousness

of</HI> JESUS CHRIST; and therefore, no Wonder that you was not so clear in some Points at your first setting out in the Ministry."— This Declaration to me seems clearly to imply, That the Spirit of A∣doption alone, without the Aid of human Conversation or Books, is not sufficient ful∣ly to accomplish a Christian Minister, but that human Conversation and Books are absolutely necessary, in order further to <HI>enlighten</HI> him. — As I understood you in this Sense, and further," That it is not yet <HI>perfect Day</HI> with you," I concluded you would readily retract any of your Errors, even now, since you are not fully enlight∣ened; and more especially, as you say in your Answer to the <HI>Queries,</HI> "That you shall be thankful to any that shall point out your Errors; and promise, by Divine Assistance, they shall have no Reason to say, That you are one who hates to be reform∣ed." — It was the Strength of this Con∣clusion, that I thought it proper, not only to pray that God's Grace might shine more and more in your Heart, but also to trou∣ble you with my Letter of the 11th Instant.</P>
<P>The high Opinion I had entertained of your great Candour, Sincerity, and Zeal

for Truth, induced me to expect to Answer; and I would still gladly recieve that Satis∣faction. But as I find you have hitherto declined it, and for which I am at a Loss for a good Reason; I therefore take this Occasion to let you know, that if you any <HI>longer decline</HI> doing what every Christian Enquirer has a Right to demand of you u∣pon such Occasions, I will immediately call upon you in a publick Manner, by printing both this, and my former Letter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have perused your <HI>Sermon,</HI> entitled, <HI>What think you of Christ;</HI> to which you were pleased to refer me t'other Day, in support of your Charge, or rather railing Accusation against the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in general, and the present <HI>Bi∣shop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> in particular, of their teach∣ing false Doctrine, contrary to the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and the Articles of the Church, in explain∣ing that of <HI>Justification by Faith alone,</HI> in such a Manner, as including good Works a ne∣cessary Condition. This <HI>Sermon</HI> of Yours, I say, I have perused, and made some Observa∣tions upon; but of which, I shall at present only Trouble you with the following single one, on a Parag. P. 18. in which your Words are these: <Q>Observe my dear Brethren the Words of the Article, <HI>good Works are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Justificati∣on.</HI> How then can they precede, or be any Ways the Cause of it? No, our Persons must be justified, before our Performances are accepted.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="004588_0074_100DA63ADDB80458"/>Now, Sir, passing over your using the Word <HI>Cause</HI> for <HI>Condition;</HI> pray how was it possible for you, after setting down the Article at large in the next preceding Page, thus to explain it into a Contrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction to your own Doctrine? As if good Works which are <HI>the Fruits of Faith</HI> and <HI>pleasing to God,</HI> did not precede <HI>Justification,</HI> but fol∣low after it only. For as a true and lively Faith, you admit, must <HI>precede</HI> Justificati∣on; so <HI>good Works,</HI> teacheth the latter Part of this Article, <HI>do spring necessarily out of a true and lively Faith.</HI> Now, if good Works do <HI>necessarily spring</HI> out of a true and <HI>lively</HI> Faith, and a true and <HI>lively</HI> Faith <HI>necessari∣ly precedes</HI> Justification, the Consequence is plain that good Works must not only follow after but precede Justification also. And there∣fore your explaining the Article so, as to se∣parate a true and lively Faith from good Works, admitting the one to go before, and the other only to follow after <HI>Justification,</HI> is explaining the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cle into a Contradic∣tion to your own Doctrine.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BOTH by your Conversation, Sermon and Letter, I perceive that you are angry over∣much. Was I never so inclined to dispute, I would stay till the Cool of the Day. Your Letter more and more confirms me, that my Charge against the Clergy is just and reason∣able. It would be endless to enter into such a private Debate, as you, Rev. Sir seem de∣sirous of. You have read my Sermon; be pleased to read it again. And if there be any Thing contrary to sound Doctrine, or the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> be pleased to let the Publick know it from the Press. And then let the World judge, whether you or my Brethren the Clergy have been rashly slan∣dered by</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have receiv'd your Letter of this Day but it will not do. The Difficulty I proposed, is of no small Importance with me, who have not only my own, but the Souls of many others committed to my Charge, concerned in it.</P>
<P>I firmly believe, and have always taught, that <HI>good Works</HI> do as necessarily spring from, and accompany a true and <HI>lively</HI> Faith, whether <HI>before or after</HI> Justification, as Light and Heat do the Sun; or that, <HI>as the Body without the Soul is dead, so Faith without Works,</HI> whether before or after Justification, <HI>is dead also.</HI> If this be an Error; if in this I'm departed from the <HI>Gospel</HI> and the <HI>Articles of the Church,</HI> will you not endeavour to restore me? Sure, if not the Precept and Example of our great Master, the common Bowels of Hu∣manity will induce you to do a Thing, on

<HEAD><HI>LETTER III.</HI> To the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu'll excuse the Trouble of this, by Way of Supplement to my former Letters, and containing also a few Queries concerning your present Behaviour as a Presbyter of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot but know, that to bring a criminal Accusation against any one, with∣out sufficient Evidence or Proof to support it, is wilful and malicious Slander: But, this, Sir, you have done against your Bre∣thren of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in your <HI>Sermon</HI> entitled, <HI>What think ye of Christ.</HI> In
<PB N="78" REF="004588_0078_100DA64399D51920"/>
that Sermon (<HI>P.</HI> 18.) you have accused them, of <HI>not Preaching the Truth as it is in</HI> Jesus; of <HI>falling from our establish'd Doctrines;</HI> and of <HI>preaching only the Law</HI> and <HI>not shew∣ing the Way of Salvation by Faith in</HI> Christ Jesus; that is of preaching Justification by Works, and not by Faith only. Thus you have accused your Brethren in that <HI>Sermon;</HI> but where are the Proofs of your Accusation? What Evidence have you therein brought to support your Charge? Not the least Shadow or Appearance of any such Thing throughout the Whole. — But what Need (you'll say) of Proof in so plain a Case? The <HI>Clergy</HI> indeed pretend to Preach the true Doctrine of <HI>Justification by Faith only;</HI> but in explaining, do they not destroy it? Do they not explain it, as the present Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> in his 4th Pastor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Letter, <HI>hopes</HI> they do; <HI>viz. That the Faith by which only we are justified must be true and lively or productive of good Works,</HI> and consequently <HI>That good Works are a ne∣cessary Condition</HI> (included in that Faith) <HI>of our being justified in the Sight of God?</HI> And is not this explaining the Doctrine into a Contradiction? Is it not <HI>preaching a new Gospel?</HI> Preaching <HI>Justification by Works, and not by Faith only.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="004588_0079_100DA6464A3C1E00"/>Well then, the Doctrine the Clergy preach, which you are so angry at, and cen∣sure as preaching Justification by <HI>Works, and not by Faith only,</HI> is this; that <HI>we are justified by Faith only and not by Works;</HI> thus explained, <HI>viz. that we are justified by such a Faith only, as is true and lively that is ac∣tually producing good Fruits or Works, and consequently implying them as a necessary con∣dition</HI> (but no meritorious Cause) <HI>of our Justification.</HI></P>
<P>This then, I say, is the Doctrine which you censure, and are so angry at: But which notwithstanding is indeed the true Doctrine of the Gospel; — and agreeab∣ly, taught by the ancient Fathers, by the <HI>Church of England;</HI> by her Clergy at all Times; and (be not surprized!) the very Doctrine taught by your <HI>Reverence</HI> and Bre∣thren <HI>Methodists,</HI> tho' not without apparent Shuffle and Contradiction, disguised under the Distinction of <HI>before</HI> and <HI>after</HI> Justification.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Doctrine you condemn, is the true Doctrine of the Gospel. — <HI>We are justified by Faith and</HI> not by Works, teacheth St. <HI>Paul;</HI> that is (expoundeth St. <HI>James</HI>) not by <HI>such</HI> a Faith as is <HI>without</HI> Works; for Faith, if <HI>it hath not Works, is dead being
<PB N="80" REF="004588_0080_100DA648C1B3E1F0"/>
alone;</HI> but by a lively operative Faith, pro∣ducing the Fruit of good Works, <HI>by Works is Faith made Perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This also is the Doctrine of all the ancient Fathers. — <HI>We are justified by Faith and not by Works,</HI> taught <HI>Clemens, Ori∣gen, Cyprian, Basil, Chrysostom, Austin,</HI> &amp;c. that is, <Q>not so meant of them,' (Hom. of Salv. Part 2d.) that the said justifying Faith is alone in Man, without true Re∣pentance, Hope, Charity, and the Fear of God at any Time or Season: But this saying that we be justified by Faith only, freely and without Works, is spoken, for <HI>to take away clearly</HI> ALL MERIT <HI>of our Works,</HI> as being unable to deserve our Jus∣tification at God's Hands; — and whol∣ly to ascribe the Merit of our Justification unto Christ only, and his most precious Bloodshedding.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. This same Doctrine also teacheth the Church of <HI>England. We are accounted righ∣teous</HI> (or justified) <HI>before God only for the Merits of our Lord and Saviour</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deser∣vings.</HI> Art. 11. <Q>That is, (saith Hom. of Faith) not by a dead or barren, but a lively and fruitful Faith. — Good living
<PB N="81" REF="004588_0081_100DA64AF43CAA58"/>
cannot be separated from true Faith, which worketh by Love; — and Faith of itself is full of good Works; as soon as a Man believeth he is garnished with them. — And by all the Declarations of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> it is evident, that a true and Christian Faith, is no dead, vain, or un∣fruitful Thing; but a Thing of perfect Virtue, of wonderful Operation, Working and Strength, bringing forth all good Motions, and good Works.</Q> <HI>See Hom.</HI> of <HI>Salvat.</HI> and short Declar. of a true and live∣ly Faith.</P>
<P N="4">4. And as of the Church, so agreeably is this the Doctrine at all Times preached by her Clergy. — <HI>We are justified by Faith on∣ly and not by Works;</HI> — <Q>And yet (saith Bishop <HI>Downam,</HI> Treat. of Justific. P. 15.) that Faith which is alone, severed from all other inward Graces, and outward O∣bedience, doth not justify either alone, or at all; because it is not a true and lively, but a counterfeit and dead Faith.</Q> Ag∣reeably also Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> on the 39th Art. (Art. 11.) <Q>Tho' it be by Faith (saith he) that we are justified, and by Faith only, yet not by such a Faith as hath no Works accompanying it: No, every such
<PB N="82" REF="004588_0082_100DA64D3B71BE30"/>
Faith is a dead Faith; so that Faith with∣out Works is as unable to justify us, as Works without Faith. And yet it is not from our Works that accompany our Faith, but from the Faith that is accom∣panied by our Works, that we are justifi∣ed.</Q> —Thus Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> also (on the same 11th Art.) <Q>A Man is then only justified when he is freed from Wrath, and is at Peace with God. And tho' this is freely offered to us in the Gospel through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> yet it is applied to none, but such as come within those Qua∣lifications set before us in the Gospel. That God pardons Sin and receives us in∣to Favour, only through the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> is so fully expressed in the Gospel, that it is not possible to doubt of it. Nor is it less evident, that it is not offered to us absolutely, and without Conditions and Limitations. These Conditions are <HI>Repentance,</HI> with which <HI>Remission of Sins</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often joined; and <HI>Faith;</HI> but a <HI>Faith that worketh by Love, that purifies the Heart;</HI> and <HI>that keeps the Commandments of God.</HI> Such a Faith as shews itself to be alive by good Works by Acts of Charity, and every Act of Obedience. Such a
<PB N="83" REF="004588_0083_100DA64FE6B74528"/>
<HI>Faith</HI> as this <HI>justifies;</HI> but not as it is a Work or meritorious Action, but as it is the Condition upon which the Mercy of God is offered to us by <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI> — Our Faith and Repentance are not the va∣luable Considerations for which God par∣dons and justifies; that is done merely for the Death of <HI>Christ.</HI> — But still our Faith, which includes our Hope, our Love, our Repentance and Obedience, is the Condition that makes us capable of receiving the Benefit of this Redemption and free Grace.</Q></P>
<P>Agreeably also Bishop <HI>Williams</HI> (Serm. of <HI>Justification by Faith</HI>) — <Q>It is said here, (Rom. v. 1.) <HI>being justified by Faith;</HI> by which we are to understand, not a mere notional Faith, (for that is no other than an Assent to the Truth of what is reveal∣ed) but a Faith in Operation, a Faith ac∣tive and vigorous, and that doth compre∣hend in it, all that Duty and those Gra∣ces, which are else where in Scripture made the Condition of the Gospel Co∣venant, and which gives me a Title to all the Benefits of it, such as Forgiveness of Sin, Adoption and Glorification. And that is a practical Faith, and to which
<PB N="84" REF="004588_0084_100DA65242B18F58"/>
Repentance, Obedience, and Perseverance do belong, as the essential Parts of it.</Q></P>

Finally, This is the very Doctrine taught by your <HI>Reverence</HI> and Brethren <HI>Methodists,</HI> tho' not without Shuffle and Contradiction, disguised under the ground∣less <HI>Distinctions</HI> of before and after <HI>Justifica∣tion,</HI> and 'twixt <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> Thus your <HI>Reverence</HI> (Serm. <HI>What think ye of Christ.</HI> Pag. 16.) <Q>The Faith we preach, is not a lead speculative Faith, <HI>an Assent∣ing to Things credible as credible,</HI> as it is commonly defined; it is not a Faith of the Head only, but a Faith of the Heart. It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the everlasting God, convincing the Sinner of his lost and un∣done Condition by Nature, and continu∣ally exciting them to shew forth that Faith, by abounding in every good Word and Work.</Q> Thus also your Brother <HI>J. Wesley</HI> (Serm. <HI>Salvation by Faith,</HI> Pag. 14.) —<Q>The first usual Objection to this (saith he) is that to preach Salvation or <HI>Justification</HI> by Faith only, is to preach against Holiness and good Works. To which a short Answer might be given; it would be so, if we spake, as some do, of a
<PB N="85" REF="004588_0085_100DA6541BF1AFC0"/>
Faith exclusive of these. But we speak of a Faith which is necessarily inclusive of all good Works, and all Holiness.</Q></P>
<P>Now Sir, this being the Doctrine of Jus∣tification as taught and explained by the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and by you <HI>Methodists;</HI> how comes it to be a false Doctrine in the Mouths of the one, and not of the other? How comes it to be preaching <HI>only the Law</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Justi∣fication by <HI>Works,</HI> and not by <HI>Faith only</HI>) in the <HI>Clergy</HI>'s Mouths; and yet to be preach∣ing the <HI>Gospel</HI> (Justification by <HI>Faith only,</HI> and not by <HI>Works</HI>) in the Mouths of your∣self and Brethren <HI>Methodists?</HI> — Have not the <HI>Clergy</HI> as good a Right as you to preach Justification by a true and lively Faith, a Faith, operating and bringing forth <HI>good Works,</HI> or inclusive of them, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being accused of preaching Justification by Works? Or rather is it not altogether arrogant and wicked Slander in you, thus to accuse them, and on none other Grounds than will equ∣ally support the Charge against your sel∣ves?</P>
<P>But this you'll say, is not a fair and ho∣nest Representation or State of the Matter in Question. For, the Grounds on which you accuse the <HI>Clergy</HI> of preaching <HI>only the
<PB N="86" REF="004588_0086_100DA656D79D2698"/>
Law</HI> or Justification by Works, is not their Preaching, that such good Works as are pleasing to God, are the necessary Fruits or Effects of a justifying Faith; no, but their Preaching, that such good Works as are the Fruits of a justifying Faith, are <HI>a necessary Condition of Justification;</HI> and consequently must <HI>not only follow after Justification,</HI> but <HI>go before it also;</HI> contrary to sound Doctrine, and the 2th <HI>Article of the Church.</HI> To which I answer,</P>
<P>That is a miserable Distinction; a poor Jingle of Words, not serving to instruct, but to intangle and amuse the Minds of the weak and unwary Populace. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Is not the Word <HI>Condition,</HI> used in va∣rious Senses? And can good Works be called <HI>a Condition of Justification,</HI> in no o∣ther Sense, than that of <HI>a meritorious Cause?</HI> See what <HI>a Wrangler, in your own Way</HI> has said on this Point, (<HI>Edwards of New Eng∣land; Disc. of Justification, p.</HI> 8. prefixed to his <HI>Narative of surprizing Conversions &amp;c. The Word</HI> (says he) <HI>seems ambiguous in com∣mon Use and also as used in Divinity. In one Sense</HI> Christ alone <HI>performs the Condition of our Justification and Salvation; in another Sense, Faith is the Condition of Justification;
<PB N="87" REF="004588_0087_100DA658E6DCBB00"/>
in another Sense, other Qualifications and Acts, are Conditions of Salvation and Justification too.</HI> And again, <HI>As the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion <HI>is very often understood in the common Use of Language,</HI> Faith <HI>is not the only Thing in us, that is the Condition of Justification. For by the Word</HI> Condition, <HI>as perhaps most common∣ly used, we mean any Thing that may have Place in a conditional Proposition, and as such is truly connected with the Consequent, especi∣ally if the Proposition holds both in the affir∣mative and Negative, as the</HI> Condition <HI>is ei∣ther affirmed or denied: And in this Sense,</HI> Faith <HI>is not the only Condition of Salvation or Justification; for there are many Things that accompany and flow from Faith, that are Things with which Justification shall be, and without which it shall not be; and therefore are found to be put in Scripture, in conditional Propositions with Justification and Salvation, in many Places; such are</HI> Love to God, <HI>and</HI> Love to our Brethren, Forgiving Men their Trespasses, <HI>and many other good Qualifications and Acts.</HI> Now if in the Judgment of this Wri∣ter, of your own Cast, good Works may be and are usually called Conditions of Justifi∣cation, in another Sense than that of <HI>meri∣torious Causes;</HI> how dare you, in your
<PB N="88" REF="004588_0088_100DA65B1F5E3E30"/>
Mobb Harangues, attempt to fix that Sense of the Word upon the Clergy in which they use it not, but which they expressly disclaim? And is not your doing it, a ren∣dring your self guilty of wilful Slander?</P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>Faith</HI> is, in some Sense, <HI>a Condi∣tion</HI> of Justification, is generally admitted by Writers of your own Cast, and that both <HI>Faith and good Works are Conditions of Salvation,</HI> is, I think, denied by none. The Distinct on 'twixt <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Salva∣tion,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Respect to good Works, as la∣bour'd by Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Old England (Doctrine of Faith and Justific. &amp;c.)</HI> is too much Nonsense to be defended, and which a beloved Brother seems (tho' with usual self Contradiction) to have rejected. See <HI>J. Wesley</HI>'s Serm. (<HI>Salvation by Faith, p.</HI> 9. <HI>Whatever else it</HI> (Salvation by Faith) <HI>im∣plies▪ it is a present Salvation, something at∣tainable yea actually atained on Earth by those who are partakers of this Faith. For thus saith the Apostle, not ye shall be (tho' that also be true) but,</HI> ye are saved through Faith. Now what other can this present Salvation by Faith be▪ than a State of Par∣don and Acceptance with God, that is, a State of Justification? And therefore, if a
<PB N="89" REF="004588_0089_100DA65EAAC975F0"/>
State of Justification be a present Salvation, or rather a present State of Salvation, the asserting of good Works a necessary Condi∣tion of Salvation, but not of Justification, is a Contradiction. And agreeably the lear∣ned Dr. <HI>Jackson, (Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 739. of his Works.) <HI>That good Works (saith he) are more necessary to Salvation than to Justifica∣tion, or that they are less necessary before Ju∣stification, than after it, implies a Contradiction in the Terms well expressed and equally com∣pared. And Man in that he is justified, is the immediate Heir of Salvation, at the least ac∣quitted from the Sentence of Death. Now if we affirm, that</HI> good Works <HI>are more neces∣sary after he is justified, than before, we should in Congruity grant, that Works win Heaven, and Faith only delivers from Hell: Or grant∣ing Justification to be the Passage from Death to eternal Life, the Addition of such Works subsequent, as were not precedent, could be serviceable only to supererogate some Excess of Glory; for tho' we stood still at the same Point where Justification found us, we should be in∣fallible Heirs of Glory. Or if Faith without Works obtain Justification, having justified us, shall it not much more without them lay sure hold on Salvation, and all the Degrees of Joy
<PB N="90" REF="004588_0090_100DA6608204E438"/>
that accompany it? Suppose a Man should die in the very Instant wherein he is justified; none would Doubt either of his Absolution or Salva∣tion. Is he then saved with Works, or with∣out them? If without them, then our Savi∣our's Rule doth fail us, (Mat.</HI> v. 20. Except your Righteousness exceed, <HI>&amp;c.) For this Man enters into the Kingdom of Heaven with∣out more strict Observance of the Command∣ments than the Scribes and Pharisees used: If with them, then their Presence is necessary to Justification, and in Order of Nature before it, because necessary e'er he can be capable of Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven; as the Performance of every Condition is in Nature precedent to the Accomplishment of what is not promised without it.</HI></P>
<P>Nor indeed is the admitting of Faith a <HI>Condition of Justification,</HI> in any Sense, and yet denying it of the <HI>necessary Fruits or Ef∣fects of Faith</HI> less absurd or contradictory.</P>
<P>This you know is the main Point in Di∣stress with you, and which drove the above cited <HI>Dr. Edwards</HI> not only on the Senseless Distinction of <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> but moreover of the silly Subterfuges of scrupling to call Faith <HI>a Condition,</HI> and de∣nying its <HI>going before Justification. Because</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="004588_0091_100DA663E81F9758"/>
(saith he <HI>Doct. of Faith and Justific. p.</HI> 318.) <HI>Faith is not a</HI> Condition <HI>in the strict Sense, I chuse to lay that way of speaking aside, and to express my Thoughts thus; the Gospel requires of those that are justified, that they believe in Christ.</HI> Curiously thought and expressed too! <HI>The Gospel requires of those that are justified, that they believe in Christ:</HI> But does it not require of those who are not justified, that they believe in Christ al∣so? Rare Champion of Grace! Such Ways of Expression must do wonderful Feats, and enlighten every Mind in the Kingdom. But this is not all. <HI>It is an idle Contest</HI> (saith he) <HI>and yet hath troubled some Heads, which of these (Faith or Justification) is first in Time For I apprehend that they are both together: therefore no Man can tell which is precedent, and which Subsequent.</HI> Here is a Matter decided for you; Who dares any longer contest it? <HI>I apprehend, &amp;c.</HI> That this is an idle Contest, and owing only to such Heads as his own will be easily granted: But his <HI>I apprehend, &amp;c.</HI> will be deemed a very sorry Decision. — 99 of 100 will apprehend, <HI>that his</HI> Apprehension <HI>of the Matter is absurd, and repugnant to the very Order of Thought or Apprehension in
<PB N="92" REF="004588_0092_100D832FE64A46D0"/>
all Cases whatsoever.</HI> And you are defied to instance the Case, in which the <HI>Condition, Means or Instrument of any Thing,</HI> must not in the Order of Thought or Apprehension be conceived to exist before the Thing; or that a Workman's Tools must not be con∣ceived to exist previous to the Work done by them. But notwithstanding this Au∣thor's Apprehension of this Matter, in the Passage above cited, <HI>viz. That Faith and Ju∣stification are so instantaneous, as no Man can tell which is precedent and which subsequent;</HI> Yet how vastly different do we find his Ap∣prehension of it, in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the same Performance, <HI>p.</HI> 15. The Passage is curious, and runs thus. <HI>So as to</HI> Justification by Faith, <HI>it may be said that Faith goes before Justification, and yet we are sure it comes af∣ter▪ The former is true, because Pardon or Justification is propounded and promised as a Consequence and Reward of Faith. The lat∣ter is also true; for we must not believe that we are forgiven, before God hath forgiven us. We must see our Pardon, and then exert our Faith. Thus both are true in different Re∣spects. On one Account Faith Precedes Justi∣fication; on the other it follows it. This puts an End to the Dispute, and lays all the Qua∣rels
<PB N="93" REF="004588_0093_100DA6671364B0F0"/>
in the Dust.</HI> Whoever can write such a <HI>Treatise,</HI> and such a Passage in the <HI>Preface</HI> to it, had need to be at an End of all Di∣spute or Controversy. In the <HI>Treatise</HI> no Man can tell <HI>of Faith and Justification which is precedent and which is consequent.</HI> In the <HI>Preface</HI> to it, <HI>It may be said that Faith goes before Justification, and we sure also it comes after.</HI> So that to make all plain, <HI>Faith</HI> in one Respect, <HI>goes before</HI> Justification; in an∣other <HI>comes after it;</HI> and yet in general <HI>they are so instantaneous,</HI> that no Man can tell <HI>which goes before,</HI> or <HI>which comes after.</HI> This is a Doctrine of Grace! Sanctified Logick out of all Question! That Faith goes be∣fore Justification is easily admitted, and for the Reason assigned, <HI>viz. Because Pardon or Justification</HI> (which by the bye are not al∣lowed to be synonimous Terms in the Treatise) <HI>is propounded and promised as a Consequence or Reward of Faith:</HI> But how comes it also to <HI>follow after?</HI> Why <HI>because we must not believe that we are forgiven, be∣fore God hath forgiven us. We must see our Pardon, and then exert our Faith.</HI> Did ever a more arrant Piece of Nonse drop from the Pen of any Writer! As if Faith or Belief in <HI>Christ</HI> as the true <HI>Mesiah,</HI> operat∣ing
<PB N="94" REF="004588_0094_100DA6693830DB70"/>
by Love, by which we are justified: And the Faith or Belief that God has actu∣ally justified us by that Faith, were the Faith or Belief of the same Thing in diffe∣rent Respects, and not of different and di∣stinct Things! <HI>We must see our Pardon, &amp;c. seeing,</HI> says the Proverb, is <HI>believing.</HI> But how can we see it? By the Eye of Faith. Well then, in plain Language, we must first <HI>see</HI> our Pardon <HI>by the Eye of Faith,</HI> and then <HI>exert our Faith.</HI> Such Logick must surely <HI>put an End to the Dispute and lay all the Quarrel in the Dust.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As to the 12th Article of the Church it is obvious, that by the Words, <HI>and follow after Justification,</HI> the <HI>Article</HI> means not to exclude good Works going <HI>before</HI> Justifica∣tion, from being acceptable or pleasing to God, provided they are the Fruits of Faith, because it has no negative Words to exclude them. And not only so, but which is still confirmed, by the next following Article, intitled, <HI>of Works before Justification. Works</HI> (saith this Article) <HI>done before the Grace of</HI> Christ <HI>and the Inspiration of his Spirit are not pleasant to God:</HI> Why so? <HI>Forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in</HI> Jesus Christ. Here it is plain, that by <HI>Works before Justification,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="004588_0095_100DA66ACC8F64A0"/>
the Article meaneth Works that are <HI>so</HI> be∣fore it as to be before the Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> and consequently Faith in him; that is Works in a State of mere <HI>Heathenism</HI> or <HI>In∣fidelity.</HI> And therefore according to the Max∣im, <HI>Exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis,</HI> the Article confirmeth, that Works which are not <HI>so</HI> before Justification as to be before the Grace of <HI>Christ</HI> and Faith in him, but after these and springing from them, are pleasing to God, tho' before Justification.</P>
<P>But do not both Articles rather seem to suppose that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Justification</HI> are co∣existant; or that 'twixt the first Act of a justifying Faith, and that of Justification, there intervenes no Space for good Works to be exerted in? I answer, that however some few have chose to understand them in this Sense, and in which they might re∣main undisturbed, if they would not di∣sturb, insult and abuse their Neighbours, for differing from them in Judgment; yet more generally 'tis conceived, to be disho∣nouring the Articles, to understand them as regarding so silly and speculative a Notion, which never has, nor ever can be proved, to have the least Foundation either in Scripture, or common Reason; or which
<PB N="96" REF="004588_0096_100DA66D67D25600"/>
in it self, whether held or rejected, is not of the least moment or importance so long as the <HI>Foundation</HI> is held sure, viz. <HI>that we are justified by a true and</HI> lively <HI>Faith, bringing forth the Fruit of good Works; but that neither this Faith nor its Fruit of good Works, are in any Sense,</HI> meritorious Causes <HI>of either our</HI> Justification <HI>or</HI> Salva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion <HI>(to admit the Distinction) but</HI> Conditions <HI>or</HI> Means <HI>only.</HI> Let one single plain Text of Scripture, or one single conclusive Argu∣ment in Reason, be produced in Support of this <HI>speculative Notion,</HI> that the first <HI>mere Act</HI> of Faith and that of Justification▪ are <HI>co-existent;</HI> no one can be under any Temp∣tation to reject it: For sure the less we are required to do in the Work of our <HI>Salvation,</HI> so much the happier for us, who are able to do so little, and so unwilling to do any Thing at all. Or let it be shown, what Moment or Importance the holding or rejecting this Notion is of, so long as this <HI>Foundation</HI> is held sure.</P>
<P>But without holding this Notion (as you teach and deceive the People) the <HI>Foundation</HI> is not, and cannot be held: For that the contrary Notion, say you, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="004588_0097_100DA6706AC449B8"/>
that Faith and its necessary Fruits pre-exist, and go before Justification as necessary Conditions of it, is destroying the Founda∣tion and holding Justification <HI>by Works</HI> as a <HI>meritorious Cause.</HI> This is your poisoned Insinuation; false, and insiduous! Have you proved (Sir) or dare you attempt to prove this Insinuation? No you dare not attempt it; not only because you have no Talent at proving any Thing, but chiefly because you are <HI>conscious,</HI> that such Proof must equally conclude against yourself and Brethren <HI>Methodists,</HI> in the Case of <HI>Salva∣tion,</HI> as against those you abuse in that of <HI>Justification.</HI> Do not you and your Bre∣thren hold that Faith and good Works are necessary Conditions of <HI>Salvation?</HI> Well; upstarts a hair-brained <HI>Solifidian,</HI> and runs about a Mouthing; The <HI>Methodists</HI> preach up Salvation <HI>by Works as meritorious Causes:</HI> Will you think it a fair Charge against you? Or not rather disclaim it as false and injurious? Produce (Sir) but one Ar∣gument, either from Scripture or Reason, to prove, that the holding Faith and good Works necessary <HI>Conditions</HI> of Justification, is holding Justification by Works, as <HI>meri∣torious Causes;</HI> that will not equally con∣clude
<PB N="98" REF="004588_0098_100DA6722CBB2430"/>
in the Mouth of this <HI>Solifidian,</HI> that your holding Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th and good Works ne∣cessary <HI>Conditions</HI> of Salvation, is holding Salvation by Works, as <HI>meritorious Causes:</HI> Produce, I say, but one single Argument that will not equally conclude in the <HI>one</HI> Case as the <HI>other,</HI> and I'll become your Pro∣selyte the next Moment.</P>
<P>But if this be impossible for you to do, as sure it is, then lay your Hand on your Mouth! Nay rather open it wide, and re∣call the Slander you have scatter'd far and wide around you; and undo the Mischief you have already done. You boast indeed, in your <HI>Journals,</HI> that you have kindled a <HI>Fire</HI> which all the <HI>Devils</HI> in Hell shall not be able to exinguish! Alas (Sir) the <HI>Fire</HI> you have kindled is that of Slander and Defamation. A <HI>Fire!</HI> which no <HI>Devil</HI> in Hell, no nor <HI>Jesuit</HI> nor <HI>Deisi</HI> on Earth, will ever go about to extinguish; but fagot and foment it with all their Might, as too ef∣fectually serving their Interests or Turn. You and your Brethren cry out Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cution! 'Tis true▪ Persecution there is in the Case; but are not you the Persecutors?

But still Persecution you cry out; for want of it you mean For ours is no Persecuting Country for Religion; every Man may enjoy his own Way in Peace and Safety; but as you may regard being persecuted as something essen∣tial to a true Christian, and necessary to keep up the Spirit of Christianity, you seem to be in Quest or Pursuit of it, please only to step into a Neighbouring Country, <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> and you'll bid fair, I dare say, to find it. Or if this be too much, only pursue your first Plan, you amused the World with, <HI>viz.</HI> the Conversion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> you'll either meet with it or some∣thing equivalent to it. But why, poor Gentleman are you thus to be bantered? Are you not really persecuted? Are you not cast out of the Synagogues; excluded the <HI>Church of England</HI> Pulpits; and treated as a Disciple of <HI>Fox</HI> or <HI>Muggleton?</HI> And is not all this Persecution? But for what Cause are you thus treated? Why, only for the trifling Cause of accusing the Cler∣gy, openly and avowedly accusing them in

general, for Apostates from Christianity, and ignorant of it as <HI>Mahomet;</HI> for blind Guides, false Teachers, and leading the Peo∣ple to the Gates of Hell. And in all this <HI>you speak the Truth in Christ, and lie not.</HI> And are not the Clergy of a strange persecuting Spirit, to deny such Men their Pulpits, to insult, traduce and defame them in! But why will you desire our Pulpits, or pre∣sume to approach the Altars at which we minister? Is it not Persecution in you to attempt the one or the other? Is it not wholy absurd and inconsistent in you to pretend holding Communion with us, if you believe a Word of the Characters you assure us to be true? Will you hold Com∣munion with the <HI>Mufti</HI> or with the <HI>Pope,</HI> with the <HI>Turkish</HI> or the <HI>Romish</HI> Clergy? And why any more with us, whom you are pleased to set forth to the Multitude in such odious Colours? Sure you ought to get you up from among us, lest you be con∣sumed in our Iniquities!</P>
<P>But I have done. I thought indeed to have added some other Queries relating to your Conduct, but since this Letter has been under my Pen, I have seen them put

<P>In the Preface to the Hymns and sacred Poems lately published at <HI>London, by</HI> Mr. <HI>John W-sl-y</HI> and his Brother, <HI>p.</HI> v. we are told, that <HI>"even the</HI> Condition <HI>of our Ac∣ceptance with</HI> God, <HI>is not our Holiness either of Heart or Life, but Faith alone; Faith</HI> con∣tradistinguished <HI>from Holiness, as well as from good Works."</HI> And then immediately follow these Words, "<HI>Other Foundation therefore can no Man lay, without being an Adversary to</HI> Christ <HI>and his Gospel, than Faith alone, Faith, tho' necessarily producing both, yet</HI> not including either good Works or Ho∣liness."</P>

a Word;</HI> it is neither for your Sake not my own, that I trouble you with this <HI>Fourth</HI> Letter, but for such Reasons as may in due Time be assigned.</P>
<P>I have now before me an <HI>anonymous</HI> Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>The Case between Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>and Dr.</HI> Stebbing <HI>stated,</HI> &amp;c. containing, or designed to contain, the <HI>en∣tire System</HI> of the <HI>Methodist</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Re∣generation.</HI> Whether you approve of all and every Thing it contains, I presume not to know; but to me it appears as elaborate a Peace of <HI>dogmatical</HI> Theology, as any pro∣duc'd in the <HI>Oliverian</HI> Age, and calculated not to edify, but to puzzle and amuse the Minds of the Populace, or common Readers.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Foundation</HI> of this goodly Structure, either the Author must beg the Question, of the <HI>Propagation of Souls,</HI> or his <HI>Propositions</HI> are mere Amusements.</P>

The Author dare not say they can; and if they cannot, then how could <HI>Adam</HI> trans∣mit the <HI>Endowments</HI> and Qualities of <HI>Know∣ledge, Innocence, Righteousness and Holiness</HI> to the <HI>Souls</HI> of his Posterity, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> without transmitting the Substance also?</P>
<P>Again, either the <HI>Author</HI> must take the same Principle for granted, or to what End or Purpose <HI>Prop.</HI> vii and its Comment?</P>
<P>If his Meaning, indeed be, that as every animal Creature, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> begets its like; the Toad, the Viper, the Tyger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> begets Toads, Vipers, Tygers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So the animal Part or Bodies of our first Parents being degenerate, corrupt and mortal, the animal Part or Bodies of their Posterity, which alone they could beget, must therefore, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> be degenerate, corrupt and mortal also: If this, I say, be his Meaning, who will ever dispute the Truth of the Proposition? Nay▪

who will not moreover readily grant, that <HI>the corruptible Body presseth down the Soul,</HI> and often too easily besets and draws it off, from heavenly and spiritual to earthly and carnal Things? But then, alas! what o∣ther End or Purpose will all this be of, to the Author's Scheme of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> than to destroy it? This Scheme absolutely re∣quires the positive <HI>innate</HI> Degeneracy and Corruption of the Soul for its Foundation. And as the <HI>Author</HI> must plainly see, that this Degeneracy &amp; Corruption transmitted from <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>the Laws of Generation,</HI> must nece∣sarily suppose the <HI>Propagation of Souls;</HI> it is evident to me, that rather than touch this Point, or expressly beg the Question, he chose to lay its Foundation in Darkness, and to hide its Weakness under general and am∣biguous Phrases, and especially the Word <HI>Nature;</HI> to the no small Puzzle and Per∣plexity of common Readers.</P>
<P>It is true, Mention is once made of a Co∣venant <HI>Adam</HI> was under, his being <HI>the Re∣presentative Head,</HI> and of the <HI>Imputation of his Sin;</HI> but as these, the Author owns, <HI>lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of his Way,</HI> that is, answered not to his Corruption Scheme, they are once, I say, as 'twere, compell'd to make a sort of ex∣centrick

Appearance, and we hear no more of them.</P>
<P>But to have done with this Head: E∣very Body can easily conceive, as <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>Root,</HI> from which sprang the animal Part or Bodies of his Children, that the animal Patt or Bodies of his Children must therefore, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> partake of the Nature and Qualities of that <HI>Root,</HI> whether they were good or evil; but how their Souls, if they sprung <HI>not from that Root,</HI> must partake of its Nature and Qua∣lities, by <HI>any Laws of Generation,</HI> I believe a <HI>Methodist</HI> only can conceive.</P>
<P>The Populace have been strangely amus∣ed of late with the <HI>Doctrine of Regeneration,</HI> as a sudden, instantaneous Work (Act) of <HI>the Holy Spirit,</HI> and in which the Subjects are <HI>entirely passive.</HI> But this <HI>Author,</HI> tho' he still <HI>dogmatically</HI> insists on some <HI>certain cri∣tical Act</HI> in the Case, yet has a whole Chap. (4th) concerning the <HI>Manner, Means and Steps,</HI> by which this Work is wrought by the Spirit of God in the Hearts of his Peo∣ple. I'm afraid that in this <HI>Chap.</HI> he has departed from <HI>the ancient Testimony,</HI> and ad∣vanced several Things, which natural Men may take <HI>for Inconsistences and Contradictions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="004588_0107_100DA68247123DE0"/><HI>Pag.</HI> 52, 53. I find the following remark∣able Passages. <HI>In all his Ways towards us, and especially in the Work of Regeneration and Con∣version, God deals with us as reasonable Crea∣tures, however weak degenerate, or corrupt; and always acts in a Way agreeable to our ra∣tional Powers; this the Precepts, Admonitions, Promises, Councils and Invitations, &amp;c. of the Word do clearly demonstrate.</HI></P>
<P>How from the Bottom of my Heart do I wish, that this honest and instructive Pas∣sage stood in <HI>Golden Capitals,</HI> at the Head of every Page, throughout the whole Perfor∣mance; with <HI>[Regeneration is the whole and sole Work of God, in which we are entirely passive]</HI> incerted between Hooks in the very Center of it; to expose the Contradiction in direct View, and guard the Judgment of the unwary Reader! The Author goes on, <Q>These (that is, <HI>Precepts, Admonitions, Promises, &amp;c.</HI> of the Word all suppose that we are either capable of doing something or other in a Way of Duty; or, at least, of being <HI>excited, disposed</HI> and <HI>enabled</HI> to hear, understand, and do what is required. Tho' we have lost our In∣nocence, Righteousness and Holiness, we have not lost our Faculties and Powers.

We are not Stocks and Stones, and mere Machines; but, intelligent Agents: And tho' we cannot, in our natural State, know the Things of the Spirit of God, as we should, and as we must, if we would be saved; yet many Things we still know of our Maker, and his Will; yea, and many Things we can also do. In our Renovation, God restores what we have lost, but does it by working upon what remains. He calls and excites us, to the exercise of our rational Faculties, and at the same Time cures the Disorders of them, and frames them in some Measure, for what he enjoins. He commands us, for Example, to hear and read his Word, with Reverence and Seriousness; and in our obeying, as we can, and hearing it with that Reverence, we would do any Thing of Moment, he makes us to under∣stand it. He commands us to mix Faith with our Hearing; and in our receiving it, with that Faith which we may have, he confirms our Assent to it. He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when we humble our selves under a deep Sense of our utter Inability, and heartily pray for Almigh∣ty

quickning Grace, he by the Power of his Spirit, working with the Word, tho∣roughly awakens us, and raises us from the Dead. He commands Sinners to cease to do Evil; and in their sincere Care to compply, he many Ways assists them, And, to learn to do well; and in their setting about this Work, in earnest, he by the Word both disposes them farther, and enables them also.</Q> Now if all this be <HI>Methodism,</HI> I subscribe to it Heart and Hand; only with this Difference from the <HI>Author,</HI> that I must insist on <HI>these,</HI> not as <HI>previous Dispositions only,</HI> to the Work of <HI>Regeneration;</HI> but in Reality the Work ado∣ing, and part of it actually done. For ac∣cording to his own Description of <HI>Regene∣ration,</HI> it consists, <Q>In the <HI>checking, weak∣ning,</HI> and <HI>in part subduing</HI> our Natural De∣pravity and Corruption; and <HI>the restoring</HI> in some Measure, that <HI>Image of God,</HI> which <HI>Adam</HI> lost by his Fall.</Q> But if the Work of Regeneration consists in these, then I must insist, that it is not a <HI>sole, critical or instantaneous,</HI> but a <HI>gradual co-operating</HI> Work of the <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> commencing at <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> and gradually advancing throughout the whole course of Christian Life; including
<PB N="110" REF="004588_0110_100DA68A4B369EE8"/>
all the Steps or Degrees of Faith, Repen∣tance, renewed Dispositions of the Mind, and Habits of Obedience, 'till we arive at <HI>the Measure of the Stature of the Fulness of Christ;</HI> that is, to such a Degree of Chri∣stian Perfection, as is attainable here; that which is absolute, being only atainable at the Resurrection hereafter. In a Word, I must insist, that according to the <HI>Scriptures, the whole Oeconomy of Grace</HI> is, an <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of CO-OPERATION, where the Subject is capable; and therefore, that the above cited Particulars are not only preparative, or previous Dispositions to Regeneration; but the Work actually adoing, and Part of it actually done.</P>
<P>This, in the Judgment of the Christian Church in all Ages, is the plain Doctrine of the Scripture, and therefore the Passage next following, contains <HI>a Contradiction</HI> to the above cited Passage, and a manifestly false Assertion, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>We are never com∣manded to <HI>regenerate our selves,</HI> or <HI>beget our selves again;</HI> that is God's Work, <HI>his wholly and solely.</HI></Q> But are we indeed ne∣ver commanded <HI>to regenerate or beget our selves again;</HI> tho' not in the very Words, (for the Word <HI>Regenerate</HI> occurs not once

in the whole <HI>English</HI> Bible) yet not in this <HI>Author's</HI> own Sense or Meaning of them? Are we never commanded <HI>to check, weaken, or in part subdue our natural Depravity and Corruption, and to improve our selves in Know∣ledge, Righteousness and Holiness?</HI> Or are not these the Purport of all <HI>the Divine Com∣mands?</HI> Are we never commanded, <HI>to purge out the old Leaven, that we may be a new Lump? To put off the Old Man, and to put on the New? To cracify the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts? To mortify our Mem∣bers which are upon the Earth?</HI> Are we ne∣ver commanded to <HI>cleanse our selves from all Filthiness both of the Flesh and Spirit, per∣fecting Holiness in the Fear of God? To cleanse our Hands and purify our Hearts? &amp;c.</HI> And can these, or any like Commands, be understood to import any more, than our doing such Part of these Things as we are a∣ble, or that the main or principal part is not the Work of the Holy Spirit, without whose <HI>co-operating</HI> Aids and Graces, we can do nothing? Nay, but says the <HI>Author,</HI> this (Regeneration) is <HI>God's Work,</HI> his whol∣ly and solely; and in which we are <HI>entirely passive.</HI> Are these the Words of him who just before had said, <HI>That in all his Ways,
<PB N="112" REF="004588_0112_100E7C2C29C38B28"/>
and especially the Work of Regeneration, God deals with us as reasonable Creatures, not as with Stocks or Stones, or mere Machines, but intelligent Beings?</HI> And a few Lines after says, <HI>That in the whole Work of Grace, God treats us as reasonable Creatures, and in a Way congruous to our rational Powers?</HI> A∣way with such confused and contradictory Gibberish.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Author's</HI> Eyes being fitted only for <HI>Methodist</HI> Light, he is over with it a∣gain, <HI>pag.</HI> 60, 61. <HI>Taking it for granted, that the Holy Spirit is the Almighty Worker of our Regeneration, in which we are entirely passive; we may observe, that ordinarily there are certain Works which are previous preparative, and some Way dispose to it. — Several Things are required of us in a Way of Duty; which all Men may in some Measure comply with, if not by their own natural Abilities, yet through the Assistance of that common Grace, which is in some Degree, given to all the Hearers of the Gospel,</HI> viz. <HI>That we seriously read▪ and carefully attend, to all the Dispensations of the Word; that we frequently think of our Ways▪ consider our State and Frame, and be much in Prayer for the holy Spirit to enlighten, renew and sanctify

us, &amp;c. Nor has any Man any Reason to expect any such invaluable Blessing, who is either utter negligent of, or only superficial in the Perfor∣mance of them. Commonly also in the serious Attention of the Soul, to these Duties, the Ho∣ly Ghost much enlightens the Mind, awakens the Conscience, convinces of Sin, fills with Grief, and Shame, and Fear, excites to Con∣fession, Prayer and Humiliation, and frequent∣ly works strongly upon, and produceth a migh∣ty Change, not only in the outward Life, but inward Affections.</HI> Now if Regeneration consists in <HI>checking, weakning, and in part subduing our natural Depravity and Corrup∣tion, &amp;c.</HI> must not this Author allow the above Particulars, especially <HI>the mighty Change,</HI> both of the outward Life and in∣ward Affections, to be not only a previous disposing to, but the real Work of <HI>Regenera∣tion</HI> a doing, and part of it actually done? But no such Thing. <HI>Tho none of these</HI> (in∣sists he) <HI>nor all of them together be Regene∣ration, yea tho' all of them may be wrought, and that in a high Degree, in those who are never born of the Spirit, &amp;c.</HI> Is it not plain, that he here shifts the <HI>Idea</HI> of the Word <HI>Re∣generation,</HI> and instead of meaning by it the gradual and Progressive Work <HI>of checking,
<PB N="114" REF="004588_0114_100DA690A443AD18"/>
weakening, subduing, &amp;c.</HI> he annexes it to the <HI>Idea</HI> of an immediate <HI>critical Act;</HI> or the natural Depravity or Corruption <HI>actu∣ally</HI> checked, weakened and subdued, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The same which other Christian Writers or Divines call <HI>the highest Degree of Christian Perfection,</HI> which thro' a <HI>Growth in Grace,</HI> is attainable here, if not that, which none shall attain to, till the Resurrection hereafter.</P>
<P>But above all (Sir) what I chiefly design to observe to you is, that either this <HI>Au∣thor</HI> must be in a very great Error, or your self; either his Doctrine must be false, or your own.</P>
<P>This <HI>Author</HI> Asserts, <HI>That several Things are required of us in a Way of Duty, which all Men may in some Measure comply with, if not by their own natural Abilities, yet thro' the Assistance of that common Grace gi∣ven to all the Hearers of the Gospel</HI> viz. <HI>that we seriously read and attend to all the Dispen∣sations of the Word, frequently think of our Ways, consider our State, and be much in Prayer, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now if according to this <HI>Author,</HI> these Works or Duties, <HI>viz.</HI> serious reading, care∣ful Attention to all the Dispensations of the Word, frequent Meditation, and diligent
<PB N="115" REF="004588_0115_100DA692B7C6ABD8"/>
Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if all these Works or Duties (and which thro' common Grace given to all Gospel Hearers we are able to perform) be required of us as Means naturally dispo∣sing to the Work of Regeneration, and without which no one has Reason to expect that Blessing; then of necessary Consequence they must be required to <HI>Justification</HI> also, which in the Order of Nature, according to this <HI>Author,</HI> cannot precede <HI>Regeneration,</HI> but follow after it; but if these Works or Duties be required to our <HI>Justification,</HI> then what becomes of your remarkable <HI>Antino∣mian</HI> Chalenge, <HI>Who dares assert that we are not justified in the Sight of God, merely by an Act of Faith in</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>without any Re∣gard to Works, past, present, or to come? (Jour. cont. P.</HI> 108. <HI>Edit. Phil.</HI>)</P>
<P>Again, these Works or Duties which God thus requires the Performance of, as Means materially, disposing for <HI>Regenera∣tion,</HI> when through common Grace per∣formed, are they acceptable to God or not? If you say they are not, you say, that the Performance of God's own Commands are not acceptable to him: If you say they are, you contradict your own express Doc∣trine, (Serm. <HI>What think ye of Christ,</HI> P. 18.)

<P>TOUCHING your two Letters, which you have caused to be published in this Place, I am in no doubt what <HI>Spirit</HI> you were when you wroute them. Had you observed common Decency or good Man∣ners in them, you had then been only an Object of common Pity; but your contra∣ry Behaviour, exposes you to the utmost Scorn and Contempt of every Reader. <HI>You

know not,</HI> you say, <HI>how to give flattering Titles in the cause of God;</HI> but you know how, <HI>pretending</HI> the Cause of God, to bring railing Accusations (which an <HI>Arch∣angel</HI> durst not do against the <HI>Devil</HI>) to support some <HI>Crotchets</HI> you have got in your own Brains; how to insult and abuse the Memory and Writings of two of the most sound, Pious and learned Authors that ever adorned the <HI>English</HI> Church or Nation: And how to call God's Truth to witness the Falshood of the Gospel be∣ing a Covenant! You know how to do all this, and to dispence it to the Populace in a Vehicle of cant Terms, without Sense or Meaning. And if this be the Spirit of Methodism, <HI>my Soul come thou not into their Secrets.</HI></P>
<P>But have you indeed <HI>vindicated</HI> your Assertion that <HI>the Archbishop</HI> Tillotson <HI>knew no more of Christianity than</HI> Mahomet? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay how have you done it? Why in a very suitable Manner; by advancing two other Assertions, equally <HI>false</HI> and <HI>slanderous,</HI> and equally wanting a <HI>Vindication,</HI> viz. That the Archbishop <HI>knew of no other than a bare Historical Faith;</HI> and that, <HI>as to the Method of our Acceptance with God thro'</HI>

Jesus Christ, <HI>and our Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith alone, he was as ignorant as</HI> Mahomet.</P>
<P>Now (Sir) have you proved, or attemp∣ted to prove that the Archbishop <HI>knew of no more than a bare Historical Faith?</HI> No: <HI>Every Spiritual Man,</HI> you say, <HI>that reads his discourses may see it.</HI> Did you take this on trust from your honour'd Friend J. W? If you did, you must not lose your Reward. If you grounded it on your <HI>own Knowledge</HI> of those Discourses; how came this Passage of them in Par∣ticular, besides many others, not to con∣found you! Vol. II. Fol. Serm. 25. <HI>But then this Faith must not be a bare assent and persuasion of the Truth of the</HI> Gospel, <HI>but such an effectual Belief as expresseth itself in suitable Acts of Obedience and</HI> Ho∣liness, <HI>such as the Apostle here calls</HI> a Faith which worketh by Love; <HI>a Faith that is</HI> inspir'd <HI>and</HI> acted <HI>or rather</HI> consummate &amp; made perfect by Charity, <HI>(for so the Word doth often signify) and then this Phrase will be just of the same Importance with that of</HI> St. James, by Works is Faith made perfect. REMEMBER <HI>(Sir)</HI> this Passage must look you full in the Face at the great Day.</P>
<P>Have you prov'd for certain that the
<PB N="119" REF="004588_0119_100DA69C394197C0"/>
Archbishop <HI>knew no more of our Acceptance with God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>than</HI> Mahomet? Unfor∣tunately then it turns out, that you have proved the same of yourself also. The naughty Passage by which you have prov'd this of the Archbishop you have <HI>interpo∣lated:</HI> Restored with the <HI>Interpolation</HI> 'twixt Hooks, it runs thus.</P>
<P><Q>You see then what it is that must re∣commend us to the Favour of God; the real Renovation of our Hearts and Lives, after the Image of him that created us. <HI>[This must be repaired in us]</HI> before we can be restored to the Grace and Fa∣vour of God, or to be capable of the Re∣ward of Eternal Life. And what could God have done more reasonable, than to make these very Things the Terms of our Salvation, which are the necessary Causes and Means of it? How could he have dealt more mercifully and kindly with us, than to appoint that to be the Condition of our Happiness, which is the only Qualification that can make us capable of it?</Q></P>
<P>Now (Sir) if this Passage proves, that the Archb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop knew no more of the <HI>Method of our Acceptance,</HI> &amp;c. then what
<PB N="120" REF="004588_0120_100DA69FEA823B90"/>
must these following Passages of yours, prove of you.</P>
<P><HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Sermon on Regeneration, P. 14, 17. <HI>The Apostle declares it to be the irre∣vocable Decree of the Almighty,</HI> that whith∣out Holiness, <HI>i. e. without being made pure by</HI> Regeneration, <HI>and having the</HI> Image <HI>of God thereby reinstamp'd upon the Soul,</HI> no Man living shall see the Lord. <HI>And it is very observable, that our Divine Master, in the famous Passage before referred to, concerning the</HI> absol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te <HI>Necessity of</HI> Regeneration, <HI>does not say unless a Man be born again he</HI> shall not, <HI>but unless a Man be born again he</HI> can∣not <HI>enter into the Kingdom of God, For it is founded on the very Nature of Things, that unless we have Dispositions wrought in us suitable and answerable to the Objects that are to entertain us, we can take no Manner of Complacency or Satisfaction in them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Nay, in one Place of Scripture,</HI> Sanctification <HI>is put before</HI> Justification, <HI>on purpose as it were, to shew that there is no Salvation with∣out it.</HI> But ye are <HI>washed,</HI> says the Apostle, but ye are <HI>sanctified.</HI> Another indispu∣table Argument why we must be <HI>new Crea∣tures,</HI> viz. <HI>because without it</HI> Christ is dead in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="004588_0121_100DA69E378C2760"/>If St. <HI>Paul</HI> would pronounce an <HI>Anathema</HI> against the Archbishop on that naughty Pas∣sage of his, how much more would he do so against you on these of yours! <HI>Here</HI> (in these Passages of yours) <HI>is not a Word about the All sufficient perfect and everlasting Righte∣ousness and Death of Christ, as the sole Cause and Condition of our being accepted by the Father;</HI> (but what asserts the direct contra∣ry, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Righteousness and Death of Christ are not Allsufficient as the sole Cause of our being accepted by the Father, but that without <HI>Regeneration</HI> Christ is dead in vain) <HI>Our Sanctification which is the</HI> Ef∣fect <HI>and not the</HI> Cause <HI>of Christ's Righteous∣ness being imputed to us, is here as elsewhere represented, as the sole Cause of our Justifica∣tion and Salvation. So that</HI> (a monstrous Inference!) <HI>our Righteousness, which is but as filthy Rags, is here valued at so high a Price, as to be made to purchase, or which is the same, is made the Cause of our enjoying Christ, and Heaven and eternal Happiness.</HI> And what is this but Deisin refined? No, Sir, I'll tell you what it is; Arrant Gibberish and Nonsense; and equally so, applied to the <HI>Archbishop's</HI> Passage, or your own.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="004588_0122_100DA6A247A98858"/>The Archbishop has asserted <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or the <HI>Image</HI> of God being repaired in us, as a necessary Cause, that is instrumental Cause, and Means of our Salvation: And have not you asserted, that without this <HI>no Man shall see the Lord?</HI> without it, we <HI>can∣not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> with∣out it, <HI>there is no Salvation?</HI> and without it <HI>Christ is dead in vain?</HI> The Archbishop has asserted it <HI>the only Qualification</HI> that makes us capable of Happiness: And have not you asserted it as such, <HI>founded in the very Nature of Things?</HI> Or is the Asserting it <HI>the only Qualification of our Happiness,</HI> repre∣senting it as the <HI>SOLE CAUSE</HI> of our Salvation? Lay your Hand upon your Heart <HI>(Sir)</HI> and say, whether the Archbi∣shop has not asserted <HI>a supreme Cause</HI> of that very <HI>Qualification!</HI> But above all; supposing the <HI>Archbishop</HI> and yourself from him▪ (for let even a Methodist say) whether on the Comparison, there be no Grounds to presume, that you had the chief Materials of your Discourse from his; especially from the Paragraphs next preceeding that you censure) had worded your Sentiments in such a Manner, as to leave it doubtful, whether you meant Regeneration the <HI>SOLE

<P>And thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> (in your <HI>Mountebank</HI> Way) you have, young <HI>David</HI> like, as you fancy, slain your <HI>Goliah:</HI> But whether it be not in the <HI>Pride and Naughtiness of your Heart,</HI> you have made so absurd an Attempt, and so foolishly manag'd it, the World is at no loss to determine; for the great and good <HI>Archbishop</HI> is still quite alive and well (his Works and Memory I mean) and will doubt∣less long survive in the highest <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>E∣steem,</HI> after you and your dirty <HI>Pamphlets</HI> are sunk into Oblivion.

Who dares dispute when you pronounce, <HI>the Clery's falling away from the Principles of the Reformation;</HI> that such or such Books

<HI>are founded on the</HI> Arminian <HI>Scheme;</HI> and <HI>the Chief Cause why many have built their hopes of Salvation on a false Bottom?</HI> And agreeably as you have pronounced, or born your noble Testimony concerning the Writings of Arbishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> as directly contrary to the Gospel of <HI>Christ;</HI> if any dares to dispute the Matter, let them but remember, <HI>it has pleased God to give you the true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace,</HI> this must Command Assent, and hush e∣very Tongue to Silence. Thus an elder Brother of yours, the ever memorable GEORGE FOX, (an <HI>Infallible</HI> also in his Days, <HI>to whom God had given the true Know∣ledge of the Doctrines of Grace</HI>) bore his Testimony concerning the BIBLE, as on∣ly a <HI>Dead Letter;</HI> and which was impli∣citly recieved by his Followers, at least of that Age.</P>
<P>And thus equip'd you advance on the Author of <HI>the Whole Duty of Man.</HI> <Q>This Book (you pronounce) is in general cal-to <HI>civilize,</HI> but you're persuaded never was a means of <HI>converting</HI> one single Soul.</Q> Will your <HI>Reverence</HI> stay your Hand here a little? <Q>The Book (you say) is calcu∣lated to <HI>civilize;</HI></Q> Something then 'tis

good for; please not utterly to destroy it. The Wrath, you know, of another noble <HI>Champion of Grace,</HI> See <HI>Edwards's</HI> Preacher, P. 49, 50.) was kindled against this Book; but his went no farther than the <HI>Title, Yours</HI> extends to the <HI>Preface,</HI> general <HI>Titles,</HI> and <HI>Index.</HI> <Q>The Book (saith he) pretends to treat of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> and puts us off with <HI>Half</HI> of it.</Q> Bad indeed! But is there no way to salve the Affair? Let the Title be altered, and for the future run, <HI>One half of the Whole Duty of Man;</HI> or rather let your <HI>Reverence,</HI> some spare Day or other, supply the other <HI>Half</HI> that's wanting, under the Title of the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>second Part,</HI> as you please, to be added next Edition, and then the first general Title and Book itself may stand. And this, I hope, you'll the more readily fall in with, because of the Judgment of this Brother <HI>Champion</HI> of yours, who with some Tem∣per and Modesty says: <Q>I deny not that the aforesaid Book is of very good Use in its Kind, and is in some Respects an excel∣lent Piece; and it is probable that if the <HI>worthy Author</HI> had lived longer, he would have made those necessary Additions to it which I have hinted.</Q> Will either of
<PB N="127" REF="004588_0127_100DA6AE36A906D8"/>
these proposals do? By no means, <Q>You have look'd over the general <HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>Index,</HI> and cannot find the WORD <HI>Rege∣neration</HI> so much as once mentioned.</Q> A fatal Defect indeed! I have just been looking into my <HI>Concordance,</HI> and almost tremble to tell you, that I find this WORD but twice mentioned in the whole <HI>Bible;</HI> and in neither Place anywise to your Pur∣pose! What the Consequence may be, when you have considered the Matter, I cannot say.</P>
<P>But neither is this all. <Q>The whole Treatise <HI>(you say)</HI> is built on such a false Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Christian at Heart; but also that he had not so much as a Head-Know∣ledge of the true Gospel of Christ.</Q> All Heads, 'tis certain, are not alike furnished, nor capable of the same Furniture; and therefore, saving your Infalibility, this Pas∣sage plainly shews your Head sufficiently furnished, with what I forbear to name. But what is this <HI>false Foundation this Treatise is built upon?</HI> Why it is contained in these Words of the Preface, <HI>This second Covenant was made with</HI> Adam, <HI>and us in him, present∣ly after his Fall; and is briefly contained,</HI> Gen.
<PB N="128" REF="004588_0128_100DA6B00AE7AFE0"/>
iii. 15. <HI>where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents Head. And this was made up as the first was, of some Mercies to be offered by God, and some Duties to be performed by us.</HI> In this Passage lies the false Divinity, or <HI>Fundamental Error</HI> that poisons the whole Book: But, alas, who that is not some Way <HI>Enlightned,</HI> nay, who that is not equally <HI>Enlightened</HI> with your <HI>Reverence,</HI> shall be able to find it? The <HI>Scotch second sight People</HI> pretend often to see strange Things, which no Body else can see but themselves; and the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Mufti</HI> pretend to see all the <HI>Fundamental Errors,</HI> and false Divinity in the World; but what is all that to me, except they can open my Eyes to see the same also? If they can open my Eyes to see the same Things as they pretend to see, the Obligation of doing it will be very great; but their pre∣tending to see this or the other, which yet I cannot see is of no Avail to me, who am not disposed to rely on their Pretences, or to see with their Eyes, but with my own.</P>
<P>This Passage asserts, <Q>that God made a second Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, presently after his Fall; <HI>Gen.</HI> 3d. 15th.</Q> — This you say, <HI>is false Divinity
<PB N="129" REF="004588_0129_100DA6B2F2D346B8"/>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VI.</HI> To the Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALAS Sir is it come to this at last! That you to whom <HI>God has given a true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace!</HI> And who in the Fulness of <HI>that Knowledge</HI> had so absolutely <HI>vindicated</HI> your modest and <HI>christian</HI> Assertion, viz. <HI>That Archbishop</HI> Tillotson <HI>knew no more of Christianity than</HI> Mahomet! That you, I say, instead of <HI>de∣fending</HI> your noble <HI>Vindication,</HI> are fain to run for <HI>Shelter</HI> under the Wings of the poor shatter'd Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> (as dogmatical cap∣tious, unfair and confuted a Writer as any of his Time) and to throw out his ex∣ploded Snarling Stuff to your Opposers, and bid them Answer it! Are these the Arts of a Man of your <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces?</HI> Or can you think your Opposers simple enough to be catch'd by them; and set to Work to confute such Stuff, as has been confuted and exploded above 30 Years a∣go? It is a <HI>Maxim,</HI> I am told among the <HI>Jesuits</HI> in Controversy, never to regard the
<PB N="134" REF="004588_0134_100DA6BEE72B05F8"/>
Objections of an Adversary; but to ne∣glect them, and always return to their <HI>own Assertion,</HI> as if nothing had been of∣fered against it. A <HI>Maxim</HI> worthy indeed of that <HI>singular Order!</HI> Do not you also pursue this Trick of theirs in your <HI>Pole∣micks?</HI> Did you learn it of them? Or is it the Fruit of your own Genius? Do you Sir, first vindicate Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> against his Opposers in the Case, and your Oppo∣sers may probably take some Notice of your <HI>Vindication.</HI></P>
<P>But mean-time, as this Letter, tho' di∣rected to you, is design'd to be publish'd, and as many of the Readers of your <HI>Epistle</HI> in these Parts, may never have seen ei∣ther Dr. <HI>Edwards's</HI> PREACHER, nor any Vindication the Archbishop from the injurious Treatment contain'd in it; I shall therefore take leave, in a few Words, to put such Readers in the Way, to avoid Imposition in the Case, and to do common Justice to the Parties con∣cern'd. And to this Purpose the follow∣ing single <HI>Rule,</HI> and a few <HI>Instances</HI> to shew the Necessity and Usefulness of it, shall suffice.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="004588_0135_100DA6C129147AC0"/>The Rule is this, <HI>That such Readers do by no Means trust to the Authority either of Dr.</HI> Edwards, <HI>your</HI> Reverence, <HI>or any</HI> other, <HI>concerning any Passages excepted to, of the Writings of the</HI> Archbishop; <HI>but that they see with their own Eyes, by reading them in Connection as they stand in the said Writings, and with due Regard to the Scope and Argu∣ment of the respective Discourses in which they are found.</HI> This is the <HI>Rule,</HI> and the Necessity and Usefulness of it will appear in these following Instances.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Tillot.</HI> Works, Vol. III. P. 414. <HI>You do not find any where</HI> revealed <HI>in all the Scripture, that there is a God.</HI> <Q>And yet (excepts Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>) it is agreed by all sober and intelligent Christians, that there is express <HI>Mention</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of a Deity in the Scriptures.</Q> Is this a fair and honest Quotation from the Archbi∣shop? Or is this a fair and honest Ex∣ception to it? It is <HI>not any where</HI> REVEA∣LED, says the Archbishop; <HI>there is express Mention and Confirmation of it,</HI> says Dr. <HI>Edwards:</HI> What Inconsistency or Contra∣dicton in these? The <HI>Archbishop</HI> denies not the express <HI>Mention</HI> and <HI>Confirmation;</HI> The <HI>Dr.</HI> asserts not the <HI>Revelation.</HI> But
<PB N="136" REF="004588_0136_100DA6C3988C9390"/>
let the Reader see the Passage in this follow∣ing Connection (as it ought to have been quo∣ted) with his own Eyes. <Q>A divine Reve∣lation cannot possibly be an Argument inducing me to believe the Existence of a God, for this plain Reason; because a divine Revelation can be no Argument to any, that is not persuaded that it is a di∣vine Revelation: But before I can be per∣suaded that any Revelation is from God, I must be persuaded there is a God; and if so, there is no Need of this Argument to prove to me there is one. And therefore you do not find it any where revealed in all the Scripture, that there is a God. The Scripture often declares, that <HI>Jeho∣vah is the true and living God;</HI> and that, <HI>besides him there is no other:</HI> But it doth not reveal but every where suppose, that there is one.</Q> Thus stands the Passage in Connection, containing as plain and de∣monstrable a Truth, as any Proposition in <HI>Euclid.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. From the same Vol. and Page of the <HI>Archbishop</HI>'s Works, Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> quotes these Words; <HI>I do not find the Immortality of the Soul, or a future State is expressly re∣vealed in the Bible;</HI> and excepts to them as
<PB N="137" REF="004588_0137_100DA6C672F70710"/>
denying the <HI>express Mention</HI> and <HI>Confirma∣tion</HI> of these Particulars, in the Scriptures. The Words indeed are in the same Vol. and Page, but not together as they are quo∣ted. The Passage in Connection runs thus: <HI>As for the other two Principles of Natural Religion, the Immortality of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul, and a future State; after we believe a God▪ we may be persuaded of these from Divine Reve∣lation; and that doth give the</HI> highest <HI>and</HI> firmest Assurance <HI>of them, in the Resurrec∣tion of Christ from the Dead.</HI> Yet I do not find but that these <HI>also are rather supposed, than</HI> expresly revealed in the Bible. <HI>Indeed the Immortality of the Soul may be inferred from several Places of Scripture, and the Te∣nour of the whole Bible. And so a future State, which as for the Thing it self, seems to he supposed as a Thing acknowledged by Natu∣ral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight; only the Scripture hath revealed the Circumstances more particularly to us, and given us</HI> higher Assurance <HI>of the Thing.</HI> Thus let the Reader see with his own Eyes, and not trust the Quotations of <HI>Edwards,</HI> your <HI>Reverence,</HI> or any like foul and partial <HI>Writer.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As to the Archbishop's denying such Power or <HI>Prerogative</HI> to the Devil, as <HI>to im∣print
<PB N="138" REF="004588_0138_100DA6C805D03C48"/>
wicked Thoughts on the Minds of Men,</HI> (Vol. II. P. 532, 533, <HI>not</HI> 352, 353. as you directed) I must beg the <HI>Reader</HI> to consult that whole <HI>Sermon,</HI> intitled, <HI>the Knowledge of God.</HI> Of the several Passages relating to this Particular, I shall here set down but this one. — <HI>I do not see, how by any Means it can be granted, without Prejudice to this</HI> Prerogative <HI>of God, which the Scripture plain∣ly gives him, of being</HI> the only Knower of the Heart, <HI>that the Devil can have so immediate an Access to our Minds, as to put wicked Thoughts into them; nor can I think that when it is said, that</HI> Satan provoked David to Number the People, <HI>that</HI> the Devil entred into <HI>Judas; that</HI> Satan had filled the Heart of <HI>Ananias,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that any or all of these Ex∣pressions do amount to such an immediate Po∣wer, of putting wicked Thoughts into Men's Minds; but they only signify, that the Devil hath a greater Hand in some Sins than others; and that a Heart wickedly bent and inclined, gives him a great Advantage to tempt Men more powerfully, by presenting the Occasions of such wicked Thoughts and Actions to them: For it is usual, in Scripture Phrase, as to as∣cribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, so all e∣vil Thoughts and Actions to the Devil; not that
<PB N="139" REF="004588_0139_100DA6CA317EAB68"/>
he is the immediate Cause of them, but because he is always ready to tempt Men to them, and one Way or other to promote them.'</HI> — Thus every <HI>Reader</HI> may see, from this Passage, but more fully from the whole Tenor of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> that the Archbishop is only assert∣ing <HI>the Knowledge of Men's Hearts</HI> to be the <HI>sole Prerogative</HI> of God, and therefore deny∣ing the same <HI>Prerogative</HI> to the Devil. But the <HI>unparalleled</HI> Abuse of the latter Part of this Passage by Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and <HI>yourself</HI> his Voucher, must not be passed over in Silence. The lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Part of this Passage you cite from Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Preacher, P. 117. Word for Word, thus; — <HI>As it is usual, in the Scripture Phrase, to ascribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, so all evil thoughts to the Devil; not that he is the immediate Cause of these, no more than God's Spirit is the Au∣thor of the other.</HI> Thus Word for Word, I say, you have cited from Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and all in <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aliks,</HI> as if they all were the Words of the Archbishop. In this Sir, you have injure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both the Archbishop and the <HI>Dr.</HI> For neither are these last Words, <HI>viz.</HI> NO MORE THAN GOD'S SPIRIT IS THE AUTHOR OF THE OTHER, the Words of the Archbishop at all; nor indeed has
<PB N="140" REF="004588_0140_100DA6CC28BDA830"/>
Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> set them down <HI>as such</HI> in his Book, but in a different Character, as an Addition of his <HI>own.</HI> Rare juggling Work indeed! Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> injuriously <HI>adds</HI> to the Archbishop's Words, and still more in∣juriously censures him on that <HI>Addition.</HI> You, to mend the Matter, put the <HI>added</HI> Words directly into the Archbishop's Mouth, and vouch the same Censure, viz. <HI>Is not this a strange Comparison between these two contrary Spirits? And doth not the Framer of it discover what new Models of Divinity he affects? He is pleased to excuse the Devil from ejecting any bad Thoughts in∣to Men's Minds, and he exempts God's Spirit from being the Cause or Author of any good or holy Thoughts.</HI> The <HI>Comparison</HI> is strange enough indeed! But whether Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and your <HI>Reverence</HI> are not the <HI>Framers</HI> of it, let the Reader see. <HI>You,</HI> Sir, and your Brother <HI>Champion</HI> are the <HI>Framers</HI> of it, and as <HI>stupidly as injuriously</HI> have you <HI>framed</HI> it. For so far is the Archbishop from <HI>exemp∣ting God's Spirit from being the Author of any good or holy Thoughts,</HI> that it is the whole Scope or Argument of that very Discourse, to prove it the <HI>sole</HI> Prerogative of God, <HI>to know the Hearts of Men;</HI> and
<PB N="141" REF="004588_0141_100DA6CE9F39D9C8"/>
consequently his Power of being the im∣mediate Author of <HI>good and holy Thoughts</HI> there; and denying this Prerogative to the Devil, and consequently his Power of be∣ing the immediate Author of <HI>bad or evil ones.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> is now dead and before his Maker, but you are yet alive, and therefore upon you I call, either to <HI>vindi∣cate</HI> or <HI>retract</HI> your Testimony in this Matter, in as publick a Manner as you have bore it, or to rest under the Charge of being a <HI>wilful Deciever.</HI></P>
<P>These few Instances are sufficient to shew the Necessity and Usefulness of observing the above Rule in the present Case, and in∣deed in all like Cases of Controversy what∣soever. Let no Reader trust the Citations of either Party or Parties concerned; but consult and see them with his own Eyes. For how easy a Matter is it for a dishonest Adversary to mis-represent and abuse the Writings of any Author, specially if gone to rest from his Labours? It is but expos∣ing them in <HI>Shreds, Scraps,</HI> or <HI>Sentences de∣tached</HI> from their Connection, with some few Addition of Words, Glosses, Inuendoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to give a wrong Turn; and
<PB N="142" REF="004588_0142_100DA6D205AAF168"/>
the Work is done: By these and like Means, the poor <HI>Author</HI> is demolished; made to speak the very Reverse of his true Sentiments, the very contrary of what he meant and intended. Let Readers take Care; the best of Writers are not exempt∣ed from this Usage. The sacred Pages have not escaped it, at the Hands of <HI>Collins, Tin∣dal,</HI> and other <HI>Infidel</HI> Writers.</P>
<P>As to the Archbishop's Sentiments of <HI>Christianity</HI> in general, so charitably repre∣sented by Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and your <HI>Reverence,</HI> as <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>disparaging,</HI> and his either <HI>giv∣ing a very crude Account of Christian Duties, or jumbling them with mere Acts of Morality;</HI> I shall only lay before the Reader, the fol∣lowing <HI>Paragraph</HI> from the <HI>Bishop of</HI> Lon∣don<HI>'s</HI> 2d <HI>Pastoral Letter,</HI> P. 64. 65. 4th Edit. <Q>It may not be improper, before I shut up this Head, to observe that several of our most eminent Divines after the Restoration, set themselves both by Preaching and Writing to enlarge upon the Importance of Moral Duties, and to recommend them with great Earnestness to the Regard of the People; to such a Degree, as to stand charg'd by others with too great a Disre∣gard of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrines and Duties peculiar
<PB N="143" REF="004588_0143_100DA6D41C166248"/>
to Christianity. Whereas, the Case in reality was this. During the Times of Confusion, many of the Preachers had not only forborn to inculcate the Duties of Morality, but had labour'd to depreciate them; to persuade the People that Faith was All, and Works Nothing. And there∣fore the Clergy after the Restoration, in order to take off those unhappy Impres∣sions, found themselves obliged to incul∣cate with more than ordinary Diligence, the Necessity of moral Duties in the Chris∣tain Life, and to labour to restore them to their proper Share in the Christian Scheme. But those of them, who with the honest View I have mention'd, labour'd the most zealously in that Way, were at the same Time as zealous to explain to the People the great Work of our Redemption by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the Means of Salvation which God has appointed: <HI>(a)</HI> The Cor∣ruption and Misery into which Mankind was sunk by the Fall of our first Parents; <HI>(b)</HI> The Necessity of a Mediator to reco∣ver them, and restore them to the Favour of God; <HI>(c)</HI> The Incarnation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Son of God for that End; <HI>(d)</HI> The Goodness of God in appointing his own Son to be

<P>I should here put an End to this Trouble, but as your Letter <HI>to the Inhabitants of Ma∣riland, &amp;c.</HI> is annexed to this I have now remark'd upon, I shall take Leave to sub∣join a few Remarks on that valuable Per∣formance.</P>
<P>In my humble Opinion, Sir, had you caused another <HI>Edition</HI> to be printed at <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> of the <HI>Bishop of</HI> London<HI>'s Letter to the Masters and Mistresses of Slaves in these Parts,</HI> and dispersed the Copies on your Way, as you came through the several Pro∣vinces, you had done much more effectual Service, than by the Publication of your own. But if you knew of any such Let∣ter of His <HI>Lordship</HI>'s being extant, I suppose you'll plead a special Call for the Publica∣tion of your own, and that answers all Ob∣jections.</P>
<P><HI>You must inform them</HI> (the Inhabitants of <HI>Maryland, &amp;c.</HI>) you say, <HI>In the Meekness and Gentleness of Christ, &amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Invective</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="004588_0146_100DA6DA9D08D898"/>
is so apparent throughout this notable Epi¦stle, that these can only be taken for some <HI>Cant-Terms</HI> you accustom yourself to in all your Scriblings. But what is it <HI>you Must thus inform them of?</HI> Why, <HI>that you</HI> Think <HI>God has a Quarrel with them, &amp;c.</HI> Had God sent you charged with this <HI>special Message,</HI> you might well say, that you <HI>MUST</HI> inform them of it; but as 'tis only a Matter of <HI>your own Thoughts,</HI> the <HI>Necessity</HI> does not so well appear. Your <HI>Thoughts</HI> in this Case may possibly be idle or ill grounded▪ and so better kept at home. But <HI>God you THINK has a Quarrel with them,</HI> and <HI>for their Abuse of and Cruelty to the poor Negroes.</HI> That God will <HI>have a Quarrel</HI> with any of the Human Race, for their <HI>Abuse of and Cruelty</HI> to others, is a very just Thought; and sin∣ful out of all Doubt it is, for any of those Inhabitants <HI>to use their Negroes as bad, nay worse, than as tho' they were Brutes.</HI> But pray, Sir, on what Grounds do you bring <HI>this Charge</HI> against <HI>the Generality</HI> of those In∣habitants who own Negroes, <HI>of using them as had, nay worse than as tho' they were Brutes?</HI> Do you <HI>know</HI> this Charge to be just and honest? Or have you sufficient <HI>Evidence</HI> to support it? No; you only
<PB N="147" REF="004588_0147_100DA6DF16DB8060"/>
<HI>think</HI> it to be so, and <HI>fear</HI> it, and <HI>believe</HI> it. But on the contrary, I shall presume, and on much better Grounds, to <HI>think, fear,</HI> and <HI>believe,</HI> that your Charge is false and inju∣rious! and that the very Reverse of it is true, <HI>viz.</HI> that what particular Exceptions soever there may be as to <HI>good Usage</HI> of Slaves (as some doubtless there are) yet that the <HI>Generality</HI> of Owners use their Slaves with all due Humanity, whether in respect of <HI>Work,</HI> of <HI>Food,</HI> or <HI>Raiment.</HI> And therefore I farther <HI>think</HI> and <HI>believe,</HI> that the <HI>Generality</HI> of Owners of Slaves in the respective Colonies, may bring their Actions of <HI>Slander</HI> against you; and that in a certain Country I know, you would be <HI>indicted</HI> for meddling, as you have done in this Matter, which may endanger the Peace and Safety of the Community.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have only your <HI>Thoughts,</HI> your <HI>Fears,</HI> and your <HI>Belief</HI> on the Matter; you advance a-pace into <HI>positive</HI> Assertions. <HI>And perhaps,</HI> you say, <HI>it might be better for the poor Creatures themselves to be hurried out of Life, than to be made</HI> so miserable, <HI>as they</HI> generally <HI>are in it. And indeed, con∣sidering what Usage they commonly meet with,</HI> &amp;c. — I suppress the remainder of this
<PB N="148" REF="004588_0148_100DA6E0EE393C98"/>
and the next following <HI>Paragraph</HI> of your Epistle, as judging it both sinful, and dan∣gerous to the publick Safety to reprint them. More Virulence and Falsehood cannot be contained in so few Lines. For so far are the generality of Slaves in these Colonies, from being miserable, that I dare confident∣ly vouch and affirm, and partly on my own Knowledge, that their Lives in gene∣ral are more happy and comfortable in all temporal Respects (the Point of Liberty only excepted) than the Lives of three fourths of the hired <HI>farming</HI> Servants, and Day Labourers, either in <HI>Scotland, Ireland,</HI> or even in many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> who not only labour <HI>harder,</HI> and fare <HI>worse,</HI> but have moreover the Care and Concern on their Minds how to provide for their Fa∣milies; which <HI>Slaves</HI> are entirely exemp∣ted from, their Children being all provi∣ded for at the <HI>Owner</HI>'s Charge.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if this be really the Case with respect to the <HI>generality</HI> of Slaves in these Colonies, which can fully be proved it is; what <HI>Apology</HI> can suffice either for the Matter or Manner of your Letter, specially the two modest <HI>Paragraphs</HI> above mention∣ed? Will you plead <HI>Hearsay</HI> or <HI>Report?</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="004588_0149_100DA6E72EFC9468"/>
Alas, Sir, this Plea will never do! I have heard by <HI>Report,</HI> of your <HI>Abuse and Cruelty</HI> to the poor <HI>Orphans</HI> under your Care, not only in <HI>Pinching</HI> their Bellies, but giving them up also to Task-Master<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Mistresses, <HI>who Plow upon their Backs, and make lomg Furrows,</HI> in a very inhuman Manner. And would you think it a fair and honest Thing in me, should I, on such <HI>Hearsay</HI> or <HI>Report,</HI> print and publish a <HI>Let∣ter</HI> directed to you, pretending a Necessity of <HI>informing</HI> you, that <HI>God had a Quarrel with you, for your Cruelty to the poor Orphans;</HI> that <HI>perhaps they had better be hurried out of Life, than be made so miserable as they are in it;</HI> and that <HI>I wondered, they did not either put an End to their own Lives or Yours, rather than bear such Usage:</HI> Would you think this, I say, a fair and honest Proceed∣ing in me, and not rather foul and injuri∣ous, and having no good meaning, either towards <HI>yourself</HI> or the <HI>Orphans?</HI> And tho' it came prefaced <HI>in the Meekness and Gentleness of Christ,</HI> would you not regard it rather as a Burlesque of the Words? No, Sir, I know ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be a due <HI>Discipline,</HI> or Rod of Correction exercis'd among Chil∣dren; and this may be, and often is misre∣presented
<PB N="150" REF="004588_0150_100DA6E34156BA48"/>
for Cruelty and bad Usage. I know also, that like Discipline and Correc∣tion must be observed among every Parcel of Slaves; and which in like Manner, may be, and often is misrepresented in the same Light: And therefore no such Re∣ports, in either Case, can justify a direct Accusation.</P>
<P>As to the little or <HI>no proper Care taken by Owners of the Souls of their Slaves,</HI> it is too sad a Truth; and I tremble to think, what Account they will give of it at the great Day! A sore Evil indeed! But for which, your Letter, I conceive, will afford but a poor Remedy. I cannot think so ill of <HI>any,</HI> as you do of <HI>most</HI> of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>on Purpose,</HI> they keep their Slaves ignorant of Christianity. I believe the Reason of their being so kept, is the want of one certain u∣niform Method of teaching them, and which I hope will soon be established with Success. I readily agree, that the Objection to teaching them Christianity, <HI>viz. that it would tend to make them less governable,</HI> or <HI>worse Slaves,</HI> is wild and extravagant: But wish you had a little explained, what you mean by the Phrases, <HI>Christianizing;</HI> and MADE <HI>thorough Christians;</HI> and <HI>the Gospel
<PB N="151" REF="004588_0151_100DA6E8C07DF618"/>
preach'd with Power;</HI> whether by these Phrases you mean Things in the Power of Men? For sure I am, <HI>that</HI> Paul <HI>may plant, and</HI> Apollos <HI>may water, but God alone can give the Encrease.</HI> Men may teach <HI>true Chri∣stianity,</HI> but no Man can MAKE <HI>a true Chri∣stian.</HI></P>
<P>Your Complement on <HI>Pastors and People,</HI> and apprehended Difference 'twixt the Im∣portation of <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Bibles,</HI> are no <HI>Excep∣tions</HI> to the usual Stile, Modesty, or Man∣ners of your Epistles, and particularly of this under Consideration, which I have now done with, and remain,</P>

<P>Sir, you know 'tis my hard fate to be lately appointed to propagate our Holy Religion in a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un∣try where the darling Idol is Liberty; where Men will take nothing upon Trust, where they hate some of the fundamental Tenets of our <HI>Catholick</HI> Faith, and as I de∣desire faithfully to discharge my Duty; so I want your Assistance to pair off the Roughness of some of those Things, till once we have engaged 'em into our Party, and then there is hope they will be easily reconciled to what seems most severe in our holy Religion.</P>

<P>What in particular thinkest thou deserves my Care?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this Doctrine of Infalibiliiy, or implicit Faith in their spiritual Guides, is what they abhor; they read their Bibles, and have learnt to refuse us the Privilege of thinking for them, or explaining the Scrip∣tures by our Traditions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Esc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a Remedy provided in this Case that will bring them by degrees to be true Sons of our Church. The greatest Number of People in every Place never think for themselves, but follow the Man they admire. Your Business is to set up for uncommon Degrees of Sanctity, make bold Pretences to Illuminations and the Indwelling of the Spirit, and who can contradict you; Ply these Hereticks with Scripture, fix on that Text <HI>the moral Man exerciseth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned; but he that is spi∣ritual judgeth all Things, and is judged of none.</HI> Insist on it that all who differ from you in their Notions are <HI>carnal Men,</HI> who never felt the Power of Godliness in their own Souls; produce your own Experiences, as the best Commentaries on the Scriptures, and this will suit your Purpose as well as our Traditions, and will keep Men from explaining any Text contrary to Experiences of the Godly. These Hereticks themselves depend on the Spirit? Take a little Advantage of what is natural to their Tempers to expect, and what there is ground for the Righteous to wait for, turn to mechanick Im∣pulses and violent Movings, and this will not fail to suit most Tempers, pretend that the same Spirit who inspired the Apostles is freely bestowed on you, and since natural Men cannot understand the Scriptures; and you have the Spirit in such extraordinary Measure, you may surely claim the Rights to shew them the true Meaning of the Word, and to think for them in religious Matters, and this will effectually wrest the Bible cut of their Hands who think not as you do, nor receive your Doctrine as the true Mind of God. For if any will dare to oppose the Sentiments of such a holy Man, proclaim him an Enemy to God and his Interest, and set the Mobb on him, and it will pass for Merrit to make a Sacrifice of such an Hererick.</P>

<P>Ply 'em with the same Weapons, tell them, <HI>The spiritual Man judgeth all Things;</HI> tell 'em <HI>That you have

such Feelings of the Spirit, that by a certain Simpathy, by com∣paring your Experiences with theirs, you can know certainly whether they be Christians or not.</HI> Thunder 'em out of their Senses with dreadful Sounds; that will do as well with the Ignorant as all the Thunders of the <HI>Vatican.</HI> And since they themselves confess, there may be Men sound in the Faith, and regular in their Lives, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet not real Christians. Hence you may easily perswade 'em not to trust their own Judgement or Examination of their State, but to give themselves up to their spiritual Guides, who can clearly see thro' 'em, and learn from their Confession how Matters are between God and their Souls. And since none but real Christians, as they all grant, have a Right to sealing Ordinances, here is their Hold; shew 'em <HI>the Danger of Partaking if they are not Christians;</HI> insist that they confess their Cases, under a Pretence of Reciting their Experiences, 'till you school and accustom 'em to confess themselves to you upon all Occasions; and as you know they cannot tell their Ex∣periences without mixing amongst them some of their Relapses and Miscarriages, this will bring them by De∣grees to lay their Sins before you, and introduce Confes∣sions of all Sorts, and gently bring them home to our holy Mother.</P>
</SP>

<P>But their Teachers will prevent this, and we shall labour in vain, unless we can spoil their Credit, and bring the People to believe that the Blessing depends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Intention of the Preacher.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Esc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's too bold a stroak all at once▪ but act your Part nicely, and the Thing will be manag'd, you must, as I said, make very great Pretences to the Spirit, and endeavour for a while to live stricter than their Teach∣ers, and these Things in any Man, especially a Stranger, never fail to gain the good Opinions and Admiration of the Multitude, proclaim their Teachers <HI>Carnal Men, Enemies to God,</HI> and strangers to those <HI>Christian</HI> Experi∣ences which you have, and by consequence unfitt for their Office, and unable to direct Men in their great Concerns and then the more they oppose you, the more family will People believe your Report; because they will imagine you see further than they do, and are
<PB N="155" REF="004588_0155_100DA6F30D3BF468"/>
able and ready to discover such Hypocrites; by this means you will bring them to confine the Blessings of God on his Ordinances to the Piety of Men, and having once got it, thus restrained to the Piety: The next re∣move will be to the Intentions of the <HI>Spiritual Guides,</HI> and if once you can bring them to believe that their Salvation or Damnation is so much in their Power, and depending on your Intentions, your point is fully gained.</P>

<SPEAKER>Esc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courage my Son, <HI>cride quod habes &amp; habes.</HI> Believe that you are able to do Wonders, and you shall succeede, if you can bring them to renounce Reason and depend on their Spiritual Guides. What difficulty can there be in this? You know that the Plan is laid to wrest the BIBLE out of their Hands, by giving it up to your pious Explications, and you know that in Scrip∣ture it is said that <HI>Christ is form'd in believers:</HI> By <HI>Christ</HI> in this Place tell them (Vol. 2. P 33.) <HI>that they are to understand the Man Christ, or the human Nature of our bles∣sed Lord;</HI> and if the Man Christ or his human Nature is form'd in every true believer, what a vast Number of human Bodies must be all in different Places; at the same Time that his individual Body is in Heaven? And what is still more surprizing, <HI>The Man Christ must be in another Man, or two different Bodies be in one and the same Place at one and the same Time without just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing one another, and without altering the external visible, bodily appearance in the least, that the Person had before the Man Christ was formed in him;</HI> and when this Doctrine is swallow'd, which I promise you many will do very readily; how easily may you again bring them to be∣lieve, that the Body of Christ may be in Heaven, and in a Thousand consecrated Wafers at the same Time, without altering their outward Appearance? If it be reasonable to believe that the Man Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r his Body is in the Believer, when he tells us that he is form'd in the Believer, is there not as good ground to conclude, that it is in the consecrated Wafer, when he says <HI>this is my Body?</HI> If it be possible that the Man Christ Jesus is
<PB N="156" REF="004588_0156_100DA6F4D7AB3440"/>
now exalted in Heaven, and at the same Time is in Thousands of Believers. Why is it not as easily to con∣cieve, that he is at once in Heaven and in Thousands of consecrated Wafers? But you may possibly think that it will star<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the People to imagine that the Priest by repeating a few Words can convert a piece of Bread in∣to the Body of his Redeemer; no my Son, there's no ground for such fears, you may easily bring them to so strong a Faith as to swallow all you Teach them, with∣out ever examining it by saying with bold Assurance <HI>you speak the Truth in Christ, and Lie not:</HI> But to make the Thing take more readily, I have a Salve to Cure all. Tell them with a Holy Grimace that the Words which in the other Sacrament, we Translate Baptizing them <HI>in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</HI> may as well be render'd, Baptizing them <HI>into the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</HI> And upon this turn given to the Text, which none must venture to Question, there is a suffici∣ent Foundation laid for this Power which we Claim, and it will effectually support the Doctrine of <HI>Transubstan∣tiation:</HI> For if the Priest by Baptism may change Men who are <HI>by Nature half Beasts and half Devils,</HI> into the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, certainly he may with as much ease by repeating the Words of the Institution in the Lords Supper change a bit of Bread, which is not near so bad as a Devil or a Beast into the real Body and Blood of Christ; if the one change can be made in Baptism; why not the other in the Lords Sup∣per? 'Tis as easy to change a Wafer into Christs Body, as a Man into a God, and he that believes the last, will soon be brought to swollow the first.</P>
