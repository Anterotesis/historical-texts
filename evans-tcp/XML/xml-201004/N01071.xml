<HEAD>Some Observations on <HI>D: Leeds</HI> book, called <HI>The Second part of the Great Mystery of</HI> Fox-Craft.</HEAD>
<P>First, <HI>I</HI> observe</P>
<P>IN his Title-page he boasts, of his <HI>Mr. Talbot's</HI> appointing time &amp; place of meeting our Friends, to prove the charg∣es in the <HI>Bom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> against us; but he tells not, that that per∣emptory challenge was soon answered by us in one half-sheet, called <HI>False News from Gath &amp;c.</HI> to which I further add, that according to the Prover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what is spoken may easily be mis∣rendred or forgotten; witness that very little discource <HI>P: Fretwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had with <HI>Elizabeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enton</HI> in the presence of <HI>M: Wheat</HI> at <HI>Burling∣ton;</HI> the one solemnly denies what was there alledged by <HI>D: L:</HI> in his <HI>Almanack</HI> 1705. to be said about <HI>E: Fentons</HI> being <HI>Sprinkled,</HI> The other offers to Swear the contrary. See <HI>Mystery</HI> of <HI>Fox Craft</HI> page 15. But that which is published in print begun here and continued by them) will speak for it self tho' it be never so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is rendred in print or otherwise. And how easily might that great falshood of D: L's have passed current among many people; (viz. that he had proved all the charges against us in the <HI>Bomb</HI>) if we had had only a verbal dispute for it; seeing he sticks not, confidently to affirm in the front of this his works; that he hath in this his book so proved them notwithstanding our prints on both sides compar'd makes it obviously appear; that he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o so much as touch'd upon two thirds of them; so that I say, how currant might this fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shood have passed among people and how uncapable should we have been, so undeniably and satisfact∣orily to have detected him if bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and verbal say so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s after a dis∣pute had been all we had had to have disproved him by.</P>

<P><HI>2dly Observe.</HI> These Eight Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use <HI>W Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> in saying. That in page 20 and 21 of <HI>Sandy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundation he denies that Christ
<PB N="3" REF="001277_0006_0FB2041AA5EBDAF0"/>
hath made satisfaction for the Sin of man.</HI> For, first W: P: denied not that Christ ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> satisfaction in a Scriptural sense, which is, that God out of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>te love was so well pleased with what Christ did when he suffered for our Sins as that he accepted of it as a prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions and most satisfactory Sacrifice on our behalf, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Doctrine which W: P: opposed was, that God could not save us but by Christ suffering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wrath and vengeance in the nature of a a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and full payment of a debt for our sins, rendring thereby▪ as if God did not for Christ's sake freely forgive us. And if this be to deny Christ to have made satis∣faction for our sins in any sense, then themselves deny it; for <HI>Dr: Stilling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fleet</HI> then Chaplain in Ordinary to King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, (since Bishop of <HI>Worcester)</HI> preaching in favour of our Principle in this respect plainly saith: <HI>Our Adversaries</HI> (meaning the <HI>Presbyterians managed that Controversy with more zeal than judgment</HI> and saith he; <HI>none need think themselves obliged to main∣tain, that Christ paid a proper and rigid satisfaction for the Sins of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en considered under the notion of debts and that he paid the very same that we ought to have done which</HI> saith he) <HI>in the sense of the Law is never called satisfaction but strict payment.</HI> Note here the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> distinguishes, just as W: P: did, betwixt strict payment and satisfaction. Again (saith he) <HI>Above all things 'tis impossible to reconcile the fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness of remission with full payment.</HI> And again, <HI>It's impossible the same debt should be fully paid and forgiven.</HI> See his dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of Christ's sufferings page 269 270. 272. cited in <HI>Di∣vinity</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> by <HI>Geo: Whitehead</HI> pag 85 86 87.</P>
<P>Now how doth it behove D: L: and his learned A vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chers well to consider how the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> agrees with W: P: In this matter in saying, It's impossible the same deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be fully paid and yet forgiven. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how they as well as W: P: distinguish betwixt satisfaction and str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct payment; opposing the latter, but not the former. So saith W: P: in the same book Not
<PB N="4" REF="001277_0007_0FB214C7931A78F0"/>
(saith he) <Q>that we deny but really confess that Jesus Christ, in life doctrine, and death fulfilled his fathers will, and offered up a most satisfactory Sacrifice; but not to pay God, as being o∣therwise unable to save men. see page 32. More I could men∣tion of their unfair q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otations but my design is brevity.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Observe</HI> That tho' these eight men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty that D: L's quotations exactly agree with our friends book yet they say not a word that they are cited full enough to shew the Authors sense, when compared with the contex and subject matter, as impartial me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would do. To instance one, to render <HI>Geo: Fox,</HI> from <HI>Great Mystery</HI> pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 246, as a contemner of the Holy Scripture, wherein to abuse that good man and entire lover o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Holy Scriptures. They cite him calling it blasphemy <HI>to affirm the Scrip∣ture to be the word of God;</HI> but as his reason is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re rendred, (to witt) because the Scriptures themselves give tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> title to Christ, but G: F: there calls the <HI>Scriptures expressly the Scriptures of Truth, &amp; God's words</HI> [Marktha] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore had G: F: been quoted full enough to have sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn his sense, which in justice they ought to have done (&amp; one line more would have done it) it would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iearl shewn that G: F: was no contemner of the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P N="4">4thly <HI>Observe.</HI> Notwithstanding this, these eight M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n seem to be wise enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o steer so clear as not to testify that D: L's quo∣tations prove all or any of the charges in the <HI>Bomb</HI> as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s title∣page he seems to intimate; no I verily think especially for one of them tho' he hath done too much yet would never be brought to be guilty of so much extravagan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y.</P>

<P>And as D: L: himself does not quote <HI>Richard Hubberthor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to call <HI>Christ</HI> a <HI>Sinner;</HI> so, in one sense, <HI>God</HI> himself is capable of re∣pentance; for he repented that he had made man &amp;c: <HI>Gen:</HI> 6 6. He also repented of the evil he had said he would do unto <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch</HI> and did it not. <HI>Jona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 3 10.</P>
<P>And <HI>Observe</HI> D: L's wrangling here, about the term <HI>[finite]</HI> is grounded upon a mistake about words if his friend G: K: who doubtless knows words as well as himself can have any credit with him for whereas D: L: reckons, that if <HI>Christ as man,</HI> be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nite</HI> then <HI>impotent</HI> G: K: owns the first, but terms the last very unwarrantably, if not blasphemous; so here's D: L's vaunting consequence about it at an end. But observe, this leads me to take notice, that for all G: K: and D: L's great noise of being so found in their appearing aginst us, about the <HI>man Christ</HI> with∣out us, the watch men upon the walls and the like; yet by their writings, when compared, I cannot see whether they own that Christ, as man, is in being, or not; for D: L: in his <HI>Trum∣pet,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001277_0015_0FB214D8D2D0E8E8"/>
page 37, concludes that if <HI>Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> be <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite,</HI> then <HI>Christ as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is come to an End:</HI> but G: K in pa: 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Railing Shi∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> says Christ as man, <HI>is finite,</HI> therefore according to G: K and D: L: compared together Christ as man is come to an End.</P>
<P>Again, in page to of <HI>The Rebuker &amp;c:</HI> D: L: says, It's b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond his capacity to determine whether Christ as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, be finite and impotent. So that again, both being compared, it seems to be beyond his capacity to determine, whether Christ as man, be¦come to an end, or not. Again, in page 38 of his <HI>Trumpet,</HI> he says, W: P: blasphemoussly calls the man Christ the finite and impotent creature. But in the above page 10 he says he dare not call it blasphemous <HI>to say Christ is finite and impotent.</HI> Be∣hold <HI>Reader</HI> how this <HI>Church</HI>-Champion contends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the <HI>Church</HI>-faith. A Monstrous, but just, confusion upon him.</P>
<P>And as for his windy and shameless boast as that he could not bring me to answer the challenge, of leaving the matter to the judgment of four or six indifferent men, to try whether W: P: in <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> called the <HI>man Christ the finite impotent creat∣ure,</HI> as he alledged he did and as I did, and, upon Truth's bottom, still do deny. I say, that he could never bring me to this as he says, is an untrue, shameless and vain boast; he knows I took him up and signified the same in a Letter sent him by a person sent on purpose to his house, as farr as <HI>Egg-harbour</HI> telling him, therein, that I was ready to meet him within ten days from the date thereof; but which day of the ten or whether at <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI> or <HI>Burlington,</HI> I wholly left to himself to appoint; but he answered me in a Letter by the same bearer with most fiivolous, quibbling and evading excuses, <HI>As that he lived not then at</HI> Della∣war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>and that he would have som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ground to believe I meant what I writ to him; and next that he would be secured in person insinuat∣ing we design'd to kidnap him</HI> Now how idle is all this for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he made no such conditions in his challenge, so, had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I as far

to send, as he had to come: and had not I as much ground to suspect, that he meant what he writ, as also that I might be kid∣nap'd; and therefore would be secured in person, as he had to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spect such things of me. But see a further answer to this and his other, as idle, <HI>Almanack</HI> challenge, in <HI>D: L: Justly Rebuked, for abusing W: P: &amp;c:</HI> from page 13 to pa: 17. And it's well it's in print, because notwithstanding what they may now alledge, it will speak for it self without being so subject to misrepresen∣tation, as since by experience we know verbal discourses, with them, are liable to.</P>
<P><HI>Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve,</HI> in his pa. 12. Because D: L: says, I added the word <HI>[Christianity]</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o W: P's words, in pa: 6 of <HI>Quakerism a New Nick∣name &amp;c:</HI> I shall therefore cite the words as they stand in the <HI>Errata.</HI> In the book it's together thus, <Q>The distinction betwixt moral and Christian the making holy life <HI>legal,</HI> and faith in the <HI>history</HI> of Christ's outward manifestation. <HI>Christianity</HI> has been a deadly poyson these latter ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s have been infected with, to the distruction of the godly living &amp;c:</Q> Now I leaving in the word <HI>[Christianity]</HI> as I found it save that I placed the word <HI>[manifestation]</HI> next the word [outward] to make it better sense and saying it was so corrected in the <HI>Errata,</HI> hath made D: L: make this noise about it▪ but whether it be so or not, let the <HI>Reader</HI> judge; for the <HI>Errata</HI> stands thus. <HI>pa: 6. line 32 for Outward Christianity, read Outward manifestotion</HI></P>
<P>Now here we see by the <HI>Errata</HI> the word <HI>[manifestation]</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> placed by W: P: next the word <HI>[outward]</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I said; and it being W: P's method in the same table of <HI>Errata</HI> where he would have a word or words left out, he directed (except where 'twas neces∣sary to put in other words, besides what was in before, in the room of them) still to blot them out; but W: P: gave no direc∣tions to blot out the word <HI>[Christianity]</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' had he there would not have needed any other word than what was in before: there∣fore
<PB N="14" REF="001277_0017_0FB214E0D3817438"/>
it's rational to conclude that as he did not direct so he would not have the word <HI>[Christianity]</HI> blotted out; besides, who is it that knows W: P: that do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not know him to be a man of a better sense, than to esteem it deadly poyson to believe the History of Christ's outward manifestation? especially considering in the very same page W: P: owns, and stands for this to be Christianity, in these express words, (viz.) speaking of Christ's outward appearance, he saith, <Q>A firm belief in him that so ap∣peared <HI>lived, died, role</HI> and <HI>ascended as testified of in the Scriptures of Truth,</HI> [Mark, here say I is the historical know∣ledge owned] but more especially, as he breaks in upon the Soul, by his divine discoveries, as the true light enlightening every man:</Q> This I call <HI>Christianity,</HI> Here we see, W: P: in the very same page, shews plainly, that he is far from calling it a dead∣ly poyson, to believe the Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tory of Christ's outward manifes∣tation: No, it was, as G: W: said, the making faith in the his∣tory, in opposition to his power and work in the soul, and to godly living, which they would have had to be the Christianity necessary. And tho' G: W: and I do not parrot and D: L: like) use just the very same words yet the sense is the same, however, here it appears by his own confession, that I do not coppy exact∣ly after the <HI>London Quakers,</HI> but dare venture further than they have done to my hands, contrary to his most false assertion be∣fore in his last. And now, as I know not that I have any satis∣faction to make on the above account, so I must again call upon him▪ to make satisfaction for saying that W: P: called <HI>faith in Christ's outward manifestation, a deadly poyson</HI></P>
<P>From his page 13. observe, How doth G: F: any more than the Assembly of Divines, say, <HI>God is equal with God</HI> as D: L: talks of? Do not they say.

<P>Again <HI>Observe</HI> Is it not strange, these <HI>Church</HI> people should thus taunt at us about perfection? as D: L: here doth ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing it the <HI>Quakers fond Imagination</HI> of a sinless perfection; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the substance of what we hold in that respect is but according to Scripture, to witt. That all men should so strive, and by the help of God (whose Grace hath appeared to all men attaining to a being <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e free from Sin; become Servants of Righteousness, having fruits of holiness that the end may be everlasting Life.

<P>As for <HI>Josiah Coals</HI> business, it hath been largely answered by me several times which answers he cunningly hides from his reader <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho he rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> again and again.</P>
<P>As for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Battle-Door,</HI> I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in my last, that G: F: was the

Author of what <HI>J: Stubbs</HI> and <HI>B: Furley</HI> set his hand to, for they are G: F's words delivered by himself in <HI>English;</HI> but his fellow-labourers, doubtless being willing people of other tongues should have the benefit of them put them into several other languages; yet they being G: F's words, that they might not (like D: L:) assume to themselves other mens words did still set the Authors name to them: And if D: L: was from this so prodigiously cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣ulous, as to believe that G: F: had the Gift of Tongues &amp;c: as he speaks of: yet I never did so believe; for which reason, I may as well conclude, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> were not made so to believe, as that they were.

<P>From his page 14 <HI>Observe.</HI> As to his taunting and vapouring there about matter or <HI>Governmemt;</HI> I think it no more worth my notice than to referr my <HI>Reader</HI> from pa: 14 to 21 of <HI>Bomb-Search'd,</HI> for right information and satisfaction in this matter. Only, as to the story of his <HI>poor Banks,</HI> where in the same page he says <Q>I pray God to keep them from having power to bite me, as they did poor <HI>Banks,</HI> one of their opposers, whom they catch'd carrying his goods on horses thro' <HI>Pensilvania</HI> and cast into <HI>Philadelphia Prison</HI> and took his goods from him, even his whole estate.</Q> Now observe, that this <HI>poor Banks</HI> was im∣prisoned at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is true; <HI>but that it was for going away with another m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns wife, and goods who lived at</HI> New-York, <HI>and who about that same time sent after her is also true:</HI> For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw her voluntarily down on her knees, asking the <HI>Governour's</HI> pardon

for it; tho' when they were first taken, it being about twelve or one of the Clock of the night, she said she was the said <HI>Banks</HI> his wife but it being otherwise suspected, and closely said to her, she then said he was her husband in the sight of God: but be∣ing that night kept apart and in the morning examined by <HI>Grif∣feth Janes at whose Countrey house they were taken;</HI> she then owned her self to be the said man's wife at <HI>York</HI> and that the said <HI>Banks had perswaded her to go away with him:</HI> But <HI>Banks</HI> being examin∣ed apart from her, he said <HI>she hired him to go with her down to</HI> Mary land. As for the goods, which D.

Now tho' this is that <HI>Banks</HI> the <HI>Ranter,</HI> whose name has long been of such an ill savour among sober people of all perswasions, yet this is D: L's <HI>Banks</HI> on whom the more to deceive) he be∣stows this commis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rating Epithet, of [POOR] <HI>Banks</HI> but which is yet worse and sad to consider, how vainly this D: L: m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes use of the sacred name of God in a pretended Prayer about it, upon this his false insinuating oration against us, in behalf of that old <HI>Ranter</HI> as above. And it's no discredit to us, that either <HI>Banks</HI> or his Comiserator D: L: should be our Opposer, (as he, very unfairly, without distinguishing how says <HI>Banks</HI> is so) for this very thing bespeaks them to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo much according to the <HI>Proverb,</HI> Like to Like, and Brethren in Ini∣quity.</P>

down, I am perswaded must be against his own conscience. And observe, tho' G: F: said they should be cut down by the same power &amp;c: which is that power that pulls down and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as he pleases) yet he did not say it should be by the same means or instruments as the same <HI>Executioner,</HI> the same <HI>Ax</HI> &amp;: as D: L: idly talks of.</P>
<P>From, his pa: 16 <HI>Observe</HI> again, It doth not appear by what D: L: hath there said, thar G: F: could not write the date of the year, for however the date of one of his Letters may now ap∣pear, which may be vitiated lying so long in <HI>Adver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aries</HI> hands; yet it plainly appears by the other Letter (which <HI>J: Talbot</HI> af∣firms several that knew his learning owned to be his) that he both could and did write it; therefore the one could no more shew he could not, than the other shewed that he could and did. But it's worth the <HI>Reader's</HI> notice that they say of that which is unlearnedly writ, they are both avouch'd to be G: F's by them that knew his learning. Just as in one Letter, where they render him to write for <HI>Love [lou]</HI> and <HI>[love]</HI> in the other part of the same Letter, and <HI>[wiff]</HI> for <HI>wife</HI> in one Letter, and <HI>[wife]</HI> in the other; yet all said to be his by them that knew his Learning. To conclude, whatever he hath found in one Letter, conceining it's not being dated well; yet it fol∣lows not, that therefore he could not do it seeing in the other Letter as themselves have published it's manifest, he both could and did do it, which was the most I said of it; and so have no satisfaction to make about it.</P>
<P>From his pa: 16: again <HI>Observe.</HI> Upon my shewing how in his writings he imitated word for word the <HI>Snake</HI> and G: K: he talks, as if he told me but I know not whhre <HI>that he can do no better, than follow the example of good men.</HI> Had he only said other men, those that trace him, may possibly be of the same min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Again <HI>Observe</HI> G: F: doth not say in page 7 of <HI>Sauls Errand.</HI> That <HI>what is not spoken from the mouth of the Lord is Conjuration:</HI> but rather that that which is Conjuration <HI>is the raising a living shing out of the dead and the Spirit out of the Letter &amp;c:</HI> is that which is not from the mouth of the Lord.</P>
<P>Again by my mentioning a late instance of an ill practice done by <HI>a Clergy man</HI> in <HI>Rhoad Island</HI> I never said nor thought of a∣ny now living there; for tho' there was an instance la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in com∣parison of D: L's long ago stories; yet the person was gone from thence some years before I writ: And this I the rather say (since he thus takes it) to clear any that may be now there, from any suspicion about it.

No, but instead of that, or whatever he may have said elsewhere in his pa: 15 16. he says my charging it among other things) as a falshood upon him it returns upon my own head, <HI>and that my charging it as a falshood in him is false in me;</HI> so that he holds his charge against them still, and yet makes no attempt to prove, nor in the least

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o invalidate the proofs I, in my last produced against it. Indeed had we not learned otherwise, than thus palpably and fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly to accuse the Innocent we might justly have been esteemed as Wranglers and false Accusers, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not as Christian Contenders, for the holy Faith, once delivered unto the <HI>Saints.</HI> But alas, now 'tis out, for from my complaining against them for charging, and we say false charging. Innocent persons by name, who, when living, were preachers among us; and that it was not our way to do so by them, says D: L: but by the way, let me tell the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> that the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Quaker Preachers</HI> are under differing cir∣cumstances. But how? Why the substance is, <HI>The</HI> Clergy <HI>know∣ing themselves (and all men) Sinners, pray for Pardon &amp;c: Which the</HI> Quakers <HI>do not, but are too proud, and the like.</HI> Now that, that we do not (for here it hinges) is such a palpable falshood, that I need say no more for proof but to appeal to such as fre∣quent our Meetings of worship.

And this I have in <HI>Satan's Harbinger</HI> shewed him; yet like a hardened person, he goes on, with his notorious false charge, taking no notice of what we justly say in vindication, as well as that we experience frequently in our publick meetings, his charge to be false. It's true, we have not the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> times, or hours to pray in neither do we read the Primitive Christians had any; but who cannot but see, that men may much as be lifted up in a proud concert of their per∣formances of praying for pardon twice a week &amp;c: as the <HI>Phari∣sees</HI> for fasting twice a week? And indeed, how parrallell may this be to those <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who doubtless thought themselves <HI>under different circumstances from other men, for that they fasted twice a week and the like.</HI> Upon my complaining on them, for immodestly accusing innocent persons, as ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve, he calls it, tel∣ling us of our failings; and that there is no other way to humb∣le

us: But I challenge him to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, by one instance, that ever the Lord Justified any as Instruments to humble men, by raising in a vain and light way, false accusations against them. The Lord hath humbled, and hath his own ways to humble us, as he did his Servants of old tho' never j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied his and their Ene∣mies in their false immodest and scoffing attempts to do it. To conclude this, it seems as if it were from a high conceit they have of themselves (I do not mean all of that Society) and of their great humility, that they take such liberty to abuse us; but the Lord who knows our hearts, will one day plead our cause.</P>
<P>In his page 17 <HI>Observe,</HI> If D: L: will not own, that woes be∣long to them that have made drunk the Nations, we cannot help that; but the Lord by his Servant <HI>John</HI> gave such a like lesson concerning them. <HI>Revel:</HI> 17 and 18 chap: And there is no comparison, betwixt telling a body of people, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were of their doing wickedness by consent, and by their publick unrighteous decrees, and framing mischief by Laws. I say, there is no comparison betwixt that, and taunting at a whole Society, for the failings of particular persons among them (for there was such in all ages) much more to abuse them.</P>
<P>From his pa. 18 <HI>Observe,</HI> It justification be in all respects wrought by Christ in his own person wholly without us, and performed but once, as he there says: How is it then that according to the <HI>Apostle, that</HI> Abraham <HI>our father was justified by works?</HI> And that a man is justified by works and not by faith only. And again it's said, <HI>we are justified by faith;</HI> now the faith of a <HI>Christian</HI> hath works and must be shewn by works see <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes</HI> 2. and it worketh by love. But surely, the faith and good works of all Christians, were not performed in Christ's own person at once, and wholly without us. What signifies your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>king such a boast of your ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the <HI>Scripture</HI> more than your
<PB N="22" REF="001277_0025_0FB214F46FD48990"/>
neighbours, when in this and in divers other things, you urge and practise so much that which is not Scriptural?</P>
<P>Again <HI>Observe,</HI> I have hitherto been trying D: L: for his a∣buses to us but am now come, where he tells us he would have us try our w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, to see if we can reconcile <HI>Robert Barclay;</HI> but upon viewing the passage he assigns to try us by, I do confess I presently saw, that were it as hard to reconcile R: B: as it is to reconcile D: L: to honesty, he had then assigned us a very hard task; for according to his too much habituated manner, he most vitiousl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> renders R: B: in page 895 of his Works, and says, <HI>He affirms that the historical faith and knowledge of Christ, is not commonly given to the</HI> Quakers <HI>or to be expected by them or any o∣thers by the Spirit; but the Scriptures.</HI> Now this he hath framed to render R: B: to contradict himself in another place viz: page 43 saying, <HI>the Spirit teacheth every true Christian what is needful for him to know &amp;c:</HI> But R: B's Works speaks for it self thus, <Q>The Historical knowledge of Christ is not commonly manifest∣ed to us, nor to any others, but by the holy Scriptures, as the means &amp;c:</Q> Here we see, first, those words <HI>[by the Spirit]</HI> is D: L's base addition. And 2dly, those words <HI>[as the means]</HI> is as base an omission; for as R: B: s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not, as he renders him so the scope of the Paragraph shews, that he did not in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end by what he writ, that the historical faith and knowledge of Christ was commonly given to men without the Spirit tho' by the Scrip∣ture, as the means; and that's no contradiction; for tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Scriptures be the means or Instrument of which the Lord, by his holy Spirit, makes use to convey us that knowledge; yet it follows not, that therefore it is without the Spirit as D: L cor∣ruptly renders R: B: to say. Our Lord's promise was <HI>that the Spi∣rit should teach us all things. And it was by the Anointing the Saints, afterwards had within the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by which they were taught all things.</HI> Yet it's clear, the Scriptures were commonly the means, by
<PB N="23" REF="001277_0026_0FB214F61303D7F8"/>
which the <HI>Revelation</HI> of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist crucified, was made known▪ as well as otherwise; for the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaking of the Mystery of Christ says it was by the Scripture made known unto all na∣tions for the obedience of the faith, see <HI>John</HI> 14. 26. <HI>John</HI> 2. 27. compared wich <HI>Rom:</HI> 6 26. And this is no contradiction of which their own Doctrine shall be judge; for do not they themselves say, in their <HI>Church Catechism,</HI> that the <HI>Sacrament</HI> is a <HI>[means]</HI> where∣by they receive the inward and Spiritual Grace which they also call a new birth now, a new birth is a regeneration; and tho' they say the <HI>Sacrament</HI> is the <HI>[means]</HI> of this <HI>regeneration,</HI> yet they do not say that this is without the <HI>Sprit:</HI> for they say expresly, at that very time, that they are <HI>regenerate with the Holy Spirit:</HI> So that R: B: honestly cited compared with <HI>Scripture</HI> and their own doctrine, makes D: L's mighty fabrick, being built on his usual foundation of false citations, to tumble down at once.</P>
<P>D: L: in his pa: 13. seems to threaten us with more jobbs of mending work. Indeed at this rate, he may help us to work enough; but untill he mend his own evil work and makes satis∣faction at least by acknowledgment (tho' I have not thought my self oblidged in this to follow him with such particular citat∣ions, as I us'd to do and as is usual in such cases with <HI>Adversaries,</HI> yet) he may expect for the future, to be followed, by me, less particularly than ever.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>Containg a few general <HI>Observations</HI> on the whole.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> I desire the <HI>Reader</HI> to observe, that, as we formerly have, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o we do acknowledge, that there may be found expres∣sions among the multitude of our friends writings (whether by means typographical, shortness in Syntax, shortness of due expla∣nation
<PB N="24" REF="001277_0027_0FB214F883DDDA58"/>
mis-transcription, Correction, or otherwise) that are not well exprest.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Observe.</HI> It's questionable whether the Aushor's works of any Society be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree from some expressions that are not warrantably worded, as delivered us in Print to instance one, (viz.) <HI>Calvin</HI> saying as in pa: 12 of <HI>Bomb Search'd</HI> I mentioned) [<HI>Because Christ is not without us</HI> says he) <HI>but within us]</HI> yet from this we cannot in Charity think that <HI>Calvin</HI> meant any more than that Christ is not only without us.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly, Observe.</HI> That we also in Charity believe, that gene∣rally speaking such Expressions are not an Error of the mind▪ especially, when compared with the rest of their works, which in the judgment of judicious and learned men. (not <HI>Quakers)</HI> ought of right to be allowed to Authors, as in pa: 13 of the above book I shewed.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4ly, Observe,</HI> Our Friends writings for many years were so debar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the liberty of the Press &amp; the Authors often travelling abroad, or in Prison, when their books wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Printing that it may be reasonably supposed the Transcriber Corrector, or Press might be the occasion of many faults in them: And of such like abuses D: L: cannot be Ignorant, having so frequently alledged the fault<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his own books to be typographical, his being absent from the Press &amp;.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5ly,</HI> I shewed in the above book pa: 28 29 30. out of several out of our ancient friends works a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Edward Burrough George Whitehead</HI> and <HI>Robert Barclay &amp;c:</HI> that we do believe <HI>the man Christ to be in Heaven to be without us</HI> as well as that he is within us; And that Christ did <HI>Rise</HI> and <HI>Ascend</HI> in the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>body</HI> in which he <HI>suffered;</HI> and that it is not annihilated tho' changed, and more glorified. As also, that we believe the <HI>Resurrection</HI> and general day of <HI>Judgment</HI> by the <HI>man Christ Jesus,</HI> against their so often accusing us with the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001277_0028_0FB214FBC73C3028"/>
<HI>6ly,</HI> In pa: 35, 36 and 37. are some reasons why we practise not that which they call <HI>Sacraments.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>7ly,</HI> From pa: 39 to 52 I shewed reasons from <HI>Scripturs</HI> and from the Ancient <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Fathers</HI> against the necessity of outward Ordination, Personal Succession restrained and limited Preaching to particular persons, called Priests or Ministers. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> now it tends to limit and quench the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orbad. And in defence of <HI>Womens Preaching.</HI> And against their <HI>Common Prayer.</HI> And against <HI>Plays Sports</HI> and <HI>Pastimes.</HI> And <HI>Pride in Apparel. Respecting of Persons &amp;c:</HI> with much more, being against the mind ot God (as declared in <HI>Scripture)</HI> and famous men. since the reformation, as well as before; but to done of which D: L: hath made any answer.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>8ly, Observe,</HI> In pa: 43. 44. &amp;c: I not only shewed how 'twas contrary to the Antient Protestants, but put them also to prove by <HI>Scripture,</HI> the Unchristian Practice used by their <HI>Ministers</HI>(viz) their forcing tythes and other maintecance, even from those theyesteem no Christians, who never were of them, nor never go to hear them, who for Conscience sake cannot pay tythes. And shewing how for that reason, they have plundered mens goods, casting hundreds into Nasty holes and Prisons till they dyed, <HI>Beatlug. Knocking and Wounding with their own hands, Innocent men and women because for Conscience sake they could not put into their Mouthes.</HI> And this is still continued in some places: We had lately an account, of above 4000 L: taken away in <HI>Eag∣land</HI> on account of <HI>Tythos</HI> and divers still Prisoners on the same account: Ney, in <HI>America</HI> our Friends suffer deeply at this day, because they cannot uphold the said Antichristian Practice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cing peoples goods from them (which they labour hard for, maintain their poor famelies with) without doing them any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing for it, except demand it, <HI>and then often take six times more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they demand, making no returns.</HI> Which cruelty one would

think were full enough of it self, to satisfy any but prejudiced, or such ignorantly devoted persons, that such are not the true successors of Christ, who as they freely received, so they were freely to give; and if upon occasion they partook of the carnal things, it was from them to whom they sowed spiritual things, and that not by force, but as every man purposed in his heart. And so it is amongst us, and not otherwise; <HI>for tho' the Ox that treads out the Corn, may take a mouth full as he goes along; yet it would be accounted most unreasonable that therefore another should be compelled to let such an Ox eat the corn of him for whom he treads not:</HI> Yet after this manner do these men do by us: So that we say, had we nothing else, yet this one thing were enough to prove them not true <HI>Ministers of Christ;</HI> for according to the Maxim, <HI>Whoever is in the Right, the Persecutor is always in the Wrong.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Observe,</HI> We also there declared, that tho' our friends some∣times opposed or refused to express our <HI>faith in Christ &amp;c:</HI> ac∣cording to the too gross and unscriptural concerts, some of our Opposers would have imposed upon us: yet the difference be∣tween us and them from the beginning to this day we never un∣derstood to be for that any professed <HI>faith in Christs outward ap∣pearance at Jerusalem,</HI> his outward <HI>Birth, Miracles,</HI> Dying for our <HI>Sins,</HI> shedding his most precious <HI>Blood</HI> for us, <HI>Rising</HI> for our <HI>Jus∣tification, Ascending</HI> into <HI>Heaven,</HI> continuing to be our <HI>Advocate,</HI> and <HI>Intercessor [the man Christ Jesus]</HI> His coming to judge the <HI>Quick</HI> and the <HI>Dead</HI> at the last and general day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> and <HI>Justifi∣cation</HI> by him alone, without any merit, by or from the best of our own works, but saved by the <HI>Mercy</HI> of <HI>God</HI> thro' the merit of his Dear <HI>Son;</HI> yet so that it must be by the washing of <HI>Rege∣neration,</HI> and the renewing of the <HI>Holy Ghost.

<P N="9"><HI>9ly</HI> Whereas they so much speak despiseably of the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> in all men, as I shewed: I also shewed by Scripture and Citations out of ancient Fathers, that they owned this Light, the Spirit's teaching, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lent waiting as well as we, see page 33, 55, 56. &amp;c:</P>
<P N="10"><HI>10ly Observe,</HI> From pa: 61 to 78 I enumerated 12 particulars, of D. L's false charges against us. Citing our Friends words (to prove them such so large and some of them the whole passages, the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly than before, to make it appear how he hath abused them, acquaint∣ing the <HI>Reader</HI> in the same place, that the books themselves also in which the <HI>Bomb's</HI> four false charges, were (as they still are) to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the house of <HI>Robert Burrough</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where any person might and may soberly see for themselves. But with all the noisy rat∣tle D. L: and the <HI>Bomb,</HI> have there made, to incense people, as if we were undermining the Christian faith, or the like; yet it seems as if it had not occasioned people, hereaway at least, to be under any such ap∣prehension, <HI>for to this day, not above one of any perswasion, have been there to see, if those things they charge out of our friends books, be as they Cite them, or not.</HI> It looks also, as if those persons (especially those few resideng in <HI>Philadelphia)</HI> who promote their works against us, are more willing to take for granted, that those their false Citations are true, than they are to try, whether they are so, or not, seeing they might so easily see for themselves, whether in their Citations; or in our Answers, here remains the falshood. Also in <HI>Satan's Harbinger</HI> in 1704. In <HI>Re∣marks on D: L: Almanacks</HI> 1703, 1704 and 1705. And in <HI>Second part of Bomb Search'd</HI> 1705 I have detected him of abundance more particular falshoods, as well as perversions and abused Citations.</P>
<P N="11"><HI>11ly.</HI> Therefore again <HI>Observe,</HI> he seems in his <HI>Almanack</HI> 1706. at bottom of <HI>April Month,</HI> to be angry at our accusing them for lyars false accusers; and says, this is our only fortification: New wheth∣that that case, it be our only fortification or not, to be sure, when they

so grievously abuse, and publickly to the world belye as, thereby to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, proach us and the way we profess; it is but just that the world should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue be inform'd of it, and that we do more than say, they are Lyars and sale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re Accuses is evident, in that we have offered the very books, which prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them so, to be seen as above, a whole year together, which was more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time given, possibly by 358 dayes for people deliberately to have satisfi∣ed themselves, whether in these men's accusations, or in our answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there ramained the falshood, then by any dispute like meeting, they that could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> probably have had: <HI>And the books were easy to come at, the said it,</HI> Robert Borrow <HI>living openly in the</HI> Front Street, <HI>and a place of great r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>be sort being the very next door to the</HI> Coffey house <HI>and</HI> Post Office.</P>
<P N="12"><HI>12ly. Observfe,</HI> again, since in the main, it's made so evidently appear∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out of our Antient and Late Friends books, that we are sound, as to these things they have so strugled, to render us unsound about, <HI>they seem no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to flag as to our books, and are trying to make people believe, we have it in our</HI> Meanings. often of late saying, when we declare our <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ &amp;c: We mean not a word of what we say.</HI> but as that is horrid and presumtuous, uncharity &amp; falshood, so it can never answer their End, for menkind must believe, they cannot be so omniscious, as to know our meanings; especially, seeing it's contrary to what we constantly express end declare our meanins to be.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly Observe,</HI> That notwithstanding, these books and things as above, lye still at D: L's door unanswered, and almost all untouch'd by him, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order thereto, yet he continues to Cite the same things, as he pleases, taking no due notice, of our just defences; as if all he says were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al∣lible, and <HI>Muggleton</HI>-like, must be believed, because he says it: o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which, as we have not followed him, by citing him here so particulaly as I formerly hinted, I should not, so whether he write again, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, we how think, we may warrantably lay him aside, in the main, as often confuted Adversary</P>
