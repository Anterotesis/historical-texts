<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IDEAS increase and are renewed; error and truth succeed each other, and appear by turns, like the fashions of female dress.</P>
<P>Arts and sciences, like empires and kingdoms, are destined, by Providence, to flourish and decay. There is no science, however useful, sublime, or perfect it may appear, but will admit the po∣lishing hand of improvement; though time too often serves rather to veil, than to display its perfections. Whatever has been disco∣vered, has been discovered by degrees, and, airballoon like, has often been neglected and renewed. Human knowledge preserves its revolution round the truth, as the terrestrial globe does round that luminous body, which cheers us with its rays: but, in the propress of our knowledge, ignorance still attends, and reigns al∣ternately, as darkness after light. It was many centuries ago, when several people knew this science, and, without knowing the cause, produced many effects; which being supposed the work of witchcraft, the performers were put to the torture, in those times of ignorance, and, consequently, the art was lost. I have, myself, been looked upon, by many ignorant people, in <HI>France, En∣gland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as a magician, by putting several ladies and gentlemen into <HI>Somnambulism,</HI> or <HI>Sleepwalking;</HI> and, in that state, have made them <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink, sing,</HI> and <HI>play upon the harpsicord,</HI> by telling an unknown person their diseases, and prescribing for them, &amp;c. All these things appear to them won∣derful, and beyond the power of Nature, or of human art; in∣asmuch as they know not the cause. If you listen to many Doctors and Apothecaries, whose practice, like their understanding, is ve∣ry limited, they will tell you, that "Animal Electricity and Mag∣netism, Sympathy and Antipathy, &amp;c, <HI>is all a cheat;</HI> there is not such a thing in Nature." The former is afraid of losing his Fee, and the latter, the advantage to be derived from his Gallipot.</P>
<P>In my first part I shall give a philosophical idea of the theo∣ry; in my second part I shall explain the different manners of the best practitioners of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> science; particularly that of Dr. <HI>Mesmer,</HI> and those of the Philosophical, Harmonic Society, in <HI>Paris, Lions, Bourdeaux,</HI> and <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> &amp;c. I shall neither give the doc∣trine of those, called the <HI>Illuminated,</HI> at the head of whom is a famous <HI>Hibernian;</HI> nor that, called the <HI>Inspirated,</HI> of whom
<PB N="iv" REF="046381_0003_1021513B316AC5A8"/><HI>Cagliostro</HI> is the apostle and martyr, at <HI>Rome.</HI> I confess intirely ignorant of their <HI>religious farces;</HI> neither do I believe in the agency of Spirits, except that, which guided the great Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> the Spirit of Truth. I shall only give such prin∣ciples as appear to me philosophically reasonable, and on them lay the foundation of that science, in the practice of which I have had a great deal of success; and, by encouraging my pupils to la∣bour in the same extensive field, they may reap the same advan∣tages. It would be too long to recite, those of the Ancients, who have written on this subject; I shall only mention <HI>Flud,</HI> the <HI>Mosaical Philosophy, Tengelinus,</HI> the <HI>Art of curing by Sym∣pathy, Paracelsus,</HI> so much known by his <HI>Alkahestical Tincture,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Digby, Friend, Maxwel, Musgrave, Bacon,</HI> and many more who have treated on that subject. Among the many who have cured by Animal Electricity and Magnetism, or by Touch∣ing, was <HI>Phyrrhus,</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Epirus,</HI> who used to touch his patients with his toe; the Emperor <HI>Vespasian,</HI> who performed many cures by touching. <HI>Edward, the Confessor,</HI> used to touch for the Scrophula, since him called the King's Evil. Se∣veral Kings in Europe have had that gift. <HI>Louis XVI.</HI> when crowned, touched several patients, saying, "The King toucheth thee, God may cure thee." It is since <HI>Philip I. King of France,</HI> that his successors have practised it. <HI>Valentine Greatreak,</HI> from the county of Waterford, so much known, and called, by <HI>Boyle,</HI> "The Stroker," cured many by Touching; particularly the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and several of the first people in <HI>England.</HI> Dr. <HI>Gasner,</HI> at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> in <HI>1774,</HI> made several cures, <HI>Mes∣mer,</HI> and most part of his pupils did the same; and I think it must soon become as familiar to the mind, as the practice of Elec∣tricity, Inoculation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. ON THE LAWS OF MOTION, IN WHICH ARE EXPLAINED, ANIMAL ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM, BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Animal Electricity and Magnetism.</HEAD>
<P>THESE words are used only to show that such a fluid exists in all animated bodies, and acts imperceptably, as in a magnet; for it might also be called, a Vital Fluid, Ele∣mentary, or Innate Fire, Phlogistical, or Universal Fluid.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is now indisputably demonstrated, that all bodies, ex∣isting in space, gravitate towards each other, and attract one another in consequence of their mutual gravitation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bodies can neither gravitate towards each other, nor at∣tract one another, in consequence of their mutual gravitation, unless they are immersed in a medium which transmits, from one to the other, the action to which they yield.</P>
<P N="3">3. That medium is a fluid. A fluid is a body, of which the parts are in motion amongst each other. A solid is a bo∣dy, of which the parts are all at rest.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is, consequently, an universal fluid, which is the medium of the reciprocal actions of bodies, and which distri∣butes, among them, the various motions to which they yield.</P>
<P N="5">5. The universal fluid occupies all space. If it did not, there would be places, in space, in which bodies could not transmit action to one another; and, of course, the order of the Universe would be interrupted.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is, then, a kind of plenum throughout all space: If not absolutely, it is, at least, contiguously full.</P>
<P N="7">7. Bodies, moving in space, have points of introduction, and interstices, to receive and return the universal fluid. If it were otherwise, it would be impossible to conceive their mu∣tual gravitation, and the attraction which is the consequence of it.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="6" REF="046381_0005_1021513F1D4B92A0"/>
8. The mutual gravitation, and attraction of bodies are produced by the currents, which issue from one body, and tend towards another, and so reciprocally.</P>
<P N="9">9. The points of introduction which receive, and those, which return the currents, are called poles and, as all bo∣dies gravitate, and attract one another, of course, all bodies have poles.</P>
<P N="10">10. The more space bodies occupy, the more currents they receive and return, and the greater is the quantity of other bo∣dies which they involve in their motions.</P>
<P N="11">11. The motions and actions of bodies are, of course, in proportion to the space they occupy; therefore, the motions of small bodies are subordinate to the motions of great ones; consequently, the motions of the Moon are subordinate to those of the Earth; and, of course, the motions of the Moon and Earth are subordinate to those of the Sun.</P>
<P N="12">12. Great motions rectify small ones, in the Universe, in the same manner as motions, accidentally excited in a river, are rectified by the general motion of that river. Thus, the motions of men, other animals, and plants, which are moved, and exist on the surface of the Earth, are rectified by the mo∣tions of the Moon and Sun, which the Earth yields to. The reciprocal motions of the Earth and Moon, and the motions of planets, with respect to each other, are rectified by the mo∣tions of the Sun. The motion of our Sun, and of other Suns, which move, like it, in the immense Space, are rectified by the general motion of the Universe, which is the perpetual re∣storer; and, extending an invariable reflux upon the aberrati∣ons of all beings, single and compound, combines them in the most unbounded harmony.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is the nature of all fluids to te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to an equilibrium.</P>
<P N="14">14. If fluids have a tendency to an equilibrium, all move∣ments of gravitation and attraction in the Universe, which are made in consequence of the universal fluid, tend, conse∣quently, to establish an equilibrium among all bodies, which receive and return the fluid.</P>
<P N="15">15. Therefore, all bodies, in the vast Space, exert their ef∣forts to keep up an equilibrium among them.</P>
<P N="16">16. All bodies, in space, yield, therefore, to a power, or motion, which constantly excites them to an equilibrium.</P>
<P N="17">17. Motion, determining bodies to an equilibrium, pro∣duces Magnetism.</P>
<P N="18">18. The effort which bodies make, to establish an equili∣brium, produces Electricity.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="7" REF="046381_0006_10215140C8DF54F0"/>
19. Therefore, Magnetism is, essentially, that equilibrium which takes place, between the inward and outward currents; or, in other words, between the motions to which bodies yield.</P>
<P N="20">20. Electricity is no more than the phenomenon produced between two bodies, one of which has more motion than the other: A phenomenon proving, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the body, which has most motion, communicates it to the other, until an equilibri∣um of motion be established between them.</P>
<P N="21">21. With inequality of motion, there is Electricity; with equality and reciprocity of motion, there is Mag∣netism.</P>
<P N="22">22. It is the purpose of Nature, that Electricity should ex∣ist, only to produce Magnetism: The former ends, where the latter begins.</P>
<P N="23">23. Such being our doctrine, we call universal Magnetism, the general equilibrium of beings, reestablished, every mo∣ment, by the motion last described: That motion, perpetual∣ly restorative, which involves all other motions, and combines them in a general harmony of the whole.</P>
<P N="24">24. We call universal Electricity, the general effort of all beings, or all bodies moving in space, to form one common equilibrium among them.</P>
<P N="25">25. We call particular Magnetism, an equilibrium between two or more bodies, or between all the parts of the same bo∣dy; which takes place in consequence of a particular motion between the Moon and the Earth, produced in consequence of a particular motion, to which the Moon and the Earth yield. There is a particular Magnetism between all bodies, which move or exist on the surface of the Earth, or that of the Moon; produced by the particular motion, which over∣rules those bodies.</P>
<P N="26">26. We call particular Electricity, the effort made by two or more bodies to put themselves, reciprocally, into equilibri∣um, in consequence of a particular motion to which they are liable.</P>
<P N="27">27. I divide, again, both Magnetism and Electricity, into natural and artificial Magnetism and Electricity.</P>
<P N="28">28. Natural Magnetism and Electricity proceed from the reciprocal and natural action of bodies, relatively to them∣selves, in consequence of the natural motions which overrule them.</P>
<P N="29">29. Artificial Magnetism is produced, when proceedings, invented by art, accelerate between bodies, or between the
<PB N="8" REF="046381_0007_10215144DC56B320"/>various parts of the same body, that action of Nature which tends to put, either bodies, or the different parts of the same body into equilibrium.</P>
<P N="30">30. Artificial Electricity is produced, when proceedings, invented by art, increase the inequality of the motion exist∣ing between two or more bodie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as, for example, when they accumulate, in a body, more motion than it would have, if it yielded to the single action of Nature.</P>
<P N="31">31. From what has been said, it is evident, that there ex∣ists, in all bodies, a peculiar quality that renders them sus∣ceptible, both of Electricity and Magnetism.</P>
<P N="32">32. That peculiar quality, found in animated bodies, is called Animal Magnetism, or Animal Electricity.</P>
<P N="33">33. Motion alone produces modification in bodies. Rest is the cessation of all action, and produces no modification.</P>
<P N="34">34. The great motion, in Nature, is that by which all be∣ings are most universally and intimately modified.</P>
<P N="35">35. But the greatest motion, in Nature, is that which, causing bodies to gravitate towards each other, produces, equally, their Electricity and Magnetism.</P>
<P N="36">36. Motion, which produces both Electricity and Mag∣netism in bodies, or, in other words, which makes them use their efforts to bring themselves into an equilibrium; is, con∣sequently, that which more intimately modifies.</P>
<P N="37">37. But every modification, every alteration suffered by a body, necessarily concerns the duration of that body; that is to say, such alteration must, absolutely, tend to expand, to preserve, or destroy it.</P>
<P N="38">38. The motion which produces Electricity and Magnet∣ism is, consequently, that by which Nature preserves, ex∣pands, keeps, and repairs all beings, and makes them go through every period of their time.</P>
<P N="39">39. On such motion, consequently, is founded the law, which universally preserves and restores all beings.</P>
<P N="40">40. Electricity is not properly in Nature, as has been ob∣served before, considering it to be a termination of action; but is understood to be the mean of arriving at that termina∣tion, which is Magnetism.</P>
<P N="41">41. Nature's mode of preserving is by Magnetism; it on∣ly makes use of Electricity to produce Magnetism: or rather, Magnetism belongs to Nature, forming the first of its laws, and Electricity is the accidental effect of the meeting of two or more bodies, that make reciprocal efforts to yield to Mag∣netism.</P>
<P N="42"><PB N="9" REF="046381_0008_1021514748440720"/>
42. Thence it follows, that to increase, by artificial means, the Electricity of a body; to remove it from Magnetism, or, what is the same, to prevent the natural effect of its tendency to an equilibrium with all surrounding bodies; is to act against that law which preserves all beings: Artificial Electricity, in∣sulating bodies in order to concentrate motion in them, is, in consequence, generally dangerous.</P>
<P N="43">43. It follows again, that making use of artificial means to forward the equilibrium of the various parts of the same body among themselves, and the equilibrium of that body with all surrounding bodies; is conformable to the law that preserves all beings: Artificial Magnetism, then, becomes as useful as Nature itself; imitating its general action, or rather de∣termining its general action towards particular bodies, in a more accelerated manner.</P>
<P N="44">44. In few words, Nature gives motion to organized bo∣dies, on purpose that they may return it to others in the same manner as they receive it. It is only by that reciprocal communication of motion, that bodies are united among themselves to form an immense society; and Nature only preserves them by those laws which constitute that physical society: To interrupt such a society, to seperate a being from it, by any proceedings whatever; is, then, generally doing harm.</P>
<P>On the other hand; to render that society more intimate; to establish, in a being, a quicker and easier communicati∣on of motion, either between the several constituent parts, or with the surrounding bodies; is, consequently, doing good.</P>
<P>In the former case the modified being is compressed; in the latter, it is expanded: and a being ceases to live, when its expansion is stopped, and it is no more able to react on other beings, that move with it in the wide Space.</P>
<P N="45">45. Supposing that all beings, moving in space; all bo∣dies, great and small, were suddenly insulated; the Universe would be utterly dissolved: Its life, then, is the communi∣cation of motion; its health or harmony is kept up by an equilibrium of parts: Its death is caused by interruption of communication.</P>
<P N="46">46. We have observed, that the smaller motion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in the Universe, are rectified by the greater, even up to the greatest, considered as a perpetual repairer, which connects and rectifies all motion; and we now add, as a natural consequence of that proposition, that the more extensive motions are, the more regular they are.</P>
<P N="47"><PB N="10" REF="046381_0009_102151491C394010"/>
47. We must consider small motions, such as proceed from the action of beings existing on the Earth's surface, like mo∣tions produced in a river by the rolling of a multitude of peb∣bles: Each pebble produces its motion, contrary to the ge∣neral motion, which seldom agrees with the motion of a neighbouring pebble; but the general motion of the river tends to regulate, among them, all those motions, and cor∣rects their particular aberrations. Thus, the general motion of the stars, or of great bodies which the Earth obeys, tends, continually, to correct the particular aberrations which, like∣wise, continually flow from the bodies moving on its sur∣face.</P>
<P N="48">48. It is, therefore, in the aberrations of particular moti∣ons, that we are to find the real cause of all physical evils to which each being is liable. It is, then, in the general moti∣on, which corrects those aberrations, that the principal restor∣er of all those evils exists.</P>
<P N="49">49. Thence, for all sensible beings, is derived the necessity of watching, and sleeping.</P>
<P N="50">50. In watching, all sensible beings are modified, by the general motion which rules the Earth, and the spontaneous motions produced in themselves, or imparted to them by the small bodies they correspond with. Spontaneous motions are too often contrary to the motion which rules the Earth.</P>
<P N="51">51. In sleep, all sensible beings obey, only, the general motion, just now spoken of. That motion is the beneficent minister of Nature, and is totally employed, in sleep, to re∣pair the errors arisen during the time of watching.</P>
<P N="52">52. It is in sleep, when particular motions are not contra∣ry to the general one, that great expansions, and great repara∣tions take place; with regard to men, animals, plants, and, generally, all sensible beings.</P>
<P N="53">53. Thus, may a genuine idea be formed of what is meant by Artificial Magnetism. It is no more than a theory of pro∣ceedings, invented to subject, in a more particular manner than the usual order of Nature, any being, whatever, to the action of the motion that is the preserver and restorer of all beings.</P>
<P N="54">54. Since it is through Magnetism, alone, that beings are both preserved and restored, it must be desirable to know the laws by which universal Magnetism is practised, and the the∣ory of the proceedings, by the means of which artificial Mag∣netism is produced; as they are the object of the true art of preserving and curing, or the true, universal medecine, the
<PB N="11" REF="046381_0010_1021514C7143C160"/>only one which Nature avows; because it does no more than favour its preserving and restoring action upon disordered or∣ganizations.</P>
<P N="55">55. Next to the physical law, which presides over organi∣zations, exists the moral one, governing our intellectual fa∣culties.</P>
<P N="56">56. Since the Universe is ruled by one single plan and ef∣fect, the Moral Law, in all intelligent beings, ought to agree with the physical one, that rules over all organizations.</P>
<P N="57">57. As the Physical Law, the universal preserver and re∣storer of organized beings, tends, continually, to maintain and restore the equilibrium or physical harmony amongst all organizations; the Moral Law, the universal ruler and restor∣er of all intelligent beings, tends to maintain, continually, and restore, constantly, the equilibrium or moral harmony amongst all intelligent beings.</P>
<P N="58">58. As all organizations, involuntarily, endeavour, reci∣procally, to arrive at a physical equilibrium; so, all intellect∣ual faculties, reciprocally, try to attain the moral equilibrium among themselves.</P>
<P N="59">59. As there is, in all organized beings, a faculty or qua∣lity which inclines them to an equilibrium; so, there exists, in intelligent beings, a faculty which prompts them to aim at a moral equilibrium.</P>
<P N="60">60. The faculty or quality here considered, in intelligent beings, is conscience. From it arises all involuntary motion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which all intelligent beings are either restrained from, or prompted to a moral equilibrium.</P>
<P N="61">61. For new ideas, new words must be formed.</P>
<P N="62">62. I entitle, <HI>Moral, Universal Magnetism,</HI> the moral equi∣librium of all wills, which, continually, tends to establish that moral law which moves all conscience.</P>
<P N="63">63. <HI>Moral, Universal Electricity</HI> is the universal effort, which all conscience exerts, to arrive at the moral, universal equili∣brium.</P>
<P N="64">64. Moral, particular Magnetism is the moral equilibrium between certain intelligent beings, which tends to establish the moral, particular law which rules over their conscience.</P>
<P N="65">65. Moral, particular Electricity is the involuntary effort, made by all conscience of certain beings, to establish, amongst them, an equilibrium of the intelligencies and wills of those beings.</P>
<P N="66">66. There is a moral, particular Magnetism, a moral, par∣ticular Electricity, existing between the individuals composing
<PB N="12" REF="046381_0011_1021514F0F9B8390"/>the same species, the same nation, the same society, and the same sect.</P>
<P N="67">67. As, in the physical world, particular motions are on∣ly salutary, when they agree with the universal motion; so, in the moral world, particular laws are only good, as far as they agree with the moral, universal law.</P>
<P N="68">68. In continuing to display the analogy subsisting between the physical and moral laws, by which the world is governed, one might justly assert, that there is a moral Magnetism in intelligent beings, whenever a harmony and reciprocation, both of affections and habits are found amongst them.</P>
<P N="69">69. Likewise, that there is a moral Electricity between in∣telligent beings, whenever such a harmony and reciprocity are wanting.</P>
<P N="70">70. Moral, artificial Magnetism might be deemed a theory of means, invented to produce, among intelligent beings, a harmony and reciprocation of affections and habits. To that theory belong the political institutions, and the various forms of education adopted by different people, in order to insure the peace and happiness of society.</P>
<P N="71">71. Moral, artificial Electricity might, likewise, be called the guilty effort, exerted by one or more individuals, to avert the affections and habits by which they are united to their equals, and accumulate them on themselves. Thence pro∣ceeds egotism, which is nothing else but a kind of moral insulation.</P>
<P N="72">72. As, if you suppose all bodies, moving in the same space, to be suddenly insulated, thence must, necessarily, fol∣low the dissolution of the physical world; so, likewise, if you imagine all intelligencies, all wills suddenly insulated by egot∣ism, then must, absolutely, ensue the dissolution of the moral world.</P>
<P N="73">73. As it is by the effect of physical, universal Magnetism that all beings are, or ought to become found; it is in conse∣quence of moral, universal Magnetism, or the moral, univer∣sal law which moves all conscience, that all beings are, or become good.</P>
<P N="74">74. To know the law after which physical, universal Mag∣netism is practised, and the theory of the proceedings which can either unfold or increase the energy of that law; is the sole object of the art of preserving and curing, or Medi∣cine: so, likewise, to know the moral, universal law, ac∣cording to which is produced the harmony of intelligent be∣ings, and determine, in all circumstances, the institutions, the
<PB N="13" REF="046381_0012_102151526F59E320"/>customs, and prejudices possessing the power, either to unfold or increase the energy of that law; is the object of the art of ruling and governig, or that of Legislation.</P>
<P N="75">75. Since, as I have observed, the physical and moral laws of the world are so ordained and contrived, that, belonging to a single plan, they terminate in a single effect; whatever, in an organized being, prevents or averts the action of phy∣sical laws, ought to weaken, or render more difficult the ac∣tion of moral laws.</P>
<P N="76">76. Man is both an intelligent and organized being; he is, consequently, governed both by the physical and moral laws to which the world is subject.</P>
<P N="77">77. Man, considered as a physical being, is sound, when nothing intercepts the action of the currents supposed to put him into equilibrium, either with himself, or with other sur∣rounding beings.</P>
<P N="78">78. Man, considered as a moral being, is good, when no∣thing interrupts the affections and habits which prompt him to tend to the moral equilibrium, both with himself, and his equals.</P>
<P N="79">79. Man becomes ill, when, owing to the bad dispositions of his organs, the currents, which ought either to put him in communication and equilibrium with the surrounding beings, or put the several parts of his body in communication and equilibrium one with the other, are intercepted.</P>
<P N="80">80. Man proves wicked, when, through the bad dispositi∣on of his will, the affections and habits which ought to unite him to his equals, and produce in him and about him the mo∣ral equilibrium I have just now spoken of, are interrupted.</P>
<P N="81">81. Pain proceeds from the physical equilibrium being lost in man.</P>
<P N="82">82. Remorse proceeds from the moral equilibrium being destroyed.</P>
<P N="83">83. Pain is the effect of the action of the physical, univer∣sal law, over the obstacles that oppose the physical equilibri∣um which that law would produce.</P>
<P N="84">84. Remorse is the effect of the action of the moral, uni∣versal law, over the obstacles that oppose the moral equili∣brium which that law would produce.</P>
<P N="85">85. Whatever, in man, tends to trouble his moral equili∣brium; passions, habits, such as pride, hatred, fear, revenge, &amp;c. destroys, also, his physical equilibrium, and hurts his health.</P>
<P N="86"><PB N="14" REF="046381_0013_1021515429CBC888"/>
86. Whatever, in man, troubles his physical equilibrium; such as uneasiness, distempers, &amp;c. ends, also, to destroy his moral equilibrium, and prevents the displaying of his good∣ness.</P>
<P N="87">87. When man suffers, he is constrained in the exercise of his moral facultics.</P>
<P N="88">88. When man experiences a wicked affection, he is con∣strained in the exercise of his physical faculties.</P>
<P N="89">89. Soft affections, and such as lead man towards his equals, unfold and make him live: Wicked affections, and such as recall man to himself, constrain him and make him die.</P>
<P N="90">90. It is, then, a physical interest of man to be good, as it is a moral one to be sound.</P>
<P N="91">91. Nothing proves, more peremtorily, the existence of a SUPREME BEING, who governs all things; nothing affords a more sublime notion of his Wisdom; than the deep combination, and the perfect harmony of the physical and moral laws, by which the Universe is ruled.</P>

<P>There are, in Nature, two principles, Matter and Mo∣tion.</P>
<P>The elementary Matter is one; the same which was em∣ployed, by the Creator, for the formation of all beings.</P>
<P>Motion operates upon Matter, and is the unfolding of all possibilities.</P>

<HEAD>General Ideas upon Matter and Motion.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impossible to have an accurate idea of elementary Matter; it lies between the single and compound being. Impenetrability constitutes its essen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>Matter is indifferent to Motion or Rest.</P>
<P>From Matter, in Motion, proceeds fluidity; and, from Matter, in Rest, results solidity.</P>
<P>If two or more contiguous parts of Matter are at rest, from that state results a combination.</P>
<P>Combination is a state relative, from rest, to the motion of Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="046381_0015_1021515BA730FD50"/>
In such relations alone consists the proportion of all possi∣bles, forms, and qualities.</P>
<P>Matter being only liable to different combinations, the no∣tion we have concerning numbers, or arithmetical quantities, may serve to give us an idea of the immensity of the unfold∣ing of possibilities. Considering the various particles of ele∣mentary Matter as so many units, it is easy to conceive, that these units can be combined by 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. and that such combinations may amount to an infinite number.</P>
<P>The several reunions of those unities constitute the first spe∣cies of combination. Then, considering these original com∣binations as new unities, we shall have as many different kinds of unities as there are possible numbers; and we shall still be able to conceive the union of these unities together. If those unions be compounded of unities of the same kind, they constitute the homogeneous Matter: If not, the hetero∣geneous one.</P>
<P>Every one of these new combinations being still liable to be extended, <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> we can easily conceive the immen∣sity of possible combinations.</P>
<P>Matter, strictly speaking, having of itself no quality, is indifferent to any combination; and the properties which it offers are only the result of various combinations.</P>
<P>A quantity of Matter in a state of combination, considered as forming a whole, is what we call a body.</P>
<P>If, in the combination of the constituent parts of a body, there is such an order, that, in consequence of it, there re∣sults new effects or combinations, that whole is an organical body.</P>
<P>A whole, in which such order is not to be seen, is called, an inorganical body; though there is none so.</P>
<P>That order is susceptible of several degrees of perfection, from which spring the different degrees of organizations.</P>
<P>If, in that order there is observed such a perfection, that from it results, not only new effects, but even new combina∣tions of the same kind; that perfection of organization is called Mould.</P>
<P>If we consider the divers parts of Matter, as existing one without the other, we have then the idea of Place.</P>
<P>A number of imaginary points, which are or can be filled up by Matter, determine the idea of Space.</P>
<P>Whenever Matter changes place, and, successively, occupies different points, that change is called Motion.</P>

<HEAD>Motion modifies Matter.</HEAD>
<P>THE first motion is an immediate effect of Creation; it is, of course, the very first cause of all combinations and forms.</P>
<P>That original motion is universally and constantly kept up, by the most slender and loose parts of the matter called Fluid.</P>
<P>In every motion of fluid Matter, three things are to be considered; the Direction, Celerity, and Tone.</P>
<P>A Tone is that kind or mode of determined motion, which the several parts have between them.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of opposite directions; by the one, the parts come near, and by the other, they draw back: Com∣bination is operated by the one; Dissolution, by the other. All possible directions are compounded by those two.</P>
<P>The equality of motion, in those two directions, prevents the different parts from drawing back, or coming near; they are, of course, neither in a state of cohesion, nor in that of dissolution; which constitutes the state of perfect Fluidity.</P>
<P>Combination or cohesion takes place, when the direction of the parts of motion is opposite, or the celerity towards the fame direction is unequal.</P>
<P>The different sorts of motion may be considered, either in the whole body, or in the constituent parts.</P>
<P>The constituent parts of fluid Matter may be combined in all possible manners, and receive every kind of possible moti∣on between them.</P>
<P>All qualities, either of organical or inorganical bodies, de∣pend on the manner according to which the parts are combin∣ed, and the motion of those parts between them.</P>
<P>A quantity of fluid put in motion, in one and the same direction, is called Current.</P>
<P>If we suppose a Current, which, by insinuating itself in a body, is divided into several small currents, very slender, and in the form of a line; those subdivisions are termed, Very small Tubes.</P>
<P>When the elementary matter, either by opposite directions, or unequal celerities, puts itself at rest, and acqures some co∣hesion; intervals or interstices result from the manner accord∣ing to which the several parts are combined.</P>
<P>The interstices of masses remain permeable to the currents or pores of subtile Matter.</P>
<P>Every body, dipt in a fluid, yields to the motion of that fluid; whence it follows, that, if a body be in a current, it
<PB N="18" REF="046381_0017_10215160661C60D0"/>is carried away in its direction; what never befalls a body yielding to many confused directions.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>If a body moves from A to B, and the cause of the moti∣on be in A, it is repulsion; if that cause were in B, it would be an attraction: But if, instead of being in one or the other, this cause is in C, it is an intermediate current in which that body is plunged, and the attraction or repulsion are only apparent.</P>
<P>The cause of the apparent attraction or repulsion lies in the relative direction of the currents coming in and out.</P>
<P>In a space, where Matter admits of no vacuum, there can∣not exist a current coming in, without one going out; and <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Application of the general Ideas or Unfoldings of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>THERE exists, in the Universe, an uniform, determin∣ed, and constant Sum of the primitive Motion imprest on Matter.</P>
<P>That Impulsion should have sufficed to give Matter all pos∣sible directions and progressions of movement.</P>
<P>(A) (B) (A)—(A) (B)—(B)</P>
<P>Every thing being full, and Matter being impenetrable, if A moves towards B, two things are necessary; B must be moved, and A replaced. This proposition accounts for all the gradations and directions of Motion:

<ITEM>8. How, again, an infinity of those grossest molecules have, successively, drawn near the most considerable ones, and stuck to them; which has constituted masses, which are become the spring and origin of all bodies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. And lastly; how, in the modification of those currents, necessarily exists the cause of all possible motions and combin∣ations, which have hitherto been, or are hereafter to be dis∣played.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Therefore, in the infinite number of the combinations of Matter, which divers notions had either ventured or attempted, such as were perfect (because without contradiction of move∣ment) have been preserved; and, by improving, have formed moulds for the propagation of species.</P>
<P>Two particles at rest form an obstacle to the two channels of the currents which lead to them; these two channels, not being in the way to pass directly, join the neigbouring channels, the motion of which they hasten; and that accele∣ration is in proportion to the scarcity and narrowness of in∣terstices.</P>
<P>On the approach of a solid body, the current is accelerat∣ed; and that acceleration is in proportion to the compactibi∣lity, or solidity of the body.</P>
<P>If the channels of a current, going through the interstices of the bodies, meet with no obstacles, they obey their first direction; lose it in the contrary case, and experience the ef∣fect of a confused motion.</P>
<P>The force of currents is in compound proportion to the number of channels in the same direction, and their celerity.</P>
<P>If, between two opposite bodies, the currents, coming out, are predominant over those, coming in, thence results an ap∣parent atraction.</P>
<P>The equilibrium and necessity of pressure require, that a current should not enter into a body, without another, like∣wise, coming out; with this difference alone, that the beams of the current, coming out, are much weaker; because they are dispersed, and divergent.</P>
<P>The nature of universal currents, as well as particular ones, being thus determined, the origin and mass of celestial bodies are explained.</P>
<P>The coarsest molecule, accidentally formed, is become the centre of a particular motion.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="046381_0019_102151676B390870"/>
That current<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as it cacried away the floating, heterogene∣ous matter with which it was surrounded, has enlarged that central body; its current, being accelerated, is become more general, and has seized upon the coarsest matter; that action has been successively extended, and propagated, so far as the distance where it was counterbalanced, by the like action of another central body.</P>
<P>That action having equally taken place, from all parts of the circumference towards the centre, the bodies, necessarily, become spheres.</P>
<P>The difference of their mass has depended on the chance of the first molecule's combination, which has given them more or less consistency.</P>
<P>The difference of their mass answers, exactly, the extent of the space which is betwixt them.</P>
<P>As each Matter has received a motion of rotation, thence results, in each central body, motion on its axi.</P>
<P>Those bodies being excentric, with rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the vortex they are dipt in, move from the centre, until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trific mo∣tion be proportionate to the strength of the current which bears towards the centre.</P>
<P>All celestial bodies have a reciprocal tendency towards one another; that is to say, they meet in the currents which they transmit to one another.</P>
<P>That tendency is in proportion to their mass and distance: That direction is more directly exercised betwixt the points of their surfaces, which are opposite to each other.</P>
<P>Those spherical bodies turn upon their axis', receive the mutual impression on that side, and such impressions constitute a reciprocal and alternate effect, which, in each sphere, is called, Flux and Reflux.</P>
<P>Those actions and relations, explained, constitute the reci∣procal influence between all celestial bodies.</P>
<P>It is manifest, in the most distant bodies, by the reciprocal effects they operate upon each other, they disturb one another in their revolutions, and stop or hasten their motion, in their orbits: Therefore, there is a constant law in Nature, that all bodies have a mutual influence upon each other; and, consequently, that influence exercises itself, both on their constituent parts, and their properties.</P>
<P>That reciprocal influence, and the relations demonstrat∣ed between all coexisting bodies, is what is called, Mag∣netism.</P>

<HEAD>General Ideas on Motion.</HEAD>
<P>MOTION exists in every part of the Universe: All bodies are endowed with a certain degree of motion in proportion to their different organizations.</P>
<P>None are in a perfect state of rest.</P>
<P>It is, however, impossible to imagine how<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We understand here, by Motion, the single deplacing of body: But strength, which is the principle of its motion, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be communicated, propagated; but can never be distroyed.</NOTE> motion de∣stroys itself.</P>
<P>Any round body falls off my table, rolls on my chair, falls on the floor. What happens in consequence of it? Does it stand at rest? No. Its motion meets with an obstacle; it continues, it always exists; or, at least, it loses the motion of acceleration, to preserve only that of it own gravitation. It has comunicated the former to the body which it has touch∣ed, whence it has spread in the matter, and so far divided as to have become insensible.</P>
<P>If there were no animate beings, it would be, perhaps, very easy to calculate the effect of all possible motions: whe∣ther they be those of sublunary bodies, or celestial ones, which all tend to a common centre of gravity: But, animate be∣ings have particular motions, in the adopted system of our days; that system which considers Matter only as dead, or, in other words, passive.</P>
<P>Man is not endowed with the power of discerning the es∣sential attributes of things, and it is only through existence and privation that we conceive any distinct idea of them. It is thus, by the idea of the night, that we conceive any di∣stinct idea of the day; and <HI>vice versa:</HI> For, were we always to perceive the light, that continual perception could not be felt; at least, we could neither be conscious of it, nor able to give it any proper appellation.</P>
<P>Through consequence of this narrowness of our faculties, we are acquainted with Motion, only because we know what Rest is. We have seen some beings moving, and others at rest, whence we have infered, that motion did not always exist.</P>
<P>Suppose that all animated beings which live on the surface of the Earth, should knock with their feet at the same in∣stant; would they not produce an additional motion? a mo∣tion which could not have been foreseen, in the laws which
<PB N="22" REF="046381_0021_1021516B9702B388"/>natural Philosophers have laid down? That motion also tends towards the centre of the Earth. But where does it stop? Where is it to be anihilated?</P>
<P>If animated matter can produce irregular motions, is not the centre, wherein those motions end, to be animated itself; that it may be proportionate to those anomalies, and so restore the equilibrium and force which are the preservers of the world.</P>
<P>I say more; it is not necessary to have any regard to the motion imprest upon animate matter, to conclude that which we look upon as dead; for, even the globe of the Earth is animated: All weigh towards the centre of that globe but the gravitation is, in reality, nothing else but an imprest mo∣tion towards a determinate direction. Or, of two things, one must absolutely follow; either, those motions must be reflect∣ed, with new directions, from the centre of the Earth, or, they must be destroyed. But, if it be true in the art of rea∣soning, the analogy or method of simplifying the principle, as much as possible, is to be considered as the surest way of pro∣ceeding; we shall be authorized to think that Nature modi∣fies, alters, distributes, rather than destroys. Thus, as we acknowledge, in all organized bodies, a faculty which divides, distributes, and returns all those motions, whose impressions they receive, or, rather, which are communicated to them; since we see that those motions are never anihilated; why should we imagine, in Nature, an incomprehensible proceed∣ing; a secret quality, which we are not in want of? Why should we imagine that it does not operate upon spheres, as well as upon individuals?</P>
<P>If the known laws of heaviness, communication of mo∣tion, &amp;c. solely belong to dead matter, and animated mat∣ter can, arbitrarily, act upon it; all animated forces will on∣ly be troublesome ones, and all will be in confusion, in the Universe.</P>
<P>But, if all matter be confidered as animated, then the phe∣nomena of the whole world will not be more extraordinary, than those of the human body; whose best physiologists could not explain, a single moment of existence, if they did not ad∣mit an animated principle, the preserver of it; and which, by laws unknown to us, compensates all irregularities of passions and impressions.</P>
<P>Now, without proceeding any farther in those relations and analogies, the paths through which it would be a difficult task to pursue, let us only observe, that whatever can be consider∣ed as the centre of the action; as performing the function of
<PB N="23" REF="046381_0022_1021516D2D1E6A40"/>receiving, distributing, and sending back the motion; always seems to be productive of a more subtile matter, more elabo∣rate, more unlike dead matter, more near to that which we conceive by animated matter.</P>
<P>Let us, for example, only mention spermatic liquors, and the spirits which seem to come out of them to perfect the hu∣man body, transpiration, emanations, those currents establish∣ed between the beings which lead us to imitation, and make us yield to strange motions; such as desires, passions, fympa∣thies, antipathies, &amp;c. even Animal Electricity and Magnet∣ism; which seem to be the great ocean from which springs out truly the animated matter.</P>
<P>Nature thus leads us to a way of thinking which prevents us from believing, that the interior part of the globe is a grand receptacle of motion, and, consequently, a grand centre of ac∣tivity. Since, in our principles, there are no anihilated mo∣tions, what hinders us from thinking that both Electricity and Magnetism are the produce of that elaboration, the par∣ticular secretions of the globe, the principles of that vast indi∣vidual's life, its correspondence with all the world?</P>
<P>Supposing that general correspondence of motions well esta∣blished, kept up by a subtile matter, more or less animated; should we not, then, more easily explain the duration and equality of celestial motions? For, on one hand, it is a little repugnant to reason, to imagine an absolute vacuum; and, on the other, every matter, however closely it may be kept, im∣plies the idea of a friction, and diminution of motion. Hence we shall find ourselves greatly comforted, by an hypothesis which shall show the very cause of motion in the fluids, which ought to stop it; and the difference would proceed from this principle alone, that, instead of considering the space as filled up with a dead and passive matter, we suppose it constantly traversed by currents, which both keep up and preserve the motion.</P>
<P>The decomposition of different parts of matter, extended through all space, gives room to the unfolding and increasing of that matter; which, being originally endowed with the faculty of receiving, is assimulated in consequence of that pri∣mitive law; the molecules bearing analogy to them; and even Nature, herself, however extensive, is but an immense laboratory, in which all operations succeed one another, with∣out interruption.</P>
<P>Every motion may be communicated to some parts of mat∣ter, and increase that which is proper to them; in conform∣ity,
<PB N="24" REF="046381_0023_1021516FBB80CDA8"/>however, to the law given to it by the particular ar∣rangement of the body which receives it. Thence it fol∣lows, that a motion is never given in the same manner it is received.</P>
<P>Three blows, successively given with a hammer, on a bell, a stone, or a mattrass, will certainly produce three different effects; though the same instrument and the same strength be employed on each of the bodies.</P>
<P>The same solvent, employed to reduce too equal parts of different matter, will produce upon one a considerable effer∣vescence, whilst the division of the other operates with scarce∣ly any appearance of motion; in consequence of the difference that exists in the configuration of their parts.</P>
<P>Therefore, the increasing of motion, communicated by a man to a tree, in order to become a centre of motion to re∣pair his physical aberrations, will be received by the tree, in its way, and returned from the tree to the man, who will al∣so return it in his own manner; on account of the particular properties of their different organs.</P>
<P>Of all the magnetic actions (which, considered attentively, may be looked upon also as belonging to Electricity, not ac∣cidentally, but essentially universal) nothing represents a chain of motion more calm and gentle, and more relative to the re∣paration of the animal economy, than a healthy tree, in sum∣mer time; because, being continually placed in the sphere of activity, which has operated its gradual growth, alimented by the same ground, and formed in the same manner, the gene∣ral currents of the world operate upon it with equal efforts; so that it exists without any seeming perturbation. The ef∣fects produced carry with them a stamp of the same character and crisis by which the discovery of illness is produced; by that mean it seldom extends beyond sleeping; so that the pa∣tients are deprived of their other faculties, only yielding to the repairing action of Nature.</P>
<P>It is easy to conceive, that the action which shall proceed from this tree, being added to that which man is possessed of, will reestablish, in his being, the equilibrium; which is ne∣ver interrupted, but by the decreasing of motion, occasioned by divers aberrations; and which, being attacked in the ori∣gin of their formations, shall be the more easily resolved, and shall oppose less resistance.</P>
<P>After having demonstrated, that from the combination of the different parts of matter proceeds a tone of motion, ana∣logous to the animal economy, it is necessary to show how
<PB N="25" REF="046381_0024_10215173230CC358"/>man is composed; a being so extensive in his primitive pro∣perties, that he seems to have been born, merely to preside over the other beings, which are all submitted to him, who is edowed with the faculty of thinking, judging, &amp;c. and in whom are connected, as in a common centre, all motions of surrounding bodies; who acts again, in his turr, on the same bodies, with more or less energy, in consequence of his will, and the natural tone of his organs.</P>
<P>It is a long time since the law of the strongest has been looked upon as the safest; though it is not always the most just: But it is now time to explain it according to the strict∣ness of the exception.</P>
<P>Man, in a state merely physical, like all other parts of matter, has the motion proper to his organization, subordi∣nate to the general motion which he obeys in the state of his suspensive intellectual faculties. Like them, he unfolds him∣self, increases, declines; and finishes, by being restored to the general mass, in order to be decomposed: But, the sta∣bility of his existence depends on the harmonic parts forming his body, some of which may be vitiated. In that state of illness he sinds himself deprived of a proper portion of facul∣ty, which renders him inferior to man in health; he is not in equal affinity with all that surround him, nor accessable to the same external quantity of animal fluid.</P>
<P>The more he advances, the more his equality of motion di∣minishes; his currents weaken; his humours increase; cohesi∣on is established; want of harmony immediately takes place; and he dies.</P>
<P>If the decrease of motion has produced that havoc, the in∣crease of motion, analogous, communicated in time, might have overcome the first obstacle; and the return of health might have been undoubtedly obtained.</P>
<P>Of all the repairing motions of man, in a state of illness, none seems to be more appropriated, than that which he re∣ceives from his like, in a state of health; because, coming from the focus communicated to him, it takes a proper direc∣tion, with all the analogous character necessary for its ad∣mission.</P>
<P>The motion of man, in a state of health, will be then powerful in consequence of the other's weakness; but, that empire of strength being only employed to eradicate illness, instead of oppressing the individual, that great function of hu∣manity shall be a situation more adapted for society; conse∣quently,
<PB N="26" REF="046381_0025_10215174AE81BB30"/>men must be better by possessing the means to render themselves happy.</P>
<P>In order the better to unfold those proceedings, I must be permitted to employ some comparisons, which perhaps may appear strange, but which will tend to elucidate, physically, those proceedings; by the existence of a doubtless fluid, ridi∣culously denied by many, because they do not see it.</P>
<P>The feruginous matters of the magnetic currents of the world, will acquire a property they had not before, and be∣come Magnets, or Loadstones, by the mere operation of Nature.</P>
<P>In many cases, art can imitate Nature, and even surpass it. (As an authentication) an artificial Magnet is, specifically, more active than a natural one.</P>
<P>Nature, constant in her proceedings, by giving a magnetic virtue to a quantity of iron, does not determine its poles, but in the points which are diametrically opposite, and in the right line.</P>
<P>It is natural to conclude, hence, that Nature has a uniform manner of acting; but, directed by the knowledge of man, she is susceptible of increasing that power, and of concentra∣tion, by her strength in a determined point.</P>
<P>That there exists an invisible fluid, from its action upon iron, is well demonstrated. Is it to be supposed, that the Great and Supreme Architect of the world, in his shining and profound views, would have created the general currents which apparently rule the Universe, only to put in activity a part of Matter, called Iron; to form artificial Magnets, which, in their turn, should be only empowered to instruct us how the tendency and reciprocity of the action of bodies, one towards the other are exercised; as has been demon∣strated?</P>
<P>In that great hypothesis, let us see if the parts of Matter are not formed in such a manner, as to participate of the same advantages.</P>
<P>Of metallic matters, united in a mass in some places, or spread abroad therein, none is so much diffused as iron: Al∣most all bodies, submitted to analogies, furnish a quantity, more or less considerable.</P>
<P>Vegetables contain some also; and it may be established as a principle in animal fluid: A proof of which appears, in a certain quantity of it being extracted from blood. Iron en∣ters into the composition of man, and is combined in such a
<PB N="27" REF="046381_0026_102151768494C678"/>manner, that some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. II—, an Irish lady, in London, did, in 1786. before many ladies and gentlemen, move the needle of the com∣pase, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> approaching her thumb to it. I have seen Miss Eloisa Walke, in Dublin, who had the same power.</NOTE> people have the power of moving the needle of the compass, by only approaching the finger to it.</P>
<P>Thence it is easy to conclude, that the general currents possess the quality of putting iron into action.</P>
<P>Man, by his constitution, will be strongly saturated with that matter, exposed, in a regular manner, to the action of those same currents; and ought to acquire more magnetic faculty, and, consequently, more means to prevail over his like.</P>
<P>In that circumstance, the will of him who gives must be absolute. It is that which more particularly determines the fluid to be directed, with vehemence, towards the extremities, whence it escapes; because, in a motion which tends to make a vacuum, all contiguous parts are forced to accumulate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the place where it operates.</P>
<P>From that principle, a sick man may be in a state of im∣perfection, compared to a steel bar; and is in that state of imperfection, because he has not received the magnetic ope∣ration: And a wholesome man, able to magnetise, resem∣bles an artificial magnet, the harmony being completely un∣folded; because the regularity of its fibres, in which the magnetic effluvia is always accumulating, has determined the action upon it. Consequently, to magnetise a man, or im∣pregnate a piece of steel with a magnetic power, is very near∣ly the same, in communicating the action of the same fluid; received according to the law of the different modifications of two different bodies.</P>
<P>It will happen, for a time, that bodies acting will cease to produce their effects upon the receiving one. That point of time, in the steel bar, is the period of the absolute regularity of its fibres or pores, which shall produce the reciprocal equi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rium; and, in man, is that, when the obstacles are van∣quished by the efforts of the fluid, and, where the parts be∣ing in harmony together, the result is an insensibility to the action.</P>
<P>This circumstance, being more or less distant, partakes of the nature of obstacles in the place they occupy, and accord∣ing to the antiquity of their existence. Two wholesome per∣sons,
<PB N="28" REF="046381_0027_1021517BCDDD7BF8"/>though of a weak constitution, will, by degrees, obtain strength by acting harmonically; because, by regulating their fibres, alternately, they will render them fitter for receiving a greater portion of fluid.</P>
<P>The same phenomenon takes place between two bars, weakly impregnated with a magnetic power. By strength∣ening them, alternately, one by the other, their power is in∣sensibly increased.</P>
<P>There exist many ways of magnetising, which ought all to be subordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to circumstances, to different maladies, to sen∣sations of the patient, and to the reaction of the magnetiser; which I shall explain hereaster. Experience alone can enable us to make a just application of them; and I repeat it, Im∣prudence is very dangerous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would never advise a trial to put people, who are in good health, into a crisis, to please others; for you my put them into a state of catalepsy, and they may never be cured.</NOTE>. In such a case, power united with ignorance may be truly compared to a loaded pistol in the hands of a child.</P>
<P>Action and reaction are commonly more sensible at a cer∣tain distance, than in too near a position; because that reci∣procal sensations are confounded, and have no distinctive cha∣racter, whilst passing through the medium of the surrounding fluid, of which all the molecules are elastic: Those serving as conductors to actions, act again in proportion to the ob∣stacles intended to be overcome.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens, that though the existence of a dis∣ease be evidently demonstrated, by certain, unequivocal signs; yet the action of the universal agent, in its immediate ap∣plication, is insensible to the patient.</P>
<P>In such a case we ought to think, that this fluid impercep∣tibly passes on the local vice; because of the obstacles being too ancient, and, consequently, in a state of too considerable cohesion: That the mass of the fluid molecules, existing be∣tween the patient and the magnetiser, is not strong enough, in proprtion to the resistance of cohesion to be overcome. Then, after having been in communication with the patient, by touching, one directs the extermities of the hands over the parts which are supposed to be affected.</P>
<P>In this situation, with some degree of attention to particu∣lar sensations, one must feel, at the extremities of his fingers, a reaction of heat, or cold, or supineness; which shall give
<PB N="29" REF="046381_0028_1021517D5D952690"/>notice, to the operator, of the effect produced, of the parti∣cular seat of reaction, and distance he must be at, to operate with the greatest effect; by drawing back, as he feels the in∣crease of action, and advancing near the point of the superi∣or effort, when he feels the diminution of the action. This phenomenon is produced, merely because at that distance there exists, between the magnetised and magnetiser, a sufficient co∣lumn of fluid, put into vibration by the combination of the action and the absolute <HI>will</HI> of the magnetiser; which, di∣recting and accumulating all fluid molecules in the same point, determines, in this circumstance, all the patient's sensations. This mode of operating still reunites the advantages of com∣manding, and changing, at pleasure, the centre of activity, when it is peceptible that, by mean of reaction, it may pro∣duce a stronger perturbation; which it is always material to avoid. A comparison will form an ample elucidation, on the diversity of distances.</P>
<P>A gun, loaded with a ball, fired, within twenty yards, at a piece of timber of a certain thickness (this is only an <HI>hypo∣thetical datum,</HI> which is to be considered as a mere relative) shall not, at such a distance, produce the same effect, as at the space of, or within fifty; because the ball shall not have acquired, in the former case, the degree of celerity imprest on it by the resistance of the column of air, which it, as with velocity, passed in the fifty yards: But, besides, after the distance wherein is produced the greatest effort of the ball, whatever it passes over diminishes the more its celerity; and its effects have a certain term, and will, in the end, equal that of the former distance.</P>
<P>From all that has been said, I must conclude, that motion is the principle of the permanent existence of the Universe.</P>
<P>From the combination of many partial motions, the result is a more considerable one.</P>
<P>Animated bodies are particular centres of motion; but some of them, like vegetable ones, are dependant on gene∣ral motions.</P>
<P>That man may, according to his pleasure, contradict, or appropriate to himself those different kinds of motion, to a certain degree: That he may, legally, either increase or de∣crease them in a determined point. That bodies act and react upon each other. That from such an action and reaction, well directed, results the harmony which prolongs their exist∣ence; by restoring the tone to those parts, in which it might
<PB N="30" REF="046381_0029_1021518060884328"/>have suffered some diminution. That the above circumstance is more or less distant, in proportion to the strength employ∣ed, and the resistance of obstacles.</P>
<P>The pupil must not think, from what has been superficial∣ly explained, that it follows, he may, without danger, yield to the practice of this science. That matter is too extensive, not to require a deep discernment, and sound study.</P>
<P>The honest man, actuated with the desire of relieving his fellowcreature, will be sensible, that, previous to his yielding to the impulse of his own heart, he must dedicate some time to observe, with patience, the effects of the fluid which he is possessed of; and still more, the method of tempering its ac∣tion, in difficult occurrences. It is there, that the variety of cases, productive of illness, offer to the attentive eye various means of instruction, and enlightened benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>Animal Electricity and Magnetism DEMONSTRATED. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an universal fluid, which fills all space. Eve∣very body is endowed with a certain quantity of elec∣tric fluid. There exists an attraction or sympathy, and anti∣pathy between animated bodies. The universal currents of the universal fluid, are the cause and existence of bodies. One may accelerate those currents in a body, and produce <HI>Crises</HI> and <HI>Somnambulism;</HI> which is done by acting reciprocal∣ly upon one another, by increasing the currents going across their interstices or pores: in consequence of the <HI>absolute will</HI> of the operator.</P>
<P>As there exists a general, and reciprocal gravitation of all celestial bodies towards each other; so there exists a particu∣lar and reciprocal gravitation of the constituent parts of the Earth towards the whole, and of that whole towards each of its parts.</P>
<P>That reciprocal action of all those bodies is operated by an imperceptible <HI>vapour,</HI> flowing in and out, as you see in a Loadstone, or artincial Magnet, forming an outside atmos∣phere: It also produces currents, in a more or less direct manner, according to the analogy of bodies. That body, which can act most effectuall; on a sickly man, is one, who is in a good state of health, and of a similar constitution. The power of man in a good state of health will then be greater, in consequence of the other's weakness; who re∣ceives more than he gives. It will increase the circulation, and produce beneficial effects.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="046381_0031_10215187F8D7D970"/>
The respective position of two beings, acting on one ano∣ther, is not indifferent. To judge what that position should be, we ought to consider each being as a whole, compounded of different parts; of which each possesses a form, or particu∣lar tonical movement. It is, of course, by that mean easily understood, that two beings have over each other the greatest influence possible, when they are so placed that their analo∣gous parts act, on one another, in the most harmonical man∣ner. It is necessary that the person who submits to be treated is willing, as well as that the operator's mind <HI>must be absolute,</HI> and think of nothing but the different sensations he then seels. <HI>Credite, and V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lete.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, in order that two persons may act on each other in the strongest manner possible, they must be placed opposite each other. From <HI>north</HI> to <HI>south</HI> is the best. You may treat in other directions, according to your <HI>idea</HI> and circumstances. In that opposite position your <HI>atmospheres</HI> are joining; and you may be considered as forming but one whole, acting in an harmonic manner. When man suffers, all the action of life is directed towards him, in order to destroy the cause of suffering; likewise, when two persons are acting on each other, the whole power of that union acts on the disordered parts, with a force proportioned to the increase of the mass. It may, therefore, be in general asserted, that the action of Animal Electricity and Magnetism, &amp;c. increases in proporti∣on to the masses.</P>
<P>It is possible to direct the action of Animal Electricity and Magnetism, &amp;c. more particularly on any individual part, by fixing your <HI>idea,</HI> and directing the fluid upon the part affect∣ed. Our arms may be considered as conductors to the animal fluid, and serve to attract or repel, according to our <HI>will,</HI> and establish a kind of continuity between bodies. It follows, from what has been said on the most advantageous position of two beings, acting on each other in order to maintain the har∣many of the whole; that one ought to touch the right part with the left arm, and the right foot in contact with the left, &amp;c. In that position you are in affinity with your patient; your two <HI>atmospheres</HI> are joined: It shows the opposition of poles in the human body, which are nearly the same as those which may be observed in the Loadstone, or Artificial Mag∣net.</P>
<P>Paracelsus, as well as many other anatomists, have admit∣ted poles in man. Mr. George Adams, in his Treatise on
<PB N="33" REF="046381_0032_1021518992909040"/>Magnetism, justly says, <Q>In some future period it may be discovered, that most bodies are possessed of a polarity, as well as one direction relative to the various affinity of the elements of which they are compounded.</Q> The better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conceive the poles of the human body, we ought to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣der man as divided into two parts, by a line drawn from the top to the <HI>pubis.</HI> All the joints of the left part may be considered as poles, opposite to those corresponding there∣with. The fluid passes out more sensibly, and in greater a∣bundance from the extremities; as those extremities are consi∣dered as poles opposite to the right, and are the best conduct∣ors of the animal fluid.</P>
<P>You may give polarity to animate and inanimate bodies; that is to say, to increase an action to a degree which they had not before, only by a friction, very nearly resembling that which you give to a piece of steel, before it becomes a Magnet; except that it will not be so palpable. You may also change the poles in the human body, pretty nearly the same as you change those of a Magnet. You may also strengthen or increase the action of Animal Electricity and Magnetism, by animate and inanimate bodies, as you increase the action of an artificial Magnet, by adding more Magnets; provided the poles are contrary: Therefore, every thing is filled in the Universe by means of an universal fluid, in which all bodies are immersed; and, consequently, all beings touch one another, in consequence of the continual circulation by which the currents of the magnetic fluid flow out and pass in. In consequence of this, you may affect a person at a distance; provided he be of a weak habit of body, and has been in a <HI>crisis</HI> before you put the column of air into vibration, which exists between the person you treat and yourself: That will affect him, as is seen at a concert in Westminster Abbey, or other places.</P>
<P>In order to be in affinity or harmony with your patients you must touch him by the hand. As there is a circulation which forms itself between you and him, and tends to an equilibrium, it is generally, by that mean, easier to take your patient out of his <HI>crisis.</HI></P>
<P>You next hold up both your hands parallel to the <HI>bead,</HI> and bring them gently down as far as the <HI>pubis:</HI> You may follow the direction of the nerves. Then six you hands upon the <HI>diaphragm</HI> or <HI>stomach,</HI> where lies the greatest abundance of nerves. You may put your thumbs upon the <HI>plexus,</HI> and
<PB N="34" REF="046381_0033_1021518B549B0258"/>put the nerves in motion. You may also six one hand upon the stomach, and draw the other towards you: By that mean you attract, or repel at pleasure. There are various ways of manipulation, which the operator makes use of according to circumstances. If you wish to procure <HI>sleep,</HI> soon change your position; get either to the right or left side of your patient. In that position, you six one of your hands <HI>before</HI> the head, and the other, <HI>behind.</HI> Keep them there, with all your might, till you seel some heat in the palms. If the person is not inclined to sleep, you must charge the head in different direc∣tions, by shutting your hands, as if you were boxing; then you open them quick; and this you repeat often. The per∣son then seels a drowsiness. You must keep your hands in opposition, as before. By those means the animal fluid gets into the absorbent vessels; acts also upon the nerves; which stimulates the body, and produces a <HI>crisis.</HI> If you see the pa∣tient too much agitated, get opposite to him, and bring both your hands downwards, from head to foot, or, as if you were to fan a person; and, getting backwards, it will compose him.</P>
<P>Then you seek for the cause and place of the illness; or, you hold the person's hand, and ask him where he seels pain; as it is increased by treating. If he does not answer your questions properly, it is a sign he is not in a perfect state of <HI>Somnambulism.</HI> You must keep him asleep longer, without speaking to him.</P>
<P>You then seek for the seat of the disease, by extending your hands at a little distance from his body, beginning from head to foot. If your sensations are good, you may, with a little attention, seel within yourself, pains, in the same part in which the patient is affected: Or you may seel, at the ends of your fingers, a heat, if it is an inflamation, or ob∣struction. If you feel a coldness, it is in the lymphatic ves∣sels. If billious, you seel a numbness; and many other ways, which different constitutions seel.</P>
<P>Either of these circumstances will inform you where the disease lies: But, by touching, which is the surest way, you soon become certain of the seat and cause of the disease; which sometimes lies in the side opposite to the pain, particu∣larly in nervous affections, &amp;c.</P>
<P>You may touch, if you like, the cause of the disease, or charge it, as you do the head: by those means you keep up the symptomatical pain, till you have rendered it critical;
<PB N="35" REF="046381_0034_1021518D4E0222C8"/>you second the effort of Nature against the cause of the dis∣ease, and act like a stimulus; which will produce a salutary <HI>crisis,</HI> by putting the whole frame in action; which will re∣move any disease proceeding from obstruction, &amp;c. After this the patient finds himself composed, and the cause of the disorder diminished.</P>
<P>When the patient is asleep, you ask him if it is time to take him out of it. If he answer, Yes; draw your hands towards his head, down to the feet, and rub the eyes with your thumbs several times; and wave your hands, as if fan∣ning a person who is too hot. You get, by degrees, back∣wards, till he is recovered.</P>
<P>The cause of most part of diseases is an <HI>irritability,</HI> or <HI>sever dibility,</HI> or <HI>obstruction.</HI> By the flowness or abolition of moti∣on is produced an <HI>obstruction</HI> or <HI>debility,</HI> and by its accelertion, an <HI>irritability, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation,</HI> and <HI>sever.</HI></P>
<P>The seat of those diseases is generally in the <HI>viscera;</HI> as, the <HI>intestines,</HI> the <HI>spleen,</HI> the <HI>liver,</HI> the <HI>epiploon, mesentery,</HI> the <HI>loins,</HI> &amp;c. In women, the <HI>stomach,</HI> the <HI>womb,</HI> &amp;c. These aberra∣tions or obstructions are an impediment in the circulation of one part, which presses on the blood or lymphatic vessels, and on the nerves; which produces those spasms, because the flu∣id circulates slowly. For that reason, those persons are the soonest affected, and put into a <HI>crisis,</HI> when they are labouring under those maladies. If those vessels press upon the root of a nerve, the motion and sensibility of the corresponding parts are quite suppressed; as in an apoplexy, palsy, &amp;c. There are no better conductors for the animal fluid, than the nerves; as they are spread all over the body. They abound more par∣ticularly in the diaphragm, stomatical and ombelical <HI>plexus;</HI> where lie the roots of the nerves, which extend their branches (as a tree does its branches and roots in the Earth) all over the body.</P>
<P>Many philosophers have thought, that in them the soul lies. It is through them that the <HI>Somnambules</HI> see in the dark, when their eyes are shut. When you treat a person, you must fol∣low, as much as possible, the direction of the nerves. You may treat at a small distance, and fix your hand upon the part affected; and, by motion, you put the column of air (existing between you and the patient) into vibration; which will cause an irritation, and produce a <HI>crisis.</HI></P>
<P>Many professors make use of conductors, either glass, steel, silver, or gold, about eight inches long. They have a good
<PB N="36" REF="046381_0035_10215193CD332680"/>effect in some cases. All this proceeds from the idea of the operator. Mr. Mesmer tells us, <Q>When you make use o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conductors, you must magnetise from right to right;</Q> that is, the poles are changed. I have repeatedly produced the same effect, by treating from left to left; except when I have put a person into sleep, without a conductor. If, while a∣sleep, I magnetised them from right to right, some have gone into a <HI>crisis;</HI> others have awaked. If you touch the forehead with your right hand, you must put your left in opposition behind; and in the same manner to any other part of the bo∣dy; because there is a reaction of fluid, from one pole to the other. like a Magnet. As Dr. Mesmer represents the human body as a Magnet; if you establish the north to the right the left becomes the fourth, and the middle, like the equator which is without predominant action. I repeat it; It is most advantageous to be opposite the person you want to treat, it order to cure him effectually.</P>
<P>Curing consists in reestablishing the disturbed harmony. The general remedy is the application of the animal fluid, which serves to reestablish the equilibrium which is lost in some part of the body.</P>
<P>As there is but one disease, there is but one remedy. If motion is diminished, it ought to be increased: If there is too great irritability, it ought to be decreased. As it is on solid bodies that this fluid operates, particularly on our <HI>viscera,</HI> in order to rectify them; as they are destin∣ed, by Nature, to prepare, to dissolve, and assimulate ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humours; they should be brought to their equilibrium, by any means whatever; either by employing internal or ex∣ternal remedies: But we ought to be very cautious how we administer them, except such as the patients will order for themselves, or prescribe for others; which are generally very simple.</P>
<P>There are few remedies, taken internally, which are good; because, when received into the stomach and the first passages, they experience the same elaboration as our aliments; the parts of which, analogous to our humours, are assimulated there by chylification; and the heterogeneous particles are ex∣pelled by the means of excretions. Those remedies, which may be given, will often prove to have effects contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the intentions of the prescriber; because most of them a very aqueous, stimulate too much, and will increase irritati∣on, spasms, &amp;c. and produce effects discordant to the harm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ny
<PB N="37" REF="046381_0036_102151955C96F070"/>of the parts; which ought to be established, and restor∣ed to their proper equilibrium.</P>
<P>If treating is not sufficient to produce vomiting, in the case of a person who has too much putridity, or abundance of bile which has been too long standing; then a gentle eme∣tic is to be given; or magnesia, if there is too much acid. If alkali is predominant, order a solution of soluble tartar, or other acid which you think will agree with your patient. In case of a violent cholic and costiveness, or sore throat, in∣jections are the best.</P>
<P>These are the general remedies which ought to be admini∣stred to the patients; as I am sure that all those preparations of minerals, &amp;c. which we see in an apothecary's shop, were never intended by Nature for the human body. Modern phy∣sicians have, from an interrested view, neglected the know∣ledge of the vegetable kingdom, more adapted by Providence for the human body.</P>
<P>The diet of the patient is whatever Nature points out to him. She dictates what every man ought to follow; because she seldom deceives us in our manner of living. It is not what we eat, nor the quantity, which does good: It is what we digest.</P>
<P>Animals, by instinct, will never touch any thing, but what Nature has dictated to them. In this, their instinct is far su∣perior to our reason.</P>
<P>Spirituous liquors are forbidden; strong, green tea, with∣out milk; coffee; hot aliments, and the use of snuff; be∣cause it irritates the pituirary membranes in the throat, the stomach, and the head; and will produce crispation, and irri∣tation.</P>
<P>The usual drink may be, water with a bit of toast in it; wine and water, or good, rich wine; old smallbeer; good porter; lemonade, or different syrups: All these may be or∣dered, according to the case of the patient.</P>
<P>The eating may be, good broth, either of beef, mutton, or veal; chicken, boiled; and roasted meat. Avoid any salt or fat meat. Make use of any fallads, good, ripe fruits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Gentle exercise in an open air, either riding or walking; and cold or warm baths are most excellent. The drinking of some mineral waters is good.</P>
<P>In fact, a good observer (though not a phytician) may cure more people than a man of the faculty; because a doctor ne∣ver
<PB N="38" REF="046381_0037_10215197240A3240"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without an apothecary: They all go together, hand in hand, and do more harm than good.</P>
<P>If you have but one patient, and cannot move him out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bed, gather round him as many healthy persons as you can: Make them rub their hands well; then make them hold one another, and communicate to the patient. This is what I call, Forming a chain. By that you communicate to him the animal fluid, which will vivify him, if he is too much debi∣litated. You may seat him upon an insulated stool, as when you electrify a person. You may seat him upon a chair, and make a healthy person sit upon the same chair; back to back. You may magnetise a tree in a garden: You may have one in your room, or a small reservoir. There are various ways, which depend upon the idea of the magnetiser.</P>
<P>There are several ways of treating and curing. For that effect, much attention and prudence is required; and an ho∣nest man, willing to do good to his fellowereatures who la∣bour under any infirmities, will never treat his patients in public, nor make them walk in their sleep, or do many other things. These things may convince many incredulous people of the effects; but cannot do good to the patient. I will say also, that a person cannot treat more than two or three pati∣ents in a day, to do them justice; and those who do treat more, seldom cure by magnetising alone. The patients may fancy they have been cured; but, if they had not been so treated, they might also have been well. As their treatments are long, Nature operates and is a better doctress.</P>
<P>There are some who will firmly assure you, that they have cured people at the distance of two or three hundred miles off, without ever having seen the patients, or putting them into <HI>crises.</HI> I will answer them. They are either fools or mad∣men. Their imaginations being heated with this idea, they are like visionaries.</P>
<P>I knew an ingenious physician, who saw every body with the yellow jaundice; and another, who thought every body had a <HI>virus</HI> in the blood, and treated all his patients, as hav∣ing a <HI>gallicus morbis;</HI> and another, who pretended to cure every body, only by looking at them: All these are some de∣grees of insanity.</P>
<P>I knew several persons, who supposed I had been treating them after I had left their houses. They fell asleep, some twenty miles off; and they have related this, as a fact, to se∣veral of their friends; while I was amusing myself, and ne∣ver
<PB N="39" REF="046381_0038_10215198E80D4BC0"/>thought of them. And suppose I had been treating them, and they, by chance, had fallen asleep, I could not, with pro∣priety, relate the story as a fact; because, to hold good, it must be often repeated.</P>
<P>I never rest my judgement upon a single experiment. In experimental philosophy facts are stubborn, and no one can contradict them when repeated.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Now I shall explain the Manner of treating and curing, ef∣fectually, on reasonable Principles, each Complaint, particu∣larly.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have a patient who has a headach; you seat him in a chair, the back towards the north, or otherwise; you sit opposite to him; you put yourself in affinity with him, as I have before observed; you draw the general cur∣rent, following the direction of the nerves; you hold your hands the same as if you were to hold a pen; and you seek for the cause of the pain, which may be in different parts. Perhaps the patient will tell you, if you cannot find it. If it is a <HI>Hemicrania,</HI> which is owing to the foulness of the sto∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach, you fix your eyes upon your left hand, which you di∣rect towards the stomach with your right hand, and do the same as if you were to turn a pancacke. This you repeat se∣veral times; which stirs the atmosphere, relaxes the stomach, and makes him vomit. You may give a little warm water to promote your operation. You may also treat the head, by drawing the fluid downwards. If the pain has been of long standing, you may order a vomit, or a gentle purge; treat him every day; and afterward order bitters to strengthen the stomach.</P>
<P>There are different headachs; as, the <HI>Cephalagia,</HI> when the head is affected slightly in one part. <HI>Cephaloea</HI> is when the whole head is affected: One side only is called, <HI>Hemicrania;</HI> and a small spot affected is called, <HI>Clavis Histericus.</HI></P>
<P>These various headachs arise from different causes. If it proceeds from obstructions, a <HI>Crisis</HI> is very salutary; as it puts the whole body into motion, and will remove the cause.</P>
<P>Treating the part which you think affected is very necessary. You do this with one hand or both, by drawing your hands towards you several times, as before. To treat the head, you may apply your hands upon the temples, and put your thumbs upon the frontal <HI>Sinus;</HI> which will often remove it.</P>

<HEAD>DEAFNESS.</HEAD>
<P>IF the want of hearing proceed from a fault in the struc∣ture of the ear, there is no cure. If it proceed from cold, sever, hard wax, or dryness, you may magnetise ac∣cording to my principles. You keep yourself within a yard or two, according as you feel a reaction. <HI>[Vide the first part.]</HI> You then fix you left hand toward the ear, and move your right, open, and bring it towards the left hand; and do the same as if you were to clap your hands. By that mean you put the air into vibration; and, guided by your left hand as a conductor, you apply the palm of the hand upon the ear; or you may put your thumb in the ear, and, with your other finger, as you hold a pinch of snuff, press the thumb toward the ear; by which you accelerate the fluid into it. You may make use of a conductor, either glass or artificial magnet, and put it into the ear, and press, with two fingers, from the basis towards the ear. You may magnetise the head, by drawing the fluid towards you.</P>
<P>All these means you are to make use of, according to your sensations and judgment.</P>
<P>Sometimes an injection, made of Castile soap, warm bran∣dy and water, will assist your operation.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Toothach.</HEAD>
<P>THIS violent, though not dangerous disease proceeds from <HI>rheumatism, obstructed perspiration, inflamation,</HI> &amp;c. This being the case, you treat according to my rules.

<HEAD>Diseases of the Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing so difficult, as to cure those diseases; and none of our organs is more subject to be affected, than the sight, or from so many causes. When they proceed
<PB N="41" REF="046381_0040_1021519FCAED16B0"/>from obstructions in the customary evacuations, you must magnetise according to my rules. You treat the cause, also the eyes, by fixing your thumbs opposite; with the index you press the sluid into the eyes; you move your thumb opposite to you, and may rub the eyes gently; and drop magnetised water into them with a quill. This you do three or four times a day; and order a little lemonade or syrup to your patient.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gutta S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rena, Opthalmia, Cataract, Specks on the Eyes,</HI> and <HI>Fistula Lacrymalis,</HI> are very difficult and almost incurable.</P>
<P>I have heard many magnetisers boasting of the cures they had made of these diseases. I have had more practice, in that way, than many of them; and confess, candidly, I have made but few.</P>
<P>I shall explain the best manner of treating. You must first know the cause which you treat; afterwards, applying your thumbs gently on the eyes, you rub them often. You then fix your thumb, with the next finger, at a distance from the eye. But I have bad success, in some cases of this kind, by making use of an artificial Magnet, fixing it at the distance of half an inch from the eye: It has, by that mean, remov∣ed <HI>Spots,</HI> and <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> proceeding from the compression of the nerves by superfluous humours. I have dropped mag∣netised water, three or four times a day, with success.</P>
<P>A proper regimen is necessary, and some internal and ex∣ternal applications.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Epilepsy and hysterical Affections.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE diseases are the <HI>opprebriam</HI> of the faculty, with many others; as they cannot be cured by internal me∣dicines, except when proceeding from obstructions, worms, or affection of the mind, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In those cases you treat according to the rules; then you touch the head on the top. Applying your thumb on the root of the nose, you endeavour to dissolve the obstructions which may be the cause. Apply your hand upon the <HI>Dia∣phragm,</HI> and endeavour to put the nerves in motion. You may treat at a distance also; but try to produce a <HI>Crisis.</HI></P>
<P>Drs. <HI>Andrey,</HI> and <HI>Towret,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> have cured several epi∣leptics by applying artificial Magnets round the head; or, like a horseshoe, applied upon the top of the head. When they are in a sit, apply a Magnet in each hand; which will
<PB N="42" REF="046381_0041_102151A52160A1C8"/>soon recover them. I have brought some to, by applying a key in their hands. They are very good in <HI>spasms, faintings,</HI> and <HI>cramps;</HI> which cease instantly upon applying a magnet to the soals of the feet.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Scrophula, called the King's Evil.</HEAD>
<P>THIS disease is a disgrace to physic. Some persons have had the gift of curing by <HI>touching.</HI> I have seen, in London, two persons who had been touched by a man, after he was hanged. They were relieved; but I really believe it was the force of imagination. Being frightened, by the dead man, made such a revolution in the blood, that it removed the obstruction in the glands. You may touch your patient in those parts, and draw the effluvia, in order to resolve the glands.</P>
<P>If there be an ulcer, order the patient to bathe the part with magnetised water, and keep a bit of rag upon it.</P>
<P>Seabathing, decoction of celery and hemloc juice may be tried, besides treating.</P>
<P><HI>Sore throat,</HI> or any <HI>inflamation,</HI> is to be treated by draw∣ing the fluid out of the part; either by putting yourself in opposition, or by standing on one side, and putting one hand behind the neck, and the other before.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Palsy.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the palsy happens to an old person, or has been of long standing, it is seldom cured; but, if it happen to a middling age, and one side only be struck, called an <HI>Hemiplegia,</HI> a cure will be effected, by being treated soon after. You may magnetise your patient opposite, as usual. After you turn the side affected towards the north, you treat the opposite side; in which the cause is supposed to lie. You may touch with one ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> along the backbone, or within an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch of it, along the great <HI>Intercostal,</HI> by applying your right hand upon the stomach. You treat him about two hours. If you can put him into a <HI>Crisis,</HI> which is very easy you may ex∣pect to cure him.</P>
<P>You make him lift up his bad arm, or have somebody to support it. You put a conductor into his hand, to attract the universal fluid. You may insulate him, and turn the part affected towards the north. Tie a silk string to the ceiling;
<PB N="43" REF="046381_0042_102151A6D56806B8"/>at the end of it have a strong, compounded Magnet; the north pole parallel to the hand. To the other hand tie, like∣wise, another string; at the end of which place a large piece of iron, whose surface is larger than the Magnet. Have an electrical machine; connect the chain to the patient; and make him stretch his arms. Then touch the Magnet and the piece of iron together, or one after another to the extremities of the hands: It will cure him. I have cured a number that way.</P>
<P>"But (say many) this does not belong to Animal Mag∣netism." Has not a magnetiser a right to cure his patients as soon as possible; and to employ every mean his mind suggests to him? It is not so among the faculty: They must cure or kill, <HI>secundam artem,</HI> according to art.</P>
<P>A general vomit or purge is often necessary. The diet must be good.</P>
<P>If the tongue is affected, put a conductor upon it or an artificial Magnet, such as you make use of for the teeth; and press the fluid, from the basis towards the point, on the tongue.</P>
<P>Sometimes a little gargarism is useful. Electricity, and the cold bath are very good.</P>

<HEAD>RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more common, in this country, than that disease, on account of the dampness and changeablenes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the weather; which absorbs and prevents the electric and magnetic fluid from flying off of particular parts, especially the feet; whence there flies out a greater a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undance of fluid, than from any other part of the body. It is for that reason dogs will follow our tracks.</P>
<P>There are very obstinate <HI>rhuematisms,</HI> which proceed from different causes, and are difficult to cure. The method of curing this disease, is magnetising the patient in opposition. Try to promote perspiration, by putting him into a <HI>Crisis.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>rbuematism</HI> be in a particular part of the body, you must treat the part affected; either by touching, or rubbing, which is the best. You may use an artificial Magnet, in the form of a horseshoe.</P>
<P>If the <HI>rhuematism</HI> be in the <HI>head,</HI> you apply it upon the top of it. If it be in the <HI>face</HI> and <HI>teeth,</HI> apply it on the <HI>tem∣ples.</HI> If it be in the <HI>hip,</HI> apply it above the <HI>knee,</HI> with the

<HEAD>Consumption or Decay.</HEAD>
<P>THIS disease, so common in <HI>America,</HI> is difficult to cure.

<HEAD>Diseases in the Stomach,</HEAD>
<P>SO common among women in this country, proceed from that pernicious custom of wearing stays: Not only that, but they must have a piece of wood, two or three inches broad, and proportionably thick in them, called a busk; which occasions so many diseases.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of nervous Diseases.</HEAD>
<P>IT is in those diseases that Magnetism acts more forcibly. By putting the whole nervous system in motion, it ope∣rates <HI>Crises,</HI> as well as <HI>Somnambulism,</HI> and offers to the atten∣tive eye a vest field of observation.</P>
<P>There is as great a variety in those diseases, as there are combinations between all possible numbers. Different organs may be affected, and distinctly from others.</P>
<P>In some persons the extension of sight is so great, that it seems as if they made use of a Microscope. Some of them cas se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in the dark, the Animal Fluid flying in all directi∣ons;
<PB N="46" REF="046381_0045_102151ADA2603B60"/>which appears luminous: To others the skin appears like a sieve, and they see the gross humours, or perspiration as large as small shot; and by rubbing the hands they see sparkles of fire coming out.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle mentions a person, who, after getting half sud∣dled with claret (which I suppose relaxed the stomach, and his nervous system) when he walked in the night, could see to read moderate print: Another, who could, in the night, distinguish colours.</P>
<P>Grimaldi tells us, that, <Q>Some women can, by their eyes alone, distinguish between eggs laid by black hens, and those, by white ones.</Q> This single fact will lead to many things, which I shall relate about <HI>Somnambules.</HI></P>
<P>We must not attribute to <HI>whin,</HI> all the singularities which <HI>we</HI> observe among people affected in the nerves: They pro∣ceed from as real a cause, as that which determines the most reasonable man.</P>
<P>I knew a gentleman, in London, who shook his head and arm every inslant, like a perpetual motion. A lady, whom I treated, when in his company, had the same involuntary af∣fection. A gentleman, in Cork, when in company, would often pronounce <HI>Peter;</HI> and the same word during a week; Then he would pronounce a <HI>bad one,</HI> during another week; and could not help it.</P>
<P>There are different methods of treating those diseases; ei∣ther with or without <HI>Crises.</HI> Such people are the best <HI>Som∣nambules.</HI> If a person is irritable, you treat gently, in oppo∣sition, by drawing a certain quantity of fluid from him: If, on the contrary, you throw the fluid towards him, you may put him into a gentle <HI>Crisis.</HI> If the patient has a trembling of the limbs, like the head, you treat that part. If you cannot succeed by treating, apply a <HI>magnetic bandean</HI> round the head: It will stop it instantly. For trembling of the hands, apply <HI>magnetic bracelets.</HI></P>
<P>To magnetise, or treat a person at a distance is not impossi∣ble. The manners which several professors make use of are different. There are quacks in that art, who pretend to have sound it out before Dr. <HI>Mesmer;</HI> but, that none of them dreampt of it, is well known.</P>
<P>The faculty of our <HI>soul, thought,</HI> or <HI>idea</HI> can perceive, con∣template, and unite itself to any object, present, distant, vi∣sible, or invisible. That it has action upon matter, is well demonstrated. It acts immediately upon the vivifying elec∣tric
<PB N="47" REF="046381_0046_1021417631D2D648"/>and magnetic fluid; and, by its <HI>will,</HI> determines it to be directed upon such and such parts. We know that our souls act upon our bodies, and force any part of them to move in any direction, according to our <HI>wills.</HI> This being the case, we may reasonably believe, that they may act as well upon merely organical Matter, as upon animated Bodies.</P>
<P>The <HI>thought</HI> or <HI>soul</HI> goes to any distance. No obstacles can resist it. It arrives and unites itself, by a sympathetic power, to any object it wishes, without a master of ceremo∣nies. Neither the size of the body, its strength, or figure impede: All give way; and the union is made in an instant. The <HI>will,</HI> and the <HI>will only</HI> is the cause of it; because it di∣rects the fluid towards the diseases, and affected <HI>visc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> by fixing them in your imagination as much is possible; and, by that mean, it will force the magnetic fluid to touch and to penetreat, to a great distance, any bodies to which the soul is willing to unite herself, and to reestablish the animal eco∣nomy; of which she is the indistructible principle.</P>
<P>These reflections how the possibility, and the mean made use of, to treat a person at a distance; of which experience will prove the reality: And an ingenious mind may make many curious experiments and, by repeated trials, receive full conviction.</P>
<P>To treat a person at a dista<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, from one house to another, is possible; provided you have seen the person before, and put him in a <HI>Crisis.</HI> You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o this in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI> Know where the person is, fix the hour by your watch, and have some friends with him, to divert him. You must be alone, in a room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o avoid any noise, or any thing that might distract the attention of your mind. In that position, you paint the person in your imagination: you represent, in your idea, the part which you suppose affected; and you treat is the same manner, as if the patient were before you. That sympathy of body and mind, which exists between you and him, will produce a <HI>Crisis</HI> and <HI>Somnambulism.</HI> This pheno∣menon is very interesting.</P>
<P>You may also, from the same principles, treat a person, in the same room, without his or her knowledge; by fix∣ing your mind and your eyes upon the part affected, or upon the heart, stomach, &amp;c. and produce <HI>Crise,</HI> and <HI>Som∣nambulism.</HI></P>

You treat the patient in opposition; you fix your hands upon the part, either at a distance, or by applying them upon the belly; and you try to produce a <HI>Crisis,</HI> which is the quickest way. You may apply a mag∣netised bellglass on the belly, when the patient is in bed; the same on the legs, if they are swelled; and various accessaries, according to your fancy.</P>
<P>Dropsies of the brain, of the breast, and of the legs are treated by extracting the fluid, and promoting circulation and perspiration.</P>

<P>If it comes from obstructions, treat the lungs, and put the patient into <HI>Crises,</HI> to promote circulation: But, if the asthma proceeds from another cause; as, violent passions of the mind, or is humoral or nervous, and the patient spit a great deal; treat the stomach upwards, to promote expectoration. If the patient cough much at night, give him a glass of magnetised water, going to bed, and another in the morning. Moderate exercise, in a gentle air, is very useful.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>APOPLEXY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS sudden loss of the senses may be cured by applying immediately, and with proper care. The cause is, an effusion of the blood, or a collection of watry humours. There are two sorts, a <HI>sanguine</HI> and <HI>ser us apoplexy.</HI> It is generally towards the brain that the cause lies; because the blood does not return from the head.</P>
<P>That being the case, you magnetise the patient, either in bed or up. If he be in bed, you stay at his feet, and mag∣netise
<PB N="49" REF="046381_0048_102151B1960D85E8"/>the head downwards. You may get at the right side, and magnetise as before. You touch his head, one hand be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind and the other before, bringing them downwards. You must raise his head high.</P>
<P>If it be a <HI>sanguine apoplexy,</HI> and you see no change, you may order bleeding, or put the feet in warm flannel. Let the patient have free air, and treat him four hours a day.</P>

<P>THIS disagreeable disease puts the patient into the great∣est torture during his sleep. He often feels a weight upon his stomach, like a man, cats, or dogs, &amp;c.

<P>I have attended a patient, who used <HI>bleeding</HI> every year, in <HI>May.</HI> During <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> he was always so: but as soon as he was bled, the pain left him. They are a kind of <HI>Somnambules.</HI></P>
<P>You treat the stomach, by throwing a qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty of fluid, in order to strengthen it: Also, treat the head downwards. A glass of magnetised water, going to bed, is very good.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Sensations, considered as a sixth Sense.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are as many sensations, as there are possible dif∣ferences between proportions.</P>
<P>In all sensations we must consider three things: The cause producing the impression; the nature and disposition of the organs receiving it; and the sensations which have preceded it. It is by the combination of those affinities, that the or∣gans of our senses may be magnefied or increased to such a degree, as to become, for every object which they present to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, what telescopes and microscopes are to the sight; conse∣quently, our sensations are the result of all the effects which objects make on our organs.</P>
<P>Our senses can only draw us more or less near to the know∣ledge of objects, and their nature, by a constant use and seri∣ous application, in order to attain to their reality.</P>
<P>We have a great number of small organs, proper to receive sensations; but the habi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are in of using some particula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> organs only, absorb the rest. Blind people have different
<PB N="50" REF="046381_0049_102151B780235EB0"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tions from us: They will perceive a wall, or other bo∣dy, before they touch it. There is no doubt but we are en∣dowed with an internal sense, which is in affinity with the Universe, and is considered as an extension of sight. It is by those means one may comprehend the possibility of finding the disease of another; of <HI>foresights, predictions,</HI> and the phe∣nomenon of <HI>Somnambules,</HI> and <HI>Sybils,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As it is possible to be affected in such a manner, as to have the idea of a body at an immense distance, in the same man∣ner as we see the stars; the impression of which is transmitted to us in a right line; the succession and continuity of a coex∣isting matter between them and our organs, bounded by the nature of their form: Why should it not be possible, by the mean of an inward organ, by which we are in contact with the whole Universe, for us to be affected by beings, the successive motion of which is propagated to us in curve or oblique lines, in any direction? And why should we not be affected by the connection of beings which succeed one another?</P>
<P>I was acquainted with Monsieur de <HI>Botinan,</HI> who had a place under government in the island of <HI>St. Helena.</HI> During twenty years he made a particular study of a sense unknown to us. He could perceive a fleet, or a single ship, two or three hundred miles off. Last war he described M. de <HI>Suf∣frein</HI>'s fleet; the number of ships; and those which had pass∣ed by, and did not touch at the island. He could do more. At sea, he could tell the distance he was off land; which has been proved, by repeated experiments in the <HI>Channel.</HI> I can∣not say, this is certain; but I have seen the <HI>Certificates,</HI> grant∣ed him by the governor and principal people of the island; and the petition and recommendation to the Minister, who granted him eighteen hundred livres, per annum.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Bleton,</HI> called the <HI>Sourcier,</HI> or <HI>Spring finder,</HI> whenever he walked upon ground where there was a vein of water, felt, within himself, a certain sensation which gave him notice thereof.

<HEAD>Of the Crises.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Crises</HI> are an effort of Nature against the disorder, endeavouring to dissipate the obstacles which are in the circulation, and to restore harmony or equilibrium to all parts of the body. Few diseases can be cured without a <HI>Crisis,</HI> par∣ticularly when they proceed from obstructions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of <HI>Crises.</HI> The <HI>natural,</HI> which is at∣tributed to Nature alone, gets rid of what offends her, by an increase of movement, producing <HI>vomitting, motion, perspira∣tion,</HI> &amp;c. These are the most salutary, as Nature acts silent∣ly, without violence, and expels the obstacles which impede circulation; by moving gently the <HI>molecules</HI> which form those impediments, and go off by perspiration, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>forced,</HI> is sometimes salutary in <HI>obstructions, windy,</HI> and <HI>bilious complaints.</HI> These are produced, when Nature is insuf∣ficient to expel what offends her. The use of Animal Elec∣tricity and Magnetism puts the whole body in action, and, in conjunction with her, acts efficiously on the patient, who receives benefit and ease; particularly if it has produced eva∣cuations, &amp;c. There are various means of producing them, according to the subject, and the cause of his disease. Some say there are six degrees of <HI>Crises.</HI> I say there are as many, as there are different constitutions to treat. Some, will also call it <HI>luminous Crisis,</HI> from that new sect called the <HI>Illuminated.</HI> All these are imaginary.</P>
<P>Suppose you have a patient on whom you would wish to produce a gentle <HI>Crisis;</HI> you must put yourself in affinity; then put one hand behind the head, and the other before, till the person is asleep. If he be agitated, calm him, by drawing the fluid downwards from the head. If you treat the cause by touching, it will increase the pain. If you put your thumb upon the <HI>frontal sinus,</HI> he will fall into a <HI>Crisis.</HI> You may magnetise your watch, and show him the time of day, he will go into it. Magnetise a flower, and give him a smell, he will fall in. Magnetise a harpsicord, as soon as you play on it he will go in. Magnetise a person between you and the patient, which will put him in. Magnetise a pond, make the patient stand on the side opposite to you, and hold a stick in his hand to touch the water; you must also touch the water with your magnetised conductor: the person will go into a <HI>Crisis</HI> immediately. Have somebody behind him, to
<PB N="52" REF="046381_0051_102151BC027FFFD8"/>prevent his falling into the water: it is the best conductor of animal fluid. Make a person read, be behind him, and magnetise the lines as he reads, he will go in. Place the pa∣tient behind you, opposite a lookingglass, that you may see him, and magnetise, with a conductor, the figure in the glass. The reaction of the fluid will produce a <HI>Crisis.</HI> Magnetise a tree in a walk, as soon as the patient comes near it, he will fall into a <HI>Crisis.</HI> A person may be put in a <HI>Crisis,</HI> through a door, from one room to another; and in fact, an ingenious observer may, by what I have related, make a great many curious expe∣riments; provided he has <HI>proper subjects.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Somnambulism.</HEAD>
<P>IN my little essay on <HI>Somnambulism,</HI> I have said, that it was a state between sleeping and waking, partaking of both. The patient is a <HI>Somnambule,</HI> when he can do the same as if he were awake. These natural <HI>Somnambules,</HI> who get up at night, and do many wonderful things, are well demonstrated. They are diseases, and may be cured by treating. The <HI>magnetic Som∣nambules,</HI> are those, whom art has found out a mean of obsor∣bing or suspending some of the external senses of for a while; and the patient eats, and drinks; goes up and down; plays upon the harpsicord; and does many things which you desire him; provided he be willing. The first I saw was at the Mar∣quis de <HI>Puysegur</HI>'s, in the year 1784: and all those who pre∣tended to it, in this country before, were impostors, and none of them had yet dreamt of it; and for all this, we are indebt∣ed to Dr. <HI>Mesmer.</HI> Whenever any person has a real <HI>Somnambule,</HI> which is very easy, by care he has a treasure. They are call∣ed by us, <HI>Malades Medecins;</HI> or sick Physicians. These beings see in the dark, and go through an external atmosphere, the same as a glow worm. They have, besides, an internal atmos∣phere, which they make use of to perceive objects present, dis∣tant, visible, and invisible. I have had several who related to me, what they could perceive. All of them differ, in ma∣ny respects, according to their constitutions. One must not always depend upon what they say, on account of their differ∣ing sometimes. You may make them move in any direction, <HI>by your will</HI> alone; or by moving your conductor any way up∣on the floor, they will follow its directions. You may make them play on any instrument they can; they will read, write,
<PB N="53" REF="046381_0052_102151BE194EA340"/>and work: all these they will do better than if awake. Being deprived of their other faculties, they become stronger. No physician can tell the disease of a person better than a real <HI>Som∣nambule.</HI> They seldom fail to tell unknown persons their dis∣eases, and prescribe for them.</P>
<P>At a future time, when the Science is better established, I shall publish a full account of the theory of <HI>Somnambulism.</HI></P>
<P>Some will accuse me of having said too much; but those who know me personally, will never accuse me of relating any thing which I cannot demonstrate; and those who repeat these mar∣vellous narrations, hurt themselves and the science, in the eyes of really learned men. Those stories, like traditions, which are handed down from generation to generation, and become improbable; like antiquity, lose their former lustre. I would advise my pupils to try those experiments I have shewn them first, and try the others afterward.</P>

<HEAD>To make an electric, or magnetical Apparatus.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL not give you a full account of the <HI>Apparatus</HI> of our society in <HI>Paris.</HI> It is more like a grove. Mine, which I had in <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> is a large oak tub, eight feet in diameter, well pitched in the inside, about an inch thick, (that belonging to our society, has lookingglasses all round it), in∣sulated upon four glass feet, bottles of water well corked; you magnetise the bottles, and lay them down, the neck of one in the bottom of the other all round; so that the last comes to the centre. You may fill up the space with broken bottles, or vi∣trifiable matter, brimstone, or resinous matter, minerals, &amp;c. Fill it up all but six inches; put some loadstones and artificial magnets in different directions; then cover the whole, to the edge, with fine, dry, river sand—put the lead over; place in the middle a polished iron bar about eight feet high, with sprigs to it, to attract the universal fluid which concentres itself in the reservoir. At the far corner place an <HI>Arbor Vitoe</HI> in a box; and place under it a strong magnet; the north pole upwards; the south pole is fixed in a hole upon the cover; by that mean you increase the motion of the tree, and, becoming vegetalised, it will grow without water. You make holes all round about, eighteen inches distant, put iron or brass conductors behind, so as to touch the patients who come next to it. Connect a chain of an electric machine; insulate your patients, and make them hold hands; it will increase the action in them. You may treat
<PB N="54" REF="046381_0053_102151C367528740"/>them in that manner; you will the sooner put them into <HI>Crises▪</HI> I have had all my patients, round my reservoir, in a <HI>Crisis</HI> at a time. I could not attend them. You may have a tree in a box, upon insulated feet; have a small box, filled with vitrisi∣able matter, and fill it with water; you may make use of a large bottle, filled with water only, and connect a chain to it. All this apparatus may be made differently, according to your idea.</P>
<P>To magnetise a tree, you must stand facing the north; you must have a conductor, which you have magnetised. You must point it from the top of the highest branches to the roots; do the same from the other branches. If the tree is so large that you cannot see the branches on the other side, change your po∣sition, from south to north, and do the same. Then approach the tree, clasp your hands round it, and stay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that position five minutes: your tree becomes magnetised. Any patient, who has been in a <HI>Crisis,</HI> or <HI>Somnambulism,</HI> will distinguish it. Some will go into a <HI>Crisis</HI> as soon as they come near it; others, if they are in <HI>Somnambulism,</HI> will discover it among the rest.</P>
<P>You may magnetise a myrtle, or any other shrub: it will appear luminous in the dark. You may magnetise a flower, by putting your thumbs in the middle, and establishing an equa∣tor; then, drawing your thumbs to the extremities, you press your thumb with the next finger, and you throw the fluid upon the flower. It will appear luminous in the dark. By giving it to a person to smell, who has been in a <HI>Crisis</HI> before, he will go into one again.</P>
<P>To magnetise a conductor or a cane, put your hands in the middle of it; slide your hands to the extremities; your thumbs at the top, and rub the extremities with them. By these means you will impregnate it with an electrical fluid, that seems lu∣minous in the dark, and as sulphurous as the electric rubbing.</P>
<P>To magnetise a shilling, or a guinea, put your thumbs in the middle, and draw them to the extremities: it will appear as a ball of fire. A watch is magnetised in the same manner, by drawing your two thumbs at the top, and your index under it. Establish an equator, and draw your fingers to the two poles. By shewing it to a person who has already been in a <HI>Crisis,</HI> he will fall into one again. They can tell you what o'clock it is in the dark. If asleep, they can tell you the same, by shewing a watch.</P>
<P>To magnetise a harpsicord, fix your hands spread on the middle, and draw them towards the extremities: then rub the
<PB N="55" REF="046381_0054_102151C5C437BE10"/>end you touch the strings with, one after another, in the same manner. By that mean you will impregnate it with an electric fluid. As soon as a person plays upon the harpsicord, make your patient touch it with his hand or finger: he will fall into a <HI>Crisis</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>To magnetise a room, or a bed is the same. Set it to the north, facing the south; point your conductor up to the ceiling; bring it down towards you. Point it to the west and east, and bring it also to your feet: the room will appear all luminons, and the bed also.</P>
<P>A pond may be magnetised in the same manner. By point∣ing your conductor over the surface of the water, from the car∣dinal points. Touch the water with it, and make your pati∣ent do the same. He will have a shock in falling in, and it may be of service to him.</P>
<P>From these few experiments it is easy to conceive, that any inanimate body may be electrified, or magnetised, which you please to call it. I have lately received information from <HI>Lon∣don</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> that a person may kill a dog, a horse, or a man; by fixing his eyes upon the heart, it will stop the circu∣lation, and kill them in an instant. My correspondant, who has as little saith as myself in these stories, informs me, "That in a bustle in the place Louis XV. an hussar came full gallop towards him, sword in hand: he treated the man and horse, but could not stop him. Having his gun loaded, he killed the man, and thrust the bayonet into the breast of the horse. He treated them both effectually." Others pretend to sink a ship at sea. This would be a good thing for an admiral! All those pretended experiments do no honour to those who relate them.</P>
<P>To treat one's self is as easy as to make our arms, feet, and other parts of the body, move in any direction we please. You may make yourself sick in your stomach by your <HI>absolute will,</HI> as well as to cause motion, perspiration, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shall now take leave of my pupils, and beg of them never to relate any thing but what they have repeated often; and hope, they will excuse my English, as I have not employed any clerks.</P>
