<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE object of the following work is, to give the people of this happy land a striking and experimental proof of the hor∣rible effects of anarchy and infidelity.</P>
<P>The necessity of such an undertaking, at this time, would have been, in a great mea∣sure, precluded, had our public prints been conducted with that impartiality and un∣daunted adherence to truth, which the in∣terests of the community and of suffering humanity demanded from them. But, so far from this, the greatest part of those ve∣hicles of information have most industrious∣ly concealed, or glossed over, the actions as well as the motives of the ruling powers in France; they have extenuated all their unheard-of acts of tyranny, on the false but specious pretence, that they were conducive to the establishment of a free government; and, one of the editors has not blushed to declare, that <Q>It would be <HI>an easy matter to appologize for all the massacres,</HI> that have taken place in that country.</Q></P>
<P>We have seen, indeed, some exceptions; some few prints that have not dishonoured themselves by going this length: but even these have observed a timid silence, and
<PB N="x" REF="030205_0009_0FE5116E01FB81E0"/>
have avoided speaking of the shocking bar∣barities of the French, with as much cauti∣on as if we were to partake in the disgrace, and as if it was in our power to hide them from the world and from posterity. If they have, now and then given way to a just in∣dignation, this has been done in such a manner, and has been so timid, as to do them but little honour. They have acted the part of the tyrannized people of Paris: they have huzza'd every succeeding tyrant, while on the theatre of power, and, the in∣stant he was transferred to a scaffold, they have covered him with reproach. They have attributed to factions, to individuals, what was the work of the national repre∣sentatives, and of the nation itself. They have, in short, inveighed against the mur∣derers of the fallen assassins, while they have, in the same breath, applauded the princi∣ples, on which they acted, and on which their survivers and their partizans do still act.</P>
<P>Thus has the liberty of the press, a liber∣ty of which we so justly boast, been not on∣ly useless to us during this terrible convul∣sion of the civilized world, but has been so perverted as to lead us into errors, which had well nigh plunged us into the situation of our distracted allies. Nor are we yet secure. Disorganizing and blasphemous
<PB N="xi" REF="030205_0010_0FE51176640C39C8"/>
principles have been disseminated among us with but too much success; and, unless we profit from the awful example before us, we may yet experience all the calamities that heaven and earth now call on us to deplore.</P>
<P>Fully impressed with this persuasion, the author of these sheets has ventured to unde∣ceive the misguided; to tear aside the veil, and shew to a yet happy people the dangers they have to fear. With this object in view, he has too much confidence in the good sense and piety of the major part of his coun∣trymen, not to be assured, that his efforts will be seconded by their zeal in the cause of order and religion.</P>
<P>The materials for the work have been col∣lected from different publications, <HI>all writ∣ten by Frenchmen,</HI> and all, except one, from which only a few extracts were made, <HI>printed at Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Even the prints, representing some of the frightful butcheries, perpetrated by the re∣volutionists, have been copied from French engravings.</P>
<P>Well aware that persons of a certain des∣cription will leave nothing untried to discre∣dit a performance of this nature, the author has taken particular care to mention the work, and even the page, from which each fact is extracted.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="030205_0011_0FE51177F1A1EAD8"/>He foresees that the cant of <HI>modern pa∣triotism</HI> will be poured forth against him on this occasion. He knows that he shall be represented as an enemy of the French na∣tion and of the cause of liberty. To this he will answer before-hand, with the frankness of a man who thinks no freedom equal to that of speaking the truth. As to the indi∣viduals composing this formerly amiable na∣tion, many of them, and he hopes very many, are still entitled to his love and es∣teem. He has, from his infancy, been an admirer of their sprightly wit; he owes a thousand obligations to their officious hospi∣tality, and has long boasted of their friend∣ship. But, with respect to the <HI>regenerated</HI> French, he would blush to be thought their friend, after what he has recorded in this volume.—And, as to the cause of liberty, if that cause is to be maintained, by falsehood blasphemy, robbery, violation and murder, he is, and trusts he ever shall be, its avowed and mortal enemy.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>FACTS taken from</HI> L'histoire du Clergé Fran∣çois, <HI>or,</HI> The History of the French Clergy, <HI>by the Abbé</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rruci.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT will be recollected by the greatest part of my readers, that, soon after the be∣ginning of the French Revolution, the Na∣tional Assembly conceived the plan of de∣stroying the religion of their forefathers. In order to effect this they separated the Gallican church from that of Rome, and imposed an oath on the clergy, which they could not take, without becoming apostate▪ in the fullest sense of the word. All the worthy and conscientious part of that body refused of course, and this refusal was made
<PB N="16" REF="030205_0013_0FE5117C7362C518"/>
a pretext to drive them from their livings, and fill the vacancies with such as had more pliant consciencies, principles better adapted to the impious system, which the leaders in the Assembly had prepared for their too credulous countrymen.</P>
<P>The ejectment of the priesthood was at∣tended with numberless acts of most attroci∣ous and wanton cruelty: these have been re∣corded by the <HI>Abbé Barruel,</HI> in a work en∣titled, <HI>The History of the French Clergy;</HI> and, though what is here to be found will dwindle into nothing, when compared to what I have extracted from other works, yet it could not be wholly omitted, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>howing a degree of insensibility for the suf∣ferings of these men, that I am persuaded the reader would not have excused. I shall therefore begin the relation with some ex∣tracts from that work.</P>
<P>It will be observed, that these extracts, as well as all those that compose this compi∣lation, are an abridged translation from the French; but, as far as relates to those con∣tained in this chapter, the American reader may easily verify the translation by examin∣ing the English edition of the Abbé <HI>Bar∣ruel's</HI> work, which is to be found in most parts of the Union.</P>

<P>Soon after the first National Assembly had decreed, that the Comtat of Avignon belonged to the French nation, an army of assassins, of whom one Jourdan, sur-named the Cut-throat, was the commander, took possession of the unfortunate city of Avig∣non. The churches were immediately pil∣laged, the sacred vases profaned and carried off, and the altars levelled to the ground. The prisons were soon filled, and the un∣happy victims were released only to suffer death. A deep pit was dug to receive their dead bodies, six hundred of which were thrown into it, mangled and distorted, be∣fore ten o'clock the next day. Among them was Mr. Nolhac, a priest, in the eighti∣eth year of his age. He had been thirty years rector of St. Symphorien, a parish which he prefered to all others, and which he could not be prevailed on to quit for a more lucrative one, because he would not desert the poor. During his rectorship he had been the common father of his parish∣ioners, the refuge of the indigent, the com∣forter of the afflicted, and the friend and counsellor of every honest man. When the hour of danger approached, his friends advised him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but no intrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could
<PB N="18" REF="030205_0015_0FE51186ABA32868"/>
prevail on him to abandon his flock: "No," said the good old man, <Q>I have watched over them in the halcyon days of peace, and shall I now leave them midst storms and tempests, without a guide; without any one to comfort them in their last dreary moments?</Q>—Mr. Nolhac, who, till now, had been respected even by the Cut∣throats, was sent to the prison the evening before the execution. His appearance and his salutation, were those of a consoling an∣gel: <Q>I come, my children, to die with you: we shall soon appear in the presence of that God whom we serve, and who will not desert us in the hour of death.</Q> He forti∣fied their drooping courage, administered the last consolatory pledges of his love, and, the next day embraced and cheered each in∣dividual as he was called forth by the mur∣derers. Two of these stood at the door with a bar of iron in their hands, and as the pri∣soners advanced knocked them down▪ the bodies where then delivered over to the other ruffians, who hacked and disfigured them with their sabres, before they threw them into the pit, that they might not after∣wards be known by their friends and rela∣tions. —When the Cut-throats were disper∣sed, every one was anxious to find the body of Mr. Nolhac. It was at last discovered by the cassock, and the crucifix which he
<PB N="19" REF="030205_0016_0FE51188337D1760"/>
wore on his breast. It had been pierced in fifty places, and the skull was mashed to pieces.</P>

<P>Several priests were conducted to L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣grave, where they were told that they must take the oath,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This oath amounted to neither more nor less than direct perjury, since, by taking it, they must break the oath they had made when they entered the priesthood.</NOTE> or suffer death. Among them was a Sulpician of 98 years of age, and a young Abbé of the name of Novi. The whole chose death, the venerable Sulpician leading the way. The trial of Mr. Novi was particularly severe. The ruffians brought his father to the spot, and told him, if he could persuade his son to swear, he should live. The tender old man, wavering, hesitating between the feelings of nature and the duties of religion, at last yields to pa∣rental fondness, throws his arms round his child's neck, buries his face in his bosom, and with tears and sobs presses his compli∣ance. <Q>Oh! my child, my child, spare the life of your Father!</Q>—<Q>My dearest Fa∣ther!
<PB N="20" REF="030205_0017_0FE5118B08CB3880"/>
—My dearest Father,</Q> returned the Abbé, <Q>I will do more. I will do more. I will die worthy of you and my God. You educated me a catholic: I am a priest, a servant of the Lord. It will be a greater comfort to you, in your gray hairs, to have your son a martyr than an apostate.</Q>—The villains tear them assunder, and amidst the cries and lamenta∣tions of the father, extend the son before him a bleeding corps.</P>

<P>In the same town, and on the same day, the ax was suspended over the head of Mr. Teron, when the revolutionists bethought them that he had a son. This son was a∣bout ten years of age, and, in order to en∣joy the fathers torments and the child's tears both at a time, he was brought to the place of execution. His tears and cries gave a relish to the ferocious banquet. After tir∣ing themselves with the spectacle, they put the father to death before the eyes of the child, whom they besmeared with his blood.</P>

<P>After having spoken of the conduct of the magistrates and mob at Bourdeaux, the historian mentions the death of Mr. Langoi∣ran and the Abbé Dupuis, thus:</P>
<P>At the entrance of the court-house, the Abbé Dupuis received a first wound; others soon levelled him to the ground. A young lad, of about fifteen or sixteen, cut a hole in the cheek with a knife, to hold up the head by, while others were employed in haggling it from the body, which was still in agonies. This operation not succeeding in such a crowd, they took hold of the legs, and dragged the carcase about the streets, and round the ramparts.</P>
<P>Mr. Langoiran had but just set his foot on the first step of the stairs, when he was knocked down. His head was hacked off in an instant, and a ruffian held it up, crying aloud: <Q>off with your hats! long live the nation</Q> The bareheaded populace answer∣ed: "long live the nation" The head was then carried round the town in signal of a triumph, gained by a tumultuous populace and ten thousand soldiers under arms, over a poor defenceless priest.</P>

<P>The 14th of July, so famous in the annals of the Revolution, was this year celebrated at Limoges, by the death of Mr. Chabrol. He was a most useful member of society; distinguished round his neighbourhood as a bone-setter; he was at once the surgeon and the pastor of his parishioners; and among his murderers were some of those who owed to him the use of their limbs. He was of a quick and impetuous temper, and indued with uncommon bodily strength. His death certainly was not that of a christian martyr; but it deserves particular notice, as a striking proof of the cowardly ferocity of the French populace.</P>
<P>He had taken shelter at a magistrates, and begged leave to elude the mob by going out of the house the back way; but the magi∣strate durst not comply. He was forced to face his blood-thirsty pursuers. The indignant priest met them at the door; the attack in∣stantly began. Without a single weapon of defence, he had to encounter hundreds of the mob, armed with clubs, guns, sabres, and knives; but, notwithstanding the amaz∣ing inequality, he held them a long time at bay. Some he felled to the ground, others ran from him; he tore a bayonet out of his
<PB N="23" REF="030205_0020_0FE5119591958E70"/>
flesh, and stabbing it into the breast of his adversary, sent him to die among the crowd. At last, weakened with the loss of blood, he falls, and the base and merciless scoundrels cry: <HI>to the lamp-post.</HI> The idea of hanging reanimates the remaining drops in his veins. He rises upon his legs for the last time; but numbers prevailed; again he falls, covered with wounds, and expires. His last groan is followed by the ferocious howl of <HI>victory;</HI> the dastardly assassins set no bounds to their insults; they cut and hacked his body to pieces, and wrangled for the property of his ragged and bloody cassock.</P>

<P>As soon as the unfortunate Louis XVI. had been transfered from his throne to a loathsome prison, the National Assembly formed a plan for the total extirpation of the priests, and with them the Christian Re∣ligion. The ministers of the altar were seiz∣ed and thrown into prison, or transported, from every part of the country. At Paris about three hundred of them were shut up, in order to be massacred, and were actually put to death during the first and second weeks of September, 1792.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="030205_0021_0FE5119852425CB8"/>About one hundred and eighty of these unhappy men were confined in the convent of the Carmelites. A troop of assassins commenced the massacre in the garden, where the priests were permitted to take the air; but while they were proceeding, a com∣missary arrived, and informed them that the work was not to go on that way. There were now about a hundred left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>live, who were all ordered into the sanctuary of the church; but, to get thither, they had to pass through a crowd of their murderers. One received a ball, another a blow, and another a stab: so that, when arrived in the sanctuary they pre∣sented a scene, the most heart-piercing that eyes ever beheld. Some were dragged in wounded, others quite dead. Even here, though surrounded by a detachment of soldi∣ers, the blood-thirsty mob rushed in upon them, and murdered several at the very altar. The sanctuary of a christian church was, for the first time since the blessed Redeemer ap∣peared among men, filled with a promiscuous group of the living, the dying, and the dead. The marble pavement was covered with dirt and gore and mangled carcases, and the sides of the altar splashed with blood and brains.</P>
<P>The soldiers had not been brought to save the lives of the priests: the commissary who headed them was to execute a plan of more deliberate murder. The surviving
<PB N="25" REF="030205_0022_0FE511A1DF6049A0"/>
priests were called out two at a time, and murdered in the presence of the commissary, who took ther names down in a book, as he was answerable for their assassination. Of all that were found here, only four or five escaped.—The like undistinguished carnage was exhibited at the other prisons.</P>
<P>Every one of these men might have saved his life by taking the proffered oath, yet not one of them condescended to do it. Let the infidel show us, if he can, any thing like this in the annals of his impious sect.</P>

<P>At the gate of the prison of La Force, the assassins were placed in two rows: the two ruffians, called judges, who gave the signal of death, were placed at the gate; and as soon as the prisoner passed them, the assassins dispatched him with their knives or sabres, throwing the bodies in a heap at the end of the line. At the foot of this trophy of dead bodies, says the historian, we must now exhibit a scene of a different kind, in the murder of the princess of Lamballe. She had retired in safety to London; but her attachment to the royal family would not suffer her to remain in her assylum, while
<PB N="26" REF="030205_0023_0FE511A3AB16D2A0"/>
they were exposed. Her fidelity was a crime that the infidelity of her enemies could never forgive.</P>
<P>When this illustrious victim was brought forth, she was asked to swear an eternal hatred to the king, the queen, and to roy∣alty. <Q>The oath, said she, is foreign to the sentiments of my heart, and I will never take it.</Q>—She was instantly deli∣vered over to the ministers of death. These ruffians pretend to caress her, stroke her cheeks with their hands yet reeking with human blood, and thus conduct her along the line. Amidst all these insults her courage never deserted her. When arrived at the heap of dead bodies, she was ordered to kneel, and ask pardon of the nation: "I have never injured the nation," she replied, "nor will I ask its pardon."— "Down," said they, "and ask pardon, if you wish to live." "No," said she, "I scorn to ask pardon from assassins that call themselves the nation: I will never bend my knee, or accept of a favour at such hands."</P>
<P>Her soul was superior to fear. <Q>Kneel and ask pardon</Q> was heard from a thousand voices, but in vain. Two of the assassins now seized her arms, and, pulling her from side to side, nearly dislocated her shoulders. "Go on, scoundrels," said the heroic prin∣cess,
<PB N="27" REF="030205_0024_0FE511A536076BC0"/>
"I will ask no pardon."—In a rage to see themselves thus overcome by the con∣stancy of a woman, they dashed her down, and rushed in upon her with their knives and poignards. Her head soon appeared hoisted upon a liberty pike, and her heart, after <HI>being bit</HI> by one of the ruffians, was put into a bason. Both were carried in triumph through the streets of Paris. At last, after having feasted the eyes of the multitude, the bearers took them to the Temple, now be∣come a prison, where one of the two com∣missaries that guarded the king, called him to the window, that he might see it; but his companion, a little more humane prevented the unfortunate monarch from approaching. A fainting fit, from hearing of the event, fortunately saved the queen from the heart-rending sight.</P>
<P>The body, stripped naked and the bowels hanging out, was exposed to view on the top of the murdered victim, where it re∣mained till the massacre was over.</P>

<P>A great fire was made in the Place-Dau∣phine, at which many, both men and wo∣men were roasted. The Countess of Perig∣nan,

with her three daughters were dragged thither. They were stripped, rubbed over with oil, and then put to the fire. The eldest of the daughters, who was fifteen, begged them to put an end to the torments, and a young fellow shot her through the head. The cannibals, who were shouting and dan∣cing round the fire, enraged to see them∣selves thus deprived of the pleasure of hear∣ing her cries, seized the too merciful mur∣derer, and threw him into the flames.</P>
<P>When the Countess was dead, they brought six priests, and, cutting off some of the roasted flesh, presented them each a piece to eat. They shut their eyes, and made no answer. The oldest of the priests was then stripped, and tied opposite the fire. The mob told the others, that perhaps they might prefer the relish of a priests' flesh to that of a Countess; but they suddenly rushed into the flames. The barbarians tore them out to prolong their torments; not, however, before they were dead, and beyond the reach even of Parisian cruelty.</P>

named Philip, living in the street of the Temple, came to the Jacobin Club, of which he was a member; and, with a box in his hand, mounted the tribune. Here he made a long speech on patriotism, conclud∣ing by a declaration, that he looked upon every one who preferred the ties of blood and of nature to that of patriotic duty, as an aristocrat worthy of death; and, to con∣vince them of the purity and sincerity of his own principles, he opened the box, and held up, by the gray hair, the bloody and shrivelled heads of his father and mother, "which I have cut off," said the impious wretch, <Q>because they obstinately persisted in not hearing mass from a constitutional priest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is one of the apostates.</NOTE>.</Q> The speech of this parricide re∣ceived the loudest applauses; and the two heads were ordered to be buried beneath the busts of Ankerstorm and Brutus, be∣hind the president's chair <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">According to Monsieur Peltier, in his picture of Paris, the number of persons murdered in the different prisons of that city, from Sunday the 2d to Friday the 7th of September 1792, amounted to 1,005.

<P><PB N="30" REF="030205_0027_0FE511B0CB6436C8"/>The last fact related is of such a horrid nature that, though so well authenticated, it would almost stagger our belief, had we not proof of so many others, which equal, if not surpass it. I shall here extract one from <HI>La Conjuration de Maximillen Robes∣pierre,</HI> a work published at Paris in the year 1795.</P>
<P>The author, after speaking of the unna∣tural ferociousness which the revolution had produced in the hearts of the people, says (page 162) I will here give a proof, and a shocking one it is.—Garnier of Orleans had a son, who had been intended for the priest∣hood, and had been initiated in the sub∣deaconship; consequently he was attached to the Christian faith. His father one day seized him by the throat, and led him to the revolutionary tribunal, where he was instantly condemned; nor would the bar∣barous father quit his child till he saw his head severed from his body. After the execution was over, the tribunal, ever as capricious as bloody, feigned remorse, and were proceeding to condemn the father; but the National Convention, informed of the affair, annulled the process, and publicly
<PB N="31" REF="030205_0028_0FE511B254C4ECD0"/>
applauded the conduct of the unnatural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther, as an imitator of the republican Brutus.</P>
<P>In the extracts from the history of the French clergy, the proposed limits of this work has obliged me to forego the pleasure of mentioning a great number of facts, which reflect infinite honour on that calum∣niated and unfortunate body of men, as well as on the Christian religion. The fol∣lowing trait, however, I cannot prevail on myself to omit.</P>

<P>At Rheims lived a man, who, from the number of his years, might be called the dean of Christendom; and, from the fame of his virtues, the priest, by excellence. He had long been known by no other name than that of the holy priest. This was Mr. Pacquot, rector of St. John's. When the revolutionary assassins broke into his orato∣ry, they found him on his knees. A true and faithful disciple of Jesus Christ, he yielded himself into the hands of his execu∣tioners without so much as a murmur, and suffered himself to be led before the fero∣cious
<PB N="32" REF="030205_0029_0FE511B54FDE9F40"/>
magistrate, as a lamb to the slaughter. He crossed the street singing the psalms of David, while the sanguinary ruffians that conducted him, endeavoured to drown his voice by their blasphemies. At the threshold of the town-hall an attempt was made to murder him, but the mayor interfered, say∣ing to the people, <Q>What are you about? This old fellow is beneath notice. He is a fool: fanaticism has turned his brain.</Q>— These words roused the venerable old man. <Q>No, Sir, says he, I am neither a fool nor a fanatic, nor shall my life take re∣fuge under such an ignominious shelter. I wish you to know, that I was never more in my sober senses. These men have rendered me an oath, decreed by the National Assembly. I am well ac∣quainted with the nature of this oath: I know that it is impious, and subversive of religion. They leave me the choice of the oath or death, and I choose the lat∣ter. I hope, Sir, I have convinced you, that I am in my senses, and know per∣fectly well what I am about.</Q>—The nettled magistrate immediately abandoned him to the mob. "Which of you," said the old man, <Q>is to have the patriotic ho∣nour of being my murderer?</Q>—"I am," says a man who moved in a sphere that ought to have distinguished him from a
<PB N="33" REF="030205_0030_0FE511B962FF4250"/>
horde of ruffians. <Q>Let me embrace you then,</Q> says Mr. Pacquot; which he actual∣ly did, and prayed to God to forgive him. This done, the hard-hearted villain gave him the first blow, and his companions bu∣ried their bayonets in his emaciated breast.</P>
<P>The reader's heart, I hope, will teach him the love and veneration, that every christian ought to feel for the memory of this evange∣lical old man.</P>
<P>If the death of all the murdered priests was not marked with such unequivocal proofs of constancy and fidelity as that of Mr. Pacquot, it was, perhaps, because a like opportunity did not always present itself. One thing we know; that, by taking an oath contrary to their faith, they might not only have escaped the knives of their assas∣sins, but might have enjoyed an annual in∣come. Their refusing to do this is an in∣controvertible testimony, that they were no impostors or hypocrites, but sincere be∣lievers of the religion they taught, and that they valued that religion more than life it∣self; and, this is the best answer that can possibly be given to all the scandalous and atrocious calumnies that their enemies and the enemies of Christianity have vomited forth against them.</P>

<P>The grand scene of destruction and mas∣sacre was opened, in the once-flourishing and opulent city of Lyons, by a public pro∣fanation of all those things, that had been looked upon as sacred. The murderers in chief, chosen from among the members of the National Convention, were a play-actor and a man who, under the old government, had been a bum-bailiff. Their first step was to brutify the minds of the populace; to ex∣tinguish the remaining sparks of humanity and religion, by teaching them to set heaven and an hereafter at defiance; in order to
<PB N="35" REF="030205_0032_0FE511C0580BC6E8"/>
prepare them for the massacres, which they, were commissioned to execute.</P>
<P>A mock procession was formed, in imi∣tation of those observed by the catholic church. It was headed by a troop of men bearing in their hands the chalices and other vases which had been taken from the plundered churches, At the head of the procession there was an Ass, dressed in the vestments of the priests that the revolutio∣nary army had murdered in the neighbour∣hood of the city, with a mitre on his head. This beast, a beast of the same kind on which our Redeemer rode, now bore a load of crucifixes, and other symbols of the christian religion; having the old and new testament tied to his tail. When this pro∣cession came to the spot which had been fixed on for the purpose, the bible was burnt, and the Ass given to drink out of the sacra∣mental cup, amidsts the shouts and rejoicing of the blasphemous assistants.</P>
<P>Such a begining plainly foretold what was to follow. An undistinguished butche∣ry of all the rich immediately commenced. Hundreds of persons, women as well as men, were taken out of the city at a time, tied to trees, shot to death, stabbed, or else knock∣ed on the head. In the city the guillotine never ceased a moment; it was shifted three times; holes were dug at each place to re∣ceive
<PB N="36" REF="030205_0033_0FE511C32FA18EC8"/>
the blood, and yet it ran in the gutters.</P>
<P>It were impossible to describe this scene of carnage, or to give an account of each act of the, till now, unheard-of barbarity: two or three, however, demand a particular mention.</P>

<P>Madame Lauras, hearing that her hus∣band was condemned, went, accompanied with her ten children, and threw herself on her knees before the ferocious Collot D'herbois, one of the members of the Con∣vention; but no mercy could be expected from a wretch whose business it was to kill. She followed her beloved husband to the place of execution, surrounded with her weeping offspring. On seeing him fall, her cries and the wildness of her looks but two plain∣ly foretold her approaching end. She was seized with the pains of a premature child∣birth, and was carried home to her house, where a commissary soon after arrived, drove her from her bed and her house, from the door of which she fell dead into the street.</P>

<P>At Lyons the priests met with the same treatment as at other places, and honoured their deaths with the same unshaken forti∣tude. Twenty seven were executed at one time, not one of whom had condescended to accept of the shameful conditions that were offered, nor even to solicit a pardon from the vile and blasphemous assassins.</P>
<P>During this murderous work the city of Lyons was struck with terror. The mem∣bers of the convention stuck up a proclama∣tion, declaring all those, who should express the least symptoms of pity, <HI>suspected persons.</HI> When the blood had in some measure, cea∣sed
<PB N="39" REF="030205_0036_0FE511CF96F960D0"/>
to flow, and the affrighted inhabitants ventured out of their houses, they were seen walking along the streets with their eyes fix∣ed on the ground: men no longer stopped, shook hands, and gave each other good morrow. The fear of death was stamped on every face: children durst not ask after their parents, nor parents ask after their children.</P>
<P>The villages round about shared in the fate of the city. An apostate priest conduc∣ted a gang of ruffians, who carried fire and death before them among those good people, whose only crime was giving shelter to per∣sons escaped from the massacre. The cha∣ritable host and his affrighted guest were butchered together beneath the hospitable roof, while the wives and daughters were reserved to satisfy the brutal appetites of the murderers.</P>
<P>In vain should I attempt to give the rea∣der an adequate idea of the crimes, commit∣ted, by the order of the Convention, in this part of France. The author of <HI>La Conjura∣tion de Robespierre</HI> says (page 159) that in the space of a few months, the number of persons, who were murdered in the Lyon∣nese and in the surrounding forests, amount∣ed to two hundred thousand.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="030205_0037_0FE511D11FA91658"/>I shall conclude this chapter with a fact or two taken from <HI>La Conjuration de Robes∣pierre.</HI></P>

<P>Though no torments could go beyond the merits of Robespierre and his colleagues, yet, even in the execution of these monsters, the Parisians discovered such traits of fero∣ciousness as fully proved, that these grovell∣ing tyrants had done no more than what they themselves would have done, had they been in their places.</P>
<P>Robespierre had been wounded in his head and face; his jaws were held together with bandages; and the executioner, before he placed his neck under the guillotine, sud∣denly tore off the bandages, letting his un∣der jaw fall, while the blood streamed down his breast. The poor deserted wretch was kept some time in this frightful state, while the air resounded with the acclamations of the barbarous populace.</P>

blood. His hair was clotted, and his as∣sassinating hands were now stained with his own gore. He had been wounded all over, one eye he kept shut, while the other was started from its socket, and held only by the fibres. This horrid spectacle, from which the imagination turns with disgust and affright, excited the joy, and even the mirth of the Parisians. <Q>Look at the scoundrel, said they, just as he was when he assisted in murdering the priests.</Q> The people called on the carts to stop, and a group <HI>of women</HI> performed <HI>a dance</HI> round that in which the capital offenders rode.—When Henriot was stepping from the cart to the scaffold, one of the under∣executioners, to divert the spectators, tore out the eye that was already loose.—What a hard-hearted wretch must he be who could perform an action like this? and to what a degree of baseness and ferocity must that people be arrived, who could thus be diverted?</P>

<P>What could be expected from an educa∣tion like this? What could be expected from children who were taught to use an instrument of ignominious death as a play∣thing; who were taught to laugh at the screams of the dying, and who, in a man∣ner, sucked in blood with their mothers' milk?

<P>What I am now going to relate, the mo∣thers of future generations will hear with affright.—A child of ten years of age had been scolded, perhaps whipped, by his mo∣ther. He ran to the revolutionary tribu∣nal, and accused her of being still attached

<P>Tell us, ye mothers, for you only can know, what this poor creature must feel at seeing herself betrayed, and ready to be deprived of life, by the child she had borne in her womb, who but the other day hung at her breast, and for whom alone, per∣haps, she wished to live.</P>

<P><HI>FACTS selected from the</HI> Procés-Criminel des Membres du Comité Revolutionnaire de Nantes, et du ci-devant Representant du peuple Carrier; <HI>or,</HI> Trial of the Mem∣bers of the Revolutionary Committee at Nantz, and of the Representative Carrier.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE work which we are now entering on was published at Paris during the last year; but, as an introduction to the facts
<PB N="45" REF="030205_0042_0FE511E1A5FD24B8"/>
extracted from it, it will be necessary to give the reader a concise sketch of the progress of the Revolution down to the epoch when the work was published.</P>
<P>The Sates-General, consisting of the three orders, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Tiers-Etat, or commonalty, were assembled on the 4th of May, 1789. The deputies were all furnished with written instructions in which they were positively enjoined to make no innovations as to the form of go∣vernment. Notwithstanding this, it is well known, they framed a constitution by which the government was totally changed, the nobility abolished, and the church rent from that of Rome. Their constitution, however, though established at the expence of thou∣sands of lives, and though one of the most ridiculous systems of government that ever was invented, did not fail to meet with par∣tizans; and we have heard it exotolled in this country as the master-piece of human wisdom.</P>
<P>This first Assembly, which has been com∣monly called the Constituent Assembly, en∣ded its benificent labours on the 30th of September, 1791, and was immediately suc∣ceeded by another, which took the name of the Legislative Assembly. Most men of sense foresaw that the second Assembly would im∣prove upon the plan of destruction marked
<PB N="46" REF="030205_0043_0FE511EDFA362538"/>
out by the first. The Clergy and many men of family and fortune had been already driven from their homes and possessions, it remained for the Legislative Assembly to finish the work by seizing on their property and exposing it to sale: this they failed not to do. Persecution and massacre increased daily; but as the small remains of power left in the hands of the king was still an ob∣stacle, or rather as the monarchy itself was an obstacle, they were determined to get rid of it. On the 10th of August, 1792, the king was dethroned (his fate is well known) and the daggers of the assassins were from that moment drawn, never more to be sheathed, but in the heart of some in∣nocent victim. We have already seen some∣thing of the massacres which followed this event at Paris and other places; but even these are trifles to what was to follow.</P>
<P>On the 21st of September, 1792, the third Assembly, generally called the National Convention, opened their sessions, and, though every individual member had repeat∣edly taken an oath to maintain the authority of the king, they at once declared France to be a republic.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, this Con∣vention declared war against a great part of the powers of Europe; and, in order to be in a situation to make head against their
<PB N="47" REF="030205_0044_0FE511EF8AA82640"/>
enemies, seized on all the precious metals in the country, or rather they enacted such laws as obliged the poor oppressed people to bring it to their treasury, and receive in exchange a vile and worthless paper money. The churches were instantly pillaged, and no person dared appear with a watch, or any other article in gold or silver.</P>
<P>The violation of property was only a part of their plan. The hearts of the lower or∣ders of the people were to be hardened; they were to be rendered brutal; all fear of an hearafter was to be rooted from their souls, before they could be fit instruments in the hands of this hellish Assembly. With this object in view, they declared our blessed Lord and redeemer to be an Impos∣tor, forbade the acknowledgement of him, and the exercise of his worship. The chur∣ches were turned into prisons, stables, &amp;c. and over the gateways of the burial grounds were written: <Q>This is the place of <HI>eternal sleep.</HI></Q> Never surely was there a better plan for transforming a civilized people into a hoard of cut-throats. It succeeded com∣pleatly. The blood now flowed at Paris in an unceasing stream. A permanent tribu∣nal was established, whose only business was to condemn, and certify to the Convention that the executions went on according to the lists sent from its committees.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="030205_0045_0FE511F26473A270"/>Besides legions of executioners there were others of assassins. The command of these latter was given to those members of the Convention who were sent into the different parts of the country. Terror preceded these harbingers of death, and their footsteps were marked with blood. The sword, the fire, and the water, all became instruments of destruction.</P>
<P>During this murdering time, which has justly assumed the name of the <HI>reign of ter∣ror,</HI> the leaders of several factions of the revolutionists themselves received their re∣ward on a scaffold, and, among others, Robespierre and his accomplices. When these men fell, the Convention, according to its usual custom, ascribed all the cruel∣ties, committed during sometime before their death, to them alone, and the people, always eager for blood, now demanded the heads of those whom they had assisted in the murder of their countrymen. By sa∣crificing these its instruments, the Con∣vention saw a fair opportunity of removing the infamy from itself, and of perpetuating its power. In consequence, many of them were tried and executed, and among others Carrier (a member of the Convention) who had been stationed at Nantz, with the mem∣bers of the revolutionary committee of that unfortunate town. From the trial of these
<PB N="49" REF="030205_0046_0FE511FBD89453F0"/>
men it is that I have selected the facts which are to compose this chapter. The trial was before the tribunal at Paris, to which place the accused were carried from Nantz.</P>
<P>It has been repeatedly asserted, by those who seem to have more attachment to the cause of the French than to that of truth, that the barbarities committed in that coun∣try, have been by the hands of foreigners. Such a story is impossible, and even ridi∣culous; but however, it has induced me to insert here a list of the barbarous wretch∣es who were so long the scourge of the city of Nants, from which it will appear, that they were all Frenchmen, born and bred. This is an act of justice due to other nations.</P>

<P>Carrier was the great mover, the assassin-general; the committee were his agents. Some of them were always assembled in their hall, to give directions to the under∣murderers, while the others took repose, or were dispatched on important expedition, such as the shooting or drowning of hundreds at a time. They stood in need, however, of subaltern cut-throats, more determined and bloody than the people in general; and therefore they raised a company, who took the title of the company of Marat, composed of the vilest wretches that were to be found. These being assembled together took the following oath before their employers.</P>

<P><HI>Tronjolly,</HI> a witness, informs the tribu∣nal, that the Company of Marat was at first composed of sixty persons; that Goullin openly proposed that none but the most in∣famous villains should be admitted into it: and, at each nomination, cried out, <Q>Is there no greater scoundrel to be found?</Q></P>
<P>On the 24th of October, says the wit∣ness, I heard Goullin and his colleagues say, that they were going to give a great exam∣ple; that the prisoners should be all shot. I attest that this scene was still more horrible than that of the 22d and 23d of September. The Company of Marat were carousing round a table, and at the same time it was deliberated whether the prisoners should not be massacred by hundreds. In this deli∣beration, Coullin was for indiscriminate death: and thus were the prisoners, without ever being interrogated, or heard, con∣demned to die. There existed no proofs of guilt against these unfortunate prisoners; they were what were called <HI>suspected persons;</HI> the felons, and all <HI>real</HI> criminals were set at liberty.</P>
<P>Carrier, in quality of member of the Convention, had placed a vile wretch at Pain-boeuf, name Foucault, to whom he gave an absolute power of life and death.</P>

<P>Old men, women with child, and chil∣dren, were drowned, no distinction. They were put on board of lighters, which were railed round to keep the prisoners from jumping overboard if they should happen to disengage themselves. There were plugs made in the bottom, or sides, which, be∣ing pulled out, the lighter sunk, and all in it were drowned. These expeditions were first carried on by night, but the sun soon beheld the murderous work. At first the prisoners were drowned in their cloths; this, however, appeared too merci∣ful▪ to expose the two sexes naked before each other was a pleasure that the ruffi∣ans could not forego.</P>
<P>I must now, says the witness, speak of a new sort of cruelty. The young men and women were picked out from among the mass of sufferers, stripped naked, and tied together, face to face. After being kept in this situation about an hour, they were put into an open lighter; and, after re∣ceiving several blows on the skull with the but of a musket, thrown into the water. These were called <HI>republican marriages.</HI></P>

<P>On the 26th of October, Carrier, the member of the Convention, ordered me (the witness was a judge of some sort) to guillotine indiscriminately all the Vendeans who came to give themselves up. I refused; but the representative of the people pro∣mised that his prey should not escape him thus. In short, on the 29th, he had guil∣lotined twenty seven Vendeans, among whom were children of thirteen, fourteen and fifteen, years of age, and seven young women, the oldest of which was not above twenty nine. On the same day twenty other persons were executed without trial.</P>

<P><HI>Latour,</HI> a witness, says, I was sick; Dul∣ny, who was my doctor, informed me that Goudet, public accuser, had let him into an important secret; which was, that Carrier and the revolutionary committee not know∣ing how to squeeze the rich, had fell upon a plan to imprison them, while they seized on their effects. In order to have a pretext for doing this, said Goudet, we shall give out, that there exists a conspiration against the republic. I am to make the general beat early in the morning. The sans-cu∣lottes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This degrading term, which is become the glory of modern patriots, literally means, <HI>men without breeches;</HI> but it was ever used by the French to desig∣nate vile, rascally people, the dregs of society; and as such we ought now to understand it.</NOTE>, informed beforehand, are to pa∣rade at their different posts; the rich, and the timid, will, according to custom, re∣main in their houses; to these houses the sans-culottes are to repair, pillage all they have, and convey them to prison.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding my illness, I had no in∣clination to be found at home; I therefore begged the doctor to give me notice when the affair was to take place, which he pro∣mised to do. In three days after he in∣formed
<PB N="57" REF="030205_0055_0FE5126DEC06C468"/>
me that the general would beat the next morning. In spite of my sickness I went to my post. We were all the day un∣der arms, and a great number of rich peo∣ple were pillaged and imprisoned, some guillotined.</P>
<P>I attest, adds the witness, that there was not the least appearance of any conspiration. All was a dead calm; terror and consterna∣tion alone reigned in the city. More than three thousand victims to lust and avarice were this day lodged in loathsome dun∣geons, from whence they were never to be released but to be led to slaughter.</P>
<P>I shall now insert an article or two that will give the reader an idea of the manner of proceeding of these sans-culottes.</P>

<P>One of the members of the revolutionary committee, with a company of armed ruf∣fians, went to the house of one Careil. They first examined all the papers, took 5000 livres in paper money, and 12 louis d'ors. They returned again in the even∣ing, says the witness, who it seems was mistress of the house; we, at first took
<PB N="58" REF="030205_0056_0FE51210A1FFEB20"/>
them for common thieves, and <HI>therefore our alarm was not so great;</HI> but, to our sorrow, we were soon convinced by the voice of Pi∣nard, that they were the patriots of the re∣volutionary committee. Our family was composed of women and one old man. There was myself; four sisters-in-law, for∣merly nuns; two old relations above eighty years of age, and my husband. The house and yard were stripped of every thing, and the ruffians were talking of setting fire to the buildings. One of my sisters had made shift to preserve 800 livres; she offered them these to save the house; they accept the conditions, receive the money, and then burn the house to the ground.</P>
<P>Our persons were now all that remained to be disposed of. There was a one-horse chair; but which was too good for any of us; it was fastened to the tail of a cart into which we were put (my husband, an old and infirm man being obliged to walk in the rear) and thus were dragged, preceded by our plundered property, to that gang of cut-throats, called the revolutionary committee. Here our complaints were in a moment stiffled. Pinard said, that his orders were to burn all, and kill all. The committee were astonished and offended at his clemen∣cy, and reprimanded him severely for not having murdered us according to his orders.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030205_0057_0FE5126F73798168"/>I, my sisters, and our poor old relations were sent to one prison, and my husband to another. My husband died, and we are only left alive to weep and starve.</P>
<P>It is well worth the readers while to hear what this Pinard said in his defence, on this head.</P>

<P>We acted, says he, by the order of the Representative of the People, Carrier. When I went, at my return, to carry him the church-plate that I had taken from the nuns, he would insist upon my drinking out of the chalice (or sacramental cup) and asked me why I had not killed all the dam∣ned bitches.</P>
<P>I shall here observe, once for all, that these volumes contain a series of robberies of this sort. Sometimes the plunder was di∣vided among the plunderers, sometimes it was delivered to Carrier, and at others it was deposited with the revolutionary com∣mittee. These latter imposed immense taxes, or rather contributions, on the peo∣ple,
<PB N="60" REF="030205_0058_0FE51216A91ADB90"/>
under pretence of assisting the sans-cullottes, but which were applied to their own uses. It is just to observe also, that the tribunal at Paris, before which they were brought to answer for their crimes, appears to have snown much more anxiety about the gold and silver, than about the lives of the murdered persons.</P>

<P><HI>Mariotte,</HI> a witness, informs the tribu∣nal that he was detached on a party to se∣ven miles distant from Nantz. The party, says the witness, went into the neighbour∣hood of the forest of Rincé, and took up their quarters in a house occupied by Mrs. Chauvette. Five days after our arrival, came Pinard, about midnight, and told us that we were in the house of an aristocrat. He bragged of having that evening killed six women, and said that Chauvette should make the seventh. He threatened her, and, to add to her torment, told her to comfort herself, for that her child should die first. It is Pinard, adds he, that now speaks to you; Pinard, that carries on the war against the female sex. I drew my sword, continues the witness, and told Pinard that he should
<PB N="61" REF="030205_0059_0FE51277C48B9300"/>
pass over my dead body to come at the woman.</P>
<P><HI>Commerais,</HI> who was another of this par∣ty, informs the tribunal, that Pinard being thus stopped, Aubinet one of his compa∣nions said, stand aside while I cut open the guts of that bitch. He did not succeed, however, adds this witness. Now Marieuil came up, and swore he would have her life; but finding us in his way, he said, you look like a good b—ger enough; I have a word to say in your ear.—We only want, says he, to know where she has hidden 60,000 livres belonging to a gentleman in the neighbourhood. I answered, give me your word not to hurt the woman nor her child, and I will bring her forth. He pro∣mised, and I brought them out. The wo∣man, seeing that she was conducted to a sort of cellar, cried out, I know I am brought here to be murdered, like the wo∣men whose throats were cut in this place yesterday. All the favour I ask, said she, is that you will kill me before you kill my child. She was now questioned about the money; but she continued her protestations of knowing nothing of it. Pinard and Au∣binet prepared again to assassinate her; but they did not succeed for this time.</P>

<P>The same witness relates another adventure. When we were going hence, says he, to∣wards the forest of Rincé, we heard a man, in a little wood, crying for help. We found Pinard, and two other horsemen each hav∣ing a piece of linen under his arm. We left them, and soon after saw two poor pea∣sants running away. In going along among the brushwood, says the witness, I heard something rustle almost under my feet: I knocked the bushes aside with my musket; what should it be but two children. I gave one of them, who was seven years old, into the care of Cedré, and kept the other, of five years old, myself. They both cried bitterly. Their cries brought to us two women, their mothers, who were also hid among the bushes; they threw themselves upon their knees, and besought us not to kill their children. In quitting the wood Pinard came up with us, he had several wo∣men, whom I saw him chop down, and murder with his sabre. What, says he to me, are you going to do with those two children? stand away, says he, till I blow out their brains. I opposed him, and while we were in dispute, two volunteers brought an old man, stone-blind. This we now
<PB N="63" REF="030205_0061_0FE5127995EF5B40"/>
found was the grandfather of the children. Pray, said the poor old man, take my life, and preserve my little darlings. I told him that we would take care of them; he wept and squeezed my hand. This unfortunate old man, adds the witness, was murdered as well as the women.</P>
<P>Pinard quitted the high road in returning, for no other purpose but that of murdering. He and his companions killed all they came at, men women and children of all ages. To justify his barbarity, he produced the decree that ordered him to spare neither sex nor age.</P>
<P>My reader will recollect, that the Na∣tional Convention of France had abolished <HI>negro-slavery;</HI> and he will also recollect, that the <HI>humanity</HI> of this measure has been much applauded by those who have not penetra∣tion enough to see their motive in so doing.</P>
<P>We shall now see what advantage this li∣berty proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the unfortunate country people ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nantz. This city, from its commercial relations with the West-India islands, always contained a number of blacks who came to wait on their masters, &amp;c. As soon as the decree abolishing ne∣gro-slavery appeared, these people claimed their rights as citizens; and, having no em∣ployment,
<PB N="64" REF="030205_0062_0FE5121BA5232FD8"/>
they were taken into the service of the republic, and placed under the orders of the revolutionary committee. A party of these citizens were sent to assist in the murders round the city, and we shall see that they were by no means wanting in obe∣dience to their employers.</P>

<P>An officer, named Ormes came, says a wit∣ness, to ask our assistance in favour of five pret∣ty women, whom the company of <HI>Americans</HI> (this was the word which had taken place of that of <HI>negroes,</HI> because the Convention had forbidden any one to call them <HI>negroes)</HI> had reserved for a purpose easily to be guessed at. A party marched off, and soon came to the house where the blacks b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lodged the women. The poor creatures were crying and groaning; their sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks were to be heard at half a mile. The party order∣ed the door to be opened, which was at last done. They then demanded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> women, no, replied the blacks, they are now <HI>our slaves;</HI> we have earned them dear enough, and you shall tear them away limb by limb, if you have them.

<PB N="65" REF="030205_0063_0FE5127DD50D53F8"/>
the French empire contained <HI>no slaves.</HI> The brutality of the blacks would not permit them to listen to the voice of rea∣son; they prepared for the <HI>defence of their prey,</HI> when the party, always guided by <HI>pru∣dence, preferred retiring, to avoid slaughter.</HI></P>
<P>Two days after, continues the witness, the <HI>Americans,</HI> satiated with their captives, left them. One of these women, the hand∣somest in the eyes of the blacks, had been obliged to endure the approaches of more than a hundred of them. She was fallen into a kind of stupor, and was unable to walk or to stand. The whole five were shot soon after.</P>
<P>I do not know which is most entitled to our detestation here, the brutal negroes, or the pusillanimous, rascally Frenchmen, who were the witnesses of their horrid deeds. <HI>Prudence</HI> taught these poltroons to retire, when they saw five of their lovely country∣women exposed to the nauseous embraces of a set of filthy merciless monsters!

shootings of poor defenceless innocent priests, and women and children! It was not till the blacks prepared to <HI>defend their prey,</HI> that <HI>prudence</HI> taught you to retire!</P>
<P>Some of the women, taken in the coun∣try, were suffered to die, or rather to be murdered, in a less shocking way.</P>

<P>The revolutionary hospital, says the wit∣ness, was totally unprovided with every nece∣ssary. The jail-fever made terrible ravages in all the houses of detention; seventy five per∣sons, or thereabout, died daily in this hospital. There were nothing but rotten mattrasses, on each of which more than fifty prisoners had breathed their last.</P>
<P>I went to Chaux, one of the committee, to ask for relief for the unhappy wretches that remained here. We cannot do anything, said Chaux; but, if you will, you may con∣tribute to the cause of <HI>humanity</HI> by a way that I will point out to you. That rascal Phillippes has 200,000 livers in his clutches which we cannot come at. Now, if you will accuse him in form, and support your accusation by witnesses that I will engage to furnish you with, I will grant you, out of the sum, all that you want for the revoluti∣onary hospital. At the very mention of <HI>humanity</HI> from Chaux I was astounded: the latter part of his proposal, however, brought me back to my man. I rejected it with the indignation that it merited.</P>
<P>I attest, that the revolutionary comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Nantz seized and impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

those who were esteemed rich, men of ta∣lents, virtue and humanity.</P>
<P>I accuse this committee of having ordered, to my knowledge, the shooting or drowning of between four and five hundred children, the oldest of which were not more than fourteen years of age.</P>
<P>Minguet, one of the committee, had giv∣en me an order to choose two from among the children, whom I intended to save from death and bring up. I chose one of eleven years old, and another fourteen. The next day I went to the prison, called the <HI>Entrepot,</HI> with several of my friends, whom I had prevailed on to ask for some of these children. When we came, we found the poor little creatures stood no longer in need of our interposition. They were all drown∣ed. I attest, that I saw in this prison, but the evening before, more than four hun∣dred.</P>
<P>Having received an order from the milita∣ry commissioners to go to the <HI>Entrepot,</HI> to certify as to the pregnancy of a great num∣ber of women, I found, in the entering this horrible slaughter-house, a great quantity of dead bodies, thrown here and there. I saw several infants, some yet palpitating, and others drowned in tubs of human ex∣crement. —I hurried along through this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of horror. My respect frightened the
<PB N="69" REF="030205_0067_0FE5128A4D09DC30"/>
women: they had been accustomed to see none but their butchers. I encouraged them; spoke to them the language of huma∣nity. I found that thirty of them were with child; several of them seven or eight months. Some few days after I went again to see these unhappy creatures, whose situation rendered them objects of compassion and tenderness; but—(adds the witness with a faultering voice) shall I tell you, they had been most inhumanly murdered.</P>
<P>The further I advanced, continues the witness, the more was my heart appalled. There were eight hundred women and as many children confined in the <HI>Entrepot</HI> and in the <HI>Mariliere.</HI> There were neither beds, straw, nor necessary vessels. The prisoners were in want of every thing. Doctor Rol∣lin and myself saw five children expire in less than four minutes. They received no kind of nourishment.—We asked the women in the neighbourhood, if they could not lend them some assistance. What would you have us do? said they, Grand-Maison arrests eve∣ry one that attempts to succour them.</P>

prisoners, whom, for want of time to exa∣mine them, they had hewn down with sa∣bres under the window of their hall.</P>
<P>The witness adds, Carrier and the com∣mittee, as well as their under-murderers, used to turn the drownings into jests: they called them <HI>immersions, national baptisms, vertical transportations, bathings,</HI> &amp;c. I en∣tered, says he, one day a public house op∣posite the Bouffay, where I saw a water∣man, named <HI>Perdreau.</HI> He asked me for a pinch of snuff: for, says the ruffian, I have richly earned it; I have just helped to dispatch seven or eight hundred. How, says I, do you manage to make away with them so fast. Nothing so easy, replied he; when I have a bathing match, I strip them naked, two men with their bayonets push them tied two and two into my boat, whence they go souse into the water, with a broken skull.</P>

<P><HI>Vaujois,</HI> a witness, says; I wrote ten times to the administrators of the district, and went often to the revolutionary committee to request, that something should be done for the poor children in prison; but could

obtain nothing. At last I ventured to speak to Carrier, who replied, in a pas∣sion; You are a counter-revolutionist: no pity: they are young vipers, that must be destroyed.—If I had acted of myself, says the witness, I should have shared their fate.</P>
<P>One day in entering the <HI>Entrepot,</HI> a ci∣tizen of Nantz saw a great heap of corpses: they were all of children: many were still palpitating and struggling with death. The man looked at them for some time, saw a child move its arm, he seized it, ran home with it, and had the good luck to save it from death and its more terrible mini∣nisters.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Thomas</HI> is again questioned, and he attests, that the revolutionary committee issued an order, commanding all those who had taken children from the prisons, to carry them back again; and this, adds the witness, for the pure pleasure of having them murdered.</P>

<P>I was also witness of the drowning of ninety priests, two of whom, who were decrepid old men, by some accident or other escaped; but were retaken and murdered. Indeed, adds this witness, I have been an eye witness of several drownings of men, women with child, girls, boys, infants, in∣discriminately. I have also seen of all these descriptions shot in the public square, and

<P><HI>Lacaille,</HI> keeper of another prison, called the <HI>Bouffay,</HI> gives a circumstantial account of one of the drownings.</P>
<P>The horrid night, says the witness, of the 23d of October, two soldiers of the Company of Marat came to the <HI>Bouffay,</HI> each with a bundle of cords. About nine o'clock they told me there were one hun∣dred and fifty five prisoners, whom they were to transfer to Belle—Isle, to work at a fortress. About an hour after arrived thirty or forty more of these soldiers. An order from the committee was produced for the delivery of one hundred and fifty five of my prisoners. I observed to them, that se∣veral of the prisoners on the list were now at liberty, or in the hospitals.</P>
<P>They now set down to table, and after having supped, and drank heartily, they brought out their cords, and diverted them∣selves
<PB N="77" REF="030205_0075_0FE51299E0749BE8"/>
a while in tying each other, as they intended to tie the prisoners. I then con∣ducted them to the rooms where the prison∣ers were lodged. They instantly fall to work tying the poor trembling wretches two and two.</P>
<P>Grand-Maison now entered the court yard, and hollowed out to them to dispatch. Goullin came stamping and swearing, because the number on the list could not be com∣pleated. There were so many sick and dead that they could not well be made up. I sent you fifteen this evening, says Goullin, what have you done with them? I told him they were up-stairs. Down with them, says he. I obeyed, and they were tied, like the rest. Instead of one hundred and fifty five, Goullin at last consented to take one hun∣dred and twenty nine; but this number not being complete, the equitable and tender-hearted Goullin orders the remainder to be taken from the prisoners indistinctly; and when this was done he marches off at the head of the assassins to conduct them to the river, where they were all drowned.</P>

<P>We were in want of every necessary. Seven hundred of us were confined in this house, which, even as a prison was too small for two hundred. Forty were crammed in∣to one little chamber.

busy constructing the lighters for drowning the prisoners; and soon after, says the wit∣ness, I saw, brought to be drowned at the Crepuscule, a great number of women, many of whom had sucking children in their arms. They screamed and cried most piteously. Oh! said they, must we be put to death without being heard!</P>
<P>Several poor women of the neighbour∣hood ran and took a child a piece, and some two, from them. Upon this the poor crea∣tures shrieked and tore their hair worse than before.—Oh! my dear, my love, my darl∣ing babe! am I never to see your dear face again! Heavens protect my poor dear little love!—Such heart-piercing cries were sure∣ly never before heard! yet these could not soften the hell-hounds that conducted them.</P>
<P>Many of these women were far advanced with child. All were taken into the boats; a part were immediately dispatched, and the rest put on board the Dutch sloop, till the next day.</P>
<P>When the next day arrived, says the wit∣ness, though we were all terror-struck, ma∣ny had the courage to ask for a child a piece of those that were left alive; but the hard hearted villain, Fouquet, refused, pretend∣ing his orders were changed, and all that remained on board the sloop were drowned.</P>

<P>The same witness says: One day I saw several prisoners, brought from the <HI>Entrepot,</HI> deposited in a lighter with a neck. They were fastened under hatches, where they were left for forty eight hours. When the hatches were opened, they were sixty of them stiffled. Other prisoners that were now on board were obliged to take out the bodies. Robin stood on the deck with his drawn sword in his hand, and superintended the work. This done, all the prisoners on board were stripped naked, men, women and children of all ages from fourscore to five; their hands were tied behind them, and they were thrown into the river.</P>
<P>Here the judge, if we ought to call a sans∣culotte ruffian a judge, asked the witness if this drowning was performed by day, or by night. By open day, answers the witness. She adds, I observed that the drowners be∣came very familiar with the prettiest of the women; and some few of them were saved, if it can be called saving, to endure the more than infernal embraces of these mon∣sters.</P>

<P>The prisoners on their trial, having de∣nied here, that they had given orders for the drownings, several of their orders were produced, and read. It may not be amiss to insert two or three of them. They will give the reader a perfect idea of the mur∣derer's style.</P>

<P><HI>Bourdin,</HI> a witness, gives an account of several shootings. The last that I saw, adds he, was of eighty women. They were first shot, then stripped, and left exposed on the spot during three days.</P>
<P>I carried a young lad off from the <HI>Entre∣pot.</HI> He was thirteen years of age. When the revolutionary committee ordered all the children, thus preserved to be given up, Jolly, who said he was the judge of all the prisoners, permitted me to keep this boy; but my neighbour Aignes, who could not obtain a like favour, gave up a lad of four∣teen years of age, agreeable to the order of the committee, and the next day we saw him shot.</P>
<P>When the shooting <HI>en masse</HI> first began the prisoners were suffered to retain their cloths till they were dead. As they were
<PB N="99" REF="030205_0097_0FE512C0B96F3770"/>
conducted to the place of execution, and even after they arrived on the spot, the old-cloths dealers were seen bargaining with the soldiers for their cloths. The poor unfor∣tunate creatures had the mortification to see their own towns-men and women buying the poor remains of their fortunes on their backs; and, the instant they fell, the mon∣sters rushed in, tearing the new-acquired property from their bodies, yet struggling in the pangs of death.—But, the revolution∣ary butchers found that this was but an un∣productive sale: the cloths being shot through sunk their value; and this circum∣stance determined them to strip the prisoners naked before execution.</P>

<HI>aristocrats;</HI> but as for the true sans-culottes, they had nothing to fear.</P>
<P><HI>Bachelier</HI> (VOL. III. PAGE 31) <HI>All the rich</HI> were <HI>suspected persons.</HI> We were oblig∣ed to strike, not only them who <HI>did,</HI> but them who <HI>could do</HI> harm.

<P>One day, says a witness, I begged Bache∣lier to have mercy on the little children. I pleaded their innocence, and represented their infancy, and the injustice of punish∣ing them for the faults of their parents. Bachelier answered coolly, if I did not know you, I should take you for an aristo∣crat. You do not perceive then, that these children have sucked aristocratic milk; that the blood that runs in their veins is impure, and incapable of being changed into repub∣lican blood? I compare them, added he, to an oil-barrel, which, in spite of all the wash∣ing and scrubbing you can give it, will for ever retain its stink. It is just so with these
<PB N="105" REF="030205_0103_0FE5132F712E1A68"/>
children. They will always retain an at∣tachment to the kings and priests of their fathers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VOL. III. PAGE 104.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Bachelier</HI> answers to this. With respect, says he, to the children of the aristocrats, I own that I said, they were hard to be made good republicans; and that it was much to be feared, that the children of fanaticks would <HI>one day</HI> resemble their parents. Re∣nard, mayor of Nantz, who is known for a sound patriot and a <HI>humane man,</HI> said on this subject, that the <HI>cats</HI> eat the <HI>young rats,</HI> and that they were in the right of it; for it was the only way of destroying the breed. I am persuaded, adds Bachelier, that no true republican will blame me for saying and thinking like Renard, who was a most ex∣cellent patriot.</P>
<P>There was, it seems, another reason for murdering the aristocrats; for when the proposal was made for killing them <HI>en masse,</HI> Robin said (VOL. III. PAGE 85) the patriots are <HI>in want of bread;</HI> it is just that those scoun∣drels should perish, and not <HI>eat up our victuals from us.</HI>—Kermen opposed this; but Robin exclaimed, none of your <HI>moderate</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="030205_0104_0FE512CE248C81A0"/>
propositions here. I say, they are a parcel of aristocrats that wish to overturn the re∣public, therefore let them die.</P>

<P><HI>Crespin,</HI> one of the company of Marat, informs the tribunal, that he was at a drowning on board a lighter, where the prisoners were fastened down under boards, nailed from side to side. They uttered, says he, the most piteous cries. Some of them put their hands folded in a supplicating pos∣ture, through the openings between the boards; and I saw the members of the com∣mittee chop off those hands and fingers. One of them plunged his sabre down in amongst the prisoners, and we heard a man cry out, oh! the rascal! he has stabbed me! —Our ears, adds the witness, were now stunned with the cry of, oh! you rascally, brutal savages! this is the mercy, this the humanity of republicans!</P>
<P>One day, continues this witness, we saw Carrier in a coach at the foot of the guillo∣tine, enjoying the spectacle, while about twenty persons were beheaded.—Naud was with me, who went up to Carrier with me, and asked him, if he did not want a Marat.
<PB N="107" REF="030205_0105_0FE51330F8D4D018"/>
Yes, b—ger, says Carrier. I am your man then, said Naud.</P>
<P>The new Marat was dispatched to call the <HI>judges</HI> to the representative of the people; and when Philippes ventured to tell him that, among those whom he had ordered to the guillotine from the Bouffay, there were two children of fourteen years of age, and two others of thirteen, Carrier fell in a violent passion; damned b—gers, says he, in what country am I got? <HI>All milk-hearted rascals alike!</HI></P>

Here we found the mother and four daughters lying close to each other upon some wet and filthy straw; and round about them there were several dead women. The youngest daugh∣ter, whom alone we had obtained permission to take was covered up in her mothers gown to keep her warm.—When we told the poor mother our errand; no, said she, my child shall stay and die with myself; we have lived, and we will die together.—We thought ourselves justified, adds the witness, in using force. When the mother perceiv∣ed our resolution, she uttered such dreadful lamentations as are impossible to be describ∣ed. My child! oh! my dear, darling child! were the last words her daughter ever heard from her. The child never recovered the

<P><HI>Saudroc.</HI> At a great dinner, to which Lambertye, the chief murderer, invited Carrier, I was a witness of a most scanda∣lous scene. After the repast was over, and while the glass went round, Lambertye en∣tertained us with a long and full account of a drowning he had performed the night be∣fore, and boasted of the manner in which he sabred the poor wretches that attempted to escape. All the <HI>convives,</HI> adds the wit∣ness, honoured his valour with long and re∣peated bursts of applause.—Carrier toasted the <HI>national bath.</HI>—This monster talked of no∣thing but death and the guillotine.</P>
<P>Another witness says (VOL. III. PAGE 123.) I saw Carrier, with his drawn sword in his hand, threatening to guillotine the first person, who should dare to show the least pity for the prisoners that were con∣ducted to execution.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="030205_0110_0FE512DE935A6C08"/>And another (VOL. II.) says: Carrier came one day to look at the lighters that were constructing for the drownings, and turning to Foucault: charmingly commo∣dious indeed! says he. Do you hear? add∣ed he, pay these lads well for their labour.</P>

<P>An old man appeared at the bar. I attest, says he, that I was ill-treated by the revolu∣tionary committee, because I requested the release of a young girl who was entirely in∣nocent. The committee told me that I had no business to meddle with any such people. My nephew and my son-in-law were shot for no crime whatever; and, adds the old man, I had the grief to see my own chil∣dren dragged from my house to the fatal lighters. One of them made an attempt to escape from the hands of his barbarous ex∣ecutioners, was caught and shot.</P>
<P>I dare say the reader is ready to weep for this poor distressed father; but let him re∣serve his tears for more worthy objects. This old man was a murderer like the rest,

and his own family had fallen into the pit he had dug for another.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Marat.</HEAD>
<P>The name of Marat has been so often mentioned, it may not be improper, or out of place, to give the reader here some ac∣count of that famous cut-throat.</P>
<P>Before the Revolution, he was an ob∣scure beggarly fellow, that was daily liable to be brought before the officer of police to give an account of the manner in which he got his bread. But, when this grand event took place; when murderers were wanted in every quarter of the country, he began to cut a figure on the scene. He published a gazette, in which he inculcated the necessity of lopping off the heads of thousands at a time, and of watering, as he called it, the tree of liberty with the blood of the aristocrats, as the only means of rendering it fruitful.</P>
<P>These, and such like sentiments, recom∣mended him to the notice of his country∣men;
<PB N="116" REF="030205_0114_0FE512E28C7B05C8"/>
he obtained their confidence, and was one of the <HI>organizers</HI> (to use a french term) of the massacres of the 2nd and 3rd of September, 1792, of which I have spoken in the first chapter of this work. On this occasion he was an actor also, and is said to have cut above fifty throats with his own hands.</P>
<P>It would have been something unjust if a man like this had been forgotten, when the Convention was to assemble. He was not. The people of Paris, who had been eye-witnesses of his merit, chose him for one of their representatives; and he was faithful in the execution of his trust; for he never talked about any thing but of throats to cut, stabbing, and guillotining.</P>
<P>His career, however, was but short. His own neck was not made of iron: a despe∣rate woman, who had adopted his princi∣ples, rushed into his apartment, and deli∣vered the world of one of the greatest mon∣sters that ever dishonoured it.</P>
<P>There was something horrible in the look of this villain. He was very short and thick, had a black beard ascending nearly to the extreme corners of his eyes. This beard was usually long, and his hair short, sticking up like bristles. He had ever been dirty, and it may be imagined, that the fashions of a revolution which has made it
<PB N="117" REF="030205_0115_0FE51340DD10B450"/>
a <HI>crime</HI> to be <HI>well-dressed,</HI> had not improved his appearance: in short, he was at the very best, a most disgusting mortal, and, there∣fore, when he came out of the prison of La Force, all covered with filth and gore, wielding a pistol in one hand and a dagger in the other, no wonder that even the san∣guinary mob ran back for fear.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Charlotte Cordée.</HEAD>
<P>As I have entered on a digression, I will continue it a little longer, to give the rea∣der an account of the execution of Char∣lotte Cordée, the young woman that mur∣dered Marat.</P>
<P>She was not what is commonly called an aristocrat; but a patriot of another faction than Marat. She was, as it is said, em∣ployed by the party of Brissot, who, from the accomplishments of Marat, were affraid that he would totally engross the favour and affections of the people. Poor Charlotte received her reward on the scaffold; and a very just reward too; but there is some∣thing so shocking in the behaviour of her executioner, that it ought not to be omitted in a collection of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="030205_0116_0FE512EADB656D80"/>She was a beautiful young woman; ex∣tremely fair; and, in any other country, would have brought tears of compassion from the spectators. The executioner, after having cut off her head, seized it by the fine long hair, and, holding it up by one hand, the brutal ruffian gave her a slap in the face with the other. <Q>The bitch blushes, cried he, at any rate.</Q> This trait of hangman wit, excited the savage mirth of the populace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is something very remarkable that her face, se∣vered from the body, should blush; but it is a real fact, as appears from an essay lately republished at Philadelphia, in Gatreau's gazette.</NOTE></P>
<P>We must now return to Nantz, where we shall find the revolutionary committee em∣ployed in writing to their friends at Paris.</P>
<P>Before they began to drown and shoot by hundreds, they had seized on the persons of one hundred and thirty two of the most oppulent men in the city, and sent them off to Paris to be tried as <HI>suspected persons.</HI> It appears, from the whole course of the evi∣dence on this head, that the detachment of patriots who conducted them, were, if any pretence could be found, to murder them all by the way. This, however, did not
<PB N="119" REF="030205_0117_0FE5134B9D1D56B0"/>
happen. The prisoners arrived safe at Paris, and the committee were obliged to have re∣course to other means, to prevent their re∣turn. The one that they adopted was to insure their guillotining at Paris; and, for this purpose, they wrote to the revolu∣tionary committee of the the section of Lepelletier.—Their letter is, and I hope it ever will be, a curiosity in this country.

<P>The people of Nantz, whom we have sent to Paris, are big villains, all marked with the seal of reprobation, and known for counter-revolutionists. We are collecting proofs against them, which we shall send, when the bundle is made up, to the revolu∣tinary judges. In the mean time, we <HI>de∣nounce</HI> to you, Julienne, who has <HI>officiously</HI> taken upon him the defence of these <HI>uncivic</HI> vermin.</P>

<P>From the moment the revolutionary com∣mittee was installed, says <HI>Benét,</HI> the impri∣sonments began; and they augmented dai∣ly. They were all dictated by animosity, hatred, or avarice. To such a degree did terror prevail, that every man trembled for his life.</P>
<P>For my part, says the witness, my reso∣lution was taken. I always went with two loaded pistols in my pockets: one for the villain that should offer to seize me, and the other for myself. Cruel expectation, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man who had a small helpless family. But, I had seen six hundred men at one time plunged into the water, and had been a witness of shootings amounting to three thousand six hundred persons at the Gigan: after this what could any man hope for.</P>
<P>There is reason to believe, that Carrier meant to murder the whole city; for, be∣fore his journey to Paris, he told one of the women whom he kept, and <HI>whose husband he had put to death,</HI> that he would make Nantz remember the name of Carrier: do not fear, <HI>my dear,</HI> said he, all my friends shall follow me; but as for the city it shall be destroyed (PAGE 219)</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="030205_0119_0FE5134D26269DE8"/>I was, one day, adds the same witness, sent by Bowin to see some bodies buried, that were left on the public square. There were upwards of thirty women all naked, and exposed with the most horrible indecen∣cy.</P>

<P><HI>Fontaine.</HI> I went one day to a prison where a great many women and children were confined. My business was to deliver provisions to these people; but I found nei∣ther fire, lights, nor any thing else. I cal∣led for a candle in order to enter this abode of horror. The prisoners were lying here and there on the bare boards, though it was extremely cold.</P>
<P>In a second visit that I made here, I found the poor unhappy creatures in a worse situation than before. I saw a wo∣man lying dead, and a sucking child, at a little distance from her, wallowing about in the filth. Its little face was absolutely covered with ordure. I gave the keeper ten livres to take care of this helpless infant, till I could find a nurse; but when I came for it, it was gone; and Dumey told me, that
<PB N="122" REF="030205_0120_0FE512EFC1BEB760"/>
the English prisoners had taken the child, with a promise to do well by it.</P>
<P>It seems, from the evidence of several wit∣nesses, that, while these villains were but∣chering, or stiffling their own countrymen, they took care to treat foreign prisoners with some sort of humanity. This distincti∣on fully proves, that they acted by authori∣ty of the Convention. But we shall see this so incontestibly proved by-and-by, that the remark is hardly necessary here.</P>

<P>I saw, says the same witness, a man, na∣med Gorgo, come and ask for a little boy, that he said he had obtained permission to take. The child was found behind a bundle of stuff, where he had run to hide upon hear∣ing voices. Gorgo brought him to the door-way, and made him <HI>dance and sing.</HI></P>
<P>I have selected this last fact to show to what a pitch of obduracy, of unfeeling in∣difference, these people were arrived. A thousand volumes could not paint their fa∣miliarity with scenes of horror so well as this trifling circumstance of making a child dance and sing, at the entrance of a cave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of despair, a human slaughter house, where

<P><HI>Chaux,</HI> one of the criminals, informs the tribunal, that he was dispatched from Nantz to wait on Carrier, during his stay at Paris. He told me, says Chaux, that he did not like Philippes, and that we should guillotine him, at my return.—I have communicated, says Carrier, all our proceedings to the National Convention.— You must not, adds he, try Lambertye: he is too precious a patriot. I intend to send for him here, and present him to the committee of <HI>public preservation (salut pub∣lic)</HI> who will not leave him unrecompensed for his services.</P>
<P><HI>Jicquieau</HI> says (PAGE 273.) that Lam∣bertye was the <HI>chief murderer.</HI>—This it was that made him a <HI>precious patriot,</HI> and a man worthy of reward from a committee of the National Convention.</P>
<P>This witness adds: when the committee of Nantz was first installed, a deputation was sent to Carrier, to let him know that no proofs could be made out against Jom∣ard.
<PB N="124" REF="030205_0122_0FE512F151F34A88"/>
The representative of the people, see∣ing the deputation enter, cried out, what are all these b—gers come here for? When he heard our business, to hell with you, says he, you fool. But, seeming to grew a little calm, he called me back into his room, and threatened to throw me out of the window. At last, says the witness, he told me there were other means besides guillotining; you have only, says he, to send Jomard into the country, and have him dispatched secretly.</P>
<P>Here we behold a member of the Nation∣al Convention of France; one of those <HI>phi∣losophical</HI> legislators, who call themselves the <HI>enlighteners</HI> of the universe. This base, this cowardly cut-throat, this assassin-general, is one of those men, whom we have been told, are to <HI>regenerate</HI> mankind, and to establish a system of universal <HI>humanity!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Fontaine</HI> informs the tribunal, that he was one night at the <HI>Entrepot.</HI> Here, says the witness I saw a little man (this afterwards appears to have been Fouquet) wearing pantaloons, and a liberty cap. It is I, said the little monster, who conduct all the drownings; it is I who give the word of command to pull up the plugs; nothing is done without my or∣ders. If you will come along with me, con∣tinued he, I will show you how to feed upon the flesh of an aristocrat; I will regale you with the brains of those rascals.—I trembled, says the witness, and got away from this cannibal as soon as I could.</P>

<P><HI>Fontbonne</HI> informs the tribunal, that he was one day invited to a dinner, in a plea∣sure garden belonging to Ducrois. Carrier
<PB N="126" REF="030205_0124_0FE512FAD14E7F08"/>
and O'Sullivan were of the party. The conversation turned on the bodily strength of certain persons, when O'Sullivan ob∣served; "yes, there was my brother, who was devilish strong, particularly in the neck, for the executioner was obliged to give him the second stroke with the <HI>national razor,</HI> before he could get his head off."</P>
<P>The witness adds, O'Sullivan told us, that he was going to drown a man much stronger than himself; that the man resist∣ed, but was knocked down; then, says O'Sullivon, I took my knife and struck him, as butchers do the sheep.</P>
<P><HI>Guedon</HI> informs the tribunal (vol. IV. page 277) that he was at the same dinner, mentioned by Fontbonne. I was seated, says this witness, by the side of O'Sullivan; and, during the repast, he held up his knife to me, and said, this is excellent to cut a man's throat with; adding, that it had al∣ready done him good service in that way. He called on Robin as a witness of his bra∣very, and told us the manner in which he proceeded.—I had remarked, says O'Sulli∣van, that the butchers killed the sheep by plunging their knife in underneath the ear; so, when I had a mind to kill a prisoner, I came up to him, and, clapping him on the shoulder in a jocular way, pointed to some object that he was obliged to turn his head
<PB N="127" REF="030205_0125_0FE5135C11813B50"/>
to see; the moment he did this, I had my knife through his neck.</P>
<P>This O'Suilivan, in his defence, says, that, as to his brother, he was an enemy of the Republic. When he saw, says this human butcher, that there was no hope for him, he came and threw himself into my arms; but, <HI>like a good republican,</HI> I gave him up to the guillotine.</P>

<P>A witness says, that Goullin beat his own father with a stick, when the old man was on his death-bed; and adds, that his father died in two hours after.</P>
<P>This same Goullin (VOL. II. PAGE 253) said in the tribune of his club. take care not to admit among you moderate men, half pa∣triots. Admit none but real revolutionists; none but patriots who have the courage to drink a glass of human blood, warm from the veins.</P>
<P>Goullin, so far from denying this, says before the tribunal (PAGE 254) that he glo∣ries in thinking like Marat, who would wil∣lingly have quenched his thirst with the blood of the aristocrats.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="030205_0126_0FE51300EAF27220"/>I shall conclude this chapter, this fright∣ful tragedy exhibited at Nantz, with the re∣lation of a few traits of diabolical cruelty, which not only surpass all that the imagina∣tion has hitherto been able to conceive, but even all that has been related in this vo∣lume.

<P><HI>Lailet</HI> deposes, that Deron came to the popular society with a man's ear, pinned to the national cockade, which he wore in his cap. He went about, says the witness, with a pocket full of these ears, which he made the female prisoners kiss. If I were not afraid, adds the witness, of for ever blackening the page of our history, I would

here relate a fact, that calls down tenfold vengeance on the head of this monster.</P>
<P>The witness is ordered to proceed.</P>
<P>This same Deron, adds the witness, car∣ried about him a handful of private parts, which he had cut from the men whom he had murdered; and these he showed to the women, whenever an occasion offered.</P>
<P>This last trait, abominable as it is, might have been mentioned <HI>in a Paris tribunal,</HI> without that ceremony which the witness made use of; for even the <HI>women of Paris</HI> had set Deron the example. Their knives had been exercised on the dead bodies of the Swisses, who were killed at the king's castle on the 10th of August, 1792. On that very 10th of August which has so often been celebrated on this continent.</P>

<P>Many of the generals in La Vendee, says Forget, made it their glory to imitate the horrid butchers at Nantz. They commit∣ted unheard of cruelties and indecencies. General Duquesnoy murdered several in∣fants at the breast, and afterwards attempted to lie with the mothers; but not being able

<P>The reader's curiosity may, perhaps, lead him to wish to know the whole number of persons put to death at Nantz; but, in this, it would be difficult to gratify him. I have been able to obtain but <HI>five volumes</HI> of the trial, which make only a part of that work; probably the last volume may contain an exact account as to numbers. The deaths must, however, have been immense, since a witness deposes (VOL. III. PAGE 55) to the drowning of <HI>nine thousand</HI> persons; and ano∣ther witness (VOL. II. PAGE 253) attests, that <HI>seven thousand five hundred</HI> were shot <HI>en masse.</HI></P>
<P>The number of bodies thrown into the river Loire, which is half the width of the Delaware at Philadelphia, was so consider∣able, that the municipal officers sound it ne∣cessary

to issue a proclamation (VOL. V. PAGE 70) <HI>forbidding the use of its waters.</HI></P>
<P>It has been generally computed that the number of persons, belonging to this unfor∣tunate city and its environs, who were drowned, shot <HI>en masse,</HI> guillotined, and stifled or starved in prison, amounted to about <HI>forty</HI> thousand. And, this computa∣tion is corroborated by the author of <HI>La Conjuration,</HI> who says (PAGE 159.) The number of persons murdered in the south of France, during the space of a very few months, is reckoned at a hundred thousand. The bodies thrown into the Loire are innu∣merable. Carrier alone put to death <HI>more than forty thousand,</HI> including men, women and children.</P>
<P>It appears, then, that these bloody revolu∣tionists, who stiled themselves the friends of freedom and of mankind, destroyed, in one city of France, a population equal to that of the capital of the United States.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Facts from several works, proving that the cruelties related in the preceding chapters, were authorized, or approved of by the Na∣tional Assemblies.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER having led the reader through such rivers of blood, it seems indis∣pensably necessary to insert a few facts, showing by whose authority that blood was spilt; for, it could answer no good purpose to excite his detestation, without directing it towards the proper object.</P>
<P>When the French first began that career of insurrection, robbery and murder, which assumed the name of a Revolution, the peo∣ple of this country, or at least the most numerous part of them, felt uncommon anxiety for its success. The people were deceived; but the deception was an agree∣able one; the word <HI>Revolution</HI> had of itself very great charms, but when that of <HI>Liber∣ty</HI> was added to it, it could not fail of ex∣citing enthusiasm. This enthusiasm was, in∣deed, nearly general; and this alone was a sufficient inducement for the public prints to become the partizans of Condorcet and Mi∣rabeau. All the avenues to truth were at
<PB N="134" REF="030205_0133_0FE5130DAEB36608"/>
once barred up; and, though the revolu∣tionists every day changed their creed, though one revolving moon saw them make and break their oaths, all was amply atoned for by their being engaged in a Revolution.</P>
<P>As the Revolution advanced the enthu∣siasm increased; but from the moment that the French nation declared itself a <HI>Republic,</HI> this enthusiasm was changed to madness. All the means by which this change of go∣vernment was to be accomplished were to∣tally overlooked; nothing was talked or dreamed of but the enfranchisement of the world; the whole universe was to become a republic, or be annihilated; and happy was he who could bawl loudest about a certain something, called <HI>liberty and equality.</HI></P>
<P>During this political madness, however, now and then a trait of shocking barbarity, in spite of all the endeavours of the public pa∣pers, burst in upon us, and produced a lu∣cid interval; but these intervals have never yet been of long duration; because every subterfuge, that interested falsehood can de∣vise, has been made use of to give our abhor∣rence a direction contrary to that which it ought to have taken. We have heard Brissot, Danton, Marat, and Robespierre, all accused in their turns of shedding inno∣cent blood; but the <HI>National Assembly</HI> itself, they tell us has ever remained worthy of
<PB N="135" REF="030205_0134_0FE5136DE759BEE8"/>
our admiration. The poor unsuccessful agents of this terrible divan have been de∣voted to execration, as tyrants, while their employers have been, and are yet held up to us as the friends of liberty and the lovers of mankind.</P>
<P>Without further remark, I shall add such facts as, I imagine, will enable every reader to judge for himself.</P>
<P>To begin with the constituent assembly; one proof of their approving of murder will suffice. They honoured with the title of <HI>vanquishers,</HI> a blood-thirsty mob, who after having taken two men prisoners, cruelly massacred them, and carried their heads about the streets of Paris on a pike. <HI>See Rabaud's history of the French Revolution</HI> page 106.</P>
<P>The second Assembly, when they received advices of the murders of Jourdan and his associates at Avignon, as mentioned in the first chapter of this work, threatened the member who communicated the news, be∣cause he had called the murderers <HI>brigands,</HI> and not <HI>patriots.</HI> See <HI>La Gazette Universet∣le</HI> for the month of May 1792.—And, how did this Assembly behave, when informed of the massacres in the prisons of Paris, du∣ring the first days of September, 1792? <HI>Tallien</HI> (of whom we have lately heard so
<PB N="136" REF="030205_0135_0FE513116AB4B570"/>
much) came to the National Assembly, and informed them of the murdering in the fol∣lowing remarkable words: <Q>The commis∣saries have done all they could to pre∣vent the <HI>disorders</HI> (the massacreing the pri∣soners is what he calls <HI>disorders</HI>) but they have not been able to stop the, in some sort, <HI>Just vengeance</HI> of the people.</Q>—The As∣sembly heard this language very quietly, and Doctor Moore, from whose journal (page 178) the fact is taken, makes an apology for the Assembly, by saying that they were <HI>overawed;</HI> but it has since fully appeared, that the leading members were the very per∣sons who contrived the massacre, with the aid of Petion, Manuel, and Marat.—It is a well known fact, recorded by the Abbé Barruel (page 334) that <HI>Louvet,</HI> one of the members of the present Assembly, gave, the day after the September massacre, an order on the public treasury, in the following words: <Q>On sight, pay to the four bearers each twelve livres, for aiding in the dis∣patching of the priests at the prison of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Firmin.</Q>—Louvet was, at the time of writing this note on demand for murderer's wages, a <HI>legislator;</HI> and I cannot help re∣marking here, that a printer of a news-pa∣per in the United States, has lately boasted, that this Louvet, "now president of the first Assembly on earth," says our printer,
<PB N="137" REF="030205_0136_0FE5136F707015E0"/>
was <HI>the editor of a gazette!</HI>—People should be cautious how they boast of relationship with the legislators in that country of equa∣lity.</P>
<P>As it will no longer be pretended, I sup∣pose, that this second Assembly disapproved of the murders that were committed under their reign, I will now turn to the third Assembly, which we commonly call a Con∣vention. And, not to tire the reader with proofs of what is self evident, I shall confine myself to an extract or two from the trial of Carrier and the revolutionary committee of Nantz.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VOL. V. PAGE 49.</HEAD>
<P>It is time, says Goullin, to tear aside the veil. The representatives Bourbotte and Bo knew all about the drownings and shoot∣ings; and Bo even said to Huchet, in∣speaking of the members of the revolutiona∣ry committee, that it was <HI>not for the murders</HI> that they were to be tried.</P>
<P>After this the counsellor for the commit∣tee asks this citizen Bo, what was the real motive for bringing the committee to trial; and the other confesses, that it was for their having <HI>misapplied the treasures</HI> taken from
<PB N="138" REF="030205_0137_0FE5131300AE9B38"/>
the prisoners. He pretends (page 60) though he had taken the place of Carrier at Nantz, and though the water of the river could not be drank, on account of the dead bodies that were floating on it; though a hundred or two of ditches had been dug to put the people into that were shot, and though the city was filled with cries and lamentations; notwithstanding all this, he pretends that he could say nothing, for cer∣tain, <HI>about the murders.</HI></P>
<P>This representative Bo (page 83.) is convicted of having himself justified the con∣duct of the committee and of Carrier.</P>
<P>Carrier, in his defence, says, that he had done no more than <HI>his duty,</HI> and that <HI>the Convention had been regularly informed of eve∣ry thing.</HI> They complain now, says he (page 119 of shootings <HI>en masse,</HI> as if <HI>the same had not been done at Angers, Saumur, Laval, and every where else.</HI>)</P>
<P>A witness (VOL. 5. PAGE 60.) informs the tribunal, that he, who was himself a member of the Convention, <HI>had informed that body of all the horrors that were commit∣ted at Nantz,</HI> and particularly of the <HI>massa∣cres of women and children.</HI></P>
<P>The author of <HI>La Conjuration,</HI> so often quoted says (page 162.) When the bloo∣dy Carrier wrote to the Convention that he was dispatching hundreds at a time by
<PB REF="030205_0138_0FE51314898A4A90"/>

means of lighters with plugs in the bottom, Carrier was not blamed; on the contrary, he was <HI>repeatedly applauded,</HI> as being the author of <HI>an invention that did honour to his country!</HI></P>
<P>But, what need have we of these proofs? What other testimony do we want, than that contained in their own murderous de∣crees? Let any one cast his eye on the op∣posite page; let him there behold the scene that was daily exhibited before the windows of their hall, and then let him say whether they delighted in murder or not. Blood is their element, as water is that of the finny race.</P>
<P>One thing, however, remains to be ac∣counted for; and that is, how so great a part of the nation were led to butcher each other; how they were brought to that pitch of brutal sanguinary ferocity, which we have seen so amply displayed in the preceed∣ing Chapters. This is what, with the rea∣der's indulgence, I shall now agreeable to my promise, endeavour to explain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN INSTRUCTIVE ESSAY,</HI> Tracing all the horrors of the French Revolu∣tion to their real causes, the licentious Poli∣tics and infidel Philosophy of the present Age.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the French were an amiable people the whole civilized world has given abundant testimony, by endeavouring to imitate them. There was not a nation in Europe but had, in some degree, adopt∣ed their language and their fashions; and all those individuals, belonging even to their haughty rival enemy, who travelled in their country, were led by an involun∣tary impulse into an imitation of their manners.</P>
<P>The prominent feature in their national character was, it is true, <HI>levity;</HI> but, though levity and ferociousness may, and often do, meet in the same person, no writer, that I recollect, had ever accused the French of being cruel. If we are to judge of their
<PB N="141" REF="030205_0141_0FE513797688CCD8"/>
disposition by their national sports and en∣tertainments, we shall find no room to draw a conclusion against their humanity. These cruel diversions, where men become the bullies of brute creatures, and laugh at see∣ing them goad, and bite, and tear each other to pieces, were never known in France. Even in their theatrical performances a dead body was never exhibited on the scene: such a spectacle was thought to be too much for the feelings of the audience. The works of their favourite authors generally breathe the greatest tenderness and humanity. The nation that could produce, and admire, a Marmontel and a Racine, could not be na∣turally bloody-minded.</P>

<P>These verses, extracted from the most elegant of poems, dictated by the bests of hearts, contain the justest character of the French nation, that I have ever yet seen. To this character I am ready to subscribe: for, I too have been charmed with their gentle manners and their social ease: I too have felt the power of those arts which endear mind to mind: I have been a witness of their urbanity, their respectful deference and attention to the softer sex, their paternal tenderness, and their veneration for old age.</P>
<P>Whence, then, the mighty, the dread∣ful change? What is it that has transfor¦med a great portion of this airy humane people into a horde of sullen assassins? What is it that has converted these thought∣less realms; this gay sprightly land of mirth, this bright domain, into a gloomy wilder∣ness watered with rivers of human blood? This ought to be the great object of our en∣quiries:
<PB N="143" REF="030205_0143_0FE5137E240AE5F0"/>
this ought to fix all our attention. Without determining this point, we can draw no profit from the preceding relation, and, without attempting it, I should have undertaken the unpleasant task of holding the French people up to reproach and de∣testation to no manner of purpose.</P>
<P>It has been asserted, again and again, by the partizans of the French revolution, that all the crimes which have disgraced it, are to be ascribed to the hostile operations of their enemies. They have told us, that, had not the Austrians and Prussians been on their march to Paris, the prisoners would not have been massacred, on the 2nd and 3rd of September, 1792. But, can we possibly conceive how the murder of 8,000 poor prisoners, locked up and bound, could be necessary to the defence of a Capital, containing a million of inhabitants? Can we believe that the sabres of the assassins would not have been more effectually em∣ployed against the invaders, than against de∣fenceless priests and women. The deluded populace were told not <Q>to leave the wol∣ves in the fold while they went to at∣tack those that were without.</Q> But these wolves, if they were such, were in prison; were under a guard an hundred thousand times as strong as themselves, and could have been destroyed at a moment's
<PB N="144" REF="030205_0144_0FE51321353C8270"/>
warning. There is something so abomina∣bly cowardly in this justification, that it is even more base than the crime. Suppose that a hundred thousand men had marched from Paris, to make head against the Austrians and Prussians, there were yet nine hundred thousand left to guard the unhappy wretch∣es that were tied hand and foot. Where could be the necessity of massacreing them! Where could be the necessity of hacking them to pieces, tearing out their bowels, and biting their hearts?</P>
<P>Subsequent events have fully proved, that it was not danger that produced these bloody measures: for, we have ever seen the revolutionists most cruel in times of their greatest security. Their butcheries at Lyons and in its neighbourhood did not be∣gin, till they were completely triumphant. It was then, at the moment when they had no retaliation to fear, that they commenced their bloody work. Carrier, lolling at at his ease, sent the victims to death by hun∣dreds. The blood never flowed from the guillotine in such torrents, as at the very time when their armies were driving their enemies before them in every direction.</P>
<P>Charles Fox (who, by the bye, would not have made a bad cut-throat general) Charles Fox had the folly and impudence to say, in the British House of Commons,
<PB N="145" REF="030205_0145_0FE5137FD06A4540"/>
that the massacres in France ought to be attributed to the Allied Powers. <Q>You hunt them like wild beasts,</Q> said this hu∣mane and honest swindler, <Q>and then you complain of them for being ferocious.</Q> How this hunting, as Fox calls it, could drive the French to butcher one another, I cannot see; but if it was a justifiable reason for them, it might certainly be applied with much more justice to their enemies; for these have been oftener obliged to fly than the French. The revolutionary armies have overrun an extent of territory equal to one third of their own country: the Savoyards, the Germans, the Flemings, the Dutch, the Spaniards, and the English, have been obliged to fly before them; but we have heard of no massacres among these people. The French most unmercifully put to death eight thousand of their country people, who were in the prisons of Paris, and, as an ex∣cuse for this, they tell us that the Duke of Brunswick had invaded the province of Champagne; but they themselves have overrun all the United Netherlands, and even taken possession of the capital; and we have not heard, that the Dutch have as yet been guilty of a single massacre. They have found but one place in all their ca∣reer, where the people could be prevailed on to erect a guillotine, and that was at
<PB N="146" REF="030205_0146_0FE513815815C968"/>
Geneva. Here their army was more nu∣merous than the whole population of the state, and therefore their system was fully adopted; yet even here, among this little debased and tyranized people, there were to be found no villains infamous enough to imitate their masters in murdering women and children. That was a species of slaught∣er reserved for the French nation alone.</P>
<P>The French revolution has been com∣pared to that of America, and I have heard some men, calling themselves Americans, who have not been ashamed to say, that as great cruelties were committed in this coun∣try as in that. I would now ask these men, who are so anxious to be thought as bloo∣dy as the sans-culotte French, if they can give me one instance of the Americans mur∣dering their towns-men at the approach of the enemy? When the British army suc∣ceeded that of the Congress at Philadelphia, did the continental troops murder all the Tories, before they quitted the city? Can these generous friends of the French revo∣lution tell us of any massacres that took place in this country? Did they ever hear of women and children being drowned and shot by hundreds? Seven years of civil war desolated these states; but the blood of one single woman or child never stained the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="030205_0147_0FE513EAD2682C68"/>If the doctrine of the prosligate Charles Fox be admitted, if a people be justifiable in entering on a series of massacres, the in∣stant they are pressed by an enemy from without, what safety can there be for any of us? If a declaration of war is to unsheath the daggers of all the assassins in the com∣munity, civil society is the greatest curse that ever fell upon mankind. Much better and safer were it for us to separate, and prowl about like savages, nay like beasts, than to live thus, in continual trepidation, in conti∣nual fear for our throats.</P>
<P>There is something so exceedingly cow∣ardly and ridiculous in this justification, that even the French revolutionists are ashamed of it. They have recourse to another still more dishonourable, it is true, but less cowardly. They tell us, that all the assassins in France have been in the pay of Great Britain; or, to make use of their own ex∣pression, have been excited to action by the <HI>"gold of Pitt."</HI></P>
<P>As I wish to advance nothing without the best possible authority, I shall here insert a passage on this subject, taken from a Gazet∣te published at Philadelphia by one <HI>Gatreau,</HI> and at the press of <HI>Moreau de St. Mery,</HI> who was a member of the constituent assembly of France.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="030205_0148_0FE513886D261718"/>The intention of the piece evidently is to justify the French character, or rather the character of the French revolutionists, by attributing the horrid deeds these latter have committed, to some cause other than their own dispositions and anarchical principles. To avoid all cavil with respect to the authenticity of the extract, and the correctness of the translation, I will first give it in French, and then in English, ob∣serving, for the further satisfaction of the reader, that he may find the piece entire in the Gazette above mentioned, of the fourth of February 1796.</P>

<P><Q>What man, enlightened by experience, will now deny, that, from the head of Pitt have come all the crimes which have rendered the Revolution detestable in the eyes of even those who adored its princi∣ples; that, it was English jealousy and hatred that lighted the flames, and shar∣pened the poignards, which have re∣duced the finest possessions in the world to a heap of ashes and blood?—What evil genius created the impious, sangui∣nary and ambitious factions, that were to annihilate France; or, at least, bend it again beneath the vol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> Providence had not disconcerted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of iniqui∣quity? —The infe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Eng∣lish minister. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with the gold, drawn from his victims in India, that he paid for the French blood, which has flowed in rivers at Paris, in the depart∣ments, on the frontiers, and in the co∣lonies.</Q></P>
<P>This is an <HI>important,</HI> and were it not so very hackneyed and thread-bare, I would call it a <HI>"precious confession."</HI> Here we see a Frenchman, a partizan of, and perhaps an actor in, the revolution, endeavouring
<PB N="150" REF="030205_0150_0FE5138E5DE3A450"/>
to wipe away the stain on its principles, by ascribing all the horrors those principles have produced, to the gold distributed among the revolutionists by the English mi∣nister. The cruelties that have been com∣mitted, were not, then, necessary to the esta∣blishment of a free government; they were not the effect of irritation, of anarchical con∣fusion, of vindictive retaliation; they were not the natural consequence of a long-op∣pressed people's breaking their chains and rising on their tyrants; all these excuses (which I must allow were silly enough) are at once done away by this new justification; for, we are here told, in so many words, that the French people have shed rivers of each other's blood, in every part of their dominions, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly for the love—not of <HI>li∣berty,</HI> but of the <HI>gold of Pitt.</HI></P>
<P>There is su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tural connection be∣tween the measures of the several National Assemblies and the massacres that were the immediate consequence of them, that it is im∣possible to effect a separation without the utmost violence to all manner of reasoning and truth. If it was the gold of Pitt that paid for all the French blood that has been spilled, it must have been that gold that paid for the inhuman murder of Messrs. Launy and Flessel, and it must have been that gold which induced the constituent as∣sembly
<PB N="151" REF="030205_0151_0FE513EF004B8FC0"/>
to sanction the murder, by giving the assassins of these gentlemen the title of <HI>heroes</HI> and <HI>conquerors,</HI> and by instituting a national festival in their honour.</P>
<P>The Revolution was begun, and has hi∣therto been maintained by the shedding of innocent blood; therefore, if it was the gold of Pitt that paid for that blood, it is to the gold of Pitt that the revolution is to be as∣cribed, and not to that patriotic spirit and love of liberty, with which we have been so long amused. In the fifth chapter of this work, it is incontestibly proved, that the several National Assemblies authorised, or approved of all the massacres which have dis∣graced their country; if, then, these mas∣sacres were paid for by Mr. Pitt, must we not inevitably conclude that the National Assemblies were in the same pay? If Mr. Pitt paid for the blood of the family of Bourbon, for that of the king's guards, of the nobility, the clergy, the bankers, the merchants, in short, of all the rich or aristo∣crats, as they are called, it was Mr. Pitt who destroyed the monarchy: it was he who caused France to be called a Republic, and who gave rise to the doctrine of <HI>equali∣ty.</HI> Those, therefore, who talk of the gold of Pitt, must cease all their fulsome eu∣logiums on these gallant republicans; for,
<PB N="152" REF="030205_0152_0FE5138FE64F1930"/>
if they are to have a republic, it will, ac∣cording to their own confessions, be the work of the English minister.</P>
<P>This vindication, throwing the blame on the gold of Pitt, amply participates in the misfortune of all the vindications that have lately appeared amongst us; that is, it takes up a bad cause, and makes it worse. The reader will certainly feel, with me, an in∣expressible indignation at a people, who, because an hostile army was on their fron∣tiers, could be prevailed on to butcher thousands upon thousands of their innocent countrymen; who could cut the throats of their fathers and mothers, rip up the bowels of women with child, and carry about the trophies of their base and savage triumph on the points of their pikes and bayonets; but, what will be his feelings, what will contain his swelling heart, when he is told, that all this was undertaken and perpetrated for fo∣reign gold? The revolutionists, by accusing Mr. Pitt of being at the bottom of their massacres, do not perceive, without doubt, that they are heaping ten times ten-fold in∣famy on themselves and their nation.</P>
<P>By alledging this influence of British gold, the writer I have above quoted re∣duces himself and the partizans of the re∣volution to a most distressing dilemma. He owns that rivers of French blood have flow∣ed
<PB N="153" REF="030205_0153_0FE513F0858E60E8"/>
at Paris, in the departments, on the frontiers, and in the colonies; and he tells us, that this blood was paid for with the gold of Pitt. Now, admitting this to be true, this blood has been shed, and this gold received, by <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> To what, then, will our author ascribe this sangui∣nary avarice? He must either ascribe it to the <HI>natural disposition</HI> of his countrymen; or, <HI>a change</HI> in that natural disposition, <HI>produced by the revolution.</HI> It is uncertain which of these he may choose, but it is very certain, choose which he will, that he has held up the cha∣racter of his nation, or the principles of the revolution to detestation, and abhorrence. This is the way he has justified the French in the eyes of the people of this country. Infinitely better were it for such justifiers to suffer the press to rest in eternal inaction. All that a good Frenchman can do, is, to weep over the disgrace of his country; for, so long as murder, horrid, barbarous, sa∣vage murder, shall admit of no excuse, so long shall the actions of the French revo∣lutionists remain unjustifiable.</P>
<P>It is more than probable, that a writer of this stamp might be willing to allow, that his countrymen were always naturally fero∣cious and bloody-minded, rather than con∣fess that this disposition has been produced by the principles of the revolution: for,
<PB N="154" REF="030205_0154_0FE513916EED0408"/>
patriots of this kind are ever ready to sacri∣fice the honour of their country to the sup∣port of their systems. But justice demands from us to reject with disdain every such conclusion. We have seen the French peo∣ple sprightly, beneficent, humane and hap∣py; let us, now, follow them step-by-step into the awful opposite, and see for our∣selves, by what diabolical means the change has been effected.</P>
<P>The first National Assembly had hardly assumed that title, when they discovered an intention of overturning the government, which they had been called together, and which their constituents had enjoined them, to support, and of levelling all ranks and distinctions among the different orders in the community. To this they were not led, as it has been so falsely pretended, by their love of liberty and desire of seeing their country happy; but by envy, cursed envy, that will never let the fiery demagogue sleep in peace, while he sees a greater or richer than himself. It has been objected to this, that there were among the revolutionists men who already enjoyed distinguished ho∣nours; but it is forgotten at the same time, that ambition will be at the top, or no where; that it will destroy itself with the envied object, rather than act a subaltern part. The motto of a demagogue is that
<PB N="155" REF="030205_0155_0FE513FB5432DA48"/>
of Milton's Satan: "rather reign in hell than serve in heaven."</P>
<P>This task of destruction was, however, an arduous one. To tear the complicated work of fourteen centuries to pieces at once, to render honours dishonourable, and turn reverential awe into contempt and mockery, was not to be accomplished but by extraor∣dinary means. It was evident that proper∣ty must change hands, that the best blood of the nation must flow in torrents, or the project must fail. The Assembly, to arm the multitude on their side, broached the popular doctrine of <HI>equality.</HI> It was a ne∣cessary part of the plan of these reformers to seduce the people to their support; and such was the credulity of the unfortunate French, that they soon began to look on them as the oracles of virtue and wisdom, and believed themselves raised, by one short sentence issued by these ambitious impostors, from the state of <HI>subjects</HI> to that of <HI>sove∣reigns.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I punished (says Solon, the Athenian law-giver) I punished with death, all those aspiring disturbers of the common∣wealth, who, in order to domineer them∣selves, and lead the vulgar in their train, pretended that all men were equal, and sought to confound the different ranks in society, by preaching up a chimerical
<PB N="156" REF="030205_0156_0FE513976419A748"/>
equality, that never did or can exist.</Q> How happy would it have been for France, had there been some Solon, endued with wisdom and power enough to punish the political mountebanks of the Constituent Assembly! What dreadful carnage, what indelible disgrace, the nation would have escaped! Hardly had the word <HI>equality</HI> been pronounced, when the whole kingdom became a scene of anarchy and confusion. The name of liberty (I say the <HI>name,</HI> for the regenerated French have known nothing of it but the name) The name of liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had already half turned the heads of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people, and that of equality finished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> work. From the moment it sounded in their ears, all that had formerly inspired r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦spect, all that they had reverenced and ado∣red even, began to excite contempt and fu∣ry. Birth, beauty, old age, all became the victims of a destructive equality, erected in∣to a law by an Assembly of ambitious ty∣rants, who were ready to destroy every thing that crossed their way to absolute do∣mination.</P>
<P>One of the immediate effects of the pro∣mulgation of this doctrine was the murder of Monsieur Foulon and his son-in-law Ber∣thier, who, without so much as being char∣ged with any crime, were taken by the people, conducted to Paris and cruelly
<PB N="157" REF="030205_0157_0FE513FD3B3D15B8"/>
massacreed. I will say nothing (says <HI>Du Gour</HI> in his eloquent <HI>Memoire</HI> page 35) I will say nothing of the savage cruelties committed on Foulon and Berthier; I will not represent the bloody head of the father-in-law, offer∣ed to the son to kiss, pressed against his lips, and afterwards put under his feet; I will not represent the inhuman assassins rushing on Berthier, tearing out his heart, and placing it, quivering and still palpita∣ting, on the table of the town-hall, <HI>before the magistrates</HI> of the commune.—After this their heads were stuck on pikes, and the heart of Berthier on the point of a sword. In this manner they were carried through the streets, followed by the exulting popu∣lace (see <HI>Rabaut's</HI> Hist. Of the French Revolution, page 117.) Nor let it be pretended that the Assembly could not pre∣vent this shameful, this bloody deed. They had the absolute command of Paris at the time, and had two hundred thousand armed men ready to obey their nod. But the As∣sembly never opposed the murder of those whom they looked upon as their enemies; nay, Rabaut, their partial historian (who was one of their body) even justifies the murder.</P>
<P>When the word <HI>equality</HI> found its way to the colonies it was only a signal for assassina∣tion. At Port-au-Prince the Chevalier de
<PB N="158" REF="030205_0158_0FE5139E0377D140"/>
Mauduit, a brave and generous officer, who rendered essential services to this country during the last war, was murdered by his own soldiers. The villains had the insolence to order him to kneel down before them: "No," said he, like a soldier as he was, <Q>it shall never be said, that Thomas Mau∣duit bent his knee before a set of scoun∣drels,</Q> —His head was cut off; he was torn limb from limb; his bowels were trail∣ed along the street, as butchers do those of beasts in a slaughter house. The next mor∣ning the different members of his body, and morsels of his flesh, were seen strewed about opposite his house, and his bloody and ghastly head placed on the step of the door way.— We know, we have before our eyes the proofs of what havock, distress and destruc∣tion, this detestable word has since produced in the unfortunate island of St. Domingo.</P>
<P>It was now that the sovereign people, enter∣ing on their reign, first took the famous plundering motto: <HI>"La guerre aux cha∣teaux et la paix aux chaumiéres";</HI> that is, <HI>War to the gentlemen's houses and peace to the cottage;</HI> or, in other words, <HI>war to all those who have any thing to lose.</HI> This motto is extremely comprehensive; it includes the whole doctrine of equality. It was not a vain declaration in France; but was put in practice with that patriotic zeal which
<PB N="159" REF="030205_0159_0FE513FEEFA44DE8"/>
has marked the whole course of the revo∣lution. To be rich or of a good family became a crime, which was often expiated by the loss of life. Men took as much pains to be thought obscure vagabonds, as they had formerly done to be thought wealthy and of honest descent; and, what distinguishes the French revolution from all others in the world, to have a ragged pair of breeches, or to be totally in want of that so necessary article of dress, was es∣teemed the surest mark of pure patriotism, and was the greatest recommendation to public favour.</P>
<P>But the National Assembly, though hear∣tily seconded by myriads of ragged popu∣lace, knew, however, that they could not long depend upon such a promiscuous support. The citizens were, therefore, to be soldiers at the same time, and placed under the command of the creatures of the Assembly. To this end the territory of the nation un∣derwent a new division, on the levelling plan. The provinces of France were melt∣ed down into a rude undigested mass of de∣partments, districts, and municipalities. All the old magistrates were replaced by the vilest wretches that could be found. There were forty four thousand municipalities, each of these had several municipal officers,
<PB N="160" REF="030205_0160_0FE5139F8D1FF470"/>
and each of these latter his troop of revolu∣tionary myrmidons. There could not be less than <HI>three millions</HI> of men in arms, rea∣dy to burn, cut and slay at a moment's warning. Nothing was to be seen or heard but the patrolling of these sons of equality. The Assembly pretended to hold out the olive branch, while they were forming the nation into a camp. The peaceable man trembled for his life. One must have been an eye witness of the change produced by these measures, to have the least idea of it. All was suspicion and dread. The bell that had never rung but to call the peaceful vil∣lagers to the altar, was converted into a signal of approaching danger, and the tree, beneath which they formerly danced, be∣came an alarm post. The ragged greasy magistrates, with their municipal troops at their heels, were for ever prowling about for their prey, the property of others. These little platoons of cut-throats ranged the country round, crying havock burning and laying waste where ever they came. They had not yet begun to murder frequently, but it was little consequence to a man whe∣ther his brains were blowed out or not, af∣ter having seen himself and family reduced, in the space of a few hours, from affluence to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggary.

house of a gentleman in Provence, and de∣manded that his person should be delivered into their hands. The servants defended the house for some time, but in vain; they advanced to the front door, when the lady of the house appeared with a child in her arms, and endeavoured to pacify them, say∣ing that her husband was gone out at the back door. The ruffians instantly set fire to the house. When the lady perceived this, she confessed that her husband was hid∣den in one of the garrets. The house was now on fire; she left her child and rushed through the flames to call her husband from his retreat, but she was stifled in the passage, and burnt to death, and her husband shared in her fate, leaving a helpless infant to the mercy of the murderers of its father and mo∣ther.—A hundred volumes like this could not contain the horrors that these revolu∣tionary robbers committed in the name of <HI>liberty and equality.</HI></P>
<P>Let this, Americans, be a lesson to you, throw from you the doctrine of <HI>equality,</HI> as you would the poisoned chalice. Where∣ever this detestable principle gains ground to any extent, ruin must inevitably ensue. Would you stifle the noble flame of emula∣tion, and encourage ignorance and idleness? Would you inculcate defiance of the laws? Would you teach servants to be disobedient
<PB N="162" REF="030205_0162_0FE513A113862370"/>
to their masters, and children to their pa∣rents? Would you sow the seeds of envy, hatred, robbery, and murder? Would you break all the bands of society asunder, and turn a civilized people into a horde of sava∣ges? This is all done by the comprehensive word equality.—But they tell us, we are not to take it in the unqualified sense. In what sense are we to take it then? Either it means something more than liberty, or it means nothing at all. The misconstruction of the word liberty has done mischief enough in the world; to add to it a word of a still more dangerous extent, was to kindle a flame that never can be extinguish∣ed but by the total debasement, if not de∣struction, of the society, who are silly or wicked enough to adopt its use. We are told, that every government receives with its existence the latent disease that is one day to accomplish its death; but the government that is attacked with this political apoplexy is annihilated in the twinkling of an eye.</P>
<P>The civil disorganization of the state was but the forerunner of those curses which the Assembly had in store for their devoted country. They plainly perceived, that they never should be able to brutify the people to their wishes, without removing the for∣midable barriers of religion and morality.
<PB N="163" REF="030205_0163_0FE5140CF1F52F40"/>
Their heads were turned, but it was neces∣sary to corrupt their hearts.</P>
<P>Besides this, the leaders in the Assembly were professed <HI>modern philosophers;</HI> that is to say, atheists or deists. Camus and Con∣dorcet openly taught atheism, and Ceruti said with his last breath, <Q>the only regret I have in quitting the world, is, that I leave a religion on earth.</Q> These words, the blas∣phemy of an expiring demon, were applaud∣ed by the assembled legislators. It was not to be wondered at, that the vanity of such men should be flattered in the hope of chang∣ing the <HI>most christian</HI> country into the <HI>most infidel</HI> upon the face of the earth; for, there is a sort of fanaticism in irreligion, that leads the profligate atheist to seek for proselytes with a zeal that would do honour to a good cause, but which employed in a bad one be∣comes the scourge of society.</P>
<P>The zeal of these philosophers for extirpa∣ting the truth, was as great at least, as that shown by the primitive christians for its pro∣pagation. But they proceeded in a very differ∣ent manner. At first some circumspection was necessary. The more effectually to destroy the christian religion altogether, they began by sapping the foundations of the catholic faith, the only one that the people had been taught to revere. They formed a schism with the
<PB N="164" REF="030205_0164_0FE513AB6663BA70"/>
church of Rome, well knowing that the opinions of the vulgar, once set afloat, were as likely to fix on atheism as on any other system; and more so, as being less opposed to their levelling principles than the rigid though simple morality of the gospel. A religion that teaches obedience to the higher powers, inculcates humility and peace, strictly forbids robbery and murder, and, in short, enjoins on men to do as they would be done unto, could by no means suit the armed russians, who were to accomplish the views of the French Assembly.</P>
<P>The press, which was made free for the worst of purposes, lent most powerful aid to these destructive reformers. While the ca∣tholic religion was ridiculed and abused, no other christian system was proposed in its stead; on the contrary, the profligate wret∣ches who conducted the public prints, among whom were Mirabeau, Marat, Con∣dorcet and Hebert, filled one half of their impious sheets with whatever could be thought of to degrade all religion in gene∣ral. The ministers of divine worship, of every sect and denomination, were repre∣sented as cheats, and as the avowed enemies of the sublime and sentimental something, which the Assembly had in store for the re∣generation of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="030205_0165_0FE5140ED021AB50"/>Most of my readers must have heard of the magnificent church of St. Genviève, at Paris.

<P>To this <HI>Pantheon</HI> the ashes of Voltaire were first transported, and the Assembly spent no less than three days in determining whether those of <HI>Rousseau</HI> should not accom∣pany them. This distinction, paid to two of the most celebrated deists of the age, was a full declaration of the principles as well as the intentions of the majority of the Assem∣bly.</P>
<P>Those who have not had the patience to wade through the lies and blasphemies of Voltaire, know his principles from report. <HI>Rousseau</HI> is not so well known; and, as he was, and still continues to be, the great oracle of the revolutionists, I am persuaded a page or two on his character, and that of his works, will not be lost here; particular∣ly

as I have heard both mentioned with ap∣plause in this country, by persons apparent∣ly of the best intentions.</P>
<P>The philosopher Rousseau, the pagod of the regenerated French, was born at Gene∣va; and, at a proper age, bound an ap∣prentice to an artist. During his apprentice∣ship he frequently robbed his master as well as other persons. Before his time was ex∣pired he decamped, fled into the dominions of the king of Sardinia, where he changed the presbyterian for the catholic religion. This beginning seemed to promise fair for what followed. By an unexpected turn of fortune he became a footman, in which ca∣pacity he did not forget his old habit of stealing. He is detected with the stolen goods; swears they were given him by a maid servant of the house; the girl is con∣fronted with him, she denies the fact, and weeping presses him to confess the truth; but the young philosopher still persists in the lie, and the poor girl is driven from her place in disgrace.—Tired of being a serving-man, he went to throw himself on the pro∣tection of a lady, whom he had seen once before, and who he protests was the most <HI>virtuous</HI> creature of her sex. This lady had so great a regard for him, that she called him her <HI>little darling,</HI> and he called her <HI>mama. Mama</HI> had a footman, who served her be∣sides,
<PB N="167" REF="030205_0167_0FE514105AA37928"/>
in another capacity very much re∣sembling that of a husband; but she had a most tender affection for her adopted son <HI>Rousseau,</HI> and, as she feared he was forming connections with a certain lady that might spoil his morals, she herself, out of pure vir∣tue, took him—to bed with her!—This vir∣tuous effort to preserve the purity of Rous∣seau's heart, had a dreadful effect on the head of the poor footman, and so he poison∣ed himself—Rosseau fell sick, and <HI>mama</HI> was obliged to part with <HI>little darling,</HI> while he performed a journey to the south of France, for the recovery of his health. On the road he dines with a gentleman, and lies with his wife. As he was returning back, he debat∣ed with himself whether he should pay this lady a second visit or not; but, fearing he might be tempted to seduce her daughter also, <HI>virtue</HI> got the better, and determined the <HI>little darling</HI> to fly home into the arms of his <HI>mama;</HI> but, alas! those arms were fil∣led with another. <HI>Mama's</HI> virtue had prompted her to take a substitute, whom she liked too well to part with, and our philo∣sopher was obliged to shift for himself. I should have told the reader, that the <HI>little darling,</HI> while he resided with his <HI>mama,</HI> went to make a tour with a young musician. Their friendship was warm, like that of most young men, and they were, besides, enjoin∣ed
<PB N="168" REF="030205_0168_0FE513AEBAF52F78"/>
to take particular care of each other du∣ring their travels. They travelled on for some time, agreed perfectly well, and vow∣ed an everlasting friendship for each other. But, the musician, being one day taken in a fit, fell down in the street, which furnished the faithful Rousseau with an opportunity of slipping off with some of his things, and leaving him to the mercy of the people, in a town where he was a total stranger.</P>
<P>We seldom meet with so much villainy in a youth. His manhood was worthy of it. He turned apostate a second time, was dri∣ven from within the walls of his native city of Geneva, as an incendiary, and an apos∣tle of anarchy and infidelity; nor did he forget how to thieve.—At last the philoso∣pher marries; but like a philosopher; that is, without going to church. He has a fa∣mily of children, and, like a kind philosophi∣cal father, for fear they should want after his death, he sends them to the <HI>poor-house</HI> during his lifetime!—To conclude, the phi∣losopher dies, and leaves the philosopheress; his wife, to the protection of a friend; she marries a footman, and gets turned out into the street.</P>
<P>This is a brief sketch of the life of Jean Jacques Rousseau, the oracle of the regene∣rated French, a thief, a whoremaster, an adulterer, a treacherous friend, an unnatu∣ral

father, and twice an apostate.—There wants only about a hundred murders to make him equal to the immortal Marat, whom we have seen compared to Jesus Christ. This vile wretch has the impu∣dence to say, in the work that contains a confession of these his crimes, that no man can come to the throne of God, and say, <HI>I am a better man than Rousseau.</HI></P>
<P>His writings, though they have very great literary merit, contain such principles as might be expected from such a man. He has exhausted all the powers of reasoning and all the charms of eloquence in the cause of anarchy and irreligion. And his writ∣ings are so much the more dangerous, as he winds himself into favour with the unwary, by an eternal cant about <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>liberty.</HI> He seems to have assumed the mask of virtue for no other purpose than that of propagat∣ing with more certain success the blackest and most incorrigible vice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Two philosophers can seldom agree more than two persons of any other profession; so it happened with <HI>Voltaire</HI> and <HI>Rousseau.</HI> The humurous prophetic satire of the former, occasioned by the publication of <HI>Rous∣seau's</HI> romance, the <HI>New Eloisa,</HI> is so well worthy of a place here, that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of translating an extract or two from it.</P>
<P>"In those days there will appear in France a won∣derful man. He will say unto the people, behold! I am possessed by the demon of enthusiasm; I have re∣ceived from heaven the gift of paradoxical inconsistency; and the light-heeled multitude will dance after him and many will adore him. And he will say, you are all rasc∣als and prostitutes, and I detest rascals and prostitutes, and I come to live amongst you. And he will add, the men and women are all virtuous in the republic of Geneva, where I was born, and I love virtuous men and women, and I will not live in the country where I was born.—He will protest that the play-house is a school of prostitution and corruption, and he will write operas and plays.—He will advise mankind to go stark naked, and he will wear laced cloth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when given unto him.—He will swear that romances corrupt the morals of all who read them, and he will compose a ro∣mance; and in this romance will be seen vice in deeds and virtue in words, and the lovers will be mad with love and with philosophy; and this romance will teach how to seduce a young girl philosophically; and the disciple will lose all shame and modesty: and she will practise foolishness and raise maxims and paradoxes with her master; and she will kiss first, and ask him to lie with her, and he will actually lie with her, and she will become round and pregnant with metaphysics. And this they will call philosophy and virtue, and they will talk about philosophy and virtue, till no soul on earth will know what philosophy and virtue is."</P></NOTE>.</P>

vogue, may guess at the effect that this phi∣losophical canonization of Rousseau produ∣ced. Every thing was <HI>a la Rousseau;</HI> his works were hawked about, mouthed in the National Assembly (often by those who un∣derstood them not) recommended in all the prints, and spouted at the sans-culotte clubs. His old boorish sayings became the liveliest traits of wit, all his manners were imitat∣ed, to be crusty and ill-bred was like Jean Jacques, and, what was particularly offen∣sive to every just mind, his loathsome down-looking portrait, that portrait which seems to be the chosen seat of guilt, was seen at every corner, and in every hand.</P>
<P>Having thus prepared the public mind, the Assembly made a bold attack on the church. They discovered, by the light of philosophy, that France contained too ma∣ny churches, and, of course, too many pa∣stors. Great part of them were therefore to be suppressed, and to make the innovati∣on go down with the people, all tithes were to be abollished. The measure succeeded; but what did the people gain by the aboli∣tion of the tithes? not a farthing; for, a tax of twenty <HI>per cent</HI> was immediately laid on the lands in consequence of it. The cheat was not perceived till it was too late.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="030205_0172_0FE513BB7811ED78"/>But, the abolition of the tithes, the on∣ly motive of which was to debase the clergy in the opinions of the people, was but a tri∣fle to what was to follow. The religious orders, that is to say, the communities of monks and nuns, possessed immense landed estates, and these the honest Assembly had marked for their own. As a pretext for the seizure they first decreed, that the wealth of the religious orders <HI>belonged to the nation,</HI> to that indefinite being, that exists every where and no where, and that has devoured all, without receiving any thing.</P>
<P>As this act of seizing the estates of the regular clergy, was one of those that gave a decisive blow to property as well as religi∣on in France, and one that has received the greatest applauses in this country, I shall enter a little at length into the flagrant inju∣stice of it. Nor is the subject inapplicable to ourselves; for, though there are no reli∣gious orders in America, there are many people of property, and it is of a violation of property that I here charge the As∣sembly.</P>
<P>How the estates of the religious orders became the property of a certain somebody called the nation, in 1791, is to me wholly inconceiveable; seeing that there never was a time, when they belonged to that society of men, now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alled the French.

part of the monasteries had been founded five, six, seven hundred years, and some above a thousand years before the most worthless of the French took it into their heads to be so many sovereigns. The founders were men of pious and austere lives, who, wishing to retire from the world, obtained grants of uncultivated land, generally in some barren and solitary spot. There they formed little miserable settle∣ments, which, by their frugality and la∣bour, in time became rich meadows, farms and vineyards. A French historian, speak∣ing of St. Etienne, says: <Q>In 1058, he retired to Citeaux, then a vast forest, in∣habited only by wild beasts. Here, with the help of his followers, he built a mo∣nastery of the wood of the forest; but, at first, it was no more than a group of shabby huts. Every thing bore the marks of extreme poverty: the cross was of wood, the censers of copper, and the candle-sticks of iron. All the ornaments were of coarse woolen or linnen. La∣bour was the only means of subsistence with the monks of Citeaux. For many years bread was their only food, and they were often reduced to a scarcity of even that.</Q></P>
<P>In time this forest became a cultivated and flourishing estate, and the successors of
<PB N="174" REF="030205_0174_0FE513BD76EA0B60"/>
the first proprietors were not only at their ease, but even rich. The monastery, which was at first but a clump of ill-shaped huts, built with the limbs of trees, bark and turf, was become a magnificent pile. The church was beautiful beyond description. Instead of wood and copper and iron, the symbols of religion and the sacred vases were now of gold, silver and precious stones. This abbey, at the time of the seizure by the Constituent Assembly, had an annual reve∣nue of 120,000 French livres, or, about 6,000 pounds sterling.</P>
<P>Now, I ask any honest man; was this the property of the French nation, or not? By what rule of right, by what principle of law or justice, could this estate belong to any other than the <HI>lawful</HI> successors of the first proprietors; that is to say, the posses∣sors at the epoch of the seizure? No title ever framed by man could be so good as theirs. The community at Citeaux had ne∣ver ceased to exist, nor for a single moment ceased to keep possession of their Abbey and and its dependencies. They had first ob∣tained a lawful grant of the land, had clear∣ed, cultivated, and enriched it; and had en∣joyed an uninter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pted possession during the space of seven hundred and thirty two years? but, at the end of the <HI>enlightened</HI> eighteenth century, the <HI>Age of Reason,</HI> up starts a horde

of lazy worthless ruffians, calling them∣selves the nation, and lay claim to their estates!</P>
<P><HI>Bulteau,</HI> in speaking of St. Benedict, says: <Q>The bodily labour ordered by this wise founder, was a source of peace and tranquility to the first monks, and of opulence to their successors. The mo∣nasteries were long an assylum to those christians, who fled from the oppressions of the Goths and Vandals. The little learning that remained in the barbarous and dark ages, was preserved in the cloisters. It is to them we owe all the most precious remains of antiquity, as well as many modern inventions.</Q>—In∣deed, under the great disposer of all events, it is to them we owe that we are christians; that we possess the word of God, our guide to eternal life. They not only preserved this inestimable volume, but spread it in every country in the world.

Some of the writings that do the greatest honour to

the French nation, and to the human mind, have issued from the cloister. And yet, we have seen these men robbed of their estates, stripped of even their furniture and their vestments, driven from beneath their roofs, hunted like wild beasts, and, what I am ashamed to say, many of us have had the folly, or rather baseness, to applaud their unprincipled and blood-thirsty pursuers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot help observing here, that these unjust and inhuman applauders have not always been con∣fined to the mob. An <Q>Oration <HI>on the</HI> Progress of Reason.</Q> delivered at a Public Commencement in the University of Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the 18th of July, 1792, contains a phillipic against the injured French monarch and Clergy, the most illiberal that ever disgraced the lips of a petulant self-sufficient pedant. The <HI>Orator</HI> discovers but little knowledge of any branch of his subject, and more particularly of the character of Louis XVI. of that of the French Cler∣gy, and of the nature of the old government; against all which he runs on in a strain of invective, more re∣sembling the brutal abusiveness of Calvin, than any thing we ought to expect to hear from the chair of a seminary, at the close of the "<HI>enlightened</HI> eighteenth century".—Like many others, this <HI>Orator</HI> looked upon the French Revolution as happily terminated; as the dawn of universal peace, liberty, and virtue: he has since had time to see his error, to see the effects of his "Progress of Reason," some of which I have related in the former part of this volume; If he be candid, therefore, he will publicly retract this error. If he should not do this, I shall take the liberty, one of these days, of convincing him that he has erred.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="030205_0177_0FE51422B3FB6B38"/>We are told that the monks were become too rich. Indeed this was their great of∣fence in the eyes of an Assembly, whose motto was: <Q>War to the rich and peace to the cottager.</Q> But we have seen that the foundation of these riches was laid by the labour of their predecessors, and we may observe that they were augmented, not by oppression, as has been falsly asserted, but by a prudent management of their estates. Those communities that cultivated their own lands, were noted for the excel∣lent manner of their cultivation, and for the superior quality of their produce; and those that rented out their farms, let them at a low rate, so as to enable the farmer to enrich the land at the same time that he en∣riched himself. It was by such means that their estates became the most valuable in the country, a circumstance that poor shal∣low-headed Paine has brought against them as a heinous offence. They were gentle humane masters and landlords: a man look∣ed upon his fortune as made, when he be∣came the tenant of a religious order.</P>
<P>And, how were these riches spent? Not in horses and coaches; people shut up in a cloister had no use for these. Not in balls and plays: for there they could never ap∣pear. Not in rich attire and costly repasts; for the greatest part of them were clothed
<PB N="178" REF="030205_0178_0FE513C08B7DAE50"/>
worse than common beggars, and were for∣bidden the use of meat, and even of wine, the common drink of their country. Their riches did not go to agrandize their fami∣lies; because, as no individual could pos∣sess any thing, so he could bequeath or dis∣pose of nothing. Who, then, profited from these riches?—Go ask the poor, who were happy in the neighbourhood of their convents. Go ask the aged, the infirm, the widow and the orphan. And, ask them, too, what aid and consolation they have received from the thieving philosophers of the Revo∣lution.</P>
<P>This charge of being <HI>too rich,</HI> is the most absurd as well as the most vile that could possibly be invented. Do we say to a man, who has acquired an immense fortune by the labour of his father, or by any other means; you are <HI>too rich,</HI> and therefore your proper∣ty belongs to the nation?—There is a com∣munity at Bethlehem, very much resembling those we have here been speaking of. What should we think of a scoundrel legislator, who should propose to strip these people of their property, and turn them out to beg their bread, merely because the value of their lands is increased? Such was he who first proposed the seizure of the church lands in France.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="030205_0179_0FE5142C20305B40"/>Some of the convents in France had been founded by lay persons, upon such and such conditions; and, in case of failure on the part of the community, the property was to revert to the heirs of the donor. Foundations of this kind were exactly re∣sembling those we frequently see among us, of hospitals, seminaries, &amp;c. and the deeds were still in existence at the time of the seizure; but an Assembly that paid no re∣spect to a right of prescription, founded on a thousand years of uninterrupted possession, could not be expected to pay attention to the contents of a bit of old parchment.</P>
<P>We ought not to be astonished at hear∣ing the author of <HI>The Age of Reason</HI> attempt to justify this act of impudent fraud; but let us see how his doctrine would suit, if applied to oursleves: for this is the only way to determine on its merits.

drive the congregation from the altar, strip the minister of his cassock, seize on the sa∣cramental cup, and turn the Church into a stable; I ask how should we like this?— But, we are told, there is a vast difference; that the monks were superstitious drones, useless to society.—Ah! let us beware. Let us take care not to condemn, because we are protestants, a religion that differs from our own in form only; a religion that has yet more votaries than any other christian profession can boast of. And, as to the re∣ligious orders being useless to society, we have no proofs of this, but strong presump∣tive ones of the contrary; for, we know, that France was great and happy, that it had been increasing in extent, wealth and popu∣lation, since the existence of these commu∣nities, However, I can by no means take upon me to prove the public utility of the monastick life; nor is it necessary; for, if no man is to possess property, unless he can prove his utility to society, I am afraid that few of us would be secure. How many hundreds of proprietors do we see, who are much <HI>worse</HI> than useless to society! Surely the public is as much benefited by a man who spends his life in a convent, as by one who spends it in a tavern, at a billiard-table, or in a play-house. Thousands and thou∣sands there are who never worked a stroke,

nor studied a single hour; vegetating mor∣tals, who seem to live only to eat and drink and be carried about. Yet we have never thought of seizing their estates. No; utili∣ty or inutility has nothing to do with the matter; the question before us is a simple question of right. Whether monks were necessary or useful in France, or not, we know there were such people, and that they possessed property legally acquired; and, every honest man, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, will hold in ab∣horrence the Assembly that dared to rob them of it.</P>
<P>When we hear of such crying acts of in∣justice as this, we are naturally led to en∣quire who were the first promoters of them. The reader will be astonished to hear, that the decree for this national robbery was first proposed by a bishop. Of a hundred and thirty eight French bishops, there were only <HI>four</HI> to be found, who would give their ap∣probation to this deed, and one of these four was he who proposed the decree. The Abbé Barruel speaks of him in the following terms: <Q>The Assembly thought it high time to consumate their designs upon the church, by seizing what still remained of its possessions, This measure was so evi∣dently contrary to every principle of jus∣tice and common honesty, that it was not

<P>To obtain the sanction of the people to this act, they were told, that the wealth of the church would not only pay off the na∣tional debt, but render taxes in future un∣necessary. No deception was ever so bare faced as this; but even this was not want∣ed; for the people themselves had already begun to taste the sweets of plunder. Ava∣rice tempted the trading part of the nation to approve of the measure. At the time of passing the decree they were seen among the first to applaud it. They saw an easy means of obtaining those fine rich estates the possession of which they had, perhaps long coveted. In vain were they told, that the purchaser would partake in the infamy of the robbery; that, if the title of the communities could not render property secure, that same property could never be secure under any title the plunderers could give. In vain were they told, that in sanc∣tioning the seisure of the wealth of others, they were sanctioning the seisure of their
<PB N="183" REF="030205_0183_0FE514308D0CCE18"/>
own, whenever that all-devouring monster, the sovereign people, should call on them for it. In vain were they told all this: they purchased: they saw with pleasure the plun∣dered clergy driven from their dwellings; but scarcely had they taken possession of their ill-gotten wealth, when not only that, but the remains of their other property were wrenched from them. Since that we have seen decree upon decree launched forth against the rich: their account books have been submitted to public examination; they have been obliged to give drafts for the funds they possessed even in foreign coun∣tries; all their letters have been intercepted and read. How many hundreds of them have we seen led to the scaffold, merely because they were proprietors of what their sovereign stood in need of! these were acts of unexampled tyranny; but, as they re∣spected the persons who applauded the sei∣zure of the estates of the church, they were perfectly just. Several of these avari∣cious purchasers have been murdered with∣in the walls of those buildings, whence they had assisted to drive the lawful proprietors: this was just: it was the measure they had meted to others. They shared the fate of the injured clergy, without sharing the pity which that fate excited. When dragged
<PB N="184" REF="030205_0184_0FE513CB8BD64218"/>
forth to slaughter in their turn, they were left without even the right of complaining: the last stab of the assassin was accompanied with the cutting reflection, that it was just.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this subject, as it is, perhaps, the most striking and most awful example of the consequences of a vio∣lation of property, that the world ever saw. Let it serve to warn all those who wish to raise their fortunes on the ruin of others, that, sooner or later, their own turn must come. From this act of the Constituent Assembly we may date the violation, in France, of every right that men ought to hold dear. Hence the seizure of all gold and silver as the property of the nation: hence the law preventing the son to claim the wealth of his father: hence the abomi∣nable tyranny of requisitions; and hence thousands and thousands of the murders, that have disgraced unhappy France.</P>
<P>Since the seizure of the church-estates, there has not, in fact, been any such thing as private property in France; for, though the Constituent Assembly did not pass a decree of this import, they knew perfectly well how to pass decrees and establish regu∣lations amounting to the same thing.

he had but a few hours to live. The mo∣ney and jewels, deposited at the bar of the Assembly and on the altar of the country, amounted to immense sums. These were held out as a proof of a general approbation of their measures; but had the Assembly been candid, they would have confessed, that these offerings were the pure effect of fear, of a panic that had seized all the pro∣prietors in the nation, and that each giver's hatred to their cause might be measured by the sum he deposited. It was not a grate∣ful free-will offering, but a sacrifice, that the trembling wretch came to offer at the shrine of tyranny, in order to save his house from the flames, or his own head, or that of some dear relation or parent, from the scaffold. Could a man, reduced to acts like this, be said to <HI>possess</HI> any thing?</P>
<P>The successors of the Constituent Assem∣bly laid aside the mask, as no longer neces∣sary. On the 13th of March, 1794, all the Merchants of Bourdeaux (known for one of the most infamously patriotic towns in the kingdom) were arrested in one day, and condemned, in presence of the guillo∣tine, to a fine of <HI>one hundred millions</HI> of French livres, upwards of <HI>four millions ster∣ling.</HI> On the 18th of April, the rich Bank∣er, La Bord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, after having <HI>purchased his life eight times,</HI> was guillotined, and the re∣mainder
<PB N="186" REF="030205_0186_0FE513D199283368"/>
of his riches confiscated. On the 10th of May, twenty seven rich Farm∣ers-General were executed, because they had amassed riches under the monarchy. Finally, on the 27th of June, all property, of whatever description, was decreed <HI>to be∣long to the nation,</HI> and was put in a state of requisition accordingly, as the <HI>persons</HI> of the whole of the inhabitants had been be∣fore.</P>
<P>The milk-and-water admirers of the Con∣stituent Assembly pretend to be shocked at these measures; but, what are these mea∣sures more than an improvement on those of that Assembly? The progress was not only natural, but even necessary to the sup∣port of the revolution. Had there been still church-estates to seize, und monks to murder, it is probable, that the tyrants, who have succeeded the Constituent Assem∣bly, would not have surpassed their prede∣cessors; but, that source being exhausted, they were obliged to find out others, or re∣turn to order and obedience. And, I should be glad to know, if the property of one individual, or one society, was become the property of the sovereign people by vir∣tue of a decree of one Assembly, why the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> claim should not be made to the pro∣perty of other individuals, or other societies. Nor can I believe, whatever Atheists and
<PB N="187" REF="030205_0187_0FE5144FDF04CFA8"/>
Deists may say to the contrary, that it was any more unjust to guillotine Bankers and Merchants, or even <HI>members of the Constitu∣ent Assembly,</HI> than to guillotine or massacre poor, defenceless, friendless Priests. There is such an intimate connection between the security of property, and that of the person to whom that property belongs, that one can never be said to be safe, while the other is in danger. Tyrant princes, tyrant assem∣blies, or tyrant mobs, when once they are suffered to take away with impunity the pro∣perty of the innocent man, will feel little scruple at taking away his life also. Rob∣bery and murder are the natural auxiliaries of each other, and, with a people rendered ferocious and hardened by an infidel system that removes all fear of an hereafter, they must for ever be inseparable.</P>
<P>Before the decree was passed for the as∣sumption of the estates of the regular clergy, every calumny that falshood could invent, and every vexation that Tyranny could en∣force, were employed to debase the whole body of the clergy and the religion they taught. Songs and caricatures were sung, or hawked about, by shameless strumpets in the pay of the Assembly. In these not on∣ly the clerical functions and the lives of the clergy were ridiculed, but even the life of
<PB N="188" REF="030205_0188_0FE513DA2A09FE50"/>
Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. The <HI>Incarnation</HI> of our Saviour became the sub∣ject of a <HI>farce,</HI> in the smutty language of Parisian fish-women. Who were the cha∣racters in this farce, I leave the shuddering reader to conceive.</P>
<P>A decree, in form of an <HI>invitation,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Invitations from superiors," says some one, "favour strongly of commands." This was so much the case in the present instance, that the priest who dared to disobey, was sure to expiate his disobedience with his life. The magistrates often entered the church and seized the chalices on the altar, during the celebration of the mass. Such are revolutionary <HI>invitations.</HI></NOTE> was issued, for bringing the gold and silver from the churches to the mint. It was well known, that there were none of these me∣tals in the churches, except the vases, the crucifixes, and other symbols, hitherto held sacred. What an effect the coining up of these must have on the minds of the giddy multitude, is not difficult to imagine. Ma∣ny, however, even of the most depraved, felt a momentary horror; but this horror the Assembly knew how to do away. Hun∣dreds, I might say thousands, of abandoned scriblers were employed to propagate the new principles. Their little filthy ditties were spread through all the departments, <HI>at the expence of the nation.</HI> Some of these
<PB N="189" REF="030205_0189_0FE5143C726605F8"/>
were catechisms in rhyme, in which the Constitution was substituted for God, the Assembly for the saints, and both recom∣mended to the adoration of the French pa∣triots. The journal, or Letter, as it was called, of <HI>Pere du Chêne,</HI> written by one Hebert, and of which it is said fifty thou∣sand copies were struck off daily, was sent into the towns and villages by the carriers of the decrees of the Assembly. This He∣bert, whose Strumpet has since been ador∣ed at Paris, as the Goddess of <HI>Reason,</HI> was a professed atheist. His journal contained the most outrageous abuse of all that was respectable and sacred, interlarded with oaths and execrations without number. I have one now before me, which has for ti∣tle: <Q>Lettre du veritable Pere du Chêne, bougrement patriotic.</Q> in English: <Q>Letter of the true Father du Chêne b—gerly patriotic;</Q> I would here insert an extract from this letter; but, I trust I shall be be∣lieved, when I say, the contents are fully answerable to the title. Such were the agents of Condorcet and his colleagues: thus did they corrupt the morals of the peo∣ple; thus did they lead them from one de∣gree of vice to another; thus were they hard∣ened up to rob and to murder; and thus
<PB N="190" REF="030205_0190_0FE513DBB3006198"/>
did the boasted Constituent Assembly lay the foundation of all those horrors we have since heard of.</P>
<P>The magistrates in the different munici∣palities, chosen from the scum of the nati∣on, distributed these infernal writings among the people in their precincts, and particu∣larly among the young people. If, by chance, some magistrate was found, too scrupulous to execute their will, means were soon invented to get rid of him. Some pretext or other was never wanting to ex∣cite the mob to put an end to him and his resistance. Chatel, Mayor of St. Denys was one of this description. The mob were told that this man was the cause of the dear∣ness of bread. They flew to his house, and obliged him to reduce the price accord∣ing to their will; though it was well known, that he had not the power to reduce it at all unless at his own expence. The rabble were dispersing; but they had not fulfilled the bloody wishes of the revolutionary agents, who had nothing less in view than the lowering of the price of bread. They were instigated to return to the unfortunate magistrates. First, they attempted to hang him; but, wearied with his resistance, one of them took out his knife, and cut his head partly off, while several others prick∣ed him with their bayonets. The unhappy
<PB N="191" REF="030205_0191_0FE5143E4F5AF050"/>
victim was still alive after the back of his neck was cut assunder, and was heard to groan out: <Q>for heaven's sake kill me! kill me! you make me suffer too long!</Q>—The sanguinary villain, who had begun to cut his head off, now threw away his knife, and borrowed that of his comrade, with which he finished the work. When he found that his own knife was not sufficient, he said, with a cool indifference: <Q>lend me your knife, for mine is not worth a curse.</Q> That which was lent him was a little two-penny knife with a wooden handle.—During this time, other assassins gave him several stabs, with their knives, in the belly and stomach; one of them turned his knife slowly in the flank of the dying man, and said to him, laughing: <Q>Does that enter well? Don't you find the day-light peep into you?</Q>—He at last expired, after the most inconceivable torments. His body was dragged along the streets of St. Denys with his head tied to his feet.—A resolution of the town has since declared him innocent of any offence whatever: he had given abundant assistance to the poor the winter before: the diminu∣tion he had just made in the price of bread was at his own expence; and this barbarous punishment was his recompence. His wife went distracted, and has ever since been in a mad-house. His as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sins obtained pardon
<PB N="192" REF="030205_0192_0FE513DD38802838"/>
from the Assembly, a circumstance much less surprising, than that they should think it necessary to ask it. <HI>See du Gour's Me∣moire,</HI> page 57.</P>
<P>Examples of this kind, and such were wanting in very few parts of the country, could not fail to insure an implicit obedience on the part of the magistrates.</P>
<P>The debasement of religion was nearly completed by the public sale of the suppres∣sed churches and monasteries. The gros∣sest indecency presided at all these demoniac scenes. When the vile agent of the Assem∣bly, hammer in hand, had exhausted his auctioneer rhetoric, in recommending a church as an excellent barn, stable, or play∣house, it was knocked down to the base and avaricious speculator, while the hireling mob shouted applause. The church of St. Aldegonde at St. Omers (I love to cite in∣stances) the highest in that ancient town, and for hundreds of years the pride of its inhabitants, was sold to a <HI>Jew</HI> of Dunkirk, for the pitiful sum of 20,000 French livres in assignats, not more than 200 pounds ster∣ling; not half the cost of one of the pillars. This beautiful edifice by the spire of which the town was known at a great distance, had been chosen for destruction, that the humiliation of religion might be the more striking. It met with such treatment as
<PB N="193" REF="030205_0193_0FE5143FD7413F40"/>
might be expected from the hands of an in∣fidel. Its lofty spire was tumbled to the earth in less than a month: the body of the church was turned into a ropewalk, and the <HI>Jew</HI> proprietor, to complete the degrada∣tion of Christianity, left a representation of the Lord's Supper uneffaced in the chancel. What must be the grief, what the indigna∣tion of the thinking and pious part of the in∣habitants of St. Omers, thus to see their fa∣vourite church, the sanctuary of their God, and the God of their fathers, delivered, for a bundle of depreciated paper-money, into the hands of a descendant of the murderers of him, to whose worship it was consecrated!</P>
<P>To give the reader a just idea of the ribaldry of the scenes of brutal impiety, exhibited at the pillage of the convents, is totally impossible. A dozen or two of carts rattling along with a commissary at their head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowed by an escort of ragamuffins, decorated with a bit of three coloured ribbon, and armed with hammers, axes, crow-bars and spades, ge∣nerally formed the corps for such an expe∣dition. Hardly were the doors opened when the vaults rang with their hammering and their oaths. In a few hours the whole was gutted. The decorations of the altar, the priest's vestments, statues, pictures, books, manuscripts, the most precious pie∣ces of antiquity, the productions of long and
<PB N="194" REF="030205_0194_0FE513DEC5C93B50"/>
laborious lives of study, were hauled away as so much rubbish. The paintings on the doors, walls, ceilings, and other fixtures, were effaced or disfigured; the fury of the <HI>enlightened</HI> ruffians descended even to the graves of the deceased fathers.</P>
<P>At the expulsion of the nuns, the con∣duct of the revolutionists, was, if possible, still more swinish and cruel. While the gibing commissary pulled aside their veils to examine their faces, his blackguard at∣tendants congratulated them on the <HI>pleasures</HI> they were going to enjoy in the world, and this in a language calculated to raise a blush on the cheek of a common street-walker. They seemed to enjoy their tears, and even to make some sacrifices to augment them. Had any one a piece of needle-work which she wished to preserve, it was rent to pieces before her face. A singing bird that had the misfortune to have been the companion of the solitary hours of its mistress, was sure to be taken from her and killed. To these de∣jected and defenceless females, every insult and indignity was offered, not forgetting the last of which beastly libertines can be guilty.</P>
<P>In a country where the crucifix was sent to the mint, where churches were put up at auction; where the half-worn cassock, the surplice, and the veil, made part of the as∣sortment of a dealer in old-cloths, and were
<PB N="195" REF="030205_0195_0FE51442A9DC3B78"/>
exposed to public sale on the market-place; where the ministers of the gospel were scof∣fed at, reviled, and frequently murdered with as little ceremony as one would kill a dog; where the most daring blasphemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were uttered and published and spread through the country, not only with the per∣mission of its governors, but by their direc∣tion; in a country where all this was prac∣tised, religion could not be of long dura∣tion. Religion, and even the Catholic re∣ligion, did, however, still subsist in France, at least, in <HI>form.</HI> The Assembly had as yet passed no positive decree for its abolition. They had robbed the church, had stripped its altars, and degraded its ministers; but still the most pious and active of those mi∣nisters were left in the exercise of their functions. The parochial clergy, though deprived of the tithes, had a stipend allowed them. They yet remained with their pa∣rishioners, many of whom, indeed nearly all the elderly and sober part of them, conti∣nued as firmly attached to their pastors, as at any former period.</P>
<P>Things were not suffered to remain long in this state. The Constituent Assembly well knew, that they and religion could never exist for any length of time in the same country. The parochial clergy were
<PB N="196" REF="030205_0196_0FE514CD873DDDD8"/>
men of talents and industry. They gene∣rally decided all the little disputes between their parishioners; to which amicable capa∣city, they often joined that of physician or surgeon; and these their beneficent services were always rendered without fee or reward. Even the atheists and deists themselves had repeatedly acknowledged their virtuous modesty, and the great utility they were of to the community at large. Such a body of men, immoveably attached to the reli∣gion they taught, was truly formidable to the new tyrants. Religion had received a severe blow; but, if these men retained their cures, it might recover. Nay, what was still more dreadful, the monarchy it∣self might recover along with it; and it is not difficult to conceive, how an idea like this must haunt the minds of the pupils of the savage and impious Diderot, who hoped to see <Q>the last of kings strangled with the guts of the last of priests.</Q> In short, the parochial clergy, were the only men on earth they had now to fear, and these they got rid of by a stratagem worthy of an As∣sembly, the leaders of which joined to the most hardened wickedness, the profoundest dissimulation.</P>
<P>They laid aside the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> toge∣ther with the famous constitution, from which they took the adjunct to their name,
<PB N="197" REF="030205_0197_0FE5148FE2CF6C38"/>
and which we have since seen burnt by the hands of the common hangman (or rather common guillotiner) in that very city of Pa∣ris, where it had been issued amidst the ap∣plauses and even adorations of the populace. They laid aside the discussion of this instru∣ment of short-lived and ridiculous memory, to draw up another, which they were pleased to call, "the Civil Constitution of the Clergy." They were constitution mad, absolutely frantic.</P>
<P>It might be sufficient to say of this latter constitution, that it was just as subversive of religion as their other constitution was of every principle of government and sound po∣licy. They knew it to be in direct opposi∣tion to the very nature of the catholic reli∣gion: yet they had the assurance to tell the people, that it was not; they even went so far as to protest, that they would live and die in the religion of their forefathers, at the very moment when they were taking the surest measure in the world for destroying it. They were led to this hypocritical de∣claration from a fear that the body of the people were not yet ripe for a total abolition of religion, and, as we shall see in the se∣quel, this fear was not entirely unfounded. By persuading the people, that nothing was intended against their faith, they had an ad∣ditional handle against the clergy, by repre∣senting
<PB N="198" REF="030205_0198_0FE4FDC1CEE32458"/>
them as unfriendly to their "Civil Constitution," merely because it was neces∣sary to the support of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P>This instrument did not, however, pass into a law, without considerable resistance. There were yet some honest and virtuous men even among the members of the Con∣stituent Assembly. These had remained with them, not to aid in overturning the government, and effecting the dreadful revolution that has since rendered the coun∣try a slaughter-house, but to oppose the de∣structive measures of the philosophers, and, if possible save the sinking state. At the head of these was the learned and eloquent Abbé Maury. He opposed this "Civil Constitution," with all the powers of rea∣soning and all the charms of eloquence: but it was casting pearls before swine. When was an atheist open to conviction. The de∣cree passed, and was soon after followed by another, obliging the clergy to swear to ob∣serve and maintain the "Civil Constitu∣tion." This oath they could not take without breaking that which they had taken at entering into the priesthood; and that the Assembly had every reason to suppose they would not do. Whether they did or not, however, the end of their tyrants was answered: if they refused, they were to be driven from their livings; if they complied,
<PB N="199" REF="030205_0199_0FE5149217741EB0"/>
they must be looked upon as apostates, and be deserted by all those who were still attach∣ed to them. In either case the tottering re∣mains of religion must come to the ground. The clergy, and indeed the whole nation, and all Europe, saw the real object of this inhuman and impious decree; but the As∣sembly, surrounded with their <HI>enlightened</HI> myrmidons, the Parisian mob, bid defiance to earth and heaven.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, the clergy were re∣solved not to take the oath. <Q>Lose no time, said the Abbé Maury, in the de∣livery of your challenge. By shedding our blood you may ingratiate yourselves with your constituents. Lose, then, not a single moment. Your victims are here; they are ready. To their torments add not that of suspence. Why not vote at once for our execution, glut your hatred, and quench for a little your thirst for blood? Hasten, I say, while the power is in your hands; for remember, I now foretell, <HI>your reign will be of short durati∣on.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This prophetic address, which we have seen so fully verified, served only to inflame. Eight days only were given the clergy to determine on compliance or refusal, during which no stratagem that base and degene∣rate
<PB N="200" REF="030205_0200_0FE4FDC9D50EAFA0"/>
tyranny could devise, was left unessay∣ed to intimidate them. This was ever their practice, when they had an important blow to strike. Rochefoucauld, formerly a duke, declared, at the time the decree for the sei∣zure of the monasteries was under delibera∣tion, that <Q>the lives of the bishops and priests, in the Assembly, depended upon the passing of it;</Q> and, in order to silence all those who opposed it, a list of their names was stuck up on the walls, with a promise of a reward of <Q><HI>twelve hundred livres</HI> to any patriot, who would assassinate them.</Q> Ac∣cording to this laudable custom, this in∣stance of French liberty, when the day for taking the oath, or, as it was well termed, "the for-swearing day" arrived, the Assem∣bly took care to call in the aid of the fish-women and mob. <Q>To the lamp-post with the non-juring bishops and priests!</Q> was echoed from the streets and the galleries. The ruffians were prepared for murder, and were howling for their prey, like so ma∣ny wolves round a sheep-fold.</P>
<P>Let the reader imagine himself in the situation of one of these unfortunate cler∣gymen: an oath of apostacy before him, and a halter behind his back, and then let him give me his opinion of the <HI>rights of man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="030205_0201_0FE51493AAAE7F98"/>This did not intimidate the clergy, only thirty of whom could be prevailed on to submit, and these were already known to have abandoned their religion. When the oath was tendered to the bishop of Agen: <Q>Gentlemen, says he, I lament not the loss of my fortune; but there is another loss which I should ever lament; the loss of your esteem and my faith. I could not fail to lose both, if I took the oath now proposed to me.</Q> The old bishop of Poitiers, fearing he might lose so fair an opportunity of bearing testimony of his sin∣cerity, advanced to the tribune, and cal∣ling on the president to command silence; <Q>Gentlemen, said he, I am seventy years old; I have been thirty years a bi∣shop: I will never disgrace my gray hairs by an oath of apostacy.</Q> Upon this manly declaration of the reverend old pre∣late, the clergy rose from their seats, thank∣ed him for his example, and told the As∣sembly he had expressed their unanimous sentiments.</P>
<P>Not being a Roman Catholic, I hope I shall be excused, when I freely declare, that I much question, whether the ministers of any protestant communion, in a moment so terrible, surrounded with assassins and without a single friend, would have shown such a noble intrepidity. <Q>They have
<PB N="202" REF="030205_0202_0FE4FDCD2284E618"/>
lost their money,</Q> said the profligate Mirabeau on this occasion, <Q>but they have saved their honour.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Priestley (Fast Sermon of 1794, page 46.) says: <Q>When I was myself in France in 1774, I saw sufficient reason to believe, that <HI>hardly any per∣son of eminence,</HI> in <HI>church</HI> or state, and especially in the least degree eminent in <HI>philosophy,</HI> or literature, was a believer in christianity; and no person will suppose, that there has been any change in favour of christianity <HI>in the last twenty years</HI></Q>—The Doctor will allow, I suppose, that bishops are <Q>per∣sons of <HI>eminence</HI> in the <HI>church;</HI></Q> if he does, it will appear that he knew but very little of those of the French church, and that he formed a very rash opinion (to say the best of it) concerning their be∣lief in christianity; for, of <HI>one hundred and thirty eight</HI> bishops, only four, namely, Taillerand, Brienne, Jarante, and Gobet, took the oath of apostacy. But, he will say: I meant, <Q>those <HI>eminent</HI> in <HI>philosophy</HI> and literature.</Q> Ah! eminent in <HI>philosophy!</HI> here he is right. No, no; not one of the <HI>philosophical divines</HI> believed in christianity; they looked upon Christ, as the Unitarians do; that is, as a sort of "teacher:" but, to the honour of the French bi∣shops, there were but four of these philosophers amongst them. As to the other <HI>hundred and thirty,</HI> if they have not given a proof of their belief, I should be glad to know from the Doctor, what proof he will please to be satisfied with.—Their refusal to take the oath could be dictated by nothing but their be∣lief in christianity, and their determination not to dis∣honour it. Had not this been the case, they would have taken the oath, and preserved their fortunes. They were in a country were the mob do not, like those of Birmingham, content themselves with the execution of an <HI>effigy;</HI> they execute the person. Yet they remained at their post: they did not <HI>decamp in disguise.</HI> Even if they escaped the knives of the cut-throats, they knew that poverty, beggary, a linger∣ing existence, must be the price of their refusal. They could not <HI>bring an action against the city of Paris:</HI> no <HI>damages</HI> are granted by a jury in that country. They could not <HI>preach and prate against the govern∣ment</HI> with impunity? they could not <HI>transfer their property,</HI> and <HI>emigrate in open day.</HI> There are such things as national guards, municipalities, passports, halters, daggers, knives, drowning-boats, and <HI>the rights of man,</HI> in France. We have since seen several of these bishops, or men "of eminence in the church," refuse with the bloody poignard at their breasts, to take this oath. Would they have done this, had they been what Doctor Priestley has represented them to be? would they have done this, had they been atheists, or deists? nay, would they have done this, had they been <HI>Unitarians!</HI> If we are to judge from the conduct of the Doctor, they would not.—I will not take upon me to say, that the philosophical po∣litical divine meant to propagate an attrocious calum∣ny by this sermon of his: I shall only observe, that the sermon was preached long after the French bishops had given these undeniable proofs of their faith and sincerity.</NOTE> And, if this was
<PB N="203" REF="030205_0203_0FE514A0932AB530"/>
the case, what had the Assembly done? If, to <HI>preserve honour,</HI> it was necessary to refuse an obedience to their decrees, what sort of decrees must those be?</P>
<P>The Assembly were disconcerted by this firm resistance on the part of the clergy? they knew the clergy in general would ne∣ver take the oath, but they did not imagine
<PB N="204" REF="030205_0204_0FE4FE71F9D66968"/>
that those amongst themselves, would, amidst the vociferations of their cannibals, have the courage to give such a positive de∣nial. For a moment they felt abashed; but they were gone too far to think of re∣treating. The apostate Abbé Gregoire, whom we have since seen amongst the or∣ganizers of a pagan festival, was, on this occasion chosen to convince the clergy, that the oath might be taken, without any vio∣lation of their faith. After this, in order to deprive the clergy of an opportunity of defending their opinions in opposition to the oath, they were ordered to advance and take it at once. This decree had no effect: not a man advanced. Now the matter was brought to a point: the decree for enforcing the oath must be repealed, or the clergy must be driven from their livings, and those in the Assembly from their feats. It is hardly necessary to say that the latter was adopted: one tyrannical measure is the na∣tural and inevitable consequence of another.</P>
<P>A decree was now passed for the expul∣sion of all the non-juring bishops and priests, and for the choosing of others in their stead. From this day, it may be said, there was no such thing as an established religion in France. The ax had long been laid to the root of the tree; it was ready to fall, and this stroke levelled it with the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="030205_0205_0FE514A262C7B3A8"/>Had the dispute been about this or that tenet; had the oath been imposed with an intention of exchanging one religion for ano∣ther, the case would have been different; the expulsion might have taken place without any very considerable injury to the morals of the people. But, the struggle was that of religion against irreligion, that of chris∣tianity against atheism.</P>
<P>It was (I hope it is so no longer) the opinion of Doctor Priestley, and many other <HI>philosophical divines,</HI> that <HI>any change what∣ever</HI> was preferable to the continuation of the catholic religion in France. There is a passage in Moore's journal, which contains so complete an answer to every thing these gentlemen have advanced on this subject, that I am surprised, considering the princi∣ples of the journalist and his companion Lauderdale, that it ever found a place in that volume.</P>
<P>The Doctor, being at Abbeville, met with a protestant clergyman, whom he con∣gratulated on the deliverance of himself and his brethren, from the vexation of Romish persecution. The clergyman seemed to la∣ment, that along with the spirit of persecu∣tion, that of religion daily diminished. <Q>Upon which, says the Doctor, I ob∣served that, as nothing could be more opposite to true religion than a spirit of
<PB N="206" REF="030205_0206_0FE4FE77E29AE6E8"/>
persecution, the former, it was to be hoped, would return without the latter; but, in the mean time, the protestants were happy in not only being tolerated in the exercise of their religion, but also on being rendered capable of enjoying every privilege and advantage which the catholics themselves enjoy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are not allowed those advantages, resumed the clergyman, from any regard they bear to our religion, but from a to∣tal indifference of their own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whatever may be the case, replied I, the effect is the same with regard to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, said he, the effect might be bet∣ter, not only with respect to us, but to all France; for the spirit of persecution might have disappeared, without an in∣difference for all religion coming in its place: and in that case there would have been more probability of the true reli∣gion gaining ground; for it is easier to draw men from an erroneous doctrine to a true one, than to impress the truths of religion on minds which despise all religion whatever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, although you may not be able to make converts of them, I replied, still you may live happy among them, in the quiet possession of your own religion and all your other advantages.</Q></P>

<P>How fully, alas! has the opinion of this good clergyman been confirmed! here we see a man living upon the spot, a French∣man and a protestant, lamenting the de∣cay of the catholic religion, and trembling for the consequences. This man plainly perceived the drift of the philosophical le∣gislators: he saw that the destruction of all religion was their object, while they pretended to be correcting its abuses. Very far was he from saying, with our zealous reformers, that <Q>any change was preferable to the continuation of popery,</Q> and yet, I think, we ought to allow him to be as much interested in a change, and as good a judge of its conveniences and in∣conveniences, as persons on this side the sea; except, indeed, that he might not be <HI>enlightened</HI> by the rays of modern philoso∣phy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some of the French protestants, however, differ∣ed widely from this good man. The Calvinists of Nimes began massacreing the Catholics at an early pe∣riod of the revolution, under the pretext that they were <HI>aristocrats.</HI> About six hundred persons, of both sexes and of all ages, were butchered in their houses, in the streets and public squares, before they could even suspect their danger. These monsters attacked the convent of the Capuchins, forced it open, and pursued the venerable fathers to their dormitories and ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Five of them were left weltering in their blood at the altar's foot. One of these a very old man, craved five minutes while he committed his soul to God. The cool and deliberate villains granted his request. The intended butcher held a pistol in one hand and a watch in the other, and, when the five minutes were expired, shot him through the head. <HI>See Hist. of the French Clergy, page</HI> 71. <HI>French edition.</HI></P>
<P>This fact fully proves, that protestants can be as cruel as catholics. Let us not, then, imagine that we are secure from events of this kind, merely because the catholic religion is not established here. It was not a zeal for the Calvinistical religion that led the protestants of Nimes to commit these acts of barba∣rity: their knives were pointed, not against catho∣lics, as such, but as <HI>aristocrats.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

who had forsworn themselves, was re∣warded for his apostacy by the bishoprick of Paris. Vagabond philosophical abbés, who had never been able to obtain admit∣tance into the priesthood under the old government, were now not only accepted, but sought after. To these were added the secular priests and monks who had apostatiz∣ed. Even the wretches who had been ex∣pulsed from their cures, or orders, for irre∣gular or criminal conduct, were now called in from Germany and the low-countries. What a fight must it be, to those who yet preserved some respect for their religion and their country, to see these strollers, with their strumpets at their heels, return∣ing to take on them the care of the morals and fouls of a numerous people! after all, the number of apostates was insufficient: a great many parishes remained without any priest at all.</P>
<P>The installment of the new priests was commonly, not to say always, attended with tumult and violence. Many of their predecessors were knocked down, stabbed, or shot, at their church doors, the day, or day after, they had refused to conform. The priest of the village of Spet-Saux, while he was explaining to his parishioners his rea∣sons for refusing to take the oath, received
<PB N="210" REF="030205_0210_0FE4FE7C77D47B00"/>
a mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ket ball in his br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, and tumbled dead from the pulpit into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Where there was no resistance but on the part of the priest, an assassination put an end to the struggle; but, in some places, the resistance was more general. The pari∣shioners were divided; one part the champions of the apostate, and the other, those of the old priest. Church time was the moment for deciding these disputes, and the Church-yard the field of action. These affrays were often bloody; victory sometimes leaned to the side of justice; but, as the apostate appeared in person at the head of his troops, as he had the young peo∣ple generally on his side, and always the mob and municipal officers, with their na∣tional guards, he seldom failed to keep the field. Some of these wretches have been seen conducted to the altar to the sound of drums and trumpets, at the very moment when their partizans were murdering on the outside of the church.</P>
<P>The expelling of the parochial clergy tried the real sentiments of the body of the French people more than any one act of their tyrants ever did, before or since. Ge∣nerally speaking, the trial was honourable to them; for, if we except Paris, and some other places immediately under the influ∣ence of the revolutionary clubs, they wish∣ed
<PB N="211" REF="030205_0211_0FE514AF12150B28"/>
to retain their ancient pastors, and did not scruple to declare that wish, notwith∣standing the vociferations of hundreds of mob in the pay of the Assembly; not∣withstanding all these petty assemblies of subaltern tyrants, called municipal officers, who came to order them to receive an apos∣tate, <HI>in the name of the law;</HI> notwithstand∣ing thousands of spies and assassins, ever ready to betray and murder them; in spite of all these, whole parishes flocked round their priests, pressed them to continue, fol∣lowed them to the fields, and left the apos∣tates to say mass to the bare walls. Many of the latter, though they continued to re∣ceive the revolutionary salary for upwards of two years, never could boast of above three or four voluntary hearers.</P>
<P>Wherever this obstinate attachment to religion appeared, the Assembly knew how to make the refractory feel their authority. True tyrants, they suffered no one to thwart their will with impunity. Property, honour, conscience, all must yield to their sultanic decrees!</P>
<P>Condorcet, the atheist Condorcet, pro∣posed flagellation; and this was pretty com∣monly inflicted on the women and children who assisted at the masses of the non-juring clergy. The Abbé Barruel (page 79 of the
<PB N="212" REF="030205_0212_0FE4FE7F1BD53A98"/>
French edition) tells us, that three sisters of one of the Charity-houses at Paris, expired under the rods of the assassins. Ungrateful monsters! the lives of these women had been totally devoted to the service of the sick, the lame and the blind. By their vow they were excluded from the pleasures of the world, without being excluded from its pains. They had made a voluntary surren∣der of all they possessed, had assumed the garb, and submitted to the austerities of the monastic life, in order to devote them∣selves to the mournful occupation of attend∣ing on the <HI>poor</HI> who laboured under infirmi∣ties. It was said, they did this to secure themselves, a place in heaven; and most certainly they took the surest way. I feel a reluctance to call such people <HI>superstitious;</HI> for, if they were so, their superstition was of a most amiable kind, and surely nothing short of the principles of this hellish revolu∣tion could have hardened the hearts of men to scourge them to death, and that merely because they would not disgrace themselves by receiving the sacrament from the conta∣minated hands of an apostate.</P>
<P>It were endless to enumerate all the dif∣ferent sorts of persecution exercised against those who remained attached to their reli∣gion. Little children were beaten half to death; the hair and ears of women were
<PB N="213" REF="030205_0213_0FE514B0DC89B9A0"/>
cut off; they were mounted on asses, and led about in the most unseemly and shocking guise. The instance of John Can∣tabel deserves particular notice. Cantabel was an honest peasant, sincerely attached to the religion of his fathers. He happened to have a little catechism which had been pub∣lished by the non-juring clergy; it was found in his house; and this was a sufficient crime. A committee of municipal officers ordered the catechism to be burnt; a great fire was made; Cantabel was brought forth, and commanded to throw the book into it. "No," says the heroic peasant, <Q>it contains the principles of my religion; it has been my guide and my comfort, and it now gives me the courage to tell you, that I will never commit it to the flames.</Q> Upon this he was threatened, but still he remained resolute. One of the ruffians seized a flaming torch, and held it under his hand. "Burn on," said he, <Q>you may burn not only my hand, but my whole body, before I will do any thing to dishonour my religion.</Q> He was afterwards mounted on a horse, his back to the head, and the tail in his hand, and was thus conducted about amidst the shouts of the rabble. The vile wretches, when tired with their sport, suffered him to creep home, more dead than alive.—This is the <HI>liberty of

conscience</HI> in the <HI>"Age of Reason.!"</HI> This is the <HI>toleration</HI> we might expect from atheists, from these infidel philosophers, who are con∣tinually exclaiming against the prejudices of their forefathers, and against the sad effects of bigotry and religious zeal. In the cant of these <HI>enlightened</HI> reformers, this peasant was a <HI>fanatic,</HI> an <HI>aristocrat,</HI> a <HI>rebel to the law,</HI> and, as such, they will tell you that he was wor∣thy of death.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the partial opposition the apostates met with, and the horror their conduct, as well as their ministry ex∣cited in all good minds, they, at last, found themselves in possession of the churches, to the exclusion of the ancient priests. Such of these latter as had escaped death, were now bereft of all means of subsistence; they were therefore obliged to become a charge to their faithful parishioners. Had there been any such things as toleration and liber∣ty under the Constituent Assembly, these unfortunate men might still have found a retreat amongst their wealthy neighbours, that would have left them no reason to re∣gret the loss of their salaries. But the greatest part of their wealthy neighbours were already reduced to their own situation, and those who were not, knew that the re∣ception of a non-juring priest would amount to a proof of <HI>aristocracy,</HI> sufficient to lead
<PB N="215" REF="030205_0215_0FE514B262EF3CC0"/>
them to the guillotine. The expulsed priests were, then, obliged to take shelter in some obscure and miserable cabin, and often was the terror so great, that, like persons infec∣ted with the plague, no one would admit them beneath his roof.</P>
<P>From such a state of misery and humili∣ation, some fled in disguise to the countries surrounding France; some to recesses in the forests, whither the peasants of the neigh∣bourhood brought them the means of exis∣tence. Numbers, however, still remained in their towns and villages. Seeing the whole country swarming with assassins, they thought, perhaps, they might as well wait the stab in their own parishes as to seek it at a distance. Many, too, from age and infir∣mity, were absolutely incapable of travel∣ling; and, besides the small remainder of a life so full of bitterness, could not, with such men, be an object of sufficient impor∣tance to induce them to abandon those of their parishioners, who still sought their ad∣vice and consolation. Some were retained by their affection to their relations, or their parents; it is so hard to break the bands of nature, to tear oneself from all one holds dear, that the risk of death in competition with such a separation, loses half its terrors.</P>
<P>The ancient priests who remained in their parishes, or near them, though often oblig∣ed
<PB N="216" REF="030205_0216_0FE5145326F95F08"/>
to secret themselves, and though, to ap∣pearances, generally shunned, were resorted to by great numbers, particularly of the el∣derly people. I have already observed, that, among the youth, there was a pretty gene∣ral bias toward the apostates. Hence en∣sued such scenes of division and persecution as no country on earth except France ever witnessed. Friends were divided against friends; one branch of a family against another. It often happened that the parents treated their children as apostates, and the children their parents as aristocrats; quar∣rels and bloodshed were as often the conse∣quences. We have seen (page 29 of <HI>this volume</HI>) a son cut off the heads of his fa∣ther and mother, because they refused to attend at the mass of an apostate, carry the heads to his club, and receive applauses for the deed. Acts like this were not frequent; but others very near approaching it, were not only frequent but general. Sons, and even daughters, have been known to beat and lacerate their parents in the most cruel manner. Hundreds of both sexes have been led to prison and publicly accused by their children. A man at Faulconberg in Artois, blew his wife's brains out with his musket, and left her wallowing in her blood on the hearth with seven small children cry∣ing round her!</P>

<P>The apostate priests failed not to fan the flames of discord and division. To ingrati∣ate themselves with the young and igno∣rant, they mixed in all their amusements and debauches, treated them at their own houses, and instituted civic festivals for the mob, with whom they were continually surrounded. Their masses were sung midst the shouts of robbers and murderers, and
<PB N="218" REF="030205_0218_0FE51454F79ED4A0"/>
often interrupted by the arrival of some in∣nocent conscientious person, dragged in to assist at what he looked upon as a profana∣tion. Their churches resembled guard-houses, rather than places of divine wor∣ship. In proportion as they perceived them∣selves neglected and despised, their wrath against their unshaken predecessors increas∣ed. Vexed and humiliated to find, that all the respectable part of their parishioners took as much pains to avoid them, as to seek a communication with their old pas∣tors, the whole weight of their vengeance fell on these latter. In their existence itself they saw a memento of their own infamy. There is not a species of cruelty, that the most obdurate can devise, which they left unessayed. They hunted them from their retreats, from the houses of their friends and relations, from the woods and caverns even, to expose them to insult and murder. The infirmities of age, the tears of parents, nothing could soften the hearts of these apostate wretches. We have seen enough of the sufferings of the old clergy in the first Chapter of this work; but there is yet one instance which I must quote. <Q>I was at <HI>Trois Rivieres</HI> (says <HI>le voyageur de la Revo∣lution</HI>) a little village in Picardy. I saw several women running by the inn where I had put up; they all seemed much
<PB N="219" REF="030205_0219_0FE514BDDE6AD998"/>
alarmed. I asked the landlord what was the matter: he told me that the revolu∣tionary priest, provoked to find that none of the village attended at his mass, had been that morning to <HI>Ville D' Eu</HI> for a party of national guards, to aid him in driving the former priest from a little cottage, where he and his mother had taken shelter. The man gave me a most affecting account of this good priest, who was upwards of fourscore years of age, and who had been the rector of that place for more than fifty years. On the day he was to deliver his cure into the hands of the apostate, he summoned his little flock to meet him in the church for the last time. Not a soul was absent: old or young. The women carried their infants in their arms, and two old people, not able to walk were carried on couches. <HI>My children,</HI> says the old man, <HI>I have pres∣sed your tender hands on the baptismal font: I have sung the requiem for the souls of your fathers: I must now bid you an eter∣nal farewel, deprived of the consolation of leaving my ashes amongst you.</HI>—Here he ceased; tears stifled his voice: the sobs and cries of his audience rendered the scene too much for him.—While the land∣lord was speaking, we heard a discharge of muskets, and a loud shriek of woman.
<PB N="220" REF="030205_0220_0FE5145F848DD908"/>
We ran to the spot. The peasants of the village, about forty in number, had as∣sembled round the cottage with clubs to defend their pastor; but, the enemy hav∣ing fire arms, they had been obliged to give way, leaving two of their compani∣ons dead and several wounded. I now beheld a fight sufficient to melt the heart of a tyger. Two ruffians of the national guard were dragging out this venerable old man by the hair of his head, by those locks as white as snow. He had received a wound in his cheek, from which the blood ran down on his gar∣ments. In this situation was he led off, bare headed and bare footed, towards <HI>Ville D' Eu,</HI> while his poor old parent, who had been many years blind and dumb, remained on her bed, happily in∣sensible of the sorrows of her son. As the villains pulled him along, all the words he was heard to utter, were, My Mother! Oh! My Mother!—The women and children of the village followed the escort with cries and lamentations, till the savages drove them back with the points of their bayonets.</Q></P>
<P>Nor were those of the laity spared, who resorted to the old clergy for the ex∣ercise of the rites which they looked upon as essential. A new married couple hav∣ing refused to have the ceremony perform∣ed
<PB N="221" REF="030205_0221_0FE514BFAD5A9498"/>
by one of the apostates, a party of his myrmidons broke in upon them, the wedding night. The husband made his escape: the wife, in a swoon, became the prey of the party. They gratified their brutal passion, without gratifying their fe∣rocity. They tore off her breasts, as a tyger might have done with his claws, and threw them on the floor. They then left her to wait till death relieved her from her horrible situation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Hist. of the French Clergy, page</HI> 138.—I cannot help remarking here, that it is something won∣derful this <HI>History</HI> is not more known in America.— It is a proof, among hundreds, how locked up we have been to every thing that might lead us to a just estimation of the French Revolution.—It is true, the greatest part of the News-paper have set their face, against truth; but surely, were the presses free, we ought not to suffer ourselves to be kept in the dark by people, who are, probably paid for so doing.</NOTE></P>
<P>I should have scrupled inserting a fact like this, though taken from so respectable a work, if the former part of this volume did not contain others, if possible surpassing it: I say <HI>if possible;</HI> for I declare I know not which is most shocking, the tearing off a woman's breasts, or the ripping a child from her womb, and sticking it on the point of a bayonet. Indeed, the greatest part of the facts related here, are so much more shocking and terrific than any thing
<PB N="222" REF="030205_0222_0FE514611981ADA8"/>
we have ever before had an idea of, that common murders appear as trifling.</P>
<P>By means like these, the old clergy and their adherents were extirpated, and reli∣gion along with them. The business of the new clergy (if the wretches deserve the name) was not to establish one church on the ruins of another: it would be as pre∣posterous to suppose that an Assembly of Atheists and Deists had any such intention, as to suppose that a horde of apostates were calculated for the work. These latter were, in fact, so many missionaries of blasphemy and murder, sent into the provinces pur∣posely to destroy the ancient priesthood. The assembly foresaw that, when that was done, their new priests would at any time become the apostles of infidelity.</P>
<P>It must be confessed that these legislators did not want for cunning: an elegant wri∣ter has lately called them "architects of ruin;" and, indeed, they possessed the art of destroying in its utmost perfection. Their calculations with respect to their new priests were extremely just; they came out to an unit. When they had annihilated their predecessors, they were not only ready to second the decrees for the abolition of chri∣stianity altogether; they were not only in∣strumental therein, but they had led the way. Several began to teach the religion
<PB N="223" REF="030205_0223_0FE514C1364CE8D0"/>
of <HI>Reason</HI> in the Jacobin clubs, of which they were all members, and even in the pulpit. The garb of a priest itself became a burthen to them, and they humbly asked leave to quit it for the more honourable one of the national guard. The apostate bishop of Moulin, who had been consecrat∣ed by the unhallowed hands of <HI>Tailler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,</HI> wrote to the Convention that he officiated with a pike and liberty cap, instead of the croiser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the mitre. It was this vile wretch, who first caused to be written on the gate of the burying ground: <HI>"this is the place of everlasting sleep.</HI>—</P>
<P>Three weeks after this communication of the bishop of Moulin, <HI>Gobet,</HI> the new bi∣shop of Paris, with his Grand-Vicars and three other revolutionary bishops, came to the hall of the legislators and there abdicated chris∣tianity in form. They begged pardon of the injured nation for having so long kept them in the dark, by duping them into a belief of the divinity of an <HI>Impostor,</HI> whose religi∣on they now threw off with abhorrence, re∣solved in future to acknowledge no other deity than <HI>Reason</HI> alone!</P>
<P>It was not more than four days after this that a pagan festival was held in the Cathe∣dral Church of Paris. A woman named Memoro, the wife of another man, but the
<PB N="224" REF="030205_0224_0FE514630AF1E528"/>
strumpet of the vile Hebert, <HI>alias</HI> Father du Chêne, was dressed up as the <HI>goddess of Reason.</HI> Her throne was of green turf; an altar was erected at some distance, on which the priests burnt incense, while the legisla∣tors and the brutified Parisian herd were prostrated before the throne of the goddess <HI>Reason, alias</HI> Memoro, <HI>alias</HI> du Chêne.</P>
<P>About this epoch appeared the paganish republican calendar, with a decree ordering its adoption. This was intended to root from the poor tyranized people the very memory of religion; to dry up the only source of comfort they had left. They had been robbed of all they possessed in this world, and their inexorable tyrants wished to rob them of every hope in the next. Some say that this calendar itself was com∣posed by an apostate priest, others, that it was the work of a writer of farces, named Des Moulins. Whoever may be author, we know who has the honour of re-printing it and retailing it in this country.</P>
<P>It is true the last mentioned acts, the consummation of the most horrid blasphemy that ever man was witness of, took place under the Convention; but, what were they more than a necessary consequence of the measures of the Constituent Assembly? nay; the leaders in that Assembly boasted,
<PB N="225" REF="030205_0225_0FE514C2C3FE8D70"/>
when they had obtained the decree against the non-juring priests, that they had tricked the people out of their religion, before they perceived it. Nor is there at this time one of those who voted for that decree, who will not tell you, that christianity is a farce, fit only for the amusement of old folks, and that he rejoices in its abolition in France. This is not mere surmise.</P>
<P>Indeed, that their successors have only fulfilled their wishes, in this respect, there can be no doubt, if any judgment of the wishes of men is to be formed from their principles, their words and their actions. Who, I ask, that wished to preserve religion, would have passed a decree for the expulsion of every priest that refused to forswear him∣self? who, that did not wish to destroy re∣ligion, would have passed a decree for com∣mitting it to the care of apostates? Was it not clear, that such men would stick at nothing? That, at the nod of their masters, they would at any time be ready to blas∣pheme the God they pretended to adore? On the contrary, the Assembly knew, that there was no hope of their system taking root, while the ancient clergy remained in their cures. Among men, who gave up their all, and exposed themselves to almost certain death, rather than falsify their faith, they could not hope to find a <HI>Gobet.</HI> They
<PB N="226" REF="030205_0226_0FE5146493B8B4C0"/>
could not hope to find supple villains that would voluntarily depose the emblems of their religion on the altar of a strumpet, and confess themselves to have been the crafty ministers of an <HI>arch impostor.</HI>—</P>
<P>The oath tendered to the clergy was the touch-stone; it was to prove them; to know whom the Assembly could depend on for the accomplishment of their projects, and whom they could not depend on. The enforcing of the oath was the last blow to public religion in France, and therefore the destruction of that religion, with all its im∣moral and murderous consequences, is due to the Constituent Assembly, and to them alone. It is as nonsensical as unjust to ac∣cuse this or that faction, or even the Con∣vention itself, of exchanging Christianity for a system of paganism; infidels who adore an idol are as good as infidels who adore none; and where is the difference, whether the adored idol be Jean Jacques Rousseau or Madame Memoro? An adul∣tress is as good a goddess as an adulterer is a god at any time.</P>
<P>Let the reader now look back, and he will easily trace all the horrors of the French Revolution to the decrees of the Constituent Assembly. It was they that rent the government to pieces; it was they that first broached the destructive doctrine
<PB N="227" REF="030205_0227_0FE5146E8394D6F0"/>
of equality; it was they that destroyed all ideas of private property; and finally, it was they that rendered the people hardened, by effacing from their minds every principle of the only religion capable of keeping man∣kind within the bounds of justice and hu∣manity. Look also at their particular ac∣tions, and you will see them breaking their oaths to their constituents and to their king; you will see their agents driving people from their estates, beating and killing them; you will see them surrounded with a set of hireling writers and assassins, employed to degrade and murder peaceable people at∣tached to the religion of their forefathers; and you will see them not only pardoning murders, in spite of their poor humiliated monarch, but even receiving the assassins at their bar, covering them with applauses, and instituting festivals in their honour. What have the members of the Convention and their agents done more than this? They have murdered in greater numbers. True; but what have numbers to do with the matter? The principle on which those murders were committed was ever the same; it was more or less active as occasion requir∣ed. The wants of the Convention were more pressing than those of the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly were not driven to the expedient of <HI>requisitions,</HI> nor was
<PB N="228" REF="030205_0228_0FE51470274690C0"/>
the hour yet arrived for the promulgation of the paganish calendar. Consequently they met with less opposition, and therefore less murders were necessary; but, had they continued their fittings to this day the de∣vastation of every kind would have been the fame that it has been.</P>
<P>The whole history of the revolution pre∣sents us with nothing but a regular progress in robbery and murder. The first Assem∣bly, for instance, begin by flattering the mob, wheedling their king out of his title and his power; they then set him at defiance pro∣scribe or put to death his friends; and then shut him up in his palace, as a wild beast in a cage. The second Assembly send a gang of ruffians to insult and revile him, and then they hurl him from his throne. The third Assembly cut his throat. What is there in all this but a regular and na∣tural progression from bad to worse. And so with the rest of their abominable actions.</P>
<P>To throw the blame on the successors of the first despotic Assembly is such a perver∣sion of reason, such an abandonment of truth, that no man, who has a single grain of sense, can hear of with patience. As well might we ascribe all the murders com∣mitted at Nantz to the under cut-throats, by whom they were perpetrated, and not to the Convention by whose order, and un∣der
<PB N="229" REF="030205_0229_0FE4FDBEF7BADC68"/>
whose protection, these cut-throats acted. The Constituent Assembly knew the consequences of their decrees, as well as Foucault (<HI>See page</HI> 66) knew the conse∣quence of his order for throwing forty wo∣men from the cliff Pierre-moine into the sea; and it is full as ridiculous to hear them pretend, that they did not wish those con∣sequences to follow, as it would be to hear Foucault pretend, that he did not wish the forty women should be drowned. True, the Convention are guilty of every crime under heaven: assassins and blasphemers must ever merit detestation and abhorrence, from whatever motive they may act, or by whomsoever taught and instigated; but still the pre-eminence in infamy is due to their teachers and instigators: the Convention is, in relation to the Constituent Assembly, what the ignorant desperate bravo is in re∣lation to his crafty and sculking employer.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, it may not be impro∣per, as I have hitherto spoken of the Con∣stituent Assembly in a general way, to make some distinctions with respect to the persons who composed it. I am very far from holding them all up as objects of ab∣horrence, or even of censure. There were many, very many, men of great wisdom and virtue, who were elected to the Sates-General, and even who joined the Assem∣bly,
<PB N="230" REF="030205_0230_0FE514721CE92F20"/>
after it assumed the epithet <HI>National.</HI> It would be the height of injustice to re∣proach these men with the consequences of measures, which they opposed with such uncommon eloquence and courage. Histo∣ry will make honourable mention of their names, when the epitome I have here at∣tempted will be lost and forgotten. Suffice it then to say, that the weight of our cen∣sure, of the censure of all just and good men, ought to fall on those licentious poli∣ticians and infidel philosophers alone, who sanctioned the decree for the annihilation of property and religion.</P>
<P>Here, too, we ought to divest ourselves of every thing of a personal or party na∣ture, and direct our abhorrence to princi∣ples alone. As to the actors, they have, in general, already expiated their wicked∣ness or folly by the loss of their lives. We have seen the atheist Condorcet obliged to fly in disguise from the capital, the inhabi∣tants of which he had corrupted, and by whom he had been adored as the great lu∣minary of the age: we have seen him as∣sume the garb and the supplicating tone of a common beggar, lurking in the lanes and woods, like a houseless thief, and, at last, literally dying in a ditch, leaving his car∣case a prey to the fowls of the air, and his memory as a lesson to future apostles of

anarchy and blasphemy. Scores, not to say hundreds, of his coadjutors have shared a fate little different from his own; and those who have not, can have little reason to congratu∣late themselves on their escape. The tornado they had raised for the destruction of others, has swept them from the seat of their tyran∣ny, and scattered them over every corner of the earth. Those haughty usurpers who refused the precedence to the successors of Charlemagne, are now obliged to yield it to a peasant or a porter. They who de∣creed, that the "Folding-Doors of the Louvre should fly open at their approach," are now glad to lift the latch of a wicket, and bend their heads beneath the thatch of a cabin. And, what language can express the vexation, the anguish, the cutting re∣flections, that must be the companions of their obscurity! When they look back on their distracted country, when they behold the widows, the orphans, the thousands and hundreds of thousands of murdered victims, that it presents; when they behold the frantic people, carrying the dagger to the hearts of their parents, nay, digging their forefathers from their graves, and throwing their ashes to the winds; when they behold all this, and reflect that it is the work of their own hands, well might
<PB N="232" REF="030205_0232_0FE5147509A5F0B0"/>
they call on the hills to hide them. The torments of such an existence who can bear? Next to the wrath of heaven, the maledic∣tion of one's country is surely the most tre∣mendous and insupportable.</P>
<P>Now, what is the advantage we ought to derive from the awful example before us?—It ought to produce in us a watchful∣ness, and a steady resolution to oppose the advances of disorganizing and infidel princi∣ples. I am aware that it will be said by some, that all fear of the progress of these principles is imaginary; but, constant ob∣servation assures me, that it is but too well founded. Let any man examine the change in political and religious opinions since the establishment of the general government, and particularly the change crept in along with our silly admiration of the French Revolution, and see if the result of his in∣quiries, does not justify a fear of our falling under the scourge, that has brought a hap∣py and gallant people on their knees, and left them bleeding at every pore.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for America, Great Bri∣tain has thrown from her the principles of the French revolutionists with indignation and abhorrence. This, which one would
<PB N="233" REF="030205_0233_0FE514D0F4541288"/>
imagine should have had little or no influ∣ence on us, has served, in some measure, as a guide to our opinions, and has been one of the principal motives for our actions. A combination of circumstances, such as, perhaps, never before met together, has so soured the minds of the great mass of the people in this country, has worked up their hatred against Great Britain to such a pitch, that the instant that nation is named, they lose not only their temper but their reason also. The dictates of nature and the exercise of judgment are thrown aside: whatever the British adopt must be rejected, and whatever they reject must be adopted. Hence it is, that all the execrable acts of the French legislators, not forgetting their murders and their blasphemy, have met with the most unqualified applauses, merely because they were execrated in the island of Britain.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Republic</HI> has also done a great deal. France is a <HI>Republic,</HI> and the de∣crees of the legislators were necessary to maintain it a Republic. This <HI>word</HI> out-weighs, in the estimation of some persons (I wish I could say they are few in number) all the horrors that have been, and that can be, committed in that country. One of these modern republicans will tell you that he does not deny, that hundreds of thou∣sands of innocent persons have been mur∣dered
<PB N="234" REF="030205_0234_0FE5147DCA44A598"/>
in France; that the people have nei∣ther religion nor morals; that all the ties of nature are rent asunder; that the rising generation will be a race of cut-throats; that poverty and famine stalk forth at large; that the nation is half depopulated; that its riches along with millions of the best of the people are gone to enrich and aggrandize its enemies; that its commerce, its manufac∣tures, its sciences, its arts, and its honour, are no more; but at the end of all this, he will tell you that it must be happy, because it is a <HI>Republic.</HI> I have heard more than one of these republican zealots declare, that he would sooner see the last of the French ex∣terminated, than see them adopt any other form of government. Such a sentiment is characteristic of a mind locked up in savage ignorance; and I would no more trust my throat within the reach of such a republican, than I would within that of a Louvet a Gregoire, or any of their colleagues.</P>
<P>Our enlightened philosophers run on in a fine canting strain about the bigotry and ignorance of their ancestors; but, I would ask them, what more stupid doltish bigotry can there be, than to make the sound of a word the standard of good or bad govern∣ment? what is there in the combination of the letters which make up the word <HI>Repub∣lic;</HI> what is there in the sound they pro∣duce,

we are men as well as they, and con∣sequently are liable to be misled, and even to be sunk to the lowest degree of brutali∣ty as they have been. They, too, had an amiable character: what character have they now? The same principles brought into action among us would produce the same degradation. I repeat we are not what we were before the French Revoluti∣on. Political projectors from every corner of Europe, troublers of society of every de∣scription, from the whining philosophical hypocrite to the daring rebel and more dar∣ing blasphemer, have taken shelter in these States. Will it be pretended that the prin∣ciples and passions of these men have chang∣ed with the change of air? it would be folly to suppose it.</P>
<P>Nor are men of the same stamp wanting among the native Americans. There is not a single action of the French revolutionists, but has been justified and applauded in our public papers, and many of them in our public assemblies. Anarchy has its open advocates. The divine author of our reli∣gion has been put upon a level with the in∣famous Marat. We have seen a clergyman of the episcopal church publicly abused, because he had recommended to his congre∣gation to beware of the atheistical principles

of the French. Even their calendar, the frivolous offspring of infidelity is proposed for our imitation. Where persons, whose livelihood depends on their daily publicati∣ons, are to be found who are ever ready to publish articles of this nature, it were the grossest folly not to believe, that there are hundreds and thousands to whom they give pleasure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a truth that no one will deny, that the News-papers of this country are become its scourge. I speak with a few exceptions. It is said that they enlighten the people; but their light is like the torch of an incendiary, and the one has the same destructive effect on mind as the other has on matter. The whole study of the editors seems to be to deceive and con∣found. One would almost think they were hired by some malicious demon, to turn the brains and corrupt the hearts of their readers.</NOTE> But, we are not left to mere surmise here. How many numerous com∣panies have issued, under the form of toasts, sentiments offensive to humanity and dis∣graceful to our national character? We have seen the <HI>guillotine</HI> toasted to three times three cheers, and even under the dis∣charge of cannon. If drunken men, as is usually the case, speak from the bottom of their hearts, what quarter should we have to expect from wretches like these.

that the convives were not of the most despicable class. And, what would the reader say, were I to tell him of a mem∣ber of Congress, who wished to see one of those murderous machines, employed for lopping off the heads of the French, perma∣nent in the State-House yard of the City of Philadelphia?</P>
<P>If these men of blood had succeeded in plunging us into a war; if they had once got the sword into their hands, they would have mowed us down like stubble. The word <HI>aristocrat</HI> would have been employed to as good account here, as ever it has been in France.

<P>I know the reader will start back with horror. His heart will tell him, that it is impossible. But, once more, let him look at the example before us. The man who, in 1788, should have predicted the fate of the last humane and truly patriotic Louis, would have been treated as a wretch or a

madman. The attacks on the character and conduct of the irreproachable <HI>Washing∣ton,</HI> have been as bold, if not bolder, than those which led to the downfall of the un∣fortunate French Monarch. His impudent and unprincipled enemies have represented him as cankered with every vice that mark a worthless tyrant; they have called him the betrayer of the liberties of his country, and have even drawn up and published <HI>ar∣ticles of accusation</HI> against him! Can it, then, be imagined, that, had they posses∣sed the power, they wanted the will to dip their hands in his blood? I am fully assured, that these wretches do not make a hundred thousandth part of the people of the Union: the name of <HI>Washington</HI> is as dear and dear∣er, to all good men, than it ever was. But, of what consequence is their affection to him, of what avail to themselves, if they suffer him to be thus treated, without mak∣ing one single effort to defeat the project of his infamous traducers? It is not for me to dictate the method of doing this; but sure I am, that had the friends of virtue and order shown only a hundredth part of the zeal in the cause of their own country, as the enemies of both have done in the cause of France, we should not now have to lament the existence of a hardened and
