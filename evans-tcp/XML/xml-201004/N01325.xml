<P>I Having been desired to assist at the Ordination of Mr. <HI>Dickenson,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Task of Preaching was ordered to me, whereupon I remembring the Scope of what I offered at my own Ordination, nine years before, and thinking of no Subject more suitable and profitable for the Occasion, I kept to the Matter and Method of my former Discourse, so near as my Me∣mory would serve. But I was so often desired by one of the Ministers, to be very brief, because of the short Days and long Work which must follow, that I was necessitated to omit many Things which here I have incerted. But I had no thoughts of its being ever made publick, till near three

Months after (for what reason I know not) I was very earnestly desired by a man who lived far distant from that place, and was not a hearer of that Sermon, to give a Copy of it, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> might be printed. Whereupon I not being afraid to own my Doctrine, but especially considering how need∣ful this Doctrine is in these parts, consented.

<HEAD>The Great Concernment of Gospel Ordinances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Mark 16.16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>He that believeth and is bap∣tized, shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD at first created Man Upright, after his own Image, able to keep the Law of God perfectly, and to be sufficiently happy in so doing. But Man by sinning, lost his ability to keep the Command∣ments of God, lost Communion with God, and incurred his Wrath and Curse, and justly deserved everlasting Damnation: God might justly have left all Mankind to perish in this state, without any opportunity ever to be delivered; but it pleased God of his infinite Mercy, not to suffer all Mankind to lie under their deserved Punishment; but (the first way of Salvation by Works being lost, we being guilty of sin past, and can make no a∣mends,
<PB N="2" REF="001573_0004_0FB3DB50D68EEAE8"/>
nor perfectly obey for the future) God sent his Son to do for us, in our room and stead, what we cannot do for our selves, that now the way of Salvation is by <HI>Faith,</HI> to ap∣ply what he has done for us. Now as God might justly have left all the world without any opportunity ever to be saved, so it plea∣sed him to leave the most part of the world without the ordinary means, <HI>viz.</HI> the know∣ledge of the way of Salvation, till the coming of Christ, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.19, 20. And as a token that he is the only Saviour among all Nati∣ons, and he that brings Salvation into the world, so after his coming (and that directly so soon as his coming offering up himself was finished) not only <HI>Israel,</HI> but all Nations are called to believe in him, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.30. But the first way of Salvation which Man was created to, and created with a knowledge sufficient for the performance of the Condi∣tions of it, being lost, and there being a <HI>New Way</HI> of Salvation come in the room of it, which is not natural, so the knowledge of it is not natural, but must be acquired, &amp; there∣fore is revealed in the Gospel, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.21. which God at first revealed by his Prophets, and afterwards by his Son, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1 1, 2. and is com∣mitted
<PB N="3" REF="001573_0004_0FB3DB50D68EEAE8"/>
to writing in the holy Scriptures. But to help our ignorance of Gods Law, since the Fall, and our total Ignorance of the <HI>New Way of Salvation,</HI> God has appointed <HI>Men</HI> to be Officers in his Church, to instruct us in the way of Salvation, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.11. which is, by Gods appointment, become a necessary means, as by his help, may further appear.</P>
<P>In this Chapter we have the account of our Saviours Resurrection, Appearing to his Disciples, and giving them Commission to preach the Gospel, <HI>v.</HI> 15. to every Creature, <HI>per synecdochen generis,</HI> for every <HI>human Crea∣ture, i.e.</HI> to all the Children of Men, so far as they could, thro'-out the world; the effect whereof shall be according as they <HI>receive</HI> or <HI>reject</HI> it, <HI>i. e.</HI> Salvation or Damnation: No middle way.</P>
<P>I shall not at this time undertake to note every point of Doctrine and Principle of Faith that may be learned from the words, nor how far <HI>Baptism</HI> is necessary to Salvation, but thus far this Scripture, as it does not damn a person meerly for the want of Bap∣tism, so neither does it promise Salvation without. It seems the person that hath op∣portunity, and does not use it, cannot be assured.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001573_0005_0FB3DB52571E55C0"/>But by openly speaking from this Scripture, I shall occasion some to read the following words with the more observation, &amp; therefore hold it to be my duty to endeavour to prevent their mistake in the meaning of them, I say, thus much, That as God does use us as rati∣onal Creatures, so what he requiers us to be∣lieve (whether it be matter above our Rea∣son or not) he upon the first requiring it's Be∣lief, gives a rational Proof by Miracles, which being confirmed, the Miracles cease. Neither shall I insist upon shewing what that Faith is, that has the Promise of Salvation. It is not a bare assenting to the Truth; for that the Devils do, and more, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19. but it is a Faith, that being according to the Truth, o∣perates upon the Will, and works a change in the Person in whom it is, in his <HI>Love, Hope</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> His <HI>Love</HI> is changed, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.14 17 <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.21. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his <HI>Hope</HI> is not in any imaginary Innocence of his own, or good Works, or any thing but <HI>Gods free Grace, free good Will and Pleasure</HI> in giving us Justifica∣tion in the alone Merits of Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. He labours after all Holiness of Life, not as a <HI>Cause</HI> of his Salvation, but as the <HI>beginning</HI> of his Happiness, as his <HI>Duty</HI> to God, as a <HI>proof</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001573_0005_0FB3DB52571E55C0"/>
of his Faith, and as a means or condition of its being increased. <HI>&amp;c. Psal.</HI> 40.8. <HI>Job.</HI> 14.15. <HI>Jam.</HI> 2. latter end.</P>
<P>Neither does the Text lead us to enquire who is the <HI>efficient Cause</HI> of saving Faith, but it shews us the <HI>Instrumental Cause,</HI> which has the promise of a blessing to him that diligent∣ly attends it, and which Christ has purchased, not only for <HI>Israel,</HI> but for us <HI>Gentiles,</HI> of which this present Occasion is an Effect, and therefore calls for our great Thankfulness</P>
<P>From what lies before us, <HI>viz.</HI> the Effect of the Preaching of the Gospel, or rather the necessary Consequence of its being <HI>received</HI> or <HI>rejected</HI> (with Baptism, implying the other Ordinances) as we have it in our Text, a∣mongst other profitable things, we may learn this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE,</HEAD>
<P>That the Ordinances of the Gospel, and especially the Preaching of it, is that where∣in Mens Salvation and Damnation is con∣cerned. A weighty! a frightful Considera∣tion! which we should concern our selves a∣bout with joy and trembling, <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.11.</P>
<P>This Truth is visible, needs no proof, but Improvement and suitable Meditations,
<PB N="6" REF="001573_0006_0FB3DB53D74D39A8"/>
which it is now my endeavour, with Gods assistance to help you to.</P>
<P>But, <HI>first,</HI> If it be enquired, <HI>Wherein are the Ordinances of the Gospel, things that con∣cern the Salvation and Damnation of Men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. First,</HI> The Preaching of the Gospel reveals to us his Mind &amp; Laws, who rewards with Salvation &amp; punishes with Damnation. All Law-givers make Laws to reward or punish, according to the Deed or Offence, &amp; according to the Authority of the Law-giver. A King (if he see cause, and the crime deserve it) punishes with Death, and his Wrath is as Fearful, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.14. The King of Kings has it in his power to punish with Damna∣tion, and he only, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.4, 5. and so much the more Terrible is his <HI>Fear, Psal.</HI> 76.7, 12. A King gives great Rewards: The Lord re∣wards answerable, as he is above Kings, with such Glory, Honour and Joy, that in the least Saint shall surpass all the Glory of all the Kings on Earth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.25. not for any de∣serving of ours (for he needs not to thank us) but of his meer Grace. But the nature of a Crime or Offence against God deserves no less than Damnation. Justice must inflict it except it be taken off by Christ. That done
<PB N="7" REF="001573_0006_0FB3DB53D74D39A8"/>
against the King may deserve <HI>Death,</HI> which against a mean Man would be a small offence. Consider the Majesty of him whose Law is broke, and he despised who made the Law, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.16. Consider the dreadful aggre∣vation of evil, in preferring a small Pleasure before God and his Authority, and Love! Zech. 11.13. <HI>A goodly price that I was valu∣ed at by them.</HI> Consider his pure and infinite Holiness, Hab. 1.13. <HI>Of purer Eyes than to be∣hold evil.</HI> Consider his dreadful Threatning to every breach of his Law, Gal. 3.10. <HI>Curs∣ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</HI> which Curse is to hell, <HI>Mar.</HI> 25.41. and no wonder when the Authority of God is de∣spised; If there be one thing that a Person does not continue to do, if at one time in one thing he transgress the Law, he is under the Curse, and this Curse all lie under that are not re∣leased by Christ applyed by Faith. About these things the Gospel reveals Gods mind to us, and therefore concerns our Salvation or Damnation.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The whole concernment of the Gos∣pel and it's Ordinances, is about Mens Salva∣tion and Damnation, which is therefore con∣cerned in it.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="001573_0007_0FB3DB55562196A0"/>3dly, It is (especially the Preaching of the Gospel) necessary in order to escape from the Wrath of God, due to us for Sin, (we are all till delivered) under Gods Wrath and Curse which necessarily brings Damnation, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3 <HI>And were by nature the Children of Wrath, even as others.</HI> Rom. 3.19. <HI>That every mouth may be stopped, and all the World become guilty before God.</HI> It is Christ that Redeemed us from the Curse, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13. It is by Faith that we come to Christ, this Faith cometh by hearing, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.13.14. <HI>All that call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved, but how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a Prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her?</HI> vers. 17. <HI>So then Faith cometh by hearing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This plainly shews the necessity of a Prea∣cher, in order to Salvation. But to under∣stand this, consider,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Man has necessity of a Revelation of more then he can know without (since the fall) in order to Salvation, as has been shewed, see also <HI>Hos.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, God does not want Men as Instru∣ments, nor the help of any outward means
<PB N="9" REF="001573_0007_0FB3DB55562196A0"/>
to make known to us the way of Salvation; He can, if he please, reveal himself and his Son (whom it is eternal Life to know, <HI>John</HI> 17.3.) without the use of any means, to one that never heard of his Name; but if he has not promised it (as he has not) then it is Presumption, and not Faith) to believe he will, especially seeing he says, it is his <HI>Plea∣sure</HI> (Mark, not his <HI>Necessity</HI> but his <HI>Pleasure</HI>) by as <HI>foolish</HI> a thing as Men count Preaching (and as foolish a thing, as uncapable a thing as it is in it self) to save them that believe, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.21 And he that will venture his Soul, and the Souls of his Children upon a meer persumption, believing what God has rather said he will not do, than that he will do it, must fare according to his works, and have his reward where he got his Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, It is not the virtue or powerfulness of the Man, nor his Arguments, that makes the Word Preached effectual to conversion or edification, but it is meerly the blessing of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.6. So it is God and his Pow∣er that gives the effect, and the outward means is to be used only because of his Ap∣pointment and Institution, because it is his pleasure; As <HI>Moses</HI> lift up his Rod to work
<PB N="10" REF="001573_0008_0FB3DB56D674B7E0"/>
the Wonders in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and divided the Sea. Had not <HI>Moses</HI> obeyed and used the sign, it had not been done; yet what virtue had <HI>Moses's</HI> Rod to do it? So it is the Institution of God, not the Virtue, Wisdom or Grace of the Man [the Preacher] that causes the Blessing. And therefore our Saviour bid the People hear the Phraisees, and do their words because of their Office, sitting in <HI>Moses</HI> Seat, and teaching Truth. And this, by the way, may serve to solve the Question, <HI>Whether it be duty to hear a Wicked Man, while he holds the Office of a Minister, and teaches Truth?</HI> The Priest, in our Saviours time was a Wicked Man, and yet our Saviour owned him in his Office, and sent the Man healed of the Le∣prosie to him. The Sons of <HI>Ely</HI> were scan∣dalously Wicked, and yet God owned them in the holiest part of their Office, <HI>i. e.</HI> to carry the Ark, which if another Man touched, he presently dyed; though God punished their wickedness, as he had threatned before, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.34. It is another Question, <HI>Whether a Wicked Man, that is found to be so, should be continued in the Ministry?</HI> For certainly he ought to be turned out by those that have power to do it. But while he stands in his
<PB N="11" REF="001573_0008_0FB3DB56D674B7E0"/>
place, he ought to be heard, provided he teach the Truth; For false Doctrine is the Souls Poyson, and ought not to be heard (at least not in a way of Worship) St. <HI>Paul</HI> re∣joyces when the Gospel is taught, though by Wicked Men out of Envy; but prays for a curse upon him that teacheth false Doctrine, though it be himself, or an Angel from Hea∣ven, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.8. <HI>Phi.</HI> 1.15.18.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, No Man has power of himself (con∣sidered as a wise man, a learned man, and a good man) to speak any thing to Edificati∣on, but as God who knows the hearts and state of all Men, does by his holy Spirit guide, direct and assist him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. Which we are to seek, pray and wait for in the way of diligent study, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But in this, so well as the former, it is to be allowed, that study has a proper Tenden∣cy, and publick Preaching &amp; private Reading and Discourse, have a proper Tendency to perswade to duty, and convince of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>First,</HI> It is Gods Institution that makes it Warrantable to use them and in that they are like <HI>Moses</HI> Rod.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The perversness of mans Nature is, such, that this Tendency will not be effectual,
<PB N="12" REF="001573_0009_0FB3DB5856191EA8"/>
except Gods Grace incline the heart, and give the blessing, as to <HI>Moses</HI> Rod.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, When men are perswaded, it is yet a further work of Gods Mercy. Grace that works a Change in the heart unto Conver∣sion and Edification, which he ever gives to an obedient seeking in his way, as he gave the wonders to be wrought upon <HI>Moses,</HI> his obedience in lifting up his Rod, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus far at present concerning the necessity of the Gospel preached in order to Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, The Gospel preached, and its Or∣dinances administred, have always influence upon the Souls of the hearers or receivers, bringing them nearer to Salvation or to Damnation, increasing the one or the other, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.16. <HI>To the one we are a savour of Death unto Death, and to the other a savour of Life unto Life,</HI> Isa. 55.10. Our Food always does us either good or harm.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, There were no occasion of the Or∣dinances of the Gospel, were it not in order to our state in the next world.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, if it be enquired, <HI>How the Salvation &amp; Damnation of men is concern∣ed in the Ordinances of the Gospel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1st, In respect of <HI>What</HI> is preached, and the manner of it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="001573_0009_0FB3DB5856191EA8"/>2dly, In respect of what <HI>Improvement</HI> is made of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> is intended in the Text. The <HI>first</HI> has relation to it.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first,</HI> in respect to <HI>What</HI> is taught. 1st. In respect to the Truth or Falshood of it, our Souls are concerned. 2dly. In respect to the Nature of it, whether it be of great concernment to be taught, or not? And also, Whether it be that wherein the Souls of the hearers are much concerned, or not? For there may be many things true, which will not do the hearers much good or harm; and some things will do more good than others, and to some persons more than to others, <HI>I</HI> mean, they have such a tendency, and some things are as life to the Soul, when applyed, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.63, 68. Thus our Souls are concerned, not only in the truth or falshood of what is taught, but also in the Profitable∣ness and Usefulness of it. This seems to be partly intended, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.4.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, In respect to the <HI>Manner</HI> of Teach∣ing, it has a tendency to be more or less pro∣fitable, as the Method, Arguments, Expres∣sions, Fervency, Voice, Gesture, and Exam∣ples of the Teacher, and also, the evidence
<PB N="14" REF="001573_0010_0FB3DB59D65D1CE8"/>
of a Sence of the Needfulness and weight of the Doctrine, &amp; an affection to do his hearers good: These things should be diligently striven for, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15. <HI>Study to shew thy self approved unto God, a Work-man, that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</HI> But the latter of these things (especially) is out of the power of Man, and depends purely upon the assistance and grace of the holy Spirit (<HI>I</HI> mean, to be affected) and he gives and with-draws as he pleaseth, and that some times in Mercy, and somtimes in Judgment; sometimes for encouragement and edification, and sometimes for chastize∣ment, and that to the Hearers, or to the Preacher, or both; therefore both ought to labour, watch, pray, strive, and to the ut∣termost improve the Grace given.</P>
<P>But if any ask, <HI>Why is all this needful, see∣ing it is not the power or virtue of the Man, or his Arguments, but the Grace of God that gives the Success?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1st, Because it is the pleasure of God to require Means, as the Condition of his Blessing, so the suitabler the Means are, the more they have of the nature of Means in them, and it comes the nearer to the In∣stitution.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="001573_0010_0FB3DB59D65D1CE8"/>2dly, God delights to give his Grace to the diligent seeker, but has promised nothing to the idle person. But God does not tye his blessing wholly to the strength of Means, but sometimes encourages humble diligent En∣deavours with a blessing upon weak Means, and sometimes he chastens or punishes Negli∣gence or carnal Confidence, by denying a blessing upon strong Means.</P>
<P>There is also special Influence upon the Salvation and Damnation of men, by the Examples of others, especially of the Mini∣sters of the Gospel, and that especially in Ig∣norant persons.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> With respect to what Improve∣ment is made of the Ordinances of the Gos∣pel by the hearers, their Salvation or Dam∣nation is concerned, and herein most of all, provided Gospel Truth be taught; and up∣on this lies the stress of our Text.</P>
<P>He that has plain wholsom Food may live by feeding upon it, when he that has the best Food in the world, will starve, if he do not use it.</P>
<P>The Ministers Work is to teach wholsom Doctrine, such as his hearers need, and ap∣ply it as Food or Physick, according to the
<PB N="16" REF="001573_0011_0FB3DB5B597A9158"/>
need, and if he neglect, the Soul of the hearer dyes, and his <HI>Blood is required at the neglect∣ers hands,</HI> Ezek. 33.8.</P>
<P>But if the Minister do never so well, it yet depends upon the <HI>Improvement</HI> made by the hearer. Many of our Saviours hearers did not profit; and of such we read, <HI>Psal.</HI> 58.5. <HI>who will not hearken to the Voice of the Charmers charming never so wisely;</HI> and our Text tells us of such, that they shall be <HI>Damned.</HI> But some think they believe, and are free because they assent to the Truth, <HI>and so does the Devil;</HI> but 1 Joh. 3.3. <HI>he that hath this Hope purifieth himself.</HI></P>
<P>And here I must endeavour to cut off an ignorant Delusion which undoes Thousands. Because we have all Imperfections and In∣firmities in this World, many excuse them∣selves from necessary and practicable Duty, under the notion of not being perfect. Say thy, <HI>That was a good Sermon, could I practise but the half of it, I should be happy.</HI> Says another, <HI>Our Minister preaches excellent well, he that does practise one quarter of it well, needs not fear,</HI> or <HI>it is well with him.</HI></P>
<P>To answer these, I must teach you to di∣stinguish. There are some things belong∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="001573_0011_0FB3DB5B597A9158"/>
to the Law which we must diligently endeavour to do, and strive after, or we cannot be saved: There are things that we must do in part, and he that does heartily strive to do them, and does really perform in part, and follow after a greater measure, is forgiven, and accepted in Christ. There are other things belonging to the Gospel, which we must certainly do, or we cannot be saved, as <HI>Repentance, Faith, Prayer, Love, &amp;c.</HI> Now if the Preacher rightly divide the Word, laying down what is to be stri∣ven after, as such, and what must surely be done, as such, and therein teach the Truth, then, I say, you must surely practise all, or you cannot be saved; whatever your ex∣cuses are, if you do not, you deceive your self, <HI>James</HI> 1.22. <HI>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</HI> You may build your self a hope, but your building is in the Sand, and our Saviour says it will fall, and great will be the fall thereof, because you heard these Sayings of his and did them not, see <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. and <HI>John</HI> 13.17. <HI>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them;</HI> Not otherwise, but if ye do them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="001573_0012_0FB3DB5CDCC5CC88"/>Object. <HI>But who can remember all the Ser∣mons that ever he hears, to practise all?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Tho' you cannot remember all the <HI>Arguments,</HI> yet you may remember all the <HI>Duties,</HI> and so much of the Arguments as may satisfie you in the Duty or other Truth, and move you to follow it; and also, so much as to go away with your heart affect∣ed, your convictions, hopes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> increased, your Love, Zeal, Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> quickened. Our Duties are not so many, nor the Dire∣ctions, how to perform them, so many, but an ordinary Capacity may retain them.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What need we then so much to learn?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1st, Because we are very apt to forget the Duties we know. 2dly, We are very apt to forget the Need of them, and so need quickning. 3dly, It is Gods appoint∣ment, and that ought to be reason enough for us. A living Man loves his Food, and he that is alive from sin, loves to feed upon the Truth, and to be put in mind of it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.1. Only knowing, will not do, nor Practice, unrenewed; see 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.12. A Preacher's Work is not only to teach New things, but <HI>To put us in mind</HI> of what we

know already, altho' we be established in present Truth. 4thly, What we do know, we may learn to know better.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But if it be God only that gives the Increase, to what purpose shall we strive?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> God does not give the Increase without us, but within us, and in and upon our striving, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.12. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.12, 13. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trem∣bling. For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.</HI> You know, that God works no increase in you by his Word, if you do not practise, but disobey it. If there be need for the Mi∣nister to preach, there is need for you to hear and practise; for that is all the use of Preaching. And we see in our Text, that the Ministers are commanded to preach, and in this case we are told, <HI>Luke</HI> 8.16. <HI>No man having lighten a Candle puteth it under a Vessel, &amp;c.</HI> Therefore it is as much a sin for you to neglect to hear or practise, as for the Minister to neglect to preach.</P>
<P>Again, Mens being Saved or Damned does also much depend upon the manner of the hearers attendance, 1st, According to what our Expectation is. If we expect E∣dification,
<PB N="20" REF="001573_0013_0FB3DB5E581D33D8"/>
or not, expect it according as we esteem the Preacher, and so relie upon the Instrument, and not upon the meer Grace of God, and his blessing upon his Ordinance, it is a sad sign: We ought to seek the best means, but trust in God alone, and believe he is able as well to bless the weakest as the strongest means, and so thankfully attend the Means which he is pleased to give, and not be carnally confident when we esteem the Preacher, nor discontent when we esteem him not, lest God in his just Judg∣ment leave us to his Curse, and to be deluded by the Devil, and made to think what he please, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.5, 6, 7, 8. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Cursed is the Man that trusteth in Man; for he shall be like the Heath in the Desart, and shall not see when good cometh,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Blessed is the Man that trusteth in the Lord; for he shall be as a Tree planted by the Waters,</HI> &amp;c <HI>neither shall cease from yeilding Fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, If we attend with fervent Desire of Edification, it is a good sign, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5, 6, <HI>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after Righteousness, for they shall be filled:</HI> When it is thus with us, we receive the Truth, and Directions for our help, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> as
<PB N="21" REF="001573_0013_0FB3DB5E581D33D8"/>
sweet Honey, <HI>Psal</HI> 19, 10, when the full Stomach loaths the Honey Comb:</P>
<P N="3">3dly, If with Patience we attend, wil∣ling to wait Gods time by diligent striving, Lam. 3.25. <HI>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that seeketh him,</HI> not a sitting still to wait, but a watchful patient waiting, as you may see <HI>Hab.</HI> 2. <HI>I will stand upon my Watch,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Tho' it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry,</HI> Psal. 40.1.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. If a Self-denying Frame we attend, willing to practise and believe, tho' it be a cross to do it, Isa. 28.9 <HI>Whom shall he teach? Them that are weaned,</HI> &amp;c. When a person is not willing to deny himself, he is not in a condition to receive the Truth, which always goes cross to our evil nature; and this very thing causes some to oppose the Truth, and some only to oppose the Minister of it, but keeps all that are ruled by it, from getting good, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.11. <HI>Because they received not the love of the Truth, God shall send them strong Delusions, that they should believe a Lye, that they all might be Damned,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, If it be attended with a peaceable
<PB N="22" REF="001573_0014_0FB3DB5FD5D13868"/>
Frame towards our Fellow Creatures, <HI>James</HI> 1.21. he that bears Malice or seeks Revenge cannot have his sins forgiven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.14, 15. therefore God does not hear the Prayers of such, and therefore does not edifie their Souls by his Grace, nor bless to them his Ordinances.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, If it be attended with a suitable Performance of <HI>Duties</HI> before and after, as Prayer, Meditation, and also with an attentive Mind in the time of it.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, If it be attended with Constancy, upon this Condition the Blessing is promised, Prov. 8.34. <HI>Blessed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily,</HI> &amp;c. By once missing to attend, when it was your Duty to hear, you may miss of hearing the very words which God would have made the words of eternal Life to you. I may here apply for once Mat. 24.42. <HI>Watch, for ye know not the hour, &amp;c.</HI> Some come and hear now and then, and get little good, as appears by their coming so seldom. They observe, <HI>That it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s them little good,</HI> and their Observation is too true. Thus far they are right. But here the way parts, and they go the quite contrary way; for the right is to reason
<PB N="23" REF="001573_0014_0FB3DB5FD5D13868"/>
thus, <HI>Why have I got no more good?</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer is ready, God has not promised it. But <HI>Why has he not promised it? Ans.</HI> Be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause I did not attend with Constancy. This way of arguing would bring a person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be a steady hearer, and might prove to be for his Salvation; but they go as directly contrary as East from West; and because they, by being no constant hearers, get no good, they, instead of mending, grow the worse, and come the less, thinking it not worth while. And this proves to be for their Damnation.</P>
<P>Here is too little said, but I must leave room for the <HI>Application,</HI> by way of Information.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>First,</HEAD>
<P>Is it so, that the Gospel preached, and its Ordinances, concern Mens Salvation and Damnation? Then surely the choicest, the ablest and wisest of the Children of Men should be the Ministers of it. We use to take the capablest men for the most difficult and dangerous Work. It is too great a work to be trusted in the hands of an unskil∣ful person. As God is pleased to make use of Mens Abilities and Means, so a part of
<PB N="24" REF="001573_0015_0FB3DB61571F72E8"/>
the nature of the Means consists in the Ability of the Instrument. It is surely the greatest Work that ever Man was imploy'd in; and surely no man need account himself too great to be imployed in it; for it con∣cerns the very end of our being, and the One Thing needful; and who is sufficient for these things? 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2, 16.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Secondly,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Salvation and Damnation of Men concerned in the Ministry of the Gospel? Then it is not a Work to be undertaken with a light Frame of Spirit. Who that is sensi∣ble of it, can undertake it, but with Fear and Trembling. This and that Man and Woman is like to be Saved or Damned, ac∣cording to your Faithfulness or Unfaithful∣ness, Prudence or Imprudence in the Work of the Gospel. He that hears, to be instru∣cted, has cause to Tremble, because his own Soul is concerned; surely then he that teaches, because many Souls are concerned, seeing also, the Blood of those that perish by his neglect, shall be required at his hands. He that has not an awful Sense of this, is not fit for so sacred a Work. This may serve for a lively Motive to pray to God for
<PB N="25" REF="001573_0015_0FB3DB61571F72E8"/>
Grace, Preservation, Faithfulness and As∣sistance in so weighty a Work.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Thirdly,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Ministry of the Gospel so awful a Work? Then the Ministers of it ought to be freed from all other Cares and Incumbran∣ces, that they may have no hindrance in attending that Work, which cannot be too well managed, and is enough to imploy the head and heart, and all the strength of the best, wisest and ablest Man on earth. It is very displeasing to God, and a woful wrong to the Souls of the hearers, if the Minister, through Necessity, or Worldliness, or Idle∣ness, or any other hindrance, be prevented from making the Work of the Ministry his whole Imployment, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2, 4, <HI>No Man that warreth, entangleth himself with the affairs of this life,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4, 15, 16, <HI>Me∣ditate on these things, give thy self Wholly to them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>In doing this thou shalt save thy self, and them that hear thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But seeing no man is able to speak a word in season, nor think a thought of himself, to Edification, but as it is given him by the Spirit, What needs all this devoting a man wholly to that Work, when by all
<PB N="26" REF="001573_0016_0FB3DB6328E2FAE0"/>
his study he can have no more than what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given him?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No more can we work in our selves Faith or any Grace; but God makes our striving the Condition of his giving, yea, and the instrumental cause of it too, in many things. We eat to live, but God gives us Life and Nourishment by our Food, which if he deny, we languish and dye. And so necessary is diligent study; see also <HI>Psal.</HI> 127. <HI>Except the Lord build the House, the Work-Man labours in vain.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. <HI>It is said, Take no thought what ye shall say,</HI> &amp;c. Luke 12.11.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1st. That was only when they should be brought before Rulers for Christs sake▪ Not when they were to Preach.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is said, but a little further in the same Chapter and discourse, <HI>vers.</HI> 22 <HI>Take n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought for your Life, what ye shall eat,</HI> &amp;c. The meaning is, Do not distrust Gods mercy and care for you, tho' ye see no way to an∣swer, or to be provided for; your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of these things, and he is a faithful Father, and will not leave you while ye are found in the way of your duty. This all believe to be the
<PB N="27" REF="001573_0016_0FB3DB6328E2FAE0"/>
meaning of the letter, and think it a sinful presumption to take it in the proper litteral sense, and forbear labour; which is yet spoke in the same sense with the former. But other Scriptures require a dutiful Industry in both, and to trust in God for his blessing thereon. We are not to look that God will give us without Means, where he has given Means to be used, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.10. <HI>The Prea∣cher sought to find out acceptable words.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fourthly,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Preaching of the Gospel of so great Concernment? Then it is a Work too sacred for Men to undertake for a <HI>Livelihood,</HI> as their Motive, or for the sake of Riches or Honour, if these are to be gotten by it, as they seldom are, but on the other hand Re∣proach and Trouble in this world. Shall a man make this World his Aim, when there is so great a Mark as the Salvation of Souls? He that does it is not likely to obtain any thing higher for his pains. He is not fit for the Ministry who does not make the great end of it his very Motive, <HI>Not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why then must Ministers be main∣tained,
<PB N="28" REF="001573_0017_0FB3DB6519412238"/>
and have their Livelihood for their Labour?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Not properly as their Reward, but that they may be able to attend the Mini∣stry without worldly Cumberment, which otherwise cannot be, without a Miracle; and we are not to look for Miracles, where God has given Means, and this Means God has commanded, and expects it of the Peo∣ple, as an <HI>Acknowledgment</HI> to himself; and it is for the Peoples good, with respect to the great Reward which follows, as may be plentifully shewed from Scripture.</P>
<P>Again, the Preaching of the Gospel, as it is too sacred a Work to be undertaken for the honour of this world, so it is too sacred to be varnished with excellent words of mans Wisdom, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. As God has ap∣pointed proper Means, so natural parts, and acquired parts by Learning have their proper tendency to help men in Invention, Reason and Utterance; but he that strives to shew it when he is acting in that which concerns mens eternal Estate, seems to have forgot the worth of mens Souls, or the dread of the Danger would drive such small things out of his mind: Surely he that does so, is
<PB N="29" REF="001573_0017_0FB3DB6519412238"/>
not sensible of the greatness of his Work, and is so far unfit for it, and seems to have forgot that he is to preach Christ, and not himself, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4, 5, it is a grievous prophain∣ing of Gods Ordinance. Parts and Learn∣ing are of great use, but we must not be fed with the Dish in which our Food is brought to us. Religion is of too excellent a nature in it self, to be made more beauti∣ful by Mans Wisdom. A Tow Lace will not become a Silk Garment; it may be of use to spin and weave the Silk, but spoils it if it be mixed with it. It shows an Ig∣norance of the excellency of Religion, when Men think to beautifie it so. And the ears of the hearers being tickled with fine words, has a tendency to divert their Mind from the sense of the weight of the Truth which they hear. Let plain intelligible significant words be used in Religion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fifthly,</HEAD>
<P>Is Mens Salvation or Damnation concern∣ed in the Preaching of the Gospel? Then we have need, for our Souls sake, to avoid all such things as hinder the Success of it; for if it prove unsuccessful, it may cost you
<PB N="30" REF="001573_0018_0FB3DB669A85FE48"/>
your Soul! Therefore let all <HI>Worldly Re∣creations, visits and discourses</HI> be avoided when we go to, but especially when we go from hearing the Word Preached, while it is fresh upon our mind, which is the only time to make a sensible application of it. We eat our food visibly, we digest it invisibly, if both be not done we cannot live; so we learn for our edification openly and publick∣ly; we really get the good of it privately and secretly. Our Food is digested by the working of nature, Our spiritual Food by the working of our Minds, which must take time, and our mind cannot do it while di∣verted by other things. The Beasts which did not chew the Cud after they had eaten it, were accounted unclean. And the Person that only hears, and makes no further appli∣cation, is Unclean in the sight of God. Our Food begins to digest so soon as it is eaten, or not at all; and experience shews that many a Person coming from a Sermon much affected or awakened, but not improving it, presently has by the next day lost all the sense of it, or at least so much that he remains as he was before. Thus Men <HI>quench</HI> and <HI>grieve</HI> the Spirit, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.30. and so
<PB N="31" REF="001573_0018_0FB3DB669A85FE48"/>
many loose their Salvatian, not having the like return upon them again. Thus many do the work of the Devil to their near Friends by entertaining them with such discourses after a Sermon which quite puts out that spark of eternal life, that began to kindle in them, and so occasion their Damnation. It was not for nothing that God appointed the weekly day of his publick Worship to be kept <HI>Holy</HI> from all secular Imployments. Application must be made that very Day. If our Salvati∣on be instrumentally procured by the preach∣ing of the Word, and if Damnation comes by the unsuccessfulness of it, then that which makes it unsuccessful, is in that respect the worst of Evils. Other Sins are Pardoned when the Sinner Repents and is Converted, but <HI>This</HI> hinders Repentance and Conversion. <HI>The end</HI> of Religion is <HI>lost</HI> where the Word is unsuccessful. No wonder then if the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> fall upon that Land where such things are a custom, as hinder the success of it. But that the falling upon unnecessary worldly Discourse soon after Sermon, or in∣deed any time the same day, has this woful effect; is dreadfully proved from matter of Fact. But because it is that which works
<PB N="32" REF="001573_0019_0FB3DB6819581538"/>
invisibly upon mens Minds, therefore few see it, and the blindness of mind and hard∣ness of heart, that it works in those upon whom it takes effect, hinders their observa∣tion of it. Though Prophaneness of life and want of Grace, where the word is taught, is an open proof, but like a distemper or sick∣ness, procured by some Intemperance. The sickness is seen by all, but few (yea, the Pa∣tient himself does not) know the cause. There is great complaint of Prophaneness (and cause enough) as that which brings Gods Wrath upon the Land; but if the Word taught were <HI>effectual,</HI> that would be healed; Therefore while such Customs are upheld, as make that Word ineffectual, that procures Gods Anger, as the foundation cause. The Streams of Iniquity it is that overflows the Land; but the way to stop them, is to begin at the Fountain. The Streams of Reforma∣tion it is, that must heal the Land; but the way to procure them, is to remove that which stops them in the Fountain. All the Counsels of Hell could not have found out a more <HI>effectual</HI> way to destroy Religion, than the custom that is in some places, of visiting on the Lords Day evening, and in some places
<PB N="33" REF="001573_0019_0FB3DB6819581538"/>
on the Lords Day it self, after Sermon; not but that Religious visits are lawful upon the Sabbath Day it self; but after hearing <HI>openly,</HI> our work is application <HI>secretly.</HI> Indeed if some discourse be used after a Sermon, con∣cerning its usefulness, and the need to apply and practise it, it may double its effect upon many hearers; but still, Application is <HI>secret.</HI> And what excuse is this for a discourse which <HI>hinders</HI> success? And if we find that we cannot discourse with a Friend without so bad an effect, we are obliged not to trust our selves by the rule which bids us <HI>pray that we be not led into Temptation.</HI></P>
<P>But why may not People tarry at home as much as on other times in the week? and each man keep his own house from being a <HI>Play-House?</HI> and keep his Family at home to minde good, and teach them? When is there a better time? But he that cares for no Food for himself, desires none for his Family; He that is <HI>Dead,</HI> desires no <HI>Life.</HI> But do you not know, that you are commanded to teach your Family. <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.6, 7. <HI>Diligently to teach them sitting in your House, lying down, rising up,</HI> &amp;c. And as God has set you the Watchman of your house, so if any one perish
<PB N="34" REF="001573_0020_0FB3DB69960ECA20"/>
through your neglect, their blood will be required at your hands. He that answers for <HI>anothers</HI> life, pays for it with his own. How Terrible is it then to have anothers Damnation to pay for! You work and la∣bour <HI>all day and daily</HI> for their Bodies; and can you not spend some pains <HI>weekly</HI> for their Souls! which is a work much more difficult, and a Thousand Million times more needful; and therefore we are required to make it our constant care, <HI>Sitting in our house, walking by the way,</HI> &amp;c. And not only Catechising, and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> but also Spiritual <HI>Improve∣ment</HI> and Application of Knowledge is your work to teach them; For otherwise <HI>all Know∣ledge</HI> of <HI>all Mysteries</HI> is nothing, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.2.</P>
<P>And how can you better do this, than by making them sensible of the Doctrine preach∣ed, which is Gods appointed Ordinance for conversion; and when can you better do it, than on the <HI>Evening</HI> after it was Preached? It may be you pray, and repeat the Sermon with them; you do so far well; but do you know, that they go alone, when you have done, to meditate and pray to God, <HI>to apply it by his Spirit, and give them Grace to keep it, and to keep them from walking contrary to</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="001573_0020_0FB3DB69960ECA20"/>
this and that particular <HI>Truth which they now learned;</HI> which if they do not, what are they the better for all? What Life is in them? But he that does not thus himself, has no heart to recommend it to others. If by this practice you win a Child to Repentance, you have got him a better Portion, than if you had made him a King. But what of this is done, when all go into Frolicks! Is there no time in the week for young People to see each other with <HI>Civility</HI> but this? Is not such a Custom devised by the Devil, on purpose for his <HI>Defence</HI> against the Sword of the Spirit, (the Word of God) which should overthrow his Kingdom? But some are displeased with this Doctrine, and others do not much re∣gard it. I fear the reason is, because the Devil knows that the Custom it contends with, is his strong hold. However, this mat∣ter concerns Peoples Salvation and Damna∣tion, mind it or not.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Sixthly.</HEAD>
<P>By this Doctrine we may be put in mind <HI>That the work of the Gospel ought to be attend∣ed with Diligence,</HI> both on the part of the Teacher, and also on the part of the Hearers. For mens Salvation is concerned in it, as the Preacher should make it his bu∣siness
<PB N="36" REF="001573_0021_0FB3DB6B1E592658"/>
to study suitable matter, to discourse with the afflicted, and instruct the ignorant, to reprove and deal with Offenders, and con∣vince those that err, &amp;c. <HI>Publickly and from House to House,</HI> Acts 20.20. So far as his abi∣lity and strength and health will allow, so should the hearers as <HI>dilingently</HI> hear, <HI>care∣fully</HI> observe, <HI>faithfully</HI> apply, <HI>and truly</HI> practise, which is a work not easily done. Our Nature is so <HI>averse,</HI> our spiritual Ene∣mies so subtle and diligent, that <HI>few</HI> do escape Damnation, and obtain Salvation, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.13, 14. Now a work so <HI>difficult,</HI> and of so great Concernment, does <HI>surely</HI> require di∣ligence; and he that does not find it so, is surely a stranger to it; and therefore we know where he is going! Therefore <HI>give di∣ligence to make your Calling and Election sure,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. And take heed least <HI>the cares of this World, or the deceitfulness of Riches, or the Lusts of other things</HI> (whether ease, quietness, pleasure, or what) <HI>entering in, choak the Word, and it become unfruitful,</HI> and you loose your Salvation, <HI>Mark</HI> 4.10.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Seventhly.</HEAD>
<P>By his Doctrine, we may consider our <HI>Obligations</HI> to <HI>Love</HI> those that are by God
<PB N="37" REF="001573_0021_0FB3DB6B1E592658"/>
made Instruments of our furtherance toward receiving the benefit of the Gospel Preached (whether it be faithful Ministers or Christian Friends) seeing that's Gods appointed means for us to escape from Damnation, and ob∣tain Salvation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Eightly.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Is the success of the Gospel Preached that whereon our Salvation depends?</HI> Then it is a dreadful thing for any person to be the hin∣derance of the Success of it: He is a Mur∣derer of Souls, a Fighter against God, and a helper of the Devil; and this many do, and never consider it. Some by Mirth or world∣ly Business, at the time when the Word is to be meditated upon, and some by their Ex∣amples divert others, when they were in a fair way to have been blessed by applying the Truth. When your heart is awakened by the Word, this is Gods hand, as if he called you by Name to be saved! It is that which you cannot have when you will! If you improve it <HI>now,</HI> and follow on, you shall be Saved; but if you put it off, you know not whether ever you shall have it again. You may think you will mind it another time, but when that time is come, your heart is
<PB N="38" REF="001573_0022_0FB3DB6CA1F9F3C8"/>
gone, the sense of it is gone! and hence if you do something, you do it without that presence of God, which you might have had. From hence it is that many rest with false hopes, by patching up an insufficient Repentance, for want of Gods Spirit (to guide them) which they did not improve while they had it. Their case is like <HI>Sampson, Jud.</HI> 16.20. He said, <HI>I will go out, as before, and shake my self; and he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.</HI> Wo to him that puts a Person out, when his heart is touched? and Wo to him that is so put out of his way. Again, some hinder the success of the Gospel by opposing the Minister, vilifying or under∣valuing his Doctrine, or his Person; this does more Mischief than the doer is aware of, and destroys many Souls. When a Scale is near turning, a small matter turns it quite either one way or the other, if the weigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be never so great; so it is with a Man almost perswaded to Duty, to Conviction, to Re¦pentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore we have need to tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> need; thus many become Murderers of Soul (especially of their nearest Friends) A man venting his Anger by speaking reproachfull of a <HI>Neighbour,</HI> may keep him out of Heaven
<PB N="39" REF="001573_0022_0FB3DB6CA1F9F3C8"/>
<HI>Psal.</HI> 15.3. But how much worse is it, when, to ease his angry mind, he lays snares for the Souls of his Bretheren and Friends, mak∣ing the Gospel ineffectual to them? Suppose your case be just, you know not what mis∣chief you may do. Surely the Devil will stir men up, in such a case, with all his might; and then one of his great Strategems is, to tempt the Minister to some Imprudences, and some angry persons to take offence; and our Armour to fight against it, is Prayer and Watchfulness.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Ninthly.</HEAD>
<P>Is it so, that <HI>our Salvation or Damnation is concerned in the Preaching and Ordinances of the Gospel (even so that our Salvation is occasioned by the same well improved, and hin∣dered by the want of it)</HI> Then the enjoyment thereof is a very needful thing; It is the very thing which our Saviour calls (with the good Improvement of it) <HI>The one thing need∣ful, Luke</HI> 10. Therefore he that enjoys it, enjoys that which is better than a Kingdom without it; and he that brings up his Chil∣dren under the Gospel, and learns them to prise it, gives them better than a Kingdom; but he that removes them from under it, for the sake of worldly gain, does the work of a foolish Friend, and does, in effect, sell them
<PB N="40" REF="001573_0023_0FB3DB6E168624D0"/>
to Hell, and to the Devil, for nothing. He undoes them, because he loves them; And <HI>what will it profit a Man if he gain the whole World, and loose his own Soul? Mat.</HI> 16.26.</P>
<P>Were it not for the sense of this Truth, for my part, I would never take such a poor troublesom way of living, as the Ministry usually proves to be, through the opposition of the Enemy, and Mens want of Grace.</P>
<P>Here I must a little expostulate with such as think it no great matter whether they live under the Preaching of the Gosple or no; and a less matter whether they constantly attend or no. Have you a desire to be saved or no? If you have, do you think to find it out of Gods way?

<P><HI>Obj. But are not the Scriptures above any mans Preaching?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Yea, they are; But God has required of us more Duties than one, which are necessary to Salvation. The Husbandman knows, that in order to a Crop, there must be the Land, the Fence, the Tillage, the Seed, the Rain, the Sun and the Reaping; and if one of these fail, the Crop is lost. So here, there is the Scripture, the publick Preaching, the private Meditations, the Practice and Prayers; If one of these fail, the Soul is lost. There are also other things helpful, as Discourse of Friends, Afflictions sanctified, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And sometimes for want of one of these, the Soul may be lost.</P>

<P><HI>Is our Salvation so nearly concerned in the Preaching of the Gospel?</HI> Then it is no strange thing if the Devil and his Instruments are Enemies to it. Hence persecutiors are commonly against either the Scriptures being read, or against the Gospel being faithfully preached; and hence the sub∣tilty of Satan prevailing upon mens Corruptions, causes so many Contentions in Churches and So∣cieties, to the hindrance of the effectual Prea∣ching of the Gospel; and hence Satan raises so many false Opinions in Religion, under fair Co∣lours, thereby to prevent the true being received, and hence many men will expend much freely for superfluity in Apparel, and the like, and yet will not help their Minister with so much as

<P><HI>Is Mens Salvation or Damnation concerned in the Preaching &amp; other Ordinances of the Gospel?</HI> Then let every Christian see the need of earnest Prayer, whenever we act any thing that concerns it, when you go to hear, when you come from hearing, and when you speak of it; For your eternal Estate is concern∣ed in the Ministers Studies, Actions and Words, and in your own also; Therefore Pray. Therefore our Saviour going to chuse his Apostles, continued <HI>all night in Prayer. Luke</HI> 6.12. He thought the Success of the Gospel worth Dying for; and will not you think it worth Praying for, or any other pains when it concerns your Salvation or Damnation? And the Blessing is promised only upon Condition of fervent Prayer.</P>
