<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> ADDRESS you with a mixture of pleasure and embarrassment. It is impossible not to participate the general satisfaction which this anniversary affords; though a want of sufficient leisure and opportunity has, I fear, prevented my coming forward prepared to satisfy the expecta∣tions of this respectable auditory, or justify the partiality of those who placed me here. But the fields of Science have lately been so thoroughly explored, and the choicest productions so care∣fully collected, that to expect a new and rich re∣past at this time, would be like looking for the bounties of Nature in fields where the harvest had been gathered.</P>
<P>It is a custom with the Society which is here assembled, on the occasion of this anniversary, to delegate one or more of its members to deliver a public harangue. In discharging this duty, the performer has the choice of his theme. It must
<PB N="6" REF="031824_0004_0FEEBF3DF30CE0D0"/>be proper on such an occasion, when friends and strangers out of the Society oblige us with their attendance, to unfold and discuss the motives which led to this establishment; the principles which have governed the members of it, in pros∣ecuting the design; and the consequences that may probably result therefrom. As this has never yet been done, so far as my knowledge extends, with your permission I will attempt it.</P>
<P>The form of this Institution originated in a Sister Seminary to the South, and from thence was <HI>mediately</HI> communicated to this. It was not adopted here with an idea of attaching to its mem∣bers superior privileges, or arrogating to them an invidious distinction. No expectations were formed that the connexion would afford a dis∣pensation from any of the duties of scholastic life, or independently insure success in the world. But it was well understood that respectability here, and eminence and good fortune through life, were exclusively attached to ability, informa∣tion and merit. To improve and increase these important qualities, give complete effect to the endeavors of our instructors, more fully accom∣plish the purposes for which we were placed here by our friends, as well as to cultivate harmony and establish a durable friendship, the plan of the Institution was approved and carried into effect. Experience has confirmed theory; and the util∣ity of the scheme has equalled the expectations of its advocates.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031824_0005_0FEEBF40D2A3F130"/>
In its prosecution, objects of pursuit and the modes of investigation have been pointed out. These have been such as were either useful in themselves, or as they tended to invigorate and extend the reasoning faculty. A literary account∣ability to the whole is naturally expected of each of the members; and hence results, not only in∣dustry, but a circumspection of mind, an endeavor at classic purity and correctness, which might otherwise have been neglected. Free communi∣cation on all proper subjects is encouraged; and accurate discussions of particular points enjoined. By this expedient, the stock of information is im∣proved, the ideas are afforted and arranged, and pedantry and hesitation give place to ease and ready resource. The student who confines him∣self to his closet, and collects his information wholly from the dead letter of his authors, with∣out improving the faculty of communication or an interchange of sentiments and observations, may acquire much learning; but the mass will be of little more use to him than a treasure deposit∣ed under the base of a pyramid.</P>
<P>As the Society was not exclusively connected with one seminary, it was necessary, to prevent mistakes and impositions, as well as for other pur∣poses, to preserve those mysteries and <HI>arcana,</HI> which had been attached to it from its origin. Independent of the many precedents which exist in point, to which we might appeal for an apol∣ogy, we trust that this consideration will afford to
<PB N="8" REF="031824_0006_0FEEBF43AC5EBFD8"/>the candid a sufficient justification. But a tree, it is said, is to be known by its fruit; and, as we have <HI>endeavored</HI> to approve ourselves to the world, we feel a modest assurance that our Institu∣tion will not suffer by an application of the rule. Fifteen years have already elapsed since its first establishment here: During all which time, irreg∣ularities of conduct, riot, tumult and disorder have uniformly been discountenanced; and due subordination and a regard to order have been en∣joined and practised. Many advantages therefore have resulted to the University, and perhaps to society itself. From a conviction of the utility of the scheme, on all these and various other ac∣counts, the Government of this Seminary have, with great propriety, afforded their patronage and countenance to the Institution.</P>
<P>Some of the general consequences that may probably flow from this establishment are obvious and apparent. The interests of the community are undoubtedly advanced by the information and ability of its members. Nay, a general diffusion of knowledge and literature is thought essentially necessary to the preservation of a free government. This benefit, however, does not fully result to so∣ciety, unless the powers of the head are connected with goodness of heart. In what consists the dif∣ference between a civilized man and a savage? Certainly not more in the improvement of mind, than disposition. Let one, therefore, be enlarged, without a proportional correction of the other,
<PB N="9" REF="031824_0007_0FEEBF4C1AD93310"/>and the man will be but a savage still, with greater ability to gratify his uncorrected propensities. Those societies, therefore, must be importantly useful, which make a reciprocal friendship a part of their constitutions. For, it is from the culti∣vation of private attachments, that we learn to extend our affections to a general philanthropy. It is not to be denied, that some of the benefits which they would produce are happily superseded by the tranquil state of our country, and the mild manners of a polished and enlightened age. Such institutions, especially if they become extensive, are admirably calculated to soften the manners, and ameliorate the condition of mankind, in bar∣barous or tumultuous times.</P>
<P>The Masonic Establishment, which is of this description, from its antiquity and universality, furnishes the best illustration of this doctrine. Avoiding all the chimerical, or at best, doubtful accounts of a very high antiquity; it is certain that their order existed, and was held in respect, during the latter part of the dark ages. In addi∣tion to the refinement of disposition, which the cherishing the mild virtue of friendship always induces; history affords us many instances of the beneficial effects which that establishment produ∣ced. The exile, whom differences in religious opinions, revolutions in government, or the chances of war had driven from his country to a foreign land; instead of there finding himself friendless and alone, instead of being exposed to
<PB N="10" REF="031824_0008_0FEEBF4EE7790E88"/>the insuits and abuse of the unfeeling, or redu∣ced to the sad alternative of menial service, or soliciting a cold charity to obtain a pitiful subsist∣ence; no sooner did he make known his con∣nexion to any of the fraternity whom he might chance to meet, than he found the bosom of friendship open to receive, the arm of power stretched forth to protect, and the hand of a lib∣eral charity unfolded to support him. The un∣happy captive who had fallen into the hands of a ferocious and exasperated enemy, instead of meet∣ing that cruel death, or being condemned to the still more cruel bondage which he expected, is discovered by a brother of the order among the conquerors: Forthwith the fetters are struck from his limbs, the balm of consolation is copiously ad∣ministered, and he is relieved from his fearful ap∣prehensions. This generous relief was not con∣fined to Masonic Brethren, but often extended to their friends and fellow-sufferers. How grateful is it to observe such instances of humanity and benevolence, breaking forth in times of general barbarism and depravity of manners! The gem of friendship shines with a brighter, a diviner ray, in proportion to the general gloom of the times in which it is found.</P>
<P>Unacquainted with the secrets of Masonry, I state no other instance of analogy between that order and ours, but that of a fraternal attachment to each other. But certain I am that a cultiva∣tion of the tender and social affections, and the
<PB N="11" REF="031824_0009_0FEEBF5070208E80"/>consequent extension of our benevolence to a gen∣eral philanthropy, is the most important, the most honorable principle that any fraternity can pro∣fess. If ever this was a secret, thank God, it is now rapidly developing, or is already unfolded to society at large.</P>
<P>Comparing the state of mankind with what it was scarce more than a century ago, how im∣mensely is it improved! In many countries, in∣stead of laws which authorised the governments to seize the property of an unfortunate stranger, who should die within their jurisdiction, how∣ever just the claims of his relations or others might be; or to strip from the wretches who were wrecked on their coasts, the remnant of their property which the rage of the elements had spared; instead of the barbarous custom of coolly murdering or condemning to slavery the unhappy captives, whom the fortune of war, or even a vi∣olation of the rights of hospitality had brought within their power; we find laws providing for the support of the distressed of every description; societies established and countenanced by govern∣ment for the relief of the unfortunate. In times of peace, most countries are open for the free ad∣mission and departure of strangers; and their equal right to protection and relief is acknowl∣edged: And in time of war, excepting some partial instances of cruelty, which have unfortu∣nately stained the history of our own times; if any one fall into the hands of his enemy, the dan∣ger
<PB N="12" REF="031824_0010_0FEEBF51F92FA600"/>of his life ceases with his resistance; he is treated with politeness, and allowed all the conve∣niencies and comforts of life. In a short time he is liberated on his simple parole, or exchanged unhurt; or, on the conclusion of a peace, is dismiss∣ed without a ransom. Wars in general are no longer personal, but national: And though indi∣viduale discharge their duty with gallantry in the field; yet they have none of that private animos∣ity and rancor which formerly armed that de∣structive evil with double terror.</P>
<P>In this picture, which is undoubtedly just with respect to much the greater part of what is term∣ed the civilized world, it must be highly satisfac∣tory to observe that our own country stands in the foreground. Mildness and benevolence are ruling principles in all our governments: Philan∣thropy is both honored and practised by the great body of our citizens. The poor are pro∣vided for by standing laws; and the unfortunate often relieved by particular acts of munificence. Individuals also have uniformly discovered alac∣rity and zeal to avert the dangers with which oth∣ers were threatened, and have liberally contributed to repair unmerited misfortunes. Societies have been formed for the kind reception and friendly treatment of such foreigners as seek an asylum in our happy country; others, to restore persons apparently dead to life and the embraces of their anxious friends. Many similar establishments do honor to our country. When engaged in war,
<PB N="13" REF="031824_0011_0FEE929B1380A148"/>no American was ever known to take the life of the unresisting or unarmed; and the kindness and humanity with which our magnanimous armies, though often exasperated by cruelties which had been practised on their countrymen, always treat∣ed their prisoners, extorted praises from their ene∣mies themselves. What other people can exhibit an example of a complete revolution achieved, both in the form and the administration of gov∣ernment, or of rebellions effectually suppressed, where no blood has been spilled on account of the opinion of individuals, or the side of the contro∣versy merely, which they espoused? Far hence be the time, when either foreign war or internal commotion shall again call for the exercise of these magnanimous virtues; but still let us cher∣ish, and be ready to put them in practice, if the sad necessity should ever re-exist.</P>
<P>Though humanity and benevolence be justly a part of our national character; yet, as other na∣tions are behind us, so we have not arrived at per∣fection. There still remains a wide field for the exercise of a generous ambition. To revise, and mitigate in many cases, our codes of criminal law, by endeavoring to make a reformation of the of∣fender, instead of his extirpation, the object of punishment; to transform our common places of confinement from seminaries of wickedness and villany into schools of morality; to liberate the unhappy Africans from the horrors of a sla∣very equally unjust and inhuman; to promote
<PB N="14" REF="031824_0012_0FEEBF5BB7D28AE8"/>an interchange of good offices, and a mild and pacific disposition among mankind; objects like these are worthy the pursuit of the noblest minds. Some of them have already immortalized the names of PENN, HOWARD, and WILBERFORCE. Shall we be deterred, shall we shrink in despair from objects of such magnitude? Is it chimerical to indulge a hope that even we may bear a con∣spicuous part in this noble pursuit? No; remem∣bering that, in such a cause, it is much more hon∣orable to lead than to follow; we will lend our individual assistance, as circumstances may permit, and endeavor to give a tone to the public opin∣ion. If one man, by his personal exertion, could alleviate the distresses of thousands, scattered through all the countries of Europe, nay, could gladden even the horrors of the East; what may not numbers achieve? It is true we are yet com∣paratively few: But our number, both here and elsewhere, is continually increasing. Our Insti∣tution is now confined to a few seminaries in this country: But what obstacle exists to its fur∣ther extension? or even to a communication of it to foreign universities? in many of which, establishments of this kind have heretofore found a cordial support. Let us remember also, that in the practice of philanthropy, which is far from being the least important object of our association, we shall act in concert with many other respecta∣ble institutions, and meet the concurrence of a generous public. With due exertion, therefore,
<PB N="15" REF="031824_0013_0FEEBF5D4E8744D0"/>even of a few, in various places and different walks of life, the great current of opinion may be directed into proper channels, and its raraifica∣tions reach every object of compassion. When the beneficial effects of a general spirit of human∣ity shall be observed here, it will readily be adopted abroad. Our country has already taught the world the true science of government, and the art to be free. She exhibits the example of a great people flourishing and happy, among whom, to the surprise of other nations, gradations in rank, and exclusive rights, are entirely unknown. Why then shall we not instruct the species in the arts of humanity, and the science of universal friendship? Is this general diffusion of philan∣thropy mere chimera and extravagance? If it be, I could almost wish that we might still cherish the delusion. For what but the reality could be more grateful to benevolent minds, than a con∣fident anticipation that the whole world would become a common country to each individual; that mankind would be but one family, by practice, as well as extraction; and thereby taste on Earth, the joys of Heaven itself?</P>
