Ebenezer Knap and his wife were members of the Baptist church in Warwick under the care of Elder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames Benedict. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e persons notwithstanding their local situation, and their distance fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> civilized people, were not unmindful of the duties of religion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t upon their arrival in this inhospitable wild they set up a religious meeting, which was held at the house of Ebenezer Knap, in which▪ they attended to singing, exhorting and praying. But without any visible effect on the minds of their children until the February follow∣ing, when on one Friday evening Elizabeth Lull, wife of Benjamin Lull, jun. arose from her bed in great distress of mind, and coming down stairs she repeated the following words:</P>
<Q><L>"Shall Simon bear thy cross alone,</L>
<L>"And other saints go free;</L>
<L>"Each saint of thine shall find his own,</L>
<L>"And there is one for me."</L></Q>
<P>"I have lived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>teen years; and never had a good thought, sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a good word▪ or did a good deed." This made an impression on the mind of her sister Martha, and likewise upon her husband. Thus the work of the Lord began. Ebenezer Knap was gone from home<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He went away from home in December, and returned in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd they had no earthly instructor than their mother. They contin∣ued in this exercise of mind until April, when Mrs. Lull and her sis∣ter Martha were brought into liberty. In the course of the ensuing summer seven more families moved into the settlement and united with them in their religious meetings. This summer was a com∣fortable time with them, in the former part of which Increase Thurs∣tin's wife was brought to rejoice in the Lord, together with C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leb Lull▪ son of Benjamin Lull, senior, and many others appeared under deep exercises of mind on account of their souls. It continued a com∣fortable season with them until the summer following.</P>
<P>In June 1775, one Jackson was killed by an Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the Butter∣nut
<PB N="4" REF="037650_0004_100F7B6966697B18"/>Creek about two miles from the settlement; it was supposed the Indian murd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed him for his money.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1776, the inhabitants began to be distressed by the war, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e more peace until they were deprived of most of their ef∣fects and forced to break up their settlement and retire to the interior of the country.</P>
<P>In the course of this year a party of men were sent by the au∣thority of the state, who obliged the inhabitants to take the oath of neutr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity and disarmed them.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1777, a party of the British came into the settlement, and obliged the inhabitants to swear not to take up arms against the King of Britain.</P>
<P>In 1778, in consequence of a suspicion that the inhabitants had vio∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d their oath, and supplied the enemy with provision. Two com∣panies were sent from the garrison at Cherry. Valley, who took the principal men prisoners, and drove away all the cattle they could find: The prisoners were carried to Cherry-Valley and examined, then sent to Albany and confined. In September the same year a party of the Oneida Indians came and took away all the men that were left except one who was absent; and carried them to Fort Stanwix, and delivered them as prisoners to the garrison under pretence that they took them on their way to Niagara. The women and children were now left alone surrounded by hostile savages and howling beast of prey.</P>
<P>In a few days after the Indians were gone, Elizabeth, the wife Benjamin Lull, senior being deprived of her family (which consisted of her husband and five sons, who were all taken prisoners) formed the resolution of leaving the place; accordingly she set out (accompanied with another woman, who carried with her two small children) through the wood for Cherry-Valley, where they arrived after two days tra∣vel, in which they endured great distress, on account of the ruggedness of the way, continual fears of the enemy, and the inclemency of the weather, for a great part of the time it rained exceeding hard, and at night they took up their lodging in an old hut and made their bed of some oat-straw. The distance they travelled was about thirty-two miles. Mrs. Lull was at this time about 57 years of age, and car∣ried a pack that was judged to weigh about thirty weight.</P>
<P>In a short time after this the prisoners were released, as there was nothing found against them. They immediately removed their fami∣lies back into the old settlements. Thus were these people driven from their habitations after passing through scenes of anxiety and dis∣tress, which must affect the feeling heart with exquisite sensations.</P>
<P>But through all their distress and danger, kind providence protected them, so that no lives were lost except Jackson's aforesaid. In 1783 Benjamin Lull with his wife and one son returned to the settlement and lived alone through the winter.</P>
<P>In 1784, four more families returned. In 1785 they again set up religious meetings. About the year 1787, they had preaching part of
<PB N="5" REF="037650_0005_100F7B6B66D0D808"/>the time and some were baptized by Elder Comstock who had collect∣ed a small church in Cooper's patent, but he dying soon 'after, his church became extinct.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1792, Elder Craw from Greenfield visited them, preach∣ed and baptized two persons; May 16, 1793 a number of Baptist professors met at the house of Mr. Joseph Lull, in Unadilla for con∣ferences after an agreeable interview in which they found a union of sentiment respecting doctrine and discipline, they adjourned their meeting.</P>
<P>June 1793, they again met and after further conversation they read and adopted a covenant, and agreed to call a council.</P>
<P>August 28th, 1793 a council consisting of the Elder and delegates from Greefield church met, and after inspecting their doings, gave them fellowship as a church in sister relation: Their number was five males, and five females. This church lies southwesterly from Spring∣field about thirty five miles.</P>
<P>Ebenezer Knap and his wife are yet members of the church and they have the pleasure of seeing their two daughters (their only sur∣viving children) one of their sons in law, and six of their grand chil∣dren) in the same church with them.</P>

<P>IN 1787 there was a collection of nine Babtist professors in the town of Springfield, but were not regularly organized as a church: they continued in this situation until 1789, when Elder Furman re∣moved to that place, whose labor in the Gospel (by the divine bless∣ing) proved successful. In February the same year the work of the Lord began, and on the 13th day of March following Elder Furman, with twenty more, united with them in Covenant, and now considered themselves a gospel church, and in the words of Elder Furman, "this was a beautiful sight, a glorious day in the wilderness." They were now thirty in number walking together in union and harmony: This was the first Baptist Church erected in this once howling desert. The work of God still continued and before the end of January following, thirty-six more were added to the church.</P>
<P>In 1793 God again visited them with a small revival, and seven were added to the church.</P>
<P>In 1796 the Lord was pleased to pour out his spirit among them again, and fourteen were added to the church. This church from the beginning has been in a flourishing condition, and favored with additions yearly. Elder Furman still continues his labours among them, and we have received information that God is again visiting them, and a work of reformation is going on in that place.</P>

Accordingly a number of the in∣habitants met at the time and place appointed; when after duly con∣sidering of the matter, those of the Baptist sentiment agreed to set up a meeting, which was cordially acceded to by the Methodists.—At the next conference which was held soon after a number of persons gave a relation of their experiences which was very satisfactory; and was a very comfortable time, for it appeared evident that the Lord was present by the gracious influence of his holy spirit, and pleasing symp∣toms of an approaching reformation were discoverable.</P>

From this time there was an increasing atten∣tion among the people. At almost every meeting some gave a relation of their experience, until the 29th of June, when Elder Caleb Nichols from the Shaftsbury association visited them, preached, baptized 28 persons, and brake bread to 116, a number of whom were members of the churches in this vicinity.

At a certain time a number of rude per∣sons made an agreement to break up their meeting; but before the time came they were convinced of the impropriety of such conduct, and desisted from their purpose. About this time they were involved in some trials by reason of false brethren, who came in among them.

<P>IN the year 1789 Elder William Furman removed with his fam∣ily into the town of Springfield, in the county of Otsego, state of New-York. This town lies at the north end of Otsego lake, and a∣bout 15 miles south of Mohawk river; and about 60 miles west of Albany. At this time there was no B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptist church in all this extensive country. Eld'r Furman was at this time about forty years of age, he is of a middling statute, robust constitution, fitted to endure hardships, naturally of a mild and gentle disposition, affable in conversation, meek and winning in his preaching; sound in doctrine, in exhortation ex∣cels, his gifts seem to be mostly of the exhortative kind; yet, he is capable of handling a text doctrinally to the satisfaction of the lovers
<PB N="10" REF="037650_0010_100F7B7829254B70"/>of truth. He is of deep penetration and sound judgment, which ren∣ders him eminently useful in councils. He was the first minister who was settled in this wilderness, who was particularly useful in planting churches and promoting the rise of this Association. Having the glory of God in view, and desirous of the increase of the Redeemer's kingdom, he spared no pains, but exerted himself to the utmost for the accomplishment of those glorious purposes. He may with pro∣priety be said to be the father of these churches, God has remarkably blessed his labors with abundant success. He now rejoices to see the happy effects of his unwearied pains in the service of his Lord.</P>

<P>Sermon by Eld'r Cornell from Timothy 11.3. After a short in∣termission proceeded to business. A Platform and plan of union for these churches was read and unanimously agreed upon.</P>
<P>The delicate circumstances in which the infant churches, in this ex∣tensive territory were placed, rendered them liable to impositions from artful and designing men; and several such of dangerous principles and corrupt practices having already obtruded themselves upon these new settlements, it became indispensibly necessary that some method should be devised to prevent such impositions in future, and to keep out of our connexion all persons sustaining such characters. There∣fore the conference appointed Eld. Cornell to examine each church respecting their faith and practice, and each minister concerning his character. After which the aforementioned churches and minister being found in a circumstance to unite, they UNANIMOUSLY vo∣ted to consider themselves at this and future meetings as an Associa∣tion, by the name of the Otsego Association. The Elders and breth∣ren present gave them fellowship as an Association.</P>

<P>Voted to meet annually on the first Wednesday in September at 10 o'Clock A. M.</P>
<P>This being the first interview of this nature ever enjoyed in this western country, it was apparently crowned with a divine blessing — The presence of Jehovah was really felt, and the souls of God's peo∣ple expanded with joy, Some who came to the meeting with a reso∣lution to oppose the forming of an Association, were constrained to ac∣knowledge that God was with them; and their souls rejoiced in the union of these infant churches. Indeed it was a pleasing and interest∣ing scene, to behold the little churches scattered thoughout this exten∣sive land, coming up out of the wilderness and uniting together in an Associate capacity, thereby exhibiting what the Lord had done and was still doing in this once howling desert.</P>

<P>IN the month of August, 1792, a reformation began in this town which continued until January 1793, when on the 15th of said month they received fellowship as a church in gospel order. Their number was about 30. They increased greatly in numbers for about one year after they received fellowship: Several more were converted in a judgment of charity, who joined the Presbyterian church. This church lies south westerly from Springfield, distant about fifty mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P>SOME time in the latter end of the summer of 1795, Eld'r Da∣vid Irish came into this place, and preached to the people, the Lord added his blessing; so that on the 18th of November the same year, ten persons entered, into church relation. About this time the Lord began to pour out his spirit in convicting and converting sinners in a most glorious manner, the stout hearted were broken down, while young converts were shouting hosannas to the son of David, the hearts of God's people were made to rejoice, and join the blessed theme; their little cottages became praying houses, and the wilder∣ness that not long since was a waste howling desert, where savages and

<HEAD>FIRST LITCHFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>In September 1794, a number of Baptist professors met in confer∣ence to consult on matters relating to Christ's militant kingdom; and feeling it a matter of importance they agreed to continue their con∣ferences. On the 15th of March 1795 they embodied as a church, the church at Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field and Palatine gave them fellowship. Their number was seven. Soon after the Lord poured out his spirit in a remarkable manner, sinners were awakened and many we trust were brought to the knowledge of the truth, so that twenty were added to the church, besides several who united with the Congregational society in this place. In 1799 this church was again visited by the spirit of God in a special manner, and twelve were added to the church in the space of four months. This church lies west from Springfield, distant about 30 miles.</P>

About sixteen months ago a few Baptist professors from different churches, residing in this town met in conference to form an acquaintance and obtain fellowship with each other. We continued our conferences until the October following when we sent for a council, and obtained the help of two Elders and some Brethren who gave them fellowship as a church in gospel order.

<P>Accordingly a council, consisting of the churches in Fairfield Palatine, 2d in Bur∣lington, and the first in Litchfield, convened March 10th, 1797 at the house of B'r Cole, in Litchfield: when after inspecting their articles and covenant they unanimously gave them fellowship as a church in sister relation; their number was fifteen.

<P>IN May, 1792, Warner Lake and his wife, who were members of Elder Gray's church, of Great Barrington, moved thair family to Kortright patent They soon set up a religious meeting.</P>
<P>IN the spring of the vear 1793, there appeared a considerable attention a∣mong the few scattered inhabitants. In July, Elder Gray by their request visit∣ed them, and baptized seven. Three more members from Elder Gray's church had lately come into the place. At this time they entered into covenant and on the 9th of July, 1793 Elder Gray gave them fellowship as a church: their number was thirteen. About this time B'r Lake began to speak to them in a doctrinal way. In the summer of 1794 the church called B'r Lake to ordina∣tion. October 30, 1794, the church in Great-Barrington and the church in Coeymans met in council, for the purpose of ordaining B'r Lake. After having enquired into matters which were necessary they proceeded on the following<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day to set him apart by the imposition of hands, which was done in the follow∣ing manner: Eld. Gray performed the first prayer, and preached from I. Cor. iv. 1.2. Eld. Mudge prayed the ordination prayer and gave the charge.— Eld. Gray gave the right hand of fellowship. The summer past there was something of a revival, and ten or twelve were baptized. Soon after the or∣dination a reformation began, which spread into Harpersfield, and about twenty were added to the church.</P>

<P>In June, 1795, Elder Ashbel Hosmer moved into Burlington and began to improve with the second church in that town. In October following he joined with the church as a member in full communion. but never was considered as the pastor of said church. He preached part of the time with a congregational society in the north part of the town, which society was the first in that part of the town that set up and maintained religious meetings. About the beginning of Februa∣ry 1797 he requested and received a letter of dismission from the church. The said society finding that he was dismissed from the church requested him to tarry and preach with them, and a number of baptist professors having moved into the vicinity, and attended upon that meeting, he agreed to their request.</P>
<P>Feb. 9th. 1797, Eld. Hosmer, with the above mentioned baptists met in conference, and the following question was proposed: "Is it expedient for us to attempt to unite in covenant as a gospel church!" Answered in the affirmative. Six persons who had been baptized and one who had not related their experience, then conferred on the gene∣ral principles of the baptists, and found a happy agreement.</P>
<P>May 15th, 1797, they again met and agreed to articles of faith and a covenant, and voted to consider themselves in future as a church of Christ. They likewise agreed to call a council to look into their or∣der. They also voted to give Elder Hosmer a call to the pastoral charge of the church, to which he assented.</P>

<HEAD>A sketch of the history of those six churches:</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="church">
<HEAD>BROTHERTOWN.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1776, David Fowler and five others moved to the westward of Albany, having previously obtained accession of lands from the Oneida Indians: upon which they so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> formed a settle∣ment, and set up a religious meeting, which was carried on by sing∣ing, praying, and exhortation. In the time of the revolutionary war, they were greatly distressed by the enemy, being deprived of their cattle and most of their other effects; so that they were forced to break up their settlement and retire to the older towns. At the con∣clusion of the war they returned to their former habitations; soon after a dispute arose between them and the Oneidas concerning their lands; which was productive of much trouble: many other difficul∣ties they met with from the English on account of their land, which were discouraging; but the providence of God protected them.</P>
<P>Through all their trials they kept up their religious meetings; and on the 24th of May, 1798 four persons were baptized by Eld. Par∣sons, and they agreed to send for a council. August 23d 1798, a council consisting of the churches in Fairfield-Palatine, Paris, Whites∣town, Scuyler &amp; Whitestown, and Hamilton, convened, who after in∣quiring into their circumstances, gave them fellowship as a church of Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their number was twelve. This church lies west from Spring∣field, distant about forty miles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="church">
<HEAD>SANGERFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1797, a number of persons in the town of Sangerfield, set up a religious meeting on the Lord's day. At this time there were some who appeared under awakenings; they continued their meetings through the winter; in the course of which there arose such opposition against the baptists having any share in the lead of the meeting, that on the 14th of April, 1798, eight persons met in con∣ference at the house of B'r White, and agreed to hold up a meeting in the baptist order; the May following four persons were baptized: at this time there appeared an engagedness in the minds of many, and the congregation increased, and some more were baptized in the sum∣mer and autumn. Nov. 27th, 1798, they agreed to call a council to give them fellowship; and likewise agreed to give Eld. Butler a call to settle with them. Dec. 19th, 1798 the churches in Fairfield Pal∣atine, Whitestown, Paris, Hamilton and Augusta, convened in coun∣cil, and gave them fellowship as a church in sister relation; their num∣ber was seventeen. This church lies westerly from Springfield about 35 miles. A small settlement in this vicinity, of about a dozen fam∣ilies,
<PB N="24" REF="037650_0024_100F7BA48B688840"/>who were educated in the paedo baptist sentiments, were visited by the Lord, which induced them to turn their attention to things of a divine nature: the consequence was that several of them were con∣verted to God, and all of them (except one or two) to the Baptist sen∣timent; seven of whom have joined with this church.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="church">
<HEAD>SCHUYLER SHORT LOTS.</HEAD>
<P>A NUMBER of baptist professors living on Schuyler Short Lots, did on the 25th of Feb. 1797, embody into a church, agreeable to the advice and in fellowship of a council; their number was seventeen.</P>
<P>In 1799, the spirit of the Lord moved upon the minds of several, and numbers come up to the help of the Lord against the mighty. In about five months their number increased to fifty one. This church lies northwesterly from Springfield distant about 25 miles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="church">
<HEAD>THIRD NORWICH.</HEAD>
<P>Feb. 9th, 1799, the first church in Norwich voted to call a council to advise with them on dividing the church: accordingly on the 23d of March, 1799, the north church in Burlington, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the church in Oxford, met in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uncil, and after enquiring into their circumstances gave them fellowship in their division; accordingly thirteen members were set off and embodied into a new church, and received the fellow∣ship of the council as the 3d baptist church in Norwich. This church lies southwestward from Springfield distant about 46 miles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="church">
<HEAD>WORCESTER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the latter end of the year 1798, Elders Hosmer and Lawton visited a number of Baptist professors living on the Susquehannah river, in the towns of Suffrage and Worcester: they were advised to get into a circumstance of embodying into a church. Eld. Hosmer baptized one person, and there appeared a pleasing attention among the people. They continued their meetings and Eld. Lawton fre∣quently visited them, and baptized three persons. After struggling through many difficulties, they did on the twenty-first day of August 1799 receive the fellowship of a council consisting of the North and Third Churches in Burlington, the churches in Butternuts and Kort∣right. Their number was eight: since which time eight have been added. This church lies southerly from Springfield, distant about 26 miles.</P>

<P>IN the summer of 1796 God was pleased to pour out his spirit on a small settlement in the town of Litchfield. A few of the inhabitants were professors of the congregational order: some were methodists. Elders Butler, Hosmer and Roots occasionally visited them, preached and baptized a number of per∣sons, the work continued through the summer and winter ensuing, during which time those congregational brethren embraced the baptist sentiments, and uniting with those newly converted, formed the 2d Baptist Church in Litchfield; several of the converts joined the methodist society: since which time they have had several refreshing visits from on high, which caused them to rejoice in the Lord, and some addittions were made to their number.</P>

<P>IN the month of May 1797, the Lord began to pour out his spirit in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, and a considerable revival took place: The arm of the Lord was re∣vealed, backsliders reclaimed, sinners awaked, and the children of God rejoiced: It continued through the summer in which time twenty-six were added to the church; from which time the church gradually increased in number until the latter end of June 1799, when a most remarkable thunder storm took place in this part of the country, which, through the goodness of God, was made a mean of awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ening some to a serious concern for their souls: since which time ten have been added to the church.

<HEAD>BUTTERNUTS.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 17th of January 1798, B'r John Lawton moved into the town of Butternuts, in consequence of a request of the baptist church there: the church at that time was few in number: a good degree of harmony prevailing a∣mong them at this time: but not so great an engagedness in religion as could be wished; and a great neglect of the duties of religion was prevalent among them; but still there were some desires for more engagedness in the cause of truth. Early in the spring there was some seriousness apparent on the minds some of the youth, but it was soon gone: However the truth made some im∣pressions, the minds of professors seemed to be more and more impressed with the necessity of attending to religious duties: and desires were encreased for the out-pouring of the holy spirit. Thus it continued until Lords day August 26th 1798, when one was excluded the church privileges, for immoral conduct. This was a solemn scene, it being the first case of that nature in the church. The members were deeply affected, and the audience in general appeared sol∣emn and attentive: about this time information was received of the reforma∣tion on the Otego creek. Lords day, September 26th 1798, was a solemn day; in the meeting, the power of the Lord seemed to be present; and a num∣ber of youth and other persons seemed to be greatly alarmed, while the people of God much encouraged. About this time a young woman gave a relation of
<PB N="32" REF="037650_0032_100F7BBEB6D32BE8"/>the work of God on her soul, and was received for Baptism. Several persons were now under deep exercises of mind. October 10th, Elder Hosmer preached a sermon from I. Peter 111, 12. and baptized four persons. This was a solemn time, the arm of the Lord was revealed, and the glory of God displayed: the tongues of God's children were loosed, and their souls were filled with joy and gladness: while sinners were expressing their concern with many tears and signs, fobs and groans were heard on every side: but notwith∣standing the powerful operators many were passing under, yet there was no appearance of any wild enthusiastic zeal: But a national concern agitated the minds of sinners, while the children of God seemed to rejoice from having r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght apprehensions of the truth; order and regu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arity appeared through all the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eting.</P>
<P>On the 25th of October, B'r Lawton was ordained, and the Lord's day fol∣lowing baptized eleven persons. The work continued through the winter, during which, and in the spring and summer following▪ sixty persons were ad∣ded to the church by bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sm: one of them a wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in her eighty fourth year, and had been a professor sixty years several of them vou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.

The work was regular as well as powerful. It was almost entirely free of any enthusiastic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint, a deep solemnity appeared on the minds of the subjects of the work, their understand∣ings were enlightened, their judgments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>formed and their affections regulated.</P>

<P>In the latter end of the year 1798 a B'r Price visited the church in Hamil∣ton. His preaching was blessed of God and a glorious work took place in dif∣ferent parts of the town. A young man in the vicinity who was a princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pal leader in their merry meetings was struck under great concern of mind, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch induced him to converse freely on religious subjects. His conversation togeth∣er with the former preaching (B'r Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce being now absent) had such an effect that a number of youth under deep impressions left their school and went to see the aforesaid young man who was still laboring under great distress of mind.

One man present, an open deist, who delighted much in Paine's book, despised the Bible, and spake evil of religion, was awakened to a sense of his danger, and through the goodness of God, was brought into liberty and united to the church with a number of others, who had been brought to bow to the righteous scep∣tre of Zion's victorious and ever glorious King.</P>

<HEAD>SOME GENERAL REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have been particular in noting the day when the churches were formed, and by whom they were received into fellowship, that we may give the reader some idea of their circumstances in the in∣fant state of the country, and when there were but sew in habitants to what there is now. The settlements were very small and scattered o∣ver a great extent of country: many of the first settlers were the pro∣fessed children of God, but in general they became backsliders: the difficulties of settling a new and uncultivated country, the hardships they endured, and the want of opportunities to attend on religious meetings, may be assigned as part of the reasons for this declension. God permitted them in some measure to overcome the stubbornness of the country, and then was pleased to recall the wan∣dering of their minds. The reformations began with those backsli∣ders, and was attended with power on the hearts of those that knew not God; and yet the village perhaps so small that all might meet in a small log house, and if the shower extended further, a log barn or an adjacent wood formed their place of worship.</P>
<P>Our brethren in the old towns and cities have sept abroad accounts of the wonderful work of God among them, but if we take a com∣parative view of the numbers, if ten in our small villages are brought to the knowledge of the truth, it is more in proportion than an hun∣dred in some of those places: but in some places, where the settle∣ments have been of earlier date, it has been surprising to see the num∣bers collected, instances have been known of two or three hundred people convening at a weekly lecture. None of these churches are of longer standing than about seven years (excepting Springfield church,) which time is short for the extraordinary increase, which is about four times the number since the association formed, which is a∣bout five years. There are yet a number of churches in Onondaga and Ontario counties which have formed a conference among them∣selves, concerning which we have been able to obtain little or no in∣formation; a number of reformations have taken place there under the preaching of our fellow laborer Elder David Irish an account of which we cannot obtain before this goes to the press.</P>
<P>We have given an account by whom these churches were received into fellowship, that we might inform the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eader of the union that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken place, and the care there has been both in ministers and church∣es, to guard against errors in doctrine and practice: it is worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> observation that the loose manner in which the laws of the sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> New-York concerning the first day of the week were execused, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gether with the mixture of inhabitants of different sentiments, al∣most overthrew the observation of the day; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cessary that the religious observation of the first day, should be eni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n∣ed on the churches at their formation, and made an article in their covenant, and that every head of a family should set up the worship of God, dy vocal prayer in their houses.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037650_0036_100F7BC90874F290"/>
There were but five ordained ministers when the association <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> formed, and no two of them nigher together than twenty five <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, one of them, living at the distance of sixty or seventy miles from the body of the association, did little but minister to the church to which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>orged; another but se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red abroad, so that the weight of the work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay on three, together with the assistance of some young men whom the Lord was raising up, and some traveling Elder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from other Associations.

<P>In the year 1793, Eld'r Joel Butler came to the Royal Grant, and began to preach to a few scattered i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tants; a considerable oppo∣sition was made against him by an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>birious I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>guer, whose charac∣ter has since came up to public view; this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed his progress for some time, but the hand of the Lord was with him, a church was formed under the name of Fairfield and Pala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. In the spring of the year 1795, a considerable reformation began in Litchfield, Eld'r Butler princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pally attended, preached and bapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed; when this refor∣mation subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed others took place; Eld'r Butler's calls were nume∣rous, and as a zealous act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve laborer in the cause, was greatly instru∣mental of the grow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of the north western part of this Association, and is to be respected for his caution, piety and abilities.</P>
<P>In June 1795, Eld'r Ashoal Hosmer removed his family to Bor∣lington and began to labor, in connexion with Eld'rs Butler and For∣man, whose friendship to him as a stranger and unused to the woods, he is ever ready to acknowledge. An expensive circuit became the lot of each of these, the frequent calls from the little numbers in one place and another, "to come over and help us," necessitated them to encounter the hardships of rains and snow, by day and night, through uncultivated wilds and unoccupied roads, without much hopes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urthly reward, the country being new and the churches small; the people, poor, were hardly able to support themselves without expend∣ing much on the preacher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Joined to these discouragements was a∣nother of greater magnitude; that was, the frequent intrusion of men of corrupt principles and characters, who, imagining that the country was favorable to their sinister views, not only journeyed, but some ac∣tually removed and got into the vicinity of some of the small churches, and through their means divisions and contentions arose, which caused councils, the preachers must be called for, and when they discharged their duty, and bore testimony against their evil conduct, heavy re∣flections from them and their partizans were the consequence, yet a∣mid all these discourag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ments they co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinued their exertions, and God crowned their labors with su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess, and comforted their souls by pour∣ing out his holy spirit; the old professors were stimulated to unite in church relation, and sinners were converted to the knowledge of the truth; the wilderness that once sit solitary and was the lurking place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> savage men and beasts, now became the place where God was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ipped
<PB N="37" REF="037650_0037_100F7BCD8EFC1710"/>in truth and sincerity. These observations will in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account for those rules which appears in our minutes, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcited the wonder of our friends and the malice of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mies.</P>
<P>After the formation of the Association, Eld'r Roots came into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> country, whose industry is best icon by an extract from his journal, which we here subjoin:—"In December 1795, I came to Litchfield, in the state of New-York. in consequence of an invitation which I re∣ceived Elder Hosmer of Burlington, who had been desired by the baptift at Litchfield to engage some preacher to come among them. About the first of January 1796, I agreed to preach at Litchfield one half of the time for one year. During this year I rode and preached in many places; and in the month<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of October, I rode as far as the Genes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e River and preached thirty two times;" since which time Eld'r Roots has married in this country, has removed his residence to Hamilton, obtained a letter of dismission from the church in Boston, joined with the first church in Hamilton and continues his labors in that and adjacent places.</P>
<P>In the year 1796, the church in Franklin, having obtained a dis∣mission from the Shaftsbury Association, united with us, which added Eld'r James Bacon to our number, whose unwearied labors, notwith∣standing his advanced age, has been a source of great comfort to churches and ministers. At the sitting of the Association in Septem∣ber t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is year, Eld'r John Bostwick, who had lately been ordained in the second church in Otsego, Eld'r David Irish of Scipio chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, were received in fellowship, and Eld'r Hezekiah East<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an, who had remo∣ved to Paris and was laboring with a people where a church hath since been formed, came and formed an acquaintance with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The same autumn Eld'r Stephen Parsons, a man of super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or abilities, settled in Whit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ftown and commenced labor in union with us. At the next Association, he, with Eld'r Lake of Kertright, joined and in∣creased our strength. Shortly after this, Stephen Taylor was ordain∣ed in the third church in Burlington, and continues his labors with that church and oceasionally with others to good acceptance. The next year, John Lawton was ordained in the Butlernut church, and conti∣nues with them at present, and of a truth we may say the Lord has done great things for us, whereof we are glad. The extent of this as∣sociation from east to west is about one hundred and forty miles, &amp; from north to south about 60. The first association was holden in a meet∣inghouse, built by the baptists and congregationalists in Springfield, the second mostly in the woods, the third in a barn, the fourth and fifth in dwelling houses; and in all these the presence of the Lord has more than made up the want of convenience. The rapid increase of these new settlements has now made many of our congregations respectable, though it is to be lamented that many of the settlers do not attention the worship of God.</P>
<P>Let the reader pause a moment and reflect on the mavelous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork of God, and he will be astonished to think that such a va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> exte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ritory

<OPENER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"IN compliance with your request, I send you an account respect∣ing religion in this new settlement in the summer of 1796, being des∣titute of preaching a number of serious persons agreed to meet togeth∣er on the sabbath, to read and pray together, which was ever after attended to. In the winter of 1797 religious conferences were set up and attended to weekly, although the number very small, part of the not more than one male exclusive of the family where the meeting was held would attend. Although very discouraging, yet they were continued. A most remarkable stupidity appeared among the peo∣ple. About the beginning of Autumn 1797, there was one woman under strong impressions of mind; and I trust she was born again as she gives evidence of the new birth. The 9th of June, 1798, a church was gathered here by the Rev. Mr. S— which consisted of 13 members, which had belonged to other churches; there has been ad∣ditions made until its number was 24, since which two have moved away.</P>
<P>The latter part of the summer, 1799, several persons appeared to be under some impressions of mind; the work gradually increased till about the last of October, when there appeared an uncommon so∣lemnity on the countenances of people, &amp; a number were struck under strong impressions: Nearly at the same time in No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ember, three per∣sons were propounded to the church, and last sabbath 17 more; and more I expect will shortly come forward and confess Christ before the world. At present the awakening appears to be at a stand: This work has been remarkable on account of the steadiness of the people: nothing of the enthusiastic nature has appeared; God is a sovereign, he has taken some of the most unlikely persons to human appearance; grey headed and middle-aged, and mostly passed by the youth. Oh, my friend I most earnestly intreat your prayers to Almighty God for us, that he would continue to pour out his spirit more and more a∣mong us, and not pass by the youth, and that it may spread from house to house, from heart to heart, from state to state, and from na∣tion to nation; till the glory of the Lord covers the earth as the wa∣ter does the sea: which is the sincere prayer of your friend.</P>
