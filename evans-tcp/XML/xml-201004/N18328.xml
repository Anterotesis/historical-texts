<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"IF there is joy in the presence of the angels of GOD, over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no repentance;"—and "if the SON of MAN came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance," certainly it is the incumbent duty of those to whom he hath committed the "DOC∣TRINE of remission of sins," and "recon∣ciliation to GOD," not only to "go through the cities and villages," preaching PEACE by JESUS CHRIST;" but also, to "vi∣sit the prison-house," even the dungeon, and to communicate the "glad tidings of salvation" to those "who sit under the sha∣dow of death."</P>
<P>To turn such "as are fast bound in af∣fliction and iron, from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD, that they may have a portion among those who are sanctified through the blood of Jesus, is the design of the following manual, in con∣junction with the morning and evening, and other holy offices of the church.</P>
<P>Though there is in the hands of the pub∣lic, a great variety of devotional tracts, yet
<PB N="ii" REF="023776_0003_0FC1239C7570B1D0"/>few or none of them (so far as the author knows) are professedly written for un∣fortunate victims of justice: therefore, to render the matter and the manner of the following devotions, unexceptionable in the eyes of Christians, and promotive of faith and repentance in convicts, they are written after the manner of the antient liturgies; and the matter is principally se∣lected from the word of GOD.</P>
<P>N. B. As the following devotions are most likely to fall into the hands of the benevolent and humane, "who weep with those that weep, and mourn with those that mourn;" the author has to request their candor for any inaccuracies they may discover, either in the composition or printing, as they were carried directly from the pen to the press; in order that, with all possible expedition, they might be put into the hands of <HI>James Williams</HI> and <HI>Thomas Mount,</HI> now lying under sen∣tence of death in the gaol of Newport.</P>

<P>Ye who are dead to the law, and under the sentence of condemnation, listen to the voice of your gracious and compas∣sionate GOD calling you to repentance, in order that ye may find mercy in the day of judgment. Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of GOD—If ye do sincerely repent, confess and forsake your sins, <HI>"tho' they were as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow; tho' your wickednesses have gone over your heads, they shall not be your de∣struction!"</HI> Therefore—Be afflicted—mourn, and weep,—humble yourselves in the sight of GOD. Turn unto the Lord, with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning. For, the sacrifices of GOD are a broken spirit—a
<PB N="2" REF="023776_0004_0FC1239DA72BD118"/>broken and a contrite heart, O GOD, thou wilt not despise. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall find mercy. Ye shall remember your ways, and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight, for all your evils that ye have com∣mitted. If ye confess your sins, GOD is faithful and just to forgive you your sins, and to cleanse you from all unrighteous∣ness. Cast away from you all your trans∣gressions <HI>(by confessing them freely and with∣out reserve)</HI> and turn yourselves from all your transgressions <HI>(by sincere repentance)</HI> so iniquity shall not be your ruin. "<HI>The</HI> LAW <HI>is made for the lawless and disobedient. By the</HI> LAW <HI>is the knowledge of</HI> SIN; <HI>and</HI> SIN <HI>is the transgression of the</HI> LAW. <HI>The</HI> CIVIL MAGISTRATE <HI>beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the</HI> MINISTER <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</HI>"</P>

<P><HI>Let us pray.</HI></P>
<P>O most merciful and gracious GOD, who in the midst of deserved punishment, art wont to remember undeserved mercy;—in
<PB N="3" REF="023776_0004_0FC1239DA72BD118"/>thy wise providence thou hast compassed <HI>these thy creatures, our brethren,</HI> and taken them in the <HI>net</HI> of their <HI>own</HI> wickedness; by the power of thy grace, so convince them of <HI>justice, temperance,</HI> and <HI>judgment</HI> to come, that they may <HI>tremble</HI> at the sight of their guilt, and <HI>fearfully</HI> cry out, "what shall I do to be saved, and escape the wrath to come?"—Grant them repentance unto life, that when the sword of temporal jus∣tice shall have received the drink-offering of <HI>their</HI> blood,—the blood of Jesus, which was shed to wash away the guilt of every penitent, may purify them, both in soul, body and spirit, and qualify them for a por∣tion in the paradise of GOD. Hear us, O merciful GOD, for the sake of thine adora∣ble Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>CONFESSION.</HEAD>
<P>Prostrate, on this earth which is soon to receive my wretched and sinful body, and "spreading out my hands unto the Lord my GOD, I thus make my confession," and humbly beseech my good, but highly of∣fended GOD, to have mercy upon me, a miserable sinner, thro' the death and inter∣cession of JESUS my blessed and adorable SAVIOUR; who was in the days of his so∣journing on this earth, numbered with ma∣lefactors—
<PB N="5" REF="023776_0005_0FC123A1B04715C8"/>died on the cross as one, and on the cross promised pardon to the penitent thief, under that most expressive form <HI>"this day shalt thou be with me in Paradise."</HI>—Grant, O Lord, my repentance may be sincere as his was, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, <HI>remember me, when thou comest</HI> to judge the world! <HI>O my God!</HI> I am ashamed and blush, to lift up my face unto thee; for mine iniqui∣ties are increased over mine head, my tres∣pass is grown up into the heavens. "My iniquities have bound me with iron," and delivered me into the hands of inexorable justice, which hath condemned me to die "an accursed and ignominious death." Behold I am before thee, <HI>O my offended Fa∣ther,</HI> covered all over with my trespasses, those garments of condemnation! I bow down, meekly to acknowledge that thy judgments are altogether right, and that in very faithfulness and mercy hast thou stopt me in my mad career of guilt, and put me in the dungeon under the shadow of death. Behold I am vile: what shall I ans∣wer thee? I will acknowledge my sin unto thee (O my Heavenly Father, if so vile, so grievously an offending wretch may pre∣sume
<PB N="6" REF="023776_0006_0FC123AC9C09A0A8"/>to address thee by that endearing name) I will confess my transgressions un∣to my Lord GOD, that thou mayest forgive the iniquity of my sins. I will declare mine imquity, I will be sorry for my sins. My transgressions are multiplied before thee, and my sins testify against me. Thou, <HI>O God,</HI> art wroth, for I have sinned <HI>in thought, word,</HI> and <HI>deed against thy holy com∣mandments, and against the laws of civil so∣ciety. Under the scorching heart of</HI> thy dis∣pleasure, I fade as a leaf; my iniquities, like the wind, have taken me away from the dwellings of men. But, O Lord, thou art my Father; I am the clay, and thou the potter—I am the work of thy hands—thy blessed and adorable Son died for me a violent death: O may the purifying stream of his blood flow upon me, to cleanse me from my guilty stains! I am made after thy image, O adorable Creator! but, alas! how have I defaced and abused thy like∣ness—forfeited all claim to my heavenly original—done despite to the spirit of grace, and trampled under foot the price of hu∣man redemption!—After this, by what name of connection shall I, wretched man that I am! address thee? But because thy
<PB N="7" REF="023776_0006_0FC123AC9C09A0A8"/>mercy is over all thy other works. I <HI>will hope,</HI> I <HI>will lean</HI> upon that mercy, I <HI>will run</HI> from the wrath to come, to <HI>hide</HI> my∣self under the shadow of thy mercy-seat.—I <HI>will flee</HI> to my offended, but compassion∣ate GOD, and will borrow the words of the penitent prodigal, and say—<HI>Father! I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight—end am no more worthy to be called thy son!</HI>—But, O Father, wilt thou receive me? Is thy Son's blood able to atone for my guilt? Is not thy mercy gone for ever?—I know that though mercy standeth continually be∣fore thy face, yet justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne! Justly hast thou delivered me over to the tormentors, that I should pay the forfeiture of my life! and therefore, O my GOD! horror taketh hold of me,—my bowels are turned within me!—O that my head were waters, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I might weep day and night, to wash away the pol∣lutions of my guilty soul and body! My soul shall weep in secret, for my <HI>folly</HI>—my <HI>vanity</HI>—my <HI>ignorance</HI>—my <HI>neglect of thy sabbaths</HI> and <HI>sacraments</HI>—for the <HI>contempt</HI> I have shewn to thy holy word and com∣mandments—for my <HI>lying, stealing,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="023776_0007_0FC123AE9F38E798"/><HI>deceitfulness</HI>—for having <HI>indulged</HI> my de∣praved nature in <HI>every evil thing;</HI> for <HI>com∣mission</HI> of the sins I was warned against, as well as for <HI>omission</HI> of what I ought to have done!—Woe is me! the crown is fallen from my head! I abhor myself in dust and ashes! O hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my misdees—grant me the comfort of thy salvation, and redeem me from everlasting death! Most merciful, most pitiful, most gracious GOD! hear in heaven the seat of thy holiness, hear my confession and my complaint, and pardon me, for the sake of thy Christ, who was named JESUS, <HI>because he saves his people from their sins.</HI>—Unto my GOD, I desire to offer up, whether in <HI>life</HI> or <HI>death,</HI> all <HI>sub∣mission, adoration,</HI> and <HI>thanks,</HI> through Je∣sus Christ, my Lord and Saviour.

<HEAD>THE LESSON.</HEAD>
<P>Our GOD is a consuming fire: clouds and darkness are round about him, justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne: a fire goeth before him, and burneth up
<PB N="10" REF="023776_0008_0FC123AFB2E2A068"/>his enemies round about. His lightnings enlightened the world; the earth saw and trembled. The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord; at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. He put on the garments of vengeance for cloth∣ing, and was clad with zeal, as a cloak. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay—fury to his adversaries, and recompence to his enemies. And none can stay his hand, or say unto him, what dost thou. Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings: there is no darkness, nor sha∣dow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. There is no crea∣ture that is not manifest in his sight. Now, consider this, ye that forget GOD, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</P>

<HEAD>THE EXHORTATION.</HEAD>
<P>Dearly beloved,—your iniquities have turned the hand of justice against you; they have whetted the sword of vengeance: GOD hath beset you before and behind, and shut you up in a place of darkness. A violent death is soon to remove you from the land of the living, and from the place of hope: Behold, now is the accept∣ed time; behold, now is the day of salva∣tion! "Confess and bewail your manifold offences, and so repent you truly of your sins, as you tender the eternal salvation of your souls. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord! for he is of purer eyes than
<PB N="14" REF="023776_0010_0FC123B31888F1E0"/>to behold iniquity: sinners cannot dwell with him, neither can the ungodly stand in his sight."—What then shall ye do to be saved, and escape the dreadful sentence of the second death? "Repent, and be∣lieve in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and ye shall be saved." "Knowing the terrors of the LORD," let me persuade you, bre∣thren, to prepare for that tremendous day, when the ALMIGHTY GOD shall descend with the voice of ten thousand thunders, and thousand times ten thousands of an∣gels, to command the sun into darkness, the moon into blood, the stars from their orbits, and the dead from their graves! All hearts shall quake; all faces shall ga∣ther paleness, when Jehovah shall visit the wickedness of such as dwell upon this earth; when he shall scatter hail, fire, and brimstone, upon the impenitent and the ungodly! O repent in time, and seek an interest in the atonement of JESUS, whilst the day of intercession lasteth. O strive— wrestle with GOD, as Jacob wrestled of old with the ANGEL of the covenant, for the blessing: plead with GOD, to have mercy upon you, for the sake of the world's Re∣deemer; "for he is merciful and gracious,
<PB N="15" REF="023776_0010_0FC123B31888F1E0"/>and will not for ever turn away his face from you, if ye return to him. As high as the heaven is above the earth, so great is his mercy towards them that fear him!" Grieve vehemently, that ye have so long despised the <HI>goodness, patience,</HI> and <HI>long-suffering,</HI> of GOD, when he called you to <HI>repentance,</HI> by so many <HI>mercies</HI> and <HI>forbear∣ances;</HI> as also by the <HI>apprehensions</HI> of, and <HI>escapes</HI> from justice, during a long series of wickedness. Smite upon your breasts, and say, "GOD be merciful to me, a sinner!" and lament with the deepest contrition and heart-rending woe, that ye have been so long led captive by the <HI>Devil,</HI> the enemy of GOD and MAN; that ye have hated <HI>knowledge,</HI> that ye have abhorred the <HI>coun∣sel</HI> of GOD, and despised his <HI>correction,</HI> and repeated <HI>admonitions</HI> to amend! No longer abuse that <HI>goodness:</HI> without delay return to him, who hath promised to receive all true penitents. Although ye have sinned, sinned grievously both against GOD and MAN, yet, upon your repentance, and advo∣cate will stand up to plead your cause "even JESUS CHRIST the righteous, who is the propitiation for your sins. Finally, brethren, number your days so as to apply
<PB N="16" REF="023776_0011_0FC123B6746BCCC0"/>your hearts to that wisdom which maketh wise unto eternal salvation! and therefore, examine well your consciences, satisfy all the demands of justice, disclose every part of the scene of iniquity ye have been en∣gaged, in, sincerely forgive those who first seduced you into the ways of unrighteous∣ness, and pray to GOD to have mercy upon them and to reclaim them from the error of their way; forgive and pray for all who have any way been instrumental in bring∣ing you under the sword of justice; bless your judges, and pray that GOD may al∣ways render their ministry effectual, for the suppression of wickedness and vice, and the maintenance of religion and virtue, and that they may be always endued with grace, wisdom and understanding, to judge according to truth and justice. Now, and in your last moments, pray for CHRIST'S universal church, to which ye profess to belong; and in the communion of which ye desire to die; that every member of the same may live in unity and charity: pray for the protection and blessing of GOD up∣on the land of your pilgrimage, and upon all the people that dwell therein; so that all who have "sold themselves to work
<PB N="17" REF="023776_0011_0FC123B6746BCCC0"/>wickedness," as ye in times past have done, when they hear of your <HI>repentance</HI> for your crimes, and of your death to appease the demands of justice; warned by your dread∣ful end, and encouraged by the example of your contrition, they may, by a seasona∣ble reformation of heart and manners, turn from the error of their ways and live. For GOD desireth not the death of a sinner, nor taketh he any pleasure in the destruction of the ungodly: he delighteth to be glorified in, and to glorify his saints, and proclaim∣eth, that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no repent∣ance. Meditate on these things, brethren, and may GOD direct and guide your feet into the way of peace, and have mercy up∣on you, for the sake of JESUS CHRIST, our only redeemer and advocate; to whom, with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST, be all honor and glory, now and evermore.

<P>I will cry unto GOD with my voice; even unto GOD will I cry with my voice, and he shall hearken unto me. When I am in heaviness, I will think upon GOD; when my heart is vexed, I will complain. Will the Lord absent himself for ever! and will he be no more entreated? Is his
<PB N="20" REF="023776_0013_0FC123C7A5DE3AA8"/>mercy clean gone for ever? and is his pro∣mise come utterly to an end for evermore Hath GOD forgotten to be gracious? and will he shut up his loving-kindness in dis∣pleasure? I am become as it were a mon∣ster unto many; but my sure trust is in thee. Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee. My flesh and my heart faileth; but GOD is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. Glory be to my merciful and gracious GOD now and evermore. Amen.</P>

<P><HI>Jesus said.</HI>—"Take heed and beware of covetousness." Godliness is great riches, if a man be content with that which he hath; for we brought nothing into the world, neither may we carry any thing out. And having food and raiment, let us there∣with
<PB N="21" REF="023776_0013_0FC123C7A5DE3AA8"/>be content. But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the <HI>love</HI> of money is the <HI>root</HI> of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the saith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. <HI>Therefore,</HI> let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands, the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. The thoughts of the diligent tend to plenteous∣ness; but the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them. Speak every man truth to his neighbor, and love no false oath. Know this, that the LAW is not made for a righ∣teous man, but for the lawless and disobe∣dient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fa∣thers, and murtherers of mothers, for man∣slayers, for whore-mongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for man∣stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever else there is contrary to sound doctrine. Be not deceived; neither forni∣cators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
<PB N="22" REF="023776_0014_0FC123C92C8114E8"/>mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of GOD. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witness, blasphemies; these are the things which defile a man: because of these things com∣eth the wrath of GOD upon the children of disobedience.</P>

<P>No man can by any means redeem his brother nor give to GOD a ransom for him. Will the Lord <HI>thou</HI> be pleased with thou∣sands of rams; or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first born for my transgression? the fruit of my bo∣dy for the sin of my soul? Ye are not re∣deemed with corruptible things, such as silver and gold; but with the precious blood of CHRIST, as of a lamb without spot, and without blemish. GOD so lov∣ed the WORLD, that he gave his only be∣gotten SON, that whosoever believeth in him should not <HI>perish,</HI> but have everlasting life. In this was manifested the love of GOD towards us, because that GOD sent
<PB N="23" REF="023776_0014_0FC123C92C8114E8"/>his only begotten SON into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved GOD, but that he loved us, and sent his SON to be the PRO∣PITIATION for us. This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that CHRIST JESUS came into the world to save sinners. CHRIST being come, by his own BLOOD entered once into the HOLY PLACE, <HI>having obtained eternal redemp∣tion</HI> for us.—<HI>Wherefore</HI>—GOD wil∣ling more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for GOD to lie, WE might have a strong CONSOLATION who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the HOPE set be∣fore us. Blessed be GOD, who hath be∣gotten us again unto a lively HOPE, by JESUS CHRIST.</P>

<P>The <HI>seed</HI> of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head. The <HI>desire</HI> of all nations shall come. A VIRGIN shall conceive and bear a SON, and shall call his name IMMA∣NUEL.
<PB N="24" REF="023776_0015_0FC123CCCC8EFB28"/>The angel GABRIEL was sent from GOD unto a VIRGIN named MARY, of the house of DAVID, and said unto her, "Fear not MARY, for thou hast sound favor with GOD; and behold, thou shalt conceive, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. That HOLY BEING who shall be born of thee shall be called the "SON OF GOD." And when the days were accom∣plished that she should be delivered, MARY brought forth her first-born SON, and wrap∣ped him in swadling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn! And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins. Unto us a CHILD is born, unto us a SON is given; his name shall be called WONDER∣FUL, COUNSELLOR, the MIGHTY GOD, the EVERLASTING FATHER, the PRINCE of PEACE. In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with GOD, and the WORD was GOD; and the WORD was made FLESH, and dwelt among us, and we be∣held his GLORY, the GLORY as of the only begotten of the FATHER, full of GRACE and TRUTH.</P>

<P>John <HI>(the Baptish)</HI> seeing JESUS com∣ing unto him, faith, behold the LAMB of GOD, who taketh away the sin of the world. JESUS being baptized, and praying, the heavens were opened, and the HOLY GHOST descended in a bodily shape like a <HI>dove,</HI> upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, THOU ART MY BELOVED SON, IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED. John Baptist bare record say∣ing. "he that sent me to baptize with wa∣ter, the same said unto me, UPON WHOM THOU SHALT SEE THE SPIRIT DESCENDING AND REMAINING, THE SAME IS HE WHO BAPTIZETH WITH THE HOLY GHOST." John sent two of his disciples unto JESUS, saying, "art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" JESUS said, "return and shew John these things which ye do HEAR and SEE: THE BLIND RECLIVE THEIR SIGHT, THE LAME WALK, THE DEAF HEAR, THE DEAD ARE RAISED UP, AND THE POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED UNTO THEM." The <HI>whole</HI> need not a <HI>physician,</HI> but they that are <HI>sick.</HI> I am come, not to call the righteous, but
<PB N="26" REF="023776_0016_0FC123CDA5FD72D8"/>sinners to repentance. The Son of Man is come to SEEK and to SAVE that which was LOST. This is the Father's will, who hath sent me, that of <HI>all whom he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</HI> I AM THE BREAD OF LIFE; I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this BREAD he shall live for ever: the BREAD that I will give, is my FLESH, which I will GIVE for the LIFE of the world. Except ye eat the FLESH of the SON of MAN, and drink his BLOOD, ye have no LIFE in you. Whoso eateth my FLESH, and drinketh my BLOOD, hath eter∣nal LIFE, and I WILL RAISE HIM UP AT THE LAST DAY. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the SON of MAN be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And I, if I be LIFT∣ED UP FROM THE EARTH, will draw all men unto me. This spake JESUS, signify∣ing what death he should die.</P>

<P>Behold, my servant shall deal prudently,
<PB N="27" REF="023776_0016_0FC123CDA5FD72D8"/>he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: So shall he sprinkle many na∣tions: the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for <HI>that</HI> which had not been told them shall they see, and <HI>that</HI> which they had not heard shall they consider. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness: and when we shall see him, <HI>there is</HI> no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and re∣jected of men; a man of sorrows, and ac∣quainted with grief: and we hid as it were <HI>our</HI> faces from him: he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD, and afflicted. But he <HI>was</HI> wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace <HI>was</HI> upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
<PB N="28" REF="023776_0017_0FC123D162A6F4D8"/>his own way: and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was op∣pressed, and he was afflicted, yet he open∣ed not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep be∣fore her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from pri∣son and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the trans∣gression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death: because he had done no violence, neither <HI>was any</HI> deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put <HI>him</HI> to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <HI>his</HI> seed, he shall prolong <HI>his</HI> days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul <HI>and</HI> shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I di∣vide him <HI>a portion</HI> with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong: be∣cause he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
<PB N="29" REF="023776_0017_0FC123D162A6F4D8"/>transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</P>

<P>Caiphas the High Priest, said unto them, it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole na∣tion perish not; and thus spake he not of himself; but he prophesied that JESUS should die for that nation, and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in ONE, the children of GOD that were scattered abroad. Afterwards, the chief priests and rulers of the Jews were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And Pilate gave sen∣tence, that it should be as they required. And the soldiers crucified him! And sit∣ting down, they watched him; and set up over his head his accusation, writ∣ten THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS! Thus, Jesus bore our sins in his own body on the tree; and by being made a curse for us, redeemed us from the curse of the law: for it is written, curseth is every one that hangeth on a tree. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was dark∣ness
<PB N="30" REF="023776_0018_0FC123DF04BF6C70"/>over all the earth, until the ninth hour; the sun was darkned, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And when JESUS had cried with a loud voice, "My GOD, my GOD, why hast thou for∣saken me? he said, FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT; and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. And with him they crucify TWO THIEVES; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. One of the thieves raised on JE∣SUS, but the other rebuked him, saying, dost thou not fear GOD, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for <HI>we receive the due reward of our deeds,</HI> but THIS MAN <HI>hath done nothing amiss.</HI> And he said unto JESUS, LORD REMEMBER ME WHEN THOU COMEST INTO THY KING∣DOM! And <HI>Jesus</HI> said unto him, THIS DAY SHALT THOU BE WITH ME IN PARADISE.</P>

<P>And Joseph of Arimathea went to Pi∣late, and begged the BODY of JESUS; and Pilate commanded the BODY to be deliv∣ed. And when Joseph had taken the BODY, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and
<PB N="31" REF="023776_0018_0FC123DF04BF6C70"/>laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed. Then the chief priests and pharisees went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting a watch. In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdelene and the other Ma∣ry, to see the sepulchre. And behold there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His counte∣nance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow, and for fear of him, the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And <HI>the women</HI> entering into the sepulchre, saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white gar∣ment; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them, be not affrighted; ye seek JESUS of Nazareth, who was crucifi∣ed; he is risen; he is not here. Why seek ye the living (HIM THAT LIVTEH) among the dead? <HI>Afterwards,</HI> the eleven disci∣ples went away into Galilee, into a moun∣tain where JESUS had appointed them.
<PB N="32" REF="023776_0019_0FC123E2C61EE118"/>And JESUS came and spake unto them, saying, ALL POWER IS GIVEN UNTO ME IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH.—Go ye there∣fore, and teach (disciple) all nations, bap∣tizing them in the name of the FATHER, and of the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST; teaching <HI>them</HI> to observe <HI>all things</HI> whatso∣ever I have commanded <HI>you;</HI> and lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world. Amen. And he said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved CHRIST to <HI>suffer,</HI> and to rise from the dead the third day: and that REPENTANCE and REMISSION OF SINS should be preach∣ed in his NAME, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are WITNESSES of these things. And he led them out as far as Bethany, and HE LIFTED UP HIS HANDS AND BLES∣SED THEM. And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said,—"ye men of Gali∣lee, why stand ye gazing up into hea∣ven? This same JESUS who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so COME in like
<PB N="33" REF="023776_0019_0FC123E2C61EE118"/>manner as ye have seen him GO into hea∣ven." This man, after he had offered ONE SACRIFICE for sins, for ever sat down at the right hand of GOD; for by ONE OFFERING he hath PERFECTED for ever them that are sanctified. We see JESUS, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suf∣fering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that HE, by the grace of GOD, should taste death for every man. Him GOD raised from the dead, and set him at his own right hand, in the heaven∣ly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and eve∣ry name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put <HI>all things</HI> under his feet, hav∣ing made him HEAD over <HI>all things</HI> to the CHURCH, which is his BODY, the fullness of him that filleth all in all. Christ hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to GOD, for a sweet-smelling savor. He was delivered for our offences. Herein GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet enemies, CHRIST died for us. For as by one man's <HI>disobedience,</HI> many were made sinners, so by the <HI>obedience</HI> of ONE, shall
<PB N="34" REF="023776_0020_0FC123E4F2863828"/>many be made righteous. We are sancti∣fied through the offering of the BODY of CHRIST once for all. JESUS, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> GOD hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name, that at the name of JESUS every knee should <HI>bow,</HI> of things (beings or existences) in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should <HI>confess,</HI> that JESUS CHRIST IS LORD TO THE GLORY OF GOD THE FATHER. GOD was manifest in the <HI>flesh,</HI> justifi∣ed in the <HI>spirit,</HI> seen of <HI>angels,</HI> received up into glory. Of the SON, he saith,—let all the angels of GOD worship him. And again he saith—thy throne, O GOD, is for ever and ever. Worthy is the LAMB that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and hon∣or, and glory, and blessing. Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto HIM who sitteth upon the throne, and unto the LAMB for ever and ever. Unto HIM that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us unto God KINGS and PRIESTS, out of every <HI>kindred,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="023776_0020_0FC123E4F2863828"/>and <HI>tongue,</HI> and <HI>people,</HI> and <HI>nation,</HI> be glory and dominion, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>

<P>Behold he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also who pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him! And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond man, and every free man hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, fall on us and hide us from the face of HIM that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the LAMB; for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? I beheld till the thrones were cast down, saith Daniel; and the ANTIENT OF DAYS did sit, whose <HI>garment</HI> was white as snow, whose <HI>loins</HI> were girded with fine gold of Uphaz; his <HI>body</HI> was like the beryl; his <HI>face</HI> as the appearance of lightning; his <HI>eyes</HI> as lamps of fire; the <HI>hair</HI> of his <HI>head</HI> like the fine wool; his <HI>arms</HI> and his <HI>feet</HI> in colour like to polished brass; and the

I was in the spirit, <HI>saith the beloved disciple,</HI> and behold a <HI>throne</HI> was set in hea∣ven, and ONE sat on the <HI>throne.</HI> And HE that sat, was to look upon like a jasper, and a sardine stone: and there was a <HI>rain∣bow</HI> round about the <HI>throne,</HI> in sight like unto an emerald.

<P>"O Gracious GOD, who hast set forth thy Son Jesus Christ to be a propitiation for the sins of all mankind, and hast not excluded any from the covenant of repent∣ance, who desire with sincerity to embrace and apply it:" we present our supplica∣tions in behalf of these persons under sen∣tence of death, who desire to confess their unworthiness of the least of thy mercies, yet desirous to turn to thee in acts of contrition and penitence; humbly imploring thy grace to direct them, the knowledge of thee and of thy Son Jesus Christ to guide them into all truth: that, before they de∣part hence, they may evidence the sinceri∣ty of their repentance by fully confessing their sins both against thy laws and those of civil society. Teach them to know, that a full and free confession of their crimes, together with a suitable discovery of their accomplices in robbery, theft, and such like violent and fraudulent deeds, is a debt not less due the good of their country in general, and the health of their own souls in particular, than the life of their bodies to the demands of inflexible justice. May they be deeply humbled un∣der
<PB N="45" REF="023776_0025_0FC123FCF47CEF78"/>thy judgments, and resigned to the present dispensation of thy overruling pro∣vidence: and help them to devote aright the short remainder of their time in preparing for their departure hence; that as they have lived to themselves in times past, they may now begin to live unto their GOD in order to die in his faith and fear. Work in them, O Father of mercies, every heavenly dis∣position that shall tend to qualify them for joining the company of blessed spirits, where the temptations of the Devil, the world, and the flesh shall never assail them. Accept of their repentance, and have mercy upon them, for the sake of thine adorable and well beloved Son JESUS CHRIST, to whom with thee, O HOLY FATHER, and thee, O benign SPIRIT of Grace, be all glory, honor and praise, now and ever∣more.

<HEAD>THE EXHORTATION.</HEAD>
<P>Man! your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity! The voice of your brother's blood crieth unto the Lord, who hath pronounced you <HI>cursed</HI> from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hands! As I live, saith the Lord, I will even do according to your anger, and according to your envy, which you have used against your brother. The hand of the Almighty hath overtaken you, his hot displeasure flameth against the mur∣derer! Ah! how have you troubled the land, and caused it to mourn because of the innocent blood that you have shed therein!
<PB N="49" REF="023776_0027_0FC123FFEB6B8250"/>Did all your other evil deeds appear but trivial in your eyes, that you must sum them up with the <HI>additional,</HI> the <HI>horrible</HI> guilt of sheeding innocent blood? Had you then put off the nature of a <HI>man,</HI> and assumed that of a <HI>Devil?</HI> But now, that your murderous passion has subsided, does not the atrocity of your crime harrow up your inmost soul, and make you, under the most powerful conviction of guilt, fearful∣ly cry out "what shall I do to be saved and escape the wrath to come?" Look at your <HI>hands,</HI> bloody man! do they not ap∣pear to the eye of our distempered soul, all <HI>crimsoned over,</HI> as when they did the horrid deed! your <HI>clothes,</HI> look at them, all blotted with the gore of him whom you have mur∣dered!—Influenced by the spirit of the <HI>evil one,</HI> whose delight is in blood, and the de∣struction of the human race, you have out∣rageously exalted yourself against the meek and loving spirit of HIM, who came into the world to save men's lives, and to give his own life a ransom for many; by doing all that in you lay, to deface the divine likeness stamped upon you by the benevo∣lent Creator, as also to erase your brother's name from the catalogue of the living
<PB N="50" REF="023776_0028_0FC1240173ACB6C8"/>and his existence from the volume of creation! against whom have you lifted up your hand? against whom have you exalted yourself? against the HOLY ONE of Israel, who is a jealous and avenging GOD, and whose ears are always open to the voice of blood: against MAN and the LAWS of civil society; for you have broken down the hedge of peace, and plundered man of one of the highest blessings of hea∣ven, that of <HI>"sitting quietly under his vine, or under his fig-tree, and none to make him afraid."</HI> Also you have sinned against your own life, by incurring a debt, which nothing can pay off, but your blood. And therefore the arrows of the Amighty drink up your spirits, and the sword of temporal justice rages furiously to have your blood. Jehovah, in tremendous majesty, on mount Sinai proclaimed this law, "thou shalt not kill;" and all nations have adopt∣ed it into their system of jurisprudence. Tell me, son of blood, was a man ready to give you the fatal blow, would you not re∣mind him of this prohibitory command, and beg of him to spare your life, at the price of all you had? Yes, doubtless. And did not your conscience forbid you? Did
<PB N="51" REF="023776_0028_0FC1240173ACB6C8"/>it not again and again, with the stern voice of prohibition, ask you, "what! <HI>will thou do this great wickedness, and sin against</HI> GOD?" But, your conscience, O murder∣er! your conscience you had artfully sear∣ed as with an hot iron! you had labored hard to extinguish every seed of goodness, humanity and virtue in your soul! you had despised the admonitions of conscience so long, that she ceased to warn you! you had long turned away your eyes from read∣ing the lessons of divine love and godly in∣struction, tendered to you on the page of revelation; and rather chose to copy into your practice the example of him, who was a murderer from the beginning! GOD was not among your thoughts! Ah! the end of these things is death! Think—murderer—think, if all that is human, ex∣cept the form, hath not quite abandoned you to most infernal obduracy of heart, and insensibility to the woes of others—think, what poignant anguish rends the soul of the disconsolate widow <HI>(here name the kindred, if any)</HI> sorrowing with the most bitter lamentation, for <HI>his</HI> untimely death, whose blood your impious hands have poured out, as water upon the ground, that
<PB N="52" REF="023776_0029_0FC1240E9E82D638"/>cannot be gathered up again! Suffer ima∣gination to present you with a view of the helpless orphans bedewing their father's bloody body with floods of tears!—See, with bitter cries and doleful lamentations, the disconsolate widow falling upon <HI>his</HI> neck and kissing that ghastly face, which now for wife nor children has no smiles— no look of complacency, but the bitterness of untimely death settled in every feature, expressive of the anguish of the inner man, when your impious hands tore soul and body apart! That parent-eye, which ere while beamed looks of love, gladdening with <HI>his</HI> approbation all the family—thou —how shall I address thee!—hast veiled in darkness, no more to behold the light of day—no more to see the jovous objects of industry and love!—Ah! what hast thou done!—How has thy murderous touch stamped lamentation and woe on every scene of their domestic happiness!— No more does the tender glance of pater∣nal eye, returning from the labor of the day, invite the dependant young to clasp their father's knee, or climb up upon him to press their spotless breasts to <HI>his,</HI> and smile like cherubim in <HI>his</HI> face!—No more
<PB N="53" REF="023776_0029_0FC1240E9E82D638"/>do the cheeks and forehead, furrowed with care and honest labor, borrow the appear∣ance of youth, the instant the lovely babes approach to greet their parent welcome, and to salute him with their prattling sto∣ries and their little loves! O man! bloody man! what hast thou done! what thick cloud of darkness and blackness hast thou brought upon all this gay sun-shine of fe∣licity! How hast thou blasted, with thy murderous breath, as with a curse, this fra∣grant blessing of GOD upon his servants! That body which rose with the rising sun, in order to go forth to honest work and la∣bor—with baneful malice, thou hast stopt in its wonted course, and extinguished its lamp of light and life, at noon day! Who gave <HI>thee</HI> authority to save life or to kill? Hast <HI>thou</HI> a right of sovereignty over thy brother? By what authority couldst <HI>thou</HI> presume to exert upon him the power of the destroying angel of death? But why need I any more to harrow up thy soul!— Look inward, base man! and if thou canst see through the black darkness which en∣caseth it, view thy guilty conscience! Be∣hold upon it engraven the words of thy condemnation, <HI>"He that sheddeth man's
<PB N="54" REF="023776_0030_0FC1240FA94CC8D0"/>blood, by man shall his blood be shed."</HI> The innocent blood thou hast shed, crieth a∣gainst thee from the dust, with a voice like thunder,—it <HI>will</HI> be heard—and justice would cease to be justice, were she to stop her ears against it. Justice hath heard the voice of blood, and, miserable man! your own conscience beareth witness that you are justly doomed to die for your offence! to die an ignominious death, to be reckon∣ed accursed from the earth and the hea∣vens; as it is written, "cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree!"—GOD is just and holy, but you have been unjust and cruel; and now the measure you have meted to another is ready to be meted out to yourself.—Your <HI>body,</HI> the instrument of your crime, must repay <HI>blood for blood,</HI>— your soul, by conforming to the conditions offered you by the covenant of evangelical grace, may, and I pray GOD it may, find mercy in the day of his righteous judg∣ment, through the merits and intercession of Jesus. You have therefore no time to lose, no dallying in making up your peace with your highly offended GOD—on every moment hangs your everlasting happiness or woe. If yet, while the day of mercy
<PB N="55" REF="023776_0030_0FC1240FA94CC8D0"/>lasteth, before the intercession of Jesus is finished, you neglect the things that belong to your everlasting peace—how will dire agonies, and pangs unfelt be∣fore, seize upon your guilty soul, when you shall feel the full force of the wrath of the Omnipotent,—and be delivered over to the inexpressible tortures pre∣pared for the Devil and his angels!!!—It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of an angry GOD! And a wounded spirit who can bear? Murder and idolatry have ever been obnoxious to the hottest indig∣nation of Jehovah; and have brought down his most terrible judgments from time to time, to visit the earth! For these crimes the world has frequently been com∣pelled to mourn! Murder and idolatry pro∣voked the Almighty to drown the genera∣tions of men by a flood of waters; to send down streams of lived flame from heaven to consume the cities of Sodom and Go∣morrah; they occasioned the several cap∣tivities of the Jews, and the amazing revo∣lutions and subversions of government among the Gentiles; they have caused fa∣mines and pestilences, and the destruction of cities and countries! and finally, as the
<PB N="56" REF="023776_0031_0FC124114E412798"/>EARTH has been in every age and nation so greatly polluted with blood, whether in the field of battle, or by the ruffian hand of personal violence, or by the blood of numberless victims offered to De∣vils, by idolatrous nations; IT, with all the words that are thereon, shall be burnt up, in the day of the fierce anger of the LORD: but first IT shall be compelled to deliver up IT'S dead, and to disclose all IT'S slain. Alas! who shall live when GOD doth this? If, in the day that tribulation and wrath shall be poured out upon all the ungodly of the earth, the <HI>righteous</HI> and the <HI>penitent</HI> obtain redemption from the second death and the unextinguishable fire, through the merits and intercession of a Mediator, where shall the ungodly and the impenitent ap∣pear, who have despised the intercession of Jesus? therefore, flee, O sinner, flee from the wrath to come, lest the long-suf∣fering and patience of GOD toward thee, become like oil cast on fire, lest thy guilt and punishment press thee down to the lowest depth of misery! GOD is merciful; if thou canst repent, yea, if with a true heart thou prayest for it, he will grant thee repentance unto life: but in proportion to
<PB N="57" REF="023776_0031_0FC124114E412798"/>the heinousness of thy crime must be the fervency of thy prayer. Did the world's REDEEMER, in atoning for the guilt of man—in paying the redemption-price for penitents, sweat drops of blood, groan, and voluntarily offer up his pure and ho∣ly body to die, the <HI>innocent</HI> for the <HI>guilty,</HI> to reconcile us to GOD; and thinkest thou that a few "Lord have mercies," will pa∣cify the offended MAJESTY of heaven and earth? No! If thou desirest to enter in∣to life, having so grievously offended by breaking the command, <HI>thou shalt not kill,</HI> thou must copy so far as thou canst, the ex∣ample of thy Lord, when he was in an ag∣ony for thy sins; a due sense of them will rend thy heart, then will flow the fountains of thy tears, sighs and strong crying, with prayers offered up through the merits and intercession of the ADVO∣CATE for man, will ascend up before GOD, and prove available for thy pardon. At the right hand of the Eternal, contin∣ually standeth the ANGEL of the covenant, the gracious Mediator, in his human na∣ture, ready to offer up the sighs, the pray∣ers, and tears of all penitents, who desire to come to the Father through him. In∣deed
<PB N="58" REF="023776_0032_0FC12412B7325730"/>there is no other way of obtaining mercy, but through CHRIST; he is the <HI>way,</HI> the <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>life,</HI> and no man can come to the FATHER but by his means. He was called JESUS, because he saves his people from the guilt and punishment due to their sins; and as he is appointed the only MEDIATOR between an offended GOD and his offending creature MAN; there is no other NAME given to men, under hea∣ven, whereby they can be saved, but only the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is GOD over all blessed for evermore. Think not, sinful man, think not of ob∣taining the pardoning mercy and grace of GOD, by any other means, or on any other conditions, than those of his own appoint∣ment; by JESUS CHRIST only, thou may∣est be made whole—therefore, labor to em∣brace with meekness and patience, the con∣ditions and promises of evangelical grace; pray, earnestly pray for a portion of that spirit which was poured out upon the pe∣nitent thief on the cross. Learn to realize the hour of thy death,—let it be as the ha∣ven to which thou art to bend thy course, in order that thou mayest, in thy death, be conformed to the death of Jesus, seeing
<PB N="59" REF="023776_0032_0FC12412B7325730"/>thou wouldest not conform to his life in thine. If thou feelest no godly sorrow, no heart-rending woe, how canst thou presume to have any hope towards GOD? If thou really feelest thy spirit so exceedingly dis∣quieted within thee, on account of the blood that is on thy hands, as to allow thee no rest to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eye∣lids, reasonably then thou mayest hope in GOD; for he is merciful and gracious, for∣giving iniquity, transgression and sin to the penitent; and takes delight in the ob∣lation of a troubled and broken spirit.—A broken and a contrite heart GOD will not despise.—According to thy sincerity and contrition be it done unto thee.</P>

<P>O most compassionate and merciful GOD, who hast promised to open the door of mercy to those who knock, and to grant repentance to those who seek it in sinceri∣ty of heart; look down with an eye of pity and compassion on this person, who for murder, is condemned to die. Justly hath he incurred thy wrath and hottest dis∣pleasure, for violating one of thy most ex∣press commands, and the law of humanity implanted in his nature. We adore the
<PB N="65" REF="023776_0035_0FC124216CCD8350"/>justice of thy judgment, in that thou hast looked through the cloud of thy wrath, and troubled him with thine heavy hand. O Lord, unto him belongeth confusion of face, because of the blood-guiltiness that is in his hands—he presumeth not to so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, but with his mouth in the dust, and smiting upon his breast, through the ministry of thine own appointment he prayeth, "GOD be mer∣ciful to me a sinner." Grant unto him true and unfeigned repentance for all the errors of his life past, and especially for the grievous crime which hath entailed on him an ignominious death: enable him, by the eye of faith, to see in their proper colours, thy promises to the penitent, and the ter∣rors of thy judgments against the impeni∣tent and unbelieving, that he may neither deceive himself with false hopes of thy mer∣cy, nor do despite to the grace, by throw∣ing himself headlong into the gulph of despair. O holy and omnipotent RULER of the universe, though he hath presumptu∣ously and under the influence of the <HI>evil one,</HI> risen up to defy the power of thy hand, and with impious rage to blot out from the book of life one of those the SAVIOUR died
<PB N="66" REF="023776_0036_0FC12428F745E700"/>for; now he desireth to return to thee, trembling and afraid at thy wrathful indig∣nation, hoping even against hope, that thou, O Father of mercies, wilt receive him—that thou wilt hear his sighing— that thou wilt behold his tears, and grant him an answer of peace.—Gra∣ciously hast thou been pleased to suffer the involuntary murderer to fly to the city of refuge, and take hold of the horns of the altar; but the wilful and malicious murderer, where shall he go? Where shall he find an asylum? he can find none; jus∣tice hath condemned him to be cut off from the land of the living, by a violent death. But vouchsafe, O heavenly Father, that his punishment may end with this life; that, before he is cut off as a shadow, his soul may, <HI>by reparation for the injury done as far as is in his power,</HI> and by faith in thy Son, escape the doleful mansions of woe and misery, prepared for the Devil and such as follow his murderous example; and with the penitent have a portion in the pa∣radise of GOD, through thy merits and intercession, O Saviour of the world, who suffered the fountains of thy blood to flow in copious streams, branching forth into all
<PB N="67" REF="023776_0036_0FC12428F745E700"/>lands, to wash away the guilt of sinful man. TO GOD, FATHER SON and HOLY GHOST, be all glory, honor and praise, now, hence∣forth and for evermore. Amen.</P>

<P>To whom shall I go, O Jesus—to whom shall I go? thou hast the words of eternal life. To thee I desire to live, to thee I de∣sire to die; receive me, O Christ!—O GOD, whose never-failing providence or∣dereth all things both in heaven and earth,
<PB N="68" REF="023776_0037_0FC1242F32703758"/>thou hast cut off my days in the midst, and shortened my life, on account of my sins; thou art just and holy in all thy ways, and I, a wretched and miserable sinner, here bow down to acknowledge that thou metest out to me the just measure of reward for mine iniquities.—My body is about to be offered up! My forfeited life is doomed the victim of justice!—O thou, who art the HEARER of prayer, and to whom of right it appertains to receive all sacrifice, be graciously pleased to accept of my body as a sacrifice, and of my blood or life as a drink-offering to thy JUSTICE, sanctified and rendered acceptable to thee, through the divine efficacy of the BODY and BLOOD of thy dearly beloved SON, my Lord and Saviour, who was suspended and offered up upon the cross, to die an ignominious and painful death; that, by giving his life a ransom for many, he might restore for∣feited life to a guilty world. O my GOD! I adore thy judgments!—the voice of tem∣poral justice hath doomed me to be con∣formed, in a measure, to thy SON'S death, to hang upon a tree! Grant me, O grant me, that as I am doomed to die a <HI>violent death,</HI> to be suspended between earth and
<PB N="69" REF="023776_0037_0FC1242F32703758"/>heaven, as unworthy of a place in either; that in my last moments, when my soul and body are violently torn asunder, they may, in love and mercy, be united unto thee! May thy BODY, O JESUS, save my sinful <HI>body!</HI>—thy BLOOD, O JESUS, re∣deem my polluted <HI>soul!</HI>—thou, O HOLY GHOST, proceeding from the FATHER and the SON, sanctify me wholly, both in <HI>soul, body and spirit!</HI> Now, and at the hour of my death, I forgive my enemies, and implore thy blessing upon my friends and relations. GOD preserve his holy apostolic church, with all her bishops, priests and deacons— and grant that their episcopacy and holy ministrations may be <HI>always</HI> precious in thy sight, and accompanied with thy blessing. Grant to all the enemies of our LORD and his CHRIST, the gifts and graces of repent∣ance and a better mind; and to those who are going on in the way that leads to death, and more especially to such as have seduc∣ed, or have been seduced by me—shew mercy, and pluck them like fire-brands out of the burning. GOD bless the Uni∣ted States of America, with all their rulers, officers, judges and counsellors, and all their people; and the Lord increase them a
<PB N="70" REF="023776_0038_0FC12430AC454C38"/>thousand fold. Finally, I supplicate thy grace, mercy and blessing, on all and every part of the creation, of which I, an unwor∣thy member, desire with the most perfect fervency of devotion, my sinful soul is ca∣pable of, to commit myself into thy hands. O Jesus! thou didst die for me—I fall a victim for my innumerable offences against the laws of GOD and MAN! I bow down to receive the due reward of my deeds!— Have mercy, O LORD JESUS!—deliver me from the final sentence of condemna∣tion, for "thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens, and thy faithfulness unto the clouds! thy mercy endureth for ever!"— Vouchsafe, O Lord, unto my body, a hap∣py resurrection—to my soul, a portion with the penitent thief—to my whole man, a merciful judgment, and a happy admis∣sion into thy everlasting glory, for thy mer∣cies sake in Christ Jesus my Lord and GOD, my Saviour and Redeemer.

<P>I die!—I die!—I die!—tremendous thought! not as other mortals, a natural, but an accursed and violent death! other mortals die on the downy bed; but I be∣tween heaven and earth, an outcast from both! but this "is the due reward of my deeds!"—Oh! these hands, what have ye brought me to! Oh! these feet, how have ye carried me to do such acts of wicked∣ness! but Oh! head and heart, what have ye to account for? ye have been my coun∣sellors, my prompters to vice! under the specious pretence of obtaining something good (riches or pleasures) ye have undone me!

"Dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return," but not in the way of other mortals, to enjoy the consolations of weeping friends, and those soothing attentions, which seem to pluck up by the roots the thorns of death, and smooth the way to the house appoint∣ed for all living: but with a mind harrow∣ed up with guilt, forsaken of all, the pity of the good and the derision of the bad,
<PB N="73" REF="023776_0039_0FC124322952C028"/>my years cut off in the midst. Oh! the pangs and convulsions of my agonizing heart, when I reflect, how my youth has been spent in folly, and my manhood in the most complicated scenes of guilt! Under this impression, my soul! canst thou— darest thou to look up to GOD? Art not thou verily ashamed of thy existence? Why callest thou not to the mountains to cover thee together with thy guilt, or the sea to bury thee in her deepest caverns, to hide thee from the pure and holy eye of HIM that sitteth upon the throne? Ah! wretch! abominable wretch that I am! how shall I one day appear before his awful tribu∣nal? Will not the spirits of good men veil their faces, that they may not behold such a monster of wickedness as I am? O ye guardian spirits, ye providential ministers of the Most High, will ye not rejoice and triumph in my misery? Ye companions of my guilt, ye whom I have seduced, will ye not pierce me with your upbraidings and wishes, that the Omnipotent would hurl at my head the hottest thunder∣bolts of his wrath?—Oh! despicable wretch that I am! unworthy to breathe the com∣mon air—unworthy to behold the light of

How have I, despicable wretch, disgraced the nature of man—thus to bring a curse upon the image of GOD—thus to die like a brute? How have I flown in the face of the Creator, for making me a man, when I strove so hard to become a Devil? How have I wounded the father that begat me, and the brothers who suckled the breasts of my mother! The tears of all good people who behold me, flow in compassion to my wretchedness; and to the bad, what cause have I given to boast themselves in their wickedness, and to make GOD'S long-suf∣ering and forbearance an argument against his very existence!

<P>Gracious GOD, look in pity and com∣passion upon me! Why did I not stop to consider, that my crimes would unavoida∣bly bring me to this dismal hour of black∣ness and darkness? How have I with my

Alas! often have these accursed hands pil∣fered the scanty clothing of the poor, and with hellish boldness, robbed the treasures of the rich! Industry—honest, laudable in∣dustry, the faithful friend of the virtuous, had forsaken me: but covetousness, that fiend of hell, the companion of the thief and robber, dogged me continually at the heels. My soul! thou hadst well nigh perished—carried down the swiftly-flowing tide of impetuous and dishonest passions, or swallowed up in the whirlpool of unbe∣lief and evil company!

<P>Wretched man that I am!—who shall deliver me from the final condemnation,
<PB N="76" REF="023776_0041_0FC1243F2EFB6B88"/>which I dread, as the due reward of my deeds? Blessed be the Church, the Spouse of Christ, who in pity prays for me, "that I may take thy judgments patient∣ly, and repent me truly of my sins; that I, recovering thy favor, (O my GOD) the fearful reward of my actions may end with this life; and whensoever my soul shall depart from the body, it may be without spot presented unto thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord." O may this prayer be heard, and I trust it will, for the prayer of the righteous availeth much. But, is it, O my GOD, is it in wrath, or in mercy, that thou hast commissioned inexorable justice, to stop up the way before me, to shut me up in the dungeon, and appoint me an ignominious death on a gallows? With tears of the most heart-rending pen∣itence, I deplore—that I have despised the light, the light of life, and now the Sun in the heavens disdains to shine upon me. Yet, my soul, because the mercy of my GOD is over all his works, I will hope he hath done all these things to me in mercy. I will hope he hath not cast me off for ever, but by sending his servants the com∣missioned executioners of temporal justice,
<PB N="77" REF="023776_0041_0FC1243F2EFB6B88"/>from time to time to call upon me with the loud thundering voice of the LAW, by <HI>imprisonments,</HI> by <HI>scourgings,</HI> and by various correcting dispensations, he intended that I should learn consideration, and ask my∣self, "ah! me, what have I done?" But alas! charmed to sleep in the lap of im∣penitence, by the deep and repeated draughts I had taken of the bewitching cup of vice, I turned away mine ear, and like the deaf adder, would listen to nothing short of the thunderings of legal condemna∣tion. Now do I feel, as if awaked out of a deep sleep; before, I was not myself— carried away captive both by evil compa∣ny, and an evil heart; depraved affections continually ordering me about the Devil's service! Wisely and justly, hast thou thus dealt by me, O offended Father! when gentler corrections were found ineffectual, in mercy hast thou been pleased to compel me, an infamous wretch, and abominable prodigal, "to come to myself."—"Come to myself"—I tremble—I stand amazed —Oh!—it is impossible for this heart to conceive how great my guilt has been!!! O how merciful has my heavenly Father been to me, that when I was so steeled in
<PB N="78" REF="023776_0042_0FC124451D4E9040"/>vice, as to be beyond the reach of gentler methods, even <HI>thus</HI> to arrest me, in my way to destruction, and draw me to him by a paternal but justifiable violence!—Had my GOD cast me quite out of his sight, as a mass of crimes and impenitency, no more to be the object of his care, and delivered me over to the powers of darkness, to whom, alas! I had entirely devoted myself, what must have been my final portion?—Think, O my soul, think seriously—had the plunge of an avenging <HI>sword,</HI> or the well-aimed <HI>ball</HI> sent me to eternity, with all my robberies, thefts, burglaries, lies, oaths, crimes, and evil words and deeds beyond number, hanging heavy upon my shoul∣ders—no time allowed for repentance—no power granted, not even so much as to pray "Lord have mercy upon me!"—O horrible! horrible! horrible!!!
