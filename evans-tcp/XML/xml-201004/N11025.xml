<HEAD>The PROPHECY of RUIN, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SHOULD e'er a Prince the British empire sway</L>
<L>(And I be doom'd by heav'n to see the day)</L>
<L>Who quite unmindful of that glorious state</L>
<L>To which he's rais'd, not by desert, but fate;</L>
<L>Should he be base, be cruel, and unjust,</L>
<L>False to his friends, unworthy of that great trust;</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="013975_0002_0F925A258B5FD5B0"/>
Should he, unmindful of the good that springs</L>
<L>From true royalty, and true partiot Kings;</L>
<L>By oppression (destroying like a flood)</L>
<L>Cause civil war, and fill the land with blood;</L>
<L>Should he rebel 'gainst freedom, law, and right,</L>
<L>And laugh at truths which honest men should write</L>
<L>With fair intent, write with no other view,</L>
<L>But to save him, and save their country too;</L>
<L>Such deeds as these would fire my soul with rage,</L>
<L>And make me, e'en against my safety, wage</L>
<L>War with vill'ny, and stamp the tyrants crimes,</L>
<L>That he might live and stink to after times,</L>
<L>Thrice happy now, when ev'ry blessing springs,</L>
<L>From George the third we boast the best of Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Curs'd be the wretch who would support a plan;</L>
<L>Which must destroy the natural rights of man;</L>
<L>Perish the wretch, who unconcern'd would see</L>
<L>The laws destroy'd, a falling monarchy;</L>
<L>I could not, I am of another breed,</L>
<L>I ne'er should tamely see my country bleed,</L>
<L>Nor crouch to him, to truth and justice dead,</L>
<L>Or fawning compliment an empty head;</L>
<L>Let subtle knaves, to candour less inclin'd,</L>
<L>Disguise the truth, I'd always speak my mind;</L>
<L>Perish the thought, the crime should ne'er be mine</L>
<L>To sacrifice at curst ambition's shrine,</L>
<L>The right to speak, and publicly display</L>
<L>In all it's hideous forms despotic sway;</L>
<L>I ne'er should understand those prudent rules,</L>
<L>Decorum call'd by parasites and fools;</L>
<L>Discretion too should with decorum fall,</L>
<L>I ne'er should be what rascals decent call;</L>
<L>Resentment should to injuries be shewn,</L>
<L>The people by the language too be known,</L>
<L>'Tis servile wretches who are decent thought,</L>
<L>Such as are sold, and those that would be bought:</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="013975_0003_0F925A2693AC77F0"/>
When freedom calls, none should from danger start,</L>
<L>But take a noble, a decisive part;</L>
<L>I'd in the cause of freedom firmly stand,</L>
<L>And dare the stroke, e'en of that tyrant's hand,</L>
<L>Confed'rate villains, and their pow'r defy,</L>
<L>Born free like my forefathers, I would die</L>
<L>In that great cause, which is the cause of all,</L>
<L>Or free I'd live, or glory should I fall:</L>
<L>While truth and justice did my lines support,</L>
<L>I'd fear no King, nor minion of that court;</L>
<L>Nor King, nor minister, should then escape,</L>
<L>But share alike the injur'd people's hate;</L>
<L>Tho' minions talk'd, and lawyers set about</L>
<L>To find the libel, and the author out:</L>
<L>Tho' one should stare, another rascal cry,</L>
<L>"'Tis treason all, the author ought to die."</L>
<L>I'd laugh at them, nor care what they could do,</L>
<L>In honest rhime, each villain would pursue,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should such a Prince succeed to England's throne,</L>
<L>Tho' born a Briton, they must blush to own;</L>
<L>Should he keep foes of freedom, and of law,</L>
<L>Such foes as keep true royalty in awe;</L>
<L>Pervert fair justice from her even course,</L>
<L>And know no law, except the law of force;</L>
<L>Should he keep such as these close to his breast,</L>
<L>(Striving the scepter from his hand to wrest)</L>
<L>Should he keep such, and of the Stuart race,</L>
<L>Who made this empire tremble to her base;</L>
<L>Should Scotsmen be prefer'd to Briton's brave,</L>
<L>And none but Scotsmen, or a Scotsman's slave,</L>
<L>Appear at court, and lord it o'er the land,</L>
<L>Keeping all pow'r from the sovereign hand;</L>
<L>Should he see only with a Scotsman's eyes,</L>
<L>Be taught to mock his injur'd Briton's cries;</L>
<L>Coop'd up at court (like sheep shut up in a pen)</L>
<L>Little to read, and less to know of men;</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="013975_0004_0F925A29D7105BA0"/>
To hear such men, as had no other ends</L>
<L>But to serve him, and be their country's friends,</L>
<L>Call'd disloyal, and rebels made appear,</L>
<L>By base born Scotsmen, always rebels here;</L>
<L>This to believe, believe it as his creed,</L>
<L>And through those traitors make all England bleed.</L>
<L>Coop'd up at court, and there be made a tool,</L>
<L>The greatest slave, as well as greatest fool;</L>
<L>Should England's crown be plac'd on such a head,</L>
<L>What mis'ry must the people then not dread?</L>
<L>Would they not curse the cause, the secret spring,</L>
<L>Whence all this dire oppression came, that King,</L>
<L>Would they not wish, the day which gave him birth</L>
<L>Had ne'er disgrac'd the records of the earth.</L>
<L>Would they not drag those traitors forth to view,</L>
<L>Who, foes to him, sought England's ruin too,</L>
<L>And make them answer for such horrid crimes,</L>
<L>Which all their race, as well as future times</L>
<L>Should strive to equal, or exceed in vain,</L>
<L>Crimes, that would leave a long, a lasting stain</L>
<L>Upon the land, worse than the Stuarts; who,</L>
<L>Born slaves, tried to make slaves of freemen too,</L>
<L>Who bound in chains both liberty and law,</L>
<L>Quite friendless then, but heaven sent Nassau;</L>
<L>He 'gainst slavery made a glorious stand,</L>
<L>And broke those chains, which had disgrac'd the land;</L>
<L>With tenfold terror hurl'd his vengeance down,</L>
<L>And drove a slave and tyrant from the crown,</L>
<L>Founded the throne in justice, truth, and right,</L>
<L>And rescu'd freedom from the shades of night,</L>
<L>Drove superstition, with her bigot crew,</L>
<L>Far from this land (James he run with her too)</L>
<L>Drove persecution to her seat in Rome,</L>
<L>While tyrants wept at slav'ry's bloody toomb;</L>
<L><PB N="93" REF="013975_0005_0F925A2BD4520E90"/>
Restor'd to Britain all the rights of man,</L>
<L>First fixed by heaven, on wisdom's sacred plan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such deeds as theirs wou'd fire my soul with rage,</L>
<L>And make me e'en, against my safety wage</L>

<L>And burl's down vengeance on each guilty head;</L>
<L>Bids England's arms pull lawless power down,</L>
<L>And with her conquests shake each tyrant's crown:</L>
<L>Should he succeed, when England rais'd above</L>
<L>All former times, and wisdom join'd with love,</L>
<L>In council sits, makes paltry factions cease,</L>
<L>And tho' at war, yet all at home is peace;</L>

<L>And by her pow'r, can give the other law;</L>
<L>When each new day crowns Britons with success,</L>

Calls forth resentment from the British throne,</L>
<L>To make her vengeance, and her power known;</L>
<L>Should he succeed, and roll supine in state,</L>
<L>And leave her glory and renown to fate,</L>
<L>Would be a crime that heav'n could not forgive,</L>
<L>To blast his name, and make his memory live;</L>
<L>Live with recorded villains to that day,</L>
<L>When time shall cease, and all the world decay;</L>
<L>Should he to make this crime still worse appear,</L>
<L>Turn out a minister to England dear,</L>
<L>Who'd rais'd his country, from a sinking state,</L>
<L>By wisdom only, not by chance or fate,</L>
<L>To power and strength, not known in days of yore,</L>
<L>Known only then, and to be known no more;</L>
<L>At his command, like that great patriot Pitt,</L>
<L>Makes France to yield, and Spain, tho' proud, sub∣mit;</L>
<L>Makes British valour, with just vengeance hurl'd,</L>
<L>Strike terror through each nation of the world;</L>
<L>Should he be (through a Scotsman's base design)</L>

<L>And that same Scotsman of the Stuart race,</L>
<L>Mount in his seat, the nation's foul disgrace,</L>
<L>False to his King, give up those conquests won,</L>
<L>And fix in strength, both France and Spain undone;</L>
<L>Should he make war, defensive war to cease,</L>
<L>On terms inglorious, by a shameful peace,</L>
<L>A peace which must from foul corruption spring,</L>
<L>Thro' that base Scotsman, but still baser King;</L>
<L>Dead to all sense of England's future good,</L>
<L>To sacrifice her treasure, and her blood.</L>

<L>Of King, let rebel Scotsmen steer the helm</L>
<L>Of State, and sow fell discord in the realm,</L>
<L>Make tax on tax (while England curst with peace)</L>
<L>Each year arise, each year to say increase;</L>

<L>While ruin did with double horror rise;</L>

Thus to stand forth, and only with this view,</L>

<L>To set our churches, and the town on fire;</L>
<L>The pious King, at pious priest's command,</L>
<L>May make crusado's to the Holy-Land,</L>
<L>Thro' dangerous seas, to find the blessed spring</L>
<L>Of holy water, to which the Pope shall bring</L>
<L>Him safe, purge, absolve him from his crimes,</L>
<L>As Popes absolv'd our Kings in former times,</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="013975_0014_0F925A3B419A3F70"/>
And made them devils on the British throne</L>
<L>They reign'd in blood, and hell was all their own.</L>
<L>And Bishops then e'en Satan shall out vie,</L>
<L>To please that King will give their God the lie,</L>
<L>But still they'll have a sure and certain hope,</L>
<L>And find at last a Saviour in the Pope,</L>
<L>And no distinction could a Scotsman bring</L>
<L>'Twixt Devil, Bishops, Pope, and such a King;</L>
<L>So far alike (none should disbelieve)</L>
<L>Their aim the same to ruin and deceive,</L>
<L>By oaths nor conscience neither would be bound,</L>
<L>Could worse on earth, or worse in hell be found.</L>

<LG>
<L>Such deeds as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese would fire my soul with rage,</L>
<L>And make me, e'en against my safety, wage</L>
<L>War with vill'ny, and stamp their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rsed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rimes,</L>
<L>That each might live and stink to after times;</L>
<L>Would make me call forth ancient British <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age,</L>
<L>To just revenge, or mark the coward age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice happy now, when every blessing springs</L>
<L>From George the Third, we boast the best of Kings.</L>
<L>Through that dark gloom one comfort shall appear,</L>
<L>And all the world own I'm a prophet here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Altho' like crimes of old in Sodom's land</L>
<L>Those might draw vengeance from God's righteous hand,</L>
<L>Yet for time, the authors shall not bleed,</L>
<L>Thro' one just man, who then shall greatly plead;</L>
<L>One Bishop shall be found, and only one,</L>
<L>Then true to man, to God, and Christ his son,</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="013975_0015_0F925A3C887A16F8"/>
There shall be one, Asaph that one shall sing,</L>
<L>Just to his God, his country and his King.</L>
<L>Should that dread time to England e'er be known,</L>
<L>When such a monarch sits upon the throne,</L>
<L>Her senate brib'd, and only kept for sport,</L>
<L>To aid the bloody measures of a court,</L>
<L>Should that e'er be, a few brave virtuous men,</L>
<L>(A Chatham, Burke, a Glynn, may be again)</L>
<L>May try, with truth and justice on their side,</L>
<L>To stem the torrent of corruption's tide;</L>
<L>Like virtuous Romans they may firmly stand,</L>
<L>With some few more, to save a falling land;</L>
<L>May bravely struggle in their country's cause,</L>
<L>And nobly try to save her charter'd laws;</L>
<L>But try in vain, truth shall not find support,</L>
<L>From rascals brib'd, and by a rotten court;</L>
<L>Should honor rise, by justice call'd to tell</L>
<L>How England bled, and how the Romans fell;</L>
<L>Should virtue honor join, at heaven's call,</L>
<L>To shew that Britons must like Romans fall;</L>
<L>Should they, base villainy drag forth to light,</L>
<L>St. Stephen's troops shall then prepare to fight;</L>
<L>And legions arm, 'gainst truth and virtue's laws,</L>
<L>Will there defend the blackest villain's cause;</L>
<L>And honor, justice, truth, and virtue meet</L>
<L>This fate, shall victims fall at power's feet.</L>
<L>Dread evils th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> yet they will surely spring</L>
<L>From Lords and Commons, join'd with such a King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, at freedom's glorious call,</L>
<L>Britons must strike, and make those traitors fall,</L>
<L>A deed which would by ages be admir'd,</L>
<L>A day kept holy, when their souls expir'd;</L>
<L>Then would happier days to Albion be restor'd,</L>
<L>By ancient justice, with her patriot sword.</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="013975_0016_0F925A3CBA4878A0"/>
In such a time would revolution stand</L>
<L>Each Briton's boast, the glory of the land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But should that time to England once be known,</L>
<L>When foul corruption stinks upon the throne,</L>
<L>And she has Popish Bishops of her own,</L>
<L>When each other the three estates shall join,</L>
<L>By force or fraud, the state to undermine;</L>
<L>When Britons do, and with inglorious ease,</L>
<L>Submit to wrongs, such cursed wrongs as these;</L>
<L>When that shall be (quite dead to heaven's call)</L>
<L>The British empire must in ruins fall.</L>
