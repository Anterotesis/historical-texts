<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME may ask, why I have not taken notice, in the following pamphlet, of Porcupine's life? to which I would answer, that this pamphlet was written and ready for the press before he published his life; and as he has brought forward no fact or argument to induce me to change my belief, but rather to confirm it, with respect to his being "a hireling writer;" I declined altering it, or taking any notice of his life. But if I have occa∣sion to write another pamphlet, "out of his own mouth will I condemn him;" and prove to the world, whatever his supporters may think of him, that it is true what the Reviewers have said of his writings, that "they are a dishonor to any party." And more I will prove, that he and his party had supported their measures by falsehood, and misrepresenta∣tion; in proof of this I will recur to one fact only, on the present occa∣sion. It is a well known circumstance that all the writers, in support of the treaty, from Philadelphia on to the eastward, raised the "hue and cry" among the farmers, that if they would not turn out and petition in support of the treaty, it would be rejected; and the consequence finally would be, that their grain would become a mere drug, they would find no mar∣ket for it; and it would lie, and rot on their hands. But when the trea∣ty was adopted to their entire satisfaction, and time brought round things in their natural order; what was the consequence that actually took place, which we have heard, which we have seen; and which is known to every farmer from one end of the union to the other. Then I will tell you Mr. Fenno, pshaw! its nothing more than about six, or seven weeks after the treaty was finally ratified; wheat and flour fell in New-York, and many other towns, to nearly one half less than it was previous to the adopting of the treaty; what think you of the treaty now Johnney? go blush ye fabricators! Ye false story-tellers! and hide your heads a∣mong the pumpkin vines of Connecticut, and Massachusetts; and amuse your countrymen by fabricating marvellous stories. Go tell them! that one of Mr. Ames's constituents had a large turkey cock, that hatched a dozen of eggs in consequence of the treaty's being ratified; and that the clouds poured forth showers of fish, upon the plantation of one of Mr. Buck's constituents. Go tell them! that the cats would not kitten, nei∣ther the yews bring forth their young, nor their young men bundle with the bonny lasses, unless the treaty would be adopted. Go ye fabulators! and sing hosannas to the Lord, and tell your countrymen, that even the mules of Connecticut have become prolific since the treaty was ratified.</P>
<P>"But Porcupine abuses all men!" exclaimed a republican, to a well known aristocrat with whom I was conversing the other day; "you are mistaken, replied the gentle aristocrat, he has in the history of his life paid Mr. Carey a very handsome compliment;" and so the matter ended between them. But in order to satisfy my own curiosity, I went and purchased the history of his life; and to my great surprise I found the compliment to be precisely this, that Mr. Carey had acted with respect to Porcupine, in concealing his person from the public, as a man of honor; and Porcupine simply relates the cricumstance, but with evident reluct∣ance;
<PB N="iv" REF="030155_0003_0FE4B03FE4B80A28"/>
now where is the compliment? If Porcupine by saying it was an act of honor in Mr. Carey to conceal his person, had made it become so, as the edict of kings has often attached honor, or dishonor to an action; then, and not until then would he have paid Mr. Carey a compliment. For the action was itself an honorable one, and the opinion of Porcupine, or any other individual will neither make it more nor less so. If every man who performs an honorable action must be under a compliment to ano∣ther, it establishes at once a check upon every virtuous proceeding; and we are in future to look for honour and virtue, only among slaves and cowards; where we have the least prospect of finding them. He com∣plains that Mr. Carey treated him with a certain degree of contempt, on his first interview with him; and wishes for another yellow fever, that he might also acquire a fortune. The insinuation here conveyed is ob∣vious, that is, that Mr. Carey has become elate with prosperity. I have conversed with him both before and since the yellow fever, and have ne∣ver discovered any change in his conduct; and am persuaded an hundred others in town will say the same thing. He has underwent a change it is true, but it is a change of a different nature from what Porcupine insinu∣ates; it is the change of care into contentment on finding his industry rewarded; it is a change which every man, under the same circumstan∣ces, must feel, who lives among "a people where riches fix the only consideration," where men are esteemed and caressed only in proportion to their wealth.—An artful sentiment indeed, that riches ought to fix the only consideration, for <HI>our modern fine gentlemen of yesterday</HI> to introduce to obtain respect, whose merit is commensurate with their riches; and whose genius or abilities is below the notice of mankind; for deprive them of their wealth and you rob them of the only merit they possess. Were they elswhere, but by their own fire sides — were they elsewhere, but in Phila∣delphia, they would find to their eternal shame, that something more than riches would be necessary, to render them respectable in the opinion of o∣thers. Had Mr. Carey, like Mr. Y—, when he acquired a fortune, plumed himself in a bob-tailed coat, with the collar hanging half way down his back, and bedaubed with powder; had he, like him, purchased a country house, and drive in his carriage every morning behind his coun∣ter, with a tippee cane in his hand; would he, like him, when a poor man comes into his shop, to purchase a pamphlet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up his nose as if he felt an offensive smell; and answer him, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eering grin, some mi∣nutes after the poor man had asked him for it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he had no such pamphlet;" then might it be insinuated indeed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Carey had become elate with prosperity.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION.</HEAD>
<P>HAD a writer, who stiles himself Porcupine, taken the advice of Doctor Swift, when he published his two first pieces; he might have passed on the world as a humorous facetious writer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a <HI>brain</HI> that will endure but one <HI>scumming;</HI> let the owner gather it with discretion, and manage his little stock with husbandry. But of all things let him beware of bringing it under the <HI>lash</HI> of his <HI>betters;</HI> because that will make it all bubble up into impertinence, and he will find no new supply: Wit without knowledge being a sort of <HI>cream,</HI> which ga∣thers in a night to the top, and by a skilful hand may be soon <HI>whipt</HI> into <HI>froth;</HI> but once scummed away, what appears underneath, will be fit for nothing, but to be thrown to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogs.</NOTE> The citizens being unaccustomed to receive such pieces, from the press of an Ame∣rican printer, their novelty procured them a general circulation; whilst the ridicule they contained served to indulge a spirit of party spleen: by exciting mirth at the expence of o∣thers. For most men may be laughed out of their money, but there are few who can be rea∣soned out of it. The rapid sale of his two first pieces ensured him success, with the party whose cause he had espoused; and a foreign agent, finding to what advantage his turn for ridicule might be employed, to support the de∣tested cause of a British faction, has conse∣quently paid him several visits; this has been some time ago made known to the public, and is now generally believed. What a cabal was
<PB N="6" REF="030155_0005_0FE4B042F628C2E8"/>
raised against citizen Genet, three years ago, because a certain party had asserted, that he interfered in the internal government of our country. Admitting he did interfere, was he more culpable than the other, who does it by means of an hireling. Surely his being a na∣tive of this city, and a tory; nay were he the royal ass himself, it would never justify him in the opinion of those, who regard the internal peace and happiness of their country. Had Porcupine confined himself to translations from the French, and giving instructions in that language, to those who thought proper to em∣ploy him; he would not have drawn upon him∣self the just indignation of a whole people; for those insults and gross epithets, with which he has vilified them. Nor would we have seen him under the contemptible alternative of forg∣ing a letter;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his Scare-Crow.</NOTE> wherein he censures himself for his gross calumny; that he might, by that mean, afford himself an opportunity of vindicating his conduct, and apologising for those insults he has given to the American citizens. He has now opened a book-store, through the bounty of this <HI>pious</HI> agent, and his interest tells him, he ought, to conciliate the affection and con∣fidence of all parties. For it is asserted, by some, that his employer having now gained his point; and having discovered by his last pieces, that the fountain has nearly ran dry, and an eter∣nal drought must succeed; he has consequent∣ly withdrawn his golden auspices, and thrown
<PB N="7" REF="030155_0006_0FE4B046EA172580"/>
Porcupine on the mercy of an offended people. But a momentary contrition will not palliate for mob, banditti, &amp;c. with which he has so often vilified the peaceable citizens of the Uni∣ted States; cut-throats and murderers, with which he has abused their friends the French; thieves and robbers, with which he has calum∣niated the Irish; who contributed so largely, in the late revolution, to humble the blustering pride of Britain. How far the different parties, whom he accuses, are deserving of his calum∣ny and slander, we need have recurrence but to a few facts, and arguments, to discover. There has not been, in my remembrance, a col∣lection of the inhabitants, in this city, since after the establishment of peace in eighty-three; who shewed the least disposition to riot, or act in open defiance of the laws of the state, or of humanity and decorum; except one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was this mob, or a party of it, that dragged from their lodgings, to the Assembly-room, the members in the minority of the state legislature, who had withdrawn on taking the question, "Shall the federal constitution be now adopted," and compelled them to make a quorum, that the house might proceed to take the vote.</NOTE> on the a∣doption of the federal constitution, when some of Porcupine's present friends—the old tories of '76—the very scum of society, assembled together, and were headed by a certain gentle∣man; who led them (it was after night) to a re∣spectable clergyman's house in this city; who was a known friend to the revolution, and in∣sulted him and his family, with every mark of indignity. The next day it was affirmed, by an eye-witness, that this same gentleman, who
<PB N="8" REF="030155_0007_0FE4B04B8ED50328"/>
headed the mob, went upon his hands and feet, at the clergyman's door; and <HI>bow-wowed</HI> in imitation of one of his domestic animals, in hopes of gaining admission The odium of a bankruptcy, and a derangement of his pecuni∣ary circumstances, still pressing heavily upon his shoulders; he cunningly took this method to recommend himself to a certain party, who have always had the banks, the principal source of wealth, under their direction. He succeed∣ed in his scheme, and his son now drives, in state, to his compting-house.</P>
<P>The next mob that appeared was during the time of the embargo; when a party of Bri∣tish sailors assembled, and paraded through the streets, in a haughty manner. They marched up behind congress-hall where the members were sitting; and became noisy and clamor∣ous, in such a degree, that one of Porcupine's party, not knowing it was his friends who had assembled there, got greatly alarmed, started from his seat, and made a motion for the ad∣journment of Congress, to some other place.</P>
<P>The last collection of people, who had the least appearance of a mob, shewed themselves at the close of the town meeting, in the State-House yard, last summer; when some boys, to the number, perhaps, of two hundred; a∣mong whom were several sailors, who wisely foresaw, that the treaty would afford them no protection, against the inhumanity and savage cruelty of the British; paraded through some of the streets, burnt the treaty in effigy, and
<PB N="9" REF="030155_0008_0FE4B04D15A32F40"/>
proceeded to the house of a certain senator, and broke a single pane of glass, in one of his windows; without shewing any other mark of a riotous disposition. And it is more than pro∣bable, that even that solitary pane would not have been broken, had not a well known Vis∣count, who was riding forward in company with the proprietor of the house, the folly and presumption, to get upon one of the gentle∣man's coach-horses, and attempted to ride down the boys; in order to ingratiate himself, no doubt, into the esteem of the senator and his family. Such a wild, and extravagant attempt of a sorry individual like him, who was, and is himself detested by the people, was sufficient to excite them, to that single act, of outrage—and it did so. As soon as they discovered, that it was the noble Viscount, who was on horseback; some one of the mob, who accidentally had a stump of an old fish∣ing rod, or a small pole, in his hand, ran up to our modern Don Quixote, and gave him a blow across his shoulders; which so cooled his courage, that he scampered off <HI>Sans ceremonie.</HI> If I have in the above narrative of facts mista∣ted any circumstance, I am willing to be cor∣rected; but, I believe, there are too many living witnesses in this city, to day, that will bear testimony of the truth of what I have here related, with respect to mobs. And I am convinced, that upon a candid examination and enquiry, mobs will be as rarely met with, in other parts of the union, as in Philadelphia;
<PB N="10" REF="030155_0009_0FE4B04F9BB1A920"/>
so that Porcupine, instead of casting an odium on the friends of Republicanism, has called forth an examination of facts, which recoil with dishonour upon the very heads of his supporters.</P>
<P>With regard to the murders and outrages committed by the French nation; there are none who will believe a single fact stated by Porcu∣pine, except credulous children, or prejudiced old women sinking into their dotage. To be∣lieve that a nation so enlightened as the French, "and always, says Mr. Bruce, foremost in the acts of benevolence and humanity," would tie men and women in pairs, and drown them by tens, and by fifties; nay even sink boat loads of them, and thus wantonly sport with the lives of their fellow creatures, as Porcupine asserts, is what no man in his senses can ever believe. For calumny herself blushes at the exaggera∣tion—humanity treats it as an insult—rea∣son and truth spurn the daring imposition —whilst poor credulity is upon the rack. The implacable hatred, which Englishmen are known to entertain towards the French nation, ought to put every prudent man upon his guard; before he gives his assent, to all those Porcu∣pine accounts of "horrid massacres;" a man who is a declared enemy to the French revolu∣tion, and the liberties of mankind in general. What confidence can we place in the veracity of a man, who would sit down and deliberate∣ly tell the world, as Porcupine did, that there were two hundred gaming-tables kept in this
<PB N="11" REF="030155_0010_0FE4B05644F86A48"/>
city by Frenchmen?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I am rightly informed, Porcupine will find, that one of his own countrymen kept the principal gambling table in town.</NOTE> John Fenno himself, who is not very remarkable for his modesty, when an opportunity offers of abusing the French nation, allows there were but about twenty; before they were expelled by the magistracy. By this false assertion, he endeavoured to cast a dishonourable reflection on the republican par∣ty; but gamblers were never known to be the friends of a republican government. Those French are well known to be men of aristocra∣tic principles, the associates of Porcupine; who were expelled France, and the West-India Islands for attempting to subvert the liberties of the people; and having no means of sup∣porting themselves they had recourse to gam∣bling. They are now banished, and it is to be lamented, the corporation had not taken earlier steps to have them punished; before their vil∣lainy produced those evils it did. Exaggerat∣ing their own prowess, and calumniating their enemies, are tricks, which the British govern∣ment have been always known to practise, up∣on their poor deluded subjects. He must be very little acquainted with the British accounts of the American revolution, who does not ac∣knowledge the truth of what is here advanced. For every battle they gained was magnified in∣to a victory; and the American character was degraded, by them, to a level with the uncivil∣ized Indian of the woods. With the Hessians, in particular, they were solicitous in represent∣ing
<PB N="12" REF="030155_0011_0FE4B057CE00FDD0"/>
the Americans, as a cruel, vindictive, and savage people; in order to rouse them to com∣mit acts of wanton barbarity. And I have the authority of an English gentleman in saying, that these impressions are not yet entirely worn off his countrymen. Many people in England, who live remote from the seaports and have but little means of information, believing to this day, that the citizens of the United States, are scarcely a degree removed above unciviliza∣tion; and he assigned this as a reason, why so few of the farmers, and labouring poor, emi∣grate to this country.</P>
<P>That the French have gullotined, every man who was brought before their tribunals of ju∣stice, is no evidence of their cruelty and inju∣stice; but is the fullest proof of their lenity and forbearance; because it was not until after their crimes became so notorious, that even the slightest doubt could not be entertained of their criminality, that they were brought before their tribunals; when the united voice of the people, and the preservation of the republic, required their execution. Their condemnation was the result of irresistible necessity, and not of choice, or wanton barbarity. The Repub∣licans were forced into those sanguinary mea∣sures, by the stupid obstinacy of the royalists —an obstinacy which nothing could conquer but death.</P>
<P>That the accounts of massacres, in France, published by Porcupine, Fenno, and Webster; are often false and exaggerated, I can testify
<PB N="13" REF="030155_0012_0FE4B05956943A48"/>
upon the authority of some French citizens; men of education and principle, residing here. These gentlemen have frequently read, in the public papers, of persons being gullotined, who were actually living when they received their last accounts from France; and which was many months subsequent to the time, wherein it was said, that those persons were executed. No doubt there have been many gullotined, in the course of the revolution; but when the clouds of prejudice are dissipated, and an im∣partial investigation of all the facts, and cir∣cumstances, take place, relating to those who suffered under these sanguinary measures; I am persuaded, there will be but a small num∣ber found amongst them, of the innocent and unoffending.</P>
<P>Although there be no principle of candour, truth and honour, which Porcupine has not violated, in his abuse of the French nation; yet he is not alone censurable, for Mr. Hamil∣ton has trodden the path before him. The lat∣ter, in his writings, has endeavoured to prove, that it was not from disinterested motives, France took an active part in the American revolution; but to pull down the enormous and overbearing pride, of England. Admitting this was the motive, which made France de∣clare war against that power, this all men must acknowledge, that if their motives in serving us were not so pure, as Mr. Hamilton wishes, they certainly loved us more than Great Bri∣tain did; and if they loved us more, ought not
<PB N="14" REF="030155_0013_0FE4B05BDFEC1A98"/>
our gratitude to be in proportion to that love, in preference to Britain, as theirs was in pre∣ference to us. Why then reject their overtures for entering into a treaty, both friendly and advantageous; and meanly crouching solicit England to grant us one, which is equally in∣jurious to our interest, as degrading to our na∣tional dignity and honour? Although I believe universal benevolence and disinterested friend∣ship, are found amongst mankind, in their pri∣vate individual capacity; yet I could never learn from history, that they were ever found amongst monarchies. I am persuaded Mr Ha∣milton cannot produce, from history, one in∣stance of monarchies, whether ancient or mo∣dern, being actuated towards each other; with that cordial attachment, as has been known to exist between Republics. What have we then to expect from our union with England? Has not experience already convinced us, that when her interest is concerned, every principle of justice, of humanity, and the law of nations, are violated by her in their turn; to gratify her rapacious, haughty, and overbearing spirit. To illustrate what has here been said, with re∣gard to the disinterestedness of monarchies, let us take a general view of the kingdoms in Eu∣rope, for a few years back. England, in the last Turkish and Russian wars, assisted the Turks privately, against the Russians; she has since the commencement of the present revolution, entered into a triple alliance, with the Austri∣ans, and Russians, against the Turks. In the
<PB N="15" REF="030155_0014_0FE4B063866ACAB0"/>
American revolution, Spain assisted France a∣gainst England, and in the present revolution she assisted England against France; and it is universally believed, if a general peace does not soon take place, she will join the French against the English. England has sought several times for, and against, the Hollanders. Behold the haughty contemptible Victor Amadeus, king of Sardinia; who, not many months ago, swore eternal enmity to the French republicans, late∣ly upon his knees before the Executive Direc∣tory, the very same republicans, like a disobe∣dient snivling school-boy, asking pardon for his former transgressions; and declaring, with the same lying tongue, with which he cursed them, that if they will pardon him his folly and presumption, he will, in future, be to them a faithful ally. It is more than probable the next account we receive from Europe, of this bigotted old monarch, is that he is marching the shattered remains of his army against the English and Austrians. Was it not, three years ago, equally as improbable, in the opinion of all Europe, that the king of Sardinia would ask pardon of the National Directory, for his pre∣sumption and folly; as that the idiot George the third, would three years hence, be upon his bended knees, begging of the National Di∣rectory, in the same humiliating voice, forgive∣ness of his transgressions? National pride, am∣bition, folly, and interest, are the governing, and only motives, which actuate kings towards each other; and which give rise to all this ver∣satility
<PB N="16" REF="030155_0015_0FE4B06511754CA0"/>
of conduct: For no man of common sense surely will say, it was the effect of dis∣interested friendship.</P>
<P>But France, more enlightened and magnani∣mous than all the rest, gave America early proofs of her friendship; by entering into a treaty of amity and commerce, in the most pe∣rilous times, involving herself in a general war, at the hazard of loosing some of her most valuable possessions. And to convince Ameri∣ca, and the world, more fully; that her form∣er services were not the effect of a temporary, sordid, selfish interest; she has since made over∣tures for entering into a treaty anew; on prin∣ciples the most honourable, and flattering, to the national dignity of America, and advanta∣geous to her interests. But Mr. Hamilton, "stiff in opinion always in the wrong," by his influence in the cabinet council of America, defeated her friendly designs; and rendered all her overtures abortive. Let us now admit, that France took an active part in the late re∣volution from interested motives; for we ad∣mit it only, because Messrs. Hamilton and Smith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">S. Carolina.</NOTE> with all their contemptible quibbles, will never be able to prove it; until they con∣vince the understandings of men, that France would have gone to war with England, at that period, independent of the solicitations of A∣merica. It is a fact, known to the whole world, that America solicited the friendship and assist∣ance of France, and that she granted their re∣quest;
<PB N="17" REF="030155_0016_0FE4B0669D023560"/>
which was beyond all controversy an act of friendship, if there be any such thing as friendship in this world. Hence it follows, from what we have admitted, that France was actuated by two motives, that is, a friendship for America, and a personal interest she had in checking the domineering pride, and arrogance of England. This personal interest, and the independence of America, which was the na∣tural consequence of such a check, were the only objects the two countries had in view. In accomplishing these, France being governed by two motives, it is certain, she would act with a vigor proportioned to the force of those motives—she did so; and American independ∣ence was secured. Let me now ask the ex-se∣cretary and his coadjutor, was there no friend∣ship in her sending her armies, and her fleets, to fight our battles, both by sea and land?—was there no friendship in her furnishing our ar∣mies, and our privateers, with ammunition, and arms; the only necessary means of defence? —was there no friendship in her opening her ports, for the sale of the prizes captured by our privateers?—was there no friendship in her supplying our naked and defenceless citizens, with her manufactures, the absolute necessaries of life—and was there no friend in her opening her treasury, and lending us five million of dollars: were all these nothing? Speak thou demons of ingratitude and answer me.</P>
<P>Much has been said, by Mr. Hamilton in∣directly, in his writings, against the French,
<PB N="18" REF="030155_0017_0FE4B0691E44DEF0"/>
about motives. The doctrine of motives is perhaps one of the most obscure, and ambigu∣ous, in nature. For an individual to attempt to pry into the feelings of mens heart's, in or∣der to discover the secret springs of actions which may there operate, is at once absurd, and presumptuous; it belongs to omniscience only to view the motives, and secret springs of action with men; and consider them accor∣dingly. If I solicit a favour of my neighbour, and he grants my request; I want no more to complete my happiness, so far as the supply of a single want will render me happy. I am not to enquire, whether his motive in serving me, was disinterested, or not; admitting it was, in this case, it is an imaginary good only; for be∣fore we can pretend to discover what men's mo∣tives are, the action must either be resolved up∣on, or performed. It is not by motives we live, but by actions; and considering or judging of men's motives subsequent to their actions, will never feed the hungry, nor clothe the naked. If my neighbour renders me a service, it is the most certain proof which I could receive from him, that he entertains no hatred toward me; and if he entertains no hatred towards me, but renders me an essential service, what is he? is he not my friend? if he be not, I know not who is; I am apprehensive I will not find one in Mr. Ha∣milton. Actions are to motives, what light is to the sun, were it not for them we could have no idea of men's motives, no more than we could have an idea of the sun, were it not for his
<PB N="19" REF="030155_0018_0FE4B06E294CCCB8"/>
light. Now to suppose the sun an impure and opaque body, because he diffuses light, is not a greater absurdity, than to suppose a man who is capable of friendship and of perform∣ing a friendly action; is governed by base and selfish motives. If by serving my friend, I serve myself at the same time, am I to be cen∣sured as a selfish interested man, Mr. Ha∣milton says yes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Mr. Hamilton does not expressly say so, his writings admit no o∣ther deduction.</NOTE> but I answer the con∣trary, for if he, in consequence of that cir∣cumstance, rejects my friendship, I will then consider him as the surly dog—would neither suffer me to do myself a kindness, nor would he receive one of my hands, because I was in∣directly serving myself. Is he not the selfish man, who would allow himself only to receive the good I would do? nay, is he not something worse than a selfish man, who would deprive himself of that good, that he might also de∣prive his benefactor, from rendering himself alike service. A virtuous man will always re∣joice, when he finds a two fold good resulting from an action; but according to Mr. Hamil∣ton's reasoning, because a two fold good arose from the service of the French, during the late revolution; that is, they procured the inde∣pendence of America; whilst they added to their own consequence, in the balance of the European powers, we ought to treat them as a selfish interested nation. I repeat again, that a virtuous man will always rejoice, when
<PB N="20" REF="030155_0019_0FE4B070F5F0E620"/>
he finds a two fold good resulting from an ac∣tion; but Mr. Hamilton and his coadjutor, snarl at it, and call the French a selfish, wheed∣ling, and interested people. That a man of Mr. Hamilton's abilities, would advance such preposterous arguments, as he so frequently does, in his writings, is to me the greatest a∣stonishment in life. For this singularity in him, I can find no better solution, than the ob∣servation of Mr. Duncan; speaking, in his in∣troduction to his logic, of the happy talent some men possess of unravelling, and throw∣ing light upon, the most intricate subjects; "others, says he, confound the easiest specu∣lations, their understandings seem to be form∣ed awry, &amp;c." From what has been here ad∣vanced upon the doctrine of motives, I am con∣vinced every candid thinking man will ac∣knowledge, that the conduct of the French nation towards America, during her strug∣gles for liberty, was highly honorable and friendly, and worthy of a magnanimous na∣tion: or admitting she was interested, a two∣fold good resulted to the world from her con∣duct, during that period; and therefore ought not to lessen, but doubly encrease, our grati∣tude and esteem. How unanimous were the citizens, six years ago, in declaring their stea∣dy and unfeigned attachment to that nation; they would have continued in these senti∣ments, had not Mr. Hamilton, like a mushroom of yesterday, started up and poisoned their minds, by endeavouring to impress them with
<PB N="21" REF="030155_0020_0FE3F820EC2D3440"/>
the belief, that gratitude to the French nation was repugnant to their interest; this was the mean by which he collected all the men of sordid principles in the union, and several la∣dies, around him; they became his steady friends, and the open avowed enemies of France. For there is no tie of gratitude, no principle of honour and virtue, which avari∣cious men will not sacrifice, to accomplish their sordid views. It is asserted, upon good authority, that Mrs. Maginnis was among the number of those ladies, which Mr. Hamilton let into the secrets of the funding system; whether this particular kindness to her, was owing to her steady attention to him, in fur∣nishing him always with a clean room, and a fresh pullet; when he went to sup with her, is of no consequence to the public. It is howe∣ver well known, to all the gentlemen of the quill, at the different banks, that she speculat∣ed largely; and has been enabled by her spe∣culations, and the bounty of her visitors, to re∣tire on the fruits of her labour. Having since purchased a snug house, a coach, a footman in genteel livery; she now drives about the city in great splendor, the warmest advocate of Mr. Hamilton's measures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What a glorious proof, it is, of the purity of Mr. Hamilton's admi∣nistration, when all the whores and russians, from New-Hampshire to Georgia, are become his advocates.

of gentlemen. What Doctor Charles Davenant said of a party that existed in England in his time, may be also said, with great truth, of those friends of Mr. Hamilton, whom avarice collected around him; "an ignorant, says he, mercenary, and servile crew; unanimous in evil; diligent in mischief, variable in princi∣ples, constant to flattery, talkers for liberty; but slaves to power," stiling themselves fe∣deralists, and the President's only friends. From the influence Mr. Hamilton's writings has had, in giving a tinge to the American character, I am convinced it will render them the contempt, and scorn, of Europe. Have we not daily striking proofs of my assertion? have not the American citizens been treated with coldness by the French?—have they not been vexed, harrassed, and buffetted by the English? —and have not the Algerines, one of the weak∣est and most contemptible powers in that part of the globe, compelled us to purchase a trea∣ty, at the enormous sum of twelve hundred thousand dollars?</P>
<P>When we turn aside from viewing his con∣duct towards the French—the manner in which it has influenced the public sentiment, to that nation; the only one from whom America could expect to receive real acts of friendship; and view his conduct with regard to the Uni∣ted States internally, I am apprehensive, we will find as little cause of approbation and pa∣nygeric. Let us therefore take a general view of his conduct, from the meeting of the feder∣al
<PB N="23" REF="030155_0022_0FE4B07C8E172998"/>
convention. In that enlightened body of patriots, for patriots they were, in comparison to Mr Hamilton, we find him making a mo∣tion for the establishment of a monarchial go∣vernment; and when he failed, in his attempts, to get such a form introduced into the United States, he got offended, like a capricious silly girl; and left the convention in a pout;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is generally understood, that when attached to the President's household, in the late revolution, he left it also in a pout; and that he is very much addicted to those little girlish poutings; for shame colonel Ha∣milton, once the great Financier General of America!</NOTE> for all his fine oratory was lost in a breath of air. How mortifying, must it have been, to a man of his ambitious views and nice feelings to be thus early discomfited, in his political career; and in an object too wherein he seemed so warmly interested. However, he meditated re∣venge, and he sought for it. On finding the constitution admitted great latitude of con∣structive power, he returned to the convention and signed the constitution; but with strong marks of disapprobation, declaring that he sign∣ed it only in consequence of its ambiguity, in defining the powers of the different branches of government. The constitution being now pub∣lished, and soon becoming popular; from the confidence the citizens placed in General Wash∣ington, Doctor Franklin, and some others; Mr. Hamilton had no alternative, to preserve his popularity with the leading party, but to join, in conjunction with Mr. Madison,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was not, until some time after, that the public were let into the secret, that Mr. Madison was concerned in writing the Federalist: But Mr. Hamilton is not the only one who founded a reputation upon the merits of a modest man.</NOTE> and write
<PB N="24" REF="030155_0023_0FE4B07E3929B678"/>
in support of it. Having thus established his reputation, as a man of abilities, and a warm federalist, amongst the real friends of the con∣stitution; and possessing an insinuating manner of address, it procured him many friends; who were active in promoting his advancement, to the head of the treasury department, on the or∣ganization of the constitution. It was now, that he had the fullest opportunity of indulg∣ing that revenge, which he meditated on sign∣ing the constitution; by insulting the good sense of the citizens. No sooner was he fixed in his office, than he endeavoured to introduce all the etiquette, bustle, noise and impertinence of royalty; by introducing levees, a courtly gazette, &amp;c. the latter under the direction of John Fenno, of pious memory; who stuffed it occasionally with all the nonsense, and empty sound of royalty, &amp;c. Just arrived in town, says Mr. Fenno, in his paper, the honourable Mr. such a one, &amp;c. Many thinking, sober∣minded citizens, became doubtful of Mr. Fen∣no's outward piety, considering all this trash and nonsense, as an insult offered to their un∣derstandings. His paper, in consequence, lost its circulation; and to save his reputation, he was under the necessity of changing it into a daily gazette; and depend on the speculators, and a few governmental men, for its support. He interspersed it occasionally, with some pi∣ous saying of some good old woman to the eastward, who, perhaps, suffered under the martyrdom of witchcraft; probably his old
<PB N="25" REF="030155_0024_0FE4B07FC82893C8"/>
grandmother, as some will have it, that he was educated by her; be this as it may, his libera∣lity of sentiment, is a proof, that he must have been educated by some old grandame;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The religion of too many old women, seldom arrives to a greater degree of perfection, than the restraining those natural appetites; which, when indulged to excess, reduce us to a level with the brute creation. When they have suppressed these, or to speak with more truth, but seve∣rity; when by reason of their old age, these have left them; they begin to think that they are pious, and are on the strait path to obtain an eter∣nity of bliss. But they either forget, or do not wish to understand, that malevolence, falsehood, spiritual pride and ill nature; when indulged, or practised in any degree; reduce us to the character of devils; these are properly the evils of the mind. The truly pious will be careful, in sup∣pressing the evils of the one, as well as those of the other.</NOTE> for he seldom shews a conscientious scrupulousness, in saying the most uncharitable things, of those who are opposed to him in principle, and after∣wards gild it over with some pious saying; but the devil, as well as Mr. Fenno, has been often known to assume the character of a religious man, in order to accomplish his diabolical schemes. Whilst the trash, and nonsense of his paper, was just cause of regret to many genuine republicans; it afforded others, of more levity, much cause of laughter and ridicule. To hear him announce in his paper, the arrival of the honorable Mr. —, from Richmond, Nor∣folk, or Charleston, on his way home to the eastward; after having swindled numbers of the old continental officers, and soldiers out of their certificates, at two shillings and six-pence in the pound; who were not let into the se∣crets of the funding system; may have been cause of laughter, to those who knew this gen∣tleman, and others of the speculating order, when they had not a shirt to their back; but
<PB N="26" REF="030155_0025_0FE4B08245AB0108"/>
must ertainly shock the feelings of every man of reflection; who regards justice and moral honesty, as the basis of all civil society. Yet these were the men, Mr. Fenno decorated with the epithet "honorable;" whilst the pa∣triots of seventy-six, were often insulted and ridiculed, in his paper, for petitioning con∣gress, for a remuneration of their losses. But a bare insult, was not sufficient to gratify Mr. Hamilton's vindicative spirit; nothing short, would do, of subverting the liberties, peace and happiness of the citizens. The constitu∣tion possessed great latitude of constructive power, and he was determined to exercise it. Hence we find him introducing laws partial and oppressive in their operation. The fund∣ing system, assumption, and excise laws, and the bank of the United States; are all the off∣spring of his brain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In contradiction to the foregoing; it is asserted by some, that Duer, who is now in the goal of New-York for his swindling; the friend, the assistant and associate of Mr. Hamilton; was the person who first propo∣sed the establishment of the bank, funding system, &amp;c.—See Thirteen Let∣ters, by A Citizen.</NOTE> The author of "thirteen letters by a citizen," in speaking of the latter, with great justness of thought, humourously observes, that "Mr. Hamilton, by committing a rape on the constitution, begot the bank of the United States." Surely it was a violence offered to the constitution; for there is no clause in it, that will justify such an establish∣ment. It was founded upon that clause, which says, "Congress shall provide for the general welfare;" although it has been five years in o∣peration,
<PB N="27" REF="030155_0026_0FE4B089E3241800"/>
who of its friends will now step forward, and prove in what particular man∣ner, it has been productive of general welfare; to the community at large? Experience, on the contrary, has convinced us; that there is no bank in the United States, more partial, limit∣ted, and selfish in its discounts. The fact is, it has been conducted in such a manner as to as∣sist, and enrich a few governmental men; who neither care, in principle, for bank, or government; longer than either mini∣ster to the enlargement of their pecuniary circumstances. The conduct of Porcupine, their champion, the other week to the tax-ga∣therer, exhibits a strong proof of the attach∣ment of his party to government, when their purse is in question. Although the bank has contributed to enrich a few, at the entire ne∣glect of others, yet the evil is partial, in com∣parison to those arising from the funding sy∣stem, assumption and excise laws. By the two former, Mr. Hamilton has reversed the origi∣nal contract; and in so doing, the United States have become responsible, for the pay∣ment of some millions of dollars, more than they were by the original contract. This he has done, to enrich a few sycophants, as rapa∣cious as vultures, ever ready to prey upon the vitals of their country. To discharge this enormous mass of national debt, it became necessary to lay heavy taxes upon the people; among these, we find "a law laying duties upon spirits distilled within the United States,
<PB N="28" REF="030155_0027_0FE4B08B6C7E0B90"/>
and upon stills:" a law which is every way repugnant to the principles of a republic; it has grown, and flourished, under the despo∣tism of monarchial governments only; where it required a military force to put it into ope∣ration. But oppressive taxes, and facility in encreasing the national debt, were not the on∣ly objects Mr. Hamilton had in view; a mili∣tary establishment was wanting, as a key stone to the arch. Michavel himself never invented schemes, fraught with more cunning, and du∣plicity; or more subversive of the liberties of a free people. By introducing an excise, he foresaw, as there was no law within the reach of government, more discordant to the feelings of the citizens, and repugnant to the spirit of a republic, that it would naturally meet with opposition; hence would arise the necessity of a standing army, to support the dignity of govern∣ment. But Mr. Hamilton's inordinate passion for a military establishment, to perfect his system, heated his imagination too much; he foresaw more than really happened. The opposition to the excise law, at first, was but trifling, par∣tial; and without system, or coincidence of sentiment, among those who were opposed to it. At the commencement of its operation, when a few discontented persons shewed them∣selves in opposition, had he ordered suits in law to be commenced against the refractory, it is universally believed, by those who know, better than Mr. Hamilton, the tem∣per of the people in the western counties
<PB N="29" REF="030155_0028_0FE4B08CF41B1C80"/>
of Pennsylvania, and the respect which they have always manifested for the judiciary au∣thority, that submission, by aid of the judici∣ary, might have been obtained. But it was not submission Mr. Hamilton desired, it was opposition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Mr. Hamilton did not desire opposition, why sport with the rights of the citizens, and the authority of the Judiciary Department; by serv∣ing the distillers of Fayette County with writs, that were illegal, to at∣tend at Philadelphia, nearly three hundred miles from their homes. I say illegal, for when the distillers had come to give in bail, they were found to be so. Was this not mockery, and sporting with the liberties of the people? but Mr. Hamilton will reason by analogy, and give us a long story about a cock and a bull.</NOTE> Hence we find him giving en∣couragement to the opposition, by an ill-ti∣med forbearance of urging the judiciary au∣thority; which gave the people time and op∣portunity, to discover the force of the opposi∣tion, by a general expression of the public sen∣timent. Whilst the negligence, or connivance of government, impressed them with the be∣lief, that it was feeble—wanting energy and firmness, to enforce obedience to its laws. Two powerful motives to induce a people, al∣ready dissatisfied, with other heightened mea∣sures of Mr. Hamilton's administration, to be∣come violent in their opposition; to a law which was more particularly oppressive on them, than on any other part of the union. In the mean time we find him, in the cabinet council, ad∣vocating, more probably giving birth to the treaty with England; and afterwards solicit∣ing the President, to appoint him to the em∣bassy; which was rejected by the influence of Mr. Randolph; this, at once, gives a solution to that bitterness, which Mr. Hamilton's par∣ty
<PB N="30" REF="030155_0029_0FE4B08F72BD6528"/>
have shewn towards Mr. Randolph since his resignation. For it is certain, that if Mr. Randolph had resigned from motives different from what he did, we would have never heard of Mr. Hamilton's solicitations for the embas∣sy, His pride and vanity were, no doubt, con∣siderably mortified; on finding that his solici∣tations were rejected by the President. This evidently shews, how fast, the President's con∣fidence in him was diminishing; for it cannot be urged, that it was a greater impropriety to appoint a Secretary, than a Chief Justice; it must therefore be owing to a diminution of the President's confidence in him. Happy would it have been for America, if no such confidence had ever existed! How highly pleasing would it have been for Mr. Hamilton, to become per∣sonally acquainted with Pitt, Grenville, and the <HI>immaculate</HI> George Rose; men, whose corrupt, and corrupting influence, he has been so anxi∣ous to imitate. What a delicious gratification would it have afforded him, to have dined with those renowned liberticides; he would then have been in his proper element, breathing his native air. This group of liberticides, would be like an assemblage of devils; leagued against the peace, welfare, and happiness of mankind.</P>
<P>Scarcely had the agitation subsided, which the public mind had been thrown into, by the unconstitutional appointment of Mr. Jay, as Minister Plenipotentiary to the court of St. James; when the western insurrection burst forth, like a mighty torrent, ready to sweep e∣very
<PB N="31" REF="030155_0030_0FE4B0961CD61480"/>
thing before it. Now it is, that Mr. Ha∣milton unmasks himself; and the little man appears to the world in his native plumage. It is now that he gives vent to his meditated re∣venge, in a hellish ejaculation, "Oh! that the insurgents would burn Pittsburgh!" What a forcible argument for a military establish∣ment? It is here we behold him losing sight of the dignity of his office; and like the wily ser∣pent, assuming all that variety of character, which malice, meanness, and treachery could invent; to ruin the reputation of Messrs. Find∣ley, Smilie, and Gallatin, in the public esti∣mation: who were the most active in suppres∣sing the insurrection; but who, on other occa∣sions, were opposed to the arbitrary measures of his administration. One moment we find him in the character of an hospitable friend, inviting an innocent, unsuspecting man,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Major Powers.—See Findley's History of the Western Insurrection.</NOTE> from his wife, his house, and family; and putting him under a military guard for several days; because he would not perjure himself, in prov∣ing the criminality of those gentlemen. Next instant, we find the little secretary assume a different shape; and with all the subtilty of a fiend, endeavour to extort evidence from those who were examined by him; first by telling them, that he had already sufficient testimony, in his pocket, of the guilt of those gentlemen.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A cobweb subtilty it was indeed; it shews the man's embicility of mind, for the greatest fool upon earth would be capable of seeing through it, and thus reason with himself; "If Mr. Hamilton has sufficient testi∣mony of the guilt of those gentlemen, why does he attempt to extort evi∣dence from me." What a low, contemptible and mean procedure, for a secretary of the treasury; yet he has frequently, says Mr. Findley in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>surrection, acted in this manner. Like Mr. Pope, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> every thing by stratagem; if it be only to take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with his neighbour, or eat a plate of capers; all must be done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>!</NOTE>
<PB N="32" REF="030155_0031_0FE4B097A6A7A140"/>
And when he could not succeed, in this wo∣manish proceeding, we next find him, like the frog in the fable, bloated with an imaginary consequence; assuming all the terrors of an in∣quisitorial monk; with knitted brow, and an∣gry look, threatening the evidence's own per∣sonal safety, if they would not confess to the guilt of these gentlemen:—of whom I will assert, upon a strict examination of facts, are more genuine federalists than Mr. Hamil∣ton; for it is now well known that he signed the constitution, with strong expressions of dis∣gust;—that it was wholly from its admitting such a latitude of constructive power;—and that he has often spoken of it since, not as a sacred compact, entered into for the general welfare and happiness of the citizens, but as a piece of paper and parchment.</P>
<P>After thus taking a general view of his con∣duct, in what terms ought we to address so black, so cowardly, and treacherous a tyrant? who, under the imposing name of public good, attempted to stab, assassin-like, the liberties, peace, and happiness of the citizens; whilst he, with his diabolical principles, were corrupting their morals, by combining vice with the lur∣ing hope of gain. Thou worse than Arnold, Noy, and all the Dumouriers!</P>
<P>After what has here been said, I will not hesi∣tate to predict, that when the clouds of prejudice
<PB N="33" REF="030155_0032_0FE4B099321FAE28"/>
are dissipated, and the present generation pass away; and when future historians will arise, to give an account of the present day; if they find a single transaction in the life of General Washington, that will cast a dishonourable re∣flection upon his memory; it will be the ap∣pointment of Mr. Hamilton, to the head of the treasury department.</P>
<P>In discussing the measures of our own ad∣ministration, and the revolutionary principle of the French government; I cannot conceive why occasion is taken, by Porcupine, to traduce the Irish nation; as a banditti of thieves and robbers. It argues in the man a degree of im∣pudence and folly, which is rarely met with a∣mongst individuals; but certainly never a∣mongst men of sentiment and education, or a∣mongst sensible well-informed writers; who will never run into digression, from the point in controversy, to indulge their malice and ha∣tred, in abusing any people. But to calumni∣ate all nations, except his own, seems to be the general design of this hireling; and this mark∣ed ill-nature shews itself, in a greater or less degree, in the writings of almost every En∣glishman; when he has had occasion to speak of the national character of others.</P>
<P>From a pamphlet published this present year, by Moreau de St. Mery, on the prisons of Phi∣ladelphia, which is now lying before me; I will be able to prove, to the honour of Irish∣men, that Porcupine's strictures upon the cha∣racter of the Irish, who emigrate to this coun∣try,
<PB N="34" REF="030155_0033_0FE4B09AC138CE20"/>
are false; and can only arise from his invincible ignorance of facts, and national pride and surliness of disposition.</P>
<P><HI>The fact then to be proved, is, that there are few∣er rogues, consequently more honest men, emigrate to this country from Ireland, than England, in pro∣portion to the whole number of emigrants.</HI> Moreau de St. Mery, in this pamphlet states, that du∣ring the space of four years, ending June 1791, there were three hundred and twenty-one fo∣reigners, under conviction in the prisons of Philadelphia; "among these, says he, two hundred and thirty-one were Irish, and eigh∣ty-four English or Scotch;" and during the next four years, ending March 1795, con∣tinues the above writer, "among the hundred and thirty-five strangers, ninety-two are Irish, and nineteen English or Scotch." To prevent trouble, in the calculations, and deductions let us combine the two periods, which make a term of eight years; so that the whole num∣ber of Irish convicted during this term, is three hundred and twenty-three. There are twenty-seven hundred Irish arrive in this port every year. The data, upon which I found this cal∣culation, are, that generally one year with another, five vessels sail from the port of Lon∣donderry, with passengers, and four from Bel∣fast; besides others from Newry, Killebegs, Donnegal, and some from Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and Sligo; but seldom from the latter. The nine vessels, sailing from Derry and Bel∣fast, contain from two to four hundred passen∣gers
<PB N="35" REF="030155_0034_0FE4B0A3A98691C8"/>
each; so that each vessel may be averaged at three hundred passengers; this makes the whole number of emigrants, amount yearly to twenty-seven hundred; as I have stated above. But if we go back in our calculations, to the four years subsequent to the peace in eighty-three, we will find that upwards of three thousand emigrated each year, to this port, from Londonderry alone; and if we did justice to our calculations and deduction, we would: because a man, however roguish he may be inclined, will rarely commence thief, or robber on his first arrival in a strange coun∣try; he must remain an honest man for some time, until he becomes acquainted with the manners, and customs of the people; the si∣tuation of the country; and above all, until he gets acquainted with others of his profes∣sion. But I need not go so far back, for proof, to convince the world, that the number of dis∣honest men, who emigrate from Ireland to this country, is much less, in proportion to the whole number of emigrants, than either from England, or Scotland. I have already shewn upon what data, I suppose twenty-se∣ven hundred emigrate to this port yearly; which, in the space of eight years, amount to twenty-one thousand six hundred; the num∣ber of those, who were convicted during that period, according to Moreau's statement, was three hundred and twenty-one, which are nearly as one is to sixty-two.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="030155_0035_0FE4B0A5396DC070"/>Let us now see how the honesty of English∣men, will bear to be analized, in like manner. It is so generally known, I need scarcely repeat, that, for four years subsequent to the establish∣ment of peace in eighty-three, there were few or no Englishmen emigrated to this country; except some clerk, who were sent, by their ma∣sters, into the seaports, on schemes of specula∣tion. Many of those gentlemen, have since fat∣tened upon the spoils of the war-worn soldier; as well as upon the labour, and industry of the unsuspecting farmer. They now assume a big-bellied consequence, in our streets, little inferior to a London alderman; who has been fed upon turtle-soup, and calves heads. They may be known by an affected sneer, at every thing which is American; and a frothy inso∣lence in their looks; when they see a man, whom they suspect to possess less wealth than themselves. In the eight years, de St. Mery has given us, of those under condemnation in the prisons of Philadelphia; that is, from June 1787, to March 1795, there were not more English and Scotch, I am convinced, arrived in this port, to settle in the country, than one hundred each year, upon an average; which a∣mount, in eight years, to eight hundred. The number of English convicted during that peri∣od, I have already stated, amounted to one hundred and three; the proportion, therefore, of the whole number of convicts, to the whole number of emigrants, is somewhat more, than, as one is to eight. Hence it unquestionably
<PB N="37" REF="030155_0036_0FE4B0A6CACEFBA8"/>
appears, that out of every sixty-two, who emi∣grated, from Ireland to the United States, one in the course of eight years is convicted, for committing some offence against the laws of the state; whereas, out of every eight English∣men who emigrated, one is convicted in the same space of time. To which I may add, without hazarding my reputation, as a candid writer, that there are generally five, or six spe∣culators or swindlers, arrive in our city every year from the different ports of England. These are generally stiled d—d smart fel∣lows, but of whom the laws can take no cog∣nizance; and who are perhaps, as pernicious to society, and contribute as largely in cor∣rupting the morals of our citizens, as the open∣ly profane. These gentry appear to be fully acquainted with the maxim of a certain Qua∣ker, who is well known, among the speculating order; for a peculiar address, and dexterity, he has in negociating all his transactions. Be∣ing called to an account one day, by a gen∣tleman for want of candour, in his dealings, Obediah replied with more warmth, than cau∣tion; "friend, thee art mistaken, thee needs not complain; I did not cheat thee, I only out∣witted thee." From the foregoing deductions, which I have drawn from the most unquesti∣onable data, it appears that if the same number of English, as of Irish, emigrated to this coun∣try in the same space of time; there would be two thousand seven hundred and fifty-four convicted; whereas there are only 321 of the
<PB N="38" REF="030155_0037_0FE4B0A95159D948"/>
Irish; what a blessing it is to the United States, that national pride, ignorance and prejudice keep them at home? Although fully satisfied of having convinced the most obstinate and prejudiced, as far, as well established facts will do so; that there are fewer rogues emigrate, to this country, from Ireland than from En∣gland, nearly in a proportion as one is to eight. Yet if the whole number of Englishmen who were convicted, for committing offences a∣gainst the laws of the state, had been found innocent on their trials; still there are a few of their countrymen, who have escaped pu∣nishment, by a strange perversion of the laws, —have done more injury to society, and have robbed the citizens of the United States of more property, than all the articles would a∣mount to, that were stolen by Irishmen since the first settlement of America. Among these I will mention two only, because more would be unnecessary. Duer of New-York, it is well known, failed in one million five hundred thousand dollars; it is also known that a great part of this he borrowed in five, ten, fifteen, twenty, &amp;c. dollars, as he could get them; from every fruit-woman, drayman, and car∣ter. But if an Irishman, from want of edu∣cation or from necessity, robs a man of a cow or a horse; the whole nation must be calum∣niated by a contemptible wretch, as thieves and robbers. The other I will mention is Sta∣bler, who failed in New-York, ran off to this city; and soon after opened a large store, and
<PB N="39" REF="030155_0038_0FE4B0AF19D0BFD8"/>
as soon after failed in forty thousand dollars; and fled to Amsterdam.</P>
<P>And now let it be affirmed to the honor of Irishmen, that three-fourths of all the mer∣chants, who turn bankrupts throughout the United States, are English and Scotchmen; although there are as many of the former merchants, as there are of the latter.</P>
<P>There is another circumstance, which ought not to be concealed on the present occasion; as it affects the honor and honesty of English∣men, in a very delicate point; its consequen∣ces are extensive in their operation, and bane∣ful to society; it ought therefore to receive publicity: I mean the counterfeiting the notes of the bank of the United States, and North A∣merica. It is a truth, which the heads of the judiciary department of the state can testify, as well as the sheriff and goaler of Lancaster county; that there were an English man and woman tried, and convicted at Lancaster; for forging the notes of these two banks. This cir∣cumstance, with a combination of others, has thrown such light upon that affair; as will ju∣stify us in asserting, that there was a banditti of Englishmen and women dispersed over the United States; from New-Hampshire to Geor∣gia, employed in counterfeiting, and passing these notes. It is a fact, known to all Europe, that the <HI>immaculate</HI> Pitt employed several men in counterfeiting French assignats; but owing to the watchfulness of the national convention, few of them ever went into circulation: on
<PB N="40" REF="030155_0039_0FE4B0B19E5C3B68"/>
finding that he failed in his attempt to raise money, by his counterfeit assignats, to carry on "a just and necessary war;" have we not the most presumptive proof, that he turned his at∣tention to counterfeiting the notes of these two banks? We all know, that the British counter∣feited the paper currency of the United States, in the late revolution; and why not now the paper currency of these two banks? their ne∣cessities are greater now, than they were dur∣ing the American war; and what faith, or mo∣ral rectitude can we expect from a set of cor∣rupt unprincipled men, goaded on by neces∣sity? Surely there is no barrier which national faith, honor, and justice can erect, that such men will not break through and violate; to ac∣complish their nefarious designs. And when we consider that these banks are situated in a more extensive, and larger trading town, than any other in the United States; their notes ha∣ving therefore a more general and extensive circulation; is a circumstance which renders them fit objects of Pitt's designs. To which if we add, that these counterfeits appeared short∣ly after he had advertised French assignats for sale, and was defeated in his attempts to get them into circulation; it gives additional force to the evidence. But there is one fact yet re∣mains to be told, which must remove the doubts of every man, and silence at once the clamours of the British faction. It is well known, to many citizens of Philadelphia, that at the time when Pitt published his counterfeit as∣signats,
<PB N="41" REF="030155_0040_0FE4B0B32646FB10"/>
there was an Englishman residing in this city of the name of Hancock; who had fled from London, some years before, for crimes alledged against him there; and for which he would, no doubt, have received a Tyburn elevation, had he been taken. About this time Hancock left this city for London; and soon after return∣ed with all the apparatus for coining dollars; and several copperplates, upon which were en∣graved the counterfeit notes. He had several hundred copies struck off the plates, in Lon∣don; and brought over the bank-notes in sheets. Now to suppose that Mr. Hancock, who is well known to be an accomplished villain, would be so stupid as to return to London, when conscious of his guilt, and that certain death awaited him there, if he were detected, is improbable. It is a supposition that cannot be admitted, as there is not one circumstance, except the man's stupidity, which is not a cha∣racteristic in him, that could justify us in form∣ing the supposition; since it is well known that there are some of his countrymen residing within the United States, fully capable of coun∣terfeiting bank-notes; why then endanger his life, in returning to London, when all things might be as well accomplished here? It is evi∣dent he must have returned, under the autho∣rity of Mr. Pitt, who employed him in dis∣posing of the counterfeit notes; as Lord North did many of the old tories, who now assume amongst us, no small degree of consequence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hancock was detected and convicted in Lancaster, and an Irishman with him, who lent him his house, and became the dupe of his villainy. What pity our laws did not make a just distinction, and inflict a twofold punishment on the man, who would act the villain himself, and corrupt the morals of another, who might have lived and died an honest man.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="030155_0041_0FE4B0B5A56A04A8"/>To attempt pursuing Porcupine through all the digressions, turnings, and labyrinths of his writings; would be like himself hunting a flea, amongst the plaits of his old grandmo∣ther's petticoat, under the little damson tree.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Life.</NOTE> One moment we find him abusing Mr. Swan∣wick of Philadelphia; the next instant we dis∣cover him, all the way in Virginia, snarling like a surly dog, at Mr. Giles; thence in New-York, puffing his foetid breath in the face of Mr. Livingston; and next instant we find him in the western counties of Pennsylvania; like a beast of prey, prowling after Mr. Gallatin.</P>
<P>The republican party being so numerous, that to vindicate the conduct of each individu∣al, against Porcupine's illiberal and ill-natured abuse; would consume more time than I have to spare on the present occasion, and occupy more pages than I have assigned to this pam∣phlet. Let us therefore pursue some method, and begin with Mr. Swanwick first; because he lives nearer us than the others. It is urged by Porcupine that he is a vain man; but what relation has vanity to politics? a prejudiced mind, like Porcupine's, may think there is a connection; for my part I can discover none, more than there is between vanity and religi∣on; nor do I see how vanity can interweave it∣self with politics; I know ambition may—am∣bition
<PB N="43" REF="030155_0042_0FE4B0BD07EAB7D8"/>
will lead a man to strain his faculties, in composing a harangue; which will take him three or four hours in delivery. Some are ambitious of being thought men of parts, great orators, or ingenuous men; and others are again so weak, as to grow ambitious of be∣ing esteemed rich men; as if riches were per∣manent; and some through meanness, are ambitious of being considered poor men. But all this time we never say, we are vain to be thought great orators, men of parts, &amp;c. An ambitious man will leave no attempts unessay∣ed, to have his political sentiments adopted with all their prejudices; at the hazard of e∣very thing, that is connected with his coun∣try's welfare; and in this respect, I believe, Mr. Hamilton and Porcupine are two of the most ambitious men we have; consequently the most dangerous. In their own way, nei∣ther of them has left a path unexplored; in order to have his favorite principles adopted; one by sophistry, frequently of the slightest texture, and an analogical method of reason∣ing; which oftener leads men into error than any other. It is indeed the method chiefly practised by sophists, as they frequently take for granted, that there is a likeness between things; when there is none in nature. Who ever discovered a likeness between the Presi∣dent of the United States, and the army; be∣fore Mr. Hamilton attempted to exculpate the President, from those charges brought against him, by the "calm observer?" Mr. Hamilton
<PB N="44" REF="030155_0043_0FE4B0BE91E99DF8"/>
takes for granted there is a likeness between them, hence he concludes, as the army have often drawn more money out of the treasury; than the specific sums appropriated by Con∣gress, and those at an earlier period; that the President was also justifiable in doing the same; which, in other words, is saying that the President's necessities are equal to the ar∣my's; for unless Mr. Hamilton proves this, which I think he will not attempt to prove, his deductions are all childish, and frivo∣lous; and will never exculpate the President in the public opinion. This vein of analo∣gical reasoning, is the basis of all Mr. Ha∣milton's writings; and if one had time to analyze them, I am persuaded, the greater part of them, as well as of those where∣in he prides himself most, would tumble to the ground like a baseless fabric; for reason∣ing by analogy is like building a house upon a sandy foundation. But to illustrate more fully Mr. Hamilton's method of reasoning, let us suppose him crossing a field, at Albany, to seduce his neighbour's wife, or daughter; as it is said, he has a wonderful itching after other men's wives; and when he has gotten into one of these catterwalling moods, no he-cat is more lascivious; for rather than be disap∣pointed, he would rush into the ebony arms of an African, provided she had a husband. I say let us suppose, that he is crossing a field, and in his way meets a white pig; if he had never seen one before, what would be his me∣thod
<PB N="45" REF="030155_0044_0FE4B0C01BDD9350"/>
of reasoning on this occasion? not like an enlightened philosopher, who would exa∣mine if it possessed those properties, in com∣mon, with the species to which it belongs; or whether it was a variety only; but the first idea, that would enter the mind of our analo∣gical reasoner, would be that of milk; if he were necessarily led to reason on the properties of the pig, he would proceed thus, "milk is white, and we all know it is nutritive; there∣fore it must be good to make men go a catter∣walling. The pig is white, it must consequent∣ly possess the same properties; I will therefore make a funding system of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the funding system has not set men a catterwalling, it has certain∣ly set many a beggar upon horseback.—The above reasoning is not more absurd, than the reasoning of Mr. Hamilton, in support, that "a public debt is a public blessing."</NOTE> Among the va∣rious bonds of union which direct men's under∣standings, to associate their ideas, resemblance is one; and I believe there are few who pos∣sess that associating quality in a higher degree, than Mr. Hamilton; like an <HI>ignus fatuus,</HI> he bewilders us in the multiplicity of his ideas; hence he has been very justly stiled "the long winded Pacificus."</P>
<P>But Porcupine is a writer of a different cast from Mr. Hamilton; although their princi∣ples, and the object they have in view, are precisely the same, the discredit of republican∣ism; yet they pursue roads widely different. Porcupine more bold, and adventurous; but less artful, and designing; like a head strong stubborn horse, that runs off with his rider,
<PB N="46" REF="030155_0045_0FE4B0C2A3984E00"/>
he dashes through mud and mire, making the dirt fly in all directions. If truth he in his way, he besmears it with calumny and false∣hood; for he has on every occasion fully shewn, that no truth, however sacred, he will respect. There is no calumny too gross, no falsehood too glaring and absurd; for this hireling to practise, as weapons, in butchering the man's reputation, who is opposed to him in princi∣ple. And when he has calumniated him to∣day, he will return to it to-morrow with the same eagerness, that a dog would to his vomit.</P>
<P>But let us return to Mr. Swanwick, of whom I am justifiable in asserting, that if he acquits himself, in his political capacity, as an honest man; his constituents will never enquire, whe∣ther he sent a piece of poetry to the editor of a London magazine, for publication, or not: or whether he has his house ornamented with paintings, busts, and statues;—that he has ac∣quitted himself to the entire satisfaction of his constituents, Porcupine will not attempt to de∣ny. But if he has sent a piece of poetry, across the atlantic for publication, is that any proof of his vanity? common sense spurns the idea. If such a thing be a proof of a man's vanity, how many vain men will we find amongst mankind? I could here, were it necessary, name several; who, if they did not send po∣etry, sent other works for publication; yet who ever thought, before Porcupine, that such a circumstance constituted a vain man? Porcupine criticises upon this poetry, but
<PB N="47" REF="030155_0046_0FE4B0C91CA0C7F8"/>
Mr. Swanwick may reply to him with the same justness of thought, that Hanibal repli∣ed to the philosopher; who had the folly and presumption, to discant before him upon the principles of war. "Of all the silly old men, says Hanibal, that I ever heard talk, thou art the silliest." I need not ask the reader, whe∣ther Hanibal or the philosopher was the vainest man; neither need I ask him, whether Mr. Swanwick or Porcupine is the vainest man. Porcupine criticises upon Mr. Swanwick's poe∣try, like the vain philosopher upon the princi∣ples of war; without having had any experi∣ence, or possessing one of the necessary qualifi∣cations of a warrior. And Porcupine criticises upon Mr. Swanwick's poetry, without posses∣sing one of the necessary qualifications of a critique; except his ill-nature. Porcupine urg∣es also, because Mr. Swanwick has his house ornamented with paintings, busts and statues; he must therefore be a vain man. If he had reflected, for fifty years, and as many centu∣ries, provided he out-lived that period, for a fact or an argument to prove a man to be vain, he could not have brought forward one more preposterous. Those things are evidently a proof of Mr. Swanwick's love of the arts; and in this opinion, I believe, every sensible man will coincide with me; for if we judge of cau∣ses by their effects, we can draw no other con∣clusion. By purchasing those things does he not reward the labour of the artist? he who rewards the labour of the artist, gives encou∣ragement
<PB N="48" REF="030155_0047_0FE4B0CAA79433C0"/>
to the art itself; and he who encou∣rages the art must love it. How simple and easy it is for men to reason, when they have truth on their side, and candour to acknow∣ledge it. If every man would act their part, in that respect, as well as Mr Swanwick; the arts would not languish in this country, so long in their infancy, as they do. But men's minds are too much absorpt in speculation, and pecunia∣ry aggrandizement, to admit a taste sufficiently refined to relish them. Why then censure a man for contributing his share, to the encou∣ragement of those arts; which enlightened ages and nations have approved? nay more, it was owing to the encouragement that the arts met with in those times; which make future writ∣ers apply to them, the appellation of an en∣lightened age, or enlightened people. Why do we call the Indians an uncivilized people? it is not because they possess fewer of the social, and domestic virtues than we do; for travellers all agree, that these they fulfill with more warmth, than even the pious folks of New-En∣gland; if we except bundling, as we have not yet learned, whether that social virtue has been introduced amongst them. It is not because they possess less moral honesty, than is found a∣mongst Porcupine's friends; for travellers agree also, that amongst them are found no brokers, no speculators, no stock and land-jobbers; nor have they yet discovered, notwithstanding se∣veral years residence amongst them, one in∣stance of mercantile fraud and meanness. But
<PB N="49" REF="030155_0048_0FE4B0CC35889ED0"/>
it is alone from the circumstance of their hav∣ing no relish for the arts, and sciences; that we apply to them the degraded appellation, of "an uncivilized people." Why then, in the name of heaven! should we accuse a man of vanity, for encouraging those things; by which we acquired the honourable appellation of "a civilized people?" But what lengths, will not envy and malice go: when determined upon murdering a man's reputation The same ma∣lice and envy, which persecute Mr. Swanwick to-day; persecuted Mr. Nicholson for nine long years in this city; his political sentiments did not harmonize with a certain party; and he was treading the path, to acquire a fortune, by which he was likely to obtain a pre-emi∣nence over them; as far as riches will do so, in a free country. They were like the surly dog in the manger, who could not eat the hay himself; neither would they suffer Mr. Ni∣cholson, to obtain a fortune; as far as their malignant influence could go, in preventing it. But when he had acquired that fortune, which was the sole object of his wishes; and which he pursued with the most unremitted exertion, and industry; he then changed his political sentiments, turned his back on his old friends; and became the rallying-point of almost all the land-jobbers, and speculators, throughout the United States, Since that time they have taken him into their bosoms, and some of them even now court his friendship. We do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that party accuse him, to day, of a single
<PB N="50" REF="030155_0049_0FE4B0CEB9F8B6A8"/>
<HI>faux-paus;</HI> nay he is to them, as immaculate, as the virgin rose. I would ask any man of sense, and candour—for it is only to such men I wish to speak on the present occasion, is Mr. Nicholson an honester man to-day, than he was six years ago, or is he less vain? I suppose the next charge, brought against Mr. Swan∣wick, by Porcupine; is, that he is a vain man, because he eats—he drinks, and sleeps; for these he may repeat to-morrow. "The short man from Philadelphia," what ingenuity of thought! who would have believed their own eyes, on seeing Mr. Swanwick, that he was a man of moderate size; if the humourous, the witty, and ingenuous Porcupine had not told us? What a happy discovery!</P>
<P>Had antient biographers and historians, been as particular in transmitting to us; the size, figure, and tone of voice, of their respective heroes, as Porcupine is in handing Mr. Swan∣wick's down to futurity; what a glare of light would it have diffused upon their histories? For he seems to insinuate that the capacity of men's minds, ought to be measured by the bulk of their bodies. The observation exact∣ly contains as much profoundness of thought, and good sense; as one made by the learned Doctor Belknap, in his history of New-Hamp∣shire. Speaking of the climate of that state, and the coldness of the winter season; the Doctor profoundly tells us, that this is the time, "when nature teaches the hens to set on
<PB N="51" REF="030155_0050_0FE4B0D66A4073B8"/>
the cow's back, to keep their feet warm."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. page 19.</NOTE> Heavens! who would have thought? if the learned Doctor had not told us, that the hens of New-Hampshire possess so much sagacity. I suppose a Virginia, or an Irish hen, would be such a stupid, silly devil; as to run in a cold day, and set herself down upon a sheet of ice, or a heap of snow. But if the hens of New-Hampshire possess so much sagacity, how much more must the learned Doctor possess? he would never have thought, I presume, of setting himself down upon a cow's back, in a cold day, to keep his feet warm, had not the hens put him in mind of it; nay, I am per∣suaded, he would prefer to sit by a good fire; for certainly it is no uncommon thing, to find a learned Doctor sitting by a pleasant fire, in a cold day, in preference to a cow's back; which unquestionably proves, that a Doctor in divinity as well as Porcupine, may possess more sagacity than a hen.</P>
<P>While I am thus speaking of the sagacity of hens, and doctors in divinity; it brings to my recollection, the author of "the American U∣niversal Geography;" who has lately been crowned with the aristotelian cap. This geo∣graphic divine speaking of the political dis∣sentions which prevailed in New-Hampshire, respecting the adoption of the federal constitu∣tion, brings in the following argument to prove, that the delegates to the state conven∣tion, who had received instructions from their
<PB N="52" REF="030155_0051_0FE4B0D7F28A3F68"/>
constituents, were not in duty bound to obey them. "Although, says this learned son of Aristotle, the instructions of constituents can∣not, on the true principles of representation, be binding upon a deputy in any legislative assembly, because his constituents are but a part of the state, and have not heard the ar∣guments and objections of the whole, where∣as his act is to affect the whole state." I would ask Mr. Morse, what are the majority in any legislative assembly? are they not a part? but says Mr. Morse, "a part ought not to govern;" a majority being a part, (for it is evident that a majority of the towns might have given in∣structions) therefore they ought not govern, according to his mode of reasoning. A doc∣trine subversive of every principle of true re∣publicanism. Some men shew so much ambi∣tion to be thought ingenuous writers, that they would even sacrifice truth for the sake of a sophism; nay even violate the sanctity of their clerical profession, for the sake of a lo∣gical falsehood. Strange that men so enlight∣ened as the people to the eastward, are repre∣sented to be by those two writers, and not know their political rights, and the rank which they ought to hold in society! to be enlight∣ened and not know ones's political rights, is a manifest absurdity; to know one's political rights and not be capable of giving instruc∣tions to a deputy, is an absurdity no less gla∣ring. Wonderful philosophers! ages to come will read with delight, and astonishment your

learned productions! For one, in the very depth of his philosophical researches, has dis∣covered that New-Hampshire is situated upon the terraqueous globe;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. page 1.</NOTE> and that the hens of that state are so sagacious, as to sit upon the cow's back, in a cold day, to keep their feet warm. And the other has proved—logically proved, to an astonished world, that the ser∣vant ought not to obey his master, nor the agent his employer. Wonderful philosophers! what an irreparable loss it is to modern litera∣ture, that these thy learned productions, did not appear before Swift published his "battle of the antient and the modern books;" for Herodotus, and Livy; Aristottle, and Plato; who led on the antients, must have fallen be∣fore them, and modern literature crowned with unfading laurels. Wonderful philoso∣phers!</P>
<P>The disposition of the New England clergy, to get themselves interwoven into the govern∣ment of their respective states; is manifest up∣on every important, political question; which comes before the public. It is a well known fact that the clergy of Massachusetts, once held the reins of that government; and since they have been ousted by the good sense of the citizens, they have not ceased to grasp at every opportunity; whereby they might regain their antient unlimitted power, over the rights and consciences of the citizens. Does not this exactly correspond with the part,
<PB N="54" REF="030155_0053_0FE4B0DC09C2A840"/>
which many of the New-England clergy have acted, upon a late important question? In sup∣port of my assertion generally, I have only to appeal to the writings of Mr. Morse, wherein he says, that the very democratical govern∣ment of Connecticut, is counterbalanced by the aristocracy of the clergy. We know then, that the interests of aristocracy and democra∣cy are diametrically opposite; and when such interests exist in a state, they must naturally create dissention among its citizens; but we hear of no such dissention among the citizens of Connecticut; for the aristocracy of the cler∣gy, like a slow poison in the human body, has paralized the democratical part and rendered it merely nominal. The clergy of the eastern states are like those women, who are more re∣markable for subtilty, than candour; and who through principles of cunning and artifice, go∣vern their silly husbands, without letting them know that they are governed. When a certain divine personage, at whose name every knee ought to bend, and the tongue of clamour cease, was asked by one of those brothers; who thought himself unjustly dealt with, in regard to his patrimonial estate, what he should do? "Man, replied the Son of God, who made me a judge?" giving him to understand that car∣nal, or worldly affairs; were foreign to the true spirit, and intention of his mission. And when others, to try the political sentiments of the same divine personage, presented him with a piece of silver; and after being informed that
<PB N="55" REF="030155_0054_0FE4B0E496F5DA78"/>
the image and superscription it bore, were Cae∣sar's; he declined all interference in political matters, by giving them the following evasive answer; "render, says he, unto Caesar, the things that are Caesar's." Are not those circum∣stances which directly and unequivocally prove, that the Christian religion, in its purity, does not admit clergymen interfering in political concerns. Hence we are no longer surprised, to find clergymen of ambitious views and mer∣cenary principles, attempting to prove that the servant ought not to obey his master. Bet∣ter such clergymen would relinquish, at once, their clerical functions; than longer pervert the precepts of Christianity, by making them subservient to their mercenary purposes.</P>
<P>Porcupine's criticisms, on Mr. Swanwick's poetry, are not the only instance we have of his vanity and ill nature. The illiberal and vulgarly manner which he has treated Tele∣machus, a work of the celebrated Fenelon, in a French grammar he published some time a∣go in this city, is disgusting to the feelings of every man, who regards virtuous and enlight∣ened men, as the greatest blessing and orna∣ment to society. Of this work, which Porcu∣pine treats with contempt and ridicule, a writ∣er highly esteemed for his candour and good sense, speaks in the following manner; "no work, says he, ever had a greater reputation; the stile of it is lively, natural and beautiful; the fictions well contrived; the moral sublime; and the political maxims all tending to the
<PB N="56" REF="030155_0055_0FE4B0E61F300240"/>
happiness of mankind." But Porcupine, in contempt of the universal opinion of mankind, ridicules this work; and calls Telemachus a simple fellow. Why? because he would not go to bed to Calypso, who was in love with him. Gracious God! that a man would be so lost to all sense of decency, and moral senti∣ment, as to call another "a simple fellow;" because he would not prostitute himself, and indulge his brutal appetites; at the expence of innocence and virtue. This is uniformly the method, which men of vicious habits endea∣vour to propagate their nefarious principles; by ridiculing virtue, and innocence; for if they could get men to be once ashamed of their in∣nocence, and virtue; they were then sure of succeeding. When we view Porcupine him∣self in the character of a seducer, we are no longer surprised to find him ridiculing Telema∣chus, as "a simple fellow." When we behold him inveigling an innocent girl, not more than sixteen or seventeen years, from her aged pa∣rents—their only remaining blossom—and last best hope; when we consider him breaking the ties of parental affection, and filial duty; exci∣ting animosity between parent and child; our wonder ceases when we find him endeavouring to excite animosity, between the citizens of the eastern and the southern states. When we view him giving an aged parent occasion to exclaim, in the bitterness of his heart, "If I am bereft of my only daughter, I am bereft!" What pa∣rent of sensibility, who has a daughter; or what
<PB N="57" REF="030155_0056_0FE4B0E7A8D2AF00"/>
brother of sensibility, who has a sister; that would not be roused with indignation, at re∣flecting on such circumstances? Are the tears and sighs of an aching heart—a bereft parent, unworthy of our notice! is female happiness of no consideration amongst men, that we should pass it over in silence!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In answer to the foregoing we have only to observe, that it was ge∣nerally believed, by those who were intimate at the house where Porcu∣pine lodged, on his arrival, that he had seduced the girl who lived with him as his wife: they believed, and said so, but upon what authority I never enquired.</NOTE> When we moreover consider him abusing the archbishop of Cambray, and Doctor Franklin; two of the most enlightened men of their age; it confirms us in our belief, that his writings tend to the subversion of all those principles; upon which rest the peace, happiness, and well-being of so∣ciety.</P>
<P>The archbishop of Cambray believed and supported the being of a Deity, and the Chri∣stian religion; Porcupine says, that Doctor Franklin a deity only, and moral rectitude. The latter he reproaches in the most groveling manner, and the former he calls a "silly bab∣bler." Taking a general view of the princi∣ples of mankind, so far as they relate to reli∣gion, we are naturally led to divide them in∣to three classes; those who believe in a Su∣preme Being and a Redeemer, are stiled Chri∣stians; those who believe in a Supreme Being alone, and the fitness of moral actions to pro∣cure eternal happiness, are stiled Deists; and those who believe as neither of the former,
<PB N="58" REF="030155_0057_0FE4B0E93081B980"/>
are stiled Atheists. Porcupine ridicules Doctor Franklin's principles in the silliest manner, without refuting them; now if he ridicules the principles of a Deist, and laughs at the principles of a Christian? what inference can we draw? but that he is himself an Atheist; and if to this conclusion, which I think every man of candour will acknowledge to be just, we add the contempt he has shewn for the Christian religion, by not attending any of its public institutions; for who ever saw Por∣cupine at a religious assembly in this city? it must confirm every man's belief, that Por∣cupine is an Atheist in the fullest latitude of the word. I have taken for granted, all this time, on the authority of Porcupine, that Doctor Franklin was a Deist; a man of can∣dour and an enlightened understanding, will never make an assertion, which he cannot sup∣port by some fact, or fair deduction; but what proof has Porcupine brought forward, that will lead us to believe, that Doctor Franklin's principles were deistical; surely not one, that would induce a credulous child to believe so. He has brought forward the heresay of an en∣venomed old man; who is universally known to entertain an irreconcileable hatred, to the memory of Doctor Franklin; because he took such an active part in the late revolution; well may we apply to him, on this occasion, the saying of a celebrated writer; "as bad as men are, they dare not appear to be the ene∣mies of virtue, and when they resolve to per∣secute
<PB N="59" REF="030155_0058_0FE4B0EFC16B9DF0"/>
it, they pretend to believe it false, or lay some crime to its charge." I repeat again, that Porcupine has not adduced one senti∣ment of the Doctor's of a deistical tendency; only the malignant aspersions of a turbulent old man, who is more remarkable for his bankruptsies, and clamorous disposition; than for candour, fair dealing, and a desire of seek∣ing after truth. But I have produced both sentiments and actions of Porcupine; from which I have, by the fairest deduction, pro∣ved him to be an Atheist. For if we believe in a deity, the immortality of the soul, and in future rewards and punishments; in which no Atheist ever believed; To obtain those future rewards, there can be only the following prin∣ciples of general conduct; that is we must ei∣ther believe in the merits of a Redeemer and moral actions, which are always the conse∣quence of such a belief; or in the fitness of moral rectitude alone, to procure us those fu∣ture rewards; now he who ridicules and laughs at men for believing and practising one or other of these general principles; cannot be said to believe, or practise either himself; and if he neither believes, nor practises either, it is then self evident, he must be an Atheist. For it would be preposterous, in the extreme, to suppose a man would treat with contempt and ridicule those sacred principles of action in o∣thers, which mark the general tenor of his own conduct. Before we attempt to ridicule a thing, we must remove from it all those ideas of sa∣credness,
<PB N="60" REF="030155_0059_0FE4B0F2451D0D30"/>
which we formerly considered attach∣ed to it.</P>
<P>In his "Scare Crow," he quotes the follow∣ing passage out of Doctor Franklin's will, to prove him an aristocrat; notwithstanding the services he rendered his country, and the cause of liberty, and science in general. "I bequeath, says the Doctor, to my worthy friend George Washington, my gold-headed cane, sur∣mounted with a liberty cap: if it were a scep∣tre he is worthy of it." Porcupine then makes the following remark; "after all the Doctor's clamour against kings, he thought a sceptre something more than a liberty cap." But, I answer, it was directly the reverse; it was not owing to any estimation the Doctor held a sceptre in; but being well convinced, that Ge∣neral Washington always entertained a wo∣manish longing after a sceptre; which made him use that soothing expression. It shews the Doctor's goodness of heart, that he wished to part in peace with all mankind; and give cause of chagrin to none. Instead of proving, that the Doctor held a sceptre in higher estimation than a liberty cap, it proves only, that Gene∣ral Washington always held it in higher esti∣mation; for is it not self-evident, that if the President entertained an antipathy towards a sceptre, or viewed it as a contemptible bauble; and the Doctor, under these cir∣cumstances, offered him his cane, by saying, "Sir, if it were a sceptre, you are worthy of it;" would not such conduct be something
<PB N="61" REF="030155_0060_0FE4B0F3CCFAE810"/>
like irony? would it not be degrading the pre∣sent in the President's opinion, and directly in∣sulting his feelings? Porcupine further ob∣serves, that "poor Richard (Doctor Franklin) certainly deserves to be tumbled from his niche, for his dying confession;" because he discovered to the world the President's fondness for a sceptre; "and I trust, continues Porcu∣pine, when the day of retribution comes he will not be forgotten;" the above passage of this <HI>humane</HI> hireling needs but little comment; it fully shews of itself to what savage lengths, his party would extend their persecutions if they dared—that they would even wreak their feeble vengeance, upon a senseless block of marble. This is the generous—the immacu∣late hero, who first accuses, and then condemns the French nation; for a crime which he threatens to put into execution, when a suita∣ble opportunity will offer. Would it not be well for the corporation, to take notice of him; before his hellish malice may tempt him to de∣face, that beautiful statue? Surely threats are as cognizable in law, as real crimes: No doubt his good old friend, Mr. Olden, would spare time from his private discounting, to go before a magistrate and pledge some of his dirty acres, as a security for his good behaviour. But still the magistracy ought to assert their dignity; and be a safeguard to the works of genius, as well as to that property which is too often ac∣quired by fraud, and speculation.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="030155_0061_0FE4B0F55606B7B8"/>I have already adduced arguments and facts, sufficient to convince the most prejudiced, that Porcupine is neither a Christian, nor a moral man. But the following fact, establishes be∣yond all controversy, the impiety of this wretched scribbler. In his Censor of May, page 189, speaking of Mr. Swanwick, he advi∣ses, with the most unblushing effrontery, the ladies of Philadelphi to go, and "even s— him:" monstrous obscenity! assuring them at the same time, by a solemn oath, that "they need not apprehend any mischief." Heavens! what an incitement does he offer to vice! What shall we in future think of this hireling's mo∣desty, morality and discretion? How long will he be suffered to pass with impunity? I have not the least doubt, were he in London, but he could easily get some cockneigh wench, to act that vile abominable part: But sure I am that the American women, though the Yankees may bundle, have not yet become so lost to e∣very sense of modesty and virtue; as that he could even find one among Mrs. Maginnis's girls so abandoned. When William Penn was tracing out his beloved city of Philadelphia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Crow.</NOTE> if any one had told him, that the time would come, when one of his own countrymen would have the canine impudence; for to advise the ladies of Philadelphia, in many of whose veins his own blood was trickling, to prostitute them∣selves; I much question if the good old man, though a Quaker, would not have said "that
<PB N="63" REF="030155_0062_0FE4B0FC845FDF80"/>
it was a d—d lie;" and if it would be fur∣ther told him, that it was a grey-haired old Quaker who himself had daughters, that was vending all this obscenity and prostituted trash; would not the good old man have exclaimed with warmth? "Fellow, thee art a d —d confounded liar." Poor old man! he little dreamed what was to happen, about the close of the eighteenth century; but William was no dreamer—he knew how to employ his time to more advantage. He would rather be giv∣ing strings of beads, and old horse shoes to the Indians for their lands; than sitting up in his great armed chair dreaming about the dis∣cord, which Porcupine and his associate Ben Davis, would endeavour to excite, among the peaceable citizens, by their lies and calumnies. What a golden age! when men with a little religious artifice, on the tip of their tongues; and a few strings of beads and old horse shoes, could purchase land in any quantity. What pity some of our present monopolizers, had not lived in those days of beads, and old hor∣ses shoes; instead of giving hard dollars for their lands, or mortgaging their property to save their credit; they would have nothing more to do, but to order their servant to pull off an old shoe off one of their horses feet, or take a string of beads from little Miss Polly; pay for their lands, and lift their notes. The streets of our city would not then be so croud∣ed, with the pious horse-stealers from Connec∣ticut; gathering up every bit of old iron they
<PB N="64" REF="030155_0063_0FE4B0FF0850B920"/>
could find. But instead of them we would see Messrs. M—s, N—n, old Doctor R—n, N—ls, the expatriated viscount, and the gal∣lant Mr. G—f all the way from New-York; dispersed through the different streets of our city, scraping the dirt, and gathering up every bit of old iron they could find. Why not? when it would pay for their lands, and prevent them from mortgaging one part to save the o∣ther. The beautiful and all-accomplished Mr. G—f, with his rosy cheeks, would not then be under the dire necessity of purchasing India muslins, on security and long credit, from a certain mercantile house in this city; and send them the next day to vendue, to sell for what they could bring. His matrimonial attach∣ment prevents him from returning to Amster∣dam, to renew his speculations there; for it is said, when there, that he loved with all the <HI>ar∣dor</HI> of a Russian. Nevertheless, I will venture to affirm, that his Amsterdam speculation was the best he ever made; be this as it may, it is pretty generally understood, that a certain bru∣nette has often exclaimed with a heavy heart, in the language of one of Dryden's females, "our thoughtless giddy sex, is caught by out∣ward form, and empty noise, and loses itself in man." There is, notwithstanding, one thing yet remaining, to be said, of this <HI>virtuous</HI> friend of Porcupine's—this <HI>honorable</HI> member of the speculating order; but until things are more fully explained, and the friends of — have spirit to vindicate their personal honour; it

would be cruel to confound the innocent with the guilty. For cowards they must be who would not shed their last best drop, to wipe a∣way an ignominious stain.—Ten or twelve thousand pounds!

But to use a phrase of Mr. Porcupine's, "upon my soul," I believe there is a number, besides Mr. G—f, and Master B—, who would deposit their hearts in a close-stool, instead of a glove; if they could by that means obtain 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> And John Fenno would publish calumnies against the Republicans, tell lies on the French, and sing psalms until his beard would grow as long

<P>In his Censor of April, page 133, Porcupine observes, that in the Philadelphia Gazette of last year, he found the following words made use of by Mr. Giles, in the debate on the al∣lowances to members of Congress. "Mr. Giles said there was a country, from which America copied a great deal too much. The members of the British house of commons re∣ceived no wages, while the officers of state had immense salaries. It was, however, under∣stood that the British house of commons were very well paid; he did not wish to see scenes of that kind introduced into this country. It was, I think, very uncivil in you Mr. Giles, to mention the word "scenes," as all men suppose you meant scenes of bribery and cor∣ruption; and what honest man ever doubted, that such scenes were practised by the British. It was, notwithstanding, unpolite to press so hard upon Mr. Porcupine's sores; that he has such sores, the following sentence fully evin∣ces; it needs no comment; "now, says he, would it, I wonder, be permitted me to ask this talkative gentleman, what he means by "scenes." He then goes on with his intero∣gatories; If, says he, this were permitted, I would go on, and ask him what he meant by copying too much from Great-Britain." In the next sentence he means to quibble, or ap∣pear witty, or say something to the disadvan∣tage
<PB N="67" REF="030155_0066_0FE4B10959BD6AA0"/>
of Mr. Giles; but his idea was certainly too complex, his feeble faculties must have been strained, he could not therefore develope it; and he sinks into such unintelligible jargon, that Des Carte, if he were living, could not explain. It is as follows, "If he himself, speaking of Mr. Giles, be a copy of some original from that country, (Britain) which I believe to be the case, in this instance I shall not contend, that we have copied too much." To say that we have copied Mr. Giles from some original in England; is as mere nonsense, in the common acceptation of the word, as ever was uttered; we might say with some propriety of thought, that Mr. Giles him∣self imitated, or copied some original person, or great orator in that country, had he ever been there; but to say that we have copied him, is altogether nonsense. For a man of Mr. Giles's superior abilities to think of imitating the Englishmen, who come into this country, its entirely out of the question; its what no man in his senses would ever think of doing; except some silly Scotchman, who was too la∣zy to work and wished to become either a knave, or a drunkard. "Again, says Porcupine, I would ask him,"—notwithstanding all this bombast of Peter's, I will venture to affirm, that if he met Mr. Giles fifty times in the streets, he would not dare ask him a syllable; but sa∣tan like, conscious of superior worth, he would stand abashed and hang his guilty head. "A∣gain, says Porcupine, I would ask him, how
<PB N="68" REF="030155_0067_0FE4B10AE9615E58"/>
he came to understand that the members of the British house of Commons were very well paid, or in other words corrupted by the king? he knows how severely I could retort upon him here. I could dare him to a comparison." Lord have mercy on us! how Peter brandish∣eth his sword! he puts me in mind of certain gentlemen, upon a late expedition, who ex∣claimed, "shew us the fellows, and we will skewer them! we want neither Judge nor Ju∣ry!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Findley's History of the Western Insurrection.</NOTE> Peter brandisheth his sword, turns short upon his heel, and whispers softly in Ben's ear; never mind me, you know it is the act of a Briton, to bluster and threaten; but it often Ben serves our purpose. As Mr. Giles's time and attention are occupied, on subjects of too much importance to the community at large; to answer such impertinent, silly questions; I will undertake to inform Mr. Porcupine, where he may <HI>understand</HI> that the British house of Commons are very well paid. Let him read the Patriot, or the Political, Moral and Philo∣sophical Repository published in London by G. G. and J. Robinson; also M'Pherson's and Torcy's memoirs, which he will find in the house of every honest citizen; but that may be a reason, why he will not read them. He may likewise read, "a statement of facts pub∣lished, in 1795, by Mr. Morgan F. R. S." in which he will find, among other items, that 150.000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling have been appropriated by the British government to secret service money.

Now Porcupine be for once an honest candid fellow, and declare upon your conscience, for your friends will not like you the worse, I do not mean that conscience of yours which is like a piece of gum-elastic, that stretches or contracts itself, as circumstances may require; that is when you abuse Messrs. Madison, Giles, Gallatin, Livingston, and Swanwick, it expands to such a length, so as to loose all sensibility, and then you can afford to let slip a thousand lies; and when you speak of Messrs. Sedgwick, Ames, Buck, and Count Murray with his red whiskers, from Maryland; it becomes so con∣tracted, that not even one little one can get e∣scaping; notwithstanding your great propensi∣ty to falsehood. But Peter, I mean your Sun∣day conscience, the conscience you know you go to church with; for since you have abused Doctor Franklin for irreligion, we all suppose you must be a very pious man; and like the Pharisees of old, I expect to find you and John Fenno, fulfilling your duty in the public streets and highways; thanking God that you are not as other men are, understrappers, false-story-tellers, calumniators, sycophants and extortion∣ers. Now Peter, candidly declare, upon this Sunday conscience of yours, that you do not receive any part of the 150,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> granted by the British parliament, as secret service money, from the hands of a certain agent residing in this city; for abusing the Republican party in Congress, and the citizens generally throughout the United States; and to enable you to ad∣vance
<PB N="70" REF="030155_0069_0FE4B10EF5E97BB0"/>
600 dollars to your friend Mr. Olden, as rent of a house to open a book-store. This will afford you a better opportunity of scrib∣bling, in support of the British faction; and spreading your nefarious principles; paving the way to a monarchial government. For you dare not attack the principles of a republican government, openly and avowedly; but endea∣vor to cast an odium on the principles of republicanism, by your illiberal and vulgarly abuse of the members individually; whether in Congress, or throughout the United States. For all men are not capable of distinguishing between men and principles; neither are you yourself, capable of making that necessary di∣stinction; for we often find you when you speak of a certain party, loose sight of your own avowed principles; and fall into the most ab∣surd inconsistencies. And so it is, with the party to whom you have attached yourself; for in debating on the principles of government, and the rights of the citizen; they deny that any part of the citizens have the right to give instructions to a deputy;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Universal Geography, Vol. I. page 305</NOTE> but when those ve∣ry men obtain a place in government, and are acting in a legislative capacity; if they receive petitions, which are but instructions expressed in milder terms, in support of their favourite measures, they bring those very petitions for∣ward, in proof of the necessity of adopting them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Smith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speech of S. C. on the treaty.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="030155_0070_0FE4B116DB1C0870"/>The scurrilous and common-place epithets of mob, banditti, &amp;c. which Porcupine has so lavished, upon the great body of the Ameri∣can citizens; must be disgusting to every man of sentiment, be his principles whatever they may. Such epithets may serve to irritate the citizens, but will never convince them; for they are repugnant to every principle of com∣mon sense, and common decency; and are proofs only of a cankered heart, inflated with pride. A people who, from principles of gra∣titude and similarity of principles in govern∣ment, are attached to the French nation. And if they be attached to the French nation, it is certainly none of Porcupine's business; he is not a native, neither is he a citizen, according to his own exposition of things; why then as∣sume the air of a dictator, and tell the citizens who they are to love, and who they are to hate? Such conduct exhibits, a degree of arro∣gance, and presumption, which we could ex∣pect only from an Englishman. For Porcupine has taught us, that it is an Englishman only, who would be capable of preaching the doc∣trine of ingratitude. When other foreigners arrive in this country they act with some mo∣desty; they take no decided part in politics, until they have become citizens: But no soon∣er has an Englishman arrived upon our shores, than he commences paragraphist in our news∣papers, if he be capable of aranging his thoughts, abusing the French nation, and the citizens ge∣nerally throughout the United States; for be∣ing
<PB N="72" REF="030155_0071_0FE4B118644245B8"/>
attached to them: Or if he be not capable of expressing his thoughts in correct language, he is sure to make noise enough at a town-meeting. Mr. S. Claypoole can testify to the truth of what is here advanced, that at the last town-meeting which was held in the City-hall, for nominating candidates to the federal House of Representatives; a certain young English∣man, who assumes by his air and strut, no small degree of consequence amongst us, was standing upon a bench along side of him, when a certain gentleman's name was proposed as a candidate; the young Englishman instantly be∣gan hissing, with great violence; and turning round to Mr. Claypoole, insisted on him to join in the hiss. Mr. Claypoole, with true republi∣can dignity, declined degrading himself by imitating an animal, which nobody would imi∣tate, except an Englishman. If these gentle∣men, at the next town-meeting, when they propose to offer Mr. Latimer as a candidate in opposition to Mr. Swanwick, would imitate the brayings of an ass; it would perhaps be more congenial to their intellectual faculties. But this despicable, as well as many other vul∣gar practices, is the blessed effects of our inti∣mate connection with England. For there are some amongst us, who shew such a passion for every thing that is English; that I believe in my soul, they would even * * * * * * * * aye, and old men too! turn macaronies, and walk the streets in bob-tailed coats. I repeat again, that it is no Englishman's bu∣siness
<PB N="73" REF="030155_0072_0FE4B119EE72E650"/>
who the American citizens esteem, or who they disesteem. For to attempt to alien∣ate or restrain the affections of the heart, in the fulfilment of its duty; is a degree of tyranny too brutal and absurd, even to enter the mind of a Dyonisius. I have already said, that the attachment of the American citizens, to the French nation, arose from principles of grati∣tude and similarity of principles in govern∣ment; and not as Porcupine wishes to insinu∣ate, because they have guillotined their king, and a set of avaricious, unprincipled and vici∣ous aristocrats; who attempted to subvert the liberties of the people. The Americans have never shewn a disposition to interfere, in the internal government of any country. I am convinced, and I believe, I know as many of the peoples sentiments as Porcupine; that it was, and is, a matter of indifference to the great body of the American citizens; whether the French guillotined their king and nobles, or sent them to the glacial promontery in Asia, to brouze with the goats amongst the rocks; or to the plains of Dalmatia Nebuchadnezzar-like, to feed with the beasts of the field; or did with them as your countrymen Porcupine, of∣ten do with themselves, put a halter about their neck. "In the gloomy month of November, says Voltaire, when Englishmen hang them∣selves;" and I will add, the redoubtable Duke of York ran away from Flanders; Frenchmen walk out and take the air, well may we ex∣claim, wonderful people! whilst Englishmen
<PB N="74" REF="030155_0073_0FE4B11C7126B7C8"/>
are hanging themselves upon the borders of their fens, and marshes; or behind their barns, and in their necessaries; with the same delibe∣ration as an Irishman would hang his unruly dog, for killing his neighbour's sheep.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The London newspapers which were brought to this city, by the spring vessels, announced to the world, that 250 Englishmen hung them∣selves, in the course of a few days, in and about London. This shocking instance of human frailty, was said to be owing, to their disappointment with regard to the lottery. If the English had such a man, at the head of their lottery, as Mr. Blodget who would sport with their property, and their patience; as much and as long, as Blodget has done with the citizens of the United States; Query, to what lengths would the suicide have extended? There is no calculating, if some honest sturdy drayman, for humanity sake, would not put a halter about his neck. What honor does this man reflect upon the President, and the federal city?</NOTE></P>
<P>In his Censor of May, Porcupine observes, in a dirty insinuating manner, that a French∣man carried about the petition against the treaty. The services which that gentleman rendered to the citizens of Philadelphia, du∣ring the calamity of 1793, can never be for∣gotten; except by a Porcupine, or an old hy∣pocritical Quaker, whose principles may easily be resolved into something worse, than mere selfishness. But will any man of sense, who is not blinded by party and prejudice, say that it was more criminal in a Frenchman, who is bona side a citizen of the United States, and carries on an extensive trade, by which he con∣tributes twenty times more to the support of government, than Porcupine and old Ben to∣gether. I say was it more criminal in him to carry about a petition against the treaty, than for an old tory to carry one about in support of it, who has been through the late revolution no∣toriously
<PB N="75" REF="030155_0074_0FE4B121E87FBCA0"/>
attached to the British; and whate∣ver his circumstances may be, from his situa∣tion in life, does not contribute half the sum that the other does to the support of govern∣ment. Of this old tory, who sometimes assumes the garb and language of a Quaker, the following anecdote is in circulation; which shews in a striking point of view, the manoeu∣vres and artifices practised by his party; when they wish to carry a favorite measure. Being on his tour through the northern parts of the city, soliciting subscribers in support of the treaty, he stept into a Mr. B—'s, and asked was he at home; there was none present but a young girl about sixteen or seventeen, who told him her papa had stepped out; old trim pau∣sed a little, then asked her could she write, she answered in the affirmative; "Well friend, what is thy name," Nancy replied the girl; "Nancy, continues old hypocrisy, N. will also stand for Nathan, which is a respectable scrip∣ture name." The old serpent then pulled out his subscription-paper, "friend, says he, will thee sign thy name to this paper;" the innocent girl told him, it was what she never did to any paper of the kind, for she was sure her papa would be displeased with her, "Friend, continues the old serpent, thee does not under∣stand me, thee may set down N. for thy first name, and annex to it the other; and people will generally read it Nathan. It is customary for our wives, and daughters to do so; on certain pressing occasions, and it will be no

harm for thee to do the same; thee knows I would not suffer any of female friends to so, if I thought it were criminal." The girl look∣ed at him all this time, with a stedfastness mixed with surprize, until he had done speak∣ing; when she replied, "Sir, I think, you are the man my papa has often pointed out to me, as the associate of Roberts and Carlisle; who were executed here during the late revolution for toryism; and some months after my papa had returned from the battle of Monmouth, it was generally believed that you would share their fate also." The simple unaffected man∣ner in which she expressed these sentiments, struck old broadbrim quite silent: he said not a word in reply, but pulled down his hat over his face; and it is confidently affirmed, that this was the first time he was ever known to blush; or his rigid nerves were agitated. He put his brief in his pocket, and walked off repining, no doubt, at his unlucky stars; for suffering him to act so incautiously. Aristocratic arti∣fice, is like the pitcher that goes too often to the pump, it will be broken sometime. The above transaction brings to my recollection, the following lines of Milton's Paradise Lost.</P>

he may, jackal-like, furnish Porcupine, that poisonous, bloody-minded monster, with mat∣ter for ridicule, and vulgar abuse.</P>
<P>But to sum up all, on the present occasion, with regard to Porcupine and his friends—the former, through the whole of his writings, ridicules the republican party, for the empti∣ness of their purses; and calls them a set of "poor devils." When we consider, that his principles, on his arrival in this country, and for some time after, were republican.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is a fact which Porcupine cannot deny, for he is still well known to several gentlemen who lodged, and were intimate in the house where be lodged, in Pine-street, immediately after his arrival in this city; "and he was then, say they, so warm a republican, and an admirer of Paine's writings; that his Rights of Man were seldom out of his hands."</NOTE> We may justly infer, that he first offered his ser∣vices to that party; so that his principles and interest, might go hand in hand; or how could he pretend to know the depth of their purses. Riches do not consist in a well trimmed coat—a powdered head—a pair of large whis∣kers—a gilded chariot—a well chosen spencer —or a pompous building: he must have lived a short time in Philadelphia, who does not see the truth of this remark. These are childish trifles, and rarely occupy the attention of re∣publicans. How then could he ascertain the wealth of the republican party? the answer is obvious, because they would not purchase him; hence he infers <HI>they are poor.</HI> But undue in∣fluence, or secret service money being contrary to the principles of republicans, they would not therefore take him into pay; Peter's self-pride

was wounded, and what will not a proud man do, to seek revenge, when his overtures are neglected, or a slight indignity offered to his imaginary consequence: the story of Ha∣man is a striking proof. From these observa∣tions we will easily find a solution for the scur∣rilities and unmanly abuse; which he has poured upon Mr. Madison, Giles, Gallatin, Swanwick, and Livingston: these gentlemen possessing less of that fastidious pride, which distinguishes many of our well-born; and be∣ing easier of access, he expected they would have taken him into pay; but Peter was mis∣taken in his judgment of human nature, when he supposed that simplicity and sociability of manners, were connected with corruptness of principles. Their cause was good—they sought for no hireling scribe—no wha-wants-me; to blazon their motives, and sound their trump of fame. But whether the republican party be poor, or rich; or whatever their circum∣stances may be, what property they possess, I may with confidence affirm, is their own—it is real—their wealth is not imaginary, depend∣ing upon a precarious credit with the banks, subject to the whims and caprice of the direc∣tors. A hard boiled egg, or a tainted oyster, in the stomach of one of these gentlemen, may blast such a man's reputation for ever. For it is well known that these create indigestion; and indigestion, to a man of delicate nerves, perverts his understanding, renders him peev∣ish, fretful and captious; and excites in his
<PB N="81" REF="030155_0080_0FE4B133E802A148"/>
mind, a thousand absurd prejudices; like a man possessed with the jaundice, he sees every object through a false medium. When to these observations we add, the manner of transact∣ing business at the banks; the truth of my remark must appear still more unquestionable. The directors assemble together, and resolve upon discounting a certain sum; the assistant cashier, or some other, collects the notes pre∣sented for discount, and reads in an audible voice, each note; after which he asks in the same tone, "if this man be good;" here is a full opportunity, for a mind fretted by indi∣gestion, to vend its malice and ill nature; if such a one says "no," it inevitably damns the note, as none of the other directors will offer to contradict him; for contradiction creates animosity, and animosity, among the direct∣ors, might lead to the discovery of something serious, and important.</P>
<P>How long will you then my fellow citizens, be gulled by men of such factitious wealth; can truth, honor, and integrity, be no where found but amongst riches! How long will you suf∣fer yourselves to be deluded, by the sportive in∣solence of an hireling scribbler? and suffer him to ridicule the principles of your constitution, which recognizes no distinction among the ci∣tizens; but what arises from a virtuous con∣duct? A hireling wretch, who talks of proper∣ty, whilst he can only obtain it by prostitut∣ing his principles. A fraudulent British mer∣cenary, who holds up his countrymen agents,
<PB N="82" REF="030155_0081_0FE4B135708D3300"/>
and merchants, with Jay and Hamilton at their head; as the standard of all that is dis∣interested and patriotic; in opposition to the great body of the American citizens, whom he occasionally stiles, mob, banditti, &amp;c. Let us take a view of those individually, who com∣pose this class whom he extols, for the silence of Porcupine is praise, and two thirds of them we will find to be men, without either geni∣us, or abilities, who sprang from poverty, and now grown fat in opulence, bask in the sun∣shine of presidential favor; sneering at the dis∣pised, but virtuous poverty of their old associ∣ates. Among these fat-fisted lords of America, have we not seen some whose insatiable thirst for riches, and speculation, overreached their credit? in consequence of which, have we not seen their notes fly about the streets of Phila∣delphia, like chaff before the wind, or bub∣bles light as air? Among these have we not seen bank directors, turn private brokers, pro∣cure discounts at the banks for their friends, and afterwards charge those very friends with the moderate sum of thirty per cent?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How far the foregoing is a fabrication, I refer the reader to the re∣ports which were circulating through town, at the last election for di∣rectors to the bank of the United States. The stock holders were so well convinced, that these manoeuvres were practised, that all the former di∣rectors were turned out; except four, or five. Yet I do not mean to in∣sinuate, that the present directors are men of stricter integrity than the former; the next election will bear testimony of their probity.</NOTE> And among these have we not seen others, when it suited their private interest, kick honesty out of doors and lock them—turn bankrupts to day, pay off their creditors to-morrow with two shil∣ling
<PB N="83" REF="030155_0082_0FE4B13EFB66C1B0"/>
and six-pence in the pound; and set up a coach the third day? These are Englishmen, the friends of Englishmen—and the support∣ers of the English faction throughout the U∣nited States; but if a t—rd, much less a knave came from England; by my soul, I be∣lieve, either would smell sweet to the nose of Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and many of the well born here.</P>
