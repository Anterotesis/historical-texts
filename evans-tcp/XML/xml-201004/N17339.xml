<P>IN <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e town of <HI>Cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et,</HI> thirteen miles south-west of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> lately li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. Mr. THOMAS CHAMBERLAIN who was a worthy and able Divine, and had been a faithful Minister of that church twen∣ty years; all which time he behaved him∣self as a good Shepherd to his flock▪ pres∣sing them on by the rules of the Gospel, to the practice of a christian life. But o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sixth of September, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, at night, as he was praying at his chamber-window facing his garden, that joined the church-yard, he saw round the same a bright shining light and several persons in glorious app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="4" REF="022398_0004_0FB87A6C80C6DE28"/>
walking therein, and heard a ravishing sound of musick, with melodious voices singing praise to the Most High GOD: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> length one, like a Husbandman, warned him of his Death, and told him still to do the will of the LORD, for in seven days shalt thou be with him in the blessed man∣sions of the kingdom of Heaven, and fully possess those joys, whereof thou hast now but a taste; but before that time comes the LORD will declare unto thee what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about to do to the inhabitants of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this will come to pass.</P>
<P>On the tenth, at night, walking in the same garden, praying and singing Psalms, he was seized with a great drowsiness, and cried out, I will lay myself down and take my rest, for the LORD is my shield and defence; he was taken in a Trance, where he lay several hours, until his wife came to him at his customary hours of praying in the garden. She endeavoured to awake him, but all in vain. After she had waited about three or four hours, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sudden start be awaked, and sighing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried out with tears, O my good LORD! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave me not, I beseech thee. Then turn∣ing

to his Wife, cried out, My Dear, had you seen where I was, you would ever ad∣mire the infinite goodness of God. She asked him what he had seen? He an∣swered glory inexpressible, which I am not to discover until the next LORD'S Day in the Pulpit.</P>
<P>After this he bought a very plain shroud and coffin, and ordered his grave to be made, and then invited his Parishoners to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome and hear his last Sermon, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preached the Sunday following, having his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roud on and coffin before him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n declared his vision: How he saw Death riding in triumph upon a pale horse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the message he had given him to warn the inhabitants of the earth, and of his dying in his Pulpit.</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="022398_0006_0FB87A6F7A44C368"/>When he had delivered the same, he got up into the Pulpit and exhorted them to give good heed to his words, and ponder them in their heart: After which he pro∣ceeded as follows:</P>

<P>WHEN my senses were lulled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and my soul, as it were, had ta∣ken its flight into another world, I was kindly saluted by the same Person that had warned me of my Death; with him were two others cloathed all in white, having crowns of gold upon their heads, who welcomed me with, "Thou blessed of the LORD," and bid me drink freely of the cup of salvation; then was I led by him to a gentle ascent, where I beheld the heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the glory of GOD, the walls thereof were of chry∣stal, and the City of pure gold; it was four-square, and each square had three gates, and the foundation of the walls

of the City were garnished with all manner of precious stones, and the streets of the City were of pure gold: One of my Guides said, this is the City of God; it has no need of the sun nor moon to shine on it, for the glory of God doth enlighten it, and none can enter it but such as are his, whose names are written in the Book of life. O Lord, I beseech thee, said I, permit thy servant to enter in. That thou shalt do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Angel, but thou must first die in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heart, and then shalt thou enjoy a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Saints, and take pos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the glories laid up for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly love him.

God. Then taking me down the hill o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he bid me look on my left hand, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had a most dreadful prospect of the bottomless pit, burning with fire and brimstone, which put me into a great trembling, because I saw a great many Devils on the first brink thereof, some of which offered to catch me: But the Angel bid me take courage, for they could not hurt me: and looking a little more earnestly on them, I per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eiv'd the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were chain'd, which gave me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> assurance.

to be had, nor ease to their torments. Consider this, my beloved, even while I am with you, and lay it to heart whilst you have time to repent, and God is now ready to receive and pardon every penitent sin∣ner: Let the consideration of Hells tor∣ments stir you up to make your peace with God, before you go hence and be no more seen; if not your portion will be with those miserable souls who partake of the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, never to be quenched. Many of you are hearty and lusty now, but none know how soon the God of Heaven may visit you with a death-bed sickness, or strike you with sudden death; therefore receive this as a warning from a tender and most mer∣ciful Father, who desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he would turn from his wickedness and live. That what I have now said is true you need not doubt, for you see my shroud on and my coffin be∣fore me, the grave ready open to receive me, and in some few minutes I shall be no more in this world: and what torments can be severe enough for me, should I de∣part with a lie in my mouth.</P>
<P>Now, said my Holy Guide, thou hast
<PB N="10" REF="022398_0010_0FB87A76F9BED640"/>
seen the inexpressible joys of the blessed, and intolerable torments of the damned, I'll lead thee to one place more and then dis∣patch thee with the Lord's message to the inhabitants of the earth: So taking me by my hand be led me to a deep valley called the valley of the shadow of death, lying be∣tween the Holy City and the place of the damned; there did I see death in all its tri∣umph; there was the Prince and the Beggar, the Rich and the Poor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lving equal; the haughty Lawyer, huffing Courtier and the griping Usurer made no greater figure there than the meanest Peasant or poorest Beggar. There did those faces and bodies that had been decked and enriched with the most costly jewels and ornaments for beauty, lie unregarded, with no other pomp, and atten∣dance to wait on them than the dust, and the worms had equally made the same prey up∣on them: Those faces that have often ad∣mired themselves in the glass, there lay pu∣trified with the small-pox, or other nause∣ous distempers. The poorest body, who on earth appeared ever so despicable in the eyes of the rich, here looked as lovely as the greatest Potentate. Death then mounted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his pale horse, appeared in all
<PB N="11" REF="022398_0011_0FB87A7BC8291898"/>
his trophies, arrayed in all points with most mortal weapons: His attendants were the small-pox, fevers, plagues, sores and other contagious distempers, and ten thousand other instruments, with which he trium∣phed over all nations, sexes and ages: While I beheld this sight, I saw Death ap∣proach towards us, and though he was cloathed in so many frightful shapes, I was not afraid of him. I also saw my Holy Guide give him new commissions, which as soon as he had received he flew as quick as lightning to dispatch one of them; and he that held me by the hand seeing me take notice of this, Thou Holy Man, wilt thou understand what the Lord is about to do? The commissions thou seest me diliver Death are commissions at large; he has now power to wound the sons and daughters of men, for the Lord is angry with the inhabitants of the earth for their abominable and crying sins, and he will avenge himself. They murmer against me, saith the Lord, when any calamity doth befall them, or when any plagues, sick∣ness or war oppresses them; or when they have scarcity of grain, or want the fruits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he earth, not considering their sin is the
<PB N="12" REF="022398_0012_0FB87A7DBA196DA8"/>
cause why the Lord punishes the land for them. Blasphemies, idolatries, drun∣kenness, adulteries, cursing, swearing, ly∣ing, cheating, pride, gluttony, covetous∣ness, wantonness and many other heinous crimes; for all which GOD will surely punish them. He will begin to lay his hand upon them, by causing wars to break out amongst them, and let them know, that if they do not seek the Lord and re∣pent of their wickedness, that the Lord will further afflict and punish them; for tell them what an angry God can do: He can visit all the corners of the earth, he can send the plague, pestilence, famine and more bloody wars, as so many scourges for their crying sins. Return, therefore, with this message to the children of disobedience, and say, that I, saith the Lord, have seen the oppression of the land, the enmity and hatred between the people, devouring each other with malice; the cries of the poor have reached mine ears, and I will be avenged of them who grind the face of the poor: I will have the poor redressed, the fa∣therless relieved, and they that are afflicted comforted; the abominations of the earth are great, <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gommorrah, Tyre</HI> and <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> sinned not more than they.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="022398_0013_0FB87A813274B7B0"/>For thus the Lord said, they have abused his mercies and slighted his love, dis∣regarded his calls, contemned his reproofs, refused his offers, tired his patience, insulted his Messengers, despised his counsels, ne∣glected his warnings, disobeyed his com∣mandments, broken their repeated promises of amendment of life, and highly affronted his divine Majesty, who will surely visit for such their iniquities; what calls, what in∣vitations, what offers of love and mercy have they slighted and contemned. How has he fed and cloathed them, preserv∣ing them in all times of adversity, fought their battles, humbled their enemies, fil∣led their vineyards, plentifully stored their fields with corn, blessed and replenished the earth with all things by his divine Pro∣vidence, and yet they forget God, by not returning thanks for such benefits; and now let them turn to God, by repentance before it is too late; remember how God spared <HI>Ninevah,</HI> because they sincerely turned from their evil ways, and repented in sackcloth and ashes, so God will likewise shew mer∣cy to them if they repent. Depart now thou Holy Man; be thou the Messenger of this, and make known what thou hast seen
<PB N="14" REF="022398_0014_0FB87A823A7D2500"/>
and heard to the inhabitants of the earth. The Lord hath found thee righteous in his sight; be faithful until death, and thou shalt have a crown of life: For on the thirteenth day of the month, and ninth hour of the day, thou shalt be with the Lord, and receive the reward of come ye blessed, and enter into the joy of thy Lord.</P>
<P>Then leading me to the place they found me in, I heard most ravishing music from the holy City, with which I began to sing praises to the Lord, and then awaked. Thus, beloved, I have made known to you the will of the Lord: I beseech you, when I am in the grave, to spread this abroa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that all the earth may repent of their sins.</P>
<P>Serve the Lord, and in time avert these impending judgments from falling upon you: You see daily how the Lord visits you, and how many go to their graves in their prime; you see how death triumphs and visits you, and the small-pox, fevers, falling sickness, blotches, bloody swellings and bloody wars, are the harbingers to bring you to your graves; delay no time to seek God's mercy and loving kindness while it is called to-day, least it be too late to-morrow. Live in brotherly love and
<PB N="15" REF="022398_0015_0FB87A83D6F983F8"/>
charity one to another; let no difference in opinion cause hatred among you; do good to your poor Brethen, especially those that are of the houshold of faith, not Cris∣tians only in name but in deed; relieve the poor, for in so doing you lend to the Lord. Grudge not, though your neighbour be rich∣er than you, and to get to Heaven, learn to do good for evil, and strive in what sta∣tion God has allotted you, to be therein contented. My spirits begin to faint; let my Death be a witness to you all what I say is true, and then the good God be with you, comfort and preserve you in this world, and at the last bring you to his everlasting King∣dom. O my dear Saviour, now I come, I come, open thy arms to receive my poor soul. Uttering of which words, he im∣mediately dropped down in his Pulpit, which caused almost all the people to give a great outcry; they brought him down and laid him in his coffin. He was aged fifty-five years.—Now let us join with one heart and one mind, and say, from sword, pestilence and famine, from battle, mur∣der, and from sudden death good Lord deliver us. AMEN.</P>
