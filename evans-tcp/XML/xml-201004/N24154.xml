<HEAD><HI>PORCUPINE's</HI> POLITICAL CENSOR, FOR JANUARY, 1797.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">REMARKS ON THE PROCEEDINGS IN CONGRESS. JANUARY 20.</HEAD>
<P>THE following message from the President of the United States was communicated to the two Houses.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the opening of the present session of Congress, I mentioned that some circumstances of an unwelcome na∣ture had lately occurred in relation to France; that our trade had suffered, and was suffering, extensive injuries in the West Indies from the cruizers and agents of the French Republic; and that communications had been received from its minister here which indicated danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority, and that
<PB N="4" REF="031946_0003_0FEF5C66F371E430"/>
were, in other respects, far from agreeable: but that I reserved for a special message, a more particular commu∣nication on this interesting subject. This communication I now make.</P>
<P>The complaints of the French minister embraced most of the transactions of our government in relation to France, from an early period of the present war; which, therefore, it was necessary carefully to review. A col∣lection has been formed of letters and papers relating to those transactions, which I now lay before you, with a letter to Mr. Pinckney, our minister at Paris, containing an examination of the notes of the French minister, and such information as I thought might be useful to Mr. Pinckney, in any further representations he might find ne∣cessary to be made to the French government. The im∣mediate object of his mission was to make to that govern∣ment such explanations of the principles and conduct of our own, as, by manifesting our good faith, might remove all jealousy and discontent, and maintain that harmony and good understanding with the French Republic, which it has been my constant solicitude to preserve. A govern∣ment which required only a knowledge of the <HI>truth,</HI> to jus∣tify its measures, could not but be anxious to have this ful∣ly and frankly displayed.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>To give the <HI>letter,</HI> accompanying this message, is impossible; nor would its insertion here, per∣haps, answer any useful purpose; as it has alrea∣dy been published both in the public papers and in a pamphlet. It is, however, necessary to ob∣serve, that it should be read and well remember∣ed by every one, who is interested in the honour and happiness of this country. <HI>Adet's</HI> charges against the Federal government, which were com∣batted in the November Censor, have here met
<PB N="5" REF="031946_0004_0FEF5C781BCE7820"/>
with a more ample refutation; reasoning that ne∣ver can be overturned, because founded on facts that never can be denied. The motives of the insidious friendship of the French, from first to last, are completely unveiled: in place of a debt of gratitude, it is now clear that America owes them nothing but resentment and contempt: re∣sentment for their treachery and contempt for their threats.</P>
<P>As a composition, this letter reflects great ho∣nour on the writer. Mr. Pickering as been con∣temptuously called a successor <HI>in form</HI> to the late Secretary of State; but, the judicious arrange∣ment, the perspicuous style and the manly sen∣timents of this voluminous state paper, shows that he is not a successor either in form or in substance to the bungling and prevaricating Randolph.</P>
<P>Upon the reasonable supposition, that very few, if any of my readers, ever see the Gallician Ga∣zette of Benjamin Franklin Bache, it may not be amiss to take notice of the censure with which this clumsy tool of an unprincipled faction has ho∣noured the publication of Mr. Pickering's letter.</P>
<Q><P>The Executive pretended that they wish to preserve a good understanding with the French Republic, and yet they are pursuing every mode which can have a <HI>tendency to embroil us with that country.</HI> The letter of <HI>man Timothy</HI> to Mr. PINCKNEY is a strong evidence of this intention. This letter endeavours insidiously to criminate the Republic for the conduct of the monarchy, and con∣tains as <HI>much irritation as could be conveyed from the admi∣nistration.</HI> What is most remarkable is, that the letter is designed as a guide to our minister, and yet is pub∣lished here <HI>before</HI> it can have possibly reached France,
<PB N="6" REF="031946_0005_0FEF5C7B6B74AA10"/>
and indeed when it must be believed that the publica∣tion and the letter itself will reach that country at the same time. Is the matter or manner of this letter in the style of conciliation?</P>
<P>Does it not, on the contrary, breathe a disposition to excite new recriminations on the part of the Directory? Does it not seem designed to close the door of amicable accommodation? Would the publication have been made, unless there existed a disposition in our govern∣ment to put France at defiance? If accommodation was the object, would the <HI>reflections have been made public against the French nation?</HI> That a letter designed as a kind of instruction to our minister should have been made public <HI>before</HI> it reached him, is one among the ab∣surdities which have characterised the administration.— If a restoration of harmony was in the serious contem∣plation of the Executive, he would have transmitted the letter and have kept the Directory ignorant of its irri∣tating contents until every prospect of accommodation was at an end, and <HI>then it would have been time enough to make it known in justification of the administration;</HI> but to do it at this time strongly implies a disposition to excite such resentments as shall put reconciliation en∣tirely out of the question. It has ever been the opini∣on of those who observed the conduct of the Executive, that they were the enemies of the French Republic, their declarations to the contrary notwithstanding, and if any additional evidence was necessary to establish the belief, the letter to Mr. PINCKNEY will not leave a doubt on the mind of any unprejudiced American.</P></Q>
<P>Does not this sound well from the man, who justified Citizen Adet's contemptuous appeal from the government to the people? Who published that appeal, and who, lest its seditious tendency should be defeated by delay, published an abstract of it, with a commentary still more inflammatory than the appeal itself?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031946_0006_0FEF5CA31A714598"/>The French have a right to do whatever they please: insult, beat, tread upon: brave the go∣vernment, accuse it of every crime that malice can invent; but the government of the United States must not think of retaliating, nor even of justifying itself to those, before whom it has been so falsely and insolently accused! The <HI>suspended</HI> Adet tells the people of America, and the whole world, that the Federal Government has issued a declaration of <HI>insidious</HI> neutrality; that it acts by <HI>chicane;</HI> that from the courts of justice <HI>no justice is to be expected;</HI> that the treaty with France has been <HI>violated;</HI> that, in short, the conduct of the govern∣ment has been marked by every trait of cowar∣dice and perfidy. The President would have been fully justified in a perfect retaliation; that is, in causing the refutation of these calumnious charges to be published <HI>in France,</HI> and that too in a language equally daring with that of Citizen Adet; but he has thought this beneath the respect due to himself and to the nation with whose con∣fidence he has so long been, and yet is, honoured. He has, therefore, been content with justifying his conduct in the eyes of his constituents. Yet this is too much for the full grown grandchild of Doc∣tor Franklin: it is "irritating," and calculated to "close the door of amicable negociation." It is irritating for a man to deny the falsehoods that have been vomited forth against him, and to prove, to those who has invested him with power, that he has not betrayed his trust.</P>
<P>Novel as this doctrine appears, neither Mr. Bache nor any of his friends can claim the honour of the invention. It is borrowed from the code of the Revolutionary Tribunal of France, that
<PB N="8" REF="031946_0007_0FEF5C7D1405E290"/>
hopper of the famous national mill, vulgarly call∣ed the guillotine. In this bloody court, <HI>no evi∣dence</HI> is heard <HI>in favour of the accused.</HI> As much against him as you please, so that there be no loss of time.</P>
<P>This was the form of process intended for the President and his officers of state. Citizen Adet discharges his duty as <HI>accusateur public,</HI> consigns them over to the "national justice," and his ad∣vocate Citizen Bache now complains, that they have had the impudence to reply.</P>
<P>I shall leave guillotine lawyer Bache to con∣tinue his pleadings and to receive his merited re∣ward, bundles of assignats and millions of honest curses, and shall just take notice of one or two articles of accusation which were not contained in the Diplomatic Blunderbuss, but which have come to light through Mr. Pickering's letter.— <Q>Indeed, says he, the French Minister has discovered an aptitude to complain. I may cite, as instances, his letters of the 9th of Ja∣nuary and 3d of March 1796: the former, be∣cause the colours of France, which he had pre∣sented to the United States, were not <HI>perma∣nently fixed and displayed before Congress:</HI> the latter, because some printers of almanacs or other periodical publications in the United States, in arranging the names of the foreign ministers and agents resident amongst us, <HI>had placed those of Great-Britain before those of France and Spain!</HI> Mr. Adet desired my <HI>declaration in writing</HI> that the government of the United States had no concern in printing the works in which the agents of the French republic were
<PB N="9" REF="031946_0008_0FEF5C7E9C0877C8"/>
registered after those of Great-Britain, and that <HI>the works themselves might be suppressed.</HI> I gave him an answer in writing with my consent to his publishing it in the newspapers, agreeably to his request. The answer states that in mat∣ters of this kind the government did not and could not interfere. With regard to the co∣lours, I must observe, that in what concerns our foreign relations, the President being the sole representative of the people of the United States, they were properly presented to him. He received them with all possible respect, and directed them to be deposited with our national archives, that both might be preserved with equal care.</Q></P>
<P>The flag should, by right, have been permanent∣ly displayed before the eyes of Congress, to re∣mind them of their duty towards the "terrible nation;" but then, the Citizen did not perceive that a great difficulty would have occurred from our having two chambers. To have cut asunder the emblem of fraternal love would have been a portentous sign; and, though the members of the Senate, who would have wished to rally under a sans-culotte rag, were few in number, yet there is no reason to believe that they would have pati∣ently left their friends of the other House in the sole enjoyment of the honourable ombrage. They would have wrangled like the Goddesses for the apple, or, rather, like dogs for a bone. The Pre∣sident, undoubtedly, foresaw this, and therefore he wisely determined to take it from them altogether, and to lock it up safely with the Archives of the United States, where neither moth nor rust, nor any thing else, doth <HI>corrupt.</HI> How different would
<PB N="10" REF="031946_0009_0FEF5CAF5636B4E0"/>
its situation have been, had it remained continual∣ly displayed in the Hall!</P>
<P>If my memory does not deceive me, the Ame∣rican flag was carried to the Convention by Citi∣zen Barney. This man has ever shown an un∣common zeal for the honour of the flag of his country; for, I remember, that he wrote a very pathetic letter from Jamaica, addressed to a mem∣ber of Congress, expressing the grief of his at once noble and tender heart, at seeing the American flag hung up <HI>reversed</HI> under that of Great-Britain, while he himself was in irons, and consequently unable "to avenge his dear country's wrongs." Since those unhappy days Citizen Barney is be∣come a French commodore of two frigates, and will probably rise to the rank of Admiral, if con∣trary winds should not drive him in the way of the cruizers of the enemy. He was sometime skulking about the West-India seas, and <HI>to be re∣venged of the British</HI> for insulting the American flag, what does the brave commodore do, but seize an American merchantman, swing her flag up <HI>re∣versed</HI> under that of France, and clap the captain in irons. There's <HI>retaliation</HI> for you. There's avenging his "dear country's wrongs."!—A few such instances of patriotism will, I hope, convince the British, and every other insolent overbearing nation, that, however vengeance may sleep for a time, the American flag will never be insulted with impunity, while there are Barneys in existence.</P>
<P>To return and take farewel of the French co∣lours; it is well enough to observe, that, on the day or day after, the French Minister made his complaint to the Secretary of State, respecting
<PB N="11" REF="031946_0010_0FEF5C94B7DA5AE8"/>
the fate of the colours, the very same complaint was made in Bache's Gazette. Not that I would insinuate that Mr. Bache is in the pay of the Con∣vention, and that his paper has no other support: the minds of the public have long been made up as to that point. But it is something worth ob∣serving, as it strongly tends to prove, that exactly the same thought may strike, at the same moment, two persons who have <HI>not</HI> the <HI>least</HI> connection with each other.</P>
<P>The complaint against the <HI>Almanac-Makers</HI> has more of the ridiculous in it than any thing to be found on the records of upstart apishness. Be∣cause the despots of Paris had styled themselves the legislators of the Universe, it entered into the sapient skull of Citizen Adet, that they were so in reality, and that, of course, it was a species of treason to rank their agent beneath those of other powers.</P>
<P>This complaint shows how narrowly they watch us. They dog us like our murderers. They are every where, and in every shape. They insinuate themselves into all companies, among every de∣scription of the people. They tent all our actions, words and looks. To rate the number of their spies, spread over the United States, at five thou∣sand, is keeping far within compass.</P>
<P>The demanding of a <HI>positive declaration,</HI> that the government had <HI>no hand in the publications</HI> in question, proves clearly that the Citizen looked upon that government as in a state of absolute de∣pendence on his own; and his requesting that the
<PB N="12" REF="031946_0011_0FEF5C6881A36730"/>
Almanacs, &amp;c. "might be suppressed," gives us a tolerable idea of that liberty of the press, which we shall enjoy, when we fall under the jurisdiction of the French.—"That the works themselves might be <HI>suppressed</HI>"! It would appear that the sun-beams of liberty, that have lately broken in upon the French, have had no very great effect on Citizen Adet. I have always said, that they know nothing of freedom but the name, and here we have a proof of it. The Citizen thought that our government was like his own; that the laws were a mere mockery, and that we were as com∣pletely in bondage as the slaves of Paris, who are led to the guillotine for printing the Lord's Pray∣er or the Decalogue. Poor minister of the "ter∣rible nation"! How must he have smarted at my answer to his Blunderbuss, and how will he smart if he should remain here till I print an Almanac! I will put his name beneath those of the Envoys of the Savages of America; for I am sure every one will allow, that the nations they represent are far more reputable and humane than his. I will range him after Citizens Complanter, Bull-Dog, and Dog's-Head. Should we receive a minister from the Hottentots, who wear unemptied guts round their carcasses, as the more brutish <HI>fonctio∣naires publics</HI> in France do their tricolored scarfs; should we receive a minister from this polite peo∣ple, that of regenerated France shall come after him in my Almanac.</P>
<P>If the Citizen was ignorant enough to suppose, that the government could suppress one publica∣tion, he certainly must believe that its power ex∣tended to others also; and then, how comes it to pass, that he had not demanded the <HI>suppression</HI> of
<PB N="13" REF="031946_0012_0FEF5C6BD0542148"/>
some other works, that I could mention (if I dar∣ed), which seem to be better calculated for giving offence than a poor inoffensive Almanac. But, in these, I suppose, the Citizen found nothing to wound that little something, which, it seems, tic∣kles the hearts of republicans as well as those of royalists. It is diverting enough to see the vanity of a democratic citizen breaking out into com∣plaints about precedence; about the post of ho∣nour in a two-penny Almanac, and an Almanac too of the <HI>"Old Style."</HI> The reptiles that have sprung up out of the ruins of the French nobility, are ten thousand times more bloated with vanity than that nobility, or any other, ever was. They know they are despised, and they wish to obtain by force what the will refuses them. They have fully verified the old maxim: "Set a beggar on horse-back, and he'll ride to the devil."</P>
<P>There are some other facts that Mr. Pickering's letter has brought to light, which will command attention another time; for the present I must leave them, to record an event that reflects as much honour on the people of America as it pro∣mises them prosperity: I mean the election of Mr. John Adams to the office of President of the U∣nited States.</P>

<HEAD>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. FEB. 8TH.</HEAD>
<P>The Speaker informed the House that the hour was come at which they had appointed to meet the Senate, for the purpose of counting the votes for, and declaring the election of a President and Vice-President of the U∣nited States; and that the Clerk would inform the Senate, they were ready to receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031946_0013_0FEF5CC144B23988"/>The Clerk accordingly waited upon the Senate, and the President and Members of the Senate, soon after en∣tered and took their seats, the President on the right hand of the Speaker of the House of representatives, and the Members of the Senate on the same side of the chamber; when the President of the Senate (Mr. Adams) thus ad∣dressed the two Houses:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The purpose for which we are assembled is expressed in the following Resolutions [He here read the resolutions which had been entered into by the two Houses relative to this business]. I have received Packets containing the Certificates of the votes of the Electors for a President and Vice-President of the United States from all the six∣teen States of the Union: I have also received Duplicates of these returns by Post from fifteen of the States. No duplicate from the State of Kentucky is yet come to hand.</P>
<P>It has been the practice heretofore on similar occa∣sions, to begin with the returns from the State at one end of the United States, and to proceed to the other; I shall therefore do the same at this time.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Mr. Adams then took up the packet from the State of Tennessee, and after having read the superscription, broke the seal, and read the certificate of the election of the Electors. He then gave it to the Clerk of the Senate, requesting him to read the report of the Electors, which he accordingly did. All the papers were then handed to the Tellers, viz. Mr. Sedgwick on the part of the Senate, and Messrs, Sitgreaves and Parker on the part of the House of Representatives; and when they had noted the contents, the President of the Senate proceeded with the other States.</P>
<P>All the returns having been gone through, Mr. Sedg∣wick reported, that, according to order, the Tellers ap∣pointed by the two Houses had performed the business as∣signed them, and reported the result.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="031946_0014_0FEF5C9644357FD8"/>Then the President of the Senate addressed the two Houses thus:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By the Report which has been made to me by the Tellers appointed by the two Houses to examine the votes, there are 71 votes for John Adams, 68 for Thomas Jef∣ferson, 59 for Thomas Pinckney, 30 for Aaron Burr, 15 for Samuel Adams, 11 for Oliver Ellworth, 7 for George Clinton, 5 for John Jay, 3 for James Iredell, 2 for George Washington, 2 for John Henry, 2 for Samuel Johnson, and 1 for C. C. Pinckney. The whole num∣ber of votes are 138; 70 votes, therefore, make a ma∣jority; so that the Person who has 71 votes, which is the highest number, is elected President, and the Per∣son who has 68 votes, which is the next highest num∣ber, is elected Vice-President.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>The President of the Senate then sat down for a moment, and rising again, thus addressed the two Houses:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="address">
<P>In obedience to the Constitution and Laws of the United States, and to the commands of both Houses of Congress, expressed in their resolutions passed in the pre∣sent session, I declare that JOHN ADAMS is elected Pre∣sident of the United States, for four years, to commence on the 4th day of March next; and that THOMAS JEF∣FERSON is elected Vice-President of the United States, for four years, to commence on the 4th day of March next. And may the Sovereign of the Universe, the Ordainer of Civil Government on Earth, for the preservation of Li∣berty, Justice and Peace amongst Men, enable them both to discharge the duties of those offices, with conscientious diligence, punctuality and perseverance.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Thus ended the triumph of the cause of order over that of anarchy and confusion; and thus Citizen Adet's Blunderbuss was proved to be an instrument of sound and not of execution.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031946_0015_0FEF5C81253B99D8"/>The friends of America, all over the world, will congratulate her on this event; will applaud the wisdom of her choice. Mr. Adams's learning, his wisdom, and his integrity, are universally known, and as universally acknowledged, except by the partizans of democratic tyranny. To this he has long been a declared and formidable foe, and that he will ever continue so, the steady per∣severance exhibited in his past life is a sufficient security.</P>
<P>At any time whatever, to see such a man at the head of the Federal Government, must have been a source of satisfaction to every well-disposed mind; but at the present crisis it is particularly so. Well assured that he is neither to be deceived nor in∣timidated, the at once insidious and insolent ene∣mies of our prosperity and independence will put on the appearance, at least, of moderation: and though justice for the past is not in their power, they will be deterred from any further commission of injustice. How much they dread his administra∣tion is best determined by their efforts to keep him from the Presidential Chair. They foresaw that his election would be the death-stroke to their intrigues at Philadelphia, and eventually to the propaga∣tion of their abominable principles in this exten∣sive country. That infidels may for once prove prophets, is my sincere and hearty wish, as I believe it is of nine-tenths of the community.</P>
<P>Regarding, as I do, the elevation of Mr. Adams as a national blessing, I should think myself want∣ing in justice to those, to whom (under heaven) we owe it, were I to omit giving their meritorious exertions as much publicity as it lies in my power
<PB N="17" REF="031946_0016_0FEF5C83972FCA80"/>
to give. Under this persuasion, and with this view, it is, that I here insert a return of the votes of the several states; that the reader may see at one glance the proportion of gratitude due to each.— It will be sufficient to give a detail of the votes for Adams and Jefferson only, the rest having been distributed more from policy than choice.</P>

<P>It is a notorious fact, that in this election, the partizans of France, or rather of the French ty∣rants, were ranged in opposition to the friends of the Federal Government. I do not insinuate that Mr. Jefferson would now wish to see this government subverted; but, it is well known, it has been often asserted and as often proved, that he has ever been opposed to the principles on which it is establish∣ed,
<PB N="18" REF="031946_0017_0FEF5C5D8D081AF8"/>
and on which it must stand, if it stands at all. His partiality for the destructive system of the up∣start rulers of France is also well known. His <HI>philosophy</HI> and politics perfectly harmonize with theirs. His partizans, so far from denying his be∣ing <HI>a deist,</HI> defend it: and his public recommen∣dation of the infamous Tom Paine's Rights of Man, as a means of opposing <Q>the political heresies which have sprung up amongst us,</Q> sufficiently explains his political creed.</P>
<P>That the French regicides looked to him as a proper instrument for facilitating their encroach∣ments on the independence of America, no one can doubt, that has read Fauchet's intercepted let∣ter and the menacing notes of Citizen Adet, and that has been a witness of the electioneering in∣trigues of their hirelings.</P>
<P>Proof has been too often given to need repeti∣tion here, that the great object of the French has ever been, and still is, to cut off all communica∣tion between this country and Great Britain, as the only effectual means of rendering us totally de∣pendent on themselves. Conscious of their own inability, in a fair competition, to supplant Great Britain as the manufacturer for America; and conscious also that the inseparable and growing interests of the two countries must produce a per∣fect reconciliation, and may finally lead to an alliance that would for ever frustrate their projects, they have missed no opportunity of exerting their influence to destroy an intercourse, dangerous to their ambition and to that alone. The endea∣vours of their partizans have uniformly tended to this point. They have, indeed, varied their
<PB N="19" REF="031946_0018_0FEF5CC2CA1803D0"/>
means, but the end has always been the same.— First, it was proposed (and the proposition was brought forward at a favourable juncture) to dis∣courage the trade with Britain by imposing heavier duties on goods imported thence than on those imported from France. The pretext, the miserable pretext, for this, was, <HI>to force Great Bri∣tain into a commercial treaty with America!</HI> Du∣plicity unmatched, and almost incredible! The men, who brought forward this proposition, have by the current of subsequent events, been led to declare, that America stands in need of com∣mercial treaties with <HI>no nation on earth, and par∣ticularly with Britain!</HI> It was hoped that the Se∣nate would adopt the regulations, proposed and passed in the other House, and it was naturally ex∣pected, that an attempt to <HI>force</HI> a treaty down the throat of the British would produce just a contra∣ry effect. The Senate saw through the veil of dis∣guised hostility, and the Executive took the neces∣sary measures to accomplish, <HI>without force,</HI> what the insidious proposals professed to have in view, but what they were in reality intended to prevent.</P>
<P>But we must not quit this subject without hear∣ing Citizen Fauchet, of treacherous memory, who is a most excellent expositor of dark points. <Q>The sessions of 1793 and 1794, says he, had given importance to the <HI>republican party</HI> [vulgarly call∣ed the <HI>French faction</HI>], and solidity to its <HI>accusa∣tions.</HI> The propositions of Mr. Madison, or his pro∣ject of a navigation act, <HI>of which Mr. Jefferson was originally the author,</HI> sapped the British in∣terest, now an integral part of the financiering system.</Q>—Thus we see, then, that the famous <HI>re∣solutions</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="031946_0019_0FEF5C6E39DC6890"/>
that were to sap the British interest, or trade, the revenue arising from which was become an integral part of the financiering system, were ascribed to a wrong person; and that patriot Ma∣dison, who has been honoured with such loads of democratic applause on this account, was no more than the passive instrument of the then Secretary of State; he was no more, in the opinion of Fauchet at least, than the fore-horse of the French team, that the Virginian Philosopher, with his long whip, was driving through the mire of opposition. Full well I remember the time. The little man bridled up and assumed a vast deal of self-impor∣tance; but we are now told that the trappings were not his own, and are left to suppose, that his va∣nity was nothing more than that of a quadruped leader, whose head the partial clown has hung with bells or decorated with garlands.—I do not like this comparison. The horse is a noble, ma∣jestic animal; and we all know how offensive such ideas are to republican minds, though figur∣atively used. They do not go in teams, otherwise I might have been led to one of those sagacious and ever honoured, though comparatively dimi∣nutive creatures, on which the Redeemer of the World made his public entry into Jerusalem.</P>
<P>Mr. Jefferson quitted the field before the stormy times of <HI>sequestration</HI> and <HI>total prohibition</HI> came on; but, if we may believe Fauchet (who certain∣ly was in all the secrets of the antifederal party), we shall find that retirement was not the only thing he sighed for. "Consult Munroe" (says Fauchet, in his letter to the Convention), <Q>Con∣sult Munroe; he had <HI>apprized me</HI> of the men whom the current of events had dragged along
<PB N="21" REF="031946_0020_0FEF5CB85C2E89E0"/>
as bodies devoid of weight. His friend Madi∣son is also an <HI>honest</HI> man</Q> [in the French sense of the word, of course]. <Q>Jefferson, on whom the <HI>patriots</HI> cast their eyes to succeed the President, has foreseen these crises. He <HI>prudently</HI> retired.</Q> —For what?—To enjoy the tranquil pleasures of a country life? To become one of <Q>God's chosen people, <HI>if he ever had</HI> a chosen people,</Q> as he himself calls the cultivators of the land?— It was not for this. He did not retire merely to wander through the groves, to listen to the oaten reed of the smutty swains, nor to solace his limbs in the silver brooks of his modern Arcadia; no, nor to inhale the fragrance of its tobacco-fields neither. <Q><HI>He</HI> prudently <HI>retired, to avoid making a figure,</HI> against his inclination, <HI>in scenes,</HI> the se∣cret of which will soon or late be brought to light.</Q> —Thank ye, Fauchet. Had it not been for the clue, which you have here given us, some artful people might yet continue to assert, and some silly people to believe, that <Q>Mr. Jefferson retired from the <HI>foppery</HI> of the <HI>monarchical</HI> court of Philadelphia, with no other motive than that of adding to the stock of philosophy, to the litera∣ry honour of America, and the good of man∣kind.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Jefferson did, then, foresee "these crises," these troublesome times; he foresaw the violent conduct of the House of Representatives: he fore∣saw that the opposition to the excise law would end where it did, in open rebellion; and foresee∣ing all this, <Q>he <HI>prudently</HI> retired, to avoid mak∣ing a figure <HI>against his inclination,</HI></Q> on the side of government (which, as Secretary of State, he must have done), lest thereby he should lose the
<PB N="22" REF="031946_0021_0FEF5C86E4C97B00"/>
future support of the <HI>"patriots,"</HI> who had <Q>cast their eyes on him to succeed the President.</Q> The partizans of Mr. Jefferson say, that such was the opinion of <HI>Fauchet only!</HI> This is precisely what I want them to allow. The opinion of the French minister assuredly became the opinion of his mas∣ters; and, it is their opinion respecting Mr. Jef∣ferson's principles that I am endeavouring to make appear. Whether they were deceived by appear∣ances, or not, is of little consequence now. It is from what <HI>they thought</HI> of Mr. Jefferson, whether right or wrong, that we are to form an estimate of their motives in attempting to impose him, as Pre∣sident, on the people of the United States.</P>
<P>Now that the electioneering manoeuvres have failed, the hirelings of France pretend, that Adet's Notes were by no means intended to have the ef∣fect which has been looked upon as their princi∣pal object; and that it is the height, the very sum∣mit of absurdity, to suppose any such thing, to sup∣pose what is now reduced to a certainty as indis∣putable as any that ever was established.</P>
<P>The Notes in substance declare, that the French are offended at the conduct of the Presi∣dent and his council, that they have resolved on seizing our vessels, and on breaking off all diplo∣matic communication with us, till the govern∣ment returns to itself; not forgetting to hint at the same time, and that in terms comprehensible to the meanest capacity, that a change of <HI>men</HI> as well as measures, is the only means of reconcilia∣tion.</P>
<P>As to <HI>nominating</HI> the successors of General Washington and his officers of state, that could
<PB N="23" REF="031946_0022_0FEF5C98A9BE95A0"/>
have answered no useful end; that part of the bu∣siness was prudently left to their faithful stipen∣diaries, who immediately exclaimed, as if from sudden inspiration, that Mr. Jefferson was the only man capable of making our peace with the justly enraged, "terrible republic." However, lest we should despise the vociferations of this vile herd, Citizen Adet takes care to drag Mr. Jefferson in∣to his first Note, and that in such a way as leaves not the least doubt as to his object in so doing.</P>
<P>Still, however, there would be some little lati∣tude for dispute, were the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of com∣municating these Notes left out of the question.</P>
<P>All the pretended grounds of complaint, among which I include the ratification of the British treaty, existed in the month of July, 1795. How came it to pass, then, that the Convention of France, whom I hope no body will accuse of an over degree of lenity and forbearance; how came it to pass, that these vengeful despots, who scent the blood of disobedient nations from afar, and are ever ready to rush upon their prey; how came it that they should reserve their threats till the 2d of July 1796? Again; supposing for a moment, that their wrath had lain dormant all this while, how did it happen that the determination to menace us with chastisement, which was taken on the 2d of July, was kept a profound secret till the 27th of October, four entire months all but five days, in a season of the year when even two months is a long passage from France to the United States? Mr. Pickering expressed his surprise, and well he might, that the violent resolutions of the Convention should be notified at so late an hour, and without any new subject of complaint. Had a redress of the
<PB N="24" REF="031946_0023_0FEF5CB0DC1E93F0"/>
injuries complained of been the object of the Notes, and of the measures they communicate, why were they delayed for a year and four months, and then poured out upon us all of a sud∣den, on the 27th of October, 1796, seven days previous to the election?</P>
<P>The manner, too, of the communication clearly proves its intent. If reparation of wrongs had been the real end proposed, why was the commu∣nication not left with the government, which alone could make that reparation? Why did Citizen Adet treat with the people? And why did he do this before it was possible for him to know what answer he should receive from the government? His appeal from the government to the people was an outrage of decency, a violation of the law of nations, and a direct attack on the sovereignty of the United States; it was an act that the Con∣vention itself had recalled Genet for <HI>talking of</HI> only; and why should they now authorize its <HI>com∣mission,</HI> unless to answer some end of extraordina∣ry importance? It was easy to foresee that the President would not publish these Notes, till ac∣companied with a refutation of the charges they contain, and then they would not only have ap∣peared disarmed, but also too late for effecting their purpose.</P>
<P>To the conclusion, necessarily resulting from these observations, it has been objected, 1st, that the Convention could not be informed of Gen. Washington's intention to resign, at the time when they gave their minister his instructions, and there∣fore could not possibly do it with a view of fright∣ening the people into a choice of Mr. Jefferson: and 2dly, that Adet could have no such intention,
<PB N="25" REF="031946_0024_0FEF5CC544338BD8"/>
or he would have published his notes at an earlier day, to give them time to reach every quarter of the Union, before the election came on.</P>
<P>With respect to the first of these objections, I allow that it is possible, that the spies of the Con∣vention had not been able to apprize them of the President's design; I allow that that arch fiend, formerly bishop of Autun, who had wound his pro∣tean form into all the circles of Philadelphia; I will allow that even the devil, their constant cro∣ny, had not apprized them of it; but what is that to the purpose? Citizen Fauchet, though apprized of a good deal, was not apprized of it; yet he was apprized, that <Q>the <HI>patriots</HI> had fixed their eyes on <HI>Mr. Jefferson</HI> to succeed the President;</Q> and of this he informed the Convention. It was not, therefore, necessary that they should be ap∣prized of General Washington's intention to re∣sign. Mr. Jefferson was to be opposed to whomso∣ever should appear as a candidate for the office, whether Washington, or Adams, or any body else; and as the French knew when the election must take place as well as we did, time was all they had to attend to. So that this mighty objection is at once so completely done away, that even fools may walk over it blindfolded.</P>
<P>As to the second objection, that Adet could not publish his menaces with an intention of influenc∣ing the people in their choice, because the publica∣tion did not take place time enough to reach every quarter of the Union, previous to the day of elec∣tion, every man, however careless an observer he may be of the politics of the different states must
<PB N="26" REF="031946_0025_0FEF5C5F13BBA6A8"/>
see that the publication took place soon enough and not a moment too late.</P>
<P>There were two notes, the first was intended to influence the people in their choice of electors, and the last to influence the electors in their choice of the President. One was published se∣ven days only before the people met, and the other about as many days before the assembling of the electors. That this was not time enough for them to reach every state is evident, and it is as evident, that, to accomplish their object, it was not necessary they should. The sentiments of the people <HI>to the north of the Delaware,</HI> and of those <HI>to the south of the Po∣tomack,</HI> were as well known before the election as they are at this day. Pennsylvania and Maryland alone were justly looked upon as balancing be∣tween the two candidates; and seven days was a space of time just sufficient to give circulation to the threats, without leaving time for the people and their electors to recover from the panic, that it was hoped they would produce, before the elec∣tion was over. The Jacobins, as Burke observes, are very accurate calculators. They never miss the nick of time. They know to a moment when to look big, and when to fawn: when to give you the fraternal hug, and when to knock you down.</P>
<P>The result has proved, that all that was to be feared or hoped for, by either party, lay in these two States, and therefore the Frenchman's blun∣derbuss was discharged just in time to have all the influence that it was probable, or possible, it should have. I feel a satisfaction, however, in as∣serting, that it had none at all. The votes for Mr. Adams in Maryland prove that French principles have lost, in place of gaining ground, in that State;
<PB N="27" REF="031946_0026_0FEF5CC70EA16C20"/>
and, as to poor Pennsylvania, though appearances are against her, though <HI>fourteen</HI> French votes to <HI>one</HI> American one brand her with ignominy, yet I hope, with the indulgence of the reader, to prove, that this unfortunate State, this fairest sister of the family, appears much more culpable than she real∣ly is, and that her transgression has proceeded from her amiable weakness rather than from any radical vices.</P>
<P>In this state the electors are not chosen for se∣parate districts. Each district does not begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> close the election of its electors; but, fifteen per∣sons become candidates for the electorship of the whole state. The same men are put up and voted for in all the districts; the whole number of votes for each man are at last collected by the governor (whose conduct in the present election I would ap∣plaud, were I not afraid the honest reader would kick me for it), who then issues his proclamation declaring who are the persons chosen. From this regulation it follows, that a majority of a single vote, upon the whole number of freemen, may give the state the appearance of unanimity on a point on which it is nearly equally divided. This was not far from being the case in the election we are now speaking of. According to the return, one would be led to imagine, that fourteen out of fifteen Pennsylvanians were for Jefferson; where∣as the fact is, that, out of <HI>twenty thousand</HI> votes, his electors had a majority of no more than about <HI>one hundred and seventy,</HI> number that, when com∣pared to the whole mass, is hardly worthy of be∣ing called a casting voice. So that the people in Pennsylvania may be looked upon as having been equally divided between the two candidates.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="031946_0027_0FEF5C6FC999C380"/>It is fair also to observe, that this state labours under disadvantages, in this respect, that no other state does. Hers is precisely that climate that suits the vagabonds of Europe: here they may bask in summer, and lay curled up in winter, with∣out fear of scorching in one season or freezing in the other. Accordingly hither they come in shoals, just roll themselves a-shore, and begin to swear and poll away as if they had been bred to the business from their infancy. She has, too, un∣happily acquired a reputation for the mildness, or rather the feebleness, of her laws. <Q>There's no gallows in Pennsylvania!</Q> These glad tidings have rung through all the democratic club-rooms, all the dark assemblies of traitors, all the dun∣geons and cells of England, Scotland and Ire∣land. Hence it is that we are overwhelmed with the refuse, the sweepings, of those kingdoms, the offal of the jail and the gibbet. Hence it is that we see so many faces that never looked comely but in the pillory, limbs that are awkward out of chains, and necks that seem made to be stretch∣ed.</P>
<P>Among all this refugee, renegade, and feloni∣ous crew, Mr. Adams was not dishonoured with a single vote; and yet, after all, he would have had a great majority, had it not been for the unanimity with which he was opposed by the counties <HI>so lately in a state of open rebellion,</HI> and by the <HI>county</HI> (not the city) of Philadelphia. Next to the honour of having the support of all the men of property, sense and virtue, in this populous state, the President must esteem that of being re∣jected

<P>There's a fine Congress-man for you!—This was the man who, in the presence of his many-headed sovereign, in town meeting assem∣bled, proposed to kick the British Treaty to hell; and it was for this patriotic motion, I presume, that his gracious liege chose him for a representative.

If there's a damn'd rotten rascally borough in the uni∣verse, that ever made such a choice as this, I'll be bound to cut my throat, and suffer the sans-culotte sovereign of the county of Phila∣delphia, the hob snob sniggar-snee-ers of Germantown, to kick me about in my blood, till my corpse is as ugly and filthy and disgusting as their living carcasses are.</P></NOTE></P>

From the intended effects of this nefarious, this detestable project, we have been preserved, not by the counter endeavours of the friends to govern∣ment, for these were at once tardy and illy con∣ducted; not by the influence of the public prints, for three-fourths of them aided the cause of the treacherous foe; not by that pretended light which we have acquired in these illuminating days, for in all those places where men are most conversant in what is called politics, there the French have received the greatest support; but by that <HI>plain good sense,</HI> the natural effect of experi∣ence operating on a sound mind.

<HEAD>THE FESTIVAL OF FOOLS.</HEAD>
<P><Q>On Thursday, the 6th of February, at O'El∣ler's Hotel, the Anniversary of Alliance be∣tween the American and French Republics [that is to say <HI>French Monarchy</HI>] was com∣memorated by as respectable an association of citizens as was, perhaps, ever convened, <HI>on a
<PB N="31" REF="031946_0030_0FEF5CB367D5A5A8"/>
similar occasion</HI> [well put in].—The company consisted of a <HI>large</HI> number of members of the Federal and State Legislatures, of citizens of acknowledged <HI>patriotism,</HI> and foreigners of dis∣tinction, among whom was <HI>Dr. Priestly,</HI> [and <HI>Citizen Adet.</HI>]—Chief Justice M'Kean, and Mr. Langdon [Old Johnny Langdon] pre∣sided.—The enthusiasm, convivial gaiety, and elevation of patriotism, inspired by the celebra∣tion of an aera interesting in the annals of li∣berty, <HI>shed</HI> through the whole company a <HI>glow</HI> of <HI>light,</HI> which every one <HI>felt</HI> and expressed with <HI>ardour.</HI> The <HI>repast</HI> was enjoyed with <HI>mo∣deration</HI> [bless us!], and without even an ap∣proach to <HI>intemperance.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, hang me, Mr. News-Monger, if I believe this last assertion; for, though I am none of the most incredulous; though I know the magic, and more than magic, power of liberty; though I might even raise my mind to the conception of nonsense, and really believe that this enchantress did <HI>shed</HI> a <HI>glow,</HI> and a <HI>glow</HI> of <HI>light</HI> too, and that that <HI>light</HI> was <HI>felt;</HI> though it is possible that I might be elevated or stupid enough to believe all this, or rascal enough to pretend to believe it, yet I never can or will believe that there was no "approach to <HI>intemperance</HI>" at this civic festival; unless want of cash prevented it.—When I en∣ter on the pious office of Gazette-Man, I will ob∣serve a stricter adherence to truth.</P>
<P>But, to proceed; "After dinner the following TOASTS were <HI>drank;</HI>" that is to say, in English <HI>drunk.</HI>—But why do I attempt to criticise? We
<PB N="32" REF="031946_0031_0FEF5CCA57007168"/>
all know, that, in literature, a News-monger ranks next after a dray-horse.</P>
<P>Now to the <HI>Toasts</HI> that <HI>were drank,</HI> and that I have kept too long from the thirsty reader.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE DAY—may it ever be a festival to freemen; and the alliance which it gave birth to, be regarded, as a key stone in the arch of liberty—Music, <HI>Yankee doodle.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The People—knowledge to discern their rights and spirit and firmness to assert them.—<HI>Reveil du Peuple.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The United States—may they ever be an asylum for the oppressed, and become a terror to oppressors.</P>
<P>As they are now to the vile, infamous gallic oppressors of our commerce, I suppose?</P>
<P N="4">4. The Republic of France—may she be as distinguish∣ed in peace, as she is formidable in war—that her happi∣ness may allure other nations into an imitation of her ex∣ample.—<HI>Ca Ira.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Batavian Republic—may her experience in∣struct other nations to shun a tyrant's grasp, far a free∣man's embrace.—<HI>La Carmagnole.</HI></P>
<P>Excellent irony!</P>
<P N="6">6. The Revolutionary Army of the United States— may the fruits of their labours be no longer enjoyed by the enemies of American Independence—<HI>Lexington march.</HI></P>
<P>That is to say; "rise, sans-culottes, and seize on the property of the rich!"</P>
<P N="7">7. The memory of those heroes, who fell in defence of American Liberty—may the inscription upon their tombs,
<PB N="33" REF="031946_0032_0FEF5C886BC56220"/>
call a tear from gratitude, and a blush from <HI>apostacy.</HI>—So∣lemn music.</P>
<P N="8">8. The philosophers and patriots, who planned and con∣ducted the American Revolution—may the splendor of their actions and the dignity of their measures, teach go∣vernments, that <HI>honesty</HI> is the best policy.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Constitution of the United States—may it prove an effectual, and not a <HI>nominal check</HI> on the <HI>designs of am∣bition.</HI></P>
<P>We understand all this perfectly well. The charge of <HI>apostacy,</HI> the hint at <HI>dishonesty,</HI> and the check on the <HI>designs of ambition,</HI> are taken from Paine's most impudent and infamous letter to Gen. Washington. Would that their beer had been drugged with something that would for ever, aye for ever, have silenced their factious tongues!</P>
<P N="10">10. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, may she be as distinguished in the cause of republicanism, as she has been conspicuous in that of humanity.</P>
<P>"Poor Pennsylvania keeps no gallows!" says a modern poem, in which <HI>gallows,</HI> with singular elegance and harmony, rhymes to <HI>Dallas.</HI> Poor unfortunate state! Look at the men who extol thy <HI>humanity,</HI> and then blush at it.</P>
<P N="11">11. The Freedom of the Press, may this palladium of our rights ever remain uninfluenced by power, unbiassed by party, and unseduced by <HI>corruption.</HI></P>
<P>This last toast might have been spared in tender∣ness to the feelings of Citizen Adet, and Mr. Bache.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="34" REF="031946_0033_0FEF5CAA5DCCDC48"/>12. The memory of Franklin and Rittenhouse—may their <HI>example</HI> instruct the philosopher and the statesman, that true glory consists in <HI>doing good to mankind.</HI>—So∣lemn music.</P>
<P>That deism is philosophy no one will deny, and therefore I cannot dispute the claim here prefer∣red to the title; but what good did Rittenhouse do to mankind? Dr. Rush, indeed, says, that he did a great deal, and particularly to his own coun∣try; but, with all due submission to the hyperbol∣ical bombast of Dr. Rush, and his <HI>eulogium</HI> on the <HI>politics</HI> of Mr. Rittenhouse, I never heard of any good to mankind, and particularly America, that he did, except determining the boundaries of some of the States, <Q>which he did with <HI>great preci∣sion?</HI></Q> and which I could have done as well as he, had I received the same pay for it. One singu∣lar service, indeed, he rendered his country, and that <HI>gratis</HI> too: he volunteered as <HI>president</HI> of that seditious club, the Democratic Society of Phi∣ladelphia, and he himself signed the inflammato∣ry resolves against the excise law, which encour∣aged the malcontents to rise in open rebellion, for the quelling of which, reader, you and I have paid, and still pay, a portion of our earnings.— The devil take such "<HI>good</HI> to mankind," I say! —Doctor Rush is a very fine man, to be sure, and he writes in a fine Doctor-like manner; but the remorseless Doctor Rush shall <HI>bleed me</HI> till I am as white as this paper, before I'll allow that this was "doing good to mankind."</P>
<P>Mr. Rittenhouse's real friends have too much discretion to compliment his understanding at the expense of his heart. They confess that his sim∣plicity and want of political knowledge exposed
<PB N="35" REF="031946_0034_0FEF5CB9E2751B20"/>
him to the duplicity of those subtle fiends in hu∣man shape, who were at the bottom of the demo∣cratic institution, and who only wanted the weight of his name. But his eulogist will insist that he was so profound, so farsighted a politician, that he even scented the delicious days of republican∣ism <HI>twenty years</HI> before they arrived! Nay, such is the zeal of Dr. Rush, that he vows and declares his friend was <HI>born a republican;</HI> though every one knows, that he was born under the royal go∣vernment of Britain. But, don't let us miscon∣strue the Doctor. He means a <HI>mental</HI> republi∣can. <HI>Born</HI> a <HI>mental</HI> republican! Upon my soul it is a wonder he had not traced his republicanism a little further back, and turned the eulogium on his deceased subject into a lecture of anatomy.</P>
<P>Either Mr. Rittenhouse was the dupe of the Democratic Society, or he was not. If he was, the eulogium on his politics was as unjust as it was absurd; if he was not, the eulogium on his good∣ness of heart was more so. In short all that is said, in this performance, of Mr. Rittenhouse's philo∣sophy, should have been better said, and all that is said of his politics should have been omitted. The former is a dry uninteresting narrative, and the latter so glaring a departure from truth, that it will attract but little more respect for his memory, than the hog's-wash <HI>toasts</HI> of the factious Society of which he was President.</P>
<P>We now come to <HI>Doctor Franklin's</HI> <Q>good to mankind.</Q>—As a politician, his wishing to give up the fisheries and Western Posts, for fear of of∣fending France, is a convincing proof of his merit,
<PB N="36" REF="031946_0035_0FEF5C6099CFC9C0"/>
and must render a toast to his memory particular∣ly pleasing to Citizen Adet. As a <HI>moralist</HI> the Doctor's <HI>"example"</HI> is certainly a useful one; more especially in a country like this that is thinly in∣habited. "Increase and multiply," is an injunc∣tion that this great man had continually in his mind; and such was his zeal in the fulfilment of it, that he paid very little attention to time or place or person.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Arts and Sciences; May the former be culti∣vated for our comfort, and the latter for our security.</P>
<P N="14">14. The sister Republics of America and France; As the exertions of France contributed to our freedom, may the exertions of America never tend to her oppression. <HI>Marseillois hymn.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. Peace, Liberty and Independence; may we culti∣vate the one as necessary to our prosperity; cherish the other as essential to our happiness; and never prostitute the latter to ambition or tyranny.</P>
<P N="16">16. The <HI>Republic of Great-Britain;</HI> may the <HI>present year</HI> witness a jubilee, as necessary to the happiness of Bri∣tons as to the tranquillity of mankind. <HI>Britons strike home.</HI></P>
<P>I presume that Doctor Priestly gave this toast; that same loyal Doctor Priestly, who in justifying himself to the people of Birmingham, told them that he had toasted "the king and constitution." —About this gentleman I shall say more by-and-by; at present I would ask, how it happens, that all the declared enemies of Great-Britain, pray that she may become a <HI>Republic!</HI> Is this a proof of their looking upon such a change as a blessing, or as a curse?—"Britons <HI>strike home.</HI>" That is, to the heart of your sovereign.—No; you

spiteful, bloody-minded sans-culottes; Britons, true Britons, scorn your insinuation, and reject your sanguinary precept with horror. When they <HI>strike home,</HI> it is against those foes of their king and their country, who have the courage to face them: as for impotent enemies like you, whose prowess is confined to malicious wishes, spued out over your muddy beverage, you are too much honour∣ed by their contempt.</P>
<P N="18">18. Spain, the friend of France, and the United States; may our treaty with her, never give way to Mr. Jay's.</P>
<P>This <HI>friend</HI> of the United States, has just declar∣ed war against Great Britain, and one of the rea∣sons, is, that Great Britain, in her treaty with A∣merica, <HI>has sacrificed the interests of Spain!</HI> There's <HI>friendship</HI> for you now!

<P N="25">25. Mr. Adet, late Minister of the French Republic.</P>
<P>This toast alone would have characterized the festival. Citizen Adet has heaped insult upon in∣sult on the government and on the whole coun∣try, and yet he was entitled to the applause of these people. Such applause, however, must be but a poor compensation for the cold reception that the Citizen meets with every where else. It was a sort of dumb peal to his departed rank. Since his self-suspension, his diplomatic suicide, he is be∣come a mere carcass; a carcass that does still walk about, 'tis true; but the ministerial soul is fled, and perhaps, already animates some luckier mortal.—He is, or rather he was (poor man!) a member of the Philosophical Society of Philadel∣phia, and, as such, I make no doubt that the Eu∣logist in ordinary is now preparing his funeral ora∣tion. His having departed this life three months ago, is of no kind of consequence with these phi∣losophers, who always think that it is time enough to begin weeping for a deceased brother when his body is half devoured by the worms.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="031946_0038_0FEF5C9F10CAC848"/>The chief justice being retired.</P>
<P N="26">26. Thomas M'Kean, Chief Justice of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>Reader, comparisons are odious you know, and therefore don't you go to ask me what the people of Westminster would have thought, if they had seen Lord Mansfield boozing and bawling in a public-house along with thirty or forty of the rab∣ble, headed by a foreign agent, at open enmity with the government. What suits very well in one country, does not suit at all in another; and therefore I beg you will not ask me any such sneering questions as this.</P>
<P>However, every one may speak for himself, and I will say, that if ever I should become a judge (of which I see no reason to despair), and should so far forget the dignity of my station as to become the companion of a herd of sottish mal∣contents, may all the world that moment forget what is due to me. May my family disown my sway; may my own rib rise up against my lawful authority; may she be the cursedest shrew that ever wielded a broom-stick; may she belabour me <HI>with the tongs,</HI> cut me <HI>over the eye,</HI> rib-roast me, till I am obliged <HI>to call in the neighbours</HI> to shelter me from the effects of her wrath.</P>
<P>Mr. Langdon having retired.</P>
<P N="27">27. John Langdon, an old <HI>whig.</HI></P>
<P>Do you know what an <HI>old wig</HI> is, reader? It is a very ill-looking, nasty, despised and neglected thing, fit for nothing but to be trodden under foot, or thrown to the dunghil. Wigs, when new, are
<PB N="40" REF="031946_0039_0FEF5C8D5A2B99A8"/>
passable; and, some years age, they were very fashionable, and very useful too; but of late years, whether new or old, they have been found to be of no kind of utility, either in England or this country. The fact is, that the wigs, at last, thought themselves heads, and from that moment, every man, who had too much spirit to be wig-rid∣den, threw off the cumbrous companion.</P>
<P>I shall now dismiss the <HI>toasters,</HI> but not without remarking, what is well worth remarking, that, as <HI>Doctor Priestley</HI> assisted at the Philadelphia com∣memoration of the French alliance, so <HI>Napper Tandy</HI> assisted at the same commemoration at New-York, where the <HI>toasts</HI> breathed just as much foul air against the Federal Government as those of Philadelphia did. This would prove, if proof of the fact were yet wanted, that men of faction will still be factious in whatever country and un∣der whatever government they may live. Here is no established hierarchy for Doctor Priestley to rail at, nor are there any <HI>tithes</HI> for him to wrangle for; and yet he cannot be quiet. Wherever the standard of discontent is hoisted, there the Doctor is a volunteer, ready armed and accoutred, whether it be in a conventicle or a club-room, whether the attack be to be made with scraps of scripture, mangled and profaned from the quiver∣ing lips of malice, or with blackguard toasts roared forth from the lungs of gluttony and drunkenness.</P>
<P>After this instance of hostility (as far as ex∣hausted powers can lead him) against the General Government of America, I hope we shall hear no more of his peaceable disposition, of his com∣ing amongst us <Q>to enjoy that toleration which
<PB N="41" REF="031946_0040_0FEF5CA5857AB5C0"/>
his native land denied him," and of his wish to continue <HI>unmolested</HI> those pursuits of various literature to which, without having ever enter∣ed into any <HI>political connections,</HI> his life has been devoted.</Q> If he never before entered into <HI>po∣litical connections,</HI> he has done it now, at any rate. If his present <HI>intimacy,</HI> I say <HI>intimacy,</HI> with Citi∣zen Adet; his toasting success to the fleets of France, Spain, and Batavia, and the insulting sar∣casms on the Federal Government, contained in the above list; if his herding along with all those who hate, who oppose and who slander this go∣vernment, and whose only object is to overturn it, and render the country dependent on France; if this be not entering into <HI>political connections,</HI> I do not know what is.</P>
<P>I hope also, that those who were simple enough to believe the Doctor, when he professed his at∣tachment to the royal government of his country, and solemnly declared that neither he nor his friends thought of, or wished for, a revolution, will be convinced of his duplicity, when they hear him toasting "The <HI>Republic</HI> of Great Britain," and wishing that the present year may witness the <HI>jubilee;</HI> the revolutionary jubilee, the jubilee of plunder and carnage, of incendiaries, thieves, philosophers and cannibals.</P>
<P>The conduct of this persevering demagogue, and that of all those who, like him, have fled from Britain to America, is the best justification that the strong measures of Billy Pitt can have. While on the other side of the water, they only wanted a <HI>reform,</HI> a gentle reform; a very little would have done; a correction of abuses or so. They only
<PB N="42" REF="031946_0041_0FEF5CBC59E46B00"/>
wanted to <Q>restore to the constitution its <HI>primi∣tive purity,</HI> its ancient integrity and <HI>excellence.</HI> The tools of power had insinuated that they wanted to <HI>pull down,</HI> when their only intention was to <HI>repair,</HI> the <HI>goodly fabric.</HI></Q> This was their plaintive cant while in England; but, once arrived in America, once removed from the dan∣gers of Botany Bay, the jail and the halter, they have no scruple to confess, nay they boast, that if <HI>tyranny</HI> had not disappointed their projects, they would, e're this, have repaired <Q><HI>the</HI> goodly fa∣bric,</Q> into a republic, and buried king George under the rubbish.</P>
<P>Let this, then, be a warning to you, Englishmen (if ever these remarks should fall into your hands): beware of the pit that these subtle fiends are preparing for you; be blind to their pauper exhibitions, and deaf to their crocodile cries. If you follow them but one step, you are gone, you are engulphed for ever. Under your govern∣ment, whatever faults it may have (for none ever was without), your property and persons are in safety; under the change that they would ope∣rate, neither would be of long existence: first they would take your money and goods, and then, for fear of your revenge for the robbery, your lives. This is the sure and certain progress in which they advance, and to this tend all their words and all their actions. We know them bet∣ter than you do. The sight of the gibbet kept them in awe, imposed a restraint on their tongues; we have seen their bosoms bare, and have had the discretion to profit from the discovery.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="031946_0042_0FEF5CBDE179EE58"/>When in Britain, they, like their apostle of se∣dition, Paine, held up our government to your imitation, and dunned your ears with the rare talents and virtues of our Chief; but now, be∣hold! they slander both. Our government is but a copy of yours, and General Washington is be∣come an apostate, a hypocrite, a George Guelph. This <HI>"land of liberty,"</HI> (and which is truly such, if ever there was a land of liberty in the world) This "land of liberty," to which they fled, as they pretended, from the <Q>rude arm of lawless power,</Q> is now become a den for slaves, <Q>where the proud tyrant, aristocracy of wealth, lords it over the honest but indigent citizen.</Q>— The same tone, the same language, the very same expressions, are now applied to this government, with which you were formerly amused, and, I am sorry to say it, of which you had nearly been the dupes. If this does not rouze you from your credu∣lity, if this does not open your eyes, you deserve to be plunged into all the horrors of revolution, into desolation without bounds and miseries without end.</P>
<P>Recollect that this lesson comes to you from the United States of America, from Philadelphia, the spot to which your deceivers resorted in hopes of meeting men of their own minds. It is with pleasure and with pride that I assure you, they were disappointed. A tyrant crowd does not govern here, as they were taught, and as they taught you, to believe. To say that they have fallen into ne∣glect would be too much, for they never were no∣ticed. Poverty, though rarely visible here, is ge∣nerally their lot. A thread-bare coat, a dirty shirt
<PB N="44" REF="031946_0043_0FEF5C8FC8DDBAC8"/>
and a long beard are, with us, the distinctive marks of a <HI>Republican Briton.</HI> And these are the wretches, oh! credulous Englishmen! that were leading you about in crowds at their heels. These were your oracles, the expositors of your laws and the defenders of your rights. These scrofulous philosophers, these political lepers, whom we sick∣en but to see, you were hugging to your bosoms.</P>
<P>"Wisdom is in age;" but, it seems, this maxim does not hold good with respect to nations. In the calendar of states, America was born but yes∣terday; yet she has had the discernment to see through, and to frustrate, the designs of those men, who have destroyed the fairest part of Europe, and have shook the rest to its very base. There they had to encounter adamantine institutions grown stronger with time: here there seemed no∣thing to oppose them, the whole continent lay open to their demon-like assaults; yet have they been completely defeated by the peaceful opera∣tion of the national <HI>good sense.</HI> In vain did they attempt to cajole us; in vain did they assume the language, and put on the garb, of liberty; it was soon perceived that their liberty and ours was not the same thing. <HI>Republicanism,</HI> was the next bait; but we also perceived that it was French and not American republicanism; we saw that as our stock could not be augmented, no good could come from a partnership with them. In short, (and let the emigrating demagogues hear it to their confu∣sion), as we love order, so we detest its opposite, anarchy: as we love a free real republican go∣vernment, with power to protect and none to op∣press us, so we detest that mockery of a republic, a base, mob-like, pillaging, murderous democracy.</P>

<HEAD>SENATE, <HI>February</HI> 15.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On request, the Vice-President of the United States being excused from further attendance in Senate during the session, addressed them as fol∣lows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, in the general apprehension of an inten∣tion to retire, in that most eminent citizen, to whom all eyes had been directed and all hearts attracted, as the centre of our union for so long a period; the public opinion had exhibited any clear indications of another, in whom our fellow citizens could have generally united; as soon as I read that excellent address which announced the necessity of deliberation in the choice of a President, I should have imitated the example of a character, with which I had co-operated, though in less conspicuous and important stations, and maintained an uninterrupted friendship for two and twenty years. But as a number of cha∣racters appeared to stand in the general estima∣tion, so nearly on a level, as to render it difficult to conjecture, on which the majority would fall; considering the relation in which I stood to the people of America, I thought it most respectful
<PB N="46" REF="031946_0045_0FEF5C656CF965B0"/>
to them, and most conducive to the tranquillity of the public mind, to resign myself with others, a silent spectator of the general deliberation, and a passive subject of public discussions.</P>
<P>Deeply penetrated with gratitude to my coun∣trymen in general, for their long continued kind∣ness to me, and for that steady and affecting con∣fidence, with which those who have most inti∣mately known me, from early life, have on so many great occasions entrusted to me, the care of their dearest interests; since a majority of their electors, though a very small one, have de∣clared in my favour, and since, in a republican government, the majority, though ever so small, must of necessity decide, I have determined at every hazard of a high but just responsibility, though with much anxiety and diffidence, once more to engage in their service.—Their confi∣dence, which has been the chief consolation of my life, is too precious and sacred a deposit ever to be considered lightly. As it has been found∣ed only on the qualities of the heart, it never has been, it never can be, deceived, betrayed, or forfeited by me.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance, and with all these emo∣tions of gratitude and affection, which a long ex∣perience of your goodness ought to inspire, that I now retire from my seat in this house, and take my leave of the members of the Senate.</P>
<P>I ought not to declare, for the last time, your adjournment, before I have presented to every senator present, and to every citizen who has ever been a senator of the United States, my
<PB N="47" REF="031946_0046_0FEF5C92375F56B8"/>
thanks, for the candour and favour invariably re∣ceived from them all. It is a recollection, of which nothing can ever deprive me, and it will be a source of comfort to me, through the re∣mainder of my life, that, as on the one hand, in a government constituted like ours, I have for eight years held the second situation under the constitution of the United States, in perfect and uninterrupted harmony with the first, without envy in one, or jealousy in the other: so, on the other hand, I have never had the smallest misunderstanding with any member of the senate. In all the abstruse questions, difficult conjunctures, dangerous emergencies, and animated debates upon the great interests of our country, which have so often and so deeply impressed all our minds, and interested the strongest feelings of the heart, I have experienced an uniform polite∣ness and respect from every quarter of the house. When questions of no less importance than diffi∣culty, have produced a difference of sentiment (and differences of opinion will always be found in free assemblies of men, and probably the greatest diversities upon the greatest questions), when the senators have been equally divided, and my opinion has been demanded according to the constitution, I have constantly found, in that moiety of the senators, from whose judgment I have been obliged to dissent, a disposition to al∣low me the same freedom of deliberation and independence of judgment which they asserted for themselves.</P>
<P>Within these walls, for a course of years, I have been an admiring witness of a succession of information, eloquence, patriotism and indepen∣dence,
<PB N="48" REF="031946_0047_0FEF5C9D88EC4570"/>
which, as they would have done honour to any senate in any age, afford a consolatory hope (if the legislatures of the states are equally careful in their future selections, which there is no reason to distrust) that no council more per∣manent than this as a branch of the legislature will be necessary, to defend the rights, liberties, and properties of the people, and to protect the constitution of the United States, as well as the constitutions and rights of the individual states, against errors of judgment, irregularities of the passions, or other encroachments of human in∣firmity, or more reprehensible enterprize, in the executive on one hand, or the more immediate representatives of the people on the other.</P>
<P>These considerations will all conspire to ani∣mate me in my future course, with a confident reliance, that as far as my conduct shall be uni∣formly measured by the constitution of the Unit∣ed States, and faithfully directed to the public good, I shall be supported by the senate, as well as by the house of representatives and the people at large; and on no other conditions ought any support at all to be expected or desired.</P>
<P>With cordial wishes for your honour, health, and happiness, and fervent prayers for a conti∣nuation of the virtues, liberties, prosperity and peace of our beloved country, I avail myself of your leave of absence for the remainder of the session.</P>

<HEAD>IN SENATE, <HI>Wednesday, February</HI> 22.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The answer to the address of the Vice President of the United States on his retiring from the Se∣nate, was yesterday agreed to as follows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Senate of the United States would be unjust to their own feelings, and deficient in the performance of a duty their relation to the go∣vernment of their country imposes, should they fail to express their regard for your person, and their respect for your character, in answer to the address you presented to them, on your leaving a station which you have so long and so honour∣ably filled as their President.</P>
<P>The motives you have been pleased to disclose which induced you not to withdraw from the public service, at a time when your experience, talents, and virtues, were peculiarly desirable, are as honourable for yourself, as from our con∣fidence in you, Sir, we trust the result will be beneficial to our beloved country.</P>
<P>When you retired from your dignified seat in this house, and took your leave of the members of the Senate, we felt all those emotions of gra∣titude and affection, which our knowledge and experience of your abilities, and undeviating im∣partiality ought to inspire; and we should with painful reluctance endure the separation, but for the consoling reflection, that the same qualities
<PB N="50" REF="031946_0049_0FEF5CABE47FB830"/>
which have rendered you useful, as the President of this branch of the legislature, will enable you to be still more so, in the exalted station to which you have been called.</P>
<P>From you, Sir, in whom your country have, for a long period, placed a steady confidence, which has never been betrayed or forfeited, and to whom they have on so many occasions en∣trusted the care of their dearest interests, which have never been abused.—From you, who hold∣ing the second situation under the Constitution of the United States, have lived in uninterrupted harmony with him who has held the first.</P>
<P>From you we receive with much satisfaction, the declaration which you are pleased to make of the opinion you entertain of the character of the present senators, and of that of those citizens who have been heretofore senators. This declaration, were other motives wanting, would afford them an incentive to a virtuous perseverance, in that line of conduct which has been honoured with your approbation.</P>
<P>In your future course, we entertain no doubt, that your official conduct, will be measured by the constitution, and directed to the public good, you have therefore a right to entertain a confi∣dent reliance, that you will be supported, as well by the people at large as by their constituted au∣thorities.</P>
<P>We cordially reciprocate the wishes which you express for our honour, health, and happiness: we join with yours, our fervent prayers for the
<PB N="51" REF="031946_0050_0FEF5CA7F1F00AD8"/>
continuation of the virtues and liberties of our fellow-citizens; for the public prosperity and peace; and for you we implore the best reward of virtuous deeds, the grateful approbation of your constituents, and the smiles of heaven.</P>

<HEAD>The reply of the Vice President of the United States, to the Address of the Senate. Feb. <HI>23, 1797.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN address so respectful and affectionate as this, from gentlemen of such experience and established character in public affairs, high sta∣tions in the government of their country, and great consideration in their several states, as the senators of the United States, will do me great honour, and afford me a firm support, wherever it shall be known, both at home and abroad. Their generous approbation of my conduct, in general, and liberal testimony to the undeviating impartiality of it, in my peculiar relation to their body, a character, which, in every scene and employment of life, I should wish above all others to cultivate and merit; has a tendency to soften asperities and conciliate animosities, wherever such may unhappily exist; an effect at all times to be desired, and in the present situation of our country, ardently to be promoted by all good citizens.</P>
<P>I pray the senate to accept my sincere thanks.</P>
