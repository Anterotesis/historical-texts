<P>AS I hope, upon thy Serious consideration, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not take it amiss, that we have at this time, and in this man∣ner appeared, against G. K. especially, considering the Fresh occasion he hath given us, since his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arivall in <HI>America;</HI> some Relation of which appears in this following Book, so also thou art Seriously desired to consider, whether it doth not necessarily behove G. K. as he would approve himself, not only to be a Man of Pen; but also a Man Sound in Judgment, to prove himself consistant with himself, in and about divers <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> acknowledged by himself to be <HI>Fundamentalls,</HI> concerning which he is hereby plainly proved, to ly un∣der great variations, Inconsistances, and Confusions; I say, doth it not behove him so to prove himself, inste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of his thus Disturbing us, (or others in our peaceable <HI>Religious Assembly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or otherwise, since he that <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ches</HI> another, ought certainly first to <HI>Teach</HI> himself. And now as to the difference between our <HI>Friends,</HI> and G. K. here, begun by him, about eleven or twelve Years ago; it was chiefly about that of the universall necessity of the Faith and knowledge of <HI>Christ's</HI> outward <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Suffering,</HI> in order to <HI>Salvation;</HI> for tho' he begun at that time, to Pick up such Sentences and passages, out of our <HI>Friends</HI> works, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aining and perverting, he thought he could render Odious to the People; and also to catch at some weak, unadvised, and unwarrantable Expressions, from here and there an unweary Per∣son, about other matters, (and disapproved by our <HI>Friends,</HI> on all occasions<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet that about the universall necessity of Faith in <HI>Christ</HI> without us, was confessed by himself, severall times in Print, to be the main matter of Controversie with our <HI>Friends</HI> here, as in the following book is shewn: and he charged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that time, severall <HI>Friends,</HI> with such words, as I have heard them

Se <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> pa. 40. This made me I must Confess begin to admire, what the <HI>Man</HI> was all of a Sad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so hard driving at; for thought I, it such <HI>Gentiles</HI> could not perish, tho' they Dyed without that Faith and knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI> in the outward, and yet could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Saved,</HI> without they had that Faith and knowledge; where then must they have it, in order to save them? But quick∣ly upon this, there was an honest <HI>Friend,</HI> and then a late Inti∣mate of G. K's told me, G. K's Notions of the twelve <HI>Revolu∣tions</HI> of Humane Souls: And that according to those Notions, those Faithful <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as also <HI>Infants,</HI> born Idiots &amp;c. should some time or other live again, by being born in other <HI>Bodies,</HI> in some place of this World, where they may have the <HI>Gospell</HI> expressly <HI>Preached</HI> to them, in order to perfect their <HI>Salvation:</HI> These things of so long standing, I speak not as trusting only to Memory; for I committed them quickly to writing, to prevent mistakes, through shortness of Memory. And hearing also, that G. K. had been deeply Concerned, in Writing a <HI>Book</HI> of 200 Queries, concerning those twelve <HI>Revolutions.</HI> I got a sight of it, and soon found, that his above method of <HI>Doctrine Exact∣ly,</HI> Coresponded with the said <HI>Revolution Notions,</HI> as also did divers Passages though some of them Coucht in severall of his
<PB REF="001094_0004_0FAFE056796D2C00"/>
Books, than lately Printed against some in <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>Rhoad Island;</HI> in which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, that he then held, that the <HI>[Express]</HI> Faith and knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI> without &amp;c. was ab∣solutely, and Indespensibly necessary, to the perfecting of me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Salvation: And hearing, that that <HI>Revolution</HI> Book was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the year 81 or thereabouts, I searcht what <HI>Books</HI> I could get, of all he had published, from that time to the time of his differing here with us: And I think, I found scarce one; but had more or less, some Expression dropt, or at least Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which really seemed to depend upon those <HI>Revolution</HI> Notions; but most plain, as the time came, or drew near, to his suffer∣ing with our <HI>Friends</HI> here.</P>
<P>And now, since in pa. 25. 26. of this book, I gave a relation of some concern betwixt G. K. and an other Person, about the Revolutions, James Coper Cloth worker of Darby, did many years ago give it, and more of his Strange Nations under his hand and is ready to give more (yet upon occasion) of his Whim∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, that he was then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with, as he is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gg with Invet∣erate Hatred, and Persecuting <HI>Enmity,</HI> against his old <HI>Friends,</HI> who seing, and being sensible of his Spirit in time, could not humour him, upon which he grew so disorderly and ungoverna∣ble in the <HI>Church,</HI> that our <HI>Friends</HI> saw a necessity of disowning him as a <HI>Minister</HI> of the <HI>Peacable Gospell</HI> among us.</P>
<P>And whereas, in this book pa. 8 there is mention made of G. K's Couching the <HI>Revolution</HI> Notions, In severall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eks; but for brevitys sake, did not insert them there, being Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y of the said books, the <HI>Country,</HI> yet least some may be des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e something of it who cannot get the books, I shall the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> however insert one or two Pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etracted, that I think, must needs make his <HI>Revolution</HI> Notions, speak out plain enough, to shew, how deep he has <HI>Prank</HI> those <HI>Notio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> in.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>But he says, he could never Justly own himself to be the Author of that Book, for others were concerned pa. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I know not who ever Charged him to be the whole <HI>Au∣thor;</HI> but for him to say, others were concerned, Implys, he was concerned as well as others.</P>
<P><PB REF="001094_0005_0FAFE05739AD0F78"/>
Ob. <HI>But he says, those Books, (meaning those, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him about the</HI> Revolutions), <HI>they were generally approved as,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Friends <HI>of the</HI> Ministry Anti. <HI>and</HI> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duce. <HI>pa.</HI> 9.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But he doth not say, they were <HI>all</HI> so aproved, however we Read in <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de</HI> 9. There were some, who were not Right that Crept in at unawares, Mark, at [unawares]; and it was told by the <HI>Apostle Peter:</HI> that there should be false <HI>Teachers,</HI> who would Privet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y bring in <HI>Damnable Heri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies &amp;c.</HI> So that's no new thing.</P>
<P>And now, whereas, there are in the said <HI>Revolution Book,</HI> many of the <HI>Queries,</HI> that really seem to be as Texts, to save all Passages in some books, afterwards writt by him, as above; I shall therefore, before I cite the Passages, lay down one of them, that it may be seen, how close he keeps his <HI>Doctrine</HI> to the Text, it's the 37. query, and the words are these, (viz.) <Q>seing <HI>Christ</HI> said, that this <HI>Gospell</HI> of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI>should be Preacht to <HI>all</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> for a witness against them; is it not evident, that <HI>all</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> that is every Man that is born into the World, from the <HI>First</HI> to the <HI>Last,</HI> must have that very <HI>Gospell</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in which Mention is made, of the Womans Powring <HI>Ointment</HI> on his Body, <HI>Preacht</HI> unto them, as well [Outwardly] as inwardly, before it can be made a wit∣ness against them; compare <HI>Math.</HI> 24.14. with <HI>Math.</HI> 26.13.</Q> Thus much as to the Text: Now let's se G. K's <HI>Doctrine,</HI> as agreeable thereto, <HI>Pretended Antidote</HI> pa. 105. Where speak∣ing of the meaning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Extant of <HI>Christ's</HI> words, where he <HI>Com∣mands</HI> his <HI>Gospell</HI> to be <HI>Preached</HI> to all <HI>Nations,</HI> and of his say∣ing, so it shall be before the <HI>End;</HI> he saith, as his meaning u∣pon those Texts, thus; <Q>The <HI>Gospell</HI> that began to be <HI>Preacht,</HI> from <HI>Adams</HI> Fall Immediately, shall be <HI>Preacht</HI> to <HI>all</HI> Men, that <HI>Ever</HI> lived in the <HI>World:</HI> some <HI>time</HI> or other, before the <HI>End</HI> of the <HI>World;</HI> so that such as shall not Live in the latter Ages of the <HI>World,</HI> have had it <HI>Preacht</HI> in the former <HI>Ages</HI> when they Lived in the <HI>World</HI></Q></P>

D. L. faith of him in the matter, knowing himself who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> innocent as to what he charges him with; and he absolutely, denies his infamous and false accusation, and saies it's a horrid abuse upon him.</P>

<P><HI>Ans:</HI> I suppose by this, as well as by what I have formerly heard, that D.

As is the man; so is his manner of treatment; however, as I think I formerly told his then Nighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>George Deacon</HI> that there was a matter that had long been in susp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> betwixt <HI>Tomas Cross,</HI> on the Ac∣count of his deceased Son, my self, and another person; so know tell D.

<P>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st: <HI>Well, what doest thou observe from this challenge?</HI></P>
<P>Ans: I observe <HI>Four</HI> falshoods; <HI>first</HI> that I either put a trick upon him or else had some base design; for my Letter and intent was without <HI>Trick</HI> or <HI>Base</HI> design. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that <HI>Seven</HI> days were expired before he had my <HI>Letter;</HI> for it was but <HI>Six: Third∣ly</HI> that the words [not <HI>Quakers</HI>] are inserted, meaning, in his <HI>First</HI> printed Challenge; for there is no such words inserted there. And <HI>Lastly</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> in such cases dare not deter∣mine any thing against one another; for, that they are tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to do where there is just cause; not only in such, but in all case. Next I observe, that whereas he tells of near <HI>Eighty</HI> miles he was off, that was more than I knew; I was told o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about <HI>Fifty</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most; and really expected he might ride it in one day: And the same day of the date of my <HI>Letter</HI> I sent it over the River to D. C. in order for conveyance with all speed; and at the messengers return he told that he (viz: D. C.) intended to go with it that Night or at furthest the next day Early; but it happened he did not go so soon as expected, and lost his way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; so that it was the Twelfth day of the Month early in the Morning that he delivered the Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o D.

But not one word of that then; no then it was in general terms, that he did not live convenient, and wanted to be Secured in person &amp;c. but how is it, that he hath not conditioned the security of his person in his second challenge? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>re being the same rea∣son for it, as when he writ his letter; but what doth he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of three days time to come and end the business: for in the <HI>first</HI> place he had near <HI>four</HI> days notice. <HI>Secondly,</HI> what great busi∣ness was it but to see whether. <HI>W.

As for his saying, I dare not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er it to any but my own party, he is at best much mistaken in that; for when I took him up, I did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lly expect he would chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on his part such as was not of our own party; and then why I should I be tyed up from chusing my friends, any more than he? and why he should say, let [us] cause <HI>four, six</HI> or <HI>more;</HI> and yet limit [me] in my choice; pray what choice is that? besides I see no reason at all, why I my not suspect the candidness of his party, with as much rea∣son as he doth mine: and what obligation doth he think ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Justices</HI> are under, any more than theirs, to set their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands to any design of mine, sons to signify what design to do? and why had not he <HI>Justice</HI>'s hand to his challenge? doth he th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k his credit so much better than his neighbour's, after his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing with the world by his vaunting and whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>?

<P>Quest. <HI>Prey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, what was that head that occasioned those words?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans▪</HI> Why the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> doctrine being this (viz.) That it was impossible for <HI>God</HI> to remitt or forgive sins without a full satisfaction made him by <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> person in the <HI>Trinity.

<P>Quest. <HI>By what arguments doth he refute the said</HI> doctrine <HI>from</HI> Scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Ans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> By <HI>three</HI> sorts of Arguments, the <HI>first</HI> is, that it cannot be impossible for <HI>God</HI> to pardon and forgive; because he had often promised so to do; for which he cites <HI>Exodus</HI> 34.6, 7. <HI>And the lord passed by before him,</HI> [Moses] <HI>the</HI> Lord God <HI>merci∣full and gracious, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity▪ transgression and Sin; with many more of the like import</HI> in his <HI>Se∣cond</HI> argument was, that it could not be impossible for <HI>God</HI> to for∣give, since it was not only possible, but enjoin'd to men to do it, for which he produced <HI>Matthew</HI> the 6.12.14 thus, <HI>Forgive us</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001094_0025_0FAFE0664143E9E0" MS="y"/>
<HI>our debts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forgive our debtors; for if you forgive men then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passes, your Heavenly</HI> Father <HI>will also forgive you</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Third</HI> Argument was, that <HI>Gods</HI> love to us, was not the effect of <HI>Christ's</HI> satisfaction; but that <HI>Christ</HI> is the proper gift &amp; effect of <HI>Gods</HI> love; for which he produced this <HI>Scripture,</HI> Iohn the 3.16. <HI>For</HI> God <HI>so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in him should not perish, but have everlast∣ing Life;</HI> with many more such like <HI>Scriptures;</HI> now, he having proved by those <HI>Three</HI> sorts of <HI>Arguments</HI> back'd with <HI>Three</HI> sorts of Suitable and distinct <HI>Scriptures,</HI> that it was not impossible for <HI>God</HI> to forgive without a plenary satisfaction made, he in the conclusion sums up the matter in short in his page 20. shewing thereby the absurdity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Doctrine when compared with the sense of those <HI>Sciptures</HI> and so places them in order in 1st. 2d. and 3d. heads; as hee had before placed his <HI>Scripture</HI> argu∣ments to shew their <HI>Doctrine</HI> false by; and made the <HI>First</HI> absur∣dity to be thus; (viz.) that <HI>God</HI> is gracious to forgive (he hav∣ing so proved from <HI>Scripture</HI>) and yet impossible for him, un∣less the debt be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll satisfied.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> obsurdity, which is to our point, was thus that the <HI>Finite impotent Creature</HI> is more capable of extending Mercy and forgiveness than the infinite and omnipotent <HI>Creator,</HI> he having before proved that Man who is a <HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>Impotent Creature</HI> was not only capable of extending Mercy and forgive∣ness, but was enjoin'd to do it. And now that the <HI>Reader</HI> may more fully see that I have not mingled or clipped <HI>William Pen's</HI> words so as to pervert the sense of them. I shall bestow the Transcribing of them verbatim where he begins thus viʐt.</P>

2. That the finite and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eature, is more capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tending Mercy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orgiveness, than the Infinite and Omnipotent Creator.</P>

<P>Now I appeal to the candid reader whether D. L. had any ground in Truth to assert and maintain, as in his challenges he doth, that W. P. here called Christ, as Man, the finite and impotent Creature; For first, though he says those Priest's Do∣ctrine compared with Scripture, that the finite impotent Creature is more capable of extending Mercy and forgiveness &amp;c. Yet by those words [finite impotent Creature] it's clear he meant it of us that were enjoined to forgive one another; but not of Christ, as man, by the reference those words have to those Scriptures he had before produced about our forgiving Trespas∣ses (who to be sure are finite impotent Creatures) to confute that Doctrine by: The sense of which Scriptures being compa∣red with their Doctrine makes the absurdity; but he had no where mentioned any thing of Christ forgiving us, to occasion such a reference; but it was of our forgiving one another; Just as the words next before them, to with [that God is gracious to for∣give] have a reference to the Scriptures he had there before men∣tioned to prove him so, as also. Just as the next words after to witt [that God so loved the World that he' gave his only Son to save it &amp;c.] have a reference to those foregoing Scriptures he there produced to prove it.</P>
<P><HI>Obj:</HI> Well, but D. L. saith, the only subject W. P. there treats on, is <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as he is the <HI>second</HI> person in the <HI>Tri∣nity,</HI> whom he calls finite impotent Creature; and denies him to have satisfied the infinite Justice of the <HI>Father,</HI> for that very reason; and calls it an absurdity so to believe.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001094_0031_0FAFE06AB8903980"/>
Ans: That's not the only subject W. P. there treats on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before.</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> But what do those words [so to believe] signify of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> late to?</P>
<P><HI>Ans:</HI> They relate to the absurdity of any ones believing that the finite impotent Creature should satisfy, the infinite Justice of the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj:</HI> But D. L. says That by finite impotent Creature W. <HI>Penn</HI> meant Christ, as Man.</P>
<P><HI>Ans:</HI> That cannot be reasonably supposed.</P>
<P>Quest: <HI>Why so?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans:</HI> Because though both the Priests and <HI>William Penn</HI> did own that Christ as man was finite Yet the Absurdity there laid down by W. P. was the Priest's aforesaid Doctrine of satisfacti∣on only compared with the <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>Quest: <HI>What was the</HI> Priests <HI>Doctrine? was it not that</HI> Christ, as man <HI>did satisfy?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans:</HI> No, no, and this is Close to the point; for the <HI>Priests Doctrine</HI> was that <HI>Christ</HI> satisfied, as he was both <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and not otherwise. As may be clearly seen by <HI>William Penn's</HI> then present opponent <HI>Thomas Vincent,</HI> who in his book called the <HI>Foundation</HI> of <HI>God</HI> &amp;c. Says <HI>It was necessary that the</HI> Person <HI>that should make</HI> Satisfaction <HI>shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be</HI> man; <HI>because none but a</HI> Creature <HI>could</HI> Suffer: <HI>it was necessary he should be</HI> God <HI>otherwise the</HI> suffering <HI>and</HI> satisfaction <HI>would have been but finite;</HI> and in page 65 <HI>He says</HI> God, <HI>separately cannot satisfy; because he cannot suffer: And</HI> man <HI>separately cannot satisfy; because the</HI> Satisfaction <HI>would not be of</HI> infinite <HI>value; yet as</HI> God-man <HI>(saith he) he sa∣tisfied:</HI> Now from what hath been said it's plain, that <HI>W.

For that was not the <HI>Priest's</HI> Doctrine; but the <HI>Priest's</HI> Doctrine was, that <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>sacred Person</HI> in the <HI>Trinity</HI> satisfied, as he was both <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man;</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that unless <HI>W.
