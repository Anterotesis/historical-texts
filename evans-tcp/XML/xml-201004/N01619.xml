<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have thought to leave you the Extract of all my Experienceth so far as may concern your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and because there are so many Books Printed, looking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cases, which I have often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣mended to you; my Labour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

the less, though your Pains the greater, in searching and studying them, which next to the Scriptures, I conjure you to acquaint your self withal; for never Age was so pregnant that way since our Saviour came in the Flesh, which Light I wish may grow to greater Glo∣ry. But to thy self:</P>
<P N="1">1. Above all things know, That no∣thing can do you any good without <HI>Union with Christ the Head;</HI> which can never be, till your <HI>Understanding be enlightened</HI> with the want of Christ, and His Worth, and then that your Will be so subdued to that Light, that it draw forth choice, and consent of, and to that only good, with an Em∣pire or Resolution to close with Him against Sin, World, Hell, Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And know this, That the necessity of a Christ (which the Understanding dis∣covers) will set the Will on work to all Duty, and (the worth in Christ it makes manifest) will make the Will delight: unless these two Faculties be thus wrought upon by the Word and Spirit, you will be at a constant less, and all the Miscarriages in Religion
<PB N="3" REF="001923_0007_0FBA1CBFDAE52990"/>
have the Ignorance of this for the Foun∣dation. Read <HI>Shepherds Convert, Daniel Rogers Practical Catechism,</HI> and <HI>Hooker,</HI> to this end, with such other helps as you may get: And herein I am the more earnest with you, because in this my Condition, I find that <HI>Ʋnion with Christ, and the Satisfaction Christ hath made to His Fathers Justice, by his Active and Passive Obedience, are the only Two Pillars that must Support a Soul leaving a mortal Body:</HI> For, as I profess my self Orthodox in all Points of Religi∣on, according to the <HI>Assemblies Confession,</HI> Explained by Others at the <HI>Savoy</HI> also so I have desired in nothing to be more Clear, than in the Two Doctrines a∣foresaid: I have wished you to be per∣fect in <HI>Romans</HI> 8. and mind <HI>verse</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and <HI>verse</HI> 28. well, with what follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the end of that Chapter: this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been my Experience, That the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ing of these Truths have be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greatest Advantage, and of most bene∣fit to Others: though in this I have e∣nough to bewail also.</P>
<P N="2">2. To this purpose, Hear the best Men, Keep the best Company, Read the
<PB N="4" REF="001923_0008_0FBA1CC106DB1C98"/>
best Books, especially make the Grounds of Religion your own: <HI>Balls</HI> and the <HI>Assemblies Catechism,</HI> with the like you have from me Commended to you: And though there are near an Hundred several <HI>Catechisms</HI> in the Nation; yet (if sound) they must speak one thing, viz. <HI>Man lost in Himself, Redeemed only by Christ,</HI> and holy Walking, or Thank∣fulness; you have my experience so of∣ten repeated to you, <HI>That an unbroken Heart, and an uncatechised Head, will keep distance enough betwixt God and a poor sinful Creature:</HI> Oh! that Parents and Ministers would think of it, what a heap of Mischiefs this Neglect hath produced.</P>
<P>The <HI>Waldenses</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> had never been so famous for <HI>Suffering,</HI> had they been <HI>uncatechized:</HI> This is a large <HI>Field,</HI> in which I could Walk long, Preach long, yea, lose my self in this sweet Wilderness: <HI>For this is life eter∣nal to know thee and Jesus Christ,</HI> Joh. 17.23. But take this for a Caution, That many may be well Taught also, who never took forth Christs first Three Lessons, never <HI>Denying themselves,</HI> nor <HI>Taking up the Cross,</HI> nor <HI>Following Him,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001923_0009_0FBA1CC34DE52CB8"/>
Matth. 16.24. We know no more than we Practise, yet we shall never Practise without Knowledge; How many Scriptures give Evidence to this? which I forbear to quote; only remem∣ber how <HI>Solomon</HI> extols <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>I take my share in Mourning, that I see in the Afternoon of this Age, the Shadow longer than the Substance, Profession than Practice; though the Trade may not be Condemned, when it falls into ill hands that manage it.</P>
<P>He that sets up Religion, to get any thing by it, more than the Glory of God, and the saving his own Soul, will make a bad Bargain of it in the close. <HI>My dear only Child,</HI> be rooted in the Truth, and thou shalt be Fruitful, and Thriving.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be constant in Reading the Scriptures, and that with a fervent Meditation, I mean, as to Pray in Praying, Fast in Fasting, so to Read in Reading: Many doubtless take up a cursory trade, to read out the Cries of a defiled or rackt Conscience: I say Read with delight, not as under a load,
<PB N="6" REF="001923_0010_0FBA1CC70E595700"/>
or as a Labourer, who waits for the shadow of the Evening, which you shall never do, unless your Heart be connatural with the Word; and there∣fore Remember as <HI>Justification</HI> takes a∣way <HI>Guilt,</HI> and <HI>Punishment; Sanctifica∣tion</HI> takes away the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Filth; Glorification</HI> takes away the <HI>Presence of Sin:</HI> So <HI>Effectual Calling</HI> takes away that <HI>Jarre</HI> that is betwixt the Soul and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God, by reason of Sin; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed of God read but their Fathers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>essed Will in reading His <HI>Word,</HI> His <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>stament,</HI> His <HI>Lagacies,</HI> His <HI>Precepts,</HI> His <HI>Threatnings</HI> against Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which His Child delights to hear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d. This one Book, well read, will answer my Question, or Case, and you'l find <HI>Solomons Proverbs</HI> the best <HI>Politicks,</HI> and Christ Crucified the best <HI>Divinity.</HI> But in reading the Scriptures let me reach out this Experience; When you have Prayed over your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>se that way, then in every Chap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> first mind the Method, then note <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> hard things you understand not, and get helps to clear them to you. And Lastly, Gather out the chief Doctrines, or Lessons, then in reading
<PB N="7" REF="001923_0011_0FBA1CC99281EA40"/>
one Chapter, you may understand ma∣ny: And if you read the Bible with the <HI>Annotations</HI> of some Divines, or the <HI>Dutch</HI> translated, it will not be amiss. I have formerly commended to you a Little <HI>English</HI> Library, in this kind, which I now fear, your so much al∣tered Condition will not give you time to be vers'd in: However, Remember <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 119. how every Verse almost shews Love to the Word. And truly you may be assured, you shall upon mine and your own Experience find, that you shall have no more Christ, nay God, Spirit, Faith, Peace, Com∣fort, than you have Scripture: Nor will you have any Christ, a Saviour, that is not a Scripture Christ. <HI>Oh that the word may dwell plentifully in you,</HI> my poor Child.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pray Continually,</HI> is the Apostles Counsel to the <HI>Thessalonians:</HI> And for this you may have far better helps, then from my unworthy unable self. There are many helps to <HI>Devotion,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bax∣ter, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rows, Gurnal, Bridge, &amp;c.</HI> Yet you shall have what I promised, even my <HI>Experience:</HI> I hope you know that
<PB N="8" REF="001923_0012_0FBA1CCB735CBE20"/>
Prayer is the breathing forth of holy Desires, or, lifting up the Soul unto God, or asking the Things we need from God, in and by Christ, accor∣ding to His Holy Will, not without Confessions, and Thanksgiving. This Work must have Time, Seriousness, Composure: And this take undoub∣tedly, <HI>That Prayers can never fly high, where the Person is not accepted; can have no strength without Faith:</HI> About this Duty, I must let you know, There are Three Miscarriages usually.</P>
<P>First, Before the Duty, <HI>Unprepared∣ness, Unsuitableness,</HI> Reaking hot out of the World, Self, Sin, into that Service; as if Men could leap into Gods Bosom, out of the Devils Lap: Before Prayer you need to study God, your self, and the <HI>Way to Him,</HI> John 6. You need to take a time when He is most like to hear, even when He is inditing for you, and puts <HI>Words into your mouth,</HI> Hos. 14.</P>
<P>The Second Failer in Prayer is, <HI>When you do not Watch to Prayer.</HI> O the Hur∣reys of our Hearts: the Thorowfare that
<PB N="9" REF="001923_0013_0FBA1CCD68583388"/>
carries crooked Thoughts through us, the Vanity, Folly, Obliquities of our Spirit: as the Heart must be whipt to the Duty, so it must be bound fast to it. How few Pray! How many say Words? Oh, how many say their Prayers backwards, call Him Father, who is not their Father, would not have His Name Hallowed, nor His Kingdom Come? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And Lastly, After this Duty there is either an aptness to be Proud: And add another Note, as if the Lord was in our Debt: or upon miscarriage in point of Inlargement, we grow wea∣ry and peevish, and call for our Prayers again, if we succeed not, as Lovers for the Portion, not the Person, call for their Love-Tokens back: Look on <HI>Th. Goodwin,</HI> on <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.6, 7, 1. Be plain and honest with God, shew your Sores, and His Love to you: You cannot be so bad as He is good. With the Old Martyr, I cry, Pray, Pray, Pray, (My dearest Child) Regard no Injury in thy heart.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="10" REF="001923_0014_0FBA1CD2D9697288"/>5. Keep a constant Watch, upon your whole Man, for which much hath been Written,, as <HI>Mr.</HI> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yners <HI>Rule for the New Creature.</HI> Mr. Brinsleys <HI>Watch;</HI> and many others, from the Thoughts, and Affections, to all Cases almost.</P>
<P>But since I promised the Addition of my <HI>Experience</HI> to your Self, I have held that very true, noted by <HI>David:</HI> yea, by some Heathens, That <HI>our Life is Seventy Years:</HI> half of which time spends it self in Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping: the Remainder is <HI>Thirty Five:</HI> and of that you may allow the first <HI>Fifteen,</HI> even for Child-hood till when ordinarily little is minded that is solid: then <HI>Twenty</HI> only are left of the Number, and of them even half spent in by-business: and then tell me how little do we live? How needful is it then that you be upon your Watch continually, when so many Silver Brooks run by many Doors un∣regarded.</P>
<P>It is hard to Watch, most are very Drowsie: The Disciples themselves could not Watch One Hour.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001923_0015_0FBA1CD3E076C698"/>My Advice is, That mainly <HI>you Watch your self in what you are, And where you are:</HI> These Two go far in your Watch; to see your self in a good Estate; And to be where you should be in your Duty and Employ∣ment, argues a curious Eye, and a careful Head: But to be very accurate in your Watch, and to keep off from troublesome Annears, keep a Book by you (I mean it literally) in which, e∣very Night before you sleep, you set down on the one side, the Lords gra∣cious Providence and Dealings with you; and your Dealings with Him on the other side: This Watch well kept, sits for Prayer, Fastings, Sabbath, Sacraments, and Death; upon which Judgment follows.</P>
<P>I pray Watch so, That <HI>Thoughts, Affections, Head, Heart, Hand, Foot,</HI> and all have a share in, and benefit by the Work.</P>
<P>The Flesh and the World, in all the Pleasures and Profits of them, send up fumes to the Head, occasioning sleep: Therefore the Lord is forced to keep us waking by Affliction, as the Thorn to the Singing Bird. <HI>David</HI> sought God
<PB N="12" REF="001923_0016_0FBA1CD56F6A5228"/>
early: The Three Women early look∣ing after Christ. <HI>Remember thy Creator</HI> betimes. And this <HI>Watching,</HI> is the <HI>Cir∣cumspect Walking,</HI> Ephes. 5.16. Look round about you continually, as if you <HI>Walked with God</HI> as <HI>Enoch, before God</HI> as <HI>Abraham:</HI> or, <HI>after God,</HI> as <HI>David:</HI> he walked in Gods Ways. If you do not <HI>Watch,</HI> you will be <HI>Tempted,</HI> I say, <HI>Tempted.</HI> The Lord Watch over thee, that thou mayest Watch (my dearest Child.)</P>
<P N="6">6. For thy growth in Grace, I am the more zealous, because (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.8.) the Apostle propounded it as a Cure against all the <HI>Errors of the wicked.</HI> For this also there are divers helps, as M. <HI>Symmons</HI> his Cure to <HI>Distressed Conscien∣ces,</HI> (a Choice Piece) and many others. But this you must know, that all la∣bour tends not to growth; no more than Ants grow in bulk, though very much in labour; Every great Hearer is not a great Grower: Nay, a tree may grow in parts, though not in all. Grow soundly in the Root <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Freeness</HI> of his Grace, and then you will not grow as Weeds do, but
<PB N="13" REF="001923_0017_0FBA1CD796785990"/>
as good Grain. To which purpose I advise you, to observe what you gain against Corruption, and so much you may hope, you may thrive in Grace; as the House of <HI>David,</HI> and the House of <HI>Saul.</HI> Do not therefore keep the De∣vils Counsel; but let some able Friend <HI>Watch</HI> you, to whom communicate your Decays or Growth. When a Ship is observed by a Land-mark, her way is easily observed. Therefore mind much this one thing, in all make much of a Rule, and keep to it; as few under the warm Gospel but know whether they be Hypocrites or otherwise. Even so you shall feel your Growth. An old stock will not serve turn (which hath been the delusion of many) when every day needs new Incomes of the Spirit, and so advance∣ment to Heaven.</P>
<P>Long to grow, strive to grow; be∣wail decayes: grow in both the Ta∣bles Duties.</P>
<P>The Apostle tells us of growth from Vertue; yea, at last to Patience by Affliction, if we hear the Rod, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Christs method is, He hath all Grace. He giveth out what He pleaseth; He
<PB N="14" REF="001923_0018_0FBA1CDE56D72330"/>
maintains what He gives▪ He perfects what He maintains; He Crowns what He perfects: And thus Christ loves you, more than ever you could hate Him, without whose watering by His Blood you can never grow. The best Evidence of Growth, is to grow more Humble, more Holy, at∣tend that well: and see how it is from Meal to Meal, from one Sabbath to a∣nother, one Sermon to another: are you fed or surfeited? A very very little Grace (if true) is saving: a little Growth (if right) is comforting: Be∣lieve and Live, Believe and Grow; all decayes come through want of Faith: to fetch Blood from the Life Vein, the Lord Christ. The South and North blow upon thee for Growth (my Child.)</P>
<P N="7">7. In all things as you will have use: so you need to study Conscience well, for it Eats, Drinks, Walks, Sleeps, Buys, Sells, accompanies you to every Duty, Service, Work, Doing, or Suffering; for which you have <HI>Ames</HI> his <HI>Cases,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001923_0019_0FBA1CDFC0D7ED58"/>It is a judging your self according to the judgment of God.</P>
<P>I Write none of these Heads to you, as intending any common place, which this and others would make; but only to leave with you a few practical thoughts upon each.</P>
<P>Our Saviour made the <HI>Jews</HI> to buy a Knife to cut their own Throats, when he told them the Parable of the Ser∣vants, and Son, sent and killed: and so the Spirit by the <HI>Jews,</HI> Isai. 5. when he made them impannel a Jury among themselves, and by Conscience their Judge: So <HI>Nathan</HI> by <HI>David,</HI> it is a Witness with a Witness, and Judge Paramount: therefore I wish you to observe it narrowly, if you suffer it to be defiled with the least Sin, whilst it hath Life you may hear of it; and therefore <HI>Samuel</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> in all, kept all clear there; the least filth must be washt out by the Blood of Christ: <HI>Da∣vid</HI> paid dear for it; <HI>Cains</HI> Building, and <HI>Sauls</HI> Harping, will do but little to cure it; it may be quiet and good, unquiet and good, and so on the other hand; but this I have noted, that false Lights or dim ones, have helpt much
<PB N="16" REF="001923_0020_0FBA1CE20551ADD8"/>
to the violation of it: present things and the out-sides of things, have also broke in upon it: and in Sinning, whether the wound be in the Head or Conscience first, is a question, but not hardly resolved.</P>
<P>Your wisdom will be to live upon a directing Word: and then Consci∣ence will make a soft Bed for you in your greatest sorrow: <HI>A wounded Cons∣cience who can bear?</HI> Go to our first Parent, and he will tell you so, who might have gathered fruit to eat, ra∣ther than leaves to cover himself.</P>
<P>Do not grieve Conscience twice, it must be your best Friend, yea, when Friends, and World, and all leave you to solitariness.</P>
<P>If it whimper a little, do not make it roar out: and yet do not stiffle it, but attend it, and carry it up to <HI>Mount Cavalry</HI> for peace.</P>
<P>Remember, a good Conscience and Sin cannot live together: Let but this Bird sing sweetly within, and let Heaven and Earth come together, thou shalt be safe, (my poor Child.)</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="17" REF="001923_0021_0FBA2D29D5B10250"/>8. Next I am to remember you, that you have much work to do in a lit∣tle time: which calls you up to La∣bour, as the Day the Lark, and the Lark the Husbandman; <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12. the whole Chapter: I hope you have it.</P>
<P>About Redemption of time, you have many Treatises. The greatest of your work in your short time, is to get Christ, and live upon Him, and to Him; And this is the life of Faith, which you can never live, unless Faith have to live upon it self, which will digest nothing but Word, and Promises: Therefore now you are Young, lay in a good Stock for Faith to live on; but you must do it sea∣sonably; you are Young I say, and may have a little time before you, which certainly hath Eternity hang∣ing upon it; called a Race, a Day, or Hour: the Old World had their Day, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> a Day, the Gospel is called the Day of Grace: Therefore lay in seasonably; and not only so, but abun∣dantly, for your Market may be at the highest; Foolish Virgins had Oyl in their Lamps, none in their Vessels: <HI>Store is no Sore;</HI> for you know not
<PB N="18" REF="001923_0022_0FBA2D3137EF84E0"/>
what Promises you may need, for Want, for Reproach, for Sickness and Death.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of Heaven must suffer Violence: Violent Faith, Love, Prayer, must storm it.</P>
<P>The time will come when wishes will not help; your own Works and Righteousness will fail.</P>
<P>Lastly, Lay up your stock for Faith conveniently, that you may reach a Word when you need it most. Ah that you would be wise! Ask your heart at Night, what you have done that Day in this Point, because every Night may be your last.</P>
<P>Therefore secure your Principles, walk up to the Compass of every Du∣ty, clear your Evidences, keep close Communion with God, Look out to growing Evils, and fit for them; And these are the work of your Generation.

I must also invite you to Content in a Low Condition, for which you have great furtherance, as Mr. <HI>Burrows</HI> for <HI>Contentment</HI> (whose Writings are all savory) But for my own thoughts they are these, That though many write and speak of the Contempt of the World, some cloyster up themselves from it; yet very few are Masters of this Art, which the Apostle himself had been long learning.</P>
<P>Constitution, Age, Experience, Parts, Afflictions, Fulness, Honour, Glory, will all say, We have it not; Crowns have it not; and Beggars want it: I was about to say, it is only in Heaven. This Herbs grows in very few Gardens. But Oh that you might be truly Con∣tent!</P>
<P>You will find a <HI>But</HI> upon all your Comforts; and therefore you cannot be contented: You may find a fulness in Christ, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.19. And therefore you should be Contented. Mind the Dis∣ease, and the Cure in this Case.</P>
<P>First, All your under-moon Refresh∣ings, or Comforts, are too short, and too narrow Beds for Content to lye in.</P>

<P>Thirdly, They are short liv'd. Ri∣ches have Eagles wings, and Beauty but skin deep; Honour in anothers keeping: Friends and all, are but waking Dreams.</P>
<P>Content must have something to answer all the defects of the Creature; and it only dwells where all Questions are fully answered, springing from thence.</P>
<P>A Naked Soul meeting with a Naked Christ, can only be quieted in Spiri∣tuals, and the same Christ improved also for Temporals: Sin is pardoned, Iniquities and Corruptions done away; the Favour of God gained▪ the Spirit bearing Witness to Adoption, answers all; for to this you must roul at length.

Nor do I oppose Meekness to Zeal, but would have you to allow both their perfect work. Meekness will make smooth all your ways, disappoint Enemies of the advantage they may take against you; And your Love will not only cover many Sins, but help many out of them: Indeed these will be a strong guard unto you, and Grief will hardly get footing long,

<P>When you lose a poor Father, or a rich Freind, you will be able to say you knew them Mortal, and will be quiet, though not sensless. It will fit you for Meditation, a duty even out of Doors, and very hardly practised: I know the sad Experience of Passion, how it bars the door against Prayer and other Duties: Oh! how can we lift up wrathful hands to Heaven? They say, Anger is the boyling of the Blood about the Heart; I am sure it cools the Heart in Spirituals: God too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ils to Himself, when He disco∣vered His Name to <HI>Moses,</HI> a Pitiful, Pardoning, Long-Suffering God.

<P N="11">11. Beware of a trifling loose Heart, which hath been the guise, and the bane of many in these last days of Liberty, and the decay of that old solemn, serious spirit, and sober, that was among and upon the Ancient Professors of Religion, was very visi∣ble, and broke out to the common vanity of the World, in Dyet, Cloaths, Recreations, condemn'd and threatned, <HI>Isai.</HI> 3.

in any Age.) But new Temptations drew forth old Corruptions, made good by the changes the <HI>Israelites</HI> were under, and their trifling with God under all His bounty to them, till they scorn Manna and Ease, and would have Garlick and Oppression. It much appear'd in this, that it grew common to dispute Principles, even the highest, and most consented to; as also in slighting Promises, Vows, Ingagements, Oaths, Inconstancy in Duty, undervaluing Authority; sha∣ken Men were with every Wind, like to every Company; Ministers many Words, and Frothy, Shells, and Out∣sides, most Men playing fast and loose with God.

<P><PB N="25" REF="001923_0029_0FBA2D41EAE32FE0"/>This trifling, springs either from a Heart and Head never kindly wrought upon, or never well way'd: where Sin hath been, or is an easie burden, there Men trifle with their Spirits; and where Men are not guided by a Rule, they will prove the Chil∣dren of Changes; it grows as other evils, gradually, and soon Conspicu∣ous in some Constitutions, like <HI>Da∣vids</HI> Waters, from the Ancle, soon o∣ver the Head. I must tell you, Thoughts are not free, nor Words wind, they will judge us one Day, and from thence this Trifling comes. The best cure I know by experience, I say by woful experience, of this evil, will be to look within the Vail, to the Mercy-Seat, made of pure Gold, for free Grace to help against so great a mischief; and then to be much in Prayer, Communion of Saints, Fasting, and holy Duties, to lay some more weight upon this spirit, and often to mingle the sense of Sin, to take a∣way this Froth and Lightness.

Sin is a breach of the Law, <HI>and the strength of Sin is the Law</HI> from that breach, the Soul being as well left to Sin the Keeper, as to Satan the Jaylor, by the Fall, and nothing but the Sa∣tisfaction of Christ, put in to Divine Justice, can remit the Authority of it; yea, though the power and filth in part be taken away by Sanctification, yet it will break in again, as an in∣mate, and will at least get some out-room, as Pride in Cloaths, Cozenage in Dealings, Lust in the Eye, Passion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and bad work it makes, where∣ever it is; Oh keep it at staves length: <HI>Peter, David, Heman</HI> and others ever crack under it: As you cannot build your Reformation upon unrepented Sin; so you should not make daily work
<PB N="41" REF="001923_0045_0FBA2D6F4545CAE0"/>
for Repentance, by admitting Sin, which must be reformed. Therefore to prevent this mischief, you must exer∣cise hatred against it, as against an Enemy that cut the throat, or would, of your best Friends, and yours also, and pursue it with a deadly feud; hate it in all the stock and linage of it, my Child.</P>
<P>A little Sin is Sin, down with it, keep your guard, and hate it in all the forrage that may maintain such an Enemy: I mean, in the occasions leading to it: in which I might be large. On with all your Armour speedily: and when you find it hath bespotted you, do as a good houswife with her Linnen, get a Washing-day, I mean a Fasting-day, out with it by hand, laver, bucking; if it be a stain that gets through and through, it will out the next Spring for bleaking, I mean, a Sin premeditated as <HI>Davids:</HI> a few common tears will not help there, but extraordinary, and the Blood of Christ above all. Ask the Damned what they ail? Sin, Sin, they cry. Ask the distressed Consci∣ence?
<PB N="42" REF="001923_0046_0FBA2D706A4A9960"/>
Sin too. Ask the Afflicted? Sin. <HI>For the Bulrush will not grow without mire.</HI> That which crosses the Law of God, make thy greatest cross; that which divides you from the best Good, call your worst Evil. It made Christ to bleed, to groan, to die. The Lord sprinkle thy Conscience with the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant, that you may not Sin to Death, My dear Child.</P>
<P N="19">19. And next (because bordering upon what went before) I would add a case, which so often, even choice Christians are incumbred with, and that is, Their questioning all their works after many years Experience and Profession; and their Objections, many against themselves; as from Sins before Conversion, in Conversion, af∣ter it; repeated Sins, against Judg∣ment, Mercy, Light, Means; yea, even cutting Purses under the Gal∣lows; against all Examples, and what not? Nay, it cannot stand with Gods honour to save, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though <HI>Isai.</HI> 55.8. answers all.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="001923_0047_0FBA2D71D46E1A40"/>This therefore I would have you know, that though it be not safe to dig at Foundations often, lest we shake the Building; so our great care is to have sound Foundations to build upon, which in the general is Christ, and other none can lay. Make quick work, and see you be in Christ, and offer your Evidences to a discerning Friend, or more; and know, that God hath limited his tenders of Grace to a day of this Life, of the Gospel, and of Conscience awakened; therefore look out whilst it is <HI>To day.</HI></P>
<P>Put by Spiritual sloth, Cares of this World, bosom Corruptions, or what∣ever may hinder; God is not bound to your limitings: Were it not from His Mercy, and to leave every Soul inexcusable, why should the Lord give any time of Grace? Remember, this day ends suddainly; How unwor∣thy to put the Lord off till to mor∣row, and how retaliated? See <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.29, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Your delays rob your Soul long of Comfort, and you keep your self the longer out of Christ's Service. The nature of Sin is poison, do not stay till

to morrow for an <HI>Antidote</HI> What got <HI>Lots</HI> Wife by lingring in <HI>Sodom?</HI> The Lord must pull us out. Nor can you plead any thing for hereafter which you may not now. Oh to work, to work; and if you find it will not a∣mount to Grace, then cry mightily; Ply the Lord with all the Promises of His Free-grace, <HI>Isai.</HI> 55.1. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11. last. <HI>Revel.</HI> 22.17. <HI>Isai.</HI> 53. the whole Chapter: <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.1. and many more.</P>
<P>Tell the Lord, none so vile as you, none so good as Himself: Tell Him, His Nature is Mercy, He may be a gainer by His Grace: However, hang upon Him living and dying in the use of all mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>Hos.</HI> 14.3, 4, 5.</P>
<P>But if you have your share in Christ, though hardly discerned; make much of it, you need walk very humbly, very h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly: do not question continu∣ally, as some do, <HI>Psal.</HI> 18.1. Love the Lord who hath been your strength, and will answer all thy hard questions, dear Child.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="45" REF="001923_0049_0FBA2D7AD56AD190"/>20. I add hereunto your Case, under cross Providences: yea, such as where Promises seem to speak one thing, and Providence another; Under which the best Saints have had great and strange sinkings of spirit; For which you have <HI>Sibbs, Burrows,</HI> and others to help.</P>
<P>My poor thoughts also are these for Case and Cure; When <HI>Job</HI> faints, <HI>Job</HI> 4.5. When <HI>David</HI> chides his soul, <HI>Psal.</HI> 42. When <HI>Heman</HI> is even distracted, <HI>Psal.</HI> 88.15. <HI>Jacob</HI> will not be com∣forted, <HI>Gen.</HI> 37.35. and so divers. This great Dissertion springs from ei∣ther the overweening some Comforts we enjoy, our overvaluing them breeds much trouble in the loss of them: So <HI>David</HI> with his <HI>Absolom;</HI> or from the surprisal being sudden and unexpected; a prison at first uncouth, in time easie and sweet; where a mortified heart grows suited to it: (to this I could speak much) or else it may spring from some secret weight God may put into this Change of Providence, which we are not aware of; and so the scale grows heavy with some Lead hanging at the bottom unseen: a small thing
<PB N="46" REF="001923_0050_0FBA2D7C4EABC0A8"/>
troubles more than a greater: the for∣mer we apply to our own strength in it, but for the other to Gods. Or last∣ly, it may spring from the Dispensa∣tion it self; As when the Cross is heavy, or multiplied, or of long conti∣nuance, or toucheth some noble part; as wounds that touch the Liver, Heart, Brain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay, I must tell you, when we make our Case worse than God doth, as by our refusing the Lords Comforts, which <HI>Jacob</HI> did, <HI>Gen.</HI> 37. or where we let loose the Reins of Passion, as <HI>David, On my son, my son! &amp;c.</HI> Or when we drown all our present Enjoy∣ments in that one cross Providence, which is too near the spirit of <HI>Haman,</HI> who cross by <HI>Moraecat,</HI> slights all his Favours at Court, and dies upon the other.</P>
<P>Your Cure in all this will be, To be willing to want, what God is not wil∣ling to give, and to know He is wife, to give what He will, how He will, and when He will: for the godly▪ Heart for Temporals cries, <HI>Lord, what thou wilt:</HI> and in Spirituals, <HI>When thou wilt:</HI> and in both, <HI>How thou wilt:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part must be no chusers, and any thing
<PB N="47" REF="001923_0051_0FBA2D7E9F510B48"/>
is good from the Hand of such a Father.</P>
<P>Your Interest in Christ, supplies all, and sweetens all: but with the Doves Innocency, use the Serpents Wisdom; live in daily waiting and expectation of Changes, even in your best and holiest condition here: Deaths-heads, and Hour-glasses will be but ordinary significant Ceremonies: it is within you that cruciats, or comforts: He that made the World, can change it when He will: Your Comfort will will be, that in the greatest Storm, your Heavenly Father is at the Helm; though Sin and Satan bussle: that Hand keep you, My dear Child.</P>
<P N="21">21. And if you ask me (after all) what you shall do with your fears to which your Sex and Condition prompt you? You shall have what I know, though the Lord Jesus answers all to His little Flock when He says, <HI>Fear not;</HI> yea, more particularly, <HI>Fear not them that can only kill the Body,</HI> and destroy that. You must know that your question will mainly lie about base and unwarrantable fears, which have these roots: Either (when our of this fear)
<PB N="48" REF="001923_0052_0FBA2D812A0268E8"/>
you are loth to part with that the Lord would have you let go, or would part with that the Lord would have you keep; as when you wrangle about some Corruption, especially which is dear unto you, and hath some great disadvantage attending your throwing it away. These kinds of fear are ac∣companied with these mischiefs. As you will be unwilling to know your duty, so you will be unwilling to practise it when you know it; yea, not only so, but (through fear) be as unable, as unwilling: like that trem∣bling King at the hand-writing he saw. The inconveniences are very many, and the Sins not few that follow it. The cure in general, even for <HI>Peter,</HI> who (by it) denied his Master, is this, <HI>That whoever fears to sin, never sins by fear:</HI> and more particularly, <HI>The ab∣sence of some good you desire, or the coming on of some evil, draws out this fear:</HI> Therefore make much of this Rule; Be ever possest of some good, that may answer the taking away of what you may lose, which is the presence and favour of God in Christ: In the night the waking Child in the Cradle is
<PB N="49" REF="001923_0053_0FBA2D84B38869D0"/>
quiet at the Nurses coming to it, be∣cause there is more of comfort in the Nurse, than fear in the dark.</P>
<P>And then be perswaded to set a right value upon all earthly, perishing, dy∣ing things; do not call a Pebble a Pearl. But above all, keep your fear in his proper channel: Oh <HI>fear God, fear God.</HI> It is not only the <HI>beginning of wisdom,</HI> but the <HI>perfection of your joys,</HI> which kept <HI>Joseph,</HI> and others of the Saints from Sin.</P>
<P>My earnest desire for you is, That the Lord would give you an even and e∣qual spirit, and the root of it, Integri∣ty: <HI>That</HI> (as the Righteous) <HI>you may be bold as a Lyon,</HI> and yet <HI>rejoyce with trembling.</HI> In this good fear I leave you, My dear Child.</P>
<P N="22">22. And if the Evil you fear, and a day of Affliction come upon you; then my counsel is, (bear with the feebleness of it in all) take that Rule, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.14. <HI>In that evil day,</HI> or day of your <HI>distresses,</HI> you must <HI>Consider:</HI> which is (as the Word bears) by so∣lemn and diligent though fulness to
<PB N="50" REF="001923_0054_0FBA2D89909FFF28"/>
take things asunder, especially sorrows and sins: For the little Needle will draw a long tail of Thread after it: little Sins may be followed with great Sorrows, to set you at your work.</P>
<P>First, You must see the evil of Ad∣versity in the nature of it, such a plague, and such a visitation: and in the causes of it: As in the principal, none of that evil <HI>in the city,</HI> but from the Lord.</P>
<P>In the Meritorious Cause, there look at Sin, and search closely, and men the Final Cause, God will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e glori∣fied by your Humiliation or Ruine; He will either bend you or break you; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He doth when Nations. Chur∣ches, and every Individual.</P>
<P>But for the Instrumental Cause, tra∣vel not much there. Though <HI>Pharoah</HI> were the occasion of the Planges, not the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> Sins, the Cause.</P>
<P>Secondly, in such an evil time you must l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e by Faith (to <HI>Habbakkuk</HI>) and <HI>will unto God:</HI> for this must be your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> no condition superseds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be performed:</HI> And in
<PB N="51" REF="001923_0055_0FBA2D8AAAE844A8"/>
these you may not dally, it is your life.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To get out of such a day and case, you may not act unlaw∣fully; nor did <HI>Paul</HI> in going out in a <HI>Basket.</HI></P>
<P>Take these Rules,</P>
<P>First, See what the Word says, if you can find a parallel case and help.</P>
<P>Secondly, If that be dark, see what Providence suggests; but that you must neither Slight nor Cross, nor out run.</P>
<P>Lastly, If here you want Light, then live and die upon the counsel of Im∣partial friends, that you may trust Gods way in doubtful and hard cases.</P>
<P>And be assured that in distress (I know not) if Enemies bring your Re∣lease, it will be too late; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Friends bring it, it may be too soon; but if God do bring it, it will be seasonable.</P>
<P><HI>I will hear what the Lord will say,</HI> cries the Prophet: So do you, (M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>deas Heart.)</P>
<P N="23">23. Though in part I have hinted something about <HI>Errors,</HI> yet in this age and juncture, I need let you know what
<PB N="52" REF="001923_0056_0FBA2D8C18613600"/>
I know, since the importunity of Er∣ror hath brought forth so many Obli∣quities, and occasioned so much scan∣dal to Religion the World thorow.</P>
<P>And because many have touched hereupon (as you see in their Wri∣tings,) and many more <HI>Polemicks</HI> and <HI>Disputes</HI> are Printed than profitable, eve∣ry Party striving their own advance∣ment; this I have said, this I must say, That whoso departs from those Funda∣mentals profest, and died upon by the Saints and Martyrs since the reforma∣tion and departure from <HI>Popery,</HI> need to have his Opinion written in Stars: for <HI>If an Angel bring another Gospel, he or it may not be received, that shall con∣tradict what we have received already from the Lord Jesus.</HI> It is a continuing word. Oh that it might abide in us, and with us.</P>
<P>Two things in such a danger I com∣mend unto you:</P>
<P>First, Observe, or ask your self or o∣thers what frame of spirit or heart you are in, when you receive this novel∣ty; and if I mistake not, When the heart is Proud, Lazie, or Frothy, neg∣lects communion with God, duty, and
<PB N="53" REF="001923_0057_0FBA2D8DA0CBCC38"/>
exactness, then a cover-cup for such corruption is sought after; then Prea∣chers understand nothing; then men can live without God, Ordinances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>You must know that this work is gradual: The Ship sails through the Channel, where she may have Land on both sides, before she come to the Main, and loseth sight of all Land.</P>
<P>But this you will certainly find, That if these People would speak out, they have changed their Opinions a∣bout God, before they change about His Ways. I could be very large in this, accounting it my very great Mer∣cy, that temptation never led me from that Honest, Old, Godly, <HI>Puritan</HI> Pro∣fession of the everlasting truths of the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Enquire whether they have been carried more to God and Holiness since their change. For that which comes from God, will carry us to God: but if only to <HI>Pride, Censuring, Libertism, &amp;c.</HI> you know what to make of it.</P>
<P><HI>Beware of Leaven of the Pharisees,</HI> (Christ says) for <HI>Leaven</HI> will sowre the <HI>Dough:</HI> will swell it, will harden
<PB N="54" REF="001923_0058_0FBA2D9480BB8BB8"/>
it, and these you meet with in mens spirits leavened with <HI>Error.</HI> Where men once leave the Rule, there will be no end of their running, till they come to <HI>Atheism.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore stand in awe of God, and fear Him always; Hold to the Word as to Life; Question not Truths: Look to your Company: Value the meanest Ordinance: You will need all. Be very low and humble before the Lord, and <HI>Grow in Grace,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.18. (My dear Child.)</P>
<P N="24">24. And because the first Child that appears in view of this <HI>Jesabel,</HI> the Mother of Mischief <HI>(Error)</HI> so called by <HI>John, Rev.</HI> 2.20. is about the <HI>Sab∣bath:</HI> either wholly slighting it, or counting it <HI>Jewish:</HI> or our day not the right day, not the Seventh: yea that every day is a Sabbath, with the like: I mean besides all such as pro∣fanely look upon it as a day of Sport, Pleasure, and Vanity: I think it my duty to Charge you, (as ever you mean or hope to enjoy that everlasting Rest hereafter) that you would value the Sabbath. Read <HI>Dod</HI> and others a∣bout it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="001923_0059_0FBA2D95CC127C10"/>I do not remember that I have ever met with a truly Godly gracious Soul, that lived above or beyond this.</P>
<P>The First <HI>Commandment</HI> sets up the true God, The Second His Worship according to His own Will, The Third His Reverence and Honour, and the Fourth <HI>Time,</HI> the Seventh part of <HI>Time</HI> for Him, is holy <HI>Time,</HI> Works of Necessity and Charity not crossing that Holiness.</P>
<P>I say the Seventh part of <HI>Time,</HI> be∣cause it is Night in one place, when Day in another; which <HI>Time</HI> begins at the Evening, as <HI>Time</HI> is distinguished into days, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1: And though the Questions about the <HI>Sabbath</HI> and <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> breed much dispute in the World, yet we must Study to know Gods Will in both.</P>
<P>I must say more to you: Where the Sabbath is at an under-value in any Country, say it be <HI>France, Holland, Ger∣many, &amp;c.</HI> there you shall find Religion low, and at best wasting it self into Disputes. But know that <HI>England</HI> (which is most famous for Religion) got it from the Sabbaths, upon which Day the Lord is pleased (as Princes by
<PB N="56" REF="001923_0060_0FBA2D975EAD9B70"/>
their <HI>Almoners</HI>) to give out His Gifts and Graces to the sons of Men.</P>
<P>I was a witness that <HI>Middleburgh</HI> in <HI>Zealand</HI> grew famous for Religion, by <HI>Teeling</HI> their Preacher fetching the keeping of the Sabbath from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly the Fourth <HI>Commandment</HI> is the Key to all the rest; for how shall the rest be practised if not taught? and how taught, if not time allowed? and what time more likely to carry a Blessing, than Gods Appointment?</P>
<P>It were as good to take down Mi∣nistry, and all Ordinances, as to take down the Sabbath.</P>
<P>The wonders of God have born wit∣ness (as <HI>Burton</HI> and others write) a∣gainst the Breakers of it.</P>
<P>Wherefore look well about you, <HI>Isai.</HI> 58.13. Love the Lord in His Sabbaths, as you would have rest hereafter. Look to this Rest here, and remember the Sabbath; that is, Prepare for it all the Week long, especially the Evening be∣fore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> had two Preparations to the Sabbath, at Three, and Six.</P>
<P>Do you keep on, and gather home all Affections to wait upon the Work,
<PB N="57" REF="001923_0061_0FBA2D9B9C129988"/>
and let the day be dear to you. <HI>The God of Sabbath be yours,</HI> (dear Child.)</P>
<P N="25">25. The Premises considered, I should a little open what I mean by <HI>Free Grace,</HI> to which I send you so often for succour in Cases; and truly it hath been much spoken of, and as much a∣bused, as if men from thence might take leave for any evil; and on the other hand also, filth cast upon men that have la∣boured to hold it forth; for which Dr. <HI>Crisp</HI> suffered also, and some of that mind, who meant faithfully to the Church of Christ, and have written much for the abasement of the Creature, and lifting up Grace.</P>
<P>I wish we may judge right judgment of all men, and things.</P>
<P>But a little Practically to cast in some∣thing to profit you:</P>
<P>The Grace so spoken of, should main∣ly be minded as the Root and Fruits of the New Covenant, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. and that in <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.19, 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which you will find lie upon two Parties, <HI>Christ,</HI> and the poor <HI>Believer;</HI> and Christ to be con∣sidered in a double Act of his:</P>
<P>First, In his loving, or rather mani∣festing
<PB N="58" REF="001923_0062_0FBA2D9C8F2FEC98"/>
his love, in time to the soul, And,</P>
<P>Secondly, In passing over that Right he hath in himself to the believing soul.</P>
<P>Answerable whereunto, the soul first from Christs love is warm'd to love again; and from his bounty in his se∣cond Act, turns over all the soul hath to the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> whether Name, Estate, Wit, Parts, yea all its Interests.</P>
<P>Now Christ thus loving the soul, and giving himself upon no Meritori∣ous or procuring Cause on the souls side, is called <HI>Free Grace</HI> indeed; when the Father shall freely give his Son, and the Son freely his Heart-blood, and the Spirit freely all its operations, and make a free Covenant of grace and mercy to pardon all sin, to receive a sinner into his bosom, <HI>without money or price;</HI> nay not to offer any thing of his own, either Duty, or Righte∣ousness, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. this call <HI>Free Grace:</HI> though when Christ comes to manifest this, he (by the Law) gets Parly with the sinner he means to save, by some uncouth wayes, and often very cross to flesh and blood, which makes the work hard to judge of at first: yet be
<PB N="59" REF="001923_0063_0FBA2D9EB2CD37F0"/>
assured that the whole work will be Free, in the whole Frame of it.</P>
<P>But because this point is of such singular concernment, and that I have formerly delighted to speak to others touching the same, and would have the comfort of it my self, I shall let you know what I know about the or∣der of the working hereof, that you mistake not.</P>
<P N="26">26. And in the letting you in this Light, to give you the sum of true practical Divinity: and therefore ob∣serve with diligence, That when a discovery is made of this Love to the Sinnes, the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> makes a double approach to the Soul; the first is by the Law, where he takes three steps: And first, by the Law he stops the Sinner in his course, and makes him to see Sin in the very nature of it, not in the Hell only, and consequence; but in that it separates the Soul from the greatest good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.7. And, Secondly, makes the soul bear the burthen, and weight of it, which makes <HI>David</HI> himself cry out often, and so others: It pincheth hard where sin hath got time and strength,
<PB N="60" REF="001923_0064_0FBA2DA0CB0A2048"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thirdly, it lets the soul to know, that he is not able to satisfie Divine justice, and so the Law may be called a <HI>School-master</HI> to Christ though the Text leads to the <HI>Ceremonial;</HI> the <HI>Cere∣monies</HI> being the Gospel of the <HI>Jews.</HI> These three steps of Love Christ takes in the Law by his first approach.</P>
<P>Secondly, In his Gospel-approach he takes these steps:</P>
<P>First, He holds forth himself to the sinner, a Mediator of the New Cove∣nant, and a free pardon of sin, this keeps the soul from despair.</P>
<P>Secondly, He lets you know that he is as able, and as willing as ever to do it, <HI>Colos.</HI> 1.19. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This keeps the soul in heart and hope.</P>
<P>Thirdly, By that which they call the Reflex Act, he brings home a par∣ticular Promise of Grace to the soul, as <HI>Revel.</HI> 3.17. and the Spirit of Christ thus argues:</P>
<P><HI>He that is athirst must freely come.</HI></P>
<P>But (sayes the Spirit) <HI>Thou art thirsty,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore come freely.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I use to say:</P>
<P>A pitiful, nasty, ragged, fatherless,
<PB N="61" REF="001923_0065_0FBA2DA6D09A7148"/>
friendless Child, is lying dying in a ditch: A noble bountiful hand means to save him, and adopt him; first sends a servant to awaken him, and bring him to his Court-gate; then bids another let him in, a third to wash him, and put him on clean clothes; another to read him the Order of his House; another to set him at Table with his Children; another to shew him his present, and future estate.</P>
<P>Thus the Spirit of <HI>Humiliation</HI> first wakens a miserable lost sinner, and that by the Law, and can only bring him to the Gate: Then <HI>Vocation</HI> opens the Door: Then <HI>Justification</HI> puts on Christs Righteousness: <HI>Sancti∣fication</HI> teacheth him how to walk, taking away the Power of sin: <HI>Adop∣tion</HI> makes him a Brother, and gives him his Privileges: And <HI>Glory</HI> begun here in part, by sanctifying, shews him his estate. And all this hath its rise from Free Grace, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> 16. For God found us in our blood.</P>
<P>The Lord open your eyes, and make this a time of Love to you, dear Child.</P>
<P N="27"><PB N="62" REF="001923_0066_0FBA2DA7D1FBB2E0"/>27. But whilst I speak to you of Free-grace, I must let you know that in the next Place I must commend unto you, accurate walking, as the fruit thereof: and for your better understanding, I commend unto you divers of the afore∣said Books: so my own thoughts are, that it consists in all manner of Christi∣an Circumspection, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.15. to look within you, without you, about you, beneath you, to all and every duty: and the rather, because Gods eye is ever, and every where upon you: Oh that you could so walk, so think: and not only so, but you have bad Men observing, who, by your negligence, may either infest your Liberties, or infect you with their Evils, or at best be har∣der drawn-on to the ways of God by your careless example: Add hereunto, that you have the eyes of good Men upon you; and if they be Young Christians, you may make the Ways of God like Giants and Brazen Walls unto them, carry much difficulty and discouragement with them; or, if ancient Christians, you may send them with grief to their Graves by your Mis∣carriages;
<PB N="63" REF="001923_0067_0FBA2DA94BA819B0"/>
and not only so, but the very way of Religion is like a Nar∣row Bridge, you need step advisedly that you may keep upon it, or, if fall, you may recover with much trouble: there is a great cause you should be wise, for Free grace will never teach sin, nor folly; which that you may have help in, consider what is said from the above-said Arguments, and weigh them well; and not only so, but study the Lives of all the Saints in Scripture, and do but see what trophees of their failings sin hath hung up, and Satan: <HI>Davids</HI> sins of Adul∣tery and Murther, <HI>Peters</HI> Denial of his Master, <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> Pride and Vani∣ty in shewing his Treasury, <HI>Jonahs</HI> Impatience and Folly, with the like: And see <HI>Pauls</HI> and <HI>Samuels</HI> Integrity, <HI>Phineas</HI> his Zeal, <HI>Nathaniels</HI> Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> On the other hand, Oh walk in this Gallery among these Pictures; and for your security, rest not without assu∣rance of Gods Love, which will make you wary; Who would endanger it; much less forfeit it; The empty Purse fears not the Thief, but the full, looks to every Danger, every Tempta∣tion:
<PB N="64" REF="001923_0068_0FBA2DAF6521FB40"/>
And really nothing is a greater safe-guard, than the freeness of this Love communicated to the Soul; stay you no where on this side of it, it will keep you steady in a trembling world. Thus may you walk, and from this blessed Principle, dear Child.</P>
<P N="28">28. And that all this may be carri∣ed on, and is properly the life of Faith; remember, That the hardest thing in the world is, <HI>To believe in Jesus Christ to these and all other good ends:</HI> Faith is a short word and easily spoken; but Oh how hard is it in the Nature of it! when if ever the Lord works it in us, he finds nothing, not a spark of it, till he comes; nay he finds us opposite to the work of it; nay, he finds us unwilling to be made wil∣ling to close with the offer of Christ, though made so freely; Hypocrisie and all evil hath its fountain here, we believe not: all the other graces sink when this fails; all must have its cure: we bind the lame arm: we a∣noint it, we warm it, and yet no∣thing helps, because it is out of joynt. Oh we believe not! Anger rageth,
<PB N="65" REF="001923_0069_0FBA2DB0D2FB5C18"/>
Lust provokes, Covetousness cozens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all is, <HI>We believe not:</HI> Nature can∣not reach this, Art cannot compass it: to look near 1700 years back upon the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> (who was the Son of God) lived not forty years, preach∣ed but three years and half, reproached home to his grave: and to believe in him for a Saviour: I say, this must be the work of another world, and the outstretched Arm of God. See <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.18, 19, 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To believe that another will pay all my debts, and become poor to make me rich, to die to make me live: Oh Miracle of Mercy!</P>
<P>My Child, to believe things in∣credible, to hope things delayed, and to love God when he seems angry, are <HI>Luthers</HI> wonders, and mine, and thine. It is unbelief is that <HI>death in the pot,</HI> that lifts up sense, that brings an ill report of God, that over hastens our mercies, and sets God a time for our deliverances. <HI>Faith is the gift of God,</HI> and the greatest, which over∣comes difficulties, sets Mercy to work against Justice, fetcheth the work done either by, without, or against Means,

throws Mountains into the Sea. A little little grain like Mustard-seed will do wonders; enliven a dead heart, save even a damned soul; for such we are: This will not be had with∣out the Word and Spirit, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.17. and the glory of it. See <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. for this, hear, beg, pray, weep, fast, seek, labour, strive, use violence, read, ask, wish, sigh; and if you do believe, <HI>the Lord help your Unbelief,</HI> dear Child.</P>
<P N="29">29. In the next, (which looks like the last) indeed, I must give you my thoughts about Death: which certain∣ly must be your portion (though Young) and I must tell you, it is a great word to say, <HI>I dare Die:</HI> many Books and Funeral Sermons you may read about it. I say, Life is sweet, and Death ter∣rible: many in several distempers may call for it, neither minding what it is, nor whether it leads: <HI>Job</HI> describes it in his Agony: and Heathens could say, The first good was, <HI>not to be born,</HI> and the next, <HI>to die quickly: Paul</HI> (a∣bove any) desires it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon right grounds: Yea, the last words in the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ticles,</HI> and the last in the Bible are,
<PB N="67" REF="001923_0071_0FBA2DB52753F670"/>
for the Lord Jesus to <HI>come quickly:</HI> yea, to <HI>come to Judgment:</HI> as if it were the breathings of the Spirits of the Just in the last times: of which Spirit if you be, these will be your Reasons, as theirs.</P>
<P>First, That you may see Him of whom you have heard so much, who hath done and suffered so much for you. Secondly, That you may have full draughts of what you now taste only: Thirdly, That your Beloved may come to you, or you to Him: for whose sake, and love, you may undergo here many frowns, brow-beatings, if not worse: thus the absent Spouse waits for her Beloved. Fourthly, When the Sanctuary is troden upon, <HI>Isai.</HI> 64.1. Fifthly, That the double Vail of Cor∣ruption and Affliction may be taken off from you: Thus to wish for Death is to wish for Life.</P>
<P>These things I pray study: and to help you further, remember <HI>Balaam</HI> would fain die the Death of the Righ∣teous, which you can never do, unless you live the Life of the Godly: to which I have written so much before: Only let me add, That you must live
<PB N="68" REF="001923_0072_0FBA2DB7AC68BE70"/>
in daily Expectation of this great Change; for though there be but one way into the World, there are many out. I know nothing to sweeten it but the Death of Christ, who suckt out the poyson of it, and saves to the utter∣most. <HI>Romans</HI> and Fools can die brave∣ly, write their own Elegies. I am sure a well-led Life is the best Monument. If one at your door should cry every Morning, <HI>You must Die,</HI> it would not reach far: but Christ died for you, My Child.</P>
<P N="30">30. They say, and truly, <HI>Where Death leaves you, there Judgment finds you:</HI> Nothing flies so swiftly than as the Soul out of the body: and you know Eternity hangs upon a Moment: and such is our Life: and especially such is the last groan and pang; and thither it leads. It is a vast Ocean, hath neither bound nor bottom: where you are to come before an Impartial Judge, with a naked and open breast: it is unavoidable, and the miscarriage there intollerable. Many Books are written by many about these last things, and <HI>Apothegmes</HI> not a few:
<PB N="69" REF="001923_0073_0FBA2DBE1B1307C0"/>
the World and the Flesh will not ap∣pear for you: the former can lend you but a few Ceremonies and Comple∣ments: the other dare go no further than the Judges door: but a good Con∣science, sprinkled by the Bood of Christ, will enter with boldness, and plead, and hear the voice of, <HI>Come ye blessed.</HI> Your wisdom will be, to carry your Pardon in your bosome: there Wit, and Learning, Parts, and Wealth will get no hearing: there the Eloquent Orator is dumb: no Coin is currant, but the Blood of a loving Saviour; No man can appear there by any other Proxy: there Greatness must give way to Goodness; there Hypocrisie is un∣masked, Truth naked; there your fel∣low Saints shall sit Judges, though des∣pised amongst men; there the Son of Man shall appear, because despised as the Son of Man; there Preaching, Mi∣racles, Casting out Devils will not pro∣fit, but a Name written in the Book of the Lamb. Oh that you would consi∣der betimes what a nothing a thousand Years are to Eternity, yea, where you shall be an hundred Years hence: if the Grave make no distance betwixt
<PB N="70" REF="001923_0074_0FBA2DBF17755730"/>
the Scepter and the Mattock; what will Eternity do when that shall make no difference? Wherefore I pray measure all your works by Eternity, eat, drink, sleep, work by Eternity; the cry of a damned Soul is, I never minded Eter∣nity: how many are every day carry∣ing Faggots to burn them to Eternity? Call that good that holds for ever: Let but the Judge be your Husband, and fear nothing. The ever-living God love you, and keep you to all Eternity, My Child.</P>
<P N="31">31. And because I have brought you so far as the Great Day, give me leave to awaken you with the condi∣tion of the Place, Heaven, and to let you know it in the particulars, which are the presence of all good, and the ab∣sence of all evil; the former commends it self unto you in these:</P>
<P>First, in the universality of it: whereas all things here below are but partial; so in the suitableness of it, they are there spiritual, and suitable to the Spirit.</P>
<P>Secondly, for their Continuance: the good things are not like Cherries
<PB N="71" REF="001923_0075_0FBA2DC0A879C930"/>
drawn by the lips, or Comforts tasted, and gone; but they stay and are good for ever.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Evil knows no Place, there Sin cannot dwell with that Holiness, Sorrow cannot mingle it self with that Joy: no more fading Riches, dying Friends, changing Honours, perishing Beauty; no more aking heads, nor languishing diseases; no more hearing the chain of the Prisoner, nor anger of the Oppressor; no cry of <HI>what do you lack?</HI> every Bottle is full, and every Bed easie, being of never-blasting Roses and Sweets: where every Room is paved with Love: where Wisdom, Power, Mercy, and Grace have combined, to make all glorious and pleasant. Then never be troubled about a dunghil-world: when the Apostle to the <HI>Thes∣salonians,</HI> sayes all in a few words, <HI>We shall be with the Lord for ever;</HI> and that includes all, answers all hard Questions, all hard Labours under the Sun. Remember the Swaggerer that met the poor Man ever mourning over his Sins, (quoth he) What, still mourning? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But what if there be no Heaven? Ah Sir, quoth the other,
<PB N="72" REF="001923_0076_0FBA2DC90BE1D6F0"/>
what if there be a Hell? The Doctrine of Hell was never enough Preach'd (some thinks) and there, on the con∣trary, is the presence of all evil, and the absence of all good; you may study it by the former, where the Tor∣mented never die, and the Tormentor is never weary; where thought and fear, despair, punishment, extremity meet altogether in Eternity. The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you to His Heavenly Kingdom, My poor Child.</P>

Town, of a very ancient Family, the Name <HI>Treffey</HI> of <HI>Place,</HI> or the Place in that Town, of which I would not boast.</P>
<P>These lived in very great abundance, their Losses at Sea grew very great; in the midst of which Losses, my elder Brother being at <HI>Oxford,</HI> I was sent to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and that Estate I had by an Uncle, I left with my Mother, and li∣ved at the University; and a little from thence, about eight Years, took my Degree of Master of <HI>Arts,</HI> where I spent some Years vainly enough, being but Fourteen Years Old when thither I came, my Tutor died, and I was expos'd to my shifts.</P>
<P>Coming from thence, at <HI>London</HI> God struck me with the sense of my sinful estate, by a Sermon I heard under <HI>Pauls,</HI> which was about Forty Years since; which Text was, <HI>The burden of Dun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah,</HI> or <HI>Idumea,</HI> and stuck fast. This made me to go into <HI>Essex:</HI> And after being quieted by another Sermon in that Country, and the Love and Labours of Mr. <HI>Thomas Hocker:</HI> I there Preacht, there Married with a good Gentlewo∣man, till I went to <HI>London</HI> to ripen my Studies, not intending to Preach at all;

where I attended Dr. <HI>Gouge, Sibs,</HI> and <HI>Davenports</HI> Ministry, with others; and I hope, with some profit. But in short time was forced to Preach by importu∣nity of Friends, having had a Licence from Dr. <HI>Mountain</HI> Bishop of <HI>London</HI> be∣fore, and to <HI>Sepulchres</HI> I was brought by a very strange Providence; for Preach∣ing before at another Place; and a Young Man receiving some good, would not be satisfied, but I must Preach at <HI>Sepulchres</HI> once Monthly for the good of his Friends; in which he got his end (if I might not shew vanity) and he allowed Thirty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> to that Lecture, but his Person unknown to me: he was a Chandler, and died a good Man, and Member of Parliament.

where I was five or six Years, not without the Presence of God in my Work; but many of my Acquaintance going for <HI>New-England,</HI> had engaged me to come to them when they sent, which accordingly I did: And truly, my reason for my self and others to go, was meerly not to offend Authority in that difference of Judgment; and had not the Book for Encouragement of Sports on the Sabbath come forth, ma∣ny had staid. That good Man, my dear firm Friend, Mr. <HI>White</HI> of <HI>Dor∣chester,</HI> and Bishop <HI>Lake,</HI> occasioned, yea founded, that Work, and much in reference to the <HI>Indians,</HI> of which we did not fail to attempt, with good Suc∣cess to many of their Souls (through Gods Blessing.)

coming hither, found the Nation em∣broiled in those Civil Discontents, Jars and Wars, and here was forced to stay, though I had nothing to support me but the Parliaments Promises; And not being able in a short time to com∣pass my Errand, studied with a con∣stant purpose of Returning, and went with the first to <HI>Ireland,</HI> most of your <HI>London,</HI> Godly Ministers being engaged in Person, Purse, and Preaching in this Trouble: I thought <HI>Ireland</HI> the clearest Work, and had the Pay of a Preacher then and after-ward, as I could get it.

Upon my Return, was staid again from going home, by the Earl of <HI>War∣wick</HI> my Patron; then by the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> afterwards by the Parliament, who at last gave me an Estate, now taken away. I had access to the King about my <HI>New-England</HI> business: he used me Civilly; I, in requital, offered my poor thoughts three times for his safety; I never had hand in contriving or acting his Death, as I am scandali∣zed, but the contrary (to my mean power:) I was never in any Councils

or Cabal at any time, I hated it, and had no stowage for Counsel, thinking all Government should lie open to all; nor had Penny from any General, but lived in debt, as now I am; nor had means for my Expences, what I had, others shared in. I canfess I did what I did strenuously, though with a weak Head, being over-laid with my own and others Troubles; never was angry with any of the Kings party, not a∣ny of them for being so; thought the Parliament Authority lawful, and ne∣ver studied it much; have not had my hand in any Man's Blood, but saved many in Life and Estate.

that would keep things together; till the breach of that they call <HI>Richards Parliament,</HI> and then I removed, and never returned more, but fell sick long, and in trouble ever since; never was summoned but once by the Council, which was in <HI>April,</HI> about Books; of which (lying sick) I craved of the Pre∣sident of the Council to excuse me, who sent unto me he had, and I gave him an account of the Books: But hearing that my Estate was gone, and I indebted, was private, and did purpose so to live, and so to die, having a Resolution (which I kept) never to meddle with State-matters, but either here or in <HI>New-England,</HI> to spend my old Age, in look∣ing into my Grave and Eternity; and never had to do with any Transactions with Soldiers or others; nor never would, had I a longer Life, my Head and Heart be tired, as well as my Body crazed: I thought the <HI>Act of Indemnity</HI> would have included me, but the hard Cha∣racter upon me excluded me, which I was so sensible of, that Nature (in its own preservation) carried me to priva∣cy; but free from that report of the man∣ner which is suggested, of which you
<PB N="81" REF="001923_0085_0FBA2DE0A2873BC0"/>
may be assured: By my Zeal (it seems) I have exposed my self to all manner of reproach: but wish you to know, that (besides your Mother) I have had no fellowship (that way) with any Wo∣man since first I knew her, having a god∣ly Wife before also, I bless God.</P>
<P>But because what is before written, may seem my white side only, I shall deal in all plainness with you, That though for Religion I am and have been really sound and Orthodox to my best apprehension, according to the blessed Word of God, and the generality of the Protestant Confessions; yea, though I travelled through Protestant Churches for Order, to espy the best, &amp; have joyned with the Churches of Christ, and took in with that I call a <HI>Tender Presbytery,</HI> for such was ours in <HI>New-England,</HI> and yet so, as I never Unchurcht any Parish where a godly Minister was, and godly People joyned together, though not all so; and do know God may have a Peo∣ple under all Forms, and would with∣draw to the furthest Judges, rather than give offence to what I cannot close with: yet so unworthy have my thoughts been of my self to be a meet Preacher of the
<PB N="82" REF="001923_0086_0FBA2DE189617D40"/>
Gospel, that more than twice I had gi∣ven it over, had not Friends prevailed; yea, my profession of the Gospel hath been with much folly, weakness, and vanity: I crave pardon of any that have taken offence, though in a Christian way I have not had the reproofs of Three ei∣ther for Preaching or Conversation. I am heartily sorry I was Popular, and known better to others than my self; It hath much lain to my heart above any thing almost, That I left that Peo∣ple I was engaged to in <HI>New-England,</HI> it cuts deeply, I look upon it as a Root-evil: and though I was never Parson nor Vicar, never took Ecclesiastical pro∣motion, never Preached upon any a∣greement for Money in my life, though not without offers, and great ones; yet I had a Flock, I say, I had a Flock, to whom I was Ordained, who were wor∣thy of my Life and Labours; but I could never think my self fit to be their Pastor, so unaccomplisht for such a work, for which, <HI>Who is sufficient</HI> (cryes the A∣postle?) This is my sore trouble; and a private life would have become me best, and my poor gift have had its vent also: But here I was overpowered to
<PB N="83" REF="001923_0087_0FBA2DE3093FFB20"/>
stay. For Errors in Judgment I have pitied, never closed with any that I know; when I was a Tryer of others, I went to hear and gain Experience rather than to judge; When I was called about mending Laws, I rather was there to Pray, than mend Laws; When to judge in Wills, I only went sometimes to learn, and help the Poor, than to judge: but in all these I confess I might well have been spared.</P>
<P>Nor do I take pleasure in remembring any my least activity in State-matters, though this I can say, I no where mind∣ed who Ruled fewer or more, so the good ends of Government be given out, in which Men may live in <HI>Godliness and Honesty.</HI> I have often said, That is a good Government, <HI>where Men may be as good as they can, not so bad as they would;</HI> where good Men and Things are upper∣most; and have thought if good Ma∣gistrates cannot bring all to their Judg∣ments, the Dissenters may have liberty, being kept out of Office, and want some other Publick Characters. That which a Friend of mine, and my self writ by Letters about Magistrates, was very lit∣tle, and the Records of the Tower were
<PB N="84" REF="001923_0088_0FBA2DE964894D50"/>
only named, as giving way to all other Records, to cut off dissentions, or marks of Tyranny, which no good Prince will exercise; I am sorry if any offended, it was Zeal for Quietness. I honour Laws, and good Lawyers heartily, and know their use; only ease, expedition, and cheapness, what good Man doth not call for? Sedition is the heating Mens minds against the present Autho∣rity, in that I never was, yet sorry, Au∣thority should have any hard thoughts of me, or know so inconsiderable a creature as my self: I never could be fit for a Court, many ways not fit, and am therefore grieved, that I was either con∣strained, or content to live, where I could do so little good; for I would die without a secret in my bosome, unless Cases of Conscience in the way of Prea∣ching, which are secret indeed; and for reading them to the World I had ap∣pointed a Portion, if it had been conti∣nued to me.</P>
<P>Upon all this you may ask what de∣sign I drove, being looked upon that way? Truly these three.</P>
<P>First, That Goodness that which is really so, and such Religion, might be highly advanced.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="001923_0089_0FBA2DEA8AF121D8"/>Secondly, That good Learning might have all Countenance.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That there may not be a Beg∣gar in <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And for all these I have projected or laboured, and I have no other. And these I pray his present Majesty may look to, and that God would bless him every way.</P>
<P>If in the prosecution of these I have used any of my wonted rudeness, or un∣guided zeal, I am heartily as sorry. So begging pardon from God and Man, Constitution or Custom, I conclude in these particulars, though the aim be good.</P>
<P>I conclude the former thus; I think, That as bad men care not who rule, or what is uppermost, so they may have their Lusts; so good Men, if they may enjoy God and His Truth, with good Conscience. For my whole course you know and feel where my wound hath been these Twenty Years, which hath occasioned not only my Head and Heart breaking, but travelling from mine own Nest into business.</P>
<P>Bless God, if ever you meet with sui∣tableness in Marriage. For my Spirit it

wanted weight, through many tossings, my head that composure others have, credulous, and too careless, but never mischievous nor malicious: I thought my work was to serve others, and so mine own Garden not so well cultiva∣ted; only this I say, I aimed at a good mark, and trust the Lord in Jesus Christ hath accepted it. My Faith in the E∣verlasting Covenant was and is, though feeble, yet Faith. I could thus conti∣nue, ripping my whole heart to you, who have very often had great success, even to the last hour of my last Preaching, and am Preaching the life of Faith to my self, to which call in all Prayers to the Father in Jesus Christ his dearest Son, to whom let us look, as <HI>the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despi∣sed the Shame, and now sits at the right hand of Majesty, making Intercession for Transgressors,</HI> Heb 12.12. <HI>To whom be Glory and Praise, and Thanks for ever. For he is worthy, who hath washed us from our sins by his own Blood, and made us Kings and Priests unto God the Father; To him be Glory and Dominion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>For that part of my Lord <HI>Cravens</HI> Estate

which I have, took no small place in my trouble. You may know that I was not in the City when that Act was made, nor urged my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> to buy; nor ever advised the said Lord (as I had time) but to good and just things and company, against that Spirit of <HI>Levelling</HI> then stirring: and do heartily wish, that taken offence might die; for it was not intended by me, who could and can be as well contented without Land, as with it; never being ambitious to be great or rich since I knew better things.</P>
<P N="34">34. And now I must return to your self again, and to give you my thoughts about your own Condition, I do first com∣mend you to the Lord, and then to the care of a Faithful Friend, whom I shall name unto you, if a Friend may be found in this Juncture, that dare own your Name (though there be more of your Name) and if such a Friend ad∣vise it, that you serve in some Godly Family, to which you seem to incline, and must (it seems;) but truly if not a good Family, what will your Condition be? Dwell where God dwells, and be in such Company, as you must be with
<PB N="88" REF="001923_0092_0FBA2DF538952738"/>
in Heaven, and then you do but change your place, not your company; though it be unexpected and uncouth, yet re∣member the best of men have been ser∣vants; <HI>Moses</HI> kept his Fathers sheep; so <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the Patriarchs; <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Saul,</HI> and many more; I have before given thee Rules for it: And be sure to be steady to Family and Private-Duties, your Life will be dead without them; call your Condition Gods Ordinance, and he can bless it to you. But if you would go home to <HI>New-England</HI> (which you have much reason to do) go with good Company, and trust God there: The Church are a tender Company; a little will carry us through the World, yea very little: O Godliness with Content! Your Faithfulness to me and your Mo∣ther will find Acceptance in Heaven, I trust. My dear Child, tell me, How couldst thou be without Gods Rod? Remember he hath a Staff also. For your Mother (considering her Distem∣per) I have and shall say more unto you. To his Grace, who is able to do above all we can ask or think, I com∣mend you both.</P>
<P>And if I go shortly where Time shall

be no more, where Cock nor Clock dis∣tinguish Hours; sink not, but lay thy head in his Bosome who can keep thee: for He sits upon the Waves. Farewel.</P>
<P N="35">35. And since we must part, must part: take my Wishes, Sighs &amp; Groans to follow thee, and pity the feebleness of what I have sent, being writ under much, yea very much discomposure of Spirit.</P>

<L>And the Rich Pearl,</L>
<L>for which the Merchants toyl,</L>

<L>No painted Pomp,</L>

<L>I wish you such a Heart</L>

<L>Minding the Main,</L>
<L>open'd as <HI>Lydia's</HI> was:</L>
<L>A Hand like <HI>Dorcas,</HI></L>
