<P>A CURE <HI>FOR CANTING; AN ORIGINAL</HI> YANKEE POEM. <HI>IN TWO LETTERS.</HI></P>
<P>ARGUMENT. A candidate for the Ministry of the Gospel is highly censured by a Physician, for some little familiarities taken with a young mai∣den, whom he accidentally met with in his rambles into the fields, in the season for Strawberries—The Reverend Divine makes a spirited reply, and seems to justify him∣self.</P>

<L>THE man of holy order trembles.</L>
<L>For plucking fruit behind the brambles.</L>
<L>The <HI>fruit</HI> was fair, it charm'd the sense,</L>
<L>Dress'd in the bloom of innocence;</L>
<L>Nor did he deem the touch a sin,</L>
<L>When acting o'er the harmless scene;</L>
<L>While all the mead, in frolic sporting,</L>
<L>Danc'd to the tune of harmless courting.</L>
<L><HI>Strawberries</HI> chepuer'd o'er the soil,</L>
<L>Without the tint of artful guile:</L>
<L>The Priest was charm'd amid the show</L>
<L>Of fruit so fair, I know not how,</L>
<L>Nor should I tell, so I divine,</L>
<L>'Twould never make your feelings mine:</L>
<L>While some fair she your partner stood,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="037273_0004_100CA4C15C3D2FE0"/>
In natal charms, as nature should;</L>
<L>Yet careless she, without design,</L>
<L>Grew careful as a thing divine.</L>
<L>Without the aid of divination,</L>
<L>I must suspect your inclination,</L>
<L>From ancient stories something sim'lar,</L>
<L>Though in themselves near auricular.</L>
<L>For good king David, once at leisure,</L>
<L>Thought less of duty than of pleasure,</L>
<L>When Bathsheba was in the water,</L>
<L>(Poor thing, she thought of no such matter,)</L>
<L>His wanton eye beheld such beauty,</L>
<L>He leap'd the fence of sacred duty;</L>
<L>Nor poke, nor shackles could restrain</L>
<L>The giddy passions of the man,</L>
<L>Who in the absence of Uriah,</L>
<L>Grew waggish with new born desire;</L>
<L>Threw off his sacerdotal dress,</L>
<L>To grab a loyal subject's bliss;</L>
<L>And with an impious touch profane</L>
<L>The treasures of another man;</L>
<L>The cabinet to unlock and rifle,</L>
<L>And with this sacred thing to trifle;</L>
<L>Did what he would, without control,</L>
<L>And took possession of the whole.</L>
<L>Now, Sir, if fame and truth agree,</L>
<L>For such there is but one decree,</L>
<L>Which that good man had drawn in picture,</L>
<L>And painted with what some call scripture.</L>
<L>But I forbear, fame will tell lies,</L>
<L>And truth may fall a sacrifice.</L>
<L>Has Nathan paid a visit civil,</L>
<L>To warn you of a moral evil?</L>
<L>Or ever told in language plain,</L>
<L><HI>"Behold thou art the very man?"</HI></L>
<L>Has not some Delilah or other,</L>
<L>(The lovely creature of another)</L>
<L>By you been sought? O! here I rest,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="037273_0005_100CA4C2E3E3C268"/>
And wish to leave you ever blest.</L>
<L>But Nathan knows, by revelation,</L>
<L>The secrets of imagination:</L>
<L>For if you only pluck away</L>
<L>A lamb, that in some bosom lay</L>
<L>With secrecy, and ne'er so still,</L>
<L>The harmless fraud he will reveal.</L>
<L>But kings and prophets are no more,</L>
<L>Nor can they breed on this our shore;</L>
<L>Where fair Delilah and lambs may sport,</L>
<L>And priests and people live unhurt.</L>
<L>Uriah and all the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gone,</L>
<L>With all the types that ever shone;</L>
<L>And nothing now but fair day light,</L>
<L>And naked truth obstructs the sight.</L>

<HEAD>LETTER II. D—W to C—H.</HEAD>
<L>THINK you a sable vesture can</L>
<L>Suppress each passion of the man?</L>
<L>Drive Nature's feelings from their post,</L>
<L>And fill his youthful veins with frost?</L>
<L>Or, does fair Virtue ev'r require</L>
<L>T' extinguish all the am'rous fire?</L>
<L>Must he alone who preaches truth,</L>
<L>Be old and grey in midst of youth:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="037273_0006_100CA4C5B16E6F28"/>
Nor treat a lass in social manner,</L>
<L>When he, by chance, comes pat upon her?</L>
<L>Nay, that I think is plaguy hard,</L>
<L>Impracticable and absurd.</L>
<L>And who forbids the harmless joy,</L>
<L>Are <HI>Deka-daimonasteroi:</HI></L>
<L>For surely with the gospel mission</L>
<L>There's made for apostles full provision:</L>
<L>Have we not ample power to eat,</L>
<L>Just as we please, all kinds of <HI>meat?</HI></L>
<L>To drink likewise, read news, and smoke,</L>
<L>And live as well as other folk?</L>
<L>Who'd go to war without some pelf?</L>
<L>What soldier fights and pays himself?</L>
<L>What man plants apples, peaches, pears,</L>
<L>And eats no <HI>fruit</HI> his <HI>orchard</HI> beaas?</L>
<L>Who makes a <HI>flock</HI> or <HI>herd</HI> his care,</L>
<L>And has no <HI>milk,</HI> nor <HI>clothes</HI> to wear?</L>
<L>Then is it not the highest reason,</L>
<L>That we who in, and out of season,</L>
<L>Sow spiritual things (for that's our trade)</L>
<L>Should be in CARNAL things repaid?</L>
<L>Tho' other <HI>cattle</HI> may be tether'd,</L>
<L>Muzzled, hamstring'd, pok'd and fetter'd:</L>
<L>Yet both the law and gospel warn,</L>
<L><HI>To muzzle none that tread the corn.</HI></L>
<L>Then blame not me for picking <HI>berries,</HI></L>
<L>Or picking <HI>peaches, plumbs,</HI> or <HI>cherries;</HI></L>
<L>Or any <HI>fruit</HI> of sweeter flavour,</L>
<L>Amid the <HI>vineyard</HI> where I labour:</L>
<L>For this is not a thing so awful.</L>
<L>But customary right and lawful</L>
<L>The ancient story you relate,</L>
<L>Of brave Uriah's wretched fate—</L>
<L>Of good king David, and his mistress,</L>
<L>Are hardly parallel with this case:</L>
<L>For David being a potent king,</L>
<L>Was not confin'd to one poor thing,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="037273_0007_100CA4C7BA977B30"/>
Taken for better or for worse,</L>
<L>Perhaps of life the plague and curse.</L>
<L>He had throughout a fruitful land—</L>
<L>Women enough at his command;</L>
<L>And to relieve an am'rous mood,</L>
<L>Might find a <HI>Venus</HI> where he would.</L>
<L>But as for me, I've neither wreath</L>
<L>Nor sword to conquer ladies with:</L>
<L>And tho' in solitude I pine,</L>
<L>I've neither queen nor concubine.</L>
<L>Beside, the lass mid flowers fine,</L>
<L>I found, as Pluto, Proserpine,</L>
<L>Was neither matron nor a wife,</L>
<L>But bloom'd in single rural life.</L>
<L>What tho' for her some swain did sigh,</L>
<L>Struck by the light'ning of her eye;</L>
<L>'Tis nothing strange, such eyes can dart</L>
<L>A flame into the coldest heart;</L>
<L>And each swains heart goes pat a pittey,</L>
<L>On seeing damsels all so pretty.</L>
<L>On this we need to go no farther,</L>
<L>T' exclude adultery and murder.</L>
<L>But still the case I'm free to put,</L>
<L>As may your sneakish fancy suit;</L>
<L>And say through <HI>Shelburne's</HI> flow'ry fields,</L>
<L>Where earth her virgin sweetness yields,</L>
<L>I on a fair and leisure day</L>
<L>For exercise and pleasure stray;</L>
<L>Where blooming clover, white and red,</L>
<L>Their mingled sweet effluvia shed;</L>
<L>And all the sweets of June appear,</L>
<L>Their charms display'd the sense to cheer;</L>
<L>Say, in a vale where Strawb'ries grow,</L>
<L>I met a nymph—no matter who—</L>
<L>In neat simplicity of dress,</L>
<L>Such as becomes a shepherdess,</L>
<L>Made light and thin for Summer's day,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="037273_0008_100CA4C94A612678"/>
To catch the zephyrs as they play,</L>
<L>Her neck as fair as lilly show'd,</L>
<L>And round her, jetty tresses flow'd,</L>
<L>Love sparkled in her sable eye,</L>
<L>Her cheeks with rosy damask vie,</L>
<L>Her lips like strawb'ries sweet appear'd,</L>
<L>With which her fingers were besmear'd,</L>
<L>Proportion through her stature ran,</L>
<L>Complete enough to charm the man—</L>
<L>With youthful modesty and grace,</L>
<L>And virgin blushes in her face,</L>
<L>A little basket neat and trim,</L>
<L>She bore, replenish'd to the brim,</L>
<L>Of choicest berries, blushing, and</L>
<L>All gather'd by her own fair hand.</L>
<L>Instead of counterfeiting fright,</L>
<L>Or striving to get out of sight,</L>
<L>Or squalling like some silly prude,</L>
<L>That mortal foe to flesh and blood—</L>
<L><HI>"You need, dear Sir, no farther go,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"I've got enough for me and you."</HI></L>
<L>This with a virgin blush she said,</L>
<L>And gave me <HI>tythes</HI> of all she had.</L>
<L>By all the charms of Venus, say,</L>
<L>Would you in this case run away?</L>
<L>Or, can it be, I did amiss,</L>
<L>To greet this sister with a kiss?</L>
<L>But superstition, grim and awful,</L>
<L>Declares point blank 'twas all unlawful;</L>
<L>Allows a priest no flesh and blood,</L>
<L>But a mere ghostly brotherhood:</L>
<L>For recreation gives no time,</L>
<L>And takes a smile to be a crime.</L>
<L>The preacher's lot, alas, how hard,</L>
<L>From every human joy debar'd!</L>
<L>Oblig'd, by longitude of face,</L>
<L>T' evince the extent of faith and grace!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="037273_0009_100CA4CADD733EE0"/>
Assume a solemn ghostly tone,</L>
<L>Cry reason and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passions down!</L>
<L>Look very sad, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much reserve,</L>
<L>And be content <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> freeze or starve!</L>

<L>Be very careful ne'er to use it;</L>
<L>Do many things entirely vain,</L>
<L>Merely to be seen by men:</L>
<L>Obey th' unthinking multitude,</L>
<L>Or else incur their censures rude:</L>
<L>Depend upon the vulgar throng,</L>
<L>His judges, as to right and wrong;</L>
<L>And as he suits the rabble rout,</L>
<L>Will keep his place, or be turn'd out.</L>
<L>The boy in school, suspected rogue,</L>
<L>That feels the lash of pedagogue,</L>
<L>With this consoles each sad disaster—</L>
<L>He has but one capricious master,</L>
<L>But the poor priest must lashing take,</L>
<L>From every villain, fool, and rake,</L>
<L>Still patient their caprices see;</L>
<L>A pupil to his pupils be,</L>
<L>And seel the censure and control</L>
<L>Of ev'ry blockhead in his school:</L>
<L>In chains of cruel custom bound,</L>
<L>Must walk formality's dull round:</L>
<L>And if too fast or slow he trudge,</L>
<L>In ev'ry neighbour meets his judge</L>
<L>And executioner, combin'd,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>benefit of Clergy</HI> find:</L>
<L>Invisible things must keep his eyes on,</L>
<L>And wine and women shun as poison;</L>
<L>Have nought to gratify his sense,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="037273_0010_100CA4CE2CAFCDD8"/>
Except his pipe and indolence:</L>
<L>And if he hankers for a wife,</L>
<L>To smooth th' asperities of life,</L>
<L>No lovely lass, that suits his taste,</L>
<L>May ever be by him embrac'd:</L>
<L>In such a case he has no choice,</L>
<L>But must obey his neighbour's voice;</L>
<L>Who still upon him will be urging</L>
<L>Some tarnish'd widow, or stale virgin;</L>
<L>And he, to get the matter over,</L>
<L>Has nought to do but wed and love her:</L>
<L>Hence 'tis the Clergy oft embrace</L>
<L>The refuse of the female race;</L>
<L>Find nuptial couch a bed of ice,</L>
<L>Where ardour cools, and fancy dies:</L>
<L>One takes a sickly, pallid creature,</L>
<L>With death portray'd in ev'ry feature:</L>
<L>Another weds, for his vexation,</L>
<L>A mass of pride and affectation:</L>
<L>By fate, a third is doom'd to clench</L>
<L>A whining, dirty, peevish wench;</L>
<L>Another weds, from Juno's rage,</L>
<L>A virgin, past the flower of age,</L>
<L>Of low'ring front, and visage wan,</L>
<L>And face all bearded like a man,</L>
<L>Protub'rant bones, thick skin, and knees</L>
<L>All rough as shagbark walnut trees:</L>
<L>A breathing, frightful piece of carrion,</L>
<L>And still as Lybia's desart barren.—</L>
<L>These are the sweet and chosen dames</L>
<L>Assign'd to quench the Clergy's flames;</L>
<L>These are the joys to smooth the brows,</L>
<L>The <HI>lib'ral multitude</HI> allows.</L>
<L>O happy men to physic bred,</L>
<L>Who're not by such caprices led!</L>
<L>Who neither faith nor morals need;</L>
<L>And if they can but write and read,</L>

May the profoundest ignorance wrap in</L>
<L>Hard crabbed sounds of Greek and Latin.</L>
<L>To them mankind much credit give,</L>
<L>Merely for letting patients live:</L>
<L>If some they kill, 'tis not their crime,</L>
<L><HI>Poor men! 'twas their appointed time.</HI></L>
<L>They, living in luxurious ease,</L>
<L>May say and do just what they please;</L>
<L>Whom custom, from the days of yore,</L>
<L>Allows to laugh, and drink, and whore.</L>
<L>On one of this licencious train,</L>
<L>Censorious breath is spent in vain.</L>
<L>Deism, toping, fornication,</L>
<L>In them is but our expectation;</L>
<L>And who to these becomes a slave,</L>
<L>Does but as doctors always have:</L>
<L>And though some people disapprove it,</L>
<L>There's little notice taken of it.</L>
<L>But if a Priest does deviate</L>
<L>One inch from path to heaven's gate,</L>
<L>He's gaz'd at like a blazing star,</L>
<L>Because the thing's so very rare;</L>
<L>And in a trice his fame is hurl'd</L>
<L>To ruin by a gabbling world.</L>
<L>Not so the man of medic skill,</L>
<L>Allow'd to ramble where he will:</L>
<L>In him to talk profane and loose,</L>
<L>Is reckon'd witty and jocose;</L>
<L>And if he courts Sir RICHARD'S aid,</L>

<L>To keep his life and soul together,</L>
<L>Expos'd to all extreames of weather;</L>
<L>Sustain his heart, and cheer his head,</L>

May feel and fumble where he pleases;</L>
<L>And topics where requir'd apply,</L>
<L>Each exigence to satisfy.</L>
<L>What's more, the doctor still is paid</L>
<L>For his intrigues with wife or maid;</L>
<L>And if he's caught in her embrace.</L>
<L>He's but examining her case,</L>
<L>As every faithful doctor should,</L>
<L>To make his application good;</L>
<L>'Tis thus, the silly husband buys</L>
<L>His horns at a prodigious price.</L>
<L>But why do I thus interfere</L>
