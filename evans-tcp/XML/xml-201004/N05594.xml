<HEAD><HI>Popish Cruelty displayed:</HI> Being a full and true Account of the bloody Massacre of the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the Instigation of the blood-thirsty <HI>Jesuits, Priests, Fryars,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN their Plots were ripe for Execu∣tion, we find their first Proceeding a∣gainst the <HI>English</HI> various; some of the <HI>Irish</HI> only stripping and expelling them, others murthering Men, Women and Children without Mercy; all resolving universally to root out all the Protestants out of <HI>Ireland;</HI> so deeply malicious were they against the <HI>English</HI> Protestants, that they would not so much as endure the sound of their Language.</P>
<P>The Priests gave the Sacrament unto divers of the <HI>Irish</HI> upon condition they should neither spare Man, Woman nor Child of the Protestants. One <HI>Hilligan</HI> a Priest, read an Excommunication against all those, that from henceforth should relieve or harbour any <HI>English, Scotch</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Man, or give them Alms, whereby many were famished to death. The Friars exhorted them with Tears, not to spare any of the <HI>English;</HI> they boasted, that when they
<PB N="6" REF="007100_0005_102AF4B267E94900"/>
had destroyed them in <HI>Ireland,</HI> they would go over into <HI>England,</HI> and not leave the Memorial of an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Man under Heaven.</P>
<P>They openly professed, that they held it as lawful to kill a Protestant as to kill a Dog. One of their Priests said, <HI>That it was no more pity to take their Lives from them, than it is to take a Bone out of a Dogs Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>The Day before this Massacre began, the Priests gave the People a Dismiss at Mass, with liberty to go out, and to take Possession of all their Lands, as also to strip, rob and despoil them and their Goods and Cattle; the Protestants being, as they told them worse than Dogs, for they were Devils, and there∣fore the Killing of such was a <HI>Meritorious Act,</HI> and <HI>a rare Preservative against the Pains of Purgatory;</HI> and this caused some of the Murtherers to boast, after they had slain many of the <HI>English, that they knew, that if they should die presently, they should go straight to Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Irish,</HI> when the Massacre began, persuaded many of their Protestant Neighbours to bring their Goods to them, and they would secure them, and hereby they got abundance peaceably into their Hands, whereof they cheated the Protestants, refus∣ing to restore them again; yet so confident were the Protestants at first of them, that they gave them Inventories of all they had, and digged up their best things that were hidden in the Ground, and deposited them in their Custody. They also got much into their Hands by fair Promises, deep Oaths and Engagements, that if they would deliver them their Goods, they would suffer them, with their Wives and Children, quietly to depart the Coun∣try;
<PB N="7" REF="007100_0006_102AF4B58DD35268"/>
and when they had got what they could, they afterwards murthered them.</P>
<P>Having thus seized upon their Goods and Cattle, ransackt their Houses, got their Persons, stript Man, Woman and Child naked, and so turned then out of doors, strictly prohibiting the <HI>Irish</HI> under great penal∣ties, not to give them any relief; by means hereof many miserably perish'd through cold nakedness and hunger.</P>
<P>In the Town of <HI>Coleraine,</HI> many of these poor peo∣ple that fled thither for succour, many thousands died in two days, so that the living could not bury the dead, but laid their Carcasses in ranks in waste and wide holes, speling them up as if they had been Herrings.</P>
<P>One <HI>Magdalen Redman</HI> deposeth, that she, and divers other <HI>Protestants,</HI> among whom were two and twenty Widows, were first robbed, and then stript naked, and when they had covered them∣selves with straw, the bloody <HI>Papists,</HI> threw in burning straw among them, on purpose to burn them; then they drove them out into the Woods in Frost and Snow, where many of them died with extream cold, and those that survived, lived miserably by reason of their many wants.</P>
<P>Yet though these bloody Villains exercised in∣human cruelties towards the poor <HI>Protestants,</HI> they would commonly boast, <HI>That these were but the be∣ginning of their sorrows,</HI> for indeed they made it good; for having disarmed the <HI>English,</HI> robbed them of their goods, stript them of their Clothes, and having their Persons in their power, they furiously broke out into all manner of abomina∣ble Cruelties, horrid Massacres, and execrable Murders.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007100_0007_102AF4B8567150C8"/>For there were multitudes murdered in cold blood, some as they were at Plough, others in their Houses, others in the High-ways; all with∣out any provocation, were suddenly destroyed.</P>
<P>In the Castle of <HI>Lisgool,</HI> were about one hundred and fifty Men, Women and Children consumed by fire. At the Castle of <HI>Tullah,</HI> which was delivered to <HI>Mac-Guire,</HI> upon composition, and faithful pro∣mises of fair quarter, as soon as he and his en∣tered, they began to strip the people, and most cruelly put them to the Sword, murdering them without mercy.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lissanskeach,</HI> they hanged and killed above one hundred of the <HI>Scottish Protestants,</HI> in the Coun∣ties of <HI>Ardmagh</HI> and <HI>Tyrone,</HI> where the <HI>Protestants</HI> were more numerous, their murders were more multiplied, and with greater cruelty.</P>
<P><HI>Mac-Guire</HI> coming to the Castle of <HI>Lissanskeach,</HI> desired to speak with Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> who admitted him in, he first burnt the Records of the County, then demanded one thousand pounds which was in the custody of Sir <HI>William Belfores,</HI> which as soon as he had, he caused Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> to hear Mass, and to swear that he would never alter from it, and then hanged him up with his Wife and Children; hanging and murdering above one hundred persons besides in that place.</P>
<P>At <HI>Portadown</HI> Bridge, there were one thousand Men, Women and Children, carried in several Companies, and all unmercifully drowned in the River. Yea, in that County there were one thou∣sand persons drowned in several places.</P>
<P>In one place an hundred and forty <HI>English</HI> were taken and driven like Cattle for many miles toge∣ther.
<PB N="9" REF="007100_0008_102AF4BAAE6EEAC8"/>
Other companies they carried out to a place fit for execution, and then murdered them. One hundred and fifteen Men, Women and Children, they sent with Sir <HI>Philemy Oneal</HI>'s pass, till they came to <HI>Portadown</HI> Bridge, and there drowned them.</P>
<P>At another time one hundred and forty <HI>Pro∣testants,</HI> being thrown in at the same Place, as any of them swam to the Shore, the bloody Villains, with the But-end of their Muskets knockt out their brains.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ardmagh, O Cane</HI> got together all the <HI>Pro∣testants</HI> thereabouts, pretending to conduct them to <HI>Colerane;</HI> but before they were a days Journey, they were all murthered, and so were many others, though they had Protections from Sir <HI>Philemy O∣neal.</HI> The aged people in <HI>Ardmagh</HI> were carried to <HI>Charlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt,</HI> and there murthered.</P>
<P>Presently after the Town of <HI>Ardmagh</HI> was burnt, and five hundred persons murthered and drowned. In <HI>Killaman,</HI> were forty eight families murthered, in one house twenty two Protestants were burned. In <HI>Kilmare</HI> all the inhabitants were stript and mas∣sacred, being two hundred familes: the whole was a common Butchery; many thousands perished by sword, famine, fire, water, and all other cruel deaths that rage and malice could invent.</P>
<P>At <HI>Casel</HI> they put all the <HI>Protestants</HI> into a loathsome Dungeon, kept them twelve weeks in great misery. Some they barbarously mangled, and left them languishing; some they hanged up twice or thrice, others they buried alive.</P>
<P>In <HI>Queens</HI> County, an <HI>English</HI> Man, his Wife, five Children and a Maid, were all hanged toge∣ther.
<PB N="10" REF="007100_0009_102AF4BEF2106800"/>
At <HI>Clownies</HI> sevent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Men were buried a∣live; some were wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and hanged upon Ten∣ter-hooks.</P>
<P>In <HI>Castle Cumber,</HI> two Boys wounded, and hung upon Butchers Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers. Some hanged up, and taken down to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss money, and then murthered. Some had their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellies ript up, and so left with their Guts above their heels.</P>
<P>In <HI>Kilkenny</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Woman was beaten into a ditch, where she died; her Child about six years old, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt up her belly and let out her Guts. One the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forced to Mass, then they wounded him, ript up his belly, took out his Guts, and so left him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ive.</P>
<P>A <HI>Scottish</HI> man they stript, and hewed to pie∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ript up his Wifes belly so that her Child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pt out; many other Women they hung up with Child, ript up their bellies, and let their infants fall out; some of the Children they gave to Dogs.</P>
<P>In the County of <HI>Ardmagh,</HI> they robbed, stripped, and murdered abundance of <HI>Protestants,</HI> whereof some they burned, some they slew with the Sword, some they hanged, some they starved to death; and meeting Mistress <HI>Howard</HI> and Mistress <HI>Frank∣land</HI> with six of their Children, and themselves both with Child, they murdered them all, ript o∣pen the Gentlewomens Bellies, took out their Children and threw them into a ditch. A young <HI>Scottish</HI> Woman's Child, they took by the heels, and dasht out its brains against a Tree; the like they did to many other Children.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Hill</HI> going with a young Child on her back, and four more by her side, they pulled the Child off her back, trode on it till it died, stripped her
<PB N="11" REF="007100_0010_102AF4C0BA641EC0"/>
and the other four Children naked, whereby they died of cold.</P>
<P>Some others they met with hanged them up upon a Windmill, and before they were half dead, cut them in pieces with their Skeins.</P>
<P>Many other <HI>Protestants,</HI> especially Women and Children, they pricked and stabbed with Skeins, Forks and Swords, slashing, cutting, and mangling them in their Heads and left them alive wallowing in their own blood, to languish, starve and pine to death.</P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>Lisgoole,</HI> being set on fire by these merciless <HI>Papists,</HI> a Woman leapt out at a Win∣dow to save her self from burning, whom they pre∣sently murthered; many fled to Vaults and Cellars, where they were all murthered. One <HI>Joan Addit</HI> they stabbed, and then put her Child of a quarter old to her Breast, and bid it, <HI>Suck English Bastard,</HI> and so left it to perish.</P>
<P>One <HI>Mary Barlow</HI> had her husband hanged, her self with six Children stript naked, in Frost and Snow, after which, sheltering themselves in a Cave, they had nothing there to eat for three weeks, but two old Calves skins, which they beat with stones, and so eat them hair and all.</P>
<P>In the cold weather, many thousands of <HI>Pro∣testants</HI> of all ranks, ages, and sexes, being turn∣ed out naked, perished of cold and hunger; thou∣sands of others were drowned, cast into Ditches, Bogs and Turf-pits: multitudes miserably burnt in houses; some that lay sick of Fevers they hanged up; some Men, Women, and Children they drove into boggy Pits, and knock't them on the head.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="007100_0011_102AF4C46F56ED50"/>Some aged Men and Women these barbarous <HI>Papists</HI> enforced their own Children to drown them, yea, some Children were compelied unnaturally to hang their own Parents, Wives forced to hang their own Husbands, and Mothers to cast their own Children into the Waters, after which themselves were murthered. In <HI>Sligo,</HI> they forced a young man to kill his Father, and then hanged him up. In another place they forced a Woman to kill her husband, then caused her son to kill her, and then hanged the Son: yea such was their malice against the <HI>English,</HI> that they taught their Children to kill <HI>English</HI> Children.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> Women that followed the camp, cryed out, <HI>Kill them all, spare neither Man, Woman nor Child.</HI> They took the Child of <HI>Thomas Soratt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> being about twelve years old, and boiled him in a Cauldron. One good wife <HI>Lin,</HI> and her Daugh∣ter, they carried into a Wood, first hanged the Mother, and then the Daughter in the hair of her Mothers head.</P>
<P>In some places they plucked out the eyes, and cut off the hands of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> and turned them into the Fields, where they perished. The Women in some places, stoned the <HI>English</HI> Women and Children to death. One man they shot through his thighs, digged a hole in the ground, set him upon his feet, fill'd up the hole, left out only his head, where he languished to death. Another man they held his feet in the fire till he was burnt to death.</P>
<P>In <HI>Munster</HI> they hanged up many Ministers in a most barbarous manner. One Minister they strip∣ped naked and drove him through the Town, pricking him with Darts and Rapiers, till he fell down dead.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007100_0012_102AF4C69883F0A0"/>These barbarous Villains vowed, <HI>That if any Pa∣rents digged Graves to bury their Children, they should be buried therein themselves.</HI> They stripped one <HI>Wil∣liam Loverd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> naked, then killed him before his Wife and Children. Divers Ministers bones that had been buried some years before, they digged up, because they were, as they say, <HI>Patrons of Heresy.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Children that went out into the fields to eat weeds and grass, they killed without pity.</P>
<P>A poor woman whose husband was taken by them, with two Children at her feet, and one at her breast, hoped to beg her husband, but they slew her and her sucking Child, brake the neck of another, and the third hardly escaped; and all this wicked∣ness they exercised upon the <HI>English,</HI> without any provocation given them. Alas, who can compre∣hend the fears, terrors, anguish, bitterness and per∣plexity that seized upon the poor <HI>Protestants,</HI> find∣ing themselves surprized without remedy, and wrapt up in all kind of outward miseries which could pos∣sibly by man be inflicted on human creatures? what sig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and groans, trembling and astonishment, what shrieks, cries, and bitter Lamentations of wives, children, servants and friends, howling and weeping, finding themselves without all hope of deliverance from their present miseries. How in∣exorable were their barbarous Tormentors, that compassed them on every side, without all bowels of compassion, or the least commiseration or pity; yea they boasted, upon their success, <HI>That the day was their own, and that e're long they would not leave one</HI> Protestant <HI>Rogue living, but would utterly destroy every one that had but a drop of</HI> English <HI>Blood in

them.</HI> Their women crying out, <HI>Slay them all, the</HI> English <HI>are fit meat for Dogs, and their Children are Bastards.</HI></P>
<P>The merciless <HI>Papists</HI> having set a Castle on fire, wherein were many <HI>Protestants,</HI> they rejoicing∣ly said, <HI>O how sweetly do they say!</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> when they had committed many cruel murthers, they brought seven <HI>Protestants</HI> heads, one, the head of a reverend Minister, all which they set upon the <HI>Market</HI>-cross, on a <HI>Market</HI> day, triumphing, slashing and mangling them; they put a gag in the Minister's mouth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lit his cheeks to his ears, and laid a leaf of a Bible upon it, and bid him <HI>Preach, for his mouth was wide enough.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Kilmore</HI> they put many <HI>Protestants,</HI> men, wo∣men and children, into a thatched house, and there burnt them. They throw Mrs. <HI>Maxwell</HI> into the river, when in labour, the child being half born when the mother was drowned.</P>
<P>In one place they burnt two <HI>Protestants</HI> Bibles, and then said, <HI>It was Hell Fire they burnt.</HI> Other Bibles they took, cut in pieces, and then burnt them, saying <HI>they would do the like to all</HI> Puritan <HI>Bibles.</HI> They took the Bible of a Minister, called Mr. <HI>Edward Slack,</HI> and opening it, they laid it in a Puddle of Water, and then stamped upon it say∣ing, <HI>A Plague on it, this Bible hath bred all the Quarrel.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Glastow,</HI> a Priest with some others, drew a∣bout forty <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scottish Protestants</HI> to be re∣conciled to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and then told them, <HI>They were in a good Faith, and for fear they should fall from it, and turn Hereticks,</HI> he with his Companions presently cut all their Throats.</P>

<P>In the Town of <HI>Sligo,</HI> forty <HI>Protestants</HI> were stript and locked up in a Cellar, and about Mid-night, a Butcher provided for the purpose, was seat in among them, who with his Ax butchered them all.</P>
<P>In <HI>Tyrawly,</HI> thirty or forty <HI>English,</HI> who had yielded to go to <HI>Mass,</HI> were put to their Choice, <HI>whether they would die by the Sword, or be drowned?</HI> they chose the latter; and so being driven to the Sea-side, these barbarous Villains, with their na∣ked Swords, forced them into the Sea; the Mo∣thers, with their Children in their Arms, wading to the Chin, were overcome by the waves, where they all perished.</P>

<P>In the Town of <HI>Sligo,</HI> all the <HI>Protestants</HI> were first robbed of their Estates, then cast into Goal, and about Mid-night were all stript naked, and there most cruelly and barbarously murthered with Swords, Axes, Skeins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> some of them being Women great with Child, their Infants thrust out their Arms and Legs at their Wounds; after which execrable Murthers, these Hell-hounds laid the dead naked Bodies of the Men upon the naked Bodies of the Women, in a most immodest Posture, where they left them till the next day to be looked upon by the <HI>Irish</HI> who beheld it with great delight. Also <HI>Isabel Beard,</HI> great with Child, hearing the lamentable Cries of those that were murthering, ran out into the Streets, where she was murthered, and the next day was found with the Child's Feet coming out of the Wounds in her Sides; many others were murthered in the Houses and Streets.</P>
<P>About <HI>Dungannon,</HI> were three hundred and six∣teen <HI>Protestants</HI> in the like barbarous manner mur∣theren; about <HI>Charlemont,</HI> above four hundred; about <HI>Tyrone</HI> two hundred and six.</P>
<P>One <HI>Mac Crew</HI> murthered thirty one in one morning.</P>
<P>Two young Villains murthered 140 poor Wo∣men and Children that could make no resistance.

An <HI>Irish</HI> Woman with her own Hands, murthered forty five.</P>
<P>At <HI>Portadown</HI> Bridge, were drowned above three hundred, at <HI>Lawgh</HI> were drowned above two hun∣dred in one day. In the Parish of <HI>Killamen,</HI> there were murthered one thousand and two hundred <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>Many young Children they cut in Quarters; eighteen <HI>Scottish</HI> Infants they hanged upon a Clo∣thiers Tenter-hooks; one fat Man they murthered and made Candles of his Grease; another <HI>Scottish</HI> Man they ript up his Belly, took one end of his small guts, tied it to a Tree, and forced him round about it, till they had drawn them all out of his Body, saying, <HI>they would try whether a</HI> Dogs <HI>or a</HI> Scottish <HI>Man's Guts were the longest.</HI></P>
<P>By the Command of Sir <HI>Philem O Neal,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Maxwell</HI> was drawn out of his Bed, being sick of a Fever, and murthered, his Wife being in Child-birth, the Child being half born, they stript naked, drove her about a flight shot, and drowned her in the black-Water; the like, or worse, they did to another <HI>English</HI> Woman in the same Town. One Mr. <HI>Watson</HI> they roasted a∣live. A <HI>Scottish</HI> Woman great with Child, they ript up her Belly, cut the Child out of her Womb, and so left it crawling on her Body.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Starkey</HI> Schoolmaster at <HI>Ardmagh,</HI> being a∣bove one hundred years old, they stript him naked, then took his daughters, being Virgins, whom they also stript naked, and then forced them
<PB N="18" REF="007100_0017_102AF4D221072F58"/>
to lead their aged Father to a Turf-pit, where they drowned them all three.</P>
<P>To one <HI>Henry Cowel</HI> a gallant Gentleman, they proffered his life, if he would marry one of their Trulls, or go to Mass; but he chose death rather than to consent to either.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Protestants</HI> they buried alive, sola∣cing themselves, whilst they were digging down old ditches upon them.</P>
<P>They brake the back bone of a Youth, and left him in the Fields; some days after he was found, having eaten the grass round about him: neither then would they kill him out-right, but removed him to better Pasture, wherein was fulfilled that saying, <HI>The tender mercies of the Wicked are cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>In the County of <HI>Antrim,</HI> they murthered nine hundred and fifty four <HI>Protestants</HI> in one Morning; and afterwards about twelve hundred more in that County near <HI>Les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egarvy,</HI> they forced twenty four <HI>Protestants</HI> into an House, and burnt them all.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Philem O-Neal</HI> boasted, <HI>that he had slain above six hundred at</HI> Garvah, <HI>and that he had left neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, woman nor child alive in the Barony of</HI> Munter∣long. In other places he murthered above two thousand Persons in their houses, so that many houses were filled with dead bodies.</P>
<P>Above twelve thousand were slain in the high∣ways, as they fled towards <HI>Downe.</HI> Many died of Famine, many died for want of Cloaths, being stript naked in a cold season; some thousands were drowned, so that in the Province of <HI>Ulster,</HI> there were about one hundred and fifty thousand mur∣thered by sundry kinds of torments and deaths.</P>
<P>The <HI>Popish English</HI> were no whit inferior, yea,
<PB N="19" REF="007100_0018_102AF4D3F6B4BED8"/>
rather exceeded the natural <HI>Irish</HI> in their cruelty a∣gainst the <HI>Protestants</HI> that lived among them, within the <HI>Pale,</HI> being not satisfied with their Blood, till they had seen the last drop thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Kinnard</HI> testified, <HI>That fifteen</HI> Protestants <HI>be∣ing imprisoned and their Feet in the Stocks, a</HI> Popish <HI>Boy being not above fourteen years old, slew them all in one night with his Skein.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>English</HI> Woman, who was newly delivered of two Children, some of these Villains violently com∣pelled her, in her great pain and sickness, to rise out of her Bed, and took one of the Infants that was living and dashed his Brains against the Stones, and then threw him into the River of <HI>Barrow;</HI> the like they did to many other Infants. Many others they hanged up without all pity.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Mont Garret,</HI> caused divers <HI>English</HI> Soldiers, that he had taken about <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> to be hanged, hardly suffering them to pray before their death.</P>
<P>One <HI>Fitz Patrick,</HI> an <HI>Irish Papist,</HI> enticed a rich Merchant that was a <HI>Protestant,</HI> to bring all his Goods to his House, promising safely to keep them, and to re-deliver them to him; but when he had gotten them into his possession, he took the Mer∣chant and his Wife, and hanged them both. The like he did by divers others.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Englishmen</HI>'s heads they cut off and carried them to <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> and on the Market-day set them on the Cross; where many, especially the Women stab'd, cut and slashed them.</P>
<P>A poor <HI>Protestant</HI> Woman with her two Chil∣dren, going to <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> these bloody miscreants baited them with Dogs, stabbed them with Skeins,
<PB N="20" REF="007100_0019_102AF4D5A1560EC0"/>
and pulled out the Guts of one of the Children, whereby they died; and not far off they took di∣vers men, women, and children, and hanged them up; One of the Women being great with Child, they ripped up her Belly as she hanged, so that the Child fell out in the Cawl alive. Some after they were hanged, they drew up and down till their Bowels were torn out.</P>
<P>How many thousands of <HI>Protestants</HI> were thus in∣humanly butchered by sundry kinds of deaths, we cannot ascertain.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Ulster</HI> we find about 150,000 murthered as before; what the number of the slain was in the three other Provinces, I find not upon Record, but certainly it was very great, for you have these passages in a general Remonstrance of the distressed <HI>Protestants</HI> in the Provinee of <HI>Mun∣ster, We may</HI> (say they) <HI>compare our woe to the saddest Parallel of any Story, Our Churches are profaned by Sacrifices to Idols; Our Habitations are become ruinous heaps; No quality, Age or Sex, priviledged from Mas∣sacre and lingering deaths, by being robbed, stript naked and so exposed to cold and famine. The famished In∣fants of murthered Parents swarm in our Streets, and for want of food, perish before our faces,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And all this cruelty that is exercised upon us, we know not for what cause, offence, or seeming provocation it is inflicted on us (sin excepted) saving that we were</HI> Pro∣testants, <HI>&amp;c. We can make it manifest that the de∣populations in this province of</HI> Munster, <HI>do well near equal those of the whole Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And thus in part you have heard of the merciless cruelties which the bloody <HI>Papists</HI> exercised to∣wards the <HI>Protestants:</HI> Let us now consider, at least,
<PB N="21" REF="007100_0020_102AF4D9EEEED4E0"/>
some of God's Judgments upon the <HI>Irish,</HI> whereby he hath not left the innocent Blood of his Servants to be altogether unrevenged.</P>
<P>These bloody Hell-hounds themselves confessed, <HI>That the Ghosts of divers of the</HI> Protestants <HI>which they had drowned at</HI> Portadown <HI>Bridge, were daily seen to walk upon the River, sometimes singing of Psalms, sometimes brandishing naked Swords, sometimes shreek∣ing in a most hideous and fearful manner.</HI> So that ma∣ny of the <HI>Popish Irish</HI> which dwelt near thereabouts, being affrighted therewith, were forced to remove their Habitation further off into the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Catheri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cook</HI> testifieth upon Oath, <HI>That when the</HI> Irish <HI>had barbarously drowned one hundred and eighty</HI> Protestant <HI>men, women, and children, at</HI> Portadown <HI>Bridge, about nine days after, she saw the apparition of a Man bolt upright in the River, standing breast high, with his hands lifted up to Heaven; and conti∣nued in that Posture from</HI> December <HI>to the end of</HI> Lent, <HI>at which time some of the</HI> English <HI>Army passing that way, saw it also, after which it vanished away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Price,</HI> testified upon Oath, <HI>That she, and other Women, whose Husbands and Children were drowned in that place, hearing of those Apparitions, went thither one evening, at which time they saw one like a Woman rise out of the River, breast high, her hair hanging down, which with her Skin, was as white as Snow, often crying out,</HI> Revenge, Revenge, Re∣venge, <HI>which so affrighted them, that they went their way.</HI></P>
<P>Divers <HI>Protestants</HI> were thrown into the River of <HI>Belterbet,</HI> and when any of them offered to swim to the Land, they were knoked on the head with Poles, after which their Bodies were not seen for
<PB N="22" REF="007100_0021_102AF4DB790A5F08"/>
six weeks; but after the end thereof the murtherers coming again that way, the Bodies came floating up to the very Bridge where they were.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mac-Gennis</HI> with his Company slew Mr. <HI>Turge</HI> Minister of the <HI>Newry,</HI> with divers other <HI>Protestants,</HI> after which the said <HI>Mac-Gennis</HI> was so affrighted with the Apprehensions of the said Mr. <HI>Turge,</HI> his being continually in his presence, that he commanded his Soldiers not to slay any more of them, but such as should be slain in Battle.</P>
<P>A young Woman being stript almost naked, there came a Rogue to her, bidding her, <HI>Give him her money, or he would run her through with his Sword.</HI> Her answer was, <HI>You cannot kill me except God give you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve;</HI> Whereupon he ran three times at her naked body with his drawn Sword, and yet never pierced her Skin, whereat he being confounded went his way and left her. This was attested by divers Women that were present and saw it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Protestant</HI> Ministers whom they sur∣prized, their manner was first to strip them, and after bind them to a Tree, or Post, where they pleased, and then to ravish their Wives and Daugh∣ters before their faces (in sight of all their merciless rabble) with the basest Villains they could pick out, after they hanged up their husbands and pa∣rents before their faces, and then cut them down before they were half dead, and quarter'd them, after dismember'd them, and stopped their Mouths therewith.</P>
<P>They basely abused one Mr. <HI>Trafford,</HI> a Minister in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who being assaulted by these bloody Wolves of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Brood that knew not God, nor any Bowels of mercy. This distres∣sed
<PB N="23" REF="007100_0022_102AF4DD5F60CA88"/>
Minister desired but so much time as to call up∣on God, before he went out of the World; but these merciless wretches would admit no time, but instantly fell upon him, hackt and hewed him to pieces.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Barck Dunstan</HI>'s Wife ravished before him, slew his Servants, spurned his Children till they di∣ed, bound him with Match to a board that his eyes burst out, cut off his ears and nose, teared off both his cheeks, after cut off his arms and legs, cut out his tongue, and after run a red hot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on into him. <HI>These Particulars, with many more, were attested before the Commissioners appointed for that pur∣pose.</HI></P>
