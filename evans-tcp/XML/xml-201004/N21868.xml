<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO present, at one view, a series of the most remarkable events, transactions, and acci∣dents which have occurred in ancient and modern times, and to transmit to posterity the names and atchievements of great men, particularly of those by whose exertions, under Divine Providence, the United States enjoy their present happy form of government, has been the principal design con∣templated in the present publication.</P>
<P>Through the whole of the following pages, the editor has selected his articles from historians of the first rank, and from the most authentic An∣nalists; hence he hopes, that his performance will be found useful to every class of readers—To the student it may frequently save the trouble of turn∣ing over a number of volumes to refresh his me∣mory; and to those whose leisure cannot admit of the perusal of many books, it may contain both entertainment and instruction. It will also be a remembrance to those who have forgotten what they have read, and may serve as an epitome of universal history, particularly of that part which respects America.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="028800_0005_0FDD4ABC846DC618"/>To obviate the confusion which would be oc∣casioned by blending all transactions, &amp;c. toge∣ther, the editor has classed the different subjects under separate heads, each ranged in alphabetical order, which mode of arrangement he hopes will, in various respects, be found more convenient than the other.</P>
<P>Through every part of the work, the editor can with confidence assert, that he has anxiously endeavoured to render the information contained as interesting and accurate as possible. Where he has sailed in either of these respects, which he hopes has been seldom the case, he solicits the indulgence of a candid public.</P>

D. 136; the Emperor Leo I. wanting to compel them to turn Christians, they set fire to their houses at Constan∣tinople and perished in the flames, 722; many of them massacred in London, at the coronation of Richard I. 1189; they were all apprehended throughout England in one day; their effects confiscated, and their persons banished the realm, to the number of 15,000, in 1287; they were massacred in Germany, on a ridiculous sus∣picion of having poisoned the springs and wells 1348.</P>
<P>Persecutions, by the Jews, the first 63; the second 44. B.

<P>Persecutions, of the different sects of Christians against one another; a number of the followers of Luther, were killed in Germany by the Catholics, 1525, and in England 1556; Calvin had some persons hanged who opposed his doctrines about 1560: several Catholics were executed for their religious principles, in the reign of Edward VI. of England, about 1550; Puritans were executed in the reign of Queen Eliza∣beth, about 1580; during the reign of Charles I. and II. of England, the Presbyterians were severely perse∣cuted and many put to death; about this time a number of Presbyterians or Puritans, fled to New England, and in October 1656 passed a law, inflicting the punishment of death on such Quakers, as should return to that colony after banishment, and several suffered under this iniquitous law, which, however, was repealed 1661.</P>

<P>FRANCE, the country of the ancient Gauls, a colony of the Belgae from Germany were permitted to settle in it, 200 B. C. It was conquered by the Romans 25 B. C.; over-run by the Goths, Vandals, &amp;c. who divid∣ed it amongst themselves from A. D. 400, to 476; when the Franks, another set of German emigrants, com∣pleated the foundation of the late kingdom of that country, under Pharamond. It was peopled by the natives of Germany, who crossed the Rhine to invade the Gauls. The assemblies called the States General, first met 1302, and continued till 1614. This country had long been subject to the most despotic government, and their national debt had become so enormous, that it was impossible to pay the interest. The clamours of the public creditors and of the people at large, arrested the attention of the court, and to appease them, a meeting of representatives of the Clergy, Nobility, and people was called, who convened at Paris, May 5, 1789. The <HI>Tiers etats</HI> or representatives of the people, after using various effects to obtain an union with the clergy and nobility, without success, declared themselves the <HI>National Assembly,</HI> and proceeded to business, June 17, following; and on the 19th they were joined by a majority of the Clergy. On the 20th the representatives of the people, were repulsed from the door of their usual place of meeting, by an armed force sent thither, by order of the court. Determined to persevere in the re∣generation of France, they then assembled in a Tennis court, where, in the midst of applauding thousands, they took a solemn oath "never to separate, till the consti∣tution should be completed," on the 23d the king held, <HI>a royal session,</HI> when he declared <HI>null</HI> the deliberations and resolves of the 17th, and <HI>ordered</HI> the deputies im∣mediately to separate and to appear before him next day.

When the king retired, he was followed by the nobility and a part of the clergy; but the deputies of the com∣mons remained on the benches, and declared "that they were there by the voice of the people, and that nothing should expel them but the power of the bayonet." The Bastille was taken by the national guards, and the governor and a number of other officers killed by the populace, on account of their perfidy, July 14. In November the Assembly abolished the use of <HI>Lettres de Catchet,</HI> and the distinction of orders; on the 4th Feb. 1790, the king <HI>voluntarily</HI> appeared before the National Assembly, and declared, "that he would defend the new constitution to the last moment of his existence;" and on June 20, 1791, as a proof of his sincerity, de∣parted privately with his family, from Paris, with a view, as was universally believed, of levying war against his country, and left a paper behind him, revoking all his protestations of attachment to the new constitution. He was, however, intercepted at Varennes and recon∣ducted back to Paris, June 25; on July 17, a great con∣course of people assembled in the Champ de Mars, with the professed design of petitioning, against the re-esta∣blishment of the king. These were however dispersed by the National guard under La Fayette, but not before 12 men were killed, and 50 or 60 wounded; on Sep∣tember 13, the king appeared in the Assembly and so∣lemnly swore, "to be faithful to the nation and to the law, and to employ the powers vested in him for the maintenance of the constitution, and the due execution of the law." The Assembly soon after passed a decree authorising the banishment of nonjuring priests, and another for the establishment of a camp in the neigh∣bourhood of Paris, to both of which the king gave his constitutional <HI>veto.</HI> From this unpopular measure, his flight, &amp;c. his attachment to the new order of things was much questioned; hence petitions were presented to the assembly for his deposition on 3d, 6th, and 7th of August 1792, in consequence of which, and of the massacre at the Thuillieries on the 10th following, of

He was afterwards condemned and beheaded, on January 21, 1793; on June 23, following, the convention agreed upon a con∣stitution purely democratic, which, however, amidst the din of arms, and the jarring of contending parties, it has been hitherto found impracticable to put in exe∣cution.

The kings of England were called Lords of Ireland, till 1542, when Henry VIII. took the title of king; Ireland was admitted to a free trade by the British parliament 1779, and released from subserviency to the Privy Council of Britain 1782.

A new Empire, called the Parthian, was, however, founded on its ruins by the Persians, under Arbaces 250 B. C. In 651, the Saracens put an end to that empire, and Persia became a prey to the Tartars and a province of Indos∣tan, till Nadir Shaw, who assumed the named of Kouli Khan, usurped the government and once more raised Persia to a powerful kingdom. The great principle of his government was to strike terror into his subjects, by the most cruel executions. His conduct at last became intolerable, and in 1747, his relations assassinated him, partly in self defence. Since his death, the whole empire has been rent by commotions, as different in∣dividuals, in the different provinces, have been struggling for sovereignty, in order to obtain which, torrents of blood have been shed, and the most shocking crimes committed with impunity.</P>
<P>Poland was once the country of the Vandals, who left it to invade the Roman empire. It was originally divided into many small states or principalities, almost independent of each other, though they generally had some prince, who was paramount over the rest. About the year 700, the people, through the oppression of their petty chiefs, gave the supreme command, under the title of Duke, to Cracus, the founder of the city Cracow. This title was retained till the year 999, when Boleslaus assumed the appellation of king. Per∣haps, no country has been more distracted by party or more injured by foreign influence than Poland. In the year 1773, it was partitioned by the combined

despots of Prussia, Russia and Germany. From this dismemberment, Poland found herself reduced to a humiliating state of dependence on Russia, from which the patriots had, at different times, wished to extricate their country. The French revolution held out a me∣morable lesson. A plan was accordingly projected for an effectual improvement in their constitution, which was adopted on May 3, 1791; but this plan has been since overturned by the Russians. According to the last accounts, <HI>the good, the benevolent, and the virtuous</HI> Stanislaus king of Poland, has retired from his country, to which he can be no longer useful, and means to end his days in Rome as a private individual.</P>

The second Punic war began 218, and the third 149 B. C. In this last, the Romans, after a siege of three years took Carthage and utterly destroyed it 146 B. C. In the year 59 B. C. Pompey and Caesar began to contend for the supreme power over the commonwealth, which produced a bloody civil war, in which Pompey was killed 41 B. C.; and Caesar having afterwards over∣turned the liberties of his country, became obnoxious to the people, and was assassinated in the Senate house 44 B. C. This Catastrophe was, however, so far from retarding, that it rather accelerated the intended revo∣lution; for the state being divided into two factions, between Octavius Caesar and Mark Anthony, a civil war ensued 48 B. C. and in 27 B. C. the republic was changed to an Empire, and the titles of Augustus and Imperator conferred on Octavius Caesar, by the senate and people. The Goths, Vandals, and other barbarous nations of the North, began to invade the Roman Em∣pire about A. D. 250. The seat of Empire was re∣moved

In 726, it re∣volted from the Greek Emperors, became a free State and was governed by a Senate. The Senate and people acknowledged Charlemagne, king of France, as emperor of the West, who surrendered the city and dutchy to the Pope, reserving the sovereignty to himself A.

<P>Scotland, anciently Caledonia, has at least as great pretensions to antiquity as any nation in Europe, having, according to their historians, possessed that kingdom for about 2000 years, without ever being en∣tirely conquered; though at certain periods, they have been in part subdued and overrun by the Romans, the English, and Danes. Their more early history is so enveloped in fable and obscurity, that nothing certain can be drawn from it. Its true history began 328 B. C. when Fergus I. came from Ireland, and was re∣ceived as their king. On the death of Alexander III. in 1283, no less than 12 candidates disputed for the sovereignty, and as they could not agree amongst them∣selves, they appointed Edward I. of England, as Arbi∣trator, who very <HI>conscienciously</HI> set aside all their claims, and took possession of the kingdom for himself; nor were the Scotch able entirely to recover what they had lost, till 1314.

<P>Spain, was probably first peopled by the Celtae, from Gaul, to which it lies contiguous; or from Africa, from which it is only separated by the narrow strait of Gibraltar. It had, at different periods, been overrun by different powers, but was at last finally subdued by the Romans, 216 B. C. The Goths and Vandals over∣turned the Roman power 409, and continued in pos∣session of it, till it was conquered by the Moors in 711. Spain had, hitherto, contained a number of small king∣doms, all of which were swallowed up in Castille and Arragon 1492, and in 1497, these two were united by the Queen of Spain, having married the king of Arragon, who then assumed the title of Catholic majesty. The Moors had been repeatedly overthrown, and a complete end was put to their dominion 1511, and in the beginning of the 17th century, an edict was
<PB N="175" REF="028800_0181_0FDD4C58871CD8B8"/>

<P>Switzerland, was formerly inhabited by the Helvetii who were subdued by Caesar 57 B. C. It remained subject to the Romans, till it was conquered by the Alemans from Germany 395. These, however, were driven out by Clovis I. of France 496, and Switzer∣land became part of the kingdom of Burgundy. Their mountainous, uninviting situation formed a better secu∣rity for their liberties, than their forts or armies, hence their subjection to Burgundy and Germany, was no∣minal, rather than real, till about the year 1300, when the Emperor Albert I. treated them with so much rigour, that they petitioned him against the cruelty of his governors. This, however, was so far from obtain∣ing the desired effect, that it only tended to double the hardships of the people, and one Gressler an Austrian Governor, carried his tyranny so far, that he set up a hat upon a pole, to which he ordered the people to pay the same obeisance as to himself. Incensed at this treat∣ment, the Swiss revolted, under William Tell, and formed a government for themselves, on republican principles, 1315, which was ratified by the different powers of Europe 1649.</P>

<P>United States of America. At the conclusion of the war in 1763, between Britain and France, the British colonies of North America, were in a state of high po∣litical
<PB N="176" REF="028800_0182_0FDD4C59B1756C38"/>
prosperity. Their population, commerce and wealth advanced with a rapid pace. Their internal go∣vernment was conducted with a degree of steadiness, frugadity and wisdom, which have been seldom, or, perhaps never equalled. But the war was scarcely finished, when Britain attempted to reduce these colo∣nies to a state of the most unconditional servitude. In March 1764, a bill was passed in the British parliament, by which heavy duties were laid on commodities im∣ported, by the colonists, from such West India Islands, as did not belong to Britan, and another bill was soon soon after passed, to restrain the currency of paper money. The constant plea of the Americans, during the whole course of the controversy, rested upon this doctrine, that <HI>taxation without representation,</HI> was but another name for slavery. Their complaints were loud; but the British parliament was so far from redressing their grievances, that on March 22, 1765, the stamp act followed. The pretended reason of these taxations was, that a sum might be produced, sufficient for the defence of the colonies against a foreign enemy. To this, the Americans answered, that they were fully able to defend themselves, and that, at any rate, as they were not represented in the British parliament, that body had no right to tax them. To this reasoning, however, the British ministry were inattentive; hence a tempest of in∣dignation burst out, at once, all over the colonies: non-importation agreements were universally embraced, and, in consequence of the general alarm, the first <HI>American Congress</HI> was held at New York 1765. Con∣founded at this opposition, the British cabinet shrunk from its usurpation, and the stamp act was repealed. They, however, issued a declaratory bill, setting forth the authority of Britain, to bind the colonies, by laws and statutes, in all cases whatever. And in June 1767, a bill laying a duty on tea, paper, painted glass, and colours, was passed by parliament. This act excited still more universal alarm and indignation, all over the continent, than even the stamp act itself. Troops arri∣ved
<PB N="177" REF="028800_0183_0FDD4C5B40BD25E0"/>
at Boston, and it appeared to be the design of the British government, to <HI>dragoon</HI> the Americans, by mili∣tary logic, into such measures, as they thought proper. The colonists, however, remained firm, and the ministry repealed all the other parts of the obnoxious act, except the duty of 3<ABBR>d</ABBR> per lb. on tea: and this was left, to main∣tain, what was called, <HI>the dignity of the crown.</HI> Grie∣vances multiplied, particularly in Massachussetts, and petitions, in the most respectful terms, were presented to the king, which, however, were treated with con∣tempt. In the midst of this confusion, three ships, laden with tea arrived Boston and as, according to the act of parliament, it was subject to a duty of 3<ABBR>d</ABBR> per lb. 340 chests were destroyed by the populace, in November 1773. On March 25, 1774, the Boston port-bill was passed by parliament, by which bill, that port was to be shut, from and after the first June ensuing, till satis∣faction should be made to the East India company for the tea destroyed. The Ministry had expected, that the other seaport towns, the commercial rivals of Boston, would rejoice in her calamity, and that by having this opportunity of aggrandizing themselves, the whole country would soon be reduced to submission. But here they were sadly disappointed, for contributions poured in from every quarter, and the whole continent of America was thrown into a ferment. On September 5, 1774, deputies met at Philadelphia, from the dif∣ferent colonies, as the first General Congress, and, in November following, petitoned the king for a repeal of grievances, to which, it is unnecessary to add, that no attention was paid. The first action between the Ame∣ricans and king's troops was, at Lexington, April 19. 1775. On May 20, following, the colonies agreed on Articles of confederation and perpetual union. June 16, General George Washington, was unanimously appointed commander in chief of the American army. July 6, Congress published a declaration, setting forth the cause and necessity of their taking up arms; and on July 4, 1776, in consequence of the repeated provoca∣tions
<PB N="178" REF="028800_0184_0FDD4C6177EA1258"/>
which the colonies had received from Britain, Congress declared these colonies to be free, sovereign and independent, under the name of the UNITED STATES. The different battles they fought, to obtain their liberty, have been mentioned, under the head of <HI>battles, sages, &amp;c.</HI> We shall, therefore only mention, that, after the surrender of Cornwallis, the reduction of America appeared impracticable to the British, and that, in consequence, an address was presented to the king, against the further prosecution of offensive war in America. On May 5, following, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, with powers to treat of peace. On November 30, provisional articles of peace were signed at Paris, between the American and British com∣missioners, by which, the United States were declared, by the king of Britain to be free, sovereign and inde∣pendent, and the definitive treaty was ratified by Con∣gress, January 4, 1784. During the war, the articles of confederation had served to keep the States united; but upon the return of peace, the general government was found, by no means to possess those powers, which are necessary for the right administration of a well regulated republic. In 1785, Mr James Madison, at present a re∣presentative in Congress, brought forward a motion in the house of Delegates of Virginia, to appoint commis∣sioners, who, in concurrence with others, to be ap∣pointed by the different States, should form a system of commercial regulations, to be recommended for adop∣tion to the different State legislatures. In consequence of this recommendation, commissioners from several of the States met at Annapolis in 1786; but finding that the States were generally not represented, and that the authority, given by such as were, fell far short of the objects to be accomplished, they agreed to request of Congress, to recommend to the different States, to send deputies to a general convention, to be held at Philadelphia, in the following year, for the purpose of devising such a form of government, as would best pro∣mote the welfare and happiness of their constituents.

May 1787, the Federal convention assembled, and on September 17, recommended to the different States the new constitution, or present system of federal go∣vernment. This constitution underwent the most severe examination, and after a full discussion, in the different State conventions, was at last adopted by all. The new government was organized at New York, March 3, 1789, and George Washington was the first President, John Adams the first Vice President, and Frederic Augustus Muhlenburg the first speaker of the house of representatives. Under this excellent and hitherto wisely administered constitution, the citizens of the United States have experienced a degree of com∣mercial and agricultural prosperity, unknown to other nations, and while the different governments of Europe, are at present convulsed to the very foundation, by the firm and temperate conduct of our Executive, we have still enjoyed, that greatest of all blessings, peace. One circumstance alone has tended to interrupt our tran∣quillity, viz, the insurrection which broke out in the counties of Allegany, Washington, Fayette, and West∣moreland in Pennsylvania, on account of the excise, in 1794, This, however, was happily suppressed by the prudence of the President of the United States, and the good conduct of the militia, who, at his call, readily stepped forth in support of the violated laws of their country, and order was restored without bloodshed. Having given this cursory view of the foundation of the general government, we now proceed to the indivi∣dual States, taking them according to their geogra∣phical order, from North to South.</P>

<P>New Hampshire, grant of, by the Plymouth com∣pany 1621; and first began to be settled 1623. It was put under the jurisdiction of Massachussetts 1650, and

separated from that government 1679. In 1692, the inhabitants again petitioned to be united with Massa∣chussetts, and were for a short time under their juris∣diction. A provincial Congress took up the civil government, January 5, 1776, and on October 31, 1783, they established their present constitution.</P>
<P>Massachussetts, grant of, by the Plymouth company, to Sir Henry Roswell and others 1627; a royal char∣ter granted 1628. Emigration to this country was prohibited by England 1633. The first general court held by representation was 1634. The Governor and assistants first sat in a separate apartment from the Re∣presentatives 1644. In consequence of a proclamation issued by General Gage, the representatives met at Salem, and resolved themselves into a provincial Con∣gress, October 5, 1774. A convention met for settling a constituion, September 1, 1779, and continued by adjournment until March 2, 1780, when they agreed on a constitution which was afterwards ratified by the general court, in June following. An insurrection headed by Shays, Parsons, &amp;c. broke out in this State in 1786, but was suppressed without much difficulty. The ringleaders were convicted, but afterwards par∣doned by government.</P>
<P>Rhode Island, settlement of, first began by Mr. Roger Williams, and his persecuted brethren 1635. Their first charter was granted 1662, which was vacated 1684, and again resumed 1689. Through the whole of the late war, this Statemanifested the most patriotic spirit. Since the peace they have uniformly evinced an excessive jealousy for their rights, and, therefore, when it was proposed to invest Congress, with power to levy an impost of five per¦cent on imports, by its pertinacious resistance, was the principal means of defeating the measure. It also remained long obstinate against the adoption of the Federal constitution. Its obstinacy, however, was at last overcome, and on May 29, 1790, it became a member of the Federal union.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="028800_0187_0FDD4C6A9CF39730"/>Connecticut, the first grant of, made by the Presi∣dent and Council of Plymouth to the Earl of Warwick 1630. The first charter was granted by Charles II. 1662. The constitution of this State is founded on their charter, and as the people have been contented with that form of government, they have not framed a new constitution, since the declaration of Independence.</P>
<P>New York, state of, was first settled by the Dutch 1614, who surrendered to the English, under Colonel Nichols, August 27, 1664, to whom it was confirmed by the peace of Breda 1667. The first assembly of re∣presentatives of the people was held 1683. On April 20, 1777, New York established an independent con∣stitution.</P>
<P>New Jersey, originally a Dutch settlement, had its first charter granted to James Duke of York 1634, who afterwards granted it to Lord Berkeley, and Sir George Carteret 1644. The proprietors surrendered their rights to the crown 1702, and it continued a royal Government, until July 2, 1776, when the inhabitants established an independent constitution.</P>
<P>Pennsylvania, charter of, granted to William Penn, March 4, 1680. The first General Assembly met at Chester, December 4, 1682. At this time William Penn effected an union of the lower counties, now the State of Delaware, with Pennsylvania Mr. Penn granted a new charter, which was merely a constitu∣tion or form of government; but as it was found incon∣venient, it was given up in May 1700, and a new one granted, October 28, 1701. The inhabitants, of the lower counties, refused to accept this charter, and thus separated themselves from the province of Pennsylvania. They afterwards had their own assembly, in which the Governor of Pennsylvania presided. This State adopted an independent constitution 1776; and established the present 1790.</P>
<P>Delaware, the State of, originally settled by the Swedes and Fins. The people of this state, in Septem∣ber 1776, by their representatives, chosen for the ex∣press

purpose, assembled and established a form of go∣vernment, which in 1792, was superceded by their present constitution, see <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Maryland, charter of, granted to Lord Baltimore, June 20, 1632. The first regular assembly, was consti∣tuted by a law passed 1638; and in the year 1642, was divided into two houses, In the year 1689, a rumour was artfully disseminated, "that a Popish administra∣tion, supported by Papists had leagued with Indians, to cut off the Protestants in the province; nor was it possible for government to satisfy the people of the false∣hood, folly and absurdity of the report. The Pro∣prietary, therefore found himself constrained to sur∣render those prerogatives, which he had uniformly ex∣ercised, with an unexampled attention to the rights of the people. In the year 1716, the government was restored to the Proprietor, and continued in his and his successors hands till the late revolution. The conven∣tion of this State, resolved on measures for securing the province and providing for its defence, July 26, 1775, and on August 14, 1776, agreed on their independent constitution.</P>
<P>Virginia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virginia, according to its ancient limits, comprehended the greatest part of the new United States, as it extended from the 34th to the 45th degree of latitude.</NOTE> first began to be settled 1584. King James I. of England, granted letters patent to Sir Thomas Gage and his associates, for the settlement of this country, April 10, 1606, and a second, on a more extensive scale 1609. In 1621, two councils were ap∣pointed, the one to be called the council of State, and the other the General Assembly. In 1624, king James suspended their charter, and in 1626, the government wholly reverted to the crown. In 1642, the Virginians appear to have been uneasy with Cromwell's govern∣ment, to which however, they submitted in 1651, after having first secured their rights, by stipulation. Their

convention agreed on an independent constitution, July 5, 1776.</P>
<P>North Carolina, the inhabitants of, were but few, till the year 1700, when their number was augmented by the arrival of a body of Palatines from Germany, who had been reduced to the greatest indigence, by the calamities of war. Previous to the year 1728, North and South Carolina had constituted one government; they were then, however, divided, for the more com∣modious administration of affairs. In 1775, North Carolina, united with the other colonies against British oppression, and on December 16, 1776, established their independent constitution.</P>
<P>South Carolina, including North Carolina and Georgia, the charter of, granted 1662. Their first legislative assembly convened 1669. They were at first governed by a system framed by Mr. John Locke; but having found by experience, that this system was inapplicable to their situation, it was abolished in 1692. They agreed on an independent form of government in 1776, which was established by act of the legislature, May 19, 1778. On May 11, 1779, the civil authority proposed to general Prevost, that the state should re∣main neuter, till the close of the war, and that they would then follow the fate of their neighbours, provided, that the British army should be withdrawn. But as this proposal was not excepted, a general revolt took place in favour of Congress, July 1780.</P>
<P>Georgia, the state of, obtained their charter 1732; acceded to the articles of confederation, July 1775; and on May 6, 1789, they ratified their present consti∣tution, which is formed upon a plan similar to that of the United States.</P>
<P>Territory, N. W. of the Ohio, an ordinance of Con∣gress was passed for its temporary government, July 13, 1787.</P>
<P>Kentucky, the State of, has, perhaps, been one of the most growing colonies in the world, as it only began to be settled in the year 1754; and in 1790, according

to the census contained 73,670 souls; but from the im∣perfect manner in which that enumeration was made, the rapid encrease of population, and the continual mi∣grations from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther States, it is certain that at pre∣sent, May 1795, the number must be more than double. This territory was erected into an independent State, by act of Congress, December 6, 1790, and received into the union, June 1, 1792.</P>
<P>Territory, South of the Ohio, an ordinance of Con∣gress, for its temporary government was passed by Con∣gress 1787.</P>
<P>Wales, first inhabited by Britons, on their being expelled from England by the Saxons 685; conquered by William I. 1091. The whole country was subdued by Edward I. 1282. The Welch, however were not entirely reconciled to this revolution, till the Queen happened to be brought to bed of a son at Carnarvon, in 1284, whom Edward stiled Prince of Wales, which title, the heir apparent to the crown of Britain, has borne ever since. Wales was incorporated with England by act of parliament 1535.</P>

To relate the many instances of rapine, desolation, and injustice which a lust of gain has induced them to commit, would re∣quire many volumes. Let the following extracts suffice. Lord Cornwallis, in a letter dated 18th September, 1789, has the following remarkable words: "I can safely affirm, that one third of the Company's territory in Indostan, is now a jungle inhabited by wild beasts;" and Colonel Dow, a Scotch officer, who had been long in India, and who wrote the history of Indostan, thus describes the effect of their bar∣barity in that unhappy country. "The civil wars, to which our violent desire of creating nabobs give rise, were attended with tragical events. Bengal was depopulated by every spe∣cies of public distress.

A convention of delegates from the dif∣ferent societies in the United States, met at Philadelphia, January 1, 1794, when they elected Joseph Bloomfield, New Jersey, as their president. In consequence of a me∣morial which they presented to Congress, the citizens and residents of the United States were, by a law, passed March 22, 1794, prohibited from "procuring, from any foreign kingdom, place or country, the inhabitants of such king∣dom, place or country, to be transported to any foreign country, port or place whatever, to be sold or disposed of as <HI>slaves.</HI>" In January 1795, delegates from the several societies again met in convention at Philadelphia, when they elected Benjamin Rush, M.

The French conven∣tion has already declared liberty to all men without excep∣tion. Long debates have taken place in the British parli∣ament on the same subject, and it is likely, that, by that government, the trade will be speedily abolished. In seve∣ral of the American states there are few, and in others no slaves. That there should be any under a government of equal liberty, and which declares that all men are born alike free, must to the thinking part of mankind, excite astonish∣ment: but the present citizens of the United States are too enlightened, for a much longer time, to tolerate such an enormity, which experience has confirmed to be subver∣sive of justice and morality, incompatible with sound po∣licy, repugnant to the principles of a republican govern∣ment, and contradictory to the benevolent spirit of the Christian religion.</P></NOTE>, the Society for promoting the abolition of, the first was formed in Pennsylvania in 1774.</P>

<P>Plague, almost the whole world visited by one 767 B. C.; one so dreadful at Rome, as to carry off 10,000 people in a day, 78; a terrible one all over Europe, Asia, and Africa, which lasted near fifty years, 577; in England, which carried off 30,000 people, 772; in Scotland, which swept away 40,000 inhabitants, 954; in England 1025, 1247, and 1347; in Germany, which cut off 93,000 peo∣ple, 1348; in France and England very dreadful, 1362: again 1379; in London, which killed 30,000 persons, 1407; again 1477 and in 1499, which cut off 30,000 people; throughout England so terrible, that half the people died, 1517; in London, which car∣ried off 30,578 persons, 1604; at Constantinople, when 200,000 persons died, 1611; at London, which carried off 35,417 inhabitants, 1625; again 1631; at Lyons, in France, which carried off 60,000 peo∣ple, 1632. The great plague, as it was emphati∣cally called, at London, was brought there in some Levant goods, which came from Holland, about the close of the year 1664. These goods were carried
<PB N="208" REF="028800_0214_0FDD4CB61F1E4B18"/>
to a house near Drury Lane, where they were first opened, and here two Frenchmen died in a few days after. The disorder speedily communicated to other houses in the neighbourhood, when several of the in∣habitants, being struck with terror, removed to dif∣ferent parts of the city, and thus the plague began to spread. Its further progress was checked by a hard frost, which set in this winter, and continued till the month of March 1665, when its virulence again revived. As soon as the magistrates sound that the contagion extended into different parts of the city, an order was issued for shutting up infected houses, to stop the communication of the disorder. These houses had red crosses painted on the doors, with this inscription, <HI>Lord, have mercy upon us!</HI> and watchmen were placed before them, to hand the af∣flicted, necessaries and medicines, and to prevent them from coming abroad, until 40 days after their reco∣very. But notwithstanding every caution, the con∣tagion continued to spread; so that in the first week of July the bills of mortality rose to 725; the next week to 1089; the third week to 1843; and the next week to 2010: in August the deaths amounted to between 8 and 10,000 per week. Towards the fall, the disorder became less frequent, and yielded to the force of medicine; and in the winter this great enemy of mankind received an effectual check. According to the bills of mortality, the number of burials this year was 97,306; of which number 68,596, were attributed to the plague. The regis∣ters were, however, very inaccurately kept; and it was the opinion of eye-witnesses, that at least 100,000 perished by the plague.</P>
<P>The great plague at Marseilles, in France, was brought there from Syria, in May 1720; its progress was at first extremely slow, and the physicians, who had opened some dead bodies, and declared the dangerous nature of the disorder, were insulted by the rabble: nor was it, till the end of July, that the inhabitants began to perceive their danger. A variety of expedients were
<PB N="209" REF="028800_0215_0FDD4CB789CF8150"/>
then adopted to prevent the spreading of the distemper, as well as the progress of famine, which, likewise, be∣gan to stare them in the face. Fires were kindled in different parts of the city, but, from experience, at Mar∣seilles and other places, fires appear rather to have the effect of spreading, than checking the progress of conta∣gious disorders. On the 21st of August the number of dead increased so prodigiously, that the magistrates found it impracticable to get them carried out of town to be thrown into the pits: they were, therefore, under the necessity of getting the assistance of the galley slaves, and having them buried in the vaults of the church∣yards. In the month of September the disease raged with unabated fury; in the month of October, it began to decrease without any visible cause. In November the contagion continued to decrease; and by the first of December, the danger was supposed to be at an end. It was not, however, entirely removed till the month of March following. The deaths were estimated at be∣tween 50 and 60,000.</P>

It began in Philadelphia 1793, and committed dreadful havoc. As many of
<PB N="216" REF="028800_0222_0FDD4CCD32BB4A18"/>
our readers may not have had an opportunity of pe∣rusing the volumes which have been written on that disorder, we shall here subjoin the following short ac∣account, which, we trust, will prove acceptable to our readers.</P>
<P>This disorder made its first appearance towards the latter end of July, in a lodging house in North Water∣street; and for a few weeks seemed entirely confined to that vicinity. Hence it was generally supposed to have been imported, and not generated in the city. This was the opinion of Doctors Currie, Cathrall, and many others. It was however combated by Dr. Ben∣jamin Rush, who asserts, that the contagion was genera∣ted from the stench of a cargo of damaged coffee, which had been landed near the same place where it first made its appearances, on a supposition that vegetable putri∣faction might produce such a disorder. For this opi∣nion he has given his reasons at large, in a volume of which he has lately published the second edition.</P>
<P>As the most eminent physicians have differed on this subject, we shall not offend by hazarding an opinion. To those who wish for particular information, we refer to their respective writings.</P>
<P>But from whatever fountain we trace this poisoned stream, it has destroyed the lives of many thousands— and many of those of the most distinguished worth. Its characteristic or leading symptoms were sudden debi∣lity in the voluntary powers, oppressive pain, giddiness, sense of fullness and distention in the vessels of the fore part of the head, and an oppressive weight about the heart and lungs, accompanied with great anguish and restlessness. During the month of August, the funerals amounted to upwards of three hundred. The disease had then reached the central streets of the city, and be∣gan to spread on all sides with the greatest rapidity. In September its malignance increased amazingly. Fear pervaded the stoutest heart; flight became general, and terror was depicted on every countenance. In this month 1400 more were added to the list of mortality. The contagion w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> still progressive, and towards the
<PB N="217" REF="028800_0223_0FDD4CD3C6A556F8"/>
end of the month, 90 and 100 died daily. Until the middle of October, this mighty destroyer went on with increasing havoc. From the 1st to the 17th, upwards of 1400 fell as victims to the tremendous malady. From the 17th to the 30th the mortality gradually decreased. In the whole month, however, the dead amounted to upwards of 2000—a dreadful number, if we consider that at this time near one half of the inhabitants had fled. Before the disorder became so terrible, the garlic which many chewed as a preventative, could be smelled at several yards distance; whilst others hoped to avoid in∣fection by a recourse to smelling bottles, handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. so that few indi∣viduals could be seen in the streets without one or other of these applied to his nostrils.</P>
<P>At last, however, experience had proved that these were inefficacious. A reliance on Divine Providence succeeded, and in the most terrible stage of the disorder the citizens discovered the most decent fortitude and the greatest resignation. These imaginary preventatives were therefore thrown aside.</P>
<P>From the 1st to the 7th of November, the mortality gradually decreased. On the 9th, the burials, which had hitherto been so exceedingly numerous, were redu∣ced to six. The fugitive citizens now began to return, and the streets resumed their wonted life and activity.</P>
<P>During this awful calamity, as has been already observed, terror and dismay generally pervaded the ci∣tizens. Some were found, however, who, at the risque of their own lives, were highly instrumental in saving the lives of their fellow creatures. An hospital was erected at Bushhill, at the distance of about one mile from the inhabited part of the city. Thither the in∣fected were sent in great numbers, but from? want of cleanliness and good order, the hospital and the grave were nearly the same thing.</P>
<P>A committee had been appointed to assist the guar∣dians of the poor in the legal discharge of their duty. It was one of the first objects of their care to remedy this evil. To search into the horrors of this dismal re∣ceptacle
<PB N="218" REF="028800_0224_0FDD4CD4AFCF26A8"/>
required the fortitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Howard.</HI> Men, however, stepped forth, and voluntarily undertook the arduous task. <HI>Stephen Girard,</HI> a native of France, a wealthy merchant of this city, and <HI>Peter Helm,</HI> a na∣tive of Philadelphia, both members of the committee, offered their assistance. Thanks to Heaven! their in∣valuable lives were preserved, and their generous la∣bours crowned with success. The poor now no longer considered Bushhill as the anti-chamber of the grave; but as a humane provision for the necessitous sick: and now many recovered.</P>
<P>So great a mortality of course left a great number of orphans in very destitute circumstances. Here again was a large field of labour open for the benevolent. The children were to be provided with nurses, provi∣sions, and other accommodations. The committee, how∣ever, to their former burthens undertook this, and pro∣cured the Loganian library, which was fitted up as an orphan-house, where about two hundred children were admitted, sixty of whom were infants.</P>
<P>The accumulating expences of this institution, with that of Bushhill and many others, obviously required considerable sums of money. Liberal contributions were sent from different quarters, amounting in the whole to 29,085 dollars.</P>
<P>During this melancholy period the city lost ten of her most valuable physicians, and most of the others were sick at different times. The number of deaths in all, amounted to about 5000.</P>
<P>To omit recording the names of those by whose be∣nevolent exertions, under Divine Providence, the city was saved from utter destruction, would be highly culpable in any annalist. To perpetuate the <HI>falsely</HI> ac∣quired fame of those who have made themselves con∣spicuous by butchering thousands of their fellow-crea∣tures, statues have been often erected; but what re∣wards, what statues, what language can sufficiently de∣scribe the merits of those, who, at the imminent dan∣ger of their own invaluable lives, have so eminently conduced to the safety of a great city?
