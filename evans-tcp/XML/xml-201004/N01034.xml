<HEAD>Some Remarks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Pamphlet signed part by John Talbot, and part by Daniel Leeds, called The Great Mystery of Fox-Craft.</HEAD>
<P>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce the foregoing book was writ, I have met with the above mentioned Pamphlet, and notwithstanding I am satisfied there is sufficient in the said Book to detect D: L's abuses toward us; yet I find freedom to say something further in relation to what they have said in the said Pamphlet, not only against some of our friends of Jersey-side, and of D: L▪s repeating old answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> matter against us, as also his poor shuffling remarks he hath made on my remarks on his this years Almanack; but also as to what they say by way of vilifying and reproaching our ancient friend G: F: by publishing two Letters under his name, which (without the least pretence of finding any thing in either of them inconsistent with a Gospel-Minister; yet because there may be shortness in spelling, Orthography, or the like) they have published in order to reproach both him and the way of Truth professed by us. But as it was no discredit to the Chri∣stian Religion in the primitive times before the Church's dege∣neracy, that the Promulgators and Witnesses thereof were gene∣rally Trades-men ignorant of the Learning then in vogue, and were called Coblers, Weavers, Combers of wooll, or the like, as hinted in the Preface; so no more is it now any Argument in truth against us, that some of the first Instruments in the work of Restoration in this day should be such. The Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor: 1, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> in his time, said, <HI>Not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any wise men after the flesh were called, but God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hosen the foolish things o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this world

to confound the wise.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which also well agrees the saying of "<HI>Franciscus Lambertus</HI> who saith, <Q>The sheep of Christ seeks nothing but the voice of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barclay's Apol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 304.</NOTE></Q> which he knoweth by the Holy Spirit wherewith he is filled, he regards not learning tongues or any outward thing, so as therefore to believe this or that to be the voice of Christ his true shepherd, he knoweth that there is need of no other thing but the testimony of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>Now, Admit our ancient friend George Fox had been altoge∣ther as poor a Speller, as these men would render him, which I greatly question, yet I have often considered that the meanness of his Schollarship or humane learning will more and more have a contrary effect upon the minds of people, as they come to favour and discern the things of the Spirit, rather than any ways answer the end for which these men have so industriously published these things against him; for I believe it will rather turn to the honour of the Truth we profess, than otherwise, that such a mean In∣strument in the world's esteem, as he was, should be enabled to discover and shake the very foundation of the Great Mystery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which had been so many hundred years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctting; and which many worthy Valiants, in the beginning of the Reforma∣tion, had struck at and batter'd much down: As also that he should with so small acquired parts, and without the help of hu∣mane Aid▪ which many others had, be made such an Instrument as to bring so many thousands out of her; and so as to buy of her merchandise no more, but bearing testimony against that and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying aside her Univers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty and men-made Ministry, her humane Traditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 4, 23.</NOTE> and the many invented ways of Worship that are in the world are brought in measure <HI>to worship the Fa∣ther in Spirit and in Truth</HI> meeting often together &amp; draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the spirits of their minds, and in the no∣thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> diligently upon the

<P><PB N="4" REF="001231_0004_0FB17CF88E0DDAC8"/>And I believe G: F's books were not impudently (as D: L: vilely asserts) but honestly and sincerely published in his Name for the good of mankind, and wherein he was short as a speller, it was but a shortness as to humane learn∣ing, which defect in him was easily supplied by another in tran∣scribing for the press; the two holy Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> e∣ven after the Holy Ghost was come upon them, whereby <HI>they spake in other tongues the wonderful works of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 2: 11.—4: 13</NOTE> were said <HI>to be ignorant and unlearned men:</HI> yet we see what two precious Epistles are in the Holy Bible, under <HI>Peter's</HI> Name. They say G: F: could not write the date of the year; and yet by what themselves have published, in that they say his last Will was written with his own hand; as al∣so in one of his two Letters now under consideration, it appears he could and did both write the date of the month and of the year too; for in the second Letter they bring him in to date it thus, <HI>the</HI> 11: <HI>month</HI> 1679: As also twi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that called his will thus <HI>the</HI> 11: <HI>month</HI> 1688. And for writing the word <HI>Sox</HI> instead of <HI>Fox</HI> for his name as they say, we know many ordinary scribes write the Letter [F] pretty near like as others do an [S] which they have been very ready to take by the wrong handle in that and in other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to render G: F: ridiculous. And can D: L: say or think in his conscience that G: F: never writ and published one Book Paper or Epistle, allowing for shortness in spelling &amp;c: which was easily help'd by another; and then if one book why not many? as he speaks of, and as (without doubt he did write; but if they will not allow him to have writ any, why then do they as in this very book of theirs, charge him for false Doctrine, and perverting the Scripture in his books?</P>
<P>I never saw the Book he speaks of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 5.</NOTE> called a Primer &amp;c: but surely his there proposing questions to the Doctors and Schollars (who were but men) proves not in the

No, the bent of his mind was on better matter, and the questions he might ask in that book migut be of good service in it's time, for any thing D: L: hath proved to the contrary, and we never understood, nor were we made to believe that G: F: ever so much as pretended that he had the gift of tongues by inspirati∣on, though he might understand by the help of humane interpre∣ters what his name in the Battle-Door was set to, even as such english men that understand neither hebrew nor greek, in which languages it's said the bible was writ; yet by the help of interpre∣ters they come both to learn, and often subscribe to citations out of what had therein been written by those holy men in those lan∣guages tho' withoutt he help of interpreters they understand it no more than D: L: or my self, who so often cite them, nor no more than G: F: might have done what his name was subscribed to: But this matter being further spoken to by our friend <HI>Joseph Wyeth</HI> in his <HI>Switch &amp;c:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 148</NOTE> who living at London might be better fitted to speak to the matter by having converse with ancient brethren who might better know the compiling of that book than any here can pretend to. I shall recite some of his words relating to it, as where, speaking of the Battle-Door, and having said there was a collection of scripture examples therein, he saith thus, <Q>This compound work is subscribed by <HI>G: F: John Stubbs</HI> &amp; <HI>Benjamin Furley:</HI> for scripture examples, it needed no greater learning than English to collect them, and that G: F: had; for the other Languages the other Subscribers were qualified; but the <HI>Snake</HI> is angry that G: F: is subscribed to this Polyglot. But if he had not been blinded by envy, he might have observed that these words in the handle of the Battle-Door The Light which Christ hath enlightened you withal believe in, that the Anointing within you you may know to teach you,
<PB N="6" REF="001231_0006_0FB17CFB72BE18D8"/>
which words are subscribed G: F: in the first page, and are of the same signification in the other Languages throughout all the Battle-Door's pages. "So that the words in the first page be∣ing G: F's, his fellow-labourers in that work, to do him justice, did, in their translating his words [mark his words] into o∣ther languages, still set his name to them.</Q> Here we see it was G: F's words, tho' translated, that (not himself but) his fellow labourers, to do him justice, set his name to; and that G: F: did not assume to himself the compiling of that book, but rather honestly attributed it to his other two fellow-labourers in it (who well understood the languages, and both whose names were sub∣scribed, in the very title-page of it, as well as G: <HI>F</HI>s) appears by what he hath left behind in his Journal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 245</NOTE> where he saith thus, whilst I was Prisoner in Lancaster-Castle, the book called the Battle-Door came forth which was written to shew that in all languages <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI> is the proper and usual form of speech to a single person and <HI>you</HI> to more than one; this was set forth in examples or instances taken out of the scriptures, and out of books of teaching in about thirty languages, <HI>John Stubbs</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Furley</HI> took great pains in compiling of it, which I put them upon; and some things I added to it: when it was fi∣nished, some of them were presented to the King and his Coun∣cil, to the bishops of Canterbury and London, and to the two U∣niversities one apiece, and many bought of them and the King said it was the proper language of all nations. It did so inform and convince people that few afterwards were so rigid towards us: Who tho' they would say it to God and Christ, would not endure to have it said to themselves &amp;c: Where observe that as it was G: F: that put those two friends, being linguists, upon that work; so there being examples and instances taken out of the scriptures, G: F: might well enough do tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part; but we see G: F: speaks very diminitively of what he did himself, saying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> [some things I added to it.]</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001231_0007_0FB17CFCF19DFB08"/>As for D: L's story of a Jew being hired to do the greatest part of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> as Joseph Wyeth saith, there was no occasion for a Jew to do that which John Stubbs and Benjamin Furley could and did do themselves: but as great an imitator of other mens words as D: L: is (of which I shall have occasion to speak anon) I cannot think who he hath imitated in this, for to the best of my remembrance I have seen from some of their books that a Jew had eighty pounds for such service; however the Snake says sixty and D: L: thirty, so that another such a jump, it's very probable, may bring it to it's own center, which is just to no∣thing at all.</P>
<P>As for his charging G: F: with wronging his Opponents books. And that he declared himsef to be equal with God. As to the first, we having not seen these books have sufficient reason not to trust his bare say-foes; howevever since D: L: hath so often plead∣ed an allowance for typographical errors in those few books he hath writ. How knows he, but G: F: who was so often in pri∣sons, or in travelling the countrey, when his books were print∣ing might have much more cause, through the multitudes of books which he published to make such plea as well as that there might be a failure in transcribers; however I never heard of, nor read that the persons concerned, as Authors of such books, did complain of such a thing: but if any did. How knows D: L: but that such mistakes were rectified long before G: F: died? however, when D: L: &amp;c: who are yet living, and capable, shall have cleared themselves from abundance of particular charges of falsifying, perverting and abusing our friends, their words &amp; writings as in this book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: is shewn, or else honestly to con∣fess they have wronged us. It will surely then be time enough to accuse those who have been so long dead; and indeed till then they may be rather justly esteemed accusers of the dead than such as are doing the reasonable part and duty of the living</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001231_0008_0FB17CFE80CDA0A0"/>And as for the second, I never saw that book yet, nor I be∣lieve, D: L: neither, wherein G: F: testified he was equal with God: but I have read that when G: F: was at Lancaster Assizes charged with saying he was equal with God, his answer was, that was not spoken by me; <HI>but he that sanctifieth &amp;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 2, 11,</NOTE> <HI>he that is sanctified is all of one &amp;c;</HI> which are plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cripture words, the three witnesses against him being so confound∣ed that one said the other can say it: and so many substantial peo∣ple of the countrey being there, and positively declaring that he neither spake those nor other words then charged against him, he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated in open Sessions.</P>
<P>And those words in <HI>page</HI> 8 <HI>of Sauls Errand</HI> so often cited and answered, admit it was printed true, which friends cannot own, G: F: speaks no more of himself than of all the saints of God throughout all ages of the world. It's true the words, as in that place printed▪ Import that he that hath the Spirit of God, <HI>is</HI> equal w<SUP>th</SUP> God, now [he that hath] should be out, <HI>as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> of the same book where it reads thus, where the same spirit <HI>is, it is</HI> equal with God: this further appears in the same page, in answer to the said accusation, to witt, that he said he was equal with God: said he, that was not so spoken, that G: F: was equal with God, but that the Father and the Son are one; and that Christ and the Holy Spirit are one: <HI>This is</HI> clear, was G: F s and our friends sense; and the above, as printed, hath been denyed upon all occasions.</P>
<P>And as for that called the Supper, and sprinkling of Infant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with God-Fathers and God-Mothers &amp;c: to be called Christ's or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inances is but begging the question, they having not been so pro∣ved to us: nor that all Christians since the Apostles days practic'd as they do. We read that Doctor <HI>Taylor</HI> saith, It's against the Analogy of the Doctrine of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lawsons Treatise of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ptisms p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 71 73.</NOTE> to baptize Infants; and that Christ gave no command for
<PB N="9" REF="001231_0009_0FB17D01A634EDF8"/>
the same; neither did he or his Apostles baptize any of them: and that the necessity of it was not determined in the Church till the Canon made by the Milevitan Council. And that Mede in his Diatribe on Tithes, saith that there was no such thing as sprink∣ling or Rantism used in the Apostles days, nor many ages after them [mark that] To sprinkle young or old, saith he, and call it baptism, is very incongruous, yea as improper as to call a horse a cow. Again, that in Augustines time they were become so dark as to conclude that children born, or unborn if quickned in the womb,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid: Lawson Page 62.</NOTE> were damned if they dy'd without baptism; from whence they agreed, if a quickned child in the mother's womb should be in danger to dye through the weakness of the mother or child, or hard labour, let them bless or pray for the child and strengthen the mother, and com∣mend the child to God, with desire to baptize it, and can protest saying the fault is not in them why that child is not baptized: And that this is equivalent to baptism.</P>
<P>And that about the year 816.<NOTE PLACE="marg">— 55.</NOTE> the Council under Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ride ordained that they should not pour wa∣ter on the heads of infants, but dip them in the font: Here it seems they were dipping again; tho' at this day again for sprink∣ling. Again, we read that in one Canon it was decreed that such Bishops or Priests as did not dip them three times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">— 74.</NOTE> should be deposed. And that another Coun∣cil taught that once dipping should suffice. Note, here was dip∣ping again; and great contradicting one another there was about it. Again, that some baptized themselves once a year. And from those words in Matthew 3.11. <HI>He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">—64.</NOTE> some there∣for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ned their children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">—62.</NOTE> some in their arms, and some in the face with the sign of the Cross with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hot iron:<NOTE PLACE="marg">—63.</NOTE> And that some baptized the dead and some the living for the dead.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001231_0010_0FB17D02E98B6BF8"/>
Much more might be said, but by what is said, I am very apt to think it would much puzzle D: L: to prove their practices of sprinkling Infants on the face to have been the practice of all Chri∣stians from the Apostles time to the time of G: F:, as he speaks of; the like may be said of that called the Supper; for as the same Author saith, It may be seen by such as trace the steps of Ecclesiastical writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">—78.</NOTE> that for about six hundred years together, the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> was given to Infants; some have ministred it to dead people: some give <HI>Bread only;</HI> some give <HI>Bread</HI> &amp; <HI>Wine;</HI> some were for <HI>Wine</HI> mixt with water; some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or taking it every day; some on all Sundays (so called); some once a year, some thrice a year: some say <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> are fi∣gures of <HI>Christ;</HI> some say they are, after consecration, the same <HI>Christ</HI> that was born of the <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI> Now they give it about dinner time, and yet they call it a <HI>Supper.</HI> Abundance more dif∣ferences about it, hath the said Author taken out of History; but this is enough to shew that their practice is not what hath been practised by all Christians from the Apostles days: and although it's very probable that after some manner or another there hath been something of it practised; so, we read, hath laying on of hands, washing of feet, and anointing with Oyl; which yet the <HI>Protestants</HI> do not call <HI>Sacraments</HI> nor <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Gospel: yet washing of feet &amp; anointing with Oyl especially the first was as expresly commanded at that time as the other.</P>
<P>D: L only says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 6.</NOTE> but proves not <HI>That our Womens meet∣ings are set up instead of Christ's Ordinances,</HI> they were agreed upon, and are kept up for real service in the Church; which service is so obvious that D: L: himself says in his <HI>Trumpet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 66.</NOTE> that <HI>they are of real service in deeds of Chari∣ty and Hospitality. D▪ L:</HI> pretends to a strange degree of know∣ledge by saying <HI>Never any right Quaker hath been known to dye with a</HI> Lord have mercy upon him <HI>in his mouth.</HI> Now; although at

<P>And we do trust to the merits of Christ, and his sufferings with∣out us, as well as what he effects in us.

<P>D: L's vile and senseless slighting of miracles, because said to be done by the power of God, makes nothing against G: F: and, If he can, let him disprove what G: F: hath said in his Journal concerning such miracles that God wrought, as instrumentally, by him; of which (not in the least to boast, or set up man) I shall give one instance from page 103; where, speaking of one <HI>Richard Myars</HI> that had been long lame of one of his arms, G: F: says, <HI>I was moved of the Lord to say unto him among all the peo∣ple, prophet Myars, stand upon thy legs (for he was sitting down) and he stood up and stretch'd out his arm that had been lame a long time and said Be it known to all people that this day I am healed; and he came after to Swarthmore meeting and there declared how the Lord had healed him.</HI> Now tho' D: L: may call this a <HI>vile and senseless miracle;</HI> that's but too much like the hardned <HI>Jews</HI> who (vilely slighting the miracles wrought by our Saviour him∣self) said <HI>He cast out Devils by Belzebnb ihe Prince of Devils:</HI> tho' the scriptures declare they were done by the mighty power of God; neither did it therefore follow that they were done without Christ who is both <HI>the Power and Wisdom of God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor: 10, 8.</NOTE></P>

<P>Behold Reader how beyond a scruple here are obvious instances of D: L's parrot-like-prating afrer (not the <HI>London Quakers,</HI> as he falsly charges me) but obviously after his brethren, the <HI>Lon∣don Quakers</HI> Adversaries, without the least intimating them to be theirs, possibly that he might have the praise of other mens a∣buses towards us.</P>
<P>And note, As we deny not G: K's above mentioned sense upon both those Scriptures; so I do not find G: F: of a contrary mind: for tho' he call'd the <HI>Resurrection</HI> that the Apostles preach'd, <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> that's according to what our Lord himself said in answer to <HI>Martha</HI> about raising the dead at the last day, he there told her that he was the <HI>Resurrection</HI> and the <HI>Life.</HI> And as the sense of this is, that he was the <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Cause</HI> of it; so I find it not any o∣therwise intended by G: F: &amp;c. <HI>See further the Answer above. .</HI></P>
<P N="11">11.

tho' I am satisfied that what I gave last year as our friends answer to that Doctor was sufficient to prove to all (but to such ill minds as had rather find us <HI>in the wrong than in the right</HI>) that we had the <HI>true faith in Christ as without us;</HI> yet lest any should take occasion at our silence herein, I find freedom furher to say, and prove that if he mean by a <HI>Christ without us now in heaven,</HI> that Christ is in heaven without us, as to his outward personal presence and glori∣fied body; and yet not so limited there, but that by his spiritual appearance <HI>he is also in us;</HI> it's our faith as well as theirs: for as he is the true <HI>Light</HI> which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world; he is within us: and in as much as he graciously pro∣mised to be with his always, even to the end of the world. <HI>Mat:</HI> 18: 20.

at large, to the Christian Faith, to suspect that we believ'd in two Christs, who notwithstanding is one Lord Jesus Christ as without us and within us, and as to the words <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> if you mean not as some render the Word (viz:) humane to be from the ground, but he hath the true and proper nature of man, then we believe according to your Question, that <HI>Christ is at this day and forever, truely and really a man in true and proper humane Nature,</HI> and as to his bodily presence without all other men, and that he will come as such at the last day, to Judge the quick and the dead, and that this of <HI>Christ's being without us, and coming to raise the dead at the last day,</HI> have been believed in, and testified to by our antient Friends, I could produce abundance of Instances, out of which at present I shall bring these following.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> near 50 years ago, in answer to one <HI>Bun∣yan,</HI> who it seems had writ that the <HI>Quakers deni'd the man Christ without them, and owned him no otherwise than as he is within:</HI> [an ancient mistake, or worse] It seems it was that because our friends were raised up to direct people (as John did) to the needful and and Ancient doctrine of <HI>the Light of Christ within, that all through it might believe.</HI> John 1: 7. And that as all <HI>walked in it they might have not only fellowship one with another;</HI> but also <HI>the blood of Christ to cleanse them from all Sin.</HI> 1 John 1: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. that therefore they denyed the man Christ as he is without. Now to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tify which mistake and abuse in <HI>Bunyan, Edward Burrough</HI> answers, <Q>Mayst thou not be ashamed to say we own Christ no other way than as he is within. We own him <HI>who was, is, and is to come</HI> who is within us and WITHOUT US.</Q> E: B's <HI>Works pa:</HI> 282. Again, <HI>Bunyan</HI> having said that we perswade Souls not to <HI>believe that that man that was Crucified and rose again &amp;c: shall so come again to judgment as he went away &amp;c: Edward Burrough</HI> Answers <Q>Oh how swiftly thy Tongue runs without fear, for in the Affirmative I further say, that that Christ Jesus that was Crucified, and rose
<PB N="29" REF="001231_0029_0FB17D244AE1B4A0"/>
again, shall come (as he went away) to judgment, and the dead shall be raised, and every man shall receive according to their deeds, and he shall sit to judge the Heathen round about, accor∣ding to <HI>Joel</HI> 3. Ibid 283.</Q></P>
<P>Again in pa: 285. saith he, <Q>there is not many Christs, but one Christ, which is not only within but without, not only without but within; But is all, and in all.</Q></P>
<P>Again, in Testimony for the man Christ Jesus, page 4. near 30 years ago, our Friends say, that <Q>the same man Christ Jesus that suffered, and was put to death in the flesh, and raised from the dead by the mighty power of God, ascended into heaven God's dwelling place.</Q> Again page 7, <Q>The same body that was put to death, was raised by the power of God, &amp; was a real Body, really seen both before and after the Resurrection, &amp; at the Ascention; as also we confess the same Christ not only to be still in being; but also Glorified, and his Body to be a Glorious. Heavenly and Spiritual Body: So that this man Christ did neither vanish nor perish in any thing that is essential to him, either as to his Spirit, Soul or body.</Q></P>
<P>Again, in <HI>Malice</HI> of the <HI>Indep: &amp;c: pa:</HI> 19 they [the Quakers] say, <Q>tho' Christ be God and Man, in a most Glorious Union and Power, yet the manhood is not the Deity, nor the Deity the manhood, yet inseparable in the man Christ who is Lord from Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Again, <HI>in Postscript page</HI> 23. G: W: saith, as hinted before, <Q>Christ did rise in the Bo∣dy wherein he suffered, and in the same ascended into the Hea∣vens: and it is so far Circumscribed or Encompassed in the Hea∣vens as it's capable of, &amp; as is proper to it; and tho' it be Spiri∣tual &amp; Glorious, yet a body &amp; therefore not in every place where God is, to be omnipresent is only proper to God and not to Bo∣dies. I deny to be the Quakers mind, that Christ's Body did va∣nish (so as to become Annihilated) at his Ascention, 'twas chang∣ed and more glorified, but not vanished.</Q> <HI>Reall Quaker by</HI> G: W: <HI>pa:</HI> 105.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="001231_0030_0FB17D2617291B90"/>Again, in the first impression of <HI>Robert Barclay's Apology page</HI> 88, He saith, <Q>We also deny the Error <HI>of Eutyches</HI> who made <HI>the Man∣hood of Christ to be swallowed up of the God-head:</HI> therefore as we believe <HI>he was true and real man,</HI> so we also believe that <HI>he conti∣nues so to be glorified in the heavens, in soul and body, by whom God will judge the world in the great and general day of Judgment.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Note, these above passages (except <HI>Edward Burrough's</HI>) with di∣vers more of the like tendency, were collected out of our friends ancient works by our <HI>quondam friend William Bradford</HI> in a small book called <HI>The Christian Faith of the people called Quakers &amp;c:</HI> who truly concludes his Collections thus,</P>

a <HI>Papist</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> who, tho' they are strong Asserters of <HI>Infants Baptism,</HI> yet esteemed it as <HI>a miracle to prove it by Scripture.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Pa:</HI> 15.

And as they testified to the One Spirit, One God, One Lord, One Father and One Body; and so they did to <HI>the One Baptism by which they were baptized into that One body,</HI> [as above] <HI>Ephes:</HI> 4: 5. And that this was not with water, seems clear, where the Apostle saith, <HI>For by One spirit</HI> [mark, by One Spirit] <HI>are we all baptized into one body.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12▪ 13. Now, that there is not a necessity for <HI>water-baptism</HI> besides this, seems also clear, because, as it's evident from the text, We are to have but <HI>One Lord, One Faith, One God &amp;:</HI> so it's as evident that we are to have but <HI>One Baptism;</HI> and as evident that this is to be by the Spirit, as above. And whereas some alledge that water and the spirit goes together to make up <HI>One Baptism;</HI> we find no ground in the scripture for that, for as some disciples were baptized with water, which had not so much as heard of, and some who had not received the Holy Ghost: so also some were baptized with the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> without being baptized with water. <HI>Acts</HI> 19: 3. 8: 12. &amp; 10: 14. Besides the texts above mention not a word of water, but say by One Spirit we are all baptized &amp;c: And we no where read that all the saints were baptized with water.</P>

and bigotted readers; for how can he but know that it is not our custom to read our own books in our meetings: no, not so much as <HI>Our Written General Testimony against Looseness and Vanity,</HI> is read in our weekly or usual Meetings of worship; and if it were our custom to read any there, it would doubtless be out of the Bible: but what if he had as idly provo∣ked me to tell him, if I durst, that in our Meetings we ever sing <HI>David's Psalms</HI> in metre, or read their Book of <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> (as well as the Bi∣ble) all which is so manifestly known, that we do not do, that I think the answer I gave before about the Bible, to wit, in asking where he finds any Gospel precept is broken by our not so reading them, would be, and is sufficient, and, so far as I find, more than he cares to answer; for he has thought fit to wave it, but as idly runs on and says, <HI>Note, Caleb Pusey knowing their own guiltiness in the case, instead of giving me a plain, ho∣nest answer, falls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul on the Snake, and then brings Certificates to prove that their school-boys read them in their schools.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> First, what Guilt can men lay under for omitting doing that which they find no necessity for, nor any Incumbent duty upon them to do: however, we can from our souls praise the Lord, in that we know it's meer labour lost (at least to us) in these men who have so many years strove to incense the people against us, as if we did not respect, nor own the scrip∣tures, whilst our own consciences, assure us that we esteem them the most choice, the most instructing &amp; the most edifying book in the whole world; and so as that it is from them, and not from our own books that our pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ers bring frequent citation in the Meetings; as also that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fre∣quently read in our families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to our mutual comfort and e∣dification.</P>
