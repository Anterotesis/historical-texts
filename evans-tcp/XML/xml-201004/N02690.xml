<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DR. COTTON MATHER,</HI> tho' Born and constantly Residing in this remote Corner of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> has yet for near these <HI>Forty</HI> Years made so rising &amp; great a Figure in the Learned World, as has attracted to Him while alive, the Eyes of many at the furthest Distance; and now deceased can't but raise a very general Wish to see the Series, and more especially the Do∣mestick part of so Distinguishing a <HI>LIFE</HI> exhibited. His printed Writings so full of Piety and various Erudition, his vast Correspondence, and the continual Reports of Travellers who had conversed with Him; had spread his Reputation into other Countries: And when about <HI>Fourteen</HI> Years ago I travelled abroad; I cou'd not but admire to what Extent his Fame had reached, and how inquisitive were Gentlemen of Letters to hear and know of the most particular and lively Manner both of his private Conversa∣tion and publick Performances among us.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> indeed, as a <HI>REVEREND FATHER</HI> with us has agreably observed <NOTE PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. COLMAN in his Funeral Sermon.</NOTE>. — <Q>His <HI>Printed Works</HI> will not convey to Posterity, nor give to Strangers a just Idea of the real Worth and great Learning of the Man. His <HI>Works</HI> will indeed inform all that read them, of his great Knowledge and singular Piety, his Zeal for <HI>GOD</HI> and Holiness and Truth, and his Desire of the Salvation of precious Souls: But it was <HI>CONVERSATION</HI> and Acquaintance with
<PB N="2" REF="003188_0008_0FF0135978ACFCC8"/>Him, in his familiar and occasional Discourses and private Communications, that discovered the vast Compass of his Knowledge, and the Pro∣jections of his Piety, more I have sometimes tho't than all his Pulpit Exercises. <HI>Here</HI> He excell'd, <HI>Here</HI> He shone; being exceedingly com∣municative, and bringing out of his Treasures things new and old without measure. <HI>Here</HI> it was seen how his Wit and Fancy, his Invention, his Quick∣ness of Tho't and ready Apprehension, were all consecrated to <HI>GOD,</HI> as well as his Heart, Will and Affections: And out of his Abundance within, his <HI>Lips</HI> overflowed, drop'd as the Honey∣comb, fed all that came near Him; and were as <HI>the choice Silver,</HI> for Richness and Brightness, Pleasure and Profit.</Q></P>
<P><HI>EVERY</HI> one who intimately knew the <HI>DOCTOR,</HI> will readily subscribe to this Description. By his learned Works and Correspondence those who lived at the greatest Distance might discover much of his superiour Light and Influence: But they cou'd discern these only by a more mediate and faint Reflection: They cou'd neither see nor well imagine that <HI>extraordinary Lustre</HI> of pious and use∣ful Literature, wherewith we were every Day entertained, surpriz'd and satisfied, who dwelt in the directer Rays, in the more immediate Vision.</P>
<P><HI>GREAT</HI> Abilities, and insatiable Thirst for all kinds of Knowledge, an extraordinary Quickness of Apprehension, Liveliness of Fancy, with a ready Invention and Active Spirit, seemed to be the chief Ingredients of his <HI>Natural Genius:</HI> And all these being sanctified in his early Days, indued with a divine Byass and turned to the noblest Objects; He became inflamed with the most ardent Desires to amass unto Himself from all sorts of Writings, an unbounded Treasure of curious and useful Learn∣ing, and to find out all imaginable Ways of im∣ploying it, for the Glory of <HI>GOD,</HI> the Good of <HI>Men,</HI> and the Advancement of <HI>his own</HI> Perfection: Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grew in Knowledge, He might increase <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Usefulness, and become a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> extensive Blessing.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003188_0009_0FF0135CFB5A1398"/>
<HI>So</HI> much <HI>Erudition,</HI> such high Degrees of <HI>Piety,</HI> and such an <HI>Active Life</HI> in doing Good, united in the same Person, are very rarely seen among the Sons of Men. By a transient Acquaintance with Him, one wou'd think, that being sanctified from the Birth, He had made the utmost Improvement of his Time in the <HI>PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE:</HI> But upon a further View of the Social Part of his Life, the continual Resort of Visitants, with his gentle and easy Entertainment of 'em at all Hours, and how He wou'd scarce let the Meanest or Youngest pass Him without Instruction; It seem'd as if almost all his Time were swallowed up with <HI>CONVERSATION:</HI> And yet, being let into a more intimate Discovery of his numberless and perpetual Contrivances and Labours to do Good in the World; one wou'd then be ready to con∣clude that he cou'd have no Time left for <HI>Either,</HI> but must have spent it all in <HI>ACTION.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HAVING</HI> made Himself an Early Master of the Learned Languages, One of the special <HI>ME∣THODS</HI> by which he so well improv'd his Time and acquir'd such a vast Extent of Science seem'd to be; that tho' for his Progress in Divine Li∣terature, He kept to the constant Study of the <HI>SACRED ORACLES</HI> in their inspired Originals, yet for <HI>Other Writings</HI> he cared not to trouble Himself with any but those that were likely to bring him something <HI>New,</HI> and so increase his Knowledge. In two or three Minutes turning thro' a Volumn, he cou'd easily tell whether it wou'd make Ad∣ditions to the Store of his Ideas. If it cou'd not, He quickly laid it by: If otherwise, he read it, passing over all those Parts which contained the things he had known before, perusing those Parts only that represented something <HI>Novel,</HI> which he Pencil'd as he went along, and at the End re∣duc'd the Substance to his <HI>Common Places,</HI> to be review'd at Leisure; and all this with wonderful Celerity. So short a Course he took to universal Science — that as he increased in Years, the less <HI>Time</HI> he had occasion to expend in running thro' an
<PB N="4" REF="003188_0010_0FF0135F6B4992D0"/>Author; till at length there were but few Books published that would take him <HI>much</HI> to read, and many that were celebrated for their various Learn∣ing he found had little in them but what he had been acquainted with before.</P>
<P><HI>NOR</HI> were his <HI>Common-Places</HI> the only Trea∣suries of his rich Ideas: They were but more Securities that He might not lose them: And He us'd to have them at command on the most sudden Incidents, and in common Conversation, which had therefore always something new, and was ever entertaining and instructive. By this means it was that He had the most agreable and effectual way of <HI>Reproving</HI> a Friend for what appear'd amiss, or of <HI>Exciting</HI> to a neglected Duty, that I ever met with. Instead of doing this directly, which might have been too Offensive, He wou'd rather bring some History or Observation in the Form of a pleasant <HI>Narrative,</HI> which He had ready at hand for all Occasions; and being extreamly suitable, wou'd leave his Friend to the most pungent Application.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> his glowing <HI>CHARITY</HI> and <HI>PIETY</HI> spread a further Lustre on his other Excellencies. His burning Zeal for <HI>GOD,</HI> and fervent Benevolence and Love for <HI>Men,</HI> were continually working in Him, imploying all his Talents, Tho'ts and Cares, by Night and Day, and Breaking forth into num∣berless Projections, and intense Indeavours, which wasted and consum'd his Life. He was an utter Enemy to religious Tyranny and Imposition: He was of very Catholick and Comprehensive Prin∣ciples: He never valued any particular Forms of Worship, unless they were of Divine Appointment: But it was the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Power,</HI> the <HI>Practice</HI> of the great Duties of Religion in the <HI>CHRISTIAN</HI> Institution that his Heart was set on: And this He was for Propagating, by convincing and moving Arguments, warm Perswasions, bright Examples, and by every winning Way that cou'd be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of, agreable to its truly primitive and noble Simplicity, and to Humane Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003188_0011_0FF0136208794020"/>
<HI>THE following Draughts</HI> will give the Publick an entertaining Specimen of his wonderful Improve∣ment of Time, and the various and surprizing Me∣thods He invented and pursued for the Advance∣ment of this vital Piety, both in Himself &amp; Others. Tho' deliberate in Speech, yet expeditious in Indi∣ting; and having the Pen of a ready Writer, that knew not how to faulter in its swift career; He continually preserved <HI>Records</HI> of the several Rules and Schemes He formed for his own Direction, and of his diurnal Prosecutions of them. He has by this means left a great Abundance of excellent Materials for his more private History: And the Accounts that follow being extracted chiefly from them, are also agreable to that Part of his Life which fell under the Observation of those who were acquainted with Him; and so nearly answered to these <HI>latent Rules</HI> now published, that we cou'd not but conclude He had them always in his Eye, tho' we had never seen them.</P>
<P><HI>HIS</HI> Son, the Compiler having these great Ad∣vantages, can have therefore no Occasion to invent any Additions to his Dear Father's History. He has rather aimed at <HI>Brevity,</HI> and to write as little upon every Head as possible. And indeed, if He had Published all that his Written Memorials would have enabled him, or that himself and others have been Witnesses of, He had not only swell'd the Volumn to too large a size for the present Age to bear, and thereby hurt its Usefulness; but he must have also given such a full Account of this extraordinary Person as would have exceeded the Belief of those who were Strangers to Him. The very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re Narra∣tion would have rather looked like the celebrated Life of <HI>CYRUS,</HI> and be disputed by Posterity whether it were design'd and drawn for a mixt Romance, or a real History.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> native Fondness of a <HI>filial Mind</HI> for a Father's Honour, may give Occasion for the Reader to suspect, in such a case as this, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Praise. But if some other Pens had been imploy'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>w∣ing the Description of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Character, I
<PB N="6" REF="003188_0012_0FF01364EF48C838"/>am very certain they would have given themselves a greater Liberty, as not being quite so cautious of exceeding as a natural Relative. And for other things, the ingenuous Reader will rather indulge the blooming Offspring of so Great a Parent; Especially, when the <HI>First Fruits</HI> he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>secrates to the Publick use, are so rich and salutary as these before us.</P>
<P><HI>BUT</HI> now, Methinks, I have need of some good <HI>Apology</HI> for my own Presumption to Preface the Life of such a Man, and recommend it to the World. I have none but this, — That the now Blessed <HI>Subject</HI> of it having been pleased to admit me into an happy Intimacy with Him, upon my Return to this my Native Country; I have been thereby too highly obliged — to deny the Desires of his <HI>Orphan Son,</HI> that I wou'd introduce him thus into the Publick view, and from my own Experience say so much as may in some measure move the curious Passenger, to turn aside and look into this reflecting Mir∣rour, and with pleasing Wonder contemplate the Great Original.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> to say no more, — I cannot think to wish a richer <HI>BLESSING</HI> in the present State of the Prophetick System; than that the <HI>GOD of the Spirits of all Flesh,</HI> would in my own dear Country, and every Other, raise up Numbers of such Ministers as this, and prosper this Superiour Example for the forming and animating of them: That they may burn and shine as He, and prepare the World for the most illustrious Appearance of the <HI>GREAT GOD</HI> our Saviour <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> that <HI>SUN of Righteousness,</HI> — the boundless and flowing Source of all the infinitely lower Excellence and fainter' Brightness we in every Place and Age, admire in Others.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is agreed by <HI>all,</HI> that <HI>Lives</HI> of eminent Men are very profitable, and that the <HI>Writing</HI> of them is of great Use to the World; especially if their <HI>Examples</HI> have bin very shining, and they have <HI>served</HI> their <HI>Generation according to the Divine Will;</HI> and therefore it is that so many <HI>Ancients</HI> and <HI>Moderns</HI> have endeavoured to transmit thro' Ages down to the latest Posterity the <HI>Lives</HI> &amp; Actions of their vertuous and excellent Friends.</P>
<P>IT has <HI>ever</HI> likewise bin allow'd proper for SONS to communicate to the World Accounts of their good and great PARENTS; to tell what they were, what they have done and suffer'd, how they tho't, and on what Accounts others are, have bin, or may be the better for them: I say, it has bin look'd upon as convenient for <HI>Sons</HI> thus to <HI>honour</HI> their <HI>Parents; who have bin honoured and highly favoured of Heaven;</HI> for were it otherwise▪ why are there so many Examples in <HI>later</HI>

<P>ENCOURAGED and animated by the many <HI>Sons of Ingenuity</HI> who have gone before me, and particularly by my own FATHER and GRANDFATHER, who have raised <HI>literal Monuments</HI> for their <HI>Parents;</HI> I shall now write <HI>the Life of,</HI> I might say with Sir HENRY WOTTON, <HI>the</HI> BEST <HI>of Fathers:</HI> I shall write it with an inviolable Fidelity and Truth; and I here declare that my Design in <HI>this</HI> Book, is chiefly to <HI>glorify</HI> JESUS CHRIST and to <HI>serve</HI> HIS <HI>Church: Ac ne</HI> Patris mei <HI>Famae parcerem, si ejus Laus cederet in CHRISTI opprobrium &amp; Corruptionem Evangelii &amp; Scandalum Ecclesiae</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Molinaei <HI>Examen</HI> Amyrald. <HI>advers.</HI> Spanhem <HI>l.</HI> 2. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I have no great Disposition to en∣quire into the <HI>remote Antiquities</HI> of his Family; nor indeed is it matter of much Conse∣quence that in our <HI>Coat of Arms,</HI> we bear <HI>Ermine,</HI> Or, <HI>A Fess,</HI> Wavy, Azure, three Lions rampant; or, for a Crest, on a wreath of our Colours a <HI>Lion Sedant,</HI> or on a Trunk of a Tree <HI>vert;</HI> — The <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> found in the Family was the most agreeable Pleasure to <HI>my Father,</HI> and yields the most satisfactory Reflection to me.</P>
<P N="2">2. Dr. <HI>INCREASE MATHER</HI> — whose Relation, as <HI>Pastor</HI> to the <HI>North Church</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> as <HI>President</HI> of <HI>Harvard College,</HI> whose <HI>printed
<PB N="4" REF="003188_0026_0FF0138E0A8E6098"/>Composures</HI> both <HI>Latin</HI> &amp; <HI>English,</HI> and whose <HI>Agency</HI> in the Courts of three Monarchs for his afflicted Country have rendred him universally known — was <HI>his Father.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. HIS <HI>Mother</HI> was MARIA, the Daughter of the Renowned Mr. JOHN COTTON; who was a Man of very exalted <HI>Piety</HI> and uncommon <HI>Learning:</HI> Out of Respect to this excellent Man, He was called COTTON.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2.</HI> His Education, his Eagerness and Progress in Learning; and early Favours confer'd on him.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HIS Education was at the free School in <HI>Boston</HI> under the Care, <HI>first</HI> of Mr. BENJA. THOMP∣SON, a Man of great Learning and Wit, who was well acquainted with <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, and a good Poet <HI>last</HI> under the famous Mr. EZEKIEL CHEEVER, who was a very learned, pious Man, and an excellent School-master. Under these two Masters he made a laudable Proficiency.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY <HI>twelve</HI> years of Age, he had composed many <HI>Latin</HI> Exercises, had conversed with TULLY, TE∣RENCE, OVID and VIRGIL, had gone thro' his <HI>Greek Testament,</HI> and entred upon ISOCRATES, HOMER and his <HI>Hebrew Grammar;</HI> and at that Age was admitted into <HI>College.</HI> The pious Dr. HOAR, who was then President, according to Custom, gave him this <HI>prophe∣tical</HI> Head for his initial Declamation,
<Q>Telemacho <HI>veniet, vivat modo, fortior Aetas.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. AFTER his entrance into <HI>College,</HI> he made as quick a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spatch as before; Mastering <HI>Hebrew</HI> per∣fectly digesting ALEXAN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. RICHARDSON'S Tables, which he transcribed; composing Systems of <HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> which were afterwards used by others; and, in a Word, describing the Circle of all the Aca∣demical Studies. Many are the Books which he then
<PB N="5" REF="003188_0027_0FF0138F97109250"/>read with ingenious Remarks, of which he kept an Account in his <HI>Diary.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN he took his first Degree, which was at the Age of <HI>Sixteen,</HI> Mr. OAKES the Praesident, in his Oration at the Commencement which I have read, thus expressed himself concerning this hopeful Youth,</P>
<P>— <HI>Alter vero</HI> COTTONUS MATHERUS <HI>nuncupatur. Quantum Nomen!

<P>YOU will find in the Course of this History, that this great Mans Sentiments were just, and his Expecta∣tions answered: So that I may now insert the true Character of him, when he made some Figure in the World; which I chuse to bring in here, because it has some Relation to Praesident OAKS'S Prophecy.</P>
<P>A Friend thus writes of him;</P>
<Q><L>"For <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> and an illustrious <HI>Fame,</HI></L>
<L>"Who would not look from such an om'nous Name;</L>
<L>"Where <HI>two great Names</HI> their Sanctuary take,</L>
<L>"And in a <HI>Third</HI> combin'd a <HI>greater</HI> make?</L></Q>
<P N="5">5. WHEN he was half a Year short of <HI>Nineteen,</HI> he proceeded <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> and received his Degree at the Hand of his Father who was then Prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent. The Thesis which he then maintained was, <HI>Puncta He∣braica sunt Originis Divinae:</HI> But he afterwards saw cause to change his Mind, and held the contrary Opi∣nion
<PB N="6" REF="003188_0028_0FF0139239EFB9E0"/>to the last. He tho't, with the great PRID<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>AUX and some others, that the <HI>Points</HI> were an Invention of the <HI>Mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rites;</HI> and, because he could read and per∣fectly understand <HI>Hebrew</HI> without them; he imagined there was no need of them, unless for the Ignorant, as the <HI>Jews</HI> without Question were, after the <HI>Baby∣lonish Captivity,</HI> when the <HI>Points</HI> were contrived for their Instruction.</P>
<P N="6">6. HE might well make a considerable Progress i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Learning, being in his earliest Years pretty <HI>healthy,</HI> having withal a <HI>great Capacity for Learning,</HI> and being blessed with that first step to Knowledge, a modest <HI>Inquisitiveness.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. AND, as it is observed there are <HI>very</HI> few who prove <HI>great Men</HI> unless they begin betimes, he was very desirous of following SENECA'S Advice, that is, <HI>to hasten and learn betimes, lest when old, he should be obliged to it</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Perg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; propera ne tibi accidat, ut Senex discas. <HI>Sen.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 77.</NOTE>: And indeed he betimes laid up a good Stock of Knowledge; like <HI>the busy Ant that adds to its heap, not ignorant or unaware of the future</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Horat.</HI> lib.

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Sect. 3.</HI> His Early Religion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is an excellent Maxim, That <HI>the best Gifts are vain unless Piety adorn them:</HI> And of this Mind was he, of whom I am writing, from his very Child∣hood.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003188_0029_0FF01394E6B685C0"/>
AND, altho' his Desire of Learning was very great and strong, and his Attainments were truly consider∣able, he was not more noted for these <HI>Gifts</HI> than for his early <HI>Piety</HI> and Religion.</P>
<P>FROM his earliest Days there were several <HI>good things found</HI> in him. When he began to speak almost, he began to <HI>pray,</HI> and practised this Duty constantly while he was a School-Boy; and, altho' he used no <HI>Forms</HI> in Secret, he composed some for his School-Fellows &amp; obliged them to pray. Before he could write notes of Sermons <HI>in public</HI> Assemblies, he commonly wrote what he remembred when he came home. — He read the <HI>Scriptures</HI> with so much <HI>Ardor</HI> and Assi∣duity, that <HI>fifteen Chapters</HI> a Day divided into three Exercises, and nothing less, would suffice him. — He would moreover reprove his Play-mates for their wicked Words and Practices.</P>
<P N="2">2. As he grew Elder, he joined himself to a <HI>Society of Young Men</HI> that met on the <HI>Sabbath Evening</HI> for Religious Ends and Purposes; and unto these Meet∣ings he ascribed his <HI>first</HI> Rise and Improvement in the Art of <HI>Speaking,</HI> of <HI>Praying,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. BY Reason of some Miscarriages into which he was surprizingly bro't, he was very Young put upon enquiring into his Estate; whether he were not an <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> if not a <HI>Cast-away?</HI> He found very frequent Returns of <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears;</HI> and therefore resolute∣ly and frequently renewed his <HI>Closure with</HI> JESUS CHRIST, as his <HI>only Relief</HI> against them. During <HI>this</HI> time, when he was languishing under the Sense of his Vileness, and thinking with himself, <HI>Will the</HI> LORD <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of one that has done and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in as I have?</HI> I say during this time, he tho't it proper to open his Bos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to his Father: Upon so doing his Father told him, <HI>There was no Sinner repenting and returning but</HI> CHRIST <HI>will accept of him: For</HI> (said he) <HI>observe it even among Men; there is a vile Sinner; a good Man beholds and abhors him: Yet if</HI> this <HI>Man ever
<PB N="8" REF="003188_0030_0FF013969AC79740"/>becomes a new Creature, the same good Person, not∣withstanding his former Vileness, will embrace him and take him to his Bosom; and this</HI> (continued he) <HI>is an Emblem and Effect of the Spirit of</HI> JESUS. — Wonderful was the Quickning these Words gave him: They influenced his Addresses to Heaven, in which he then had sweet and strong Intimations of the <HI>Di∣vine Favour.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN he was <HI>fifteen,</HI> he was much affected by reading Dr. HALL'S Treatise of <HI>Meditation,</HI> with his Proposals of proceeding <HI>Methodically</HI> in this <HI>great Duty of Christianity.</HI> Upon this, He read several <HI>other</HI> Books upon <HI>that</HI> Subject, and made many Essays at a <HI>Logical</HI> and regular Method for daily Me∣ditation, and proceeded so far that he wrote a Discourse upon that Subject, which at this tender Age found a good Consideration among several ingenious Friends. The Result of all was, that he finally pitched upon <HI>this Method.</HI> The Meditation consisted of two Parts: In the <HI>first,</HI> He proceeded more <HI>doctrinally,</HI> to <HI>instruct</HI> himself either with answering a <HI>Question,</HI> or with explaining a <HI>Scripture,</HI> or with considering the <HI>Causes, the Effects, the Adjuncts, the Opposites</HI> and <HI>Resem∣blances</HI> of the Thing that was his <HI>Theme.</HI> — In the <HI>second</HI> Part, he proceeded more <HI>practically</HI> to affect himself in three Steps; <HI>first,</HI> an <HI>Examination</HI> of him∣self; <HI>next,</HI> an <HI>Expostulation</HI> with himself and <HI>last,</HI> a <HI>Resolution</HI> in the Strength of Grace offered in the new Covenant. This happy way of <HI>preaching with and unto himself</HI> he was acquainted with betimes.</P>
<P N="5">5. AND before this, even at <HI>fourteen</HI> Years of Age, he began to keep <HI>Days of Fasting and Prayer</HI> alone in his Study, and in those Duties he made at first SCUDDER'S <HI>Christian's Daily Walk</HI> his Directory; &amp; But of his <HI>Fasts</HI> (together with his <HI>Thanksgiving</HI>) and his Devotions &amp; Methods in them, I treat largely in Chap. 6. whither I refer my Reader.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="9" REF="003188_0031_0FF01399B0302E80"/>
6. HAVING past his first <HI>Sixteen</HI> Years, he was tho't of Age eno' to join to a <HI>particular Church:</HI> He did so then accordingly, and renewed his <HI>Baptismal Vows</HI> and Covenant. By approaching to the LORD'S <HI>Table,</HI> he tho't himself obliged to be very particular in <HI>Self Examination.</HI> I will here transcribe one Instance of his <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> which he wrote when short of <HI>Seventeen.</HI></P>
<P>Setting my self upon the Work of <HI>Self-Exami∣nation,</HI> I find;</P>
<P N="1">1. Concerning my <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>I am convinced of the utter Insufficiency in my own <HI>Righteousness</HI> to procure my <HI>Salvation.</HI> I see my own <HI>Righteousness</HI> to be <HI>nothing</HI> in point of Acceptance with GOD. I see a woful <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> has acted me, <HI>Sluggishness</HI> and <HI>Selfishness</HI> hath at∣tended me, in the very best of all my Services.</P>
<P>I perceive now no other way for my <HI>Salvation,</HI> but only by the Lord JESUS CHRIST; <HI>Refuge</HI> sails elsewhere on every Hand.</P>
<P>I behold a <HI>Fulness</HI> &amp; a <HI>Beauty</HI> in JESUS CHRIST; HE is worth loving, worth prizing, worth <HI>follow∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>Such is my Desire to obtain an Interest in HIM, and make HIM the only Portion and Support of my Soul, that it is one of my greatest Griefs, to find my Heart so dull in going forth after HIM.</P>
<P N="2">2. Concerning my <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>I abhor <HI>Sin,</HI> because it is abhorred by GOD and contrary to HIM.</P>
<P>SIN is my <HI>heavy Burden: Death</HI> it self would be welcome to me to free me from such a <HI>Burden.</HI></P>
<P>I am <HI>heartily troubled</HI> for the Sin in my <HI>Heart,</HI> and that fountain of Corruption, <HI>the Plague of my Heart</HI> afflicts me.</P>
<P N="3">3. Concerning my <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>I long to see and know the <HI>Favour of GOD</HI> unto me; the sight of <HI>That</HI> would make all my Afflictions light.</P>
<P>I desire to be as active as may be in promoting the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD; and I seldome come into any
<PB N="10" REF="003188_0032_0FF0139CF8C24218"/>Company, without contriving, Whether I may not act or speak something for That in it, before I leave it.</P>
<P>I am sorry, that I <HI>love</HI> GOD no more.</P>
<P>The Saints, that have the Image of GOD, are those whom I value most.</P>
<P>A Mean Person with <HI>Grace</HI> is more amiable to me than another who is otherwise never so well qualified, but <HI>Graceless</HI> — There are some other of his <HI>Examinations,</HI> when in <HI>Younger</HI> Years and in <HI>advanced,</HI> which you will find in the 6th Chapter of this Book: I brought this one in here, as a Specimen of his early Sense of Religion.</P>
<P N="7">7. ANOTHER Thing, in which he demonstrated his <HI>early Piety,</HI> was his incessant <HI>Aspirations</HI> after Usefulness. He was always of MELANCTHON'S Mind, who said, <HI>Let who will abound and encrease in Riches, they may for all me; I look upon my Works as my Treasure</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Operibus sit Abundantia mea; Divitiis per me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> abundet quisquis volu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit.</NOTE>: He therefore sought <HI>all</HI> Occasions for <HI>doing Good.</HI></P>
<P>THE Maxim he went upon was this, that <HI>a</HI> Power <HI>and</HI> Opportunity <HI>to do Good not only gives a</HI> Right <HI>to the Doing of it, but also makes the Doing of it a</HI> Duty: A Maxim truly noble and divine both <HI>in it self,</HI> and in its <HI>Effects!</HI> And it is built upon those Words of our blessed Apostles, <HI>As we have Opportu∣nity, let us do Good unto all Men</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. VI. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING a Principle of <HI>Good-Will</HI> to Man deeply rooted in his Soul, he was <HI>very soon</HI> and very strongly desirous that it might grow and flourish, and that others might be the better for it.</P>
<P>HE first set himself to contrive what Good he might be able to do in his <HI>Father's Family,</HI> by instructing his Brethren and Sisters, and by exhorting the Ser∣vants.</P>
<P>HE anon proceeded to impose it as a Rule upon himself, never to come into any Company where it
<PB N="11" REF="003188_0033_0FF0139EB28ADBA8"/>might be proper for him to <HI>discourse,</HI> but he would, if possible, so order it that <HI>it</HI> might be serviceable to the Company; and, he saw the Fulfilment of that Promise, <HI>To him that has shall be given:</HI> For, upon his faithful Improvement of his Talents, He found his LORD and Master went on and multiplied his <HI>Op∣portunities,</HI> untill he came to serve whole <HI>Churches, Towns and Countries.</HI></P>
<P>FROM his own happy <HI>Experience</HI> therefore, when he was advanced in Age, he would often advise <HI>Young Men,</HI> to contrive and study as early as possible <HI>to do Good,</HI> to love it and to account it a noble Thing. While <HI>We</HI> and our <HI>Opportunities</HI> are but <HI>small,</HI> he would have us <HI>invent</HI> as many ways as we can to be serviceable: He would not have us impertinent, im∣modest or ostentatious in our Essays; but would have us with humility, and yet with Readiness, <HI>begin be∣times</HI> with our <HI>small Stock,</HI> and expect that, before we have done, GOD will do <HI>great things</HI> for us as well as by us. I have made some Digression; but the <HI>Usefulness</HI> of it will make Amends for it. I shall have Occasion hereafter more particularly to mention his <HI>great Usefulness</HI> and extensive Labors.</P>
<P N="8">8. HE very young tho't it his Duty to give unto <HI>the LORD of all,</HI> some <HI>part</HI> of small substance which was afforded him. Even from 14 he devoted a <HI>Tenth</HI> to our <HI>Melchizedek;</HI> and from his Childhood was very good, manly and generous.</P>
<P>I will mention but <HI>two Instances</HI> here of his good Spirit and <HI>Charity;</HI> (having Occasion e're long to give you some <HI>more</HI>) you will take them in his own Words;</P>
<Q><P>It may not be amiss now and then to mention a <HI>Remarkable Providence,</HI> and make some Remarks on the <HI>retaliating Dispensations</HI> of Heaven towards me. One thing, that I will observe, is what I met with in the <HI>twenty first</HI> Year of my Life. I can tell that the LORD has most notably, in many Instances
<PB N="12" REF="003188_0034_0FF013A1D61C2FD0"/>retaliated my Dutifulness unto my <HI>Father.</HI> Some of the Instances which I have taken Notice of may seem trivial, but yet the <HI>Retaliation</HI> I saw in 'em gave them a <HI>Relish.</HI></P>
<P>As now, I was Owner of a <HI>Watch,</HI> which I was fond of for the Variety of <HI>Motions</HI> in it. I saw my Father took a Fancy to <HI>it,</HI> and I made a Present of it unto him, with some Tho'ts that as it was but a peice of due Gratitude unto such a Parent, so I should not go without a Recompence. Quickly after this there came to me a Gentlewoman, from whom I had no Reason to expect so much as a Visit: But in her Visit, she, to my Surprize pray'd me to accept, as a Present from Her, a <HI>Watch,</HI> which was indeed preferible to that, with which I had parted. I resolved hereupon to stir up <HI>Duti∣fulness unto Parents</HI> in my self and others more than ever.</P>
<P>At another Time; I bought a <HI>Spanish Indian</HI> Servant, and bestowed him upon my Father. Some Years after this a Knight, whom I had laid under many Obligations, bestowed a <HI>Spanish Indian</HI> Ser∣vant upon <HI>me.</HI> Many more such Things I might mention; but I give these for a <HI>Taste.</HI></P></Q>

<P N="2">2. MR.

<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="003188_0035_0FF013A4D79A53F0"/>
3. UPON her Death his Family was in great Dark∣ness &amp; Disorder; which made him continually look to HIM <HI>from whom descends every good Gift,</HI> to <HI>heal the Breach</HI> GOD had made on his Family. His Petitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were <HI>abundantly</HI> granted. GOD showed him a Gen∣tlewoman a near Neighbour; whose Character I shall give as I have it from those who intimately knew her: — She was one, of finished <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Probity,</HI> and of an unspotted <HI>Reputation;</HI> one of <HI>good sense,</HI> and bless'd with a compleat <HI>Discretion</HI> in ordering an Household; one of singular <HI>good-Humour</HI> and incom∣parable Sweetness of Temper; one, with a very hand∣some engaging <HI>Countenance;</HI> and one <HI>honourably des∣cended</HI> &amp; related; 'Twas Mrs. ELIZABETH HUBBARD; who was the Daughter of Dr. JOHN CLARK. She had been a Widow <HI>four Years,</HI> when Dr. MATHER married her, which was <HI>Aug.</HI> 18. 1703. He rejoiced in her as <HI>having great spoil,</HI> and in finding her <HI>found great Favour of the LORD.</HI> They lived together in perfect Concent and Harmony <HI>ten</HI> Years: She died <HI>Nov,</HI> 8. 1713. with <HI>Willingness;</HI> the <HI>Fear</HI> of Death was extinguished in her; She committed her self into the Hands of her SAVIOUR, and in the same gracious Hands She left her children —She was much <HI>beloved</HI> and greatly <HI>lamented.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IN his <HI>fifty third</HI> Year, July 5. 1715. he was married to his <HI>third</HI> Wife. She is the Daughter of the renowned and very learned Mr. SAMUEL LEE: She was the Widow of Mr. GEORGE, a worthy Mer∣chant, when Dr. MATHER pay'd his Respects unto her in order to be Marry'd. She is a Lady of many and great Accomplishments, and is the <HI>Doctor's</HI> discon∣solate Widow.</P>
<P N="5">5. BY this last Gentlewoman, he had <HI>no</HI> Issue: by the <HI>two former</HI> Wives he had <HI>fifteen,</HI> only two of which are living; <HI>one</HI> a <HI>Daughter</HI> by the <HI>first</HI> Wife; the <HI>other,</HI> a SON by the <HI>second;</HI> he is the Writer.</P>
<P>BY his <HI>first</HI> Wife he had <HI>nine</HI> Children, of which but <HI>four</HI> arrived to Man's or Womans Estate. — The

<P>HIS dear Daughter ELIZABETH was <HI>one,</HI> who was <HI>married,</HI> and in <HI>two</HI> Years after died. She very much resembled her Mother in her <HI>various Vertues.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I must here mention it for the <HI>Glory of GOD,</HI> as well as the <HI>Honour of his Servant,</HI> that altho' He met with so <HI>many</HI> Bereavements in his Family, (as well as Sorrows on other Accounts) yet He never <HI>fainted in the Day of Adversity:</HI> He tho't his <HI>Sor∣rows</HI> should rather <HI>animate,</HI> than <HI>hinder,</HI> his nume∣rous <HI>Essays to do Good:</HI> And therefore when <HI>the Desires of his Eyes</HI> were <HI>taken away,</HI> and when He was <HI>deprived</HI> of his <HI>Children, none of these Things mov'd</HI> him so far as to hinder him from his Duty. No! He ever <HI>preach'd</HI> after their Deaths, every one of their Deaths, and <HI>printed the Sermons,</HI> that so <HI>others</HI> might be the better for <HI>his</HI> Griefs.— And indeed He always counted, it was in <HI>very Faithful∣ness that He was afflicted;</HI> for under <HI>every</HI> Calamity, He considered how his CHRIST might be glorified both by his <HI>Example</HI> and by useful <HI>Writings;</HI> and, in short, under the repeated <HI>Rains of Adversity,</HI> He grew more and more <HI>fruitful in every good Work.</HI></P>

7. I will conclude Sect. 4. with reciting some <HI>spe∣cial Rules,</HI> which He observed in the <HI>Education of his Children.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. HE pour'd out continual <HI>Prayers</HI> to the <HI>GOD of all Grace</HI> for <HI>them,</HI> That HE would be a <HI>Father</HI> to them, bestow HIS <HI>Son</HI> &amp; <HI>Grace</HI> upon them, <HI>guide them</HI> by his <HI>Counsel</HI> and bring them <HI>to Glory.</HI> And in this Action, He mention'd them <HI>distinctly,</HI> every one by <HI>Name,</HI> to the LORD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. HE began betimes to entertain them with de∣lightful <HI>Stories,</HI> especially <HI>Scriptural</HI> ones: And he would ever conclude with some <HI>Lesson of Piety;</HI> bidding them to learn that <HI>Lesson</HI> from the <HI>Story.</HI>
<P>AND thus every Day at the <HI>Table,</HI> He used him∣self to tell some entertaining <HI>Tale</HI> before he rose; and endeavor to make it useful to the <HI>Olive-Plants about the Table.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. WHEN his Children accidentally at any Time came in his way, it was his Custom to let fall some <HI>Sentence</HI> or other, that might be monitory or profitable to them.
<P>THIS Matter occasioned Labor, Study and Con∣trivance.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. HE betimes try'd to engage his Children in Ex∣ercises of <HI>Piety;</HI> and especially <HI>secret Prayer:</HI> For which he gave them very plain and brief Directions, and would suggest unto them the <HI>Petitions</HI> which he would have them make before the LORD, and which he would therefore explain to their Apprehen∣sion and Capacity. And he would often call upon Them; <HI>Child, Don't you forget every Day to go alone and pray as I have directed you.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. HE betimes endeavored to form in his Children a Temper of <HI>Benignity.</HI> He would put them upon doing <HI>Services</HI> &amp; <HI>Kindnesses</HI> for one another, and for other Children. He would <HI>applaud</HI> them when he saw them delight in it. He would <HI>upbraid</HI> all Aver∣sion
<PB N="16" REF="003188_0038_0FF013AC9D3CAE20"/>to it. He would Caution them exquisitely against all <HI>Revenges of Injuries,</HI> and would instruct them to return <HI>good</HI> Offices for <HI>Evil</HI> ones. He would show them, how they would by this <HI>Goodness</HI> become like the Good GOD and the blessed JESUS. He would let them discern he was not satisfied, except when they had a <HI>Sweetness of Temper</HI> shining in them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. AS soon as possible, he would make the Children learn to <HI>Write:</HI> And when they had the Use of the Pen, he would employ them in Writing out the most instructive and profitable Things he could invent for them. In this way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proposed to fill their Minds with <HI>excellent Things,</HI> which he hop'd would make a deep Impression upon their Minds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. HE incessantly endeavoured, that his Children might betimes be acted by Principles of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HE would first beget in them an high Opinion of their <HI>Father's Love</HI> to them, and of <HI>his</HI> being best <HI>able to judge,</HI> what shall be good for them.</P>
<P>THEN he would make them sensible, it was Folly for them to pretend to any <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> or <HI>Will</HI> of their own: They must resign all to <HI>Him,</HI> who would be sure to do what is <HI>best; his Word</HI> must be <HI>their Law.</HI></P>
<P>HE would cause them to understand, that it is an <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>shameful</HI> Thing <HI>to do amiss.</HI> He would aggravate this on all Occasions; and let them see how <HI>amiable</HI> they will render themselves by <HI>well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>first Chastisement</HI> which he would inflict for any ordinary Fault, was <HI>to let the Child see and hear him in an Astonishment,</HI> and hardly able to believe that the Child could do so <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se</HI> a Thing, but believing that they would never do it again.</P>
<P>HE would never come to give a Child a <HI>Blow,</HI> except in case of <HI>Obstinacy,</HI> or something that is very <HI>criminal.</HI></P>
<P>TO be <HI>chased for a while out of his Presence,</HI> he would make to be look'd upon as the sorest Punishment in his Family.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003188_0039_0FF013AEE3B8E5C0"/>
HE would with all possible Insinuations come upon them to gain this Point, That <HI>to learn all great Things, was the noblest Thing in the World.</HI> He was not fond of proposing <HI>Play</HI> to them as a <HI>Reward</HI> of any diligent Application, to learn what is good; lest they should think <HI>Diversion</HI> to be a better and nobler thing than <HI>Diligence.</HI> He would have them to pro∣pound and expect at this rate, <HI>I have done well; and now I will go to my Father, who will teach me some thing curious for it.</HI> He would have his Children account it a <HI>Privilege</HI> to be <HI>taught;</HI> and would some∣times manage the matter so, that <HI>Refusing to teach</HI> them something should be looked upon as a <HI>Punish∣ment.</HI> The Strain of his <HI>Threatnings</HI> therefore was; <HI>You shall not be allowed to read, or to write, or to learn such a thing, if you do not as I have bidden you.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Slavish</HI> way of <HI>Education,</HI> carried on with <HI>Raving</HI> &amp; <HI>Kicking</HI> &amp; <HI>Scourging</HI> (in <HI>Schools</HI> as well as <HI>Families</HI>) he looked upon as a dreadful Judgment of GOD on the World; he tho't the <HI>Practice</HI> abomi∣nable, and express'd a mortal Aversion to <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. THO' he found a vast, a wonderful Advantage in having his Children strongly byassed by the Prin∣ciples of <HI>Reason</HI> &amp; <HI>Honour;</HI> (which he observed that Children will feel and understand sooner than is com∣monly tho't for;) yet he would not neglect any Means and Endeavours to have <HI>higher Principles</HI> infused into them.</P>
<P>HE would therefore betimes <HI>awe</HI> them with the sense of the <HI>Eye of GOD</HI> upon them in the <HI>Ways</HI> which they <HI>take.</HI></P>
<P>HE would show them how they must <HI>love our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST; and how they must <HI>demonstrate</HI> it, by doing what their Parents require of them.</P>
<P>HE would often tell them of the <HI>good Angels,</HI> who love them, help them, guard them from Evil and do many good Offices for them; who likewise take a very diligent Notice of them, and ought not in any measure to be disobliged.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003188_0040_0FF013B148BE53B8"/>
HE would not say much to them of the <HI>evil Angels,</HI> because he would not have them entertain any fright∣ful Fancies about the Apparitions of <HI>Devils:</HI> But yet, he would briefly let them know, that there are <HI>Devils,</HI> who tempt them to Wickedness, who are glad when they do wickedly, and who may get leave of GOD to kill them for it.</P>
<P><HI>HEAVEN</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> he set before them clearly and faithfully, as the Consequences of their good or bad Behaviour here.</P>
<P N="9">9. WHEN the <HI>Children</HI> were <HI>capable</HI> of it, he would take them <HI>alone</HI> one by one; and after many affectionate, loving, strong <HI>Charges</HI> unto them, to fear GOD, to serve CHRIST and shun <HI>Sin;</HI> he would <HI>pray with them</HI> in his Study, and make them the Witnesses of the Agonies and Strong Cries, with which he, on their behalf, addressed the Throne of Grace.</P>
<P N="10">10. HE found much Benefit, by a particular Me∣thod as of <HI>Catechising</HI> the Children, so of carrying on the <HI>Repetition</HI> of the public Sermons unto them.</P>
<P>THE Answers of the <HI>Cathechism</HI> he would explain, with Abundance of brief <HI>Questions</HI> which make them to take in the whole meaning; and he found by this Way that they did so.</P>
<P>AND when the <HI>Sermons</HI> were to be <HI>repeated,</HI> he chose to put every <HI>Truth</HI> into a <HI>Question,</HI> to be An∣swered with <HI>Yes</HI> or <HI>No.</HI> In this way he would awaken the <HI>Attention</HI> as well as enlighten the <HI>Understand∣ing</HI> of his Children. And in this way he would take the Opportunity to ask, <HI>Do you desire such or such a Grace of God?</HI> And the like: And in this way, he had Opportunity to <HI>demand,</HI> and perhaps to <HI>obtain</HI> their <HI>early</HI> and frequent (and why not <HI>sincere?</HI>) <HI>Con∣sent</HI> unto the glorious Articles of the <HI>New-Covenant.</HI> He tho't the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> might fall upon them in this Action, and they might be seiz'd by HIM and held as HIS Temples thro' Eternal Ages. Blessed be GOD it was so with several of them.</P>

THUS I have recited the <HI>usual Methods,</HI> which Mr. MATHER observed in bringing up his Children: There are several other Things which were very praise worthy in his Carriage towards Them, but not of that Consequence with <HI>those</HI> I have written; and therefore I shall omit them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. 5.</HI> Miscellaneous Heads of private Conduct.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is a saying of GERSON'S, <HI>Qui bene vivit semper orat,</HI> He that lives well, <HI>prays without Cea∣sing.</HI> Mr. MATHER was one of those <HI>good Livers.</HI> He prayed always, at least, <HI>Six times a Day</HI> every Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE was a Gentleman of uncommon <HI>Dispatch</HI> and Activity, and yet was ever upon <HI>good Devices;</HI> so that, tho' he was <HI>constantly</HI> doing Service, he was <HI>ever</HI> enquiring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> actum dum quid superesset agendum.</NOTE> <HI>How he might do more Good?</HI></P>
<P>UPON DAVID'S <HI>Arm</HI> being <HI>able to break a Bow of Steel,</HI> AUSTIN'S Gloss is, that <HI>his Intention of good Works was indefatigable</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Intentio bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>um Operum in e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigabilis.</NOTE>. Altho' the <HI>literal</HI> was not; the <HI>Gloss</HI> was, fulfilled or found in Mr. MA∣THER.</P>
<P N="3">3. HIS <HI>Conversation</HI> he endeavour'd to render ex∣tremely entertaining, and it was so; for he produced such a variety of useful Discourse as made him welcome wherever there was any Relish for <HI>Learning, Polite∣ness</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity.</HI> He had the <HI>Je ne scay qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i</HI> of <HI>Conversation</HI> in Perfection. As for his <HI>Friends</HI> when in Company with him, when his <HI>Speech dropped up∣on them, after</HI> his <HI>Words; they spake not again; they wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed for</HI> him, <HI>as for the Rain, and they opened their Mouth wide as for the latter Rain: If</HI> he <HI>laughed on them, they believed it not.</HI> — And as for his <HI>Enemies,</HI>— even they confess'd his Excellent and
<PB N="20" REF="003188_0042_0FF013B621039190"/><HI>profitably pleasing</HI> Conversation, and in Society with him they were filled with <HI>silent Wonder.

<P>I shall here give you the <HI>Rules</HI> he observed in <HI>Conversing:</HI> They may be ranked under three Heads.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> HE would not affect <HI>Loquacity</HI> in his Dis∣courses, but, on the contrary, much <HI>Deliberation.</HI> The <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Discretion,</HI> accompanying such a Caution, he beheld as of greater Consequence to one in all Companies, than the Reputation of <HI>Wit;</HI> which by a greater <HI>Volubility</HI> of Tongue might easily be ac∣quired: And besides he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>membred <HI>in many Words there wants not Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HE would studiously decline to utter any thing, that he foresaw might be <HI>useless;</HI> and much more, every Thing that might be <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>sinful</HI> to be uttered. It was his Ambition every where to speak <HI>usefully,</HI> and say only those Things that one or other might be the <HI>wiser</HI> or <HI>better</HI> for.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> HE would, with all the nice <HI>Contrivance</HI> imaginable, improve Opportunities to say something or other, that might particularly set off <HI>some Glories</HI> of his LORD: He would every where contrive, if it were possible, to let fall some Sentence or other, by which high Tho'ts of CHRIST might be raised in those that heard Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. THINKING his <HI>Charitable Disbursements</HI> may most suitably be reserved for the next Chapter; I shall only here give you his <HI>private Sentiments of Chari∣tableness</HI> in his own Words;</P>
<P><Q>I am not unable with a little Study to write in <HI>seven Languages:</HI> I feast my self with the Sweets
<PB N="21" REF="003188_0043_0FF013B931D3A550"/>of all the <HI>Sciences</HI> which the more polite Part of Mankind ordinarily pretend unto. I am entertained with all kinds of <HI>Histories</HI> ancient and modern. I am no stranger to the Curiosities, which by all sorts of Learning are brought unto the curious. These <HI>Intellectual</HI> Pleasures are far beyond any <HI>Sensual</HI> ones.— Nevertheless, all this affords me not so much Delight as it does, to relieve the Dis∣tresses of any one poor mean miserable Neighbour; and much more, to do any extensive Service for the Redress of those Epidemical Miseries under which Mankind in general is languishing, and to advance the Kingdom of GOD in the World.</Q>— His pri∣vate Conduct was consonant with his Sentiments.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT was his watchful Desire and Study, never to maintain a <HI>personal Quarrel</HI> with any Man breath∣ing; but rather deny himself of his Humor, his Esteem, — or any Thing in the World. His Reason was, because no Man can manage a <HI>personal Quarrel</HI> without losing abundance of precious <HI>Time,</HI> which may be laid out infinitely better in the Service of CHRIST and his Church; besides a deal of inevitable <HI>Sin,</HI> which will insinuate it self into every <HI>personal Quarrel,</HI> by which one's internal Peace is broken. And further, since we have but a <HI>short Time</HI> to live in the World, He tho't it foolish to throw away any of it in Squabbles.</P>
<P N="6">6. CONSIDERING that for Men, even <HI>good Men</HI> to <HI>speak Evil</HI> one of another, is a very evil Thing—He tho't it would be a considerable Service to seek the Suppression of that Vice or any Vergencies to it in himself. Wherefore, after Flights to his JESUS for Strength to <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Perform,</HI> he made these Reso∣lutions.</P>
<P>THAT he would never speak <HI>falsely</HI> of any Man; and that if he spake <HI>Evil</HI> of any Man, it should be un∣der these Limitations and Regulations.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003188_0044_0FF013BACA528848"/>
<HI>First,</HI> THAT He would keep a <HI>Charity</HI> for the Per∣son of whom he spoke, wishing most heartily that <HI>all Good</HI> might be spoken of him; and he would from <HI>Charity</HI> speak <HI>to</HI> those when with them; — always thinking, <HI>Whether what</HI> he <HI>said might be for the Benefit of the Hearers?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IF He <HI>spoke</HI> what was <HI>Evil</HI> of any Per∣son, he would carefully watch over his Heart, that he did not utter it <HI>with Delight:</HI> He would manage it with Brevity and Aversion, as a very ungrateful Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> WHEN he must, or was obliged to <HI>speak</HI> what is <HI>Evil</HI> of any Man, if he knew of any <HI>Good</HI> that could be spoken of him, he would besure to balance the <HI>Evil</HI> with the mention of the <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> BEFORE he would <HI>speak Evil</HI> of a Man, he would consider whether he should not first <HI>speak</HI> to him; and, be it how it will, he would ordinarily, <HI>speak</HI> nothing, but what he should chearfully and contentedly say in the Hearing of the Man of whom he is talking.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>Fifthly,</HI> HE would aggravate nothing; and when he <HI>spoke</HI> of an <HI>Evil</HI> would not make it worse than it was.</P>
<P>THESE Rules he conscientiously observed.—Would to GOD, others were so careful as to take a due No∣tice of them!</P>
<P N="7">7. BECAUSE he did not love to be disturbed with <HI>tedious &amp; impertinent Visiters,</HI> and because his <HI>Friends (Amici Temporis Fures)</HI> might sometimes <HI>unseaso∣nably</HI> interrupt him, he wrote over his <HI>Study Door</HI> in Capitals, BE SHORT. And yet, let him be ever so busy when a Friend came to see him, he threw all by, He was <HI>perfectly easy,</HI> with pleasure communi∣cated the Observations he had lately met with, and was so very obliging that, altho' his Friends knew his hurry and great Business, they knew not how to leave Him.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="23" REF="003188_0045_0FF013BE20046170"/>
8. HE would rarely see a torn Leaf of a <HI>Bible</HI> in the Street, but would take it up with some particular Mark of Respect; not knowing but he might find some <HI>special Admonition.</HI> This he found a very <HI>pro∣fitable Practice.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. WHEN he <HI>rode</HI> abroad, He would most commonly take some young Gentleman with him, with whom he us'd to <HI>pray</HI> in private at their Lodging in Inns and Gentlemen's Houses, and unto whom he would endea∣vour in all possible ways to recommend <HI>Religion</HI> with the sweet and easy, but strong Charms of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. WHEN he went into any considerable Towns, he would for the most part beg <HI>Play-Days</HI> for the Boys; and, as a Condition for their being excused from School, he would enjoyn some <HI>Religious Task</HI> upon them.</P>
<P N="11">11. IF he heard that any Person had done him <HI>wrong</HI> in Word or Deed, he would seldom let him know that he had any Knowlege of it. The best Way he tho't was to <HI>forgive</HI> the wrong and bury it in <HI>Silence.</HI> For besides the Consideration due to the <HI>internal</HI> Advan∣tage reaped by such Christianity, there is <HI>this</HI> to be considered; Such is the <HI>Malignity</HI> in the most of Men, that they will <HI>hate</HI> you only because they know they have <HI>wronged</HI> you. They will, as far as they can, <HI>justify</HI> the wrong they have done you; and because they imagine you owe them a like <HI>wrong,</HI> they will bear a confirmed <HI>Spite</HI> to you. But he found the best way was <HI>Patience</HI> &amp; <HI>Silence;</HI> the Consequence of which has been, those who <HI>wronged</HI> him became his <HI>best Friends</HI> afterwards.</P>
<P N="12">12. I was going to relate some other <HI>Rules of Prac∣tice,</HI> of <HI>Prudence,</HI> and also to tell the Methods which he kept to, to <HI>preserve</HI> Health. But I remember he has described his Practice in those <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Me∣thods</HI> which he has mentioned at the End of his MA∣NU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>TIO A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> MINITSERIUM, to which I refer you</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="24" REF="003188_0046_0FF013BFF6F32B50"/>
13. I will conclude this Section and Chapter with an Account of <HI>two</HI> Books in which he was writing constantly.</P>
<P>THE first was his <HI>Quotidiana</HI> (as he call'd it) or <HI>Common-Place Book;</HI> in which he wrote along the remarkable Passages in any Author as he read him; but for fear he should be at a loss in finding any Pas∣sage, entred as he found it, he therefore number'd every Quotation, and at the End of his Book had an <HI>Index</HI> of <HI>Names, Things,</HI> &amp;c. so that he could presently have Recourse to the Sentences he wanted.</P>
<P>THE <HI>other</HI> Book was his <HI>Diary;</HI> in which he kept an Account of the most considerable Articles in which he had <HI>done</HI> his Duty, as well as those in which He had been <HI>deficient.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was a German one SEBASTIAN HEINRIC, who, not many Years ago, published for the Course of one Year whatever he <HI>did, read</HI> or <HI>saw</HI> for that Year.</P>
<P>MR. MATHER'S <HI>Diary</HI> was not such a <HI>Medley:</HI> No! There was none but <HI>important</HI> Matters entred into it. I will only take Notice of what I have col∣lected in observing <HI>one Day,</HI> and <HI>one Year</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I find in one of his Diaries an Account of the Trans∣actions of <HI>one Day</HI> as follows. <Q>This Day I per∣formed the Duties of my <HI>general Calling, instructed</HI> the Scholars under my Charge, underwent the Di∣version of <HI>Meals</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> with whom I was a considerable while; I <HI>made</HI> a long Sermon and <HI>preached</HI> it; I spent more than a little Time at the <HI>private Meeting,</HI> where I preached, and read over KNOX'S <HI>Historical Relation of the Island of</HI> Ceylon.</Q></P>
<P>IN the Observation of one whole Year of his Diary I took Notice of it,—</P>
<P>THAT he had preached above <HI>seventy two publick</HI> Sermons, and many <HI>private</HI> ones; perhaps near <HI>half</HI> as many.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003188_0047_0FF013C31B9858A8"/>
THAT not <HI>one Day</HI> passed without some Contri∣vance <HI>to do Good</HI> invented and registred; besides, I suppose, many <HI>never</HI> entred his Memorials.</P>
<P>THAT no <HI>one Day</HI> had passed without being able to say at Night, that <HI>some</HI> of his <HI>Revenues,</HI> tho' <HI>small,</HI> had been dealt out to pious Uses.</P>
<P>THAT he had <HI>prepared</HI> and <HI>published</HI> about four∣teen Books.</P>
<P>THAT he had kept <HI>sixty Fasts</HI> and <HI>twenty two</HI> Vigils.</P>
<P>A vast Variety of other Things I find recorded, which I shall omit: I bring this only as a Specimen of his <HI>Diary,</HI> how it was replenished and what Pains he took not to spend his Life in vain.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding He took such Care of spending his Time; yet, I often in his Books find him complaining of his <HI>Deficiencies,</HI> &amp;c. His first Years, He calls, <HI>Time so mispent as to render it un∣worthy to be called a</HI> Life; after he was grown in Years, he chose rather to say, such a <HI>Year of his Age</HI> than his Life: On one of his Books I read, such a <HI>Year of a forfeited Life;</HI> on another Year, of "<HI>my sinning against my precious</HI> REDEEMER": On ano∣ther, <HI>"Alas of my Unfruitfulness"!</HI> On a fourth, <HI>"A Year sweel'd away in Sin and Sloth".</HI> So that it might be said of Him, as was said of one that was very <HI>exact in his Walk,</HI> that his Life was <HI>perpe∣tua Censura,</HI> a continual Censure of himself.</P>
<P>ALTHO' he thus complains of himself: it would be happy for the <HI>greatest Part</HI> of the World, if they could give <HI>so good</HI> an Account of their Time and their Talents. <HI>Blessed is</HI> such a <HI>wise and faithful Servant, who when his</HI> LORD <HI>cometh, is found so doing.</HI></P>
<P>I might under this Chapter have given you a large Account of his <HI>Fasts,</HI> &amp;c. (which belong to this pri∣vate Character and Conduct) but I had rather re∣serve them, until the 6th Chapter obliges me to pro∣duce them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> His public Appearances and signal Services; in the Ministry, and in Concerns abstracted from. it.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. 1.</HI> His Ministry, Preparation for it, Hin∣drances of it, Introduction into it, and Methods in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THERE was one Thing, which, from his Cra∣dle, seem'd to have a dark and sad Aspect upon his Usefulness, and that was an <HI>uncommon Im∣pediment in his Speech.</HI> Several great Men were <HI>Stammerers</HI> before him, as a MOSES, a PAUL, a VIR∣GIL, and a BOYLE; and perhaps such great and good <HI>Companions in Adversity</HI> might render it less tedious and more tolerable.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHILE he was full of Concern for Relief from this troublesome Infirmity, that good old School-master Mr. CORLET gave him a Visit on purpose to advise Him; <HI>Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>I should be glad if you would oblige your self to a</HI> dilated Deliberation <HI>in speaking; for as in</HI> Singing <HI>there is no one who</HI> Stam∣mers, <HI>so by prolonging your</HI> Pronunciation <HI>you will get an Habit of speaking without Haesitation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. HERE I must inform my Reader, that because of his <HI>Stammering,</HI> he had almost, for some Time, laid aside the Tho'ts of being a <HI>Minister,</HI> and had with great Application studied <HI>Physic:</HI> But, upon prosecuting Mr. CORLET'S Advice, and having pro∣cured with Divine Help an <HI>happy Delivery,</HI> he was perswaded by his Friends to desert the Calling of a <HI>Phy∣sician;</HI> He did so: And after having studied <HI>Theology</HI> rationally and without Prejudice, he prepared for <HI>public Appearance:</HI> And because of the Calling he had relinquished, he did in his first Sermon consider our blessed SAVIOUR as the glorious <HI>Physician of
<PB N="27" REF="003188_0049_0FF013C8C5EF7090"/>Souls;</HI> chusing those words for his first Text in Luke IV. 18. <HI>He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. SERRARIUS thought, that none were called <HI>Rabbins,</HI> but such as were advanced in Years and had received Imposition of Hands and taught some Scholars. But altho' he was well read in this Sub∣ject, Mr. BASNA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E says, he was mistaken; for NACHMANIDES was stiled <HI>Rabbi</HI> at <HI>eighteen</HI> Years old, because he distinguished himself at this green Age, and began to teach.</P>
<P>Mr. MATHER deserved the Title of <HI>Rabbi</HI> at the the <HI>same</HI> Age; for he then distinguished himself and began to teach: For on <HI>Aug.</HI> 22. 1680. He <HI>first</HI> preached for his <HI>Grand-father</HI> at <HI>Dorchester,</HI> the Sab∣bath after for his <HI>Father</HI> at <HI>Boston,</HI> and the Sabbath succeeding was in his other Grand-father's Desk at <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE NORTH CHURCH at <HI>Boston</HI> having Time after Time taken notice of his <HI>great Gifts &amp; Abilities,</HI> on <HI>February</HI> 23d. 1680. gave an <HI>unanimous</HI> Invitation to him, to be an <HI>Assistant</HI> to his Father, and made him encouraging Offers for his Support.</P>
<P N="6">6. AFTER this, they had further Experience of his <HI>Ministerial Qualifications,</HI> and on Jan. 8. 1682. una∣nimously chose him for their <HI>Pastor,</HI> and desired his <HI>Ordination</HI> as such over them. He for some Time <HI>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> any Compliance with their <HI>repeated Calls, partly</HI> because they were not in extreme <HI>Want,</HI> ha∣ving his <HI>Father</HI> with them, who was hearty &amp; strong; and partly from a <HI>modest</HI> Opinion, and low Appre∣hension of himself and his Talents. CHRYSOSTOM says, that when he read that Text, Heb. XIII. 17. <HI>They watch for your Souls, as they that must give Account</HI> — the words caused <HI>an Earthquake within him, and produced an holy Trembling in his Soul.</HI> — The same words, with continued Reflections on them, made him <HI>fear and quake exceedingly,</HI> about entring into <HI>sacred Orders.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="28" REF="003188_0050_0FF013CB748B3F88"/>
7. NEVERTHELESS, at last, he was prevailed with to accept the sacred <HI>Burden; (Onus Angelicis Hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is formidandum!)</HI> and he was ordained <HI>May</HI> 13th 1684; when Mr. ALLEN, Mr. WILLARD and his FATHER <HI>imposed Hands</HI> on him; with the good Apostolical ELIOT, who gave him the <HI>Right Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Fellowship.</HI>—A truly primitive Ordination! which he never once in his Life scrupled the <HI>Validity</HI> of! After a curious Examination of most of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in the three first <HI>Centuries,</HI> he was verily perswaded that <HI>every one</HI> of them had been perverted and abu∣sed by designing Men to serve their own Ends, espe∣cially in the Instance of <HI>Ordination:</HI> And yet grant∣ing that not one of them had been debauched, and all of them were unanimous for <HI>Episcopal</HI> (or <HI>Diocesan</HI>) <HI>Ordination;</HI> I say granting this; yet he firmly be∣lieved that the <HI>scriptural Ordination</HI> (excepting the <HI>extraordinary</HI> Part) were such as <HI>his own;</HI> and ever looked upon the <HI>Choice of the People</HI> as agreable to the Rights of Mankind in general, of a <HI>Church</HI> in particular, consonant with the sacred Scriptures, and tho't <HI>no Ordination regular,</HI> unless <HI>Election of the People</HI> preceded it. I write not here my own Senti∣ments (I dare not pretend to write them,) but the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s.</P>
<P N="8">8. I shall here transcribe some Passages I find in his <HI>Diary,</HI> relating to the <HI>Cure of Pride,</HI> a Sin, which <HI>all</HI> are subject unto, and more especially <HI>Ministers,</HI> and which ought with Care and all Dili∣gence to be avoided.</P>
<Q><P>THE apprehension of the cursed PRIDE (the Sin of <HI>young Ministers</HI>) working in my Heart, fill'd me with inexpressible Bitterness and Confu∣sion before the LORD. In my <HI>early Youth,</HI> even when others of my Age are playing in the Streets, I preached unto very great Assemblies, and found strange Respects among the People of GOD. I <HI>fear'd</HI> (and Thanks be to GOD, that He ever struck me with such a <HI>Fear!</HI>) lest a <HI>Snare,</HI> and a <HI>Pit</HI> were by Satan prepared for such a <HI>Novice.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="003188_0051_0FF013CF3AA32390"/>I resolved therefore that I would <HI>set apart a Day,</HI> to <HI>humble</HI> my self before GOD for the PRIDE of my own Heart, and entreat that by HIS Grace I may be delivered from that <HI>Sin</HI> and from all the dreadful <HI>Wrath,</HI> to which I may be by that Sin exposed. I did so; And on this Day I examined my self by the Discoveries of <HI>Pride,</HI> which I found given in some judicious Discourses on that Subject. But I found especially two Respects, in which I fear'd I was guilty before GOD.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> MY <HI>Applauding</HI> of my self in my Tho'ts, when I have done any thing at all significant; <HI>pray'd</HI> or <HI>preach'd</HI> with <HI>Enlargements;</HI> answered a Question readily, presently, suitably. <HI>Proud Thot</HI>'s I saw fly-blow'd my best Performances.</P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> MY ambitious Affectation of <HI>Pre-eminence</HI> far above what could belong to my Age or worth, and above others that were far more deserving than my self.</P>
<P>FOR my <HI>Humiliation</HI> I then wrote these Consi∣derations:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WHAT is <HI>Pride</HI> but the very <HI>Image of Satan</HI> on the Soul? The more any Man has of CHRIST in him, the more <HI>humble</HI> will he be, more low and vile in his own Eyes and more empty of himself. When GOD renews HIS <HI>Image</HI> in us, He <HI>pulls down our proud Thot's.</HI> 'Tis true, <HI>Pride</HI> is a most <HI>natural Sin;</HI> but <HI>Grace</HI> would overcome that in a most special Manner and Measure. And then how little Grace have I? How unlike HIM, that could say, <HI>I am lowly?</HI> Let me for this Cause, <HI>ab∣hor my self in Dust and Ashes!</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. DO I not by <HI>Pride</HI> offend GOD? it is a Breach of HIS <HI>holy Command</HI> and He often de∣clares HIS <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of it. HIS holy SPIRIT is <HI>grieved</HI> by it: And how vehemently does the Scripture caution against all Tendencies unto it? Shall I bear to think of offending that GOD who
<PB N="30" REF="003188_0052_0FF013D100E92F50"/>has been a <HI>Father</HI> to me, and whom I have chosen and vow'd to love and serve as my GOD and Fa∣ther? Or that SPIRIT, upon the sweet Influences of which my Soul does live, <HI>Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. IS not <HI>Pride</HI> a most unreasonable <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Madness</HI> in me? Have I any just Occasion for <HI>glorying in my self?</HI> Do I any Thing <HI>singular?</HI> Am not I in most Attainments <HI>exceeded by most</HI> of my Calling and Standing? But, Oh, let this be a Dagger to my Heart! Have I not a <HI>cursed Na∣ture</HI> in me? And hath not the LORD heretofore left me unto some Follies, the sense of which should make me <HI>walk softly and my Days?</HI> LORD, <HI>I am viler than a Beast before Thee!</HI> Or, why should I seek <HI>Honor.</HI> 'Tis <HI>not seemly for</HI> such a <HI>Fool.</HI> Am I fit for <HI>Service?</HI> Or am I not rather <HI>unsavory Salt</HI> fit for Nothing but the Dunghil? What am I bet∣ter than <HI>the least of all Saints?</HI> If in any external Grandeurs I get above any of them, I am by them the more obnoxious to Temptation and Sin an Wrath▪ <HI>Ly then in the Dust, O my Soul, before GOD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. HOW <HI>dangerous,</HI> how <HI>destructive</HI> an Evil is this <HI>Pride?</HI> I provoke the GOD of Heaven, to take away every one of those <HI>Idols,</HI> which in my fond <HI>Pride,</HI> I dote upon; and if the LORD should now deprive me of my Capacities &amp; Opportunities, where am I but in an horrible Pit of <HI>Sorrows and Miseries?</HI> And let me remember, <HI>Pride</HI> will sooner than any Thing drive away the good SPI∣RIT of GOD from the Heart of a poor Creature. And if that should be my Fate, — <HI>LORD, Have Mercy on me!</HI>— What a Monument shall I be of thy direful Vengeance? O that the LORD would set home these Tho'ts for my Humiliation!</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>BUT what shall I do for the Cure of this Di∣sease?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003188_0053_0FF013D32AEFAB30"/>
IN the <HI>first</HI> and chief place, I would carry my distemper'd <HI>Heart</HI> unto the LORD JESUS, and put it into the Hands of that alsufficient <HI>Physician</HI> for HIM to ture it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I would be daily watchful against my <HI>Pride,</HI> &amp; continually keep an Eye upon my Heart, and check the <HI>least Beginnings</HI> and <HI>first Motions</HI> of this Corruption.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I would study much the <HI>Nature,</HI> the <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Aggravations</HI> of this <HI>Evil,</HI> and the Excel∣lency of the Grace contrary unto it.</P>
<P>IN one of my Supplications this Day, I thus ex∣press'd my self;</P>
<P>LORD, What shall I do for the Cure of this Disease my <HI>Pride?</HI> Blessed be thy Name, Thou hast shewed me a <HI>Way,</HI> and bid me <HI>walk</HI> in it. Have I not heard Thee saying to my sinful, <HI>stung</HI> and <HI>swoln</HI> Soul, <HI>Look unto ME and be saved!</HI> And therefore by thy Grace I will do it. I have done it and have found, and to this Day find, the Benefit of it. Why is it that I am not insensibly and incureably forever carried away <HI>Captive</HI> by the <HI>Lust</HI> with which I am now warring? 'Tis because I had put my Heart into the Hands of the faithful <HI>JESUS,</HI> and He it is that hath not suffered me to go on unconcerned about the Distemper of my Soul, but hath awakened me to seek Relief at HIS Hands, as I do this Day.—And now LORD, I come to HIM. He sees how I am <HI>labouring</HI> and <HI>heavy laden,</HI> but He has bid me <HI>come.</HI> Does He not call for <HI>my Heart?</HI> But what kind of <HI>Heart?</HI> It is not mention'd; but I am sure it is <HI>my Heart</HI> that is called for. Hence tho' my Heart be a <HI>proud Heart,</HI> yet as long as 'tis <HI>mine,</HI> I am to bring it. And, O LORD, I bring it because it is <HI>proud.</HI> But wherefore doth He call for it? Is it not that He may set up His <HI>Kingdom</HI> in it, fill it with His Graces, and manifest the power of His rich Goodness in it forever? Then let Him take my <HI>Heart</HI> and make it <HI>humble!</HI> It is easy with Him
<PB N="32" REF="003188_0054_0FF013D76F964FE0"/>to do it. Tho' I cannot overcome this <HI>Pride,</HI> He can: Oh, Let Him do it, I wait upon Him for it; I believe and am satisfied that He will do it; I have <HI>not sought THY Face in vain.</HI></P></Q>
<P>THESE Passages were wrote presenty aftr Mr. MATHER was setled in the Ministry, and therefore I bring them in here. The <HI>Section</HI> is indeed long; but, as I bless GOD, it has been very profitable to <HI>Me,</HI> I hope it will be acceptable to the <HI>pious Readers,</HI> espe∣cially of the <HI>sacred Order.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. I forgot to inform my Reader, That Mr. MA∣THER before He was Setled, kept many Days of <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> in order to it. And in one of those Days, having declared unto GOD, That not expecting any <HI>temporal Advantage,</HI> but rather <HI>Sor∣row</HI> and <HI>Sickness, Obloquy</HI> and many <HI>Persecutions,</HI> he would out of <HI>Love</HI> to HIM, undertake the Work before Him, <HI>feed</HI> a precious and numerous Flock of His: He then promised these Things to his LORD;</P>
<P>THAT He would endeavour to be a <HI>faithful Pas∣tor</HI> unto those over whom he should be placed.</P>
<P>THAT He would endeavour to be <HI>humble</HI> under whatever <HI>Enlargements</HI> should be vouchsafed unto him.</P>
<P>THAT if GOD should give him to build up HIS Church with an unspotted <HI>Reputation,</HI> he would endeavor to be contented with whatever State should be ordered for him in the World, tho' never so <HI>Poor</HI> and many other ways afflicted.</P>
<P N="10">10. He was constant and unwearied in his <HI>public Ministry,</HI> when he was entred into it.—Sometimes he has preached a Sermon for <HI>eleven Days</HI> successively. I need not at large write the <HI>Subjects of his Discour∣ses,</HI> his Method of <HI>Studying</HI> &amp; <HI>Preaching,</HI> since he has given so true a Description of them in his <HI>Manu∣ductio ad Ministerium.</HI> Pago 90, to 98 &amp; 102, to 105.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="33" REF="003188_0055_0FF013D9E17811C8"/>
11. BUT however I will give my Reader his <HI>Rules of Preaching,</HI> since they are short, since they were tho't upon when he was Young, others may be the better for them, and since this Book may come into their Hands who have not seen the Doctor's <HI>Manu∣ductio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> WHEN he was at a loss for a Text, he would make a Prayer to the Holy SPIRIT if CHRIST for HIS Direction and Assistance, as well to <HI>find</HI> a Text for him, as to <HI>handle it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> BEFORE he would undertake to go over any larger <HI>Portion</HI> or <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Bible,</HI> which might require many Sermon, he would with more Solemn Supplications address Heaven for necessary Succours.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> HE would weigh well the <HI>Original Tongues,</HI> as well as the usual and needful <HI>Commenta∣ries,</HI> for a Scripture before he would preach upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthy,</HI> IN pitching on <HI>Subjects</HI> to be discoursed in his public Ministry, especially more <HI>occasional</HI> ones, (for which he would reserve himself a Liberty in what Course soever he was) He would ever have some <HI>Design</HI> of suiting and serving the Edification of the Hearers;—ever—<HI>preach upon Design.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> HE would not <HI>stand long</HI> upon one Text ordinarily, but study an acceptable <HI>Variety:</HI> Nor would he use one way of treating <HI>every Text,</HI> but be various in his Methods.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> HE would be <HI>Scriptural</HI> in all his Exer∣cises; and ordinarily dismiss no Head, without some place of <HI>Scripture</HI> well adjusted to it.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> HE would always endeavour to <HI>fill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Hour well</HI> (and he did so) and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roud every Sermon as full of <HI>Matter</HI> as possible without <HI>Obscurity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> IN uttering his Sermons he was not for <HI>beginning too fast</HI> or <HI>too loud.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> HE did not make his <HI>Sentences</HI> or Periods too extended for the <HI>Writers</HI> to take them readily, or for the <HI>Hearers</HI> readily and easily to have the sence of them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="003188_0056_0FF013DC628C9EA8"/>
<HI>Tenthly,</HI> BEFORE he preach'd any Sermon he was desirous in a <HI>devout Meditation</HI> to work every <HI>Head</HI> of it upon his <HI>Heart,</HI> until he turned it into a proper Supplication.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventhly,</HI> HE would <HI>have</HI> and <HI>use</HI> Notes in Preaching; but yet would not so read his <HI>Notes,</HI> as in the least to take off the <HI>Vivacity</HI> of his <HI>Eye,</HI> his <HI>Voice,</HI> his whole <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Twelfthly,</HI> HE would have much of CHRIST in his <HI>Ministry;</HI> (CHRIST who is <HI>All!</HI>) As knowing that the Holy SPIRIT loves to glorify CHRIST; and if he did so too, he should have much of the HOLY SPIRIT with him in his Ministry.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteenthly,</HI> AND he was resolved to have great Care in his Ministry, lest at all he should confound <HI>the Methods of GRACE;</HI> upon a due <HI>Stating</HI> and <HI>Owning</HI> of which the Success of the Ministry does ex∣ceedingly depend.</P>
<P><HI>Fourteenthly,</HI> HE ordinarily would conclude his Sermons with some agreeable Text of Scripture, left with Life and Pungency to the Consideration of the Hearers; He tho't the Practice edifying.</P>
<P N="12">12. IN this Section I shall produce several <HI>Designs of Christianity,</HI> which he formed after his Investiture in the <HI>Sacred Calling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THE Apostle's Advice to a Young Minister, <HI>Exercise thy self to Godliness;</HI> he would think much upon it, read over some Discourses on the Subject, and as he went along, employ his particular Ejaculations upon every Article.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HAVING met with on Observation, That <HI>the want of Mortification in a Minister, procures a sad Unsuccessfulness to his Ministry;</HI> and that he might not be a deplorable Instance of it, he resolved imme∣diately to read over Dr. OWEN'S Treatise <HI>of Mortifica∣tion,</HI> (with others on the same Subject) and endea∣vour to follow and apply the Direction in it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> HE took a Catalogue of all the <HI>Commu∣nicants</HI> belonging to his Church; and in his <HI>Secret Prayers</HI> he resolved that he would go over the <HI>Cata∣logue</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="003188_0057_0FF013E0C671CBA8"/>by Parcels at a Time upon his Kness and Pray for the most <HI>suitable</HI> Blessings, he could think of, to be bestowed upon each Person by Name distinctly mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> IN perusing his Sermons before he Preach∣ed them, he resolved to make even that an Exercise of Devotion by endeavouring to fetch an agreeable <HI>Ejaculation</HI> but of every <HI>Head</HI> and every <HI>Text</HI> pro∣duced in them.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> HE had one Design which I will express in his own Words;</P>
<P><Q>IT will cost me very bitter Toyls and Pains; yet perhaps I may be serviceable in it: If I procure to my self an exact Account of those <HI>evil Humours,</HI> of which the place were I live at any time in under the observable Dominion; and whereas those Devils may be cast out by <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> set apart a Day still of secret <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> for each of them; to <HI>deprecate</HI> my own Guiltiness in them, and <HI>supplicate</HI> for such Effusions of the SPIRIT from on high, as my redress, remove and banish such Distempers from the place.</Q></P>
<P N="13">13. BUT he did not think these Things sufficient. He tho't it his Duty to <HI>visit the Families</HI> belonging to his Church; taking <HI>one,</HI> and sometimes <HI>two After∣noons</HI> in a Week for that Purpose.</P>
<P>HE sent befire-hand to the <HI>Families,</HI> that he in∣tended at such a time to <HI>visit</HI> them: And when he came, with as pungent and handsome Addresses, as possible, he would treat every Person particularly about their Eternal Interests.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> HE discoursed with the <HI>Elder</HI> People upon such Points as he tho't most proper for them.</P>
<P>AND especially charged them to maintain <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> obtain'd their Promises for it if they had neglected it, and <HI>prayed with them</HI> that he might show them <HI>how to pray,</HI> as well as to obtain their purposes for it.</P>
<P>HE likewise pressed upon them the Care of instruct∣ing their <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> in the Holy Religion we profess, and bringing them up for CHRIST.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="003188_0058_0FF013E367552338"/>
IT any that he should have spoke with, were absent, he frequently lest a Solemn <HI>Text</HI> or two of the Sacred Scripture, which he tho't most agreable for them; de∣siring some present would remember him to them, and from him recommend unto them that Oracle of GOD.</P>
<P>AND by the way at his <HI>Farewel</HI> to his Christian Friends and as a Conclusion of his Visit, he would contrive to commend unto them, some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suitable <HI>Text of Scripture</HI> of which they might think when he was gone from them.</P>
<P>BUT I return; He having done with the Parents, then called for the <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants;</HI> and put∣ting to them such <HI>Questions of the Catechism</HI> as he tho't fit, he would from the <HI>Answers</HI> make as lively Applications to them, as could be, for engaging them to the Fear of GOD.</P>
<P>HE frequently got <HI>Promises</HI> from them relating to <HI>Secret Prayer, Reading the Scriptures</HI> &amp; Obedience to their <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Masters.</HI></P>
<P>HE would often set before them the <HI>Proposals</HI> of the <HI>NewCovenant,</HI> after he had first laboured for their Conviction and Awakening: So they have full of Tears expressly declared their Consenting to, and Ac∣cepting of, the <HI>Proposals</HI> of <HI>the Covenant of Grace,</HI> which he distinctly set before them.</P>
<P>SOME of the <HI>lesser</HI> Folks' he would order to bring their <HI>Bibles</HI> to him, and read unto him from thence three or four Verses, to which he turned them: He would charm them to think on such Things, as he thence observed for their Admonition, and never for∣get those <HI>faithful sayings</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>HE would sometimes leave some awful <HI>Questions</HI> with them, which, he told them, they should not A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swer to him, but to <HI>themselves;</HI> As, <HI>What have I been doi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g ever since I came into the World about the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Errand upon which GOD sent me into the World?</HI> And <HI>If GOD should now call me out of the World, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t would become of me throughout Eternal Ages?</HI> And <HI>Have I ever yet by Faith carried a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng Soul unto the LORD JESUS for b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="003188_0059_0FF013E5AAC40368"/>
MANY other such Methods he took for the <HI>Win∣ning of Souls</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Discharge of his Ministry: And he enjoy'd a most wonderful Presence of GOD with him in this undertaking; and seldom left a <HI>Family</HI> without <HI>Tears</HI> dropt by several in it.</P>
<P>HE could seldom dispatch more than four or five Families in an Afternoon, and look'd on this Work as <HI>laborious</HI> as any in all his Ministry. He sat a great Value upon his <HI>Pastoral Visits;</HI> he not only <HI>did,</HI> but <HI>got Good</HI> in his Conversation with all sorts of Persons and tho't he never <HI>walk'd</HI> more <HI>in the SPIRIT</HI> than thus <HI>walking</HI> to his Flock to serve and seek their best Interest. I need not say any more about his <HI>Visits;</HI> his <HI>Memorial for Pastoral Visits</HI> is published, which will give you some Account of his Conduct in them.</P>
<P N="14">14. HIS <HI>Love</HI> to his <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Congrega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> was very flaming. To <HI>Exercise</HI> this Love — he was very desirous: and therefore he resolved to take the <HI>Bills,</HI> that are put up in our Congregation, for <HI>Prayer</HI> or <HI>Praise,</HI> and present the particular Cases there exhibited before the LORD in his Study, where he did more particularly implore the Grace of GOD for each of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m than he did or could in the Publick.</P>
<P>AND in pursuance of this Intention, (that is the Exercise of <HI>Love</HI>) he would ask himself before his <HI>Evening Prayers,</HI> Who hath in the foregoing Day shown me any <HI>Kindness?</HI> And he would then par∣ticularly supplicate the GOD of Heaven that he would bestow <HI>Spiritual and Eternal Favours</HI> on each of them that had particularly obliged him.</P>
<P N="15">15. HE would never let any of his Flock (or in∣deed any other) fairly come in his way, but he would let fall some <HI>Word</HI> or other, that he design'd and hop'd might prove serviceable some way to them.</P>
<P N="16">16. HE was continually scattering <HI>Books of Piety</HI> into their Hands; and often did it with this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vice <HI>Remember I am speaking to you all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="38" REF="003188_0060_0FF013E801201DD0"/>have this Book before you!</HI> And so there was not a Day in the Year in which he was not preaching to many of them. It is scarce imaginable how many good Books he disposed of: He has given away above a <HI>Thousand</HI> in a Year.</P>
<P N="17">17. IT was a Rule with him (and he beg'd of GOD to give him this <HI>Goodness, Patience</HI> &amp; <HI>Condescention</HI>) rather to suffer and bury in filence any manner of In∣juries &amp; Abuses from <HI>Absurd People,</HI> than to manage any Contention with any of them on any Occasion. Let the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Issue</HI> of the Controversy be what it will, he tho't he should gain more in regard of his greatest Interest by <HI>remitting</HI> his Right, than vigo∣rously <HI>pursuing</HI> it.</P>
<P>AND in the Services of Christianity, If he made any Difference between those that <HI>abused</HI> him, and those that <HI>valued</HI> him; it was in being more ready to serve the <HI>former</HI> than the <HI>latter.</HI></P>
<P>AND it was admirable to see how this Conduct would conquer the <HI>Follies &amp; Humors</HI> of <HI>unreasonable People.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. HE was ever desirous of entertaining an high Opinion of the <HI>personal Worth,</HI> Wisdom, Goodness and Accomplishments of many in the Flock, and the unspeakable Worth of the <HI>Souls</HI> of all of them, and by this Opinion to be quickned in his Studies for his Sermons, that they might be as <HI>able,</HI> and yet as <HI>use∣ful</HI> Composures as he could render them: And in∣deed they never had cause to complain of his Discour∣ses as jejun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unstudied.</P>
<P N="19">19. HE endeavoured with explicit Considerations that all the <HI>temporal Benefits</HI> he enjoy'd by the <HI>Salary</HI> which his People allow'd him, might be <HI>answered</HI> and vastly <HI>exceeded</HI> in the <HI>Spiritual Benefits</HI> of which his Ministry might make them the Partakers. Their Salary <HI>fed</HI> him: he would therefore prepare rich and heavenly and <HI>Angels Food</HI> for their Minds. It <HI>clothed</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="003188_0061_0FF013EA543A7F50"/>him; he would therefore do his best in showing them how to <HI>put on</HI> CHRIST, how to defend and adorn themselves with <HI>the Garments of Salvation.</HI> It <HI>warm∣ed</HI> him; and therefore he would endeavour to speak things unto them, that should make <HI>their Hearts burn within them</HI> and keep alive <HI>the Flame of Piety</HI> among them.</P>
<P N="20">20. I mentioned a little while ago his concern for his <HI>Church,</HI> in his <HI>Prayers</HI> — I must add this one Instance of his <HI>Love</HI> to them; That he would ever now and then set apart <HI>an whole Day,</HI> to <HI>supplicate</HI> the Favor of Heaven for them with strict <HI>Fasting.</HI> And on each such <HI>Fast,</HI> altho' near <HI>Four Hundred</HI> be∣longed unto his Church, he would pray for <HI>each</HI> of them by <HI>Name</HI> and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eech the <HI>most suitable</HI> Blessings for them.</P>
<P N="21">21. A Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> who was also Arch-Bishop of <HI>York</HI> said in his latter days, <Q>That in his Time he had passed thro' more Posts of Office and Honour than most Men in the World; but if he were sure that any one Soul had been by his Means converted unto GOD and CHRIST &amp; Holiness, it would give him unspeakable more Satisfac∣tion than all the Dignities that had been confer'd upon him.</Q> How happy then was Dr. MATHER, and how astonishing his Satisfaction! For, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had not been a <HI>Year a Minister</HI> before he had <HI>thirty Seals of his Ministry</HI> h. e. <HI>thirty</HI> who declared unto the Church <HI>He</HI> was the <HI>Cause</HI> under GOD of their <HI>Awake∣ning</HI> and <HI>Conversion;</HI> Many, Many, (GOD knows how many) have been by his Addresses to them either by <HI>Tongue</HI> or <HI>Pen</HI> since bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t home to GOD. — Many excellent Persons on their Death-Beds have often spoken unto him of what GOD had by his Ministry done to them: He has often seen them with Rapture triumphing over the Sting and Fear of Death, owning him as the Instrumental <HI>Saviour of their Souls from Death,</HI> confessing their <HI>Love</HI> to him &amp; assuring him of the <HI>Wondrous Glory</HI> waiting for him as well as them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2.</HI> His being concerned in Affairs abstracted from the <HI>Ministry;</HI> in Instruction of Scholars, in public Affairs of Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Accounts of his extensive serviceableness.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT may as well be bor't in, in this Place as any, That from <HI>Seventeen</HI> Years old he had for more than <HI>Seven Years</HI> together the Charge of <HI>Scholars,</HI> and some under his Tuition older than himself. These his <HI>Pupils</HI> he carried thro' the Parts of <HI>Academic</HI> Learning; and by instructing <HI>them</HI> confirmed himself in many Points of Literature. The Methods how he taught them the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue; How he heard their daily Recitation from the <HI>Originals</HI> of both Testaments; how he composed <HI>Catechisms</HI> of the Several <HI>Arts</HI> for them; how he directed their <HI>Decla∣mations</HI> and <HI>Disputes</HI> — might be related for some∣what of <HI>Curiosity</HI> in them. But I will hint one thing which may be grateful to those who have the Employ∣ment of Tutors. 'Tis this; He had many Contrivan∣ces that he might save the Souls of the <HI>Young Men</HI> who were committed to his Charge. He therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>des his Cares to check all Ebullitions of Sin in any of their <HI>Conversations,</HI> did successively use to send for them, <HI>one by one,</HI> into his Study, and there in the most moving, soft, obliging, &amp; yet most solemn &amp; lively manner discourse with them about their own <HI>everlast∣ing
<PB N="41" REF="003188_0063_0FF013EF29ED98C8"/>Interests;</HI> and he would then bestow some good Books on them to further the Work of GOD and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grace upon their Spirits: And moreover, he made it his <HI>Custom,</HI> that in every Recitation he would, from something or other occuring in it, make an Occas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to let fall some <HI>Sentence,</HI> which might have a tendency to promote <HI>the Fear of GOD</HI> in their Souls, which Practice did sometimes cause him to exert his Wit and Readiness; but it left a good Effect upon the Youths.</P>
<P>AND at length GOD gave him to see the Harvest of these his Labors; for several of these Young Men have proved able and holy Preachers, and among the most hopeful of the rising Generation. Mr. MATHER would often say, <HI>He</HI> would give all he was worth in the World for those Measures of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>sence</HI> which he saw in some that were once his <HI>Pupils.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I am here to mention his being concern'd in <HI>State Affairs</HI> (a difficult Section!) and I must assure my Reader that I am more at a loss what to do about it <HI>than any one</HI> in the whole Book; for should I <HI>omit</HI> the Section I must be a faulty Historian, to leave out what is so considerable; and if I should insert it at length, write the <HI>ill Managements</HI> of others and the Warmth with which the <HI>Doctor</HI> ever appeared for Truth and Honour as well as for his People &amp; Coun∣trey; I say, should I record these Things in all their Circumstances, it might provoke the Anger of a few Gentlemen and others. Now because it is my desire that this History may be very unexceptionable, I shall treat of one or two Things only, and write of the <HI>Rest</HI> in such a <HI>General Way</HI> as to give no one any Offence.</P>
<P>I find my self obliged to mention one or two Affairs, particularly in which Mr. MATHER was con∣sidered and distinguished himself.</P>
<P>MY Country is very sensible that in the Year 1688. (when one of the most wicked of Kings was on the
<PB N="42" REF="003188_0064_0FF013F178212BD0"/>British Throne) ANDROS and his Crew were very violent, illegal and arbitary in their Proceedings: I need not give any Narrative of their Managements here, because there has been an Account of them al∣ready given to the World.</P>
<P>WHILE these <HI>Roaring Lions</HI> and <HI>Ranging Bears</HI> were in the midst of their Ravages; It was in the Month of <HI>April</HI> when we had News by the Edges concerning a Descent made upon <HI>England</HI> by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for the Rescue of the Nations from <HI>Slavery</HI> and <HI>Popery;</HI> — Then a Strange Disposition entred in the Body of our People to assert our <HI>Liberties</HI> against the Arbitrary Rulers that were fleecing them: But it was much feared by the more sensible Gentlemen at <HI>Boston,</HI> that an unruly Company of Soldiers, who had newly deserted the Service in which they had bin employed for the Eastern War, by the gathering of their Friends to them to protect them from the Go∣vernor, who, they tho't, intended nothing but Ruine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, would make a great Stir &amp; produce a <HI>bloody Revol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion.</HI></P>
<P>AND therefore the principal Gentlemen in <HI>Boston</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Mr. MATHER to consult what was best to be done; and they all agreed, if possible, that they would extinguish all Essays in our People to an <HI>In∣surrection;</HI> but that if the Country People to the Northward by any violent Motions push'd on the Matter so far as to make a <HI>Revolution</HI> unavoidable, <HI>Then</HI> to prevent the Shedding of <HI>Blood</HI> by an ungo∣verned Multitude, some of the Gentlemen present would appear in the Head of what Action should be done; and a <HI>Declaration</HI> was prepared accordingly.</P>
<P>ON <HI>April</HI> 18. the People were so driving &amp; furious, that unheaded they began to seize our public Op∣pressors: upon which the Gentlemen aforesaid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound it necessary to appear, that by their Authority among the People the unhappy Tumults might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a little regulated. And thro' the Goodness of GOD, altho'
<PB N="43" REF="003188_0065_0FF013F4B38BA208"/>the whole Country were now in a most prodigious Ferment and Thousands of exasperated People in Arms were come into <HI>Boston,</HI> yet there was no manner of Outrage committed; only the <HI>public Robbers</HI> that had lorded it over Us were confined. 'Twas then Mr. MATHER appeared — He was the Instrument of preventing the Excesses into which <HI>the Wrath of Man</HI> is too ready to run; He came and like a NESTOR or ULISSES reasoned down the Passions of the Populace: had he lisped a Syllable for it, perhaps the People would by a sudden <HI>Council of War</HI> have try'd, judg'd and hang'd those ill Men, who would have treated him otherwise. Nevertheless he set himself both <HI>pub∣lickly</HI> &amp; <HI>privately</HI> to hinder the Peoples proceeding any further than to reserve the Criminals for the Justice of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>NOW the Persecution which was intended for Mr. MATHER was diverted; for on that very Day that he was to be committed to <HI>half a Years Imprisonment,</HI> those that would have <HI>wrong'd</HI> him were <HI>justly</HI> taken into Custody: And yet so generous was he as not only to expose his <HI>Name</HI> but even his <HI>Life</HI> unto the Rage of the Multitude for the saving of some that would have hurt him: Tho' he had no Thanks for his Ingenuity.</P>
<P>THE Spirit which acted him in these Matters is expressed in a Sermon he preach'd to the Convention of the Colony from 2 Chron. XV. 2. It was printed under the Title of, <HI>The Way to Prosperity.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days before this, the Inhabitants of <HI>Boston</HI> assembling together to chuse <HI>Representatives</HI> for that <HI>Convention</HI> &amp; vote <HI>Instructions</HI> for them, it was appre∣hended, that the different Persuasions of the People a∣bout the <HI>next Steps</HI> to be taken for our Settlement would have produced a Fury near to <HI>Bloodshed;</HI> and therefore Mr. MATHER was desired to be at their Meeting. The Meeting began with dangerous and horrible Paroxysms, which when he saw, he upon it made an affectionate and moving Speech to them, at which many fell into
<PB N="44" REF="003188_0066_0FF013F7C17DFD10"/>Tears and the whole Body of the People present im∣mediately united in the <HI>Methods of Peace</HI> Mr. MATHER proposed unto them.</P>
<P>UPON, Discoursing with him of these Affairs he has told me, that he always pressed <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Submission</HI> unto a legal Government, tho' he suffered from some tumultuous People, by doing so; and upon the whole, has asserted unto me his <HI>Innocency</HI> and Freedom from all <HI>known Iniquity</HI> in that Time, but declared his Resolution, from the View he had of the fickle Humors of the Populace that he would chuse to be concern'd with them as little as possible for the future. And so I dismiss this Head of the Re∣volution.</P>
<P N="3">3. MY Country is also acquainted with the Confu∣sions which they suffered by the <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> in it. I shall here say a little of <HI>that</HI> Time of Temptation; and write Mr. MATHER'S Sentiments, &amp; Actions.</P>
<P>THE Summer of the Year 1692. was a very dole∣ful Time unto the whole Country. — The Devils after a most pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternatural Manner by the dreadful Judgments of Heaven took a <HI>Bodily Possession</HI> of many People in our <HI>Salem,</HI> and Places adjacent; where the Houses of the poor People began to be filled with the Cries of Persons tormented by <HI>Evil Spirits.</HI> There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em'd to be an execrable <HI>Witchcraft</HI> in the Founda∣tion of this Wondrous Affliction; many Persons of diverse Characters being accused, apprehended, pro∣secuted upon the <HI>Visions</HI> of the Afflicted.</P>
<P>Mr. MATHER, for his Part, was always affraid of proceding to convict and condemn any. Person as a <HI>Confederate</HI> with afflicting <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mons</HI> upon so feeble an Evidence as a <HI>Spectral Representation.</HI> Accordingly he ever testified against it both <HI>publickly</HI> &amp; <HI>privately,</HI> and particularly, in his <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>Judges,</HI> he be∣sought them that they would by no means admit it; and when a considerable <HI>Assembly of Ministers</HI> gave
<PB N="45" REF="003188_0067_0FF013F94E6038B8"/>in their <HI>Advice</HI> about that Matter, he not only con∣cur'd with the Advice but He drew it up.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, on the other side, he saw in most of the <HI>Judges</HI> a charming Instance of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Patience;</HI> and as he knew their exemplary <HI>Piety,</HI> so he observed the <HI>Agony</HI> of Soul with which they sought the Direction of Heaven, above most other of our People who were enchanted into a raging, railing and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easonable Disposition. For this Cause, tho' Mr. MATHER could not allow the <HI>Principles</HI> some of the Judges had espoused; he could not however but speak honourably of their <HI>Persons</HI> on all Occasions; and his <HI>Compassion</HI> upon the sight of their <HI>Difficulties,</HI> which <HI>Compassion</HI> was raised by his Journeys to <HI>Salem</HI> the chief Seat of these Diabolical Vexations, caused him still to go to the Place. And merely for this Reason, some mad People in the Country (from whom one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two credulous Foreigners have dared to published the abusive Story) under a <HI>Fascination</HI> of their <HI>Spirits</HI> equal to what our <HI>Evergumens</HI> had upon their <HI>Bodies,</HI> reviled Mr. MATHER, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if he had bin the Doer of the hard Things that were done in the Prosecution of the <HI>Witchcraft.</HI></P>
<P>IN this <HI>evil Time</HI> Mr. MATHER offered at the Be∣ginning that if the <HI>possessed People</HI> might be scattered far asunder, he would singly provide for <HI>Six</HI> of them; and he with some others would see whether without more bitter Methods, <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> would not put an end unto these heavy Trials: But his Offer was not accepted.</P>
<P>HOWEVER for a great Part of the Summer he did almost every <HI>Week</HI> spend a Day by Himself in the Ex∣ercises of a secret FAST before the LORD. On these Days He cried unto GOD not only for his own Pre∣servation from the Malice and Power of <HI>the Evil An∣gels,</HI> but also for a <HI>good Issue</HI> of the Calamities in which he had permitted the <HI>Evil Angels</HI> to ensnare the miserable Country. He also besought the LORD
<PB N="46" REF="003188_0068_0FF013FBB2AED2B0"/>that he would enable him, prosper, direct and accept him in publishing such Testimonies for HIM as were proper, and would be serviceable unto HIS Interests on that Occasion.</P>
<P>AND that a right Use might be made of the pro∣digious Things which had been happening among us, he now composed &amp; published his Book entituled, <HI>The Wonders of the invisible World;</HI> which was re∣printed several Times in <HI>London:</HI> In the Preface he speaks of, <HI>"the heart-breaking Excercises."</HI> He went thro' in writing it.— There was a certain <HI>Dis∣believer of Witchcraft</HI> who wrote against <HI>this</HI> Book; but as the <HI>Man</HI> is dead, his Book died long before him.</P>
<P>BUT having spoken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no' of the more <HI>publick Witch∣craft;</HI> I think I will hale in here an Account of a <HI>Witchcraft</HI> happening in <HI>one private</HI> Family at <HI>Boston</HI> two or three Years before the <HI>general</HI> one.</P>
<P>'TWAS, I think, in the Year 1689. in the Winter, that several Children belonging to a pious Family at the South End of <HI>Boston</HI> were horribly <HI>bewitch'd and possess'd.</HI></P>
<P>MR. MATHAR tho't it would be for the Glory of GOD, if he not only <HI>pray'd</HI> with as well as for the tortured Children; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook an Account</HI> of the extraordinary Sympt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch attended them, with sufficient Attestations to confound the <HI>Sadducism</HI> and <HI>Atheism</HI> of a debauched Age.</P>
<P>HE therefore did these Things; and that He might more effectually do them, took one of the Sufferers to his own House. With a thousand strange Passages he found himself entertain'd; the chief of which he afterwards compiled into a just <HI>History</HI> which is pub∣lished under the Title of, <HI>Memorable Providences re∣lating to Witchcrafts and Possessions.</HI> The Things referring to <HI>Himself</HI> in these Papers, he reports as of a <HI>third Persons;</HI> and with the Story He also printed
<PB N="47" REF="003188_0069_0FF013FFC2EA8948"/>some Sermons preach'd on that Occasion.—Mr. BAX∣TER BAX∣TER often mentions this Book in his Book of the <HI>World of Spirits;</HI> and once in a Lecture at <HI>Pinners-Hall</HI> quoted it, with an Invitation unto People to purchase it; unto which end Mr. BAXTER procured the Reprinting of it at <HI>London</HI> with a kind Preface of his own to it.— <HI>This</HI> Book <HI>also</HI> has been flouted at and written against as well as the former; to men∣tion the Author's Names would be to show them too much respect; their Writings never had Credit eno' among any <HI>Men of Sense</HI> to deserve an Answer.</P>
<P>BUT I have now done with any Account of the <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> and Mr. MATHER'S Serviceableness in the <HI>Time</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I shall not come <HI>lower</HI> down, and show what a share the <HI>Doctor</HI> had in the Management of <HI>Civil Affairs,</HI> for fear of writing amiss.

<P N="4">4.

<P N="5">5. AND not only to our <HI>Rulers</HI> here; but unto <HI>those beyond Sea,</HI> who were concerned for our Wel∣fare, he manifested the same Freedom. There are se∣veral <HI>Persons of Quality;</HI> I suppose, now living that are conscious of the Doctor's Fidelity to his Country in writing on their behalf, when any <HI>Danger</HI> thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ned them, and when any Profit might acrue from his Writing.— But here too I am obliged to refrain from showing the Instances.</P>

<P>IN the Year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9. He projected a <HI>Society of Peace∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers,</HI> (like what we read of in <HI>Courland</HI>) whose Business it was to compose and prevent Differences, and divert Law-suits that might arise.</P>
<P>HE was one of the Commissioners for the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, whom he very much excited and spirited to the Doing of what has bin done here. He has some∣times got them to keep <HI>a Time of Prayer</HI> for that poor People; he preach'd a Sermon unto them, which is printed, and called <HI>India Christiana;</HI> and at the end of it there is an account of the Propagation of Religion as well in the <HI>Eastern</HI> as the <HI>Western-Indies.</HI> He belong'd to some other Societies in this Country which it is needless to write of.</P>
<P N="7">7. HE printed a <HI>Proposal for an Evangelical Trea∣sury;</HI> the Design of which was to advance a Fund for bearing the Expence of <HI>building Churches</HI> in desti∣tute Places, of distributing Books of Piety, of <HI>reliev∣ing poor Ministers</HI> &amp;c. The Doctor's Church and some others came into it, and 'tis to be ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d that so good a Practice will prevail more &amp; more.</P>
<P N="8">8. HE it was that bro't up the happy Method of <HI>Inoculation of the Small Pox</HI> among us; For 'twas he that first drew up an Account of this Method from TIMONIUS and PILARINUS out of the Tran∣sactions of the Royal Society, and recommended it to the Physicians of the Town.</P>
<P N="9">9. BUT he did not think it sufficient to be useful and active at home: he was for appearing publickly, and to the <HI>European</HI> World.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="003188_0071_0FF014052D1A4F78"/>
WHEN the <HI>Arian</HI> Controversy was warm, he could not refrain writing his <HI>American Sentiments</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>WHEN he saw the <HI>Protestant Interest</HI> run low, he must publish his <HI>Just Sentiments of the Protestant-Re∣ligion;</HI> and observing the cursed <HI>Persecution</HI> of the Protestants, he could not but print his <HI>Suspiria Vin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣torum,</HI> calling all, that might serve GOD with Freedom to pray for the oppressed People of GOD.</P>
<P N="10">10. THAT his <HI>Usefulness</HI> might reach beyond his Country, he learned the <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongues, and in his <HI>Forty fifth</HI> Year conquered <HI>Iroquois</HI> Indian; in each of which he has published Treatises for their Instruction.</P>
<P N="11">11. I have told you before something of his <HI>Charity.</HI> I may here take notice that he did not look upon a <HI>Seventh</HI> part of his Interest as eno' to be laid out in <HI>pious uses.</HI> — I need not tell my Reader how he procured the Benefactions of others; nor, since an Account of it is printed, need I acquaint you, how that he procured several Benefactions for the pious Foundations at <HI>Hall</HI> in the <HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> for which he has been publickly thanked.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE Ambition and Character of my Father's Life was <HI>Serviceableness.</HI> I shall conclude this Section and Chapter by telling you, that this Question <HI>What Good shall I do?</HI> was the Subject of his daily Tho'ts, even from his early Youth; and besides his Custom to set apart now and then a time to <HI>devise Good,</HI> he sel∣dom came into any Company without <HI>explicit Consi∣deration</HI> upon it, as I think I hinted before. It would indeed have been but a loss of time in him, and other∣wise useless to <HI>record</HI> Thousands of designs <HI>to do Good</HI> which he contrived in his Mind. But however he had a <HI>Method</HI> (and I will give you Recollec∣tion of it) which he observed in carrying on this <HI>manner of Life and Purposing,</HI> and which it will not be amiss for the World <HI>to know sully:</HI> And however
<PB N="50" REF="003188_0072_0FF01408D2753458"/>there may be some <HI>private</HI> Circumstances in what I write, yet, because the <HI>greatest Part</HI> have some Re∣ference to the public, I tho't it would be most pro∣per to insert his Method here, and to sum up this Chapter with it.</P>
<P>HE found that he could <HI>every Morning</HI> redeem the Time, while he was dressing himself; by taking his grand Question into Consideration, <HI>What Good may I do;</HI> Accordingly the Week was divided by him into as many <HI>Subjects of Consideration</HI> as there be <HI>Days</HI> in the Week; and the Result of his Tho'ts on each of them, he noted down as soon as he came into his Study in his Book of <HI>Hints for things to be spoke or done;</HI> but with such very <HI>brief Hints</HI> that they only served to preserve in his own Mind the Remembrance of his <HI>Purposes,</HI> untill he should have Opportunity to prosecute them.</P>
<P>I shall now recite in order his <HI>Morning</HI> Questions: but you may not imagine that I shall or can transcribe the Multitudes of <HI>Answers</HI> to each Question upon which he tho't. However to illustrate the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Process</HI> of his Operation upon it, I may insert a few <HI>brief Hints</HI> of his; from which we may form an <HI>Idea</HI> how to proceed upon such a Question, when <HI>We</HI> shall have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lying before us.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Question</HI> for the <HI>SABBATH Morning</HI> constantly was,</P>
<P><HI>WHAT shall I do as a</HI> Pastor <HI>of a Church for the Good of the Flock under my Charge?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he rank'd the People of the Flock into several <HI>Classes,</HI> distinctly considering, what they were, and what was to be done for them. He considered what <HI>Subjects</HI> were most seasonable and agreable to be handled in his <HI>Sermons;</HI> what would most suit, and best serve each of the <HI>Classes.</HI> He considered how he might make his <HI>Prayers</HI> as well as his <HI>Sermons</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="003188_0073_0FF0140A6A2D4590"/>leave good and strong Impressions on the Auditory. He entreated the Neighbours, associated for Exercised of Religion to send their Advice, what Things they might want or wish to hear treated on, and he accom∣modated them. He considered how to make his <HI>pub∣lick Ministry</HI> more lively; useful and acceptable. He considered, who were to be <HI>privately</HI> address'd with his <HI>Visits,</HI> and on what Intentions. He considered how he might visit the <HI>Schools</HI> unto the best Advan∣tage, particularly some <HI>Charity Schools;</HI> which he pro∣cured to be crected. He considered how he might carry on Evangelical Designs in concert with the <HI>Physicians</HI> in the Neighbourhood; whom he parti∣cularly desired; that they would let him know the Necessities of the Sick, if he were ignorant of them, and unto whom he communicated rich <HI>Notions</HI> and <HI>Medicines</HI> which in his Reading he had observed. Many more such Things he tho't upon.</P>
<P>ALTHO' I spoke something before of it; yet I will here again take particular Notice of one Thing a¦mong his <HI>Purposes</HI> and <HI>Practices,</HI> because it belongs to this Head of <HI>Considerations.</HI></P>
<P>HE obliged himself unto this Method in Studying a <HI>Sermon;</HI> on every <HI>Paragraph</HI> he made a <HI>Pause,</HI> and endeavoured with <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>Ejacu∣lations</HI> to Heaven, and with <HI>Self-Examinations</HI> to feel some holy Impressions of the <HI>Truths</HI> in that Para∣graph on his own Soul before he went any further. By means of this, the <HI>Seven Hours</HI> which he usually took to Pen a Sermon, prov'd so many <HI>Hours of De∣votion</HI> with Him. The Day in which he made a <HI>Ser∣mon,</HI> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t just such a Flavor on his Mind, as a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> us'd to do. When he came to <HI>Preach</HI> a Sermon so studied, he could do it with more <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Assurance;</HI> and he tho't the <HI>Truths</HI> thus pre∣pared would come with a more sensible Warmth and Life upon the Auditory.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed;</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="003188_0074_0FF0140CB2EF3EE0"/>
HIS <HI>Question</HI> for MONDAY Morning was, <HI>What shall I do in my</HI> Family, <HI>and for the Good of it?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he considered himself as an <HI>Husband,</HI> as a <HI>Father</HI> and as a <HI>Master.</HI> He would desire his <HI>Consort</HI> to think, what <HI>Proposals</HI> there were that She would make to him in her Service. He projected how his <HI>Prayers</HI> with her in his Study might be very much for her Service. He chose <HI>Books</HI> to be read by her that might be so. He contrived how to mention some <HI>instructive thing</HI> at going to Sleep, and Rising from it.</P>
<P>HE considered what <HI>Points of Education</HI> were still wanting in any of his <HI>Children,</HI> and pursued them in the most proper Ways. I told you before, he caused them to <HI>read</HI> and <HI>write</HI> such things as he found out for their best Advantage, and most suitable Entertain∣ment. He took each of them alone successively on the <HI>Saturday Evenings,</HI> and, having obtained a know∣ledge of their interior State, and the declared Resolu∣tions of their Souls for early Piety, he prayed with them. He caused some of them to compose <HI>Prayers</HI> and bring them to him in writing, that he might see their Temper and Progress in Religion. He obliged them to retire and ponder upon that Question, <HI>What should I wish to have done, if I were now a dying?</HI> And he would oblige them to report unto him their own Answer to the Question, of which he took Ad∣vantage to inculcate <HI>the Lessons of Godliness</HI> on them.</P>
<P>HE considered how to drop useful Admonitions on his <HI>Servants,</HI> as they were waiting on him; if the Action afforded any Time for it. He provided for their Instruction in every thing that he supposed might be for their Good. He put such <HI>Treatises</HI> into their Hands, as might be most profitable unto them in the Perusal. And as a sort of <HI>Crumbs</HI> falling from the Table of his <HI>Servants,</HI> he hired a Woman to keep <HI>a School,</HI> in which the Sable <HI>Sons of Ethiopia</HI> might every Evening learn to <HI>read</HI> and be taught their <HI>Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hism;</HI> and he himself bore the whole Expence of
<PB N="53" REF="003188_0075_0FF0140E4991BCD0"/>this <HI>Charity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> every Week paying the Mistress her Wages.</P>
<P>TWO were his <HI>Questions</HI> for TUESDAY Morning.</P>
<P>First, <HI>WHAT shall I do for my</HI> Relatives <HI>abroad?</HI> He took a <HI>Catalogue,</HI> which began with his <HI>Parents,</HI> and extended as far as the <HI>Children</HI> of his <HI>Cousin Ger∣mans.</HI> With the help of this <HI>Catalogue,</HI> he propoun∣ded that he would at proper times <HI>pray</HI> for each of them distinctly by Name. And that every Week he would single out one of them to consider, <HI>What Good may I do for them? Or in what Instance may they be the better for me?</HI> And, that he might address every one of them successively with faithful Admoniti∣ons, concerning their interior and eternal Interests, either by speaking to them personally, or by Writing to them, or by putting <HI>Books of Piety</HI> into their Hands; he propounded in this way to glorify our blessed SAVIOUR, and endeavour a Conformity to him, who even on his <HI>Cross</HI> took peculiar Care of one that was <HI>nearly related</HI> unto him. But he did not confine these Essays of Good unto his <HI>Relatives</HI> with∣in the Limits of his Catalogue: No! Heh made them reach as far as ever he could find out Opportunities. I need not any further explain this Article; only in one Instance.</P>
<P>WHEN his Father was become aged and in a con∣tinual and desirous Expectation of his call out of this World, tho' he was in a good State of Health, Strength and Vigor; he resolved that every Interview he had with him (which was almost every Day) should have in it something or other referring to the <HI>Heaven∣ly World,</HI> and assist their mutual Preparation for it▪ not knowing but <HI>it might be the last Time</HI> of their Conferring together in this.</P>
<P>BUT then Secondly; When such an Occasion for it has occur'd, he intermitted the former Question, and was as much concerned for <HI>his Enemies</HI> (whom GOD
<PB N="54" REF="003188_0076_0FF0141262EE17C8"/>made Instruments of Good unto him) <HI>as for his Re∣latives.</HI> He therefore enquired, <HI>What Good shall I do for my Personal</HI> Enemies; <HI>and how shall I over∣come Evil with Good?</HI></P>
<P>HIS publick Circumstances, he <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in the Discharge of his Duty, the Power of <HI>Satan</HI> over the Minds of many People &amp; the <HI>Envy</HI> of some ill Spirits at his Improvement and Acceptance procured him a Number of <HI>personal Enemies,</HI> or at least of such as treated him <HI>injuriously</HI> and <HI>abusively.</HI> Each of those Persons, as far as he could come to the Knowledge of them, he would set himself distinctly to consider, <HI>What good Offices he might do for them?</HI> Besure, ac∣cordingly, he <HI>pray'd</HI> for each of them by Name, and he would say, as I remember I have read in Mr. BUR∣KIT'S Life, <HI>some Persons had never had a share in my Prayers but for the</HI> Injuries <HI>they have done me</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>. And if he could perceive or invent any other Oppor∣tunity <HI>to do them Good,</HI> he wou'd do it; tho' many Times he has done it so, that they knew not whence it came. He was very fond of being able to say, <HI>That he knew not of any Person in the World, that had done</HI> him <HI>an ill Office, but</HI> he <HI>had done him a good one for it;</HI> and he left off the Alternation of this Question, till there might recur Opportunities for his Tho'ts upon it.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Question</HI> for WEDNESDAY Morning was, <HI>What shall I do for the</HI> Churches <HI>of the LORD, and the more general Interest of Religion in the World?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he considered, what <HI>Proposals</HI> to make un∣to other <HI>Ministers</HI> of his Acquaintance. He considered what <HI>Books</HI> he might compose &amp; publish to advance the Kingdom of his SAVIOUR. He considered, how to diffuse and disperse the <HI>Engines</HI> of Christian Know∣ledge and Vertue unto distant Places. He had his many <HI>Correspondencies,</HI> (of which more by and by)
<PB N="55" REF="003188_0077_0FF0141453078D30"/>but he would make them all subservient to his great Design. His endeavors to serve the <HI>general Interest of Religion,</HI> have reached unto each of the <HI>three King∣doms.</HI> They have extended unto several other Nati∣tions of <HI>Europe.</HI> They have visited all the <HI>English Plantations</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> and particularly every Town of the <HI>New-English</HI> Colonies, to which he was under special Obligations. <HI>Negroes</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians,</HI> Na∣tions of them as well as others, have been reached by them: Nor has the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation been unconsidered, nor the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches. Thus extensively generous was he, that I cannot help using Sir JOHN DENHAM's fine Character of his <HI>Thames</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Denham's <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll.</HI></NOTE>, and applying it unto the Doctor;</P>
<Q><L><HI>Thus</HI> Godlike his unwearied Bounty flows;</L>
<L>First loves to do, then loves the Good He does.</L>
<L>Nor are these Blessings to his Banks confin'd;</L>
<L>But free and common as the Sea and Wind.</L></Q>
<P>BUT I come to THURSDAY Morning: His <HI>Ques∣tion</HI> for that was, <HI>What Good may I do in the several</HI> Societies <HI>to which I am related?</HI></P>
<P>HE was related to above <HI>twenty</HI> Societies of a <HI>Re∣ligious</HI> Character and Intention. He must have his Times to <HI>Visit</HI> every one of these, always to do <HI>some∣thing</HI> in them and for them. He kept a watchful Eye over them, and would as far as possible make them become <HI>Engines of Good</HI> in the Land.</P>
<P>SOME of the <HI>Societies</HI> which he cherished as well as produced, were a sort of <HI>Reforming Societies,</HI> or <HI>So∣cieties for the Suppression of Disorders.</HI> I have spoke of them before, but will now give a more particular Account of them. The Doctor contrived and pro∣pos'd, that the other <HI>Societies of Religion</HI> to which he belong'd might, as far as they could, bear their part in pursuing the Design of <HI>these Reformers.</HI> But
<PB N="56" REF="003188_0078_0FF01416C197F968"/>for <HI>these,</HI> he endeavored generally every Week to be present with them; and ever to say somthing that might be both for their <HI>Direction</HI> and <HI>Encouragement.</HI> He drew up certain <HI>Points of Consideration,</HI> to be with due Pauses read in the <HI>Societi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> every time they met, for any to offer what Proposal he pleased upon any of the Points at the Reading of it. I will here transcribe those <HI>Points of Consideration;</HI> and we may easily guess, that they will supply one with Matters to which one may be, not a little, serviceable.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. IS there any <HI>remarkable Disorder</HI> in the Place, that requires our endeavor for the Suppression of it; and in what fair, likely way we may endeavor it?</P>
<P N="2">2. IS there any <HI>particular Person</HI> whose <HI>disor∣derly Behavior</HI> may be so scandalous &amp; so notorious that we may do well to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end unto the said Person our charitable <HI>Admonitions?</HI> Or are there any <HI>contending Persons</HI> whom we should admonish, to quench their <HI>Contentious.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IS there any <HI>special Service</HI> to the Interests of Religion, which we may conveniently disire our <HI>Ministers</HI> to take Notice of?</P>
<P N="4">4. IS there any thing we may do well to men∣tion unto the <HI>Justices</HI> for the further promoting <HI>good Order?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. IS there any sort of <HI>Officers</HI> among us to such a Degree unmindful of their Duty, that we may do well to mind them of it?</P>
<P N="6">6. CAN any further Methods be devised that <HI>Ig∣noran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and <HI>Wickedness</HI> may be chased from our People in general, and that <HI>Household Piety</HI> in particular may flourish among them?</P>
<P N="7">7. DOES there appear any Instance of <HI>Oppression</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Fraudulence</HI> in the Dealings of any sort of Peo∣ple, that may call for our Essays to get it rectified?</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="57" REF="003188_0079_0FF0141AAC83E790"/>
8. IS there any Matter to be humbly moved unto the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> to be enacted into a <HI>Law</HI> for public Benefit?</P>
<P N="9">9. DO we know of any Person languishing under sore and sad <HI>Affliction;</HI> and is there any thing we may do for the Succour of such an afflicted Neigh∣bour?</P>
<P N="10">10. HAS any Person any <HI>Proposal</HI> to make for our own <HI>further</HI> Advantage and Assistance, that we our selves may be in a probable and regular Capacity to pursue the <HI>Intentions</HI> before us?</P></Q>
<P>THUS I have taken the Liberty to recite their <HI>Points of Consideration,</HI> in hopes that the publishing of them may be very serviceable.</P>
<P>THE Doctor started numberless Things in the <HI>Societies</HI> upon these Points. Their <HI>Registers</HI> I sup∣pose, are fill'd with them. I shall only add, con∣cerning these <HI>Societies,</HI> that once a Year <HI>they</HI> used all to meet together in one Place, and have a <HI>Day of Prayer,</HI> in which they humbled themselves for doing so little Good; and besought the Pardon of their Un∣fruitfulness thro' the Blood of the great Sacrifice; and implored the Blessing of Heaven on the Essays to do Good which they had made, with the Counsel and Conduct of Heaven for their further Essays, and such Influences of Heaven as might bring about those <HI>Reformations,</HI> which it was not in their Power to ac∣complish. On these Days the Doctor, with another Minister carried on the Exercises.</P>
<P>THIS was his Method on <HI>Thursday</HI> Mornings: But at length he found it expedient to change his Question; and He made this his alternate one; <HI>Is there any particular Person able to do the Good, which lies out of my more immediate Reach, to whom I may offer some good Proposal?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="003188_0080_0FF0141CA34530A8"/>
BY answering this Question, he made his Conver∣sation still more useful. Thus he was often a Doer of Good <HI>at the Second Hand,</HI> and often had the Pleasure not to be known to have any hand at all in what was done.</P>
<P>THE Question for FRIDAY Morn was constantly this; <HI>What special Subjects of Affliction, and Objects of Compassion, may I take under my particular Care; and what shall I do for them?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he took a Catalogue of the <HI>Poor</HI> in his numerous Flock; but extended his Care further than so, wherever he saw any miserable. He minded also, who wanted <HI>Employment;</HI> He took notice of those under <HI>peculiar Exercises;</HI> and was very tho'tful, what Souls were by particular Addresses, to be <HI>pull'd as Brands out of the Burning,</HI> because of their being abandoned to flaming Wickedness? He constantly fingled out one or other of these to be on this Morn∣ing considered.</P>
<P>I shall only add one thing more upon this Head: He considered, that tho' the <HI>Wind</HI> will not fill the <HI>Hungry,</HI> yet it will turn the <HI>Mill,</HI> that will grind the <HI>Corn</HI> to fill the <HI>hungry.</HI> And therefore, having his <HI>List of Miserables</HI> commonly with him, he very often in Company would make it a Subject of the Conversation, <HI>What shall be done for such or such an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne in my List?</HI> And thus, besides the innumerable Kindnesses which he had himself more immediately done for them, he procured multitudes of Kindnesses from others; and the first Spring in the Motion has been unknown to them. Very much of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI> of his Life was in such things as these. And I may tell my Reader, what I gave him to understand before, that he did <HI>not</HI> ordinarily let <HI>one Day in a Year</HI> pass him, without something expended on <HI>pious Uses,</HI> besides his other continual <HI>Kindnesses</HI> to afflic∣ted People.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="003188_0081_0FF0141E6763FC00"/>
AND at length I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trive to <HI>his Question</HI> for SATUR∣DAY Morning. I may well call it <HI>his,</HI> for it was about the Concerns of <HI>his own Soul.</HI></P>
<P>THE Question was; <HI>What more have I to do for the Interest of GOD in my own Heart and Life?</HI></P>
<P>I shall a little here illustrate his way of Thinking upon this Question.</P>
<P>HE would set himself to consider the more <HI>special Sins of his Youth;</HI> and what more <HI>special Service</HI> he should do for the Kingdom of GOD, in the greatest Contrariety to his <HI>former Miscarriages.</HI></P>
<P>HE set himself then to consider the <HI>Reproaches</HI> he had met with; and upon this, what <HI>Services</HI> he should be awakened by them to do for the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>HE considered, how he was favoured with surpri∣zing and uncommon Opportunities to publish many <HI>Books of Piety;</HI> and of what vast Concernment it was, that he should take effectual Care <HI>his own Books</HI> did not prove at last his Condemnation, by his failing in those <HI>Attainments in Religion,</HI> which he commen∣ded unto others. Wherefore (with Prayers to be de∣livered from this) he would sometimes on a Lord's Day Evening read over his own <HI>Books of Devotion,</HI> and work them over again upon his Heart, until his own Soul was exquisitely conformed unto them.</P>
<P>HE resolved, that whatever <HI>bodily Infirmities</HI> he might labour under, (or that he could call to mind he had been visited with) he would make them the <HI>Occasions</HI> and <HI>Incentives</HI> of some agreable Dispositions in his Soul.</P>
<P>THUS I have given you a brief Specimen of his an∣swering the <HI>last</HI> Question: I have been the more <HI>brief</HI> here; because a <HI>fuller Answer</HI> will be given to it in the sixth Chapter of this Book, where I shall treat of his <HI>Christian Life</HI> at large.</P>

<P N="1">1. AMONG the <HI>three Things</HI> which constitute a <HI>finis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Divine, Temptation</HI> is one; and none must expect to be rery considerable with∣out them. Mr. MATHER had his share of them.</P>
<P>HE was never much tempted to question the <HI>Ex∣istence</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> of the DEITY: If ever he was at all, he <HI>rejected</HI> the tho'ts with the utmost Detesta∣tion and Abhorrence.</P>
<P>WHENEVER he was tempted to any evil <HI>Frame</HI> of Soul, or any wrong <HI>Action,</HI> his constant Course was to cry out, <HI>O LORD I beseech THEE, Deliver my Soul!</HI> and he endeavoured to form such <HI>Tho'ts</HI> as should be <HI>reverse,</HI> to those infused or excited by the Tempter, as well as to <HI>act contrary</HI> and diametrically opposite to what he was tempted to. Thus he <HI>resi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Devil</HI> until <HI>he fled from</HI> him: He tho't, that Oracle in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 58. was Answer enough for any Temptation.</P>

<P>IN his 36th Year he received a Remarkable <HI>De∣liverance.</HI> For, Riding over a <HI>Bridge</HI> one of the <HI>Poles</HI> on it, that was <HI>rotten,</HI> broke, and his Horse broke thro' and <HI>sunk down to his Breast.</HI> Mr. MA∣THER chose rather to keep the Saddle than go off into the <HI>River,</HI> and the Horse to the Astonishment of the Company <HI>rose</HI> again (tearing off his <HI>Shoe</HI> in Rising) and leap'd over with Mr. MATHER safe upon him.
<PB N="61" REF="003188_0083_0FF01424C4A529C8"/>How happily do all Creatures serve us, while we are serving their and our LORD!</P>
<P>I shall relate but one notable Deliverance more: When the Squadron arrived from the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> on Board of which there was a considerable Army return∣ed from a fruitless Expedition there; Mr. MATHER was desired by many of the Officers to give them a Sermon on a certain <HI>Sabbath</HI> upon an <HI>Island</HI> where they put ashore to air themselves. He rashly under∣took it, but while he was in his Excellency's Barge, he was taken so very Sick that his Friends must needs carry him back again. As soon as he came Home he was well: The Admiral afterwards told him, it was well he went no further; for the Army had newly suffered a great Desolation by a Sickness more infecti∣ous and destructive than the Plague it self: And had he gone and conversed among such an infectious Com∣pany, it would probably have cost him his Life, as it proved mortal to many of his Neighbours, who were so hardy as to go down among them.</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT having mentioed his being kept from ill∣ness, I may now very properly add a Section of his be∣ing <HI>visited with Sickness,</HI> his <HI>Thot's</HI> under it, his <HI>De∣liverance</HI> from it, with the grateful Sentiments of his Heart upon being kept from sundry Diseases.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, especially when a Young Man, he was troubled with tormenting Pains in his <HI>Teeth</HI> and <HI>Jaws;</HI> which <HI>Pains</HI> made him lose more Time than he was willing to spare, and which produced many a sad Hour to him in his Pilgrimage. In these Pains he would set himself, as well as he could, to <HI>try his Ways.</HI></P>
<P>HE considered whether or no, he had not sinned with his <HI>Teeth?</HI> How? By sinful and excessive <HI>Eat∣ing:</HI> And by <HI>Evil Speeches;</HI> for there are <HI>Literae Dentales</HI> used in them. At last by a course of Wash∣ing behind his Ears and on the Top of his Head with <HI>Cold Water,</HI> he obtainted a Deliverance from the un∣easinesses.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="003188_0084_0FF014266F1E5CD8"/>
BY Reason of his Sedentary Life, great Study and little Exercise, he was when in Years much afflicted and enfeebled with Sickness at his <HI>Stomach,</HI> a palled a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d pained Stomach. From hence he must awaken himself to bewail his want of a Stomach for the Service of GOD, and Meditations on his SAVIOUR; he must mourn for his not having an Appetite for the best Ob∣jects and Actions; which he tho't he had not duely relished: The Offences of his Stomach in the Intemp∣erance of the Table he tho't also to be bewailed; he must beg the Pardon of his Miscarriages thro' the Blood of the great Sacrifice, and beg Grace to carry it better. Thus he fetch'd <HI>Good out of Evil;</HI> and thus Evil <HI>work'd together for</HI> his <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>THE last Thing I shall mention in this Section is his pious Tho'ts upon being delivered from Sickness <HI>in General,</HI> and <HI>five Diseases</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>HE was ever desirous, to be greatly affected with Dispositions of agreable Gratitude unto the GOD of his Health; and by the Health with which he was fa∣voured to be awakened unto such Acknowledgments of GOD and such Resolutions of Piety, as he tho't were most emphatically expected from him. Wherefore when he visited the Sick, he would bless the LORD for his own <HI>Freedom</HI> from their Diseases; and would think, what <HI>moral Diseases</HI> and Disorders he had analogous to them, against which he should be watch∣ful; and unto what Graces and Actions he should by the Goodness of his SAVIOUR be animated, and he would first offer his <HI>Prayers</HI> and them employ his <HI>Cares</HI> for the obtaining of them.</P>
<P>THERE are particularly <HI>five Diseases;</HI> his Deliver∣ance from each of which, he improved in a way of exceeding <HI>Thankfulness</HI> unto the LORD his <HI>Healer.</HI> And being delivered from <HI>them,</HI> he would on the oc∣casion glorify his GOD after this manner. Since he was not lying under the living Death of a <HI>Palsey,</HI> he would be very zealous and <HI>active</HI> in the Service of
<PB N="63" REF="003188_0085_0FF014282B169BF0"/>GOD. Since he was not under Corrosions of a <HI>Cancer,</HI> he would have all Tendencies to <HI>Envy</HI> extinguished in his Soul, and a perpetual Joy at the Prosperity of his Neighbour flourishing in him. Since he had not the Tortures of the <HI>Gout,</HI> his <HI>Feet</HI> should chearfully carry him to the afflicted, with Comfortable Words, and unto the Congregation of the Faithful; While his <HI>Hands</HI> should not be idle in writing for GOD, and in distributing to the Poor. Since the <HI>Stone</HI> had not laid him on the Rack, he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e full of tender <HI>Com∣passion</HI> to all the Miserable. And since he was not wasting with a <HI>Consumption,</HI> he would beware of <HI>Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ness</HI> in the Soul, and <HI>pining away</HI> in Iniquity. Thus he <HI>learned Obedience by the things which he suffered</HI> not.</P>
<P N="4">4. I never observed among Pagan Writers a better description in so few Words of a good Man, resolute in <HI>Virtue,</HI> even while he is <HI>reproached</HI> for it, than that of RUTILIUS, <HI>RUTILII Virtus &amp; Innocen∣tia lateret, nisi accepisset Injuriam; Dum viciatur effulsit</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Seneca Epist. 79.</NOTE>. The very same may be said concerning Dr. MATHER, in the midst of the <HI>base Usage</HI> he met with from the <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Pens</HI> of several.</P>
<P>MY excellent Uncle of <HI>Witney</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> in his <HI>Letter about Temptations,</HI> observes, that Ministers, who meet with abuses from sorry and scoundrel Peo∣ple, have cause to look on themselves as humbled on the Account of their having the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Plague of <HI>Lice</HI> upon them. If so, then the Doctor might have Cause for Humiliation on the same Account; having perhaps the Iinsults of contemptible People, the Assaults of those insignificant <HI>Lice,</HI> more than any Man in <HI>New-England.</HI> These troublesome but diminutive Creatures he scorn'd to concern himself with, only to <HI>pity</HI> them and <HI>pray</HI> for them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER GOD appeared so for him, that several of them have at last been bro't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o confess, against
<PB N="64" REF="003188_0086_0FF0142B38146A30"/>their Will almost, what superior Excellency there was in him.</P>
<P>I will here for some Causes insert one Passage; (tho' there were several in the Doctor's Life of the same Importance) 'Tis this;</P>
<P>IN the Year 1704. <HI>Octob.</HI> 10. there came several People to the Doctor very late at Night, telling him, there was a Man in the Town lay a dying, but cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not be satisfied unless he saw <HI>him</HI> before he died. The Man was noted for his wickedness. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name was <HI>Goerge Fielding.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN the Doctor came to him (who wondred at him that he would so readily do it) he told him to this Purpose <Q>That he had been a very profane Per∣son; that he had given himself a great Liberty to abuse good Men; but had abused no Man in the World so much as Doctor MATHER, and that he could not go out of the World without confessing it, bewailing it unto him, and beseeching him to pardon it.</Q> The Doctor asked him, if he had re∣ceived any particular Prejudice, or ever had been in∣formed or could have pretended any particular Matter of Fact, upon which his Abuses might have been esta∣blished? He gave him to understand, that <Q>There was nothing of <HI>that,</HI> but all was downright <HI>Malig∣nity;</HI> for he took him to be a Man that did <HI>more Good than</HI> others, and that was <HI>all the Reason</HI> why he had vilified him more than other Men.</Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor, after his well known mild Way, told the Man, That there was no Occasion for any Par∣don because of his Speaking <HI>diminutively</HI> of him; for, says he, you may speak so of me, and do me no wrong. But, continued he, for your speaking injuri∣ously, falsely, calumniously of me, it was indeed a Fault; yet, as he would forgive it without his asking for it, had it been ten hundred times more than it was, he would join with him in crying to GOD for the Forgiveness of that, and every Thing else where∣in
<PB N="65" REF="003188_0087_0FF0142E58CBABE8"/>he had done amiss.' He did so. The Man was full of Affection to him, kept continually crying for him to be with him the next Day in the Forenoon, and he died in the Afternoon.— And perhaps every Man who ever reproached him, if he were to place himself in the Circumstances of a <HI>dying Man</HI> would alter his Opinion and change his Tone.</P>
<P><HI>I have said</HI> of his <HI>meaner</HI> Reproaches: But, could one think it, the Doctor's distinguishing <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Usefulness</HI> procured him some Enemies among those who might <HI>otherwise</HI> pass for <HI>Men of Sense &amp; Credit.</HI> Such would sometimes speak <HI>disrespectfully</HI> of him; and now and then a ZOI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>S would vent his Spite, <HI>foam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous his</HI> Malice and Shame; while he instead of returning an Answer when advis'd to it, chose rather to publish such Treatises as were lasting Testimonies of his <HI>Religion &amp; Charity.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were some who also <HI>wret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> against him; but against all their Calumnies, as St. IGNATIUS said to POLYCARP, he stood <HI>steady, and fast as a beaten Anvil.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES they would endite <HI>Letters</HI> full of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣veling Malice, and send <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem unto him: He received them without Emotion of Soul, and tied them up till they made a large Bundle, on the out side of which he wrote, <HI>Libels? Father, forgive them!</HI></P>
<P>AND some have <HI>published Books</HI> full of Lies and Inve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tives against him: But, as the <HI>Authors</HI> were but little regarded, the <HI>Books</HI> were scarce ever look'd in. The Doctor took no other Satisfaction of them, but just to write in the beginning of the Books: Job XXXI. 35, 36. — <HI>My Desire is— that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Adver∣sary had written a Book: Surely I would take is on my Shoulder and bind it as a Crown to me.</HI> He tho't it not worth his while to write against them, or ra∣ther for himself; but chose once for all to give the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, his <HI>Right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to shak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iper▪</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="003188_0088_0FF014301DEC2FD0"/>
I know not here how to use more significant Expressions than those us'd by Mr. BAXTER in his <HI>dying Thot's,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pag. 227, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>8.</NOTE> concerning such as had been Angry with him, and could not endure him to answer them, and vindicate his own Innocency; I say, I know not how to use better Expressions of Dr. MATHER with respect to his Enemies, than these,— That '<HI>all</HI> of them together were never able to <HI>fasten</HI> their Accusa∣tions, and procure any <HI>common Belief;</HI> nor to bring <HI>him</HI> under designed Contempt; much less to break <HI>his</HI> Comforts, Encouragements and Labors.</P>
<P>I shall speak of but one thing more, and conclude this Chapter with it. The Doctor was a firm <HI>Friend to his Country;</HI> and by Consequence must be <HI>hated</HI> by the <HI>Enemies of it,</HI> as he was: Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>I suppose there was not one Enemy of our Country but what pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess'd open Emnity to Him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quonam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meo, <HI>P.

<P>AND therefore they were glad of all Opportunities which they might improve for their Advantage <HI>against him;</HI> and were particularly pleas'd when they could meet with any <HI>private Letters</HI> from <HI>others</HI> to him, as well as from <HI>him</HI> to others, which some were so dis∣ingenuous as to expose: They were never able to bring about their Designs: The Doctor was high above their reach.</P>
<P>BUT because the showing of <HI>private Letters</HI> is a frequent Practice, tho' a very barbarous and ungen∣tlemanly one, I will take the Liberty to transcribe for the use of the <HI>Learned,</HI> the Words of CICERO, <HI>in Marc. Anton. Philippic.</HI> 2.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Number</HI> of the Books, which he prin∣ted, is <HI>three hundred eighty and two;</HI> and and yet, as one of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets says of <HI>him that acts with GOD on his side,</HI> he wrote them, as he <HI>did all Things with Ease.</HI>— On the outside of the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of his Works, which I shall give you at the End of this Book, he wrote that Text for his further Excitation and Encouragement, Joh. xv. 8. <HI>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much Fruit:</HI> And upon looking over the <HI>Catalog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> I

<Q><L>Quam numerare Dies Sol dat mortalibus Anno,</L>
<L>Plures perdectos edidit ille Libros.</L></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. BEFORE I speak of <HI>one</HI> particular Book, I shall make a <HI>general Observation</HI> concerning the Doctor's Writings. To prepare the way to the Remark, let me tell you, That Dr. MATHER'S <HI>quick Dispatch</HI> in <HI>Reading</HI> was well known to all; he would <HI>ride Post</HI> thro' an Author, <HI>Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: pedum praevertere Ventos;</HI> and yet, which was more surprizing, he always <HI>remem∣bred the most observable</HI> Things he read, was <HI>Master</HI> of them and able to <HI>produce</HI> them.</P>
<P>MY general Remark therefore concerning most of the Doctor's Writings except his <HI>practical</HI> ones, is, That we need not wonder to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd in his Books so <HI>many learned Allusions</HI> and <HI>References;</HI> for it is next to impossible, that a Man should keep from <HI>writing learnedly,</HI> and as if he were acquainted with Author's and their Sentiments, when his Mind is stored with their <HI>various Ideas</HI> and Images, and he is a compleat <HI>Owner</HI> of them.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed a Set of <HI>Witlings,</HI> who for Fear of <HI>Pedantry,</HI> and hurting a Period, would not quote a <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence, however weighty and pregnant it may be; but, instead of the <HI>massy Sense</HI> in the Expressions of <HI>others,</HI> chuse <HI>their own easy Flow of Words, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding Vacuity of Tho't.</HI> Thus these Men <HI>Dum vitant vitia in contraria cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at.</HI> Sat. 2.</NOTE>, to use a Sentence of HORACE'S; and, to mortify them with another Author, JUVENAL gives their Charac∣ter when he says of some; <HI>Rarus Sermo illis et mag∣na Libido ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndi</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Juvenal.</HI> Sat.</NOTE>; which last Sentence I would translate, they have <HI>a great Gust for saying nothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="003188_0091_0FF01437F75FF2F8"/>
BUT on the other side, I must confess there may be a Fault in endeavouring and <HI>straining</HI> for <HI>far fetch'd,</HI> and <HI>dear bought</HI> Hints, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramming</HI> a Discourse with them: And therefore I cannot but subscribe to the ingenuous Observation of Mr. TRAPP <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In pretio Gemmae semper habitae, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mper{que} ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>: vestem interim Gemmis. etiam diversorum Generum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣quaversum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ustan &amp; coopertam, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> quam l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t? <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>, That good <HI>Writings,</HI> as <HI>Clothes,</HI> ought <HI>not to be loaded with Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this is no Exception against the Doctor's way of Writing; for, tho' his Treatises were <HI>stuck with Jewels,</HI> they were not <HI>burthen'd</HI> with them: No! There were just eno' to render a strong &amp; easy <HI>Splendor.</HI></P>
<P>I need not say any more in a general way concern∣ing Dr. MATHER'S <HI>Writings;</HI> since in the 44th and 45th Pages of his <HI>Manuductio</HI> he has hindred me, by giving the World a Description and Account of them,</P>
<P N="3">3. I come more <HI>particularly</HI> to speak of some of his <HI>Publications,</HI> with a <HI>Vindication</HI> of them, and an <HI>Account</HI> of others, together with the Character of some <HI>prepared</HI> for the Press, and now in my Hands.</P>
<P>THE first Book, I shall treat of, shall be his <HI>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana:</HI> A <HI>Book</HI> replete with <HI>Learning,</HI> and excellently calculated for the Ad∣vancement of true <HI>Religion &amp; Undefiled:</HI> A <HI>Book,</HI> in which the good Names of above <HI>fourscore Wor∣thies,</HI> who for the Cause of CHRIST came over into this Land when it was a Wilderness, are consign'd over with Honor, to late Posterity: A <HI>Book,</HI> in which there is a faithful Account of the <HI>Actions</HI> &amp; <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our <HI>Fathers,</HI> together with a true Relation of ma∣ny remarkable Providences in setling this Land, it's <HI>Churches, Colleges, Schools</HI> and <HI>Inhabitants:</HI> and, in a word, a <HI>Book,</HI> in which the designs of a <HI>Church History</HI> are exquisitely accommodated.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="003188_0092_0FF014399A24A468"/>
BUT I had rather on this occasion use the words of Mr. ALSOP (a Gentleman of great <HI>Learning</HI> &amp; <HI>Peity,</HI> as well as of finished <HI>Wit</HI>) who, when an <HI>Abridg∣ment</HI> of this <HI>History</HI> was proposed in an Assembly of Ministers, said; <HI>It is a very improper Proposal; 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to abridge it! Abridging it will injure it. There is nothing superfluous in it: Instead of Epito∣mizing it, you had better read it twice over as I have: No Man that has a Relish for Piety or for Variety can ever be weary of it.</HI></P>
<P>I have several other Letters by me from Gentlemen beyond Sea, which are <HI>full</HI> to the same purpose: And here, the Gentlemen at <HI>Scotland</HI> will give me leave to declare it, that they highly valu'd the Performance: and the equally learned and modest Mr. MILLAR of <HI>Paisley</HI> in particular will forgive me, if I speak of it, that in his excellent Book of <HI>the Propagation of Christianity,</HI> he mentions the Doctor as well as his <HI>Magnalia</HI> with great Respect.</P>
<P>IN describing the <HI>Magnalia,</HI> I mentioned <HI>the Lives</HI> in it and their Number: I may take notice here, that by the Year 1718. the Doctor had published the Lives of no less than <HI>one hundred and fourteen</HI> Men, and more than <HI>twenty</HI> Women, and since that Year, he has printed Accounts and Characters of many more; not to say any Thing of the transient but ho∣nourable mention many others have had in the Doc∣tor's Tractates.</P>
<P>BUT I may particularly speak of <HI>the Life</HI> of his <HI>Father,</HI> Published in the Year 1724, which may pass for an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the <HI>Magnalia:</HI> It is a very <HI>enter∣taining Life;</HI> was well received in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in <HI>this</HI> Country; and is worthy to be perus'd by every Man of Sense, Honor, and Vertue.</P>
<P>THE Doctor has given to the World a Book en∣titled, <HI>Psalterium Americanum;</HI> the Design of which was, first, to give <HI>in Meetre</HI> an exact and literal
<PB N="71" REF="003188_0093_0FEFD886C082A168"/><HI>Version</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Text, without any Jingle of Words at the End; and then, at the End of each Psalm, to produce those <HI>Illustrations</HI> of the Text, and those <HI>pious Hints</HI> that would both <HI>enlighten</HI> the Mind, and <HI>warm</HI> the Heart of the Singer. As for the <HI>Illustratory</HI> part, no Man that has any Value for Di∣vine Knowlege can find Fault with it; and as for the <HI>Metrical</HI> Version some prefer it vastly to <HI>any other;</HI> for as on one hand it has no large <HI>Paraphrase,</HI> nor yet any <HI>Diminution</HI> of the Sense of DAVID, so on the other it has no Occasion to select improper <HI>Words</HI> for the sake of a Rhime.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Directions of a Candidate of the Ministry,</HI> which Dr. MATHER has printed, has occasioned so many Letters of <HI>Thanks</HI> and <HI>Compliment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that it would fill a <HI>Volumne</HI> to recite them. And indeed, <HI>(Quis unquam vituperavit?)</HI> Who ever said a word against it?</P>
<P>The Doctor's <HI>Christian Philosopher,</HI> in which the learned World enjoys a rich Treasure, is a celebrated Piece: An ingenious Gentleman from <HI>London</HI> writes of it "<HI>It is the Glory of</HI> New-England, <HI>as it is the Admiration of</HI> Old.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Ratio Disciplinae Fratrum Nov-Anglorum,</HI> (which Title he borrow'd from COMENIUS,) has had very great Encomiums.—One of the most finish'd <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>Scholars</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> one who was born for Government over Men as well as to be a Ruler in the Common-wealth of <HI>Learning,</HI> and one who is <HI>Delicium Humani Generis,</HI> has been pleas'd to write of that Book, that <HI>'it is a decent consistent Method of Church-Government".</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have writ of one or two of the Doctor's Books, which produced him the <HI>greatest Esteem;</HI> these I chose to speak of, because they were composed with strong Tho't and great Application.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="003188_0094_0FF0143F76460EE8"/>
I will not mention any of his <HI>smaller Works,</HI> many of which were never design'd in the composing for <HI>the Press,</HI> and therefore needed not that great <HI>Accu∣racy</HI> as if they <HI>had:</HI> And it was the Doctor's fre∣quent Wonder that <HI>those Composures he wrote with the least Trouble and Care, found a Passage into the World, while many of his elaborate Composures lay by him.</HI></P>
<P>BUT yet in and by those <HI>smaller Books</HI> (which he ever modestly call'd <HI>Essays.</HI>) he show'd he was in <HI>Labour, more abundant,</HI> he discover'd the great <HI>Reach</HI> of his <HI>Tho't</HI> and <HI>Compass</HI> of his <HI>Learning,</HI> did a vast deal of Good and procured the Thanks of innume∣rable. Many of these have had <HI>several Editions</HI> with <HI>Prefaces</HI> from Men of the <HI>first Rank</HI> in the learned World.</P>
<P>I shall acquaint my Reader with two or three of those (Treatises or rather) <HI>great Performances,</HI> which he left behind him in Manuscript.</P>
<P>THERE is his <HI>Angel of Bethesda:</HI> a Book in which under <HI>every Disease</HI> there are proper, religious, Christian <HI>Sentiments</HI> for those who are Sick: and then the most <HI>simple and easy Medicines</HI> collected from his own Knowledge and Use, and from among the most noted Receipes and Experiments in learned Writers. This is a considerable Volumn, and cost the Doctor many Years study to fill and embellish it.</P>
<P>THERE is his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erges,</HI> or <HI>Work of the Day:</HI> A large Treatise, design'd for the promoting an <HI>U∣nion</HI> amongst <HI>Protestants,</HI> and written with great Care, long Observation, hard Study and a laudable Charity.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise his <HI>Triparadisus,</HI> which was sent to Mr. WYAT Bookseller in <HI>London</HI> in order to be published: Since which I am informed the <HI>Book∣seller</HI> is dead, and know not what is become of the <HI>Manuscript.</HI> It is pity it should be lost: It show'd a great Acquaintance with <HI>Divine and Human Learn∣ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="003188_0095_0FF0144324FB6840"/>
HIS <HI>Goliathus detruncatus,</HI> had <HI>as sad</HI> a Fate. The Book was written against Mr. WHISTON: The Design of it was to show, that most of the <HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Fathers</HI> were orthodox and not <HI>Arian,</HI> contrary to that learned Man's gross Mistake: It was written in an <HI>Epistolary</HI> Way: Dr. EDWARDS a famous Di∣vine of the <HI>Church of England</HI> was bringing it into the World, and had written a <HI>Preface</HI> to it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, Dr. EDWARDS dying when it was upon the brin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of ap∣pearing, the <HI>Work</HI> was bro't to a <HI>full Stop,</HI> and I have not heard where the <HI>Letter</HI> is disposed of.</P>
<P>THERE remains but one more to be treated of; and <HI>That</HI> is a Work the writing of which is enough constantly to employ a Man, unless he be a <HI>Miracle of Diligence</HI> the <HI>half</HI> of the <HI>Threescore Years &amp; Ten</HI> which is the Sum of Years allowed us. I mean, his <HI>Illustrations of the sacred Scripture.</HI> The Doctor, from an Hint given by that very great and learned Man my Lord BACON, begun this Work in his <HI>thirty first</HI> Year, tho' he had before <HI>some</HI> Materials for it by him; and in his <HI>fifty first Year</HI> so finish'd it, as to publish his PROPOSALS for printing it, intituled, <HI>A new Offer to the Lovers of Religion and Learning.</HI> Ever <HI>since</HI> that Time to his <HI>Death,</HI> he was adding to it: so that now it is judged to be <HI>by far the greatest Amassment of Learning that has ever been bro't to∣gether to illustrate the Oracles of GOD.</HI> I shall say no more here concerning it; designing to print <HI>Pro∣posals</HI> for it's Publication, together with which I shall give a faithful Description of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. I shall have done this Chapter, when I have writ Dr. FRANKIUS'S Prescription which Dr. MA∣THER learnt of him and observed, that is, <Q>When one has projected any Thing that will be <HI>evidently</HI> a Service to the Kingdom of GOD, he should go on, with a lively Faith in HIM to carry him thro', tho' at the present he may have but little Prospect of accomplishing his Designs: GOD will doubtless do very wonderfully for him.</Q></P>

<P N="1">1. THE wise Man says, Prov. XI 27. <HI>He who diligently seeketh Good procureth Favor:</HI> which Proverb Dr. PAT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ICK thus para∣phrases, <Q>He that from the Time he ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es studies nothing but how to do Good unto others, shall obtain Favor both with GOD and Man.</Q> Doctor MATHER knew experimentally the Truth of this.</P>
<P N="2">2. I remember the famous ZANCHY in his Oration, when ROTANUS was made a Doctor, says; — <HI>Quos DEUS prior promovit, quis rejiciat? Quos DEUS prior excellentibus Donis vero Doctore dignis exornat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctorum Ornamenta his deneget?</HI> And the same may be said concerning Mr. MATHER; When he was <HI>worthy</HI> of the <HI>Doctorate,</HI> why should not he have it?</P>
<P>THE Renowned Senate of the University of <HI>Glas∣gow,</HI> sensible of his great Merits, in the Year MDCCX. presented him with a <HI>Doctor's Degree,</HI> with a <HI>Diplo∣ma</HI> for it, and the <HI>great Seal</HI> of the Academy affix'd unto it.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Diploma,</HI> speaking of the highest Academi∣cal Honor, the illustrious <HI>Senate</HI> says; <HI>Cum h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c Ac∣ademico Honore dignissimum ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seamus Virum Egre∣gium</HI> COTTONUM MATHER, <HI>Evangelii apud Bostoni∣enses Angliae novae Incoles Praeconem celeberrimum.

<P><PB N="75" REF="003188_0097_0FF014476B5B5D80"/>
WHEN the <HI>Diploma</HI> was sent unto Dr. MATHER, the most excellent <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> of the University wrote very kindly to him I will take the very great Freedom to quote a Paragraph or two of his Letter;
<Q>The high Value (writes he the University here has for you, I hope, you will no longer doubt, when I tell you, they have confer'd the highest Academical Degree upon You the Doctorate in Divinity; which <HI>I am persuaded is but what you deserve.</HI> Be pleased therefore to receive your <HI>Di∣ploma,</HI> which could not be sent sooner, in regard no such sure Occasion offered until now. Sir, I shall henceforth reckon you under a nearer Rela∣tion to this Society, and as one of us.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dean of the Faculty</HI> also about the same time writes thus: <Q>Upon a Motion made in the Fa∣culty of this University, that some Testimony be given of the Sense we have of your Merit, it was unanimously agreed unto, that the Honor of <HI>Doctor of Divinity</HI> should be conferred on you. And, according to the Power they have by their Founda∣tion Charter, granted some Hundreds of Years ago, They have (dispensing with your Absence) created you <HI>Doctor of Divinity;</HI> and having ordered your <HI>Diploma</HI> they have signed it, and appended the Universities great Seal. This their Deed is as valid, as any University in <HI>Europe</HI> can make it</Q></P>
<P>FROM this Time Dr. MATHER had a very intimate Friendship and Correspondence with several Gentle∣men of that University: He heartily lov'd them un∣to his Death, and never spoke of them but with Terms of the greatest Respect.</P>
<P>AND, as the very learned Man I quoted above says, that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vobis cavendum est, ne quod non nullis contingit, con∣tenti in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>atique solo Doctorum Titulo sludia negligatis; sed danda potius Opera, ut Titulus, iste, Ornamenta{que}; Doctorum nobis sint stimuli ad diligentius studendum &amp; faciendum Officium. <HI>Zanchii Orat de Dignitate studdi Theolog.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the Title and Ornaments of Doctor's should
<PB N="76" REF="003188_0098_0FF01533F00BAAD8"/>stimulate them to an industrious Studying and Doing their Duty:</HI> of this Doctor MATHER was excedingly desirous.</P>
<P>WHEN he received his <HI>Diploma,</HI> he immediately look'd upon it as an Encouragement unto him in the Service of CHRIST and HIS Kingdom: He rendred Thanks to Heaven, and beg'd Grace to make such an Improvement of the Encouragement as might answer the Demands of Heaven from him: And he set him∣self to consider, What <HI>Sanctity,</HI> what <HI>Gravity,</HI> what <HI>Usefulness,</HI> what shining <HI>Abilities</HI> and <HI>Performances</HI> the Church of GOD might justly demand from one so distinguished above any Man in the <HI>American</HI> Co∣lonies.</P>
<P>I shall have done with this Head, when I have told my Reader of the pious Use he made of his <HI>Ring.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the Doctor's Friends advised him to wear his <HI>Signet Ring,</HI> as a Token and Assertion of his <HI>Doctorate in Divinity,</HI> to which he was admitted as above; and not to do it from any Vanity of Orna∣ment, but out of Obedience to the <HI>Fifth Command∣ment,</HI> which directs us to assert the Honor of any Dignity, in which the Providence of GOD may station us.</P>
<P>THE Doctor therefore would wear this <HI>Ring;</HI> and made this Action, so seemingly inconsiderable, a great Engine of Religion.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> HE <HI>look'd</HI> on <HI>the Ring</HI> as a <HI>continual Ad∣monition</HI> to him, to do <HI>nothing</HI> below the Character, of which that was a Memorial; nothing disagreable to the <HI>Gravity</HI> the <HI>Discretion</HI> and <HI>superiour Behavior</HI> with which a <HI>Doctorate</HI> ought always to be attended.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT effectually admonished him, that in his <HI>Discourse</HI> there should pass nothing out of his Lips that was mean, or not according to the Laws of <HI>Wisdom, Goodness</HI> and <HI>Usefulness</HI></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="003188_0099_0FEFD89038AD6E10"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE sight of the <HI>Gold</HI> frequently ex∣cited <HI>Wishes</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> in him of this Importance. <HI>May I have the Grace, the Gain of which is better than that of Gold▪ May I be a Son of Zion compar∣able to fine Gold:</HI> And on the <HI>Signet—May I be pre∣served from so provoking the holy LORD, that if I were a Signet on his Right-Hand, He would pluck me thence!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> ONE Original to the Ceremony of a <HI>Ring</HI> for <HI>Doctors of Divinity</HI> was to intimate, that they should be ready to set their <HI>Seal</HI> to the Advice which may be received from them. The Doctor im∣proved this as a Caution: His Advice was asked on many Occasions; he would be very considerate, and on such Occasions deliberate and look up to Heaven, desiring to speak nothing but what he should be will∣ing to <HI>seal</HI> it and stand to it.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE Emblem on the Doctor's <HI>Signet</HI> is A TREE with Psal. 1.3. written under it; and about it GLASCUA RIGAVIT. The Cast of his Eye up∣on this, constantly provoked him to pray, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>O GOD, make me a very fruitful Tree, and help me to bring forth seasonable Fruit continually!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE Respect which the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don</HI> paid him, did also very much encourage him, and fortify him in his Essays to do Good, while it added to the superior Circumstances, in which he was placed above the Contempt of envious Men.</P>
<P>'TWAS in the Year 1714. he received a Letter from the Secretary of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> [RICHARD WALLER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>] dated <HI>Decemb.</HI> 4. 1713. in which are these Words; <HI>As for your being chosen a Member of the Royal Society, that has been done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th by the Council and Body of the Society: only the Ceremony of an Admission is wanting; which, you being beyond Sea, cannot be performed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="003188_0100_0FF0144B708BEAE0"/>
AFTER this he had several Letters from many con∣siderable Gentlemen of that society, who always Superscribed their Letters to him as <HI>F. R. S.</HI> And he was assured by several of them, that he ought to affix <HI>that</HI> Title to his Name before his Works: other∣wise he would never have done it.</P>
<P>BUT there are a few in <HI>New-England,</HI> who, as they grudg'd the Doctor <HI>any</HI> Honor, were so very foolish and impudent as to doubt, nay to deny his Right unto <HI>that</HI> Title: The Reason they gave for it was; be∣cause his Name was not in the <HI>List of the Members of that Society:</HI> But they are ignorant of it, that, altho' his Majesty's Subjects in any of his extended Domini∣ons may be a <HI>Fellow of the Royal Society,</HI> they may not have their Names in the <HI>List</HI> of the Society if they are absent; which is the only Reason why the Doctor's was not. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it be said, there are the Names of several <HI>outlandish</HI> Gentlemen in the List; what is this to the purpose? They are <HI>Foreigners</HI> and are allow'd this Honor because they are so: whereas no Man among his Mejesty's Subjects may have this Fa∣vor, unless he be present and be formally admitted.—Several Gentlemen of the Society wonder at the Stu∣pidity of those People who doubt this, and in their Letters express their Amazement at it: I have at this Time in my Hand, Letters from Mr. WALLER, Dr. CHAMBERLAIN, Dr. WOODWARD, Dr. JURIN, and others who give Dr. MATHER his Title, and express Concern that some sordid People <HI>here</HI> will not allow it.</P>
<P>BUT the Doctor was very easy, as well he might; for if he <HI>had not</HI> the due <HI>Title</HI> allowed him, he <HI>deser∣ved</HI> it; as his <HI>Christian Philosopher,</HI> his <HI>Curiosa A∣mericana,</HI> or Letters to the Royal Society, together with his (unprinted) <HI>Angel of Bethesda</HI> abundantly testify.</P>
<P N="4">4. As for <HI>Domestic Honours</HI> they were comparatively but <HI>small;</HI> they honored not the Doctor so much as he honored <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="79" REF="003188_0101_0FF0144DC947C350"/>
5. I know not how better to dismiss this Head than with a pious Tho't which the Doctor had, upon the <HI>Honors</HI> of this World, and a Name among the Learned of the World.</P>
<P>THERE is (he tho't) an accursed <HI>Idolatry</HI> com∣mitted, when we take Notice of this and that consi∣derable in any <HI>Man,</HI> and consider not at the same Time the great GOD as the Author of all this Excellency. <HI>Man</HI> ought to be look'd on as nothing, any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther than what GOD makes him to be; so that when we see any thing that looks <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> in any <HI>Man,</HI> it must be with sensible Acknowlegements, that <HI>all comes from GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE most of Men will celebrate the <HI>Learning,</HI> the <HI>Vertue,</HI> the <HI>Conduct</HI> of an eminent Person without the least Observation of our Maker in all; much less do they give <HI>all</HI> the Glory of <HI>all</HI> to GOD, and behold <HI>Man,</HI> as no other than a <HI>Vessel</HI> chosen by the <HI>Grace of GOD,</HI> to exhibit <HI>something</HI> of HIS own Glory in the Points which render the <HI>Man</HI> observable.</P>
<P>Dr. MATHER therefore trembled, and was fill'd with a shuddering Horror, at the Tho'ts of having a <HI>great Name</HI> in the World, or being applauded, ad∣mired and mightily talk'd of. The Reason of this Regret was, because he tho't those that spoke w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of <HI>Him,</HI> would not have the <HI>Piety</HI> to look further than him. He was afraid <HI>his</HI> poor Name should have sa∣crilegiously lodg'd upon it, some Regards that should be transfer'd to the glorious GOD alone. Indeed he was sensible, there would be no <HI>Iniquity</HI> charged on <HI>Him</HI> for the <HI>Sacrilege</HI> into which others fell: But yet beheld it as a great <HI>Infelicity:</HI> He reckon'd himself <HI>unhappy</HI> in being the <HI>Object</HI> upon which any should sinfully <HI>terminate</HI> their Honors and Praises: He won∣derfully abhorred it.</P>
<P>HE rejoiced in it, if any <HI>Lovers of GOD</HI> said; <HI>The GOD of all Grace has disposed that Servant of</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="80" REF="003188_0102_0FF014518F73C7B0"/><HI>to do vertuously;</HI> or <HI>the Power and Wisdom of GOD have carried that Servant</HI> of HIS <HI>well thro' La∣bors and Sufferings!</HI> This was all the Doctor desir'd; this was all his Ambition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2.</HI> Foreign Correspondencies.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT would be tiresome to my Reader to tell what <HI>Correspondents</HI> the Doctor had beyond Sea to∣gether with their <HI>Characters.</HI> All therefore I shall say here is, that he had a very <HI>numerous</HI> and <HI>extensive Correspondence;</HI> so that I have known him at one Time to have above <HI>fifty</HI> beyond Sea to whom he was obliged to spend considerable Time in writing.</P>
<P N="2">2. BUT, altho' it would be tedious to speak of <HI>all</HI> he was acquainted with by Letters, it will not be so to name a <HI>few now Living</HI> with whom the Doctor accounted himself <HI>happy in a Correspondence.</HI></P>
<P>I have spoken before of his intimate Friendship with many Gentlemen of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation in the sacred Order, but I must by no means forget here to acquaint the World, that my Lord POLLUL a Gentle∣man of great Goodness; Humanity and Religion, was pleased often to remember Him: I need not, I suppose, say any Thing more of <HI>that</HI> Nation; nor any Thing of his Intimacy with several <HI>Ministers</HI> of the greatest Character in <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Ireland:</HI> 'Tis well known.</P>
<P>THE very great and good my Lord Chancellor KING will not be angry, if I publish it, that he has honored my Father with his Letters.</P>
<P>THE Author (if we are not mistaken in the Author) of the <HI>Miscellanea Sacra</HI> also, (which Dr. MATHER look'd upon as an inestimable uncommon Treasure) will not take it amiss, if I let the world know he has many Times written to the Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="003188_0103_0FF01453D5577870"/>
Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE likewise very sweetly entertained and highly gratified the Doctor with his <HI>Epistles</HI> as well as his <HI>printed</HI> Composures.</P>
<P>THOSE learned mathematicians and Philosophers Mr. WHISTON and Dr. DESAGULIERS, have written familiarly to him, and with Expressions of Love and Honor for him.</P>
<P>I shall mention but one more, who is I suppose, yet living, Mr. PILLIONERE, from whom he had several Letters: And by the way, I think one of the Doctor's Letters to him is printed in the <HI>Occasional Paper,</HI> and is called <HI>a Celebrated Letter.</HI></P>
<P>TO go a little further from Home and give an In∣stance or two more of the Doctor's Correspondencies: From the Year 1712 to his Death, he had a free Cor∣respondence with a Gentleman, at <HI>Glaucha</HI> near <HI>Hall</HI> in the <HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> a Gentleman in whom I know not which is greatest, whether his shining Goodness, sincere unaffected <HI>Piety</HI> and miraculous <HI>Charity;</HI> or else his very <HI>great Learning;</HI> I mean Dr. FRANCKI∣US; one of whose pleasant long Letters to Dr. MA∣THER is printed in <HI>Pietas Hallensis.</HI></P>
<P>HE has (by Reason of that Value Dr. FRANCKIUS had for him) had also Letters from the <HI>Danish Missi∣onaries</HI> at <HI>Tranquebar</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> and not very long since had a particular Account of their Pro∣ceedings from them.</P>
<P N="3">3. HAVING written before of the <HI>Rules</HI> he observed as in other Things, in his <HI>Correspondencies,</HI> and the <HI>Design</HI> of his <HI>Cultivating</HI> them; I must here abruptly break off this Chapter, and proceed to another, in which you will find the <HI>complete Christian</HI> and his heavenly Life.</P>

<P>NOW humbly imploring the <HI>Grace</HI> of the <HI>Medi∣ator</HI> to be <HI>sufficient for me,</HI> I do as a further So∣lemnity subscribe my <HI>Name</HI> with both <HI>Hand</HI> and <HI>Heart</HI> unto this Instrument.</P></Q>
<P>THIS his Covenant he frequently, seriously, so∣lemnly renewed; and found his Account in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. HAVING laid this Foundation, he tho't it his Duty to <HI>acquaint</HI> himself with GOD, to <HI>resign</HI> him∣self to HIM and to <HI>delight</HI> in HIM.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING how, when <HI>Creatures</HI> take them∣selves Wings, while Afflictions roll in upon us; 'twould be therefore Happiness to <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rse</HI> with GOD as <HI>Alsufficient</HI> and to take Satisfaction in HIM, at that Object, that will make up the Want of all Things whatsoever.</P>
<P>HE then raised a <HI>Question,</HI> <Q>How can I take my <HI>Comfort</HI> in the <HI>Alsufficient GOD,</HI> when my Interest in HIM is uncertain? Will not the LORD frown on my Presumption, and say, <HI>I have rejected thy Con∣fidences?</HI></Q></P>
<P>HE answered <HI>No.</HI> for he laid this down as a cer-Truth; that an <HI>Heart</HI> enclined to <HI>converse</HI> with GOD, as the Object whose <HI>Alsufficiency</HI> makes up for the want of all Creatures, is a most undoubted <HI>Sign</HI> of an Interest in GOD: He therefore that <HI>can</HI> do such a Thing, may do it without any Objection and against every Discouragement.</P>
<P>READING once Mr. BOYLE'S <HI>Seraphic Love,</HI> and finding some sublime Strokes upon a Man's RESIGNING up <HI>himself,</HI> and especially his <HI>Will,</HI> to the GOD of Heaven; he resolved he would set apart a Time on Purpose to give up <HI>himself</HI> and his <HI>Will</HI> unto the
<PB N="84" REF="003188_0106_0FF0145B4881EEC8"/>LORD, and so to seek a <HI>Preparation</HI> for an actual and entire <HI>Submission</HI> unto HIM in all his Concernments. He did so.</P>
<P>IN his Papers I find an Address of his on that Occa∣sion, which I will give in his Words as follows.</P>
<P><Q>MOST glorious LORD! Thou hast offered <HI>Thy self</HI> unto thy Creatures, and often called upon them to take <HI>Thee</HI> of <HI>their GOD.</HI> This, This is that which I am willing, I am desirous, I am resolved this Day to do. I take <HI>THEE,</HI> O LORD, to be <HI>my GOD,</HI> and hence I take <HI>thy Glory</HI> for the End unto which I would <HI>be</HI> and <HI>live;</HI> I take the <HI>En∣joyment</HI> of <HI>THEE</HI> for may great and sole <HI>Happi∣ness;</HI> and, which is the peculiar Thing I am now aiming at, I take <HI>Thy Will</HI> to by <HI>my Will.</HI> As for my <HI>own Will,</HI> LORD, I find <HI>it blind,</HI> foolish, wicked, hurtful; and therefore I renounce, reject and resign it; and say again, LORD, let <HI>Thy Will</HI> be <HI>my Will.</HI> I have great <HI>Concernments;</HI> Concerns as to this World and as to the future; They are many and weighty. But O GOD, THOU art the <HI>only wise</HI> GOD; There is <HI>perfect Knowledge</HI> with <HI>THEE;</HI> THOU art of <HI>great Power;</HI> Thy <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> is <HI>infinite:</HI> And, in that sweet Recon∣ciler of GOD and Man the LORD JESUS CHRIST, THOU art wonderfully <HI>merciful</HI> and <HI>Gracious</HI> unto them that draw near unto THEE, as I do this Day. Unto Thy <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> I commit my Concernments one and all. I <HI>cast all my Cares up∣on my GOD.</HI> O THOU most <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good</HI> GOD, I resign all unto Thee. Is it not Thy Pleasure that I should so do? <HI>It is.</HI> And hast THOU not Pleasure in seeing me do so? <HI>THOU hast.</HI> I then profess in thy Presence; All my <HI>Concernments</HI> are put into Thy Hands and left unto Thy <HI>Manage∣ments</HI> forever. And now I am inconceivably <HI>happy!</HI> The LORD GOD Almighty will <HI>perform all Things for me,</HI> and all Things now shall be <HI>well</HI> performed. Whatever now befalls me will be an Effect of the great JEHOVAH'S infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> &amp; <HI>Goodness.</HI> And tho' it be never so really cross to my <HI>Humor,</HI> and
<PB N="85" REF="003188_0107_0FF0145E47CDC1C8"/>seemingly cross to my <HI>Welfare,</HI> I will take Content∣ment in it; because I will now look upon it as the <HI>Will</HI> of HIM that is infinitely <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good;</HI> the <HI>Will</HI> of HIM that is my <HI>Friend,</HI> my <HI>Father,</HI> my GOD; the <HI>Will</HI> of HIM that hath undertaken the Conduct of all my affairs forever. And, O my <HI>Soul,</HI> O my <HI>Will;</HI> Remember Thou after this never to be disturbed about <HI>future Events,</HI> and always to approve the <HI>present Dealings</HI> of the LORD</Q>.</P>
<P>BEING disposed and resigned as I have written; He formed Resolutions to DELIGHT <HI>in GOD,</HI> after this Manner.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. I will ever <HI>mourn</HI> over the Distempers of my own Heart, which encline me to take an unchast sort of <HI>Delight</HI> in Creatures, in Idols, in Vanities.</P>
<P N="2">2. I will <HI>bless GOD</HI> for those <HI>Afflictions,</HI> for those Dispensations be they never so distressing, by which He is curing these Disorders in me.</P>
<P N="3">3. I will always account my self happy in <HI>the Favor of GOD;</HI> altho' I should have no Earthly Thing to give me any Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="4">4. I will reckon any <HI>Opportunities</HI> for my being bro't into a <HI>Converse with GOD,</HI> as Treasures to be preferred above all Riches.</P>
<P N="5">5. I will never be any other than in a restless <HI>Dis∣quiet</HI> of Soul, until I find all my <HI>Ends</HI> to be entire∣ly swallowed up in <HI>the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I will relish <HI>all my Enjoyments</HI> even to my very <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink</HI> mainly, and if I can <HI>meerly,</HI> under the Notion of my being by them assisted in the <HI>Knowledge</HI> or the <HI>Service</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P N="7">7. I will endeavor to be continually abounding in the <HI>Thot's</HI> of GOD; nor would I be ordinarily one waking <HI>Quarter of an Hour</HI> wholly destitute of them.</P>
<P N="8">8. It shall be my Measure to wait upon GOD, in all the Ways of his <HI>Worship,</HI> in which I may have Communion with HIM, especially in frequent <HI>Pray∣ers</HI> unto HIM.</P>
<P>LORD, Assist me, Accept me, Delight in me.</P></Q>
<P N="2"><PB N="86" REF="003188_0108_0FF0145FF4C3ACD8"/>
2. <HI>CLOSING with CHRIST, Accepting HIS Righteousness, Loving HIS Glory, and Living by Faith in HIM.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I find him one Day thus renewing his <HI>Closure</HI> with the LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>HE considered that GOD had offered CHRIST unto him; altho' he was a sinful and wretched Creature, and <HI>because</HI> he was so: And therefore it was his Duty to take HIM.</P>
<P>HE then examined, whether there was no <HI>Reserve,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight herein prove destructive to his Soul. He sought unto the LORD, that HE would <HI>search</HI> him, <HI>try</HI> him, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whether there were any <HI>way of Wicked∣ness</HI> in him. He found the Things, of which he had most Reason to be jealous were <HI>Worldly Honours and Carnal Pleasures;</HI> and therefore he thus renounced them.</P>
<Q><P>LORD, I give my <HI>Name</HI> unto THEE; If THOU wilt have it reproached, I am content: Only give me thy CHRIST, and I shall be satisfied. Yea, I will seek the <HI>Honor</HI> of <HI>Thy Name,</HI> whether the Honor of <HI>my own</HI> be advantaged or prejudiced by my doing so.</P>
<P>LORD, if any of my <HI>Delights</HI> are <HI>sinful,</HI> or as far as they are sinful I utterly <HI>forego</HI> them, and be∣seech THEE to make me abhor them: JESUS CHRIST my LORD is better to me than any of them, than all of them. If they are <HI>lawful,</HI> yet will I leave them, when either the <HI>Command</HI> or the <HI>Glory</HI> of my LORD calls me another way.</P>
<P>AND he added, 'Now I believe the LORD is <HI>mine</HI> and I am <HI>His:</HI> He will carry on his Kingdom in my Soul in spite of all Oppositions whatsoever: I leave all the weighty Affairs of it with HIM for ever and ever.</P></Q>
<P>IN Prosecution of this Action of <HI>Closing with CHRIST,</HI> no Man or Book show'd him the way; but he tho't the HOLY SPIRIT was his <HI>Teacher,</HI> and that by HIM he was led on to the most explicit Procedure in it.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="003188_0109_0FF01462A246F2B8"/>
IN a different Day from the former, I perceive that he used such Words as these before his REDEE∣MER.</P>
<P><Q>O my dear LORD; Thy FATHER has committed my Soul into Thy Hands: There is a <HI>Covenant of Redemption</HI> in which I am concerned: I know my <HI>Election</HI> by my <HI>Vocation,</HI> and my Concernment in that <HI>Covenant,</HI> by my being made willing to come under the Shadow of thy Wings in <HI>the Covenant of Grace.</HI> Now in that ancient <HI>Covenant</HI> the FATHER said unto the SON, <HI>Such a Soul there is that I will bring into thy Fold, and Thou shalt undertake for that Soul, as a sufficient and an eternal SAVIOUR.</HI> Wherefore I am now in thy Hands, O my LORD: Thy FATHER has put me there, and I have put my self there; O save me, heal me, work for me and in me the good Pleasure of thy Goodness.</Q></P>
<P>AND a little after I read as follows;</P>
<P><Q>LORD, I have been leaving my Soul with my LORD JESUS CHRIST; and THOU hast bid me to <HI>believe</HI> I shall be saved by HIM. LORD, I do <HI>believe</HI> that there never came a miserable Soul unto CHRIST in vain, and I <HI>believe</HI> that I my self shall not find it in vain. He will <HI>do great Things</HI> for me. He has done enow already to leave me with∣out any Cause of Repenting that I have with so much Agony of Soul come unto HIM. But I <HI>be∣lieve,</HI> that he hath <HI>more</HI> still to do for me. Having been the <HI>Author</HI> he will be the <HI>Finisher</HI> of my <HI>Faith.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. ONE special Character upon the <HI>Experiences</HI> of his Life, was the great and clear Application he had made unto the <HI>Righteousness of CHRIST</HI> for his <HI>Justification</HI> before the Holy GOD.</P>
<P>I cannot well entertain my Readers with an Article of more Importance than this; I will therefore tran∣scribe a few <HI>select Passages</HI> from his Memorials, which are worthy of a more than ordinary Considera∣tion and Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="003188_0110_0FF01465501CB9B0"/>
AT one Time he writes thus;</P>
<Q><P>IN the former Part of this Day, I humbled myself before the LORD with inexpressible Agony of Soul for all the <HI>Filthiness</HI> of my Heart and Life: I did with Tears bewail my sinfulness before the LORD: and submitting my self unto the Divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> which might uncontrolably make me a <HI>Vessel of Dishonour</HI> and an Instance of Confusion: I further acknowledged that the Divine <HI>Righteousness</HI> added to Sovereignty had farther Advantages to proceed against me, and make me a dreadful Monument of <HI>Divine Displeasure.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE I was in the midst of my disconsolate Re∣flections, the SPIRIT of the LORD caused me to behold the <HI>Obedience,</HI> the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and the <HI>Sureti∣ship</HI> of my precious REDEEMER, as provided by the FATHER for the Relief of my Distresses: And that good SPIRIT caused me to rely upon it: So that I said with Tears of Joy before the LORD; <HI>Now I know that all my Debts are paid; my GOD will now make no Demand of me, but that I love HIM and praise HIM, and glorify my blessed SAVIOUR for ever. I know it! I know it! And now I will do so forever! I can do no other.</HI></P></Q>
<P>AT another Time;</P>
<P><Q>I experienced an unspeakable Satisfaction of Soul this, Day, when taking part with the LORD against <HI>my Self,</HI> I approved all His <HI>Laws,</HI> and abhor'd my self on the score of my Contrariety to them and Vi∣olation of them; and I justified all the Chastise∣ments that had therefore befallen me: And then with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avished Soul, I felt the LORD assuring me that His <HI>free Grace</HI> would impute unto me the <HI>Righteousness of CHRIST,</HI> and at the same Time <HI>imprint</HI> upon me an holy Disposition to conform unto that <HI>Righteousness</HI> in my own Heart &amp; Life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="003188_0111_0FF01467C30ABB78"/>
AT another thus;</P>
<P><Q>THIS Day my Spirit was exceedingly distressed at the View of my own manifold present and former <HI>Vilenesses,</HI> which I bitterly bewailed before GOD.</Q> — But I find his Humiliations concluded thus;</P>
<P><Q>—AND yet after all this, <HI>I do Believe, LORD Help my Unbelief!</HI> I <HI>Beleeve,</HI> that my precious SAVIOUR our <HI>Immanuel</HI> hath fully obeyed and suffered Thy Will, as a Surety in the Room of Sin∣ners. I <HI>Beleeve,</HI> that the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of this our <HI>Surety</HI> is offered unto my Acceptance, that for the sake of it I may become accepted with GOD. I <HI>Beleeve,</HI> that whenever THOU dost enable me to rely upon this <HI>Righteousness,</HI> THOU dost immediately <HI>absolve</HI> me from all my Guiltiness and pronounce me <HI>a dear Son, a pleasant Child, upon whom THOU wilt surely have Mercy.</HI> And I <HI>Beleeve</HI> that the Greatness of my Sins does nothing to render me uncapable of this free and rich <HI>Grace</HI> of Heaven. O my GOD, in this <HI>Belief</HI> I cast my self at the Feet of JESUS CHRIST: <HI>There</HI> will I ly waiting, looking, assured to receive thy Favors.</Q> Thus this <HI>Child of</HI> ABRAHAM <HI>Beleeved, and it was counted to him for Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT was the <HI>Heaven</HI> of the Doctor's Soul, This he chose and beg'd, to be made <HI>an Instrument of ex∣hibiting the Glory of CHRIST</HI> unto HIS People, of inviting and inducing others to glorify HIM.</P>
<P>HE received a Letter once, a short Letter from a very Religious Man, which had this Passage in it.</P>
<P><Q>YOU'L pardon my troubling you with a Line or two to thank you for your <HI>Maschil, [the Title of a Book the Doctor had published.]</HI> which I think may be called <HI>Mictam,</HI> as well as <HI>Maschil.</HI> You help me to this Tho't; How full of Excellency is the glorified Man the LORD JESUS CHRIST;
<PB N="90" REF="003188_0112_0FF0146A079C5958"/>if by His HOLY SPIRIT He so fills one of His Ad∣mirers, that He is enabled to fill a Book with such excellent Things</Q></P>
<P>'TIS impossible to express the satisfaction of Soul, which the sight of this Passage raised in the Doctor. That holy ones, whose Hearts are set upon glorifying JESUS CHRIST, should by any Thing of CHRIST in Him, be led into the Contemplation of His Glories! This, This He looked upon as the highest Pitch of His Felicity: He tho't of, he aspired unto nothing higher than this throughout Eternal Ages. It ra∣vished him, when he saw the good GOD beginning to grant him this Felicity. He despised the Diadems of Emperors in Comparison with it; and cried out with a Rapture, greater than that of ARCHMEDES <HI>I am happy! I am happy! LORD, I am swallowed up with the Extasies of Thy Love!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I shall recite some very singular Methods of his maintaining a <HI>Life by the Faith of the SON of GOD:</HI> and, because it is impossible to use Words more ex∣pressive and weighty, I shall chuse rather to produce the Doctor's own Words than my own.</P>
<Q><P>HAVING entertained a right and clear Appre∣hension of my great SAVIOUR; and His glorious Person, as the Eternal Son of GOD incarnate and inthroned in my JESUS being somewhat understood with me: and beholding the Infinite GOD as com∣ing to me and meeting with me in this blessed <HI>Me∣diator;</HI> The Thot's of Him are become exceeding frequent with me. I count it a Fault, if my Mind be many Minutes together without some <HI>Thoughts</HI> that have in them a Tincture of Piety: But I have learnt the Way of interesting my SAVIOUR in the Tho'ts: And I feel an Impatience raised in me, if I have been many Minutes without some <HI>Tho'ts</HI> of Him. I fly to Him on multitudes of Oc∣sions every Day, and am impatient if many Minutes have passed without some Recourse to Him.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="003188_0113_0FF0146CAB521E50"/>
EVER now and then I bestow a Rebuke upon my self, <HI>Why have I been so long without some Tho'ts on my lovely SAVIOUR? How can I bear to keep at any Distance from HIM?</HI> I then look up to my SAVIOUR; <HI>O my dear SAVI∣OUR, Draw near unto me: Oh! Come down to dwell in my Soul, and help me to form some Tho'ts wherein I shall enjoy</HI> THEE!</P>
<P>UPON this I set my self to form some Tho'ts on my most amiable SAVIOUR, His <HI>Glories,</HI> His <HI>Me∣rits,</HI> His <HI>Pattern,</HI> His <HI>Maxims,</HI> what HE <HI>has done,</HI> and what HE <HI>will do</HI> for us. I find the Subject infinitely inexhaustible.— And after I have been in the <HI>Day</HI> thus employed, I fall asleep at <HI>Night</HI> perpetually in the midst of some Meditation on the <HI>Glory</HI> of my SAVIOUR; usually on a <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> where that Glory is mentioned. So I <HI>Sleep in JESUS!</HI> And when I wake in the <HI>Night,</HI> I do <HI>on my Bed seek Him that my Soul does Love:</HI> Still in the <HI>Night</HI> the <HI>Desires of my Soul</HI> carry me to Him in Tho'ts on the Subject which I fell asleep with.</P>
<P>I find that where CHRIST comes, a wondrous <HI>Light, Life</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> comes with Him, together with a <HI>Strength</HI> to go thro' Services and Sufferings. The <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> to which I am intro∣duced by this Way of Living, 'tis better to me than all the Enjoiments of this World. All the <HI>Riches</HI> of this World appear contemptible Things unto me, while I have the <HI>unsearchable Riches of CHRIST</HI> thus bro't into my Possession. And all <HI>the Glory of this World</HI> would not encline me to forego this way of Living.</P>
<P><HI>NOW, O my dear JESUS, I know, I have an internal Witness, that THOU art the SON of GOD and the SAVIOUR of the World.</HI></P>
<P>CONCERNING this Matter I have had a Contem∣plation which had a most melting Efficacy on me.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="003188_0114_0FF0146E4B15D848"/>
WHEN <HI>the Cloud of Glory,</HI> which was the SHE∣CHINAH that had our SAVIOUR with the <HI>An∣gels of his Presence</HI> dwelling in it, came down and filled the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, what a <HI>grateful Spectacle</HI> was it, and what Acclamations did it raise in the Spectators? A godly Man is a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD; a <HI>living Temple;</HI> dearer to Him than any Temple of <HI>mere Matter,</HI> tho' the most splendid and costly in the World. And our SAVIOUR comes into an <HI>Heart</HI> which is continually instructing, reforming and solacing it self by <HI>thinking</HI> on Him. O <HI>Heart</HI> panting after thy SAVIOUR; so kind is He, so very kind, that even at the Call of a <HI>Tho't</HI> He will come in unto Thee! A <HI>Temple</HI> so filled with <HI>the Glory of the LORD</HI> is unseen to the standers by, to <HI>Flesh and Blood.</HI>— The <HI>Life</HI> of the pious Man is <HI>hid with CHRIST in GOD:</HI> It is an <HI>hidden Life.</HI> But GOD sees the Temple with Pleasure. The SAVIOUR who <HI>knoweth all Things</HI> is pleased with the sight. His <HI>Angels</HI> make their Acclamations upon it.</P>
<P>BUT that I may set this important Matter, yet in a fuller Light I shall be more punctual and par∣ticular in my Account.</P>
<P>I behold the Infinite GOD in His Eternal SON assuming the Man JESUS, into such an intimate and conscious Union with Him, that in my SAVIOUR I now see a GOD-MAN, and a MAN, who has <HI>the Fulness of the GOD-HEAD personally dwelling in Him.</HI></P>
<P>IN this GOD-MAN I behold all possible Provi∣sion for the happy Return of <HI>Man</HI> unto GOD, and all possible Encouragement unto <HI>Man</HI> to seek and look for such an Happiness.</P>
<P>AS this my SAVIOUR is very GOD, and my <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> in Him is all animated from that Consideration; so, being one GOD with the FA∣THER and SPIRIT, who thro' Him communicate
<PB N="93" REF="003188_0115_0FF01470D127C110"/>themselves to me, I consider my self as coming to GOD in Him and conversing with the whole GOD-HEAD in my more immediately <HI>having to do with Him.</HI></P>
<P>THE first Thing I do, is to accept the <HI>Offers</HI> which this wonderful SAVIOUR makes to me of be∣ing <HI>mine</HI> and bringing me to GOD. I hear Him graciously offering to make me <HI>Righteous</HI> &amp; <HI>Holy,</HI> reconcile me to GOD, quicken me to Live unto Him, and <HI>work in me that which shall be well-plea∣sing</HI> before Him. I feel Him so apprehending of me that He disposes and enables me to give an hearty, joyful, thankful <HI>Consent</HI> unto these <HI>Pro∣posals of Grace;</HI> and in consenting to them, I enter∣tain a <HI>comfortable Perswasion</HI> of my kind Recep∣tion with Him; I think it my Duty to be <HI>well persuaded,</HI> that He <HI>will surely do me Good.</HI></P>
<P>AND now what remains is, that as I <HI>worship GOD in the Spirit,</HI> so I may <HI>rejoice in CHRIST JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE in the first Place I ask it of the glorious GOD with the Importunity, that having CHRIST <HI>concerned</HI> for me, I may also have HIM <HI>poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing</HI> of me; That I may have Skill, Will and Help from Heaven to <HI>converse</HI> with HIM conti∣nually; That I may be so well of it as to keep con∣tinually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alling HIM into my <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and feeding upon HIM. I have declared unto the LORD, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> HIM would grant me <HI>this Felicity,</HI> I cared not what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me; I am willing and ready to en∣counter any Thing that HE shall please to order for me.</P>
<P>MY Life is full of <HI>Sacrifices:</HI> But that which car∣ries me well thro' them all is this Consideration; That <HI>While I have CHRIST, I have enough; I can rejoyce in</HI> HIM <HI>while I have nothing else left unto me!</HI></P>
<P>BY the faithful Dispensations of GOD I have been brought to this, That I feel my self <HI>dead</HI> unto all <HI>Creatures.</HI> I have employ'd the <HI>Sacrificing Stroke</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="003188_0116_0FF01473A3C3F1E0"/>upon all my Enjoyments. My <HI>Serviceableness</HI> to the Kingdom of my SAVIOUR was the <HI>last Thing</HI> that in <HI>my Death to all Things here below</HI> I parted with; The Thing which I could <HI>least</HI> of all part with: But this <HI>Darling,</HI> which I would fain have had saved <HI>from the Power of the Dog,</HI> I have also <HI>Sacrificed.</HI> I have submitted unto it that the Ever-Blessed ONE should not only make me <HI>vile</HI> among His People, but also utterly lay me aside from do∣ing any more <HI>Services for His Kingdom in the World.</HI> — I have been entirely <HI>dead</HI> unto every Thing else, and have had nothing but this <HI>one Thing</HI> left unto me, <HI>That I may have my JESUS not only</HI> doing <HI>for me, but also</HI> dwelling <HI>in me; and enabling me perpetually to feed and live upon</HI> HIM. This will be <HI>enough.</HI> I care not if I am stript of every Thing else, if I may but enjoy <HI>this Felicity.</HI></P>
<P>IN pursuance of <HI>this Felicity,</HI> 'tis not easy for me to delineate or enumerate <HI>the Methods of Con∣versing with my only SAVIOUR,</HI> wherein I have been instructed of GOD. And it is impossible for me to express the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> that irradiates and re∣plenishes my Mind upon the Discoveries of any <HI>new Methods</HI> for it. No Affluence of any <HI>Worldly Wealth,</HI> no, nor any Advances in any <HI>Sciences</HI> could so transport and ravish me!</P>
<P>THE Blessedness of the <HI>Heavenly World</HI> lies in our <HI>being with CHRIST;</HI> and by being <HI>with the LORD,</HI> and <HI>beholding His Glory</HI> in <HI>precious Thoughts</HI> of HIM here, I apprehend my self even in <HI>Heaven upon Earth:</HI> And indeed the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> the <HI>Joy; Strength</HI> and <HI>Purity</HI> with which it fills my Mind carries a <HI>Foretast</HI> and <HI>Earnest</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> in it.</P>
<P>I soar up to an inexpressible Contemplation on my SAVIOUR, as the <HI>Wisdom of GOD,</HI> who is the <HI>Archetype</HI> of the whole <HI>Creation,</HI> and in whom there are the original <HI>Ideas</HI> of all that is produced
<PB N="95" REF="003188_0117_0FF014770333ABF0"/>by His Hands in the World, even that <HI>Platform</HI> and <HI>Substance,</HI> of which all Creatures are but the <HI>Issues</HI> and the <HI>Shadows.</HI></P>
<P>I am hence wondrously reconciled unto my ap∣proaching <HI>Death,</HI> inasmuch as going from <HI>Creatures</HI> here, I go to Him in whom I shall find all that I leave and infinitely more.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time I am sure, that whatever I find <HI>amiable</HI> or <HI>comfortable</HI> in any <HI>Creatures</HI> here, is much more to be found in Him.</P>
<P>HENCE when I see any Thing that is <HI>amiable</HI> in any <HI>Creatures,</HI> I commonly fly away from them to my SAVIOUR and think, <HI>How great is His Good∣ness and his Beauty!</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I find any Thing that is <HI>comfortable</HI> in any <HI>Creatures,</HI> I commonly hasten away unto my SAVIOUR, and think, <HI>What Benefits will flow from Him to me?</HI></P>
<P>UPON the <HI>withdraw</HI> of any <HI>Creatures,</HI> or when any desireable <HI>Enjoyments</HI> are witheld or taken from me, I think, <HI>What is it that would recommend these Things unto me?</HI> And I presently find my SA∣VIOUR commended unto me by such and more de∣sirable Qualities. In his being <HI>mine</HI> I find every Loss repaired abundantly! Dead unto every Thing but my SAVIOUR, I thus express my Sentiments;</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Delights</HI> of <HI>this World.</HI>— Such <HI>De∣lights</HI> as I tast in the mere Tendencies of <HI>Nature,</HI> I would in the Taste of them think, <HI>The Will of GOD, expressed in the Nature of His Works is thus complied with. But, Oh, What shall I find in the Infinite GOD Himself upon my going back unto Him!—</HI> Those <HI>Delights</HI> which are most helpful to me in seeing and serving of GOD are those which I would have the most Value for: And even my <HI>Appetites</HI> for my <HI>Food</HI> particularly shall be so
<PB N="96" REF="003188_0118_0FF014798CC31ED0"/>regulated.— But I know of no <HI>Delights</HI> compara∣ble to those which I take in Communion with my SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Riches of this World.</HI>— I use no <HI>Labor,</HI> I have no <HI>Desire</HI> to obtain <HI>temporal Riches:</HI> They appear to me very contemptible. My <HI>Riches</HI> are my Opportunities <HI>to do Good,</HI> and those <HI>Illumina∣tions</HI> of my Mind which furnish me for it.— In my SAVIOUR I have <HI>unsearchable Riches,</HI> and in my Fruition of Him I have a full supply for all my Wants.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Honors of this World.</HI>— My Abhorrence of having the great GOD robbed on my Account, by People gazing on <HI>me</HI> without being led thro' me to <HI>Him,</HI> renders all the <HI>Honours</HI> in the <HI>Praise of Men</HI> very distasteful to me. I do nothing to gain Honors for my self; and if I do secure any Thing of <HI>Esteem</HI> or of <HI>Station,</HI> it shall be purely for the Interest of GOD.— If I be accepted with my SA∣VIOUR and employ'd in Work for His <HI>Kingdom</HI> and have His <HI>Image</HI> imprinted on me: Here are all the <HI>Honors</HI> that I wish for.</P>
<P>I go over the <HI>afflictive Things</HI> with which my Life is all embittered (and I make the fame Salleys towards CHRIST upon the Arrival of any <HI>new Affliction</HI>) I repair to my JESUS: I realize not only His <HI>Hand,</HI> but also His <HI>Love</HI> in fending the <HI>Trouble.</HI> I see my SAVIOUR once encountring the same <HI>Trouble,</HI> and I am heartily pleas'd at my <HI>Conformity</HI> to Him. I see how <HI>patiently</HI> and with what <HI>Views</HI> He bore the <HI>Trouble,</HI> and I wish to be <HI>like</HI> Him. I consider what is that <HI>Good</HI> which this <HI>Trouble</HI> deprives me of, and I see the same <HI>Good,</HI> and what is infinitely <HI>better,</HI> laid up in my SAVIOUR; and I am satisfied. The <HI>Tho'ts</HI> of my SAVIOUR I forever find sweetning the <HI>bitter Waters</HI> of <HI>Marah</HI> to me. I find Him <HI>the Comforter</HI> that always <HI>re∣lieves my Soul,</HI> when I have Him <HI>near</HI> unto me.</P>

<HI>HOW many, O LORD, are the Tho'ts,</HI> which I form in my Mind concerning THEE! The <HI>Occasions</HI> on which, the <HI>Contrivances</HI> with which, I cherish the <HI>Tho'ts cannot be reckoned up in Order.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I see any Thing <HI>excellent</HI> in any <HI>Man,</HI> it leads me to <HI>Tho'ts</HI> on the superior Excellencies in my SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Qualities</HI> of the various <HI>Animals</HI> which I happen to have before me, put me in Mind of the admirable Qualities by which my SAVIOUR is en∣deared unto me.</P>
<P>WHEN I see People <HI>miserable</HI> in any Point, it raises in me some <HI>Tho'ts</HI> on the <HI>Miseries,</HI> from which I am delivered by my SAVIOUR, and my <HI>Obligations</HI> to my Deliverer.</P>
<P>WHAT are the Uses of my <HI>Garments</HI> to the <HI>Parts</HI> that are covered with them? Of such <HI>Uses</HI> is my SAVIOUR to my Spirit, with the <HI>Tho'ts</HI> of which I have adored Him.</P>
<P>WHAT is there in the <HI>Diets</HI> of my Table to ren∣der them agreable unto me? <HI>Analag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Proper∣ties</HI> I discern in my SAVIOUR; and the <HI>Tho'ts</HI> thereof give me an exquisite Relish of Him.</P>
<P>I durst not let my Mind ly fallow as I walk the <HI>Streets.</HI> I rebuke my self with heavy Complaints <HI>(and I make my Moan to Heaven)</HI> if I have gone many steps without some struggle to pull down the <HI>Thot's</HI> of my SAVIOUR into my Soul. I have compelled the <HI>Signs</HI> in the <HI>Streets</HI> to point me unto something in my SAVIOUR that should be <HI>tho't</HI> upon. When I have been at a loss for fresh <HI>Tho'ts</HI> on Him, it has been but casting my Eye on the <HI>Shops</HI> of either side, and from the <HI>Varieties</HI> in them, I have had something of my SAVIOUR suggested unto me.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="003188_0120_0FF0148035321678"/>
ENQUIRIES after <HI>News</HI> are made with Frequency, with Eagerness: I am grown very Cold in such Things: My Concern for them and Pleasure in them is very much extinguished. Some <HI>new Tho'ts</HI> of HIM shall be the <HI>News▪</HI> after which I shall be still most enquiring. Here I have any <HI>Curiosity</HI> gratified a thousand Times more than in the <HI>News</HI> of the <HI>common Occurrences</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>I have sometimes an <HI>Expectation</HI> of some <HI>Satis∣faction</HI> arriving to me, and a little of <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Impatience</HI> in it. I re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und it: I have done expec∣ting any good Things from <HI>this World:</HI> my <HI>Tho'ts</HI> usually are, <HI>What is the Good of that which I ex∣pect? O my Soul, All of this Good Thou hast al∣ready in thy SAVIOUR.</HI></P>
<P>I have in my Study a very <HI>easy Chair:</HI> When I am going to repose my self in it, it is a common Re∣flection with me, <HI>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul; O my JESUS, Thou art the Rest of my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>ON the LORD'S Day I would <HI>enter into the Rest of GOD.</HI> That I may <HI>Sabbatize</HI> aright I hear my SAVIOUR inviting of me, <HI>Come unto me, and I will give you Rest.</HI> On this Day I try to make a par∣ticular Application of that Invitation. I get my Mind filled this Day with as many <HI>Tho'ts</HI> of my SAVIOUR as may be: Which <HI>Tho'ts</HI> in general have a Tendency to convey a sweet <HI>Rest</HI> unto the Soul that entertains them. And more particularly, If I happen to <HI>think</HI> of any Thing that may be <HI>un∣easy</HI> to me, I presently seek a sweet <HI>Rest</HI> for my Soul in JESUS CHRIST as being and as doing what will be a Relief of that <HI>Uneasiness.</HI> Yea, I some∣times now cast an Eye on the <HI>uncomfortable Things</HI> which give a Disturbance to my <HI>Rest</HI> in this World, on purpose that I may immediately take my Flights to something in CHRIST, that shall show me a <HI>plen∣teous Redemption</HI> from them. So <HI>I rejoice in the LORD again &amp; again,</HI> and so I find <HI>His Rest is glorious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="003188_0121_0FF01481D103CDF0"/>
EVERY Day I find in my self such Imperfections; Infirmities, <HI>Miscarriages;</HI> as cause me to humble and <HI>abhor my self</HI> before the LORD. Now I em∣ploy my own <HI>Humiliations</HI> for <HI>Scaffolds</HI> from whence I would raise the Praises of my admirable SAVIOUR. Whatever I see <HI>mean</HI> &amp; <HI>vile</HI> in my self, I would pro∣ceed from thence to <HI>think,</HI> How much the <HI>Reverse</HI> of this is to be seen in <HI>JESUS.</HI> From the <HI>Loath∣ing</HI> of my self I would pass on to the <HI>Loving</HI> of my SAVIOUR. And so among other Consequences; I shall also affect my self with the only <HI>Righteousness</HI> which I have to <HI>plead that I may be justified before GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Pagans</HI> had their <HI>many gods,</HI> and for one Blessing they hop'd from one of their gods, for ano∣ther from another. Now all the <HI>Glories</HI> which I find them dividing among their <HI>many gods,</HI> I ascribe unto my SAVIOUR who is <HI>the true GOD and Eternal Life;</HI> and look for every Blessing from HIM alone.</P>
<P>IN my conversing with my SAVIOUR; I go thro' many Portions of <HI>Scriptures</HI> which <HI>testify of Him;</HI> especially the <HI>Psalms,</HI> employing a <HI>Verse</HI> or a <HI>Clause</HI> at a Time for the Subject of my <HI>Meditation,</HI> when every Night I <HI>fall a sleep in JESUS.</HI> Now the <HI>Psalms</HI> are filled with <HI>Prayers,</HI> wherein I find my Condition so suited that I cannot express it better before the LORD. But when I present such <HI>Prayers</HI> unto the LORD it proves a vast Encouragement and Consolation unto me, and therein I maintain a most sweet <HI>Fellowship</HI> with my SAVIOUR, when I think; <HI>This very Prayer was once presented by my SA∣VIOUR unto HIS Eternal FATHER: My SAVIOUR once pray'd at this Rate &amp; found Acceptance: I pray but as my SAVIOUR taught me and as HE did before me: Certainly such a Prayer will be grateful unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, IN my admirable SAVIOUR accomplish∣ing an <HI>Eternal Redemption</HI> for us, I see glorious
<PB N="100" REF="003188_0122_0FF01483D401B828"/>Transactions and Occurrences. Now I am follici∣tous to feel the Power, the heavenly <HI>Power</HI> of these Things upon me, that I may come into an holy <HI>Fellowship with them,</HI> and with Him in them. This I take for a <HI>Token</HI> to me, that my SAVIOUR has been concerned for <HI>me</HI> is these Parts of his potent <HI>Mediation.</HI></P>
<P>I see GOD becoming a <HI>Man</HI> in my SAVIOUR, I feel the <HI>Power</HI> of it in my <HI>returning</HI> to GOD and meeting with Him in my SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>I see my SAVIOUR leading an <HI>hidden Life,</HI> and passing thro' <HI>obscure Circumstances</HI> while He sojour∣ned among us: I feel the <HI>Power</HI> of it in my being willing to have my <HI>Walk with GOD</HI> carried on with all possible <HI>Concealment</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>I see my SAVIOUR doing illustrious <HI>Miracles</HI> upon the Children of Men in their Distresses: I feel the <HI>Power</HI> of it in my own Experience of the <HI>Di∣vine Works</HI> upon my Soul, answerable to what was in those ancient Operations of the LORD.</P>
<P>I see my SAVIOUR <HI>dying</HI> for my Sin, <HI>dying</HI> on the Cross: I feel the <HI>Power</HI> of it in the <HI>Death</HI> of my sinful Dispositions, my <HI>Dying</HI> unto <HI>Creatures,</HI> my having for <HI>this World</HI> the Sentiments of a Man hanging upon a Cross.</P>
<P>I see my SAVIOUR in His <HI>Resurrection</HI> trium∣phing over <HI>the Powers of Darkness,</HI> and entring into a <HI>New Life</HI> wherein HE <HI>lives for ever more:</HI> I feel the <HI>Power</HI> of it in my rising and getting up out of my <HI>Lifeless Darkness,</HI> and my coming into a <HI>New Life,</HI> wherein I shall pursue the Designs of PIETY, <HI>quickned</HI> with an <HI>Everlasting Principle</HI> of it, to which I was once a Stranger.</P></Q>
<P>THIS may be enough to illustrate <HI>the Way of Living</HI> in which the GOD of all Grace enabled Dr. MATHER to proceed. In this <HI>Way of Living,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="003188_0123_0FF01487B45D49E8"/>He waited to see what his SAVIOUR would do for Him: Thus <HI>leaning on the Beloved</HI> of his Soul He would <HI>go up from the Wilderness</HI> of this World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>HIS Occasional Thoughts and Ejaculatory Prayers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT Dr. MATHER might <HI>walk in the fear of the LORD all the Day long,</HI> his Mind was continu∣ally conversing with GOD and preparing for Heaven in <HI>Occasional Prayers and Meditations.</HI> His Opinion and Persuasion concerning <HI>such Tho'ts</HI> was, that while He was forming of <HI>them</HI> He was directly, nearly, sweet answering the <HI>Grand End</HI> of his Life, which is to <HI>Glorify GOD and acknowledge HIM;</HI> That He was also therein <HI>rectifying</HI> his Soul and <HI>ripening</HI> it for the <HI>Employments</HI> and Enjoyments of the Heavenly World.</P>
<P>I shall now tell you some of the Rules which He prescribed unto Himself to awaken the <HI>Thor'ts</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> of a <HI>Religious Mind</HI> on the <HI>Occasions</HI> which frequently occurred.</P>
<P>WHEN He heard a <HI>Clock strike,</HI> He could not help thinking and wishing, that He might <HI>so number</HI> his <HI>Days as to apply</HI> his <HI>Heart to Wisdom;</HI> and that He might so spend every Hour as to be <HI>able to give a good Account</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AT the Winding up of his <HI>Watch,</HI> He bless'd GOD for another Day and desir'd He might spend it in En∣deavours to glorify HIM.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Comfortable Things</HI> He saw any other. Person enjoy He took the Comfort of it, adored <HI>the Goodness of Heaven</HI> and wished for a <HI>right Improve∣ment</HI> of it.</P>
<P>HIS Life was full of <HI>Services:</HI> but on every <HI>one</HI> He would distinctly consider how to do it out of
<PB N="102" REF="003188_0124_0FF0148A00C5AD78"/>Obedience to GOD, how <HI>to glorify and ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> CHRIST, how to <HI>imitate</HI> HIM, and after all what <HI>an unprofitable Servants</HI> He was.</P>
<P>WHEN He dispensed <HI>Kindness</HI> to any Person, He would at the same Time lift up a Prayer for them, that they might not be unmindful of such Duty to HIM as thro' this Kindness they might be invited to.</P>
<P>HE had oftentimes an Opportunity to express a Benignity to <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it Creatures,</HI> either to feed them or make their Condition easy to them: He would do it with Delight and raise two Meditations upon it. "<HI>I am now the Instrument of GOD unto these Crea∣tures; HIS Kindness passes thro' my Hands to them:</HI> And <HI>will not the blessed GOD he as beneficent unto me as I am unto these Creatures? especially if, as they look unto me to be kind unto them, I always look up unto HIM.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he <HI>knocked</HI> at a Door, the Faith of our SAVIOUR'S Promise was awakened in Him, <HI>Knock and it shall he opened unto You.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he mended his <HI>Fire,</HI> it was with a Medita∣tion how his <HI>Heart and Life might be rectified,</HI> and how thro' the Emendations of Divine Grace <HI>His Love and Zeal might flame more agreably.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he put out his <HI>Candle,</HI> it must be done with an Address to <HI>the Father of Lights,</HI> that his <HI>Light might not be put out in Obscure Darkness;</HI> and with a Wish that <HI>when He goes out by Morta∣lity He might enter everlasting Life and Light.</HI></P>
<P>AS he tasted of the several <HI>Fruits</HI> which are the rich Product of <HI>Summer,</HI> he would set Himself to think on some <HI>special Glory</HI> of our SAVIOUR, of which he might by it be lead unto the Contempla∣tion, and so address HIM with a rapturous Confession of it.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="003188_0125_0FF0148B945323E8"/>
IN drinking a Dish of <HI>Tea,</HI> (of which he was a great Admirer) he would take an Occasion for these Tho'ts especially with the Ingenuity of <HI>Occasional Re∣flection</HI> and <HI>agreable Similitude,</HI> that should have many sweet Acknowlegements of the glorious JESUS in them. And whatever <HI>Delight</HI> any of his <HI>Senses</HI> enjoy'd, it was soon sanctified and rendred more de∣lightful by his making such an Improvement of it.</P>
<P>THE Servant of the LORD could say, <HI>Mine Eyes prevent the Night Watches, that I might Meditate in thy Word.</HI> When the Doctor waked in the <HI>Night,</HI> he would impose it as a Law upon Himself ever before he fell asleep again to bring some <HI>Glory of his SAVIOUR</HI> into his Meditations, and have some agreable <HI>Desire of his Soul</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>WHEN he paid what he <HI>ow'd</HI> at any Time, he would reflect on what he <HI>ow'd CHRIST for pay∣ing his Debt tot he Justice of GOD,</HI> and was desi∣rous that he should <HI>owe no Man any thing but Love.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the <HI>Occasions</HI> for the Expressions of <HI>Piety</HI> and Thankfulness, he would affectionately take No∣tice of the <HI>mean Employments</HI> wherein he saw other People occupied. When he saw those whose Business it was to <HI>dig in the Earth,</HI> to sweep <HI>Chimneys,</HI> cleanse the <HI>Kennels,</HI> or drive <HI>the Coach, the Cart or Wheel-barrow,</HI> or exercised in the like <HI>low Degree;</HI> I say, whan he saw those Men, it raised his Heart in Wonders at the Goodness of GOD, which distin∣guished him with nobler Employments.</P>
<P>WHEN he visited a <HI>Sick Person</HI> he would fetch some Admonition relating to the <HI>moral Distempers</HI> in his Heart and Life, analogous to the Circumstances of the diseased Person.</P>
<P>IF any Thing began to raise any Ebullition of <HI>An∣ger</HI> in him, he would endeavor to allay it by think∣ing, <HI>"What Provocations have I given to the great
<PB N="104" REF="003188_0126_0FF0148E2AA6D2C0"/>GOD;</HI> and <HI>what was the Meekness and Wisdom of my blessed JESUS</HI> when he met with Contradiction from Sinners.</P>
<P>WHEN he <HI>washed his Hands,</HI> he must think of the <HI>clean Hands,</HI> as well as <HI>pure Heart,</HI> which be∣long to the Citizens of Zion.</P>
<P>AND when he did so mean an Action as <HI>paring his</HI> Nails, he tho't how he might <HI>lay aside all Super∣fluity of Naughtiness.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES he had kind Presents made him: He would by the <HI>Quality</HI> of the Presents be awakened unto particular <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>Resolutions.</HI> He would think, <HI>What Good Thing should that Man wish, and what Good should he do, whom GOD obli∣ges by bestowing such Things upon</HI> Him? And he would always add a Reflection upon the <HI>Humiliation</HI> of our SAVIOUR who wanted such Things, thro' the Ingratitude of an evil World.</P>
<P>WHENEVER he met with any <HI>Crooked Thing,</HI> he reflected after this manner; <HI>My Will is crossed; but what particular Instance of Disobedience and Con∣tradiction to the Will of GOD should this Affliction lead me to consider of.</HI></P>
<P>HE had for many Years a <HI>Morning Cough:</HI> it every Morning <HI>raised</HI> proper <HI>Dispositions of Piety</HI> in him.</P>
<P>IN managing his <HI>Correspondencies,</HI> He would think, <HI>What honourable Mention can I make of my SA∣VIOUR here,</HI> and <HI>what Service may I do for the Kingdom of my SAVIOUR on this Opportunity?</HI> He afterwards added three Reflections. First; When he was <HI>Sealing</HI> a <HI>Letter</HI> and sending it away, he would with an act of <HI>Resignation</HI> put it over into the Hands of the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> for the Safety and Success of it. Secondly; When he was opening any Letter, he would lift up his Heart to Heaven that
<PB N="105" REF="003188_0127_0FF01491614F5800"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might be <HI>prepared</HI> for whatever was grievous o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> joyful. Thirdly; In his <HI>last Prayers</HI> in his Study at Night before he went to rest, he would call to mind whom he had received any <HI>Letter</HI> from in the Day, and would make particular mention of that Per∣son and pray for suitable Mercies for him.</P>
<P>THUS I have given you a Specimen, which is all I intended, and all you can expect here.</P>
<P N="2">2. BUT that so the Doctor, <HI>whether</HI> he <HI>eat or drank or whatever</HI> he <HI>did,</HI> might <HI>do all to the Glory of GOD;</HI> he was very constant in <HI>Ejaculatory Prayers and Praises.</HI></P>
<P>THE particular Seasons, in which he was furnish'd with them, were as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE he set upon any signal <HI>Act of Worship,</HI> an <HI>Ejaculation</HI> must ask for help in that Act.</P>
<P>WHILE he was joining with another in <HI>Social Praying</HI> he would fix his wandring Heart by annex∣ing such a pertinent <HI>Ejaculation</HI> unto every Sentence that was uttered as, <HI>"LORD, I own it,</HI> or <HI>LORD I ask it!</HI></P>
<P>IN hearing of a <HI>Sermon</HI> he would tack a serious <HI>Ejacul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion</HI> upon every <HI>Text</HI> or <HI>Head</HI> that should be proposed in it.</P>
<P>BEFORE his Preaching of a <HI>Sermon,</HI> he revolved it in a Meditation that should turn every part of it into some <HI>Ejaculation.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Course of <HI>daily Meditation,</HI> which he car∣ried on, had agreable <HI>Ejaculations</HI> intermixed in the whole Exercise.</P>
<P>Numberless <HI>Ejaculations</HI> at the <HI>LORD's Table</HI> he tho't highly seasonable.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Singing a Psalm</HI> and <HI>Reading a Chapter,</HI> as he went along he would form agreable <HI>Ejaculations</HI> out of every Verse.</P>
<P>WHEN in his liesure Minutes he fetch'd <HI>Lessons</HI> from the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD, he would not dismiss them until he had put them into proper <HI>Ejaculations.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="003188_0128_0FF01493B0BCF978"/>
WHEN any new <HI>Comfort</HI> was conferred on him, he had this Ejaculation, <HI>"LORD, Help <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y this Talent for thy Glory".</HI> And when any new <HI>Trouble</HI> was inflicted on him, he prayed, <HI>"LORD, Help me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear as well as to hear the Rod".</HI></P>
<P>EVERY new matter of <HI>Care</HI> bro't with it new Mat∣ter for his <HI>Prayers:</HI> He thought therefore that the least he could do was to carry a <HI>short Petition</HI> to the LORD; and thus he asked the smile of Heaven upon all that he had to do.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY if any weighty <HI>Question</HI> was propoun∣ded unto him, he would not answer it until he briefly address'd Heaven for a <HI>right Answer.</HI></P>
<P>HE had often <HI>"LORD, Save thy People"</HI> in his Mind; such <HI>Ejaculations</HI> for the Church of GOD, he often used.</P>
<P>HE liked that good Rule which one proposed for himself, <HI>When I think of my Friend, let it be with a praying Tho't.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he was informed of any Neighbour in <HI>Af∣fliction,</HI> he thought it bespoke his charitable <HI>Eja∣culations.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE he <HI>walke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Room</HI> with his Mind otherwise unemployed, he would not, lose the Time, but use his <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as well as <HI>Grace</HI> in contriving some suitable <HI>Blessing</HI> for such and such as were before him; and then he would form it into an <HI>Ejaculation</HI> for them. Thus none, but HE that <HI>knows the Thot's afar off,</HI> were acquainted with the secret pious Motions of his Soul.</P>
<P>—So much for <HI>Ejaculatory Prayers</HI> for the present.</P>
<P>THE Seasons for <HI>Ejaculatory Praises</HI> you may take as follows, <HI>vis.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Occasions</HI> which occur'd for his <HI>Prayers,</HI> sometimes too, sollicited for his <HI>Praises.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY <HI>Dispensation</HI> of GOD afforded Matter for such as <HI>Ejaculation</HI> to him.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="003188_0129_0FF01495707CA8A0"/>
ESPECIALLY when any conspicuous <HI>Mercy</HI> was bestowed upon him, he express'd his Gratitude by some grateful <HI>Ejaculation</HI> upon it, such as, <HI>Thou ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good, and Thou dost Good.</HI></P>

THERE is a Passage in the Talmuds (<HI>in Hierosy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.</HI> Fol. 32. 2.) that Rabbi JOSI fasted <HI>eighty Easts</HI> and R.

<P>BUT among those that <HI>have done vertuously</HI> in this Respect, perhaps Dr. MATHER has <HI>excelled them all.</HI></P>
<P>IN my Sermon on my Father, I said, by a very mo∣derate Computation, he kept about <HI>Four hundred and fifty</HI> Fasts: I computed thus, That from his <HI>fourteenth</HI> Year almost unto his Death, he tho't himself <HI>starved</HI> unless he <HI>fasted</HI> once a Month; that he, when con∣cerned in any very great Affair, would also very often keep <HI>Weekly Fasts,</HI> sometimes <HI>two</HI> in a Week; and inasmuch as he kept not Records of <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Fasts</HI> he observed and so I could not exactly number them, I therefore tho't the Number above specified to be a <HI>moderate Computation.</HI></P>
<P>I shall here give you his Frame, his Sentiments and Actions on two or three of his Days of <HI>Fasting</HI> (in his own Words) from which you may judge of the rest.</P>
<P><Q>SETTING apart a Day (the Day past) <HI>for Prayer with Fasting</HI> in my Study; I judged my self before the LORD for my various Transgressions; and in the Distresses of my Soul, beholding my Misery by my Estrangedness from GOD and Exposedness to his Wrath; but believing that the LORD JESUS CHRIST the only Mediator was willing to have

And I profess'd unto Him; that I left my immortal Spirit in his blessed Hands, and that I would expect every part of my Welfare as the fruit of his blessed <HI>Satisfaction</HI> &amp; <HI>Intercession;</HI> and that I would submit unto his glorious Dominion, Power and Wisdom so as never willingly to withdraw from the Regulations of them; but I would fly unto his precious <HI>Blood</HI> for <HI>Pardon</HI> whenever I perceived in my self any Deviations. And I concluded with a triumphant Faith that He would do me Good, and GOD would have no Controversy with me; and that I should after a desireable manner Know, Love and Honour Him; and that I shall find my never dying Soul under the peculiar Care of a mer∣ciful Redeemer in the Times of the greatest Extre∣mity that shall or can ever come unto me</Q>—</P>
<P>—THUS on one Day.</P>
<P>ON another Day he writes thus;</P>
<Q><P>THIS Day having humble my self and judged my self before the LORD for my many Provocations; and <HI>watered my Couch with my Tears</HI> in the Ap∣prehension of my exceeding Vileness; at length Floods of Tears gushed from me in my laying hold on the pardoning Mercy of GOD in JESUS CHRIST. The Spirit of the most High bro't me to a <HI>marvellous Temper</HI> which was to me like the very Suburbs of Heaven, wherein He assured me that <HI>all my Sins were forgiven;</HI> and that his Anger in the sense of which my Soul trembled; should no more burn against me. Upon this I called unto mind the <HI>Names</HI> of as many Persons as I could any ways learn had reproached and injured me; and I most heartily beg'd the GOD of Heaven on the behalf of them one by one, that they might be <HI>blessed
<PB N="112" REF="003188_0134_0FF014A1B6A2D4E8"/>with all the Blessing; of Goodness,</HI> and such Bles∣sings especially as were most suitable for them.</P>
<P>I also besought the LORD that I might never Sin against Him with Will or Design or Delight any more: I profess'd unto Him that I should rejoice to Dy this very Day, if I might be everlastingly deli∣vered from <HI>sinning</HI> against Him: I declared before Him that I was very sure I should be with CHRIST e're long, and joyfully behold his Face in <HI>sinless Glory.</HI></P></Q>
<P>ON another such Day I find in his Papers, <Q>That he did with Plenty of Tears lament his Wretched∣ness: And herein, says he, I was carried forth to declare unto the LORD, that having dishonoured His glorious <HI>Name,</HI> if there were no other way for the <HI>Honor</HI> of it to be recovered except in <HI>my Ruin,</HI> I laid my self down at His holy Feet to be disposed of for ever by Him as He should please. But yet I said, that His Name was <HI>a GOD that would abun∣dantly Pardon,</HI> and that He had provided a way for the <HI>Glory</HI> of it, and that whosoever will accept of Salvation in and thro' CHRIST should upon His Word be sure to have it; and so I concluded with Assurance that the LORD JESUS CHRIST was <HI>interceeding</HI> for me, and that because He had <HI>Liv'd</HI> &amp; <HI>Died</HI> I should not <HI>Dy</HI> but <HI>Live.</HI> And these Motions of Soul in me were accompanied with very rapturous <HI>Hallelujahs,</HI> with Transports of Love and Praise; telling the LORD that now I would be <HI>His</HI> forever, and I longed now to be with my REDEEMER in the Mansions that are above where I shall certainly be; but for <HI>one Reason</HI> I desired to Live a few Days more upon Earth, even that I might <HI>Labour</HI> &amp; <HI>Suffer</HI> for Him, and Serve Him, where I had sinned against Him: And this shall be my Work, all the Day long while I have a Day to live.</Q></P>

THERE was once a Time and a Thing in which the Doctor was full of distress. His Temptations and Difficulties were extraordinary: He thought himself called unto more than ordinary Humiliations, Suppli∣cations and Resignations. In this Time he rarely let a Week pass without setting apart a <HI>Day for Fasting with Prayer</HI> for many <HI>Months</HI> together; and ever now and then he had his <HI>Vigils</HI> for a Conversation with Heaven; and every Day for the most part he had one secret Prayer more than he used to have and lay prostrate in the Dust with Tears before the LORD, yet he tho't it necessary to do something more than all this.</P>
<P>HE had often in his Life kept <HI>two Days of Fasting and Prayer</HI> in <HI>on Week:</HI> But now he was resolved to spend <HI>Three Days</HI> after this manner in his Study, and <HI>beseech the LORD thrice, knocking</HI> at the Door of Heaven for <HI>three Days together;</HI> and he was car∣ried thro' the Undertaking even beyond what his feeble Constitution could have looked for.</P>
<P>HE was desirous that <HI>each Day</HI> should have it's <HI>peculiar Character,</HI> tho' there were many <HI>general Strokes</HI> of Devotion which were common to all the Days.</P>
<P>THE Character of the <HI>first Day</HI> was <HI>Confession</HI> of, and <HI>Contrition</HI> for the Sins which might expose him to the Displeasure of Heaven; (in which he used a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of Things <HI>forbidden and required in the Commandments,</HI> as well as the Ingredients of <HI>Original Sin</HI>) and he petitioned for the Pardon of all thro' the Blood of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE Character of <HI>the second Day</HI> was <HI>Resignati∣on to the Will of GOD</HI> in whatever Sorrows had be∣fallen him, and in the sorrowful things which he could imagine might possibly be inflicted on him He found astonishing Entertainment from Heaven in this Action.</P>
<P>THE singular Character of the <HI>third Day</HI> was <HI>Request;</HI> first for Help under and against all the
<PB N="114" REF="003188_0136_0FF014A7FA2C6CF0"/>Assaults of <HI>Temptations</HI> upon him; and then, for the <HI>Angelical Ministry</HI> to be employ'd on his Behalf and for his Help in those Cases, in which <HI>the Heirs of Salvation</HI> use to be befriended by the <HI>Ministers who do the Pleasure of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>I will now use his own Expressions:— <Q><HI>My Three Days</HI> left me in a very desireable Frame; very fear∣ful of Sinning against GOD, very raised in my tho'ts of CHRIST, and Heaven, and very watchful to do Good and bring forth Fruit unto the LORD.</Q></P>
<Q><P>BUT because an Admission to extraordinary inti∣mate Communion with Heaven uses to be followed with sore <HI>Buffetings</HI> from Satan either by <HI>internal Impressions</HI> or <HI>external Occurrences,</HI> I had a tremb∣ling Expectation of what might follow upon that Intercourse with Heaven to which I had bin newly admitted.</P>
<P><HI>The Evil that I feared came upon me,</HI> but yet I received a marvellous Harvest of the <HI>Three Days.</HI> The Design of them was obtained to Admiration.</P></Q>
<P>I will insert but one more Day of <HI>Prayer with Fasting,</HI> which he kept under some Temptations; on which I find he has entred this Record.</P>
<Q><P>IT was a Day full of astonishing Enjoyments, a Day filled with Resignation, Satisfaction &amp; Heavenly Astonishments. Heaven has as it were been opened unto me this Day. Never did I so long to dy and fly away into Heaven! I have seen and felt <HI>unutter∣able Things,</HI> I have <HI>tasted that the LORD is gracious.</HI> I can by no means relate the Communi∣cations of Heaven to which I have been admitted. I am now sure that the great GOD is <HI>my GOD,</HI> that I stand before HIM in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST, that <HI>no Good shall be with-held from me,</HI> that GOD will use me to glorify HIM greatly, and that I shall be an Object for the Everlasting Triumphs of infinite Grace.</P>

I was scarce able to bear the <HI>Extasies of Divine Love</HI> into which I was raptured. They exhausted my Spirits; they made me faint; they were insup∣portable; I was forced to withdraw from them lest the Raptures should make me swoon away.</P></Q>
<P>I could produce a vast Multitude more of his En∣tertainments, his Tho'ts and Methods on Day's of <HI>Fastings,</HI> but it would swell this Book to too great a Bulk.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come therefore to write of his <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> which were very numerous: I shall collect but <HI>three</HI> Instances out of the many that are before me.</P>
<P>ON one Day he kept, he set himself;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To <HI>recollect</HI> the <HI>merciful Dispensations</HI> of GOD unto him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To consider the <HI>Aggravations</HI> of those <HI>Mercies</HI> in the <HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Freeness</HI> of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To <HI>register</HI> them in his <HI>Memorials.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To <HI>acknowledge</HI> them in his <HI>Devotions.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. To <HI>Contrive</HI> what <HI>Returns</HI> he should make by way of Gratitude to GOD.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>HE writes, I spent the Day in such Exercises, and the sweetness of them with the heavenly <HI>Affla∣tus</HI> they bro't upon my Mind, made me a rich Re∣compence for the Labor of them:</P>
<P>IN the Close of the Day coming to ponder, <HI>What shall I now render to the LORD for all his Benefits?</HI></P>
<P>HIS Tho'ts are thus written down.</P>
<Q><P N="1">I. SHALL I not <HI>love the LORD,</HI> and be constant, fervent, unwearied in serving of HIM? Especially in the Rules I have proposed for my Conversation?</P>
<P N="2">II. SHALL I not endeavor to shine by a <HI>good Example?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. SHALL I not husband &amp; redeem <HI>the Golden Hours,</HI> which I enjoy in the midst of so many <HI>Smi∣ling Providences?</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="116" REF="003188_0138_0FF014ABF78CB018"/>
IV. SHALL I not <HI>every Day</HI> in every Capacity, Relation, Company be contriving, <HI>What can I now and here do for God?</HI> And lay my self out ac∣cordingly?</P>
<P>ON! That GOD would help me thus to do!</P></Q>
<P>ON another of there Thanksgivings he writes thus;</P>
<Q><P>THE Forenoon of this Day I spent;</P>
<P N="1">I. IN acknowledging my own <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eness</HI> before GOD, by which after an aggravated Manner I have become <HI>unworthy</HI> of all that <HI>Goodness and Mercy that has followed me all my days.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. IN acknowledging those <HI>Glories</HI> which belong unto the great GOD as HE is infinitely <HI>excellent in Himself,</HI> and as HE is the <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Governor</HI> of the World, and unto JESUS CHRIST as HE is one <HI>altogether lovely.</HI> — In these Exercises my Heart was bro't to such Frames as would have turn∣ed a <HI>Dungeon</HI> into a Paradise.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Afternoon</HI> I went over the <HI>former Kind∣nesses</HI> of GOD unto my self in my <HI>Tho'ts,</HI> my <HI>Psalms,</HI> my <HI>Praises.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I more especially singled out <HI>three Things</HI> in which I have seen the Favor fo God; viz. An∣swer to <HI>Petitions,</HI> Rescues from <HI>Temptations</HI> and those <HI>Afflictions</HI> by means of which I have enjoyed <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>I essay'd then to bless the LORD for those Favors with which at present I am on every side surrounded, such as,</P>
<P>MY <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Health.</HI></P>
<P>MY Accomplishments in any Points of <HI>Learn∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>MY well furnish'd <HI>Library.</HI></P>
<P>MY Improvement in the Ministry of the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>MY peaceable <HI>Settlement</HI> in a Place of great Op∣portunities to do Good.</P>

MY Enjoyment of my Father to this Day.</P>
<P>THE notable Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wth and Peace of the Flock, over which I am a <HI>Pastor.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING employ'd my Admirations and Adora∣tions upon the Grace from whence these Things do come unto me; I then came to consider the <HI>free Grace</HI> of GOD unto me in,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gift</HI> of CHRIST unto the World.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Offer</HI> of HIM unto <HI>my self</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sense</HI> of the Necessity of CHRIST, GOD has given me.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Union</HI> with HIM to which the Holy SPI∣RIT has bro't me.</P>
<P>AND all the further Operations of the HOLY SPIRIT upon my Soul, by which He is continually making me more <HI>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></P>
<P>I concluded the Day with considering, <HI>What shall I render to the LORD?</HI></P>
<P>I then gave my <HI>self,</HI> my whole <HI>self,</HI> and Powers, Members, Capacities and Interests (which I own'd was the least that I ow'd) unto the LORD.</P>
<P>IN particular I added, That, since I owed all my good Things to the <HI>Compassions</HI> of GOD, I would always be contriving <HI>how to honor HIM,</HI> and would procure some <HI>Testimony</HI> against some com∣mon Evils in the Land which are offensive to HIM.</P>
<P>AND since it was the Mediation of CHRIST un∣to which I owed the Procurement of all, I would preach a Sermon, the Scope of which should be to magnify the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and invite the Minds of Men to an assiduous Contemplation of his Glories.</P></Q>
<P>THE Third and last I shall write of, shall be more particularly described than the rest, because of some∣thing mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> singular and infi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ive in it.</P>

<P><PB N="118" REF="003188_0140_0FF014B1541A6C60"/>
I saw that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> mentioned the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the good <HI>Angels,</HI> about <HI>the Heirs of Salvation</HI> with Frequency; and I saw that my Life had been wondrously signalized by the Ministry of those <HI>An∣gels.</HI> Wherefore loth to be guilty of such an un∣thoughtful Neglect of the <HI>Angels</HI> as the Generality of the Faithful who enjoy the Assistances of those <HI>Heavenly Guardians</HI> are, I devoted this Day to glorify the GOD and Father of my LORD JESUS CHRIST for <HI>the Ministry of ANGELS,</HI> which has notably befriended me unto this very Day. And I expected in this Way not only to render my self more agreable to those <HI>excellent Spirits,</HI> but also to obtain from <HI>their</HI> and <HI>my</HI> LORD a more signal share of their Influence than had ever yet been granted me.</P>
<P>IN the Evening before this Day, I was <HI>amaz'd</HI> when I beheld, but happy that I <HI>plainly</HI> beheld, the happening of several Things that seemed as it were contrived on Purpose to indispose me for the Duties now before me: But I comfortably got over all the Indispositions.</P>
<P>TWILL be needless to relate how many <HI>Hymns</HI> I sang referring to the <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Morning I wrote an Illustration upon a Text about the good <HI>Angels:</HI> And I made my <HI>Family-Offering</HI> suitable to the Design before me.</P>
<P>AND one <HI>Law</HI> which I laid upon my self this Day was, that in all the <HI>Intervals</HI> of more <HI>stated Thinking,</HI> as I passed from one Object to another, I would make <HI>Ejaculatory Thanksgivings</HI> unto the LORD upon all the Occasions which offer'd them∣selves unto me. But how many Scores of <HI>Ejacula∣tions</HI> thus occasionally acknowleging the Greatness and Goodness of GOD passed from me this Day, I cannot reckon.</P>
<P>MY chief Exercise in the Forenoon was, To con∣sider exactly, and with as much of Scripture and
<PB N="119" REF="003188_0141_0FF014B2E5BAFF20"/>Learning as I could, the <HI>Existence,</HI> the <HI>Properties</HI> and the <HI>Relations</HI> of the good Angels; and, the <HI>Honor,</HI> but not <HI>Worship,</HI> due to those benign Spirits: And then to run over the marvellous References to their <HI>Ministry</HI> which I have here and there found scattered in the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD; whether towards <HI>particular Saints</HI> or towards the <HI>Church in General.</HI> These Considerations with a vast Variety took in the chief of the Story of the <HI>Bible</HI> together with the <HI>Apocalyptical</HI> Prophecies, especially in the <HI>Trumpets</HI> and <HI>Vials</HI> wherein <HI>Angels</HI> are concerned. But my Considerations were still directed unto the LORD with my Desires, that HE should forever be mag∣nified and glorified for the Things, in which he had thus commissioned his <HI>Angels</HI> to be his Messengers and his Instruments.</P>
<P>I cannot fully express <HI>the Elevation of Soul</HI> with which I went thro' these noble Exercises; which Exercises at last I concluded with Assurances, that I should one Day come to <HI>praise HIM that se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s upon the Throne and the Lamb</HI> in the Company of his holy <HI>Angels</HI> forever.</P>
<P>IN the Afternoon, I looked over some <HI>Catalogues of Mercies</HI> received from the GOD of Heaven, which I had heretofore entred into my <HI>Diaries;</HI> and by comparing of what I read in the Book of Heaven about <HI>the Agency of the Angels,</HI> I examined, where I might make an Allowance for their subordinate Agency in my own Affairs.</P>
<P>THE main Heads of <HI>Kindness</HI> done for me which the Word of GOD permitted me to count <HI>An∣gelical</HI> were these.</P>
<P N="1">I.

<P><PB N="122" REF="003188_0144_0FF014BB09BA0550"/>
FROM hence I went on to <HI>Supplications</HI> that the great GOD would go on more than ever to employ His <HI>good Angels</HI> for my GOOD, which I also then particularized in many Articles; and that HE also would preserve me from the Illusions and Injuries of <HI>Evil</HI> ones.</P>
<P>I then considered, What <HI>Returns</HI> I should make unto the LORD for the <HI>Benefits,</HI> which I have recei∣ved by His <HI>Angels.</HI> And here I tho't on the Message which an <HI>Angel</HI> bro't from Heaven unto one of his Fellow Servants towards the Close of a Day spent in extraordinary Devotions, <HI>Thou art a desireable MAN. [Dan.</HI> ix. 23.] So I spent an Hour or two in considering what would render me such a Man.</P>
<P>ONE special Thing wherein I proposed unto my self a way to become <HI>desireable</HI> was to become <HI>An∣gelical</HI></P>
<P>— Accordingly I considered;</P>
<P>HOW the <HI>Angels</HI> were continually engaged in beholding and admiring the <HI>Glories</HI> of the great GOD. [<HI>Mat.</HI> xviii. 10.]</P>
<P>HOW <HI>They</HI> were continually studying the <HI>Myste∣ries</HI> of Redemption by JESUS CHRIST with the Characters and Approaches of His Kingdom. [1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12.]</P>
<P>HOW <HI>They</HI> were continually upon the <HI>Wing</HI> to go upon the Errands of the King of Heaven. [<HI>Psal.</HI> ciii. 20, 21.]</P>
<P>HOW <HI>They</HI> were continually <HI>doing of Good</HI> a∣mong the People and Churches of the LORD, [<HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14.]</P>
<P>HOW <HI>They</HI> took particular Satisfaction in the Conversion of miserable Sinners. [<HI>Luk.</HI> xv. 10.]</P>
<P>HOW the <HI>Angels,</HI> in fine, were very <HI>Holy.</HI>— These Things I considered for my own <HI>Imitation.</HI></P>
<P>BUT for the Close of all; because I tho't it would be a little <HI>Angelical,</HI> as well as otherwise
<PB N="123" REF="003188_0145_0FF014BC9B7995A8"/><HI>agreable,</HI> I took a List of many <HI>poor</HI> People in my Flock with some <HI>Care</HI> to have their Necessi∣ties relieved against the approaching Winter.</P></Q>
<P>AND so the Day ended.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is impossible for me to tell how many VI∣GILS Dr. MATHER kept, he not always keeping an Account of them: I shall therefore only in general let you know that he frequently in former Years con∣versed with his SAVIOUR in the <HI>Night Watches.</HI></P>
<P>HE considered that the Primitive Christians in O∣bedience to that Command of <HI>Watching unto Prayer</HI> sometimes had their VIGILS which were of great Use unto them in their Christianity. To spend a good Part of a <HI>Night</HI> now and then <HI>in Prayer,</HI> and so take the Advantage of a <HI>noctural Solitude,</HI> and abridge themselves of their usual Rest, for the sake of a devout Conversation with Heaven; They found GOD re∣warding them and the Devotions of such VIGILS with a more than ordinary Degree of Heavenly Con∣solation. And so the <HI>Doctor</HI> likewise found it. He has frequently withdrawn from his Lodging agreable enough unto Him, and in the Dead of the Night has retired unto his Study; where he has thrown himself on his Floor in the Dust, and wrestled with him in Prayer for a great while together. In doing thus he was rewarded with unutterable Communications from Heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. I will here give my Reader the Result of three <HI>Self-Examinations,</HI> which I find in the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Pa∣pers, and which will be sufficient to show how he proceeded in that Exercise.</P>

I employ'd a Collection of <HI>Marks</HI> which I had lying by me; I proceeded by <HI>direct</HI> rather than <HI>reflex</HI> ones; That is to say, Examining whether I had done these and those <HI>good Things,</HI> I put it out of Doubt by doing them over again. Incredible <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and I hope some <HI>Satisfaction</HI> was the Effect of these blessed Exercises.</P></Q>
<P>THE Result of the second <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> which I promised, I find written as follows.</P>
<Q><P>ASKING the Help of Heaven in this <HI>Work,</HI> that if I were yet unsound I was desirous to begin the Work of <HI>Conversion</HI> again, and anew go over all the sorrowful Hours which I had seen in that Work: But that if I saw my own Sincerity, my Hands would thereby be strengthned in the <HI>Warfare</HI> to which I am called.</P>
<P>I then found such Things as these, which made me hope that the LORD had begun a never dying Work of his Grace upon my Soul.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Supreme</HI> Design and Desire of my Soul is, that GOD may be forever <HI>glorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>INFERIOR Ends</HI> are become despicable in my Eyes; and I apprehend those to be the vilest <HI>Fools,</HI> who <HI>live only unto themselves.</HI></P>
<P>THE Voice of my Soul is, <HI>Oh, let the LORD be magnified!</HI> Hence I am contriving every <HI>Week,</HI> every <HI>Day</HI> and perhaps oftner than so, <HI>What can I do for the Name of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE my <HI>Thirst</HI> after an <HI>Enlargement</HI> in the <HI>Service</HI> of GOD, and after the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of my own <HI>Salvation,</HI> does then after the most melting Manner transport me, when I think, <HI>Hereby the Glory of the infinitely amiable GOD will be discovered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="003188_0148_0FF014C4668B4770"/>
HENCE those Things by which the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD is obscured and eclipsed; especially those cursed <HI>Lusts</HI> of mine which have robbed the LORD of that <HI>Glory</HI> that I might have bro't HIM, do vex and cut my very Soul within me.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> MY Heart rejoices in any Revenues of <HI>Glory</HI> bro't any way to the LORD: I fell my <HI>own Interest</HI> gratified by it, and see my best Friend ho∣nored and advanced.</P>
<P N="2">2. MY Heart is insatiably <HI>pressing</HI> after the <HI>high Attainments</HI> of Religion.</P>
<P>OH! When I consider what it is <HI>to converse with GOD continually;</HI> and not only to be living always <HI>with</HI> and <HI>upon</HI> and <HI>unto</HI> the LORD, but also to <HI>love</HI> no Creature except <HI>in</HI> HIM, and <HI>for</HI> HIM, and to have HIM for my <HI>All in all,</HI> My Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> springs at it. I cry, I strive, <HI>LORD, let me thus draw near unto THEE.</HI></P>
<P>And herein the LORD gives me some <HI>Experience</HI> that is exceeding desireable.</P>
<P>FOR when I have bin mightily carried forth in my publick Dispensations I have taken <HI>Comfort:</HI> In what? Not that any <HI>Gifts</HI> of <HI>Mine</HI> have been seen, but that the <HI>Power,</HI> the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> of the glorious GOD have glitter'd thro' me as thro' a sorry <HI>Lanthorn</HI> to the View of many Hundreds at a time. This even dissolves my Heart and causes me to love that GOD who has ho∣nored HIMSELF by me.</P>
<P>HENCE also my Spirit grows more unconcerned about keeping or losing any <HI>Creature Comforts, [consolatiunculas Creaturulas;]</HI> for I can <HI>encourage my self in the LORD my GOD.</HI></P>

<P>ONE Example may serve for all here: The Text he chose for one Morning was that in <HI>Zech.</HI> xiii. 1. On which his Tho'ts were under these Heads;

<P>IT would take up too much Room here to describe at large this Method and the Usefulness of it: All I shall add about it is, that Dr. MATHER went over many Portions and Chapters of the Bible in this Method, and handled multitudes of Cases referring to the most important Points in Christianity.</P>

<P N="3">[3] HAVING spoken concerning <HI>Saturday After∣noons;</HI> it is natural to enquire <HI>how he spent the Sab∣bath?</HI></P>
<P>I will here give you what I find, the <HI>various Ex∣ercises</HI> he went thro' <HI>on</HI> but <HI>one Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING the Evening before laid aside all Affairs that might be any Encumbrance to him, having devoted the <HI>Evening</HI> to the Exercises of Piety, and charged His Family to make <HI>Preparation</HI> for the Sabbath; in the Morning he awoke Blessing GOD for another <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and arose <HI>earlier</HI> than on other Days.</P>
<P>HE considered his usual <HI>Question</HI> for the Morning. <HI>What shall I do for the Good of the Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k that I have under my Charge?</HI> He sang his <HI>Morning Hymn,</HI> and coming down into his Study, wrote his <HI>Answer</HI> to his Question.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="003188_0152_0FF014CF1B254B88"/>
HE applied himself to his Maker, as for the <HI>Par∣don</HI> of his former Trespasses on His holy Day of <HI>Rest;</HI> thro' the <HI>Blood</HI> of him who is the LORD of it, so for <HI>Grace</HI> from HIM now to sanctify his Day.</P>
<P>THROUGHOUT the Day, he kept his <HI>Tho'ts</HI> in an agreable <HI>Employment</HI> and under the necessary <HI>Govern∣ment.</HI> When he was not engaged in any extended Exercise of Devotion, he was continually forming <HI>Admonitions of Piety</HI> from occasional Objects and Occurrences; Every Thing about him preached unto him, and he usually turned the Lessons into <HI>Ejacula∣tory Prayers.</HI> If he found his Mind begin at any Time to ly fallow and empty of <HI>good Tho'ts,</HI> he pre∣sently rebuked <HI>it</HI> and renewed <HI>them.</HI> It any <HI>evil Tho'ts</HI> began to make the least Approach to his Mind, he presently bewailed <HI>it</HI> and rejected <HI>them,</HI> and raised good ones contrary to them.</P>
<P>HE so took heed against <HI>Sinning with his Tongue,</HI> that he did not utter one Word on the Day, but what he tho't he did well to say.</P>
<P>HE wrote an Illustration upon a Text of the <HI>sacred Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>HE read a suitable Portion of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language. Another in the <HI>French.</HI> And then a suitable Portion of the <HI>New Testament</HI> in the <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>THEN he made the <HI>Morning Prayer</HI> of his Study.</P>
<P>HIS Breakfast (which was as his other Meals slen∣der) being bro't him, his Food was received with Praises to GOD, Meditations on the nobler Pro∣visions which He had made for his better Part.</P>
<P>WITH the like Dispositions and Meditations he anon took the <HI>other two Meals</HI> of the Day.</P>
<P>HE went down to his Family, <HI>sang</HI> and <HI>prayed</HI> with them.</P>
<P>HE gave Charges to his <HI>Family</HI> to <HI>remember the Sabbath Day</HI> and keep it holy. And, to the very small Children that were to stay at home, he assign'd <HI>Sentences</HI> of the Bible to be got by Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="003188_0153_0FF014D0B1FD5918"/>
HE returned to his Study, and pray'd that the <HI>pub∣lic Sacrifices,</HI> to which he was going might be pro∣fitably and acceptably carried on.</P>
<P>HE went unto the Public, where his venerable Parent performed the public Ministrations. The very <HI>Bell</HI> put him in Mind of the <HI>joyful Sound.</HI> Here he gave such Attention that not one Passage of the <HI>Prayer,</HI> not one <HI>Head</HI> or <HI>Text,</HI> and scarce one Sentence in the Sermon passed without his Mind moving towards Heaven with an adapted <HI>Confession</HI> or <HI>Petition</HI> upon it. And every Verse of the <HI>Psalm</HI> he accompanied with a <HI>Note</HI> and a <HI>Prayer</HI> deduced from it.</P>
<P>WHEN all was finished, he set himself to form De∣sires for <HI>all the Hearers,</HI> and the Desires and Resolves for <HI>his own Life;</HI> and think on those <HI>Improvements in Piety,</HI> to which the Subject treated on might lead him.</P>
<P>RETURNING to his Study, he read over some Dis∣courses on the <HI>great Sabbatism</HI> which the Church of GOD is to look for, and <HI>the glorious Things which are spoken about the City of GOD,</HI> and the Prophe∣cies relating to the latter Days. This he did (as he usually did) because he looked on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> as a peculiar <HI>Type</HI> and <HI>Sign</HI> of the blessed <HI>Millennium.</HI></P>
<P>GOING to his <HI>Table,</HI> he fed the Souls of the Com∣pany with as profitable Discourses as he could entertain them with.</P>
<P>AND he also <HI>drew out his Soul to the Hungry;</HI> he tho't it a Day proper to dispense Kindnesses unto the <HI>Poor;</HI> he was careful to have some such invited unto his Table.</P>
<P>AFTER this, he went on to the Affairs of the great <HI>Sabbatism.</HI> He read a Paragraph of Scripture referring to it, with his acutest and most penetrating Tho'ts upon it and suitable Ejaculations. And he sang an Hymn relating to it.</P>
<P>THEN prostrate in the Dust, he poured out a Prayer for <HI>Zion in the Dust,</HI> and for the Hastening of the Day of GOD.</P>

UPON this he took the <HI>Sermon</HI> He was to preach immediately, and run it over so that his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d was formed into proper Tempers and Wishes on every Head of the Sermon.</P>
<P>HE then on his Knees bewail'd before the LORD such <HI>Sins</HI> as the <HI>Sermon</HI> he was to preach most called him to repent of; and pray'd for <HI>Grace</HI> to do such Things himself, as his <HI>Sermon</HI> was to excite his Hearers to; and beg'd for the Help of Heaven in the Work before him.</P>
<P>HE went unto the public, and spent about three Hours in carrying on the Services there, in a <HI>great Assembly</HI> with great Assistance from Heaven.</P>
<P>HIS Mind, between the Conclusion of the Services, and his <HI>visiting of his Habitation,</HI> was filled with Prayers that what had passed might make due Im∣pressions upon the People.</P>
<P>EXCESSIVELY tired he drank his beloved <HI>Tea,</HI> with Praises to the glorious GOD, and some Tho'ts on his precious Benefits to which the Water led him.</P>
<P>HE made a Prayer for such Blessings as he was daily to ask for.</P>
<P>HE went down to his <HI>Family;</HI> where he <HI>catechized</HI> his Children; and went thro' the Sermons of the Day in a way of Dialogue with them; and sang and pray'd with them and the Neighbours that came in to join with them.</P>
<P>THEN he caused such of his Children as could do so, to tell him, <HI>What new Matter of Prayer they were apprehensive of?</HI> And he charged them to re∣tire with it before the LORD.</P>
<P>HAVING also ordered one of his Sons to hear the Servants read &amp; say their Catechism: he retired unto his Study and meditated on that Point; <HI>What have I l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t undone that it would be for my Consolation and Satisfaction to do before I dy?</HI></P>
<P>HE read in a Book of Piety, a Sermon that might add unto the Heavenly Tincture on his Mind.</P>
<P>HE was called to <HI>pray with a Sick Person,</HI> unto which he went with Alacrity as unto a Duty of the <HI>Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="003188_0155_0FF014D4A0FBA250"/>
HE went again to his Family, and sat with them, while each of the capable Children successively read their several parts of some <HI>Book of Dovotion</HI> to the whole Family: And he took Occasion from thence to renew his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tructions to them.</P>
<P>THEN he sang with his Family his <HI>Evening Hymn.</HI></P>
<P>HE returned to his Study, and in Prayer gave Thanks for the <HI>Mercies</HI> of the past Day; and im∣plored a Pardon for the <HI>Errors,</HI> of it, both of which he endeavoured particularly to enumerate. He committed all his Interests into the Hands of his dear SAVIOUR, and exerted a <HI>Principle of Grace</HI> in an <HI>Act</HI> that was <HI>an evident Token of Salvation,</HI> that might assure him of his Safety if he were to dy before the Morrow.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> HE declared before the LORD, that altho' some had observed a Reward of <HI>Temporal Blessings</HI> even in the ensuing Week to encourage their <HI>Sabba∣tizing,</HI> he had been <HI>abounding in this Work of the LORD</HI> without the Encouragement of any such Expectation. If never so much Disappointment or Affliction should befal him in the Week, or in the rest of his Life, yet he would go on in the <HI>Labors of Sab∣batizing</HI> to him; and assure himself that he should find his Account in <HI>the Rest that remains for the People of GOD;</HI> but renouncing all Pretence to <HI>Merit</HI> in his own Performances, So he went to Rest; and fell asleep reading some divine Author.</P>
<P>THIS Variety of Duty (I find) was done by him on <HI>one Sabbath:</HI> And altho' he found himself very <HI>weary,</HI> yet his Spirit found those unspeakable Con∣solations and Advantages from such <HI>unwearied Sab∣batizing,</HI> as carry'd rich Compensations with them.</P>
<P N="4">[4] WHEN he <HI>read the Scriptures,</HI> he had one very holy and useful Practice in it.</P>
<P>THIS was, a Course of <HI>Reading</HI> with such a De∣vout Attention as to fetch at least one <HI>Observation</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="003188_0156_0FF014D6E988EF40"/>and one <HI>Supplication,</HI> (a <HI>Note</HI> with a <HI>Wish</HI>) out of almost every Verse in the Bible. He had a Prospect of more than a little Good by it; he tho't a great deal of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> might pass thro' his Soul in thus waiting upon GOD, and his Prospect did not fail him. The <HI>Reading the Scriptures</HI> in such a Manner and with such an Affection proved unto him a most glorious Opportunity for Conversing with GOD. And he gave more Thanks to Heaven for teaching him this way of Living than if he had the greatest Earthly Revenues bestowed on him.</P>
<P>AND here is a proper Place to relate a Proposal, which he drew up in the Manner and Words follow∣ing, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>LET it be a part of my Business every Day to be applying of the PROMISES. There are certain <HI>Pro∣mises</HI> that are of continual Use in the <HI>Christian's daily Walk;</HI> and I wish I might every Day have some <HI>delightful Reflections</HI> on several of them.</P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> I shall have Occasion for a <HI>Promise of a Supply</HI> for all my Wants in the Day: Such an one is that in Phil. iv. 19. <HI>GOD will supply all your Needs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> I shall have Occasion for a <HI>Promise of Grace</HI> to manage the Day for the Glory of GOD. Such an one is that in Zech. x. 12. <HI>I will strengthen them in the LORD, they shall walk up and down in his Name saith the LORD.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> I shall have Occasion for a <HI>Promise</HI> of a growing <HI>Victory</HI> over Sin. Such an one is that in Mic. vii. 19. <HI>He will subdue our Iniquities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> I should have a <HI>Promise of Suc∣cess</HI> in my Undertakings. There is one in Psal. i. 3. <HI>Whatsoever he doth shall prosper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> I should have a <HI>Promise of Pro∣tection</HI> from Dangers. There is one in Psal. xci. 10. <HI>No Evil shall befall thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="003188_0157_0FF014DA2508CDF0"/>
<HI>EVERY Day</HI> I should have a <HI>Promise of Counsel</HI> in my Difficulties. There is one in Psal. xxxii. 8. <HI>I will instruct thee, and I will teach thee in the Way which thou shouldst go.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> it were good I should have a <HI>Promise</HI> of not being the <HI>worse</HI> by whatever hap∣pens to me. 'Tis to befound in Rom. viii. 28. <HI>All things shall work together for Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY Day</HI> I can't be without a <HI>Promise of Eternal Happiness</HI> at my dying Day. Here it is, Luk. xii. 32. <HI>It is your Father's good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>OH! That I might often <HI>every Day</HI> be glancing at such <HI>Promises</HI> as these! It would be <HI>Heaven upon Earth</HI> to be doing so; and it would have a charming Efficacy upon me for the <HI>perfecting of Holiness in the Fear of GOD.</HI></P></Q>
<P N="5">[5.] THE! Doctor had much Exactness in the Me∣thod of employing his Mind at the Table of the LORD — I will here transcribe only the first of the many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nce he recorded of his more <HI>methodical Proceedures</HI> at the sacred Table.</P>
<P>PRAYER being finished, his Mind thus operated;</P>
<Q><P>Do I need the LORD JESUS CHRIST? Yes, in∣finitely; but chiefly on two Accounts.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Guilt of Sin</HI> on me is mountainous; none but HE can remove it: The <HI>Power of Sin</HI> in me is marvellous; none but HE can subdue it.</P>
<P>BUT am I wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to have the LORD JESUS CHRIST? — Yes, most heartily.</P>
<P>FOR there is a dreadful Necessity that the Mise∣ries of my Soul should be relieved.— HE and none but HE can relieve them.</P>
<P>I cannot find any Thing <HI>unlovely</HI> in the LORD JESUS CHRIST; all His <HI>Benefits</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> are desireable.— And therefore, LORD, I am willing</P>
<P><HI>ART Thou so? Then take HIM,</HI> says the LORD, <HI>I give HIM to Thee.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="136" REF="003188_0158_0FF014DBB58CF048"/>
BY this Time the Sacramental <HI>Bread</HI> was brought unto Him to seal the Gift; which He <HI>took</HI> [and eat] accordingly.</P>
<P>AND then he proceeded; <Q>The LORD JESUS is mine; If I am ready to question it, I may now <HI>see</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> and <HI>taste</HI> it. My LORD and SAVIOUR I may be sure, will engage for my Good and perfect every part of my Salvation.</Q></P>
<P>AT the Administration of <HI>the Wine;</HI> and after Prayer;— Thus,</P>
<Q><P>THE <HI>first Covenant</HI> is broken; It speaks nothing but Confusion to fallen Man: The gracious GOD therefore enters into a <HI>New Covenant</HI> which is of <HI>Grace.</HI> In it is tendered all manner of Good for Believers on CHRIST, the <HI>Mediator</HI> of that <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>AM I willing to come under the Wings of this <HI>Covenant?</HI> — Yes; LORD, Thou hast made me willing.</P>
<P><HI>THEN,</HI> says the LORD, <HI>Here is the New-Testament in my Blood.</HI></P></Q>
<P>By this Time the Sacramental Wine came unto him; he drank of it, and thereby he had all the Good of the Covenant sealed unto Him.</P>
<P>He then proceeded; <Q><HI>Now I shall have Repen∣tance and Remission of Sins.</HI> Now all my Changes will be well ordered for me. My GOD <HI>will guide me by Counsel and bring me to Glory.</HI> All <HI>the great and precious Promises</HI> of GOD are my Heritage and shall be <HI>the Rejoicing of my Heart.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS one Instance may teach us how to manage our <HI>Sacramental Meditations</HI> much to our spiritual Profit. The Sermons which he heard prepa∣ratory to Communion, he made very subservient to his Meditations in this Way of <HI>regularly marshalling</HI> them on such blessed Occasions</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="137" REF="003188_0159_0FF014DEB819F040"/>
[6.] BUT when the <HI>Doctor</HI> himself administred the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> his <HI>Devotion</HI> was very flaming and his <HI>Prayers</HI> exceedingly fervent.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Prayers,</HI> poured out at the Celebration of the <HI>Sacrament were dictated,</HI> as GREGORY NA∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IANZEN says of <HI>his</HI> Fathers, <HI>by the Holy SPIRIT of GOD.</HI> He rarely administred on such Occasions before the LORD without signal Irradiations of Mind and very inlarging Influences. He could not, as he told me, keep <HI>written Memorials</HI> of those Passages; For, if his <HI>Employments</HI> were not so many as to hin∣der him, it were next to <HI>impossible</HI> to recollect and express the warm Requests, the <HI>strong Cries,</HI> the <HI>celestial Expansions</HI> of his Soul when employed in that hea∣venly Business.</P>
<P N="7">[7.] He has often beg'd with irresistible Importunity <HI>Three Favors</HI> of the glorious GOD; in which there is imply'd <HI>all</HI> that a Man need <HI>desire</HI> and seek after.</P>
<P>First, THAT CHRIST might appear to him the <HI>most glorious</HI> of Objects.</P>
<P>Next, THAT <HI>Sin</HI> might appear to him the most <HI>odious</HI> of Objects.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII</HI> HIS latter Days; in which his Sentiments of some important Things are mentioned, together with a Relation of Temper in his last Illness and the Cirumstances of his Death; and at the End a Catalogue of the Books he published.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> HIS way of Living in his latter Days.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE very learned and good DRUSIUS says, that his <HI>Old Age was better to</HI> him <HI>than</HI> his <HI>Youth.</HI> So was Dr. MATHER'S: He was generally more hearty in his <HI>latter</HI> Years than former; and, altho' he was always very <HI>temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate,</HI> in his later Times he was exceedingly re∣gular; in every Thing but <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Writing,</HI> for he was as constantly employ'd in these, as if he had but newly taken a <HI>Pen</HI> or <HI>Book</HI> into his Hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. CICERO, in his Book of <HI>Famous Orators,</HI> speak∣ing of PISO who when he first set out got consider∣able Fame, says, that <HI>he maintained his, Ground while he could labor and be industrious, but</HI> continues TULLY, <HI>Postea quantum detraxit</HI> ex Studio, <HI>tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um amisit</HI> ex Gloria, h. e. As he ceased from his <HI>Study</HI> he lost his <HI>Credit.</HI> Dr. MATHER, as I said before, did not abate his Studies; and hence, he had those <HI>docti Sales</HI> and that <HI>grata Senectus</HI> which CLAUDIAN admir'd in PALLADIUS, that is, he render'd himself agreable in Age by his polite Facetiousness and the Surprising Discoveries of his Reading and Wit. Hence likewise he was caress'd by all that knew him (tho' in his latter Days he studiously avoided Company as much as he could) and was resorted to by Persons of all Characters for his Directions. Advice and In∣struction.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="140" REF="003188_0162_0FF014E5B31FA580"/>
3. I must relate one Thing by which all Parents would do well to receive Instruction, 'tis this; He would not, as I more especially <HI>know</HI> in his <HI>latter Days,</HI> keep a <HI>morose Carriage</HI> towards his Children, nor at an <HI>haughty Distance</HI> from them; but forever when they came into his Presence he would condescend to the <HI>Familiarity of an Acquaintance;</HI> and thus he would instruct and edify, thus allure and charm us, thus make us love his Society, ever come into it with Delight and never leave it but with Sorrow: — Which Method, I believe, will work more forcibly upon any Children of common Sense and more en∣gage them to love their Parent and encline them to be good and vertuous, than any crabbed Looks, austere Orders or surly Demands whatever.</P>
<P N="2">2. His <HI>Sentiments upon some important Things.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. ALTHO' he was a Defender of the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> as expressed in the <HI>Articles of the Church of England;</HI> and, as to <HI>Church Discipline,</HI> was of <HI>Con∣gregational Principles,</HI> which he looked on as most agreable to the Word of GOD and <HI>the Rights of the Christian Church;</HI> yet he was very extensive in his Charity, being desirous to receive all whom CHRIST receives to the Kingdom of GOD, <HI>viz.</HI> All who <HI>fear GOD and work Righteousness,</HI> all who do not <HI>abet Errors</HI> and <HI>indulge Practices</HI> inconsistent with the Christian Life: And being of such a charitable and good Temper, he must needs be an Enemy to <HI>all Persecution</HI> as he was. He tho't that a good <HI>Subject</HI> and good <HI>Neighbour</HI> had a <HI>Right to Life</HI> and the Comforts of it, let his Opinion in Religion be what it will, He early imbib'd this Opinion, grew strong in it, left it behind him and to the last, was an En∣courager of <HI>manly Religion</HI> without any bitter Spirit common to this <HI>Party</HI> and that <HI>Faction.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As it is well known that Dr. MATHER was well acquainted with <HI>the Sacred Prophecies,</HI> on which he formerly writ and printed his Tho'ts; so it may not
<PB N="141" REF="003188_0163_0FF014E9748F98D0"/>be amiss to inform my Reader, that, in several Things relating to the Prophecies, he saw cause to <HI>alter his Mind;</HI> particularly concerning <HI>the second Coming of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the Conflagration, the New Heavens and New Earth,</HI> and <HI>the Calling of the Jews.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I will here write those Sentiments of these Things of which the Doctor just before he died had a firm Belief from a strict Enquiry, long Study and much Prayer; and, as near as I can, I will express his Sen∣timents in his own Words in the following Assertions.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE <HI>second Coming</HI> of the LORD will be <HI>at</HI> and <HI>for</HI> the Destruction of <HI>the Man of Sin</HI> and the Ex∣tinction of <HI>the Roman Monarchy</HI> under <HI>the Papal Form</HI> of it. He tho't that, altho' Wise Men have interpreted our SAVIOUR'S <HI>Coming in the Clouds of Heaven</HI> and <HI>the Brightness of his Appearance</HI> as if it me'nt any Thing besides <HI>His Personal Coming,</HI> herein they spoke foolishly and unaccountably. For as their Interpretations leave us destitute of any Proof that our LORD will <HI>ever come at all,</HI> so they go very far towards a Trespass on the <HI>third Commandment.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE <HI>Conflagration</HI> described by the Oracles of GOD in strong Terms, and which we are warned of <HI>by the Mouth of all the Prophets;</HI> this <HI>Conflagration</HI> will be at the <HI>second Coming</HI> of the LORD. To make the <HI>Petrine Conflagration</HI> signify no more than the laying of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and her Daughter in Ashes: And to make the <HI>New Heavens</HI> and the <HI>New Earth</HI> signify no more than <HI>the Church State of the Gospel.</HI> — These are shameful Hallucinations. And as for the <HI>New Earth,</HI> before the Arrival of which no Man can reasonably expect <HI>happy Times</HI> for the Church of GOD upon Earth, it is the greatest Absurdity to say that it will take Place before <HI>the Petrine Conflagra∣tions;</HI> and there is no Prospect of arguing to any Purpose with such as can talk so very ridiculously.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="142" REF="003188_0164_0FF014EBEFDA2EE0"/>
3. UPON <HI>the Conflagration</HI> the glorious GOD will <HI>create New Heavens and a New Earth.</HI> In the up∣per Part of our <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> where will be the <HI>New Heavens,</HI> there will be the <HI>holy City</HI> which GOD has prepared for his People. This <HI>holy City</HI> will be in∣habited by the <HI>raised Saints,</HI> attending on our SA∣VIOUR there and receiving the inconceivable Re∣compences of all their Services &amp; Sufferings for Him. The <HI>New Earth</HI> will be a <HI>Paradise,</HI> prepar'd for another People &amp; <HI>full of the goodness of the LORD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. IT is impossible to find any Inhabitants for the <HI>New Earth,</HI> but a set of People that shall escape the <HI>Conflagration.</HI> It is a Thing plainly revealed unto us, that our descending Redeemer, while yet at a further Distance than he will anon come, when he sets <HI>Fire</HI> to the Earth, will by his Almighty Voice <HI>raise the Dead,</HI> whom he intends for Blessedness, so fetch them to him as to <HI>bring them with him:</HI> As he is going on in his nearer Approaches with his illustrious Re∣tinue to give Order for the tremendous <HI>Fire,</HI> he will hear the Cries of his chosen, called and faithful ones, and he will send <HI>His Angels</HI> to do for them as once for ELIJAH; These <HI>Hundred and forty four Thou∣sand</HI> Servants of GOD and Walkers with HIM, that have <HI>the Mark</HI> of GOD upon them, when the <HI>Destroyers</HI> are going to <HI>hurt the Earth,</HI> shall be <HI>caught up to meet the LORD</HI> and with HIM they shall be in Safety, while they shall see the <HI>Earth</HI> flaming under them. These are they who shall return to the <HI>New Earth,</HI> possess it, and people it, they shall soon multiply in∣to mighty Nations upon it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THE Process of <HI>Judgment</HI> on the <HI>Sheep &amp; Goats,</HI> in the <HI>twenty fifth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Matthew,</HI> has not one of the <HI>Raised from the Dead</HI> concerned in it; but it is a quick Division &amp; Decision made by our LORD among the <HI>Christians</HI> who cry for <HI>Mercy,</HI> when they see <HI>the Fire of GOD</HI> ready to seize upon them, de∣termining who shall be <HI>caught up to meet the LORD,</HI> and who shall be left to <HI>the Perdition of ungodly
<PB N="143" REF="003188_0165_0FF014EDC09F7450"/>Men in the Flames</HI> before them; and there shall not one <HI>ungodly Man</HI> be left living in the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. THE <HI>raised Saints</HI> in the <HI>New Heavens</HI> will <HI>not marry nor be given in marriage,</HI> but be <HI>equal with the Angels;</HI> The <HI>changed Saints</HI> on the <HI>New Earth</HI> will <HI>build Houses and inhabit them, plant Vineyards and eat the Fruit of them,</HI> and will have <HI>an Offspring that will be with them the blessed of the LORD;</HI> and if <HI>blessed;</HI> then <HI>sinless</HI> and <HI>deathless:</HI> The sacred Scriptures have expressly declared this Difference between them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. WHILE the <HI>holy People</HI> on the <HI>New Earth</HI> shall be circumstanced like <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; <HI>Eve in Paradise,</HI> in a pure and spotless Manner Living unto GOD; the <HI>Raised Saints,</HI> being somewhat more <HI>Angelically</HI> circumstanced, will be sent from Time to Time down from the <HI>New Heavens</HI> unto them to be their <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> and have <HI>Power over Nations,</HI> and the Will of GOD will be <HI>done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</HI> This Dispensation will continue at least for a <HI>thousand Years.</HI> Whether the Translations from the <HI>New Earth</HI> to the <HI>New Heavens</HI> will be successively during the <HI>thousand Years,</HI> or all to∣gether after it, has not been discovered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. THE <HI>New Heavens,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>New Earth</HI> under the Influence of it, is that <HI>Heavenly Countrey</HI> which the Patriarchs looked for. When the great GOD promised them that he would <HI>be their GOD and bless them,</HI> they understood if of his bring∣ing them into this <HI>Deathless and Sinless World.</HI> They who expect the <HI>Rest</HI> promised for the Church of GOD upon Earth to be found any where but in the <HI>New Earth,</HI> and they who expect any <HI>happy Times</HI> for the Church in a World that hath <HI>Death</HI> &amp; <HI>Sin</HI> in it, — <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se do err, not knowing the Scripture nor the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></ITEM>

9. SUCH a <HI>Conversion of the Israelitish Nation</HI> with a Return to their ancient Seats in <HI>Palestine,</HI> as many excellent Persons in latter years (and among the Rest himself) have been persuaded of: He now tho't in∣consistent with the <HI>coming of the LORD</HI> and <HI>the Burning</HI> of the World at the <HI>Fall of Antichrist,</HI> be∣fore which Fall no body imagines that <HI>Conversion.</HI> And indeed how is it consistent with <HI>the Deep Sleep</HI> in which the <HI>Diluvium Ignis</HI> must, as that of <HI>Water</HI> did, surprize the World? The <HI>holy People</HI> of the Pro∣phecies is found among <HI>the Gentiles,</HI> the <HI>surrogate Israel.</HI> The <HI>New Testament</HI> seems to have done with a <HI>carhal Israel;</HI> The <HI>Eleventh</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Rom∣ans</HI> is greatly misunderstood, where we find <HI>all Israel saved</HI> by a <HI>filling up of the Gentiles</HI> which we mis∣translate <HI>the fulness of the Gentiles.</HI> The Prophecies of the <HI>old Testament</HI> that seem to have an Aspect up∣on such a Nation; are either already accomplished un∣to that Nation in the Return from the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Cap∣tivity; or they belong to that <HI>holy People</HI> whom a Succession to the Piety of <HI>the Patriarchs</HI> will render what our Bible has taught us to call them <HI>the Israel of GOD:</HI> But the final Fulfilment of them all will be in <HI>the World to come,</HI> or the <HI>New Heavens</HI> and the <HI>New Earth</HI> where <HI>GOD will dwell with Men and be their GOD.</HI> Of what Advantage to the <HI>King∣dom of GOD</HI> can the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> be, any more than the <HI>Conversion</HI> of any other Nation, except we should suppose to remain upon the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> after their <HI>Conversion</HI> something to <HI>distinguish</HI> then from the rest of the <HI>Christian Believers?</HI> Now to suppose this, would it not be to rebuild a <HI>Partition Wall</HI> that our SAVIOUR has demolished and abolised; which <HI>a Christian,</HI> one would think, would no sooner go to do than to rebuild the fallen Walls of <HI>Jericho.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>THE Doctor was very much displeased with those, who, proposing rather to <HI>carp</HI> than to <HI>search,</HI> think they have at once routed all Hopes to understand <HI>the Scriptures</HI> and secured an unintelligible <HI>Obscurity and Ambiguity</HI> to the <HI>Divine Oracles</HI> only by demanding with an Air of Contempt, <HI>Where will you find Gog and Magog?</HI> They are not ordinarily capable of re∣ceiving a Rational Answer till they have more seri∣ously tho't on what is to arrive a <HI>thousand Years</HI> before the Rising of <HI>Gog and Magog.</HI> Suppose (what in∣deed the Doctor would not allow) the Question to be unanswerable: He would then ask, Is there no <HI>Question</HI> concerning the <HI>Raised Bodies</HI> of the Faith∣ful which these People will confess cannot yet be an∣swered? And yet, continued he, they will not re∣nounce <HI>the Faith of the Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctor us'd to say, <HI>I will also ask you one Thing, which if you tell me I will in likewise tell you:</HI> The <HI>Bodies</HI> of the <HI>Raised</HI> shall they be furnish∣ed with <HI>Teeth</HI> or no? Or I will only ask; Where will you find the <HI>Nations,</HI> over which the <HI>Raised Saints</HI> (or the <HI>Overcomers</HI>) are to have <HI>Power?</HI> Tell me <HI>that,</HI> and I will tell you where to find <HI>Gog and Magog.</HI></P>
<P>AND as for those who think it improbable or in∣credible, that so dreadful a Thing as a <HI>Conflagration</HI> should be ordered for such an <HI>evil World</HI> as this; they will do well to think on <HI>the Evil of Sin</HI> and to re∣menber that the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> World had us many
<PB N="146" REF="003188_0168_0FF014F6764E11B0"/>fine <HI>Buildings, Cities</HI> and <HI>Artifices</HI> in it as, and pro∣bably more People than, there are in ours. No more than <HI>eight Persons</HI> were saved out of the Destruction which <HI>Flood of Water</HI> bro't upon that World; whereas there will be a great Number, GOD knows how many Thousands, saved out of the <HI>fiery Flood</HI> which we have to look for.</P>
<P>THUS I have given a brief Account of Dr. MATHER'S latest Sentiments concerning the <HI>sacred Prophecies:</HI> I have been the more concise, because I hope I shall procure a Publication of His <HI>Triparadisus;</HI> which will give the World a more ample Account as well as Proof, of his Persuasion.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Doctor's Temper in his last Illnesses, with the Circumstances of his Death.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. As He had walked <HI>in the Light of GOD's Countenance</HI> thro' the greatest Part of his Life; so in the latter Part of it he had more peculiar and lively Dis∣plays of the Divine Favor; particularly in his last Illnesses.</P>
<P>In one Sickness I find he was sure all his <HI>Sins</HI> were <HI>pardoned,</HI> that he was above the <HI>Fear of Death</HI> and that he esteemed <HI>Patience under Sickness</HI> to be better than Health it self.</P>
<P>IN this Illness I likewise met with his Enquiries after the Reasons why most Men chuse rather to <HI>Live</HI> than to <HI>Dy?</HI> The Causes why the Generality desire <HI>Life,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re either because they are <HI>afraid to Dy,</HI> or else because they <HI>Love Creatures</HI> here so well that they are loth to leave them. Now neither of these Reasons were sufficient to make the Doctor prefer <HI>Life.</HI> Not the <HI>former,</HI> for he was a <HI>Conqueror and more than a Conqueror</HI> over Death thro' JESUS CHRIST; nor yet the <HI>latter,</HI> because he could not be loth to leave the <HI>Streams</HI> to go to the <HI>Fountain,</HI> he loved the <HI>Creator</HI> more than <HI>Creatures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="003188_0169_0FF014F9135B5280"/>
AND as for his <HI>Advantages for doing Good</HI> in this World; whenever GOD should please to put an End to them, he was ssatisfied.</P>
<P N="2">2. ONE Day, when he was labouring under some Infirmities; I find him writing as follows:</P>
<Q><P>WHEN I was pouring out my Prayers unto the LORD, I mentioned the <HI>Prolongation of my Life</HI> to enjoy and improve more Opportunities of glo∣rifying Him. In my Prayers, I humbly represented to the LORD, that there were two Objections against my <HI>dying,</HI> which <HI>my Flesh</HI> would be ready to make; but thro' His Grace I had conquered them.</P>
<P>First, My <HI>Flesh</HI> pleaded that the <HI>Comforts of Earth</HI> were too agreable Things to be easily forsa∣ken. But my <HI>Faith</HI> is perswaded and satisfied that the <HI>Delights of Heaven</HI> are sweeter than the <HI>Com∣forts of Earth;</HI> and I can freely leave all the En∣tertainments of this Evil World; that i may be with CHRIST, where to be is <HI>by far the best of all.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, My <HI>Flesh</HI> pleaded, What will become of my <HI>Offspring</HI> when I am gone? But my <HI>Faith</HI> is persuaded and satisfied, that GOD will be a <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> to my <HI>Fatherless Offspring;</HI> and my LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom I have served without seek∣ing, as many others would have done, to enrich my self with a Portion for my Children, will marvel∣lously become such a <HI>Guardian</HI> unto them, that they shall not <HI>want any good Thing.</HI></P>
<P>My Mind being on these two Accounts thus easy and <HI>ready to Dy,</HI> I then besought of the LORD ne∣vertheless that He would yet spare my Life, to work for HIM a little more among his People.</P></Q>
<P>THUS the Doctor could say, as MARTIN of <HI>Tours</HI> did, <HI>Libera me, quaeso,</HI> Domine; <HI>ex mortali illo Car∣cere; Veruntamen si adh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Populo tuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rius, non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uso Laborem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="003188_0170_0FF014FB9DEE52B0"/>
BUT, Having Writ of his Concern for his Children, I see not why I may not add, tho' it may seem out of Place here, what he wrote when some of his Children were small, <HI>viz.</HI> His <HI>Instrument of Betrustment and Resignation for his Children,</HI> which he knew not how soon he might leave as <HI>Orphans.</HI>—The Instru∣ment, which He, prostrate in the Dust, spread before the LORD, runs in these Terms;</P>
<Q><P>O MY great and good SAVIOUR, Thou SON of GOD, and the LORD in whom <HI>the Father∣less find Mercy:</HI> The principal Satisfaction &amp; Con∣solation with which I receive <HI>the Children,</HI> which the LORD has graciously given me, at their Birth into the World is, the Prospect of more <HI>Subjects</HI> for my SAVIOUR and the Propagation &amp; Continuation of His <HI>Kingdom</HI> in the World. For this purpose it is my strong and full Desire to do my Part that my Children may <HI>know</HI> their SAVIOUR and <HI>serve</HI> HIM <HI>with a perfect Heart and willing Mind.</HI> And I earnestly cry unto HIM to produce <HI>a Work of Grace</HI> in their Souls and to take them under the perpetual Conduct of <HI>the Spirit of Grace,</HI> that they may do so.</P>
<P>Now I firmly believe that the World is under the <HI>Government</HI> of my SAVIOUR, and that he sets at the right Hand of GOD, and that the Affairs of the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> are under his Administration. He does particularly employ the Ministry of His mighty <HI>Angels</HI> in governing the Children of Men, and yet more particularly make them the <HI>Guardians</HI> of His <HI>little ones:</HI> most of all when in his Provi∣dence He makes them <HI>Fatherless Children.</HI> O! Or∣phans well provided for!</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, O my SAVIOUR, I commit my <HI>Children</HI> into thy Fatherly Hands. I pray to Thee that thy gracious <HI>Providence</HI> may, and I trust in Thee that it will be concerned for them. Oh! Let nothing be wanting to them that shall be good for them. Cause them to Fear, to Love Thee, to walk
<PB N="149" REF="003188_0171_0FF014FEA8CD3C78"/>in thy ways; and make use of them to <HI>do Good</HI> in their Generation. Be Thou their <HI>Friend</HI> and raise them up such as may be <HI>necessary,</HI> and in a conve∣nient Manner supply all their Necessities. Give thy ANGELS a Charge of them; and when their <HI>Fa∣ther and Mother forsake</HI> them, then do Thou take them up.</P>
<P>THIS is the Supplication, this the Resignation, this the Dependance of <HI>C. MATHER.</HI></P></Q>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Jam me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Pectus ardet Conspectu Vitae Aetera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, cujus vere sentio in me Initia,</HI> were the dying Words of a learned GERMAN Physician. The same might Doctor MATHER use in his <HI>two last</HI> Sicknesses.</P>
<P>I will here recollect some Passages that occur'd in the Illness before that of which he died, which ma∣nifest his being <HI>ripe for Glory</HI> and show that those Words were fulfil'd unto Him, <HI>It shall come to pass, at Evening Time it shall be Light!</HI></P>
<P>HE said in our Hearing, <Q>LORD, Thou art with me, and dost enable me to <HI>sing in the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death.</HI> I perceive <HI>the Signs of Death</HI> upon me, and am I not affrighted? <HI>No, not at all! I will not so dishonor my SAVIOUR as to be srighted at any Thing that can befall me, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I am in his blessed Hands!</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHEN some Gentlemen came to see him, he said, <Q>I hope, I shall not be found <HI>a Fool,</HI> but here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly and sing, <HI>Soul, take thine Ease T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou hast Goods laid up in Store for many, many Years,</HI> for endless Ages; but another sort of <HI>Goods</HI> than what this vain World puts off its <HI>Idolaters</HI> with!</Q></P>
<P>THERE were several other Passages which I will give my Reader just as the Doctor wrote them with his sick Hand.</P>
<Q><PB N="150" REF="003188_0172_0FF01501B1823D78"/>
<P>I feel <HI>the Life of GOD</HI> begun in my Soul, and a predominant Respect unto the great GOD govern∣ing of me and enclining me to <HI>acknowledge him in all my Ways.</HI> Here is a <HI>Life begun</HI> which can terminate no otherwise than in an <HI>endless Life</HI> with my GOD. There is <HI>a Well of Water</HI> in me that will <HI>Spring up to Everlasting Life. Death,</HI> do thy worst; there is no <HI>killing</HI> of that <HI>Life</HI> to which my GOd has begun to raise me.</P>
<P>HAVE I had a glorious CHRIST <HI>living,</HI> acting and working <HI>in me,</HI> and quickning me for <HI>living unto GOD;</HI> and will he ever lose his Hold of me? No, No; I am sure of <HI>living with him</HI> forevermore.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>precious Tho'ts</HI> of my blessed JESUS often, often every day formed in my Mind, have I had him <HI>dwelling in me;</HI> and shall I not now go to dwell with him? I shall; assuredly I shall.</P>
<P>HAS a Conformity to CHRIST been the <HI>Strain</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI> of my Life; and have I made it my Study, not only to <HI>imitate</HI> him in <HI>doing always the Things that please the Father,</HI> but when my <HI>Afflictions</HI> have been such as to resemble his <HI>Humiliation,</HI> have I not even <HI>rejoyced in Tribulation?</HI> And shall I not go to <HI>partake</HI> with him in <HI>Fulness of Joy and Plea∣sures forevermore?</HI></P>
<P>HAS my dear SAVIOUR made me a <HI>Sacrificer,</HI> such a <HI>Sacrificer</HI> that not only has my Life been filled with <HI>Devotions</HI> towards GOD and <HI>Benignity</HI> towards Men which are Sacrifices that GOD is well pleased with thro' CHRIST; but also have I not look'd on all the <HI>comfortable Things</HI> of this World with a <HI>Sacrificing Eye,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd consented that the Holy ONE, if He please, should <HI>deny</HI> all these Things unto me; let Him only bestow his SON upon me and I should be satisfied? And shall I not now be admitted a∣mong <HI>the Priests of GOD</HI> and CHRIST? Yes in∣deed and even while I am yet among the <HI>Sacrificed,</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="003188_0173_0FF0150379936910"/>and still <HI>separate,</HI> Souls under the <HI>Altar,</HI> I shall have <HI>the White Robes of the Priesthood</HI> given to me.</P>
<P>HAS the glorious JESUS even <HI>here</HI> so <HI>supplied all my Wants with Riches of Glory</HI> in my sense of having HIM for mine, that I could patiently quietly chearfully bear <HI>the loss of all Creatures</HI> from the view of having CHRIST concerned for me and feeling HIM conversing with me? And now I am going from <HI>all Creatures</HI> here below, will HE not take me where HE will shew and give HIMSELF unto me, and be unto me infinitely better than all?</P>
<P>HAVE I, to animate my self-unto <HI>Holiness in all Manner of Conversation,</HI> in my Contemplations of∣ten endeavoured to affect my self with the <HI>Holiness</HI> of the purified <HI>Spirits</HI> in the <HI>Paradise</HI> of GOD; their flaming <HI>Devotions;</HI> their <HI>Delight</HI> in GOD; their <HI>Hatred</HI> of Sin; the <HI>Contempt</HI> with which they <HI>look down</HI> on the <HI>high Things</HI> of this World; and the Goodness with which they treat one another? Done this which earnest Desires to be as like them as this mortal State may attain to and will admit of? And shall I not now be ferch'd away to join with them in the Praises of GOD?</P>
<P>HAS the <HI>Angelical Ministry</HI> been what I have been thankful for and mindful of? Have I been a Cause of <HI>Joy among the Angels</HI> by being a <HI>Re∣penting Sinner?</HI> Have I been deterr'd from doing amiss <HI>because of the Angels?</HI> Have I frequently tho't, with what a <HI>Zeal of the lord of Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> do burn; how <HI>they</HI> are upon the <HI>Wing</HI> to excute the Commands of our LORD; with what <HI>pure Eyes</HI> of Detestation they <HI>behold Evil</HI> and <HI>look upon Iniquity;</HI> with what <HI>Pleasure</HI> they do good Offices for <HI>the Heirs of Salvation?</HI> And have I wish'd and long'd, <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k that I were as far a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Capacity would allow of it like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those Holy ones!</HI> And shall not my Soul now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l into the Hands of those my dear <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liant</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d

<P>BUT!

<P>AND now, <HI>vain World,</HI> farewell! Thou hast been to me a very uneasy <HI>Wilderness. Welcome, everlasting Life!</HI> The <HI>Paradise</HI> of GOD stands open for me.

<P>THESE Passages the Doctor writ; but many of us heard most of them from his Lips.</P>
<P N="4">4. AND now I write of his last Illness and the Cir∣cumstances of his Death.</P>
<P>FROM the Beginning of his last Illness, which was about the latter end of <HI>December</HI> 1727, 8. He had a strong Assurance it would be His Death. He therefore, writing a Note to one of his Physicians, told him, "My <HI>last Enemy</HI> is come, I would say my <HI>best Friend.</HI>"</P>
<P>THERE was nothing He was more desirous of and pressed after with more Vehemence in his last Sickness than a <HI>Resigned Will.</HI> He several Times told us, when He should have his <HI>Will entirely swallowed up
<PB N="154" REF="003188_0176_0FF0150ADF9CBE30"/>in the Will of GOD</HI> he should have no more to say to us— He had some Things on the Anvil which he would willingly have lived to finish, but, said he; <Q><HI>If the GOD of my Life has ordered otherwise, I desire to have no Will of my own.</HI></Q> When one of his Church asked whether he was <HI>desirous to dy?</HI> He reply'd, <Q><HI>I dare not say that I am, nor yet that I am not; I would be entirely resigned unto GOD.</HI></Q> When the Physicians hinted unto him that he would dy, He said with uplifted Hands &amp; Eyes, <HI>'Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.'</HI> And a few Hours before his Death he assured those who were round his Bed, <Q><HI>Now I have nothing more to do here; my Will is entirely swallowed up in the Will of GOD</HI></Q></P>
<P>As thro' the Course of his Life He proposed <HI>the Glory of GOD</HI> as His <HI>last End,</HI> He, at the last days of his Life, was very desirous that <HI>GOD</HI> might be exceedingly <HI>glorified and gratified</HI> by him and his means: when therefore he was told how much many good People prayed for him; He said, <Q><HI>The Prayer of the Upright is His delight;</HI> and I rejoice in that <HI>Sickness</HI> which, by procuring the Prayers of sincere Christians, procures a Pleasure in the Infinite GOD.</Q></P>
<P>HE often expressed the good hope he had; His be∣ing above <HI>the Love of Life</HI> and <HI>the Fear of Death;</HI> assuring us, that he was going to <HI>eat the Bread and drink the Waters of Life</HI> freely; that <HI>all Tears</HI> would be soon <HI>wiped from his Eyes;</HI> that <HI>every Thing look'd smiling about him!</HI> that <HI>it was impossible</HI> He <HI>should be lost;</HI> that he <HI>had a strong Consolation</HI> and that his <HI>Views of the Heavenly World were all glorious.</HI></P>
<P>MANY were the Blessings he pronounced and the Charges he gave those who were near him. How did he wish that the Blessing of HIM <HI>in whom all Nations are to be blessed</HI> might rest on the Persons and Families of those who came to see him! How did he wish a CHRIST might be the Portion of several,
<PB N="155" REF="003188_0177_0FF0150D399DA628"/>thinking HE was <HI>Blessing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no'?</HI> The Blessing he gave Mr. BYLES his Sister's Son, is as follows; <Q>My dear, Child, and my Son, my Son, I bless you; I bless you; I wish you all manner of Blessings! I know not what better to wish you than this, that you be <HI>strong in the Grace</HI> with which our LORD JESUS CHRIST will furnish you, I know not what better to wish you than this, that you may be an Instru∣ment of <HI>displaying</HI> to others <HI>the Beauties &amp; Glories</HI> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. I know not what better to wish you than this, that you may be very fruitful in Projections and <HI>Essays to do Good,</HI> that it may be your Ambition to <HI>bring forth much of that Fruit by which our Heavenly Father may be glorified.</HI> You have been acquainted with my poor <HI>Manner of Living,</HI> even in the more secret Strokes of it; follow what you have found in it agreable to the Pattern of a glorious CHRIST. My dear Son, I do with all possible Affection recommend you to the Blessing of our dear LORD JESUS CHRIST. Take my Hands, and my Heart full of Blessings.</Q></P>
<P>IT would a little discover the <HI>Vanity of the Writer</HI> as well as the <HI>Fondness</HI> of the <HI>Parent,</HI> if I should write all the Doctor said to him in the Blessing He gave him: I shall therefore but just mention the Tenor of it, when on bended Knees his Blessing was asked; <Q>You have been <HI>a dear Son and a pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sant Child</HI> unto me, and I wish you as <HI>many</HI> Blessings as you have done me <HI>Services</HI> which are very many I wish and pray the GOD of ABRAHAM, ISAAC and JACOB may be yours and HIS Blessing rest upon you. I wish that, as you have a Prospect of being serviceable in the World, you may be great and con∣siderable, as the Patriarchs were, by introducing a CHRIST into the World. The Grace of the LORD JESUS CHRIST be with you. AMEN!</Q></P>
<P>HE informed me then, what he would have to be done as to his private Affairs &amp; Pape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and when,
<PB N="156" REF="003188_0178_0FF0150FFA0030B8"/>after several <HI>Rules of private Conduct</HI> given to me which I shall not write, I asked him <HI>what Sentence or Word, what</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>He would have me think on constantly,</HI> for I ever desired to have him before me and hear him speaking to me? He said, <Q>Re∣member only that one word <HI>Fructuosus.</HI></Q> What I have thus written with relation to my self happened on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> two Days before he died.</P>
<P>THE Day before he died he had some Passages read to him out of a Book he printed, entituled <HI>Restitutus,</HI> which Passages he said <HI>He felt, and if</HI> he <HI>had Strength to speak</HI> he <HI>would use the very Words;</HI> I shall tran∣scribe them, for they will supersede <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he mention of <HI>any other</HI> Sentences by which He testified his <HI>Pre∣paredness for Death.</HI> They are as follows from <HI>pag.</HI> 41 of that Book.</P>
<Q><P>IF the Request be granted, and the Felicity of having our SAVIOUR <HI>graciously with us</HI> be obtai∣ned, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Strength</HI> will the <HI>Joy of the LORD</HI> give to us for our Conflict with the <HI>last Enemy?</HI> It is a Passage in the Prophecies of JEREMIAH con∣cerning the <HI>Gospel Day,</HI> which is to pass from the Destruction of the <HI>old Jerusalem</HI> to the Arrival of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w,</HI> when <HI>the LORD our GOD shall come and all his holy ones with him;</HI> Zech. xiv. 7. <HI>It shall come to pass, at Evening Time it shall be Light.</HI> O the <HI>Light,</HI> which a glorious CHRIST <HI>present</HI> with us will give us in the <HI>Evening,</HI> when we ap∣prehend our selves in all the <HI>Darkness</HI> which we should else have to terrify us, when the Curtains of a <HI>Death-Bed</HI> are drawn about us. The <HI>Light</HI> of a Soul passing into <HI>the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> The <HI>Light of an open and abundant Entra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> into the Paradise of GOD!</HI></P>
<P>MAY we have our glorious CHRIST with us, when were are <HI>passing thro' the Fire,</HI> we shall be as unhurt, as untouch'd, as easy as the three Worthi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were in the <HI>fiery Furnace.</HI> By His good SPIRIT
<PB N="157" REF="003188_0179_0FF0151256AF8A78"/>He will now say unto us, <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; Be not dismai'd, for I am thy GOD and SAVIOUR, I will strengthen thee, yea I will assist thee, yea I will uphold thee with the Right Hand of my Righteousness.</HI> Upon the re∣nouncing of all Dependance on our own <HI>Righte∣ousness,</HI> and relying on the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the perfect <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the SON OF GOD stoop∣ing to be our <HI>Surety</HI> paid unto His own Law in our stead, He will <HI>uphold us with the Right Hand of His Righteousness.</HI> Giving us to see our selves furnish'd and cover'd with a <HI>Righteousness</HI> of more Account than the best <HI>Angel</HI> in Heaven may pretend unto, He will enable us to say, <HI>The Gates of Righteousness I see set open for me!</HI> And having a Soul set upon the <HI>Praising</HI> of GOD, greatly affected with the <HI>Praises</HI> of his CHRIST, and strongly desirous to celebrate and propagate, we shall be able to go on and say, <HI>I will go in at those golden Gates; I have something to do within. I will go in and praise the LORD; It is what I have be∣gun to do; and His Praise endureth forever: Ne∣ver, Never shall I give over the Doing of it.</HI></P>
<P>VERILY the <HI>gracious Presence</HI> of our SAVIOUR with us will enable us to Sing <HI>in the Valley of the Shadow of Death</HI> and render it no more than a <HI>Shadow of Death</HI> unto us. It will so set us above the <HI>Fears of Death,</HI> so that if perceiving the <HI>Signs</HI> of it upon us, we be asked, <HI>Are you not frighted!</HI> We shall chearfully reply, <HI>No, not at all! I will not so dishonor a glorious CHRIST as to be af∣frighted at any Thing that can befal me, while I am in His blessed Hands!</HI> It will so mollify the fierce Visage of <HI>Death,</HI> as that if our <HI>Tho'ts</HI> of the <HI>dying Hour</HI> be enquired after, we shall break forth into Triumphs upon it; <HI>O joyful Hour! O welcome Hour! Come Lord JESUS, come quickly. Why is thy Chariot so long a coming?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="003188_0180_0FF01515ACC5F5B8"/>
IN order to this, <HI>the Power of the LORD bring present,</HI> He will enable us to read our <HI>Evidences for Heaven</HI> and see the <HI>evident Tokens of Salvation,</HI> in which He has marked us for those of whom He has declared, <HI>They shall be mine in the Day when I make up my Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>WE shall see, That the <HI>Love of GOD</HI> has caused us to close with it as our Blessedness, and to be ambitious of nothing so much as this, that we may Be and may Do what may be a <HI>grateful Spectacle</HI> unto Him, and be afraid of allowing so much as in the <HI>Tho'ts</HI> &amp; <HI>Frames</HI> of our Hearts, any Thing that He may be displeased at.</P>
<P>WE shall see, That the <HI>Faith</HI> of CHRIST has not only carried us unto Him, to be made <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI> in the Evangelical Way, and be brought by Him unto the full Enjoyment of GOD in a <HI>death∣less</HI> &amp; <HI>sinless</HI> World, but also caused us to take up with Him as our <HI>Alsufficient Portion.</HI></P>
<P>WE shall see, That we have a Spirit of <HI>Benignity</HI> towards our Neighbour, and rejoice in all the Good that may be done unto him.</P>
<P>SEEING these <HI>Marks of the Lamb</HI> upon us, we shall conclude, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I am Thine; and nothing shall pluck me out of thy glorious Hands!</HI> The HOLY SPIRIT of GOD helps the Believer first in a way of rational <HI>Argumentation</HI> to take En∣couragement from <HI>the Things that accompany Sal∣vation</HI> found upon him. And while he is doing so, he breaks in upon the Soul of the Believer in a way of more immediate <HI>Irradiation</HI> and with an over∣powering &amp; overwhelming Efficacy assures him, <HI>The glorious GOD has made Thee one of His Children, and will surely do thee Good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="003188_0181_0FF015180E841080"/>
HE will enable us to feel the <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> begun in our Souls, and a predominant <HI>Respect</HI> unto the great GOD governing of us and enclining us to <HI>acknowlege HIM in all our Ways:</HI> We shall then raise this Conclusion upon it, <HI>Here is a Life begun that can terminate no otherwise than in an Endless Life with my GOD. There is a Well of Water in me that will spring up to everlasting Life. Death, do thy worst; there is no killing of that Life which my GOD has begun to raise me to Have I had a glorious CHRIST living, acting and working in me, and quickening me for Living unto GOD; and will He ever lose His hold of me? No, no; I am sure of Living with Him forevermore!</HI></P></Q>
<P><Q>BUT indeed it is not easy to recite and reckon all the ravishing Reflections, which a CHRIST <HI>graciously present</HI> with a departing Believer may give Him the no <HI>small Consolations of GOD</HI> withal.</Q> —I should here write on further from the 46th Page to the 52; but I remember a few Pages before I gave it you.</P>
<P>THE Doctor died on <HI>February</HI> the thirteenth, which was the Day after his <HI>Birth-Day,</HI> in which his <HI>sixty fifth</HI> Year was consummated. From the Thurs∣day before to <HI>that</HI> Time he was dying of an hard <HI>Cough</HI> and a suffocating <HI>Asthma</HI> with a <HI>Fever;</HI> but he felt no great Pain; he had the sweet <HI>Composure</HI> and <HI>easy Departure,</HI> for which he had entreated so <HI>often</HI> and <HI>fervently</HI> the sovereign Disposer of all Things.</P>
<P><HI>THUS Lived and thus Died</HI> Dr. MATHER, to use the words of one of our Ministers in his Dis∣course on his Death, <HI>the Glory of Learning, and the Ornament of Christianity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. THACHER of <HI>Boston</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="003188_0182_0FF0151A37DF5070"/>
HE was <HI>buried</HI> the Monday following; when <HI>his Church</HI> (which honourably bore the Charge of the Funeral) to testify their superior Regard for their dear Pastor, went <HI>before</HI> the Corpse, while the Honourable WILLIAM D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>MER, our Lieut.

<P>THE <HI>Thursday</HI> before the Burial, the Reverend Mr. COLMAN, preaching at the Lecture on ENOCH'S <HI>Translation,</HI> gave him an handsome Character; and the Sabbath after Mr. GEE considered <HI>the Mourning of Israel for</HI> AARON, and ingeniously applied it unto the mournful Occasion presented unto us.— Mr. PRINCE also preached a funeral Sermon on him from ELISHA'S Lamentation for ELIJAH, wherein he has done my Father a great deal of Justice.— Which Three Ser∣mons together with a Fourth Preach'd by the Doctor's <HI>Son,</HI> in his Father's Pulpit soon after his Death, have been Published among us.</P>
<P>I shall now close the Account of my FATHER'S <HI>Life,</HI> with a <HI>CATALOGUE</HI> of the BOOKS he Publish'd.</P>
<P>CARDAN wrote a Book, <HI>De Libris propriis;</HI> and, says he, <HI>Imitatus sum in hoc scribendi Genere</HI> GALENUM <HI>et</HI> ERASMUM, <HI>qui ambo Catalogum Li∣brorum suorum scripserunt.</HI>—Dr. MATHER like these, was obliged to write <HI>a Catalogue of his Works;</HI> and it was well he did; for otherwise I should not have been able to have given a complete one to the World. He has published <HI>three Hundred and eighty two</HI> Books, as I said before: The <HI>Titles</HI> of which with the <HI>Years</HI> wherein they were emitted are now to be exhibited and to terminate the Life, as a Friend calls him, <HI>of one of the most pious, learned and effec∣tive of Mortals.</HI></P>

<P>HAVING before spoken of the <HI>BIBLIA AMERICANA,</HI> (<HI>pag.</HI> 73.) and at the same time promised that I would give the World a more distinct and particular Account of that Work, I had laid aside the Tho'ts of saying any Thing fur∣ther about it for some time: But being advised by a Gentleman of the sacred Order for whose Judgment I have a great Value, to delineate and describe <HI>here</HI> that Performance, it's Excellency and Usefulness, that so it's inviting Character, being more publick∣ly exposed, may excite Gentlemen, Divines and others to countenance the Publication of it; and being withal convinced that the Proposal is good &amp; proper; I have therefore determined here to add an exact Ac∣count of the BIBLIA AMERICANA.</P>
<P>OR, The SACRED SCRIPTURES of the OLD and NEW-Testament ILLUSTRATED:</P>
<P>IN which, besides the many Thousands of curious Notes that shine in <HI>Ancient</HI> &amp; <HI>Modern</HI> Writers of all Persuasions, and some Essays to explain many Passages from the Observations of <HI>Christian Experience;</HI> there are the following Things observable;
<PB N="184" REF="003188_0206_0FF0154812FC5A00"/>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> THE sacred Scriptures of the Old and New-Testament exhibited, <HI>In the Order of Time,</HI> wherein the several and successive Occurrences may direct to the Placing and Reading of them: which Exhibi∣tion alone will greatly inlighten them, and do the Service of a valuable Commentary.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> AN <HI>Emendation</HI> of our present Version; from the Discoveries of the most learned Philologists from the earliest Ages of sacred Literature down to <HI>Bochart, Calmet</HI> and <HI>Parker:</HI> and a particular notice of those many Instances wherein our greatest Masters of the Original Languages have express'd their wishes to see the common Translation amended and refined.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> A rich Collection of ANTIQUETIES which reflect a Light on the Heavenly Oracles; especially those wherein the <HI>Idolatry, Oeconomicks, Politicks, Agriculture, Architecture, Tacticks, Musick, Habits, Diets,</HI> &amp;c. in former Ages may have some Reference in the sacred Pages to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> THE LAWS of the <HI>Israelitish Nation</HI> inter∣preted, and rescued from the Misinterpretations that some famous Writers have put upon them: contrary to the real <HI>Original</HI> and true <HI>Intention</HI> of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>V.</HI> THE TYPES of the Bible accommodated with their <HI>Antitypes;</HI> by which a wondrous Mixture of sacred <HI>Profit and Pleasure</HI> arises from those Para∣graphs, which seemed to be the least Instructive.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VI.</HI> REMARKS as well for the Illustration of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> as for the Confirmation of the <HI>New,</HI> drawn out of those very unpromising heaps, the TAL∣MUDS and other Jewish Writings.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VII.</HI> NATURAL PHILOSOPHY brought to serve <HI>revealed Religion.</HI> The fairest <HI>Hypotheses</HI> offered of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se grand Revolutions, the <HI>Creating, Drowning</HI> and <HI>Burning</HI> of the World; together with the <HI>Astro∣nomical</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="003188_0207_0FF01549E1C25198"/>Affairs, the <HI>Meteors, Minerals, Vegetables, Animals, Diseases, Anatomical</HI> Curiosities, and what relates to the Invisible World of Good or Evil Spi∣rits, mentioned in these Divine Pages, as they are represented in <HI>the best Tho'ts of our Times.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VIII.</HI> THE CHRONOLOGY of the Bible every where cleared of it's Difficulties — with the most accurate <HI>Harmony of the Gospels</HI> that has yet been offered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. THE sacred GEOGRAPHY; in which there are the situation of <HI>Paradise</HI> and <HI>Palaestine;</HI> with an Account how the <HI>Earth</HI> has been peopled; and a Collection of those many instructive Things, which <HI>Travellers</HI> of unspotted Veracity have contributed for our illumination.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>X.</HI> AN elaborate and entertaining History of the ISRAELITISH NATION in every Place; especially from the Birth of our great REDEEMER to this very Day; with a particular History of the City JERUSA∣LEM under it's wonderful Vicissitudes from the Days of MELCHIZEDER down to ours; of the ancient <HI>Sects</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> and their <HI>present</HI> wretched State, the Relicks of the <HI>Ten</HI> as well as the <HI>Two Tribes</HI> and <HI>where</HI> they are now dispersed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>XI.</HI> THE HISTORIES of all Ages called in to show how the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of the Divine Oracles have had their most punctual Accomplishment; wherein the Reader will find an intire Body of Ecclesiastical Histo∣ry: and modest, but strongly establish'd <HI>Conjectures</HI> on such as yet remain to be fulfilled, and the State of the Church and World in future Ages to the End of Time.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>XII.</HI> THE true Doctrine of the Sabbatical CHI∣LIAD, which more opens and breaks in on the more considerate inquirers as the Day approaches, brought in as a Key to very much of the Wealth which the Church of GOD possesses in this Book of the Kingdom: With the clearest Tho'ts of the most penetrating W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ters on the Apocalypse, rescued from the more a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣trary and indefensible Conceits of superficial Students in the sacred Prophesies.</ITEM>

THE usual Method for the Publication of such a Work, has been by SUBSCRIPTIONS, and in the Proposals to give a computation of the number of Sheets, and the price of the Books to Subscribers in Quires, and when Bound: But in the present Case the precise Number of Sheets cannot easily be known, which will occasion something of uncertainty.</P>
<P>However, IT is supposed that the Work will be contained in <HI>Three Volumns</HI> in FOLIO, and may be afforded for between <HI>Three</HI> &amp; <HI>Four Pounds Sterling;</HI> and in <HI>New-England</HI> Money according as the Exchange shall then be. Whoever shall Subscribe and Pay for <HI>Ten Sets</HI> shall have <HI>One</HI> Gratis, which will con∣siderably reduce the price. And as a farther Motive, it may be said, That this Performance will not inter∣fere with the Works of the Excellent POOL, BURRIT, or HENRY: It being the constant study of the Au∣thor to avoid it, and in this to add whatever other curious things have yet been publish'd on the sacred Scriptures.</P>
<P>SUBSCRIPTIONS will be taken by <HI>Samuel Gerrish, Daniel H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nchman</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hancock</HI> Booksellers, in <HI>Boston;</HI> and as soon as there shall appear sufficient Encouragement, the <HI>Manuscripts</HI> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sent to <HI>London</HI> to be Printed there, with all convenient Expedition, and Care will be taken of the Paper, Printing and Binding, that it be suitable to such a Work.</P>
