<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING had a transient view of the follow∣ing Poetic Compositions, composed by the Author at about twenty years of age, they appear to me to dis∣play the traits of a genius propitiously fostered by the Muses; and give a specimen of what might be expected from the same Author, having arrived to riper years, under the cultivation of experience and reading, and especially the influence of a more serious and heavenly turn of mind; which tends not only to elevate and clarify the Parnassian Font, but to give its streams a more happy direction:—I can, therefore, recommend them to the public perusal.</P>

<HEAD>An Elegy on the death of the Rev. <HI>John Ogilvie,</HI> D. D. who departed this life the 26th Nov. <HI>1774.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SAY, weeping Muse, what means that passing bell!</L>
<L>What breathless corse demands that solemn knell!</L>
<L>What soul, departed, moves in sad parade</L>
<L>To Death's cold mansions, and the gloomy shade?</L>
<L>But, ah! methinks the fatal news is spread,</L>
<L>And fame proclaims, that <HI>Ogilvie</HI> is dead.</L>
<L>The pious <HI>Ogilvie!</HI> is he no more!</L>
<L>Then Zion mourn, thy heavy loss deplore;</L>
<L>In solemn grief command thy tears to flow,</L>
<L>And bid each bosom swell with anxious woe:</L>
<L>Let all thy courts in sable robes be hung,</L>
<L>And fun'ral dirges sound from ev'ry tongue:</L>
<L>Thy faithful Pastor, from thy bosom torn,</L>
<L>His charge to keep, shall never more return.</L>
<L>(Yet, could our grief, or floods of tears, oh Death!</L>
<L>Restore him spirit, and his vital breath;</L>
<L>That frame inanimate, again should live,</L>
<L>And thou thy victim to existence give:</L>
<L>But vain is grief, when life's extinct and fled;</L>
<L>The sluggish mass returns not from the dead;</L>
<L>Nor sorrow, tears, or mourning, can retrieve</L>
<L>The clay-cold victim from the op'ning grave.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Speak ye, his Fav'rite, once peculiar care,</L>
<L>How vast his worth, how great his virtues were:</L>
<L>Say, with what grace his heav'nly accents flow'd—</L>
<L>How much he lov'd, how much rever'd his God:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="021882_0004_0FB5ED4709EEADC8"/>What strong conviction, to his precepts join'd,</L>
<L>Alarm'd each thoughtless, unbelieving mind:</L>
<L>Whilst harden'd sinners trembled as they sate,</L>
<L>Struck with the horrors of their dang'rous state,</L>
<L>Their past offences in contrition mourn'd,</L>
<L>And, sorrowing, sought the God they once had scorn'd.</L>
<L>This, happy Saint, was here thy great employ—</L>
<L>To serve thy God, thy sole, thy only joy:</L>
<L>But time, and sense, are now with thee no more;</L>
<L>Past are thy labours, and thy cares are o'er:</L>
<L>Thy soul, enlarg'd, mounts the celestial road,</L>
<L>And Seraphs safe conduct thee to thy God;</L>
<L>Myriads of Angels thy arrival wait,</L>
<L>And hail thy ent'rance in Jerus'lem's gate;</L>
<L>Whilst Heav'ns high arch with shouts of triumph rings,</L>
<L>And loud Hosannas to the King of kings:</L>
<L>There, full fruition is thy just reward,</L>
<L>And thou art happy in thy Saviour Lord;</L>
<L>With Saints made perfect, thou thy song shall raise,</L>
<L>And spend a whole eternity in praise.</L>

<HEAD>An Elegy on the death of Miss <HI>Polly Preston,</HI> who died December 26th, <HI>1781.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE sprightly fair, who form the sportive train,</L>
<L>And follow on in pleasure's flowery maze,</L>
<L>Permit the Muse to urge her plaintive strain,</L>
<L>And court your int'rest, tho' unmov'd by praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard is the task—experience speaks it hard—</L>
<L>Nor dare her fondest, warmest hopes presume</L>
<L>The moral lesson will ensure regard,</L>
<L>Or truths impress, tho' issuing from the tomb:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="021882_0005_0FB5ED483916B348"/>
<L>Yet, o'er the counsels of <HI>Maria</HI> dwell,</L>
<L>Nor fiction this, from Poets' fancy penn'd;</L>
<L>These, from her lips, in fault'ring accents fell—</L>
<L>The dying tribute to her weeping friend.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And art thou come, <HI>Eliza,</HI> to behold</L>
<L>The last sad struggle of her sinking frame,</L>
<L>Who soon shall be in death's long lists enroll'd,</L>
<L>And to the number, add <HI>Maria's</HI> name?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Swift speeds the time, when from its kindred clay</L>
<L>The soul, unloos'd, shall wing her rapid flight</L>
<L>To worlds unknown—explore the mystic way—</L>
<L>Launch'd in the vast abyss of infinite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, oh! e'er yet I to the world am lost,</L>
<L>And bid my final, long and sad adieu,</L>
<L>My lab'ring mind, 'midst various conflicts tost,</L>
<L>Still owns the friendship that it bore for you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the drear symptoms of the swift decay!</L>
<L>The languid eye-ball, and the nerve unstrung!</L>
<L>My feeble pulse almost forbears to play,</L>
<L>And speech, abortive, dies upon my tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mark well the solemn, the instructive scene!</L>
<L>View youth and vigour here enfeebled lie!</L>
<L>Oh! say, what less can the sad import mean—</L>
<L>Loud is the call,—Ye young! prepare to die!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shun, then, my friend, each fond, delusive joy;</L>
<L>Give their full worth—and Vanity's the sum;</L>
<L>Let solemn themes the Heav'n-born mind employ,</L>
<L>And seek the pleasures of a world to come:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Flee the vain follies of the thoughtless age,</L>
<L>As far below the wise immortal's care;</L>
<L>Obey the precepts of the inspir'd page,</L>
<L>And learn to trace sublime enjoyment there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The humble suppliant at the throne of grace,</L>
<L>In ardent breathings, let your suit arise;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="021882_0006_0FB5ED499301B130"/>Nor rest estranged from your Maker's face;—</L>
<L>So shall <HI>Eliza</HI> be sincerely wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She spake;—and scarce the solemn charge enjoin'd,</L>
<L>E'er gasping nature spent its feeble breath;</L>
<L>When the Fair Monitor her life resign'd,</L>
<L>And bow'd a victim to relentless death!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye youths, who bore the torpid Maid's remains,</L>
<L>The ghastly reliques of once ripening bloom,</L>
<L>In sad procession o'er your native plains,</L>
<L>And round her clos'd the deeply yawning tomb;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where now the charms of the attractive fair!</L>
<L>The blushing cheek, and brightly sparkling eye!</L>
<L>She's gone—forever gone!—to moulder where</L>
<L>Youth, wit and beauty, unexampled lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, then, ye gay, forget the recent blow,</L>
<L>Exhaust your strength, your wonted sports pursue;</L>
<L>Indulge your mirth, and spend your prime; but know</L>
<L>There is a God—a God of judgment too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pardon the thought! Far hence be strains severe;</L>
<L>Let Reason urge her long unheeded claim;</L>
<L>With def'rence due the friendly voice revere,</L>
<L>Nor longer frustrate her ingenuous aim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could you convene to form the giddy throng,</L>
<L>And to the viol dance with airy tread?</L>
<L>Deaf to reflection, act the double wrong,</L>
<L>Degrade the living, and insult the dead?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence let not grov'ling sense the sceptre wield;</L>
<L>Ye young, be taught from this the Almighty's rod;</L>
<L>Let baseless joys to bliss substantial yield,</L>
<L>Aspire, and seek your happiness in God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So shall your youth's be nobly crown'd indeed,</L>
<L>And years come fraught with wisdom's sweet increase;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="021882_0007_0FB5ED4B121B6428"/>To lives well spent the promis'd Heav'n succeed,</L>
<L>And death's kind summons waft your souls to peace.</L>

<HEAD>An Elegy on the death of Mrs. <HI>Ann Platt,</HI> who died January 17th, <HI>1788,</HI> in the 74th year of her age.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SHE's gone! she's wing'd her flight from earth to Heav'n;</L>
<L>But, oh! thy virtues yield a rich perfume;</L>
<L>Blest saint! of these thy native plains the flow'r,</L>
<L>And but transplanted in yon Heav'n to bloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of softest manners, and affections mild,</L>
<L>Grace was in thee conspicuous to be seen;</L>
<L>Kindness, the language of thy heav'n-born soul,</L>
<L>Thy ev'ry action, gentle and serene:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="021882_0009_0FB5ED5652807B10"/>
<L>Calm as the bosom of the op'ning morn—</L>
<L>Thy countenance, with wisdom mark'd, divine;</L>
<L>Blest wisdom, mild descending from above,</L>
<L>By thy meek Master taught, thy face did shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From thee, the needy had their calls supply'd;</L>
<L>Each child of Want was welcome to thy store:</L>
<L>Thy lib'ral hands the gen'rous alms bestow'd,</L>
<L>And Indigence went smiling from thy door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tatter'd Orphan claim'd thy constant care;</L>
<L>Thy kind relief made glad the Widow's heart;</L>
<L>And Wand'rers fed, left blessings at thy door—</L>
<L>Griev'd from such undeserved worth to part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The num'rous Houshold, but of slender board,</L>
<L>From thee, a grateful competency drew;</L>
<L>The Mother, o'er the meal, spoke forth thy praise,</L>
<L>And Prattlers small, their Benefactress knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy counsel kind, drawn from the sacred page,</L>
<L>Oft from thy God receiv'd the pray'd success;</L>
<L>Reviv'd the Child of Woe, to whom address'd,</L>
<L>And calm'd the heaving bosom of distress.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In holy Prudence, pattern reach'd by none—</L>
<L>Unequall'd continence of Speech was thine;</L>
<L>Oh grant, Great Source! whence all her worth she drew,</L>
<L>Thy Suppliant's prayer, and make her silence mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where the diseas'd, on beds of sickness lay,</L>
<L>And wasting pains wore out the less'ning frame;</L>
<L>O'er them thou stood, with unremitted care,</L>
<L>To heal, or mitigate their iils, thy aim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From converse oft, with sacred writ inspir'd▪</L>
<L>Fraught with its truths, with grace teem'd forth thy mind;</L>
<L>Canaan's mild heav'nly dialect was thine,</L>

<L>Eager each precept heard, and with delight</L>

<L>While bright Coelestials, in yon shining realms,</L>

<L>Welcome thy heav'n-born spirit to the skies,</L>

<HEAD>A Night Piece.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN the pleasing gloom of Night,</L>
<L>Let me steal from mortal sight;</L>
<L>Oft, unnotic'd, may I rove</L>
<L>Through the shady, darksome grove:</L>
<L>Where pale Cynthia's feeble beam,</L>
<L>Glimmers o'er the gurg'ling stream;</L>
<L>And sweet Philomela's notes,</L>
<L>Eccho'd from harmonious grotts,</L>

<L>By the tuneful Nine inspir'd—</L>
<L>My soul with soft emotion fir'd—</L>
<L>Pour the gently pleasing verse,</L>
<L>And fancy'd reveries rehearse.</L>
<L>Wheresoe'er I turn my sight,</L>
<L>'Tis all Enchantment, all delight:</L>
<L>The moping Owl's discordant strains,</L>
<L>With uncouth music fills the plains:</L>
<L>Here the Rill that winding flows,</L>
<L>Murm'ring, tempts to sweet repose.</L>
<L>To the faintly lunar ray,</L>
<L>The little fry their gambols play;</L>
<L>Now, near the surface of the tide,</L>
<L>Adown the shining current glide;</L>
<L>Now, in shoals, pursuing seem,</L>
