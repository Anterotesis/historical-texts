<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE favorable reception which the First Book of ARISTOCRACY has met with from an indulgent Public, encourages the Editor to proceed in the Publication; and, agreeable to his engagement, to present the Second Book to the notice of his Fellow-Citizens. As he ex∣pected, various judgments have appeared respect∣ing the Work; but he is happy to observe that all have not misapprehended him. While he ac∣knowledges, with gratitude, his obligations to some, who have been pleased to express them∣selves favorably of his principles and design, he thinks it his duty to declare that he has been grossly misconceived by others: and he further esteems it incumbent upon him to make known his determination not to be deterred from the ex∣ercise of, what he considers, an inalienable right, by the threatened, or actual, interference of any man; how highly soever he may rank in the good opinion of a certain description of Ame∣ricans.</P>

<HEAD>ARISTOCRACY. BOOK SECOND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WASH'D by the tempest of the gloomy night,</L>
<L>Mild rose the morn, in blushing beauty bright.</L>
<L>Cheerful the hinds awake, from short repose,</L>
<L>Cheerful the city's busy swarms arose.</L>
<L>But, on his couch, to troublous dreams a prey,</L>
<L>In interrupted sleep, ARISTUS lay.</L>
<L>Vainly he languish'd for refreshing rest—</L>
<L>Unkind deserter of the anxious breast—</L>
<L>And vainly strove in Lethean dews to steep</L>
<L>Th'increasing woes of his perturbed sleep;</L>
<L>When now, from SATAN sent, a bolder dream,</L>
<L>On quivering wings, with ampler message came;</L>
<L>And, lightly hovering o'er th'unconscious Sage,</L>
<L>Bade visionary scenes his mind engage.</L>
<L>ARISTUS saw—when lo! before his eyes,</L>
<L>A stately dome majestic seem'd to rise:</L>
<L>Wide opes the portal, wide the hall expands,</L>
<L>And, full in view, a sumptuous banquet stands.</L>
<L>Around, of various ages, different tongues,</L>
<L>From many doors, rush in the num'rous throngs;</L>
<L>And, with obeisance low, and studied phrase,</L>
<L>Of endless gratitude, and pompous praise,</L>
<L>To one, unknown, aloft, to view display'd,</L>
<L>The gathering crowd their uncouth homage paid.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="028172_0004_0FD7354E23967170"/>
Astonish'd at a scene so strange, the Chief</L>
<L>Dar'd not withhold, yet scarce could grant belief;</L>
<L>And round him look'd, with anxious doubts opprest—</L>
<L>When thus the MAN unknown the Chief addrest.</L>
<L>"Why stands ARISTUS wrapt in mute suspence?</L>
<L>"Why bears he still this lethargy of sense?</L>
<L>"Rouse thee ARISTUS! burst thy slothful bands!</L>
<L>"Thy genius asks it, and the time demands.</L>
<L>"Behold, from distant —'s favouring realm,</L>
<L>"I come, in might thy rivals to o'erwnelm.</L>
<L>"By me shall Order's tyrant spells be broke—"</L>
<L>The Vision vanisht, and the Hero 'woke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when an army, far from friendly aid,</L>
<L>Retiring, flee the land they dar'd invade;</L>
<L>And, night succeeding night, a short repose,</L>
<L>Prone on his arms, is all the warrior knows;</L>
<L>What time the morning casts a doubtful gleam,</L>
<L>Hear sudden burst the foe's revengeful scream;</L>
<L>The loud drums beat, sonorous trumpets sound;</L>
<L>Rude clash of arms, and horses shake the ground;</L>
<L>Start from deluding sleep, and rush to war—</L>
<L>So, from his couch, ARISTUS sprang—with fear.</L>
<L>What could the portent mean? In deep amaze,</L>
<L>He turns it in his mind a thousand ways;</L>
<L>Doubt after doubt disturbs his labouring brain;</L>
<L>And all his long conjectures prove in vain.</L>
<L>At length, joy-stricken, and with glad surprize,</L>
<L>"Can it be so?" the enraptur'd hero cries—</L>
<L>"O if it be, in nature's ample round,</L>
<L>"Blest as ARISTUS, can there one be found?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had he ended, when the door expands,</L>
<L>And in his presence faithful Janus stands.</L>
<L>"O Chief belov'd!" began the duteous slave—</L>
<L>"Your kind attention let your servant crave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"A gallant vessel, from the — shore,</L>
<L>"The gale of eve within our harbour bore.</L>
<L>"Strait to the strand our eager townsmen fly,</L>
<L>"And raise to Heaven the loud, rejoicing cry:</L>
<L>"The crew re-echo, and, with agile bound,</L>
<L>"Spring from the lofty sides, and tread the ground.</L>
<L>"Upon the distant deck, of noblest height,</L>
<L>"A man majestic met our wondering sight;</L>
<L>"Who, slow descending, with a splendid train,</L>
<L>"Seem'd proudly pleas'd, our peaceful shore to gain.</L>
<L>"ENVOY to us, we learnt, the stranger came:</L>
<L>"Each breast with rapture kindled at his name:</L>
<L>"Loud thundering cannon hail'd him to our shore,</L>
<L>"And shouting thousands to his mansion bore;</L>

"And, on this day, this morn, with costly eare,</L>
<L>"A feast fraternal for his sake prepare <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the remarkable coincidence of this relation with the passage, in the speech of SATAN, noticed in the First Book, the Editor, (from the difficulty he meets with in attempting to connect these circumstances with the arrival of any Foreigner to this country) still adheres to his opinion—That they are mere poetical additions to the fact.</NOTE>."</L>
<L>As one, who meets a serpent in his way,</L>
<L>Stands riveted to earth, in pale dismay;</L>
<L>But, slow recovering from his icy dread,</L>
<L>Exclaims in rapture when he finds it dead;</L>
<L>So far'd the Chief: his soul within him died,</L>
<L>So near the vision with the truth allied <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Behold here a new proof of the Poet's profound knowledge of the human heart. ARISTUS, who believes neither in the existence of God, or Futurity, this very ARISTUS is terrified by a dream. An ac∣cidental resemblance between what past in sleep, and what took place in reality, shakes his soul with dread, who fears not to deny an intelligent Creator.—O mad philosophy!</NOTE>;"</L>
<L>But, when he found his warmest hopes surpast,</L>
<L>Aside the apprehensive gloom he cast;</L>
<L>Bade faithful Janus from the room depart,</L>
<L>And feasted on the rapture of his heart:</L>
<L>Then, issuing forth, exulting in his thought,</L>
<L>High on his chariot thron'd, the neighbouring city sought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meantime, with busy care, and zealous haste,</L>
<L>The people strove to build the rich repast.</L>
<L>Three days of feasting all the city knew,</L>
<L>Nor on the fourth to homely fare withdrew.</L>
<L>But thou, O Muse, the tedious task forego</L>
<L>To deck, in lofty verse, the loathsome show;</L>
<L>Waste not thy powers o'er Bacchanalian boards;</L>
<L>Kings be thy theme—Chiefs, Ministers, and Lords.</L>
<L>Yet say, O say, when now from crowds retir'd,</L>
<L>Crowds who his person gaz'd, his speech admir'd,</L>
<L>What thoughts within the ENVOY'S bosom dwelt,</L>
<L>What hopes he harbour'd, and what wishes felt.</L>
<L>Silent a while the lonely room he cours'd,</L>
<L>Then, from his lips, these accents, joyful, burst.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O glorious presage of most sure success!</L>
<L>"What aid unlook'd for comes, my cause to bless!</L>
<L>"O fortune happier, more resplendent, far,</L>
<L>"Than all the trophies of victorious war!</L>
<L>"The recompence of art, how high, how great!</L>

<L>"Thou, luckless Sage! wast fated to contend,</L>

The blank might readily be filled by inserting the name <HI>Dundas</HI>—as that is the name of a well-known Minister of State; and moreover the disposi∣tion of the syllables is agreeable to the melody of the verse. But the apostrophe to the Spirit of this Minister (whoever he is) forms an ob∣jection to the idea of its being Mr. <HI>Dundas,</HI> as he is still living. On consulting a literary friend, to whom I shewed this Book, as I was pre∣paring the notes, &amp;c.—and stating my difficulties in attempting to solve the question—he suggested, that, possibly, a recurrence to the History of the Treaty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of 1732, might afford a solution.—The reader must determine.</NOTE>.</L>

<L>Thus spake the ENVOY—while his bosom hides</L>
<L>The guile which o'er his secret thoughts presides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With the fifth morn, his home ARISTUS sought;</L>
<L>His heart with joy, with schemes his head was fraught;</L>
<L>For, on that day, his house and social board</L>
<L>Were doom'd to greet the ENVOY, by their Lord.</L>
<L>He came; the feast was spread; the gen'rous wine</L>
<L>In the cup sparkles; all their faces shine.</L>
<L>And now the Sun, declining, sought the main,</L>
<L>And eve commenc'd her mild and sober reign;</L>
<L>Fled were the dishes, and the mingling fume,</L>
<L>Of coffee and tobacco, fill'd the room;</L>
<L>When, from his lofty seat, the mighty MAN,</L>
<L>To great ARISTUS, earnest, thus began.</L>
</LG>

<L>"Say, noble Chief, nor deem th'inquiry bold,</L>
<L>"To me, thy country's annals deign t'unfold.</L>
<L>"Her wars and sufferings thro' the east resound,</L>

"And, to th'astonish'd universe declares,</L>
<L>"Like you she feels, like you, for freedom, dares<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing could be more consistent with the principles on which the ENVOY acted, than this address to ARISTUS. ARISTUS, the native of a republic, and sustaining an office of high trust and dignity in the councils of that republic, would not be supposed hostile to liberty. We shall see, hereafter, with what address he discloses his real feelings; and how readily the ENVOY, once acquainted with them, adapts his lan∣guage and conduct to them.</NOTE>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But of events so glorious, to inquire,</L>
<L>"Would shew a careless mind, a mean desire;</L>
<L>"Conspicuous and sublime, they seize the heart,</L>

<L>"What schemes ambition, rivalry, and sear,</L>

<L>"O Sage renoun'd!" ARISTUS swift replies—</L>
<L>"On actions past I turn unwilling eyes.</L>

<L>"And now, thro' jealousy, or fear, or hate,</L>
<L>"Fierce opposition rose in many a State:</L>

<L>"GERRY, whose alter'd mind, in one short year,</L>

<L>"Once prejudic'd, whose spleen no art can charm:</L>
<L>"Thee, LUTHER MARTIN, whose loquacious tongue,</L>
<L>"Thy State throughout, the loud alarum rung:</L>

<L>"Redoubted MASON! challenger of steel!</L>

<L>"A few, by changing, or by constant hate,</L>

<L>"And what the cause?" the ENVOY quick demands.</L>
<L>Solemn, ARISTNS lifts on high his hands—</L>

<L>He cries, "I well might bid a long adieu,</L>
<L>"A lasting farewell, to all craftful aid;</L>
