<HEAD>THE CHARACTER OF A <HI>True PATRIOT.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS xxxii. 11, 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And <HI>Moses</HI> besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why doth thy Wrath wax hot against thy People, which thou hast brought forth out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> with great Power, and with a mighty Hand.</P>
<P>Wherefore should the <HI>Egyptians</HI> speak and say, For Mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the Mountains, and to consume them from the Face of the Earth? Turn from thy fierce Wrath, and repent of this Evil against thy People.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Excellency of the christian Religion is very apparent from it's natural Tendency to promote the Welfare and Happiness of Man∣kind. An universal Conformity to the moral Precepts thereof, wou'd make this now miserable Earth, a very Heaven
<PB N="6" REF="005706_0004_1026C8D491E25A98"/>for Pleasure and Delight. All its Lessons are grand and noble, infinitely superiour to the most refined Maxims of an <HI>Epictetus</HI> or a <HI>Seneca.</HI> So yonder Sun outvies the lesser Stars, and when it sends forth it's more radiant Beams, they disap∣pear. Numberless admirable Rules for the Re∣gulation of our Conduct in the World, so as to be Ornaments to Society, and Blessings to our Fellow-Creatures, are scattered in the sacred Ora∣cles. Among them all, none more worthy of our Notice than those which plead for and enjoin a Spirit of Generosity and Disinterestedness. Thus God by the Apostle commands, Phil. 2.3, 4, 5. <HI>In Lowliness of Mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man on the Things of others. Let this Mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.</HI> When that divine Redeemer cloathed himself with humane Flesh, Angels proclaim'd the joyful News in that surprising Language, <HI>Unto you,</HI> for you, <HI>is born this Day, in the City of</HI> David, <HI>the Saviour, who is the Christ, the Lord.</HI> Jesus was born <HI>for us.</HI> His very Birth was ap∣pointed for <HI>our</HI> Benefit. 'Tis also true, no Man comes into the World for himself. We are born for God, for the Laws, for our Neighbours, for our Country. No One of us is independant. No One of us has an absolute and sovereign Right over himself. When we are born, the Laws, the Common-Wealth, our Friends may say, <HI>To us, for us,</HI> he is born. This is a Truth plainly taught by the Light of Nature. Accordingly, ancient History informs us of whole Nations who were
<PB N="7" REF="005706_0005_1026C8D769858058"/>instructed from their Infancy to look upon the Welfare of their Country as the grand Design of their Life, and the End of all their Labours; nor did their Tutors fail to teach them, that in Para∣dise there were exalted Seats for those, who had contributed to the Glory and Grandeur of their Country. Train'd up in such noble Sentiments, many a brave Soul carried this Virtue of Love to their Country to a sublime Pitch, and thus have immortaliz'd their Names among Mankind. While Time and Days shall endure, the generous and the heroic Part of our Race, will revere the Names of a <HI>Codrus,</HI> a <HI>Camillus,</HI> a <HI>Regulus,</HI> and many others, who greatly sacrific'd their Lives for the Good of their Country.</P>
<P>Thanks to the divine Being, Christianity is not destitute of Heroes. The sacred Oracles furnish us with <HI>Instances</HI> of true Bravery, after having in∣structed us what true Bravery is. There we meet with a <HI>Moses,</HI> whose flaming Love to his Country, carried him thro' innumerable Difficul∣ties, and has made his Name renowned in the Church of Christ thro' all Generations. This <HI>Moses</HI> is the Hero, whose Character we are now to lay before you, and in him give you an Exam∣ple of a noble Patriot, a true Friend to his Coun∣try. Whatever can aggrandise humane Nature, whatever can add a charming Lustre to One in a publick Station, is to be found in <HI>Moses.</HI> This we shall now briefly lay before you for your Imi∣tation, and to draw forth your Praises to God who raises up many, many a <HI>Moses,</HI> even in these sinful Days.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="005706_0006_1026C8DA6023E3D8"/>1. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man of strict <HI>Devotion.</HI> His Prayers, oh how frequent, how fervent, how ef∣ficacious! Take this One Instance of his prevalent Applications to the God of all Grace. When he sees that the Lord is angry with his People, and just going to strike the fatal Blow, his Love to his Country sets him upon praying, and he prays with such a flaming Zeal, that God repents him of the Evil which he tho't to do unto them. See the Account in our Context, <HI>v.</HI> 7,—12. What did <HI>Abraham</HI> for that City, which served as a Place of Refuge for Part of his Family, when God threatens them with utter Destruction? His Zeal sets him a praying, and he addresses God in that forcible Language, Gen. 18. <HI>Wilt thou, Lord, destroy the Righteous with the Wicked? Peradven∣ture there shall be found in the City, fifty, forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, yea, ten righteous Per∣sons, wilt thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t spare the Place for their Sakes?</HI></P>
<P>In this Devotion we see a good Patriot. All our Concerns, all our Undertakings, must be com∣mended to the Blessing of Heaven, by importu∣nate Prayer. Far, far from us be the impious Thought, that we have no need of the Assistance of Heaven in our warlike Engagements, and that our Armies and Fleets are sufficient of themselves for gaining the Victory. 'Tis false Heroism, nay, 'tis Madness, to trust in our own Bow, and to say, that our own Sword shall save us: Negligent of the most High, careless of engaging his Favour upon our Knees—Never call him a Friend to his Country, who is not a Man of Prayer, and who delights not in pouring out his Supplications
<PB N="9" REF="005706_0007_1026C8DD2ED11F68"/>to the Governour of the Universe for Success in every lawful Enterprize. Thy Walls, O <HI>Louis∣bourg,</HI> shall stand to the latest Generations [may they stand the Possession of the <HI>British</HI> Nation] an ungainsayable Proof, that the watchful Eye of God's Providence is over the Righteous, and his Ear attentive to their ardent Cries. Infidelity shall stop it's Mouth, or humbly acknowledge, that there is a God in the Heavens who hears Prayer, and thro' Jesus, the only Mediator, will answer the Requests of his Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man set for <HI>Reformation</HI> To a flaming Devotion, he join'd a Spirit of Amend∣ment. When he once went forth to visit his Brethren, and saw two <HI>Hebrews</HI> sinfully striving together, he said to him that did the Wrong, <HI>Wherefore smitest thou thy Follow?</HI> Exod. 2.13. He would fain rectify whatever was amiss among his Countrymen. When <HI>Nehemiah</HI> found the Crimes of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to exceed their Miseries, he immediately strives to bring about a Reformation. He banished from the Land, griping Usury, hor∣rid Oppression, Prophanation of the Sabbath, and mixt Marriages with the idolatrous Heathen; and by his own Example taught them Charity and Generosity towards the Poor. What signi∣fies it to rend the Heaven with our Cries for Mercy and Help, if we will hold fast our Iniqui∣ties? Has not the God of Truth spoken in his Vengeance, saying, <HI>When ye spread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear, your Hands
<PB N="10" REF="005706_0008_1026C8E01049E818"/>are full of Blood,</HI> Isai. 1.15. What signisies it to raise Armies and sit out Fleets, if they consist of none but the Vile, Men who are perpetually vomiting out their Blasphemies against Heaven, and waging open War with the Lord of Hosts. What signify Laws of Policy, if the Laws of Vir∣tue are trampled under Feet; if God's Sabbaths are violated, if his Name is profaned, if his Reli∣gion is flouted at? What signifies it to enter into Alliances with earthly Princes, if we are not re∣conciled to the God of Heaven? In a Word, What signify good Politicks if we are bad Chris∣tians, or English Bravery in our Breasts, if our Hearts are uncircumcis'd to fear the Lord of Hosts? The Soldier should, like <HI>David,</HI> be a Man of God, as well as a Man of War! Soldiers pre∣par'd for Death by an anticipated Repentance, will fight with Courage, and meet Dangers with Intrepidity: But, alas, when Soldiers carry about with them a guilty Conscience, when by the Blaze of Cannon they view the eternal Flames of Hell, and see the Horrors of Damnation succeeding the Horrors of an Engagement, they usually fight with Reluctance, and strive to skreen themselves from future Misery by flying from present Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man of great <HI>Mortification.</HI> The Severities of Fasting he was well acquainted with. When God cammanded him to sanctify the People for the giving forth the Law to them, we read, that he sanctify'd them for three Days together, that is, by a solemn Fast, and an entire Abstinence even from the lawful Pleasures of
<PB N="11" REF="005706_0009_1026C8E19552D4F0"/>Life; for, he suffered not an <HI>Israelite</HI> to come near his Consort during the three Days, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.14, 15. When <HI>Esther</HI> was resolved to sacrifice her All, for the Deliverance of her beloved Peo∣ple, she gives that Commission to <HI>Mordecai, Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in</HI> Shushan, <HI>and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three Days, Night nor Day: I also and my Maidens will fast likewise, and so will I go in unto the King, which is not according to the Law; and if I perish, I perish,</HI> Esth. 4.16. Far be it from us to abandon our selves to Mirth and Jollity, when the Liberties of our Country are in a totter∣ing Condition, and the State is threatned with the Blows of Heaven. Woe, Woe, ten thousand Woes to him, that is not grieved at the Afflictions of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and that can meditate on the dying Groans of the brave Soldier, expiring in the Cause of Liberty and Virtue, without the Emotions of Tenderness and Compassion! The God of Hea∣ven shall resent the Injury, and punish the Cri∣minal with a Vengeance. Attend to his own Words, in Isai. 22.12. <HI>In that Day did the Lord God of Hosts call to Weeping and to Mourning, and to Baldness, and to girding with Sackeloth: And behold, Joy and Gladness, slaying Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Flesh and drinking Wine; and ye said, Let us eat and drink, for To-morrow we die. And it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of Hosts, Surely this Iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</HI> The Zeal of a good Patriot will incline him to join with the solemn Assemblies of <HI>Zion,</HI> when the
<PB N="12" REF="005706_0010_1026C8E4D22C7F10"/>Trumpet is blown, a Fast sanctified, and the Priests of the Lord address him, weeping, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach, that the Heathen should rule over them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man of profound <HI>Prudence.</HI> When he was informed by God, that he must go to the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and demand a Permission for the Israelitish Nation to depart his Land, he modestly declines the Service, from a Fear that he was not equal to it. <HI>Oh my Lord,</HI> says he, <HI>send I pray thee by the Hand of him, whom thou wilt send;</HI> that is, by some Person more fit for the Business than I am, <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.13. And in all his Messages to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> you see a Spirit of Prudence and Caution accompanying his whole Carriage: But especially, what admirable Prudence, as well as Faith, does he discover, when to says to <HI>Joshua,</HI> upon Notice given him that <HI>Amalek</HI> was come forth to fight against <HI>Israel,</HI> as in Exod. 17.9. <HI>Chuse us out Men, and go out, fight with</HI> Amalek: <HI>Tomorrow I will stand upon the Top of the Hill with the Rod of God in my Hand.</HI> The same Spi∣rit of Prudence you observe in that excellent Go∣vernour <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> when his Nation was in great Distress. No Language can equal his own Ac∣count of his wise Conduct. <HI>Neh.</HI> 2.12, 13, 15, 16. I arose <HI>in the Night,</HI> I and some few Men with me, neither told I any Man what God had put in my Heart to do at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And I went out <HI>by Night,</HI> by the Gate of the Valley, and view'd the Walls of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> which were broken down,
<PB N="13" REF="005706_0011_1026C8E8B10BFFF0"/>and the Gates thereof which were consumed by Fire. Then I went up <HI>in the Night</HI> by the Brook and viewed the Wall, and turned back and en∣tred by the Gate of the Valley, and so returned. And the Rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did. Such Governours, such Officers de∣serve the Good-Wishes and the Thanks of the whole Commonwealth. They are a rich Present from Heaven. When they are taken away, and Men of an opposite Character are put in their Room, 'tis a Token of God's Indignation against a People. Sad was the Condition, when God said, as in Isai. 3.12. <HI>As for my People, Children are their Oppressors, and Women rule over them: Oh my People, they which lead ye cause ye to err, and destroy the Way of thy Paths.</HI> Wisdom was the first Favour which <HI>Solomon</HI> requested of Hea∣ven when he ascended the Throne, and Wisdom is that Virtue, whose Praises he has sung in that inimitable Strain, Prov. 8.15, 16. <HI>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI> One Way, whereby ancient <HI>Rome</HI> rose to its su∣perior Glory was this: They kept at the utmost Distance from false Heroism, insomuch that they equally abhorr'd a rash Commander as a cowardly One; and they had an insurmountable Aversion for military Deceit and Trickishness, so that when One of their Generals <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> gained a Victory over a <HI>Macedonian</HI> Prince by flattering him with Hopes of a Peace, the Senate judged that he got the
<PB N="14" REF="005706_0012_1026C8EA34087710"/>Conquest in open Violation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws and Customs, which ordain that Conquests should be made by Courage and not by Fraud.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man of admirable <HI>Watchfulness.</HI> By means of his wakeful Temper, he was in∣comparably well fitted for a publick Station. When he was commanded of God to deliver his Messages to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> respecting the Safety of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Ruin of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Nation, we find that he rose up <HI>early in the Morning</HI> to do as the Lord had commanded him, <HI>Exod.</HI> 9. An idle, indolent, unactive Man is altogether unfit for a Post, either in the Magistracy or the Ministry, the Fleet or the Army. It was an excellent Say∣ing of that renowned Monarch <HI>Vespasian,</HI> That an Emperor ought to die <HI>standing.</HI> His whole Life was a charming Coment on this Text, and <HI>Rome</HI> was more indebted to him for his Vigilance, than to any other of her Generals. An Officer should be perpetually upon the Look-Out. The common Rules of Oeconomy must sometimes be leap'd over by him. Those trifling Regularities, those Hours appointed for Sleep, for Meals, for innocent Recreations; he must sometimes disre∣gard them. Order it self does sometimes require that a Man should keep no Order. We see it in <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> When his Country lay desolate and exposed, he was indefatigable in his Endeavours for its Welfare. The Drought consum'd him by Day, and the Cold by Night, and his Sleep de∣parted from his Eyes. He goes from <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Babylon:</HI> From
<PB N="15" REF="005706_0013_1026C8EBB984B758"/><HI>Shushan</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Shu∣shan.</HI> He passes whole Days and Nights on Horseback, ever watchful; constantly devoted to the Welfare of his Country. What a Disgrace to a Commander, and what a Mischief to his Ar∣my, when an Enemy enter their Trenches, or invade their Camp, while they are buried in Sleep and Wine.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man of steady <HI>Courage.</HI> When he appears in the Character of the General of an Army, or in the Character of a Messenger of God, he gives remarkable Proofs of his Resolution and Valour. The first Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> witnesses of him, that he was mighty in Words and in Deeds, that is to say, He was a fine Speaker, and a gal∣lant Soldier, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.22. Never did a Mortal shew firmer Courage than <HI>Moses</HI> in all the Mes∣sages which he delivered to that proud, haughty, cruel Monarch, who filled the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Throne in his Day. And as for his Courage in War, if we may believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> Historian, he com∣manded an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Army against the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> play'd the Man in the Field, defeated the Enemy, and obtain'd a glorious Conquest over them. Such an one also was <HI>David,</HI> who in the Day of Battle never fear'd the Face of a Foe; and who in the Court practic'd the heroic Resolution which he took when he ascended the Throne, as record∣ed, Psal. 101.5, 6. <HI>Whoso privily slandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off: Him that hath an high Look and a proud Heart will I not suffer. Mine Eyes shall be upon the Faithful of the Land,
<PB N="16" REF="005706_0014_1026C8F0097CA278"/>that he may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, he shall serve me.</HI> Vain is Prudence, vain is Watchfulness, where Courage is wanting. By an undaunted Courage it was, that ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> compos'd of three Thousand Inhabitants in the Beginning, push'd their Conquests to the Extremities of the known World, in less than six hundred Years. And shall the Disciples of the Son of God, for whom he has merited eternal Honours in Heaven; shall they flinch, when Cannon roar, and Bullets fly? God forbid.</P>
<P N="7">7. Finally, <HI>Moses</HI> was a Man of perfect <HI>Disin∣terestedness.</HI> His noble Soul scorn'd the trifling Pleasures, Wealth and Dignities which base World∣lings breathe after and pursue incessantly. <HI>Moses</HI> is the renowned Patriot concerning whom the Apostle witnesses, in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.24, 25, 26. that <HI>when he was come to Years, he refused to be called the Son of</HI> Pharaoh'<HI>s Daughter; chusing rather to suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season; esteeming the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than the Treasures in</HI> Egypt. Nay, so open, so generous, so great was his Disposition of Mind, that when the divine Being made him that Offer, <HI>I will make of Thee a great Nation, if thou wilt let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot against</HI> Israel, <HI>and that I may consume them;</HI>—when God try'd him with this Offer, he passes it over in Silence; but generously adds, <HI>Remember</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Israel <HI>thy Servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own Self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply
<PB N="17" REF="005706_0015_1026C8F42873F118"/>your Seed as the Stars of Heaven; and all this Land that I have spoken of, will I give unto your Seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</HI> 'Tis im∣possible that a covetous, greedy Man should be a great Man. A Man that has not a generous Soul, never can fill up any of the Relations of Life in a becoming Manner. What think you of a covetous Father, that is afraid to spend his Cash in the Education of his Children? What think you of a covetous Son, that won't relieve his a∣ged Parents in their decrepid Years? What think you of a covetous Merchant, that will squeeze even to Cheating? What think you of a covetous Soldier, that can't be content with his Wages? And what think you of a covetous Officer, that will sacrifice his Men of fill his own Pockets? A good Commonwealth's Man must have an open Soul. One Step by which the <HI>Persians</HI> of Old rose to that Degree of Splendor so renowned in History, was their Generosity; that Virtue which always inclined them to shew Favour to their conquer'd Enemies, and to leave them all the Marks of their ancient Grandeur. We now pass to the IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>Let us bless God who raises up so many worthy Patriots in this our <HI>New-English Israel,</HI> after ha∣ving instructed us in the Road to true Glory. Our Praises are due to the divine Being, who gives us more Light to know, and Strength to practice the Virtues which constitute real Greatness, than ever he granted to the ancient Monarchies
<PB N="18" REF="005706_0016_1026C8F5AC035968"/>of the heathen World. Their Knowledge of them was but superficial, mixt, confused; and as they err'd in Religion, they necessarily err'd in Politicks, many a Time. But thanks to the God of all our Mercies, he has plac'd at the Head of our Councils the most perfect Lawgiver that ever held the Reins of Government, even Jesus, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords. This divine Legislator has carried the Ideas of every Virtue to the highest Pitch: That Generosity to∣wards Enemies, that Contempt of Life, that Ve∣neration for noble Exploits, that Scorn of false Honour, that Devotedness to the publick Service, and those other Virtues which render Antiquity venerable. These Virtues we are as well ac∣quainted with as any People on Earth; and, God be praised, we have seen our Land full of Men, who nobly dared to practice them, in the late Times of Danger and Distress. How forward have our gallant Country-Men been to serve the Publick! How prodigal of their Lives for the Interests of the Commonwealth! Not many Months are past, since we humbled our selves be∣fore the Lord, lay low at his Footstool for our Crimes, and with utmost Earnestness of Soul, begged his Favour and Protection. Kind Hea∣ven lent a favourable Ear to the Requests of his People, and has crowned their Fleet and Army with Victory and Success. The Great and the Good, the Steady and the Brave, influenc'd by the God from whom descends every good and perfect Gift, leaped upon the Shore of their Ene∣mies, drove them before them, and went on per∣forming
<PB N="19" REF="005706_0017_102692B574B2D070"/>Wonders from Day to Day, 'till they obtained all that generous Englishmen could de∣sire. Wherefore, let us go on to practice the no∣ble Virtues of the christian Religion. Then will our Happiness be as compleat, as an earthly Hap∣piness may justly be expected. The great Jeho∣vah has already manifested the Truth of this; he has proved it to a Demonstration. The Demon∣stration is, the Walls of <HI>Louisbourg.</HI> 'Tis true, our Victory is a mingled Victory. In one Part of this Land we view an aged Father mourning over a valiant Son, slain in the Field of Battle: In ano∣ther Part, we view a tender Consort, bewailing the Loss of a gallant Husband, that breath'd his Soul into the Arms of Angels in a Trench.— They died bravely.—But, ah me, a mingled Vic∣tory proves a mingled Righteousness. Yet after all, the Victory is our's, the Conquest is our's: And, to you, our generous Hearers, we give Joy in the Reduction of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> while to God a∣lone belongs the Praise. To him is the Glory due, who led us on from Step to Step, 'till he crowned our brave Troops with Laurels superior to those of an <HI>Alexander</HI> or a <HI>Caesar.</HI> To him is the Glory due, who wafted them in Safety over the boisterous Seas. To him is the Glory due, who animated them with a Courage astonishing to the Beholder, and incredible to the Hearer. To him is the Glory due, who safeguarded them from Harms, when every Ear was deafned with the Noise of Cannon, and every Eye intent on Bombs blazing in the Air. To him is the Glory due, who led them victorious into the almost impreg∣nable
<PB N="20" REF="005706_0018_1026C8FCC4C5C958"/>Fortress of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and has there lodg'd them safe from all Annoyance. Let then every <HI>British</HI> Heart rejoice in God our Saviour, and give thanks at the Remembrance of his miraculous Goodness. But, is it only the Calves of our Lips that we are to offer to our kind Benefactor? Shall we think it sufficient, that our Tongue proclaim his Bounty? No, there is the Tribute of an holy Life due unto him; a Life devoted to his Honour; a Life spent in a studious Conformity to his holy Will, and in the Promotion of his Kingdom a∣mong Mankind. If such a Life be not hencefor∣ward found with us, the Walls of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> shall testify against us, and proclaim our Ingratitude to all the Earth; Ingratitude, the basest of Vices, the blackest of Crimes. Every Stone shall have a Voice, and cry aloud, saying, Did not the God hearing Prayer, lend a gracious Ear to all your Requests, and grant the Petitions which you were conscious included nothing less than Miracles? And do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish Peo∣ple and unwise? Well then, from this Day, Righteousness shall be practis'd by us, manly Vir∣tue shall adorn our Conversation, and every one merit the Character of a steady Patriot and a chris∣tian Hero. Thus shall we go on cheerful in the Road which leads to the unfading Honours and the immortal Glories of the heavenly World; into which God grant us e'er long an open Admission, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, to whom be ascribed the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, henceforth and forevermore, <HI>Amen</HI> and</P>
