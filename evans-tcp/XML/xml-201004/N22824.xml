<P>A TRUE AND MINUTE ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>DESTRUCTION</HI> OF THE BASTILLE, WITH CURIOUS AND ENTERTAINING ANECDOTES OF THAT FORTRESS.</P>

<HEAD>AN <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> OF AN IMPRISONMENT IN THE BASTILLE, FOR UPWARDS OF TWENTY YEARS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER an imprisonment of more than twen∣ty years, during which time I was whol∣ly precluded the use of pen, paper, books, and even the possibility of hearing the articulation of a single human voice, the reader will not, I hope, expect any very elegant detail of my mis∣fortunes. My object is truth; my secondary ob∣ject I mean, for such, in truth, I ought to call it, my first object being to procure myself a mor∣sel of bread, and which I hope to be able to procure from the publication of my dreadful and almost unparalleled misfortunes:</P>
<P>One would indeed imagine, that, during so long a state of total seclusion from the world, the natural and unavoidable consequence must have been, an intire loss of the use of language, reading, and writing: neither of these, howev∣er,
<PB N="4" REF="030151_0003_0FE4AE1D8DAB1988"/>
in any great degree failed me. In the more fortunate, or rather in the more early part of my life (for I never recollect fortune to have been over and above kind to me) my education had been good, and my application, by no means, inconsiderable: And during the whole of my infamous imprisonment, as soon at least, as I had tolerably well got over the first shock of my unhappy situation, I continued to converse by myself, and very frequently to practice writing, or rather the formation of letters, upon the wall of my cell.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to give the melancholy ac∣count of my being conducted to Prison, it will not be improper to inform the reader of the cause of my being sent there: although, in fact, no cause was assigned—but I was accused—and, in France, to be accused is to be guilty.</P>
<P>I was in London when the contest subsisted between Mr. Wilkes, or rather between the Public, and the then Ministers of State, con∣cerning the abolition of General Warrants. And as I came over to England wholly for pleasure, and as London was at that time a scene of riot and confusion, in which my interference would have beeen useless and impertinent, I re∣turned to France after a few weeks, with a full resolution to visit that glorious city, when I should be able to pass my time there more to my satisfaction.</P>
<P>Shortly after my return to France, I went to spend a few days with a friend in the neighbour∣hood of Paris, who, amongst other servants had
<PB REF="030151_0004_0FE4AE20096D2988"/>
an English Groom who waited upon us at his table. This Groom, having been four years and upwards in France, was as capable of un∣derstanding, and also of speaking the French language, as a native. Amongst other topics the conversation of course turned upon my late excursion to England, and the effort the nation was then making to abolish <HI>General Warrants,</HI> which I described to the company, as nearly analogous to <HI>Lettres de Cachet.</HI></P>
<P>Being, as I thought, amongst friends, the con∣versation was free and without restraint, and I believe some very severe strictures were impru∣dently made by me, in particular, on Lettres de Cachet. And here the matter probably would have ended, had not the English Groom entered upon a fresh discussion of it in the servants hall. In short, from words they came to blows, and the interference of the master and his company became necessary: the Valet, who, as he said, had received a blow from the Groom, had drawn out his knife, and had, beyond a doubt put an end to his adversary's existence, had I not very fortunately secured his arm: whereupon turning, in an instant, from extreme rage, to extreme coolness, he let fall the knife, and muttered to himself with a very soft and low voice <Q>Well, I may perhaps find a better weapon for my purpose elsewhere.</Q> Firing at this, the Groom imprudently uttered much harsh lan∣guage and several execrations against the Police: however, by the authority of my friend, and by the pesuasion of myself and the rest of the com∣pany, the Valet seemed to be tolerably pacified; in consequence of which he was prevailed upon
<PB N="6" REF="030151_0005_0FE4AE2893F081E8"/>
to shake hands with the Groom. I shall never forget the frankness and openness with which the Groom shook him by the hand, nor the ma∣licious significant look of the Valet.</P>
<P>The reconciliation on the part of the Valet was external only; the Groom I believe gener∣ously declared his real sentiments.</P>
<P>The next morning the Valet asked his Mast∣er's permission to go to his father at Paris, who, he said was dying: should he find him better, he would return by one o'clock, but should he find him worse, or dead, he hoped to be permitted to make a longer stay. As he was not returned by ten o'clock at night; we were observing that his father was probably worse or dead. But, alas, no sooner had the observation been made, than the villain arrived with an officer of the Police and a large party of soldiers. Not a single word was spoken: I never remember a more dreadful silence! the Valet put the right hand of the Groom into the right hand of the Officer of Pol∣ice: nor even then was a word exchanged on either side. The party went off with their booty, the execrable Valet attending them.</P>
<P>The consternation occasioned in my friend's house, by this dreadful circumstance, may be better conceived than expressed: what had my friend to expect but to be sacrificed to the fury of an angry and malicious Valet. However, af∣ter the second night, he received a letter from the servant "desiring his arrear of wages, and assuring him at the same time that <HI>himself and his family were safe.</HI>" The words being mark∣ed,
<PB N="7" REF="030151_0006_0FE4AE2A2D87BB30"/>
were emphatical, and manifestly carried with them an implication. As I was the person who had introduced the conversation, and had also in∣terfered by taking hold on the Valet's arm, when he was going to stab the Groom; I could not but suppose that by my friend and his family being safe, that I was the devoted person. However, as after a recapitulation of the whole conversation, and of what passed during our in∣terference to part the Groom and Valet, we could not fix upon any thing whereby I could possibly have given any particular offence to the Valet, I suffered myself to be tolerably well paci∣fied. I staid with my friend six nights after the Groom had been arrested, and then returned home, about three leagues from Paris, where I did not arrive 'till it was dark.</P>
<P>On knocking at my door, it was opened to me as usual by my servant: to whom I said, "Well Jacques, is all the family well?" the servant gave me no answer: it is impossible for any one to conceive the horror that came over me: however, I walked into the room, where I saw the usual preparations made for supper, and where were sitting my wife and daughter, a girl of nine years of age, bathed in tears, unable, and afraid to speak a single word. Whilst I was en∣deavouring to unravel this mystery, I was salu∣ted by a touch on the shoulder from the Valet of my friend, and the same officer of Police that had taken up the Groom at my friend's house, a few nights before; but the guard of soldiers was much stronger.</P>
<P>Behold reader, a wretched man for no crime
<PB N="8" REF="030151_0007_0FE4AE2BB5811520"/>
whatever reduced from the summit of happiness, to the depth of misery: his estate confiscated, his family reduced to beggary, himself shut up for life, and that perhaps unfortunately a long life, in an unwholesome dungeon.</P>
<P>Cursed be that government, which founded on iniquity, and in consequence thereof, view∣ing every thing with a coward and suspicious eye, devotes with unfeeling indifferance the probable and positive offender. But doubly cur∣sed be that government, which, not content with pretext of establishing it's security on the misery of it's subjects, meanly calls in avarice to it's aid, in order to strip the innocent relations of the accused, of their undoubted right, their daily bread.</P>
<P>I have just learnt however, that my unfortu∣nate family did not long survive so hard a fate: my poor wife, (for tho' she has been dead many years, has to me been dead scarcely so many days, I having heard of her death but since my escape from the Bastile) died within ten days af∣ter my commitment, raving mad, and starved to death: for it would have been death, instant death, to any person whatever to have relieved her. My poor infant daughter was to have been consigned over to a harder fate, but heaven for∣bad it: on the representation of the officer of the Police to the Marquis de —, a notorious and famous catamite of the court of Lewis the Fifteenth; she was by him sent for, and orders were given for her being elegantly brought up, 'till she was of proper age to become subservient to his abominable purposes. But, heaven be
<PB N="9" REF="030151_0008_0FE4AE2D41D67D50"/>
praised, she paid the debt of nature, as I am just informed within six months after she had fallen into the Marquis de —'s hands.</P>
<P>Form to yourself, reader, the idea of a govern∣ment, under which the subject offers up thanks to Almighty God for depriving him of his dear∣est connections, his wife and family, and think himself happy in the loss of them! Such was France.</P>
<P>More than twenty years ago I was forever parted from my wife and only child, and con∣ducted, or rather dragged, in a wretched close cart, from my own house to the Bastile, under a guard of near one hundred soldiers: every room in my house was filled with armed men, except that in which were sitting my wife and daughter. The salute given me on the shoulder by the valet and officer of the Police was the signal for their coming out. The Intendant of the Police had given strict orders that none of my family should be permitted to speak, or to leave the house on pain of death, a threat which would undoubted∣ly have been instantly put in execution.</P>
<P>My two maid servants, who, on my arrival were ordered into a private room, had been treated by the soldiers in a manner too shocking, and too indecent to be committed to paper. These wretched executors of, what they call, justice, had been waiting two nights in my house expecting my arrival: and the reason why I was not apprehended at my friend's house, I am told, was, that the valet laid his information against me on the Intendant of Police giving his
<PB N="10" REF="030151_0009_0FE4AE3607D62638"/>
word and honour that I should not be taken dur∣ing my visit there. One of my maid servants died in a few days, in consequence of the brutal treatment she had received from these officers of <HI>Justice,</HI> of the footman, and other unhappy fe∣male servant, no account, I am told, could ever be given: it would have been certain death to have asked a single question about them.</P>
<P>As soon as I arrived at the Bastile, at a signal given, which I never could discover, but which I rather think was made by dropping the Lettre de Cachet through a niche, I was received by an officer of the Bastile, whose feelings seemed to be as brutal as the odious Police of which he was an executioner. The Lettre de Cachet, which, as he had it in his hand, he must, as I said before, have received through a niche, was, together with me, delivered to the Governor of the Bastile, as great a brute in disposition, but of more ex∣ternal polish, than the former. This murderer, for no less can I call him, did not do me the same honour, which, on peril of his life, he was obliged to do the Lettre de Cachet; for that he was compelled to receive with his own hands, but me he made over to the Deputy Governor, by whom I was consigned to the common Turn∣key, who pushed me in the dark into my cell. This Deputy Governor was much such a fellow as a good painter would have made of the Police of France had he personified it: that is, the meanness and cruelty of popery triumphing over an innocent and helpless individual. A religion made up of gloss, hypocrisy, and priest-craft: pretending to pardon offences committed against Omnipotence, and actually torturing for a re∣mark
<PB N="11" REF="030151_0010_0FE4AE3791D56A18"/>
made on the vile prostitute of a profligate monarch: forgiving, for a pitiful pittance, crimes against nature and against humanity: de∣barring the Almighty of the adoration due to him as God Supreme, and conferring it upon Saints, many of them as profligate and obscure as their adorers.</P>
<P>About seven o'clock in the morning on the next day, a nasty, squalid, cadaverous, figure, who, any where, but in France, would have been taken for the figure of Famine, brought me a blanket, some clean straw, a quart of stink∣ing water, and about four ounces of most execra∣ble bread. As my appetite was not very good, the bread, as may be supposed, remained un∣touched. The water I seized with the greatest avidity, and filthy as it was, drank it off at one draught. At two in the afternoon, the same quantity of bread and water was again brought me by the same meagre figure, who, observing that the bread which he had brought me in the morning, remained untouched, took back with him what he then brought me. At eight o'clock in the evening he came again, bringing the same quantity of bread and water; but observing, as at two o'clock, that the bread he had brought me remained untouched, he again took, what he brought at eight o'clock, away with him.</P>
<P>I am sorry to say that I had formed the dreadful resolution of starving myself to death: a resolu∣tion which my <HI>generous</HI> keepers seemed themselves ready to meet me at least half way in. This however, even with their powerful assistance, I was unable to put into execution. Had I been
<PB N="12" REF="030151_0011_0FE4AE391A128F80"/>
furnished with any possible means of putting my∣self to death by an act of sudden violence, I un∣doubtedly should have done it. Such means, however, were effectually denied me. For, previous to my being pushed into this miserable apartment, I was stripped of my shirt, neck-cloth, garters, stockings, handkerchief, shoe, and knee buckles: in lieu of which I was pre∣sented with a flannel shirt, and a pair of wretch∣ed flannel stockings: such was my dress, and by no means too often renewed, during my whole imprisonment: such too, as above set forth, was my food.</P>
<P>The chamber, if it deserves that name, in which I was confined, was up one pair of stairs. The only furniture of which was an earthen pot, and a stone of about half a ton weight which served me for a seat; the room was about twelve feet high, and about a foot from the cieling was a window about fourteen inches square, but so barricadoed with iron bars, that it would have been utterly impossible even for a sparrow to have passed between them. In consequence of the breadth of the room from the wall to the window, which was scarcely five feet, I had no possible chance of seeing even the sky; more than that I could not expect to see through the scanty crevi∣ses of the iron bars: to have reached the window would have been utterly impossible, and as it could have answered no possible end whatever, but to have created a zealousy in my brutal keep∣ers, so did I never once think of attempting it. The length of the room was about eighteen feet: the gloominess, and melancholy of it dreadful to a degree: dreadful from the sad reflection of
<PB N="13" REF="030151_0012_0FE4AE3B94E10438"/>
it having been the tomb of many a living corpse, devoted like me to the zealousy of a cruel and ty∣rannical government, and more dreadful to me as being the then unhappy possessor of it.</P>
<P>The cieling of this accursed appartment con∣sisted of iron bars, nearly as thick as my wrist, and within a quarter of an inch of each other cross wise. This, for the two or three first months of my imprisonment, I own appeared unaccountable to me, as the floor was of deal.</P>
<P>What will not the love of liberty do? and with what improbable and even impossible hopes will it not furnish us? from this consideration, namely of the floor being composed of deal, I flattered myself that one day or other I might be able to effect my escape: and my hope of doing it was the rather flattered, as I had observed that one of the boards was loose, nearly the whole length of the cell: and I had taken it up, not from any idea of then putting my project into execution, but of getting the thing as it were in train: in a moment I heard the turnkey at the door, and though it took him some time to open it, yet was I, unable, from surprize, to replace the board, or even to lay it out of my hands, so great was my consternation.</P>
<P>The turnkey, on seeing my awkward situation, immediately locked the door again, and in less than five minutes returned with four men whom I had never before seen, bringing with them a lanthorn. He was locked with me into my cell, and setting his lanthorn upon the stone, which I before said was in my cell, very deliberately took
<PB N="14" REF="030151_0013_0FE4AE41662EFE70"/>
up almost every board before my face, and shew∣ed me, what, 'till then, I never could have sus∣pected to have been the case, a floor consisting of iron plates at least half an inch thick: having replaced the boards, he gave a rap at the door, in consequence of which it was immediately opened, and he took his leave of me, with the most contemptuous sneer in his countenance that insolence could suggest: here ended my hopes of an escape. I was not however, as I expected, put in irons, but was treated by my keeper with excessive contempt, and silent allusions to my project of forming an escape. During the whole of the ceremony of the turnkey removing the boards, not a syllable passed between us: as he had positive orders no doubt never to utter a syl∣lable, so I, through fear of ill-treatment, and, at the same time, considering it as useless, never once opened my lips.</P>
<P>I must confess that on my first commitment to that prison, the disgrace of a christian country, and the horror of France, I expected every day, or rather every hour, to be put to the torture: this however was not the case: my body was no farther put to the rack, than as it partook of the, sufferings of my mind: let the humane reader form to himself the idea of being, to a certainty, confined during life, in such a chamber as I have described, debarred of bodily exercise, of the lib∣erty of breathing a free or wholesome air, of the enjoyment of such amusements as the mind of a rational being, tired of idleness and inactivity naturally has recourse to, and from which it as naturally finds relief, let him form to himself, I say this id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and let him refrain, if possible,
<PB N="15" REF="030151_0014_0FE4AE43EBD004C8"/>
from the most sensible emotions, in behalf of the unfortunate prisoners. A reflection this, that must operate powerfully upon the feelings of any one but of an intendant of French Police, or of his base and infamous, but now degraded, employers.</P>
<P>To the horror of the above scene, may be ad∣ded the terrible apprehension the prisoner is hourly under, of being put to the torture: of this, no notice whatever is given him: he lit∣terally has no assurance whatever of not being taken out of his sleep and torn to pieces by the cruelty of the officers of the prison.</P>
<P>The last human being to whom I spoke for more than twenty years, to the day of my re∣lease (I relate it with pity to myself, and with shame for my country) were my unfortunate wife and daughter: and from these, the friends of my bosom, I was not suffered to receive any answer.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour to be as concise as possible, in the account of my imprisonment, not wishing myself to reflect upon a subject, on which I can∣not reflect, but with the greatest horror and which having no variety in itself, cannot but be very unentertaining to the reader.</P>
<P>Suffice it therefore to say: that I was kept in the same room continually: and never once, during so many years imprisonment was suffered to pass o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the threshold: my whole and only food was bread and water, both bad, and very bad, in it's kind. I never spoke to, or was ever
<PB N="16" REF="030151_0015_0FE4AE457615EAB0"/>
once spoken to, by any human creature whatever. The only variety that I ever experienced, was in respect of heat and cold, and for this I was indebted to the seasons.</P>
<P>During the five or six last winters, the cold was most dreadfully punishing: I made a sign to the Turnkey to have an additional blanket, and stockings, but of this he took not the least notice. In summer the air was foetid, and suf∣focating, and frequently to such a degree, that the very Turnkey himself who was a walking dunghill, was utterly unable to face the noisome effluvia on opening the door of my cell. Such, reader, was the variety I speak of, but I shall pass on to that glorious day in which I recovered my liberty.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the morning I heard, what I had never before heard during my whole infamous imprisonment, a variety of voices un∣der my window, and presently, the cry of "to arms." As I concluded that it was nothing more than some poor helpless individual who either had, or who was then attempting to make his escape, after wishing him every possible suc∣cess, and having called down every possible curse on the Police of France, I again fell asleep. The noise however did not end here: I then concluded that some of the prisoners had actual∣ly risen against their keepers, and on hearing the firing of a musquet was more than ever confir∣med in my opinion, that this must have been the case. But as I well knew that, even had it been the case, the contest must terminate in favour of the officers of the Bastile, I again laid myself down indifferent about the consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030151_0016_0FE4AE47F3880FF8"/>In less than an hour I heard a much greater uproar, and a shout of <HI>"Vive la liberte,"</HI> Lib∣erty for ever. This exclamation thought I, can never proceed from the mouths of the officers of the Bastile. Nor, indeed, did it: but from the mouths of those forty brave insurgents who were but a small part of the assertors of the glo∣rious emancipation of France.</P>
<P>These unfortunate persons were admitted within the walls of the Bastile, on pretext of making terms of surrender between the Gover∣nor and the populace. But, such was the faith of a French government, scarcely were they en∣tered within the walls of that grave of Liberty, when they were set upon by a well armed, though not numerous, Military, which is al∣ways kept in the Bastile, and instantly, contra∣ry to the most solemn promise on part of the of∣ficers of the Bastile, put to death by fire and sword. Dreadful Triumph! and succeeded by a shout very different from that of <HI>"Vive la lib∣erte"</HI> that of <HI>"Vive la Police"</HI> or slavery for ever.</P>
<P>It will not be here improper to observe, that the Military, and every officer of the Bastile, except the Governor, is, in fact, as much a prisoner, as any prisoner there, except that he has the whole range of the premises of the prison to walk in. When he enters upon his office he takes it for life, and he would instantly be put to the torture, and then to death, were he to be seen, or even to express a wish to be without the walls of the prison: nor can the Governor him∣self be absent more than ten nights together, and
<PB N="18" REF="030151_0017_0FE4AE4F51E75BD8"/>
that only by permission of the King, and with his sign manuel. A plain proof this, that the Police is thoroughly ashamed of the cruelty and injustice which it is continually guilty of.</P>
<P>But to proceed:</P>
<P>I now heard silence demanded, and procla∣mation made (by order of the Governor as I was afterwards informed) to quarter the bodies of the unfortunate persons, who had so nobly on their part, and so disgracefully on the part of the Governor and officers or the Bastile, lost their lives in defence of liberty; and to throw their limbs over the battlements to the terror of their companions, in order to shew them what they were to expect, as a chastisement of their rebellion, if they did not immediately disperse.</P>
<P>This however was not put in execution: the barbarians contented themselves with hanging the dead bodies on the palisadoes, and exposing them in a manner the most brutal and ignomini∣ous, and in such a manner as would have dis∣graced an inquisition, or any thing but a French Police.</P>
<P>By this act of brutality, the number of the in∣surgents, and their fury, was increased at least fifty fold. And matters were now come to such a pitch, that nothing but a surrender could pos∣sibly save the lives of the persons in the Bastile. This being evident to the Governor, he called all the officers of the prison together, and pro∣posed (for I heard him with my own ears) to put every prisoner to death, and to bury their bodies,
<PB N="19" REF="030151_0018_0FE4AE50DB62D188"/>
in order that nothing relative to that place of confinement, might transpire.</P>
<P>Reader, if thou hast any feeling for my unhap∣py situation, exert it for me here: if thou hast one tear, drop it for me here. My very heart bleeds at the bare recollection of the dreadful proposal.</P>
<P>During this conversation amongst the officers of the Bastile, the Governor was summoned to the wall to know whether he would surrender. He would surrender, he said, if they would swear to him to spare his life, This however was even so far from being promised to him, that he was, in the most positive and solemn manner assured, that, in consequence of his cruelty and breach of saith towards their companions, he should infallibly be put to death within three hours after his surrender: that if he deferred his surrender ten minutes, he should be put to the most exquisite torture. This, however, was so far from prevailing upon him to set open the gates, that he absolutely refused to give up the prison, and came down from the battlements.</P>
<P>Upon this, the fellow who had the manage∣ment of the draw-bridge, and who also had the keys of the gate of the prison, and who (as I af∣terwards learnt) was more than fifty yards from the Governor, hearing this resolution of the Governor, let fall as if by accident, the draw∣bridge, and offered immediately to open the gate on condition that they would spare his life.</P>
<P>This proposal was made and executed in half
<PB N="20" REF="030151_0019_0FE4AE5263B92FF8"/>
a minute, and the insurgents were put in com∣plete possession of the prison. The military within the Bastile were summoned to lay down their arms, which demand they immediately complied with. The greatest silence and order was observed. The Governor was called for, and ordered to go down upon his knees, and to answer aloud to every question.</P>

<P>Many of these poor wretches were so emacia∣ted as to be unable to stand: some of them came forth frantic with joy; others, from the sense of their dreadful sufferings, and of what they had, in all probability, yet to suffer for many a tedious year, had lapsed into a state of idiotcy; and one poor man, in particular, was obliged to be lifted out, being unable to stand upon his legs, in consequence of having had his knees and ancle bones dislocated by the torture. This unfortunate prisoner had been there upwards of seven years, and had been tortured once every year.</P>
<P>As many of the prisoners as were capable of bearing arms had the arms and cloaths of such soldiers as were in the Bastile given to them; and, in return, the soldiers themselves were cloathed in the rags of the prisoners, and in that condition turned out of the prison gates.</P>

<P>After a few minutes, a wretched and misera∣ble figure came forward, and said that <Q>he was the person, but that he had opened the gates on positive promise of having his life spared, and therefore humbly hoped for mercy.</Q> The gentleman who had, as I said before, examined the Governor, taking him by the hand, said, <Q>I hope, friend you have nothing to fear;</Q> <Q>My countrymen, this man has, in all proba∣bility, saved the effusion of much blood, by putting us in quiet possession of this prison; it is to him we owe this safe and easy conquest.

<P>The gentleman came back in about a quarter of an hour, and said briefly, that he had been eye-witness to a scene too shocking to be looked upon: he then ordered the implements of tor∣ture to be brought out, and to be destroyed by the officers of the Bastile themselves. After which the Governor was ordered to prepare to die within one hour, and was accordingly per∣mitted to be closseted with the Confessor of the
<PB N="24" REF="030151_0023_0FE3F814DF537478"/>
Bastile. At the expiration of the hour he was brought out, and hanged over the battlements in the sight of, at least, a hundred thousand populace, of whom the Giant of this Enchanted Castle had long been the terror and dread.</P>
<P>The shout was universal: it ascended to God's throne an offering of a sweet smelling savour. A most grateful offering to the Father of Justice and Mercy!</P>
<P>And now (having seen by glorious experiment that the Lord of this castle of terror was vulnera∣ble) it was determined to try whether the walls of the prison were not as liable to mortality. In three days the whole prison was razed to the ground. What became of the other officers of the Bastile it is difficult to say; some of them, on being turned out of the prison gates, were instantly torn to pieces by the populace, not, however, before they had been made to take down the bodies of the men, who had, under truce, entered the prison, and whose bodies, after they had been most shamefully murdered, had been hung on the palisadoes, and buried them in the most respectful manner.</P>
<P>Having given a very faithful and accurate ac∣count of the taking possession of this fortress, (if such I may call it) which, 'till this day, was thought impregnable, I shall proceed to set be∣fore the reader, the manner in which the des∣truction of it was carried on.</P>
<P>First of all Proclamation was made precisely in the following words.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="030151_0024_0FE4AE5EEC0E1380"/><Q>In the name of Almighty God, the Father of Mercies, in the name of Jesus Christ his Son, and in the name of the Holy Spirit, be perfect Love and Liberty to this and every Nation under Heaven for evermore: Amen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whereas this odious prison called the Bas∣tile has, in particular, for many years, existed the terror and disgrace of Religion and Lib∣erty, the disgrace of former reigns, and of the faithful and good subjects of his present most Christian Majesty Lewis the Sixteenth, and of his most Christian Queen, whom God preserve; we, the Nation, do hereby condemn to utter annihilation, and perdition, the said odious prison, as being highly disgraceful to us as men, and to our country as christians, and highly reflecting upon our allegiance to our most Christian King: determining here∣by to banish tyranny and oppression, the influ∣ence of wicked Ministers, and the damnable power of the Church of Rome, Amen.</Q></P>
<P>No sooner was the proclamation made, than the demolition of the building was begun, and in the most workman-like and methodical man∣ner. The lead of the roof was first of all strip∣ped off and thrown down upon the ground, and was then, as were all the other parts of the Bas∣tile, as fast as they were pulled down, thrown into the ditch which surrounded it.</P>
<P>As soon as the lead was stripped off, there ap∣peared a roof of iron plates half an inch thick, screw'd down to iron bars of four inches diame∣ter. So that it would have been utterly impos∣sible
<PB N="26" REF="030151_0025_0FE4AE60754CF560"/>
for any prisoner whatever to have got through the roof. This, indeed, the screws being put in from without side would have prevented, as would also the height of the rooms: those of the upper story being three or four feet higher than those on the lower stories: when these iron plates, and the bars to which they were screw'd, were removed, an arched roof of stone presented itself, built in the form of an oven: under this arch, which was much more difficult to be brok∣en through than the iron roof, it was presumed that the cells would appear; but this was by no means the case; there was yet another ceiling of large iron bars laid cross-wise, screwed togeth∣er very forcibly, and under that a ceiling of boards. In each of the upper cells was a set of iron rings and chains fastened to the floor, to which a prisoner was to be chained in case he at∣tempted an escape.</P>
<P>The roof of the prison being completely taken off, the walls were next pulled down to the bot∣tom of the uppermost set of cells, the floors of these cells had nothing peculiar in them: their strength consisted in the iron ceiling of the cells below them: which were of plates of iron rivet∣ed, instead of screwed to very large and close laid iron bars: nor was it possible to have remo∣ved them but by taking the weight of the side walls off the ends of them: by this method the matter was effected with tolerable case. And now, night coming on, it was agreed to suspend the work by common consent. And every key belonging to the Bastile, together with the outer gates of it having been buried in the ditch, un∣der some thousand loads of rubbish, and the cells
<PB N="27" REF="030151_0026_0FE4AE688A745888"/>
being open, as many as could get lodging in the prison did so; many returned home 'till the morning, and many thousands remained abroad the whole night: for my own part, I took up with my old apartment, though with this differ∣ence, that instead of solitude I had company enough, and instead of spending the night as a miserable captive, I spent it with as much plea∣sure, or I hope with more, than if I had been Governor of the Bastile.</P>
<P>The next morning, by break of day, the de∣molition of the prison proceeded as regularly and in as spirited a manner as on the day before: and although the wall was much thicker, the nearer we came to the ground, yet was it lower∣ed with considerable more ease than nearer the top of the building, on account of there being less lead and iron work amongst the stones.</P>
<P>Every hour, or less, fresh persons were em∣ployed, as well to throw down the wall, as also to remove the materials into the ditch: and so great was the number of people, and such their eagerness to supply the places of those who had been at work, that had the prison been ten times as large, it would have been taken down in as short a time: during the whole of this, as also on the preceding day, there was no cessation of labour whatever, and by the time that it was too dark to carry on the work on the second even∣ing, the prison was taken down to the surface of the earth. Whilst one part of the populace was at work on the Bastile and Governor's house another part was at work on the wall that sur∣rounded the prison, which was thrown into the
<PB N="28" REF="030151_0027_0FE4AE6A1340F480"/>
ditch by the first night. The draw-bridge also was thrown into the ditch and buried under the rubbish.</P>
<P>When it was dark, the people retired as on the former night, and the most strict order and decorum were observed.</P>
<P>It must doubtless appear surprising that it never once occurred to any person present to ex∣amine the apartments under ground: nor, 'till the prison was pulled down to the surface, were these subterraneous cells I believe once thought of:</P>
<P>As the doors of these chambers of death, if I may so call them, had not been opened, and as the keys of them, as well as every key belonging to the Bastile had, as has been said, been buried under some thousand loads of rubbish, it was now impossible to open them. Nothing remain∣ed therefore but to come at them by taking off their ceilings. It was suspected that there might be many unfortunate prisoners confined in these noisome and dreadful abodes, which, was it the case they must be at least forty eight hours with∣out victuals or drink before they could be reliev∣ed. In consequence of these reflexions, to per∣sons eagerly wishing to restore their fellow crea∣tures to the joyful face of day, and to the common rights of humanity, and sensible at the same time what they must then suffer from hun∣ger and thirst, and still had to suffer before they could possibly be relieved, the approach of the morning, was expected, not only with the ut∣most, but even with the most painful impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030151_0028_0FE4AE6B9AC856A8"/>By nine o'clock in the morning of the third day, the ceilings over these subterraneous cells, which were precisely the same with those of the sett of cells above them, were intirely removed: and in these cells, to our infinite satisfaction, and utter astonishment, not a single prisoner was found.</P>
<P>These cells were in all respects like those above them, except that they had no window in them: instead of which there was a little wretched light let in through the doors: and in order to prevent any unhappy person who might be the tenant of them, from a possibility of seeing any thing, a hole was cut in the left hand side of the door next the cell, and in the right hand side of the outermost door.</P>
<P>Having already given a very accurate account of the windows of the cells, I now proceed to a description of the doors of them. To each cell there were three doors, all of them of prodigious strength, one of which are opened outwardly to∣ward the goaler; this door, although of wood, might with much greater propriety be said to be of iron, being studded with nails with mon∣strous heads, so as almost to met each other, and to form, within a very little, a superficies of iron: they were also covered transversely with iron bars, screwed on with the heads of the screws al∣ternately placed, one to the outside of the cell, and one to the inside of it: between every two screws was a very strong rivet of iron: this door was locked by a prodigious double lock of pecu∣liar strength and construction, and also with a padlock: this being done, a grated door wholly
<PB N="30" REF="030151_0029_0FE4AE6D2395E0E8"/>
of iron was pulled down like a sash, between this and the outermost door. The iron bars, of which this sash was composed, were solid, mea∣suring two inches on every side: it's interstices were about four inches wide. This door lock∣ed on the side into the wall in all respects like another door, and was also locked by a staple, of prodigious strength, to the ground. This grase or door being made fast, the outermost door was locked precisely in the same manner as the door next the prisoner: three no bad securities these against a poor helpless individual: nor indeed against the good wishes of such of his friends as might have any idea of conferring upon him his liberty.</P>
<P>A principal reason why the prisoners in France (I mean what are called state prisoners) are kept with so zealous an eye is, because gov∣ernment having generally imprisoned them for nothing, and in most cases having used the tor∣ture, it is ashamed and afraid to release them lest they should tell their history to the disadvan∣tage of the state. So the minister was afraid to release La Tude, lest he should write his me∣moirs: La Tude —, did write his me∣moires: and they will ever remain a disgrace to the last and present reigns of France.</P>
<P>But to proceed:</P>
<P>As soon as it was perceived that no prisoner whatever was confined in these subterraneous cells, it was determined to dig at the bottom of each of them, in order to examine whether there were any rooms under them: to be fully satis∣fied
<PB N="31" REF="030151_0030_0FE4AE7551CEC2F8"/>
of this, four feet depth of earth was taken out of each cell: but no signs of other rooms ap∣pearing, the great stones, which composed the foundation of the prison, and which made also the side walls of these subterraneous cells, were thrown down into the holes, from which the four foot of earth had been taken, and the earth, which had been dug out, served to cover the place where the infamous Bastile had so long, and so lately stood: a spot now capable of a bet∣ter harvest, hitherto fruitful only in cruelty and oppression, in the sighs and tears of the wretch∣ed prisoner and captive.</P>
<P>The reader will please to observe that I am not giving a description of the Bastile, no one can be more improper to undertake a task of that sort than a person who was carried in by night, and thrust into a miserable dark cell, in which he was kept upwards of twenty years a close pri∣soner. By the time that I was let out of my cell, the prison was so full of the populace that I could get no competent view of the premises of it, nor indeed did I ever think of doing it: whatever the premises or gardens of it were, they were destroyed, together with the buildings, be∣fore I ever thought of examining them. All I shall speak of therefore will be what came imme∣diately under my eye.</P>
<P>Besides the prison itself, there were two other buildings, both of them exceedingly low, with∣in the walls of this gloomy mansion: namely the house of the Governor and deputy Governor, both of them under the same roof; and a house for the common turnkeys. The former, as
<PB N="32" REF="030151_0031_0FE4AE76DA585E98"/>
having nothing peculiar belonging to it, need no description. Of the latter I shall say but lit∣tle. At the door of this house for the common turnkeys, there used to stand, night and day, a centinal, into whose box came a bell rope, which, when pulled, rang a bell in every room of the house at the same time, in which the common goalers lived. This was regularly rang three times a day when the goalers went to feed the unhappy prisoners: and in case of any alarm; but never else upon any occasion whatever.</P>
<P>If the goalers visited the cells, or any partic∣ular cell, at any other, than at the stated hours, it was always done (truely characterestic of a French Police) without giving this notice. No turn-key dared to visit a cell on any pretence whatever, at any other than the stated hours on pain of instant death, without an order from the Governor, or, in his absence, from the Deputy Governor, which order was always given in per∣son by word of mouth.</P>
<P>The military, I have been informed, never interfered with the prisoners, nor with the goa∣lers; nor were they allowed to associate with them, or even to converse with them. They lived in barracks built against the wall of the Bastile, which surrounded the ditch; they were under the command of the Governor, though a Sergeant was always their ostensible comman∣der.</P>
<P>The house in which the goalers lived, was circular; in one part of it was a large room in which they eat, drank, and associated, during
<PB N="33" REF="030151_0032_0FE4AE7866D208B8"/>
the day time: all around this room were other chambers in which they slept, and in which, as I before said, a bell was hung, as there was al∣so in the common room. Under this house was a very spacious vault, which we took for a chan∣nel house, but on opening it, it proved to be nothing more than a place in which they kept victuals, and it had in it several vessels of weak wine.</P>
<P>This vault received its light and air from half a dozen small windows, which were secured by a few slight iron bars; but, within it was a door, or rather three doors, made precisely like the doors of the cells in which the prisoners were kept. To break these open in any reasonable time was utterly impossible, it was therefore re∣solved upon to remove them by taking away the stone work on the side of the posts; this was, at last, effected with infinite la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and difficul∣ty: the staple to which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or sash door was fastened to the ground, gave us incredible trouble; it was however determined to open it, and opened it was.</P>
<P>The conjectures of what might be the con∣tents of this strongly fortified chamber, were numerous, and, as it afterwards proved, all of them erroneous. One conjectured that it must be a room set apart for torture; another, that it was a vault for burying the dead, or a charnel house; others, a mine, in case of assault: how∣ever, it turned out to be a very large and spacious room full of arms of different sorts, antient and modern, and had in it also some gunpowder and ball. The windows of it, which were four
<PB N="34" REF="030151_0033_0FE4AE7AE8C54950"/>
only, were very strongly fortified and glazed; they looked out through the wall that surround∣ed the Bastile, into the great ditch, and were so formed as not to be very visible on the outside. Such of the arms as were found in this room, and which were of use, were put into the hands of the insurgents: the old guns which fired with a match, were left behind, and buried in the ruins, as being wholly useless. The arch which covered this room, (for it ran from under the house in which the common goalers lived, to the outside of the wall of the Bastile) was dug through, and the room, together with the Bastile, its gates, walls, Governor's house, and, in short, the whole premises belonging to it, were razed, not only to the ground, but two feet, at least, beneath the ground: and no trace of the spot, on which it stood, left behind.</P>
<P>This being done, proclamation was made for silence: and the herald was ordered to return thanks to Almighty God, for this singular nation∣al delivery, from a tyrannical and oppressive government: and a curse was denounced against those who should rebuild, or attempt, or propose, or wish to rebuild this prison. The whole was concluded with three acclamations of "Vive le Roi," "Vive la Liberte" "Vive la Nation."</P>
<P>I cannot myself (I may perhaps be singular in my opinion) forbear thinking but that the French Court has suffered, in it's turn, for the many acts of cruelty and perfidy it has been re∣peatedly guilty of towards a part of it's subjects, which, on all occasions, has lived in the most or∣derly manner under that cruel and oppressive government. I mean the Protestants:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030151_0034_0FE4AE8098960588"/>Thus have I done, what I proposed, laid be∣fore the public in the best manner I am able, a full, clear, and accurate account of the destruc∣tion of this once infamous prison, the terror alike of the wicked and good: the Grave of Liberty, the scandal of France, the disgrace of Europe: It was my most determined resolution not to quit that odious and detestable spot so long as one stone was left standing upon another: It was my resolution I say, and I adhered to it most strenuously.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORICAL REMARKS TOGETHER WITH CURIOUS AND ENTERTAINING <HI>ANECDOTES</HI> OF THE <HI>BASTILLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Bastille, in its original form, stood at the entrance of Paris, on the side of the Fauxbourg Saint Antoine:—It then consisted but of two towers. The design of the Castle was given, and the first stone laid April 23, 1369, by Hugh Aubriot, Prevost of Paris, who had been charged with the management of the new enclosure and fortifications of that city un∣der Charles V. The two towers with which the Castle was first built served as a defence a∣gainst the attacks of the English; but there were soon afterwards added two, for the purpose of retreat, fronting to and parrallel with the first. The entrance to Paris was lengthened by two seperate towers and a double bridge. The ed∣ifice was not completed until the reign of Charles VI. about the year 1383.—That monarch ad∣ded four new towers at equal distances. He constructed apartments between the towers in the solid walls, pulled down the bridges, and
<PB N="40" REF="030151_0037_0FE4AE871EABDA38"/>
surrounded the whole eight towers by a dry ditch sunk twenty-five feet below the level of the street.</P>
<P>All the towers are secured at the bottom by strong double doors, with enormous locks and bolts. The filthy dungeons beneath exhale the most offensive stench, and are the common abodes of lizards, toads, rats, spiders, and almost eve∣ry other species of vermin.</P>
<P>It was in these dungeons that the tyrannical Lewis XI. confined those whose miserable lives he was desirous of prolonging by gradual torture; such was his treatment of the princes of Armag∣nac, who were placed in these dungeons, in holes sunk in the stone-work into the forms of sugar-loaves, terminating in points, so constructed to deprive their feet of rest, and their wearied and tortured bodies of all possibility of repose; from this miserable situation they were taken twice a week—to receive the scourge, under the inspec∣tion of Philip L'Huillier, then Governor of the Bastille; and at the end of every three months they had one or two teeth wrenched from their jaws. The elder of these princes at length went mad; but the youngest was happy enough to be delivered from this dreadful incarceration, by the death of Lewis XI. and from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, da∣ted 1483, we have obtained these facts, which could never have been credited, nor even imag∣ined, without so positive an evidence.</P>
<P>In a corner of each dungeon is placed a camp∣bed, formed by planks laid across iron bars six∣ed in the wall. It is here they put such prison∣ers as they wish to terrify into any measure, and
<PB N="41" REF="030151_0038_0FE4AE8E44DA85F0"/>
allow them nothing but a little straw for bed-fur∣niture. Double doors, each seven inches thick, and fastened by monstrous bolts, are the entran∣ces to these horrid and dark dens.</P>
<P>After the dungeons the most horrible are those containing iron cages, which are three in num∣ber. These cages are formed of beams, cased with strong plates of iron; and are eight feet high by six feet wide.</P>
<P>[It is not the intention of the Publisher to give a full account of the castle, towers, &amp;c. of the Bastille, as the limits of this small pamphlet will not allow of it, but what has been said will un∣doubtedly give the Reader an idea of that infa∣mous prison.]</P>

<P>CHARLES de Gontault, Duc de Biron, Peer, Admiral, and Marechal of France, and Governor of the Port of Brest, at a time when he was loaded with favours by Henry IV. entered into a correspondence with the Spaniards and the Duke of Savoy, at that time the profes∣sed enemies of the nation, who flattered him with hopes of obtaining at their hands the sovereignty

of the Duchy of Burgundy, and that of Fran∣che Comte, as a portion with a daughter either of the King of Spain or of the Duke of Savoy, whom they promised to give him in marriage. Henry IV. having discovered the plot, immedi∣ately taxed Biron with it, who denied the crime with unconquerable audacity. The Parliament of Paris gave orders for his trial. He was found guilty of the crime of high treason against his King and Country, and condemned to lose his head, by an Arret of the 29th July 1602; which sentence was executed on the 31st of the same month, in the interior court of the Bastille.</P>

<P>In 1674, Louis Chevalier de Rohan, Grand Veneur of France, having lost his baggage in a skirmish, on its being rifled, certain letters were found which gave ground of suspicion, that he was engaged in a traiterous design to deliver Havre∣de-Grace into the hands of the English. In consequence of this discovery he was seized and thrown into the Bastille. The Sieur de la Tuan∣derie, who was his emissary in the business, hid himself immediately on hearing the news of his principal's arrest. Sufficient proofs not being brought forward against de Rohan, a commis∣sion was created which assumed to itself the of∣fice of drawing up documents for convicting him of treason. La Tuanderie was discovered at Rouen, whither proper officers were dispatched to apprehend him; but perceiving his case to be desperate, he fired on his assailants, and was immediately killed on the spot. The friends of the Chevalier de Rohan repaired every night to
<PB N="43" REF="030151_0040_0FE4AE9154DF2B90"/>
the Bastille, which they circumambulated, cry∣ing incessantly, with the assistance of a speaking-trumpet, <Q>La Tuanderie is dead, and has con∣fessed nothing;</Q> but this was never heard by the Chevalier. The Commissioners finding that they could draw nothing from him, told him, <Q>That the King knew the whole of the fact, and was possessed of convincing proofs; that they only waited his confession; and that they had authority to promise him a pardon upon the single condition, that he should declare the truth of the matter.</Q> The too credulous Che∣valier avowed the treason; when, in an instant the perfidious wretches changed their tone, and told him, that it was true, they could not ensure his pardon, but that they had great hopes of ob∣taining it, and would go immediately to solicit it. Notwithstanding this promise, they felt no compunction in pronouncing, soon after, the dreadful sentence of his death. The Chevalier was condemned to lose his head; and on the 27th November 1674, he was conducted on foot to the scaffold, along a gallery erected on a level with a window of the Fencing-school belonging to the Arsenal, where he was executed▪</P>

lately descended upon the earth; that he was now in the Bastille, but would soon be taken thence and put to death.</Q> The partisans of this ecclesiastic obtained the common appellation of Vaillantists. In a course of time, the rigour with which he was treated in the Bastille, to∣gether with his own austerities, turned his brain. He harboured at times the idea that he was indeed the prophet Elias; and firmly believing that he should one day be caught up in a whirlwind of fire, he made no scruple of honestly communica∣ting this opinion to the officers of l'Etat-Major. On the 26th of January 1739 the chimney of his apartment took fire, and he welcomed the mo∣ment, so long expected, of his elevation; but the fire was soon extinguished, and he remained under lock and key as usual. He now thought himself bound to make a ferious declaration in writing to the Lieutenant de Police, <Q>That he, Vaillant, was in no sense the Prophet Elias; that he did not represent him, and that he had no authority for announcing him, or for ac∣ting or speaking in his name.</Q> Long solitude impaired his intellects. Having entered the chapel one Sunday to hear mass, he suddenly seized the vestments, put on the cope, &amp;c. and began mass. The people called for assistance, and the Major came, and tried in vain to stop the priest, who, quite regardless of all about him, continued the service. The Major seized him, the priest resisted, and the champions at last col∣lared each other. This scene deprived the pri∣soner from ever again attending the mass. He was afterwards conveyed to Vincennos, where he died.</P>

<HEAD>IV:</HEAD>
<P>The Comte de Lally was near three years in the Bastille. He was of a violent disposition, and one of his favourite maxims was, <Q>That he knew no pleasure so sweet as revenge; which was truly the pleasure of the gods!</Q> He ad∣ded. <Q>The Parliament will judge me with all the rigour of the laws; but the King will favour me and mitigate my sufferings.</Q></P>
<P>He had permission to have his secretary to re∣side with him; and this man he wearied out with perpetual vexation. One day the secreta∣ry having observed in the great Court a quanti∣ty of coagulated blood, which had been drawn by phlebotomy from one of the sick prisoners, and which the servant had carelessly thrown there, he conceived an idea that preparations were making for putting him to death, and im∣mediately became distracted.</P>
<P>The Major of the Bastille received orders to conduct the Comte Lally to the palace, to un∣dergo his final examination. M. le President commanded that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to divest him of the rib∣bon of his Order, and the other insignia of his dignities, but he refused to perform that office, which was immediately executed by the Hussars. The Comte was re-conducted to the Bastille, and all visits in future, and permission to walk out, were prohibited. The officers kept him comp∣any by turns from this time till his execution, which did not take place till three or four days after his condemnation. In the mean time, his friends and relations took opportunity of passing in their carriage by the side of the gate St. Anto∣ine,
<PB N="46" REF="030151_0043_0FE4AE9C3B236F50"/>
and before his window, making signs to him to anticipate his fate by cutting his throat; but all their signals were useless; the prisoner, absor∣bed in reflection, never cast his eyes that way, and left to the executioner, what, had he per∣ceived their instigations, he would certainly have saved him the trouble of performing. The Ma∣jor received orders, to remove Lally into, the Conciergerie, there to pass the night of horror preceding his execution, and to continue with him the whole time. Here he became reconci∣led to that officer whom he had ever before de∣tested. The next morning M. Pasquier, a Councellor of Parliament, said to him, <Q>The King is full of mercy, and will certainly par∣don you if you will declare every thing you know of your two accomplices, &amp;c.</Q> Lally flew into a rage, called M. Pasquier a perfidious man, abused him in the grossest manner, and poured out on him the most horrid imprecations and blasphemies. The magistrate gave imme∣diate orders for gagging him; but soon after, the confessor appearing, the gag was taken out of his mouth. He then made a feint of removing a little on one side, drew a point of a compass, which he had ingeniously concealed, and stabbed himself with great violence, with a full design of preventing the ignominy which was preparing before his eyes. The attendants however per∣ceived and disarmed him, when he vehemently exclaimed; "F—, I have missed the blow!" The surgeon found the wound not mortal; he became gradually more calm, was confessed, and soon after executed, May 1766.</P>
