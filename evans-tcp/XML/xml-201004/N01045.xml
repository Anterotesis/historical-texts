<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is the great unhappiness of our Age, that the greatest part of men busie themselves most in that which concerns them least; look into the World, amongst rich end poor, high and low, young and old, and see whether it appear not by the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le scope of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Conversations, that they set more by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mething else than Christ and Sal∣vation so they may have but some of the Earth in their Hands, they ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for nothing of Heaven in their Hearts, though Gold can no more fill their Hearts than Grace their Purses.</P>
<P>Most Men are like the silly Woman, that when her H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse was on fire, so minded the saving of her G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds, that she left her Child ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting in the flames: at last being put in remembrance of it she cries out, Oh my Child, my Child! Oh how many men are there, that drop into Perdition meerly for a little Wealth!</P>
<P>There are many that are temporally Misera∣ble, that are eternally Happy; and there are many that are temporally Happy, that shall be eternally Miserable. Oh there is a great vanity in all worldly Excellencies; the Earth is big in Hopes, but little in our Hands; it cannot satis∣fie the Senses of Men, much less can it satisfie the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>Dear Christians, according to my Talent re∣ceived, I have endeavoured to set forth the Rich∣es, the Loveliness, the Preciousness and Excel∣lencies
<PB REF="001244_0004_0FB18676661A3DF0"/>that are in Christ, to draw the Heart af∣ter Him, and to be sick of Love for Him: Oh Jesus Christ is a Fountain of Life, Light, Love, Grace, Glory, Comfort, Joy, Goodness, Sweetness, always full and flowing, yea, ever-flowing. <HI>Paul</HI> was so much taken with Christ, that he was ever in his Thoughts, always near his Heart, &amp; upon his Tongue; he names him six or seven times in one Chapter, <HI>1 Cor. 1.</HI> Oh that our Hearts and Thoughts were thus busted about Christ, and ta∣ken up with Christ, and those treasures of Wis∣dom and Knowledge that are in Him.</P>
<P>The Design of this Piece is not the Ostentation of the Author, but the Edification of the Reader; tho' the Author be contemptible, yet the Matter is comfortable. I hope none will blow out such a Candle upon Earth, by the light of which, them∣selves may see the Way to Heaven; If God had given in more of himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f to me, I should have gi∣ven more out to thee; but God leeks not for what he gives not; If God may have glory, and the Church edification by these labours of mine, I shall have my end. Now the good Lord bring thy heart more and more in love with Christ, who is alto∣gether lovely, that shortly thou mayest enjoy end∣less felicity in his bosome.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUT of the Lion of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> comes bitter and sweeter <HI>Honey,</HI> than out of <HI>Sampson</HI>'s Lion: That is the sweetest Honey which we suck out of Christ's Hive: for the face of none is so comely in a Saints eye, as the face of Christ; and the voice of none is so pleasant in a Saints ear, as the voice of Christ. O Christian! the God whom tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> servest is so excellent, that no good can be ad∣ded to him; and so infinite, that no good can be diminish'd in him: He makes happy, and yet is not the less happy; He shews mercy to the full, and yet remains full of mercy▪ O come eat and drink abundantly! O <HI>Beloved!</HI> there is no fear of excess here, though one drop of Christ be sweet, yet the deeper the sweeter.</P>
<P>The Wine that Christ draws, is the best Wine that a Christian drinks. This whole Book of <HI>Canticles</HI> is bespangled with the praises of Jesus Christ. The subject matter of this
<PB N="2" REF="001244_0005_0FB186782B4DE830"/>Book i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Declaration of the mutual intercourse of Love and Affection between Christ and his Church, what spiritual entertainment is given on both sides, with the sweet content they have in each others beauty. Here you may see the King in his glory, the Spouse in her beauty; here you may see Christ giving her sweet Promises, adorning her with sundry Ex∣cellencies, communicating his Love, and com∣mending her Graces. Here you may also see the Church even ravish'd with the considerati∣on, and contemplation of Christ's Love and Beauty; his Beauty is taking, his Love is ra∣vishing, his Voice is pleasing, his Goodness is drawing, his Manifestations are inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, he is the beloved Son, and the Son of Love, he is nothing but Love to those who are his Love. But I shall no longer detain you with a Crumb at the Door, but carry you to the Chapter out of which my Text is taken, and so lead you to the Cabinet where the Jewel lieth.</P>
<P>Brethren and Beloved, you have a glorious description of Jesus Christ in this Chapter, and that from <HI>Verse</HI> 10. to <HI>Ver.</HI> 16. where the Spouse is setting forth the Riches, the Dignity, the Excellency, the Beauty, the Majesty, the Glo∣ry, the Preciousness, and Loveliness of Jesus Christ; <HI>He is white and ruddy, the chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st among ten thousand: His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy and black as a Raven, his eyes are as the eyes of Dove, by the Rivers of waters, washed with Milk, and fitly set, his cheeks are as a Tree of Spices, as sweet Flowers, his lips like Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, drop∣ping sweet-smelling Myrrhe, his hands are as Gold-rings set forth with Beril, his belly is as bright <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣very.

We will begin wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the first of these famous Titles, to wit, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire of all Na∣tions.</HI> This Title you have in the second of <HI>Hagga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and the seventh verse, <HI>And the Desire of all Nations sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> But you will say, How is Christ the Desire of all Nations? Do not all
<PB N="4" REF="001244_0006_0FB186796500A800"/>the Nations abhor him, and say, we will not have this man to rule over us? <HI>The Kings of the earth set themselves, and the Rulers take counsel to∣gether against the Lord, and against his Anointed, Psal.</HI> 2. <HI>verse</HI> 2. Here you see the Kings of the Earth were afraid, lest Christ's Government should un-king them. The Rulers were jea∣lous, lest it should depose them from their Dignities. The People were afraid of it, lest it should compel them to subjection to that Law and Way which their souls abhorr'd. O how long hath the World rebelled against <HI>Je∣sus Christ</HI> and his Government! But tell me, have the People gained any thing by resisting Christ, his Gospel and Government, by hating his Servants, and by scorning his holy Ways? Or doth it make the Crowns sit faster on the heads of Kings? I will leave you to judge of this. But, <HI>Beloved,</HI> for all this, <HI>Jesus Christ is the Desire of all Nations.</HI> And that I shall shew you in five particulars. Though <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> be not actively desired by all Nations, yet he is rightly stiled, <HI>The Desire of all Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Because he is most desireable in him∣self, and all things that are desireable are in him. Beauty is in <HI>Christ,</HI> Bounty is in <HI>Christ,</HI> Riches and Honours are in <HI>Christ,</HI> Prov. 8.18. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is the Treasure hid in the Gospel, the Pearl of great price, he is the Sun in the Firmament of the Scriptures, whom to know is Everlasting Life; he is a Spring full of the Water of Life, a Hive of Sweetness, a Maga∣zine of Riches, a River of Pleasures, wherein you may bathe your souls to all Eternity. O he is fulness and sweetness, the <HI>chiefest among
<PB N="5" REF="001244_0006_0FB186796500A800"/>ten thousand, Cant.</HI> 5.10. He is more precious than Rubies, <HI>and all the things thou canst desire, are not to be compared to him,</HI> Prov. 3.15. Alas, what are all the Crowns and Kingdoms of tho World, all the Thrones and Scepters of Kings, to Christ? I say, What are the Treasures of the East, the Gold of the West, the Spices of the South, and the Pearls of the North, to them? This, or whatsoever thou dost ima∣gine, are not to be compared unto blessed Je∣sus. <HI>Beloved,</HI> the Glories and Excellencies of <HI>Christ,</HI> excel all others; as all Waters meet in the Sea, and as all the Lights meet in the Sun; so all the Perfections and Excellencies of all the Saints and Angels meet in <HI>Christ.</HI> Nay, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. <HI>Christ</HI> hath not only the Holiness of An∣gels, the Loveliness of Saints, and the Trea∣sures of Heaven, but also the Fulness of the God-head, and the Riches of the Deity are in him, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.19. <HI>For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell;</HI> fulness of Grace, ful∣ness of Knowledge, fulness of Love, fulness of Glory: He is lovely to the Father, lovely to the Angels, lovely to the Saints, and lovely to the Soul; &amp; therefore he may well be called, <HI>The Desire of all Nations,</HI> for all desireable things are in him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Jesus Christ</HI> is called <HI>the Desire of all Nations,</HI> because his desires are after all Nati∣ons, though he hath no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed of them; he hath thousands of Angels before him, and <HI>ten thou∣sand</HI> daily ministring unto him; yet such infi∣nite love doth he bear to the Sans of Men, in whom there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o loveliness, that he himself saith, <HI>My delight to with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of mon,</HI> Prov. 8.11.
<PB N="6" REF="001244_0007_0FB1867B8FD2FAC8"/>That our Lord Jesus hath a strong desire after the Nations, to convert them, and save the Nations, will appear by three things.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By what he did before he came into the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By what he did when he was in the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By what he doth now he is out of the World.</ITEM>
</LIST>
1. Our Lord Jesus had a great desire after the poor Nations, before he came into the World, or else he would never have left his <HI>Crown,</HI> his <HI>Royal Court,</HI> his <HI>Father's Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> his <HI>Glorious Robes,</HI> to come into this World to be spit upon by men, and to be murdered by men; nay, he did not only become a <HI>laughing stock</HI> to Men, but a <HI>gazing stock</HI> to Angels. Now, Beloved, do you not think that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> had a great desire after the <HI>Nations good,</HI> that he would leave all his <HI>glory,</HI> and <HI>greatness,</HI> and <HI>pomp,</HI> and <HI>riches,</HI> to come into this World to he poor, to be hungry, to be weary, to be tempted, to be forsaken, to be betrayed, to be sold? But you may perhaps say, that Christ little thought his own Country-men would have shed his blood, and that one of his own Family would betray him. Why, <HI>Beloved,</HI> do you think he did not know it? yea, he knew it before he came into the World, how he should be used in the World, that the <HI>Jews</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ld Crucifie him, and that <HI>Judas</HI> would be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.46. He knew it from the be∣ginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him: <HI>Christ</HI> knew it before they knew it. Alas, our Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> knew it before he came from Heaven, what coarse <HI>En∣tertainment</HI> he should have upon Earth. Now, <HI>Beloved.</HI> put all this together, and tell me, had
<PB N="7" REF="001244_0007_0FB1867B8FD2FAC8"/>not <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> a great desire after us, before he came to us? That he would uncrown himself to crown us, and put off his Robes to put on our Rags, and to come out of Heaven to keep us out of Hell? He fasted forty days, that he might feast us to all Eternity. He came from Heaven to Earth, that he might send us from Earth to Heaven. The Son of God became the Son of Man, that we the Sons of Men might become the Sons of God; and all this he did to save the Nations. 2. He had a strong desire after the Nations when he was in the World. Oh, <HI>Christ</HI> would fain have saved the Nations, and healed them, &amp; enlightned them, therefore he sends forth his Apostles, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19. and bids them. <HI>Go and teach all Nations;</HI> the people were in his eye, and upon his heart; and so in <HI>Mat.</HI> 22 <HI>Christ</HI> sends forth his ser∣vants once, twice, thrice, as if he would take no denial, but they would not come. Nay, <HI>Beloved,</HI> our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> did not only send others to poor souls to beseech them, to en∣treat them to come in, to repent and to believe in their Saviour, that their souls might be sa∣ved, but he went himself and desired them: Nay, that is not all, <HI>Beloved,</HI> he cried to them, and said, <HI>If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink,</HI> Joh. 7.37. O how earnest was <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> with poor souls to come to him! <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,</HI> Mat. 11.28. So in <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.</HI> 14.23, <HI>Go to the Highw̄ays, and compel them to come in, that my house may be full.</HI> Do you see this, <HI>Christians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> What vehement desires Jesus Christ had after the Nation and Souls of men, that he
<PB N="8" REF="001244_0008_0FB1867C60D83018"/>might for ever make them happy when he was in the World, &amp; he hath the same desire still: How often would Jesus Christ have healed the <HI>Jews,</HI> that poor Nation, as he himself speaketh in <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n gathereth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er young ones, and you would not?</HI> Nay, when he had done all this, he doth not leave them, but weeps o∣ver-them, his eyes were wet, because their eyes were dry. So that it is clear by what Christ did when he was in the World, that he desired much the healing and converting of Nations.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In his Forbearance and Long-sufferance. O! how long hath Jesus Christ born with the sinful Nations, and yet he bears with them still, notwithstanding they have broke his Laws, and despised his Gospel, and contemn his Ordinances, and shed his Saints blood, grieved his Spirit, and abused his Mer∣cies: This and thus much they have done, and yet he spareth them that he might be gracious to them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.18. and therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious to you. Therefore will he be exalted, that he may shew mercy. Now, <HI>Beloved,</HI> do you think that Jesus Christ would take all this at the Nations hands, but that he is unwilling to destroy them, and most willing to save them?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His
<PB N="9" REF="001244_0008_0FB1867C60D83018"/>Love appears not only by his bearing with them, but by his proffers to them. O <HI>Beloved,</HI> how doth God stand day after day, month af∣ter month, and year after year, proffering Him∣self, his Son, his Mercies, his Love, his Grace and his Glory to poor souls? Many have the Space of Repentance, who have not the Grace of Repentance. Now, my Brethren, by these things you may see that Jesus Christ hath a great desire after the Nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Jesus Christ is called <HI>the Desire of all Nations,</HI> because it is he only that can make any Person, or Family, or Nation, truly desirable.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Oh, <HI>Beloved,</HI> what is the reason that the Lord of Hosts prefers' his people before all the Sons of Men? The Lord prefers his little Remnant before all the World beside; <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.5. <HI>You shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people. The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour, Proc.</HI> 12.26. Tho' his Neighbour be great, rich, honourable, yet if he be more Righte∣ous, he is more excellent than he in Christ's eye. Believers be those Worthies, <HI>of whom the world was not worthy,</HI> Heb. 11.35. <HI>Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priest-hood, an holy na∣tion, a peculiar people,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.9. Believers are not only diligent Christians, but excellent Christians.</P>
<P>Now what is the reason, Beloved, that the Saints are thus excellent above all others? is it for their birth, breeding, or learning, or rich∣es, or greatness, or honour? No, no; it is for none of these: but if you will know the rea∣son, it is because Christ is formed in them, and married to them; they have the new Name,
<PB N="10" REF="001244_0009_0FB1867EC11855A0"/>the new Nature, the new Heart, the new Spi∣rit: Oh this is the reason! If there were any thing besides Christ, that could make any Na∣tion, or Family, or Person truly desirable, it must be either birth, or greatness, or learning, or riches, or beauty, or wisdom, or strength; now all these do not make any one desirable: for if they did, than those that sit upon the Nations would be the most desirable persons under Heaven; because they have the most of these: but for this, see <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> 4▪17. <HI>And s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up over it the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st of men,</HI> Rev. 17.15. <HI>The wa∣ters which thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, where the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are peoples, and mul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> So that none of these then can do it, but Christ only, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.10.</P>
<P>He hath made us unto our God, <HI>Kings and Priests;</HI> O Christ hath made every Believer as a King to his Father: it is Christ's beauty that makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s beautiful; it is his riches that makes us rich; it is his righteousness that maketh us righteous; he only maketh us truly honoura∣ble and desirable; well may Christ be called the <HI>Desire of all Nations;</HI> it is he that can make a Nation desirable.</P>
<P N="4">4. Jesus Christ is called <HI>the Desire of all Nati∣ons,</HI> because all Nations stand in need of him: nay, not only all Nations, but all Persons, young and old, rich and poor, high and low; he that will be saved, must have a Saviour to save him, or else he can never be saved. the Apostle tells us, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there salva∣tion in any other: for there is none other name un∣der heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</HI> And Christ saith, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.16. <HI>I am the
<PB N="11" REF="001244_0009_0FB1867EC11855A0"/>way, and the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the father but by me.</HI> So that not only all Nations, but all Persons stand in need of him. You may go to Heaven without health, without wealth, without honours, without pleasures, without friends, without learning; but you can never go to Heaven without Christ. What will you do, if you begin to die Naturally, before you begin to live Spiritually; if the tabernacle of Nature be taken down, before the Temple of Grace be raised up; if your Paradise be laid waste, before the Tree of Life be set in it; if you give up the Ghost, before ever you receive the Holy Ghost; if the Sun of your Life be set within you before the Sun of Righteous∣ness shine upon you; if the Body be fit to be turn'd into the Earth, before the Soul be fit to be taken into Heaven; if the se∣cond Birth have no place in you, the second Death shall have a power over you? Tho' the Nations need nothing more than <HI>Christ,</HI> yet they slight nothing more than Christ. Tell me, how will you live when you die, that are dead whilst you live? O Beloved! is it not sad that the Nations should resist Christ, his Gospel and Goverment as they do? Indeed if men might be their own Judges, then Christ had no Enemies, we are all his Friends. If the Jews might so have been their own Judges, it was not the Son of God whom they crucified, but an Enemy to <HI>Caesar.</HI> It was not <HI>Paul</HI> a Saint that they
<PB N="12" REF="001244_0010_0FB186802B84B770"/>persecuted, but one that they found to be a pestilent Fellow. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> men will say now, they do not persecute the Saints of God, but seditious Fanaticks; but God will shortly take oft the Veil of Hypocrisie from their Faces. O grieve for them that cannot grieve for themselves. And thus you see that all Nations stand in need of Christ, who is <HI>the Desire of all. Nations.</HI> 5. Our Lord Jesus is called <HI>the Desire of all Nations,</HI> because when he sets up himself in any one as their De∣sire, then they run after him, and count no∣thing too dear for him. So the Church of God, Isa. 26.8, 9. <HI>The desire of our soul is to thy name; with my soul have I desired thee in the night, yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.</HI> Oh, when the <HI>Desire of all Nations</HI> once setteth up himself in the Soul then he becomes the desire of the Soul. When he hath thus endeared himself to their Souls, then they count nothing too de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r for him; all shall be at his command, their gold; their silver, their strength, their lives, Rev. 10.11. <HI>They loved not their lives unto the death.</HI> So that, Beloved, let men be Enemies to Jesus Christ, yet as soon as Christ sets up himself in their Hearts, they will love him, own him, serve him, and suffer for him. Now, <HI>Sirs,</HI> put all these together, and it will fully prove Christ to be <HI>the Desire of all Nations.</HI> I shall make but a short use of it, and so conclude. Is it so that our Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>the Desire of all Nations,</HI> and that all things desirable a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

And why? Because he was <HI>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</HI> This is the first, Jesus Christ is his Enemies King; that is, he is a King above their Kings, and over their Kings. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As Jesus Christ is <HI>his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es King,</HI> so he is <HI>his Saints King:</HI> I will give you two Scriptures to prove it, though I need not, yet I will, because of making things very clear as I go on: in Rev. 15.3. there Jesus Christ is called the Saints King, <HI>Thou King of Saints.</HI> So also in <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.5. <HI>Tell ye the Daughters of Si∣on, Behold, thy King cometh.</HI> So that by those two Scriptures, you see Jesus Christ is King of Saints. Now, Beloved, I beseech you here to mind me; Jesus Christ, you see, is King of the bad, and of the good; but as for the wic∣ked, he rules over them by his Power and Might, but the Saints he rules in them by his Spirit and Graces. Now to this the Scripture witnesseth, that Jesus Christ rules in the Saints, and is King of the Saints; and therefore it tells us, in Col. 1.

<ITEM>3. Christ is a <HI>King that livet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for ever,</HI> &amp; reigns for ever; other Kings they are but of yester∣day, they be dead and gone.

<ITEM>4. Jesus Christ is a King that hath a perfect knowledge of all his Subjects. Oh, Sirs, Kings and Princes, and States, do not know all their Subjects, nay they know very few; alas, they know not a quarter of them, the poor subjects are unknown to them, they be not so well ac∣quainted with their wrongs, and wants, and miseries that thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poor subjects lie under: we are unknown must of us to our Prince.

<ITEM>5. Jesus Christ is a King that sits upon his Father's Throne, at this very time he sits upon his Father's Throne. But, Beloved, this is not all, Christ doth not only sit there himself, but he hath promised that all men who overcome shall sit down with him upon the Throne: you have a full Text to this purpose, in Rev. 21. <HI>To him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it erco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth will I grant to sit with me upon my Thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k, Sirs! Christ promises all his Subjects, that they should sit upon the Throne with him: New I wonder where there is any King but Christ who will suffer his Subjects to sit upon his Throne with him: Alas, this would he Treason for a man to desire it. I remember, amongst other things, I have read of a King, who passing over a water, his Crown fell from his head into the water, and one of his poor Servants, out of love to him, leapt in and fetcht it up, and for his more ease put it upon his head, that he might get the better out; and for this the poor man had his head cut off: so high, and mighty, and lofty was the Prince.

Oh how should this draw the affections of men to be in love with those great proffers and priviledges, and honours that Christ bestoweth upon his poor follow∣ers!

</LIST>
There are nine or ten parti∣culars wherein the love of Christ to his sub∣jects doth appear, and is wonderfully mani∣fest.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>His love to his subjects,</HI> 'tis Primary: <HI>We love him,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>because he lov∣ed
<PB N="24" REF="001244_0016_0FB1868E8EC97238"/>us first,</HI> 1 Joh. 4.19. We love him, and why? <HI>Because he loved us first;</HI> his love is the cause preceding, our love is the effect follow∣ing: If he had not fired our hearts with the flames of his love, we should never h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve be∣stow'd one spark of spiritual love upon Christ; he must draw before we can run; and there∣fore says the Church, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. <HI>Draw us, and we will run after thee.</HI> Oh Sirs, we cannot run without drawing, he must draw us before we can, and when he draweth then we run. It was not mans loveliness that engaged God to love and save man; God loveth his Enemies even in their sinful estate, tho' not with a love of well liking of them, yet with a love of well willing to them. Oh, Sirs, since God loved us when we were not like him, we should strive to be like him who thus loved us; nothing enga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth a Saint to love God so much as this, that God loved him so much. A Minister once weeping at the Table, and being asked the reason of it, answered, <HI>Because I love Christ no more.</HI> Indeed, Friends, this should grieve us, that we love so little, who are so much be∣loved. You have a famous saying of <HI>Austin, He loves not Christ at all, who loves him not above all.</HI> This is the first love wherewith God loves his people, tis a primary love.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Christ is a King that loves his Subjects with a distin∣guishing love, and a separating love; the ge∣neral love of Christ is scattered and branched out to all the Creatures in the World, but his special love is exceeding great, and rich love is only setled upon his Church. Now if you ask me what Christ's distinguishing love is, I
<PB N="25" REF="001244_0016_0FB1868E8EC97238"/>shall name it, and but name it to you.

This I say, is his peculiar Love; Christ's Love is not only sweeter than Wine, but better than Life: He is most lovely, he is always lovely, <HI>He is altogether lovely;</HI> Christ is nothing but Love to those who are his Lovers</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Christ loves his Saints with a protecting love, <HI>Isa.</HI> 15.49 <HI>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ssion on the son of her womb?</HI> Can a woman forget her sucking child? Is it possible a woman should be so in∣humane to forget her tender infant, and not have compassion on the son of her womb? <HI>Yes,</HI> says the Lord, <HI>they may forget them, yet I will not forget thee,</HI> God may as soon cease to be God, as cease to be good; he may as soon cease to live, as cease to love; no, no, he cannot forget them: Did he forget <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> or his <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>Babylon,</HI> or <HI>Daniel</HI> in the <HI>Lions</HI> Den? Did he forget the three <HI>Children</HI> in the Fur∣nace, or <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in the Dungeon, or <HI>Jonas</HI> in the <HI>Whale's</HI> belly, or <HI>Peter</HI> in Prison? Did he forget them? The wicked say indeed, the Lord doth forget, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9. <HI>The Lord hath for∣gotten the earth, and he sees it not,</HI> but they are much mistaken. There are three or four Texts of Scripture which I shall humbly offer to your serious consideration, that do wonderfully speak out God's protecting love to his people. The first is in Rev. 7.2, 3. you find there an Angel hath power given him <HI>to hurt the earth and the sea.</HI> Now there comes another Angel
<PB N="26" REF="001244_0017_0FB18690BA33F2B8"/>and cries out, <HI>hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees.</HI> Why? what's the reason? why, in the third Verse, <HI>Until we have sealed the servant of God in the forehead.</HI> Do not you pour out your Judgments upon them, until we have se∣cur'd the Servants of God.

So in <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 3.10. the Lord bids the Prophet tell them, what find Judgments should come upon them; upon un∣righteous Kings and Princes, and great Men and Souldiers Now says the Lord, <HI>Say to the righteous, it shall be well with them, none of this shall come near them.</HI> O how wonderfully doth this magnifie God's protecting love! <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.20. <HI>Come, my people, enter into your chambers, shut the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and hide your selves for a little moment:</HI> Why so, O Lord? why? <HI>until thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dignation be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> past.</HI> Come, says God, I am resolved to exe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te my Judgments on wicked men, therefore hide your selves for a moment. And therefore I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t no man's heart fail him, 'tis but for a moment, and thy miseries shall end. Beloved, when our miseries are at the greatest, his help is at the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rest; Man's extremity is God's op∣portunity; when <HI>Mord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is throughly hum∣bled, the Rod <HI>Haman</HI> shall be hanged.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. But then fourthly, Christ loves his people with a most cordial love, he loves them with all
<PB N="27" REF="001244_0017_0FB18690BA33F2B8"/>his heart; nay, they are the dearly beloved of his soul, as himself calls them, Jer. 12. <HI>I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.</HI> Christ's love to his people, 'tis not a lip love, from the teeth outwardly, but a re∣al love from the heart inwardly. Christ loves his people as his Father loves him, and how is that, can you tell? No, all the men on earth, nor Angels in heaven, cannot declare the love that the Father bears to Christ; and yet as God loves Christ▪ so doth Christ love his people. You have a full Text for this▪ they are Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, so love I you.</HI> Oh, Sirs, how infinitely doth the Father love the Son, and how infinitely doth the Son love his people. Why, he loves them as the Father loves him. Oh Lord, what love is this, that the Saviour should love the Sinner, that Christ should love the miserable Sinner? And yet thus it is, Oh, Sirs, Believers are like I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tters of Gold engraven on the very heart of Christ, <HI>Oh the breadth, the depth, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ight, the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gth of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve of Christ,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>it poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th know∣ledge;</HI> as if so be he wanted words to set it forth, in <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.20. <HI>The love of Christ which posseth know∣ledge.</HI> As if so be there were both want of-words, and want in words, to set forth the love of Christ▪ But certainly it must be very great, for as the Father loves him▪ so he loves them. Alas, others love the Saints, but how, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they love them? Why▪ not with a cordial love; they do not love them for their good, but for their goods; 'tis more for the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in their purses, than for the grace in their hearts, they love the Saint, as the <HI>Sama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tans</HI> did the

But when the poor <HI>Jews</HI> were under affliction, then they had no worse enemies than they. Why, but Christ's love is not so, he loves thee when thou art poor as well as when thou art rich; as well when thou art in rags, as when thou art in thy robes; when thou art in adversity, as well as when thou art in prosperity: Christ loves his Saints as well upon Gallows, as in a Palace; for whom he loves, he loves unto the end, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.5. <HI>He is faithful, who hath said, I will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> nor forsake thee:</HI> Never leave thee in any condition, or any place. O Sirs, what a love is this<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and therefore a rush for what the world can do, or for the world's love, 'tis like a <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice</HI> Glass, soon broken; it smiles now, and quickly frowns; it cries <HI>Hosanna</HI> to day, and to morrow, <HI>Crucifie him:</HI> but Christ's love is with the very heart.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Jesus Christ loves his Sub∣jects with a love of benevolence, Joh. 3. <HI>God so l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved the world, that he gave his only begotten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> And says <HI>Paul, He lov∣ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and gave himself for me,</HI> Gal. 2.20. The Father gives the Son, &amp; the Son gives himself▪ who loved me, and gave himself for me; all that Christ did and suffered, 'tis for me: All that Christ hath, is mine. Oh, soul, soul, Christ's love 'tis thine to pity thee, Christ's mercy is thine to save thee, Christ's graces are
<PB N="29" REF="001244_0018_0FB1869222264388"/>thine to beautifie thee, and his glory is thine to crown thee, Christ's power is thine to pro∣tect thee, thou seest. He that is sure of God's love to him, is sure of God's power for him: And Christ's wisdom is thine to counsel thee, and his Angels are thine to guard thee, and his Spirit is thine to comfort thee, and his word is thine to teach thee. There are four Attri∣butes of God, which are of great support to Christians.

And therefore, Sirs, 'tis your duty to live upon Pro∣mises, while Providence seems to run cross to Promises. Christ's love to you 'tis free love. All that he hath given you 'tis free, his grace is free, his love is free, his salvation is free, his peace is free, and himself is free. A dram of grace in the heart is better than a chain of gold about the neck! Now, Beloved, all that Christ hath bestowed upon you, 'tis free, and there∣fore 'tis a love of Benevolence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Christ loves his subjects with a love of compassion, sympa∣thizing with them in all their sorrows &amp; suf∣ferings.

<P>BEloved, you know how far we proceeded the last Lord's Day. I finish'd the 6th. Par∣ticular, wherein Jesus Christ, the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th surmount and excel all other Kings, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s thus? <HI>Jesus Christ loves all his Subjects, &amp; all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Subjects love him:</HI> And I shewed you the wonderful love of Christ to his Subjects, and his subjects love to him, in many particulars: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w proceed to other particulars wherein Christ excels the Kings of the earth.</P>
<P>Seventhly; <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> makes all his Subjects:

Oh <HI>Sirs. Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Riches</HI> are so many they cannot be numbred, they are so precious they cannot be valued, so great they cannot be measured: Oh the infinite Riches of our King! <HI>Christ is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mine of Cold,</HI> in which we must dig till we find Heaven.</P>
<P>Ninthly, Christ excels all other Kings in this too. He's a King whose power is ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er all Nations, and People, and Kindreds, and Tongues. Now, <HI>Beloved,</HI> though e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchly Kings have a groat power, yet not an absolute power over all Nations, their power reaches no farther than their own Dominions: But now the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣er of Christ 'tis an absolute power over all Na∣tions, Kindreds and People.</P>
<P>Tenthly <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is a King who rules o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er the Souls and Consciences of men, over the will and hearts of men; other Kings may rule over the estates of men, over the bodies of man, but not over their Consciences: now this is
<PB N="48" REF="001244_0028_0FB186B0206559A8"/>Christs glory which he will give to no o∣ther; Christ by his power is able to subdue the wills of men, and the hearts of men, though ne∣ver so stubborn and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut before. All the po∣wer in the World cannot do this; If all the Kings and Princes and Emperours in the World were put together, they were not able to sub∣due the heart of one poor man: they may beat his body, afflict his body, torment his body; but as for his heart, I say all the Kings and Poten∣tates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. the World, nay, all the Angels in Hea∣ven cannot subdue the heart of a poor si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner; and this is the glory of Christ that He can d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this. Heart-work is Gods work; the great Heart-maker must be the great Heart-breaker <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> none can do it but he.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, Christ is a King that hath no need of any instruments, he makes, use of them some∣times, but he needs not any. Alas, <HI>Sirs,</HI> what can the Kings of the earth do without instru∣ments? How can they govern their Kingdoms without instruments? They must have thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> instrument here, and the other there, or else farewel <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI> quickly. But <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> has no need of any, he can do any thing by his own, power; by himself he destroyed <HI>Phar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h and his great host in the red sea,</HI> Exod. 14. By himself <HI>he overthrew Jericho, that great City,</HI> Josh. 6. By himself he smote that great Army of <HI>a thousand thousand men,</HI> the greatest Army that ever we read of, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 14.9. By himself he o∣verthrew <HI>Ammon</HI> and <HI>Moab,</HI> and <HI>Mount Seer,</HI> who warr'd against <HI>Judah,</HI> this now he did by himself.</P>
<P>Secondly, See what he hath done by we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k means; by weak means he smote the Kings
<PB N="49" REF="001244_0028_0FB186B0206559A8"/>about <HI>Sodom;</HI> even by <HI>Abraham</HI> and his poor Fa∣mily, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14.

By weak means he destroyed great <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ah,</HI> even by <HI>David;</HI> and great <HI>Sise∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> by a woman. By weak means he destroy∣ed a Garrison of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> even by <HI>Jo∣nathan</HI> and his Armor-bearer, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1 14 Now this he did by weak means, and much more. Now thirdly, See what be did con∣trary to means; Why contrary to means he delivered the <HI>three children from burning,</HI> being in the fire. <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. Contrary to means he de∣livered <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> from drowning, being in the Sea. Contrary to means he preserved <HI>Daniel</HI> from devouring being in a Den of Lyon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Contrary to means he kept the <HI>Israelites</HI> from being drown'd, being in the Sea: I say this he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d contrary to means. And I might s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew you what he hath done by contrary means, but I pass that, so that you see our King hath no need of Instruments, and there∣in he wonderfully excels all others.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, Christ is a King who will o∣vercome and subdue all our Enemies, all our Enemies within us, and all our Enemies with∣out us, our King will subdue them all. Our Enemies are very many, and very mighty, high in power, and high in pride, and we are very weak; we may all speak in <HI>Davids</HI> words, 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 3. says he, <HI>I am this day weak, though a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nted King.</HI> How? <HI>David,</HI> weak to day, and yet made King to day? <HI>Yes,</HI> says he, <HI>the sons of Zerviah are too hard for me:</HI> Why, but Sirs, Jesus Christ is King of Kings, King
<PB N="50" REF="001244_0029_0FB186B4CC7B8A98"/>those all Kings, and over all Kings, <HI>and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reign till he hath put all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Enemies under his feet,</HI> in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.25 Mark, he must Reign, he must of necessity, God hath spoken it, till he hath put all his Enemies under his Feet, not only some, but all. Oh this is good News to Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excellent News, what King can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o thus but Christ? what King can put all his Enemies under his feet? What earthly King can sub∣due all his Enemies? Alas, they cannot sub∣due their own, for some Kings that we read o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have fell before their Enemie; for want of strength; <HI>Richard</HI> the Third cried out in his distress, <HI>A Kingdom for a Horse, a Kingdom for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse;</HI> and yet all this could not save his life. Alas, alas, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most flourishing Kings have been so far from subduing their Subjects Enemies, that they cannot subdue their own, but Jesus Christ can subdue all his Enemies, <HI>He hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power in Heaven and Earth given to him,</HI> in <HI>Matt.</HI> 28. So that if he speaks the word, all his Ene∣mies are overthrown even in a moment.</P>
<P>In the Thirteenth place, Christ surmount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all other Kings in this, he is a King that gives his Subjects the richest and best gifts of any other King whatsoever, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.28. <HI>My sheep</HI> says he, <HI>hear my voice, and they know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and they follow me, and I give to them eternal life.</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wise God, that he may in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite and encourage poor souls to holiness of life, sets before their eyes the recompence of reward: that if the e∣quity of his precepts do not prevail the excel∣lency of his promises may; he would fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> catch men with a golden bait, <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant gave Jewels of silver, and Jewels of gold

Oh the Jewels, the excellent Jewels that Christ gives to poor souls to win their hearts unto him; <HI>Christ gives us richly all things to enjoy;</HI> what can you desire more? 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Alas, the men of the earth give but poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and penuriously, but Christ gives, richly Christ gives freely, no man in the World gives so freely as Christ, Christ gives frequently, every day, every hour, be scatter∣eth Jewels to poor souls. The great King of <HI>Person</HI> gave two of his Courtiets, to the one a Golden Cup, to the other a Kiss, and be than had the Cup complain'd to the King that his Fellow's Kiss was better than his Golden Cup. Oh, Sirs. Christ doth not put us off with a Cup of Gold, but gives us the Kiss; he gives the best gifts to his best beloved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, he gives his best love, his best joy, his best peace, his best mercies. Oh where is there a King like this King? alas, earthly Kings may give great Titles, or a place in the Court, and the like, they may give a Title to day, and a Halter to morrow, as in the case of <HI>Haman;</HI> he may smile to day, and frown to morrow; kiss to day and; kill to morrow; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Christ doth not so, he gives the best of every thing, the best of his love, his best blood, not the blood of his, sin∣gers, but the blood of his heart. Oh, Sirs, how far doth Christ excel all other in giving to his Subjects the best gifts. Oh, Sirs, what a gift is heaven, what a gift is pardon, of sin! what King can give his people such gifts; and herein the Lord Jesus infinitely excels all o∣thers.</P>

14. In the last place, Christ makes all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Subjects free, there is not one subject that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hath, but is a free man and woman. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are some things that Christ frees us from, and some things that he makes us free of; some things he frees us from and what is that? wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that which if we were not freed from, would undo us to all eternity.

<PB N="54" REF="001244_0031_0FB186B927552338"/>word of Application, and so shall finish this second Title, <HI>King of Kings.</HI> 1. Is it so that Christ is a three-fold King, as I have shewed you, and he is a King that doth so far sur∣mount all the Kings of the earth? Oh then however the World goe's here is comfort for Saints, that they have such a King. Oh what a mercy is this, what a comfort is this to the Lords people, that Christ is a King above all Kings, and over all Kings, and must reign <HI>till he hath put all his enemies under his feet!</HI> all his enemies must be brought down and made his <HI>Foot-stool.</HI> Now this should comfort the people of God, and teach them to wait Christ's leisure, and let him a∣lone; some earthly Kings would do great matters, but they want power; but Christ wants no power, for <HI>all power is given him in heaven and earth.</HI> Now, <HI>Sirs,</HI> did you real∣ly believe thus, that all power is given to Christ, certainly it would be a cordial to re∣vive you in the worst of times, and saddest of tryals. He who is our Saviour, he who is our Head, our Brother, our Friend, is <HI>King of Kings.</HI> Oh, <HI>Sirs,</HI> this Doctrine of <HI>Christ's</HI> Kingly power it is a very sweet Doctrine to the Members of Christ: and I beseech you let these considerations which I have laid be∣fore you bear up your spirits. I have shew∣ed you with what an entire love Christ loves his subjects, he is <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and can do any thing without instruments, he needs none to help him to do his work, he can if
<PB N="55" REF="001244_0031_0FB186B927552338"/>he pleaseth, inable the most despicable crea∣tures, as Flies, and Frogs, and Catterpillers and Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoppers to do his work: Therefore let these considerations take the impression upon your souls. If a man should tell you your Brother or Sister beyond the Seas were advanced to great honour; as <HI>Joseph</HI> when he heard his Father was alive go, says he, <HI>and tell my father of all my glory and greatness in</HI> Egypt, he'll rejoyce a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

Oh what a sad conditi∣on will it be! and therefore, I beseech you think of it in time, and believe in your Saviour, that your souls may be saved in the day of Christ.</HI></ITEM>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Doctrine,</HI> That Jesus Christ is infinitely and su∣perlatively lovely.</HEAD>
<P>I Finisht the second Title which is given to Christ in Scripture, <HI>King of Kings.</HI> I now proceed to a third, and that is, <HI>Mighty God;</HI> one of Christ's Titl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is, <HI>The Mighty God.</HI> You have it in <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.6. he is there called, <HI>The Mighty God.</HI> Beloved, I have shewed you from the second Title, That Christ is a great King, a King a∣bove all Kings, a King over all Kings, and the King of Kings, and that his Laws are most e∣qual, his Subjects most happy, having no other Tax <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid upon them, than Love and Fear. But now this Title holdeth him forth, not only as a great King, but as a great God, <HI>before wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all the Kings and Kingdoms are but as a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or a small dust,</HI> Isa. 40. From this Title, <HI>The Mighty God,</HI> I shall lay down this Proposition <HI>That Jesus Christ is true and perfect God. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Je∣sus Christ is true and perfect God,</HI> that is the point which I shall insist upon. There are two sorts of People in the World that deny my Doct∣rine, who deny the Deity of Jesus Christ, who say the second Person in the Trinity is not God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Unbelieving Jews.</HI> If Christ had came
<PB N="58" REF="001244_0033_0FB186BC300F8EF0"/>as the <HI>Jews</HI> dreamed, as a <HI>great Monarch,</HI> trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing upon nothing but Crowns and Scepters, and the necks of Kings, and had all the Poten∣tates of the Earth to attend his Train; I say, had Christ come in this worldly glory, and pomp, and power, then it may be the <HI>Jews</HI> would have believed on him, may be then he should have been their God. But now, Belov∣ed, because Christ came poorly, and meanly, <HI>and made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,</HI> as the Scripture saith, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2 7. He took none of this gallantry, none of this bravery upon him, but made himself of no reputation, and therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> slighted him, and disowned him. The <HI>Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> mock us at this day with our crucified God; Oh, say they, you worship a crucified God: and some of the <HI>Heathens</HI> said, <HI>They would not believe in a hanged God.</HI> O blessed Jesus, thus art thou re∣proached and despised by the unbelieving World, because thou camest poorly, and diest shamefully for our sins. They who despise the death of the Lamb, shall surely feel the wrath of the Lamb. They who turn away their ears from hearing Christ's voice now, Christ will turn away his ears from hearing their cries then.</P>
<P N="2">2. There be others that deny the Deity of Christ, and they are some seditious ones in this Nation, who say, that Christ is but meer Man, and that every Saint is as much God as Christ: And further, they say, that to equal Christ with God, is high Blasphemy. <HI>They that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id not own them at his first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing, Christ will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them at the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing: they that will not

But, Beloved, because the Deity of Christ is so much questioned at this day, and this being one of the serious and chiefest points in Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inity, therefore I shall give you some Consi∣derations or Demonstrations, or Arguments to fortifie you against this great Error before na∣med.

<P N="2">2. He is for Nature <HI>co-essential; I and my Fa∣ther are one,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.30. So again. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 5, 7. <HI>There are three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> record i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are one.</HI> Mark here, they are one, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.1.

Oh, Sirs, he is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the God-man, if you make the Son meer Man, you must make the Father so too.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="61" REF="001244_0034_0FB186BE5895C708"/>
3. He is for <HI>Dignity</HI> co-equal with the Fa∣ther, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.6. <HI>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with his Father.</HI> Christ thought it no diminution of his Fa∣thers glory, to be equal with his Father in glory. And you shall further find, that all the honour which belongs to God the Father, the Father hath commanded us to give it to the Son. You have a full Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 5.23. <HI>That all men should honour the son even as they honour the Father:</HI> For he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father. There∣fore tis clear to every eye, that Christ is for <HI>Dignity</HI> co-equal with the Father: for the Father hath commanded us to give the same <HI>Honour</HI> to Christ which is due to him; so that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> certainly, to e∣qual Christ with God, for in him are the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Deity, <HI>and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the God-head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him,</HI> as you may see, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.9. This is the first Argument, he's for <HI>Time</HI> co-eternal, for <HI>Nature</HI> co-essential, for <HI>Dignity</HI> co equal with the Father.</P>
<P>Secondly, I shall lay down this Argument to prove the <HI>Deity</HI> of Jesus Christ; consider the work of <HI>Creation;</HI> surely he that made <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> must needs be a God, you will yield to this, for says the Lord himself, <HI>All the Gods that have not made heaven and earth, shall perish from the earth, and from under hea∣ven,</HI> Jer. 10.11. But now, Beloved, Jesus Christ made the <HI>Heavens</HI> and the <HI>Earth,</HI> and all things therein, and therefore he is God:
<PB N="62" REF="001244_0035_0FB186BFD2C32578"/>See a few <HI>Scriptures</HI> for this, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3. <HI>All things were made by him.</HI> Mark, this is by Christ, all things were made by him, <HI>and without him was nothing made that was made,</HI> Col. 1.16. <HI>By him were all things created in heaven and earth, visible and invisible, all things were made by him and for him.</HI> So again, <HI>Joh</HI> 1.10. <HI>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</HI> Now Beloved, had Christ been less than God he could not have made Heaven and Earth, and therefore he is a God of Glory, the great God that now sits upon the <HI>Throne;</HI> for he created the Heavens and the Earth, and all things therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. That Christ is the true and perfect God, appears if you consider the works and miracles which he did in the days of his flesh; here is another unanswerable Argument to prove the God-head of Jesus Christ. <HI>The winds and the Seas obey him, the Devil came out of the possessed, the blind received their sight, the lame walked, the deaf heard, the dumb spake, le∣pers were cleansed, the dead were raised, the sick were healed.</HI> Oh, who could do this but God▪ as you may see, <HI>Mat</HI> 11.5. But you may say, the <HI>Apostles</HI> did great <HI>Miracles,</HI> and yet were no Gods. Why, 'tis true; they did great <HI>Miracles,</HI> but in whose <HI>Name</HI> did they do it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and by whose power and strength did they do't? was it in their own names, and by their own power? No, <HI>Beloved,</HI> they them∣selves confess the contrary, <HI>Act.</HI> 12.13. they
<PB N="63" REF="001244_0035_0FB186BFD2C32578"/>tell you, <HI>It is not by their own power, but in the Name and power of Jesus Christ,</HI> so in <HI>Act.</HI> 4.10. <HI>We do it in the Name of Christ.</HI> So that, Beloved, this is a strong Argument to prove the Deity of Christ; they did great Miracles in his Name, and by his power his Disciples did great Miracles. And with this Christ satisfied the Disciples of <HI>John, Go and tell what things you hear and see, how the lame walk, and the blind receive their sight,</HI> go &amp; tell <HI>John.</HI> Now I say, these great things could be done by none but a great God; &amp; therefore Jesus Christ is not only the Son of Man, but the Son of God, even the God blessed for ever.</P>
<P>But 4ly, Consider Divine Worship is due unto Christ▪ now you know Worship is pro∣per only to God, <HI>Worship him that made Hea∣ven and Earth and the Sea,</HI> said the Angel, <HI>Re.</HI> 14.7. Worship only is proper to God alone. Now, Beloved, all the Acts of Worship that belong to <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father,</HI> are given to the <HI>Son</HI> Jesus Christ, both Angels and men are com∣manded to <HI>worship him</HI> as well as we, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1 6. <HI>Let the Angels of God worship him,</HI> &amp; in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.10. <HI>That at the Name of Jesus every knee should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, of things in heaven, &amp; things on the Earth.</HI> Mark, Sirs, things in Heaven, as well as things on Earth, must worship Christ &amp; Christ him∣self says, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 14.1. <HI>Ye believe in God, believe al∣so in me.</HI> Mark, Sirs, speaking to those that believed in God, says he, <HI>Ye believe in God; believe also in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Now, Beloved, we are commanded to pray to Christ, to glorifie
<PB N="64" REF="001244_0036_0FB186C0A235B890"/>Christ, to believe in Christ, to honour Christ, and worship Christ, and therefore the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have prayed, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my spirit; as St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣phen did:</HI> so that you see Worship is due to Christ both from Angels and men, and there∣fore he must needs be God.</P>

<P>First, That God in Christ, <HI>the Everlasting Father,</HI> hath-begot himself in us, and us in himself; <HI>He is both the Author and Finisher of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faith,</HI> Heb. 12.2. of all our Joy, of all our Peace, of all our Life, of all our Salva∣tion; he is a <HI>Father</HI> ever begetting and bring∣ing forth himself in us, his light is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his love is in us, his nature is in us, his wisdom is in us, his power and strength is in us, <HI>Of his fulness we have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l received gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> Joh. 1.16.

<P N="2">2. God in Christ calleth all his children by his Name, he putteth his Name upon them. Do you mark <HI>Sirs, I will write upon them the Name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y God,</HI> in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.12.

Goodness without Great∣ness, is better than Greatness without Good∣ness. That's the second.</P>
<P N="3">3. God in <HI>Christ</HI> is a Father, who is tender and full of bowels towards his poor Chil∣dren; when we were full of blood then he was full of bowels. <HI>Christ</HI> is more tender of his body <HI>mystical,</HI> than he was of his body na∣tural; he suffer'd his body natural to be hun¦gry, to be thirsty, to be weary, to hang upon the Cross, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bleed upon the Cross, to suffer upon the Cross, to be pierced &amp; boared with nails upon the Cross. Oh, he went into the furnace to keep us out of the flames. But now mark, <HI>Sirs,</HI> for his body mystical. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how tender is he, he loves them, he pities them, he smiles upon them, he carries them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his bosom, and dandles them on his knee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Oh, they are the beauty of his eye, the joy of his heart; he cannot endure to see them wronged, see them injured or abused, every blow they have, goes to his very heart. <HI>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</HI> You see how tender Christ is of his body mystical. This is our <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> who threw himself into the Sea of his Fathers wrath to save us from drown∣ing. He hath shut the doors of Hell to keep us from Perdition, and he hath opened the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are of Heaven to let us into Salvation.

<PB N="80" REF="001244_0044_0FB186D740AB9D98"/>another Divine Lesson which Christ teacheth his children. A Believer will be contented to bear the wrath of men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, who bore the wrath of God for him. 3. The Vanity of the Creature. He teacheth us that all things below be but vanity and vexation of spirit. 4. A fourth thing is, the sinfulness of Sin. 5. The deceitfulness of the Heart. 6. The right knowledge of himself. Oh Christians, have you learned these Lessons? Then let all the actions be Christ-like, and walk as you have Him for an Example; He lived to teach us how to live, and he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to teach us how to die: he that will nor follow the example of Christ's life, shall never he saved by the merits of his death.

<P><HI>Doct.</HI> These two points lie full in the <HI>words,</HI> but I shall only speak to the latter, to wit, that Jesus Christ, the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> is the cause and foundation of all a <HI>Believers peace.</HI> In the prosecution of it, I shall shew you four things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He is the Peace-bringer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Peace-maker.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Peace-giver.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He is the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> or the Peaceable Prince.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>First, Jesus Christ is the <HI>Peace-bringer;</HI> he brought in <HI>Everlasting Peace</HI> by Righteousness, and not by a Sword, <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.14. <HI>Peace on earth, and good will towards men.</HI> Why was the <HI>bread</HI> of <HI>life</HI> an hungry, but that he might feed the hungry with the <HI>bread of life?</HI> Why was <HI>Rest</HI> it self weary, but to give the <HI>Weary</HI> rest? Why was the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> in trouble, but that the troubled might have peace? None but the <HI>Image of God</HI> could restore us to Gods Image; none but the beloved of God could make us beloved to God; none but the natu∣ral Son could make us sons; none but the <HI>wis∣dom</HI> of God could make us wise; none but the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> could bring the <HI>God of Peace,</HI> and the <HI>Peace of God</HI> to poor <HI>Sinners:</HI> and therefore he is called our Peace, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.14.
<PB N="87" REF="001244_0047_0FB186DBA8928538"/>Oh, what is so sweet a good as Christ, &amp; what so great an evil as sin? The former brings us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o joy and peace, the latter brings us to woe and misery. That's the first.</P>
<P>Secondly, He is the <HI>Peace-maker</HI> as well as the Peace-bringer; he is the Peace-maker between God &amp; man, Sin is the great make-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te between God and the Soul, Sir is the wall of separation between God &amp; us, but the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> makes peace between God &amp; us; He paid all debts, and took up all con∣troversies, and blotted out the hand-writing, and hath broken down the partition-wall, &amp; rude up the great breach between God and man, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. <HI>God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.</HI> Mark, 'tis in Christ; so likewise elsewhere, <HI>You who were sometimes for of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e made nigh by the blood of Christ.</HI> Oh <HI>Sin∣ners,</HI> Christ is our Peace-maker, the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> makes peace between God &amp; us, he re∣concileth God to man, and man to God; so that though God might justly be displeased with us, yet in his Son, is well pleas'd with us: God is more-pleased with a Believer for Christs sake, than he was displeased with him for Sins sake.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Jesus Christ is the <HI>Peace giver;</HI> alas, <HI>poor Sinne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> we have no peace with <HI>An∣gels,</HI> no peace with <HI>Conscience,</HI> nor one with a∣nother, till the Prince of Peace gives it us: <HI>Peace I leave with you, peace I give unto you,</HI> saith nor Lord to his Disciples, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 14.27.

<P>Fourthly, He is a <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> or the Peaceable Prince; so he is stiled not only Peace, but the <HI>Prince of Peace.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Belov∣ed,</HI> he is <HI>all Peace</HI> to a Believer, <HI>her ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace,</HI> speaking of Christ, Prov. 17.

<ITEM>1. The Path of Re∣pentance.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. Of Truth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Of Self-denyal.</ITEM>

<P>These are all <HI>paths of Peace,</HI> and <HI>peaceable paths.</HI> Oh <HI>Sirs,</HI> there is no Peace to be found but in the <HI>Paths of Peace.</HI> As all his works be great &amp; marvellous, so all his way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peace and pleasantness. Secondly, His Gos∣pel is a <HI>Gospel of Peace,</HI> 'tis a great Mercy to enjoy the Gospel in Peace, but a greater Mer∣cy to enjoy the Peace of the Gospel.

<P><HI>Ʋs.</HI> Now for the Application of the point, I shall reduce it to four heads:

<ITEM>1. For <HI>Infor∣mation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="89" REF="001244_0048_0FB186DD25E90848"/>

<ITEM>4. For <HI>Consolation.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. By way of Information, here we may see what great need we stand in of Jesus Christ, O Christians, is Jesus Christ the cause &amp; foun∣dation of all our peace, then we have no right or title to peace, but by the <HI>Prince of Peace: We love peace with God,</HI> saith the Apostle, but how? <HI>through our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> we are reconciled to God in Jesus Christ. <HI>And we who were far off,</HI> such <HI>Paul, are made nigh by the blood of Christ,</HI> we are only <HI>acceptable</HI> in the <HI>Beloved.</HI> So that, beloved, 'tis all in Christ, and through Christ that we have our peace. A Christless man is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peaceless man, He hath no peace with God, to peace with Angels, no peace with Consci∣ence: till we be Christ's friends, we are our own soes. 'Tis true, a wicked man may speak peace to himself, but God speaketh not a jot of peace to him; he may speak peace to himself all he falleth into everlasting flames, God is his Enemy, the Devil is his fee. Angels hate him, all Creatures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry for vengeance upon him, in <HI>Isa</HI> 57.21. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> no peace to the wicked saith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God,</HI> no no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a word, not a dram of peace for a person who is out of Christ: therefore, Oh Sirs, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ider in what need you stand of the Prince of Peace.</P>
<P N="2">2. It informs us, that to have peace with our Creatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Maker, is the sweetest &amp; best thing in the World: Oh how infinitely sweet is peace▪ What is sweeter than peace? Alas, gold is but dust, pleasures are but toys, wit is but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, beauty but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blast, honour but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, life but a vapour, Oh, but peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
<PB N="90" REF="001244_0048_0FB186DD25E90848"/>sweeter than the sweetest, and better than the best of all those. First, Because he that hath peace with God, may come boldly to God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.16. Secondly; He that hath peace with God, hath communion and fellowship with God, 1 Joh. 1.2. <HI>Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> Thirdly, He that is at peace with God, is the Son of God. Peace is of all others the most sweet: Oh, it is wine to comfort us, and bread to nourish us; it makes a man live comfortably, and die chearfully. Thirdly, If <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> be the cause and foundati∣on of all our peace, why then, he that wants the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> wants all good things, he is the miserablest man in the world that is with∣out Christ, he wants reconciliation with God, and interest in Christ, he wants the sealing and comforting of the Spirit, he wants Justificati∣on, Sanctification and Adoption; he wants pardon of sin, and freedom from the domini∣on of sin; he wants that favour which is bet∣ter than life, that joy which is unspeakable &amp; full of glory, and that faith, a dram of which is more worth than a Kings ransom: he wants those riches which perish not, that love which dies not, that Kingdom which shakes not. O Beloved, how many things doth that poor soul want, which wanteth. Christ? <HI>He is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind and naked,</HI> Rev. 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Christ is a Pearl, and whosoever hath him can never be poor, and whosoever wants him can never be rich: did but men see all in this <HI>Pearl of Price,</HI> then they would sell all for this <HI>Pearl of Price.</HI> Fourthly, If Jesus Christ
<PB N="91" REF="001244_0049_0FB186DF9C6CD330"/>be the cause and foundation of our peace, then it is our greatest concernment to get into fa∣vour with this <HI>Prince of Peace, Many seek the Ru∣lers favour,</HI> saith the Scripture. But Oh seek ye the favour of this <HI>Prince,</HI> poor souls, without him there is no mercy, no peace, no grace, no glory, no heaven, no crown, no eternal life, <HI>For this is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, &amp; Jesus Christ whom then hast sent,</HI> Joh. 17.4.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Secondly, By way of <HI>Examination</HI> and <HI>Self-trial,</HI> the trial of our selves is the ready way to the knowledge of our selves, Oh <HI>Christians,</HI> would you see your God? then cast your eyes upward; would you see your selves? then cast your eyes inward. Contemplation is a Glass to see our God in: 'Tis of greater concernment to know the estate of our Hearts, than to know the state of the Kingdom. And therefore I beseech you examine your selves, that you may know your selves, that you may know whose you are, while you live, and whither you shall go when you die, and what will become of you to all eternity. Oh <HI>Sirs,</HI> bring your selves to the trial, and try your selves, and see whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou be in the Faith; and the faith in you; faith is such a grace, that a man cannot be saved with∣out it, and not a man can be damned that hath it. Oh see, whether you be in the narrow way that leadeth to life, or in the broad way that leadeth to death; whether your hearts be chairs for vice to sit in, or thrones for grace to rule us, whether you are one of Christ's Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, or the Devils harlot; whether you are heirs of heaven, or hell; whether you be Satans bond∣men, or God's freemen; Examination is the
<PB N="92" REF="001244_0049_0FB186DF9C6CD330"/>beaten path to perfection, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.26. <HI>Not ma∣ny wise, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</HI> 'Tis not always seen that the sparkling Dia∣mond of a great Estate, is set in the Gold-ring of a gracious Heart. A man may be great with <HI>Saul,</HI> and graceless; rich, with <HI>Dives,</HI> and mise∣rable: The richest are oftentimes the poorest, and the poorest oftentimes the richest. Oh how many thred-bare souls may there be found under silken-coats, and purple robes? they who live most downward, die most upward; a sight of our selves in grace, will certainly bring us to a sight of our selves in glory: those sins shall never make a hell for us, that be a hell to us.</P>
<P><HI>Use,</HI> But it is time for me to turn my Speech into an Exhortation, and Oh that you would encourage me with your Resolution to obey my Message this day, that is, to make you peace with the Prince of Peace, that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons of peace, and the peaceable Sons of truth, that you may be righteous bese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> God, and holy before men, that you may glo∣riously shine in glory, and that you may have peace with God, and with Angels, and with your own Conscience, and with one another. Well <HI>Sirs,</HI> what say you in answer to my Pas∣sage? shall the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> be your Love and Lord, your nearest and dearest, your joy and your delight? will you kiss the Son, will you make your peace with the <HI>God of Peace,</HI> and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up your soul; and lives to be ruled by have these things I exhort you to, and God expects them at your hands; but that this Exhortation may stay with you, I shall beak to with some pressing Considerations. First, Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ider <HI>Gods
<PB N="93" REF="001244_0050_0FB186E1CCC685E8"/>goodness</HI> and <HI>good will</HI> towards men; God hath given you rich means that you may make and secure your peace with God. First, He hath given you the Lamb, and the Gospel. Second∣ly, He hath graciously given time and oppor∣tunity. Thirdly, Mercies and Afflictions; Mercies to draw you, and Afflictions, to drive you. Fourthly, He hath given you Preachers, both inward and outward Preachers: by out∣ward Preachers, I mean the <HI>Ministers of Christ,</HI> who beseech you and intreat you for <HI>Christs</HI> sake to be reconciled to God: by inward Preachers, I mean your Conscience that judgeth you, and checketh you, and reproveth you for your sins and abominations. Fifthly, He hath given you precepts and promises; precepts commanding you to do, and promises assuring you of a glorious reward for your doing. Sixthly, The spirit and convictions, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. <HI>My spirit shall not always strive with man.</HI> Oh how long will you yet stand out against God? <HI>what have you to say against this?</HI> how can you answer this when you and I shall appear before God's <HI>Judgment-seat</HI> I have you any thing to say a∣gainst this?

Oh <HI>Sirs,</HI> go to the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> for <HI>Peace,</HI> that you may have <HI>Peace;</HI> if you do not lay your sins to your hearts, that you may be humble for them, God will lay them to your charge, that you may he damned for them. A thrid consideration is this, either you must taste of Gods goodness, or his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y; there is not a man, wo∣man or child amongst you but must partake of the one or the other, <HI>your portion will be either joy or sorrow,</HI> either <HI>desolation</HI> or <HI>consolation,</HI> if you be not trees for hearing, you must be trees for burning; if you are not for fruit you must be for flames; if you do not swim in the water∣works of repentance, you shall burn in the fire∣works of vengeance; if you will not go and make your peace with God, that you may have heaven, you shall go to hell for not making your peace; one of them you must do.

<PB N="95" REF="001244_0051_0FB186E745B10800"/>make your peace with God or no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Will you still go on in a way of wickedness, break∣ing his laws, grieving his spirit? will you die a natural death, before you live a spi∣ritual life?

Alas, alas, all the <HI>World</HI> is but as a drop of water in comparison of God, and therefore make your peace with him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we neg∣lect so great salvation.</HI> Fourthly, Consider what the damned in <HI>Hell</HI> would give for those offers of mercy that are now offered to you: certainly they would give ten thousand Worlds, if they had them, for those oppor∣tunities that you enjoy. Should God say to poor wretches that are now suffereing in hell for their drunkenness upon earth, and their whoring and abominations, as he doth to us, <HI>Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy la∣den, and I will give you rest?</HI> Oh how earnest∣ly would they run and catch the word out of Gods mouth? Oh, <HI>Beloved,</HI> the Devils
<PB N="96" REF="001244_0052_0FB186EA843AE2C0"/>are too well acquainted with misery, to pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by mercy, if it were offered to them. But alas, alas, poor damned wretches, there is no dram of mercy for them, no not so much as a drop of water for them, not one drop of water to cool their flaming tongues. Oh that you would consider this, and make your peace with God before death comes: which may be next night for ought you know: if you lose your golden season, you lose your soul. O therefore make your peace with God, that it may not be said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you as it was once to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in <HI>Luke</HI> 10.42. <HI>O that thou hadst known in this thy day, the things that concern thy peace, but now they are hid from thy eyes.</HI> Here was a weeping word, a sad word to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Alas, now it is hid from their eyes, their golden season is gone, there is no peace to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad; and therefore I beg of you, as though I were condemned, &amp; begging for my life, so I beg of you in the bowels of <HI>Christ,</HI> and for your souls sake, make your peace with God. 5. Seriously consider the multitude of Sins thou art guil∣ty of, even more than the hairs of thy head, or the sand on the Sea-shore, or the stars in the heaven, which are innumerable, saith <HI>David, They are more than the hairs of my head,</HI> Psal. 40.12. Alas, one of thy sins were e∣nough to sink thee into Hell for ever; what advantage doth <HI>Dives</HI> reap in Hell of all the delicate banquets that he had on Earth? Oh think of that time wherein you shall be a∣shamed of nothing but your wickedness, and
<PB N="97" REF="001244_0052_0FB186EA843AE2C0"/>glory in nothing but your holiness. Sin it is like a <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pent</HI> in the bosom that is stinging, or like a <HI>Thief</HI> in the closet that is stealing, or like <HI>Poison</HI> in the stomach, that is poison∣ing, or like a <HI>Sword,</HI> in the bowels that is kill∣ing: Some are in Hell already for the same sins thou livest in, and if thou livest and diest without Christ, thou shalt ere long be with them▪ therefore I say, make thy peace with God. 6. Consider that there is more bitterness following upon sins ending, than ever there was sweetness flowing from sins actings, you that see nothing but well in its commission, will suffer nothing but woe in its conclusion! It is better here to forego the pleasures of sin, than hereafter to under∣go the pain of sin; you that sin for your pro∣fit, will never profit by your sins: he that likes the works of sin to do them, will never like the wages of sin to have them; sin is both shameful &amp; damnable; it shameth men in this World, &amp; damneth them in the other World: it's like <HI>Judas</HI> that at first salutes us, but at last betrays us; or like <HI>Delia,</HI> to smile in our faces, and betray us into our enemies hands. Oh sinners, think of this, and part with your sins, that you may meet with your Saviour, and make your peace with him▪ 7. Consider the heavy judgments that hang over your heads; you lie open to all the judgments in this life, and torments in the life to come. Oh you Sinners, the day is hasting upon you, wherein you will have mi∣sery
<PB N="98" REF="001244_0053_0FB186EB65FE3240"/>without mercy, sorrows without succour, pain without ease, punishment without pity, and torment without end unless Repentance do prevent, 2 Thess. 1.7. <HI>The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angles in flaming fire▪ taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power:</HI> Oh let the hearing of this prevent the feeling of this poor Sinner. 8. And lastly. If none of the former Arguments or Considerations prevail with you to make your peace with the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> yet let this one I beseech you, and that is, the readiness and willing∣ness of God to give Christ, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ to give himself to you. Oh Sinners, is God willing to give his Son and are you not wil∣ling to receive his Son Consider the willing∣ness of God, <HI>Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him.</HI> Mark <HI>Sinners,</HI> here behold I stand; who? I, I that have Heaven to give, I that have a Crown to give, I that have all Joys to give, I that have My self to give, I stand &amp; knock, do you see this, poor Sinners, who is it that stands at the door of your hearts and knocks? Why it is the King of Saints, the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> the Mighty God, and will you not open to him? What are you un∣willing to be saved, to go to Heaven, and to
<PB N="99" REF="001244_0053_0FB186EB65FE3240"/>be happy for ever? What are you unwilling to be delivered from Satan, from fin, and from the flames of Hell? If you be willing, then make your peace with God, for God is willing to o∣pen Heaven to you, if you be but willing to open your Hearts to him; he is willing to save you, if you be but willing to be saved; he is willing to give Christ, if you be willing to receive a Christ; and therefore, poor souls, let these Considerations provoke you to go for life to the Lord of life, to go for Peace to the Prince of Peace, to go for grace to the God of Crace; were men so diligent as to do their best, God is so indulgent, He would forgive the worst.</P>

But alas, what are the Elect Angels, or Elect Saints, to the Elect Precious, and precious to the Elect. But I shall not stand upon this point, but proceed to the second.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 2. And that is this, That a crucified and glorified Christ, is very precious to all be∣lieving Saints. In handling of this precious point, I shall shew you five things.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That he is precious.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>He is most precious.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>He is all precious.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>He is always precious.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Why he is so precious.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>First, <HI>That he is precious;</HI> Jesus Christ is pre∣cious three ways, to God, to Angels, to Saints. 1. <HI>To God the Father;</HI> and this will appear by what God the Father hath said himself of his Son, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.1. <HI>My Elect in whom my soul delight∣eth:</HI> here you see Christians, what God saith of Christ; the soul of God delights in the Son of God. So again, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.17. <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</HI> Mark here, not only pleased, but well pleased. Oh how precious is Christ to God the Father! The Lord Jesus, though he was a man of sorrow, yet he was not a man of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in; he had correcti∣on, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ption; he that was a way to
<PB N="101" REF="001244_0054_0FB186ED8C48AF10"/>others, never went out of the way himself. Jesus Christ must needs be precious to the Fa∣ther, because he never displeased him in any thing, but pleased him in every thing, Joh. 8.29. Christ there speaking of himself, <HI>I do always the things that please him,</HI> said our Lord Jesus. Oh Friends, it will be your glory, your crown, your honour and happiness another day, if in this day you do the things that please God: So did Christ here, <HI>I do always the things that please him.</HI> Christ, went about doing good, he must needs please the Father, <HI>For he went about doing good▪</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s 10.38. He did not always stay in a place, <HI>but he went about doing good.</HI> And truly Sins, if people were not made better by his coming, they might thank themselves, <HI>For he went about doing good.</HI> As he was never il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣imployed he was never un-employed; as he o∣pened the Scriptures to our understandings, so he opened our understandings to the Scrip∣tures. That's the first. Secondly, He is very precious to the Angels as well as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; the Angels were very joyful at the birth of Christ their Lord: <HI>They sang praises to God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high,</HI> Luk. 13.14. See with what joy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣umph the Angels sang at the birth of Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Oh how precious is Christ to the Elect Angels! The Angels adore him. <HI>Let all the Angels of God wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> Heb. 1.6. The Lord of Hosts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worshipped by an Host of Angels: <HI>Let all the Angels of God worship him.</HI> 2 The Angels desire to pry into the Mysteries of the Gospel of Grace, as you may see, 1 <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.12. The Angles▪ th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh they are glorio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to all Eter∣nity, lock u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it as not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them to p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="102" REF="001244_0055_0FB186EE60B5CB68"/>into Christ's Mystery. Oh Sirs, the Angels are desirous to know these things which we neglect to know. 3. The Angels stand before him as Waiting-men to serve God, &amp; to serve such as are God's; when he bids them go, they go; come, and they come; do this, and they do it; they do all his commands, <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.20. Jesus Christ is the Creator of Angels, the Lord of Angels, the Prince of Angels, the Head of Angels, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.16. The Son of God is very precious to the Angels of God. Do you see, Sirs, how precious Christ is to the Angels of God; and well he may, for indeed he is the precious Jewel in the Cabinet of glory. Third∣ly, Jesus Christ is precious to the Saints, as well as to the Father and Angels, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. you have there a full Text to this purpose, <HI>Unto you therefore that believe he is precious:</HI> Mark here, <HI>unto you,</HI> what you? to you therefore which believe, he is precious: he is precious indeed to them that believe, and no wonder he is a Believer's All: now that which is his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, must needs be precious; Christ is his all, he is all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he is all that he enjoys; Christ is all that he is worth, he is all that they are; they are no such thing without him, they are nothing without him; whatever they are worth, it is he that maketh them worth it; 'tis not worth a man's while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p five, unless he live in Christ; Christ is the gain of a Believer, living or dying; so that whatever is good for a Believer, he must say for this I am beholding to Christ, saith he, <HI>At things are yours, and ye are Christ's.</HI> Now Sirs, let me give you a little more particular ac∣count of the Christians worth, an Inventory of
<PB N="103" REF="001244_0055_0FB186EE60B5CB68"/>his Estate, and all along I shall shew you, that Christ is the worth of all that. What is it that maketh a Believer so precious and so excellent? Why 'tis such things as these:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He is a liv∣ing man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He is a seeing man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He is a Person of honour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He hath a great deal of joy and hopes of more.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He is righteous and holy, and in a word, he is saved at last.</ITEM>
</LIST>
These are the things that make a Christian so excel∣lent a person, and he hath none of those but by Christ, and he hath all this alone by Christ.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> This is the excellency of a Christian, that he is a living man; there's no man on earth can in a spiritual sence be called a liv∣ing man, but a Believer; all men be dead men, but they that believe. You know 'twas said of the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> while he lived in his sin, he was dead: <HI>This my son that was dead, &amp; is now alive.</HI> When he believed, then he was alive. Now, Sirs, as it is in the things of Nature, life is the most valuable thing which we have, <HI>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life;</HI> a man will rather part with his liveli∣hood than with his life, because his life is so dear to him. Now, Beloved, if natural life be so desirable a thing, what is spiritual life, that which is Scripture is call'd <HI>the life of God?</HI> Now the Believer is the only living man, every o∣ther man is spiritually dead: but now how comes the Believer to live? by whom doth he live? why, <HI>'Tis Christ Jesus,</HI> Gal. 2.20. <HI>I am crucified with Christ, notwithstanding I live:</HI> What crucified, and yet live? Yes, Christ was cruci∣fied, and yet lives: and so did <HI>Paul</HI> in a resem∣blance and conformity to Christ, <HI>I live,</HI> says
<PB N="104" REF="001244_0056_0FB186F4CCBFB7B8"/>he, <HI>yet not I, but Christ which lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</HI> So that <HI>Paul</HI> will not call his life his own, but only as he deriveth it from Christ, Christ lived in him more than he him∣self lived.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The excellency of a Believer lies in this, That he is a seeing man: 'tis sight which puts the difference between person and person; it is a sad thing to be born blind, or to be blind after a man is born. Now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l men are either bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n blind, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded after they are born, or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Now, Beloved, would you know how precious sight is? Ask a blind man who once could see: we read of a poor man, who comes running to Christ, and cries out, <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣cy upon me;</HI> why, what mercy was it that he begged with so much earnestness? <HI>O Lord, that I may receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sight.</HI> Now Sirs, if in Nature the having the sight of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eyes be a thing that makes us so much more excellent than other∣wise we should be without it. Oh then how much value should we put upon this spiritual light which refers to our souls? We can much better want the eyes of our heads, than the eyes of our understandings. Now in a spiritual fence, there's no man a seeing man, but a Belie∣ver; no man saw Christ savingly, but they who saw him believingly; every man but a Believer walks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n darkness; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, he is darkness. The Apostle, <HI>Eph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 5.8. tells us somewhat to this purpose. <HI>You were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>metime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kness, but now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you light in the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ; you see the Believer doth see, and how he comes to see, it is in the Lord that he sees, he was as
<PB N="105" REF="001244_0056_0FB186F4CCBFB7B8"/>dark as others, and as blind as others, till he was in the Lord, and no sooner was he in the Lord, but he was light in the Lord. That's the second.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The excellency of the Believer lies in this, that he is a very beautiful and honou∣rable Person. Now, Beauty and Honour be the taking ravishing things of this-World; now all but Believers be deformed persons, there's no beauty nor comeliness, why they should be de∣sired; but now the Believer is a very lovely beautiful person, he is so in the eyes of God, Ezek. 16.13, 14 <HI>And I put a jewel on thy fore∣head, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gs in thy ears;</HI> and so he goes on and says, <HI>Thou wast exceeding beautifu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and didst prosp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> into a Kingdom:</HI> But now mark how she came by this beauty, in the next verse, <HI>And thy renown went forth among the Heathen for thy beauty, for it was perfect through the comeliness which I put upon thee, saith the Lord God;</HI> she was not only beautiful in the eyes of the Lord, but she had her beauty also from the Lord. And as they are thus lovely and taking in the eyes of God, so also of good Angels and Saints too; as glor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s a place as Heaven is, the Angels think it not below them to wait upon the Ima∣ges and Pictures of Christ here below, that is, to wait upon Believers, and be their Lord's Guardians here upon Earth, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to minister for them who should be heirs of salvation;</HI> but this is not all they do for them, they will not leave them when they die, but take those lovely souls, and transport them to a better Country than ever this World was to them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="106" REF="001244_0057_0FB186F824A02CC8"/>for it is no <HI>Paradox</HI> to say this, that there's no Believer goes to Heaven, but he goes in the arms of Angles, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. In that paraboli∣cal History of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> says the Text, <HI>Lazarus</HI> died, believing <HI>Lazarus died &amp; his soul was carried by Angels into Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aham</HI>'s <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>som, that is, to Heaven.</HI> O what an honour have Believers in their death, that the very Angles transport their Souls to Heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they also are very lovely and honourable in the eyes of all good men: the truth is, there is scarce any man fit company for Be∣lievers, but Believers; and therefore, says the Apostle, <HI>Be not unequally yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked, believers with unbelievers.</HI> Now, good men be much taken with a Believer though he be a Strang∣er to them on all other accounts: they are very fond one of another in this World, and had rather suffer together than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive with other men. Now this makes a Believer so excel∣lent, that he's thus beautiful and honourable in the eyes of God and good Angles, and good Men. Now all this beauty and hon∣our they have from Christ, see that Text be∣fore quoted, <HI>To you who believe, he is an honour,</HI> so the words may be read: 'Tis Christ that makes them honourable in the eyes of God, and in the eyes of good Angles, and good Men: and all that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auty and honour they have, 'tis through Christ, he is their Worth in every capacity.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> That which makes a Believer so excellent, is, that he hath joy; all other
<PB N="107" REF="001244_0057_0FB186F824A02CC8"/>men have no joy, but that which is not worth the having. Alas, the joy of the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> what is it, but as the crackling of Thorns under a <HI>Pot?</HI> but now a <HI>Believer</HI> hath a joy that no man intermedleth with, nor no man partakes of. But how where hath he his joy? why in &amp; from the Lord, <HI>These things I speak;</HI> says Christ, <HI>that my joy might be in you.</HI> They have it from the Lord, &amp; having it from the Lord, they rejoyce in the Lord, <HI>We rejoyce in Christ Jesus,</HI> says <HI>Paul, &amp; have no confidence in the flesh. Fifthly,</HI> Have they hope? it is from <HI>Christ,</HI> and indeed none have hope but they; for without God, &amp; without Christ, &amp; with∣out <HI>Hope,</HI> are put together, in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12. but now the Believer hath good hope, and this bears up many times. <HI>Alexander</HI> thought this so brave a thing, that when he gave this man whole <HI>Countries,</HI> and another vast <HI>Treasures,</HI> and being asked what he would keep for himself, says he▪ <HI>I will keep Hope;</HI> for he thought it enough for so brave and great a soul as his, to hope for that which would make him do whatever he was able to do, or any one could think. The hopes of Mercy; and joy, and peace, will carry a man thro' thousands of difficulties: Now, the Believer hath this hope, but he hath it from Christ, Col. 1.27. <HI>Christ in you the hope of glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Are they wise, are they righteous, are they holy? and none be so but they; every Sinner is a Fool, and therefore in <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> is called by the name of <HI>a foolish man;</HI> he plays the <HI>fool</HI> all the time he spends out
<PB N="108" REF="001244_0058_0FB186F9B0046F48"/>of the fear of God; <HI>all sinning time is fooling time.</HI> Now the Believer is a wise man, and he is a righteous man, and a holy man: but how comes it to be thus now? Take an ac∣count of it in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. Pray mark, here now Christ is all of a Believer, <HI>Of him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emp∣tion.</HI> So that you see, if a Believer be a wise man, he may thank Christ for it; if he be a righteous m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, if he be a holy man, he may thank Christ for it; for <HI>he of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> in a word, Are they saved? And indeed this is the Complement, aye, the Complement of all the rest, Are they saved? and none are saved but Believers, for, says Christ, <HI>He that believes, shall be saved; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that believes not, shall be damned.</HI> The Believer is already in the State of Salvation, as the Unbeliever is in the State of Damnation; <HI>by nature we are all children of wrath.</HI> Now, <HI>Faith in Jesus Christ</HI> is the means that God appoints to free us from being <HI>children of wrath.</HI> Now he that believes, is past this, he shall not be condemned, he shall be saved; and how comes he to be saved? <HI>'Tis by Christ,</HI> by be∣lieving in Christ. Oh, who is the Saviour, but Christ? To be in Christ is Heaven be∣low, and to be with Christ is Heaven above; but there is no being with Christ above, if we are not in Christ here below. Thus you
<PB N="109" REF="001244_0058_0FB186F9B0046F48"/>see Beloved, whatever it is that makes the Be∣liever excellent &amp; precious, it is <HI>Christ</HI> that makes him worth all that, he hath it all from Christ; <HI>Christ</HI> his all in all: Now put all this together, &amp; see if there be no great reason that Christ should be precious to Believers.</P>
<P N="3">3. As Jesus Christ is precious, so he is most precious. O Sirs, Angels are precious, Saints are precious, Friends are precious, Heaven is precious; but Christ, a Saviour is ten thousand times more precious than these; a Believer had rather have Christ without Heaven, than Heaven without Christ: <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee; and there is none upon earth which I de∣sire besides thee,</HI> Psal 73.25. Let a Believer search Heaven and Earth, yet he will find nothing comparable to God; to be like to him is our Happiness, and to draw near to him is our Ho∣liness. You will say, Beloved, Life is preci∣ous, Freedom is precious, Health is precious, Peace is precious, Food and Rayment is preci∣ous, Gold and Silver is precious, Parts &amp; Gifts are precious, Jewels and Pearls are precious, Kingdoms and Crowns are precious; indeed they are in their places, but nothing in com∣parison of Jesus Christ. Mark, Sirs, what the Apostle says, Phil. 3.8. <HI>Yea doubtless I account all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord,</HI> I account all things but loss, nay, that is not all, <HI>I count them but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that I may win Christ;</HI> What is our Life, but a Warfare? and what is the World but a Tho∣rowfare? It is only the best of Beings that can bestow the best of Blessings. O how good is a Believer's God, that doth not only shorten his Pilgrimage for him, but sweeten his Pil∣grimage

Oh, Christ is a Believer's All, and therefore he is more precious tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all; he hath all in Christ, and nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Christ; there is not such a thing as a Believe is without him: By Faith we have an Interest in Christ, we have an Interest in God, and by having an Interest in God, we have an Interest in all things; the Believer is the only blessed man, the only happy man, the only rich man, Rev. 21.7. <HI>He that overcometh sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l inherit all things.</HI> O what a glorious Inheritance are they born to, that are new born! All things are theirs, and they shall inherit all things; what can they desire more than all? All that Christ hath is theirs; his Wisdom is theirs to teach them, his Love is theirs to pity them, his Spi∣rit is theirs to comfort them, his Word is theirs to counsel them, his Mercy is theirs to save them, his Angels are theirs to guard them, his Righteousness is theirs to justifie them, his Power is theirs to protect them, and his Glory is theirs to crown them. O Sirs, Christ can∣not but be most precious to a Believer, because all his precious Comforts come from Christ. The Lord Jesus is fairer than the fairest, sweet∣er than the sweetest; nearer than the nearest, and dearer than the dearest, and richer than the richest, and better than the best, the <HI>Elect Precious</HI> is of all the most precious.

Oh ye Angels, how stand ye ama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at this! that the Lord of Heaven and Earth should become a Servant to his own Servants, Phil. 2.7. <HI>He took upon him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Servant;</HI> this must needs be wonderful to all the Angels in Heaven. But to proceed: 1. <HI>Je∣sus Christ took upon him our nature, Heb.</HI> 2.16. God could stoop no lower, than to become Man, &amp; man could be advanced no higher, than to be united with God. He that before made man a soul after the Image of God, now made himself a body after the Image of Man. For man to be like to God is a wonder, but for God to be like to man, is a great wonder. But when was it that Jesus Christ took upon him our nature? when it was in innocency, free from all Mise∣ry and Calamity? No, no, but when it was at the lowest, after the fall, when it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beggarly, when wretched, most bloody, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accursed, most sinful, most feeble; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> strength, Christ died for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>godly,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.6. Now my Brethren, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus Christ should take upon him our conditi∣on,
<PB N="125" REF="001244_0066_0FB18708C8A33E20"/>our frailty, our curse, our sin, our na∣ture, when it was thus low, thus poor, thus wretched. O this is a <HI>Wonder of Wonders,</HI> and yet this you see did Jesus Christ. Oh wonderful Redemption! must God take up∣on him our frailty? had we so far ran upon the score of <HI>Vengeance,</HI> that none could satisfie but God himself? could not he have sent his <HI>Angles</HI> or <HI>Saints,</HI> but must come himself in person? No, no, <HI>Angels nor Saints</HI> could not do it; but if Christ will save us, he himself must come and die for us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Saviour's Humility descended very low, he was born of a poor Maid of no ac∣count or reputation; was there never a great Lady or Gentlewoman in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for this great Prince of Heaven and Earth to be born of, but that he must be born of a poor des∣pised Virgin? Yea certainly, there were Gentlewomen store in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but our Lord Jesus Christ regardeth not the rich no more then the poor.</P>
<P N="2">2. He was revealed to poor <HI>Shepherds,</HI> not to <HI>Emperours</HI> and <HI>Kings,</HI> not to <HI>Rulers</HI> and great <HI>Men,</HI> not to <HI>Doctors</HI> and learned <HI>Men,</HI> not to <HI>Caesar</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> I say the Angel did not go and declare this joyful <HI>Tydings</HI> and good <HI>News</HI> to <HI>Caesar</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> but to poor <HI>Shepherds in the fields,</HI> Luke 2.8, 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was born in a Stable, <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.12. Not in a fair <HI>House</HI> or <HI>Palace,</HI> not in a <HI>Parlour</HI> or <HI>Chamber,</HI> no, but in a <HI>Stable</HI> where <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses</HI> and <HI>Beasts</HI> are fed.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="126" REF="001244_0067_0FB1870C28770240"/>
4. He was wrapt in <HI>Clouts</HI> and laid in a <HI>Manger;</HI> they were not <HI>Clouts</HI> of <HI>fine Linnen</HI> or <HI>Silk,</HI> or <HI>Cloth of Silver or Gold,</HI> nor <HI>precious Robes,</HI> but <HI>poor and mean,</HI> like to Beggars Rags. Now <HI>Beloved,</HI> put all this together, and tell me what is more wonderful than this: <HI>Oh wonderful, wonderful Redemption! Oh Humility, Humility! how great is thy riches that are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> commended to us? thou pleasest Men, delighe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Angles, and confoundest Devils, and bringest thy Creator to a Manger: Oh sweet Jesus, thou con∣queredst Death by dying.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The third <HI>Wonder</HI> in Christ's Humilia∣tion is this <HI>he became poor:</HI> that he that was so <HI>rich,</HI> became <HI>poor;</HI> that he that was <HI>Lord</HI> of all, had nothing at all; he that made Heaven and Earth, had no Habitation of his own; he that gave Crowns of Victory, of Life, of Glory, to others, had no Crown him∣self here, but a <HI>Crown of Thorns;</HI> the <HI>Foxes</HI> &amp; the <HI>Fowls</HI> had more than <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> Mat. 8.20. <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.</HI> The <HI>Foxes</HI> had holes to lay their heads in but Christ had no place to lay his head in: as he was born in another Man's house, so he was buried in another Man's <HI>Tomb. You say,</HI> says the <HI>Apostle, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, though he was rich, yet he became poor,</HI> 2 Cor. 8.9. Yet <HI>became he poor,</HI> ay, <HI>poor indeed,</HI> and <HI>so poor</HI> that he had not a <HI>penny;</HI> you will say, that man is very <HI>poor</HI> that hath not a <HI>penny.</HI> Truly such a one
<PB N="127" REF="001244_0067_0FB1870C28770240"/>was Christ, he had not a <HI>penny to pay tribute,</HI> till he had got it of a <HI>Fish,</HI> Mat. 17. And when he was to ride in pomp to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he had no Coach, no Chariot, no Horse or Beast of his own, he was fain <HI>to ride upon a∣nothers man's Ass,</HI> Mat. 21.1, 2. O ye blessed <HI>Saints,</HI> admire and wonder at this, is not he the <HI>Brightness</HI> of God, the <HI>Paridise</HI> of <HI>Angles,</HI> the <HI>Beauty</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> the <HI>Redeemer</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> the <HI>Destroyer</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Saints;</HI> &amp; that he should become so <HI>Poor</HI> for us. <HI>Oh! this is a wonder to Angles and Men!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth wonder in Christ's Humilia∣tion is this <HI>That he shed his blood six times for poor sinners;</HI> and this is a great Wonder. 1. The first time was, when he was Circumcis∣ed at eight dayes old. O what a blessed Je∣sus is this! what ready for the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> alrea∣dy? What, but eight days old and yet shed thy <HI>blood for the salvation of Mans soul?</HI> 2. The second time was, when he was in his <HI>Agony</HI> when he was in the <HI>Garden: Matthew</HI> tells us, that <HI>His soul began to be sorrowful. Sore amazed,</HI> says <HI>Mark,</HI> Mark 14. <HI>To be troubled,</HI> says <HI>John</HI> Joh. 12. <HI>Now my soul is troubled, what shall I say? save me from this hour.</HI> Trou∣bled! O Lord! what, thou that bindest up the proud <HI>Waves</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> thou that turnest the <HI>Hearts</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> as the <HI>Rivers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> thou that laidst the foundations of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and spreadest the <HI>Heavens</HI> as a <HI>Curtain,</HI> thou that guidest the <HI>Stars,</HI> and thundrest in the <HI>Clouds,</HI> thou that upholdest all things by the

O how did Christ come swimming to us in blood, &amp; have not we a tear to shed for all those Streams of his? We did eat the sour <HI>Grapes</HI> and his <HI>Teeth</HI> were set on edge; we climb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the <HI>Tree,</HI> and stole the forb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dden Fruit &amp; Christ he went up the <HI>Ladder</HI> of the Cross &amp; dyed.

<PB N="129" REF="001244_0068_0FB1870D2515C258"/>that was brighter than the Sun! He that was <HI>fairer than the Sons of men,</HI> he that is the great glistering and sparkling <HI>Diamond</HI> in the <HI>Ring of Glory,</HI> how was he bespotted and besmeared with blood! Oh <HI>ye' hard of heart, ye stubborn of heart,</HI> and indeed too stubborn are we all; if Judgment and the Hammer will not break your hearts, let Love and Mercy do it: Look unto Christ, and say. Hast thou suffered this for me, and shall not I love thee, O Lord, and serve thee, and obey thee, and honour thee? So say, and so do, and the Lord say, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>But then 4. Christ shed his blood when the <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn of prickling Thorns was put upon his head,</HI> Mat. 27. Some of the Fathers say, that he re∣ceived seventy two wounds in his head; cer∣tainly there could not but much blood come out.

<P N="5">5.

<PB N="130" REF="001244_0069_0FB1870EA675DB10"/>at this, to see your Lord and Master so far deny himself, as to take upon him the form of a Servant?

O ye blessed Saints, why do you not wonder at this wonder? to see the <HI>Beauty of Heaven,</HI> the <HI>Paradise of Angels,</HI> the <HI>Brightness of his Father's Glory,</HI> the <HI>Redeemer of men,</HI> thus to humble &amp; take upon him man's nature, for the salvation of mans soul.</P>
<P N="6">6. And lastly, Christ shed his blood when the Spear was thrust into his side, out of which presently <HI>gush<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out water and blood, Joh.</HI> 9. Some say, that the Souldier that pierced Christ with a Spear, was a blind man; but our Saviour's blood sprinkling our upon his eyes, restored him to his sight, and he became a Convert, a Preacher, and a Martyr: you will say a very strange Cure, that the Physitian should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed, and his blood should be of that vertue that we should all be saved. Physitians be usually li∣beral of other mens blood, but sparing of their own; but it was not so with our Physitian, in∣stead of the Patients bleeding in the arm, he bled in the side. Why dost thou shower down thy blood, and come swimming in thy blood? Is not a drop sufficient? <HI>One drop,</HI> saith <HI>Luther, is more worth than Heaven and Earth.</HI> Oh love without measure! Oh wonderful Redemption! that God should take up in him man's frailty, this is wonderful indeed! Is it not, enough for a King to pardon a Thief, but that the King himself should die for the Malefactor? This is beyond expression: thus did our blessed Lord,
<PB N="131" REF="001244_0069_0FB1870EA675DB10" MS="y"/>our blessed Saviour, he died that we might live, he went and suffered in his Agony, that he might <HI>stay us with flaggons, and comfort us with apples;</HI> he endured the greatest pain, that we might enjoy the sweetest pleasures. Oh how lovely, how lovely was Christ in his suf∣ferings! who would but love thee, thou <HI>King of Saints?</HI> O Christians, consider how much thy dear Lord and Saviour hath suffered and undergone for thee. O precious blood, it re∣deems us, it cleanseth us, it washeth us, it justi∣fies us, it sanctifies us, it restores us to God, &amp; brings us to Heaven. 5. Another Wonder in Christ's Humiliation is this, he suffered in his soul, Mat. 26.38. <HI>My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death,</HI> saith Christ. Oh what a word was this for a God to speak, to say, <HI>My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;</HI> for man to say so, is no great wonder; but for a God to say so, Oh this is a great wonder indeed: the sufferings of his soul was the soul of his suf∣ferings. Christ yielded his soul for our souls, his soul in our souls stead. Many of the faith∣ful Servants have suffered much in their bo∣dies, as the Martyrs that were rack'd, &amp; burnt, and sawn asunder, but they had much freedom in their souls, their souls were full of much spiritual joy and comfort: but now Jesus Christ did not only suffer in his body, but in his soul; and this is that which makes the wonder the greater, that Christ suffered in his soul, he drank the Cup of Affliction, that we might drink the Cup of Consolation; he tasted Death for us, that we might taste Life for him: Christ was forsaken, that we might never be forsaken.</P>

6. A sixth Wonder in Christ's Humiliation, is this, that Jesus Christ should suffer himself to be so much mocked: he was mocked, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>psm</HI> was by the <HI>Philistines</HI> when his eyes were put out; and truly this is a great wonder.

O Sirs, this is no small wonder, if we consider how Jesus Christ was mockt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The seventh Wonder in the Humiliation of Christ, was this, he suffered much from his Father; here's a wonder, if you talk of won∣ders. Jesus Christ did not only suffer from Jews and Gentiles, Scribes and Pharisees, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Pilate,</HI> wicked men and Devils, but he
<PB N="133" REF="001244_0070_0FB187102AC762B0"/>suffered too from his Father; and this is that which makes the wonder the greater, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him to grief. Mark, one would have thought, if God would spare any, it should have been his Son, his own Son, his beloved Son, his begotten Son, his bosom Son, and yet God spared him not a jot, <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.32. <HI>He that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</HI> Mark here, God did not spare him, but delivered him up for us. If Jesus Christ will come and take our sins upon him, God will not spare him, but let out the fulness of Justice, and Justice to be full upon him, till he hath paid the uttermost farthing of Justice. O blessed Jesus, didst thou undergo so much for our sinning, for our offending, for our rebel∣ling: O then what infinite cause have we to love thee, and obey thee, and honour thee; for the more he hath done and suffered for us, the dearer ought he to be unto us. 8. The last great wonder that I shall mention, is this, Christ foresaw all this, and yet he willingly undertook it to save mankind; Christ knew before he come from Heaven, how his Country-men the <HI>Jews</HI> would use him, and that one of his Family would be∣tray him, <HI>Job.</HI> 6.4. says the. Text, <HI>Jesus knew from the beginning who should betray him;</HI> nothing was in the womb of time that was not first in the womb of Christ, <HI>he knew it from the begin∣ning,</HI> says the Text: Now that our Lord Je∣sus Christ should foreknow all this most won∣derful misery that he endured, yet that he should come freely, willingly, and joyfully
<PB N="134" REF="001244_0071_0FB18711A2A07C98"/>from Heaven, to die and suffer by &amp; for such poor wretches as we are, here is a wonder to Angels and Men, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</HI> 10.11. <HI>Lo I come</HI> saith Christ, <HI>to do thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> O God.</HI> Lo I come, &amp; what was it he was to do why, to suffer for poor man, to redeem poor man. Do you see here. Sirs, what great love Christ bore to his people, rather than they should be in Hell, &amp; be dam∣ned, Jesus Christ would come from Heaven, and suffer and this for them, though he knew before how he should be used. O this is a great wonder, dear Christians, methinks such a Pearl should sparkle in our eyes: we sail O Glory, not in the salt Sea of our Tears, but in the Red Sea of Christ's Blood. Truly it is wonderful to think how much <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> did for us, and how little do we for him; the greater his sufferings were, the greater were our sins; the greater his pain was, the greater should be our love to him again. I shall make of this point, a Use of Information and Ex∣hortation.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. First, Is it so that a Believer's Saviour is a wonderful Saviour? then it informs us of eight things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. My first Inference is this, that Christ's sufferings were great sufferings, in what he endured from men in his body, and in what he suffered from God in his soul. Christ did not only endure pain in his body, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ny in his soul. On the Sea of Sufferings the Sea of Sorrow, the Sea of Blood, the Sea of Tears that our Blessed Saviour waded through to come and bring peace to our souls, salvation to our souls, grace and glo∣ry
<PB N="135" REF="001244_0071_0FB18711A2A07C98"/>to our souls. He suffered from God, al∣so from men his enemies, he suffered from men his friends, he suffered from Devils, he suffered in his Name, he suffered in his Mem∣bers, he suffered in his Body, he suffered in his Soul; the cause was our sins, the effect our salvation. If you look through the Chro∣nicle of his life, you shall find his whole life full of sorrow and misery: <HI>He was persecuted, he was tempted, he was repreached, he was falsly accused, he was apprehended, he was betrayed, he was crucified:</HI> what shall we say more? what can be said more? He was so full of sorrow, he took his Name from sorrow; our Lord Jesus Christ is called <HI>a man of sorrows,</HI> Isa. 53.3. <HI>A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief</HI> Now judge, <HI>Sirs,</HI> whether Christ's life was not full of sorrows; he took his Name from sorrow. O sweet Jesus, thy sufferings were great suf∣ferings: that's my first Inference.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Jesus Christ suffered by himself, but not for himself; he was alone in his sufferings, neither Angles nor Saints bore any part with Christ in his sufferings; no, he drank the bitter cup alone, <HI>He alone purged our sins,</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>He alone by himself,</HI> says the Text, <HI>purg∣ed ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sins.</HI> No, Christ had none to help to bear his heavy burden with him, he bare it himself alon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But my Beloved, though our Lord Jesus Christ suffered by himself, yet he did not suffer for himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suffered for us, he suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that which we deserved, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 5 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been our griefs and carried our sor∣rows,

The Text tells us, <HI>He was m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a curse,</HI> but it was for us: <HI>He was delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p for us,</HI> Rom. 8.23. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o spared not his own Son, but de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivered him up for us all.</HI> O <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> all these things they were for us, born for us, given for us, made a curse for us, made sin for us, delivered up for us, lived for us, died for us, and is now in Heaven interceding for us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. So that, my Brethren, all that our Lord Jesus suffered, it was not for himself, but it was for us; our blessed Saviour suffer∣ed for us, that we might not suffer. This is the second Inference.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. My third is this, That it is more for Christ to suffer any thing, than for all Men and Angles to suffer all things. Pray mark <HI>Sirs,</HI> if all the Kings and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rours in the Earth should have left their T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rones, their Crowns, their Kingdoms, their Scepters, their Glory, their Honours, and Princely Robes, and have come and took upon them a poor <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s condition, to go poorly, &amp; fare
<PB N="137" REF="001244_0072_0FB187132522B2D8"/>hardly, and die shamefully, why all this had not been so much as for Jesus Christ the Son of God to have suffered the least thing he did suffer Nay further, I say, If all the Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth, had come and suffered, and died ten thousand deaths, it had not been so much, put all together; as it was for Christ to suffer any thing; because they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Creatures, he the Creator; they are Ser∣vants, he the Master; they are Subjects, he the Prince; they are mean, he is Mighty; <HI>He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; he thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</HI> Phil. 2.6. Now I say, it would not have been half such a won∣der, if all the Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth, had come and suffered, as it was for the Son of God. Oh this is a wonder of won∣ders, his sufferings were wonderful, his humi∣lity was wonderful, his patience was wonder∣ful, his love was wonderful, greater love could none shew; he loved us so that he died for love. Now I beseech you consider this Infe∣rence, which was this, <HI>That it is more for Jesus Christ to suffer any thing, than for all M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and An∣gels to suffer all things.</HI> And indeed Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, let me tell you, I want words to express it, or set it forth; for there is both want of words, and want in words to express this matter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 My fourth Inference is this; In what a miserable case lay we, that our Lord and Savi∣our Jesus Christ must endure all this, suffer all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s hear all this, undergo all this, for poor Sinners▪ In what a miserable case lay we in, think you? Certainly the misery of man was very great, that man should need such Redem∣ption
<PB N="138" REF="001244_0073_0FB1871609E4EDB0"/>as this. Oh what a breach has Sin made between God and us, that the Son of God must come from Heaven to Earth to suffer all this? Oh Sirs, mischievous Sin, I say mischievous Sin had undone us; Sin hath robb'd every one of six Jewels, every of which Jewels were more worth than Heaven and Earth. Would you know what Jewels they be that Sin hath robb'd us of? I will tell you, and than you will sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with me, that we were in a very miserable case.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It robs us of the Image of God: wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not this a precious Jewel think you? I say, it robb'd us of the Image of God, and did draw in man the Devil's picture. Malice is the De∣vil's eye, Oppression is the Devil's hand, Blas∣phemy is the Devil's tongue, and Hypocris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is the Devil's cloven foot.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Sin robs us of our Sonship, and makes us slaves to the Devil, slaves to Sin, slaves to the World, and slaves to our selves. This is another Jewel we lost.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It robs us of our Friendship with God, and made us enemies to God, enemies to Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nemies to our Souls, and enemies to all that is good.</ITEM>

It robs us of our honour and glory, and made us vile and mise∣rable, as you may see, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.6. <HI>There w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soundness from the crown of the head to the sole of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foot.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
Now <HI>Sirs,</HI> put all this together, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> see whether or no we are not miserable, and whether we did not need a Saviour to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="139" REF="001244_0073_0FB1871609E4EDB0"/>and deliver us from this misery into which our souls were plunged. Now here is our happi∣ness Christians, in Christ we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all those Jew∣els again that were lost in the old <HI>Adam,</HI> the glo∣rious Image of God, our Sonship, our Friend∣ship, our Fellowship, our Priviledges, and our Glory &amp; Honour; we have all again by <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> O <HI>Sirs</HI> man was in a very sad condition, man had brought himself in a sad condition, our condition was a miserable condition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A fifth Inference is this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> brought life to us, but we brought death to him; a life of grace, a life of comfort, a life of glory: Christ brought glory to us, but we brought shame to him: Christ brought riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to us, but we brought poverty to him; he brought joy to us, but we brought sorrow to him, sorrow upon sorrow: we put a Crown of Thorns upon <HI>Christ</HI>'s head, <HI>Christ</HI> put the Crown of Glory upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heads. We thought the Earth too good for Christ, and would not let him live here, but put him to death; but Christ thinks not Hea∣ven too good for us; we are ashamed to own Christ before men, but Christ is not ashamed to own us before his Father, and his holy Angels. We condemn Christ, but Christ justifies us. Oh <HI>Sirs,</HI> think of your unkindness to Christ, and let the consideration of his infinite love and favour to you, draw out your affections after him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That's the fifth. 6. My sixth Inference is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, All Believers have exceeding cause to bless God for <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> God the Father gave Christ to us, to us who were not his friends but ene∣mies; to us who were not sons, but slaves; to us who were not Angels, but men; to us who
<PB N="140" REF="001244_0074_0FB18716E125D318"/>loved not God, but hated him.

Drunkards, wic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Drunk∣ards, prefer their Drunkenness before Christ; the Drunkard prefers his Pots before Christ; the Drunkard wades through a Sea of Drink to his Grave; he can sit a day or whole night in an Alehouse, and think it but a little time; but an hour in the Service of God, O how tedious is that! Oh thou Drunkard, that thou turnest off thy Cups so fast, God Almighty hath a Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> thee, but not a Cup of Sack, nor a Cup of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer, but <HI>a Cup of Wrath, which thou shalt drink to Eter∣nity; which is thou to drink scalding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Load down thy throat: he hath so much Liquor here, not only to drink to quench his thirst,</HI> but to drink to excess, till he say and do he knows not what: In Hell he shall have little enough, there is never a Ta∣vern or Alehouse there, no, there is not a drop of Water to be got all Hell over. O thou Wretch, thou shalt live in burning flames, and thy tongue shall cleave to the roof of thy mouth, and if thou wouldest give a thousand worlds for one drop of water, thou shalt not have it: and therefore, I beseech you, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay such there are, in the name of God <HI>hear &amp; fear, and do no more so wickedly.</HI> O, I would not be in thy condition for ten thousand worlds; and yet I cannot but have bowels of pity towards thee, which constrains me thus to speak, know∣ing thy condition better than thou dost thy self. O couldst thou but speak with thy fellow Drunkards that are now in Hell, O what dread∣ful Stories would they tell thee of their burn∣ings, and sufferings, and pain, and torments!
<PB N="142" REF="001244_0075_0FB1871E4C9DEF48"/>Some are in Hell already for the same sin you live in; and if you live and die without Christ, you shall be e're long with them. 3. The Swearer, the blasphemous Swearer prefers his Oaths before Christ: Many can swear by their Creator and Maker, and speak proudly, and look highly, and walk contemptuously, as if there were no God to punish, no Devil to torment. Well, let me tell thee, O thou Swearer, that now delighte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in cursing, thou shalt be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'re long sent with a Curse to a cursed place; <HI>De∣part ye cursed into everlasting flames,</HI> will Christ say to such persons. Lastly, The proud person prefers his pride before Christ: If a fine Sure of Clothes did lie on the one hand, and Christ on the other, the proud person would rather put on the Sute of Clothes than Christ. O I beseech you, <HI>Sirs,</HI> consider what a vile and abominable thing it is to prefer any thing before Christ; <HI>Consider this,</HI> says the <HI>Psalmist, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver you.</HI> O, poor wretch, consider of that <HI>Text,</HI> thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iest open to all the Judgments in this life, and to all the torments in the life to come, all ye wicked ones that prefer any thing before Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The last Inference is this; If Jesus Christ be so wonderful, O then every one that heareth of Christ, should think it to be a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st dreadful thing to miss of Christ. O Christians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Friends, consider of it; certainly that man or womans condition must needs be said indeed, that lives and dies without Jesus Christ. O poor wretch, the Devil looks but for a look f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om God to come and rend thee and tear thee in pieces, and drag thy soul to Hell.

O <HI>Sirs,</HI> I beseech you, do you think and consider with your selves what a sad thing it is to miss of Christ.

<P>Oh I beseech you, that you would consider se∣riously, consider that of all miseries this is one of the greatest miseries, to miss of Christ: we are never able to lament the loss of that poor soul that loseth Jesus Christ, all losses be wrapt up in that one loss▪ and therefore I beseech you all both good and bad, bethink with your selves what a sad condition that person is in that misseth of Christ.

Out of the dust was man formed, and unto <HI>dust shall man be returned;</HI> to think of Death, is a death to some men: but Beloved, meditate up∣on death, the meditation of Death will put Sin to death. Death to the wicked is the end of all comfort, and the beginning of all mise∣ry; but Death to the godly is the Out-let to sin and sorrow, and the In-let to peace and happiness: the Saints enjoyments shall be in∣comparable, when the Sinners torments shall be intolerable; when a Believers soul shall go out of his own bosom, it goeth into <HI>Abraham</HI> bosom; when a Believer dies, he leaves all his bad behind him, and carries his good with him; when a Sinner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, he carries his bad with him, and leaves his good behind him; the one goeth from evil to good, the other from good to evil: when a Saint leaves the World, his flesh returns to dust, and his spirit returns to rest; when a Sinner leaves the World, his body goes to Worms to be consu∣med, and his soul goes to flames to be tormen∣ted; the one goes to <HI>Abrahams bosom,</HI> the other
<PB N="147" REF="001244_0077_0FB18721A4AB92C0"/>to <HI>Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebub</HI>'s bosom: <HI>The Chaff to the fire, and the wheat to the barn.</HI> Oh for the Lord's sake meditate upon Death. When you come into the World, you do but live to die again; when you go out of the World, you do but die to live again; he that lives well, cannot die ill; he that is assured of a life that hath no and, cares not how soon this life hath an end; but he that lives without sear, shall die wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out hope: he that hath no grace in his life▪ shall have no true peace in his death. An old Sin∣ner is nearer the second death, than he is to the second birth; his body is nearer to cor∣ruption, than his soul is unto salvation: Death levelleth the highest Mountains with the low∣est Valleys; the robes of Princes, and the rags of Beggars, are both laid up together in the Wardrobe of the Grave. The reason why men so little prepare for death, is because they so little think of death; when they feel sick∣ness arresting them, then they fear death ap∣proaching: The Grave is a bed to rest in, but not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shop to trade in: when the soul in death takes its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight from its loving Mate, they shall meet no more till the General Assize. When you are putting off your Cloaths, think of the putting off your Tabernacles; be going to your Beds, as if you were going to your Graves, &amp; so close your eyes in one World, as you would open them in another World; when you are creeping between the Sheets, then think of your Winding-sheet. Remember, Christians, that God can as easily turn you into the dust, as he could take you out of the dust. To day is your living day, to morrow may be your
<PB N="148" REF="001244_0078_0FB1872348F899B0"/>dying day, the meditation of death will pre∣pare you for death. 2. <HI>Meditate</HI> upon <HI>Judg∣ment,</HI> which is most strict, <HI>We must all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ.</HI> They who will not come before his <HI>Mercy-seat,</HI> shall be forced to come before his <HI>Judgment-seat;</HI> they who will not hear his Word, shall feel his Sword; they who are graceless in this day, will be speechless in that day. Do you mind me, Sirs? At the World's end such will be at their wits end, to see the Earth flaming, the Heavens melting, the Stars falling, the Graves opening, the Judgment hastening, the Sun and Moon mourning, and Christ and his Angels coming: He that comes to raise the dead, will also come to judge the dead. O Sirs the great Day to great Sinners will be a terrible day, when they shall see Christ co∣ming in the Clouds, who hath the person of a man, but the power of God, being crown∣ed with dignity, and guarded with Angels, and inraged with Anger, and inabled with Power, to bring all Kings and Nobles, high and low, rich and poor to his Bar, and there he will judge them, not by the witness of their countenances, but by the blackness of their consciences; he that was guarded to the Cross with a band of Souldiers, shall be guarded to the Bench with a guard of An∣gels: you that make no account of his co∣ming, how do you think to give an account at his coming? For the Lord's sake meditate upon Judgment, the Meditation of Judgment Sirs, may make you Judgment-proof, they who now judge themselves in their own private
<PB N="149" REF="001244_0078_0FB1872348F899B0"/>Sessions, shall not be judged by Christ at his publick Assize. 3. <HI>Meditate</HI> upon <HI>Hell,</HI> which is most doleful. O Sirs, Heaven is a place where all is joyful; and Hell is a place where all is doleful: in the former there is nothing but happiness, and in the latter there is nothing but heaviness; <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.17. <HI>The wicked shall be turned into Hell.</HI> Mark, Sirs, <HI>The wicked shall be turned into Hell.</HI> O dreadful place, where the Devil is the Jaylor, Hell the Prison, Damnati∣on the punishment, Eternity the time, Brim∣stone the fire, men and spirits the fuel; to en∣dure this will be intolerable, to avoid it, will be impossible. This is the day of God's long-suffering, that will be the day of man's long-suffering; there they may suffer, and suffer pain without ease, and torments without end, sorrow without succour, and misery without mercy: for the Lord's sake meditate upon Hell. Oh what Hells are there in Hell! the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of God, the loss of Christ, the loss of Saints, the loss of Angels, the loss of all good, and endless, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aseless, remidiless torment must be their por∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>: O <HI>that you would but often th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou droppest into Hell, after a thousand years you will be as far from coming out, as at first entrance in; there is a way to keep a man out of Hell, but no way to get a man out of Hell. The Wheat and the Chaff they may both grow together, but they shall not both lie together▪ in Hell there shall not be a Saint amongst those that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errified, and in Hea∣ven there shall not be a Sinner amongst those that are glorified. The Sea of Damnation shall not be swee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with a drop of Compassion.
<PB N="150" REF="001244_0079_0FB1872A61A649D0"/>Will you pity a body that is going to the Block, and will you not pity a soul that is go∣ing to the Pit? What a sad Visitation is that, where the black horse of Death goeth before, and the red horse of Wrath followeth after? O that must needs be sad, when one death comes upon the neck of another. A mans con∣dition in this life may be honourable, and yet his state as to another life may be damnable. Poor <HI>Lazarus</HI> goes to Heaven, when rich <HI>Dives</HI> goes to Hell; it is better to go to Heaven poorly, than it is to go to Hell richly. O Sirs, let us go into Heaven by contemplation, that we may never go into Hell by condemnation. 4. <HI>Meditation</HI> on <HI>Heaven</HI> which is most joyful, Mat. 25.34. <HI>Come ye blessed, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</HI> Heaven is a place where all joy is enjoyed, mirth without sadness, light without darkness, sweetness without bitter∣ness, life without death, rest without labour, plenty without poverty. Oh what joy enter∣eth into a Believer, when he enters into the joy of his Master! who would not work for glory with the greatest diligence, and wait for glory with the greatest patience? Oh wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> glories are there in glory! Thrones of glory, Crowns of glory, Vessels of glory, a Weight of Glory, a Kingdom of glory; here Christ puts his Grace upon his Spouse, but there he puts his glory upon his Spouse. In Heaven the Crown is made for them, and in Heaven the Crown shall be worn by them. In this life Believers have some good things, but the rest and the best are reserved for the life to come. O Sirs, meditate upon Heaven, the meditation
<PB N="151" REF="001244_0079_0FB1872A61A649D0"/>of Heaven will make us heavenly; Heaven is not only a possession promised, but a possession purchased. When our contemplations &amp; con∣versations are in heaven, then we enjoy Hea∣ven and Earth. To be in Christ is Heaven be∣low, and to be with Christ is Heaven above: there cannot be a better being for us, than for us to be with the best of beings. <HI>To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain, Phil.</HI> 1.21. <HI>Paul</HI> was contented to stay a while out of Heaven, that he might bring other souls into Heaven; his life to them was most useful, but his death to him was most gainful: let our condition be never so great, it's a Hell without him; and let our condition be never so sad, it is a Heaven with him. <HI>I had rather be in Hell with Christ, than in heaven without Christ,</HI> saith <HI>Luther.</HI> Indeed hell it self would be heaven if God were in it, and heaven would be hell if God were from it That which makes heaven so full of joy is, that it is above all fear; and that which makes hell so full of horrour is, that it is be∣low all hope: the Vessels of grace shall swim in the Ocean of glory; here all the Earth is not enough for one man, but there one Heaven is enough for all men: a Believer should see with an eye that is purified, what he shall short∣ly see with an eye that is glorified: we may talk of the greatness of our Crowns, but we shall never know the weight of our Crowns, till they be set on our Heads. That's the se∣cond.</P>

<PB N="176" REF="001244_0092_0FB18751668B9978"/>thy heart in duty. My son, give me thy heart,</HI> Prov. 23.26. You see God calls for the heart, the heart is that field from which God expects the utmost plentiful crop of Glory. God bears a greater respect to your hearts, than he doth to your works. God looks most, where men look least. If the heart be for God, then all is for God; our affections, our wills, our desires, our time, our strength, our tears, our alms, our prayers, our estates, our bodies, our souls, for the Heart is the <HI>Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-royal</HI> that commands all the rest; the eye, the ear, the hand, the tongue, the head, the soot, the heart commands all these. Now if God, hath the heart, he hath all, if he hath not the heart, be hath none. The heart of obedience, is the obedience of the heart; as the body is at the command of the soul that rules it, so should the soul be at the command of God that gave it, 1 Cor. 6. <HI>Ye are bought with a price,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>therefore glorify God in your bodies, and in your spirits.</HI> He that is all in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, would have that which is all in all in us. The bears is the Presence-chamber, where the King of Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up his lodging. That which in most worthy in us, should be given to him that is most worthy of us. The body is but the cabinet, the soul is the jewel; that body is but the shell, the soul is the ker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>. The soul is the breath of God, the beauty of man, the wonder of Angels, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Devils. The Devil knows if there be any good treasure, 'tis in our hearts, and he would fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have the key of this <HI>cabinet,</HI> that he might <HI>rob</HI> us of our <HI>jewel.</HI> The Devil would fain have the key of the heart.

Alas, too too often we have our hearts to seek, when we come to seek God. You may keep your du∣ties to your selves, if you do not give your hearts to him. A duty that is heareless, is a du∣ty that is fruitless. You can never give God the heart of your service, if you do not give him your heart in your service. The heart should be the first that comes into duty, and the last that goes out of duty. Good words without the heart are but flattery, and good works without the heart are but hypocrisie. Beloved, for your poor souls sake, let words &amp; works go together, your tongue, and hearts go together, your lips and lives go together, your prayers and practice go together. If your du∣ties do not eat out the heart of your sins, your sins will eat out the heart of your duties. A dram of matter is better than a flood of words. A heart without words, is better than words without a heart. A little done with the heart, is better than a great deal done without the heart. Nothing takes with the heart of God, but what is done with the hearts of men. He that regards the heart without any thing, re∣gards not any thing without the Heart. That is the fourteenth.</P>

But then, in the second place, as you must be diligent in the means, so make not an Idol of the means. Take up all duties in a point of performance, and say them down in a point of dependence.

Duty can never have too much of our diligence, not too little of our confidence. A Believer doth not do good works to live, but he lives to do good works.

We own the life of our souls to the death of our Saviour. Duties they are not de∣stroyed by Christ but they must be denied for Christ.

<P N="20">XX. <HI>Set out for God at our beginning, and hold out with God until our ending.</HI> As there are none too old for Eternity, so there are none too young for Mortality; <HI>Remember thy Creator now in the days of thy Youth,</HI> Eccl. 12.1. We are all born to serve God; and better we had never been born, than not to serve him. Man is beholden to God for what he hath, but God is not beholdng to man for what he doth. 'Tis a greater glory to
<PB N="190" REF="001244_0099_0FB18764ED102DB8"/>us that we serve God, than 'tis to God that we serve him. 'Tis not he that is made happy by us, but we are made happy by him. He needs not such Servants as we are on Earth, but we need such a Master as he is in Heaven. He will be everlastingly blessed without us, but we shall be everlastingly cursed without him; of him and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever <HI>Amen, Rom.</HI> 11.36. It is sad, my Beloved, it is sad, that we should live so long in the World, and do so little good; or that we should live so little in the World, and do so much evil. O you must not think to dance with the Devil all day, and sup with Christ at night; or to go from <HI>Dalila</HI>'s lap to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bosom. If sal∣vation were easie to come by, it would be slightly set by. There is no obtaining of what is promised, but by fulfilling what is com∣manded. The neglecting of the race of holi∣ness, will be the obstructing of the price of happiness. <HI>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which none shall see God, Heb.</HI> 12.14. Belo∣ved, there are many young people in the World, who are very wicked in the World, they walk in darkness, and do the works of darkness; they are young in years, but old in sin; they are very vain in a vain World, they sit with delight, and make sit their delight. I beseech you look in Eccl. 11 9. <HI>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee, and walk in the ways of thine own heart.</HI> O this is brave indeed, if it would always last; but af∣ter the flash of Lightnings, comes the clap of Thundering; mark what follows, <HI>Bot know for
<PB N="191" REF="001244_0099_0FB18764ED102DB8"/>all these things God will bring thee to Judgment.</HI> Do but you see here, Sirs, O were it not for this <HI>But,</HI> how brave were it for wicked men! But know for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment; for all thy wantonness, for all thy pride, for all thy prophaneness &amp; pro∣digality, thou shalt be brought to Judgment. After all your present receiving, you must be brought to your future reckoning. O there∣fore let nothing be done in this World, which cannot be answered in another World. Let me beseech you, who are young men &amp; young women, <HI>To remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth:</HI> To serve God, to love God, to ho∣nour God, to obey God in your youthful days. The flower of Life is of Christ's setting, and shall it be of the Devil's plucking? will you hang the most sparkling Jewel of your young∣er years in the Devil's ear? O it is hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asting off the Devil's yokes, when we have worn them long upon our necks. O young people, if you be sick of the will not, old age will die of the cannot. If God's to day be too soon for thy repentance, thy to morrow will be too late for his acceptance. You can never come too soon to God, nor stay too long with God. He shall be happy in the end, who is holy to the end: <HI>Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee a crown of life,</HI> Rev. 2.2. O hold on, and hold our to the end. He that draws back from professi∣on, shall be kept back from salvation. He that departs in the Faith shall be saved, but he that departs from the Faith shall be damned: <HI>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>my man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him,</HI> Heb. 10.38. <HI>Be stedfast, unmoveable, always

O why is the glory of this world so much regarded, but be∣cause the glory of Heaven is so little minded! Oh what is an Earthly Kingdom in compari∣son of the Heavenly Kingdom? The Angels themselves, though they are glorious Spirits, yet they are ministring Spirits. Do not most men in the world make light of God, and Christ, and the Spirit, and Heaven, and their precious Souls? <HI>And he sent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the Wedding, and they would not come; again, he sent forth other servants saying, tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen &amp; my far∣tings are killed, and all things are ready, come in∣to the marriage. But they made light of it, and went their way, one to his farm, &amp; another to his merchandise,</HI> Mat. 22.3, 4, 5. Wretched World∣lings
<PB N="197" REF="001244_0102_0FB185E527D0A080"/>make Religion a by-business; they will hear, read, and pray, when they have nothing else to do: O that such men did but know what everlasting glory, and everlasting tor∣ments are, would they then do as they do?

Oh, for the Lords sake, my dear Brethren, let nothing be done by you in this world, but what may be <HI>answer∣ed</HI> in another world. Ill men do that in this
<PB N="198" REF="001244_0103_0FB185E66350C198"/>world, which they cannot answer in another world: Now they contemn God, blaspheme God, rebel against God, go a whoring from God, and are for persecuting the beloved of God, instead of loving the Saints, are for im∣prisoning the Saints, and more for crushing them than comforting them: instead of visi∣ting them, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fie them: and instead of affect∣ing them, are afflicting them, <HI>&amp; eat them up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they eat bread,</HI> Psal 4 4. and are willing not to suffer them to worship the true God in spirit and in truth, but are for mocking them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.36. threatning <HI>them, Act.</HI> 4 29. accusing <HI>them, Act.</HI> 24 5. slandering them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11. cursing them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5 44. beating them, <HI>Act.</HI> 5.40. impri∣soning them, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.3. banishing them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.

<P N="6">VI. Make the Word of God your Rule, &amp; the Spirit of God your Guide. <HI>To the Law and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to this word, because there is no light in them,</HI> Isa. 8.20. <HI>We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, &amp; the day-star arise in your hearts,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, &amp; is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correcti∣on for instruction in Righteousness,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>Howbeit, when the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall be∣speak; and he will shew you things to come,</HI> Joh. 16.23. The Scripture is a Rule before us, to shew us where we must go: the Spirit is a Word behind us, to enable us to go according to the Directions of that Word: The Word of God is a Compass, by which we are to di∣rect our Course; the Spirit is the great <HI>Pilot,</HI> that steers us in this Course. We have no <HI>eyes</HI> to see the Word, till the Spirit enlighten <HI>them;</HI> we have no <HI>ears</HI> to hear the Word, till the Spi∣rit open them; we have no hearts to obey the Word, till the Spirit bow &amp; encline <HI>them.</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="001244_0104_0FB185E7EBA1B938"/>By the Word of God we know the mind of the Spirit; and by the efficacy of the Spirit we feel the efficacy of the Word, The Word of God shews us the way, and the Spirit of God leads us in that way which the Word points out. The Spirit of God is able to ex∣pound the Word of God, and to make it plain to our understanding. The Holy Ghost is the Churches Interpreter; He gives the <HI>Scrip∣ture,</HI> &amp; he can reveal unto us the sence and meaning of the Scripture. The Word is Gods Counsellor, to discover the path in <HI>which</HI> we are to walk; the Spirit is the Counsel of God, that teacheth us how to walk in that path. The Word is a Crystal glass, which shews us our Duty; the Spirit gives us sight to see our Duty. If God had not put his Spi∣rit into our hearts, as well as his Word into our mouths, we should never have arrived at the fair Haven of Peace. St. <HI>Austin</HI> calls the Scriptures, <HI>the Epistle of God to the Creatures,</HI> by which we understand the very heart of God. God Almighty hath in the sacred Scriptures as it were unbowelled himself, and unfolded all his Counsel to the Creatures, as far as it is necessary to be known, for their directon &amp; guidance to everlasting life.

<P N="19">XIX. Love Christ with a love stronger than life, who loved us with a love stronger than death: <HI>Therefore do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ny Father love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

Christ's love to us was stronger than death; he died for love; he laid down his life to save our lives; he loves us as the Father loves him, <HI>Job.</HI> 15.9. <HI>As the Father hath loved me, so have I

O let our hearts be full of love and affection to Christ. Love will breed courage, and cast out fear, slavish fear before God, and carnal fear before men: God can keep us from the torments of men, but men cannot keep us from the torments of God. Whilst we stand for godliness, God hath promised to stand by us. Therefore be not a∣fraid of any one that stands in opposition to the authority of Christ. None can promise us better than Christ can: None can threaten us worse than Christ can. Can any man promise us a thing better than Heaven? Can any man threaten us with a worse than Hell? Heaven is promised to those that love him, and Hell is to be the portion of those that hate him. Oh my dear Brethren, let us love Christ with a love stronger than death: So did <HI>Paul.</HI> and the rest of the Apostles: <HI>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</HI> Rom. 8.35. <HI>Love is stronger than death; many wa∣ters cannot quench it, neither can the floods drown it,</HI> Cant. 8.6, 7.</P>

Oh the Hell of horrors and terrors, that attend those souls that have their greatest work to do when they come to die! Therefore as you would be happy in death, and everlastingly blessed after death, prepare and fit your selves for death Did Christ die for us that we might live with him, and shall not we desire to die and be with him? A Believer's dying-day is his crowning-day: <HI>And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labour, and their works do follow them,</HI> Rev. 14.13.

This Chapter, out of which my Text is taken, con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth six principal things:</P>
<P N="1">1. A lovely description of Jesus Christ; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he is described by the similitude of a lamb: <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a Lamb stood upon mount Sion,</HI> v. 1. And, <HI>behold the Lamb of God,</HI> Joh. 1.19. He is called a Lamb in a double respect.</P>
<P N="1">1. In respect of his Innocency, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. 1. In respect of his Meekness and Patience, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.32.</P>
<P N="2">2. A lively description of the Church, the Lamb's Wife, and that from <HI>Verse</HI> 1. to <HI>v.</HI> 5.</P>
<P N="3">3. A glorious description of the Churches Ministers: As the Church is in this Book cal∣led Heaven, so her Ministers are called An∣gels: <HI>And I saw another Angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel,</HI> ver. 6. <HI>And there followed another Angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,</HI> ver. 8. <HI>And the third Angel followed him, saying with a loud voice,</HI> &amp;c. ver. 9.</P>
<P N="4">4. Here is set down the Doctrine which these Angels preach and publish.</P>
<P>The first Angel published the free Grace of God in Jesus Christ openly, against all the in∣ventions of men: <HI>saying with a loud voice, Fear
<PB N="230" REF="001244_0119_0FB1860194AA7378"/>God, and give glory to him, and worship him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made heaven &amp; earth, and the sea, and the foun∣tains of water,</HI> v. 7. Namely, That men should once fear God, and worship him, &amp; give all glory to him, none to Creatures, none to I∣mages, none to Antichrist; he that worshippeth the Beast, worshippeth the Dragon and the Devil, <HI>ch.</HI> 13. The second Angel proclaim∣ed the utter ruine of <HI>Babylon,</HI> &amp; the destructi∣on thereof, over the Word, saying, <HI>Babylon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fallen, is fallen, the great city, because she hath made all nations drink of the wine of her wrath of her fornication,</HI> v 8. The third Angel doth se∣riously &amp; solemnly give warning to all those who shall yet adhere to the Beast, shewing the danger and misery of it: <HI>If any man worship the Beast, and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire &amp; brimstone in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the pre∣sence of the Lamb,</HI> ver. 19, 20.</P>
<P N="5">5. A sweet word of heavenly consolation to the Saints &amp; People of God: <HI>And I heard a voice from heaven f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying unto me, write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from hence∣forth they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them,</HI> ver. 3.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Judgment and Vengeance which shall be executed upon the Wicked: the Spirit doth set it forth by a double similitude, the one by rendring, the other by gathering, and
<PB N="231" REF="001244_0119_0FB1860194AA7378"/>that from <HI>v.</HI> 16. to the end. God will as it were rain. Hell out of Heaven upon <HI>Babylon,</HI> he hath fire and brimstone for this spiritual <HI>Sodom,</HI> judgment without mercy, and fury without compassion.</P>
<P>I shall now come to the words of my <HI>Text, Those are they which follow the Lamb whitherso∣ever he goeth.</HI> This <HI>Text</HI> is one of the golden Characters of the hundred forty &amp; four thou∣sand, which stood with the Lamb upon Mount <HI>Sion.</HI> In these words are three things:

I shall gather this Observation from the words: <HI>That it is the sweet temper &amp; frame of Souls truly gracious, to follow the Lamb whi∣thersoever he goeth.</HI></P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. To follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, is to follow him in four things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In his Commandments: <HI>If you love me, keep my Commandments,</HI> Joh. 14.15. <HI>Ye are my friends, if you do whatsoever I command you,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 15.14. <HI>Blessed are they that do his command∣ments, that they may have right to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee of life,</HI> Rev. 22.4. Oh Beloved, we cannot follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes, unless we
<PB N="232" REF="001244_0120_0FB18602F0B540E8"/>follow him in his commands; <Q>Then shall not be ashamed, (saith <HI>David</HI>) when I have respect to all thy Commandments, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 6.</Q> Christians should take as much delight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those Precepts that enjoyn Holiness, as in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Promises that assure Happiness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In his Teachings: <Q>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Joh. 10.27. A stranger they will not follow, but will see from him, for they know not the voice of strangers, <HI>v.</HI> 5.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In his Providences; through all afflicti∣ons, all straits, all discouragements and sor∣rows whatsoever, tho' it be a way of blood. We must forsake all to follow a cruci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Christ, a condemned Christ, in bloody paths of sufferings, if he call us to it: <Q>Yea th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I walk thro' the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me, <HI>Psal.</HI> 23.4. For (faith <HI>Paul</HI>) I am ready, not to be bound only, but also to die at Jeru∣salem for the Name of the Lord Jesus.</Q> We must be willing to venture the loss of all for him; Liberty, Estate, Relations, and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it self: <HI>We have forsaken all, and followed thee, Mat.</HI> 16.27.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. In his Example, <Q>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.5. That, Because Christ hath suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</Q> So that to follow Christ's steps, is to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an example: we must walk in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit, in the same steps, and in the same
<PB N="233" REF="001244_0120_0FB18602F0B540E8"/>obedience: we must not follow wicked mens examples, <HI>Who walk in the broad way that leads to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th and are of their father the Devil, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they do,</HI> Joh. 8.11. But we must follow our head Christ, who went up and down doing good, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. Now this is to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. In his Com∣mands. In his Teachings. In his Providences. In his Example.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. To follow the Lamb whithersoever be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth, is to follow him truly, without Hypo∣crisie; and constantly, without Apostacy.</P>
<P N="1">1. Truly, without Hypocrisie. Many fol∣low the Lord, as Beggars follow a man, only for an Alms: they price the wages of Religi∣on, above the work of Religion: <Q>You seek me not because of the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled, Joh. 6.16.</Q> Oh Beloved, God abhors an Hypo∣crite more than a Sodomite; And Hell is pro∣vided on purpose for Hypocrites, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.51. My Beloved, following the Lamb fully, is to have the heart fixed and resolved for God: <Q>My soul follows hard after thee, saith <HI>David,</HI> Psa. 63.8. And, as the hart panteth after the wa∣ter-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</Q> All the faculties of his soul are work∣ing after God. <Q>My soul, and all that is with∣me praise the Lord, saith holy <HI>David.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Constantly, without Apostacy. A true Believer, after he begins to follow the Lamb, he never leaves following him, but followeth him whithersoever he goeth: <Q>Who shall se∣parate us from the love of Christ? Shall tri∣bulation, or distress, or persecution, or samine,
<PB N="234" REF="001244_0121_0FB186060117EC28"/>or nakedness, or peril, or sword? For I am perswaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Power nor things present, nor things to come, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heighth, nor depth, nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</Q> O Belov∣ed, he doth not follow the Lamb whithersoe∣ver be goeth, that follows the Lamb earnestly for a while, but afterward forsaketh him when a storm riseth: <Q>Yet hath he not root in him∣self, but dureth for a while; for when tribu∣lation or persecution ariseth because of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> word, by and by he is offended, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</Q> Nor he that follows the Lamb in some things and the Beast in other things: <Q>They fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Lord, and served their own gods after the manner of the nations.</Q> Nor he that follow∣eth the Lord in a dull heavy manner, &amp; a luke∣warm temper: <Q>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cold or hot, <HI>ch.</HI> 3.15.

Now this is to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Now I shall shew you why Believers follow the Lamb.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because they are redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, <HI>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by traditions from your fathers; but with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.

Oh how unspeakable is the glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven; Oh how infinitely glorious is the Lamb: Now true Believers follow the <HI>Lamb</HI> whithersoever he goeth, because they shall be for ever with the Lamb in fulness of glo∣ry, and endless felicity, <HI>Ro.</HI> 8.17. Thus have I shewed you why Believers follow the <HI>Lamb.</HI> Now I shall shew you the Excellencies of following the Lamb.

Jesus Christ that lies in the bosom of his Father, he unbosoms, and unbowels the heart of the Father to Believers; they know his Secrets, his Mind, his Counsel, and his Will, and none knoweth it but them; <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes,</HI> Mat. 11.25. But they that walk with God, know much of the mind of God, and the Mysteries of the Gospel. The third Excellency of following the Lamb is, They that follow the Lamb may come boldly to the Lamb's <HI>Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need,</HI> Heb. 6.14.

<P>The fifth Excellency is, They that follow the Lamb shall share with the Lamb.</P>
<P N="1">1. In his Divine Nature. <Q>Whereby are gi∣ven unto us exceeding great &amp; precious promi∣ses, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption

<P N="2">2. In his Conquests. The poor Saints share with Christ in all his noble and honourable Con∣quests (1 Cor. 15.55.) over the World, Death, &amp; Hell, and over Sufferings: <HI>In all these things we are more than conquerers, through him that loved as,</HI> Rom. 8.37.</P>
<P N="3">3. They share with Christ in his Graces <HI>Of his fulness have we all received grace for grace</HI> John 1.16. As a child receives member for member; as the Paper from the Press receives letter for letter; as the Wax from the Seal receives print for print; or as the Glass from the Image re∣ceives face for face; so do Believers receive from Christ grace for grace, that is, for every grace that is in the Lamb, there is the same grace in us in some measure.</P>
<P N="4">4. Believers share with Christ in his glorious <HI>Titles.</HI> He is called a <HI>Son,</HI> so are they; a <HI>King,</HI> so are they; a <HI>Priest,</HI> so are they; an <HI>Heir,</HI> so are they, <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> 8.17. <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.10. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.5, 6.</P>

My sheep hear my voice, and they fol∣low me, and I gave unto them eternal life, <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.28.</Q> The Saints have the same glory which Christ himself hath; the Saints in Heaven are not only glorified with Christ (which is a great

The Head and Mem∣bers are glorifi'd together with the same kind of glory: God hath not one Heaven for his Son and another for his Saints, but one and the same for both. Believers shall be as truly glorious as Christ is, and eternally glorious as he is. <Q>Our vile bodies shall be fashioned like unto his glorious body, and we shall be glorified toge∣ther with him, and appear with him in glory, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.</Q> Oh here is the excellency of fol∣lowing the Lamb; they that follow him, share with him.</P>
<P>The sixth Excellency of following the Lamb is, They that follow the Lamb, shall be prote∣cted by the Lamb: <Q>He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, <HI>Ps.</HI> 105.14, 15. <HI>which are his Saints.</HI> Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? And if ye suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their terrour, nei∣ther be troubled, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.13.</Q> <Q>Fear them not, for I am with thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy God: yea, I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of <HI>my</HI> righteousness, <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.10. Can a <HI>woman</HI> forget her sucking child, that she <HI>should not</HI> have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee, <HI>Isa.</HI> 40.15.</Q> Who can harm a man, if God be with him and for him? He that hath the love of God, needs not care for the anger of men▪ A true
<PB N="251" REF="001244_0129_0FB18615D25E8F78"/>Believer hath the love of God, the love of Christ, the love of good Angels, the love of good men, and the love of all whose love is worth the having. God protects men in his way, but not out of his way; when men ap∣pear for God, God appears for men; he is good to them in affliction, and he doth them good by affliction.</P>
<P>The seventh Excellency is, They that follow the Lamb, shall not feel the wrath of the <HI>Lamb:</HI><Q><HI>Rev.</HI> 2.11.

<P>The eighth Excellency is, They that follow the Lamb shall reign with the Lamb: and this is another Excellency of following the Lamb. True Believers do reign now over the Crea∣tures, over the pomp and pride of the World▪ and over sin &amp; sufferings▪ but besides all this, they shall reign with Christ, and over those that have persecuted them: <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.10. <HI>And we shall reign on the earth:</HI> ch. 20.4. <HI>And they lived and reign a with Christ a thousand years.</HI> And as the wicked tread down the Saints under their feet now, so shall the Saints then tread down the wicked under their feet, <HI>Mal.</HI> 4.3.

<P>The ninth Excellency is, They that follow
<PB N="253" REF="001244_0130_0FB1861741017628"/>the Lamb, shall sit upon the Throne with the Lamb, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20, 21. <Q>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> Mat 19.28.</Q> Oh what an honour is this! what a glory is this! to sit upon the Throne with Christ! Is it not honour &amp; glory enough for us to be in Heaven with God, and Christ, &amp; Angels, but we must sit upon a Throne there? Oh what an honour is this! &amp; yet this honour shall all the <HI>Lamb's</HI> followers have.</P>
<P>The tenth Excellency of following the <HI>Lamb</HI> is. They that follow the <HI>Lamb,</HI> shall judge the World with the <HI>Lamb.</HI> If you consult sacred Records, you shall find that both God &amp; Christ, and the Saints are said to judge the World: The Ordination is God's, the Execution is Christ's, the Approbation is the Saints. When the Apostle would stop the sinful suits among the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Brethren, that did not want men of Eminency to put a period unto Controver∣sies, saith, <Q>Do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the World? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matter? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2. <HI>Enoch</HI> the seventh from <HI>Adam,</HI> prophesied, saying, Behold the <HI>Lord</HI> cometh with ten thousand of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all, <HI>Jude</HI> 14, 15. When the Son of man shall sit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in the throne of glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <HI>Israel. Mat.</HI> 19 28.</Q> Now the wicked may judge the Saints, but then the Saints shall judge the Wicked: now
<PB N="254" REF="001244_0131_0FB18618A17CF3C8"/>they may judge and condemn Christ in his Members, but then they shall be judged and condemned by Christ and his Members: For as the Wicked cannot endure God himself, so neither can they endure God in the Saints; and the more God dwells in the Saints, the more the wicked World afflicts the Saints: but they that follow the <HI>Lamb</HI> whithersoever he goeth, shall then sit upon those that now sit upon them. Thus have I shewed you the Excellency of following the <HI>Lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Misery of those that follow not the <HI>Lamb,</HI> but the <HI>Beast:</HI> O their Misery is great in this life, but it will be greater in the other!</P>
<P>The first Misery of them that follow the Beast is, They that follow him shall share with him in all his Plagues: <Q>And the third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the Beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or on his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of God which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation, &amp; he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the <HI>Lamb, Rev.</HI> 14 9, 10.</Q> O the plagues, the terrible plagues that shall fall up∣on the Beast! <HI>Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and Fire,</HI> chap. 18.8. The judgments shall come upon all parties, and upon all degrees and con∣ditions of men that joyn with the Beast: All those that do partake of his sins, shall share of his plagues. So that all that worship the Beast, and receive his mark, and belong to him, (<HI>viz.</HI> those that live profane lives) whether they be
<PB N="255" REF="001244_0131_0FB18618A17CF3C8"/>high or low, rich or poor, if they do not come off from him, they shall share with him in all his plagues: <HI>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues, Rev.</HI> 18.4.</P>
<P>The second Misery of them that follow the Beast is, They shall cry to the Rocks and to the Mountains of the Earth: <Q>And the great men, and rich men, and the chief captains, &amp; the mighty men, and every bond-man, and e∣very free-man, hid themselves in the dens, &amp; in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the <HI>Lamb;</HI> for the great day of wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand? <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.15, 16, 17.</Q> The wicked, tho' here cloathed in Silk and Velvet, shall wish for the Mountains to cover them, which would be but a poor shelter: <HI>For the mountains melt at the presence of the Lord, and the rocks rend asunder when be is angry.</HI> They that made others flie away from them, as innocent <HI>Lambs</HI> from devouring Wolves, shall be afraid of the wrath of the <HI>Lamb</HI> that sitteth on the Throne. Oh how will any of those dare to appear before his Tribu∣nal, that have stained the Sword of Authority with the blood of Innocency, by turning its back against the Vicious, and whetting its edge against the Righteous: Every unjust Judge, that has sit confidently upon the Bench, shall then stand trembling at the Bar: Oh how will they be able to lift up their heads before <HI>Christ,</HI> who have lifted up their heads against Christ? <HI>The Kings of the earth stood up, and the Rulers were
<PB N="256" REF="001244_0132_0FB1861AC064E420"/>gathered together against the Lord, and against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, Acts</HI> 24.26. <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.14 Instead of help∣ing the Lord against the mighty, they help the mighty against the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.2.

But the great God, against whom they sin, is greater than the greatest; <Q>Before whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all the nations of the world are but as a drop of a bucket, and as the small dust of the ballance, <HI>Isa.</HI> 40.15. Who will not fear thee, O King of Nations, forasmuch as there is now like unto thee, O Lord? Thou art great, and thy Name is great, and thy power is great, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.6.</Q> He toucheth the Mountains, and they smoak, before whom the Devils fear and trem∣ble. Therefore, woe, woe, be to them that forsake him, and follow the Beast; they shall cry and call for help, but there will be none to help them.</P>
<P>The third Misery of those that follow the Beast is, They shall be cast into a lake of fire with the Beast: <Q>And the Beast was taken, and with him the false Prophet, that wrought mi∣racles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the Beast, and them that worshipped his image, these
<PB N="257" REF="001244_0132_0FB1861AC064E420"/>both were cast alive into a lake of fire burn∣ing with brimstone, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.20. The Lord Je∣sus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking venge∣ance on them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presene of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1 7, 8, 9.</Q> Oh what a dreadful thing is it, to lie under the wrath of God, to lie in burning flames, and for ever to be banished from the presence of God, and his holy Angels! This will be the portion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east's followers. O will they not wish then they had never been born? and that they might be turned into stocks and stones? but alas, all their wishes will do them no good? Christ will say to them then, <HI>Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. 25.41, 42, 43. O ye Rulers and Great Ones of the Earth, it will be no dishonour to your Ho∣nours, to lay your Honours at his feet, in <HI>whose</HI> presence the Angels vail their faces; and be∣fore whose Throne the Elders cast their Crowns, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6. <HI>Rev.</HI> 4.10. O is it not better then with pa∣tience to suffer with <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> a while, rather than joyn with the wicked, &amp; be ruined with them in the end? Rev. 14.10. <HI>Here is the patience of Saints.</HI> Ye shall suffer a while, and be trodden down by them: and you must stay for the full accomplishment of this promise for your deli∣verance: <HI>But I will surely come, and will recompeno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all your patience:</HI> And therefore be not discoura∣ged and faint in your minds, let not your hearts turn back again unto <HI>Agypt.</HI></P>

5. I shall shew you now how the Lamb's fol∣lowers may be known from the Beasts followers.</P>
<P N="1">1. You may know them by their number; they are in number the fewest, <HI>Many are, called, but few are chosen,</HI> Mat. 20.16. <HI>Though all Isracl be as the sand of the sea, yet but a remnant shall be</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ved, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.27. And Christ calls his flock, <HI>a little flock,</HI> Luk. 12.32. And truly Beloved, they are but few that follow the Lamb, and believe in him. Believers, though their natures are the sweetest, yet their number is the smallest: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven are the best, but in Hell are the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> O dear Christians, there are but few upright Christians; there are many Thorns, but few Lillies.

<P N="2">2. By their Characters you may know them. You have nine lovely Characters of them in this fourteenth Chapter.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They stand with the Lamb upon Mount <HI>Sion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They have their Father's Name writ∣ten in their foreheads.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They sing a new Song, which none can learn, but only the hun∣dred and forty and four thousand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They are such as are redeemed from the Earth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They are Virgin-Saints, not defiled with women.</ITEM>

<ITEM>7. They are redeemed from amongst men.</ITEM>

<P N="3">3. By their Spirit; they have another spirit, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.24. All the Lamb's followers are in the spirit of the Lamb, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 9.16. And by that spirit they are led and taught; a spirit of holi∣ness; a spirit of meekness, a spirit of love, a free spirit, and a true-humble and faithful spirit too, and for the Lord. Now as the Lamb's follow∣ers are in the spirit of the Lamb, so the Beast's followers are in the spirit of the Beast, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other than the spirit of the Devil, Eph. 2.2. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ding to the Prince of the power of the air (the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that now worketh in the children of disobedi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a spirit of lording and domineering, a spirit of cunning and craftiness, a spirit of de∣ceit, a spirit of superstition, a spirit of persecu∣tion and cruelty; and in this spirit are all the Followers of the Beast.

<P N="9">9.

<ITEM>1. The <HI>Barrs:</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Voices:</HI></ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I shall shew you what the <HI>Barrs</HI> are that bolt the doors of Sinners hearts against <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Beloved,</HI> they are six:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Barr of Ig∣norance:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Barr of Unbelief:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Bar of Self-conceitedness:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Barr of Earthly-mindedness:</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Barr of Preju∣dice:</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Barr of Hardness of Heart.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These <HI>(my Beloved)</HI> are the cursed Barrs
<PB N="277" REF="001244_0142_0FB1862AACCC8D38"/>which barr God and Christ, and the holy Spi∣rit out of the Heart.</P>
<P>I shall begin first with the <HI>Barr of Ignorance,</HI> and in that I shall shew you these <HI>three things:</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What <HI>Ignorance</HI> is:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What <HI>Sinners</HI> are ignorant of:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>mischievousness</HI> of this <HI>Sin of Ignorance.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And first, What Ignorance is: Ignorance is the want of knowledge, or darkness of the un∣derstanding; for so saith the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Eph. 4.18. <HI>Having the understanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, thro' the ig∣norance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.</HI> Here you may see what Igno∣rance is; the Apostle calls it darkness and blindness: So likewise in 2 Cor. 3.4. <HI>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them, which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</HI> So that Ignorance is darkness of mind, blindness of heart, and want of knowledge and spiritual understand∣ing in the Soul.</P>
<P>Secondly, What are Sinners ignorant of?</P>
<P><HI>Answer</HI> 1. They are ignorant of God, they are ignorant of Christ, they are ignorant of the Spirit, they are ignorant of the Word, they are ignorant of their own Misery, they are ignorant of the necessity of a Change, of being born again, of being new <HI>Creatures,</HI> of being converted and turned from darkness to light, from death to life, and from the power
<PB N="278" REF="001244_0143_0FB1862C2575D800"/>of Satan to the living God; such things as these, I say, they are ignorant of; and this is that which keeps poor souls from going to Christ. O Beloved! we have many of those a∣mongst us, who are thus ignorant. It was said of the Priests the Sons of <HI>Eli,</HI> that they were Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> and knew not the Lord, 1 <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> 2.8. So in the Prophesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Jeremiah, chap.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. It is said, the Priests said not, where is the Lord? and they that handle the Law, know me not. So the Pharisees were blind leaders of the blind, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.14. Would to God there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such amongst us this day: May not that charge be drawn up against us now, as was against <HI>Is∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>el? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>os.</HI> 4.1. Because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land; by swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood; therefore the land mourneth, and my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children: they eat up the sins of my people, and set their hearts on their iniquity. Thus men err, not knowing the Scriptures, <HI>nor the power of God,</HI> Mat. 22.29.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Mischievousness of this Sin of Ignorance.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Ignorance is that which keeps men from knowing of God:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Ignorance is that which keeps men from pleasing God:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Ignorance is that which keeps men from coming to God:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Ignorance hinders men from having a pro∣priety in God:</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Ignorance is that which har∣dens
<PB N="279" REF="001244_0143_0FB1862C2575D800"/>the heart against God.</ITEM>
</LIST>
O cursed &amp; mis∣chievous Ignorance! What sin like unto this? This is that which darkens, which hardens, which blinds and barrs the door of Sinners hearts against Christ. O that thou hadst known (saith our dear Lord) the things that belong to thy peace, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19 42. But because they are a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them, will have no mercy on them: &amp; he that formed them, will shew them no fa∣vour, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.11. Thus (my Beloved) I have shewed you what a wretched and miserable state such are in, that are thus ignorant.</P>
<P>Secondly, The second Bar is Unbelief, which bars and bolts Christ out of the Heart: this is that which makes men.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they give no credit to the report of the Gospel. 2. Neither do they yield that lo∣ving and loyal subjection to Christ as their Lord, where Unbelief is. Where Unbelief is, it keeps off the heart from confidently depe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing upon Christ: for that which is to be ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in him, and so keeps Christ out of our souls; it is that which clips the wings of his mercy, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> it is that which holds the hand of his pow∣er, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.18. And he did not many mighty works there, because of their Unbelief. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that which lets the soul into perdition, <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 24. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.7. The Unbelieving shall have their portion in the Lake of fire, which is the <HI>Seco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Death.</HI> Unbelief is that which hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart, and causes it to depart from God, <HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.12. Take heed, Brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily,
<PB N="280" REF="001244_0144_0FB1862E82617770"/>while it is called to day, lest any of you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hardened. O Beloved! Unbelief is that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which gives God the lie: he that believeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, hath made him a lyar, because he belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣eth not the <HI>record that God gave of his Son,</HI> 1 <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> 5.10. They believe not his promises, fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his threatnings, nor hearken to the voice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word; though he sets life and death befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them, Heaven and Hell, bitter and sweet, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they go on in the imagination of their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to add sin to sin, putting the evil day far away, but draw Iniquity with cords of Vanity and Sin, (as it were) with a Cart-rope. O Belo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed, this is the state and condition of Unbeliev∣ers, and this is one of the Bars that bolts Christ out of the Heart; as all Believers are in a stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Salvation, so all Unbelievers are in a state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Damnation; for <HI>be that believeth not is e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d already,</HI> Joh. 3 18.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The third Bar is Self-conceited∣ness, which bars and bolts the Lord Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out of the Heart.</P>
<P N="1">1. A self-conceited Man is one which suppo∣ses himself to be what he is not, Gal. 6.3. <HI>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man think himself to be something when he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣thing, he deceiveth himself.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A self-conceited man is one that glorieth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his works and despiseth others, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.9, 10. And he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves, that they were righte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and despised others. The <HI>Pharisee</HI> stood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prayed thus with himself: <HI>God, I thank <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Adulterers, or ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n as this Publican.</HI> But the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,</HI> whom he despised, went away rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣stified:
<PB N="281" REF="001244_0144_0FB1862E82617770"/>for <HI>every ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that exalteth himself shall be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A self-conceited man is the farthest from Heaven of any man: <HI>Verily I say unto you, that Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of Heaven before you,</HI> saith our Saviour to the self-conceited <HI>Pharisees,</HI> Mat. 21.31,</P>
<P N="4">4. A self-conceited man is one that liveth the most securest in a stare of sin and misery. And it shall come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he shall bless himself in his heart, saying: <HI>I shall have peace, though I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>k in the imagination of my heart, to add drun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ness to thirst,</HI> Deut. 29.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. A self-conceited man is the hardest to be wrought upon, and convinced of the state and condition that he is in, of any man; because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thinks himself righteous and holy enough, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good and sound enough. Thus it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scribes and Pharisees, who had such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thoughts of themselves, that they thought themselves to be the most holy persons in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world: Mark what Christ saith to them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9.12. The whole need not a <HI>Physician,</HI> but they that are sick; <HI>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance:</HI> So also it is said, <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.48. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> any of the Rulers or of the Pharis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him?</HI> Note, these were very hard to be con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and brought to own the truth.</P>
<P N="6">6. A self-conceited man is one that thinks that God is made up of nothing but Mercy, &amp; therefore he lives in his sins, and pleaseth him∣self with this, that God is merciful, he lying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill in the Ditch of sin, and crying, <HI>God help,</HI> but never endeavoureth to come out; but tho'
<PB N="282" REF="001244_0145_0FB18630A7D60B38"/>the Lord waiteth to be gracious, yet the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is a God of Judgment, <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.18. O! this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sad and miserable condition of a self-conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> man: This is that which keeps him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣sing with Christ: this is that cursed Bar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bolts the Doors of Sinners hearts against Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></P>

<P N="2">2. The second thing which is here to be explained, is, What this Voice is which s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ners are to hear: It is the Voice of Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is speaking to poor sinners to open the do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their hearts, that he may come in and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with them. There are two sorts of Voices by which Christ speaketh to the Soul; Inward Voices, and Outward Voices.</P>
<P N="1">1. Inward Voices.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Voice of Conscience. The Lord Jesus speaks to sinners by their <HI>Consciences;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is said of the Jews, <HI>Job.</HI> 8.9. They were con∣victed by their own Consciences: So <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.1. <HI>My Conscience beareth me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost.</HI> And of the <HI>Gentiles, Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 15. <HI>That they did by nature the things contain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Law, their Consciences also bearing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> witness:</HI> and as <HI>Paul</HI> saith, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Joycing is this, the testimony of a good Conscien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> O Friends, God preach'd to you many ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by your Consciences. which speaketh to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> secretly and powerfully, condemning and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proving you for your Iniquities: O there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> hear the Voice of Conscience for it is the Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>

<P N="2">2. Christ speaks to us by the Voice of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> as he did to the old World; <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. <HI>My spirit shall not always strive with man;</HI> and as he did to the <HI>Jews, Act.</HI> 7.51. <HI>Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did so do ye:</HI> So in <HI>John</HI> 16.8. Christ tells us, <HI>that the Spirit should convince the world of sin, of righteousness, &amp; of judgment.</HI> O! the ever blessed God speaks to the World by his blessed Spirit, striving with them, convincing of them, &amp; reproving <HI>them</HI> for their Iniquities, that their souls may <HI>believe in him,</HI> &amp; live with him to Eternity. 2. There are outward Voices, by which Christ speaks to Sinners.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the <HI>Voice of his Word,</HI> which is the Preaching of the Gospel, that is, the Word of Reconcilation: O Sinner, when thou hearest the Word read, thou hearest the Voice of Christ, Col. 1.5. <HI>Whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</HI> as Christ saith; Joh. 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for they are they that test <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of me.</HI> The Voice of the Scriptures is the Voice of Christ; and as Christ speaks to us by them here, so he will judge us by them hereafter, Rom. 2.16. <HI>God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus, according to my g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣pel,</HI> Joh. 12.48. Where Christ saith, <HI>The word that I have sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Christ speaks to Sinners by the Voice of his Rod, by Afflictions and Tribulations, &amp;
<PB N="290" REF="001244_0149_0FB18637F99C8CE8"/>Judgments, Mic. 6.9. <HI>The Lord's voice cryeth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thy Name; hear ye the rod, and who hath ap∣pointed it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Christ speaks to Sinners by the Voice of his servants, as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 50.10. <HI>Who is there a∣mong you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servants?</HI> So in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. <HI>New then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God:</HI> So in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. <HI>He that heareth you, heareth me.</HI> O Sinners! Christ speaks to you by the Voice of his Servants, by his Ministers and Members, who beseech you, &amp; intreat you to be reconciled, that you may have peace with God through Jesus Christ. Having thus briefly shewed you what the Voices are,</P>
<P N="3">3. I shall in the Third, place come to shew you what the Door is that Christ stands and knocks at, which Sinners are to open, and let him in.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first door which Sinners should o∣pen unto Christ, is the door of their Thoughts: I say, we must open the door of our thoughts to him, that God may be in our thoughts &amp; Christ in our thoughts, and the Spirit of Life and Power in our thoughts, and Eternity in our thoughts, Heaven and Judgment in our thoughts: <HI>Keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of thy heart,</HI> 1 Chron. 29.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>How precious also are thy thoughts unto mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> O God How great is the sum of them,</HI> Psal. 129.17.
<PB N="291" REF="001244_0149_0FB18637F99C8CE8"/><HI>the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy com∣forts delight my soul,</HI> Psal. 94.19. O! this is the first Door of our Hearts, which Believers open to their beloved Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second is the Door of Considera∣tion, which Sinners should open to Christ: O that they were wise, and understood this, <HI>That they would consider their latter end, Deut.</HI> 32. 29. <HI>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib, but Israel doth not know; my people doth not consider,</HI> Isa. 3.1. <HI>The tabret, and pipe, and harp, and wine are in their feasts, but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of his hands,</HI> Isa. 5.12. But now those that have opened this Door to Christ, they consider their ways: <HI>The upright consi∣dereth his ways,</HI> Prov. 21.29. <HI>and the wondrous works of God,</HI> Job 37.14. <HI>and what great things God hath done for him,</HI> 1 Sam. 1.2.24. <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your ways.</HI> Hag. 1.5. And this is the second Door of the Heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Door is the Door of Affection, which Sinners should open to Christ: <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,</HI> Deut. 6.5. <HI>If any man love not the Lord Jesus, let hin be</HI> Anathema, Maranaths, <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.22, <HI>Grace be with all them that love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lord Jesus Christ in truth and sincerity,</HI> Eph. 6. 24. <HI>Set your effections on things above, and now on things beneath,</HI> Col. 3.1. This door of Love &amp; Affection must be opened to Christ, that he may come in to your hearts, and be your
<PB N="292" REF="001244_0150_0FB18638E8CB5430"/>nearest and dearest, your joy and delight, that you may have reconcilation with the Father, union with the Son and communion with the Holy Ghost: And this is the third Door of the Heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth is the Door of Desire, which must be opened to Christ, or else he cannot come into our hearts, and sup with us: O sin∣ners, you must desire and thirst after Christ vehemently, and say as the Church doth, in the last of <HI>Canticles,</HI> ult. <Q>Make hast, my be∣loved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart upon the mountains of Spices: So in <HI>Rov.</HI> 22.20.

<P><HI>Use</HI> 1.

<ITEM>1. That you would throughly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn from your evil ways, and amend your doings, that God may repent him of the evil which other∣wise he may bring upon you.

Also mark what the Lord speaketh by the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.3.

<ITEM>2. That you would dearly love, and highly prize those precious Saints and Servants of the Most High God, which are amongst you.

<ITEM>3. And lastly, let me exhort you to open the door and let Christ in, into your thoughts, into your minds, into your affections, into your de∣sires, into your estimations, and into you con∣versations.

<ITEM>2.

</LIST> And this did astonish this great King: New as it was with <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> here, so it will be with the wicked in this great day.

O the enemies of the Lord, and such as oppose his truth, will he then hiss at.

These are they who said, it is in vain to serve the Lord, and what profit is there in the keeping of his Ordinances, and in walking mournfully before the Lord of Hosts? who counted Saints Sots, and Godliness to be Mad∣ness, therefore will they be contemptible before the Lord, Angels and good men. O think of this, you that speak proudly and blasphemously against God and his People; know assuredly, that God will speak to you in his wrath, and vex you in his sore displeasure: <HI>He that sitteth in the Heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall have you in derision,</HI> Psal. 2.3, 4.</P>
<P N="5">5. This Day of Gods Wrath will be a day of great destruction: <HI>Have ye not asked them that go

<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. And first of all by way of Information. If▪ it be so, that the greatest part of Men and Women will not be able to stand in this day of Gods wrath, then this may inform us of 3 things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That as Men have had their day, so God will have his day: Men have had their day of sinning, God will have his day of Punishing: Men have had their day of treasuring up of Wrath, God will have his day of pouring out of Wrath: Men have had their day of defiling, God will have his day of refining: Men have had their day of Fornication, God will have his day of Indignation: <HI>For the day of the Lord as near upon all the Heathen; as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy reward shall return upon thy own head,</HI> Obad. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</ITEM>

I have long time holden my peace: I have been still, and refrained my self: Now will I cry like a travelling woman; I will destroy and deliver at once.</HI> Do you see this, Sinners, how God is re∣solved to proceed against you in the day of his Wrath, though he bear with you in the day of his Patience?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. This day of Gods wrath will be a very dreadful and terrible day to the wicked, as ap∣pears by what hath been said. O Sinners! it will be a day of astonishment, a day of terror, a day of distress, a day of contempt, a day of de∣struction, and a day of wrath! O! <HI>it will be a day of darkness &amp; gloominess, a day of clouds &amp; thick darkness,</HI> Joel 2.2. The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, &amp; hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord; the mighty man shall cry there bitterly; that day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble &amp; distress, a day of wasting and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 1.14, 15. O who is able to express the Terrour of the

</LIST>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2 By way of Examination and Self-tryal.</P>
<P>O Friends! how much doth it concern you and me, to examine our standing, that we may be able to stand in the day of Gods Wrath, which is coming so fast upon us. O you see how that his Wrath is but a little kindled, &amp; yet how hard a matter is it for men to stand, &amp; to abide it; Thousands have been sent to their Graves by it, and many hundreds have left their Habitations, because of it, and are fled out of the City, into several parts of this Kingdom for refuge. O what a sad and doleful place hath this City been for several weeks past! The greatest Trade which bath been here amongst us, was to bury the dead, and tend the sick. O now my Brethren, if this little be so much, what will it be when the great day of his wrath is come! Who will then be able to stand? O therefore examine your selves, &amp; try your faith, examine your faith, whether it be true; your knowledge, whether it be sanctified; your hope, whether it be purified; your love, whe∣ther it be sincere; your evidences, whether they be sound; your hearts, whether they be gracious; your desires, whether they be ho∣ly; your ends, whether they be right; &amp; your conversations, whether they be heavenly, that you may be able to stand in the day of Wrath, in the day of Death, and in the day of Judg∣ment, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="001244_0165_0FB1865125E1C100"/>
<HI>Use</HI> 3. By way of Exhortation. And I shall be brief, lest I should intrude too much upon your patience; but I hope you will not think the time long, for it may be the last Sermon that I may preach, or you hear. Well (Belov∣ed) is it so, that the greatest part of men and women will not be able to stand in the day of God's wrath? Give me leave therefore to ex∣hort you to these three things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You that are Sinners, to repent of your sins; <HI>For he that confesseth and forsaketh, shall have mercy,</HI> Prov. 28.13. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but he that confesseth &amp; forsaketh them shall have mercy. Happy is the man that feareth alway; but he that hardneth his heart, shall fall into mischief. O sinners, you have grievously sinned against God, you have deser∣ved as many Hells, as you have committed Sins; you have sinned against his Mercies, you have abused his Patience, you have resisted his Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, you have not obeyed his Gospel, you have made light of his Ministers, &amp; you have hated his Members. O sinners, all this have you done, and yet the Lord hath spared you; and though you have sinned at so high a rate, yet God hath given you space to repent: O let his goodness lead you to repentance, that you die not in your sins. O therefore, for God's sake, and Christ's sake, be ye prevailed withal; why will you die, seeing God would have you live? why will you damn your selves? why will you go to Hell, seeing God would have you go to Heaven? O do but see what the Lord saith, <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1 18. <HI>Come sinner,</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>and let thee and I reason together, tho' thy sins be as
<PB N="324" REF="001244_0166_0FB18652B5387F18"/>scarlet, they shall be as snow; tho' they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool</HI> Verily, if you have not hearts of stone, methinks these words should melt you, to see the love, the pity, the mercy, and willingness of God to do your souls good.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Let me exhort you, to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Interest in the Lord Jesus, that you may be able to stand in the day of his wrath: O sinners' there will be no standing before Christ, without an Inte∣rest in Christ. O sinners! go to Christ, his Promises are open to you, his Arms are open to embrace you, his Spirit is rea∣dy to assist you, and his People are ready to own you, and his Angels are ready to attend you, &amp; Heaven it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ready to receive you. O sinners! if you will but come to Christ, you shall be reconciled to the Father, justified by the Son, you shall be sanctified by the Spirit, you shall be delivered from Wrath, you shall be made the Children of God, you shall have your Names enrolled in the Book of Life: &amp; finally, you shall be received into everlasting Glory at the end of your days. O therefore let this prevail with you to go to Christ for Light, for Life, for Grace, for Strength, &amp; for Comfort and Peace, that <HI>of his fulness you may re∣ceive grace for grace, Joh.</HI> 1.16.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And lastly, Let me now exhort you (who are dead to sin, separated from the world, es∣poused to Christ, reconciled to the Father) to <HI>walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his king∣dom and glory,</HI> 1 Thes. 2.12. O ye precious Saints, let me exhort you to keep your Lamps burn∣ing, your Loins girded, your Lives holy, and your Hearts upright, your Judgments sound, your
<PB N="325" REF="001244_0166_0FB18652B5387F18"/>Consciences pure, and your Garments unspot∣ted; and be not troubled at Gods dealings and dispensations, tho' he take away from you those that are precious to you: for as he sends the Wicked to Hell, that they may dishonour him no more; so he takes away the Righteous to Heaven, that they may glorifie him more. There seems to be four Reasons why God swept away the Righteous with the Wicked by <HI>the Pestilence.</HI>

</LIST>
1. We have four several Tempters in Script<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re 1. God tempting Man, <HI>i. e.</HI> trying and provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Man, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 8.2. Thus God tempted <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 22 1. which is interpreted, Heb. 11.17. <HI>By faith Abraham, when he was tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, offered up Isaac, &amp;c.</HI> This tempting is not to evil, nor for our hurt; but God tempts upon these Accounts: 1. For the trial of his peoples Fear; as in that of <HI>A∣braham,</HI> Gen. 22.12. <HI>For now I know that thou fear∣est God, seeing thou hast not wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-hold thine only son from me.</HI> 2. God tempts for the trial of their Faith, he proves them in something that's near and dear to them: perhaps deprives them of some special necessary Mercy, to see whether they can trust him, and believe in the want of it; whether they can live by Faith upon the God of Mercies, when the Mercies are gone, as it is written, <HI>The just shall live by faith.</HI> Heb. 2. 4. Rom. 1 17. And it is said of <HI>Abraham, Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he
<PB N="328" REF="001244_0168_0FB186570B1514F8"/>was tried, he offered up Isaac,</HI> Heb. 11.17.3. Again thirdly, the Lord tempts for the proof of their Obedience: and thus the Lord speaks to <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> after that trial: <HI>And in thy seed</HI> shall <HI>all the nations of the earth be blessed?</HI> Why? <HI>because thou host they'd my voice.</HI> In all this the Lord seeth what is in our hearts, as he said to <HI>Israel</HI> of old, <HI>Deut.</HI> 8 2.2. We may find Man tempting God too, that is, provoking God to jealousie and wrath; this did the children of <HI>Israel</HI> at the wa∣ters of <HI>Meribah,</HI> Deut 6.19. <HI>Ye</HI> shall <HI>not tempt the Lord thy God,</HI> Exod. 17.2. <HI>Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?</HI> But first of all, we tempt God when we doubt of his Power; as when we are in any streight or difficulty, we mistrust the Power of God to deliver us, or bestow any Mercy upon us which we stand in need of; as that Lord did, on whose hand the King leaned, who said, <HI>If the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? when God had promised, in time of famine, that on the morrow there</HI> should <HI>be plenty,</HI> 2 King 7 2.2. We tempt God when we doubt of his Mercy, for God is Mercy in the abstract, and it is a part of his glorious Style; therefore he cannot endure to lose so great a part of his Honour, but is provoked by it. 3. When we call his Faithfulness in question: What greater disparagement or more disgraceful thing can there be to a man, than to be wrongfully accu∣sed for falsifying his word? Then how much greater provocation is it to the great God, to be impeached for breach of promise; &amp; counted unfuthful who cannot lie, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.18. Lastly▪ When we murmur at the hand of God at any of his Judgments; thus <HI>Israel</HI> did at <HI>Meribah,</HI> Exod.
<PB N="329" REF="001244_0168_0FB186570B1514F8"/>17.2, 3. &amp; this doth exceedingly inflame and excite the wrath of God: we cannot dispose for our selves, and yet we are angry at the Providence of an All-wise God: we sin, &amp; are not troubled that God corrects us for sin. 3. In the next place, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lusts are <HI>Tempters,</HI> as <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own hearts lusts, and enticed.</HI> Our Lusts strive within us to be sinfully sa∣tisfied, and the <HI>flesh wars against the spirit,</HI> the Heart sometimes alluring; &amp; this comes to pass,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By representing some sinful object: It is not good to nourish such Conceptions, but strangle them in their first appearance, else sinful Thoughts grow upon us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By presenting some desirableness in the object; but be quick-sighted; sin, however it seems fair under some colourable pretext, is in∣deed, upon good deliberation, not at all to be desired; but sometimes it comes cloathed in such a glorious garb, as if it meant no harm, that you must be fain to fly to God by Prayer against this Temptation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There's a perswasion to consent to the Sin; but be not easily perswaded to offend your Father; Oh! how will our Lusts gain upon us, if we do not resist? strive with all your might; the greater your allurements to sin is, the greater the sin is. I appeal to Saints expe∣rience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. In the fourth and last place, We have the Devil tempting Man; he is called <HI>the Tempter,</HI> Mat. 4.1, 3. Mar. 1.13. And in∣deed this is the grand Tempter, that makes
<PB N="330" REF="001244_0169_0FB1865860419180"/>use of our Lusts as a subservient Organ or Instrument for his Temptations against the Soul; and indeed, were it not for our Lusts, it would be in vain for Satan to tempt: As we see in Christ, there was nothing within for Satan to take hold of, Christ being with∣out sinful Lusts; but Satan must come by word of mouth to tempt him, as <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.1, 3. But here it might be enquir'd, <HI>How shall I know when Satan raised the Temptation.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I answer, first, When it comes strongly and forcibly upon the soul, as it were, with a double power, even overthrowing the soul (almost) at the first Encounter. There's a double strength in the stroke. 2. When it is of long continuance, as that was which <HI>Paul besought the Lord twice for,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.8. Satan stirs up the heart afresh, and the lusts of the heart! When the fire is ready to die and go out, he blows it up again, adds life &amp; strength to the Temptation, which else could not last long. The Lusts they are the combustible Matter, and Satan he inflames and sets them on fire. 3. The Temptation when, though it may be weak at first, yet at length, by de∣grees, it grows stronger and stronger. Satan begins to reason with, and perswade the soul by plausible arguments. 4. We may perceive the working of the Serpent, the Devil: when the temptation is full of wiles. &amp; subtil delu∣sions, <HI>Eph.</HI> 16.11.2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.16. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.24. The more intricate &amp; full of subtilty the tempta∣tion is, the more cause there is to suspect. Sa∣tan
<PB N="331" REF="001244_0169_0FB1865860419180"/>is very busie for the ensnaring of the Soul.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, The more it is in direct opposition to God in his Commands, or the like, we may be the more sure it is of Satan's framing; for the heart, and its lusts, seek for satisfaction, &amp; then are still, (if Satan joi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not) tho' God be not so directly opposite: But the Devil strikes always at God in his temptations; or if not always, yet most frequently.</P>
<P>Thus much for the Tempter; now for the Temptation it self There are several sorts of temptations; but to reduce them all to these three Heads, they do concern, and strike at. <HI>First</HI> of all, God; this being Satans great aim, to oppose God; as two enemies, always in di∣rect opposition to one another; and thus he tempts either: 1. As to the Being of God, call∣ing in question the very truth of the Essence of the great God, causing the soul to doubt whe∣ther there be a God or no, like <HI>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord,</HI> &amp;c <HI>Exod.</HI> 1.5.</P>
<P>But <HI>secondly,</HI> Some Temptations touch upon the nature of God, as to the manner of his Be∣ing, the Mystery of three distinct Persons, as to their Offices &amp; Operations, in the individual God-head, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit; and yet all but one God bles∣sed for ever. Again, As to those Divine insepa∣rable <HI>Attributes of God,</HI> his independency, puri∣ty, immutability, greatness and eternity; his goodness, grace, mercy, love, patience, &amp; just∣ice. I say, sometimes as doubting of these things is our temptation; yea, &amp; could Satan prevail, we should flatly deny his Being, Nature, Pro∣perties &amp; all. Look sternly on, &amp; resist strongly
<PB N="332" REF="001244_0170_0FB1865B5E27BDE8"/>such Temptations as these, which do immediately &amp; presumptuously intrench upon God's Sove∣raign &amp; Just Prerogative. And, if I mistake not, a great device of Satan's in this stratagem, is, to perswade the Creature from all dependency up∣on a Creator, that so being left to her self, and standing upon its own strength, he may more destroy it. For what's the Creature without the Creator's power?</P>
<P>Again, some Temptations touch our Spiritu∣al Being. Such as are an evil heart of unbelief, mistrusting the grace of God, despairing of the goodness of our Condition. Satan would fain raze the very Fountain of Spiritual Existence, Adoption, Justification, &amp; hopes of Salvation; it is his great design to shake the very ground∣work of this Building, &amp; to perswade, that all's false. But this temptation is fruitless, when we build aright upon a <HI>right foundation,</HI> by Faith accompanied with repentance from dead works, upon <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> as the <HI>alone Author</HI> &amp; <HI>Meritorious Cause</HI> of our <HI>Justification</HI> &amp; <HI>Eternal Clarification.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Lastly, Satan by his fiery Darts strikes at our well-being to disturb our Peace by the o∣mission of some <HI>Duty,</HI> or <HI>commission</HI> of some <HI>Sin;</HI> when he finds he cannot prevail to destroy out <HI>being,</HI> then he would deprive us of <HI>well-being,</HI> our <HI>joy</HI> &amp; <HI>comfort.</HI> But know, tho' these Temp∣tations may trouble us, yet shall they never de∣stroy us. Now for the manner of these Temp∣tations, how they work.</P>
<P N="1">1. When we fall under any want, strait, change of Providence, or the like; then is a time for temptation to work; as when Christ had fasted &amp; was an hungred, then comes the
<PB N="333" REF="001244_0170_0FB1865B5E27BDE8"/>Tempter, <HI>If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones may be made bread,</HI> Mat. 4.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. When we are first turning from sin to God, then we are sure to meet with a <HI>Tempter,</HI> Satan will be busie.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we are troubled, dejected, discon∣solated, either to the outward or inward estate, then beware of Satan's temptation, he will be furthering our disquietments.</P>
<P N="4">4. When we are arrived to some good hopes, thro' Grace, to some Confidence in the Mercy of God the Father, thro' his Son Jesus Christ; then also shall we find the battering Assaults of Satan to shake our Confidence: but be sure al∣ways, that the grounds of your Confidence be good, established upon that Everlasting Rock, Jesus Christ. For, if I mistake not in my obser∣vation, there are two great Rocks, which Satan strives to split a Soul upon, <HI>Presumption</HI> and <HI>De∣spair:</HI> Sometimes endeavouring to cause Souls to flatter up themselves, &amp; think Grace is theirs, Christ is theirs, and all is theirs, when it is no∣thing so, but by this he might carry them blind to Hell, hood-winking their Souls so, that they never come to see throughly, that they are in a bad condition, but think always their condi∣tion good. The other Rock is <HI>Despair;</HI> Satan striving, if he cannot blind them, as he doth the other presumptuous Souls, yet to make them go sorrowing all their days, thinking they shall never obtain that Mercy which o∣thers think they always had.</P>
<P N="5">5. Satan suits his Temptations to our Dispo∣sitions; he hath various Objects for divers Spi∣rits; for the proud haughty Soul, for the lustful
<PB N="334" REF="001244_0171_0FB1865C2E938DB0"/>Heart, for the covetous Worldling, for the Prodigal Son, for the rash giddy Brain, for the sluggish Drone, for the melancholly Person, for the light chearful Spirit; especially these two, either sinking the one in the terrible Waves of black and dreadful Thoughts, or tossing and listing up the other with the Wind of foolish Fancy. Oh! what black Apprehensions shall the one have of it self &amp; God? and what light and slight Thoughts the other, of the present State, and of Eternity.</P>
<P>Lastly, Satan aims to lull the Soul asleep in carnal security: And to this end, presents great sins as small, &amp; little sins, (if any there be) as none at all: But sometimes he will add by temptation, as it were a multiplying-glass, to the soul, so that then every sin looks with a ghastly countenance, is thought to be the sin a∣gainst the Holy Spirit, an unpardonable Sin.</P>
<P>Having thus shewn how, and upon what oc∣casion Satan works; I shall take occasion to en∣quire, why they have so much power, as many times to prevail.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because of the Tempters Power, he is per∣haps too strong for the soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because of the Tempters Policy; if he can∣not prevail by open force, the soul being well &amp; strongly grounded; then he invades by sub∣til devices, &amp; secret stratagems, so that the soul cannot escape by strength only; and therefore (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wanting wisdom to evade his cunningly fra∣med Arguments) is baffled by him, &amp; overthrown.</P>
<P N="3">3. The enticing Nature of the Tempter's Baits; As, to instance in one case, Oh how ma∣ny poor sincere souls, yet guilty of too much
<PB N="335" REF="001244_0171_0FB1865C2E938DB0"/>curiosity, have been intangled by curiously glorious, &amp; gloriously curious Tenets, which were no better than the devilish temptation of that Hellish Tempter! How many, (which yet is strange to think, tho' there is no reason to fear it) nay, after their seemingly comfortable, really, comfortless, wandring walkings in thought-ways of truth, have cause to fit down, &amp; set down their steps, marking for every step a sin; &amp; for every sin, letting fall a tear of blood.</P>
<P N="4">4. Temptations often prevail by reason of the strength of Corruptions, which the Temp∣ter works upon. Were there no Corruptions, there would be few or no Temptations; I am sure, they should not prevail.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, The Tempter's prevalency pro∣ceeds from the weakness and low estate of the inward man: Sin is never at a higher flood, than when Grace is at a low ebb: It is a hard matter (believe Experience) to keep the Soul from sinking at such a time. Nothing more ea∣sie than to thrust one under water, when the depth of the water is more than the heighth of the man.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But now to make sure the Doctrinal part, I shall lay down some Reasons, why the People of God are thus attended with Temptations: for it is a na∣tural Objection against this Point, Why will the Lord, who is so mere. ful of his People, suffer them to be thus used and buffeted by Temptation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer in general, on Gods behalf, that he is never the less tender in it, as will appear in particular, thus:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Because one end seems to be this, that they might know themselves the better, &amp; see what
<PB N="336" REF="001244_0172_0FB1865DA26FB838"/>they are naturally; were it not for Tempta∣tion, we should not come to know our own corruption; we see by this, what lust is most prevalent in us, according to that in <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. <HI>The sin that doth so easily beset us;</HI> &amp; what Satan <HI>makes most</HI> use of against us; we learn by this our own weakness to resist, without assisting Grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Again, It is for a Saint's Exercise: This Tempted Condition, is God's Artillery, his School of Arms, wherein God brings up his Children, trains them, &amp; instructs them how to clasp on their Helmet of Salvation, to put on the Breast plate of Righteousness, to hold out the shield of Faith, to brandish the Sword of the Spirit: In a word, how to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, even our whole Armor of Righteousness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That we might know our Enemies, that we may be the <HI>more watchful</HI> o∣ver Satan, Sin, &amp; the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That we might long to be at home with our Fathers, that we might be weaned from the Milk; and drawn from the Breasts of this present World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Last∣ly, The Lord doth it to beat down our pride, &amp; keep us humble, we should else be <HI>too</HI> much listed up through our continued spiritual pros∣perity; &amp; thus it was with <HI>Paul.</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.7 8. <HI>This Doctrine may afford us this useful Application.</HI></ITEM>

<P N="4">4. Consolation. From these Arguments: Arg. 1. <HI>A tempted condition is frequent among the Saints, yea, &amp; so usual, that I may Confidently ques∣tion,
<PB N="338" REF="001244_0173_0FB1865F437F9D58"/>whether ever he were truly a Saint, that is not tempted? And for this Assertion, there's a cloud of Witnesses in Scripture; one in</HI> 1 Cor. 13. Arg. 2. <HI>God hath promised Assistance to the tempted ones,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.9. My grace is sufficient for thee, <HI>&amp;c. God is as able to help, as thou canst be weak when thou art tempted.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 3. <HI>Christ was tempted, that he might know how to succour these that are tempted,</HI> Heb. 2.27, 28. <HI>read from</HI> ver. 9.</P>
<P>Arg. 4. <HI>It is a blessing, or a blessed thing, to en∣dure temptations,</HI> James, 1.12. <HI>&amp;</HI> 5.11.</P>
<P>Arg. 5. <HI>The Saints temptations are needful for them,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.6. <HI>Thou canst not be without them.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 6. <HI>They are but for the trial of Faith,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.7. Jam. 1.3, 4. <HI>And should we be grieved, that our Faith is proved? The Goldsmith rather useth, than avoideth the fire, for the trying his Gold: Neither is the Gold dimin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed, but rather its worth is more fully known, when the dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss is gone. This is the trial that doth try all the Faith of every Child of God.</HI> Arg. 7. <HI>God hath promised the burden shall not be too great for us to bear,</HI> 1 Cor. 10.13. <HI>This is ground of comfort, to know we shall not be over∣matched by the temptation.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 8. <HI>A great comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is, that God thinks upon us at such a time▪ we are sure of this, both because of the temptations, &amp; also the support we have under them.</HI> Arg. 9. <HI>It is a great sign of God's love, else he would never take ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and purge us.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 10. <HI>Many times is gees before some signal Providence. And we may take it as a great sign, that God is about to do some great thing for us, or
<PB N="339" REF="001244_0173_0FB1865F437F9D58"/>we must be employed in some great work for him, Thus he did with</HI> Israel, <HI>proved them forty years before he gave them to possess the Land.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 11. <HI>Be not disconsolate; strong &amp; long en∣during Temptations, when meeting with resistance, are a strong Argument of a strong Faith, &amp; especially of the growth &amp; encrease of Faith. But (to be brief.)</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 12. <HI>Consider the Saints condition here is not their best state; there's Heaven to come yet, where there's no Tempter.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 13. <HI>We have not been so much, nor so often tempted, as we our selves have tempted God.</HI></P>

<P>Arg. 15. <HI>It is a great sign, as of Gods love, so of Satans hatred; &amp; so consequently a token that thou art none of his, but Gods; else he would never rage thus, The Devil makes no such ado with wicked ones.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2 How we may do to Watch; I shall but name the particulars.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1▪ Let the heart be continually fixed upon God. Oh, how will this cool our affe∣ctions to the world, &amp; kindle the fire of love to God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Let the eye be much upon himself: this will keep us low in spirit: <HI>And blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Mat. 5.3.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Beware of drowsiness: We should shake it off by Prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Be well resolved in spirit: mind that of the Prophet, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 18.21.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Be sure all be well within; be sure thy foundation be Christ: let there be no sin unrepented of that will breed sorrow: harbour no enemy, no lust in the soul, <HI>Pro.</HI> 20.9.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Trust not thine (no, no, not thine own) heart, but regulate it by the Word of God; for the heart is deceitful, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.9. And he is a fool that trusts his heart, <HI>Pro.</HI> 28.26.</ITEM>

<ITEM>9. And if there be any thing out of order, tarry not, but repair it sud∣denly, lay sin upon Christ, &amp; then mourn over it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Let nothing be suggested, &amp; presently en∣tertained, but first brought to trial: See if it be the will of God, if it be for his glory; it is not his will, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Be sure to keep Conscience clear; a little filth (here) stops all the Channel. It is dangerous to know of but of one sin, and not confess it; much more dangerous to know thy sin, &amp; wink at it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. For this end keep an open car to Conscience, let it speak</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. Let the mouth be stopped to sin, &amp; the hands tied from wick∣edness. <HI>David</HI> prays, <HI>that a watch may be set to the doors of his lips;</HI> &amp; certainly it is very needful.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. The <HI>manner</HI> how we are to pray.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Prayer</HI> is the outward enlargement of the Souls inward breathings; it is a work of God's Spirit, &amp; so flows out of the spirit &amp; heart of man, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. <HI>Ro.</HI> 8.26, 27. <HI>Jude</HI> 20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.19. <HI>Ps.</HI> 62.8. <HI>&amp;</HI> 42.4. <HI>Prayer</HI> is a talking of the heart &amp; soul with God, &amp; of such a heart as is prepared by God, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.13. <HI>Ps.</HI> 27.1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 10.17.</ITEM>

Or more publick, when we pray with others in the Family, Congregation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And here let some Preparatives to Prayer be added. 1. Pray that you may pray: lift up your eye and your heart to God, when about to pray; thus did <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 14.1.1, 2.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="342" REF="001244_0175_0FB18662E30F43F8"/>

</LIST></P>
<P>Now I come to the proof of this point: <HI>That the only way to avoid the evil of Temptation, as to, watch &amp; pray.</HI> This is clearly stated in the Text; so that it scarce needs more confirmation; only take that of <HI>Paul,</HI> when buffetted by Temptation: <HI>For this,</HI> saith he, <HI>I besought the Lord thrice,</HI> 2. Cor.
<PB N="343" REF="001244_0175_0FB18662E30F43F8"/>12.8 There is great need of <HI>Watching</HI> &amp; <HI>Praying:</HI> 1. Before we fall into Temptation. 2. When we are under Temptation. How <HI>Watching</HI> &amp; <HI>Pray∣ing</HI> conduceth to the anticipating the Assaults of <HI>Satan,</HI> frustrating Temptation. First of all, for <HI>Watching.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It sets us in readiness for an As∣sault: When we are expecting, we shall not be taken unprovided.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It adds resolution, to stand, it out against <HI>Satan:</HI> We know suddenness strikes us into a fear, when expectation &amp; deliberation encreaseth courage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It is a countermine to all <HI>Satan's</HI> stratagems: It will deceive the Deceiver, to find us watching with spiritual diligence, when he would have us sleeping in carnal secu∣rity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Watching secures us from much evil that might be added, in case we were drawn to the Temptation: for security is no better than a temptation, especially at such a time. Secondly, for <HI>Prayer:</HI> This conduceth to avoid the evil of Temptation, because it fetcheth help from God, in whom is all our strength: for it is Gods pro∣mise, <HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, &amp; thou shalt glorifie me,</HI> Psal. 50 15. It is a great comfort, under temptation, to have a God to go to, especially one that is able &amp; willing to help.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This may instruct us. 1. Then there is great need of watching. It is certainly a universal necessary duty for all Saints, at whatever time, to watch: So saith <HI>Christ</HI> our Saviour, <HI>What I say un∣to you, I say unto all, Watch,</HI> Mar. 13.27. The great end of this duty, is the coming of the <HI>Lord Jesus. Watch,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>for you know not what hour your Lord doth come,</HI> Mat. 24.42, 44. There are three Con∣siderations may move us to watch. 1. Let us con∣sider whom we offend &amp; dishonour by our neg∣lect in watching, no less than God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would we
<PB N="344" REF="001244_0176_0FB18665245DEBD8"/>rather than want a nap of security, displease our God? Is God no more worth to us than so? Let as seriously weigh how great an offence, how great a dishonour to God, our unwatchfulness is; and this will engage us to watch. 2. Let us con∣sider whom we gratifie &amp; advantage by our neg∣lect; no less an enemy than Satan, the enemy of our Souls: And shall we pleasure our grand Ad∣versary? Oh no! then let us watch. 3. Whom we displeasure; it is our selves: And will we, that our Souls should be losers? If not, let us be much, yea always upon our watch. But second∣ly, It may inform us of the necessity of praying at all times: <HI>Pray without ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing,</HI> 1 Thes. 5.17. So <HI>David</HI> would pray, and cry aloud, <HI>At evening, at morning, and at noon,</HI> Psal. 55.17. And <HI>Daniel prayed thrice a day,</HI> Dan. 6.16. It is the duty of all, &amp; e∣very Saint, in all conditions. In Spiritual things,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Pray for Grace, that God would give &amp; increase it, either in it self or others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Pray against sin, against the guilt of sin, a gainst the power of sin.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Pray against Satan's Temptations.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Against the occasion of temptation. That if it be possible, thou mayest shun &amp; escape the very appearance of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the strength of corruption within, and the power of temptation without, may not be so prevalent, as to lead thee captive to evil.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST> 2. Pray, that the entrance into temptation, may be no disadvantage to thy grace; and that the escape out, may be no impeachment to, but rather for the advancement of God's glory. 1. Pray for nothing but what thou standest in need of: Un∣necessary things are not to be the subject of our Petitions: And therefore our Saviour bids us pray for our daily Bread, and so that good man <HI>Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Give me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither poverty nor riches,</HI> Prov. 30.7, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2. Even in these things, pray with submission
<PB N="345" REF="001244_0176_0FB18665245DEBD8"/>to the Will of God 3. If <HI>Watching</HI> &amp; <HI>Praying</HI> be the means to escape the evil of temptation, then the strength of a Saint is not sufficient: No, we must go to God for a deliverance. 4. If we do not watch &amp; pray, all other ways &amp; means are irre∣gular at least, if not sin. Thus much for Infor∣mation. Now for Exhortation. 1. Watch &amp; Pray continually, but especially at a time of tempta∣tion. 2. Be serious in Watching &amp; Praying; some do it between hot &amp; cold, or by fits, or with much lightness of spirit: But saith the Apostle, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sober, and Watch unto prayer;</HI> Sobriety and Se∣riousness becomes those that call upon God.</P>

Answ. 1. <HI>As to the exercise of our Sences afford opportunity of delight, so are they thereby capable of annoying &amp; grieving us: As the Taste by bitterness &amp; sharpness,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the smell by noisome pollution, corrup∣tion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the Hearing by terrible &amp; hideous noise and evil tidings: the sight by loathsome, affrighting, &amp; mi∣serable appearances; the Feeling by tedious pains,</HI> &amp;c.

<ITEM>1. <HI>Why, what is man? Is he not a flower, &amp; as grass, &amp; the like? And are they not cut off in their best estate? And may not God, when he walketh in, or vieweth this gar∣den of humane flowers, have as much liberty to crop them, as men have of their<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Surely yea; for all are his.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>And tho' God permit some men to live, as long as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ordinary course of nature, oft be it, seventy year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which is judged the more common) or more; yet he hath not promised them so long life.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>4. <HI>As we conclude, that no person bet∣ter, or so well as the Gardiner, or such as sowed, planted, dressed, &amp; frequently practiseth about the Flowers and plants, knows when, and for what reason, to gather, &amp; pluck up; so no person knows better, nor so well, as God knows well to cut or pluck up what he hath planted in the World, who doth all his Actions upon good and weighty Reasons, even greater &amp; better than any Gar∣diner or other person hath, for what he doth in his con∣cernment.</HI></ITEM>

In death a man becomes a loath∣some spectacle to all beholders, insomuch that the sight &amp; smell of the survivers find not more noisome offence from, &amp; account not more vilely of the most loathsome Creatures in the world, than of a dead &amp; rotten Corps of mankind: And, is not that very grievous, to become from a de∣lightful companion, an abhorrence of all people? <Q><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. True, being dead, a man becomes a loath∣some spectacle to all beholders. And do not many Diseases, to which a man is incident in this life, effect the same in beholders? 2. Tho' man do become by death what is suggested, yet:
<PB N="347" REF="001244_0177_0FB18666CBC398C0"/>hath he then no sense thereof, &amp; in that is the Proverb verified, <HI>(What the eye sees not, the Heart rues not;)</HI> for look on man in that case (as we may) as a dead lump of Corruption, &amp; what of misery can we apply thereto? Who looks on a Dunghil; or a Jakes, &amp; saith, Alas, for its misery? the same feels not &amp; knows not any: So that al∣tho' the thoughts of such a condition by Death grieves us whilst living, yet in that condition it self we shall be free from such grief 3. <HI>Again, consider,</HI> That we were but earth before we had life; and being dead, we return to our first e∣state; and tho' withal, we become for a season more impure &amp; corrupt than barely earth, yet in time we shall become very dust, when the pu∣trefaction is consumed; and in that sense (but especially in a more excellent) will that saying be fulfilled, <HI>viz. Corruption shall put on Incorruption.</HI></Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 4. Death deprives man of his society, with whom he hath had sweet converse. <HI>Ans.</HI> 1. True, <Q>but in order (if he die in Gods favour) to enjoy in due season better society than men on earth have. 2. Besides, as thou losest thy friends on earth, so thou art rid of thy enemies there too.</Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 5. Tho' Death may make way for better socie∣ty than we have been used to here, yet who knows when it shall be, the Body not being to receive new life till the general Resurrection, which may be very long first. <HI>Ans.</HI> <Q>Suppose it be so (as the most Christians believe) that the best part of man receives glory &amp; happiness immediately after death; yet from the time of death, to the general Resurrection (at which time all knowing Christians believe the reward of the Righteous will not fail) the space betwixt Death &amp; it, is but as one day; as he who by means of an Apo∣plexy,
<PB N="348" REF="001244_0178_0FB1866821FBCC70"/>or like occasion, sleeps many days &amp; nights without waking, cannot esteem of the time he hath slept, answerable to the measure thereof, <HI>but</HI> it may be to him as one day or one night; and in this sense may Death be reckoned (as usually in the holy Scripture it is) a sleep.</Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 6. Sup∣pose a man should die by the hand of a cruel Man-slayer, who delights in torturing &amp; destroy∣ing the body of man, as hath been seen; would not the conceit of one so cruel, coming to act his mind upon a person, make the thoughts of such a death more terrible, when therein a man is no more regarded than a dog, or the vilest creature? <HI>Ans.</HI> 1 <Q>Yea: But do not many, by reason of <HI>wounds</HI> &amp; gangreen'd members in their life, for preser∣ving the body, limb, or member, endure as great pain, &amp; tremble as much at the sight of the Chi∣rurgeon, when he comes to do his office on <HI>them,</HI> as a man doth at the sight of the Executioner to do his? And consider, that all that is commonly done at such a death, causeth less pain to the party, than what some do suffer by the cutting off one limb, or curing some one wound or dis∣ease. 2. <HI>Again, consider,</HI> That the more of torment a man endures in this life, whether at death or otherwise, the less he is like to suffer after this life, &amp; the more blessing he is likely then to en∣joy, if he be a good or worthy man, suffering here as a child of God, &amp; not a Reprobate, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18. <HI>v.</HI> 7. <HI>Chap</HI> 20. <HI>v.</HI> 4, 5, 6.</Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 7. But in our pre∣sent Estate we have Being, Life, Sense, &amp; Reason; &amp; in Death we shall have (at the most) only <HI>Being;</HI> &amp; is not that very grievous to consider, that we should be reduced to no better condition than a piece of Earth, or a Stone? Ans. <HI>It is true, that the consideration thereof is very grievous in it self;
<PB N="349" REF="001244_0178_0FB1866821FBCC70"/>but yet whilst man hath Reason, as well as Being, Life &amp; Sense, let him use it to consider also that he hath no more cause to complain, that for a piece of the Earth he now treads on if it should please God (as at the first) to create thereof a man like himself, &amp; shortly reduce it to its former state; for thus it is now with mankind in general. Obj.</HI> 8. It is confest, that there is a Pro∣verb, <HI>(From one pleasure a thousand dolours)</HI> but it seems to be no better than a flourish of learned men, to colour over a bad matter: For altho' the miseries of man in this life are many, yet if the benefits therein did not surmount those miseries, it is likely that men would not so much desire to continue therein, as now they do; and there∣fore who would not fear Death? <HI>Ans</HI> 1. <Q>Suppose it be granted, that the Proverb is but a flourish, &amp; that the benefits of this life do surmount the miseries thereof; yet no man is able to say, how long a person, in order to be happy should live here to enjoy these benefits: But God he knows, &amp; he hath appointed for men once to die; <HI>there∣fore</HI> rest satisfied in his Wisdom for disposing of thy time for Death, concluding that the same shall be in its due season. 2. <HI>Again, Consider,</HI> That it is Gods Prerogative over all his Creatures, to dispose of them how &amp; when he will. 3. More∣over, God hath already set the bounds of thy life, beyond which thou canst not pass: where∣fore patiently commit thy self to him in well-doing, &amp; quietly satisfie thy self with pleasure, making of Necessity a Vertue; for it is in vain for a man to strive against the stream, by tor∣menting himself with that which he cannot a∣void; yet this doth not hinder that all men may (yea ought) to use what lawful means God gives <HI>them</HI> opportunity of, for saving their lives.</Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 9.

Ans. <HI>Death is indeed granted to be the King of Terrors, but that is in regard of a certain sting that is in it; if that sting be taken away, Death will not be saterrible as before, yea it will be rather gain than l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss to die, if that sting reach not the party dying.

I confess, there may seem to be some comfort in that Answer, if one knew how to escape that Sting; but that is a thing so difficult, that I greatly fear death: If I were suffi∣ciently provided in that case, I should have com∣fort. <HI>Ans.</HI><Q>It is true, that the difficulty lies even there, where it is exprest; but tho' it be so dif∣ficult, yea impossible with man, yet it is not so difficult with God, he hath sufficiently provid∣ed for man in that case; for he that is King of Kings hath subdued that King of Terrors, and done what is needful for man concerning the same; for which purpose see these Scriptures, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.55, 56, 57. <HI>Job.</HI> 3.14, 15, 16, 17 &amp; part of <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</HI> 18 from <HI>v.</HI> 5, to 12. &amp; afterward to the end of the Chapter.</Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 11. I grant it appears plain enough, that there is, through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> victory wrought over that enemy mentioned, &amp; answerably the Sting is taken away that I feared; I say, taken away for some, but it seems not for all, because it is said, <HI>The sting of death is sin;</HI> so <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> where sin is, there the sting is also; &amp; I know my self a sinner, therefore in danger of that sting. <HI>Ans.</HI> <Q>Indeed, if thou knowest thy self a sinner, &amp; griev'st not for it, but art therewith content,
<PB N="351" REF="001244_0179_0FB1866A61F63AA8"/>neither repented of, nor reformed from it, I cannot say, the sting of Death is taken away for thee; but if thou dost truly repent of thy sin, &amp; endeavour with thy heart to forsake sin, the sting of Death is taken away for thee; for the Scripture tells us, Christ died for sinners, that is to say, humble penitent sinners, not for obstinate ones: A notable example whereof was manifest∣ed, when the Saviour of the World himself was held up, <HI>viz.</HI> in that of the two Thieves; the one railed on Christ, &amp; was reproved; the other humbled himself, he also prayed, &amp; received <HI>the</HI> answer of salvation</Q> <HI>Obj.</HI> 12. Indeed <HI>that</HI> Exam∣ple (methinks) doth tend to prove what you say; but in so considerable a Case as this, a man would desire more than one Witness. <HI>Ans. Therefore take more,</HI> viz. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8 13 <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. from <HI>v.</HI> 16. to 19. <HI>Mat</HI> 9.12, 13. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.8 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15, 16.</P>

It brings him to see, not only that he is a condemned or guilty Person, but that he is ir∣recoverably lost, must needs perish, without some person, as Mediator or Redeemer, do un∣dertake for his Ransom or hath undertaken it; for that God is infinitely just, &amp; he must have his Justice satisfied; &amp; all that the poor souls can do, is but to amend his life for the future, walking more conformable to the righteous Law of God, than heretofore. But alas! that is no more than what we ought to be for the time to come, it will not satisfie Divine Justice <HI>for</HI> the Transgressions already done against <HI>the</HI> Law of God, any more than a man's paying a∣nother, an <HI>ensuing</HI> Week, Month, or Year, for all he is engaged for within that space of time, doth satisfie or clear the Debt which became due in time before that Week.
