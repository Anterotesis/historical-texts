<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be more various and opposite than the opinions of mankind, respecting the influence and a∣gency of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal spirits. Some continually throw the blame of their vices upon the poor Devil;—take their word for it, and they are on all occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions the innocent dupes to his sub∣tilty and malice: they represent him as the prime agent in all their complicated scenes of wickedness; and would fain persuade us, that so far from being the objects of our just a∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsion, they deserve all our commiseration and pity. From su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>representations one would be tempted to think, that if malicious and busy devils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id but stay in their own country, mankind would be as harmless as lambs, and every species of wickedness be soon banished from our then agreeable world.</P>
<P>Others there be who fall into the opposite extreme, and with all their power endeavour to clear the Devil of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an∣ders thrown upon him; whether he hath retained them as his advocates I pretend not to say: but they tell you that he has no hand in all the wickedness committed under the sun; that it is impossible he should have any influence on the minds and manners of men. Nay, some go farther still, even doubt of his very existence, and are confident that all their wick∣edness ariseth from another quarter.</P>
<P>My mind, I must confess, was long agitated between these widely different opinions: now I verged towards the one, now towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extreme; and for a long time continued in such p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inful suspence, that I would have given
<PB N="iv" REF="027249_0003_0FD3CE346E007958"/>a world to have been satisfied in a matter of such vast im∣portance in human life. But at length I obtained a full and most convincing discovery of this very intricate affair; and let who will deny it, I am perfectly satisfied that, however justly the guilt of men may be charged on their own cor∣ruptions, infernal spirits do exist, and are fully employed in forwarding their wicked designs and purposes. Yea, I have learned so much of the art and address of diabolical spirits in this matter, that as I shall, I trust, avail <HI>myself</HI> much of the very singular discovery, so, from a principle of benevolence to mankind, I think myself fully justified without further a∣pology, in communicating it to the public.</P>
<P>Know then, that not far from my humble cot, there is a widely extended, most tremendous and gloomy VALE, first formed, as is supposed, by some dreadful earthquake, or some other remarkable convulsion in nature. The confines of this valley, on the outside, are every where nearly level with the surface of the ground, but the precipice within is to the last degree horrible, insomuch that few have had fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>de enough to approach it. The ancient bards very justly called it HORRIDA VALLYS, and we from them, the Vale of Hor∣rors. This horrid vale has long been supposed, by the cre∣dulous vulgar, to be the haunt of infernal spirits; and some people imagine that it is the only place on earth where they freely converse about the dark designs of their mal-admini∣siration.</P>
<P>My curiosity continually prompting me, at last conquered my native timidity, and I resolved, if possible, to find an en∣trance into this unfrequented, unknown, and dreadful place.</P>
<P>But many months, I may say some years, were spent in this fruitless search, and I despaired of success. At length, however, having entered a very large and unfrequented wood, one side of which led to the very edge of the preci∣pice; as I walked a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urlongs down a gradual descent, gloomy beyond whatever I had seen before, I came to a huge rock, all overgrown with ivy and moss. It had the appear∣ance
<PB N="v" REF="027249_0004_0FD3CE40F7D20230"/>of an ancient ruin, somewhat in the form of a pyramid; the bottom occupied a considerable space, and the spiral top was hardly concealed by the highest branches of the tall and aged oaks which surrounded it. Near the ground, by chance, I discovered an opening almost ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aked up with baleful hem∣loc and night<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hade. At first I thought that this could be no other than the cave of some ancient Druid; but approaching it, and having with much to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l cleared away the noxious weeds, I found, what I had long sought for, an entrance into the dreadful ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity.</P>
<P>Here my resolution almost failed me, and I was at the point of relinquishing the long projected enterprize. At length I recollected myself a little, and resolved to descend into the place, though, as I thought, not much less horrible than hell. The passage, a little within the entrance, led downwards, almost in a perpendicular direction; but its straitness, and the natural uneveness of the rocks that form∣ed it, rendered my descent more practicable and safe than I at first expected. Down, however, I went, fathoms I know not how many, ere I found myself at the bottom, and from an easy opening entered the <HI>gloomy vale.</HI></P>
<P>Looking up, I saw rocks upon rocks projecting over my timo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous head; and I perceived myself to be within the most hideous inclosure that sure ever mortal eyes beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld. The vale being solitary and gloomy as death itself, I said in my heart, surely if damned spirits are permitted to visit the earth, this must be their rendezvous, and two to one I shall see some of them. I therefore observed carefully my retreat; and by several marks on the rocks which formed it, I hoped that, on any emergency, I might be directed to the entrance of the cave, by which alone I could return to the society of mortals.</P>
<P>I soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound that my precautions were far from being un∣necessary; for I saw, by the feeble light which glimmered in the place, a form most frightful making directly towards
<PB N="vi" REF="027249_0005_0FD3CDAC66224C70"/>me. My heart bounced in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>error, and swift as a hare prest by sanguine hounds, I ran to my little sanctu∣ary. No sooner had I entered it, but the fiend stalked up to the very door of it. The hair of my head stood upright, the blood run down my back as cold as Greenland ice, and I looked upon myself as a dead man; having often heard of miserable wretches being torn in pieces by the talons of merciless infernals. But as the hideous form attempted not to penetrate into the cave nor seemed at all conscious of my being there, I recovered myself a little, and reviewed it with less apprehension of danger. At length, he espied another of his clan, to whom he called, and with whom he held the following dialogue, which made such an impression on my mind, that I afterwards recollected the most part of it, and here present it to the worthy reader. The name of this de∣vil, as I afterwards understood, was AVARO, and that of the other, FASTOSUS.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE I. Between FASTOSUS and AVARO.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVARO.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO HO! Fastosus, whither so fast this time of the morn∣ing? Be not in such a hurry, but let a kindred Devil ex∣change a few words with you. Pray, how do you do, uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FASTOSUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! my nephew Avaro—I little thought of finding you in the vale at present. But I am glad to see you. Pray, how do you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir, I am pretty well, only tired with much exercise. But pray, where were you going in such a hurry? When I called to you, you seemed to outfly the wind!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Avaro, I should not be willing to discover my concerns to every enquirer; but I condescend to make free with you, on account of our near kindred; and know∣ing you to be a true son of Belzebub, I can trust you with any secret. As for my present hurry, the occasion of it is this: The right honorable <HI>Madame de la Cocquette</HI> having an inclination to a suit, of some fashion never before invent∣ed, was thrown into a violent fever, through the dullness of the mantua makers, who could devise no <HI>cut</HI> suitable to the
<PB N="8" REF="027249_0007_0FD3EC018169C548"/>lady ship's desire. Finding her life to be in danger unless she was gratified, I was last night dispatched to Hell to procure a new pattern from the best artists there; and having got it, I was going post to France, to assist my lady's mantua-ma∣ker in cutting and finishing it: which done, I suppose I shall have a trip to London, to accommodate the countess of <HI>Prude∣land</HI> with a suit against the next court-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! the courtly Fastosus become mantua-ma∣ker! I should never have thought of such an employment, for my part. You have <HI>now</HI> descended low indeed, uncle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Avaro, your ignorance almost provokes me to be angry with you. But you need not be so much surprised at my concerns with the mantua-makers; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as∣sure you, that I am so much admired for my skill in dress, by both sexes of the human race, that there is scarcely a suit of cloaths made either for man or woman, without my direc∣tion. Nor shall you find a peruke-maker hardy enough to venture a wig on the block, ere he has had my opinion of it. In short cousin, there is very little done, and in dress, there is nothing done, in high life or low, but I have a hand in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have offended, my honoured uncle, I humbly beg your pardon; I assure you, I said nothing out of disrespect to you: we all know that your spirit is princely, your mo∣narchy great, and your dominion very extensive. But in∣deed I never thought of your being conversant with taylors, barbers and mantua makers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nephew, I am not angry. Nevertheless, you ought to revere me as your elder and better, and not take upon you to call in question the truth of what I say. As for the barbers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are a set of transformists established wholly by my dexterity; and but for my sovereignty over man, these transformations had never been introduced. Now the transforming trade goes on so successfully, that there is rea∣son to hope very many will be at last transformed into the likeness and nature of our sable fraternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="027249_0008_0FD3CE472D82C1C0"/>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, uncle, be not angry with me, if I don't speak altogether as you would have me, for you know I never had any inclination to learning or politeness; and I cannot help expressing my wonder at some things you say. Besides, I am amazed to see you look so thin; why you look like a skeleton! What have you been doing, or where have you been? By your looks, you might have travelled bare-footed to the Holy-land, or crept on your hands and feet to Medina, and wept forty days by the tomb of our dear friend Maho∣met. You have not been on pilgrimage, sure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, from what I had said, you might have known that I have not been on pilgrimage very lately; tho' I assure you, I have often travelled to Jerusalem and to Mec∣ca as a guide to those holy pilgrims. There is not one of all the bare-legged travellers who will stir their foot from home, till their good friend Fastosus is equipped in palmerian ha∣biliments, to press forward in the van as their protector. Nor are these pilgrims my only vassals, for the superstitious of all denominations have with one consent devoted them∣selves to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but uncle, I am sure they worship me with sincere regard, as well as they do you; and I either attend them in person, or pour my influences upon every one of them, in all their religious journies to Jerusalem, Mecca, or elsewhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, Avaro; but their prostitution to co∣vetousness hinders not their devotion to pride: for I have conducted many of this fraternity to the supposed sepulchre of Jesus of Nazareth, who in their own opinion were made so holy thereby, that when they returned to their native country, they thought the earth itself unworthy to bear the pressure of a foot, which had trod the threshold of the ador∣ed sepulchre. These religious adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>res (especially if they obtain some precious relicks, of which there are great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>store in Palestine) generally list them so far above their fellow-creatures, that thenceforward they can hold no intercourse
<PB N="10" REF="027249_0009_0FD3CD8A5FB2AB78"/>with the common people, lest their supposed spotless gar∣ments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be polluted with worldly filthiness. Nor is it uncommon for these fantastical devotees to imagine, that by their journies to Judea they have gained considerably above the price of heaven. So that when they come to die, they have holiness sufficient for themselves, and a handsome lega∣cy to bequeath, as an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-out to some poor brother who loves home better than the Holy-land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Fastosus, but then you may thank my brother Falax and me for your Jerusalem journies: none of them would have been instituted but through falshood, deceit, and covetousness. And I really think that we did excellent ser∣vice to the great Belzebub and the sublime port of Hell, in impesing that cheat upon mankind. Though by the way, one would wonder that the reasonable mind should be so easy deceived, seeing there is nothing in any of these pilgrimages that has so much as the appearance of religion.</P>
<P>Often have I laughed in my sleeve, to see the foolish pil∣grims, with holy awe and profound reverence, approach a log of rotten wood, fully believing it to be part of the cross on which Immanuel was crucified. Oh! how have I seen them congratulate themselves on their supposed happiness, if by any means they had procured a diminutive chip of an old go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st; from the hand of a venerable priest, with his holy word upon it, that it was part of the cross! And to speak the truth, which you know I am not very fond of, these re∣verend gentlemen have words and wood equally plenty; for when one log is sold off, they immediately replace it with a∣nother; so that this market will not stop for want of mer∣chandise whilst there is a tree left in the forest of Lebanon. I would not on any account, that the world should know that traffic in relicks is all a cheat, by the help whereof my dear children the Jerusalem priests get more money for chips of rotten wood, than the greatest merchant in Norway gets for his masts, and yards, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="027249_0010_0FD3CDADC5452EA0"/>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what you say, and I own it to be right, cou∣sin, you and I must share the persons and divide the spoil be∣twixt us on the day of reckoning. You and cousin Falax have laid the snare very craftily, and I by my haughty influ∣ences, drive the fools to it. Good Avaro, your game would not go well without my assistance; and while you and I continue to play into each others hand, we can readily bring the two fools to meet each deceiving and being deceived. I mean, we can bring the covetous fool and the credulous fool together. The credulous deceives the covetous fool with his money, and the covetous deceives the credulous with his rotten wood. Dear Avaro, our work goes forward apace, and we shall have them both at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt of it, Fastosus; for both the covetous and over credulous are ours by common consent. Our game could not well go better than it doth at present, for all ranks and degrees of people are subjected to our potent sway. No doubt but you have heard of that noble piece of architecture called the Triple-Crown, which I and my brother Falax made for our very worthy friend and stedfast ally the POPE of ROME.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heard of it? surely I have; was not I the prin∣cipal person concerned in the work? But Avaro, you have an ugly way of denying people the due honours of their la∣bour. But for me, His holiness would never have thought of such an invention. And as I had the principal hand in it, I ever, that the best mathematician in hell could not have in∣vented a more excellent piece. I have thought, ever since, that the artful Falax acted his part with as much dexterity in the formation of that capital ornament, as when he and we as∣sisted our venerable friend, Mahomet in composing the Al∣coran, But the chief beauty of it was, to see our hoaty friend the Pope, with greater confidence than if he had been oue of ourselves, exalt his papal chair above all that is cal∣led God. So that now, in the sense of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>omish impost∣or, saving and damning depend no longer on the justice and
<PB N="12" REF="027249_0011_0FD3CD87AAFEED70"/>mercy of the Eternal, but upon the will and pleasure of him who fills the infallible chair.</P>
<P>Were we any thing but Devils, whose hatred to Truth is implacable, it would have grieved us to see how she sighed and sobbed, as if her heart would break, when the Impost∣or assumed the character of infallibility. She knocked with violence at the gates of the bishop's palace; but there was no admission for her there.—She begged and prayed that the inferior ranks of the reverend clergy would receive her; but not one of them would suffer her to come under their roof; so that the poor heaven born lady swooned in the streets, and there was none to assist her. Her eyes became as fountains of briny tears, trickling down her radiant cheeks; her locks were dishevelled, and her apparel hung dangling around her. In this mournful plight she went through all the streets of the mystic Babylon, uttering her lamentation in every public place, and in every concourse of the people. But as in former times she had piped to mens, and none of the worshippers of the Beast would dance; so now she mourned to them, but none of them would lament. She stretched forth her hands all the day long, but none of them would attend to to her; the venerable pope, father of the world, having published a decree, that none of them should suffer her under their roof, nor administer the least comfort to her in her calamity, under pain of the Rack, the Gibbet, the Wheel, or Fire and Faggot. Yea more,— when his Holiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the importunity of Divine truth, and perceived that the would be a perpetual thorn in his side, if not timely and wisely prevented by forcing her out of the world, clad himself in Vulcanian armour, sought for her in every corner of Babylon; when he met with her, launch∣ed his fatal spear with papal force against her, that wound∣ing her so deeply, she fainted and sell to the ground, and no doubt had died if she had not been immortal. When the most holy bishop had thus deprest her, he cried out in devi∣lish triumph, "<HI>I am the successor of Peter. The Vicar of
<PB N="13" REF="027249_0012_0FD3CE49D6366E90"/>Christ. The pillar of Truth, the Porter of Heaven, and the Supreme head of the church.</HI>" At which words, Truth entirely disappeared and to this da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has not been suffered to set one foot within the limits of the papacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a noble enterprize; nothing could exceed it. I am persuaded, that the man who was in-dwelt by our brother Legion, and resided among the tombs, was never capable of coming so near to us Devils in cruelty, deceit, and falsehood, as that same venerable man, his infallible ho∣liness, hath upon every occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Avaro, Legion, though a many-viced de∣vil, is but a fool when compared to his Holiness; but it is highly necessary that he should be well qualified in devilism, seeing he is appointed Belzebub's great vicegerent in the Christian world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great are the abilities requisite to such a station; and his holiness possesseth them liberally. Did you ever hear, Fastosus, the manner in which our Italian success was re∣ceived by Belzebub the great, and his infernal nobility?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose I have; but I have so many things to think of, that at present it has escaped my memory: there∣fore if you remember it, I shall be obliged to you for the re∣cital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart; I assure you it is well worth your hearing, for thereby it appeared that hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> infernal maje∣sty had the deepest sense of our services and conceived the strongest hope of the increase of his kingdom from the alli∣ance formed betwixt the sublime Port of Hell, and the apo∣stolic chair at Rome.</P>
<P>As soon as swift-winged Fame arrived at the gate, known by the name of Earth-Gate, she knocked violently, as you know is customary with her upon any emergent occasion; our friend Cerberus, the porter, no sooner saw that it was Fame but he immediately sent a messenger to court, to in∣form his majesty and peers, that the ambassadress Fame
<PB N="14" REF="027249_0013_0FD3CE4AEBCA9A10"/>was arrived. In shorter time th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a lie, Hell was all in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uproar, every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with expectation of some important new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ends on earth. Fifty of the nobility were dispatched from court, to congratulate Fame on her arrival, and to conduct her in state to the court-end of the city. The mighty Belzebub ascended the flaming throne, to receive the ambassadress with imperial grandeur; and as soon as arrived she was in∣troduced to his sublime presence by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ucifer, prime minister of state, and in full court related all that had passed concerning the change at Rome in the system of religion: which desirable news was received with all the demonstrations of joy damn∣ed spirits are capable of. Fame having finished her rela∣tion, the mighty prince, who sat on the stupendous throne, arrayed in all the majesty becoming his elevated station, lift∣ed his warlike arm, waved the imperial sceptre for audi∣ence, and thus addressed his courtiers, his eyes blazing as burning furnaces, while he spake.</P>
<P>"My lords, my brethren in sovereignty and sharers of my glory, from the just sense I have of your steady attach∣ment to my interest and government, as hath always ap∣peared from your unwearied study as far as possible to destroy the creatures of our arch-enemy, whom, constrained, we call the Almighty; and promoting to the utmost our com∣mon interest among mankind. From such considerations, I cannot forbear congratulating your highnesses on the hap∣py turn our affairs on the earth have taken, by the indefatig∣able pains and vigilant endeavours of our worthy friends and genuine descendants, Fastosus, Avaro, Falax, &amp;c. &amp;c. as appears by the report you have just now heard from the month of our swift-winged ambassadress, Fame. By the industry of those worthy spirits, worms of the earth are wrought up to such a degree of pride and self concrit, as to undertake enterprizes that we, who are of angelic race, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not accomplish; yea, even to assume prerogatives which never once came into our minds. My noble lords,
<PB N="15" REF="027249_0014_0FD3CE2684B0C670"/>there is reason to believe that this revolution will prove a leading step towards a very plentiful harvest. I signify it therefore as my will and pleasure, that your highnesses take special care that the lodgings at the court-end of the city are kept in due repair, as henceforth we may expect at every term, numerous shoals of popish priests of all ranks, to take up their residence with us; and you may be sure they will take it very ill, if they are not accommodated according to their quality.</P>
<P>"I think, my lords, it is worthy of observation, that all the missionaries we ever dispatched among the heathens, could not prevail with poor pagan priests to aspire to that degree of impiety which the pope hath now assumed. I hope, my lords, that Truth and Holiness are in a fair way of being banished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the face of the earth; for I am persuaded, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> universal father, his cardinals, legates and bishops, will ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> all their influence to promote our interest in the suppression of our enemies." Having said this, a flaming billow rolled over the imperial seat, and so sturmed the good old prince, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould speak no more for a season.</P>

<P>This bag, sir, contains a thousand pounds, which a certain attorney, a dear child of mine, wants to have deposited in some place of security, as he has not at present an opportunity of putting it out to generate, an in∣creasing faculty with which all his other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is endued. This fame gentleman is a person of great worth, ready to assist the rich and great, provided always that his good deeds are handsomely rewarded. But so cautions and pru∣dent is he, that he utterly abhors parting with even so small a pittance as a guinea, to relieve a poor distressed trades∣man; and indeed for this very sufficient reason that he can∣not, in such a case, obtain land-security for his money; so that if the poor man is ever so honest and industrious, he
<PB N="16" REF="027249_0015_0FD3CE2DE3D64930"/>must even reconcile his thoughts to a dungeon, or seek relief from another quarter; for our worthy lawyer would part with no money to deliver him from it. His present fear is, lest any of his poor neighbours, knowing that he has plenty of money by him, should, by their pressing solicitations, over-persuade him to part with a little to help them in their distresses; for he, like many other honest men, is determin∣ed to keep what he has got, if one half of the parish should die for want of bread.</P>

<P>By your description of the worthy lawyer, I may expect his children as my pupils after his decease. I war∣rant me, Avaro, before their father is half consumed by the worms, I shall have them bowing and cringing to me as their god. I have remarked for some thousands of years, that when the parents have worshiped the god Avaro, by giving themselves up to covetousness, for the most part, af∣ter their decease, the children have made choice of me and my cousin Profanity for their patrons. Surely, if covet∣ous parents knew, what courses their children would follow when their heads are laid low in the grave, and their souls still lower in Hell, they would quarrel with their god Ava∣ro, or die with grief on the prospect.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, uncle, but there is not one of my nume∣rous disciples who knows me by my proper name: and I am by far too subtle for them to find out the cheat. My English vassals, for instance, commonly worship me under the false names of industry or frugality, prudence or lauda∣ble care; but there is not one of them who can be prevailed with to believe himself a worshipper of the devil Avaro, which is, you know, my true and proper name.</P>

<P>Nothing equals our success; for you damn the parents by covetousness, and we damn the children by pride and profanity. Good Avaro, we have them hip and thigh; it is but a sew of all the mundane race that we lose; and those also we should have, if they were not forcibly ta∣ken from us: but this is one comfort, that if we must have

<P>Hells, did you say? Right, hells ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed! One holy inquisitor goes beyond an hundred of our fraternity in the art of cruelty, which you know is the first of the learned sciences at Rome. Such wonderful inventions for torturing, one would have thought could never have been contrived What ingen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity does the rack display! How excel∣lently formed for exquisite torture! What an apt resemblance of the insernal furnace is the dry-pan! A contrivance worthy the most skilful among the Belzebubian artists▪ But their watry torment, the gag and pitcher, is what raises the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most in my esteem. Almost every block head bath some no∣tion of a hell of fire; but it is peculiar to the skill of an ho∣ly inquisitor to contrive a hell of water. In this, Fastosus, we must all knock under to them, for indeed they are our betters. And to enhance their merit, their torments are inflicted upon the unhappy wretches who fall into their hands, under a shew of the greatest sanctity towards God, and pity to the unhappy victim of their cruelty. And so very strict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y do they and their assisting familiars observe the rules of inviolable secrecy, that the world can never know the hundredth part of their villainy.</P>

<P>Secrecy is indispensably necessary to a people so much devoted to our interest as the worthy inquisitors and the rest of the Romish clergy are. Were it known to the world what methods they take to aggrandize themselves, and sup∣port the papal hierarchy, the cheat would be discovered, the fabric would fall to the ground, the craft by which they have their wealth would soon be at an end, and their reverences be brought into contempt</P>

Certainly the great Belzebub will deal gratefully with the holy father at Rome, and his cardinals, inquisitors, and bi∣shops, when they arrive in Hell▪ For my own part, I stedfastly believe that if our good friends the popes and in∣quisitors are not served below their quality they will be put in possession of the seats on the right-hand of his maje∣sty's throne, as our friend Mahomet and his musties were in those on the left. And when their extraordinary merit is considered, our infernal nobility will have no need to grumble at their advancement; for nothing less can be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emed adequate to their uncommon merit and usefulness in confirming our dominion over mankind.

<P>Wonderfully adapted, sir! very wonderfully a∣dapted; for money forwards their devotion vastly, and helps them strangely on in their way to heaven. Dear children of mine I own them to be! for, notwithstanding their pre∣tended love to devotion and the souls of their fellow crea∣tures; if a poor man travelling from earth to heaven, should happen to be arrested by any of the officers of purgatory, (who make it their business to way lay travellers) and be turned over to the tormentors; if such a man has not lest a fufficient sum for purgatorial masses, and no well-disposed lay-person is found to supply the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficient assets of the pri∣soner, he may lye, if it be possible, till he is burned to tin∣der, ere any parson of the convent will put one hand to help him out of those dreary flames. But on the other hand if a sufficient sum is left for masses to be said to the lady of Loretto, St Dominic. St Dennis, or any other eloquent saint, all the parsons will apply as cheerfully as young dromedaries, and put their shoulders to the work like so many bulls in a yoke till they have cleared him of his prison.

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II. FASTOSUS and AVARO.</HEAD>
<P>BEING acquainted with the appointment, I chose to wait for their coming, but was so alarmed at what I had heard and seen, that I lurked close in my retreat, not daring to attempt any discoveries. At the time appointed I per∣ceived them walking up the valley; and as they drew near,</P>
<P>FASTOSUS said, Yes, Avaro, I assure you there was great joy in the court of Versailles on account of my ar∣rival, and that both among the French and English ladies: the latter of whom are the humble servile imitators of the former; which tends so to chagrine some, and give plea∣sure to others of them; that by this means contentions run very high among the French ladies. One part complains of the English as no more than the apes of the French; these are they who would monopolize all the finery to them∣selves; therefore their censure of the English ladies is not to be regarded; the others boast of their superiority, and are not a little proud of their dominion over the fair Angli∣cans; who, they suppose, dare not attempt to introduce so much as the pattern of a head-dress, till it hath had the ap∣probation of the French▪ But to drop this for the present, Avaro I shall be glad to hear the story you mentioned be∣fore we parted</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was this, sir, There was a gentleman in Pro∣vence, a steady member of the holy Roman eatholic church, who died lately, and as soon as dead, his pious relations made his death known to their reverences the priests, in order to procure their good offices in behalf of their depart∣ed friend, whose soul, it was upon no ill ground feared, was hardly while enough for heaven, and would therefore be obliged to call at Purgatory, for an effectual cleansing, are be could proceed further on his journey. The venera∣He priests no sooner heard of the gentleman's death, than
<PB N="22" REF="027249_0021_0FD3CE27DC013C38"/>they prudently began to consult the good of the church, and what means appeared to them the most likely to feather their own nest; as this must needs be done, either by the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or death of the laity. This being their sole intent, it was unanimously agreed to refer themselves to my direction, and an interview in the apartments of the principal was re∣quested. Being at that time in the neighbouthood I im∣mediately granted their petition, and presented myself a∣mong them, in the principal's chamber; a place very fa∣miliar to me. The reverend old father was no sooner a∣ware of my arrival, than he arose from his seat, fell pro∣strate before me, to do me humble greeting, withal ex∣pressing the most grateful sense of my care and condescen∣sion, in coming so soon to their assistance.</P>
<P>Humble salutation past, the principal addrest me in the following learned manner: "Worshipful Prudence," for that is the name I am known by among them, "we have an affair of great importance to lay before you; and with the profoundest humility will we thank you for your advice."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Avaro if you talk any thing about that same humility, I'll not stay a moment longer, for I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the nature of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not be offended, sir, for the gentlemen in question have as little of that as your heart could wish for. It is not the nature but the mere name of humility which serves the purposes of priest-craft: and which he and his brethren so much admired. And you know, sir, that the name without the nature of humility is nothing but pride in disguife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am glad they have no more of it for that humility is a fellow whom I abhor; but I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hank my stars it is very seldom that I meet with him; however, when he and I do meet, we as naturally quarrel as the ele∣phant and the rhinoceros</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assured them of my assistance, and the old par∣son
<PB N="23" REF="027249_0022_0FD3CE59FB6886D0"/>went on with his story; "Oh! thou prie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>governing spirit, said he, thou must know, that about eleven of the clock, last night, a neighbouring gentleman went out of this into the other world, leaving behind him an estate, upwards of ten thousand pounds per annum, devolving to an only son, and to this convent has left no more than four score crowns, for the salutary work of delivering his poor soul from the dread∣ful flames of purgatory. I do not know, indeed, but our great lady, whom we serve, might be satisfied with half the sum; but we thy serzants are not so easily pleased. It is our pious desire to procure as much of the young man's estate, as by any means we can, for our own private use; as none of us can tell what we may want before we die. Besides, we do not know but so large an estate devolving anincumbered upon him, may be the means of ruining the soul and body of the inexperienced youth. Now, we, as the holy guardians of his salvation, think it needssary, for the good of his soul, to cut off as much as we can of the fuel of his lusts: well knowing how dangerous riches are to the laity. Thus, great patron, I have revealed the pi∣ous intent of our venerable brotherhood; and, lovely spirit, if thou canst by thy advice serve us in this matter, we in∣treat thee to do it; for our eyes are to thee, and our hearts are open to receive thy instructions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who could have thought, Avaro, of any of your disciples being disposed to such exalted piety? Howe∣ver, it was piety of the true Romish stamp, greatly admired by the venerable clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, said!, most reverend father, let not your pious mind be afflicted about the young gentleman's soul. Let you and your worthy brethren observe my instructions, and I shall undertake to put you in possession of the greatest part of his estate; which, as you justly observe, will great∣ly redound to the fasety of his soul.</P>
<P>Be sure that you bury the old gentleman with as much s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing forrow and devotion as might be expected from a
<PB N="24" REF="027249_0023_0FD3CE2CC3087570"/>well paid parson; yea, with as much feigned courtesy to the heir, as if the deceased had left you five hundred pounds. Then be sure to say mass for him to your la∣dy, St. Dominic, St. Francis, or to the saint of your con∣vent, as soon as possible. That being done let a skilful messenger from your reverences wait on the son and heir, to tell him that, alas! his poor father is got much dee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er into purgatory than was expected, on account of some sins he had concealed from his confessor: which sins, because they are hidden, will take a great deal of burning unless expiated in time, by frequent masses▪ Tell him that you are not certain, but you hope, about two hundred crowns, laid out in masses to some favourite, loquacious faint, may go near to procure his deliverance. This news will probably so surprize the youth, that the messenger will receive the money, and his hearty prayers into the bar∣gain: for if he is a good churchman, it will not be easy to pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de him that your reverences only aim at picking his pockets.</P>
<P>Having received the money, you must take care not to go any more to the young gentleman, till the time that all the masses might have been said; then go to him again, and tell him that by servent application, you have at last got his father's soul within a few yards of the surface of the flames, that you cannot possibly restore him an inch farther till more masses are said for him; and that you think an hundred crown's worth more may, in all probability clear him: this being received, take care not to visit him too soon, but wait till another quantity of masse might have been said. At a proper time, go to him again, expatiate much upon the piety of your brethren tell him, that by their endeavours, his father was quite discharged from the court of Purgatory, and was ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> going to be turned out at the heaven-end of the town, when it happened, most un∣luckily, that there came up the soul of a woman, whom he had debauched in his life-time; that this malicious woman
<PB N="25" REF="027249_0024_0FD3CE5B3010B3E8"/>had brought an action against him, the bill was found, and the poor old gentleman condemned to fiercer burnings than before, which may last for many years, unless a speedy sup∣ply of money is granted to procure friends in heaven to in∣tercede for his release. This scheme will procure you double the former sums: you know, father, hidden sins take a great deal of burning.</P>
<P>Six or eight months afterwards, go to the young gentle∣man again, and tell him that you laid out his last money to the best advantage, that with it you procured half a dozen of the best orator's in heaven, to plead his father's cause; who, by their fervent supplications, had at last prevailed; that the old gentleman was delivered from his torments, and was led in triumph to the gates, to be dispatched immediately for glory. But, as his unlucky stars would have it, just as the porter opened the gate, there came up the soul of a mendicant friar whom the old gentleman had in his life time unhappi∣ly beat, and now openly accused him of this almost unpar∣donable crime: on which account he was remanded back to more exquisite torments than ever. Tell the young gentle∣man that this unhappy accident caused such grief to the bre∣thren, that there is hardly any one of them able to say Ave-Maria; and that some of them intend, as soon as their strength will admit, to go to Jerusalem, to try if by any means they can procure his deliverance at the holy cross or sepulchre.</P>
<P>You know very well, reverend father, in what tender and pious strain to tell your story; and to make it penetrate the deeper, you can shed a few crocodile tears over it: if you manage wisely, you may in this case, sell your tears at more than a crown each. Be sure thus always to find out some impediment or other to the old man's release; you may bring him often to the gates, but if once you let him go through, all your hopes are over from this quarter. Care should also be taken to inform the young heir of the tremen∣dous
<PB N="26" REF="027249_0025_0FD3CE5C2F35FFA0"/>curses the pope has denounced against those impious children, who enjoy their wealth and ease, whilst they suf∣fer their poor unhappy parents to lie roasting in purgatory, rather than pay the priests for delivering them.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was what I was going to tell you, sir, for, continued I, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sir, young '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quire great purse should have sa∣gacity enough to see through your scheme, and deny you the money, let one of your most devout brethren assume the ghost, from night to night haunt his dwelling, and in an ar∣ticulate manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, utter, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>he name of the father deceased, the most dreadful curses against his undutiful son, who possesseth a large estate in peace and pleasure, whilst his poor father lies broiling in the flames of purgatory.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so, as you shall hear, for I had no sooner finished, but the aged father, who was not likely to live to say many more masses, arose, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears in his eyes, thanked me a thousand times for my cordial advice: pro∣testing that nothing could be better adapted to the end pro∣posed, or more agreeable to the principles both of him and his brothren: assuring me that they would follow my direc∣tions as invariably as Saturn does his orbit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this account of the Romish priests it appears that they are at no loss for merchandise. Purgatorial fire, holy water, masses, dispensations, pardons, &amp;c. are commo∣dities which do not require a very large capital, and yet are attended with considerable prones. The great parsons, over and above the tythe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the lands, have very advantageous
<PB N="27" REF="027249_0026_0FD3CE5DA954CF80"/>craft by this means: but between you and me, cousin, it is all the merchandize of the scarlet strumpet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be dangerous to our interest if the world should know the truth. Then our great vicegerent would be worshipped as a god no more; the wondrous beast which ascended out of the sea of ignorance and error would be torn limb from limb, and his carcase be given to the hawks and ravens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then I find that you are a papist as well as me. I myself have large concerns among the clergy, and with none more than his holiness the pope, the great parson at Rome, the parson of the parsons. This universal parson, though he pretends to be descended from Peter my enemy, hath conceived such a good opinion of my abilities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> will not make a decree, nor publish a bull, till I have put the finishing hand to it. You know, cousin, that I am none of those who are backward in shewing their opinion, but rea∣dily dictate to all who refer themselves to my direction. As to his holiness, notwithstanding he is the father of the whole church, he is my humble servant; and, as I said before, consults me upon all occasions. The advice that I give, in general, is, that by all means he take care to keep up his au∣thority over the consciences and liberties of mankind: and the same advice I give to the clergy in general; hence eve∣ry parson attempts to reign within his own district, despotic and supreme over the consciences of the people, who are o∣bliged under pain of damnation to honour him as the pleni∣potentiary of heaven, and the arbitrary distributer of bles∣sings and curses. I advise his holiness at all events, to sup∣port his infallibility beyond the scriptures of truth, and his supremacy above the laws of God or man. This same ad∣vice I whisper in the ear of my clergy in general, who, to a man, agree that the scriptures shall not pass with toleration, unless it is drest in the garb of their interpretations; as such, and only as such, it is imposed on their parishoners. The good old vicar never contradicts any thing I say, notwith∣standing
<PB N="28" REF="027249_0027_0FD3CE600CA17D70"/>he knows at the same time, his pretensions to be a cheat; but to the utmost of his power follows the directions of his adored Fastosus; and never did mortal man shew more implicit obedience to the monarch of darkness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then the papists worship his holiness the pope, and he worships the devil Fastosus. Is not this the system of the popish divinity in a few words, uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so; and a system adhered to by many who are called protestants: for with such love to wealth and honour have you and I inspired them, that although as rea∣sonable beings they must know that the Almighty ruler will bring their ways into impartial scrutiny, and judge them for their salacious guide: yet for the sake of worldly riches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honor, at all events they resolutely follow our directions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Aye, sir, that is the heaven of the priests: they both seek and have their reward. The fat of the land is in their possession, and they are honored as the directors of conscience. And yet they are the successors of the apostles, who had neither silver nor gold; and yet they are the mi∣nisters of Jesus, who would not receive honors from men. And yet they are the most humble creatures that ever lived; and yet it is death to contradict them.</P>

<P>Having made sure of the mighty father of the world, his holiness of Rome, to join issue with us in promot∣ing our interest among men; I have an excellent device to insure all the other ranks of his dependent clergy to our in∣terest likewise. The patriarchs and cardinals are sure to prove loyal to the pope, and of consequence to us, from a hope which I have inspired every one of them with, of one day ascending the papal throne himself. The loyalty of the arch-bishops is insured by the hope of a cardinal's hat, and their right reverences the bishops, are sure to remain inof∣fensive animals, in hope of attaining, in some future period, the archi-episcopal dignity. The same device runs through all the other ranks of the clergy, and thereby they are all

<P>Hah, gentlemen! are you here? I did not think of meeting with you, my dear friends and fellow de∣stroyers. How do you do, Fastosus? and how do you, Avaro?</P>

<P>We are pretty well, cousin; only jaded a little with constant application to business. But pray, Crudelis, how have you been employed of late?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Employed, do you say? never fear me. I have not been idle, I assure you. Do you suppose that I can pick up no game in Britain in this golden-age? If you do, you are greatly mistaken. It is true that some of the late kings of England have been my avowed enemies, and as far as in them lay have expelled me the kingdom. But be they as vigilant as they will, I find opportunity of breaking through the fences which they have reared against me: when you may be sure if I cannot get great, I pick up small game; of which I can only give you a very small specimen at present. In one place I persuaded an ambitious child to poison, or otherwise kill, an old cumbersome parent, who will not die without violent measures. I prevail with a rogue to dispatch his woman, and her brat, to preserve his own reputation and estate. In a third, I stir up an ambiti∣ous
<PB N="30" REF="027249_0029_0FD3CF41B63DB248"/>servant to kill and plunder his master; and frequently I can prevail with one gentleman to kill another in a duel, on some punctilio of false honor. And sometimes, I persuade the despairing wretch to lay hands on himself, destroy his own miserable life, and by doing so enter upon another in∣finitely more miserable. Then I take to my heels, and am followed with a hue and cry all over the nation. But thank you, I am two swift for them all: I never give them time to say, "Cradelis is here." But they often say, "these are the tricks of that horrid devil, Crudelis."</P>
<P>Yesterday I was attending a duel, which I myself stirred up, (as I suppose you know that all duels are of my instiga∣tion) so it was here, I persuaded the gentlemen combatants to fight with sword and pistol, hoping that both would have fallen in the action. But though my design was good, as ill luck would have it, it miscarried, and only one of them bit the ground; however, I am not without hope that the other will be hanged for the murder, and if so, then I have my de∣sign. I assure you, gentlemen, I use my utmost endea∣vours to throng the nether regions. O my brother destroy∣ers! I could tell you such stories as would make you bless yourselves, and adore the prince Crudelis. These are but trifling things, thrown in to whet your appetite against the next opportunity. Then you shall hear. But for this time I must be going. Adien, gentry, for I smell blood at a distance.</P>

<P>'Tis amazing what power this deformed fiend hath obtained over mankind: what ill, so very different from the principles of humanity, that he hath by his barbarous insinuations introduced. What is very surprizing, he hath made mankind more cruel to one another, than we infernal spirits are among ourselves. He stirs them up to destroy and devour one another; but we are never known to quar∣rel among ourselves, nor to make war upon our own race: be that the part of foolish man; we devils are masters of better policy. This very Crudelis himself, sanguine as he
<PB N="31" REF="027249_0030_0FD3CF436BB23BC8"/>is to devour blinded mortals, lays aside all his voracity when he joins our black assembly, and is as tame a devil as any of us. Well may you and I destroy with success, when such a deformed lump of hell as Crudelis, is made welcome among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But with your leave, sir, as Crudelis is gone, let us resume our discourse. I remember before he inter∣rupted us, you briefly hinted that you were somewhat addict∣ed to religion, and that you are a papist too. I was never wont to consider you as a religious devil, much less did I think that you assumed to yourself any of those distinctions, which divide the professedly Christian world. I thought formerly that, the great Fastosus had dwelt only in king's courts, with people of soft raiment, and occasionally wait∣ed on the nobility and gentry, at their country-seats. What the devil, Fastosus, a papist too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In reality, Avaro, (to make use of a human phrase) your ignorance is enough to provoke the very devil. Do not you know yet, that if I were not Jack of all trades and religions, I could never maintain my sway over men as I do. I have very great concern in religions matters, I as∣sure you, and that among more denominations than some people like to hear of. Sometimes I am among the Pagans worshipped a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an arch-flamin, and president of all their religious orders. Very frequently I have the honor of filling the papal chair, then I am adored under the venera∣ble names of Pious, Innocent, Benedict, &amp;c. accounted the universal pastor, head of the church, and father of the whole world. Occasionally, I sit as judge in the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in∣quisitive tribunal, where Concupiscentia and I are adored as divinities. Now I am an holy mussulman, and stiled, his reverence mufti Muly Alab. Then, before you are a∣ware, I am shut up in a cloister with the nuns and friars, whom I make more proud of their pretended chastity than a thousand saints of their real graces; on such occasions, I am known by the name of the venerable matron Humility.
<PB N="32" REF="027249_0031_0FD3CF44AF82EEF0"/>It happens also, that I am obliged to metamorphose myself into a capuchine, or a Palmerian friar, and in that shew of self denial I beg my bread from door to door; by these means I teach the fantastical devotees to be more proud of their awkard form, and voluntary humility, than a wise carl would be of all his landgraviate. Anon, I change my station, and find myself an abbot of a convent, where my depending priests and brethren worship me under the name of the holy father. Then, very soon after you'll find me attending the worthy confessor in his visitation, when to be sure I persuade his self-conceited reverence that he is well nigh as pure as the most holy mother pope Joan, a fortunate lady, who a few centuries ago became head of the church, and mother of the whole world. The hermit, in his cell, on the mountains of Ararat, frequently offers his adorations to me, and for my part, in return for his obsequiousness, I am in no wise sparing of my exalting influence. I persuade the world-abdicating wretch that, his solitary residence in that holy asylum, far more than merits a mansion in heaven, and at his peril that he stir not one foot from thence, to go down into an ungodly world: the mountain top, or a cell in the desart, being the best place imaginable in which to merit everlasting glory. The worthy hermit admits my doctrine to be true, his favour∣ite passion is gratified, and he obeys implicitly my direc∣tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then his eremitical reverence never questions the goodness of his heart, I perceive, He knows not that he carries a spring of iniquity within himself, even to the desart, or the mountain's top.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he fears no evil from within. If he gets to a distance remote enough from the rest of mankind, he can repose the greatest confidence in his own heart; and thereby proclaim his folly to all the world. I assure him that, if he will remain during his life in his cell, when he comes to die he will have holiness sufficient for himself;
<PB N="33" REF="027249_0032_0FD3CF46348C9360"/>and a large redundancy, by which he may help some poor friend out of purgatory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! how different was Paul's doctrine from yours and the hermits, Fastosus! He asserted that by the works of the law no flesh living should be justified; but you and he believe that by the works of the law a man may be more than justified. Yea, that by observing of things no where commanded in the law, such as forsaking society, counting beads, and mumbling prayers, he may, not only justify himself, but help another to justification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Avaro, the hermit believes so, but for my part I believe no such thing. I know better, though I thus delude him. But to pass on with my story, I can tell you, I have a good deal of employment among your dis∣ciples, cousin, and with them I work wonders of compell∣ed generosity. I meet with many who never had the heart to perform one virtuous, benevolent action whilst health continued; who, when they perceive that they must come to a reckoning in the other world, are very assiduous to have their accounts balanced aforehand. I persuade them to leave a massy sum to this hospital, to the other parish, or to certain meeting-houses. When I thus direct the will of devotees, one leaves gold enough to build a chapel for our lady, a second doth the like for St. Peter, and a third for St. Dominic. But in general they are most fond of saints of their own rearing, the greatest part of whom are now made constellations in the nether sky, and courtiers to the prince Belzebub. Ask you me, Avaro, what end the tes∣tator has in those pious legacies? I tell you, by this time he sees the manner in which he got and kept his money, has not the least endency to save him from destruction; and he knows but one way to avert the impending judgment, that is to leave his so and so gotten money for the good of the church, and that, he is told, never fails to sanctify e∣very measure taken to procure it. Some of those deluded testators are not without hope that, in some future period,
<PB N="34" REF="027249_0033_0FD3CF47B1569998"/>their names will be enrolled in the pope's bible; and their shrines adored in the Christian pantheon, at Rome, where all the gods of the papal hierarchy are enshriued.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Fastosus. I really think that if the papists would act in character, they would dedicate their temples to St. Judas, St. Demas, St. Demetrins, St. Alexander the copper-smith, &amp;c. for they are the genuine offspring of those celebrated heroes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their very descendants, cousin. You and I who know what we see, can discern no essential difference be∣tween the holy Roman Catholic religion, and that of the an∣cient pagans. It was the most excellent device imaginable to introduce paganism under the specious shew of orthodox and infallible Christianity. And I can tell you, there is no essential difference between the popish religion and that of some sects of very staunch protestants: but those things we must keep to ourselves, for I would not for ever so much our people should know that the popish religion is diabolical.</P>
</SP>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III. INFIDELIS and IMPIATOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE way being clear by the departure of Fastosus and Avaro, I came out of my lurking place, in order to make what discoveries I could in the valley, which I now knew to be a rendezvous for those evil spirits, who so dread∣fully have enslaved mankind. I had not gone far, before my alarmed imagination transformed every thing I saw into a devil; the croaking of the raven was as dreadful as the voice of an hobgoblin; and the shrieking of the owl as ter∣rible as the roaring of Appollyon. Every distant bush seem∣ed to bear the aspect of some devouring fiend; so powerful was the influence of my imagination. Curiosity, however, had still the ascendancy over my fears; and I wandered from place to place, seeking for something new. At length, I saw at some distance, a tall gigantic form, slowly moving towards me: a form nearly as huge as the steeple of St. Cuthbert's church, at Dulmensis. Every time he contract∣ed his extensive chest, he darkened the air with the breath which issued from his expanded nostrils, as pillars of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oak from the chimney of a fire engine; smaller streams of the same darkening vapour came curling forth from his arm∣pits, and every other pore of his skin, so that wherever he came he blackened the air around him.</P>
<P>Now thought I, my life is not worth two-pence, if yon∣der demon lay hold on me: therefore I ran with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speed to the clift of the rock, where I had lurked so secure before; and having taken sanctuary in the subterraneout cell, I ga∣thered so much courage as to peep out, that I might learn what was become of the terrible monster, I saw that he was got almost at the door of my cave. Frightened I was you may be sure, nevertheless I comforted myself with the thoughts, that such a tremenduous bulk could not enter my nar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w retreat. He said to himself (his voice as he spoke
<PB N="36" REF="027249_0035_0FD3CE29368922C8"/>resembling hollow thunder) "I thought I had seen the ho∣norable Fastosus and the careful Avaro walking here just now; but I might be mistaken; or if they have been here, they are gone on our great father's business, no doubt. Well, seeing it is so, I will take a turn or two in the Vale, and then return to my business again."</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all the terror of my mind, I was eager to know what he was, and how he came hither; but durst not discover myself lest he should prove a devil of the canibal kind, which if he should, I thought that he would scarce make one mouthful of my diminutive carcase. But when he mentioned going to business again, I queried whe∣ther he might not be one of Vulcan's smiths, come out of the forge to take a refreshing walk; then I recollected, and asked myself, "If he is one of the cyclops, how came he to be acquainted with the devils Fastosus and Avaro!" I continued in this dreadful suspence for some time, till at last seeing one of his companions, he entered into discourse with him. I found that his name was INFIDELIS, and that of the other, IMPIATOR.</P>

<P>I thank you, son, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry well; notwithstanding my great age, and hurry of business, I do not find the least decay in my constitution, but rather seem to grow stronger; and indeed there is a prediction on record, that I shall be strongest at the last.</P>
<P>What pleasure does it give me, my dear Impiator, to hear that you are so successful in ensuaring the minds, and corrupting the morals of mankind, throughout every nation of the world. If what I hear of you be true, you approve yourself a right chip of the old block. I rejoice
<PB N="37" REF="027249_0036_0FD3CF4B13D554E0"/>that some of all ranks and degrees of people are so subjected to your sway. I am told that many, even of the professors of religion, fondly caress you, my son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed sir, it must not be denied that my king∣dom is in a growing condition, all over the world. I think I was hardly ever so much, and never more caressed than I am now. Even in pagan nations heretofore remarkable for uprightness and temperance, I have introduced the fashionable vices of the Christian world: so that an Indian will drink and swear even with an Englishman; and lie and cheat as fast as a Gaul or an Hollander. Greatly am I beholden to a certain company for instructing the east∣ern world in the learned arts of violence, rapine and mur∣der: not to dwell however on the conversion of the pagans to the vices of nominal Christians; much improvement has been made even in Christendom itself, of which take the following instances out of many that might be given.</P>
<P>It is not a vast number of years since your son Impiator was held in perfect disdain in Scotland; but now I have, chosen many legions of the Caledonians for myself: I think I ought rather to say, that being quite tired of the ser∣vice of sobriety, a prince of another family, they made choice of me for their ruler. But you know, father, that I am no scholar, therefore improprieties in my speech are not at all to be wondered at. However, I have reduced the Scotch to such a veneration for my once hated person, that they have cordially embraced the ornamental vices of the English nation; such as Sabbath-breaking, whoring, drunkenness, swearing, gambling, &amp;c. but whether they will be as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceessful in obtaining pensions from the govern∣ment after they have gambled away their estates, is not so easy to determine. The conquest of the Scotch, sir, is the more agreeable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because, as I said, there was a time, when those vices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardly so much as known in that country; now, who but Profanity in all their towns?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Glad Am I that my lovely child has subdued the stubborn Scotch. For I well know that the Presbyterians there, resisted your influence long after I had erected my standard in the land, yea, after multitudes flocked to it, and swore alleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance to the great Infidelis. But how my son hast thou so happily accomplished this change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, fir, I obtained help from a quarter whence there was not the greatest reason to expect it. I mean from the parsons, the spiritual guides of the people. It happen∣ed thus: the parsons of the kirk quarrelled among themselves, and divided into two parties. One of which forsook their mother kirk, and very solemnly delivered up the other par∣ty to the devil; on the other hand the reverend gentlemen who abode in the kirk, in the like spirit of devotion, de∣livered up the schismatics, parson and people to Belzebub. Belzebub, who you know is never backward in receiving a gift of this kind, finding that all the Presbyterians in Scotland were thus in full tale made over to him, laid his hands upon as many of them as he could conveniently reach, and made such use of them as greatly assisted my operations. Little was now to be heard in the palpit except railing, scolding, calling ill names, and tossing anathemas, from one party to the other: thus while they went on bandying curses, we went on persuading the people that religion is a farce, and that true happiness consists in present gratifica∣tion; and this doctrine readily affecting the heart and senses, was eagerly received, and my government established.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a favourable juncture indeed; and I have often remarked, that if there was any turn of religi∣ous affairs much in our favour, for the most part, we have parsons to thank for their assistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, many instances of this might be given.

<P>All this! know, my child. But as we are se∣cure from mortal auditors, being in Horrida Vallis: if you can spare a little time, I will give you some account of my rise and progress, perhaps it may have a happy tendency to promote your destructive designs, and so strengthen the pil∣lars of the elevated throne of great Profanity. What I re∣late, you may depend upon for truth; for although we seldom speak any thing but lies to mankind, one devil may well enough depend upon the word of another.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, that we may, sir, and I presume if mankind were to hear what passeth at our private conferences, they would not continue long so fond of our service as they are at present. As to your story, sir, I am ready to hear it, per∣naps, as you say, I may profit by it.</P>

<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my son, you will observe that I am of a very great age, well nigh as old as this world, which you see is worn quite thread-bare, and will in a little time be folded up as an old garment of no use. As to my original, I can tell you that I am well descended; of royal lineage, I assure you. Great Belzebub himself begat me, and my sister Ignorantia, on Eve, the mother of all living on earth. When I came to years of maturity, he gave me Ignorantia my fellow twin to wise; and by her I had you, with your worthy brethren, Avaro, Falax, Crudelis, and your sis∣ters Perfidia, Concupiscentia, &amp;c. At the same time my elder brother Fastosus, who had Inscientia, a lady of re∣markable beauty, given him to wife, begot on her Ambitio∣sus, Contumax, Discordans, and their sisters Malevolentia, Iracundia, and a large train of excellent worthies, famous in the annals of the nether regions,</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="027249_0039_0FD3CF51F8790BE8"/>
As soon as I was born I stood up like a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pendous wall, betwixt the creator and the creature, so that blessings of a spiritual kind, could not descend from God to man, nor could obedience ascend from man to God. One of the first things I did was to maim their moral powers, and accom∣plish an union betwixt them and my great father Belz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bub; such an union I did establish, as nothing natural shall ever be able to dissolve.</P>

<P>Hah, my sire, you began very early indeed. You spent little idle time in your infancy; and proved very suc∣cessful in your first enterprise too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no reason to complain for want of success, I assure you. But you shall hear. The very moment I was brought forth, the great Belzebub gazed upon me with all the admiration of a father infernal; and said that I was the loveliest babe his eyes ever behold, Mul∣titudes of his sable menials, flocking together, were like∣wise astonished at my beauties; such majestic grace display∣ed itself in my countenance, though then but an infant, that all agreed "I was father's own child." Moreover, such were their hopes of my usefulness, that great Belzebub, and his peers, did what they could, sparing neither pains nor expence to have me transported to hell, to be nursed up at the infernal court: believing that my presence would greatly alleviate their distress, and prevent their trembling on the thoughts of futurity. But my constitution being al∣together earthly, it was found by experience that the in∣fernal air was too hot for me, and that I could not live within the confines of the damned. Earth, my child, on∣ly earth is my habitation. Here I was born, and here I suppose I must die.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="027249_0040_0FD3CDE83333C9C0"/>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive, child, that you are no great profi∣cient in theology: as for me I have dealt against divine mat∣ters all my days. It is your province to counteract moral principles, not interfering much with things divine, and my province to oppose truth rather than promote immorali∣ty; therefore I shall inform you how it comes to pass. Know then, that what a man is when he dies, such he is in the eye of the moral law to all eternity; for death casts the dye, and the same posture in which the tree falls it must lie for ever; but with unbelief they never more agree. For instance, many of them whilst on earth could not be prevailed on to believe that there is a God, but in hell they are feelingly convinced of the truth of this doctrines. Now they believe that there is a terrible God, and that they are fallen into his dreadful hands. Search hell through all its corners; ransact every furnace in the fiery world, and you'll find never an atheist therein. Others were not quite so stupid as to imagine that this beautiful world, and all things therein came into existence of themselves, and that the oeconomy of nature is wholly effected by chances▪ there∣fore they assented to the being of God: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it en∣thusiasm to suppose that this God should subject his creatures unto a written law. They sncered at the authority of the scriptures; ridiculed every part of instituted worship; and gloried in their infidelity: but now they are sentenced to hell, and have a specimen of eternal torment, they most sincerely believe the veracity of the scriptures; finding themselves to have been judged according to what is written in them. Other's, whilst health and strength continued with them, supposed God was only jesting, when he threatened the sinner with the vengeance of eternal fire, but now they are in hell, enduring their vengeance, they verily believe that he was in earnest. In short, son, many of them disbelieved that there is either God or devil, heaven or hell, but now, all these things are certain, even to de∣monstration,
<PB N="42" REF="027249_0041_0FD3CF53B14651A0"/>with them; they having been driven to asso∣ciate with the peers of darkness.</P>
<P>The very best of historical fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is to be found in hell: there are millions now inhabiting there, who when on earth could boast that they had good hearts, and believed well all their days, but who never began in reality to believe the report of the bible, till they tasted the sulphur of the lake. Then they believed very sincerely, though very much against their inclination. Now do you understand me when I tell you, that unbelief cannot live in hell?</P>

<SPEAKER>IMF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but you amaze me, sir! I never heard so much before. What a learned devil you are! The famous Pope Hellbrand himself could not have discussed the subject with greater accuracy. One may see from you what it is to be conversant with popes, councils, convocations, and the cler∣gy. But in our country all the conversation runs upon horse-coursing, card-playing, cock-fighting, fox-hunting, whore-making, swearing, lying, cheating, and drinking. Not a word about religion, unless it is to damn the parson for a sanctified hypocrite. And more, sir, I never knew that I had so many brethren and sisters before. Right well I know that I was begotten by you, but I looked on myself as your only son by Ignorantia, my mother. Those honor∣able spirits whom you mention as my brethren, I always took to have been sons to Belzebub, your brethren and my uncles. I should never have thought of a fraternal relation subsisting between them and myself in any other way than co-operation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been greatly mistaken, Impiator, for Belzebub never begat a son besides myself, and my brother Fastosus, who is something older than I. I am aware that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some, who alledge that Contumax, Crudelis, Dis∣cordans, &amp;c. are the natural children of the great Belzebub: but it is a mistake; for they are only his grand-children, sons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o my brother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The very moment that Contumax was brought forth, our great fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Belzebub, with all his
<PB N="43" REF="027249_0042_0FD3CF552B5EDC08"/>adherents, were cast down from the ineffable heights of pri∣meval glory, to the depths of bottomless perdition, and ac∣cording to a certain historian, were nine natural days in falling. Now, my dear Impiator, by this account, Contu∣max is your cousin, and my nephew. So that you are not only a brother in government with those illustrious princes: but sprung from the same famous ancestors with them.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed sir, I am astonished at your story, but you know that I am no scholar, and that ought to excuse for my ignorance of matters so profound; besides, such things very seldom make a great impression on my mind, being quite out of my latitude. However, I should be glad to know how your extensive government was established?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>How it elates my mind, to hear my dear Impi∣ator express a desire after instruction! I will inform you as far as I myself have known. My kingdom, which is indeed extensive, was established as follows: as soon as I was born, I began to call in question the truth, goodness, and authority of the Almighty, and in every respect set myself to oppose the eternal, by contradicting every word which he spake to man.</P>
<P>For instance, when God said to man, "Thou shalt not eat of the fruit of such and such a tree." Although then in my infancy, I stepped up to man, and thus interrogated him; hath God indeed said so? Are you sure of it? Are you not mistaken, think you? You must needs have mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣derstood him, for it cannot be consistent with the goodness of such a being as God is, to forbid your eating the fruit of such a divine tree. And as God had said, "In the day you eat thereof you shall surely die." I addressed myself to man after this manner. Die too! nay, you shall not die. That is only an empty threatening, to keep your conscien∣ces in awe; for God doth very well know that if you eat of that precious fruit ye shall be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s like himself; having knowledge of good and evil: for this it is that he hath pro∣hibited the use of this divine tree. My brother, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astosus,
<PB N="44" REF="027249_0043_0FD3CF56CE3AB728"/>also performed wonders on this occasion. By these means I brought over man to my obedience; thus I established my interest upon earth, and hitherto I have maintained it, With safety may I say that my good friends, both parsons and people to this day, love me as their lives, and at any time sooner take the bare word of the adored Infidelis, than the word and oath of the God of Heaven.</P>

<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am the oldest of all the Belzebubian off∣spring, Fastos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s alone excepted, and I yield in point of government to none of the princes. Fastosus and I, in∣deed, have a dispute between us, concerning the extent of our earthly territories; I can freely allow him the pre-emi∣nence with respect to his angelic dominions; but I can ne∣ver be brought to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that his sway over mankind is more extensive than mine, nor yet more sovereign. I yield to none in this debate, for all men are concluded under my governments and what makes greatly for my interest is, the far greater part of them, cannot be persuaded that I have any real existence. Thus it is, my dear Impiator, I reign almost universally over mankind, and they perceive it not. Many thousands of those good people who believed nothing of my existence, and who, in their own imagina∣tion had believed well all their days, have I conducted very safely down to the dark abodes of ever-growing anguish. Within which they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sooner entered and began to taste of the entertainment, than they were fully convinced that they never had believed aright. It is the unparalleled dex∣terity of our administration that all our works are perform∣ed in obscurity. And let me tell thee, child, it will re∣quire a better light than any natural ray of the human un∣derstanding, to trace and detect our deep intrigues. Thus far, with respect to myself and government. I shall take it kind if you will in your turn oblige me with some account of your's, my son.</P>

<P>Yes sir, your command shall be instantly obeyed; yet upon this condition only, that you excuse my inaccura∣cies, because I know my self to be the most illiterate devil of the fraternity, and cannot speak like the courtly Fastosus, the reverend Infidelis, or the intelligent Falax.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I proceed. My kingdom doth not consist of all the land known by the name of Impiety-Real, as some geographers alledge, several provinces being made over by treaty, to my uncle Fastosus; such as the provinces of Ci∣vility, Legality, Presumption, and Formality. I reign o∣penly, only, over the land called Impiety-Enormons, and in our country the laws are as black as the bottomless pit, for there, iniquity is established by authority. As to the rest of my kingdom, it was like all the branches of Belzebub's government, accomplished by subtilty and guile. For man considered simply as a creature, could never have been sub∣jected to my sway; for this reason I was put to my shifts, to find out some proper method for introducing my regal power.</P>
<P>So violent was the opposition to it, that my brain was put to the utmost torture, and after all I should have been oblig∣ed to return to my native country, with my finger in my mouth, had it not been for the timely assistance I received from my worthy friends and relations. My good old moth∣er, who you know hath an excellent hand at a dead lift, by means peculiar to herself, kicked up such a dust, as almost put out the eyes of one of the most vigilant and formidable of my numerous adversaries; a captain, from whose hand I had much to fear, his name was Intellectus; from that time to this, he hath been incapable of discerning my deformities, and the danger to which men are exposed by my dominion.
<PB N="46" REF="027249_0045_0FD3CDAA956CB5F0"/>And what makes very much for me, the old gentleman can hardly be persuaded, but his eye-sight is now as good as ever it was. I need not tell you the advantages that resulted to me from thus his deception. At the same time my worthy un∣cle Fastosus, came up to the second, a sturdy chief, whose name was Volens, as tradition says, and he gave his back a most dreadful wrench, insomuch that he has never reco∣vered his former posture. I myself took a po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sonous, or rather an intoxicating apple, and having guilded it over with leaf-gold, presented it to the third, whose name, if I remember right, was Rationalis: it answered my expecta∣tion. He swallowed the bait, and ever since has called bit∣ter sweet, and sweet he hath called bitter.</P>
<P>This triumvirate being thus disabled, I found my con∣quest extremely easy, and without any struggle on the part of the rest, I confined them to incessant labour and drudgery, in the different parts of my extended territories, where they are as content as possible with their condition, many of them believing they are still in the garden of paradise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, learned or unlearned you display un∣common merit. Great is my honor and happiness in hav∣ing such a son. The potent Impiator will do honor to the venerable name of Infidelis to the end of the world. Well, my son, will you please to proceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you have heard that my kingdom is di∣vided into several cantons, according to the dispositions of my subjects, each canton having its proper employments.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is the canton of drunkards, out of which I se∣lect all my courtiers, and officers in general. This canton has several communications with all the other parts of my dominions, and this we call the royal-canton.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is the swearers canton, a set of people the most unaccountably foolish of all my subjects; but a people very profitable to our government.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is the canton of thieves, to which all pilferers,
<PB N="47" REF="027249_0046_0FD3CDE417201EC8"/>robbers, gamesters, and deceitful dealers belong. A very populous and splendid canton this is.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is the liars canton: these are a people possessed of two tongues; a people who have very much of the fea∣tures of great Belzebub, and a very populous and polite can∣ton it is also.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is the canton of Sabbath-breakers, here there is hardly room enough for the inhabitants, they are so ex∣ceedingly numerous.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is the adulterers canton: this is a very dark place; seldom visited by the rays of the sun. The for∣nicators cohabit with them.</P>
<P N="7">7. There is the murderers canton: the darkest and most miserable place in all my dominions, yet for all that, it is very well peopled. For here are ranked not only those who cut one another's throats, like the Alexanders, Tamer∣lanes, Philips, Louisses, &amp;c. but also oppressors of every sort, cruel husbands and wives, disobedient children, who break their parents hearts: false friends, back-biters, and calumniators: indeed all who wanton in the unhappiness of their fellow creatures, like corn-factors and carcase butchers: so that you see here are many inhabitants, and that too of considerable figure. 'Tis worthy of observation, that all the cantons have easy passages from one another, so that al∣though the employment in each is different from that of the rest, they all hold communication with one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other, as sub∣jects of the same prince, and heirs of the same inheritance.</P>
<P>Yes, so numerous are the roads that lead from one to the other, that if a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gets into any one of my cantons, it re∣quires no less than omnipotent power and wisdom, equal to omniscience, to extricate him from a labyrinth so dangerous: and it is well for me that it is so, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my subjects are frequently terrified, especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se that work in the deep mines, lest they should dig <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> through the earth, and tumble into hell. But a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> disco∣vers that, their efforts to deliver themselves are all ineffec∣tual,
<PB N="48" REF="027249_0047_0FD3CF58986B6760"/>for the road by which they escape from one canton, leads them into another equally dangerous. Many ways there are to throw a man down into my mines, but believe me, if ever any one comes up again, it must cost the Almighty an errand from heaven to rescue him. I assure you, sir, that by the help of these subtle passages and intricate turnings, I keep my subjects endaved with as little trouble to myself, as any master devil that ever ascended out of the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mless pit. But by the way I am constantly employed in planning out fresh measures for the slaves to pursue. Oh! sir, the end will shew that I give ample demonstration, of my fidelity to my royal grand-father Belzebub, of whom I hold my lands by sief.</P>

As soon as the mighty angel shall sound the dead awakening trumpet, the great, the far famed Infidelis must resion his breath. Yet be not you discouraged, Impiator, for you shall live for∣ever. You know how I fostered you in my bosom, and en∣dued you with qualifications to sit on the throne of Profa∣nity, where so successfully you reign. Permit me now to tell you that knowing that I must die, I have, like all other wise people, made my will, and for your encouragement I have appointed you my son, with your uncle, Fastosus, your highly honoured brother Desperando, and your cousins Con∣tumax, and Discordaus, the joint executors thereof, and sole heirs unto all my dominions and subjects, who at my decease are to be transported to the land of torment; there you shall reign in eternal triumph over them.

<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV. FASTOSUS and AVARO.</HEAD>
<P>BEING privy to the appointment betwixt Fastosus and Avaro, I took care to arrive in the valley time enough to hear all that passed; for now my business was left to shift for itself, and every thing gave place to the force of curiosi∣ty, which bore down like an inundation every thing before it. If my wife consulted me in any thing I would answer "Fastosus." If my children told me of their progress at school, I would abruptly reply, "Horrida Vallis!" When my journey men, or apprentices talked to me about the shop business, my answer was, "the great Avaro." And if they said any thing about my good friend the parson. I would say, "Oh! the wonderful Infidelis!" In fact, I could think about nothing but the devils in the valley. Therefore I took care to provide myself with every thing necessary, and away I went to the Vale of Horrors, and had not long been there ere I saw Fastosus and Avaro come travelling to∣wards me.

<P>I did find more than I expected, cousin, for I had no sooner finished with the mantua-maker, than I was
<PB N="50" REF="027249_0049_0FD3CF5E5D4E6930"/>waited upon by a hatter, who begged to be informed, whe∣ther it was most genteel to six the loops of an hat an inch and an half, or only one bare inch in depth, and whether a gentleman is most of a cavaller with his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t cocked in right angles? or with one obtuse and two acate angles? Before I had well satisfied the hatter, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came a gen∣tleman per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke maker, who humbly asked m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether a nobleman looks most like a hero when he has one, or when he has two curls bobbing over his cars. Provoked that the gentleman mechanics should suppose I had nothing to do but to cock hats, and adjust wigs, I wrinkled my forchead into a most majestic frown, and made the following answer, "Get hence thou sneaking our. I have known a lord before now that had his ears so covered with tires of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrls, that he could not hear the commands of his superiors.

<P>By what you say, honored sir, I perceive that, wheresoever idleness prevails, it is not among us, for we have no rest day nor night, but go about plotting the destruction of mankind.</P>
<P>For my own part, I assure you, I have had but little rest since I saw you last; and so very fond are mankind of my counsels, that I expect but very little rest for the time to come. You know I was going to secrete a bag of money in the Val∣ley, when you and I met. This was no sooner done than I was waited on by a parson, who had his eyes upon a good living, with a view to receive directions about obtaining it. And he was followed by a tradesman, who had a desire to make a profitable break of it; but begged direction how he might do it honourably; I referred him to the goddesses Per∣fidia and Fallacia for instructions, as they more immediately preside in that department. This honourable gentleman dil∣patched; I was attended by a certain curate, who having ac∣ver had inclination nor opportunity to examine the canons of a certain church, came to consult me whether it was lawful to christen a child, if the parents had not money enough to pay the fees. I told him, by no means, for if you once be∣gin to officiate gratis, you'll have enough of it and the par∣son's trade will be worse than an attorney's cler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship.

<P>Indeed, sir, it is what actually happened, not five hundred miles from London bridge; and there is a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tain gentleman alive who could av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he thought proper.</P>
<P>Having dispatched the journeyman patson, I was sent for in all the baste by my good friend the attorney. He, wor∣thy gentleman, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> undertaken a cause, which he very well
<PB N="52" REF="027249_0051_0FD3CF5E6F0B2EB0"/>knows, can never be defended upon principles of honour and honesty; but his client is a rich man, can well be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eecing, and therefore he could not in conscience put him aside. He knows exceeding well how to turn the rich man's cause to his own emolument, if he could but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so as not to injure his own credit. That was the perplexity which he was in, and what he begged me to clear up; said he within himself, "Can I but get this cause to depend in chancery for a few years, (which by the way is the highest point in law for a desperate cause) I shall gain some hundreds of pounds by it." As soon as he had done his duty to me, he very hum∣bly laid the matter without reserve before me. Then said I, my good sir, let not the suit disturb you, I will manage it both for your honour and profit, never fear me. Who is he that is employed against you? To which he replied, "Oh! a very skilful man. No less a person than the great Mr. Falshood. A very eminent attorney indeed!" Come, said I, let him be sent for: this was done, and the Lawyer Falshood attended accordingly.</P>
<P>Being both seated in my client's great parlor, the good man addressed Mr. Falshood thus, "My best friend, Mr. Falshood, you and I are engaged as opponents in this suit; both of the gentlemen are resolute, and will bear a good deal of fleecing; you know what I mean, sir. Now all is as yet uncertain, and the issue will greatly depend upon the measures to be taken by you and me; I would therefore, good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat we make it certain; if right take place, it will be spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver, and we shall make but a poor job of it, but if it is well managed, it may produce some hundreds apiece. My advice is, sir, that it shall hang in chancery, like a poor man's soul in purgatory. What do you say, Mr. Falshood?"</P>
<P>Mr. Falshood replied, "It will never do, good sir. It will never do, to bring it to a speedy issue; that is certain. But I'll tell you what we will do. You know that you have the worst side of the cause, and if I act the part of an ho∣nest man, you will soon be obliged to give up: but I shall
<PB N="53" REF="027249_0052_0FD3CF600E28C568"/>act the part of a skilful lawyer, which will suit both of our purposes much better. I shall give you all the advantages that I can, in order to keep the cause depending, 'till the patience of our clients is quite exhausted, and they agree to put the matter to arbitration. As they are both men of resolution, by that time it will be a job worth gathering."</P>
<P>So having set the two worthy lawyers to drink a bottle to the good luck of it. I left them, took wing and came hi∣ther; but I can tell you, if I had not soared aloft I had not been here so soon, for I saw a great number of parsons, law∣yers, and farmers watching for me; I gave them the slip however, and artfully dropt my influences upon them.

Understand me then, when God almighty had created all the hosts of heaven, every angel was perfectly pleased with his station; the most solid and joyous contentment reigned among, and united the etherial inhabitants, who were, in those days very numerous. No one so much as wished his station altered. No one thought himself capable of higher felicity and perferment than he enjoyed. The adventurous Satan himself, though he has not been blest with one mo∣ments rest ever since I was born, before that time possessed all the sublime and refined pleasures, his exalted capacity was capable of. And well might he be pleased with his station, seeing he was a mighty prince among the angels, next in greatness to the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, who was appointed lord lieute∣nant of the creation. And a mighty prince in heaven he would have continued, had he not afterwards become a can∣didate for omnipotence. As for me I was not born then, but I have heard old Satan my father, with flames of malice and indignation darting from his eyes, tell how the most per∣fect harmony existed among the hosts of paradise; till it hap∣pened that a declaration was made from the lofty throne, that the Son of God was predestinated at a time appointed, to as∣sume a nature inferior to that of angels; and the most high commanded that, in that nature all the angels of God should worship the Son, even as they worship the Father, and that
<PB N="55" REF="027249_0054_0FD3CE42E85C5A08"/>all should submit to the government of the man whom God delighted to honour.</P>
<P>At this instant I was begotten in Satan's alarmed breast. And cried out, 'Tis enough that such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xalted spirits as we, submit to him in his present unincarnate state. But worship and submit to him in an inferior nature, let who will, I will not. What does he mean? Will the Almighty debase his first and best; and make us subject to an inferior nature? No, it shall never be said, that Satan the archangel stooped so low! The great archangel's voice was heard, his reso∣lution was approved of, the standard of rebellion set up in heaven, and many millions of angels, whose natures I had changed, joined it that day, and fell into the depths of bot∣tomless perdition. Now do you understand me?</P>

<P>I understand you pretty well when you say, that Satan begat you: but you say, that you begat him, and millions of devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> besides, it run always in my head that God had made every devil in the bottomless pit; but if I under∣stand you aright, you say you made them all.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>True I do say so, and I will not quit an hair's breath of my just prerogative. God never did, nor ever could make any sinner, either angelic or human. Mind well what I say, for I perceive you are dull of apprehension, and but of a shallow judgment. It was not I, but God who made them creatures. God created them in a holy, pure and glo∣rious state, and endowed them with powers to preserve their primitive station, in the upper skies: but it was I, not God, who from angels of light transformed them into de∣vils of darkness. The very moment I was conceived, I chan∣ged them from light to darkness; from holiness to sin, from glory to dishonour; and thus, though not as creatures, yet as devils they are wholly of my formation. Do ye under∣stand me now?</P>

<P>Aye, Avaro, to such as you they are dark; but I'll explain them; I did not mean that I annihilated his an∣gelic nature; no, he is an angel still, although a black one.

I made him that crooked, perverse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which you see he now is. I opened the over-flow∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ices of divine indignation, which continually pour down upon him, whatever he is doing or wherever he flies, and not upon him only, but upon all his adherents. Was not this killing him to purpose, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it was. You had not hurt him half so much, uncle, if you had deprived him of being. I wonder that he can endure the sight of you after all that has be∣fallen him on your account! you have deprived him of ev∣ery good, and brought every evil upon him, and yet he loves you as his own foul. 'Tis strange! Wondrous strange, Fast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll think it stranger still, when I tell you that he is so far from hating me, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will do nothing, either on earth or in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll, amongst men or devils, but as he is directed and prompted to it by me. And so far is he from repenting of what he hath done, that he hath told me a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>housand times, if it were to do again he would do it. Nothing grieves the heart of old Satan so much as this, the very man whose exaltation he opposed, whose sway he resisted, and whose person he hath still in the most perfect abhorrence, is dignified, not only by a personal union with Jehovah; but by all judgment being committed into his hand, and the public adminiscration of all the affairs of heaven, earth, and hell devolving upon him. Great is his torment, from the consideration, that he, with all his ad∣herents, must receive their final sentence from the same person, who of all beings, he hates with the most con∣summate
<PB N="57" REF="027249_0056_0FD3CF6A1F7EDDC0"/>hatred, and on whose account he hates and seeks the destruction of all the creatures of God.</P>
<P>'Tis a perpetual hell to him, that the object of his greatest aversion, sitteth on the circle of heaven, and holdeth him continually as with bit and bridle; limiteth his operations at pleasure, and sovereignly appoints his licence by an unaltera∣ble determination. When through confirmed malice and desperate resolution, Sata<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> struggles for larger scop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Im∣manuel gives him a check, saying, hitherto thou mayest go, but no farther."

What is the most r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>kable of all is, that the more rapidly, the torrent of the Almighty's wrath pours in upon him, the fonder he is of me, the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se of all his misery.</P>

<P>It is not fitting, Avar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that you should criticise upon my doctrine: you ought to embrace it implicitly as I de∣liver it to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, great sir, you put me in mind of some of the modern parsons, for that is the very way that they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t their doctrine to be embraced, implicitly, with∣out questioning its currency. 'Tis merry enough to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear them exhort their hearers, to search the scriptures, to try the spirits, to take hoed what they hear, &amp;c. and yet after all, if any one of their hearers attempts to bring the parson's own sermon to trial by the scriptures, he is deemed a trouble∣some, self-conceited fellow, and if he happens to disprove his
<PB N="58" REF="027249_0057_0FD3CF6B98911000"/>doctrine by the scripture, he is presently dealt with, and ex∣communicated as a troubler of Israel. For the parson would have other peoples doctrine tried, and, if false, refuted; but it is impious to do so by his own. Brave days, Fastosus, are these! It is quite laughable to hear the modern clergymen tell their hearers, that they have a right to private judgment, and to know the mind of God for themselves; and at the same time obliging them implicitly to abide by the confession of faith already authenticated. That is, uncle, the clergy will allow you to controvert the scriptures, if you choose it, but their own articles must have your implicit submission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, cousin, you have fairly laughed me out of my resentment, by the droll conduct of your parsons. How∣ever, what I said, Avaro, I will maintain. It shall never be said that the devil. Fastosus, did at any time eat his words; but I will condescend to explain myself. Without me, Bel∣zebub would be none other than an angel; but mixing myself with his angelic faculties, I render him a perfect devil; the same I do with all the rest of my infernal subjects. Belze∣bub himself is but a titular prince; 'tis I who instigate him, that am the great devil of all. To tell you more, it is I who formed hell itself, as a place of punishment. Such is the rec∣titude, and equity of his nature, that God never would, nor could, inflict any punishment without my intervention. He was ever guided in all his works by his own perfections, and therefore could never have punished sinless beings: all beings would have remained sinless, but for me; so in making sin, I made the punishment of it. For if once sin is introduced, punishment follows of course; it being as natural for sin to bring forth punishment, as it is for the sun to send forth light and heat.</P>
<P>No being possibly can be a devil, but that being who is pos∣sessed and governed by me, every being thus possessed and governed, whether angel or man, is a devil. But for di∣stinctions sake, we ascribe only the plain name of fiends, to the angels whom I govern, and to men and women under my
<PB N="59" REF="027249_0058_0FD3CF6C6EF98EF8"/>dominion, we give the names of devils incarnate, because they i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>habit bodies of flesh. The difference in the stature of devils is not, that one is less devilish than another, but their being possessed of more noble endowments, and more ex∣tensive qualities than others. So you see the devils of quality among us, are more intelligent, more subtle, and crafty than devils of a vulgar race. The reason why Belzebub is head over all the infernal tribes also, is not because he is more depraved than his adherents, but be∣cause he was originally created in a more glorious station, possessed of endowments more exalted, and blest with more extensive natural powers. As such, being once depraved, he is capable of excelling his fellows, as far in diabolical at∣chievements, as at first he excelled them in their heavenly station. The same rule holds good, through the varicus ranks of my subjects. Were you to ask me, why it is that devils without a body, are capable of exceeding in sweet re∣bellion, those spirits who are embodied? I would answer without hesitation, "Not because the one is less vicious, or one whit less depraved than the other, but for the following two very good and substantial reasons;</P>
<P N="1">1. Although I reign and rule in the heart of every one of them, yet whilst they are in the body, they are laid un∣der particular restrictions by the Almighty; so that they can∣not do all the evil which in their hearts I prompt them to do: and therefore they cannot be so much like Belzebub in their actions as they would be. Fear and shame, very often prevent people from gratifying their impious and unclean in∣clinations, when a love of virtue, and the fear of God, are absolutely out of the question.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the natural powers of man are very far inse∣rior to the powers of infernal spirits. The more extensive a man's natural capacity, the nearer he may arrive to the stature of Satan, if unrestrained by the grace of God. Hence a crafty and learned pope, is by far more like the devil than
<PB N="60" REF="027249_0059_0FD3CE2338389FB8"/>an ignorant swag-bellied friar. Yea, Avaro, the more en∣larged the capacity of either man or devil may be, as it makes him capable of the higher degrees of wickedness, even so in proportion to the natural abilities of both shall the pu∣nishment inflicted be. No wicked being is so capable of be∣ing wicked as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>afty and understanding person, who, if he is not truly virtuous and holy, must be truly wicked and devilish. Hence one Hume, one Voltaire, is an hun∣dred times more capable of being useful to us, than fifty H—w—ds, or even five times the number of popish priests. You may take this as a general maxim, that the most en∣larged soul must be the most tormented, if not saved.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>How should it be otherwise, Avaro, when you consider the subtilty of my nature? I am the very soul of Belzebub, and all his vassals. Petty spirits may boast of their conquests one to another, but they must all be silent when courtly Fastosus opens his mouth. You, Avaro, Impiator, Discordans, &amp;c. have all of you made a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great inroads up∣on mankind as can possibly be expected from such unseem∣ly spirits as you be; but as for me, you see I am a spirit of a comely deportment, and caressed by all. Indeed many peo∣ple are now a-days of opinion, that a specie of my nature is absolutely necessary, in order to make them respectable in the world, and prevent the injuries which otherwise might be offered to them. Nor is there any who can dis∣cern the fatal consequences of being under my direction, except those who are enlightened from above, by him who was given for a light to the Gentiles. I lodge securely in the secret caverns of the heart, and from thence I convey my influence so imperceptibly through all the words of the mouth, and actions of the life, that you rarely meet
<PB N="61" REF="027249_0060_0FD3CF6DF131F6B0"/>with a man or woman, who will own that they have the least acquaintance with me; tho' with many of them, the judicious beholder, will easily perceive, that I am deeply concerned in all they do or say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I have often heard people declare, that they never saw the devil Fastosus, nor had the least ac∣quaintance with pride. Yet, they said, a little spirit ought to be shewn, that every one might know his proper place. But I perceive now, that pride itself is that same spirit which they deem so necessary, notwithstanding their sup∣posed freedom from it, and aversion to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same spirit, Avaro, though they do not know it, for I deceive them at every turn, being capa∣ble of transforming myself into so many different shapes, and bearing a name so suitable to each, that even when I lord it over them with the greatest power, they remain ut∣terly ignorant of their subjection to me. Sometimes I as∣sume the appearance and bear the name of my avowed ene∣my, humility; then you will see people of fashion, or those who think themselves such, descending lower than their sta∣tion, for no other reason than to get a good name. At ano∣ther time you may see me transformed into the likeness of Charity, and I prompt my slaves to bestow their alms, in order to be esteemed benevolent and generous. I have seen a man of wealth and industry, perform such actions with this and no other view, and he has made his poor b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly to suffer for it many days to come, when at the same time he had his thousands out at use. Then I take upon me the name of Decency, and am greatly employed in regulating domestic affairs, descending even so low, as to take cogni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance of meat and drink, dress and company; then you may see madam, extremely diligent in persuading Miss Prim and Miss Stiff not to be seen in the company of those of an inferior station. Ere you are aware I have got the name of Good-Breeding, and oh! what wonders of fashionable civi∣lities
<PB N="62" REF="027249_0061_0FD3CF70062A2000"/>I work, and forward the great designs of hell. At this time you'll see my lady, who having forgotten the fa∣shions prevailing above twenty years ago, when she was un∣der forty, is as careful as possible not to deviate in the least from the customs of them who were born since she was a wife and mother. Sometimes I bear the name of a spirit of honor; under this name I prevailed in antient Rome, and now reign over many of our European cavaliers; in this character I do great execution among the British gods at the west end of London, where the greatest enormities are deemed excusable, but the puting up with an affront, an un∣pardonable evil.</P>

<P>There would be nothing done in camparison of what there is among mankind, if we appeared in our ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> likeness, and went by our proper names: for there are thou∣sands that love us extremely while in disguise, who would be ashamed of us, if we went by our proper names of Covetousness and Pride. As for my part, I am fain to perform all my works in disguise; bearing the feigned names of Industry, Frugality, &amp;c. But, sir, will it please you to give me some account how you first made your entrance good amongst man∣kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already told you, that as soon as I was born, I obtained full dominion over the adherents of Belze∣bub; this taught the angels of the deep, that the only way to seduce innocent beings, was to inject my nature into them; and that the seeds of pride being once sown, they could not fail of most abundant fruitfulness. Man was originally created in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly and happy estate, a perfect stranger to those evils which now prevail over, and reign predominant in the natural and moral world. You could not have seen so much as one symptom of pride or covetousness, or other vice, either in Adam or Eve, in their primitive state. They loved without unchastity, and enjoyed without un∣cleanness; nor were they in the least acquainted with the racking torments of jealousy. No anxious thoughts per∣plexing
<PB N="63" REF="027249_0062_0FD3CF70F22C5088"/>fears, nor distracting cares, disturbed their peace∣ful hearts. Envy, anger, shame, and resentment, were strangers to the new created pair, and never set foot in pa∣radise before my arrival there. Their sole delight was to contemplate the beneficence of their God.</P>
<P>Our eagle-eyed angels when they saw the noble deport∣ment of man, soon perceived that he was of the same nature, which the Son of God was predestinated to assume, (for as some think be might, out of love to the human nature, ap∣pear occasionally to the heavenly hosts in the form of man
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some may think that this parenthesis is an impeachment of the knowledge of Fastosus, supposing that himself was ignorant, whe∣ther the Son of God did or did not assume the form of a man in his intercourse with the heavenly legions. But it ought to be observed that this judicious devil is relating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ransactions which were antecedent to the time, when he professes to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been born.</NOTE>) for the resisting of which decree, they were damned to the depths of ever burning hell. The first discovery Belzebub made of the blessed situation in which man was created, filled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> noble mind with such violent agitations of rage, envy, ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce and pride, that his fury burst beyond all bounds. He stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ped and raged in a most tempestuous manner; insomuch that he shook the sable firmament of hell, and brought his consederates to enquire the cause of his anguish. A coun∣cil thus convened, after the prince had a little recovered from the first flock of transporting rage, he related to them what he had discovered concerning the inhabitants of Eden. Asked advice of his senators, who, to a devil vowed speedy destruction to man. Some demar there was respecting the plan of their operations; for the impolitic part of the assembly finding the smallness of their number, were for having man assaulted by storm; but the more sage politi∣cians voted for craft, as the likeliest method to seduce them, At last the august assembly came to this unanimous resolution, "That the great Belzebub should, by certain means, by him to be devised, inspire them with my nature, nothing
<PB N="64" REF="027249_0063_0FD3CE2F9BB89E60"/>doubting, but if that could be done, they would soon de∣clare in favour of the devil's government."</P>
<P>After he had well weighed every circumstance, the arch-apostate undertook the enterprise: but did not judge it pro∣per to exercise force against them, knowing well, that if their resistance proved equal to their power, all his destruc∣tive measures must unavoidably be broken, and the enter∣prise miscarry. Therefore like a wise hero and consummate politician, he resolved to accomplish by craft and subtility, what was not to be done by open assault, nor did he think it advisable to address them in his own form, least he should frighten them at his first appearance, and by that means render their seduction for ever after impracticable. But ju∣diciously concluded that the most promising method was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assume the body of one of their familiar domestic anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which were dally under their observation. Accordingly after long consultation with himself, and strictly examining the brutal tribes, he possessed a beauteous serpeut, perceiving that it was head of the repule world, and best fitted for con∣verse with man, with whom also it was more familiar, than all the beasts beside. Thus equipped for executing the deep projected scheme, he still acted with caution becoming the most consummate experience. He cared not to attack them both at once, lost by any means they should see thro' his disguise, and he should occasion his own repulse; there∣fore he craftily lurked near them, and overheard their dis∣course, that he might better learn which of them was the weaker v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssel.</P>
<P>Being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pirit of great penetration, he soon found that, the woman was not only the weakest but the youngest; and what greatly encouraged his hope, was, that the man loved the woman with the most tender affection, a circumstance very painful for him to behold. Peace being now a stran∣ger to his own bosom, it was grievous for him to see the se∣licity of the human pair. In consequence of these discove∣ries, he made no attempts upon the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but bent all his
<PB N="65" REF="027249_0064_0FD3CF7633859B10"/>endeavours to seduce the woman, not doubting but if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could be effected, the man would come of course, so strong∣ly was he attached to his yoke-fellow.</P>

<P>But is it possible, sir, that the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pists should ascribe an equal, if not a greater glory, to the blessed virgin, than to the Son of God?</P>

<SP>

<P>It is not only possible, but certain, and as a proof of it, I shall repeat to you one of their prayers to her; a prayer which can by no means be offensive to any of our people. "O Mary!

Here you see, child, that although he was believed by his apostles to be God over all; the papists have found out a way to put him under the command of his virgin mother. Not only so, but they have put him under the command of St. Ann, reputed by them to have been his grandmother, as may be seen in that famous prayer, approved and authorised by the doctors
<PB N="66" REF="027249_0065_0FD3CF7711D97158"/>of the Sorbonne, in Paris; I'll repeat the passage, being the fourth paragraph in the prayer, "In homage of the right and power (of mother) which you had over your daughter, (Mary) and of grandmother over her son, and of their (Ma∣ry's and Jesus's) submission, which they render you." Here you see he is supposed to submit to his grandmother Ann, as well as to be under the government of his mother Mary.

<P>Then I begin with the canton of swearers, the most foolish and unaccountable set of people upon the face of the earth. This canton is divided into two provinces, both which are full of people: in the first province dwell the false swearers; and the profane swearers, in the se∣cond.</P>
<P>The province of false swearers, is divided into three dis∣tricts, the first of which is inhabited, by knights of the post, a set of gentry who get their living by giving eviden∣ces in causes to which they are perfect strangers. These knights commonly make their court to the c—k of arr-ings, whom they know is best capable of finding them employ∣ment. It is not a great many years since, a gentleman walking in the sessions-house, in the Old Baily, was accost∣ed by one of these knights with, "Pray, sir, do you want a witness? Sir, I'll serve you as cheap and as well as any man." Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, formerly was a mighty protector of this order of knights: and at this day
<PB N="67" REF="027249_0066_0FD3CF771B414F68"/>our good friend, the father of the world, his worthy inqui∣sitors, and not a few right reverend prelates, are head men in the district of false swearers. Many a good Christian, has been brought to the stake, or gallows, by their assiduity, both among papists and pagans; and more especially the former, who are far from being so honest, as the latter; and not by half so consistent.</P>
<P>The second district is inhabited by the mercenary swear∣ers. This is a race supposed to be descended from the knights of the post; and to be sure there is a great likeness betwixt the two. The mercenary swearers will buy a piece of goods for five shillings, and as soon as a buyer presents himself, tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that upon his life and soul, it cost him six shillings. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he meets with another seller of the same commodity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order to obtain a good pennyworth he shews him the goods for which he paid five shillings, and tells the stranger, that, "As he hopes to be saved, he gave no more than four and six∣pence for it." The dealers in horses, drovers, and butchers, are singulary dextrous at this kind of swearing. In this di∣strict, it is a prevalent opinion, that a man is not fit to live in the world, unless he can swear to a lie.</P>
<P>The third division is inhabited by the foolish swearers, a people the most remarkably stupid, of any under the government of hell; some of them are so accustomed to it from their infancy, that they do not so much as know when they swear, and are as destitute of design in the practice, as the parrot when it scolds the chamber maid, or as many good people when they say their prayers at church. Others seem to have such a low opinion of their own probity, that they imagine no one will believe what they say, unless every sen∣tence is ushered in with an oath in the van, and confirmed by another in the rear. Gentlemen of family, fortune and fashion, are stationed in this class, and are extremely dextrous here. Nor are the officers of the fleet and army less learn∣ed, or devoid of those embellishments. The greatest part of the English officers indeed, marine and military, esteem a
<PB N="68" REF="027249_0067_0FD3CE30ACA81930"/>man not fit to carry a musket, unless he can swear an hun∣dred oaths in a quarter of an hour, without any qualms of conscience.</P>
<P>The British army so far excels in this fine art, that they can fairly curse the French off the field of battle, without ever striking a blow; so terrified are the French at the oaths of the English. Aye, father, I assure you, that this hero∣ic practice, is now so prevalent among the basest of the multitude, that I could pick you out a low lifed boatswain, who will vie with an admiral; and a dwarfish drummer, who will swear with a lieutenant-general, for any money. Yea, I could pick you out a fellow, who cannot procure whole shoes to his feet, that yet will match any noblen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> or esquire in the land at swearing. And, sir, if honor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sists in being adepts here, the vilest pedlar may vie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the best of the gentry, and the very footpad may challenge a peer of the realm. The canton of swearers, is a very po∣pulous and very honorable place. Here are dukes, knights of all orders, marquisses, and earls. And a very worship∣ful canton it is too, for numbers of very respectable corpo∣rations, and many justices of the peace reside in it.</P>
<P>I have often laughed, to see a delinquent brought before a magistrate, and by him be obliged to pay two shillings for every attested oath, when the magistrate himself, had not manhood enough to maintain conversation for ten mi∣nutes, without being guilty of profane swearing.</P>

<P>Pray thee, my son, what are the qualifications requisite to a justice of the peace in thy country.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two qualifications only, sir, are requisite. The first is, that the gentleman be pretty well to live in the world, and the second, that he shall be an obsequious tool to administration. As to knowledge of the law, love to the people, regard to moral principles, and all such stuff, are altogether out of the question. I was going to say, it is a very religious canton too, because here you may find a con∣siderable number of reverend parsons, both papists and pro∣testants.
<PB N="69" REF="027249_0068_0FD3CF771F0C2A78"/>As for their oaths in use, they are various, as the fancy of the swearers inclines them. Some swear by hea∣ven, others by the God of heaven: some swear by Christ, others by his blood and wounds; some by St. Peter, others by St. Paul; some by St. Mary, others by her virginity; some swear by the pope, others by his holiness, and by his infallibility; some by the life of their sovereign; some by the life of the devil, and some by their own lives. Some there are who swear by the church, others by the liturgy and mass; and some who for want of a better epithet, swear by their own eyes and limbs.</P>

<P>Indeed, son, these are a set of as foolish people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one would wish to meet with.

Sensible people, and some there are still among men, do not esteem a man the more for his acres or pension, but for his virtue and good sense, and hence a swearing gipsy and a swearing gentleman are held as equally dishonorable. But no more of this, I intend not to become a moralist at this time.</P>

<P>The second canton is that of thieves, and a very flourish∣ing canton it is, notwithstanding we every session send a freight over the Stygian lake,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author has often lamented the unhappy, and untimely end of the malefactors hung up every sessions; sometimes for things perhaps comparatively trifling, and which in themselves cannot merit so severe a punishment. It does not appear from scrip∣ture, or reason, that common theft, should be punished with the gallows, and especially when the matter stolen is of small value. Nor does it appear to be good policy to deprive society of a mem∣ber, who might afterwards be useful, on account of some rash and unguarded invasion of his neighbour's property. Hang them once, their services are for ever lost to the community. If other methods were taken, villainy would be more successfully sup∣pressed, and the members of society spared for usefulness. The British senators must needs see, that the hanging trade does not lessen the number of rogues. Nor the untimely end of one leave suitable impressions upon the minds of others. To be bound to hard labour for the space of one year, would be more terrible than to be transported for seven; and besides, use might introduce a laborious habit, which would render stealing unnecessary. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persuaded, that to a dissolute young man, who hates labor, to be chained to a dung-cart, or placed in some other servile sta∣tion, would be more dreadful than Tyburn itself.</NOTE> who no more return to their
<PB N="70" REF="027249_0069_0FD3CF793B20C7A0"/>native country. This canton being very extensive, is like∣wise divided into several lesser cantons. The first of which contains the gentlemen-thieves. A very courtly, polite, and fashionable set of people. Gentlemen thieves, are such who enjoy places of honor and trust, and are not careful of their duty to their king and country. It is observable of them, that when they are out of place, they are the greatest ene∣mies to corruption, and the staunchest friends to liberty in the world. They are capable of no influence, but that of patriotism, so long as unprovided for; but the moment their happy stars make them placemen, they forget their parriotism, drop their enmity to venality, and seek noth∣ing so much as their own emolument, leaving the publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> shift for itself. It is thought that not a few gentle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> thieves live, within a hundred miles of famous Tybu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and some people farther think, it is great pity that solemn tree is not more frequently graced with them; but in mo∣dern times it is quite unfashionable to hang any but the little thieves.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If an ingenious mechanic should die for filing a single guinea; an extravagant youth be hanged without mercy, for putting you in bodily fear, on the highway; or a vain girl in the prime of life be executed for stealing a few yards of lace, and others plun∣der the nation of thousands with impunity, it shows that there must be a defect somewhere.</NOTE> Those gentlemen having no principles, above
<PB N="71" REF="027249_0070_0FD3CF7E9ADF3DF0"/>ambition and avarice to influence them, being once in place, are capable of being more injurious to the commonwealth, each of them than an hundred highwaymen; and yet Ty∣burn is not honored with a gentleman thief, above once in a century, much to the grief of real patriots.</P>
<P>Another class of gentlemen thieves, are our officers by sea and land, who impose upon their king and country, by false musters: and in a very peculiar manner those who make their own fortunes, (no matter whether in the East or West-Indies) by the fatigue of their men, who are left to remain in their original penury: these, together with the commis∣saries for the army, agents for regiments, &amp;c. are all sta∣tioned here.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he second subdivision is peopled by what we call the fa∣shionable thieves. A prodigious populous place is this. Here dwell legions of attornies; vermin, who for five shillings worth of labour, will charge their clients near the same num∣ber of pounds; and very conscientiously take pay, for wil∣fully perverting and defeating a just cause. Here you may find gentlemen, who can procure witnesses to swear just as you would have them, and pack a jury that can give a clear verdict, over the belly of the most consistent evidence. Such a jury hath, ere now, saved a noble neck from the deserved cord, through the all-subduing power of money. To this famous division, belong the tradesman, who will take more from an unskilful buyer, than he knows in his conscience his goods are worth: a thing very common among dealers. Also the wealthy gentleman, who, in buying will take ad∣vantage of the indigence of the seller, and pay, if he can, less than the real worth of what he buys; this practice is now so very near to universal, that tradesmen deal with one another, for the most part, as if they were all known
<PB N="72" REF="027249_0071_0FD3CF802ABA4350"/>to be rogues and cheats, and he is the best tradesman, that can best guard against the villainy of his neighbours.</P>
<P>Here dwells the careful tradesman, who if a man once owes him five pounds, would write down five pounds ten shillings. This method is so much in vogue, that many people dare not trust their names on the tradesmens books. As for my friend, sir Rodger Latepay, he has had such ex∣perience of it, that his word is in danger. In this fashion∣able division, dwells the tradesman, who, conscious that his own capital is expended, supports his luxury and grandeur, at the expence of his dealers; and many such there be in town and country. The avaricious farmers, manufactur∣ers, and housholders, who make their servants, and me∣chanies, work under their usual wages, from the prete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of deadness of trade, &amp;c. The buyer who is conscio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of his present inability, and spends without any probable view of being hereafter able to pay, dwells in the very heart of this division; and hard by him dwells the father, who, to gratify a depraved taste, squanders away his estate, to the defrauding of his wife and children. All of these, sir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very fashionable people.</P>
<P>The third division is that of holy thieves. That is, men whose theft is in holy things. By holy thieves, I mean un∣holy men, sustaining holy offices. Such is he, who enters into orders, merely for the sake of a good living. All who climb over the wall, and come not in by the door, are thieves and robbers. Thieves, because they steal the por∣tion of the priests; for having no right to the sacerdotal function, their participation of the altar, is sacrilegious theft. Robbers, because they make havock of the church, and deprive God's children of the food allowed them by their heavenly Father. Here dwell shoals of popish priests, and very considerable numbers of protestant clergy, of various denominations, as well as the total sum of pagan and maho∣metan musties. His holiness the pope of Rome, is indeed
<PB N="73" REF="027249_0072_0FD3CF816CAD64A8"/>president in this division, for he steals the prerogatives of God, and applies them to his own private use.</P>
<P>The fourth division in the canton of thieves, are those whom we call the sporting thieves. Such are card-players, cock fighters, horse-coursers, and gamblers of all sorts. I know of none of my sporting subjects, but what will win if they can, either by upright, or inequitable means. Therefore with us it is an established maxim, that the true gambler is the certain thief. Here too you may find princes, nobles, spiritual and temporal, and judges of every rank. Ha! ha! ha! how have I been ready to split my sides with laughing, to see an archbishop lay aside his mitre, and take up a pack of cards; and the sacred judge, after having pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> sentence on a criminal, lay aside all his solemnity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t on the sprightly sportsman. Then cried I, oh! the bench! oh! the pulpit! O the gambler.</P>
<P>The fifth division in the canton of thieves, is inhabited by what we call fantastic thieves. A very contemptible canton this is with sensible people. Yet foolish as they are with their nostrums, they make it appear, that there are people more foolish than themselves, for they pick the pockets of the neighbouring cantons very cleverly. Here dwell your Dassies, Godfries, Stonghtons, Fluggers, Low∣thers, James's, Turlingtons, &amp;c. Here the famous Mr. Mountebank is president, and Mr. Ardrew Arc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee is his deputy. In this division nothing is heard of but pills, lozen∣ges, troches, baliams, elixirs, drops, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>als, and the ready coin; for the fantastical thieves can-give no credit.</P>
<P>The sixth division consists of plain honest high way men. Honest, when compared with many of the others, for when they are about to rob a man, they very honestly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him their design, and stake but a few high words, and the mouth of the pistol against the purse and all that is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which, notwithstanding the odds be greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the traveller's fide, the highwayman carries lightly off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the watch
<PB N="74" REF="027249_0073_0FD3EBF0CAF344B8"/>into the bargain. Whereas many of the gentlemen-thieves, carry on their work so slily, that you know not their inten∣tion of robbing you, till long after the robbery is commit∣ed. Oh! Tyburn, Tyburn, thou hast long groaned for such men as these!</P>
<P>Here too are many venerable priests, who, by pretended pardons, dispensations, &amp;c. play the pick-pocket to great advantage. Much could I say about this class of veterans in the thieving trade, were I not afraid of exciting their re∣sentment, which would be very detrimental to my designs, as they lead the consciences of the laity, just which way they please.</P>

<P>Indeed, my son, by your account of them, the highwaymen, and pick-pockets, are less prejudicial to soci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ty than many who are held to be men of great renown.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, sir, a thousand times, and I can tell you that, some of the greatest of names are enrolled in the annals of this canton of thieves. There are the Grecian and Roman heroes, almost in general, particularly great Alexander, and Julius Caesar. There is Tamerlane, there is Kouli Khan, there is Philip of Spain, and there is L—s of France, who has as good an inclination to thieving as any body. Poor gentleman, it is not half a century since he put forth his hand, to pick the pocket of George king of Britain, but he got his singers most woefully bitten, before he could pull them in again. But what is bred in the bone will never be out of the flesh; therefore as the English did not take care, effectually to secure themselves when they had it in their power, they must expect further experience of French theft.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would have thought that, the English have had so many instances of royal thest, from that quarter, that they would have effectually prevented future danger-from thence. Nor are our good friends the Spaniards less in∣clined to the thievish practice than their neighbours; wit∣ness Peru and Mexico, those once opulent and populous
<PB N="75" REF="027249_0074_0FD3EBF1CC6274B8"/>kingdoms, which now belong to them in the same manner, as the purse of gold belongs, to the highwayman, who took it from the gentleman he murdered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, sir, great thieves are abundantly more hurt∣ful to mankind, than thieves of a dwarfish size; tho' fa∣mous Tyburn, and the places a-kin to it, seldom have the honor of ushering them into the other world.</P>
<P>The third canton is the liars canton, a people with double tongues, and of the nature of an otter, amphibious; the great Belzebub himself is grand president here, but is repre∣sented by two famous deputies, namely the artful Maho∣met, and the good old gentleman at Rome. Of the two the latter is most in favour at court, because, as Belzebub says, he is so very much of his own image; although it must be owned, Mahomet bears a very great resemblance. All the holy fathers, my lords the inquisitors, with their assistant familiars. All the venerable patriarchs, and prince∣ly cardinals, reside in the metropolis near the exchange, in the principal street, which is a straight thoroughfare to hell. The bishops of both ranks, are stationed next to them, and greatly facilitate the journey of passengers. The very populous suburbs are inhabited by the sons of St. Ignatius; than whom, none are more excellent at the arts of lying and evasion; and here too are abundance of friars of every order, who though less crafty than the jesuits, are very diligent in the great work of deceit. In this country, po∣liteness and learning have arrived at the greatest perfection, here are abundance of courtiers, and statesman, besides a∣theisls and deists, highly esteemed by our people, for their learning and sense.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> court liars, are like a dead fish, they always swim with the stream of power. They are for or against stamp-a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and general warrants, just as the sentiments of their superiors direct; they are Protestants, or intollerant papists, or neither, just as their prince is inclined, or as their own interests require. Their consciences are as ten∣der
<PB N="76" REF="027249_0075_0FD3EBF3462E7948"/>as a willow, and will turn any way with the application of a purse of gold, a place, a pension, or a peerage. When it serves their low and base purposes, you will find them pa∣triots, but if the good of the nation clashes with their sinis∣ter views, you may find them traitors, either to church or state, or to both. Of this class were Bonner and Gardin∣er, zealous Protestants in the days of Edward the sixth, and bloody papists in the reign of his sister of scarlet memo∣ry. To this class also belonged Sharp, the archbishop of St. Andrews, for it was not conviction but gold, that changed his sentiments, from presbtery to prelacy. All the argu∣ments which my lords, the bishops of England had advan∣ced, made no more impression upon him, than an arrow would have made upon a rock of flint; but when his mo∣jesty came in a rhetorical manner, to press him home with a heavy purse of gold, a coach and six, and a bishopric, he was quite confounded, and had not a word to say for mother kirk of Scotland. Such court arguments as this, sir, stop the mouths of many a patriot; lord C—m is a recent proof of this. Such was the force of his elocution, that it could gain battles, subdue states, reverse laws, and make placemen tremble, till he was unhappily confounded by a place, a pension, and a peerage; and now, poor gen∣tleman, he has nothing left to gratify his ambition, but the melancholy reflection of what he once was.</P>
<P>There is another herd of court liars, (excuse the phrase, sir, because it is the common opinion, that of all vermin, court liars are the most detestable) who fawn like a spaniel upon every prince, that ascends the throne, in order to ingratiate themselves into his favour, thereby to make sure of their own emolument. If the manners of the prince are ever so dissolute, they caress him as their most wise and a∣miable monarch. Tho' he were as much of a dastard as Sardanapalus, they will persuade him that, he may vie with Hector for magnanimity. If he is a drunkard, or glut∣ton, they will flatter him with his temperances or repre∣sent
<PB N="77" REF="027249_0076_0FD3EBF50AA3E850"/>his luxury as a princely virtue, very becoming a royal personage; even if one half of his subjects be famishing for want of bread. Some of those court liars will tell their prince, that it is no crime at all for him, to enter his neigh∣bour's territories, and murder twenty or thirty thousand of his subjects, tho' there is really no cause given on their part, for the hostile invasion. Some such villains precipitated Louis of France into a war with Britain, which would infalliably have proved his ruin, had he not been well be∣friended by some people near St. James's.</P>
<P>A truly patriotic courtier is a strong pillar to the throne, but court liars, are the destruction of that prince whose ear they govern.</P>
<P>It is my opinion, that a prince has need either to be a very wise man himself, or to have very honest men about him. Happy is that nation who has a wise and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent king, and at the same time honest and faithful ministers. Earthly thrones are so infested with fawning flatterers, that if the prince is not very well acquainted with his bible, it is difficult for him to know, whether he is virtuous or vi∣cious.</P>

<P>True, and by those means princes are more readily deceived. For a mitred courtier may, perhaps, tell his prince, that it is lawful for a royal personage, to deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch the wife or daughter of one of an inferior rank, but unlawful for a plebian; notwithstanding his spiritual lordship knows very well, that when God said, "Whoremongers and adulterers I will judge," he exempted not the prince any more than the peasant, for with him there is no respect of persons, on account of their worldly dignity.</P>
<P>Another right reverend courtier tells his prince, that it is allowable enough in him, on the Sabbath, after the irksome
<PB N="78" REF="027249_0077_0FD3EBF70B9B4488"/>service is over at church, to divert himself with a quiet, civil game at chess, quadrille, or whatever his pious inclination leads him to; and that it may be lawful for some favourite nobility to assist at the sport; but, says he, it is utterly un∣lawful for the husbandman and low mechanic; though the downy doctor knows well enough, that when the Almighty sanctified the Sabbath, it was not a part only, but the whole Sabbath he intended.</P>

<P>Well, Impiator, whatever licence the right rever∣ends allow at court, their sable brethren in the country are not less indulgent; for in most parishes in England the people may swear or pray, get drunk or communicate, go to church or or stay at home, get to heaven or hell, just as their inclina∣tion leads them, for any concern his reverence the parson gives himself, provided always he is not cheated of his dues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, I am well befriended by many clergymen; but to return to the prince, I assure you I have often thought that, of all men, it is the greatest difficulty for him to be a good man, and get safe to heaven. He has so many about him, who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> base enough to commend even his vices, and but very few who love him well enough to correct his errors. But if I become a moralist now, you'll suppose I act out of character. However, many have exhausted all their wit and good nature upon the court liars, they are still the same, they lie as fast as ever for the sake of money, estates, high places, &amp;c. therefore some people call them mercenary liars.</P>
<P>But many of the inhabitants of this canton are less ambiti∣ous, and will very freely tell lies for a penny gain; amongst those are the travelling tradesmen, who carry their shops upon their backs. Them we call the petty dealers, and the hum∣ble l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs. But we have others more generous still, who will give you a lie fresh from the mint, with no other view but to raise a laugh: these we call the merry liars, because they go laughing to hell. Others we have who stand in the ca∣pacity of godfathers and godmothers, who very roundly pro∣mise and vow for to do for the child what they never in∣ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="79" REF="027249_0078_0FD3EBFC5A991CD0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> people call them the fool-hardy li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Next to them reside a very venerable tribe, called by the name of reverend liars. Reverend, because in holy or∣ders; and liars, because they tell my lord bishop, that they are moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon them the office of a deacon whereas they are moved by the hope of a good living, not knowing that there is such a being as the Holy Ghost; and deeming it enthusiasm to profess to be moved by him. When once put into orders, and a benefice, those worthy gentlemen rave against all who profess to be influ∣enced in their devotion, by the holy Spirit, as fanati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, en∣thusiasts, and mad-men. Now either my good friend the parson lies to my lord bishop, or his congregation; but the truth is he lies to both.</P>
<P>The fourth canton is, that of Sabbath-breakers, which is a very populous, polite, and opulent canton indeed. The far greater part of the nobility, and other gentlemen of rank and fortune, reside here: they are too well bred to worship God on Sunday, in public or private. They scorn to suppose themselves indebted to the Almighty for life, and bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, and all things; or to be accountable to him for the use they make of their time, estates and talents. They leave it, to the low-lifed mechanics, to go to church or meeting, or when there, to be devout and take notice of what they are about. Let the parson talk about heaven, or hell, or what he will, they are unconcerned, never once supposing them∣selves endued with immortal souls.</P>
<P>There is my good friend, my lord Time-lagg, a noble∣man of the first distinction; he is so taken up through the week with contriving how to provide for himself, and his creatures, that he is in no condition to go to church on Sun∣day, but chooses some convenient part of it for an airing; either in the coach with my lady, or on horseback with his consin, 'squire Idle. Mrs Housekeeper also is very closely employed in preparing tea and chocolate against their re∣turn. Mr. Steward is very busy in preparing his rent∣rolls,
<PB N="80" REF="027249_0079_0FD3EBFDED39E180"/>studiously contriving how to extract an estate for him∣self, out of his master's, so that he cannot go to church at any rate. The footman and my lady's woman must needs attend their master and mistress, the coachman and postil∣lion must guide the machine; the butler and groom must be within call, one to take care of the horses, and the other to furnish with claret or champaign; so that the minister is very little obliged to his lordship for finding him an auditory to preach to.</P>
<P>The London tradesmen come up as near to his lordship's example as their circumstances will admit of; their spirits are quite exhausted with the fatigues of weekly business, therefore instead of leading their families duly to church, you may meet squadrons of them every Saturday night and Sunday morning, going to regale themselves with a Sun∣day's pleasure, which consists in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ating, carousing, and riding.</P>
<P>Then there is your Sabbath-day visitors; very genteel people. The tea-table gossips are much concerned here, and hear you may find hundreds of tables, the conversation of which is supported at the expence of the reputation of some absent; for it must be observed that our gossips are so absolutely destitute of innate ideas, and are such perfect strangers to the affairs of civil life, that they cannot support conversation five minutes at a sitting, but by the help of slander. Hence some people have faid, that slander is the very soul of conversation. And sure enough if you will pick out all the slanderous expressions from the conversation of our gossips, you will have but a very scanty fragment re∣maining.</P>
<P>There are others so given up to indolence, that they keep great part of the Sabbath in bed, on a couch, or in the easy chair; these people are so exceedingly opprest with the weight of their own bodies that they can attend at neither church nor chapel, although active enough the other parts of the week; and yet they are good Christians, and hope to
<PB N="71" REF="027249_0080_0FD3EC00642A0A98"/>go to heaven when they die; and yet they seldom think of any thing, but living for ever, in order to which they eat, drink, and sleep away the Sabbath. These go by the name of lazy Sabbath-breakers, and all who are employed the whole morning, in preparing superfluities for dinner, live along with them.</P>
<P>Another class of Sabbath-breakers, consists of the petty dealers, who by or sell commodities, for back or belly, on the Sabbath day. We call them the mistrustful Sabbath∣breakers, because they cannot trust God with their custom∣ers; and slothful Sabbath-breakers, because they do not pro∣vide for their families, on the six days appointed for labour. England, with all its bravery, is horribly disgraced by a set of pros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne people, such as gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs, chandlers, butch∣ers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bers, and bakers; who will n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t miss the taking a∣penny on the Sabbath, any more than another day. Besides them, there are taylors, mantua-makers, and shoe-makers, who with their late finishes, make great encroachments on the Sabbath, and that in the most open manner.</P>

<P>I thought, in England, the law had made pro∣vision against such enormous breaches of the Sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do indeed make provision for the suppression of such vices, but I have the pleasure of seeing the enforcing of those laws, very often, left with people, who are entirely devoted to my interest; so the laws are frequently asleep, when I am awake and upon my rounds.</P>
<P>But there is another tribe against whom there is no hu∣man law. I mean the thinking Sabbath-breakers; a careful, industrious set of people, esteemed by all and known but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w. They are constantly employed through the week, and are glad of the Sabbath's approach, that they may re∣pair their bodily fatigue, and give a free scope to their plod∣ding minds. When they awake on the Sabbath morning, they are deeply contempla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing some transactions of the past week, or concerting measures proper to be followed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing. Nor does the man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lter his subject when he goes
<PB N="82" REF="027249_0081_0FD3CD8491CB5410"/>to church. No, he is quite uniform, try him, and you will find him all of a piece. Let the parson choose what subject he will, the other sticks to his text; so that it often happens when the minister thinks his auditory is collected, and the bulk of his parish appear at church, he is mistaken, for the greatest part of those whom he thinks to be present are only there in appearance: their minds, their better part, being absent on other occasions.</P>
<P>For instance, the parson sometimes thinks, that he sees 'squire Folly and madam his lady, in the front pew of the right hand gallery: but he is mistaken, for only their bodies are there, their minds are absent. As for the 'squire, he is busy chasing the hare or fox, over all the hedges and ditches in his manor; and his lady is mentally at this ball, or the other assembly, or at this play, of the other opera; or perhaps she is cheapening silks at Mr. Caut's, silk-mercer, on Ludgate-hill.</P>
<P>Sometimes the merchant seems to be at church; however he is only there in body, his soul having sailed in the good ship Bonaventure, to buy slaves on the coast of Guinea, or barter goods at Bengal or Malabar. The mercer, draper, and grocer, seem sometimes to be there, but frequently it is an imposition, for although their bodies may indeed be present, their souls are gone on a journey, to visit their cus∣tomers, or are left at home in the counting-house, balancing their books; examining their tradesmen's bills, that they may know with whom they can deal to the greatest advan∣tage. Perhaps issuing forth a capias against 'squire Latepay, a gentleman well known to those dealers; or it may be, the soul is busy, entering protests against certain extrava∣gant manufacturers.</P>
<P>As for the industrious farmer, you may well think, he has something else to employ his mind, than either sermon or prayers; for it must needs require much thought and forecast to determine right, where to sow his wheat, where his clover, and what land to set apart for hemp; how to
<PB N="83" REF="027249_0082_0FD3CE45F978B908"/>dispose of his young colt, and the grey horse, who is in danger of losing his eyes. And he, good man, hath found from long experience, that he can contrive better at church than any where else; and being willing to thrive in the world, he will let slip no opportunity proper for advantage∣ous consideration.</P>
<P>But I can tell you, sir, if the people so frequently put the cheat upon their parson, he in his turn retaliates upon them; and many times when the congregation flatter them∣selves that, they see the parson in and hear his voice from the pulpit, they are mistaken, for it is only his body, his soul being attending the levee of this nobleman, or the o∣ther bishop, making his court for a fatter benefice. These, sir, are some of the thinking Sabbath-breakers.</P>
<P>Then there are the mad Sabbath-breakers, a set of the ve∣ry dregs of humanity, and yet by some means or other their impious practices are connived at, notwithstanding interdict∣ed by all laws divine and human. Such are our pellet throwers in Yorkshire and Durham, our foot-ball tossers, who are sound all over the nation; our leapers, runners, tavern-hunters, and all of every denomination, who exer∣cise themselves in any sport on the Sabbath, are stationed a∣long with the mad Sabbath-breakers.</P>
<P>Last of all there are our religious Sabbath-breakers, a district that is formed of party zealots, and self-seekers, both preachers and hearers. As for the former, their doc∣trine is various, one man preaches the pope, another, preaches the councils, one preaches St. Dominie, another, St. Francis. One preaches episcopacy, like the great Sacheveral, another preaches presbytery, as the only way of salvation. One preaches up mankind in general, and another preaches his own personal endowments in particular, but as for preaching Jesus Christ, that is quite foreign to their purpose, and is therefore left to be performed by o∣thers. Thus, sire, you have had a view of the canton of Sabbath-breakers.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE VI. FASTOSUS and AVARO.</HEAD>
<P>PRIVY to the appointment betwixt Fastosus and Avaro, I resolved to stay their coming, and had not been long before I saw them at a distance, walking up the valley towards me. Arrived at the usual place of conference, Fastosus struck twice with his rod on the earth, and instantly there arose two thrones of the blackest ebony, one of which he occupied himself, and the other was filled by his cousin Avaro. Thus enthroned, Fastosus opened the conversa∣tion, whilst I seized my pen, and sat eager to catch the fleeting sound.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Avaro, when we parted in the morn∣ing, I was going to assist my lady Gaity, to dress for her visit to my good lord Frolick. I went accordingly, and hard work I assure you we had of it. As soon as I appear∣ed before the toilet, I received orders to render myself in∣visible, and not to depart the room, that I might be in rea∣diness to adjust the head-dress, and bosom ornaments. Yes, madam, said I, I will give your ladyship due attendance; with that I rendered myself invisible to her, but continued visible to all other beholders. So to dressing we went. First we ornamented the feet, which was attended with very considerable difficulty; it cost us several tyings and
<PB N="85" REF="027249_0084_0FD3EC0308B026D0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tyings before her ladyship was pleased with her own foot. At last having finished the feet, and my lady viewed them several times in every position, we proceeded to other parts of the important work. First, we did and then we undid every part of the finery▪ But our hardest work about the head and bosom was how to put one as much as possible out of its native form, and to expose the other, so as to make sure of attracting the eyes of beholders. Monsieur Frissieur, who was our assistant, gave it as his opinion, that to come up to the very zenith of the mode, it was necessary she should bear an head as much as possible, in resemblance to a ram without horns; and Mrs. Prude, my lady's woman, told us plainly, that Mrs. Pander, whose province it is to establish female customs, had expressly declared, every lady worth above one hundred a-year, ought in a full dress to wear her bosom quite naked. My lady is adorned with excellent hair, but it will not serve her except it bear a look the most unnatural possible. Her skin, fair as alabaster, we were o∣bliged to daub with patches, the colour of Belzebub's coat, as a token of her loyalty to the black prince of the nether regions. But how to place these patches was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>stion of no ordinary concern, and hardly resolved at last▪ First, we tried one large patch on her chin, but my lady soon per∣ceived that it had the beauteous dimple, which nature had there imprest, and therefore it was presently removed. Then we tried how the cheek would answer, but alas! it obscured the lively rose, which is a native there, and which my lady takes great delight to view in her glass; on this account we exempted the cheek from the burthen. At last, after much anxiety, and very serious consideration, it was resolved that we should six it on the middle of her forehead, resembling the eye of a cyclope, and put a little one on the left side of her chin, bearing the likeness of a mole. How∣ever, it cost several trials with them in both places, ere the patches would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> agreeable to her ladyship's fancy.</P>

<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Fastosus, if the ladies only knew, how ri∣diculous they make themselves look in the eyes of the judi∣cious, they would be very loath thus to deform their native beauty. What delicate beauty? What perfect comeliness do we see rendered disagreeable, and ridiculous by these transformations. And how can they be but disagreeable and ridiculous, when all the decorations of nature lie concealed, and nothing appears but the manufactory of art, that great supplanter of nature? Such ladies are certainly greatly deceiv∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by you, Fastosus; for the end proposed by all those meta∣morphoses is, to render themselves agreeable to the gentle∣men, whereas they produce the contrary effect. Art can ne∣ver beget love. This is nature's work alone. Art may in∣deed excite lust; but nature alone begets that love which a virtuous lady would strive to obtain. It is strange. Fas∣tosus, that nature has so little, and affectation such great concern among people of fashion as at this day? Well, I hope you pleased her at last?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I hope I did, but my work did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> end with madam; for Mrs. Prude, her woman, who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assisting us in the the equipment of her lady, and often p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her tongue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cheek, and bit her lip, to prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laughing out, when she saw her mistress's vanity. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s soon as I had done with her lady, beseeched me that I would put a few pins into her cloaths, because she was to attend her mistress to lord Frolick's; and notwithstanding my pati∣ence was almost spent before, I was obliged to stay ever so long, pinning and unpinning her, for Mrs. Prude affected the fine gentlewoman, almost as much as her mistress.</P>
<P>But what vexed me worse than all the rest, was just as I got to the bottom of the stairs, to make my escape, the cook-maid caught me in her greasy arms, and begged me to assist her to dress herself in her half-holiday cloaths, as her sweet-heart was to take the advantage of her lady's absence to come and visit her. I could not deny the girl, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cause I thought she really had need of considerable amendment
<PB N="87" REF="027249_0086_0FD3EC0858F95368"/>before she presented herself to her lover. So after we had pinned and unpinned a considerable time, I burst through the casement, to avoid the importunity of the laundry and chamber-maids, whom I saw coming. Thus I gave them the slip; for those ladies and their female attendants, would drudge any devil in hell off his feet, might they have their own way. But I am right glad that I am come hither from among them.</P>

<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, sir, I perceive with all your greatness, you have no objection to assisting a waiting-woman or a cook-maid occasionally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No objection at all, cousin; the soul of a waiting woman will sill a vacancy in hell, as well as that of her lady. The difference is this; the lady of honour is capable of drawing more to hell along with her, than the waiting-wo∣man can, therefore I choose to make sure of the mistress, and for the most part the maid comes along by her example. But as soon as we get them safely inclosed within our flam∣ing prison, we let them see we are no respecters of persons; for the mistress and her maids, my lord and his valet, the 'squire and his groom, have all the same apartment allorted them, feed all at the same table, drink of the same cup, and are served by the same devil, whom they never find to be sparing of his liquor? but to serve them plenteously, though much contrary to their inclinations.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That doctrine you unpreach when you attend up∣on them, Fastosus. You wisely keep your thumb upon that, and indeed it is well so to do; for comely as your appear∣ance is, they would discard you else. Serious thoughts of futurity would spoil all our sport, uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Avaro, I am not such an half-wit as to tell my lord, that his riches and grandeur, if nor duly im∣proved, will sink him lower in the bottomless abyss, than the rustle plebcan; nor am I such an inconsiderate devil, as to tell him that his hunting hawking, horse-coursing, cock∣fighting, card-playing drinking, swearing, whoring, &amp;c.
<PB N="88" REF="027249_0087_0FD3EC0C75951250"/>are the broad ways to never-ending torment. Neither do I foolishly tell, my lady, that balls, assemblies, plays, &amp;c. are the rosy paths which lead most infallibly to ruin. No no, let me alone for that: I warrant me I can keep my counsel well enough; and as for them they will find all out at last, without any instruction.</P>

<P>If I remember right, Fastosus, when we parted last, you were relating the manner in which you made your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rance good amongst men; I should be glad, sir, if you will be so obliging as to finish that account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I purpose it. Avaro. You may remember I told you that, great Belzebub, having discovered the woman, to be the weaker vessel, he made no attempts upon the vir∣tue of the man, but resolved, by all means to seduce the woman, not doubting but she would bring over her husband to our interest along with her. It happened one night that Adam had a dream, ominous of our conquest, which made him very fearful, lest any part of his, or his wife's conduct, should promote the dire event; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erefore he reasoned with her, concerning their duty to their Creator, gave her the strictest charge, to keep out of the way of temptation, and withal informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he was not without his fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even upon her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But she for her part, just as the devil would have it, resolved to separate herself, from her husband that day, which she had never done before. Whether she thought to endear herself more to him, by letting him see how well she would resist temptation, if any should offer, or took it rather ill, to be under his tutorage, I pretend not to say; but mangre all his intreaties, she would go forth, by herself, into a distant walk, to gather some delicious berries, for an innocent repast for her and her lord, at noon.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity, just to Belzebub's wish, and he took care to improve it to advantage. I told you before, that previous to this, he had possessed the body of a beautiful snake, in those days man's familiar domestic; and now finding Eve at a distance from her husband, the serpent
<PB N="89" REF="027249_0088_0FD3CDE5880135A8"/>discovered himself to her, and with more than animal ges∣tures attracted her eye. Captivated with its unusual motion, she stood ravished with its beauties, and admiring its agility. As it drew near to her, she put forth her gentle hand, stroked its skin, and the subtile animal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after its manner, returned the compliment by laying its shining head on her lap. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation was near to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, upon which the forbidden fruit luxuriously hung. To this tree the serpent frequently looked with all the languishment of ardent desire, till once be made sure that the woman observed it. Lye still, thou pretty creature, said she, (stroaking it) what makes thee look so earnestly at that prohibited fruit?" "Ah! thou fair goddess, return∣ed the serpent, I have good reason to admire the sovereign virtue of that delicious tree: for I was created only in a brutal station, without consciousness of mind, or the use of my tongue; till being on my thoughtless ramble yesterday, I chanced to espy this amazing tree, whose fruit hang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in such luxuriance. After a sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> pause, such as a brute may be capable of. I climbed up the tree, and began to feast on the most delicious fruit that ever was eaten. Joyful at my hap∣py fate, I soon became sensible of a self-conscious mind, capable of discerning between good and evil. Soon my tongue, which before cleaved to the roof of my mouth, was united, and I could express sentiments of joy in the most rational manner. And now when I met with you, I was going to renew my repast on the fruit of that sovereign tree.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 43.</NOTE>. He asked her, if the reason why she was so divinely beautiful, was not her feeding often upon the fruit of that so sovereign a tree? The woman answered, "No, we have never so much as once tasted of it, but invariably ob∣served the command of our great Creator, who hath put us into this garden, and said unto us, "Of every tree of the garden ye may freely eat, but the fruit of the tree of know∣ledge, of good and evil, ye may not eat, for in the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die." To whom the serpent. "In∣deed! Did he really say so? Are you not mistaken think you? Die too! why am not I dead then, I who have eaten of it so plenteously? No, no, you shall not die. That is only an empty threatening to keep you in subjection to him; for he very well knows, that the moment you eat thereof, you shall be like himself, knowing good and evil; no lon∣ger be man and woman, but become gods."</P>
<P>The woman replied, "Aye, but my pretty creature, how shall I know that I shall be a goddess, if I should ven∣ture to eat of that desirable fruit." "Know! said the ser∣pent, you may easily know it, if you consider that, if I, who was created only a brute beast, am by eating the fruit of this tree, exalted to humanity, you, who are more than half a God already, shall certainly, by so doing, be exalted to real divinity." With these words he injected into her bosom some seeds of my nature, which fermented to that de∣gree, that nothing would now serve her turn but to be dei∣fied. Sagacious Belzebub, perceiving the uproar I had made in her mind, introduced all the train of real vices, which now infect the human species; subjected her wholly to his sway, and she as his instrument, could have no rest till she got her husband's neck also fast in Belzebub's yoke.</P>
<P>Thus was pride first introduced into the terrene creation, and thus was man subjected to my powerful sway. Being brought forth in the heart of man, I arrived instantly at full growth, involved them in sorrow, enveloped them in blind∣ness

Instead of becom∣ing gods, I transformed them into the image and likeness of father Belzebub, in which image they begat and brought forth their children. It was now that I begat the lovely Discordans; to us the more lovely, because he is antinatu∣ral▪ No sooner was he born, but he sounded a trumpet, and cried, "To arms, to arms."

<P>All this worked just as the devil would have it; and greatly enlarged the territories of hell, by annexing earth to the infernal crown. Well, uncle, I perceive by your account, that you are the father of sin, in the mind of both angels and men.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Avaro, I am, and so well is my power established, that I am the very last that shall be subdued, and rooted out of the hearts, even of those that hate me, and who at last shall be delivered from my yoke. This is true, cousin, whether you believe it or not, and I assure you, that, I have the pleasure of giving many a painful heart-pang, even to those who curse my name and nature. But to my story, cousin, I manifested my powerful sway o∣ver man, in the case of my faithful servant Cain, not only in his bloody revenge against his brother Abel, who had revolted from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> government, but in making him despair under his punishment.</P>
<P>I triumphed gloriously over the inhabitants of the antidelu∣sion world, who for my sake, scorned to submit to the com∣mandments
<PB N="92" REF="027249_0091_0FD3EC0F08BC2CF0"/>of God, resolving to be guided by the thoughts of their own hearts, all of which were inspired by me, there∣fore every thought and imagination of the heart was only e∣vil continually. I wrought them up to such a degree of re∣bellion, that the Almighty resolved to bear with them no longer, but to sweep them away with the besom of destruc∣tion; yet he would not do it without giving them proper warning, and calling them to repentance and reformation. One, Noah, a famous preacher of righteousness, was the instrument raised up, on this occasion, and to be sure the man preached faithfully, and fervently; but I had the plea∣sure of hardening the peoples hearts to that degree, that he met with nothing but abuse for his pains. Every body ac∣counted him to be a frantic enthusiast, fanatic, or methodist; till the divine patience was quite worn out, and their de∣struction came upon them by a deluge, which swept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>em all from the face of the earth, except this same Noah and his family; and for my part I do not remember a time, on which hell had so many visitants at once as then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how could Noah and his family be saved, when the deluge came upon all the earth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Avaro, it was by the help of a ship, which he was taught to build. For this same Noah was the first ship-carpenter in the world, and although a prince, he was not above labouring with his hands. But it galls me to think, how the Almighty mixes mercy with judgment, for in this destruction which he brought upon the old world, he taught the new world the most necessary and useful art of naviga∣tion, by means of which, he will spread the knowledge of himself over all the earth.</P>
<P>After this I set up my lofty standard on the plains of Shi∣nar; multitudes flocked to it, and became my humble ser∣vants. It was now. I projected the scheme of erecting a tower equal in altitude to Jacob's ladder.

<PB N="93" REF="027249_0092_0FD3EC10F953FAC8"/>the second and greatest advantage would be, that thereby they might bid defiance to the Almighty. Such provision being made for their safety that, on the first ap∣pearances of judgment begun, they might retire to the tow∣er, where the waters could not follow them. But here you may observe, I played the devil with the children of men, for, although I flattered them with such advantages, I believ∣ed in my heart, that such a presumptuous, daring undertak∣ing, would have provoked the Almighty, utterly to have destroyed them root and branch. And indeed at one time I thought I had gained my po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, for he did come down and confound their language in such a manner, that the great design miscarried. It was diverting to hear the bricklayer call for mortar, and lo, a box of brick was brought him; another calls for bricks, and the server <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s for a board of mortar: one calls out for a level, and he receives a plumb∣line; another asks for a square, and a level is brought him. The bricklayers, provoked to see themselves mocked by their servants, not as yet knowing their language to be con∣sounded, began to lay their resentment upon the bones of their labourers; and the labourers considering themselves as very ill used, returned the abuse upon the builders, and thus they quarreiled and bickered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they were fain to leave off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he work, and beta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e themselves to other employments.</P>
<P>But alas! cousin, in this affair the devil was outwitted; for we all thought that this haughty attempt would have pro∣voked God utterly to destroy them; but he made use of our project only to send them abroad to people the earth, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> widely to make his glories known. And to the deep mortification of all our black fraternity, especially father Belzebub, upon the ruins of the tower was written, in e∣verlasting characters, the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

Wherever the sons of Noah went, I went along with them, and not a great number of years had the earth been dry, be∣fore I persuaded them to forge, found, and carve to themselves objects of religious adoration, more agreeable to their fancy, than the God who made them; and by this means it was, that pagan idolatry was introduced, which, strictly speak∣ing is the religion of pride alone; even as the present Ro∣man catholic religion is that of pride and covetousness.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often, sir, made honourable mention of the dutiful disposition of my dear children, the French parsons; but I had some years ago, occasion to try an experiment, which greatly quickened their devotion, and cloathed the face of all the country with poignant sorrow. By their un∣wearied pursuit of the interest of the church, that is to say, by their coaxing, wheedling, and threatening of people, out of their goods and chattles, for the benefit of the clergy; they were grown so fat and purse-proud, they were not able to say half of the masses they were paid for, nor to attend upon the duties of their pretended devotion; which persist∣ing in, they themselves would have contributed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the open∣ing of peoples eyes, to discover the cheat.</P>
<P>I imagined that nothing could be more suitable, than phy∣sic, to purge off some of their grossness. I went straight to Versailles, demanded an interview with the most Christian Louis, and accordingly was introduced by one of the lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his bed-chamber. As soon as he had done me greeting after the royal manner, proportionable to his very great esteem for me, I opened the conversation in the following manner: "My royal friend, said I, perceiving that you have been ransac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the world lately in quest of gold, to supply your pressing and growing wants, I am come to inform you where you may meet with store of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dores, yea, treasures in a∣bundance,
<PB N="95" REF="027249_0094_0FD3EC150638DD70"/>without travelling out of your own dominions." "Is it possible, said he, I pray thee lovely spirit, where are the golden heaps to be found?" I replied, "the clergy, the clergy, sir, are so overgrown in riches, that they are hardly able to say an hospitable mass for the dead, or even to go a∣bout to cheat and defraud people out of their money and souls as heretofore." "Ungrateful villains, said he, to hoard up their money to lie by them useless, when I, their king, am just at the point of becoming bankrupt. I'll ease them of their burden, I warrant you; I'll let them for once know, that they have another master besides the pope, and leave it to them to replace their stores the nearest way they can." I was not afraid but my scheme would work to my mind, for I took him at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick of time, when the king of En∣gland had emptied his coffers, by destroying his naval force and trade; and poor gentleman he knew not well how to fill them again.</P>
<P>Glad of such an opportunity, he assembled the heads of the clergy, and demanded of them an exorbitant sum, in the way of a free gift; a very genteel way of robbing the church indeed. The holy gownsmen, like dear children of their good Avaro, showed themselves as tenacious of their gold, as the paw of a lion is of its prey. They used every argument which priestly subtilty could invent; they lugged in both heaven and earth as protectors of their property; yea, they even told him that to command them to part with their money, was no less than robbing the Almighty, just as if the Almighty and them were partners in the trade of priestcraft. But clergymen have the advantage of all prin∣ces in that, their cause is always the cause of God; although God, has in reality, nothing to do with them or it. They held both with teeth and hands, rather than generously to assist their sovereign, though now become almost insolvent. But you know the proverb, "The weaker goes to the wall;" and so it was with them. He being stronger than they, pre∣vailed, and although their money came from their coffers
<PB N="96" REF="027249_0095_0FD3EC1840EA2950"/>like blood from their hearts, they were obliged to comply. But I can assure you, the parting with it cost them more real distress of soul, than ever the selling of their consciences to obtain it had done. The sorrow of the priests is for the most part a farce, but their sorrow on this occasion, was deep and unfeigned.</P>
<P>It was not a great while after that, moidores failed a se∣cond time, and other resources being drained, he again had recourse to the sons of the clergy; and did by them as they commonly do by the laity. I mean, their money being gone, he was content with stripping them of their plate; so that were you now to see the cabin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of a French priest, you would find it as empty of plate as Gland the shepherd's pantry. And I am of opinion, that Louis having found the way to their nest, he will take care, they be no more overgrown in riches. But to repair their late losses they can now look out for a prey, with as much penetration as an eagle, and are rapid as a panther in seizing on it.</P>

<P>It is my opinion, cousin, that, if princes were to take care that the church should not become too rich, there would not be so many religions as there are; but who would not be a priest, or a nun, when they may r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll amidst the blessings of both worlds; and under the pretence of religious retirement, enjoy every thing grateful to the flesh, in the greatest luxuriance, without any labour or toil of their own.

<P>Being a priest is not such a great privilege now as it has been, though it is still preferable to any trade of the lay kind, the expulsion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esuits has been very in∣jurious to priestcraft. The church is sure to thrive in the reign of a prince who is under the direction of a jesuitical confessor: and the priesthood will always find in him a pow∣erful protector: but I fear much that the princes of Eu∣rope from their late advances, will at last throw off the yoke of ecclesiastical tyranny.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE VII. INFIDELIS and IMPIATOR.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what I had heard and seen, you may think I took care not to be too late, in attending the fable gentry in Horrida Vallis, where I was got before any of them ar∣rived; and prepared for taking down their discourse, the first of which, that I heard, was by Infidelis to Impiator.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>How illustrious is thy throne? How extensive are thy dominions, oh! great Impiator, my son! Before you the greatest grandees of the earth do bow. Will you please, my s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, to finish your account of the remaining part of your territories?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will sir, and you may observe that the fifth can∣ton is that of the adulterers and fornicators. These are di∣vided into literal and mystical. The class of literal adulter∣ers and fornicators, are so fashionable and notorious a peo∣ple, that a description of them seems unnecessary; and so very disagreeable, that it would be offensive to you. I shall therefore do no more than describe their dwelling, and as∣sure you, sire, that every individual of them is a very humble servant to your son Impiator. Their dwelling is on the
<PB N="98" REF="027249_0097_0FD3EC1990E45B28"/>banks of a river, the source of which is in the court which runs through every part of the king's dominions, carrying the inhabitants along with it; and at last disembogues itself in hell, where all adulterers and fornicators shall infallibly be tormented, as a proper counter-balance for their fleshly pleasures; where instead of women, they shall have devils; instead of wine, the sulphurous liquid; and instead of beds of down, the boisterous billows of Phlegethon.</P>
<P>Next to them are the mystical adulterers and fornicators. By whom I mean, all that have any commerce with the whore of Rome, that old bawd with the scarlet gown: or in other words, all who have the mark of the beast, either on their foreheads, or their right hands, and such who have this mark upon both.</P>
<P>By those who have the mark of the beast upon their fore∣heads, I mean the worthy preachers and hearers of the Ar∣minian doctrine of the church of Rome; as also the strait∣hooped gentlemen, who believe with the charitable Italians, that there can be no true faith but that which they profess, nor salvation but in their community. The far greater part of the clergy belong to the former, and the good Sandema∣nians, belong to the latter class of doctrinal papists, or my∣stical adulterers.</P>
<P>By these who have the mark of the beast upon their right hand, I mean the practical papists; the whole bulk of the holy catholic church, and besides them, all that do the works of the beast, after the example of that orthodox church. By the works of the beast, some understand every part of religion which is not founded upon scripture institution. Such, say they, are consecrating of churches, baptizing of bells, de∣dication of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eeting-houses to certain saints or angels, as the patrons of parishes; the worshipping of saints and an∣gels, by celebrating an annual festival in honor of their name; such are your observers of high festivals; abstinence from meat at certain seasons of the year; worshipping to∣wards the east, as if God were not every where present.
<PB N="99" REF="027249_0098_0FD3EC1B19DCBE28"/>Bowing at the name of Jesus, as if it was more august than that of Jehovah, &amp;c. Such, sir, with many more whom I might name, are the mystical adulterers and fornicators.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but my son, you have not told me which are the fornicators, and which the adulterers; I want to hear that, for the one is usually distinguished from the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir, they are distinguishable enough: for the practical profest papists, profess not the least degree of rela∣tion to Jesus Christ, as the head of the Christian church, but own themselves to be the adorers of the whore, who sits on many waters, are held to be the fornicators; whereas nominal protestants, profess themselves married to Jesus Christ, as the great head of the Christian church, and not∣withstanding this pretended marriage with him, maintain a doctrinal commerce with the whore of Rome; on which ac∣count they are to be held as the adulterers.</P>
<P>The sixth canton is the murderers habitation, which is divided into two grand divisions. In the first are murderers of others, these are subdivided into petty cantons. In the first of which live the mental murderers, just upon the fron∣tiers of the country. They are a people, who, without just cause, are angry with their neighbours; this lambent flame they inwardly cherish, till revenge is begotten along with hatred, envy, and malice; with them, therefore, nothing is wanting but opportunity to destroy the reputation and life of the object of their hatred, with safety to themselves; but very often it happens that their hatred and revenge destroy their subjects, ere they have an opportunity of avenging themselves. The verbal murderers live next to them, in a very spacious country, because they are very numerous. By the verbal murderers I mean, those who withhold from the character of others, the good which they do deferve, and speak of them the evil which they do not deserve; or even the evil which they do deserve, in a way, in which they would not wish others to speak of themselves, in like circum∣stances.
<PB N="100" REF="027249_0099_0FD3EC3F21DB5BC0"/>I attend, for my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in many companies, where the conversation cannot possibly be supported, for a quarter of an hour, but at the expence of some absent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and so fashionable is this, in polite life, that it is become a proverb. <Q>That scand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is the very life and soul of conver∣sation.</Q> To this petty canton belong all tale-bearers, back∣biters, railers, evil-furmisers, and particularly the very obliging gentry, who tack, But, to the end of all their en∣comiums on others, as <Q>He is a good sort of gentleman, But—or she is an agreeable lady enough, But—</Q> where you may observe, that little unintelligible word, But, stabs the gentleman and lady's reputation through and through.</P>
<P>Having past through this, you come into the country of those who murder with their looks. In this country you may see an eye to curse a man to hell and damnation, and an eye-brow, call a man a scoundrel, and knock him down. The Rev. Mr. Adam Gib, primate of the associate synod in Scotland, has lately had his heart wounded so deeply, by the looks of some of his elders, that it is thought he cannot recover the stroke as long as he lives; but for the good of the public, he hath prosecuted them before the presbytery, who, without enquiring into facts, sentenced the reputa∣tion of the irreverend elders to be hanged, drawn, and quar∣tered, to the great consolation of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s sufferer. As soon as you get out of this country, you come</P>
<P>Fourthly, Into a very extensive plain, inhabited by what may be called domestic murderers. A set of beings who murder with impunity, no suitable laws being provided against them.</P>
<P>Here dwells the parent who spends wastefully, what should regularly support his family, so that his chil∣dren are brought up in the most dissolute, and irreligious manner, as a preparati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the must vicious practices; hence, who her the children prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or vicious, strict equity accounts the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and careless parent the mur∣derer, Near to these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parents lives the lascivious
<PB N="101" REF="027249_0100_0FD3EC41AD8F1600"/>husband, who estrangeth himself from hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lawful consort, and frequenteth the company of lewd women. Many you may find here, who, as the very worst of selous, rob their wives and children of their legal property, to support the most infamous strumpets, who, like the horse leach, are continually saying, give, give. Such men are sure to find the truth of that saying. "A whore is a deep ditch." Here it is a very common thing to see the most virtuous women, so ill used by their murderous husbands, that they languish and grieve under their affliction, till at last they die of a broken heart. No assassin ever better deserved the gallows, than such husbands; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or no assassin ever put the person whom he murdered to equal torture. The very same may be said of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scivious strumpet, of high or low degree, who is false to her husband.</P>
<P>Among domestic murderers, live the parents who, for the sake of an agreeable settlement, oblige their children to marry, with persons whom they cannot possibly love. This lays a sure foundation for certain murder, and brings the party to the grave in the most distressing manner.</P>
<P>But if covetous parents, would only consider, that a com∣pelled marriage is worse than a poisoned dagger, pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nged into the bosom of their offspring; they would certainly have more compassion than to persist in the iniquitous measure. Here likewise live those, who restrain their children from marrying the objects of their choice, merely because there is a deficiency, of a few hundreds, or thousands in the fortune, Parents, who can relish nothing but money, and have a a wrong notion of honor, make no s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruple of conscience, to render their children miserable all their days, rather than suffer them to marry a degree and an half below themselves. It is very strange, that the laws of nations should make no provision against this murder; and stranger still that those of Britain countenance and encourage it.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027249_0101_0FD3EC4388E776F8"/>
However, marriages are seldom happy, where the affec∣tions are not joined, prior to the matrimonial ceremony. Money may unite the persons, but it cannot unite the affec∣tions, as appears in numberless instances: of which dis∣consolate, dull and heavy husbands, broken-hearted wives, frequent divorces, elopements, domestic quarrels, and di∣vided families, the natural effect of forced marriages are evi∣dences.</P>
<P>There is yet another species of domestic murderers, con∣nived at by the law. They are such who, not only train up their children in idleness, but in luxury and wantonness. By these means, their spendshrift sons, if of high birth, are fitted to become robbers of the nation, when their own fortunes are spent; and if of middle life, they are fitted for the high-way, and consequently for the halter. Nor is this method of training up, less fatal in its influence, on the female sex, for it prepares them for the stews, or the suburbs of the stews, where gentlemens courtezans dwell, perhaps for theft, and then for the gallows. Idleness and luxury, is as rank poison to the mind, as arsenick is to the body. Many people indeed, lament the young gentleman's unhappy fate when he is going to Tyburn; but very few censure his parents, as the first cause of his untimely end, by the manner in which they brought him up. This is some comfort to us however, that though such domestic murderers act with impunity from man, the law of God will take such notice of them, as to bring them to hell, if their crimes are not repented of. To be sure it would be more agreeable to us, to see them enter hell by way of Ty∣burn: but the devil cannot always have his will.</P>
<P>Another sort, are very careful to preserve the bodies of their children, by providing diligently for them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neces∣saries and conveniencies of life; as they grow up, are as careful to preserve them from the highway and the stews, by putting into their hands a business by which to obtain a comfortable livelihood; and after all prove the murderers
<PB N="103" REF="027249_0102_0FD3EC4514C1D3D8"/>of their children. For on the one hand, they restrain them not from bad company, which leads to destruction; compa∣ny that corrupt the principles, vitia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the conduct, and lead into bad practices; such as Sabbath-breaking, gaming, ly∣ing and swearing, &amp;c. Nor on the other hand, do they take any pains to cultivate their infant minds, further than to know how, when, and to whom they should make a gen∣teel bow and curtesy, and how to express the modish com∣pliments in a graceful manner. They never once deem it necessary to instill into their minds an early sense of religion and virtue.</P>
<P>Many parents, if their children learn a little polite beha∣viour, do not much care whether they read the bible at all.</P>
<P>In this country too dwell duellers, boxers, boasters, and provokers; all the bands of assassins, and intriguers against mens lives. His ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry holiness, is captain-general of this band, also his cardinals and inquisitors are next to him in honour. Here dwell persecutors of every name: popish, episcopal or presbyterian; all who impose religion on mens consciences by the power of the sword.</P>
<P>The second division is that of self-murderers, and I assure you, sir, this is a very populous place, more crouded than the former. Here dwell gluttons, drunkards, and intem∣perate persons in general; for there are more who eat and drink themselves to death, than the fever, the consumption, and the sword destroy. Idle, lazy, and slothful persons, live here, under the character of second-hand murderers, their idle habits introducing diseases of the most fatal nature. The immoderately careful also, kill themselves with mere anxiety. In the next town the envious are stationed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those who are as mortally wounded by the prosperity of their neighbour, as any man can be by a dagger. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> suburbs live those whom we call the impatient, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not so very deathly, as impatience under it.

<PB N="104" REF="027249_0103_0FD3EC46A9CB3FD0"/>latter live the lascivious, who kill themselves by little and little, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>boil their flesh, ere they present it to the worms. I might add to this list, a prodigious number be∣sides, known amongst us by the name of foul murderers; but as I was never very remarkable for knowledge in casuis∣tical divinity, I shall leave this to others, and proceed to</P>
<P>The seventh and royal canton of drunkards; which is di∣vided into two very grand divisions the first of which is in∣habited by the sot, and the second by merry companions. The soaking s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, are a well seasoned race, who seem as if some of their ancestors had been of the bristly kind▪ They are a swinish set of people, always grunting, but when their lips are in the cup, unless it may be, that the calf mounts them in the morning and rides them till half past two, then dismounts just in the middle of dinner, and the eager swine vaults into the saddle, and rides them till they are lame. The ensign of the sots division, is a long tobacco pipe, and greasy fore-breasts of a coat; and if any man have business with them, he would do well to wait on them in the morning, before the calf dismounts; for after that they can do nothing but grunt, till sleep dismount the pig again; thus they are ridden alternately by the calf and the pig. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> drink merely for the sake of liquor, and in process of time, their blood becomes so inflamed, that they carry the arms of their company upon their faces which are dyed into a kind of bastard scarlet colour, and grow as rough as the skin of a shark, with preternatural pimples.</P>
<P>The second division is that of merry companions, or ac∣cording to men of learning, good-fellows. They abhor the name, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the practice of drunkards; you could not af∣front the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse, than by telling them, they are in love with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, for the sake of her liquor. Were you to ask them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reasons for frequenting the tavern, they would soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you, that it is not for any love they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the liquor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> go there merely for the sake of good company. By the way, sire, they go to the wrong place
<PB N="105" REF="027249_0104_0FD3EC49C729C168"/>to seek for it, for no good company haunt taverns and ale∣houses. Good company is most likely to be found in good places, but taverns and alehouses, are quite of another cast, being public portals, through which many pass to the nether reigons. Yea, such a good opinion has Belzebub conceived of them, that many of the landladies, and their daughters, are appointed his factors and agents upon earth.</P>
<P>It is the practice of merry companions, to meet at the tavern, or some other place of public resort, as many even∣ings in the week as business will admit of, to read and ex∣pound the news-papers, give their opinion of the proceedings of the ministry, of commercial transactions, or to comment on the operations of war. Sometimes they meet to play what they call a civil game at cards, back-gammon, &amp;c. or it may be to reproach some neighbouring presbyterian par∣son, for his affected sanctity: for you must know that they not only hate sanctity itself, but its very appearance. Of∣ten you may hear them deride the fanatic, for what they call his narrow and biggotted spirit, and at the same time, ap∣plaud the reverend Mr. Live-loose, for an affable, free and generous soul. Many of those merry companions, who will by no means bear the name of drunkard, I can pick you out, who will drink a bottle or two at a sitting, and go home betwixt one and two in the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing with eyes as fierce as those of a hy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na.</P>
<P>In short, sir, if you were to go through my canton of drunkards, when our men are all at work, you would hear as great a noise, as if Vulcan with his cyclops were there, hammering thunderbolts for Jupiter. And would certainly imagine, that hell had burst its belly, and poured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> en∣trails amongst us, on account of the hideous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> swear∣ing, damning, sinking, scolding, and bawlin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and fighting, boasting, lying, cheating, and uncle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, looks and gestures, which there abound. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the royal canton, out of which I choose all my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> men; which you must own to be sound policy, for if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> get a man
<PB N="106" REF="027249_0105_0FD3EC49CF703D70"/>to become a drunkard, I can cause him to commit what wick∣edness I please; and I must tell you, that this canton is in∣habited by men of all ranks, occupations, and persuasions.</P>
<P>Thus, reverend father, I have given you a brief account of my dominions, but if you were to pass through the several cantons, and see them all yourself, you would say, that the hundredth part has not been told you.</P>

<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! my child! my dear Impiator, how my aged heart is filled with joy, on hearing your pleasing story. Illustrious indeed is the kingdom of Profanity. You honour me, my son! Your success does great honour to the name of Infidelis. But I pray, do you know any thing of a set of people, whom they call Nazarenes; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y are the only people in the world who have cast off my yoke. Oh! how it would rejoice me to hear, that your craftiness, had enga∣ged them in your service!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know them very well. A small body of despised, precise creatures, hated by all the world▪ I assure you, sir, I have done all that lies in my power, to bring them under our dominion. But mortified I am to tell you, that I have never been able to conquer one of them. Immanuel hath published very strict laws in his kingdom, absolutely pro∣hibiting his subjects from touching, tasting, or handling any thing that belongs to us, or so much as visiting our can∣tons; and they are so firmly attached to his government, that it is with the greatest difficulty, now and then, we get one of them down into our mines. But when such a thing does happen, my subjects have a good day of feasting and mirth; send gifts to one another, of such things as they have and the shouts of joy, "So we would have it," may be heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ll the cantons of our dominions.</P>
<P>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, it happened once that Noah, who was in the main, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ter enemy to our government, was induced to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the drunkards country, which caused much gladness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the land. The triumphal flag was dis∣played upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Ham, wherever the news were
<PB N="107" REF="027249_0106_0FD3EC24696AC498"/>spread, and every man reported to his neighbour, saying, "Behold he is become like one of us." At the same time, the confederates of Shem, covered themselves with sack∣cloth, put ashes on their heads, exchanged their pleasant songs for lamentations, mourning and woe; till the patriarch was safely returned to his own country again.</P>
<P>It happened also o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a certain time, that I was happy e∣nough to inveigie David the great, within the borders of the adulterers canton; who, to cover the infamy of such an ex∣pedition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hed with violent precipitation into the very heart of the canton of murderers. The monarch's arrival was soon proclaimed among all the murderers and adulter∣ers, who made a grand entertainment on the occasion, and invited the blaspheme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to partake with them. Oh! Infide∣lis, if you had been there, certainly you would have tired your sides with laughing, to see how they footed the treble dance, whilst the music played. "The best of them are as bad as ourselves" And all joined together in this chorus,
<Q><L>"What we do in public, they do in private,</L>
<L>"The difference is only in shew."</L></Q> Then they clapped their hands, and shouted, "So, ho! brave boys Now we are all on one side. The man after God's own heart hath joined our communion. The psalm∣ist of Israel is now one of ourselves. Hypocrites altogether, who pretend to more religion than others. Thus, sire, from the fall of one, our people concluded that all were bad.</P>
<P>The like fell out in the case of Peter, the Apostle, who, on a very dark night, missing his way, was first trapped in the liars share, and then in the swearers gin, so that he de∣nied the Lord who bought him, and cursed and swore, that he did not so much as know jesus of Nazareth. I can tell you when such a thing does happen, that we entrap one of the Nazarenes, it greatly encreaseth the industry of my sub∣jects, and bends them more than ever, under my yoke. Indeed, as there is no other way to Zion, but what lies
<PB N="108" REF="027249_0107_0FD3CD8D502B1D48"/>directly through the very heart of my dominions; there is now and then, one of them tumbles into our mines, especi∣ally in the dark and long nights of winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now and then, child! I thought you had often companies of them at once in your dominions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, I cannot say so. I'll tell you how the mistake happens. We frequently have companies of those who are called Nazarenes, it is true; but then the name and the nature, are two different things, all the world over. In order to bring true Christianity into disgrace: the great and wise Belzebub stirs up some of our country people, to put on the outward habit of the Nazarenes, join their com∣pany, and travel with them, almost to the borders of the kingdom of Profanity, but not one of them can be persuad∣ed to set a foot out of their own country. As those people pass along the road, in their own country, it is not much to be wondered at, if they do occasionally try their hands at their old employments. But as for the real Nazarenes, I assure you, I very seldom meet with one, who has curio∣sity so much as to view our land as he passes through it. E∣ven when our subtile emissaries do entrap one, let me and my chivalry do what we can, we never detain him beyond a cer∣tain time; when some powerful messenger is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spatched from the skies, to deliver him out of our tenacious hands. But we have the satisfaction of often procuring them an hearty drubbing, so that many of them afterwards go halting to their graves. I myself, have seen Immanuel meet them, in the very midst of our kingdom, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize, bind, and chastise them, till with blurred faces, they humbly submitted to kiss the rod, and heartily blessed God, that ever the birch-tree was planted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, child, they are made to kiss the rod, that is, the plagne of it; for then they bid farewell to the pleasures of Profant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Oh! were it but possible, by any means, to harden them against the rod, what advantages might we reap from it! Of indeed could we, as I have often strove
<PB N="109" REF="027249_0108_0FD3EC2A8811A898"/>to do, make them faint under it; it would answer the same end: but, beyond all our power to hinder, Immanuel does some how, along with the stroke, convey sustaining strength. Yea, sometimes, even makes the rod itself, in some respects, pleasant, and at all times profitable to them. Ah! my son, we shall never be able to rob him of one of his own, for when he chastiseth them with a visible hand, he sustaineth, and comforteth them with an hand invisible.</P>
<P>But let us not be discouraged, nor yield the contest. Let us destroy whom we can, and let us disturb, and distract the minds of those whom we cannot destroy. Let us think of the great Belzebub, what atchievements he is daily perform∣ing, notwithstanding he groans in the yoke of eternal despair? And for your encouragement, my dear Impiator, let me tell you, such is your care, to maintain a despotic sway over your subjects, and such is their attachment to your person and go∣vernment, that both you and they may be assured of warm lodgings in the palace of great Belzebub, as soon as this world ceaseth to be the stage of action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir. Such is the flourishing state of my king∣dom at present; but I have many shocks at one time and an∣other; it is but a few years since, I was terribly afraid, lest I should have lost my British subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lost your British subjects, my son! Who, or what is he, who dared to attempt any thing against the great Profanity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A powerful enemy, no less a person than George the third. He was an enemy to my power∣ful sway, when he was only prince of Wales, and as soon as he ascended the throne, he more openly shewed his dislike to me: publishing an edict for banishing me from his dominions, enjoined his officers to apprehend me, wherever I was to be found: and under the penalty of his displeasure, prohibited his subjects from entertaining me at any time, especially up∣on the Sabbath-day; a day on which I am used to get above
<PB N="110" REF="027249_0109_0FD3EC4B2C5B9358"/>double business done for Belzebub. Had I not been well be∣friended by the British nobility, as well as by the commons of the land, bad days had come upon me, for what will not precept, enforced by example, be able to accomplish?</P>
<P>Had he, like many princes before him, only enacted laws against me, and still continued to correspond with me him∣self, I should have had little to fear; but, would you think it, sir, he actually attempted to clear the court of me; will suf∣fer no swearing in his presence, nor gaming on the Sabbath evenings in his palace, and even discourageth drunkenness and debauchery. Indeed, sir, if inferior magistrates had all been of the same disposition, with their king, poor Impiator had been obliged to quit the realm, and live in exile, like the devil Crudelis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the king of England, is a sober and virtu∣ous prince, will admit of no dispute; but the case of Impi∣ator can never be desperate, whilst you and I are in such high esteem with so many magistrates and placemen. We shall be regarded much sooner than he. So long as inferor magistrates can be kept in subjection to us, there is no fear of our interest, let the prince be ever so virtuous. I as an old stander in the world, have seen much of mankind, and out of my consummate experience shall offer some things for your encouragement.</P>
<P>A good king may enact good laws, but it is impossible he should execute them without the assistance of his subjects; therefore your kingdom, my son, can never suffer, till a law be made, which shall render all common drunkards, swearers, Sabbath-breakers, whoremongers, extortioners, &amp;c incapable of the office of a magistrate. Whilst magi∣strates can suffer buying and selling on the Sabbath-day; whoredom, drunkenness, and swearing, to abound in the streets, with impunity, what hath Impiator to fear? Doth it not demonstratively prove, that such magistrates are firm∣ly attached to the devil Impiator. No danger, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no danger at all. Let the king and queen both abhor you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ver
<PB N="111" REF="027249_0110_0FD3EC2D08BE3860"/>so much, unless they can get men of virtuous disposi∣tions, established in places of trust, the devil Impiator shall reign in spite of all they can do to prevent it.</P>
<P>Do you think that a magistrate, who is himself a drunk∣ard, will ever strive to suppress the beastly sin of drunken∣ness in others? Or that he who is a profane swearer, and tolerates the practice of swearing in his own houshold, will ever exert his power to suppress it in others? Can it be thought, that a man who keeps his woman, instead of his wife, will be very assiduous to suppress the reigning sin of whoredom? Or, that he who can without conscience, grind the faces of the poor, will ever be a promoter of pie∣ty. Never fear it, Impiator. All you have to do is to de∣bauch the minds of as many magistrates as you can, then you will have the vulgar of course, when they see vice reign with impunity.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This second sighted devil, seems to have judged rightly of the case, for profaness of every kind, has made most awful ad∣vances in the present reign, notwithstanding the virtue of the so∣vereign. Divorces, consequent upon conjugal infidelity, were never so rife, since England became a nation. Masquerades and routs, which received but little countenance in some former reigns, in this, meet with all that the vainest heart can wish for. That this is the case, let Cornely's, the pantheon, and the fe∣male cotery bear witness.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all, sir, I think there is reason for some fear, when we consider the power of example. You re∣member how, according to tradition, it turned the heads of all the Macedonian army to the one shoulder, in the days of Alexander, and how it raised a hump upon most of the genteel backs in England, in the days of king Richard the third, of bloody memory. Now, sir, if example were to have the like effect at present, Impiator could not live in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible, son, that a virtuous example is not without its proper influence; but this I have always seen, people are more easily drawn by example, into vice,
<PB N="112" REF="027249_0111_0FD3EC4CA356B120"/>or even in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> things indifferent, than into virtue. Assure yourself it will require a stronger power than the example of the best and wisest of men, to draw a vicious person to the love of virtue.</P>
<P>Should the virtuous example of a prince have any influ∣ence upon others, you must take care to nick-name them, get them pointed and hissed at, and despised, and all will go on very quietly.</P>
<P>Let us go now in quest of our kindred, my son: I ex∣pected to have seen some of them here this morning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you shall have full conviction. Put the glass to your eye, and mind well, when I roll this ball on the green, and tell me what it appears to be?—Now, sir—you have seen it, what do you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am more astonished than ever. It appeared to be well nigh as huge as the body of Saturn, and seemed to roll through immeasurable space. Now I am convinced, incredulous as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>All is well, so far. Now you shall try the other end of the telescope, and learn the wonders of miniature. Let us look towards the other side of the valley. You see a very large oak whose arms are extended at least two hun∣dred feet in breadth. Do you not see it, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<PB N="116" REF="027249_0115_0FD3EC55CD727D58"/>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I see at a prodigious distance, some kind of a shrub, about the size of a common thistle, to me, it appears to be about fifteen inches high.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look stedfastly at it, sir—and see if you can find out what species it is of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take it to be a small oak plant, but at such a di∣stance, it is not easy to distinguish the species of such a dimi∣nutive shrub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, sir, I perceive, you discern it right, if you please you may take down the glass. You see, sir, the oak tree stands just where it did; and now you can discover no∣thing of the shrub. Believe me, sir, the plant, which you saw, is none other, than that stately oak, magically diminish∣ed in its appearance, by the power of the glass. The oak itself, hath undergone no change, neither did the ball, nor the molehill. All the change is only in appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed, at the astonishing powers of this instrument, when it is used one way, it magnifies a molehill to a stupendous mountain, and a tennis ball to a world; and when used the contrary way, it reduceth an oak of the most gigantic stature, into one of the most dwarfish shrubs. I pray you, cousin, what is the name of this instrument? And where was it invented?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the name of this amazing instrument, is PRE∣JUDICE, it was invented by Lucifer, the most famous ma∣thematician in hell; is of excellent use, in forwarding the delightful works of darkness, and securing the dominion of Belzebub, over mankind upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear cousin, I am quite impatient to have a des∣cription of its uses; it cannot fail being of excellent service, if skilfully managed, as I doubt not it is, in the hand of Dis∣cordans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, having already seen something of its amazing effects, you may well believe it is very useful to me. By this partial glass, it is, I sow contention, strife, and discord, wherever I come. It is my custom, when I begin my ope∣rations, and intend to set people together by the ears, to vi∣sit

I turn it towards himself, by which he obtains a partial view of his own virtue and merit. Then I apply the glass the contrary way, and direct my dupe to con∣sider his vices in the diminishing medium, by which he al∣most, if not wholly, looseth sight of them. Having had such a partial view of his own virtues and vices, the fool takes the former to be a thousand times greater, and the latter a thousand times less, than they really are; by these means he is so prejudiced, in his own favour, so far, that he is rea∣dy to quarrel with all who think not as well of him as he does of himself
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A recent instance of this effect of self-esteem, the author met with in his nearest religious connections, which he thinks meet to add to those instances of more ancient date.</NOTE>. Thus, I prejudice almost every man in his own favour, so far, that each looks upon himself as most worthy of general regard. From this, it is, that you may meet with a drummer who looks upon himself as more able to command well, than his colonel; or a catchpole, who deems himself fit for an alderman; and a scurvy attorney, who flatters himself, that he knows more than the lord chan∣cellor of the realm.</P>
<P>But for this prejudice in their own favour, you should never hear of revolutions of state, destructive wars, cruel assassinations, and domestic broils, amongst man∣kind so grateful to us infernal spirits. 'Tis by this device, you will find one fool wiser in his own conceit, than ten men who can render a reason. Yea, gentlemen, it is from the good opinion almost every man ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of himself, originally derived from the use of my partial telescope, that all divisions and animosities of every kind, and amongst ev∣ery people in church and state do flow. Though indeed, the gentlemen concerned in religious contentions, would per∣suade the world, that it is the glory of God, and the further∣ance of the gospel they have in view, in all their curses and
<PB N="118" REF="027249_0117_0FD3EC5714D21018"/>anathemas, which they toss and retoss against one another; the vulgar take it for granted to be so, and therefore readi∣ly join with their reverend leaders.</P>
<P>In the mean while, man being sufficiently prejudiced in his own favor, I betake me to the following operations from whence all jealousies, back-bitings, murmuring, evil-surmi∣sings, &amp;c. spring. I put the diminishing end of my tele∣scope to the eye of my dupe, and direct him thus, to be∣hold the virtue of his neighbour. The instance of the oak, reduced to the most diminutive shrub, will convince you that a man's virtue will appear little enough, if at all dis∣cernable, when viewed with my partial glass. So when the man with it examines the virtue of his neighbours, he is put to his wits end to find any virtue at all, just as you were to find out the oak: but he sees, as he thinks, too much cause to conclude, that his neighbour is a very bad man. And if such a thing should be, that a man's virtue is so strong, that it forceth evidence, even over the belly of prejudice, by its own native lustre; its appearance is chan∣ged from its reality, as the oak to the shrub, in the forego∣ing experiment.</P>
<P>Then I direct my disciple to apply the magnifying end of the telescope, and to take an ample view of his neigh∣bour's vices and deformity; and this he doth to the greatest advantage; the two instances of a mole-hill transformed to a mountain, and a rolling ball to a revolving world, will convince you, how glaring any man's vices will be, when viewed with the magnifying end of my valuable telescope, Prejudice.</P>
<P>On obtaining this discovery, says my dupe, "Ah! how glaring his vices appear! when I sought for virtue, I could not discern so much as the smallest of her traces in him; but now I seek for his vices, truly there is nothing else to be seen. Can this man be a Christian? No, surely! If this be Christianity, I will for ever renounce it." Thus, my ve∣ry reverend uncle, I frequently persuade people who are
<PB N="119" REF="027249_0118_0FD3EC5887DACDA0"/>really worthless, to despise, revile, and contemn those who are in every respect much preferable to themselves; to deny the character of virtuous men, even to the most virtuous of their day.</P>

<P>This glass is really more wonderful than the former. What an amazing power of invertion it hath, cousin? Why it transformeth light into darkness, and darkness into light; changeth the appearance of devils, into that of angels of

<P>This, sir, I call my inverting mirror; but the proper name of it is FALSE REASONING: An instrument of the true Luciferian construction, and most admirably a∣dapted to my dividing purposes. It is the oracle at which, for the most part, mankind enquire after the truth of any matter; but from what you have seen you will readily be∣lieve, that there is no truth in it; therefore its discoveries, if the truth were known, would be deemed absolute false∣hood. But I am very careful to keep up its honour with the people, as I could do but little business without it.</P>

<P>But for this inverting mirror, gentlemen, I could do but little against the children of men; for excellent as my telescope of Prejudice is, it would be altogether useless, but for the mirror: but by the help of this, the telescope per∣formeth mighty deeds in favour of our government.</P>
<P>By this mirror it is, I cause offence to be taken, when none is offered, nor designed; yea, even when the good of the party is sought after; and thus I ferment differences, a∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the most fervent solicitations for unity. A certain great man, some thousand years since, had such a proof of this, that he complained bitterly against our people, saying, "When I am for peace, they are for war."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="027249_0120_0FD3EC5C87FE43C0"/>
By this mirror it is, that public or private reproof is not only rendered useless but even hurtful to the party reproved, and frequently prejudicial to society. So very much are people given to examine all matters in our famous mirror, that it is almost impossible to point out one man in a whole county who hath wisdom enough to bear reproof with be∣coming patience. So that if it is an argument of folly, to turn away the car from reproof, or to harden the heart a∣gainst rebuke, these are brave days for folly.</P>
<P>By this wonderful mirror, I make even the preached word, not only useless to many, but offensive to some: for instance, it sometimes happens, that the preacher, as it is his duty, exclaims against drunkenness, at that instant I step up to the drunkard, hold the mirror before his eyes; immediately he begins to view the parson's conduct in a very uncharitable light, and as a guilty conscience needs no accuser, he con∣cludes it is himself that is aimed at. "Well, says he, I see how it is some spiteful person hath told him that I was drunk the other night, and he is wicked enough to expose me to all the congregation. Has he no faults of his own, that he can be so free in trumping up other people's failings? Cannot he preach the gospel without railing against individuals?"</P>

<P>By this time, I clap my telescope to his eye, and direct him to view the parson with it; which is no sooner done, than he exclaims, "Aye, aye, his vices are as great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mine! and greater too. If he is not a drunkard, he is something as bad; he is covetous, all know that; and he is uncharitable and spiteful." Then I turn the end of my telescope towards himself. "Well, saith he, the parson himself is more wicked by one half than I am, I meddle with no man's character, I am in charity with all men.— I am just and honest in all my dealings. If I hurt any bo∣dy
<PB N="122" REF="027249_0121_0FD3EC5EA1204150"/>it is myself, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> can the meddling fellow have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do with that?"</P>

By the use of these two fa∣mous instruments, I set one great man to pull the ears of another, at the various courts of earthly princes, where by my management the truly worthy are frequently dis∣graced, and the worthless advanced to power. What ups and downs succeeded each other in the court of Versailles, in the days of madam Pompadore, when not the merit of the hero, but his attachment to that lady, was considered? If he was a true Pompadorian, he was sure to be advanced, however much of the calf his disposition had imbibed: but if an anti-pompadorian down he came, though he were as wife as Ulysses, and valiant as the son of Thetis, and so it fared with them in their bad success in the late war.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, sir. The first instance I re∣member, was in the case of Cain and Abel. As for Abel, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was a rebel against our government, enlist∣ed under the banner of Immanuel, and bore arms against
<PB N="123" REF="027249_0122_0FD3EC62A9D9AB38"/>the monarch of darkness, to whom trusty Cain was firmly anached. Abel was well acquainted with the acceptable atone∣ment, then to be made by Jesus of Nazareth, and had re∣spect to it, in all the services which he offered to deity; his sacrifices and services were therefore the fruits of faith, and consequently acceptable to God whom he served. On the other hand, our friend Cain had no respect to the media∣tion of Immanuel, but considered his services as well de∣serving acceptance with the Deity, in virtue of their own in∣trinsic excellence. Of course both him and his services were rejected; for you know, whatever is not of faith, is sin, and consequently detestable to the Almighty. Abel offered his sacrifice, and Cain presented his gift; the one in faith, and the other without faith; the result was, Abel was accepted and Cain rejected.</P>
<P>As soon as I was aware of this, and saw discontent visible upon his countenance, I went up to Cain, and began to ply him with my instrument. "Let my lord Cain, said I, try his brother's conduct in this faithful mirror; accord∣ingly he viewed it, and as he viewed, he said, "Ah! now I see how it is,—he knew that a lamb, or kid, would be more acceptable to God than corn; he would not inform me, I suppose, lest I should share in the blessing: Is this acting the part of a brother? I see now through all his pretended love, his whining advices, and hypocritical cant."</P>
<P>This wrought just as I would have had it. Then I desir∣ed him to view himself with my telescope, which he did, and thus exclaimed, "Why, I am a thousand times better than my brother Abel! I have as much righteousness in my one hand, as he hath in his whole person." Said I, "Now take a full view of your brother with this glass." He did, and as he looked, he said, "My brother is the most con∣temptible creature I ever beheld. I wonder not now to hear him complain of his unworthiness, as he does in his whining way." "Look again, I said." Then said Cain, "Why,
<PB N="124" REF="027249_0123_0FD3EC3DF96AA390"/>Abel is so swelled with pride, that he cannot contain him∣self." "Look farther," said I: "Aye, replied he, I see what he aims at. He thinks I shall be his servant, and no longer his superior as elder brother."</P>
<P>You know it is usual for my worthy friends, Envy, Re∣venge, and Cruelty, to follow me in most of my enterprizes. It so fell out, at this time, that those three diabolians were present, but none of them attempted to speak a word, till Cain had viewed his brother Abel with my instruments, in a light the most disadvantageous to him that could be. But Cain having obtained this view of Abel, up comes Envy and thus addrest him: "Friend Cain, I am heartily sorry for your disgrace, and am grieved when I observe to you, that it is my opinion you will never be able to endure your bro∣ther's greatness and prosperity, now he is accepted, and you are rejected. I am much mistaken, if his ambition ceaseth to operate, till he enslaves you entirely under his yoke. I much fear that is what he aims at Now, my friend, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you are the elder born, it is but reasonable, that you should be ruler; but for the elder to be subject to the younger, is what I would advise you never to submit to." Then said Revenge, if honest Cain will be ruled by me, he will make himself a∣mends for all the grief he has sustained. To whom Cain. "I pray thee, thou sweet spirit, which way shall I do it? Shall I burn his tents, destroy his flocks? what shall I do, to make myself amends?" Do, said Crudelis, what should you do? Knock him on the head at once: "Else, said Envy, he will be an eye-fore to you all the days of your life."</P>
<P>Thus the matter was determined, and accordingly Cain took an opportunity one day in the field to murder him. In this instance, Abel's virtue and faith were considered as vi∣cious craftiness; his sincere aiming at the glory of God, and his self-denial were by my inverting instruments interpreted pride and ambition. Deluded Cain revenged himself not according to reality, but according to his own jealous suspi∣cions, and groundless surmises.</P>

<P>True, sir, there is no possibility of maintaining strife and contention, but by inspiring one man with mistaken no∣tions of another, and each with a good opinion of himself. This is the spring of all contention.</P>
<P>I remember I made rude work between Jacob's wives; I think their names were Leab and Rachel, the daughters of your friend Laban, Avaro; and that too, for what neither one, nor the other could possibly help. Rachel was plump, fair and beautiful, but withal for many years barren. Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less beautiful, being afflicted with tender eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these two sources, I let the world see the inconvenien∣cy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> polygamy or bigamy. But to pass from the discord of the women. I come to their sons, amongst whom I made a pretty sort of an inroad, which for a season yielded me ex∣quisite pleasure.</P>
<P>You must know it is always more pleasure to me to stir up discord among the good and virtuous, than any people what∣ever, although by the way, it is much more irrational in them to quarrel with one another, than for those who are strangers to equal privileges. Yet such is my dexterity, that whilst they are in this world. I can make them very often behave to one another, more like enemies than friends and brethren. However, they escape my tyranny the mo∣ment they forsake their clay, and I am forever banished from their peaceful mansions in the other world.</P>
<P>To return to my story. Young Joseph, son of the deceased Rachel, was his father's favourite; and the fond patriarch, to evidence his distinguishing regard to him, clothed him in garments of many colours. This badge of affection sat very uneasy on the minds of his brethren, who, to a man, resolved to teach future parents the folly of partiality towards their children; yet had conduct enough to bridle their resentment,
<PB N="126" REF="027249_0125_0FD3ECBBB16D59D0"/>till a favourable opportunity should offer. It was not many years, before an opportunity offered; for Joseph had a dream, divinely inspired, of which! made very suitable improve∣ment. He dreamed, "that he and his brethren were all reaping together in the field, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o! ere he was aware, his sheaf stood upright in the midst, and all his brethrens sheaves, stood round and made obeisance to it."</P>
<P>Young Joseph, suspecting no harm, in his simplicity told his dream to his brethren. Not long after he dreamed, that the sun, moon, and eleven stars, made obeisance to him; and in the same simplicity of heart told his brethren this dream also, never once suspecting that they would comment upon it to his injury.</P>
<P>At this time, I happened to make a visit to them, and having the matter without reserve laid before me, I request∣ed them to examine it with my instruments, as you know I am never backward when there is any hope of business. As they examined it, they were unanimously of opinion, that the hanghty boy was but too sensible of his father's over-es∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eem for him. "Vain youth, said they, he can think of nothing, but being lord over his brethren: It is evident from his repeated dreams, his mind runs upon it through the day; for what people ruminate in the day, they are apt to dream of at night." Such was the sense my mirror gave of the af∣fair. Then said I, Gentlemen, be pleased to survey the mat∣ter with this telescope, meaning Prejudice. They did so, and said, "Did ever any body see such an haughty presump∣tuous youth, as this stripling of a brother of ours is? It may be the young ambitions wretch feigned his dreams, the more easily to introduce his supremacy! He be our lord! Most he? His pride is boundless. It is not enough, that he hopes to lord it over his brethren, but his old father must, it seems, make obeisance to his arrogance.</P>
<P>It was now I called on my brother Revenge to appear; to whom I willed them to make their case known. This they did, and he, without hesitation (as you know he is a rea∣dy
<PB N="127" REF="027249_0126_0FD3EC34821B2388"/>witted spirit) gave them his advice: "Gentlemen, said he, the fact is evident; but why do you perplex yourlelves? You have it in your power to prevent his aggra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zement; yonder he comes and here is a pit hard by, drown him in it, and see what will become of his dreams." "By all means, said Envy, for you see the old man is so doatingly foud of him, that he is ready to take his dreams to be divinely in∣spired; and the more foolishly the youth can dream the fonder his father is of him; so that it is now, if Joseph is well, he cares <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle what becomes of the rest of his children."</P>
<P>The son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jacob in part followed our advice; they cast Joseph into the pit, which happened to be dry: But the an∣gel of compassion wrought so far upon them, that they spar∣ed his life, sold him to a band of Ishmaelites, who were to take care to dispose of him in a foreign market, far enough from home. So you see it was by the help of my incompara∣ble instruments, Joseph was separated from his brethren.</P>

<P>Indeed! is it possible, that my lovely Impiator hath so far prevailed, as to make a reverend vicar drink till he is fuddled?

Let him preach repentance, and reformation, with all the zeal he may assume, every heare will say in his heart, "Physician, heal thy self." I always knew that you Avaro had large dealings with ma∣ny of the clergy, but not till now that my son Impiator, had obtained such great power over them. What! and swear too: To see a parson get drunk, or to hear him pre∣fanely swear, would give joy to the devil himself, amidst all his disappointments.

This you

What do you talk of three for, said he, only one of them can be its father. Indeed, sir, they are all three the fathers of my child, and are all willing to give security to the parish: and three very civil gentlemen they are, I assure you. I think, said the overseer, they have not behaved very civilly to you, seeing you are with child by them.

When I could not so universally prevail in this as I wished, I endeavoured to persuade each of them separately, that bowever Insidelis might reign over others, for their part, he had no dominion over them. For, said I, you have a good heart, and have believed well all your days. Although, as I said before, I have conducted many of those, who fancied they had believed so well in their life∣time, very safely down to the chambers of horrible despair, where they were very soon convinced, they had never be∣lieved at all aright.</P>
<P>Then I endeavoured to persuade the people, that the threatnings of God's law against sin, ought to be consi∣dered as a fancy, and, to strengthen this doctrine, I thus preached: (for you must know, I have been a great preach∣er in my time) "Look you, you timerous minded mortals; you may clearly see, that God hath created you, with all the passions and appetites that attend you, and can you be∣lieve that he did this, with a design to prohibit the gratifi∣cation of them? No, surely! Could it be consistent with the character of that God, whose goodness is unto all, and whose tender mercies are over all his works, to endow you with these passions and appetites, and then damn you for gratifying them? No, no, those threatuings are exhibited only to keep your consciences in awe; but never designed to be rigorously executed.—The law will make large allowances for the inclinations, passions, and infir∣mities of the human nature; never sear it. The soul that
<PB N="131" REF="027249_0130_0FD3EC69095B7E18"/>sinneth need not to fear dying as the scripture has threat∣ened; and man shall not be cursed, though he continue not in all things written in the law to do them,"</P>
<P>Here, gentlemea, you may see my falacy, in dealing with mortals, for although all the faculties and passions of the soul were indeed essential to its creation state, none of them were then irregular; none acted from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>proper in∣fluence, for every passion centred in its lawful and proper object Besides, all sinful motions and desires of the heart are the effects of my dominion over man.</P>
<P>Then I proceeded to persuade them, that God had forsak∣en the earth, and took now no notice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of men, so that every man might, with the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, gratify his peculiar inclination. By these means it was that the great Impiator was brought into existence, whose dominion has increased, every year, with great rapidity.</P>
<P>I persuaded men that this world is the most certain good. A bird in the hand, said I, is worth two in the bush. Make sure of this world, and never sear for the o∣ther. Do you consider this as your abiding place and build your nest in its highest branches if possible. In this I succeeded so well, that every man by nature, and almost all by practice, look upon the present world as the chiefest good. Then it was that Avaro was born in our family, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbitiosus was born in the family of astosus.</P>
<P>All this, you must observe, I did in disguise, or rather in a state of invisibility; I dare not tell a man, when I wait upon him, that my name is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfidelis; for although they are fond of my nature, even to distraction, there is not one of them but what hates to be told that he is cou∣cerned with me. Indeed, you cannot affront any of my sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts worse than by naming him after me, and calling him Infidel.</P>

<P>That is the very case with my subjects, for al∣though they love my service with all their hearts, they hate to be told of it. If a man should at any time reprove
<PB N="132" REF="027249_0131_0FD3EC39D0416080"/>one of them, for his enormities, you would soon hear him damn the reprover, for a methodist, or puritan, or a sancti∣fied hypocrite.</P>

<P>It is no manner of difficulty for me to lurk un∣perceived by them, in the corners of their dwellings: but I cannot possibly hide myself from Moses the vicegerent of the Highest. He is a person of a most piercing eye, and can trace all the motions of spirit, therefore it comes to pass that he and I, have frequent bickerings. Moses being the perfection of light, and I the most consummate dark∣ness, there is an eternal war proclaimed betwixt us, and we never meet but we are at daggers drawing.</P>
<P>Sometimes he comes knocking with a tremendous ham∣mer at the doors and windows of my lodging, as if he would lay the house in an heap of ruin, whilst the people within, start and tremble, at every thunder-clap of his ham∣mer. Amidst their consternation you may hear him from without, call to them within, with a voice louder than ma∣ny thunders, in the name of his august Master, to bring forth the devil Infidelis, and all his train, to public execution. But I am always well befriended by the people of the house, who, for the most part, tell him that neither Infidelis, nor any of his train, live with them, and that his excellency must needs have mistaken the door. They tell him, he would do better, to enquire at the house of Tom Drunkard, or Jack the swearer, where very probably, say they, that evil spirit may dwell.</P>
<P>This is often the beginning of a rupture betwixt him and them, for he is not to be so easily deceived; he shooteth his burning arrows, with deathly vengeance, in at the win∣dows against the people of the house, who I exhort, by all possible means, to resist to the last extremity. Never did you see the warlike Corsicans exert themselves with such ardour in defence of their liberties, as my subjects in defence of my government.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="027249_0132_0FD3EC6A9C8306C8"/>
Sometimes they so besmear his heavenly face, with the filth they throw upon him, calling him severe tyrant covetous ex∣tortioner, unjust villain, and the like, that he gives over the assault, and leaves them to my quiet possession; then I take my seal, and seal them to destruction; for you must know, it is but in some places he exerts his unfrustrable influence.</P>
<P>It is likewise observable, that, although my subjects will give Moses a good character, while he keeps at a distance from them, every one, will sight to the knees in blood, when assaulted by him, ere they submit; so fond are they of my person and government, Sometimes it hath happened, that, by irresistable force he hath broke open the doors, seized the people of the house by the collar, dragged them to the brink of a pit, called Despondency, into which he tumbled them headlong, and lest them shut up in that drea∣ry dungeon.</P>
<P>As soon as he is departed, I go to work, and turn some neighbouring brook into the pit, with a design to drown them, or throw down earth, stones, &amp;c. on purpose to smother them; and so I continue to pester, and disturb them, till I am frightened away by the sound of Immanuel's trumpet, as he himself approaches for their deliverance; for you must know, I cannot stand my ground, but take to my heels, when he appears. Many a time, do I hear my∣self cursed for an hellish brat, even by those, who but very lately, would have risked life and fortune, and with the greatest bravery fought, in the cause of prince Infidelis: but as soon as they obtain a glimpse of Immanuel's glory, they have done with my yoke, and I lose their affection for ever.</P>
<P>However, as I cannot endure that rational scripture light should shine in the hearts of men, I have often been puz∣zled to find out proper methods to resist the power of Moses, for he is excessively turbulent sometimes, and frighteneth my subjects into a pretended service of his
<PB N="134" REF="027249_0133_0FD3EC6C06D999E0"/>Lord. In order to appease him, the sons of men agreed to build a temple, and dedicate it to the Most High; ra∣ther choosing to worship him, than be destroyed by the ar∣tillery of Sinai. Accordingly to work they went, and built a sumptuous dome for divine worship, in order to stop the mouth of that never-ceasing accuser. Now, though I. things are likely to take an awkward turn with me; if this worship is not interrupted, I shall lose many of my present slaves. So I put my plodding brain to the torture, in order to find out proper methods of prevention; and I can tell you, gentlemen, I went wisely to work; you re∣member that, Avaro, for you were my helper.</P>
<P>The ease was this. We prepared the image of a woman, fair and beautiful to the eye; the was inwardly made of clay, and outwardly adorned with the appearance of burnish∣ed gold; in her right hand was a regal sceptre, titles of state, and plumes of honour, &amp;c. In her left she carried a heavy purse of money, and a cask of oriental jewels; upon her head was an imperial crown, studded with sparkling gems, which dazzled the eye of beholders, whilst they read the following motto, which was written, in all languages, on her forehead; "I am the mistress of the whole world." We secretly conveyed this image into one corner of the tem∣ple, and placed it in such a manner as to be seen of all who entered.</P>
<P>I soon perceived that the bait was suitably drest, and our idol had charms enough to attract the attention of the people. Ha — ha — ha, you would have laughed, till your sides were tired, had you been there, to see how the slaves looked asquint upon the idol, as they approached the altar of God. Aye, and in the midst of their devotion, how they cast the tail of their eye towards the place where she stood. After their worship was over. O how they bowed and cringed, be before her ladyship; the very parson himself did her humble reverence and many times embraced her in the most affection∣ate
<PB N="135" REF="027249_0134_0FD3EC6F63E164F0"/>manner. Then said I, "A fig for Moses and all his threatening, I have the slaves as fast as ever."</P>

<P>No, no, he is none of your easy tempered people, I assure you: his eagle-eye soon discovered the cheat, and as soon did he resolve on vengeance, as appeared by the event. Laden with burning faggots he came to the temple, and roar∣ing like many thunders, he said, the flashes of lightning bursting as he spake, "This people draweth near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; put away from among you that accursed evil, and worship the Lord with your souls, as well as your bodies, with your hearts as well as your voices, or look for destruction even in the embraces of your idol."</P>
<P>This said, he hurled his brands amongst the people, and terribly disturbed many of them; indeed it was some∣thing alarming to see them so ghastly, and tremble at his fearful menaces. In their first alarm, they were for re∣moving the goddess out of the temple, for fear of immedi∣ate destruction; but being a little recovered from their fright, the far greater part found such relenting towards her ladyship, that they could not bear the thoughts of part∣ing with her, believing still, in despite of Moses, that her comely presence, was highly necessary, to render religion tolerable; and rather than part with her, they resolved to part with the temple of God itself.</P>
<P>Some few of them indeed, were resolute for her removal, deeming the urgent command of the heavenly accuser, not at all unreasonable, but their company was very inconsi∣derable, and their strength inadequate to the enterprize: when they attempted to remove her, they could not so much as move her feet off from the pedestal; and not∣withstanding the command was urgent, the far greater part of the people could not help, even in the midst of their devotion: looking towards the idol, with an approving
<PB N="136" REF="027249_0135_0FD3EC73D4266AB0"/>countenance, and there she stands to this day, adored by most, and a snare even to the virtuous and good.</P>

<P>Yes, Avaro, the times are not to be complained of; nor indeed have they been bad, for many hundred of years, if circumstances are duly attended to. But to my story. In process of time, men became sensible, that, unless the heart was fixed upon God, in acts of religious worship, their services could not be acceptable; but how to fix them they could not find. Being afraid, the result of their en∣quiries might prove dangerous to my interest, if not inter∣rupted. I advised them to make to themselves representa∣tions of God, in wood, stone, brass, or iron, but rather of silver, or gold; alledging that the more valuable the metal, the more acceptable the sacrifice would be.</P>
<P>The sons of men no sooner heard than approved of my scheme, and resolved forthwith to put it into execution. Then ere you were aware every village was furnished with one or two god-makers, a set of artificers, from whom our present saint-makers in Italy, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. are descended; for modern times have not changed, but only given a different name to this craft, by which the popish parsons get their wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="027249_0136_0FD3EC73D72EF3A8"/>
But, alas! having never seen the shape of God, at any time, they were obliged to form their images, in the mould of their own fancies, which being various, it came to pass, that in one place, the invisible Deity was likened to an old man, with a venerable long beard, grasping a bunch of reeds, which they called thunder. In another place he was repre∣sented as half man and half beast; yea, so curious were the fancies of the artists that in one place God Almighty was made like a fish, in another like an eagle or hawk, and in another like a log of wood, and indeed sometimes like a beast with four feet. So very briskly was this trade carried on, that all who were able to buy, had in a few years, one or more god-almighties, of man's making, in their own houses. The very same as our good friends the papists, have got almost every one, a saviour in his pocket or chamber. In the holy Roman church, you may find in every house, a Jesus Christ of one kind or another, for there, there be many sorts of Jesus Christs, as golden Je∣sus Christs, silver Jesus Christs, wooden and even paper Jesus Christs, all made with as much craft as the ancient pagan gods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That trade of shrine, making among the papists, is a good sort of trade, but I can tell you it falls far short of the craft of saint worshipping, by which the priests get their wealth. Many a wooden saint there is in the holy church, which hath brought into the priest's treasury above six times its weight in gold. And indeed the pagan priests reaped equal benefit from their gods, from whence we learn that priestcraft hath been the same in all ages.</P>

<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some people there were of more refined know∣ledge than their neighbours, who advised against the trade of god-making, saying. "We must not bow down to graven nor moiten images, nor in any wise worship them." My priests, according to my directions, answered as follows; "It is not the image which you worship, nor do you at all
<PB N="138" REF="027249_0137_0FD3EC750C8E4390"/>bow your knee to it; but being emblematical of the divine presence, it greatly assists you in your devotion." This learn∣ed reasoning calmed the consciences of most of the dissent∣ers; won them over to the religion by law established, and greatly wrought for the good of the church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sir, that is the very apology which the papists make for image-worship, relict-adoration, &amp;c. but indeed it is no wonder, seeing their religion is one and the same with that of the pagans.</P>

<P>Some few there were, rigid non-conformists, who insisted, that God must be worshipped in spirit and in truth; insisted that all idolatrous lumber should be cast out of the temple; by which the worthy clergymen of that age were so grievously galled, that they were forced, in a pious and tender manner, first to give up the heretics to the devil, and then put the flesh to death, for the salvation of the soul: in the very same manner (and for much the same cause) as the holy Roman fathers excommunicated and burned the pro∣testants. But the devil knows to his sad experience, that the church has not half the power the pretends to, for out of the vast numbers, which she hath generously given to him, it is but a very few he hath been able to receive: notwith∣standing both the pagan, papal, and other churches, have hereby shewn the good-will which all along they have borne to him and his interest.</P>
<P>Having fairly introduced idolatry, I tried, if possible, to lead men further off from their maker still; and for this end I brought in gods and goddesses, a numerous train; for in∣stance, if any man was more remarkable than others, for murdering his neighbours, or for giving large gifts to the church, i. e. the clergy, I got him deified as soon as he died, and had worship offered to him, in the same degree with faint-worship in the church of Rome; for saint worship and hero-worship differ only in name.</P>
<P>Indeed it is but doing justice to saints, in the Romish ca∣lendar, to observe, that the greatest part of them obtained
<PB N="139" REF="027249_0138_0FD3EC7685487E48"/>their faintships, for murdering of princes, massacreing pro∣testants, robbing their heirs, for the good of the church, or for raving mad enthusiasm. Well, I went on and prospered, till I had brought all the world, a few individuals excepted, to worship the works of the mason, carpenter, blacksmith, or founder. Encourage but any trade, and it is sure to pro∣sper: the god-making trade being universally encouraged, prospered exceedingly; for in a little time there were na∣tional gods, much the same with the seven champious of Christendom; provincial gods; county-gods; parish-gods; and even household gods, to the great emolument of the clergy. I think, gentlemen, you must all allow, that I have not spent my time in idleness among mankind.</P>

<P>I think it is something more than seventeen hun∣dred and sixty years agone that I had a trial of a very extra∣ordinary nature to grapple with, such as I never had before then, nor ever shall encounter while I breathe the sulphurous smoke of the pit. Oh, it was a sore trial, gentlemen. Im∣manuel, a very dear lover of men, having sat on the circle of heaven, for near four thousand years, with much relent∣ing of mind, and longings for human happiness, from thence beheld the dreadful havock I made in the world, rendering the whole posterity of Adam the children of wrath. Often did he call to the inhabitants of the earth, to take me up and burn me for a witch but they were too much my friends to regard his advice: and indeed had they regarded, it would have been an undertaking such as they could not execute without auxiliary strength. He sat long, and long, he won∣dered that there war no friend to help against so potent an adversary; when at last he saw, there was none to help, he
<PB N="140" REF="027249_0139_0FD3EC7811E6CF38"/>arose from his jasper seat and, in a transport of love, declar∣ed, that his own arm should bring salvation. According to the high determination, he dismantled himself of the robes of manifest glory, laid aside his imperial diadem, which irra∣diates all the crasts of light, posted down to this world, on the wings of compassion resolving to conquer by dying.</P>
<P>Alarmed at such an unprecedented enterprize, I dispatched our swift winged coutier with all possible speed to hell, to inform my great father, and the infernal divan, of the aston∣ishing event. As soon as Fame reported her story, the monarch summoned his poors to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him in the flaming council chamber, there to deliberate on the matter, and hav∣ing majur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly weighed every circumstance of it, it was re∣solved, to dispatch the devin Malevolus to Fastofus and me, with directions suitable to the occasion. That he, with Am∣bitiosus Persidia. Falax, and me, should take up our resi∣dence at Jerusalem, with the scribes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and doctors of the law. We immediately obeyed our instructions, and succeeded admirably in our embassy. At the same time Cru∣delis and Concupiscentia, were appointed pienipotentiaries to the tetrarchical court of Gallike, where they received infallible testimonies of Herod's esteem.</P>
<P>Against the time that Immanuel was to be revealed, He∣rod admitted but cousin Suspiciosus to frequent audiences, of which the devil Crudelis to his everlasting honour, greatly availed himself. He perfuaded the tetrach, that, for his own safety, it was highly necessary he should kill, destroy, and cause to perish, all the children in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, from two years old and under, in order that young Immanuel, who was formerly called, the ancient of days, might be involved in the general massacre. This was the opening of our evan∣gelic campaign since which time we have caused the shed∣ding of as much Christian blood, as if collected into one mass, would make a tide to deep as ever was seen at London Bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="027249_0140_0FD3EC30A2CD31E8"/>
At this time there appeared one John Baptist, a zealous Nazarene and harbinger to Immanuel; he was likely to do great injury to our interest, therefore it was thought best to have him destroyed, which by thy means, Discordans, we happily accomplished in part. Perhaps, Discordans, you can give a better account of that affair than I, as you were more deeply concerned in it.</P>

<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know that uncle; but I am ready to tell you what hand I had in it. You all know the man, and a trusty friend of ours he was, as any in his day. You know he most inordinately loved Herodias, his own brother Philip's wife, and by the direction of our friend Concupiscentia, he added incest to his adultery, by taking her to his bed. It was about this time, that this famous Baptist, the founder of the sect called by his name, began his public ministry, and, fearless of man, exclaimed against all manner of uncleanness, for he was faithful to his commission. Well, this same au∣stere Baptist took occasion one day in the following manner to reprove the tetrach for his lewdness; Herod, said he, the God who made thee, hath for his own glory exalted thee to the tetrachical dignity, but far from studying his ho∣nour, thou actest most unworthily, and turnest his goodness to thee into wantonness. Dost not thou know that the same God who made thee ruler in Gallilee, hath said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," put her therefore away from thee; if thou dost not, thou must expect that the Most High will mingle for thee the cup of his indignation."</P>
<P>I was then at the court of Gallilee, and did not fail to im∣prove the Baptist's admonition to the most fatal purposes; I transformed myself into the likeness of a grave courtier, a form very familiar to me; went up to the king, and held my inverting mirror before his eyes, bidding him to take a full view of the matter thus: as my humble servant, he did as I directed, and immediately said, "I perceive this field-preacher, this same Baptist, is an enemy to the Roman go∣vernment, and because I am a friend to Caesar he hath taken
<PB N="142" REF="027249_0141_0FD3EC798226B860"/>this advantage against me; doubtless to prejudise the minds of the people, either to the divesting me of the tetrarchical power, or to the subversion of Caesar's government.</P>
<P>When I had brought him thus to misconstrue the honest designs of the Baptist, I held my partial telescope to his eye, through which he looked with great attention, and as he looked, said, "What a presumptuous wretch is this, to take upon him to reprove me? Me, who am his lord and mas∣ter, and can soon destroy both him and his father's house. Must Herod be reproved by this despicable fellow with the rough garment? Is it now so low with Caesar's deputy, the tetrach of Galilee, that he must mildly bear the inso∣lence of every snarling peasant. No, it is inconsistent with our dignity, to let such daring boldness pass with impunity. If a courtier, or nobleman, clothed in soft raiment, had tak∣en a little liberty with me it might have been borne. But for this field preacher. This baptist, hah!"</P>
<P>By this time the great Revenge, that famous devil whose history is so tragical, thought it time for him to appear at court, and as soon as he judged it convenient, thus accost∣ed the offended king. "My lord the king, if your high∣ness suffer such insolence as this to go unpunished, your no∣bles will contemn you, every paltry priest will say, Yon∣der goes the incestuous Herod; aye, the very publicans and Herodians will alledge, that you are unworthy the dig∣nity you sustain, and all will censure your pusillanimity, in let∣ting such during insolence pass with impunity. Remember, my lord, that if wide-mouthed Fame should, as is very likely, report the matter in Caesar's ear, it is ten to one, but he will cashier you, either for your reputed incest, or your want of magnanimity. Sir, for your honor's sake, east John into prison." Herod was easily persuaded, and John was committed to jail.</P>
<P>On mature deliberation, however, he was afraid of put∣ting him to death, for he knew that the people had a good opinion of the renowned Baptist; therefore he lived in pri∣son,
<PB N="143" REF="027249_0142_0FD3EC2A82DE3508"/>notwithstanding Reven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> solicitations for his blood. On every occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with Herod, he thus accosted him. "W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Baptist dead yet? What! not yet, sir? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by sparing him so long, sir? I assure you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to die for his insolence. Sir, his crime is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> high treason against your person." Thus he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> laily.</P>
<P>It happened, at a certain time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> made a great festival in honor of his own name, which festival proved fatal to the innocent Baptist; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever since he had given offence, the devil Revenge had taken up his lodgings with Herodias the tetrarchess. She very well knew how foolish∣ly precipitate Herod is wont to be in his wine, and how much his eye was to be allured with a well-performed dance, especially it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a handsome young lady. Not at all doubting but Herodian her daughter would captivate the king, so far as to bring about the much desired death of John Baptist, she decked her in superb array, instructed her what to ask, if he should be pleased with her, then led her into the hall, where Herod and his nobles were carous∣ing. There she footed the hornpipe with such exactness, that the mistaken eye of the tetrach took her for a divinity, and swore that he would offer a great sacrifice to her, to the value of one half of his kingdom, if her highness would on∣ly deign to inform him what fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifices were most acceptable to her. She replied. "Human sacrifices are my delight. Give me then the Baptist's bead in a charger."</P>
<P>Now there began a horrid scuffle in the tetrarch's breast.

<P>In the midst of this scufile, in came Revenge, and thus addressed the king. "I assure you, sir, John deserves a thousand deaths, for his insolence to your highness." "Be∣files, said Fastosus, who was then at court, the great tet∣rarch

Accordingly, having obtained Herod's consent, (for we can do nothing against mankind but by their own consent,) he went and be∣headed Immanuel's harbinger.</P>
<P>Thus, gentlemen, you see, that by my famous instru∣ments, False-reasoning and Prejudice, I cause offence to be taken where there is none intended. John only fulfilled his divine mission, and sought the good of the tetrarch, by calling him to repentance; but my mirror interpreted his honesty into treachery and insolence; which clearly shows, that it changeth the appearance, quite contrary to the na∣ture of things.

<P>The cumbersome Baptist, thus dispatched, we united all our forces against Immanuel himself, who was, by the Jews, called Jesus of Nazareth. Many were the confer∣ences which we had with the Jewish rabbins, doctors, priests, scribes and pharisees, in which all our debates turned upon that object of our common hatred. The high priest, Fas∣tosus, Malevolus and me, were always placed at the head of the assembly, and every article was finally referred to us for decision. The venerable high priest addressing himself to me, asked what I thought concerning the pretensions of this Galisean? To whom! replied. "If it please your reverence, I think he is an arrand impostor, for his father yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know, his mother you know, his brethren and sisters, are they not all with you? But, continued I, when Messi∣ah shall come, no man can tell whence he cometh, nor whi∣ther he goeth."

<P>I well remember these things, and the learned oration, which at that time, I made in the Sauhedrim,
<PB N="145" REF="027249_0144_0FD3EC7E043ACF38"/>and now we are associated in such a friendly manner, I have a good mind to repeat it to you. You have it in the follow∣ing manner. "Hearken to me ye righteous teachers of the law; the virtuous governors of the Lord's inheritance, and I will unfold to you a just state of the matter. You all know that the expected Meniah, shall descend from a virgin princess of the lineage of David; but is this the son of a princess? Is his mother a virgin, being the wife of a carpenter?" Here you'll observe how I led them off from the truth, by attend∣ing to appearances rather than reality; for Mary the mo∣ther of Jesus, was actually a princess of the line of David, though obscure, and actually a virgin when he was con∣ceived, though after that the wife of a carpenter. Every circumstance attending his birth, corresponded exactly with ancient predictions recorded in the Bible; tho' by the way, it was by no means suited to the expectation of the Jews. But to my very great mortification I must con∣fess, that, although the great men of the earth rejected him, the Angels of heaven descended to hymn their new born Lord. The constellations of the firmament, shewed forth the birth of the Messiah. Eastern sages heard the proclama∣tion of the stars, and came to the city of Bethlehem, to offer oblations to the incarnate source of life.</P>
<P>So very clear indeed are the Old Testament prophecies, concerning this affair, that the generality of the Jews were, at that time in full expectation of the coming of Messi∣ah; therefore it required great address sufficiently to blind their eyes that they should not see, and know him when he came, to which purpose my speech was wonderfully adapt∣ed. "You know, and all the holy rabbins know, conti∣nued I, that Messiah shall come in power and great glory; shall break the iron yoke of Roman servitude from off your necks, and exalt the throne of David, his illustrious ances∣tor, high above the thrones of the kings of the earth, giv∣ing to his happy subjects dominion and great glory, subject∣ing
<PB N="146" REF="027249_0145_0FD3EC8203C170E8"/>to your government all those who wish your destruction. Worthy assembly, said I, you have chosen the great Fasto∣sus, as your president and director; hearken therefore to me, and I will shew you my opinion, concerning your ex∣pected Messiah, and his appearance among you. It is most probable, that when he comes, he will be born of illustri∣ous parents, in the family of David; and when grown ma∣ture in years, you may expect to see meet in him, a com∣bination of all great and good qualities. By his wisdom and prowess, he will rekindle the martial spirit of the Jewish warriors, leading the armies of Israel to glory and conquest, and his throne shall be exalted above all the kingdoms of the earth. You may therefore expect that when Messiah shall come to your deliverance, you shall see an illustrious prince, attended by a warlike retinue, breathing vengeance against your enemies. But can this be him? Could the Messiah, think you, find no body but poor shepherds, to be the pub∣lishers of his birth? More likely, if Jesus had indeed been the Messiah, he would have made choice of your reverences for his heralds. Can it ever be supposed my venerable rab∣bins, that an obscure person, attended by a few despicable fishermen, can have any legal pretensions to the vacant throne of illustrious David? Or can it ever be thought that the son of a Galilean carpenter, attended by a few of the riff-raff of the people, is likely to restore the kingdom to Israel?</P>
<P>Besides, continued I, let him be what he may, it would bring dishonor on the princes of Israel, should they submit to be governed by the son of a mechanie.</P>
<P>Who knows but the coming of Messiah may be yet more glorious, and ye shall see the heavens open over your heads, he shall appear in the firmament guarded on right and left, by innumerable battalions of armed seraphs, with whom he may descend and stand upon the mount of Olives, before he shall make his triumphant entry into the holy metropolis of Jewry. Then shall he dispatch his flaming soldiers,
<PB N="147" REF="027249_0146_0FD3EC8417B04520"/>with full commission to kill, destroy, and cause to perish all such stubborn Gentiles, who refuse to submit to the Jew∣ish empire, now become universal. Your enemies all de∣stroyed, great shall be your felicity and glory, for he shall reign among you in righteousness, peace, and glorious pros∣perity, unto all generations.</P>
<P>To whom, my worthy rabbins, will he come, but to such a generation of righteous men as yourselves. Ye your∣selves are witnesses of your own righteousness and devo∣tion. None say longer prayers, none give alms more pub∣licly than you do. So great is your zeal for religion, that ye rob widows houses for the good of the church. So pi∣ous your example, that my life for it, it will be imitated by the clergy in after ages. Your wicked ancestors fell very far short of your piety, for they killed the prophets, and stoned them who were sent unto them; but your re∣verences, so far abominate their murderous deeds, that you build and beautify their sepulchr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. You may safely conclude, that you are the righteous generation to whom the Messiah will come. Thus I swelled their expectations so very great, that, when the real Messiah was actually a∣mong them, they reviled him, as the worst of Impostors.</P>

<P>AS soon as the infernal gentry decamped, I went home, and found our parish-priest at my house; I thought this good opportunity of acquainting him with my adventure: but he concluded with the rest of my neighbours, that my brain was disturbed, and that those imaginary gentry were only the fruits of distraction. However, as I thought my∣self capable of judging between imagination and reality, I le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the parson to his mistake, went to my closet to correct what I had taken down in the former part of the day; got all ready by next day at noon, to listen to the sable gently.

<P>It happened that the venerable rabbins held another council, to assist at which the devils Fallax and Perfidiosus were invited. In this august assembly, the main thing to be considered was by what possible means, right or wrong, they might perfecute and destroy Jesus of Nazareth from the face of the earth. The great rabbins and doctors, by this time began to fear, that if some decisive step was not speedily ta∣ken, all the country would become Nazarenes▪ This in∣duced them to apply to those worthy spirits, (who are known to be excellent contrivers) and fervently solicited their Mist∣ance.
<PB N="149" REF="027249_0148_0FD3EC1C851DBCF8"/>And as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are by no means bashful, they very soon gave the high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>edrim satisfaction.</P>
<P>Venerable rab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, said they, we are apprehensive, that it will be very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ult to accomplish any thing against this Jesus of Nazar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> unless we can stir up enemies against him, among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his own houshold, and cause some, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his table, to lift up their heel against him; for you all know his conduct is perfectly unblameable. Now we have at no great distance a notable limb of the devil, trained up in all the mazes of deep deceit and treachery, sit∣ted for such perdition. Him will we persuade to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gratiate himself into the favour of Jesus, and to become one of his train<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, When this is done, he shall act the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raitor, and be∣tray him into your hands, nothing doubting but you will then take care to destroy his life, how innocent soever he may be."</P>
<P>"Certainly we will, rejoined the high priest, for it is expedient that one should die for the people." Accordingly the devil was dispatched to this son of treachery, whose name was Judas Iscariot, who, being a plodding coveto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s man, in hope of getting a bag of money, took his instruc∣tions from Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idiosus, went and joined himself to the train of Jesus, and obtained a part in the apostolic ministry. In the mean time we and the auxiliary Jews, did all in our power to prevent the advancement of his evangelic king∣dom, by bringing the person and ministry of Jesus into as much contempt as possible. We represented him as a glutton, a drunkard, a Samaritan, a wizzard; and in short every thing that was bad. His doctrine we represented as subver∣sive of the law; notwithstanding we knew him to be holy, harmless, and undefiled, separate from sinners; that he came to magnify the law, and make it honorable. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his works were such as carried their own evidence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, and which could by no means be contested, we persuaded many of the Jews, that they were performed by the power
<PB N="150" REF="027249_0149_0FD3EC8700D28688"/>of Belzebub. Others, who were better informed, being stirred up by the devil Malev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, out of pure malice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell in with the common cry, and defamed him as one who had in∣tercourse with Satan; and thus they sealed themselves ours; as we need never fear loosing a man after he is capable of such tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actions.</P>

At the same time my son Slavish Fear, who is a spirit of gi∣gantie stature, fell upon and routed all his followers, so that none of them remained with him in his last temptations. As soon as Immanuel was seized and fettered, they led him in triumph to prison and judgment, where our steady friends Hatred and Falshood, were appointed witnesses a∣gainst him in behalf of the commonwealth. So very hard did they swear against him, that he was brought in guilty of death, as had been agreed on beforehand.

<P>As soon as the sentence was denounced, the devil Male∣volus cried out, "Away with him—soldier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away with him—come, let us crucify him, his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by far too mild—away with the varlet to Calvary." So they led him away to crucifixion.</P>
<P>At the same time our infernal nobility were struck with amazement, at the seeming power which man had gained over Immanuel; and great Belzebub, in the midst of his astonishment, thus addrest his senators, "Once was the memorable time, that we made such an attempt, to subvert the government of God, by resisting the power of immanu∣el; but great was our defeat, and dismal our overthrow. Our designs were not only frustrated, but we ourselves in the height of our confusion, fiercely hurled from the resplen∣dent summit of primeval glory into the yawning g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lph of unfathomable perdition, where we are still reserved in these horrible chains, to the judgment of the great and terrible day—a day, the very thoughts of which make this noble fram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of mine to tremble as the quaking asp, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut how it
<PB N="152" REF="027249_0151_0FD3EC36627CC7F8"/>comes to pass I know not, these earth-born sons of ours seem exceedingly to surpass us in power: For I saw Im∣manuel stand fettered at their bar, dumb as a sheep before her shearers, he opened not his mouth. I am much afraid there is some hidden mystery in it. —What is this? —My undaunted mind is not wont to misgive me thus!— What can this unasua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tremor, which now a∣vades my heart, portend? I hate timidity—and yet I cannot help fearing, that this commotion of my intellects is ominous of some event fatal to our interest.</P>
<P>I cannot deem it possible that the God of heaven and earth would patiently submit to such indignities, had he not some ends to answer by it, to which we at present are stran∣gers. Often have I prophesied true; but O! may my prophetic mind be mistaken in its present timerous forebod∣ings. Mean while, let us, my infernal brethren, harden ourselves in despair; for it is now long since Hope took wing and fled from these dreary mansions. Strong in fury and fired with revenge, let us quit ourselves like devils and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vowed enemies of righteousness. As for me, I hold it good that instantly we fly to the assistance of our devoted friends the Jews. Having this unexpected opportunity, let as not said to improve it to the best advantage; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it not be owing to our negligence, if the state of Immanuel be not overturned. Let not us have the hell to reflect, that we omitted any thing which might tend to promote the interest of darkness.</P>
<P>Great Belzebub finishing here, and his motion being universally approved of, all the legions of reprobate angels, a few excepted who were left to look after the affairs of the damned, took wing for earth to assist at so very amazing an execution. Arrived at Calvary, they formed them∣selves into an invisible ring around the elevated cross, where, to their unspeakable astonishment and wonder, hung Im∣manuel the maker of the world; and you may be assured they did not fail, as far as it was in the power of fallen
<PB N="153" REF="027249_0152_0FD3EC1E0F9F5420"/>spirits, to torment his opressed soul. Ay, ay, so successful were we devils, priests, and soldiers that day, that no less was hoped for than a decisive victory over the Son of God.</P>

<P>A pertinent question indeed, considering by whom it is made, my son. But I assure you, we were never so greatly mistaken in our days as at that time. For when we thought ourselves sure of the victory, to our sad experience we learned, that Immanuel was strongest in death. For even when he was a dying, he laid us all under the most perfect arrest; none of us could take one step, either back∣ward or forward, but as he gave permission; so that being spoiled of all our power, we could not help ourselves, much less the afflicted prince. This done, he cried out with a voice which shook the very foundations of both earth and hell, "It is finished," and was then conveyed by Death into an invisible state.</P>
<P>This done, once more we thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he day our own; but here, I cannot omit that fearful stagmation of nature which happened then, and the set of new preachers which were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oduced. For when all under our influences, had for∣saken Immanuel, who was betrayed by one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ied by ano∣ther, and forsaken by all his preachers; the indignant sun
<PB N="154" REF="027249_0153_0FD3EC8A041E2360"/>could not endure that sight, as if angry and ashamed at the proceedings of the sons of men, covered his face with a sable cloud, and denied one smiling ray to delinquent earth, whilst his Lord was ignominiously crucified. As if it had been seized with uncommon tremor, the earth itself, fell into a fit of violent convulsions, the mountains reeled, the rocks rent, the graves opened, the dead arose, and all to preach the sufferings of the God of nature. An invisible hand rent the vail of the temple, that cloth of extraordinary texture, in twain from the top to the bottom, and a voice was heard to say, "The glory is departed from Israel, and now the most holy place is laid open."</P>
<P>Death having conveyed Immanuel to its lonely mansions, the resolute, though maimed Belz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bub, our great prince, re∣covered himself is much as was possible, his head being in∣curably broken; mustered his maimed forces, and went to the assistance of Death, if possible, to keep Immanuel fast prisoner in the silent tomb. Nothing doubting, but if this could be, we should render all that he had heretofore don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and suffered, null and void. The better to succeed in this important enterprize, we sealed the door of the sepulchre and set a watch of faithful soldiers, instructed by the chief of the Jewish priests; and still to make the security strong∣er, every fiend did his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmost to impose weights on the buried body of Immanuel, to prevent his resurrection from the solitary grave.</P>
<P>But to our eternal confusion, on the third day of his invi∣sible state, he arose shook himself from the dust, came to the door of the sepulchre, burst it open, and laid hold on Death, who stood as continel next to the door of the tomb, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rampled him under his feet, and by main force wrenched from him his poisonous sting, that sad repositary of all his strength. This done, he said, "Henceforth, monster, nast thou no power over the people for whom I have died." Then he broke impetuously through all the lines of martial inferuals, who stood in firm phalanx around the tomb;
<PB N="155" REF="027249_0154_0FD3EC8E4B7EE6D0"/>seized the lately wounded chief, who was very ill with a fever in his mind, arising from his disaster upon Mount Calvary. He took the fiend, the great Belzebub, chained him to the ax<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of his chariot, mounted his seat, and rode triumphantly through the gathering crouds of joyful saints, who on golden pinions descended from heaven in solemn strain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to hymn their all conquering and triumphant Re∣deemer.</P>
<P>O my friends! my dear infernals, it must have pierced your hearts with the most poignant sorrow, to see him drag∣ged in triumph through all the hosts of saints and angels, who fearless stood in blazing ranks to see the longed for so∣lemnity; and at the same time, to see our beloved friend Death lie gasping for life at the door of the sepulchre. Great was the confusion of the infernal brigades, when they saw their principalities spoiled, and Death and Satan so terribly handled: yea, so tremendous was their amaze∣ment, that to escape the avenging hand of risen Immanuel, they retreated even to the nethermost depths of hell, and his scattered disciples again resorted to his erected stand∣ard. But the greatest disappointment and consternation was, when we understood that after all our diligence and hazard∣ous exploits, we with our auxiliary priests, &amp;c, had done nothing, but what the hand and council of God had pre∣determined should be done; that by our seeming victory over Immanuel, he had for ever subdued us under his seet; and that all our hatred, envy and cruelty, was fully re∣compensed into our own bosoms; now deeper damned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han ever.</P>

<P>Ah, gentlemen, great was the cause of my dis∣may, for Immanuel gave such demonstration of his Messiah∣ship, that all which was written in the prophets concerning
<PB N="156" REF="027249_0155_0FD3EC8EDF7A70F0"/>him, was exactly fulfilled in his life and death: yea, so ve∣ry striking was the evidence, that many cried, <Q>Truly this is a just man,</Q> and others, <Q>Truly this is the Son of God.</Q> Therefore I greatly feared that all the world would become believers in him, and consequently shake off my yoke. But I was much obliged to my good friends the Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish clergymen; for their reverences greatly befriended me, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmly espoused my interest; exerted their ut∣most power to establish the throne of great Infidelis, and to destroy the early seeds of Christianity sown by Immanuel, and now beginning to grow.</P>
<P>Immanuel having in opposition to all the powers of darkness, finished the work for which he came down to the earth; he triumphantly ascended to his native heaven, to the primeval embraces of his eternal Father, and assumed all the ensigns of empyrean glory.</P>
<P>Soon after this the high festival of Pentecost drew on, and as I formerly attended at Jerusalem, in the midst of ma∣ny thousands, who, according to the law, came up to wor∣ship upon that occasion, not only from Indea, but from na∣tions very remote. I dreaded no harm at the hands of a few ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terate fishermen, having not been informed that any of the rulers, or of the scribes and phariseas, had believed in Jesus, and therefure was at no pains to prevent the multi∣tude coming up to the solemnity as usual. But here was another shock my kingdom sustained; for Peter the fisher∣man, who, so very lately like a dastard, impiously deni∣ed his Lord with profane oaths, now filled with the Holy Ghost, stood up in the midst and clearly proved that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esus was the very Messiah, and upon this occasion played off the heavy artillery of Sinia on the consciences of my people, which was attended with success so fatal to me, that no less than three thousand were pierced through the heart at once, and fell on the field of action. Now it was that my evil apprehensions were again alarmed, plainly perceiving that the artillery of the word was levelled against my person,
<PB N="157" REF="027249_0156_0FD3EC90D040FAF0"/>and that the first end of the gospel was the subversion of my diabolical government. However, I drew up all the forces which I possibly could, in the hurry of that surprize, and had just time to give one general discharge, my soldiers cry∣ing out as they gave the volley, "These men are drunken with new wine." It was but a poor opposition to doctrine so powerful, I allow, but it was the best that could at that time be made, for we were obliged to retreat in much con∣fusion, and leave the Christian fishermen masters of the field.</P>
<P>As soon as we were a little recovered from the disorder into which that unexpected misfortune had plunged us, I summoned a council of war, in which the self-righteous Jews were the principal, next to our infernal train. I myself gave special orders, that some method should be concerted effec∣tually to destroy the name of Jesus; for, said I, "If we let them alone all the people will believe in their doctrine." In this council it was resolved, to raise an army of those who were the greatest adversaries to the name of Jesus, to whom orders should be given to kill, destroy, and cause to perish all who believed in this way, till the Christian religion should be banished from the face of the earth. This army was raised, and the command given to Saul of Tarsus, at that time a mighty zealot for us, and who, for a season, made dreadful havoc of all that believed contrary to the faith of the priests; for it ought to be observed, that the opinion of the priests, has been esteemed true orthodoxy, and the only faith, in all ages or countries.</P>
<P>But here another sad disappointment and loss besel me, for as this same captain Saul was on his march to Damas∣cus, to fight a pitched battle with the Christians, it so fell out that Immanuel himself was taking a tour in the valley, to see how the pomegranates budded, and falling in with trusty Saul on his journey, unveiled his own personal excellencies to aim, and laid him under an immediate arrest. As soon as
<PB N="158" REF="027249_0157_0FD3EC9282FCCD10"/>he saw the beauties of Immanuel, he felt the most sincere es∣teem for his person, and conceived the most exalted senti∣ments of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> friendship and love. Yea, he was even so much grieved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had drawn his sword against him, that he renounce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervice of Infidelis on the spot took the oath of allegiance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus, and thenceforward hated my per∣son and government with the most perfect hatred; old what he could to overturn our state and subvert our government.</P>
<P>Immanuel having the most tender regard for Saul, gave him a new name, written upon a white stone, appointed him one of his prime ministers, and sent him on an embassy to my subjects, to negociate a revolt from me.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive the astonishment the Jewish clergy were in, when swift-winged Fame arrived and blowed it abroad in every street, that Saul, who was formerly so zealous for our interest, was now become a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes, and was likely to do us more mischief than all who had gone before him.</P>
<P>By this time several of the Jewish rabbins, rebelled a∣gainst me, and joined themselves to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who now made it their whole business to go from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> place, exhorting my subjects to revolt, exposing my deformity and devilishness, to all they met with. O! those were trying times, for, notwithstanding we had forces out against them, in every quarter of the world, to impede their progress, the word of God, by their means, prevailed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> manner, that it was beyond our power to suppress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for if we burned one Nazarene, two more presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up out of his ashes. Even Rome itself, then the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the world and seat of pagan virtue; Athens, where Minerva was said to have been trained up, were soon infested with this new doctrine, and very considerable numbers in them durst oppose our government and dispute our title to empire. Even alledged that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, and that all pagan virtue is but dross and dung in comparison of the gospel of Christ Jesus.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="027249_0158_0FD3CD9B67C40208"/>
However, to out my story as short as may be; after many hundred thousands of the Nazarenes were slain, my subjects became weary of the war. By this time they saw clearly that persecuting them to death only served to in∣crease their number and strength: So that if those restless devils, Malevolus and Crudelis, would have been quiet, they would gladly have dropped their weapons, and agreed to a cessation of hostilities with the Christians.</P>

<P>Little judgment as I am allowed to have of histori∣cal affairs, I myself have seen what effect opposition usually hath upon that class of people, for if in any place where my standard is most eminently elevated, there happen to be any of that sect, you shall find them more fervent in their study of virtue, and zealous in their opposition to me, than in those provinces where morality or civility preside. Ah, gentle∣men, we have had trying times past over us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trying times indeed. For, notwithstanding the fervent zeal of Malevolus and Crudelis, the many fore cam∣paigns they had served so enervated their arms, that, al∣though their principles remained implacable, they were even obliged to sit down in despair of ever being able to ex∣tirpate the religion of Jesus from the world.</P>
<P>But my fertile brain soon produced fresh devices; seeing many of my temples forsaken, and my idols without mercy thrown to the pavement, I began to think of other expedi∣ents to impede the progress of Christianity. I laboured to introduce Ease, and her handmaid Prosperity among the Christians, not without hope, that when they were full they would forget their God. The better to favor this deep contrivance, I persuaded the valiant Crudelis to scabbard his sword for a season, and leave the people of our hate to the possession of their tranquility.</P>
<P>It was not long that this scheme had been put in practice, ere I began to reap the fruits of my wisdom; for ease and prosperity wrought more to my advantage, than all the ex∣cursions of the devil Crudelis. When they were at ease
<PB N="160" REF="027249_0159_0FD3EC93C55BBFF8"/>from the lash of persecation, they were foolish enough to quarrel among themselves, grievously bit, and devoured one another, the cause of their strife for the most part being, who should be the greatest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very important question, much canvassed, but never as yet resolved. Had I been a clergyman instead of a devil, I had certainly been a great casuist in this part of school theology. Never was a point of doctrine more be∣laboured certainly than this, and never were people more divided in sentiments than about its resolution, even from the great church of Turkey down to the smallest dissenting congregation. The divines of the established church in Turkey stands stifly to it, that Mahomed and themselves ought to preside over all the believing world. The doctors of France, Spain, and Italy, are as firmly persuaded that pre-eminence is due to none but his holiness and themselves; and that all who are not of the same opinion, are certainly in a state of damnation.</P>
<P>As for their reverences in England, though they will de∣ny no honour to his popeship, which really is his due, they will submit to none as the leading priest but his Grace of Canterbury, and consider that church which they are the pillars of, as the purest establishment that the lower world can boast of. Others indeed there are who greatly question his Grace's right to preside, and therefore refuse to bow to his mitre, and will have a pope of their own choosing, re∣solving to be enslaved in their own way. Hence, although the reverend members of the associate synod cannot in con∣science submit to the corrupt governors of the kirk of Scot∣land, all of whom they have long since recommended to the care of the devil, much less can they bow to a metropolitan, whom they call the image of the pope, they can very cordi∣ally submit to the government of the reverend Mr. Adam Gibb; because they themselves had the pleasure of choosing him. That goes a great way. And hence it is, every soci∣ety has its po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.—The venerable — of—at —

But remember this, whoever is chosen the pope of a party, is by his partizans always deem∣ed the greatest. For instance, at the Foundry none is so great as the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, sometime fellow of Lincoln college, Oxon. And at the — none ever preached or wrote like the great — D. D. author of — and of — and of — &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But amongst them all, a very few are found who consider Jesus Christ as the greatest, and who properly call him, Master.</P>

<P>I thought Immanuel had settled that point long ago. Did not he establish this rule for the observance of his disciples, <Q>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant?</Q> did not the di∣vines abide by his determination?</P>

<P>No, Avaro, Quite the reverse; for the school∣men will have it, that he who is chief shall be lord over his brethren: by these means they have annexed a certain degree of nobility to their religion, which Jesus never in∣tended to be joined with his.

<P>Those female fiends, the ladies Prosperity and Ease, as plenipotentiaries for Belzebub, made great propo∣sals to them, and indeed they soon established kingdoms, principalities and powers, of the Christian name.</P>
<P>Then were the Christians able to maintain themselves against their Pagan neighbours, my profest subjects. This I patiently bore, believing that the martial spirit of the Christians, a little indulged for the present, would greatly make for our interest and the final establishment of my kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="027249_0161_0FD3EC27C320C800"/>
Those revered-ladies, Prosperity and Ease, had not been long amongst them, ere many who bore the Christian name were desirous of coming to terms of agreement with me; but upon this express condition, "That in the treaty of amity betwixt them and me, it should be stipulated, that they still be called by the name of Christ, for it was now become scandalous to bear the name of another." This request I thought reasonable enough, and that to grant it would be no very great concession on my part, therefore I readily agreed, and the treaty was confirmed. It is an invariable rule with me, that it is not very material whether a man is called a Christian or not, provided I have but safe possession of his heart: for names do not change the nature of things.</P>
<P>This amiable fiend, lady Prosperity, rested not in her pleasing operations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till she had quite reduced the oriental nations to such a degree of reason, that they petitioned my personal return among them, and as my loving subjects re∣turned to their allegiance. Having now secured the orient∣al, the splendid lady and me, undertook the conquest of the occidental church; and, the better to succeed in our en∣terpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, we fixed our abode at Rome, famous both for an∣cient and modern paganism. As for me, I knew it was necessary I should remain incognito, till a fair opportunity should offer for my emerging out of darkness: but my lady Prosperity decked herself in her richest attire, and openly resided among the Christians, who were so ravished with her excellent beauties, that he was deemed the most happy man who could prevail with her excellency to take up her lodging in his house. Her ladyship, you know, is not to be won by every one who addresses her; here she acted ac∣cording to previous instructions, and made free with the bishop's house, as best suited to our purpose.</P>
<P>Wonderful were the works which she performed there: for at her first arrival the bishop was no more than a plain honest man, having but one congregation in his diocese; but first the created him, Reverend; then, His Lordship; then,
<PB N="163" REF="027249_0162_0FD3EC9718C556D0"/>His Grace; and after that, His Holiuess, &amp;c. Indeed the vast dominion and immense revenues which she conferred on him, so swelled the haughty prelate, that, not contented with the honours then possest, he claimed dominion over all, as the father of the whole world, Even this was short of giv∣ing content, unless he should also reign over heaven and hell; therefore he hath seized the gates of both, and lets in and out just whom he pleases. Nothing sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of arrogating to himself the prerogatives of the Almighty, could satisfy his ambition, such as his holiness, infallibility, supremacy, &amp;c. The devil himself never aimed at higher things. In the mean while her ladyship, at her leisure hours, waited on those who were of any account among the Christians, who for the most part had nothing of Christianity but the name. Some indeed were firmly attached to Immanuel, who could not be bribed even by her largest offers; but their number was com∣paratively small. Seeing the progress which Prosperity made, they went about the streets complaining in some such words as these: "This harlot Prosperity will be the ruin of Christianity."</P>
<P>In process of time I was sent for to the bishop's court, he being entirely reconciled to me. The worthy prelate receiv∣ed me with all the reverence due to my person, and laid before me a beloved scheme which he had designed, and of which he desired my opinion.</P>
<P>Having maturely digested his plan, I replied. "Worthy and self-adoring sir, has your holiness power sufficient to de∣fend your deityship, providing your divinity should be called in question?" To which his holiness. "Yes, yes, yes, I have—I have—There are several potent princes, who will conspire to make me omnipotent. They will spend their substance—depopulate their dominions—destroy their bodies, damn their own souls, and the souls of their subjects, in de∣fence of my godhead.—There are many wise priests also, who will contribute all these wisdom, for their own emolument, to make me omniscient o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> infallible." Having
<PB N="164" REF="027249_0163_0FD3EC9900EEA5C0"/>such an agreeable account of his holiness's affairs, I resolved all his scruples at once; for thus I addrest him, "Most subt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of all the priests, if thus you are supported, I think all things go very favourably. Therefore lose no time in publishing to the world your excellent scheme of divinity. Let it be proclaimed that lienceforth you are no longer man."</P>

<P>His holiness was in the right of it to disclaim hu∣manity. What mortal man was ever endowed with such qua∣lities as are his? What mere man was ever infallible? Not Peter, he fell low enough. Infallibility is an essential attri∣bute of Godhead, and his holiness being possest of that, must needs be God What man ever did, or ever will reign with despotic power over all the priests and princess of the earth, putting down one and exalting another at his pleasure, like his holiness. It is by him that kings reign, and princes de∣cree judgment, and not by the Almighty, as formerly. Therefore his holiness can be no mortal man.

<SPEAKER>CRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday afternoon I was conjured up by Squire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roadfield, to assist in the whipping of a poor man, who be∣ing ready to perish with hunger, unluckily begged a morsel of bread at his door. But before I give you an account of the whipping, I shall first give your a specimen of the gen∣tleman's character.</P>
<P>Squire Broadfield is a gentleman and justice of peace. He is worth five thousand a year, and that is enough to make him a gentleman, even if his father had been a beggar; to make him wise, though born a fool; learned, although a very dunce. Indeed, it must be owned, the principal part of his worship's education was had under Dr. Ringwood and Dr. Jowler, the celebrated tutors of his kennel. Their maxims he perfectly understands, and their virtues he has dopted; but five thousand a year you know, makes the study of the kennel truly classical.</P>
<P>Talk you of Orpheus to him, his worship proposes the vir∣tue of Ringwood to your consideration. Do you admire the
<PB N="170" REF="027249_0168_0FD3CDA8EEFF6710"/>ardour which flames in the Iliads; his worship says, no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sic like the voice of Jowler. Tell him of the majesty of Virgil, he'll bid you mind well the gait of his horse, what a majestic creature he is. An emperor, says he, might be proud to ride such another. Do you recommend the plea∣sures of solid learning to him, he is in raptures about the diver∣sions of the chace. As yet he hath avoided the yoke of ma∣trimony; not that ever he was an admirer of continence, few gentlemen being more conversant with the fair sex than his worship.</P>
<P>He keeps in his house a wanton train of overfed servants, the superfluities of whose table would comfort the bowels of many indigent: besides a pack of hounds, which devour more than serves to maintain all the poor in the parish work∣house. But this miserable wretch who cannot work because he is lame, and having no parish to flee to for relief, chooseth to beg rather than steal, for which his worship ordered him to be severely whipt by my good son the beedle, till be shall be made willing either to steal for a living or to die of hunger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not certain that John Ketch, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of fatal character, had any hand in procuring the law for whipping beggars; but certainly it adds greatly to his revenue. Nor am I certain that it was made on purpose to drive vagrants from begging to stealing, in order more speedily to ease the nation of such a burden; but certain I am, it greatly helps to fill up the Tyburn chronicle. But what more, cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the poor lame fellow was confronted by the beedle, and was convinced of the reality of his worship's be∣nevolent intention to have him well flogged; he fell on his knees, and implored mercy for God's sake, and for Christ's sake, &amp;c. promising that, if he might be forgiven this once, he would never return to these parts any more. He plead∣ed his indigence, his hungry belly, his lameness, his belong∣ing to no parish, and every thing his fear could devise; but all served only to harden the justice's heart the more. He ordered the beedle to take him away, and do his duty imme∣diately.
<PB N="171" REF="027249_0169_0FD3EC384E709C08"/>The beedle signified to him as they drew near to the whipping-post, that he felt some relentings of heart to∣wards him; and that if he could only give him an handsome fee, he would favour him as much as his reputation would ad∣mit of. But, upon enquiry, finding that the old fellow was so wicked as to have no money, his heart became like brass, and he resolved to ply him throughly to the satisfaction of his worship.</P>
<P>Accordingly when 'Squire Broadfield and me arrived in company to see the sport, there was the poor raseal, whose poverty was his principal crime, tied to the post, and mangled with the cord, which the lusty beedle plied with nervous arm.</P>
<P>Oh! how his worship and me did laugh, to see the vil∣lain, whose poverty was obstinate, leaping, as his lameness would let him, and wrything his bloody back, as the whip was lustily pryed about him by the sturdy beedle; who, for his part, would rob, and steal, and do any thing, rather than be whipped by a trusty brother of the trade; yea, would act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en thousand villainies rather than die of hunger. This fellow must be a most incorrigible rogue to be sure, if he is not willing by this time either to steal and be hanged, or patiently to die of an empty belly.</P>

<P>What, Crudelis, have they made a law to whip all the beggars that infest your country?</P>

<P>No, no, Impiator. I heartily wish there were such a law, for then I would even quit my devilship to be∣come king of the beedles. If all beggars were to be punish∣ed at the whipping-post, (as I know no reason why they should not) perhaps his worship himself, and his reverence the parson of the parish, would not escape a thorough drub∣bing. And yet, Crudelis, as my name is, I think the whip-beggar-law is very partial and unjust, as it lays hold on none but poor petty beggars, who would be content with bread, shins of beef, and table beer; whilst others may with impunity beg, and obtain some thousands a year of the nation's money.</P>

Does not his reverence, the inferior clergyman, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g a living from my lord bishop, or some neighbouring no∣bleman? And do not their lordships beg of the king? Do not the very members of parliament come hat in hand, and meanly beg of the corporation, having no consciousness of worth in themselves? Do not the pliant courtiers sue to the favorite for places of trust for the sake of the profit? Beggars all, besides the stern patriot, a pelican which does not appear once in a century. But if their lordships, the noble beggars, and their honours, the gentlemen beggars, are to be considered as authors of the whipping-law, I should have wondered indeed, if care had not been taken to exempt themselves from its penalty.</P>
<P>The case stands exactly thus. If a gentleman, extrava∣gant beyond his revenue, begs for a thousand or two per annum, he shall not only escape with impanity, but obtain his suit, provided always, he will be the humble pliant crea∣ture of the minister; but if a poor helpless, low-born wretch, pinched with hunger, happen to beg a piece of bread in an interdicted place, he shall be exercised a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the whipping-post.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding I prevailed with the Jews, almost una∣nimously to contemn the person and testimony of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christian religion gained ground in the world. Yea, the word of God grew mightily, and prevailed over
<PB N="173" REF="027249_0171_0FD3EC210CB58A40"/>the traditions of both Pagan and with sages; therefore, from thenceforward I found it necessary to deal deep in the things of religion.</P>
<P>I began my trade with ecclesiastical titles, which were altogether unknown in the days of Christ and his apostles; a set of goods very venerable with the populace, and whol∣ly of my manufacture. An assortment of trifles, which greatly pleased the lords of religion, and forwarded the deep designs of priest-craft.</P>

<P>With your leave, sir, I have heard that all the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd bishops are descended in a direct line from the apostles; must it not then follow, that the convocation at Jerusalem consisted of the most reverend fathers in God; their graces, my lord Peter, my lord Paul, &amp;c. &amp;c. metropolitans; and the right reverend fathers in God, my lord Stephen, my lord Philip, my lord Timothy, my lord Barnabas, &amp;c. di∣ocesians.</P>

<P>My nephew shall hear, if he will but have a lit∣tle patience. The famous lady Prosperity and you, bro∣ther, had not been a very great while at Rome, before I found sufficient encouragement to erect my office for vending sacerdotal titles there; and I must own that for many years I had a brisk run of trade, till in fact the church had room for no more, from the great infallible priest at Rome, down to a Cumberland curate. The first introduction of this kind was a very brilliant medal, inscribed with these five capital letters; P. A. T. E. R. which having finished, I present∣ed at a general convocation of bishops, who as yet were not become reverend. They were highly pleased with the de∣vice, having never seen such a thing before. The worthies examined it one after another, and all found that the ven∣erable letters, well put together, and properly interpreted,
<PB N="174" REF="027249_0172_0FD3ECA2301C21B0"/>signified Father. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtainly the event has proved, that great is the magical power of this medal.</P>
<P>Every one said to his fellow: <Q>What can be more agree∣able to our function than this venerable title? Are not we the fathers of the people?</Q> They forgot that One is he Father of the people, even God. I was therefore des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, with all speed, to procure a like medal for every member of this august assembly. Soon after this, I provided medals more highly finished, and inscribed; P, A, T, R, I, A, R, C, H, A, one of which I bestowed on the holy bishop of Rome; a second I gave to the bishop of Alexandria; a third to that of Constantinople; a fourth to that of Jerusa∣lem, and a fifth to him who presided in the church of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tioch. In all which places my medals were more highly valued than the finest ruby; and he who could by any means obtain one of them, was supposed to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>levated f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r above the common rank of mortals.</P>
<P>Long and very successfully had I followed this medalian trade, when a famous and worthy pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Rome, who was a great admirer of my productions, came into my of∣fice; after doing obeisance to me, and turning over my pretty devices, he asked me, "If I thought, with all my ingenuity, I could produce a genuine medal with this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣scription, P, A, P, A, S,: S, U, P, R, E, M, U, S.</P>
<P>OR,</P>
<P>EPISCOPUS UNIVERSALIS." I told him, that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the artists in hell were to unite their wisdom in one mechanical head, it would be utterly impossible; for, said I, the whole creation doth not furnish sufficient materials. But if it please your holiness, I can make you a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am medal of that sort, which may perhaps answer all the ends you have in view, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as if it were real. Oh! said he. I care not for my part whether it is real or counter∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, if I can only, by your assistance, my worthy Fastosus, impose upon the credulity of mankind; and make the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rld
<PB N="175" REF="027249_0173_0FD3ECA3E1864E50"/>believe that I am supreme pope and universal bishop; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n I should reign, with despotic power, over the estates and consciences of all Christians. My good friend, please you to make me the medal, and I will cause the world believe that I had it from the Almighty, with letters patent under the broad seal of heaven, for the sole use of it to me and my successors for ever. "I well know, returned I, that your holiness means no more, than in a pious manner to impose the cheat upon the world, the better to fill your coffers, and aggrandize your name; in which laudible undertaking, your adored Fastosus shall be ever ready to direct and assist."</P>
<P>To work I went, having called in the assistance of several of our friends, and made a counterfeit medal, in the like∣ness of a treble crown, with certain inscriptions of the cab∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>listic kind upon it. They were short but pithy sentences, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s you shall hear. On the one side of the first crown was inscribed,</P>
<P>He that is honoured as the weater of this medal, is pos∣sest of infallible knowledge.—Opposite to that was carv∣ed, in fine Italian, He is supreme over all laws, divine and human.—On the right side of the second crown, were these words in large capitals, This is the head of the church. —On the left were these, This is the viear of Christ, and successor of Peter.—On the third and uppermost crown were the following. The keys of heaven, hell, and purgatory, are in his possession, and used only at his plea∣sure. Round the edge, was this writing. He reigneth su∣preme over all the kings of the earth, put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth down one, and exalteth another at his pleasure.</P>
<P>When finished, I presented it to the arch-prelate, who received it with all imaginable thankfulness, viewed it with the most exquisite delight, and oftener than once, protested by his infallibility that he had never seen any thing contrived with equal art, nor so suitably adapted to his aspiring principles. Transported with joy, he cried out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou ingenious spirit? bloss thee for thy assistance?
<PB N="176" REF="027249_0174_0FD3ECA578E23D98"/>This precious medal will exalt my name above all that is called God; all the European princes will now become my vassals, and the adorers of my priestly majesty. But to complete the work, I pray thee, good Fastosus, think of some suitable device for me, by which I may bind all the va∣rious ranks of the clergy to my interest; for I shall never dare to show my miraculous medal, nor divulge the delight∣ful inscriptions on it, unless I have something of the like nature to present to their reverences; for this alone will ex∣cite them to favor the cheat. As for laymen, the scum of nature, I regard not them. They are asses, upon whom we shall ride with pleasure and profit; and if at any time they ride restif, we will tame them with the rod of disci∣pline, and so belabour them with the cudgel of excommu∣nication, that with gladness they shall submit implicitly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our decisions. Could not the great Fastosus strike me a variety of medals, of different worth and designs; and lodge them safely in my possession, that I may have the sole distribution of them amongst my depending clergy; for unless they cleave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s close to me, as the scales to the back of Leviathan, I shall never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> able to support my pretensions to infallibi∣lity and supremacy.</P>
<P>To which I replied, "Great priest, in order to bind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lergy inviolably to your interest, let me advise you to take care that your decisions be always in their favor; place your own grandeur in the front of all your proceedings, and let theirs immediately follow it;" which advice the good man cordially embraced, and ever since has invaria∣bly followed it with the utmost precision,</P>
<P>From henceforth, continued I, I give you full power and authority to preside over all those medals which I have already issued forth; and for the future the disposal of them shall be at your holiness's pleasure. I will moreover add to the number, and you shall have more than sufficient to gain all the clergy to your party. But observe, you must receive this power at the hand of great Fastosus, for it is by
<PB N="177" REF="027249_0175_0FD3ECA68E7F2A98"/>me alone you can lord it over the estates and consciences of men. The great prelate heard with attention, and then rejoined, "Mighty Fastosus, if you will oblige me in this, you may depend upon me and all my successors as faithful subjects; implicitly obedient servants to your highness, and your father Belzebub. Nor do I doubt but the rest of the priests, for the sake of power, will be equally loyal to you, and implacable enemies to Immanuel, therefore, your kindnesses shall be gratefully returned on our parts."</P>
<P><Q>Very well, said I, but be sure that all your villainy be carried on under the shew of sanctity, otherwise you will do us but little service,</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then sir, by what you say, it may be conclud∣ed, the hoary prelate at Rome is very sensible that he is Belzebub's agent, and that all his pretensions, beyond those of the lowest pastor, are an imposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Avaro, he knows it very well, and that makes him more like unto us: indeed the cheat is so palpable, that any one who has read his Bible with attention must needs see through it. But by these proceedings, I soon found I had cut out a great deal of work for myself, so that I was o∣bliged to be doubly diligent. However, my sole delight be∣ing to promote the works of darkness, I soon str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck off seven∣ty new medals, inscribed CARDINALIS. These I presented to his holiness, who examined them with great attention, and was highly pleased with the inge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious device.</P>
<P>"Most noble spirit, said he to me, these medals I perceive, will raise the gentlemen who receive them next in dignity to myself, and they will be the first and most able to support the see of Rome." You must needs know, my friends, that this prediction has been fully accomplished. For, in all ages, since the cardinals received their medals they have been tru∣ly indefatigable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> establishing the power and supremacy of the pope. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> holiness and they being so intimately con∣nected, that they must stand or fall together.</P>
<P>In the next place, I struck off a considerable number some∣what
<PB N="178" REF="027249_0176_0FD3ECA92760DF20"/>what inferior to the former, distinguished by a Mitre on one side, and on the other by the inscription ARCHIEPISCOPUS; which, in like manner, I presented to the father of the world, much to his satisfaction. These, said he, shall fix the class next to the former, and I doubt not but every one of them will be sufficiently obsequious in expectation of a cardinal's hat. The archbishops being thus disposed of, I took all the diocesian meda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which I had formerly produced, and put them under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re and disposal of the great prelate; and he was pleased to assign them to those, who were next in place to the archbishops, each one in humble expectation of higher preferment.</P>

<P>Hah, uncle! was it you that made those titles ascribed to the various orders of the clergy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it I, do you ask? Yes, it was I indeed! Who ever read in the New Testament, any thing at all about a supreme bishop, or about cardinals, and lord bishops? I made them all, I assure you, cousin; though I will not affirm, that every person who has borne these names, has been ab∣solately under the dominion of pride.</P>
<P>To my great honour I speak it, Avaro, I ceased not when I had made their lordships the diocesians, but went on with my trade, till I had procured curious medals for a very great number of abbots, swarms of monks and friars; jesuits, franciscan and dominican friars, with a long train of etceteras, who soon appeared in shoals, as numerous as locusts when they ascend out of the bottomless pit. Then followed the bare headed capuchins, mendicants, penit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, pilgrims, &amp;c. without number. Those religious gentry o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all their dignity to me, unless it may be that Avaro has some little hand in the matter.</P>

<P>After all this, the subtile priest thought that the antichristian hierarchy of Rome could not stand upon a foundation solid enough, unless all, or at least some of the
<PB N="196" REF="027249_0177_0FD3ECACA593C428"/>princes of Europe were invested with ecclesiastical titles, and so adopted into the new modelled church. Therefore I told his holiness, that I had three highly finished medals by me ready prepared, fitting for royal personages. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scribed, Rex Catholicus; let it be present∣ed to your servant his majesty of Spain. This second medal, inscribed, Rex Christianissimus, will be an acceptable pre∣sent to your vassal the French king; and this third inscrib∣ed, Rex Fidelissimus, I advise you to bestow upon the little monarch of Portugal. His hoary holiness with raptures replied, "Very good, most noble Fastosus, this device will doubtless secure all these three princes, as so many pillars to support my infallibility. But what of the king of En∣gland, sir? I dread those islanders. Is there no medalian charm, by which that invincible prince can be secured to our interest? I pray you good Fastosus lend me an hand in this.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour to serve your holiness, replied I, and then he withdrew. Soon after I presented him with a me∣dal suited to his wish. It bore this inscription, Desensor Fide, and was given to the monarch of England; but alas! I has not answered our expectations, for this same monarch instead of defending the orthodox faith of Rome, was the first crowned head that protested against the supremacy of the Italian bishop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is somewhat droll, that the king of England having shaken off the yoke of Rome, should still keep pos∣session of the medal, which his predecessors received as a present from the pope. One would think that when the pope himself was renounced, in strict justice all his gifts should have been restored, and the title Defend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Faith, have been, by a protestant prince, rejected amongst the rest of Romish trumpery; but wonders never cease. Did you finish here, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Avaro, I assure you, many titles besides these were first issued from my office, such as His Grace,
<PB N="180" REF="027249_0178_0FD3ECACB77DCF80"/>a title claimed by many a graceless duke, as well as anti∣christian priest. His Lordship, a title by which many a profane nobleman and irreligious bishop are distinguished. His Honour, claimed by many persons who never felt one desire after true honour. When a gentleman's honour de∣pends merely upon his estate, table and equipage, such a title as His Honour, very ill becomes him, yet many such there are who claim the appellation.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg leave to observe that, according to modern maxims in my country, he is esteemed a man of honour, who can imitate the popish priests in scorning wedlock, and frequenting the company of lewd women. He who is a stranger to every delicate and chaste sentiment; who scorns religion, disregards morality, and thinks it beneath his dig∣nity to keep any of the commands of God; or even for a moment, to reflect that there is an hereafter. It would be difficult to persuade some people, that, the British senate is too much composed of such men of honour as these. I should be glad, sir, to hear your opinion of a man of honour more at large, for I know that you are wise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman of true honour, fails not to improve his estate, be it great or small, to the best advantage; for he is neither indolent nor extravagant. His increasing re∣venues are not heaped up for ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation, nor laid by as use∣less lumber, but applied to clothe the naked back, and re∣fresh the empty belly. His principal care is not how he may aggrandize his family, but how he may best serve his king and country: for he lives not to himself, but to the public good. He adheres to strict truth, is an utter stran∣ger to impertinent raillery, and perfectly detests the voice
<PB N="181" REF="027249_0179_0FD3ECACBB671F70"/>of slander. In his civil affairs, he does the same things to superiors, inferiors, and equals, which he would wish o∣thers in like circumstances to do for himself. If at any time he is so unhappy as to give his neighbour just cause of offence, he is free and open in confessing his error, and ready to retrieve it to the utmost of his power. The title of His Honour is well becoming such a man as this, whe∣ther his estate is great or small, his birth illustrious or ob∣scure. But mercenary statesmen, plunderers of the public, ill deserve the titles with which they are distinguished. Hap∣py might it be for Britain, if she could always procure of∣ficers for every department in government, who would pre∣fer the welfare of the nation to their own personal and do∣mestic emolument. And this every man of true honour will be sure perpetually to do.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to say it, Avaro; but bad as the world is, there is still many to be found, who with pro∣priety may be called men of honor: but it is well for us, they are mostly of obscure character. They cannot act the cringing knave, and vilely flatter their superiors, in order to gain preferment. Their countenances, adorned with comely modesty, cannot contend with the impudence of fools and rogues; therefore continue obscure, even when the most worthless are exalted. But if a truly honorable man, should by some miracle ascend to an eminent station, and be entrusted with public concerns, his country is sure to have a nursing-father, and not an accursed step-dame in him, as is often the case with other governors.</P>
<P>There is likewise, his reverence the parson, a title a∣scribed to many men, who lead very irreverend lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, sir, but it is the vulgar opinion that the reverence of the parson does not depend upon his moral con∣duct,

</SP>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, Avaro, but it is a prevailing mistake. Imposition of the hands, even of an apostle, could never make any man reverend, whose doctrine is heterodox, or whose conversation is immoral, otherwise our friend Simon of Samaria might have been numbered among their rever∣ences. Indeed, Avaro, were any man hardy enough to attempt it. I know of no subject more proper for satyr than the pretended reverence of the parsons. But he must be daring indeed, who would set himself to oppose the ortho∣dox priests of the day, for that would be thought by many the very same as to oppose God Almighty himself, and eve∣ry body would cry atheist at him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, sir, what is your opinion of reverence, and to whom may the epithet of reverend consistently be given?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To very few of the leaders of any denomination, Avaro, and yet perhaps to some few of every denomina∣tion among protestants. I hate them, cousin, and could not bear to talk of them were it not to oblige you, for they are avowed enemies to our administration, as you will see by the description of them. For he is a reverend minister, whether he is educated at Oxford or Aberdeen, who makes not gold, but the glory of Immanuel, and the welfare of immortal souls, the first end of his labours. Who is assi∣duous in his study, fervent in his ministry, and has a pa∣ternal affection for his people. Who studies not how to please the great, or to gain the esteem of the staring muki∣tude, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to approve himself to God and the consciences of men, not shunning to declare the whole counsel of God, without any mixture of the inventions or traditions of men.</P>
<P>You may follow this man from the church to the market, from the pulpit into his family, and find him all of a piece; his whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conduct is one chain of uniform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But it is not every gownsman, either papal or protestant, nor even every
<PB N="183" REF="027249_0181_0FD3ECAF90A48F20"/>dissenting minister, whom this description suits. Some there are, who can deny it, who are ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glity and overbear∣ing in their spirits; indolent in study; cool and lifeless in their ministry; thoughtless and unconcerned about the real welfare of their people. Yea, some are so wretchedly lazy, or so much taken up with idle and vain amusements, that it is with difficulty they can bring forth, once a week, an o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, fifteen or twenty minutes long, and that scanty pro∣duction perhaps, when it is exhibited, proves no more than a lecture on moral philosophy; or it may be a libel a∣gainst some different party or denomination of christians. You may f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow some of them from the church to their fa∣milies, and be fully convinced that they are divines only in name; they neglect in their families the very duties which they recommend to others; and what is still more, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nive at the same vices in their families, which they ex∣pose and condemn in the pulpit. But after all, they have the cure of souls, and are the venerable and reverend cler∣gy, in the same manner as the pope is the head of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urch; I mean by craft and usurpation.</P>

<P>It cannot be otherwise; for to our grief I speak it, the unalterable Immanuel hath reserved to himself the wis∣dom, power and prerogative to make ministers of the ges∣pel; and if men like Jannes and Jambres, will take upon them to imitate the inimitable works of the Almighty, they may be permitted to make things which may for a time be mistaken for gospel ministers, even as those magi∣cians performed miracles by divine permission.</P>

<P>No, Impiator, no such thing, or the gift of tongues had not been given at the feast of Pentecost: But it may be avered, that, if a man has no more learning than the most learned university can give him, he cannot possi∣bly be a minister of Jesus Christ.

<P>Among those mercenary orators, there are whom we call the Jumblers. They are such who study not their sermons from the scripture, but compile them from the writ∣ings
<PB N="185" REF="027249_0183_0FD3ECB523F594E8"/>of other men: being destitute of judgment to direct them in their compilations, they are obliged implicitly to rely on the sentiments of their authors. So it comes to pass, that they contradict on one Sabbath what they asserted and half∣proved the day before, merely because they happened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on authors of different s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>timents. But, alas! poor men, what shall they do? It is their trade; they know not how to get a living without it; they cannot dig, and to beg they are ashamed; therefore are under, a necessity of jum∣bling forward in the best manner they can. Of late years indeed, this jumbling tribe have hit on a more happy me∣thod of management, by which they both save their reputa∣tion and laborious study. Amongst learned men there have always been some few of genius and industry, who have found means to turn the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lness and indolence of their bre∣thren to their own emolument. They compose sermons, print, and sell them to the others, who pay first a good price for them, then preach them, that is to say, read them to their several co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gregations.

<P>I speak but of some of them, uncle; and to make good what I say, I can tell you that it is not the man, whom the ignorant populace revere, so much as the gown, cassock, and band, and these they would revere if they were seen upon an ass, provided always, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars were hid with a bunch of well powdered hair: I assure you, gentle∣men, amongst the intelligent laity, it is deemed a maxim, that any blockhead will do very well for a parson, if he has but friends to recommend him to a living: as a proof of this I shall tell you a short story. There is one Mr. Provi∣dent, a merchant in London, who hath four sons at the

It was lately Mr. Provident made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> visit to his sons and their tutor, when he took occasion to ask Mr. Teachum's advice in regard to his disposal of them.</P>
<P>To which the schoolmaster replied. "Sir, I have of∣ten with pleasure observed, a penetrating judgment, solid understanding, and an inviolable attachment to truth, en∣nobled with the generous principles of true benevolence, in your eldest so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. These qualities, sir, are excellently a∣dapted to the mercantile life; I would therefore advise you to train him up in your own business. Your second son, mas∣ter Thomas, hath genius sufficient for any business; but I hope, sir, you will excuse me, if I tell you that I have discerned one thing in him, which, in my judgment, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its him for the capacity of a mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hant. As I know, sir, you would have me to speak freely, you will not be offended with me, if I tell you, that it is a selfishness and contract∣edness of spirit, together with a violent propensity to lying and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quivocation. If he were my son, sir, I would bring him up to the law, in which he will very likely make a con∣spicuous figure. Your youngest son, master James, has, if I mistake not, along with a very considerable degree of dulness, an heart that is a stranger to sympathetic seel∣ings; but possesseth genius sufficient for a physician. I would point out the royal college for his residence."</P>
<P>Here Mr. Provident the merchant interrupted him, and said, "Sir, you have given your opinion of the two eldest, and the youngest, but you say nothing of Harry, my third so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; I pray what do you say of him?" To which, the teacher with a blush replied, "if it is agreeable, sir, I would advise you to make him a clergyman." To this the father, with a mixture of grief and anger, replied, "What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, do you think he hath genius sufficient for nothing else?" I am afraid not, said the master; but you can easily make friends with my lord bishop, and procure him a considera∣ble benefice.

No sooner does the sable go∣vernor t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy by the ear, than she feels an impulse up∣on her heart, which directs her to the play-house, opera, Vauxhall, Sadler's-Wells, or elsewhere; but very seldom to church. If at any time, for the sake of company, she takes her pleasure at church, the great deceiver keeps such a gingling of the chain in her car, that she cannot attend to one word of the service; by these means the park, the mall, the play-house, and the church, are in effect the same thing to many ladies of fashion.</P>

And what news from your friends, Avaro?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little, sir; only that diligence, frugality and good husbandry, go on as usual. All heads plodding, and all hands active to get and to save; for getting and sav∣ing is all the cry with them. I had a little matter to attend to last night, at the Swan-tavern, where there was a very respectable meeting of manufacturers, by whom some few things tending to promote emolument were considered. The first consultation was, "How they might conveni∣ently lessen the quality of their goods, that their profits
<PB N="189" REF="027249_0187_0FD3CD8BAAC40368"/>might be somewhat advanced:" in order to this a plan was proposed by Mr. Dolus, a very great tradesman, which was unammously agreed to by the rest. The second thing was to settle the prices, and come into mutual engagements, that no one should under-sell his brethren, which after some slight altercation was as unanimously settled. You must know, mankind are not satisfied with being oppressed by infernal tyranny; but to add to the devil's work, are got into the happy way of joining in combination to oppress and devour one another. Nor is this practice peculiar to any one set of men, but is common with dealers of every kind and denomination, from the opulent farmers to the dealers in coals and candles.</P>
<P>When this was done, a question was put, How they should finish a certain quantity of goods against a certain day then proposed? For it seems they have large orders at pre∣sent. To which one of them said, he thought it necessary to advance the journeymens wages in order to encourage their diligence. But this gentleman's motion was unani∣mously rejected; as an unprofitable way of proceeding, ve∣ry ill suited to the growing demands of their several fami∣lies. It was then proposed, that a small premium should be given to every workman who should finish a certain quantity of goods in a limited time, then and there to be stipulated. But this was also objected to, it being alledged, that some method might be found, that would produce the desired end, and yet save all those unnecessary premiums; which if given would introduce a very bad custom.</P>
<P>At last an old gentleman, whose hoary locks shone as silver from under his weather-beaten wig, arose, and most judiciously addressed his brethren in the following manner: "Gentlemen, you all know that such is the indolent dispo∣sition of journeymen, that in general let their wages be ever so good, they have no notion of obtaining more than will procure them a bare maintenance through the week, and a few quarts of strong beer on Saturday night and Sunday.
<PB N="190" REF="027249_0188_0FD3ECBD182248A0"/>Therefore to advance their wages, is the certain way to have them work less than they do at present. But let us lessen their wages in proportion to our extraordinary call for goods; for by how much more we drop the prices of workmanship, by so much the more work shall we have done. A bare living they must have, let the prices be ever so low; and but a bare living they will have, if they are ever so high. If we advance the price, they work less, and if we drop it, they will, they must work more. I say then let us drop the prices."</P>
<P>The old gentleman's advice was cordially embraced by them all, and every one blessed the sagacity of the old fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now grown grey in wisdom. And this day, or to morrow, the journey mens wages are to be lessened accordingly.</P>

<P>Yet sir, if my observations are just, I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of an imperfect notion that they were originally formed of the earth; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> part of the sub∣stance of the earth is esteemed much more precious and va∣luable than another, perhaps the people of fashion have the happiness of being formed of the more rich and esteemed particles, and the rest of mankind the infelicity of deriving their beings from vulgar clay.

<P>That is false philosophy, Avaro; the brittleness you speak of does not proceed from any defect in the natu∣ral
<PB N="191" REF="027249_0189_0FD3ECBE8C7DD0A0"/>constitution of their frame, nor from any rottenness in the materials of which they are made, but hath its cause from themselves. Many of them in their infancy are near∣ly starved, from an infamous notion that enough of whole∣some food is injurious to them
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some learned physicians, those celebrated defranders of the grave, have found out that bread itself, which has been esteemed the staff of life in all ages, is at last become dangerous to the con∣stitution, and therefore to be used with caution by all sorts of peo∣ple, especially such as are best able to see the doctor in case of personal indisposition.

This same gentleman has not so little sense under his great wig as not to know that his own personal emolument, is intimately connected with the weak consti∣tutions of people of quality, especially the ladies.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it well—for there is one of my disciples, a certain physician, eminent in practice, who hath acquired a genteel fortune by prescription, and who, if he is indis∣posed himself, will not suffer an apothecary's drug to pass his gullet, a plain indication that he knows it to be hurtful. I have often thought, a good constitution put into the hand of the doctor, is like a good cause put into the hands of the lawyers, it gets worse with deceitful handling. When a man is by the force of medicine fairly got down, the skilful phy∣sician knows very well how to hold him betwixt life and death as long as possible; till at last he dies by inches of that prevailing distemper which kills so many people of fashion.</P>

<P>True, Avaro, but farther to prove the gentry the causers of their own infirmity, I would observe that
<PB N="192" REF="027249_0190_0FD3ECC00AFDF700"/>what in infancy, penury and want leave of the constitution unconsumed, luxury and idleness well nigh finish in youth; so that when the lady comes to embrace an husband, the one half of her remaining days are spent under the hand of the Doctor, and the other half in pleasure and dissipation. As for the young gentlemen, before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down on their faces is able to resist the razor, they have commonly contracted such lothsome disorders, as render them more fit for an infirmary than for the marriage bed and have more need of a surgeon than a wife. Thus, Avaro, you may see by what means the constitutions of the gentry are so frequent∣ly enfeebled.</P>
<P>That they are formed of the same materials with their in∣feriors will appear, when you consider, that there were none either noble or ignoble in the original state of man∣kind; all were on a common level; but when we had made a conquest of them, it became necessary for the Almighty to dissolve the original equality, that the world might be rendered in some measure tolerable to all, amidst the confu∣sion and disorder which our dominion over them had intro∣duced. For if people cry out that the world is bad now, it is certain it would be infinitely worse were superiority and inferiority utterly abolished. Moreover, the Almighty to manifest the equity of his procedure, has so ordered it, that the system of superiority and inferiority is perpetually upon the change. You may find some persons now asking alms from place to place, who are descended from princes and nobles; and others in the most exalted station, who had their descent from very beggars.</P>

<P>There is another race which we distinguish by the name of mongr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, with whom I am deeply concerned. This generation of half-bred gentry includes tradesmen, the gentlemen of the law, and of the faculty, together with the farmers. These gentry consider themselves as pretty near, if not altogether on a level with the country 'squire, and therefore affect the manners or their superiors as much as possible. They are gentlemen, their wives are ladies and madams, and their children masters and misses. Hundreds of such gentlemen and ladies have I known, who could not justly boast that any of their ancestors, back to the tenth generation, were proprietors of so much as a single cottage with a cabbage garden.

I would likewise have a tax of half the value laid upon every young master and miss, the farmers, apotheca∣ries, attornies and tradesmens children, unless the hus∣band or father can make it appear that is annual rent, clear of all incumbrance, is not less than four hundred pounds; if so much or upwards, he should stand exempted from any such penalty, and enjoy the free use of such names of qua∣lity in his family.</P>

<P>Although it is quite foreign to my purpose, to die∣tate any thing to mankind which may be of service to them, I am free among ourselves to say, that my son's scheme is well concerted, and might answer valuable purposes, were it carried into execution. The numerous bankruptcies, which make trade so precarious in England, have their spring in this fatal imitation of people of quality, so prevalent among tradesmen. Could this so very pernicious practice by any means be supprest, the industrious merchant and manufac∣turer, would meet with fewer losses by their retailing cu∣stomers.</P>
<P>To your scheme, however, I would add another tax e∣qually necessary, and that is upon every Play-house, Assem∣bly-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and place of pleasurable resort. One-fifth at least, of every ticket to Almack's Ranelagh, every Play∣house, Cornely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Sadler's-wells, the Pantheon, and every rout whatever, ought to be sacred to government. Till this, or some such thing is done, it will be difficult for the sensible English to believe that their governors aim at any thing beyond their own emolument. As for the tax upon
<PB N="195" REF="027249_0193_0FD3ECC3D1D68B28"/>(madam) it appears indispensibly necessary, and can admit of no delay; however, we interrupt you, Fastosus.</P>

I love not the station thou hast placed me in; I have got parts to quality me for a better than this in which thou hast placed me, therefore I am not dealt with according to my merit." The poor la∣bourer, who by the way, is the most happy and contented of his species, is not altogether pleased, because he was not born a gentleman and heir to a good estate. The 'squire and his lady are almost mad with anger, because they were not descended of noble ancestors; the nobleman himself takes it very unkind that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> govern a king∣dom.

As for the man who is born to imperial dig∣nity, he is angry because he is not appointed lord of the whole world. And one you know, who having obtained the sway of the whole world was angry with God, because he had not made two worlds for him to govern; even so an∣gry, that he is said to have cried again.

<P>I have often heard it remarked by our infernal sages, that if the ambitious mind were to obtain what it is now in pursuit of, true contentment would be as far distant as ever; and an Alexander, who covets a second world to ravage, could he get that, would want a third, after that a fourth, and so on till he had plundered the many millions of worlds which God hath made. Even then, were such a thing possible, his ambition would be as insatiable as ever, and his last effort would be the same as that of father Belze∣bub's; I mean, he would attempt to plunder the eternal

Thus they alledge, that the lowest degree of ambition and discontent in man, if the Almighty were continually to gratify it, would ascend to the most daring attempt, of which the infernal monarch himself is capable.

That judicious pagan, Epictetus, seems very capable of instructing many who are called Christians, and who have the advantage of the bible. Yes! Infidelis! you and I both know, that ambition is the very vice which ruined our black fraternity, but for it they had been in heaven to this day.</P>
<P>As some quarrel with their Maker, on account of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e situation in life, I am equally successful in stirring up others, to take offence at the manner in which the Almigh∣ty hath formed their bodies; as to their souls, they do not regard them, indeed seldom consider that they have an im∣mortal spirit belonging to them. If by chance such a thought, as that they have an immortal soul, should pass through their minds, it gives them no concern in what position it is found, because they take it for granted that nobody sees it. So very inconsiderate and stupid are many, that one who understands the language of hearts, provided he could delight in the voice of discontent and murmuring, might meet with high enter∣tainment amongst our people.

<P>I have heard several people of allowed know∣ledge, modestly wish, that all court ladies laboured under the same misfortune the last unhappy gentlewoman does; being persuaded that if it were so, naked breasts would ne∣ver more be brought into fashion, to the annoyance of the gentlemen, and the scandal of the ladies, for you know fashions are all born at court.</P>

<P>Not at the court of London, Avaro, but Versailles, therefore it would indicate better sense in your knowing people, to wish the French ladies the above misfortune. It is held an act of high-treason against the French, for the En∣glish court to receive any fashion which hath not had a cer∣tificate from Versailles. This policy seems indeed very my∣sterious, when we consider that the British heroes can so effectually drub the monsieurs, as to make them cry <HI>peccavi,</HI> and at the same time the French ladies should have the En∣glish in such absolute subjection.</P>
<P>It is impossible, for any person to conceive the trouble I have, in preparing those ladies for the ball or assembly, or pantheon, and what art I am obliged to employ, in hiding their supposed defects and redundancies. The lady who fancies her stature to be somewhat too low, obliges me to add to it the whole length of a super tall pair of wooden heels, and is extremely careful to set off her little body to all advan∣tage possible, so that every beholder must be struck with
<PB N="198" REF="027249_0196_0FD3EC1F9B4166D8"/>the most perfect gentility of her appearance. On the other hand her neighbour, who is over-tall, is as careful on her part, to have the flattest heels that can be wore, and is e∣qually industrious in decking to the best advantage the whole of her extravagant height.</P>
<P>Nor hath her neighbour, who is affected with a dun or yellow skin, less trouble and anxiety of mind, besides her great toil of body. The waste she makes of wash-balls, and the best recommended cosmetics, together with her own and her servants labour, in endeavouring to rub off the na∣tive tinct, is not to be conceived. But alas! it is labour in vain. All the comfort which remains for her, is derived from a black necklace, assisted by two or three well disposed patches, which she hopes may in some measure over-cloud the hated yellowness of the adjacent parts.</P>
<P>So absolutely foolish are they, that I have some subjects who say, "Ah me, why were my ankles made so strong and fleshy? O that they had been slender and genteel; then I should not have been thus dependant on the mantua-ma∣ker for a covering for them." However, gentlemen, were it not a rule established among the fair sex, that ankles somewhat gross are altogether ungenteel, it would puzzle a philosopher to determine how it is that small feet and slender ankles, come to have more virtue and real worth in them, than those that are otherwise. But certainly it is deemed to be so, and those imperious dames, who have been favour∣ed to their liking, do what they can to mortify those who are less happy in their pedestals. Against this disease there is no effectual remedy. Small sized shoes formerly gave them great hopes of relief, but alas! they generally made cripples of their wearers.</P>

<P>Another of my disciplesses has got hair of a mad∣der red, and such is her folly, that it grieves her beyond measure. But with all my wisdom I could never find out the reason, why red hair should be any more scandalous, than yellow or flaxen locks: or how it is, that scarlet is held to be such a courtly colour upon broadcloth, and yet so scandalous for a lady to have her head of a scarlet colour. But the lady herself is so apprehensive of the scandal, that she is obliged to exchange her native locks, with a neigh∣bouring barber, for a set of flaxen false-curls; these she flatters herself will very well become the native fairness of her skin.</P>
<P>Perhaps, indeed, to spare the natural crop, she may blind the eyes of beholders with powder, which may help to con∣ceal the awful secret. The like expedient is used by wo∣men of a coquetish disposition, when to their great grief and inconsolable sorrow they first perceive old age dying a white∣ness upon their temples. In order to prevent the world having any suspicion that she is advanced in years, the co∣quet procures a defence against the appearance of hoary hairs, and thus she keeps herself as much as possible, from the belief that she is growing old, till the detested wrinkles on her forehead betray the fatal secret, and then she de∣clines faster than other women, because her grief gives swiftness to her decay. Another lady is exceedingly griev∣ed every time she looks in her glass, because, as she thinks, her face is too much upon the fire to be deemed lovely; but she comforts herself with the reflection that she hath good features, and the great artist, when he finished her has left a dimple in her chin. On the other hand, her cousin be∣holds a system of agreeable features in her own countenance: but oh! the dejection of her heart, on recollecting the pale∣ness

Thus she has some means of comfort within her power, but her poor sister who is seamed with the small∣pox, is quite inconsolable. If at any time she expresses satis∣faction, it is in speaking of the former agreeableness of her features, and fairness of her skin. But alas her joy is pre∣sently clouded with the melancholy consideration, they are for ever gone. Some ladies are highly offended because their hands are so big, others that their fingers are too short; and now and then you may meer with one, who is dreadfully tormented underneath a king Richard back; which is sure to prove an intolerable burden all the life of the unhappy woman.</P>

<P>Nothing more fully demonstrates our dominion in the hearts of mankind, than their being ashamed of their shapes and physiognomy; the supposed deformity of which, they could by no means have prevented. Every degree of this kind of shame, is a tacit reproach of the Creator, and therefore daringly impious. Many you may find, ashamed of the innocent defects of their outward frame, who are not in the least ashamed of their vain lives and im∣moral conversations; to rectify which ought to be their principal concern.

<P>One would wonder it did not wholly discourage him from making further attempts against such people, especially if what I have heard is true: I mean that very affliction which they endure by his means, will be an ag∣gravation to his own misery; but his hatred against them is implacable.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not altogether his hatred and malice against them, which excite him to persecute them with such un∣wearied diligence: but it happened on a time, that Belze∣bub was by, when one of his heavenly heralds declared, <Q>That in all the afflictions of his people Immanuel himself is afflicted.</Q> And at another time he heard another say, <Q>That Immanuel is touched with a sense of human infirm∣ities;</Q> nay, then said he to himself, they shall not want for afflictions if I should endure a thousand hells. It will be a heaven of delight to me, to see my fiery darts bound off from the persons to whom they are shot, and strike him whom I have in the most perfect abhorrence. So that it is Immanuel himself, rather than those who believe in him, at whom Satan is so much enraged.</P>
<P>To return to my story—By my means the knot of sister∣hood between Rachel and Leah was untied, friendship and love fled to a distance far remote from their tents. But this was not the finishing stroke of my artifice, for when one generation passed away, you might always be sure to find me with those, who made their appearance next upon the stage of action. Hence I was found with the sons of Jacob, and made them perpetrate deeds very unworthy of the pat∣riarchal character, and that even in the life-time of their father▪ The destruction of the Hivites by the sword of Si∣meon and Levi, in revenge of Shechem's rape on their sis∣ter Dinah, was wholly by my instigation. They grieved, and that justly, but pride alone called up the demons of re∣venge
<PB N="203" REF="027249_0201_0FD3ED42A1030CC0"/>and cruelty, who drenched themselves in Canaanitish blood.</P>
<P>When Joseph dreamed of his future advancement, I pre∣railed with his brethern to hate him, and give admission to every baleful demon; under whose influence, even at the bazard of their father's life, they fold him into Egypt. There I stirred up Sabrina, the wife of Potiphar, to re∣venge her slighted charms upon him; Joseph himself to swear by the life of Pharaoh, and to carry it very strange∣ly to his brethren in the time of their affliction, notwith∣standing he himself had seen such wonders of divine provi∣dence, as mentioned by the writer of his life.

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mention the best on purpose to save myself trouble, cousin. For when you hear of my power over them, you will easily conceive that my dominion over the rest of mankind must be absolute. I might indeed do myself ho∣nour, by telling you of the part I had in the Iewdness of Ham, the despite of Ishmael, Esau's revenge, &amp;c. &amp;c. but as I understand it all implied in the present plan of my narrative. Indeed it would be endless to tell you of even a thousandth part of my archievements; and I am persuaded it is more agreeable to you, to hear of my occasional prevalence ever the virtu∣ous, than to have a full display of my uninterrupted domi∣nion over the infidel part of mankind without it.</P>
<P>Yet it may not be amiss, by way of specimen, to give you one instance of my influence over infidels in general. A∣mongst the millions I might adduce. I shall refer you to Bafuris Pharoah king of Egypt, in the days of Moses and
<PB N="204" REF="027249_0202_0FD3ED43E0EA1620"/>Aaron. Notwithstanding the migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> signs and wonders which God wrought by the hand of his Hebrew servants, he was so absolutely under my dominion, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardened himself against the Almighty, disregarded the voice of his prophets, and would not suffer the people to go into the wilderness to worship. Moses and Aaron wrought works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uprecedented, in the presence of the king and his nobles; but I persuaded him that the whole was effected by the pow∣er of magic, and that Jannes and Jambres his own encha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ers, could do the same were they called to it.</P>
<P>I had got such possession of his heart before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y miracles were wrought, that he thought himself inferior to no being whatever, and scorned subjection even to the Almighty, Pharaoh's magicians in divers instances, by a divine per∣mission, imitating the wonders wrought by Moses and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on; he persuaded himself that he was at least equal to that God who sent them, and in the most haughty disdain he said, "Who is the Lord that I should obey him?"</P>
<P>You have all heard that no man hath hardened himself against God at any time, and hath prospered: nor did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prosper. I hardened his heart against every divine inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c∣tion—till the God of the Hebrews utterly confounded the Memphian magicians, and made the haughty monarch not only willing to let the people go, but eager to thurst them out of the land. However they had not travelled very far, before Pharaoh, being a little recovered from his consteria∣tion, was induced by me to pursue and oblige them to return to their drudgery, alledging the great loss which both his majesty and the Egyptian monarchy would sustain, by the departure of such a number of vigorous slaves. Pursuant to this purpose he mustered his chari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and horsemen, all the Egyptian chivalry, pursued the fugitives, by dient of sword to compel them to return to their spades and wheel-harrows, Every one must praise my noble intentions, for I designed that both hosts should have perished, the one by the sword of the Egyptians, and the other by the thunderbolts of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>This same glass, False-Reasoning, is the mirrer in which the Jewish clergy, doctors of law, scribes, and pharisees, tried the doctrines and actions of Immanuel and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll his followers. By these means they were fatally deceiv∣ed, and led to reject the council of God against themselves; yea, hardened to that degree, as to say, the light which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lighteneth every man that cometh into the world, is ab∣solutely darkness, and to charge the maker of all things with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing a magician; even to put forth their sanguinary hands, and murder the Lord of life.</P>

<PB N="210" REF="027249_0208_0FD3ED4C52EBDF40"/>that is to say, hereties, because they knew not the law, i. e. they did not measure length and breadth, exact∣ly according to the standard of orthodoxy, which in all ages has been the traditions of the elders, and not the scriptures of truth, as some have erroneously asserted.</P>

<P>That is nothing at all to the purpose, cousin. I readily grant, and none can honestly deny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the scripture is the standard of truth; but truth and orthodoxy are two things, very different, and sometimes diametrically opposite to one another. Bible doctrine is the same in all ages and nations, but orthodoxy in one nation differs at least as much from orthodoxy in another nation, as the several climates do from one another. To go no farther than Bri∣tain, you see what is south of the Tweed accounted the pu∣rest religion in the world, is, upon travelling further towards the pole, deemed corrupt, superstitious, and anti-christian. So it is <HI>vice versa.</HI> Moreover, what has been orthod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and apostolic in one age, has had the misfortune to become quite heteredox and damnable in the next: so that there is no ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tain standard of orthodoxy in any nation; but truth is always the same, and knows no standard but one.</P>
<P>Indeed the synod of Dort, and the reformers of the En∣glish church, have done what mortal men could do to fix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> everlasting standard of orthodoxy, by tying all future profes∣sors to subscribe their traditions.

Queen Mary's reign furnished the or∣thodox in her day, with a fine opportunity of discovering their zeal for the church, by murdering those who believed and obeyed the Bible; but her reign being short, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liza∣beth ascending the throne upon her demise, the other scale rose uppermost, and the protestants in their turn became or∣thodox; i. e. got the government into their hands.</P>

<P>But to return to my story. I taught the respectable Pha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ees in general the use of my instruments, which as you saw in the late experiment, perfectly inverteth every object; and so, by my prudent management, those very people, held to be the most religious of the Jews, were wrought up to such a degree of self-conceit, as to fit them for executing the will of the devil; still supposing that they were doing good ser∣vice to the God of Israel. Contemplated under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er of my ingenious instruments, those Pharisees, who were darkness itself considered themselves as angels of light, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> became so enamoured of his own personal excellence, that all who were not of their sect and persuasion, were held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most consummate ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrence; as accursed and igno∣rant of their traditions, yea, even enemies to the Almighty.</P>
<P>They viewed Immanuel, the brightness of the Father's glory and express image of his person, by the help of my glasses, in which to them, he appeared as one come from Belzebub, and performing miracles in the spirit and power of the great apostate. His immediate disciples were indeed, men of whom the world was not worthy, yet view∣ed by the help of these notable instruments, they appeared as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reatures the most despicable. Although men of peaceful principles willing to spend, and be spent for the good of man∣kind, they were held to be enemies to the public good; men
<PB N="214" REF="027249_0212_0FD3ED2D2F5460F8"/>who turned the world upside down: unworthy of a dwelling in the tents of humanity, and therefore thrust out of the world with violence. Such wonderful works were accom∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished of old, by the help of these amazing instruments, and still they are as ever perfect, and fit for operation.</P>
<P>Even at this day, when the whole system of revealed truth is examined by my inverting mirror, it is misapprehended as cunningly devised fables; a well concerted system of falshood; or a priestly imposition on the consciences and understanding of the laity. Yes, my fellow destroyers, by my wise go∣vernment, many who value themselves as the greatest masters of reason, are so absolutely stupid as to suppose that the eter∣nal God has left men at large without a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y given law or re∣velation of his mind, to which their submission is required.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I accomplished it in the following manner. First, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his supreme holiness, with a pair of my instruments, in the right luciferian construction, on purpose that he might, by their assistance, try all the bulls he should publish, and all the causes which should come before him. For it ought to be observed the time was, when the whole world won∣dered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> infallible judgment. Infallible, so given out, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ages received. Yea, so powerful, so effica∣cious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been the word of his holiness, that ere now his ve∣ry bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> has blown the crown off from the head of one prince upon that of another. So very extensive his sove∣reign sway, that to give a kingdom to a devoted friend, was no more to him, than to give a snuff of sneezing would be to a trusty Highlander.</P>
<P>From the use of my instruments, there arises a necessity that his holiness's bulls, &amp;c. should be the most perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣antichristianism; so that in the inverting mirror they may assume the likeness of unerring truth. It is the same with the persons and things which the hoary father is concerned with; the sentence is, in general, contrary to the real intrin∣sic
<PB N="216" REF="027249_0214_0FD3ED54402B84A0"/>merit of the party or cause. Hence we find a turbulent Becket c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nized for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and placed among the Roman deities; and a pious Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer conde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to the stake Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ide is rewarded as meritorio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, whilst walking according to the dictates of conscience is held altogether damnable, both in this and the future world.</P>
<P>From the proper application of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irror, popish bulls, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crees of councils, canons of churches, human composed for mula's of worship, are supposed to be stamped with divine authority; whilst the Bible, that only revelation of the divine mind, is co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ered not only as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sufficient to shew to men the way of salvation, but even dangerous to be read by the laity. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is absolutely forbidden their use, lest by know∣ing too much of the will of God, they should perish from the popish faith; so the good old vicar obliges the laity to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to hell blind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olded without complaining.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more certain, than that either his holiness the pope, or the writers of the scriptures, must be mistake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er says, the bible is dark, mysterious, difficult to be understood, and even dangerous to the souls of men; whereas the latter say, the scripture way of salvation is so plain and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the way faring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> though a stranger, though even a fool, shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therein. The pope, has for weighty rea∣so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, been pleased to forbid the use of the scriptures, under the heavy penalty of death and damnation; Jesus the author of the bible, commands all men to search the scriptures; and his spirit in Paul, applauds this conduct in the noble Bereans. Surely this points out the very person of antichrist. His holiness at Rome, and all other great leaders of the church, are of opinion that the scripture is not of itself sufficient to be the guide of conscience, the rule of faith and practice, therefore canons, creeds, liturgies, &amp;c. are introduced to make the formula of worship more compleat. But Paul the apostle tells mankind, that, the scripture is able through God to make them wise to salvation. So that the one or the o∣her must needs be mistaken.</P>

<P>His holiness of Rome was in the right to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rbid reading of the bible, and they find their account in so doing.

By these means also, the holiness of real saints is called heresy, and the heresy of the papists obtains the name of holiness.

<P>That is true, cousin; but their first concern is not with Immanuel, but his holiness the pope.

Therefore, those that hope for favor with the inhabitants of heaven, must be very careful not to loose the good graces of the parson; for it is thought, that no man can meet with a cordial reception in the other world, but what brings proper credentials with him from the ghostly guide of his conscience in this.

Fraudulent religion is liable to many disadvantages which that of truth enjoys, and although the one will eternally stand of itself against all the machinations of darkness, the other will require the assistance of violence and intolerance to uphold it.

For whilst in the body, it is impossible to make a thorough bred papist more diabolical than he is already.

<P>No, cousin, they are not forgetful of tradition, for with all the pompous parade of lordly prelates, there is not a small part of the episcopalian formula that derives its e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣istence from the traditions of even the Romish father. Cring∣ing and curtsying when the name of Jesus is pronounced; worshipping with the face towards the east; keeping of lent and other holidays, besides the Christian Sabbath; fasting on Fridays; crossing in baptism, with a great many more, are all sprung from the Italian fount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ In like manner the names of their priests evidently shew that the pope stood godfather at the christening.

<SPEAKER>DIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, cousin Impiator; all are apostolical, if their own testimony is to be credited; all the Romish clergy are apostolical, and give it out that Peter the fisherman was their great-graudfather. The church of Scotland is also apostolical, and the power of the twelve apostles is thought to have been transferred to the Scotch presbytery. The independants are apostolical also, on account of the soundness of their doctrine and regularity of some part of their discipline. But both they and the north country clergymen labour under some disadvantages; for the latter have lost the deed of transfer, which conveyed the authority of the apostles unto the presby∣tery, and the former are unhappy enough to be unable to pro∣duce either precept or precedent from the apostles for infant sprinkling, which is notwithstanding a foundation doctrine, and by them accounted Christian baptism. The baptists; or as the independants and methodists respectfully call them a∣nabaptists, you may be sure are not less apostolical than their neighbours, having, besides all the advantages claimed by the independants, the enjoyment of baptism according to the primitive institution. So that no defect whatever, in point of a gospel spirit, can hinder them from being apostolical.</P>
<P>Even Mr. Wesley and his preachers give themselves out to be apostolical, notwithstanding Mr. Wesley asserts that salvation is by works, which the apostle Paul denied. No contradiction whatever will hinder the teachers of the people from considering themselves as apostolical. When I am us∣ed to attend the Sandemanian church after service time, and divert myself with their playing at blindman's buff, I confess I could not easily gather from what part of the apostles con∣duct they derived their warrant for this game; any more than for cards, skittles, attending plays and masquerades, going to Vauxhall, Ranelagh, &amp;c. &amp;c. and yet this is the
<PB N="225" REF="027249_0223_0FD3ED6168CE7110"/>only apostolic church in the world in its own esteem, taken in its proper connections. However it is said, some of the oldest pillars of the church having had their shins repeatedly broken, and the elders noses having been smitten even to bloodshed, they have laid aside that dangerous play of blind∣man's buff, so very apostolical a few years ago, and have found out ways and means of becoming little children, less dange∣rous and more becoming their infant capacities, by which they may spend the evening of every Sabbath.</P>

<P>By your leave, cousin; I have often been puzzled to find out how it is the prelates of the church of England came to be apostolical and I protest I cannot after all unrid∣dle the mystery. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heard my father say, that the a∣posties were never conscerated to any see whatever in En∣gland, and that there were not half the number of apostles there are of prelates even in this island. Moreover, I have heard him say, the archbishops and bishops of the English church are the successors of the arch-flamins and flamins, the eignitaries of the old British pagan church, prior to the days of Lucius. Now if they hold the honours and revenues of the pagan clergymen, how is it that they are apostolical? Is it because the name is changed from flamin to bishop, or how?</P>
<P>Certain it is the English bishops must be of a more noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder than the apostles. They are lord bishops; they possess great revenues; they are cloathed in soft raiment, and dwell in kings courts; they are too high, too polite, too dig∣nified to preach in a common assembly, or indeed in any o∣ther more than twice or thrice a y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r. But the apostles were men of mean extraction, not Lords, not Right Reve∣rends; plain Paul, Peter, James, &amp;c. they were contented if their revenues would purchase food and raiment for them; they seldom appeared among great men, in kings courts, o∣therwise than in quality of prisoners; they were willing to spend and be spent, in preaching the gospel to all people, and on all occasions; they had no carriages, no equippages; they

The church of England in her rubrick defines a church to be "a congregation of faithful men, where the word is preached, and the ordinance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are administered;" from whence it is plain, a church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>say meet in a house which has never a steeple; and a man may leave the house of parish worship, or what is called the parish church, and yet cleave to a congregation of faithful men and women, where the ordinances are administred and the word preached, which the rubrick, as before observed acknowledges to be the true church. Churches are built of living stones, which never a parish church nor cathedral in England is, therefore a departure from them can never with propriety be said to be a schism in the church.

Then shalt thou thyself be led to renounce the fartasies of this vain life, and solicit neither for church nor state preferment, but wilt content thyself with getting money in a way of trade, like our self-denying brethren. I say again, vain man, consider how worldly are thy practices."</P>
<P>"As for you my friends of the presbyterian and inde∣pendant denominations, I allow that ye do not conform to the corrected mass-book, for which some praise is due to you.

By leading of people to submit to those primitive ordinances, thou dis∣honourest the light within thee, which teaches those who obey it to despise ordinances, as thou seest in the case of our brethren. Besides, thy cloaths are of a dark colour, like those of other hirelings, and men-made preachers. Why dost thou not imitate our elders in wearing cloaths of a religious colour, even of an holy drab?

<P>I have often wondered what it is, that makes a drab colour more religious and becoming than another; yet certainly it must be so, for the quakers are wise, very wise, and could not be imposed on, as every tradesman who deals with them is ready to testify. Amongst my disciples, I have heard amazing accounts of the wisdom of the quakers, and the use they are of, in teaching even novices wisdom by their provident example. However, I have as much won∣dered what the papists, episcopalians, and every other sect of professors, discern so amiable and lovely in black, as to induce them to make it a canonical colour; and almost, if not altogether, essential to the ministrations of the word. No doubt they have heard that Belzebub is said to be drest in raiment of the deepest black, and one would wonder they should desire their ministers to be cloathed in the same uni∣forms, seeing they professedly have declared war against him and all his principalities. Yet so it is, for any other than dark coloured cloaths upon a minister, would frighten an auditory out of their pews, and the best of sermons would not be worth hearing, if the preacher were not invested in the sacerdotal livery.</P>

And in truth very few of them know any thing at all of religion, besides that very imperfect form which they have adopted. But we are wise enough to keep our thumb upon that, for if the cheat were discovered, I am afraid they would be glad to embrace that part of the form of religion which they reject, in order to obtain the power of it, of which the far greater part of them now are destitute.</P>

<P>I can tell you, the quakers are liberally paid back in their own coin. And amongst every fect of protestants hi∣therto mentioned, you will find some who seldom or never look at the people called quakers but through my telescope. Were you by, when the quaker is examined by the rest of the protestants, you would almost split your sides with laugh∣ing at their partiality and unfair representation. "Say they, the quakers religion lies all in their dress, speech and money getting. Their religion lies not in the head, but in broad brimmed half-cocked hats —Not in their hearts, but in their coats.—Not in their actions, but in their tongues.— All their public meetings are calculated to promote the great
<PB N="234" REF="027249_0232_0FD3ED6D768C85F8"/>end of getting money and increasing commerce; are not re∣ligious, but merely political."</P>
<P>By this you may see, that the quakers are abused and be∣lied in their turn, as well as they abuse and belie others. The above reflections are just enough when applied only to some, or to a great many of them, but will by no means hold as a general rule: seeing you all know, there is now and then a quaker who breaks away from his subjection to the god of this world; and despiting all that we and our sable clan can do to prevent it, gets safe within the palace of Im∣manuel. Moreover there are at those public meetings some, though comparatively few, who have a truly religious de∣sign in giving their attendance. From these things you may see my friends, that prejudice deals all in extremes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nows not how to speak favourably.</P>

<P>That is a gross mistake, into which we have with great vigilance ensnared the posterity of Adam. When a small number only of any particular body of people, are found guilty of a certain evil, the crime is usually charged upon the whole; and the precipitate injudicious conclusion is, "they are all alike." For instance, the Munster baptists were once guilty of certain outrages, with which the whole lect of antipedobaptists are to this day very charitably calum∣niated. And because very many of the quakers are amazing∣ly wise to get money, and to keep it when it is procured, it is often said they are all such, and that Avaro is their lawgiver. Hey day, whether is the rule of moral equity gone, that the professors of religion cannot set their eyes upon it? where is that candour and benevolence which the Christian reli∣gion every where recommends, that you, consin, have gained such an ascendancy over them?</P>

<P>By the instrumentality of these glasses, I got the preachers of salvation by grace traduced as Antinomians and the doctrines of the word of God bespattered, as so many sources of licentionsness. For instance, the preacher as his duty is, declares, "That salvation is not of works but
<PB N="235" REF="027249_0233_0FD3ED3689DD3CF0"/>grace," and may thus reason with the people. "You can do nothing that will recommend you to the favour of God; the Ethiopian may change his hue, and the leopard his spots, as soon as you, who are accustomed to do evil, can change your own nature, and learn to do well; for it is not of works of righteousness which ye have done, or can do, that your sal∣vation cometh, but merely by the calling of free mercy." I instantly clap my telescope to the eye of the legalist, and he exclaims, "What an enemy to good works, is this same wretched antinomian? According to him, we may as well do nothing, as strive to procure the favour of God; may as well lead lives the most vile and profligate, as study to live righteously and holily; for according to this same preacher, our wickedness is as acceptable to God, as our most holy and virtuous living. Yea, more acceptable; for he declares, that harlots and publicans shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, sooner than those who do what they can to procure eternal life by their holiness and good works."</P>
<P>Such is the language not only of the vulgar and ignorant, but of many who profess to know much of religion. When∣ever the self-sufficient Arminius is in the humour to try the doctrines of the gospel in cry inverting mirror, and the preachers of them in my partial telescope, he very candid∣ly and with great liberality bestows upon them such as the following reflections. "These wretched Calvinists repre∣sent the almighty God, as a partial and unmerciful being, who hides his gospel and withholds his grace from men of virtue, wisdom and prudence, whilst he reveals himself to the most notorious transgressors. They say, that a man of a regular inostensive life may perish forever, when a mur∣derer like Manasseh, a polluted prostitute as Magdalen, and a wicked oppressor like Zaccheus shall be saved. If this is true, then we had better live notoriously wicked, than so∣ber, righteous and godly lives. What wretched, what dangerous doctrine is this? They make God to be the au∣thor of sin too; for they say that nothing comes to pass,
<PB N="236" REF="027249_0234_0FD3CD958A67ECD8"/>but by divine appointment or permission. They talk also of some horrible decree, in which God is said to have ordain∣ed the things which are coming and shall come. No need of holiness, if salvation is not of him that willeth; no need of diligence, if it is not of him that runneth, but to whom the Almighty sheweth mercy. If God hath mercy only up∣on whom he will have mercy, and hardeneth whom he will, we may live as we please; for if to be saved we shall not be damned, what diabolical doctrine is this?
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These devils I perceive, are not very exact in literally copy∣ing the expressions; but content themselves with expressing the spirit of preachers and writers.

<P>My sire, I am all obedience to him who alone could give me being, and to resume the thread of my story would observe, that strange as it may seem, I do, by the help of these amazing glasses make one evangelical minister quarrel with another, and that merely because they do not under∣stand each others manner of expression. One man, for in∣stance, will have it that Immanuel obtained his personality by eternal generation; another will have it to be by divine filiation; and another still is content to believe him to be the only begotten of the Father, without attempting to explain how, or in what sense he is begotten or filiated. All of those three are firm in the belief of Immanuel's sonship, his deity, and mediatorial capacity, as well as every doctrine of faith. And yet, strange as it may seem, those very men shall be so prejudiced against one another, that they cannot comfortably have fellowship together; but may even prove injurious to each others usefulness: and it may perhaps be very difficult to determine which of the three discovers most of a gospel spirit. Every one is in the right, and infallibly assured that the other two ought to come into his opinion.</P>
<P>It is the very same with respect to diversity of gifts. One is led in a peculiar manner into the doctrines of faith, well able to state, define, and defend them against opposition. Another is widely led about in the wilderness of temptation and affliction, by which he obtains peculiar talents in com∣forting the distressed, and pouring oil into the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ding wounds of broken hearts. And a third is kept on the mount of enjoyment; his heart is kept warm by a sense of interest, by which enjoyment he is active and lively in the work, a zealous promoter of practical godliness. All of which gifts seem to be essentially necessary to a gospel ministry, and are all by the same spirit. And yet, would you think it, these very men shall treat one another as unfound in the faith in one sense or other? The first is deemed a dead, dull and useless preacher, whilst at the same time he is effectu∣ally
<PB N="242" REF="027249_0240_0FD3ED33866538E8"/>stopping the mouths of gain-sayers. The second, it is feared, loves to be peculiar, and verges a little towards Antinomianism, notwithstanding many a feeble knee is strengthened by his ministry. And the third is a rambling inconsistent preacher, notwithstanding by his instrumentali∣ty many are brought to a seuse of their sin and danger.</P>
<P>These quarrels are of great use to our government, as they fail not to reproach Christianity, stumble the weak believer, and grieve all good men. But this is not all. You know that two men may have the self same sentiments in religion; and yet one shall choose to express himself in this manner, and another in that, which difference of expression only may be attended with very serion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consequences, if candour is not present on the occasion. This was the case with Tre∣bonius and Theodorus. Theodorus heard Trebonius preach on a particular occasion, found himself offended with some of his expressions, and thought it his duty to make the preacher acquainted with it as soon as possible. But as Tre∣bonius has too good an opinion of his own attainments easily to retract a saying, he vindicated not only the doctrine, but the mode of expression. Theodorus was now more that e∣ver persuaded, that Trebonius was unfound in the faith, and was not satisfied with verbally defending the truths of the gospel, i. e. his own sentiments, but commenced a paper war with Trebonius. His apology for this step was indeed artful, for he lugged in both Christ and religion in∣to partnership with him, and under their authority, or pre∣tended authority, he did what he could to impeach the or∣thodoxy, and mar the usefulness of Trebonius.</P>
<P>When Trebonius read the performance, he found him∣self aggrieved, and something within him being deeply wounded he resolved on retaliation. To work he goes: first establishes his personal orthodoxy, which he also called the gospel of Christ, then vindicated his own proceedings, which by an happy turn of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ght he also linked with the honour of religion. Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e truth is, neither the gos∣pel
<PB N="243" REF="027249_0241_0FD3ED242CAE1C40"/>of Christ nor the honour of religion had any concern at all in the squabble. However, having first set himself and his doctrine in a respectable point of view, he proceeded diligently to search out and expose every blemish in the per∣formance, and in the end did as much for his brother as he before had done for him. Thus those two champious for the gospel, that is for their own honour, went on exposing to the public, all they were acquainted with of each others weaknesses and folly; never once suspecting that by so do∣ing each was exposing his own want of wisdom, and a true Christian spirit. Mean while the friends of both were ex∣ceedingly concerned, and in vain studied a reconciliation between them. But O what pleasure did it afford our soci∣ety? And how did Ambitiousus and me, and other jocular devils, laugh at their folly and childishness? From sources of no greater importance than this, I assure you, most of the quarrels amongst professors arise. But when the con∣tention is once begun, it is hard to say where it will end. By these means we get the affections of Christians divided one from another, and instead of being mutual helpers of each other, as the Almighty designed them, we make them mutual hindrances and burdens; so that though we can∣not indeed destroy them as we would, we disturb and dis∣tract them to an amazing degree.</P>

<P>I have before now stirred up a spirit of jealousy be∣tween a minister and his people, and between one minister and another, in a manner inexpressibly masterly. For ex∣ample, about a century ago, the accurate Camillus preach∣ed an excellent sermon at Potheina, which was heard by several of the people to whom Junius was pastor; and they being greatly affected with the seasonableness of the subject, and the practical manner in which it was handled, invited Camillus to visit them, and preach in Junius's pul∣pit, not doubting but it would be altogether agreeable to their beloved pastor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll of the sermon, when they came home they could not help making Junius partaker of their pleasure. They expatiated largely upon the excellency of his method, the fertility of his illustration, and the propriety of his appli∣cation, all of which they did not doubt but Junius would ad∣mire as much as themselves. But this was not precisely the case. Junius could not help being sensibly affected with what he had heard, but prudence forbid him to deny Ca∣millus his pulpit.</P>
<P>When retired, and reflecting on what had passed, he strongly suspected that his own honour was injured, by his
<PB N="245" REF="027249_0243_0FD3ED7A696361F8"/>peoples high encomiums on Camillus's sermon. "My people, said he, alledge they never heard such an excellent sermon as that which Camillus preached. 'Tis something strange, that this one sermon should affect them more than all my seven years preaching among them. I never heard them say half so much about any sermon of mine. It shows a great want of affection and respect to me as their own mi∣nister, I conceive; and they shall hear of it at a time con∣venient."</P>

<P>With Junius's leave I think he discovers a love of praise, which is by no means the offspring of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humble spi∣rit. He would rather be flattered, than his people should be filent in his commendation. But the judicious seldom think it prudent to say much in praise of any person to his face, how well soever they may be affected towards him; and that for two very good reasons. (1.) Such commendation has not a little of the appearance of flattery, however sin∣cere it may be in the party who bestows it. (2) There are but few who are able to bear much commendation, without sustaining damage by it. A man must be led deeply into an acquaintance with his own nothingness and insufficiency, before he can bear to be praised and caressed.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a very common thing in the gospel churches, that if they have a member of more usefulness than others, they exalt and ex∣tol him above his measure; so that he becomes elated with self∣conceit, and in the issue, when he cannot carry every point his own way, he turns against his former caressers, and becomes the scourge of the community. In this the righteous judgment of God is manifest, who will have all men to appear in their native noth∣ingness and emptiness, unworthy of the trust and dependance of one another.</NOTE></P>

<P>That is true, brother, and yet people may err wen on that hand, and be cautious over much; for fear of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing him up by unseasonable commendation, may depress the spirits of their minister by with-holding from him, that
<PB N="246" REF="027249_0244_0FD3ED7D106E6BC0"/>countenance and encouragement which his spirit and cir∣cumstances require.</P>
<P>People are in all things given to extremes, and either a minister is carest and almost adored as an unparalelled per∣son, or he has little or no notice taken of him. I remem∣ber a remarkable instance of this in the last century. There was an independant church, who having a minister of a lively address and sound doctrine, one who bid fair for great usefulness among them; yet a lineal descendant of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otrephes, who loved to have the pre-eminence; and one who chose to direct them in all the concerns of life, in their families, in their business, as well as in the church. To his government they yielded themselves implicitly, and almost adored the ground upon which he trod. With caresses and savours they loaded him, till they had raised him to the very height of self-sufficiency and importance; from which they themselves at last assisted to cast him down; and the contempt then poured upon him, pretty nearly equalled their former caresses. After him they had another, of an almost contrary disposition. He had but a very mean opinion of his own abilities, either for preaching or governing. He had such constant acquaintance with the power of his own corruptions, that he was commonly low and deprest in spirit. He never assumed any superiority over even the meanest member, firmly believing himself to be the vilest and most unworthy sinner of the whole community; he stood in need of all encouragement possible, in order to hearten him for his work. Yet the same people who had destroyed the for∣mer with unseasonable kindness suffered the later to drag on heavily all his days that from them he seldom or never heard of his word having been made useful. And I suppose must have sunk under his discouragements, if strangers who after∣wards came into the church had not been more free with him in discovering some degree of affectionate regard. Different spirits will require different usage, in order to preserve their usefulness: what was death to the former of those mi∣nisters,
<PB N="247" REF="027249_0247_0FD3ED7E8E914750"/>would have been life and vigour to the latter; and what so exceedingly weakened the hands of the latter, would in all probability have been the preservation of the former. But we forget parson Junius, cousin.</P>

<P>Sir, Junius would have his own humour; and ac∣cordingly, when the time came that Camillus made his vi∣fit any person attentive to Junius's behaviour, might easily find that his friend's room would to him, have been more agreeable than his company; notwithstanding for decency's sake, he forced himself to carry it to him with some degree of seeming civility: I say, seeming, for even Christian people have not as yet learned, to be exactly on all occasions what they seem. But Camillus is a sagacious man, soon perceived Junius's coldness through all his formal civility and seeming deference. He began to question with himself from whence this coldness might have proceeded? In what he might have given offence? But never dreams that jea∣lousy is at the bottom. Is he not offended with my doctrine? said he to himself. What can be the meaning of this distant carriage of his? What have I done or said that might give him umbrage? So Camillus reasoned, but hit not upon the real cause. And as Camillus is somewhat fond of his own sentiments, though a man inferior to few who are account∣ed good and religious, he could not help being in doubt a∣bout the orthodoxy of his friend. By these means, happily invented by me, this well-designed visit, instead of answer∣ing the valuable ends of promoting religious friendship, ra∣ther tended, by my intervention, to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enate their affections from each other.</P>
<P>Junius would still have his own humour, and from that day forward discovered a shyness to those, who seemed most delighted with Camill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and when occasion offered, he did not spare bestowing on them, what is called a dry rub.</P>
<P>This was not all, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could not leave his prejudice behind him when he went to the pulpit, where he adapted his discourses accordingly. On the other hand his people
<PB N="248" REF="027249_0245_0FD3ED35433C23E8"/>could easily see he was not in his usual spirit; and they con∣cluded, that they had given him no just cause of offence.</P>
<P>Mean while both parties mutually watched each others words and deportment. If Junius happened to speak any thing harsh either from the pulpit or in common conversa∣tion, it was said to proceed from a bad spirit. On the other hand if any of them happen to object to any thing spoken by him, he immediately co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cluded, either that his people were prejudiced against him, or did not love found doctrine; for he had not a doubt of the soundness and truth of his own doctrine. And so they went on, till in the issue there was a final separation. Behold, gentlemen, how great a fire a little spark of my nature kindleth. Every well-wisher to the Belz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bubian government must acknowledge, that the devil Discordans merits great applause.</P>

And I confess, that in every scuffle hitherto, I have had the worst of it; but I thank my stars, it is very seldom I meet with him. When we do meet, meek as he is, I am quite nonplussed, and am obliged either to flee, which I abhor, or to fall before him, which is yet a greater mortification to a spirit so noble as I am.</P>

<PB N="249" REF="027249_0246_0FD3ED254EEEA5A8"/>his elder brother Fides. Fides is a warrior with whom I have maintained a very long, though not doubt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> war; not doubtful, because I am wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed as sure as ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter the lists with him. With great facility I can overturn the pow∣er of every other heavenly chieftain; but this fellow, this same Fides is Immanuel's champion, and has performed the most unparalelled atchievements; such atchievements as ne∣ver were performed by any hero besides himself. He hath subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained pro∣mises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword; out of weakness hath made people strong, causing even from fainting to wax va∣liant in fight, turning to flight the armies of the aliens. He hath given to women their dead children again, sustained others under the most cruel tortures, in such a manner that they would not accept of deliverance; gave a good report of the promised land t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those ancient worthies who walked a∣bout in sheep skins and goat skins, destitute, afflicted, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormented, of whom, notwithstanding they lodged in de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and caves of the earth, the world itself was undeserving.</P>
<P>These are a specimen of his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chievements; but great and heroic as he is, he finds that I am also of noble deeds; a spirit not easily rendered inactive, and more difficult still en∣tirely to subdue Although he has the promise of the most compleat victory in the end, I put him to exert his utmost; for when to appearance I am dead as a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bble, and Fides has the sole pre-eminence in the soul of man, I play reynard with him, feign myself dead in order to escape the ven∣geance of his arm.</P>
<P>In time he finds out my deceit, for I watch the opportu∣nity when he is in the very heighth of a paroxism, and can scarcely breathe. He is exceedingly troubled with fits, which will sometimes hold him for a long time together, and in which you would take him to be wholly dead; then I take the advantage, and rise upon him with all my powers, and beat and bruise him till l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te begins to return, which is
<PB N="250" REF="027249_0248_0FD3ED6ECF0083E0"/>not always of a sudden; but when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the weight of my arm, and the smart of the wounds which I inflict on him, his spirit returns to renewed vigour, he unlocks the maga∣zines of grace, and brings forth such implements of war as I am not able to stand against; so that before he is well out of his fit he is as strong as ever. At other times he is a long while before he is freed from the effects of his fits; weakness, indisposition and langour hang upon him for ma∣ny mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths, at which time he receives no mercy at the hand of Infidel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>This fellow is of the most amazing constitution, for whereas on one hand business never fails to throw him into a lethargy, so on the other, hard labour, severe conflicts, and cruel buffetings, never fail to make him strong and vigorous; and what is very remarkable in itself, but very unlucky for me, is, that the more he is beaten and bruised, the stronger he grows, and these fits in which you would take him to be just a dying, it is said, only tend to make him the more ro∣bust and lively; which is the reason that although I frequent∣ly put him to great pain; I am always discomfited in the issue.</P>
<P>However, gentle friends, you must allow, when circum∣stances are considered, my valour will at least equal, if not prove superior to that of Fides. He fights under a certain assurance of victory, and knows of a truth, that in the end he shall be more than a conqueror; I as well know that I shall be discomfited, which would dishearten any besides myself, yet notwithstanding, the discouragement, I give him many a vigorous turn for it ere I desist, and foully trip up his heels oftener than thrice. Even when I have him down, sprawl∣ing and gasping for life, I am conscious he will afterwards renew his strength and give me a most severe drubbing; and, that his victorious hand shall in the end put a period to the days of great Infidelis. Yet this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oble principle of royal malice prompts me on, and I will not yield an hair's breadth whilst life endures. Oh the fearful combats I could relate, which I have had with this heavenly champion, this same Fides.</P>

<P>We shall be glad to hear of them, my brother, at another time; but at present, if agreeable, I should like you to resume the story, part of which we have already had

<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have already heard how agreeable to his holi∣ness my instructions were, as also of the laws by which the whole system of religion was inverted, and how the pious priest had invested himself with the perfections of deity. I knew that the introduction of this new Christianity might be attended with some difficulty, therefore advised his holiness, the father of the world, to deify some others as well as him∣self; but at the same time, lest his supremacy should be in any wise infringed, to take care that none should be deified till after their death, and that only with an inferior rank of godship. He took my advice, canonized a vast number under the title of saints, and ordained masses to be said to them out of his own newly composed bible: for the old bible in use amongst primitive Christians having its laws so con∣trary to those of the pope, was by his authority made null and void, and Rome once the mistress of the world, be∣came the mother of harlots? once more the seat of pagan∣ism. But for distinction's sake, we call the latter Christi∣an pagans, because they exercise all their villainy under the specious shew of Christianity.</P>
<P>In order to support the Christian pantheon worship, slaughter-houses were built, and called holy inquisitions; where every one who was known to deny the supremacy and in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lity of his holiness the pope, or so much as harbour a suspicion concerning the papal faith, was treated with as little mercy as if he had been in hell. By these means, people were kept in the most dreadful awe; so that, if any man happened to be intelligent enough to see through the cheat, he was obliged to keep his mind to himself; well knowing that one word spoken against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>crative faith of the priests, would have ensured his certain death by means
<PB N="252" REF="027249_0250_0FD3ECCDE5D5DE08"/>the most babarous and cruel. By this amazing subtility of priestcraft, with the utmost security they cartied on their villainy, under the mask of sanctity for many centuries, and all Europe trembled at the indignation of the priesthood. For by means of my brother's medals, and titles of eccl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si∣astical dignity, together with my blinding influence, the various orders of reverend fathers, clave as fas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his holi∣ness as scales to one another on the impenetrable back of le∣via<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han.</P>
<P>Yet terrible as the priesthood were, they could not totally prevent the light of the gospel shining less or more, in some parts of Christendom, especially in Britain; where Wick∣liffe and his disciples gave their reverences no small uneasi∣ness; for which they poured vengeance upon his bones for∣ty years after this demise. This same scripture light kind∣led in England by Wickli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e's ministry, spread itself to the continent, where first John H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss and Jerome of Prague, galled the sides of popish prelates: for which the very pious council of Constance, first recommended them to the care of the devil by excommunication, and then in the name of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od of mercy, condemned to be burned to death for believing the bible. It is amazing to think, with what dex∣terity they have lugged in the name of the Almighty, to fanctify their murders on all occasions.</P>
<P>About a century after this, a very strict enquiry after truth began, by the instrumentality of John Calvin and Martin Luther, two avowed enemies to popish wickedness. This revival of religion was very alarming to the priests of Rome, and very injurious to my government. His infali∣ble Holiness instigated by the devil Crudelis, voted their immediate destruction by fire and faggot, by poison, assas∣sination, or any way; for there is nothing dreaded by this same vicar of Christ, so much as the spreading of gospel knowledge.</P>
<P>These measures however I withstood, having from past experience found, that coersive measures are by no means
<PB N="253" REF="027249_0251_0FD3ECCF0E56B720"/>the most likely to reduce professors of religion to the obedi∣ence of infidelity; and I thought it better to send the devil Discordans to visit them, with instructions to make them quarrel about the forms of religion, this I took to be the most likely method to invalidate the testimony of both, and to baffle and confound their followers. This was done, and they jarred exceedingly about circumstantials; but do what we would, they spake of the doctrines which are absolutely necessary to salvation, with perfect uniformity, which great∣ly frustrated our dark designs; and this fire of reformation so lately fanned, by degrees spread itself on the Continent, and in Great-Britain, where it arose in the days of Wick∣liffe.</P>
<P>The pope and me being loth to give up the government, we had always been accustomed to have in these nations, did what we could to stifie the reformation: but alas, it went on with rapidity in the days of Edward, and might have made greater advances than it has ever yet done, if luckily for his holiness and me, that prince had not been ta∣ken away in early life. Mary being a princess just fitted to our turn, no sooner ascended the throne than I flew to En∣gland, accompanied by the devil Crudelis, resolving at all events to crush with oppression, all who rebelled against me and his holiness. To this salutary purpose were transport∣ed from the pope's arsenal, abundance of hempen cord and faggots beyond number, that we might oblige the people to renounce Jesus Christ, and worship his Romish infallibility.</P>
<P>There were in those days two lusty bishops, right rever∣end tyrants in the devil, Bonner of London, and Gardiner of Winchester, who hearing of our arrival, came equipped in their prelatic robes, to do us greeting, and bid us welcome to the British shore. This brace of right reverend prelates, we appointed prime inquisitors in matters of faith, and prin∣cipal agents of our intended cruelty: indeed none that ever sustained the office of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iest, ever were more trusty friends,
<PB N="254" REF="027249_0252_0FD3ECD1A86A4C58"/>to the government of Rome and hell, than were those wor∣thy prelates.</P>
<P>The vigilant devil Crudelis ceased not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y or night from p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsecuting the saints, so that many of the ringleaders of the sect of the Nazarenes were apprehended, tried, con∣demned, and tormented to death at a stake; such as arch∣bishop Cranmer, bishop Hooper, bishop Latimer, bishop Ridley, &amp;c. &amp;c. But as it happened in former persecutions, so it fell out in this. The ashes of burned saints proved such fertilizing manure to the church, that in defiance both of hell and the pope the detest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Nazarenes became by far more numerous Wherefore, if our friend Mary, of zealous and scarlet memory, had not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n summoned hence to re∣ceive her reward, the poor devil Crude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is must necessarily have desisted merely from incessant and unsuccessful fatigue, and the Nazarenes would have obtained rest, solely from our desperation.</P>
<P>But when Immanuel beheld such havock made of his church, and so many places bathed with sanctified blood, his wrath took the alarm; in his judgment he cut down the zealous queen and her two trusty bishops, and raised queen Betsy to the throne of England. Now the sword of perse∣cution was wrested from the hands of the papists, and the good people of the church of England, did for the puritans what the zealous papists had done for them during the reign of queen Mary. This same queen Elizabeth, was a great zealot for high church, and a vigorous nurse of episcopa∣cy; but the Brownists and other dissenters, felt the full weight of her regal vengeance. I happily prevailed unex∣pectedly with the divines of the established church, to re∣tain the more refined part of the popish system; which those men who were for a thorough reformation, both in doctrine and discipline, could not comply with; and for their non-compliance, we taught them that the arm of e∣piscopacy is every whit as heavy as that of popery, when it is exerted for the good of the church. And for my own
<PB N="255" REF="027249_0253_0FD3ECD2D48F5DE0"/>part I prompted their reverences, to coersive measures, be∣ing very apprehensive, that the reformation might have been carried on farther than it really was.</P>

<P>And I assure you, I myself was not idle in those days, but played my game into the hand of great Infidelis. I met their lordships the prelates; (I shall never forget it) in full convocation, and reasoned with them on the intend∣ed reformation, and unto my arguments they lent a willing and attentive ear. "Well, gentlemen, said I, do you intend to come to a thorough reformation then, and reduce Christianity to its primitive simplicity? Have you consider∣ed, gentlemen, that in so doing you must lose your prince∣ly revenues, and descend to a level with plain Peter, Paul and Barnabas, which must needs be a very mortifying step to some of you. Recollect, I pray you, how long your present profits and dignities have been enjoyed by your pre∣decessors in your several sees. Long before Christianity was known in Britain; even beyond the ken of history, this nation was divided into the several bishopricks and archbi∣shopricks by you enjoyed. Through all the ages of popery, the same division of the nation into archflaminries and fla∣min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, continued under their present denominations; and will you discover such a degree of mortification, as to give up the profits annexed to your ecclesiastical dignities? That were to show, indeed, that protestant bishops have less provi∣dence than pagan flamins. Yet, if you are determined to purge your religion from every relict of popery; your pro∣fits, gentlemen, must be parted with, your revenues must be enjoyed no more, and how will this be relished by you?" By such sensible and seasonable remonstrances, I won great∣ly upon the minds of their lordships, and in the issue it was resolved, that rather than part with their dignities and re∣venues, they should submit to many things which have no foundation in scripture.</P>

<P>You bring to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mind, cousin Avaro, the recep∣tion I met with by the dignitaries of the ancient church, on
<PB N="256" REF="027249_0254_0FD3ECD4759A3E88"/>the distribution of the fore-mentioned medais. I went at∣tired in my robes of slate, to deliver one of my archiepisco∣palian medals to a certain priest; whom I instantly created "His grace and most reverend." He mumbled over to himself several times; "most reverend, his grace," view∣ing the medal with the closest attention. It is—it is, said he, a very soft and agreeable mode of address. Most re∣verend; his grace. Yes, my lord, said I, it is very mu∣sical, and what I myself only am capable of composing. A mode of address very becoming the dignity of an archbishop. Humble preachers, such as Peter, Paul, Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy, and Titus, might be very well contented, without being their graces and most reverend, for they were not as you are, courtiers, clothed in soft raiment. But for a spiritual courtier, for the primate of a province, to prostitute his name to vul∣gar mouths, would be highly unbecoming, would greatly eclipse the honours of your elevated station. "But worthy, sir, returned he, you know this is a very censorious world in which we live, and some people may be wicked enough to suppose, that such a title as, his grace, does not so well become a man whose breath is in his nostrils, and I may be censured as ambitious." I hope, my lord, replied I, you will not meditate too much on the gloomy subject of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lity, or that will make your dignity cumbersome indeed. Honours fade, sir, on the prospect of the grave. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to your being censured as proud and ambitious, I hold the con∣trary; it will be deemed essential to your high estate, and the use of the bible being prohibited, the laity will not know but your order is of apostolical institution. Besides, there is my lord duke enjoys the same title of address with your grace; so that instead of being censured as proud and anti∣christian, all ranks of people will revere you the more for it; especially, as it will make you a fit companion for princes. The nobility will consider you as their superior, in as much as a spiritual duke is superior to a temporal, so that in the church your seat will be next to the cardinals, and in the
<PB N="257" REF="027249_0255_0FD3ECD6F225AD50"/>senate-house, next to the prince himself. The gentry will faun upon you spaniel-like, in order to obtain preferment for younger sons, and the vulgar will adore you as a demi-god.</P>
<P>I would farther advise you, to lay aside preaching to the vulgar race, and apply yourself wholly to affairs of state; un∣less called to it, may be once in seven years, to preach to the king and his nobles. "Ay, replied the the worthy prelate, but how shall I dispense with the obligations I am under as a bishop, to meditate on these things, to give myself wholly to the ministry of the word and prayer, yea, to be instant in preaching the word in season and out of season?" Oh sir, replied I, you need to be under no concern about that. "Surely, sir, that is the duty of a bishop, replied he." Yes, very true, said I; the duty of bishops, such as were in the apostles days; such bishops as are appointed in the New Testament. But what has that to do with a diocesan bishop or an archbishop, of whom you yourself are the first. There were none of them you know in the apostles days; none ap∣pointed in the word of God. And therefore the laws which bind scriptural bishops to obedience, can have no manner of power over you as diocesans; much less can a metropolitan, such a bishop as the apostles never thought of, be under any such injunctions. Surely your grace must know that a lord bishop, or a gracious metropolitan must have enough to do without preaching the gospel. Yet if these things are not sufficient to remove the scruples of your mind; and you should still have a notion, that preaching is a duty incum∣bent on you, I can put you in a way to satisfy your consci∣ence, without abating any thing of your greatness.</P>
<P>"Pray, sir, be so kind," said he May it please your grace, replied I, it is neither more nor less than to preach by proxy, as people plead their causes in a court of judica∣ture. You know it is the same in effect, whether you preach in person or by proxy, so that your numerous flock have preaching enough.</P>

Farther, with your grace's leave, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not think it becom∣ing your dignity, even to say prayers in your own family. How far beneath the character of such a spiritual dignitaly, to be down on his knees amidst his servants, worshipping his maker? Let me advise you, either to lay aside family worship altogether, or have it performed by a chaplain. This will have two very great advantages attending it. 1. It will save your grace a great deal of hard and unpleasant la∣bour. And 2. It will make your grace's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety to be admir∣ed by the vulgar. Methinks I hear one say to another, "What a good man is my lord, the archbishop? for al∣though he is too high for saying prayers himself; or has got so much that he has no need to pray, he gives a good sala∣ry to Mr. Honeylip duly to perform the offices of religion in his stead,"</P>
<P>All this while, the good archbishop continued absorbed in thought, and awakening as from a trance, he said, with astonishment glowing on his countenance. "Sir, you a∣maze me! So pertinent your counsel, so persuasive your ad∣dress. You have more than half brought me over to your opinion, as my future conduct will testify."</P>
<P>Having succeeded even beyond expectation with his grace the archbishop, I waited immediately on all the diocesans, within the pomifical jurisdiction, and took the most likely measures to bring them over to our interest.</P>
<P N="1">1. I persuaded them, as I had done the archbishop be∣fore them, that the worldly grandeur with which I and his holiness had invested them, was certainly too heavy a bur∣den for them, to be able to ascend the pulpit stairs, above once or twice a year; and that even then it ought not to be to preach to an ordinary congregation.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they might discharge their duty, to the souls with∣in their respective dioceses, by providing vicars to watch over them in their stead, in their several parishes or divi∣sions, that they might freely spend their time either at the

<P>Having secured both orders of popish bishops, I took care to establish deans, abbots, monks, friars, vicars, chaunters, prebendaries, canons, minor canons, &amp;c. &amp;c. From thence I proceeded to persuade the higher orders of clergy, to encourage plurality of livings, well knowing that if a country vicar could but procure a fat and fruitful be∣nefice, he would even imitate his betters, and preach as lit∣tle as possible. I have often with great pleasure observed, that if a benefice exceed two hundred pounds per annum, the poor vicar who enjoys it, finds himself very unable to preach, and is therefore obliged to hire a journeyman, to whom he leaves the bulk of his business. By these means we got curates introduced into the church; a set of gentle∣men sold to slavery and inured to poverty, not for want of parts and learning, nor always for want of piety, but for want of what is far more necessary to preferment, a pa∣tron▪ A journeyman weaver, watch-maker, or cabinet∣maker, can afford a better table than many a gentleman, who lacks nothing but a patron, to make him equal to the very first of bishops.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="027249_0258_0FD3ECDD596BD7D0"/>
Happily it just answered our desire, and was not long before a sharp conflict between the vicars and curates ensued; as it is not without a vein of drollery, I shall give you a sketch of it. There was a certain vicar, who having ob∣tained a living of about 800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, called his curate to him one day, and thus addressed him: "Mr. Curate, I am now in a station which will admit but of little preaching; I must therefore get you to take that part of the service principally upon yourself; I am under the necessity of visit∣ing the neighbouring gentlemen, and assisting them in their polite amusements, as has been the custom of my predeces∣sors for time immemorial; so that little of my time can be devoted to preaching or praying, and less still to study and contemplation." Mr. Curate replied, "Indeed, Sir, I am but a poor bireling, whose scanty allowance is no way ade∣quate to labours so extensive. I am resolved, sir, to mea∣sure my services by my annual salary." The vicar's bene∣fice being sufficient to raise him above preaching, and the curate's allowance so small, that he could not afford to preach much, it so fell out between vicar and curate, that the pa∣rishioners could not obtain above twenty minutes preaching weekly, in return for their tythes, many dues and offerings. This you know was greatly to our advantage.</P>
<P>Another instance of altercation, between the vicar and curate, I well remember, which also was decided in our fa∣vour. "Hark you Mr. Curate, (said a certain vicar one day to his journeyman) I expect you shall take the care of all the souls within my parish, upon yourself; as I have much business of a very different nature on my hands." "I take the care of them, sir, (replied his curateship) what have I to do with them? I shall take no care of them, I as∣sure you." "Well, but Mr. Curate, said the vicar, I hired you on purpose that you should take the care of them off from me." "Indeed, sir, rejoined the curate, I will not, I am resolved; do you think that for the scanty allowance of twelve shillings per week, I will put my own soul in the
<PB N="261" REF="027249_0259_0FD3ECDD5D652D50"/>place of your parishioners! No, sir, let him take the care of them, who is best paid for so doing." "Then, said the vicar, let my lord bishop take care of them, for he is better paid than either vicar or curate." By these means the parishioners may go to heaven or hell, as most suits their inclination, provided always the fees are punctually paid.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, father, I really think those curates were in the right; for as they receive but journeyman's wages for doing the drudgery of the business, it is unreasonable to de∣sire more than journey man's labour from them. If they per∣form the more servile parts of the office, for their scanty allowance, it seems but meet the vicars, who receive the far greatest part of the profits, should take the burthen of souls upon themselves. If I am not greatly mistaken, the far greater part of mankind, the vicars and high-priests alone excepted, are of the same opinion with me and the curate. However, that was all in the days of popery, and the church of England, hath since been blessed with a great reformation.</P>

<P>It has so, Impiator, and been deformed again, al∣most far enough.

<P>This important point was in a great measure carried, by fixing their attention inordinately upon tradition, and kind∣ling relentings in the bosom of many a gownsman, towards the old scarlet lady, whose government had been rejected. So, that by degrees I drew them to take council, as former∣ly, from the wife Infidelis; one particular instance of which I shall give you, if you think it will not too long detain you from necessary business.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE XVI. FASTOSUS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we parted yesterday, you mentioned some par∣ticular instance of the clergy seeking to you for di∣rection, brother; will it please you to relate it to us now?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only a little confabulation I had with my good friend, parson Out-and-in. The case was this: I set out one morning for Rome, to remove some scruples which in∣fested the mind of his holiness, the father of the world; but passing by parson Out-and-in's garden, I beheld the re∣verend gentleman in his morning gown and velvet cap, walk∣ing slow and pensive, to all appearance in a dejected manner. Charity bid me stop and relieve the thoughtful divine. At her command I stopped, and called: So—ho, Mr. Out-and∣in; how do you do? The good gentleman awaking as from a trance, erected his body into a perpendicular posture, push∣ed up the snout of his cap from over his eyes, and finding it was me who called, instantly replied. "O my good friend, Ratio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lis! (for that is the name by which I am known by the clergy of all denominations) am I so happy as to meet with you, in this so difficult season? I pray you, most honourable tutor, be pleased to stop and give me your advice."</P>
<P>I went to him, and thus the old Levite began. "Most truly, noble, and intelligent sir, I and my brethren, the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuine children of learning and science, have long been much grieved at the rapid progress of fanaticism, which now prevails amazingly over the people; so prevalent is it, sir, that fanatical preachers are more followed, more esteem∣ed than we, the votaries of almighty reason. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> days, sir, there are some, who in a frantic manner decry the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣ble powers of the human soul, which we esteem to be almost divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who preach salvation, by what they call the righte∣ousness
<PB N="263" REF="027249_0261_0FD3ECE043E61BA0"/>of Christ, contrary to the instructions which we re∣ceive from that illumitration which thou hast given us. We have long been studying how to suppress this fanaticism, and to promote the more consistent doctrine of salvation by our own works, and the liberty and freedom of our own will to perform perfect righteousness. It is intolerable, sir, to hear men of virtue and piety, placed on a level with vile publicans and sinners, who know not the law, and are therefore accursed. Impious in the highest degree, to sup∣pose that the benevolent Deity will not reward our good en∣deavours to please him, by working out our own salvation, without trusting in the righteousness of another."</P>
<P>To be sure, said I, to gentlemen of virtue and goodness, it must be very mortifying to submit to be levelled with those who work not, but believe in him who justifieth the ungodly. Very trying, indeed, to own one's self to be an hell-deserv∣ing sinner, when your own reason bears witness, that you deserve the inestimable blessings of everlasting happiness, for your own personal goodness. What man of virtue and moral goodness, what gentleman of a clear head and good heart, like yourself, can bear to be told, that harlots and publicans shall enter the kingdom of heaven sooner than you? I wonder not, my worthy sir, that the preaching of salvation by the works of another, should be a stone of perpetual stum∣bling, and a rock of invincible offence to you. And this offence will never be removed, till we can so manage it, that this same book called Scripture, is made to truckle to the more consistent dictates of human reason; by which a∣lone the authenticity of doctrine ought to be attested, inde∣pondently of any records whatever, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P>I myself have beheld the preaching of the cross of Christ, with a great deal of uneasiness; but for seeing the self-righteous Jews break their bones by stumbling upon it, and the wise philosophic Grecians turning merry-andrews, and laughing at it as soolishness, I should certainly have sunk into despair: because I was unhappy enough to see it prove
<PB N="264" REF="027249_0262_0FD3ECE596C63B10"/>both the power of God, and the wisdom of God, to those who felt themselves actually in a perishing condition. But my good Mr. Out-and-in, permit me to tell you, that whatever pain I endure on account of a preached gospel, I can do nothing that will effectually prevent it, without the concurrence of the clergy. By the way, let me not so much as hint any defection of the clergy. No, sir, I thank my auspicious stars, by far the greatest part of them are upon the right side of the question. There are but few, very few, who preach those enthusiastic doctrines, with which the articles, homilies, and rubric are stuffed; very few who concern themselves about what is, or what is not, the doctrine of the bible.</P>
<P>But, to the matter of your troubles, sir, I apprehend they may be reduced to these two heads only: To suppress the growth of fanaticism on the one hand, and secure to yourselves the patrimony of the church on the other. "These are all, returned he, if we can but accomplish these, we desire no more." Then, sir, if no more is aim∣ed at, I shall put you in a way by which you may-accom∣plish them.</P>
<P>Observe me then, my good friend Mr. Out-and-in, the first thing to be done, is, to draw as thick a vail as possible over the personal excellencies, grace, and righteousness of Immanuel; for these, wherever they are preached, have a tendency to eclipse all human glory, and greatly to dimi∣nish the profits of the altar; which you know are the prin∣cipal things that ought to be advanced. The holy trade of priestcraft can never prosper, but in proportion to your de∣parture from the doctrine of the cross. Yet this must be done with caution, lest the eyes of the people should be open∣ed, and the propagation of your rational religion be pre∣vented. The important question then is, "How you may retain the character and authority of Christ's ambassadors, whilst at the same time you are labouring to extirpate the doctrine of salvation by his blood, from the rational world;
<PB N="265" REF="027249_0263_0FD3ECE95037E2D0"/>as you cannot expect to be so much regarded by the people, if ever you lose your claim to ambassadorship. Of this there∣fore you must be very cautious, and by no means declare yourselves avowed enemies to the gospel in so many express words.</P>
<P>No, sir, you must find out the most glorious names which possibly can be ascribed to the Son of God, yet such names as do not imply his personal divinity; these would spoil your scheme, and therefore must be rejected. For instance, you must not call him Immanuel, the mighty God, the ever∣lasting Father, God manifested in the flesh, Jesus Christ, yesterday, to day and for-ever the same; Alpha and Omega, &amp;c. &amp;c. These and such like names must absolutely be laid aside, for they make directly against the rational scheme. On the other hand, you must be equally careful not to speak slightly of his person, name, and authority, by barefacedly calling him, but a man like yourselves, as Doctor Priestley has precipitately done; and by so doing betrayed the cause of rational religion into the hands of the orthodox, to be mangled and tortured after the manner of that wicked Shaver. In short you must consider, that the people are not all rational alike, and therefore a downright denial of the Godhead of Christ may be attended with very serious con∣sequences. Some people are sirmly attached to the Athana∣sian creed, merely out of deference to the judgment of their ancestors; and others are as firmly attached to the scrip∣tures, from an inward conviction of their divine propriety; so that without the greatest care you may be baffled in your very first attempts to promulgate your rational religion.</P>
<P>In short, sir, notwithstanding you believe him to be but man like yourself, or at most but a dignified creature, you must of necessity, for fear of the populace, give him a kind of suffragan deity or deputed Godhead, like that of Mars or Mercury, in the pagan theology. Your friend Mr. Whis∣ton, a man of deep intelligence, has shewn you what may
<PB N="266" REF="027249_0264_0FD3ECE954333808"/>be done in this way; do you, my good Mr. Out-and-in, imitate the same Homer-like minister
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Homer-like minister. Homer was a wonderful creator of gods and goddesses, and so was Mr. Whiston, from his own account of the Trinity, which he makes to consist of one uncre∣ated, and two created Gods.</NOTE>. To be more par∣ticular, you must never omit when you speak of him, to use great and swelling words of seeming respect, as if you had the most profound veneration for his person; call him the only Son of the most high God—the first-born, and most exalted of creatures—a being far above men and angels— under God, the great dispenser of all things, both in earth and heaven. Not a syllable of his measuring the seas in the hollow of his hand; of his meting out heaven with the span; of his comprehending the dust of the earth in a measure; weighing the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance; or of his taking up the isles as a very little thing. That is a description of Jesus, most adverse to what you would have thought to be rational religion, which considers him as no more than a man like yourselves; it is good therefore that such descriptions should never be quoted. By keeping close to those appellations which are proper to him, only as man and mediator, you will vail his real personal dignity, and in time your audience will quite forget all their old orthodox notions, concerning the proper deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, which at present are so very offensive to you and your brethren.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you happen to hear of any man, who is a zea∣lous and diligent preacher of Christ crucified, as the only foundation of the sinner's hope, you must look to it that something be speedily done, to prevent his success, for such a man is capable of being very injurious to us and our ra∣tional religion. His followers will consider you as no better than birelings, mercenary priests, and enemies to the gos∣pel of salvation. Therefore you must, but always with the greatest art, attack his character. Stigmatize him with
<PB N="267" REF="027249_0265_0FD3ECEBEC64D288"/>such names of reproach as you think will be most likely to take with the vulgar. However you must be aware of touching his moral character, for that will be like the body of Achilles, invulnerable even to malice itself. His religi∣ous character, because less understood by the common peo∣ple, will be more easily injured, and therefore the most proper object of your attacks.</P>
<P>You may call him an enthusiast, which is a name under∣stood by very few; therefore the greatest part of the people will consider him as some outlandish monste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and avoid him as they would shun the path of a crocodile. Or you may call him a methodist; this also is a name well calculated to excite popular abhorrence, as you know many would rather choose to be papists than methodists. Or you may call him an anabaptist, or fanatic. In short you may dress him in what names you think will most effectually stir up the peo∣ple to bait him as they would do a bull or a bear from the forest; and so far as your influence goes, you may totally prevent his usefulness; which you know will be a great ser∣vice done to the devil, and to rational religion.</P>
<P>But my good Mr. Out-and-in, take care that you be not too bare-saced in your slanders, as Doctor Priestely has been in his against the orthodox dissenters. His zeal for rational religion is so furious, that it prompted him to rend the dis∣guise, which ought by all means to have concealed his im∣placable hatred of the orthodox. This however he has thought proper to discover in such a manner, that his word in a way of slander, will now scarcely be taken by any bo∣dy, so that even the rationals themselves are ashamed of his rashness. But you, my friend, may avail yourself of his miscarriage, and avoid the rock upon which he foundered un∣der full sail, by considering that, amongst the laity there are always to be found a discerning few, whose penetration may be too keen for a flimsy disguise. Now, should your ma∣lice be detected, your very reproaches would bring him proselytes, as in the case of Dr. Trapp, of crabbed memory,
<PB N="268" REF="027249_0266_0FD3ED05C54B1270"/>and the late Mr. Whitefield, Therefore let all your re∣proaches seem to flow rather from pity than malice. Do not fail to commend something of the good that is in him; this will be an excellent cloke, from under which you may with the greater freedom shoot your arrows of calumny. For example, when his name is mentioned in company, you may say, "He is a good sort of man, I believe; but I am sorry for him, poor man, he hath imbibed sad enthusi∣astic principles. The poor weak, well meaning man would do good if he could, I believe, but is sadly led away by me∣thodistical notions." Sir, there are a thousand ways of vending scandal with seeming pity, which some people are perfect masters of; but your divines are too warm, and therefore their arrows fall to the ground before they inflict any wound at all.</P>
<P>I have known an important minister ere now, ruin the reputation of his neighbour with less then ten words speak∣ing, and those too seemingly spoken in much pity. Oh sir, there requites great art in scandalizing to purpose. Nothing gives such a point to the arrow of scandal, as a seeming concern for the welfare of the party whom you want to ruin. I could recommend you to certain gentlemen in great estimation for religion and virtue, as the most accomplished in this necessary art, did not I know that you disdain to learn from any inferior to myself.</P>
<P N="3">3. If you would invalidate the doctrine of imputed righte∣ousness, you must begin just here, and proceed in the fol∣lowing manner. That it is a doctrine which must be brought into contempt, as you would wish to preserve the honour of the creature, is clear to a demonstration; seeing, when∣ever a man is brought cordially to embrace it, his looks, Irowever lofty before, are brought down, and he lies at the feet of Jesus, as a perishing and lost sinner; which you know is inconsistent with the dignity of a philosopher, or a ration∣al Christian.</P>
<P>You must, my worthy Mr. Out-and-in, you must indeed,
<PB N="269" REF="027249_0267_0FD3ECEBF19DA900"/>declare that man having received no damage at all by the fall of Adam, and coming into the world in perfect inno∣cence, is capable of having a righteousness of his own, which will justify him before an infinitely holy God. "Ay, but Mr. Rationalis, said he, how shall I manage in this, see∣ing there are so many plain passages of scripture which con∣tradict me?" Do, my good friend! You must not mind that, if you intend to be a rational preacher. You must shew yourself a man, and leap over them, as many have done before you. Imitate the zealous Dr. Priestley, and like him, tell your hearers, that the scriptures do not mean what they say
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Familiar illustration of certain texts, &amp;c.</NOTE>. What man of reason would regard a few adverse texts of scripture, when the dignity of human na∣ture is the subject in question?</P>
<P>For your encouragement, permit me to assure you, that, however adverse the scriptures may be to your rational doc∣trine, the populace will be very propitious.</P>
<P>You can never please men so well as by clapping them on the shoulders, telling them their hearts are good, that they need not doubt of getting safe to heaven, whether they believe in the Son of God or not. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engage, sir, your auditory will caress you for the sake of your pleasing doc∣trine.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the Holy Ghost, I would not have you abso∣lutely refrain from mentioning him and his assisting influ∣ence, because your people read of him in your church litur∣gy so very often. But be sure roundly to assert, that it is mere enthusiasm for a man to expect to receive the Holy Ghost in these days; and let them solve the difficulty, how the thoughts of a man's heart can be cleansed by the inspira∣tion of the Holy Ghost, whom they cannot receive, as they shall find opportunity. It seems I proved as a kind of re∣membrancer here, for he stopped me short, and said, "Let me see—I think I should remember something about the
<PB N="270" REF="027249_0268_0FD3ED0C17A5D928"/>Holy Ghost somewhere—Hum—If I mistake not, it was relating to the office of ordination."</P>
<P>Yes, sir, said I, it was; you only professed to my lord bishop, that you were moved by the Holy Ghost to take up∣on you the office of a deacon. That was all, sir. He re∣plied: "I believe it was some such thing. But pray, sir, was it rational in me, so to do, seeing I did not then be∣lieve that any man receives the moving influences of the Holy Ghost in these times?" Surely, said I, it was. You know, sir, no man can get a benefice without it in your way, and I pray you, who would not do as much as that for a good living? Why should you have any scruple of consci∣ence, seeing you have got some hundreds a year by it? I know many, very many, who did the same, sir, who can hardly procure thirty pounds per annum. On my word you sold your conscience well. But for those sons of science, they foolishly threw theirs away without the prospect of any comfortable return. I assure you, a journeyman weaver can afford a better table, than many a clergyman of the rank of curate.</P>
<P N="5">5. Once more; as the works of the Saviour of mankind must not be wholly omitted; should you be asked, What Jesus did for his people? You must answer, as it were in a rapture: "O! he hath done great things for us. He de∣scended from the heavenly glories, and assumed our nature. He hath abrogated the severity of the old, and introduced a new and milder law; lived agreeable to the precepts of it himself, and when his instructions were finished, he con∣firmed us in his ways, and sealed the truth of his doctrine with his own precious blood." Thus, my friend, you may, by good management, if grace prevent not, deceive the ve∣ry elect. Tears of thankfulness trickled down the old gen∣man's beard, he gave me most hearty thanks, and protest∣ed that no instructions could be more agreeable to the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tates of his own reason.</P>

<P>O sir, replied I, we shall fit you in that in the most agreeable manner; then to the article of faith in the great God, add, "I believe in Jesus Christ as a mere man like ourselves, yet pious and holy. A man sent of God, as a great teacher, whose business in life was to introduce a new mild law, commonly called the gospel; because God had altered his mind respecting the salvation of mankind, since his giving of the old law, which upon examination, and long experience, was found to be too strict and severe, consequently unjust and fit for abolition. Wherefore he raised up this same Jesus Christ, a man like ourselves, and sent him to correct the errors which infinite wisdom had fallen into, in giving what we call the moral law. I be∣lieve, that when he obtained a perfect correct copy, he taught it to mankind, and called it the new law, or the gospel. I believe that this good man actually did make such correc∣tions, alterations and amendments in the moral law as he saw meet, notwithstanding he positively declared, that "although heaven and earth should both pass away, not one jot or tittle of the old law should fail, i. e. be super∣ceded by any other law whatever. I believe that Jesus Christ, this good man like ourselves, having rendered the old law a perfect system, and having taught it in its puri∣fied state, died to confirm the truth of his doctrine, just as Cranmer and other good men have done since then. I be∣lieve farther, that he continued under the power of death for three days, and then was raised from the dead, to shew that he was no imposter, but was actually commissioned to amend the old law, which, prior to his correction, was
<PB N="273" REF="027249_0271_0FD3ECEE9DA07130"/>neither holy, just, nor good, as the mistaken apostle thought it to be. Farther still, I believe that in his exalted state he is, as good Dr. Priestley observes, only a man like ourselves, notwithstanding the orthodox ignorantly worship him as Immanuel, God with them; God manifested in the flesh; the true God and eternal life; the Alpha and Omega; the first and the last; and I know not what enthusiastic titles, such as that book called the bible ascribe to Jesus of Naza∣reth.</P>
<P>Concerning the original state of man, I believe, that A∣dam did not beget his children in the likeness which he him∣self bore, at the time of their being begotten, but in the likeness which he bore before he had sinned; that although the fountain became polluted, the streams continue pure and limpid; and although the root was depraved by transgression, the branches and fruit are holy and innocent. So that there is no such thing as orginal sin in any sense; nor have the posterity of Adam any share in the guilt of his transgression. And whereas, the death of infants is frequently alledged by fanatics, and orthodox Christians as a proof of original sin. I do must rationally believe concerning those that die in in∣fancy, that either God in an arbitrary unjust manner mur∣ders them without cause; or that their death is occasioned by some sin of their own, committed either whilst they were in the womb, or before they had being; for no man can die for the sins of another, says your oracle, and yet it is clear that infants do die.</P>
<P>Moreover, I believe that every man is possest of power, to justify himself by the deeds of the law, and to procure salvation by his own willing and running, contrary to the opinion of Paul, and the rest of the orthodox; that salva∣tion is obtained by works of righteousness of our own per∣forming, and not by the obedience and death of any person whatever; that the glory of our salvation shall redound to the absolute mercy of God, and our own good endeavours to obtain it; and not unto Christ, whom the orthodox en∣thusiastically
<PB N="274" REF="027249_0272_0FD3ED0D48E09540"/>say, has loved them, and washed them in his blood, by which he has redeemed them to God out of every nation, kindred, people, tongue and language."</P>
<P>This creed being cordially received by my votaries, I laughed in my sleeve, and said, A fig for you all my ene∣mies; Goodwin, Charnock, Owen and Crisp, &amp;c. &amp;c. where are you now?

These men are gone forth upon my business; with a commission from me, your father, to counteract a preached gospel, and as much as may be to sap its foundation doctrines. Now, my son, in order to be useful to me, it is highly necessary they should bear the appear∣ance of the strictest sanctity, and be not any wise defective in tithing annise, mint, and cummin, or how can they impose the cheat upon mankind with success? Whereas, the appearance of devotion and sanctity, will give energy to their arguments, and greatly recommend their doctrine; there is no beating it out of the heads, even of the most ig∣norant, that there is such a thing as devotion and sanctity, inseparably connected with religion.</P>
<P>Now, my son, thou are but a purblind devil, and at best precipitate, therefore thou may'st overturn my well concert∣ed scheme. I charge thee therefore, Impiator, as thou wish∣est well to our mal-administration, that thou shalt refrain from tempting these men into any of thine openly, notori∣ous ways, and to leave them entirely to my government; for they cannot miscarry whilst I have the pleasure of reign∣ing in their hearts.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you consider then. They tell their hearers, that Immanuel is to more than a dignified creature, who has no personal claim to the essential properties of true and absolute divinity, notwithstanding many of them pay divine honours to his name. Now, my son, the worship of a
<PB N="276" REF="027249_0274_0FD3ED0F17E8AAA0"/>creature how dignified soever, is by all allowed to be mere idolatry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They deny the charge of Idolatry, brother, by alledging, that they offer to Immanuel, only an inferior worship suited to the inferiority of his person as a created being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very thing, in which their idolatry consists, and is on a level with that of the ancient pagans. It was an inferior kind of adoration, which the antients paid to their heroes and common Deities, in comparison of that, which they offered to Jupiter their great God, the supposed king and father of all the rest. Mars and Mercury, for instance, were never considered as supreme, but as acting under the direction and delegation of Jupiter; as such, and such on∣ly they were adored and worshiped; so that to distinguish between the worship of the Father as supreme, and that of his Son, as inferior and subordinate, instead of exculpating them from the charge of idolatry, doth actually enforce it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to clear themselves from the charge of idola∣try they alledge farther, sir, the command of God himself, for their worshipping the Son, notwithstanding his inferiori∣ty. The great God, say they, hath given command that all the angels of God should worship him, and that all men should honour him; shall then our obedience draw upon us the reproach of idolatry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they say. But if they knew the scriptures, only half as well as you and me, who have laboured all our days to cloud their evidence, they would see that these com∣mands, instead of exculpating them from, do actually bring home the charge of idolatry upon them. God hath express∣ly commanded, that, "Mankind shall have no other Gods before him," as objects of religious adoration, either by office or otherwise: And he would hardly have himself in∣troduced another, of a different nature, and commanded all men to worship him; seeing in this case, one command would have clashed with the other. This would have been
<PB N="277" REF="027249_0275_0FD3ECF18218C9F8"/>the spring of wild confusion, and everlasting uncertainty; for the two commands being diametrically opposite, no man could ever have known which of the two might be obeyed with safety.</P>
<P>Would we but suffer them to reflect upon the divine com∣mands, they must unavoidably see, that their worshipping of the Son of God, as merely delegated, with an inferior kind of worship, is absolute idolatry. When the first be∣gotten was brought into the world it was said, "Let all the angels of God worship him," which they accordingly did at his birth. When he revealed himself to Israel, the Father gave command, that "All men should honour the Son, even as they honoured the Father." That is with the self-same honour, as is paid to the Father, on the founda∣tion of his being one (in essence) with the Father. Where∣as had the Father ordained divine honours, to be paid to any being of a different essence from himself, he would not only have overturned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st commandment, "Thou shalt have no other Gods before me," but have given his glory to another, contrary to his own express declaration. I would not therefore have those sons of superior reason think it at all strange, if at last they shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves ranked with idolaters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, father, if I mistake not, you said, that with them paganism is brought to as great perfection as ever it arrived at in the Roman pantheon. How is that, sir? Seeing they are rational Christians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my son, they call themselves rational Christi∣ans, because they believe and teach, "That the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wisdom may know the Almighty," and adorn their ha∣rangues with words, which mens wisdom teacheth; but they are pagans, notwithstanding, as will appear what you con∣sider, that they worship more Gods than one. Arians and Socinians both agree to worship one, whom they say is tru∣ly and essentially God, and the king and Father of the o∣ther
<PB N="278" REF="027249_0276_0FD3ED1052FF3478"/>Deities. Besides this object of supreme adoration they have other two, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, whom they honour with inferior adoration, just as the ancients did the common Deities. I suppose, gentlemen, you will allow th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the worship of two or three objects of different ranks, is as real paganism, as the worship of so many hundreds: but I choose to distinguish the moderns from others, by the name of Christian pagans, because they allow Jesus Christ to be one of their secondary Deities. I am greatly obliged to you, my brother Fastosus, for your assistance so kindly given, to enable me to accomplish my purposes; without it I could not have brought my affairs to their present happy situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, brother, you could not; but you are at all times welcome to my assistance, in counteracting the sim∣plicity of gospel truth. I myself should greatly suffer, were the Arians and Socinians to discover what part we have in their rational religion; and I am not without my fears that the incapacity of the preacher for making proselytes, the dwindling away of their congregations, and the contempt in which they are in general held, will in time convince them, "That the world by wisdom knew not God," and so bring them to change their present system of rational religion for that of the cross of Jesus, which is truly rational, and en∣nobles every reasoning power of the human soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my sire! What a subtile spirit are you? With what laudible craftiness must you have acted, to succeed in introducing pagan idolatry amongst modern divines, even amongst protestant dissenters. I have long known, that the papists are pagans in disgnise, but had no thought of ration∣al Christians being so far in alliance with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DISC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pagans in disguise, cousin! What do you mean? There is no mistery at all in your father's doctrine; nor is there much difference between the ancient pagans, and mo∣dern papists. The principal difference is this, The popish Juno, whom they call the mother of God, is far greater in power, and more exalted in glory, than the wife of Jupiter
<PB N="279" REF="027249_0277_0FD3ECF326A737C8"/>the pagan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> acted in all things su∣bordinate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> will of her husband, the king and father of the gods, who bore absolute sway over the heavenly synod: but the popish Jupiter acts in subordination to the will of his virgin mother. He rules the creation indeed; but then he is still subject to maternal direction; so that it is not God the saviour of sinners, but the virgin Mary, the pop∣ish Juno, who possesses absolute sovereignty, and what good they expect at the hand of God, is expected as to be done in obedience to his virgin mother.</P>
<P>In all other things there is little or no disparity between the ancient and modern pantheon worship. The pagans worshipped angels, whom they called gods, the papists wor∣ship them also, knowing them to be creatures. The first had their heroes and heroines whom they adored under the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>migods; the latter also have their heroes and heroines, whom they worship under the name of saints. The ancients had their ambiguous oracles and lying won∣ders, and the moderns have both, in far greater abundance; so that he must be blind indeed, who does not see amongst them undisguised paganism.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it must follow, that the papists are greater friends to my father Infidelis, than the Arians and Socini∣ans, because these bear something of the appearance of truth; but those have cast off both truth and its appearance.</P>

<P>That is your wisdom again, my son. Impiator would make but a blundering minister of state in my court, gen∣tlemen. But my son, you may know, it is with us a max∣im of policy, that "Whoever comes nearest the truth, and is notwithstanding destitute of it, is always capable of doing the most essential service to my interest." Popish pa∣ganism is by far too barefaced to succeed in England, where its absurdities have been so long detected. English pro∣testants will not worship a god of the bakers making, whilst their women retain the art of making good plumb pudding, which will at any time be preferred to the sacramental <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="280" REF="027249_0278_0FD3ED11C96CB840"/>for. But Arian and Socinian paganism is so subtilly invent∣ed, and so well refined, that it passeth with many for ra∣tional Christianity.</P>

<P>I have somewhere seen a map of that part of your dominions, brother, where the idolaters dwell; if you have got one about you, I should be glad to have a description of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INFID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, sir, and am glad it is in my power to gratify my much honoured brother.—You see, sir, it is divided into two grand provinces, each inhabited by dif∣ferent sects of idol-worshippers. That province on the left contains the various sects of civil idolaters, and this on the right contains the many denominations of their elder bre∣thren, the religions idolaters. And I assure you, they are two bodies of people very respectable.</P>
<P>The province which contains the civil idolaters, is di∣vided into several counties, all of which are very populous. In the first county live the worshippers of vain pleasure,
<PB N="281" REF="027249_0279_0FD3ECF6BA8BCEE8"/>and this county is divided into several regalities, in which the several sects or denominations of idolaters dwell, accond∣ing to the diversity of their inclinations. The first regality is appointed to the worshippers of living creatures. This swarms with jockies, and gamblers of the turf, both of no∣ble and ignoble extraction. Along with them live the wor∣shippers of foxes, hares, and hounds, a very jolly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce, I assure you, well skilled in the literature of the kennel. But it is better to be a slaye in a Turkish galley, than held as a divinity in this regality, for adoration never fails to pro∣cure torture to the idol; as the panting of the hare, and the well ploughed sides of the horse sufficiently demonstrate. A little nook of this regality is by royal mandate made over to sterile wives and maiden ladies, who for want of more agreeable objects of adoration, worship monkies, parrors, and lap-dogs. The second regality is the habitation of those who worship the dramatic poets, and their apes the players. At the shrines of those idols, the worshippers sacrifice health and virtue, under pretence of learning wisdom. They are very fashionable and honoured people, with whom legislators and guardians of public virtue are not ashamed to associate. Here you may find legislators patriotically sacri∣flcing their own virtue, in order to protect that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tion; their own estates, in order to assist in public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>onemy; and faithlessly wasting their own time, in order to teach industry to the inferior ranks of subjects.</P>
<P>In the second county, you will find all the worshippers of false honour; a set of gentry extremely divided in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sen∣timents relative to the object of their adoration. One holy father falls down prostrate, like Cardinal Wolsey, before the triple crown and pontifical dignity. A second is equal∣ly devout at the shrine of a cardinal's hat; and a third, less aspiring, pays his devotions to a bishop's mitre or prelatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abes, and the highest of his present ambition is a bishopric.
<PB N="282" REF="027249_0280_0FD3ED13A6A48C30"/>Other reverend gentlemen offer a more humble worship to a dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, prebend, or vicarage.</P>
<P>It is very observable, that in this county people never worship that to which they have already attained; but hav∣ing compassed their purpose, burn incense to the idol next in rank, and thus the worshipper goes on, if death and disap∣pointment do not prevent him, till he has worshipped every shrine in the pantheon.</P>
<P>For instance, whilst a curate, a vicarage is the idol; the vicarage obtained, it gives place to a prehend or deanry; which once enjoyed, they also in their turn give place to a hishopric; that to an archbishopric, which is the principal idol of the English. But in other countries there are idols of superior rank, so that the moment an archbishopric is ob∣rained, incense smokes to a cardinal's hat; which also ob∣tained, loses its worshipper, who is now converted to the worship of the triple crown, the great god and father of all the other idols.</P>
<P>Nor are the laity less devout than their reverend brethren, for one man worships universal empire, like Lewis of France and some others; but it is said that George of Britain is an apostate from this religion. Another worships a crown and sceptre, like the descendant of a certain bricklayer; and many adore the place of prime minister, chancellor of the kingdom, first lord of the treasury, with every other place of honour and trust in government. Some you shall see fall prostrate before a star and garter, whilst others are all obedience to a coroner. The husband lies in the dust before "his honour," whilst his wife in raptures adores "her ladyship." His lordship is bended to by one, and another pays all his devo∣tion to his grace.</P>
<P>In this country, you may find some men religious enough to worship a corporal's knot, or a serjeant's halberd. Some worship an ensign's fash, others a lieutenant's commission, whilst the captain is absolutely as much devoted to a regiment, as his colonel is to a nearshal's staff.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="027249_0281_0FD3ECF6C3027648"/>
The third county is the dwelling of those who worship their own bodies, than which, I presume there is not a more ravenous idol in the synod. Around the shrine of this god, stand the baker, brewer, pastry-cook, confectioner, distiller, weaver, and male and female taylors. Hard by are a con∣stellation of the softer sex prostrate before an Indian shrub, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves of which are in great veneration. At no great distance, are a cloud of worshippers of Virginia tobacco; they are divided into no less than four different sects. The first of whom worships the tobacco in the neat leaf cut small, or well rolled together. The second worship it, after it is well ground into flour. The third put it through the fire to the dear sensation. And the fourth are of such a eatholic disposition, that they worship the dearly beloved tobacco in all its forms. Of this sect The LISTNER professes himself.</P>
<P>The belly is worshipped by many, as the principal god, and so profuse are they in their offerings, that its altar is sometimes almost overturned, and the idol greedy as it is, is unable to bear the fruits of their devotion. The sect of glut∣tons, a very devout race, ransack both earth and sea to bring plenty of offerings to the idol; and that of drunkards, in no less devotion, pour on the wines in such profusion, that all the surrounding trenches are gorged to the brim. This same idol differs exceedingly from most other objects of ido∣latrous worship; for when it has swilled to excess in the drink offering, it invites the brain to share in the feast, to which it presents every vapourish effluvia, whilst it reserves for its own use only the parts excrementitous. Moreover, this same belly is apt to resent the profusion of its worship∣pers, and sends forth the bluest plagues, most chilling agues, burning, putrid, and malignant fevers, with all manner of acute and chronical distempers amongst the worshippers, and thus provides employment for gentlemen of the faculty: whose business, positively, would be worse than that of a co∣bler, but for the religion of belly worshipping.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="027249_0282_0FD3ED17761421A8"/>
In the fourth county dwel the worshippers of gold and large possessions, some of whom you shall find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing pro∣strate, in the deepest devotion to a fine well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> house and garden; others worshipping a fortile estate and well stored barns, a flock of fleecy sheep, or an herd of farten∣ing bullocks. One man adores the brace of nags which hurl him from place to place, whilst his friend is prostrate before a splendid retinue. Moidores as well as English coin is a splended idol, and attracts the attention of many, whilst some adore a coal pit, or a mine of leaden ore.</P>
<P>Had I time, I would give you a more full account of the religious idolaters; but as business is urgent, I shall only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouch upon some of their gods. The greatest of which is his holiness the present pope, who dispenseth blessing and cursing, casseth down and exalteth at his pleasure. This god who is exalted above all that is called god, issueth dispen∣sations and pardons, for money and price, contrary to the manner of the God of heaven. The one pardons and gives salvation freely of grace, but the other sells his pardons as dear as he can. Next to his holiness, on the right hand, stands the popish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uno, or virgin Mary, whose powerful command of the God of nature, is greatly adored by every zealous papist. On the left hand stands a Jesus Christ of wood, whom the papists also highly revere; for they are almost to distraction, fond of wooden Deities. Some indeed have a Jesus Christ made of gold or silver, and others more lowly, worship a paper Saviour; but the most humble devo∣tion is paid to the gods which the baker makes. These are the most ravenous idolaters in the whole world, for with the greatest eagerness, and devout veneration they eat the ob∣ject of their adoration. Thousands of these breaden gods are devoured annually, and as soon as devoured they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣placed by others from the sacred ovens. The people, wor∣ship, and service of the true Jesus of Nazareth they abhor and persecute, with as much sury as ever their ancestors the Romish pagans did. But if their own goldsmiths, carvers,
<PB N="285" REF="027249_0283_0FD3ECF71A86D908"/>or statuaries happen to produce a handsome Jesus Christ, or a mother of God, the country will presently wonder after it in the most profound adoration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have sometimes thought, brother, that the po∣pish religion is the religion of Molech inverted. That vo∣racious idol was used to devour the children of his worship∣pers; but here the greedy worshippers devour their god af∣ter he is well baked in an oven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ancient pagans were even foolish enough, in giving their children to that greedy devil, Molech; and the papists are not much wiser in worshipping the works of the artificer, or believing that they can eat their maker. Here are likewise the greatest variety of venerable relicks, such as St. Peter's beard, the ear of St. Francis, the milk of the virgin, with a thousand fooleries besides, all of which are in some sense deified.</P>
<P>Besides these already mentioned, there dwell in this pro∣vince, all who worship their ancestors, which renders the country very populous. I mean those who hold the canons, confessions, and liturgies composed by their ancestors, to be nearly equal to the scriptures in authenticity. Likewise those who are of this or that persuasion, merely because it was the faith of their progenitors, without giving themselves the trouble of searching the scripture to know the truth of the doctrine.

<P>It is true, sir, your son Avaro, hath greatly exceeded my expectations, and proves himself to be an expert devil; he will, I think, do honour to the name of Infidelis, and may greatly contribute to the flourishing state of the kingdom of pride. I should be glad if Avaro might now a little enlarge upon the hints he has already given, that we may further see the prosperity of our general interest.</P>

<SPEAKER>DISC.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be very grateful to me, cousin Avaro, as your fordid and griping influences, have the most happy effect upon the reign of contention. How have I been de∣lighted, when one of your slaves has drop'd into the grave leaving behind him vast possessions, by the discord I have sown amongst his children and kinsfolks. Your slaves dare not think of dying and entering into another world, there∣fore it sometimes happens, that after the muckworm has been by every means, and every kind of rapine, scraping wealth together for many years, he drops into eternity with∣out leaving behind him any authentic direction how his plun∣der is to be disposed of. This gives me a fair opportunity of setting his relations together by the ears, about who shall get most of the miser's effects to himself; and I have the happiness frequently, of planting irreconcileable enmity in the heart of one brother and sister against another, which you know is a comfortable sight to our infernal nobility.</P>
<P>Sometimes the griping miser, that enemy to himself and all mankind, is over persuaded to make his will, though se∣cretly hoping, he shall not die for a great while yet to come; and then the case is very little altered: for when the wretch goes to the place appointed for the covetous, his will is very
<PB N="287" REF="027249_0285_0FD3ECF970AD97F8"/>unsatisfactory to some of the relations; one has too much, and the other has too little left him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disagreeable altercation succeeds the funeral obsequi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and division and everlasting disgust sums up the whole. Unless, indeed, that relation who has two little bequeathed to him, should call in the gentlemen of the law to decide the matter in some court of judicature, and who, having fleeced both the fools as hand∣somely, as the nature of the thing would admit of, refer them at last to an arbitration.</P>
<P>I assure you, consin, I scarcely ever see one of your in∣dustrious slaves, but I flatter a hope of having some employ∣ment in his family on his demise, nor do I know any other real use that the miser's ill gotten money is of to society, be∣sides sowing discord amongst friends and relations. The wretch meanly rob's his own back and belly, as well as all he deals with, to answer purposes no more valuable by his having. But I prevent you, cousin.</P>

<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot easily depart from the tent of the scarlet lady, whose name is mystic Babylon, without making far∣ther honourable mention of her prudent children. The wise disposal of purgatorial fire has been already exemplified, and the dispensation and pardon market has been glanced at; but one way of getting money besides these I shall now instance. I have laid my claim to the popish clergy in general, but of them all, there are none who exceed the worthy lords the inquisitors in veneration of my golden image. This religion of the golden image was first invented by the clergy of Ba∣bylon, and I assure you to this day the clergy of Babylon in∣variably follow it. But the inquisitors of all others, are the most zealous devotees of this golden god, first set up by the parsons of Babylon.</P>
<P>Never did an eagle look out for a dove, nor an hawk for a sparrow, with greater vigilance than their lordships are wont to look out for a prey. If within their jurisdiction there happens to be a stranger, whose circumstances are prosperous, and who is likely to be a good bone for their
<PB N="288" REF="027249_0286_0FD3ED1AE34C8B78"/>reverences to pick; it shall go hard but they will provoke him, by some of their emissaries, to say something against the in∣quisitive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al, which in some countries is deemed the un∣pardonable sin. No sooner has the insinuating priest by in∣direct means obtained matter of accusation, but he makes in∣formation in the holy office, before the fathers, who on hearing the blessed report, are as much delighted as the wolf when he has fanged a prey. The merchant is apprehend∣ed, his estate confiscated; he is immured in the prison cells, till consumed either by famine or vermin, otherwise he is tortured privately to death, by the hands of their sanctified ruffians.</P>
<P>One instance of the many which I might produce, shall serve to exemplify the equity of the inquisitors. When Sy∣racuse was in its glory, there was one Bellarius, a foreign merchant, who in the course of business, had amassed great riches; and who, at the same time, was so circumspect in all his ways, that even the eye of an emissary of the office, could find nothing, of which to accuse him to the tribunal. Thus he lived in reputation and affluence for many years, to the great impatience of the holy inquisitors, who could find no plausable pretence, by which they might fang his substance with their rapacious talons.</P>
<P>Bellarius had an only child, a lady about seventeen. Her person was the perfection of symmetry, and her mind a copy of the purest virtue. By her they found means to accom∣plish their purposes, and bring complicated ruin on the un∣happy parent. The family retired to peaceful repose, were one night alarmed about one in the morning, first by the ap∣proach of a coach, and then by a smart rapping at the gate. Bellarius from within asked, "Who is there?" Was an∣swered, the "holy Inquisition" down stairs he run, flew to the gates in obedience to the dread tribunal, and opened to receive those ministers of darkness. Understanding they were come for his daughter, in farther obedience to those leaders of the church, he went himself up to her chamber
<PB N="289" REF="027249_0287_0FD3ECFB4A98A580"/>brought her down, trembling as she was, and delivered her into the hands of the horrid ravishers, who carried her off to the seraglio in the office of Inquisition. Where, for the present, we leave her, through fear of death seduced from her virtue by those pretended patrons of religion, and re∣turn to the unhappy disconsolate father.</P>

<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, brother, I find then the priests of Rome are not so much addicted to eunuchry as they pretend. 'Tis lawful, it seems, to ravish virgins, however unlawful it may be to have a married wife. I have often heard of the seraglio of princes, but not so often of the seraglio of priests, and those priests too, who of all others are the most zealous wonderers after the seven headed beast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Distressed and comfortless Bellarius remained at home; forsook all company, and conversed only with the various cogitations of his own foreboding mind. At one time he conjectured that his hapless daughter, in some inadver∣tent moment, might have blasphemed other the wooden virgin Mary or the great high priest of Rome, or the holy inquisitors, in which case he gave her up for lost, and doom∣ed her to fall a sacrifice. Yet could he scarcely forgive the rigour of that religion, which had in such a merciless man∣ner ravished her from his fond embrace.</P>
<P>It was not long after this an Armenian merchant, said to be newly arrived in Syracuse, called on him, under pretence of buying a large assortment of goods. Generous and unsus∣pecting Bellarius, bid him welcome to his house during his stay; which he after some seemingly modest apologies thank∣fully accepted. The pretended Armenian perceiving Bella∣rius to eat but little at supper, now and then inadvertently to slip a sigh, took occasion to rally him in a friendly man∣ner, as if troubled with the hyp', advised him to cheer up and hope for better times.</P>
<P>Bellarius having but little relish for a jest, seriously re∣plied, "No, sir, the hyp' is not my present disease, neither
<PB N="290" REF="027249_0288_0FD3ED1AE6729B08"/>have my affairs in trade taken an adverse turn; and yet there is one thing, which gives me great distress." The friendly Armenian was now more importunate to know his grievance, that he might at least sympathize with him in his affliction. Little suspecting that he was conflicting with priestly subtilty, he thought he might safely lodge his cir∣cumstances in the generous bosom of a merchant; he repli∣ed, sir, I suppose you are a stranger in Syracuse; as such let me advise you, as you value your life and liberty, to be careful of your words, and every part of your deportment during your abode, for this is a place of danger. I have, sir, one only daughter, the perfect image of her lovely mother, whom I had the misery to bury but a few months ago. I know not by what temptation, but my poor girl has said something dishonourable either of the lady of Loretto, his holiness the pope, or their lordships the Inquisitors, for which she is imprisoned in the holy office, and I suppose must answer it with her life.</P>
<P>Oh, sir, I hope not, said the Armenian, the lady's youth will interceed for her, and after some gentle admonition, your daughter will be returned to the house of her father.</P>
<P>Ah, sir! rejoined disconsolate Bellarius, I cannot but sear, that her youth and beauty are the greatest enemies and accusers. These are qualities capable of impressing the heart even of an inquisitor. If this is the case, my poor daughter is already either dead or debauched. Or should it happen, that any thing has been alledged against her religi∣ous conduct, there are instruments enow in the Inquisition, and their lordships want not skill to use them; instruments sufficient to make an helpless virgin confess that, which even never entered her thoughts: so that at all events, her death or dishonour is ensured. No, sir, it is not possible for me to hope for better, seeing the least hint thrown out against the Inquisition, is condemned as unpardonable blasphemy.</P>
<P>It was not long after this discourse, before the Armeni∣an feigned a necessity of going out; went straight to the In∣quisition
<PB N="291" REF="027249_0289_0FD3ECFD44286078"/>and made information, being a jesuit disguised as a merchant, and that very night a coach was sent to con∣duct Bellarius to the cells of their dreadful prison. Next day his effects were seized by order of the holy fathers, who now rejoiced that at last they had grasped the long wished for prey. Confined in an abominable cell, he was greatly annoyed by vermin; and being divers times examined by torture, he died with grief for his daughter, who, as she could never freely yield to the loathsome embrace of those murderers, in a few months tired their patience. Then one of the sanctified ruffians, first murdered her, and then burned her to ashes in the dry pan. It is amazing, gentle∣men, to what lengths the lust of money and women will car∣ry men.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, cousin, I think your friends the inqui∣sitors bid fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for equalling the most subtil of our fraternity. Oh, what means of procuring wealth have you taught their reverences of the Romish hierarchy? Selling of dis∣pensations and pardons, begging of money for masses, &amp;c. &amp;c. are profitable articles, and turn to a good account. But if I remember right, you told me a few days since, your vassals are divided into several companies, or communities, and that people of all kingdoms, ranks, and professions, are at this day worshippers of the god Avaro. I should be glad to hear something farther about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did so, sir, and shall be ready farther to oblige you, if to give you a brief view of our corporation which like all other towns corporate, consists of divers companies, will do it. The first of which is that of</P>
<P>The lawyers. A very wise set of gentlemen; who ex∣ceed the children of light in the art of money-getting, as far as any of the inhabitants of our territories; of course they are held in great estimation, as gentlemen of the first intelli∣gence. In our city of Avarice, there is no knowledge deem∣ed of any avail; no conduct accounted virtuous besides that of money getting. He is always the wisest, best, and most
<PB N="292" REF="027249_0290_0FD3ED1D01FC7410"/>virtuous man who best succeeds in the lucrative art, whether in law, or in trade, or otherwise. There was a time you know, when the law was as straight, as clear, as a beam of light, and needed no expounding, so that every man was his own counsellor. But ever since the kings of England were kept prisoners under a guard, lest truth should become familiar to the royal ear, the case has been quite altered; now it is so full of pleas and demurrers, doubts and excep∣tions, &amp;c. that it is a perfect labyrinth; dangerous for an ho∣nest man to enter. For in the lawyers company it is a stand∣ing rule, that, whether the plaintiff or defendent lose the cause, the lawyers on both sides are sure to be considerable gainers. Indeed, it is very seldom, but they manage the matter so, that all parties except themselves are losers, and if he who gains the trial, finds himself in the end to be a lo∣ser, how do you think it must fare with the wretch, against whom the verdict is given? If an houest man has a mind to purchase an estate ever so fairly, and pay for it ever so ho∣nestly, he will find it a difficult matter, so to secure his title, but if any succeeding heir be bred to the law; or heiress be married to a lawyer, he may run a risk of being jostled out of his property, by some knavish quirk in law, without any al∣lowance made either for the estate or its improvements.</P>
<P>Indeed, sir, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>may be said of my faithful disciples, the law∣yers, attornies, bailiffs, &amp;c. that they pay as little regard to truth as the greatest of ourselves. Right and wrong, equity and oppression, are no objects of their regard, providing the case will yield good advantage, and bring large grist to their mill; an instance of this, if you please, gentlemen, I shall give you.</P>
<P>Contumelius was a Yorkshire gentleman, of distinguished birth and ample fortune, but somewhat akin to the mad Ma∣cedonian. His country-seat stood by the side of a lane, through which neighbouring farmers passed with their teams for time immemorial. But so much passing and repassing, of the whistling clowns following their waggous, at last proved
<PB N="293" REF="027249_0291_0FD3ED0025E98930"/>very offensive to the worshipful 'Squire, so that he resolved to remove the intolerable nuisance by blocking up the way. A gate was accordingly put up, and fastened with a padlock, effectually to stop the clownish passengers from passing as be∣fore, and turn them by a way considerably more distant.</P>
<P>As soon as the 'Squire's proceedings reached the ear of Mr. Loveright, a neighbouring farmer, he ordered his wag∣gon to drive directly to the gate, and finding it lock'd, took an axe, which he had brought with him for that purpose, and to the great mortification of 'Squire Contumelius hewed it to pieces. His worship in a rage posted to Mr. Deceitful, a ve∣ry eminent lawyer in the neighbouring town, for his advice. The worthy lawyer, finding this a proper occasion of serv∣ing his own interest, advised the 'Squire to send for a writ, commence an auction against the farmer for his intolerable in∣solence. In a few days the writ was served on Loveright, who immediately waited on lawyer Deceitful, in order if possible to compromise the matter.</P>
<P>He no sooner entered the office, than Mr. Deceitful took him aside and thus addressed him, "I am heartily sorry, my good Mr. Loveright, that I have been in a manner obliged, by his worship Contumelius, to send for a writ against you. But I assure you, sir, in my opinion your side of the ques∣tion is by much the safest, and might I advise you, it would be to stand a trial, and by no means submit to a compromise. Knowing the farmer to be a man of substance and resolution, continued he, there is no bearing with such an insolent treat∣ment. For my own part, Mr. Loveright, I would much ra∣ther you had been my client, on the present occasion, than the giddy 'Squire, but he first applied to me and insisted on my doing what I have done. If you please you may apply to my brother Falshood, who is skilful as any man, and as honest as any lawyer I know. In the mean while, sir, you may depend on me as your real friend, ready to serve you in e∣very thing consistent with my reputation."</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="027249_0292_0FD3ED1E8095E700"/>
As soon as Loveright was departed, Mr. Deceitful took horse, and rode directly to the 'Squire's house; told him the farmer had been with him, heartily repented of his folly, and was very desirous of coming to terms of agreement. But were the case mine, said he, I would listen to no terms of ac∣commodation, but punish his insolence to the utmost rigour of law. The low-life fellow, having got forward in the world, has forgotten himself; and if suffered now to escape with impunity, he will be the pest of the neighbourhood. Thus the worthy lawyer irritated both parties, till he had made sure of an assize hearing, that, in the debate, he might likewise insure to himself a sum very considerable. For he knew very well, that if ever a difference falls into the infa∣tiable maw of the court, it will never be disgorged till all costs of suit are amply paid off; for it is impossible for my mercenary scribblers to give any credit. Let them act just∣ly or unjustly, they make sure of their fees; and as the one party must necessarily lose, both counsellor and attorney, take care to father the miscarriage of the cause, on something which the client has done, which he ought not; or omit∣ted, which he ought to have done: and not withstanding all their fraud and deceit, both of them come off good honest lawyers. The</P>
<P>II. Company, and next in reputation to that of the law∣yers, is the parsons company, which is also very flourishing and reverend. That you may not mistake my meaning; by parsons I intend all in general, of every denomination, who are ministers merely for the sake of a living; more especially.</P>
<P N="1">1. All who profess to my lord bishop, that they are mov∣ed by the Holy Ghost to take upon them the office of a dea∣con, when in reality it is the hope of a benefice, by which they are stimulated; and who afterwards, in the course of their pulpiteering, tell the people that it is enthusiasm in any person, to expect to receive the Holy Ghost in these days.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="295" REF="027249_0293_0FD3ED014ED466E8"/>
2. All who, sustaining the sacerdotal character, lead men into sin, or harden those who are insensible, either by con∣niving at the sins of their people, or by being guilty of the like themselves. These gentlemen are pretty numerous.</P>
<P N="3">3. All who act rigorously towards their parishioners, in regard to temporal things, who evidently shew more con∣cern about tithes and offerings, than about the everlasting welfare of their people.</P>
<P N="4">4. All in holy orders who, through covetousness, idleness, or any other unjustifiable cause, with-hold from their peo∣ple, the stated ministration of the word and ordinances. Set a mark upon them, for they are all my disciples.</P>
<P N="5">5. Wherever you meet with a gentleman in holy orders, who is so far above the bulk of his auditory, that he will not condescend to converse even with the meanest, about the state of his soul, the work of the Spirit and way of sal∣vation, such are idol shepherds, unnatural pastors, and alto∣gether devoted to the god Avaro.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, cousin, I find you have parsons of more denominations than one; they are not all engrossed by the established churches in England and on the continent it seems. Yet I meet with many who with great warmth will vindi∣cate their own denomination by wholesale, and deem it little less than blasphemy, to suppose that they embrace any thing erroneous. Yet none more ready to censure, and con∣demn those who are of a different persuasion in religious things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth is, my parsons are scattered abroad, among all sects of professors; for the time is not yet come, that any one sect can justly assert, that none of their mini∣sters have any other object in view but the glory of God, and the good of mankind. Nor will the time commence, before that important question, "who shall be the greatest;" is finally decided, which it is thought will be a great while first, seeing it hath already puzzled the schoolmen and lead∣ers of the church for sixteen centuries back. But to return
<PB N="296" REF="027249_0294_0FD3ED2048751D88"/>to the parsons company, wherever you meet with a clergy∣man who answers the description I have given, you need not ask him whether he is a churchman or a dissenter. All you have to do, is to put Belzebub's mark upon his fore∣head, and take assurance of him, that at a certain time, he shall not fail to visit the nether regions, and take his abode in the infernal palace.</P>
<P>In this very populous company, there is great diversity of ranks, even where there is an equality of genius; for some having scarcely finished their apprenticeship, are in∣ducted into livings, and instantly commence rectors and tithe∣gatherers. Others, for want of friends, are obliged much against their inclination to continue underlings all the length of a tedious life. I have seen a handsome parson ere now, riding upon four or five steeples at once, and having more in expectation; whilst his fellow student, could scarcely procure brown bread and Welch butter. And amongst all the pluralists in my acquaintance, I know not of one that has got livings enow; but give, give, is still their fervent prayer to my lord bishop, or some other patron who has a benefice to bestow. Many indeed think they should be quite contented, if they had but one more benefice added to what they now enjoy; but I can tell you, could they come by another, there would still be another wanting. It is much, now so many clergymen find themselves uneasy in the trammels, if they do not at last take it into their heads to persuade the legislature, that a clergyman cannot preach in three or four churches at one and the same time. And that it is not perfectly consistent, either with Christianity or reason, that one clergyman should have three or four liv∣ings, whilst another has none. Should it come to this, my company must be terrible sufferers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IMP.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would really think, if the cure of souls is as weighty a concern as some people make it, the parsons would not be so fond of pluralities; of adding living to liv∣ing, and parish to parish.</P>

<P>The cure of souls, forsooth! My parsons care not who take the souls. The fleece, cousin, the fleece, at∣tracts their attention. Give an avaricious parson the fleece, and you make fairies of the souls of the parishioners if you will. Many of them do very little of the priests office, be∣sides collecting the tithes and offerings; at which they are wonderfully dextrous. But as to preaching, they have no notion of it, and less still of visiting the sick, were they e∣ven in the jaws of death. I assure you, gentlemen, those idol shepherds are of the greatest use to our government. The interest of hell could not prosper as it does, were not we well befriended by many gentlemen in holy orders.</P>

<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, cousin, I have often thought, that with∣out their assistance, we should be ill put to it, to maintain our ground against the votaries of Immanuel. What posting to and from heil is there amongst our fable brethren, when but one faithful and zealous gospel minister arises in a nation? You may remember, when Luther and Calvin brake the chain of the pope and devil, lifted up the voice of the gospel trumpet, which resounded through the bowels of hell, and made the pillars of our infernal kingdom totter, what hurly burley we all were in? What deep consultations in the divan? What diligence in action with our forces upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, sir, but times are much altered for the bet∣ter; many a well paid parson now-a-days, is so obliging as to sing a lullaby to his people, when he finds them snoring in the sleep of security, and will suffer no man to attempt their awakening. He kindly tells them, "that they may sleep on now, and take their rest, for the wolf is gone out of the country, and will not for a great while return. Let no man disturb you with idle notions, for you may all go asleep to heaven without ever knowing what conversion means."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INF.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is admirable what power these same gentlemen have gotten over reason and religion; I have often thought, that if ever they were to read their bibles with attention, they could not be off from seeing that they themselves are the
<PB N="298" REF="027249_0296_0FD3ED21E3AAA550"/>identical persons intended by the idle idol shepherds, and unfaithful watchmen, against whom so many curses are denounced in scripture. The idle shepherds, you know, are such who feed and adorn themselves with the spoils of the flock, which is suffered to perish unwarned, and to die for lack of knowledge. The idol shepherd is that lord∣ly priest, that downy doctor, who keeps at an awful distance from men of ordinary rank, and is too much of the gentle∣man to give himself any concern about the souls of his pa∣rishioners.</P>
<P>Many of those idol shepherds I know, who possess some hundreds, ay, some of them thousands per annum, who will not so much as ask one of their cure, whether he intends to go to heaven or hell at death, or whether he serves God or the devil; yet if a parishioner die, they will keep as pene∣trating a look-out for their fees, as an eagle for his prey, and seize it with equal eagerness. Moreover, for the sake of this same fee, they will own the deceased for a brother, which privilege was always denied him whilst alive, unless he should indeed have happened to be one of the fat of the flock, who was capable of yielding a double fleece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the fleece, sir, which my disciples regard, and not the flock; how have I been diverted sometimes, both at church and meeting-house, to hear the parson, with an air the most supercilious and contemptful, railing against the most useful of God's ministers, as enthusiasts, fanaticks, and methodists: ah! said I to myself, what poor honest de∣vils were those of old, who confest Christ and his disciples, and thus declared to the sons of Sceva, "Jesus we know, and Paul we know, but who are you?"</P>
<P>Sometimes I hear them crying with vehemence against the divinity of Immanuel; one making him some kind of a su∣per-angelic being, and another asserting that he is only a man like themselves. Then say I, what a pusillanimous spirit was that same devil Legion, who, without receiving either tithe or offering, confessed Jesus of Nazereth to be the only
<PB N="299" REF="027249_0297_0FD3ED049183F2A0"/>Son of God, to whom the scriptures ascribe every divine ho∣nour. But these parsons are well paid for confessing him, and yet deny him with the utmost insolence.</P>
<P>There is never a day but I hear some of this company charging the lie upon one text or other of the bible. One tells his people there is no such thing as one being chosen to sal∣vation more than another, but that the love of God is equal unto, and upon all men, whether Jew or Gentile, Turk or Pagan, Papist or Protestant; nay, then I say, master parson, you are become a dissenter from your own seventeenth arti∣cle. And, to speak within compass, there are at least a thousand pulpits in the church occupied by such dissenters.</P>
<P>Then I hear others railing against those who preach sal∣vation by grace; and at the same time assuring their people, that they must be saved by their own holiness and good works. Very well, say I, then I have my desire, for upon these terms they will never be saved at all. But still I am at a loss, how they dare so barefacedly give the lie to Paul the apostle, who taught the church, that "By grace they were saved, through faith, and that not of themselves, but the gift of God." I hear many clergymen of the established church, in entering upon the service, thus address the majesty of heaven, "Lord cleanse thou the thoughts of our hearts, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit;" and in less than an hour after, telling their parishioners, that it is mere enthusi∣asm in any man to expect in these days, to be at all influen∣ced by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>So glaring the contradictions, which sometimes they are guilty of, that I tremble with fear, lest the people should be convinced of the truth; but these are favourable times, gentlemen, very favourable; for the greatest part of the people have something else to think of when they go to church, besides either preaching or prayer.</P>
<P>When I hear the parson, whether churchman or dissen∣ter, telling his people how holy and pure the heart of man it by nature; how aptly formed for sentiments of the most
<PB N="300" REF="027249_0298_0FD3EDB1914CCD70"/>exalted piety, and for entertaining the love of God; I am wonderfully at a lose to know, how he came by more exten∣sive knowledge of mankind than Jesus Christ, who expressly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that whatsoever defileth the man, proceeds out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Your influences, Fastosus, are of excellent use, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where they are; you take care to persuade each of them separately, that of all others his own know∣ledge is the most refined; and hence it is, that Goodwin, Owen, Chatnock, and all such authors, are considered as weak though well-meaning divines.</P>
<P>It is very diverting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear my parsons boasting of their superior knowledge, even when by their ministrations it is plain, that they are acquainted with almost any writings, better than those of inspiration; when their auditories dwin∣dle away to nothing, and the few people who abide by them are destitute of all religion. Did they but know half as much as the most illiterate devil of our fraternity, they would at least believe that there may be a possibility of their mistaking the way, and that after all their pretensions to superior knowledge, they may run some risk of a final mis∣carriage. But as our good friends the Roman doctors, are wont to say, "Ignorance is the mother of devotion:" so say I of my parsons, "Ignorance is the spring of all their knowledge," and whilst my father Infidelis can keep them ignorant, my uncle Fastosus can easily puff them up with a sense of the clearness of their heads, and goodness of their hearts; so that I can do very well with them, and retain them amongst our worshippers.</P>
<P>III. The next company in our corporation is that of the straining landlords, a very noble and reputable company, indeed; notwithstanding, they are far from being opulent. In the days of yore, when luxary was but little in vogue, the frecholders were attended with fewer wants, and of course this company was less flourishing; but since these happy days commenced, in which people of quality are trained up in absolute idleness and dissipation; in which vir∣tue
<PB N="301" REF="027249_0299_0FD3CDA6AC0FE458"/>is of no account, and luxury, pride, and dissoluteness, are arrrived at their zenith; the people of quality are amaz∣ingly poor, and are attended with an undescribable train of necessities. What is very remarkable, their pride has grown in a perfect proportion to their poverty, so that now it is an established law amongst them, to look upon themselves as of a different blood from the rest of mankind. Indeed you can∣not affront a person of quality worse, than by like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing him to one of those, who are called vulgar creatures; notwith∣standing, by the way, it is those same vulgar creatures which enable persons of rank and fashion to support the dignity of their station; and were there no vulgar creatures, there would also be no ladies of quality.</P>
<P>This distinction which the quality pay to themselves, is of the utmost use in my administration, as will appear from the following story.</P>
<P>I went one day to the house of Sir Fop Mortalis, a very famous gentleman in the country, with a design to pay my devoirs to madam Mortalis, his lady; a gentlewoman who abhors to have the least comparison made, betwixt her and any person whatever of inferior rank. The chambermaid informed her mistress, that good Mr. Prudence waited be∣low, desiring to speak with her ladyship, if convenient; the lady soon descended, and compliments passed on either side, she conducted me into her parlour, where she and I had the following dialogue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Mr. Prudence, you have been a very great stranger! It is now many months since I saw you at our house; but I am glad to see you now, and I wish in my heart Sir Fop Mortalis had been at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUDENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Urgent business, madam, demands my at∣tendance so much elsewhere, that I cannot so frequently as I could wish, pay my respects to Sir Fop and my lady Mor∣talis. But now, madam, I am come, if possible to rectify a growing mistake amongst mankind; and must tell your
<PB N="302" REF="027249_0300_0FD3EDA146933A40"/>ladyship, that I am heartily sorry to see the world arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a pitch of ambition as it is now. Indeed, my lady, it is become a very difficult matter, in a concourse of people, to distinguish between the farmers and tradesmens wives, and ladies of birth and fortune; nor can we more casily distin∣guish between their several children. Why, madam, the farmers and tradesmens children are all masters and misses; young gentlemen and ladies now-a-days. I know not, for my part, what the world will come to, if some measures are not speedily taken to prevent the confounding of baseness with dignity.</P>
<P>When I was last at church, I was surprised to see, as I thought, miss Mortalis, your daughter, there; well know∣ing that neither Sir Fop himself, nor any of his family, go often to any place of public worship. Because you know, my lady, few of you great folks love the tedious duties of religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not we, indeed; give us the cards, or musical en∣tertainments for our money We hate their whining, dole∣ful eant; let them choose religion, who have taste for no∣thing more polite. We'll have none of it, I assure you, Mr. Prudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, my lady, I know it, and am mightily pleased with your determination. But as I was telling your ladyship, being at church, as soon as service was over, I said to a man who sat in the pew with me, "I am surprised to see Miss Mortalis at church, to day. Do you think, sir, that any body has been daring enough to tell her that she real∣ly is a mortal?" To which the plain countryman, in his own clownish way, replied, "Miss Mortalis at church, quoth-a— no, no, sir, you are quite mistaken, for Sir Fop's family are people of quality, and therefore meddle none with religion. What should they do at church, seeing they fear no hell, re∣gard not God, and believe not in the devil; as for heaven, Sir Fop is willing to leave that to the poor, and desires no great∣er happiness for himself and his, than is implied in an earl∣dom."</P>

<P>But, said I to the fellow pray who is that young lady whom I took for Miss Mortalis? Poh, lady quoth a—why 'tis John Tillground's daughter, o'the Five Elms. Tillground's daughter! said I, you surprize me; she is as finely drest, as I have seen Miss Mortalis, when going to a ball. And pray, continued I, who is yonder lady, with the French head-dress and furred cardi∣nal? I thought you had had no people of quality in this pa∣rish, besides Sir Fop's family. No, sir, returned he, we have none who are such by birth, but we have many who are quality by their dress. The lady, sir, that you enquire after is Mrs. Watson, the landlady at the Three Tuns.</P>
<P>Well, madam, I followed them out of church, and was amazed to see the plattings of hair, the tires of ruffles, and the labyrinthian furbeloes with which the women were de∣corated. Indeed, my lady, if the world holds on but a few years in its present career, we shall not be able to dis∣tinguish betwixt the highest and the lowest rank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of people.</P>

<P>It must undoubtedly be considered as an insuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣able insult upon people of breeding, when they are thus ta∣ken off by the vulgar. But, madam, I have a scheme to propose, which, if adopted, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffectually correct their insolence, and soon oblige John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illground and Timothy Turf's daughters to lay aside their furbeloes, ruf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, and tea-table, and betake themselves to their spinning wheels.</P>

<P>What is it? I pray you, good Mr. Prudence, be so obliging; I beg you would, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD:</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, your farmers are all become gentlement of late; they talk of fortunes for their children, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as very little inferior to the 'Squire
<PB N="304" REF="027249_0302_0FD3EDA280658060"/>himself; but let me tell you, madam, the fault is not so much in the farmers, as in the landlords themselves, who let their farms upon terms by far too low and easy There is this same John Tillground, and his neighbour Timothy Turf, as I am infor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d, have both of them money lying at interest, when my worthy and right honourable lord No∣ble, a gentleman of the first quality, is obliged to pawn his plate for cash, to pay off the four thousand pounds he lost the other night at cards; and whilst his gentle neighbour, 'Squire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zfolly, is obliged to fall his timber to stop the horrid gap, which his malevolent stars opened at Newmar∣ket-races, where the gamblers of rank and quality occasion∣ally try their fortune.</P>
<P>'Tis insufferable, madam, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the farmer's circumstan∣ces should be easy, whilst people of fashion know not how to keep off the dans from their doors. What right has any body to any thing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>des slavery, except people of quality? Were not those vulgar creatures originally designed as your slaves, madam? and yet for any thing I see, they will soon be on a level with you unless some method, lucky enough to prevent it, is speedily devised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, sir, I fear it, indeed. If you do know of any suitable means to prevent it, I beg, good Mr. Prudence, you will inform me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is only one way that I know of, madam, and that is to raise their rents to the uttermost. As every lease expires, it will be an easy matter for Sir Fop, in the renewal of it, to advance the rent as high as he pleases. The slaves dare not go away; and if they should, there will be others foolish enough, to agree to any t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms, rather than miss of a farm. This done, and all your tenants set∣tled upon the racked farms; if any one of them happens to rear a handsome colt, let Sir Fop himself, or young mas∣ter, fall in love with it, demand it of its owner for so much, never exceeding half its value; he may privately grumble, but dare not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fuse, for fear of offending his honour. By
<PB N="305" REF="027249_0303_0FD3ED802C2671C8"/>these means, and others which occasion will suggest, you may make them all humble enough</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most excellently spoken, good Mr. Prudence. Then Tillground's wife will be obliged to sell her china∣ware to procure rags for her brats; the daughter must take to her wheel and wash-tub, and my son, master Thomas, will ride a better horse than he now does. This scheme will certainly conquer the ambition of the farmers; but what will it do for the tradesmen, good Mr. Prudence; they will still continue an eye-sore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, the same scheme will produce very humbling effects, upon tradesmen of every kind; though I dare not assert, that you will ever be able perfectly to subject to your ambition and avarice, that honourable body of merchants, whom you affectedly call cits. No, madam, I am afraid that nobility itself must give place to the public spirit of the merchant; yet even them you may greatly in∣jure, and prevent their being of such essential service to their country, as otherwise they might be. But as to in∣land trade, by racking your tenants in the manner pre∣scribed, you may absolutely destroy it. That you may see the utility of my scheme, I shall a little explain it to your ladyship.</P>
<P>If the farmers are racked to the utmost, they will be obliged to sell the produce of their lands at an exhorbitant price, otherwise it will be altogether out of their power to pay the stipulated rent. And besides selling their crops, &amp;c. for an advanced price, they will be obliged to abridge the wages of all their labourers, smiths, carpenters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By these means the farmer will find it very difficult to live, and of course will rarely visit the mercer's and drap∣er's shops; and as for his labourers and workmen, they will find but little money to lay out in cloaths; especially if their children be numerous, as the demands of the back must always give place to the louder calls of the belly. And
<PB N="306" REF="027249_0304_0FD3EDA42063B3C8"/>as you know, my lady, sterility very rarely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wells in the labourer's cuttage: it is unknown what misery you may happily introduce amongst them, by the scheme proposed. The draper's goods, will lie upon his hands, unless indeed he is pleased to give credit to the poor; if the former, he will be sparing of his orders; and if the latter, we shall soon have him a bankrupt, so that he will be effectually ru∣ined.</P>
<P>You see, madam, that here we affect the manufacturer, equally with the farmer and shopkeeper; for when the re∣tail trade is ruined by the dearness of provisions, the mana∣facturer will find little call for his goods; the issue of which will be, the disbanding of many of his journeymen, and abridging the wages of the rest. The disbanded journey∣men being incapable of finding employment, and not hav∣ing learned the art of living like the camelion, on the air, will be drove to thieving, by which means America will be peopled, and Tyburn Chronicle rendered respectable.</P>
<P>As to the manufacturer himself, his capital being soon converted into manufactured goods, he will be obliged to sell them under their value, that he may keep up his credit with the merchant, and be able to carry on a little trade, vainly hoping that times may alter for the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, sir, your scheme is very feasible, and yet there is one thing that will put the manufacturer abso∣lutely out of our power. I mean, sir, the exportation of their manufacture. I don't know how it is, but these cits of merchants can send goods any where, and they, sir, will support the manufacturer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam, I assure you, my scheme, if cor∣dially adopted, and executed with vigour, will put it abso∣solutely out of the merchant's power. There is nothing can recommend the English manufacture at a foreign mar∣ket, but the price being inferior to that of other nations. Now, if an Englishman must pay twice as dear for his pro∣vision in his own country, as a Frenchman does in his, it
<PB N="307" REF="027249_0305_0FD3ED81837354D0"/>is easy to see that either journeymen's wages must in En∣gland be double to what they are in France, or the jour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>men must starve; which few Englishmen are fond of doing. The consequence of this is, the French manufac∣turer can send his goods to a foreign market upon better terms than an Englishman, and of course destroy all the foreign trade of the English nation. Thus, madam, I have pointed out a method by which, you people of fashion, in order to support your own grandeur, may suck the blood of all inferior ranks of people, and make the British subjects absolutely slaves, even in a country which boasts its free∣dom. Nay more, this is a method by which you may ruin the most flourishing nation in the world.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spoke like an angel, good Mr. Prudence. I protest, upon honour, I will not sleep till I have consulted Sir Fop on the matter.</P>

<P>I took my leave of her ladyship, who could not rest till she had communicated the matter to her acquaintan∣ces, and they to their acquaintances, and so they again to theirs, that it had very soon made the tour of Great Britain and Ireland; an ordinance was instituted in the company of avaricious landlords, that in every future lease, the far∣mers should be racked to the last extremity. This ordi∣nance has been universally complied with by the whole com∣pany; so that there is reason to hope, in time, all the bles∣sed consequences proposed, will arise from it, as you may see to what an exhorbitant price all manner of provisions is al∣ready arrived. What may not be expected from such hope∣ful beginnings?</P>

<P>Indeed, sir, to see Mynheer equipped in his ho∣liday cloaths, he makes pretty near as awkward an appear∣ance as a Laplander; and one would certainly conclude, that he is a perfect stranger to courtly Fastosus. But all the world knows, that Avaro is a very respectable person∣age in Holland.</P>

<P>I told you before, cousin, that you have an ugly way of encroaching upon your neighbour's right. I do not like it, cousin, and will assert my dominion.

Or, that he is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the best fellow who can wear the greatest number of pairs of breeches? I assert, there may be as much pride under a Dutchman's cap, as under a Scotch bonnet, or e∣ven under a Frenchman's hat; notwithstanding there is a very great difference between the first and the last. The first, you know, is a fixt ponderous substance, and the last is mutable, as the weathercock on the top of St. Peter's, Yes.

<P>To give you a proper idea of which, I shall read you a let∣ter which I stole the other night, from the chairman of a reading society in the country, designed to be sent to the Reviewers, critical and monthly.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are, what country people call a reading society, into which we had formed ourselves some years before the first Review made its public appearance. We had not long ta∣ken in books, before we found several articles of our pur∣chase to be stolen from other authors; and but very few of our titular authors, had either honour or honesty enough, to inform the public from what sources they compiled their volumes. We would advise all writers to live upon their own proper genius, deeming it pity that pilferers should be suf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered in the republic of letters. At the last meeting of our club, this question was put and canvassed, "What can induce one writer to steal from another?"</P>
<P>To this important question, one replied one thing, and another said what he could to confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it, as every member was willing to display his abilities; at last, Dick Keene, a testy kind of youth, but of good sense, gave us the following satisfactory answer.</P>
<P>"Very probably, said master Dick, some authors may steal from others for the same reason which that celebrat∣ed
<PB N="310" REF="027249_0308_0FD3EDA706FF9870"/>fool of old had, who burnt himself and the temple toge∣ther, in order to perpetuate his name. There are authors, endued with the same laudable ambition, who not being hap∣py enough to have been born free in the literary republic, are obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to dishonest measures, in order to gratify their ambition. Their ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses (if it be lawful to speak of their geniuses) being destitute of every prolific principle, and their fancies fixed as the Py<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>encan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Alps; they cannot pos∣sibly gain repute but on the credit of their predecessors. Therefore, what frugal nature, and Gamaliel hath with∣held, must be supplied by industrious freedom; and as the end proposed must at all events be obtained, honour, truth, and honesty, smoke at once on the altar of ambition. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rk goes the writer, plunders every volume in his own and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> patron's library, at last compleats his scheme; and lo! we have an entire new work, by the learned Mr. Dunce. And so it comes to pass, that we the honest purchasers, pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce or four times over for the same matter and, perhaps in almost the same manner likewise.</P>
<P>There are others, who, as a just judgment on their for∣mer indolence and extravagance, are now condemned to live upon their wit; which being dull and tardy, somewhat a-kin to the brain of an ass, of itself can afford but a very penurious table, and uncomfortable lodging. Bitten with hunger, the unhappy man is obliged to steal where he can, and then to sell his ill-gotten collection to the bookseller, in order to procure a good holiday dinner. The bookseller, I believe, is pretty well convinced of the truth of my re∣marks, as he has paid smart for his connection with litera∣ry thieves.</P>
<P>Of these two kinds of pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erers, in my humble opinion, the latter is by far the most excusable. He cannot work, he is ashamed to beg, therefore m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st either steal or starve. What can he steal with more safety than the works of the learned? In my opinion, there is no more danger in rob∣bing a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eman of his literary honour, than for a stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣man
<PB N="311" REF="027249_0309_0FD3ED86456A0068"/>to rob his mother country: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew such thieves are con∣ducted by the county officers to Tyburn. O solemn tree, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>auds are committed against thee? Of how many necks, equi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably thine, art thou cheated annually."</P>
<P>'Twas now Bill Candour, a good natured youth, inter∣rupted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, thinking his reflections somewhat severe. "Hold! Mr Keene, I think your reasoning is too full of acrimony. If all transcripts, extracts and abridgments, were to be suppressed, it would be a very great loss to the public; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se men, therefore, who take the trouble of such a service, deferve open acknowledgement, for raising up valuable auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs from the vaults of oblivion instead of be∣ing lashed with the rod of merciless satyr." To which Dick replied,</P>
<P>"That many ancient writings, are truly worthy of be∣ing introduced to public view; I am so far from denying, that, I should deem it truly laudable for any gentleman of capacity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sure, to draw forth the remains of antiquity from the cells of obscurity, and should be one of the first to vote him the most public thanks. But I would have it done in such a manner, as to come within the reach of the mid∣dle class of people, amongst whom the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k of all sorts of readers are found. Moreover, I would have all writings on religious subjects so contrived, as to come within the reach of the poor, for who else give themselves any troable about religion, or have any pleasure in serious writings? If a com∣mentary on the Bible must go beyond the extent of their fi∣nances, it might as well be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ked up in Pool's Synop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, where it was before the commentary was written. Opulent tradesmen you know, are such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aves to the laws of getting, that they have no time to read and therefore may pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dently avoid p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchasing. And people of fash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on are generally per∣fectly satisfied with having such or such books in their libra∣ries, without so much as looking farther into them than the title papes. Surely, gentlemen, no man is to be vindicat∣ed in making merchandise of his neighbour's genius."</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="027249_0310_0FD3EDA8A2421888"/>
Here he concluded, and we were soon convinced, that there was much weight in his reasoning. We must beg leave to tell you, gentlemen, that when your worships erect∣ed your tribunal, and every author was summoned to ap∣pear before you, we flattered a hope, that all pilferers would have fled out of the republic of letters. But, alas! we have been hitherto disappointed, and in reality, they seem to be on the increase, so that a man can hardly claim personal right to a single idea, how justly soever it may be his property.</P>
<P>We earnestly beg that you, gentlemen, will be obliging enough to publish your aversion to this craft; to command all, who are destitute both of fortune and genius, to recon∣cile themselves to their destiny, and shew their submission to the higher power, by learning some handicraft business, by which they may gain an honest living. There are a thousand ways to live in the world, if that of an author were to cease. For instance, there is carrying a musket, or beating a drum by land, and furling the sails by sea, ei∣ther of which are honourable employments, when compar∣ed with that of book-stealing.</P>
<P>As we know not to whom we can apply, with any hope of success, but to yourselves; we must farther beg, that you will not only detect the theft, when you meet with it, but do as the worthy inhabitants of St. Giles's do on similar occa∣sions, that is, pursue the delinquent with a stop-thief, stop∣thief. Indeed, gentlemen, it will not lessen you in the pub∣lic esteem, should you commence even literary thief catchers. Should it please you to comply with our request, we doubt not but the streets which lead to places of public resort, will in a few years be lined with many authors, having assumed the more honourable employment of a beggar.</P>
<P>Thus the imposts would be taken off from the studious; real authors would preserve their honour, no one daring to invade their right, for fear of exposing themselves to public infamy. Perhaps that most villainous of all practices may
<PB N="313" REF="027249_0311_0FD3ED8840562E80"/>put a stop to; we mean the vending of clowdy commenta∣ries on the Bible; few people, we should think, would be fond of purchasing such books, after they are informed that most of the materials are stolen. Effectually to put a stop to this inquitous practice, we would recommend the publica∣tion of the above named Synopsis in English, and then every reader may take what human sense of the divine word he pleases.</P>

<P>Indeed, cousin, I think the request of that society reasonable enough, and ought to be granted; for as the world now goes, it is a difficult matter for a man to know to whom he is obliged for any profitable hint he meets with in the course of his reading. And flimsy as modern productions in general are, there is now and then a profitable hint to be met with. But when any thing of a recommendatory qua∣lity happens to emerge from the teem-press; the whole race of catch-penny imitators, swarm about it, and gobble it up, then spue it out, as if it were their own. However, cousin, it must be owned, there are some of your mercenary scribblers who are much more honourable than others, and let the public know, that what they write is not the fruit of their own genius, but is borrowed from this or that respocta∣ble author, under pretence of making it more public, on ac∣count of its great excellency. They desire not to rob the author of his honour: all they deem necessary, is a loan of his genius to supply the defects of their own, and to help them a little forward in the world.</P>
<P>But of all writers, commend me to polemic divines. Oh! it would be a pleasure to the devil himself, to see with what dexterity they put off their own anger, under the name of zeal for God; just as the industrious tradesmen of Bir∣mingham
<PB N="314" REF="027249_0312_0FD3EDAC61699AA8"/>do their manufacture for the coin of the nation. 'Tis amazing to think, how pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>estant ministers can lugg in the Almighty into both sides of their quarrel; and how they would make the world believe, that their cause is the cause of heaven, and that they have got authority to dispense the curses of the Most High. Nothing can be more pleasing, than to see men of wisdom and religion, vigorously contend∣ing for their own honour, and at the same time making the public believe, they have nothing in view but the Redeemer's glory. And I assure you it is not every divine, even of great parts, who takes time to distinguish between the glory of God, and his own reputation.</P>
<P>Next to this, I am delighted to see men of learning and religion, bickering each other about subjects, which the greatest of all the apostles would not presume to pry into. But we have divines so expert, that they understand what never was revealed; and so zealous, that they will oblige others to have the same degree of intelligence with them∣selves, under pain of their implacable displeasure; and yet they are the true ministers of the meek and loving Saviour. But a very few are to be met with who have humility e∣nough to submit to the simplicity of scripture. However, cousin, although I love to set forth my own powerful influ∣ence, I would not willingly prevent your proceeding with your story. Mean while, I want you to be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cit with regard to your company of letter ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>.

<P>No, gentlemen, I do not mean, neither all the booksellers nor printers. Printing has been to mankind one of the greatest of all temporal blessings, and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much fear, be the total ruin of the kingdom of dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as wherever the freedom of the press is suffered, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reformation along with it. But amongst those concerne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> literary affairs, there are many villainous people, who, when their trade runs low, take up with printing corrupt∣ing novels, such as the Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure;
<PB N="315" REF="027249_0313_0FD3ED89C40D6638"/>blasphemous plays, such as Sammy Foot's Minor; schisma∣tic harangues, like the greater part of political essays; vain disputes about things of trivial import, &amp;c. all such, and many such there be, we rank with the false publishers, be∣cause truth and falthood are with them of equal value, and their choice is fixed by what will serve a present turn. The patriotic alderman is a leading man in this learned company. He has not learned so little by the gift of second sight, which he has had from his cradle, as not to know, that more than truth is indispensably necessary, to support some particular personal characters. Besides, there are others, who will sell both soul and body to the father of lies, in de∣fence of some particular state; and others to ruin some pub∣lic character. The celebrated Mr. Maubert of Brussels is a great man in this way.</P>
<P>Free of this company, are another set of men, implaca∣ble enemies to honest industry, who live altogether by their wit; appear in all shapes and characters, and stick at no∣thing to get money. Although these people have nothing but grimace to fell, (through a folly, formerly almost pe∣culiar to the metropolis, but now diffusing itself every where) they have for six months in the year a very plen∣tiful market; and many who would suffer the miserable to perish unrelieved at their gates, will liberably contribute to support the luxury and libertinism of the players.

<P>I think you must be mistaken now, cousin, for the end of all theatrical entertainments, which I perceive you have in view, is the exposing of vice and reformation of manners; consequently their design was originally religi∣ous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AVAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow, that in the darkness of paganism, the ancients had a religious design, in exhibitions of the stage; but what of that? They had likewise a religious design, in
<PB N="316" REF="027249_0314_0FD3EDAEC78049C0"/>passing their children through the fire to the devil Molech. I allow, farther, that in the days of monkish ignorance, those blinking priests, made use of the stage to convey their instructions; but then it ought to be observed, that the same fathers were equally pious, and devout in persecuting the best of men. So then, cousin, the one is as much au∣thorised by ancient practice as the other. Indeed when you consider, that the stage is peopled by extravagant, spend-thrift gentlemen, broken tradesmen, lazy mechanics, who are always avowed enemies to moral integrity; they will appear to be a very unpromising race of reformers.</P>
<P>Should you follow them from the stage to their lodgings, and trace their steps through the lanes of private life, you would soon be convinced, that Sir John Fielding's runners bid much more fair than they, for reforming the manners of the people. And you know, the said runners have ne∣ver as yet been considered as the most respectable charac∣ters. Surely, it must be thought requisite in those who set up for reformers of others, that in some tolerable de∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e they should moralize themselves.</P>

<P>I know it, cousin; and I thwarted you on purpose, to see how you could justify your claim upon the gentry of the stage; and must confess you have done it to my satisfac∣tion. I am highly pleased with the entertainments of the theatre myself, and am greatly delighted to see gentlemen and ladies croud to them. Gentry who would worship God, in neither church nor meeting-house, can be devout enough to attend the theatres, in Covent-Garden and the Hay-Market. It is truly pleasing to see gentlemen and ladies, who cannot possibly find money to pay off their tradesmen's bills, find plenty of cash to purchase play-house and pan∣theon tickets.</P>

<P>You must know, Leonora and Matilda have been intimate from their infancy, and as such continued their friendship even to mature life; but when both became wives and mothers, I taught them to behave more inconsistently than they did when they were children. Matilda being quite fatigued with domestic concerns, an attention to which her mind is not very happily turned, resolved one day to spend the afternoon with her friend Leonora. When she went, she found her exceedingly deprest and hysterical, by no means in a talkative humour; a circumstance which frequently hap∣pens to the ladies of middle rank, over since luxury and idle∣ness became so prevalent amongst them.</P>
<P>Matilda, not being sufficiently skilled in physiognomy, to read the sentiments of the heart, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the position of the fea∣tures of the countenance, was led into mistake, which proved fatal to their friendship She discovered, or thought she discovered an unsual and unexpected shyness run through every part of Leonora's conduct, which discovery proved no slight mortification to her own sensibility. Said she to her∣self, "Well Leonora, I perceive notwithstanding all your farmal civility, that my company is not the object of your present desire, I wish I had been aware of it in time! Then I assure you, my presence should not have drawn a cloud over that settled countenance of yours. But, indeed, madam, let my company be over so disagreeable to you, yours I assure you is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery little more pleasant to me."</P>
<P>Whilst she was meditating some plausible pretext for with∣drawing, the tea was unhappily brought in, which preclud∣ed her remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al for a little while longer. Thus constrained by decency to stay, her glowing resentment of the supposed slight forbid her to taste a morse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the toast, or to drink a∣bove two dishes of tea. Having finished, she pretended she must retire on some urgent business, which had just oc∣curred to her mind; (for ladies will lie to serve a turn) and
<PB N="318" REF="027249_0316_0FD3EDB008A53DD8"/>after a dry compliment or two she went off, fully resolved never to return.</P>
<P>As she went along the streets, her wounded heart boiled with a thousand cogitations, how or when she had offended Leonora. "What have I done or said that should have giv∣en her umbrage. I know of nothing: and therefore I care not for her anger. If people will be so odd in their temper, they must even come to themselves at their leisure. And so your servant, Leonora."</P>

<P>True, sir, but the matter did not end here. Poor Matilda, being unable to bear the conceived slight, made free to call on Letitia on her way home, that she might give a lit∣tle vent to her turbulent passions. Letitia, being as destitute of innate ideas as she is of fidelity, readily listened to the plaintive account, how Matilda had been served; without hesitation approved her departure, kindly fanned the flame of resentment, and at last advised her to let Leonora come to herself when she should find it convenient.</P>
<P>Matilda had not been long gone, before Letitia, who burned with impatience to have a little Tittle-tattle, went to Leonora, and set mischief abroach with her also. She told her all the former had said of her, and happily gave it such a turn, as to render it very offensive, notwithstanding she kept strictly to the letter of truth. Some people are re∣markably happy in talents of this kind; by their manner of representation, they can turn things quite from their natu∣ral appearance, as I may perhaps shew you in some future conserence. Leonora could not but think herself very ill used, and resolved, weakly as she was, that she would be a slave to no body's temper.</P>
<P>When Matilda and Leonora met next time, being pre∣possest with mutual disgust, their compliments were dry and
<PB N="319" REF="027249_0317_0FD3ED8D23CE4280"/>starched; and secretly blamed the indifference of the other. By this time I furnished each of them with a telescope, by which they might throughly examine each others conduct, and so reciprocally strict is their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> watch, that nothing can escape them. Thus from the smallest beginning, found∣ed too in misunderstanding, I raised perpetual disgust and en∣mity. Absurd, and ridiculous as this is, I could point you out a thousand differences, sprung from incidents equally fri∣volous and unimportant. Indeed, if freedom and submis∣sion keep at a distance I can blow up a flame of contention the most violent, from the smallest matters imaginable. And I thank my stars, Mess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Freedom and Submission, are in no great esteem with mankind.

<P>I have great pleasure sometimes in making parents become the instraments of their children's ruin; or as some people say, to kill them with kindness. I make it my busi∣ness to prejudice almost every parent, so far in favour of his children, that every one considers his own as the most wit∣ty and active; or to use the words of a good woman, con∣cerning her son of two years old, (the most manly of any child in the neighbourhood,) even as the crow conceives her own to be fairer than all the children of the feathered people.</P>
<P>I shall trouble you but with one instance out of the mil∣lions I might produce. Little master Jacky, was one of those extraordinary children, whose almost every action
<PB N="320" REF="027249_0318_0FD3CD9DAD2893D0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> common way, the wonder and admiration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> parents. Jacky must not be chid, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, or seratched his nurse; but must have his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> humour; it was even pleasing to see his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed into his parents faces; so you may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the child must not be suffered to cry upon any account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> always be indulged in whatever he wanted. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> child, in whom, however, none besides his parents could see any thing out of the common way, not∣withstanding every visitor was plagued with the history of his wonderful seats, upon which his parents dwelt with rap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I say▪ Jacky found himself master of the whole fa∣mily; he acted accordingly, and took his own way in every particular.</P>
<P>By these means his tempers gained strength, so that they become habitual, not to be broken by ordinary means.</P>
<P>When he got a few more years over his head, still gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing in his humour, the poor parents began to see and lament the errors of their former conduct. Too late, master Jacky being now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eches, and grown a great boy, will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> back that dominion they were pleased to put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, when but in petticoats. He thinks it very hard he should not choose for himself now be is ten, as well as when he was but three years old; rightly judging, that he was not more wise then than he is now, and if they thought him fit to be all their masters then, he is sure that by this time he is much more sit to govern.</P>
<P>Apprehensive now of the ruin of his son, the father ex∣hibits exhortations, injunctions, reproofs, and threatenings with great severity. In vain, for not being bended whilst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and maleable, master's tempers are not now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of their native channel.

I furnished him with a pair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and directed him in the use of them; and now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> began to reason upon his father's conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="027249_0319_0FD3ED8E598F9058"/>
"What a change is this come to my father? Once he was something like good-natured, but now he is the most self-willed and rigorous man in the world. Surely no rea∣sonable person would impose such laws upon his children as he does on me; laws, such as nobody of any spirit would submit to. I was formerly his pretty lad, his good boy, and every thing I did was right; times are strangely chan∣ged, for now I can do nothing to please him, I could have had what I would and gone where I pleased; but now I am perplexed with warm exhortations, which I hear unreason∣ably frequent; and can go no where, without his leave, as if I had not more sense now than when I was little. His reproofs are too harsh; I hear of nothing but my stubborn∣ness and wickedness; of his and my mother's sorrow; and of breaking their hearts on my account. I should break none of their hearts, I assure them, if they would let me a∣lone.</P>
<P>"Cannot my father and mother grieve for themselves, and not teaze me about their trouble? I am no worse than my neighbours, though by their account I might be the wickedest wretch that ever lived. It is not enough that I must go to church on holidays, but we must have lectures on divinity at home; and for me, I am roundly told, that if I go on as I do, I must certainly perish. Yes, I must even be damned and go to hell. Old people are surely very conceited; I warrant me they think they are so very good, they are sure to go to heaven. It is a brave thing to have a good opinion of one's self, which surely must be their case, or they would never plague me thus with their re∣peated lectures. Well, for my own part, I am not so vain, and yet I think I am in no greater danger than they are. When they were young, I dare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y they loved pleasure as well as me, but now they get old and cannot relish it them∣selves, they would absurdly restrain me from it.

<P>Thus, gentlemen, I persuade many to lay up future af∣flictions for themselves, in the early ruin of their children, by over indulgence.

Yet those very parents, who have laid the foundation of their son's ruin, by early indulgence in his infancy, very often compleat it by unseasonable strictness over him when he is verging towards man's estate.

<P>I make myself very merry with the ladies in an∣other way, which also turns eventually to everlasting sepa∣ration. I join a little knot of them together so closely for a time, that they cannot be separated, nor bear to be asunder for a day together. I prejudice them so strongly for a while in each others favour, that they shew a manifest slight to those who are not happy enough to be admitted into their society. Family necessity, and every domestic duty, must give place to their firm attachment to one another. When they get together for a little chit chat, they are as happy as the birds in May; not only examine every absent character, within the circle of their acquaintance, and report to each other all the evil they know of their own sex: but each dwells severally upon the excellencies or failings of her husband; who is at one time the best of men, at another time the worst, just as her ladyship happens to be in a good or bad humour with him. Thus they go on, till every one is fully acquaint∣ed with the family affairs of the rest, and thus they bring themselves into the power of one another. This is the ze∣nith of that happiness to which I aim to bring them; for even the devil will give present happiness in order to introduce future pain and sorrow; and assure you I am too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kin to my worthy grandfather, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that felicity to go long uninterrupted.</P>

By and by it is whispered what Chlee said at such a place about Phillis; what Lucia said of Arabella, &amp;c. till I blow them all up in a pleasing flame of resentment; and every one says the worst she knows of her neighbour, which commonly is a great deal.

<P>I have, replied he abruptly, a greateral of busi∣ness among statesmen, to drive people to their levees, which they dearly love to have crouded, and which never could be without my assistance; for who would attend the levee of my lord Superbo, or of his grace the duke Parkland, un∣less he first turned fool? Would any man feed on the pro∣mise of a courtier, if he were not mad? The dinner of the Camelion is as weighty as the promise of the greatest states∣men, were it even confirmed by a smile of the countenance and a grasp of the hand; for it all means no more, than "I am glad to see you thicken my levee," There is ne∣ver a levee day but I am obliged to bestir myself to drive the fools together.</P>
<P>If the premier, or the head man of any department, finds himself on the decline, and that he shall, without some good assistance, be obliged to resign; i. e. be turned out of his place. I am beseeched to procure some verbose, intre∣pid scribbler, to cry up his abilities and proceedings, as much superior to those of all his predecessors, for time immemo∣rial. But a man must first be reduced to a state of lunacy before he will venture on a work so difficult, and which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be but very ill rewarded. In the first place, he is likely to have truth and fact to overturn, before the end can be obtained, and these you know are stubborn and obsti∣nate. In the second place, if he is happy enough to suc∣ceed, and sets down his patron firmly in his chair again, he is soon made to understand that his service has done him little or no good; he is thanked for his good intention, but is given to know, that things would have been just as they are, if no defence at all had been made. If his patron is turned out, the scribbler is blamed for having omitted some∣thing which might have been of service, instead of being rewarded for what he has done. So that at all events he must come off loser, and therefore none but a madman will venture on the undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="027249_0324_0FD3EDB9D58A6780"/>
The lawyers also, would but for my influences be oblig∣ed to drive teams, or follow ploughs; for who but mad∣men would ever find them employment? But in consequence of their firm attachment to our government, I persuade some to expose themselves by slowness of payment of their just debts, to the fangs of the lawyers; others to quarrel about trifles, and refer the matter to them for decision. Sometimes I advise a father to leave his daughter under the guardianship of an attorney, or an uncle to leave his estate to his minor nephew, under the care and inspection of a coun∣sellor, either of which is likely to be a lucrative job to the gentlemen of the law. You know very well, continued he, that none but madmen will ever refer their differences to the decision of those gentlemen, whilst their are three ho∣nest men to be met with in the nation; nor will any man in his right mind ever leave an attorney executor to his will.</P>
<P>There are abundance of people who live above their re∣venues, and others still who have abundance, but dare not make use of it, dare scarcely allow themselves the common necessaries of life, for fear of future poverty. I have known a lady of sixty, possest of two or three thousand pounds per annum, actually afraid of dying for want. Those gentry are all under my dominion; besides a very great share of my influence rests on many others, who are grievously op∣prest with troubles which never happen; some are so re∣markably ingenious, as to apprehend difficulties for them∣selves and offspring, for a great many years to come, as if the evil of the day were not sufficient of itself.</P>
<P>Stop, Lunatio, said I, there you touch me sensibly, I will not thus give up my careful subjects. True, replied he, but you and I may play into one another's hands. And al∣though I allow them to be yours, it is easy to see abundance of madness in their disposition and conduct. What wisdom, I pray you, is there in any man's burdening himself to day, with what may or may not happen a twelvemonth hence?
<PB N="327" REF="027249_0325_0FD3ED974907A928"/>Less still in pretending to foresee what may happen in fu∣ture; seeing all future events are locked up in the council of the eternal mind.</P>
<P>From the thinking and careful people, we may descend to the young and frolicsome, who, eager to pry into the cabinet councils of destiny, are duped by daring pretenders to foothsaying and palmistry. As if a designing gipsy, or any other deceiver, could unriddle futurity by the lineature of the hand. There ought to be places provided in Bed∣lam for all the curious, who cannot be satisfied with know∣ing the contents of to-day.</P>
<P>Wisdom will always wish futurity to lie concealed, till occurring events disclose the mysterious page; and moral goodness will never wish to intrude upon the secrets of the Almighty; but rest perfectly satisfied with what is reveal∣ed.</P>
<P>I would also have a place provided either in Bedlam, or St. Luke's, for all who, upon sustaining loss by thieves or otherwise, have recourse to pretended astrologers, and re∣puted conjurers. Every body besides fools knows that the stars are dumb, and cannot speak, or that their prophets do not understand the language of the luminaries. Besides it has a frantic look to suppose that honest Jupiter and old crabbed Saturn, with their lucid brethren, have nothing else to do besides standing centry on this man's horses, that woman's cloaths, the other girl's box, or the farmer's orchard. Indeed, if the stars have any other business to at∣tend, besides watching peoples moveables, they may happen to be busy when certain robberies are committed, and there∣fore cannot give such clear accounts of matters, as their petitioners might wish for; and I think none but mad∣men would spend their money upon such uncertainty.</P>
<P>You are all alike, for laying claim to my subjects, so that I cannot have the honour of my operations. There is my uncle Fastosus, who will suffer no-body so much as to speak to him, unless he happens to be in the humour. He
<PB N="328" REF="027249_0326_0FD3EDB9D8EA6330"/>lays claim to the discontented, whom I could prove by a thousand arguments to be my own disciples. Discontent gives an emphasis to every trouble and aggravates every pain. Would a wise man then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cordially cherish any prin∣ciple, which is sure to be the bane of his own happiness if cherished? To Bedlam, I say, with all the fretful and dis∣contented.—Make haste, provide cells in St. Luke's, for all who are uneasy about their countenance, shape and complexion. A wise man will not be ashamed of external deformity, any more than he will be proud of his come∣ly proportion. And yet Lunatio can have little honour a∣scribed to him.</P>
<P>There are people of property who sink their rents, fall their timber, mortgage their estates, in giving grand enter∣tainments to hungry visitants and hangers-on, after the ex∣ample of Timon of Athens, in order to be thought generous and great. Not once considering, that the nearest way to esteem is still to preserve the golden cord in the hand of the owner. Let all be once spent, the insatiable hangers-on who croud the plenteous table, will drop off like leaves in autumn, and if the wretch retains the loving regard of Argus his dog, he must expect no more. Away with the fool to bediam. He ought to go no longer without shackles.</P>
<P>Parents there are, so doatingly fond of their children, that they strip themselves of heir possessions, in order to make them respectable in the world, long enough before their own lives are at a period; leaving their future support to the good nature and mercy of the dear boy or girl, who it is thought are so well disposed, as to be incapable of in∣gratitude to those who gave them being. But let the dear boy or girl once get the parents estate into their power, and they will give them occasion enough to lament their folly, when every shilling received, shall come with a very intelli∣gible frown. The language of which to the parent is, "I wish you were once in your grave." Such parents ought to be
<PB N="329" REF="027249_0327_0FD3ED999C1865E8"/>provided for at the public expence, and kept in some place of confinement like other lunaties.</P>
<P>Other parents, to avoid falling into that error, which they foresee may be productive of great personal inconvenience; with an equal degree of madness flee into the opposite ex∣treme. They can find in their hearts to part with nothing whilst they live; they will find some plausible pretext or o∣ther, for which they will retain the sole possession of their goods and chattels; rather than give a suitable measure of parental assistance, will suffer the young people to begin the world, under all possible disadvantages. Send such parents to Newgate, I say, for they are worse than mad.</P>
<P>You do me injustice again, Avaro, in claiming the sole power to yourself, over parents, who will oppress their servants, over reach their neighbours, grind the faces of the poor, and sell their souls to the devil, in order to pro∣cure fortunes for their children. This is so far from an∣swering the end proposed, in gaining the love and esteem of the young people, that it has quite a contrary tendency. The greater the estate, the more impatient will the heir ap∣parent be, to be put into quiet possession for himself. The more there is dependant upon the death of a parent, the more eager will children be to have him out of the way. So eager have some been, that they have been obliged to use violence, in order to get the cumbersome old man out of the world. Deliver them up to me, Avaro, for they are all the children of madness. And yet Lunatio is deemed a foolish devil, and a son of idleness.</P>
<P>You are very prone to ascribe to chance or accident, and other such chimerical gentry, works, the honour of which is due only to myself. Ay, you are apt to conclude that there is even no madness in religion. Pride and covetousness may prevail ever so, but you never think of madness. What less than madness is it to worship a wooden Saviour, or a Jesus Christ of man's making? To adore a
<PB N="330" REF="027249_0328_0FD3EDBBA06F4C88"/>god that has been baked in an oven; or to pretend to eat the deity? I could open such a field before you, as would make you wonder at the aboundings of religious madness.</P>
<P>Go with me to the chambers of the sick, and see the works of madness there performed. The lady having over eaten herself at dinner, finding her stomach uneasy, took a glass of brandy to help digestion, after that another, &amp;c. till she is now very ill upon it. The physician is sent for, and after feeling her pulse, asks her a pertinent question or two, as, Do you feel an uneasiness at your stomach, madam? Does your head ach, madam? Have you a thirst upon you, madam? You were taken ill after dinner, were you, ma∣dam?" He prescribes a gentie purgative draught or two, to assist nature to throw off her load, after having thus learn∣ed the cause of her disorder. Now there's an instance of a three-fold madness for you. In the first place, although the food was rich and delicious, it was madness to eat, after na∣ture said it was enough. Secondly, it was madness to pour such a quantity of strong liquor, into a stomach already glutted. And thirdly, it was madness to send for a physi∣cian, seeing she would be well enough by to-morrow noon, by which time nature unassisted might have struggled from beneath its burden. Shall I never have due honour paid to my operations?</P>
<P>This other woman before you, is indeed in a dangerous fever; but she will have no assistance. It is only a deep cold she has caught, and she hopes to get better in a day or two, with care and keeping warm. By and by, when the symptoms of death are actually upon her, the physician must be sent for in all haste.—And when the sever alone is more than nature can sustain, she must have the additional torment of swallowing medicines, even without a possibility of their being of the least service. Is there no madness in this case? Is it not madness to trifle with a disease in its begin∣ning, the only time perhaps in which medicine can afford relief? Is it not equally madness to torment the sick, and
<PB N="331" REF="027249_0329_0FD3ED9AF8947388"/>and throw money away upon the doctor, when the disease is evidently beyond a remedy? And yet you would exclude me from having any share in the government of mankind.</P>
<P>No, Lunatio, returned I, we do not exclude you. We should even be glad to have a full account of your operations in some of our friendly meetings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could give you such an account as would sur∣prise you all, might the honours due to my operations be properly acknowledged. But I cannot stay now, having urgent business in the west end of a certain metropolis.</P>
<P>Pray, cousin, may a brother fiend be acquainted with it? said I: he replied, you know, that almost the one half of the nation is in a starving condition, and are as it were on the tip-toe of rebellion. Yet in a very great strait how to act. They think it hard to famish amidst plenty; to die of hunger whilst the barns are full of corn, and the pastures are well filled with cattle; whilst their govern∣ors can afford to spend thousands at a horse-race, or in an evening's play. On the other hand, they think it hard to be shot at, by those who are murderers by profession; or to be hung up at Tyburn for seeking to procure bread for their families.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, the poor wretches are raising their voices to government, beseeching their lawgivers to spare so much time from their own pleasure and amusement, as to take their wretched case into serious consideration, that they may not die by artificial famine. What I aim at is, to per∣suade those in power to treat their complaints with neglect, and themselves as clamorous uneasy, and turbulent peo∣ple. Instead of redressing their grievances, to threaten them with the strict execution of the laws against rioters. If I am happy enough to gain this point, as I think I shall, we shall soon see the spirit of madness raving all over the nation, and even the wise will become fools.</P>
<P>Oppression you know will make even a wise man mad. Therefore, when their oppressions can no longer be borne,
<PB N="332" REF="027249_0330_0FD3EDBCC10C3040"/>there will go forth a spirit of insurrection among the peo∣ple; and that shall be followed by a spirit of murder, till all the riots are sufficiently quelled, and the leading insurgents punished by death or transportation. Then will follow a spirit of emigration, and every one almost will wish him∣self to have been transported at the expence of government. At this very time, there are not less than five hundred thousand families who are kept in their native country by nothing but the want of means to get cleverly out of it. Neighbouring nations will give all possible encouragement to the poor to settle with them; every opportunity will be ta∣ken to cross the Atlantic, till the nation referred to shall become almost, if not quite depopulated.</P>
<P>Now, the madness of the scheme lies here. The true riches of a nation are its inhabitants, and the grandeur of the great depends wholly on the numbers of those in inferi∣or stations. In proportion therefore to the oppressions of the poor, will the nation decrease in its strength. Every emi∣gration from the mother country, will either increase the number of colonists, or strengthen the hands of natural ene∣mies; of course the neglect of the present complaints will eventually be the entire ruin of the great men themselves, and the translation of the empire to another, and very distant seat. Yet after all, perhaps it will be alledged, that Lu∣natio hath no influence. But I shall raise myself an immor∣tal name, upon my own foundation. I deign no more con∣verse with a grovelling spirit—adieu.</P>

<P>This same Lunatio is a spirit active enough, and we give him due respect; but he is like all his disciples, fixed in his own views, and there is no giving him proper ideas of things. I should be glad, Fastosus, to hear more fully what you were saying last night concerning the Sadducees, it might be informing to these younger devils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, sir, they were a set of deists among the Jews, who, like the modern deists, did not believe that there are any angels good or bad, or shall be any resurrec∣tion
<PB N="333" REF="027249_0331_0FD3ED9E28DD8470"/>from the dead. I did not only persuade the scribes, pharisees, and doctors of the law, to lay aside judgment, mer∣cy and the love of God, in order to establish their own tra∣ditions: but wrought upon the Sadducees to prefer their own reasoning to the plainest declarations of the word of revela∣tion. I assured them, that the well informed author of the book of Job, was under a delusion, when he said by the Holy Ghost, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I shall stand with him at the latter day upon the earth, and although after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in the flesh I shall see God." I persuaded them also, that the prophet Isaiah was under the like mistake, when he foretold, that death shall be swallowed up in victory: as also Daniel who asserted, "that many, who then slept in the dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting dishonour." These, together with the testimonies of all the prophets, I per∣suaded them to reject, merely because they could not com∣prehend them, nor account for it how the dead should rise.— This you know is the very reason why modern deists are pleased, under the same influence, to deny the whole system of revealed truth.</P>

<SPEAKER>DISC.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often feasted my mind on the pleasing prospect of that amazement and surprise, which shall over∣take those infidels, when the avenues of immortality shall open before them; and the terrors of an incarnate, a des∣pised God and Saviour, shall overwhelm them in the floods of horrid despair. Their pretended virtue, their philosophic fortitude, their boasted reason will fail them, when they see, to their everlasting confusion, that he who despiseth the Son, despiseth also the Father who sent him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The deist is my faithful, deluded disciple. Where∣ever you meet with a man of deistical principles, you will easily discern my image at large on his forehead, and my mark on his right hand: Nothing but pride can induce a man, to prefer his own reason to the dictates of sacred Re∣velation.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="027249_0332_0FD3EDBE538427A0"/>
Fastosus here stopt, and seeming in a terrible agitation, thus addrest his brethren. Let us flee my friends—Let us flee—for yonder comes Michael the archangel, and with him a numerous train, with whom we are not able to con∣tend. They instantly took wing, shot through the yielding air, and I saw them no more. Nor am I certain if I shall ever have an opportunity of listening to their friendly con∣ferences again; but if I should, as is not impossible, the public may expect to hear what passes among them, so far as may come to the knowledge of a sincere friend to man∣kind.</P>
