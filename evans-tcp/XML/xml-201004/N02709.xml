<P>NOT having the Opportunity of thy Company, I take this Occasion to confer on the Va∣rious Circumstances of my Life since I left you; in which Voy∣age, as the Beginning of our Sorrows we were robbed by the Pirates, yet through Penury we made our Voyage to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where a Prospect of Pro∣fit offered for this Place; but as all Humane Affairs are uncertain, in the Latitude of 27 <HI>deg.</HI> 34 <HI>min.</HI> and 5 <HI>deg.</HI> 56 <HI>m.</HI> Westing from that Island, our Sloop, after many violent Storms,

sprung a Leak, and in 18 Hours sunk before our Eyes; where we were left to drive before Wind and Sea, in our open Boat; yet through the concur∣ring Mercies of our God, (after eight Days Tossing on the Ocean, on which we failed 170 Leagues) we landed on One of the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, called <HI>Cat-Island,</HI> where with Souls filled with Joy we sang to our Deliverer, rejoy∣cing both in his Judgments and Mer∣cies, who preserved us on the Deep, and provided for us in the Desart, where we lay marooned some Months, until Providence brought us to <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> where I waged with One (esteemed the richest in the Province) in the same Service I was in with You, and he would have bestowed his Bounty on me, but there was that righteous Seed in me, which begs not its Bread, neither would it suf∣fer me to receive more than my Hire, his Riches being the Product of <HI>Negro</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, which would have made me a Debtor and an Op∣pressor

in the Creation; which was so contrary to me, that the Sight and Sense I had of it burdened my Life, which hastened me to these Parts, where the Lord blessed me with Sub∣stance again, which was quickly con∣sumed by the Fire, and I providen∣tially escaped with my Life at your Fair at <HI>Bristol.</HI> And tho' the Chri∣stian Life consists not in Outwards, yet in Commemorating his Providen∣ces to me in the Day of my Humili∣ation, both Inwardly and Outwardly, engages me thankfully to acknow∣ledge his Goodness and Mercies, in that he has again restored me to Ful∣ness and Plenty. And has not the Lord, by his extraordinary Providence, opened this <HI>America</HI> before the <HI>Euro∣peans,</HI> and given us Peace and Plenty among the Natives? and shall we go to <HI>Africa</HI> for Bread, and lay the Bur∣den which appertains to our Bodily Support on their Shoulders?

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friendly Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNDER the Consideration of the Shortness of the Life of Man, and the End for which he was created, engaged my Mind to the Lord that he would make known his Truth unto me, beyond Custom or Tradition in which most content themselves. And though in the Time of Ignorance the Lord winks, and the Sincere in Heart in all Societies and Gatherings are owned by him, yet if he farther manifests himself, who shall withstand him? Tho' in Believing I made not haste, but desired to try all Things, and hold fast by that Universal Love I was then a Witness of, in which I tra∣velled in my Sprit for the Freedom and
<PB REF="003212_0009_0FF01D3222CD35D0"/>
Redemption of the whole Body, as being a living Member thereof; Tho' I am sen∣sible it would much more have been re∣commended to thy Perusal, had it been done by an abler Hand, as many there are under the same Suffering, to the O∣verthrow of the Faith of some. Yet re∣joice not thou over such, but be warned by them, lest thou also fall. Yet to the Glory of the Grace and Power of the Lord, who causes Good to redound from Evil to those that love him (which does not excuse the Evil-Doer) that many have known Deliverance from this Athe∣istical Practice, and the Offence given by it, being thereby drove into the San∣ctuary, where they have seen the Ground and Nature thereof, and the Fruit it brings forth, the End of which is for the Fire; Therefore with a single Eye to the Lord, and as it concerns thy own E∣ternal Welfare, let it have its due weight with thee before thy Day is determined, and receive it as a Token of Love, and in that Simplicity in which it is committed unto thee, in as few Words as my poor
<PB REF="003212_0010_0FF01D348742A868"/>
Capacity and the Ease of my Spirit will admit of, without the least Prejudice to any Mortal, much less to the Cause of the Gospel, or the true Ministers thereof, who are for the Gathering of all Nations into the same Love; and they that despise them in that, despise him that sent them; and they that deny him and his Gospel before Men, them will he also deny before his Father and the Holy Angels: Yet we are forewarned by our Lord, to try the Spirits which would go forth to deceive, if possible, the very Elect; and the A∣postles saw them gone forth from amongst them, recommending the Believers for their Protection against such, to the Holy Unction in them, in which they discern the Voice of the Lord from the Stranger's, who never since his Fall could bear the Light, much less his Instruments, there∣fore it is a sure Defence to the Righ∣teous; for if the Trumpet give not a cer∣tain Sound, who shall prepare for the Battle? Shall such then, who preach Christ in Words, but in Actions are An∣tichrist bring forward the Church, or
<PB REF="003212_0011_0FF01CF5DACF28C0"/>
perfect the Saints Faith, who in this Practice are an Offence to both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and to the Church of God. And let none think this too uncharitable a Judgment, considering the Nature of this Sin, seeing the Least unrepented of is damnable, yet the greatest Sin against Christ as the Son of Man, with true Re∣pentance (which is always accompanied with Forsaking and Restitution) is par∣donable through the great Mercy of our God in his Son, which brings Joy to the very Angels in Heaven, and to his Church and Ministers on Earth, whose Hearts and Souls are open for the Gathering of such unto God.</P>
<P>Our Friend <HI>George Fox,</HI> in a Ser∣mon taken in Shorthand as it was prea∣ched at a Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Barbados,</HI> tho' in the Beginning of Time, when ma∣ny were convinced that had Slaves, he advised them to use them well, and to bring them up in the Fear and Know∣ledge of God, and after a reasonable Ser∣vice to set them free, as we may also see in his <HI>Journal,</HI> pag. 354 which was far
<PB REF="003212_0012_0FF01D37B9A37670"/>
from encouraging them to buy more after their Convincement: For if they had gone back again into that Trade, what had their Convincement done for them, but bring them into greater Judgment for their Disobedience to the Manifestation? For before Friends were a People, many of them were valiant Men with the Sword, for which they were had in great Esteem amongst Men, because thereby they sought the Nation's Deliverance from the Op∣pression of Priests, Physicians and Law∣yers, the One making a Trade of the Soul, the Other of the Body, and the Other of the Property of the People: And when our Friend <HI>George Fox</HI> was called forth by the Lord to minister, not in the Wis∣dom of Man, for in that he was unlearn∣ed, but in the Openings of Truth, which manifested to him wherein all these were out of the Way, and that by the universal Grace all might be restored in their Services, both for the Good of Soul and Body; which caused these Worthies to lay down their Swords, as unfit for the Carrying on of so great a Work,
<PB REF="003212_0013_0FF01D3A37584A08"/>
which must be done by a higher Power, in which they went forth, having the Sword of the Spirit, which gave them Victory over Principalities &amp; Powers, and Spi∣ritual Wickednesses in High Places: And while Friends stood here, testifying against this Practice, and against every Thing that is high and lifted up, as inconsistent with this glorious Day, then did the Work prosper, that large Meetings were settled herein and flourished. But in Time this dark Trade creeping in amongst us, to the very Ministry, because of the Profit by it, hath spread over others like a Leprosie, to the Grief of the Honest-hearted, that they are constrained to so∣journ in Mesech or dwell in the Tents of Kedar, the Habitation of Blood; which the hired Preachers that live by the Law, have testified against, as the highest Im∣morality which some have gone into when all others have failed them, whereby their Hearers have keen convinced by them of the Evil of it. And shall we fall short and lay Waste the Ancient Testimony, which was and is for the Bringing down

<HEAD>A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF THE <HI>Practice of the Times.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. MY FRIEND, Whomsoever Thou art that deals in <HI>Slaves,</HI> or hath had any Fellowship therewith, in the Love of God that desires the Peace and the Restora∣tion of the whole Creation, do I now Salute Thee, that thou mayest consider that Principle and Foundation on which this Practice stands, since for every idle Word we must give an Account, and on all our Actions are established an Eter∣nity, and whomsoever we yield our selves to Obey, his Servants we are, whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Life.</P>
<P N="2">II. For what comes from God, leads unto God; and what comes from the De∣vil
<PB N="2" REF="003212_0016_0FF01D4254D20C30"/>
(who became such by Rebellion) un∣to Death and Hell, where he is Centred; from whom, all Wrath and Violence pro∣ceeded. He was not Created such, nor his Angels, as is observed in the Epi∣stle of <HI>Jude,</HI> that they fell from their first Estate, and from their Habitations God created them in: Which great Fall and Debasement to <HI>Lucifer,</HI> so proud a Spirit that he is termed the Son of the Morning, and being thus defeated in his evil Purpose, raised in him a Princi∣ple of Envy against God, and all the Cre∣ation, which the Lord made very good, according to his own Nature, and made Man the Top of the Creation, a living Soul, an Image of his own Eternity, who is all Love and Goodness in himself, and his Works are accordingly; and while Man stood in this upright Life, all was perfect Peace and Love, throughout the whole Creation of God, until Evil was introduced by the Insinuations of the Ser∣pent, that envy'd the Happiness thereof, and enticed our first Parents to Eat of the forbidden Fruit, that was good of it self, being created by the Lord, but Evil unto them, in that they disobey'd the Holy Commandment. So that the Lord Cre∣ated not Death, neither, has he Pleasure
<PB N="3" REF="003212_0017_0FF01D4719106D78"/>
in the Destruction of the Living, but thro' Envy of the Devil came Death into the World; and they that do hold on his Side, do find it so, drawing it to them, by Disobedience; as <HI>Eve</HI> immediately and <HI>Adam</HI> Instrumentally, giving Ear to the Temptation, whereby the Mind be∣came captivated to Lust, which being Conceived brought forth Sin, and Sin finished brought forth Death, both to the inward and the outward Man, and a Suffering and Degeneracy, throughout the whole Creation, which groans and travels in Pain to be Delivered, even un∣til now, through the Evil Property and barbarous Disposition of the Natural Man; yet through the Mercy and good Will of God, in the Promised Seed of the Woman, he was not thus left, but put in a Capacity of being restored to his Original Purity and Uprightness, where∣by he Governs the Creation, in Love and Tenderness, that they partake of the Benefit of his Redemption.</P>
<P N="3">III. And these two Births are emi∣nently shewed unto us in <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel; Abel</HI>'s Geniture being of the Lord, through the Promised Seed, unto which he was united, gave his Sacrifice Accep∣tance,
<PB N="4" REF="003212_0018_0FF01D48A4A1B368"/>
which raised Envy in <HI>Cain,</HI> who rejecting this high Birth, as many now do, he became One with the Evil Pro∣perty that was introduced by his Father the Devil; and his Works of Violence and Oppression (the height of Wicked∣ness in respect to Men) he brought forth, which in Time spread over the whole Earth, for which the Lord destroyed them by the Deluge: And thus <HI>Cain</HI>'s Race ended, but his Image and Life re∣mains in all them that Act in the same Principle.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Neither can these Negroes be proved, by any Genealogy, the Seed of <HI>Ham,</HI> whom <HI>Noah</HI> Cursed not, saith <HI>Josephus</HI> as being too nigh of Blood: But <HI>Noah</HI>'s Curse on <HI>Canaan</HI> the youngest Son of <HI>Ham,</HI> is thought a suitable original for the Negro Trade: But the Curse is not so extensive, as you would have it, but is thus expressed, <HI>Cursed be</HI> Canaan, <HI>a Servant of Servants shall he be, unto his Brethren.</HI> So that he was to Serve the meanest of the Offspring of <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japheth;</HI> but the Time came that the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were destroyed with a Mighty Destruction, according to the Promise of the Lord, <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> vii. 23. and <HI>Josephus,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003212_0019_0FF01D4B1192A070"/>
Lib. 4. Chap. 8. and other places. And their Land given unto the Seed of <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> as the Lord shewed him in a Vision, when he sojourned therein amongst the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> that then had Possession of it, <HI>Genesis</HI> xii. 6, 7. also <HI>Judges</HI> the v. <HI>De∣borah</HI> in her Song, rejoyces that the very Stars in their Courses fought against <HI>Sisera,</HI> which is more fully expressed by <HI>Josephus,</HI> Lib. 5. Chap. 1. &amp; 6. that the Lord fought against the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> with Hosts of Judgments, until they were destroyed: So that their Race is ended, as well as that Dispensation; how then can these Negroes or Indians be Slaves to Christians, who are the Lord's Free∣men? But if these Negroes are Slaves of Slaves, according to the Curse; Whose Slaves then must their Masters be?</P>
<P N="5">V. It was the Murderous Spirit of the Brethren of <HI>Joseph,</HI> that Sold him to the <HI>Ishmaelites,</HI> the Seed of the Bond-Wo∣man, and they again Sold him into <HI>E∣gypt,</HI> add though they paid for him by Bargain Twenty Pieces of Silver, yet it did not excuse them from Theft, as we may see by the Testimony of that Righ∣teous Man, when in the Dungeon, <HI>Indeed,</HI> (saith he) <HI>I was stoln out of the Land of</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003212_0020_0FF01D4EC6C81198"/>
<HI>the Hebrews,</HI> Gen. xl 15. And those things being Writ for our Learning, let us shun their Sins, that we may escape their Punishments; for God is a God of Justice, by whom Actions are weighed, who regards all his Works, and will Recompence all Wrongs; and it is as consistent with his Justice to Revenge the Cause of the Oppressed, as it is with his Mercy to Reward the Just.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And what greater Unjustice can be Acted, than to Rob a Man of his Liberty, which is more Valuable than Life; and especially after such a manner as this, to take a Man from his Native Country, his Parents and Brethren, and other natural Enjoyments, and that by Stealth, or by way of Purchase from them that have no Right to sell them, whereby thou receivest the Theft, which is as bad. And take them amongst a People of a strange Language, and unnatural Cli∣mates, which is hard for them to bear whose Constitutions are tendered by the Heat of their Native Country; for God that made the World, and all Men of one Blood, that dwell upon the Face of the Earth, has appointed them Bounds of their Habitations, <HI>Acts,</HI> 17.26. Shall we
<PB N="7" REF="003212_0021_0FF01D0BF2B14B80"/>
we then undertake to remove them, wheresoever Interest shall lead us, to sell them for Slaves, Husband from Wife, and Children from both, like Beasts, with all their Increase, to the vilest of Men, and their Offspring after them, to all Eternity: Oh! hard Lot! Oh! Eternal sinking in Iniquity; without Bottom or Bounds, as to the Will of Man, therefore as <HI>Jacob</HI> said, of <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi, In∣struments of Cruelty are in their Habitations; O my Soul, come not thou into their Secret, nor be united in their Assembly; for in their Anger they slew a Man,</HI> (but these have slain many) <HI>Cursed be their Anger, for it is fierce, &amp; their Wrath, for it is cruel,</HI> to keep the Creature thus in Bondage, whereby we entail Sin on our Posterity, <HI>ad Infinitum,</HI> tho' our Saviour says, he that dies therein, where he is gone shall never come. Like the <HI>Jews</HI> when they crucified Christ, de∣sired his Blood might remain on them and their Children; and yet so blind were they, as many are now, thro' being ac∣customed to Sin, that they see not this Trade to be an Evil, tho' it is manifest to a Child in the Light: But if the Light in us becomes Dark, how great is that Darkness, that sees not the Ground and Tendency of this Practice, and the De∣sign
<PB N="8" REF="003212_0022_0FF01D1274EE4B00"/>
of the Enemy against the Church of Christ, in causing the Name of God to be Profaned, and the Truth to be Evil spoken of; as though the Principles thereof led to it; which has Scandalized and hindered the Gospel of Christ a∣mong the Heathen, and Burthened the Upright, and offended tender seek∣ing Souls, and caused them to dwell as alone, from all Societies, where this Practice is indulged, and especially in the Ministry, lest they should have Fellowship with that, that contradicts the Gospel of Christ; and yet desires no∣thing more, than to be One with the Spirits of those that are not defiled with this Iniquity, that now Works in the Mystery, in this Time of Peace, a∣mongst those that pretend to the Dis∣pensation of the Son of God, and yet have not fulfilled the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> un∣to which Negroe Masters would recur for the Justification of their Practice; but let all such be Silent in the Cause of the Gospel, neither let them charge the Law of God foolishly, which expressly forbids either the Stealing of Men, or the receiving them, under the Penalty of Death. <HI>Ex.</HI> 21.16. Therefore deceive not thy own Soul, for according to thy
<PB N="9" REF="003212_0023_0FF01CFC1A2A0368"/>
Sowing so shall thy Reaping be; if to the Flesh, Corruption, but if to the Spirit, Everlasting Life.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Had Friends, stood clear of this Practice, that it might have been answer∣ed to the Traders in Slaves, That there is a People call'd <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> that will not own this Practice in Word or Deed, then would they have been a burning and a shining Light to these poor Heathen, and a Precedent to the Nations throughout the Universe, which might have brought them to have seen the Evil of it in themselves, and glori∣fyed the Lord on our Behalf, and like the Queen of the <HI>East</HI> to have admired the Glory and Beauty of the Church of God. But instead thereof, the tender Seed in the Honest-hearted is under Suf∣fering, to see both Elders and Ministers as it were cloathed with it, and their Offspring after them filling up the Mea∣sure of their Parents Iniquity; which may be suffered till such Time that Re∣compence from him that is just to all his Creatures, opens that Eye the God of this World has blinded. Tho' I would not be understood to pervert the Order of the Body, which consists of Servants and Masters, and the Head cannot say
<PB N="10" REF="003212_0024_0FF01D511B58EE48"/>
to the Foot, <HI>I have no need of thee;</HI> but it is the Converting Men's Liberty to our Wills, who have not, like the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> offered themselves willingly, or by Con∣sent given their Ear to the Door-post, but are made such by Force, in that Na∣ture that desires to Lord it over their Fellow-Creatures, is what is to be ab∣horred by all Christians.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Love to God, and Hospitality to Strangers, was recommended under all Dispensations, <HI>Whereby,</HI> saith the A∣postle, <HI>some have entertained Angels una∣wares,</HI> whose Mission was to the righ∣teous Souls that sought the Good of all Men; as was testified of just <HI>Lot,</HI> that his righteous Soul was grieved with <HI>So∣dom</HI>'s Filthiness, which by the Apostle is linked with Murderers of Fathers, and Murderers of Mothers, and <HI>Men-stealers,</HI> all which by the Law are under the Sentence of Death. And were you so living in the Body as to be sensible of the Suf∣ferings, some Souls go through on this Account, surely you would not be guilty of it, but act as they that shall be judg∣ed by the Law of Liberty. Besides, how can a Christian, zealous for the Name and Cause of Jesus, desire those in
<PB N="11" REF="003212_0025_0FF01D5375E32E68"/>
his Family, that are not of the same Belief with him. Was it not the Mind of <HI>Jo∣shua,</HI> tho' under the Law, that he and his House would serve the Lord.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Also <HI>Abraham,</HI> in whose righ∣teous Seed all the Families of the Earth are blessed, is eminent for his Regard to the Lord's Covenant, in that he cau∣sed all his Houshold, both Children and Servants, whether born in his House, or bought with Money, to be circum∣cised with him, that they might keep the Way of the Lord,<HI>Gen.</HI> xviii. 9. So that herein <HI>Abraham</HI> fought them to the Lord, in the Faith, which was account∣ed to him for Righteousness, and his End was answered, for <HI>Abraham</HI> belie∣ved God with all his House, which, had he come by them as we do by the <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, they would hard∣ly have regarded <HI>Abraham,</HI> or believed in the Lord, or his Ordinance. But does this appear in this Trade, that we seek them to the Lord and his Gospel, or their Liberty and Property to us and our Children, let the Impartial judge, since we go for them for that very End: Therefore you are short of the Law, which must be fulfilled before a higher
<PB N="12" REF="003212_0026_0FF01D55163A4AD8"/>
Dispensation is known, which <HI>Moses</HI> te∣stifyed of, that those Souls that would not obey should be cut off; yet <HI>Moses</HI> was faithful in that Dispensation, in mi∣nistring to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> for their Oppression. And tho' they held <HI>Israel</HI> as an Abomiation, yet it did not excuse them from being overthrown, and brand∣ed accordingly with the Name of the <HI>House of Bondage</HI> throughout all Genera∣tions. And then <HI>Israel</HI> could not offer their Offerings, neither could they sing the Lord's Song in the strange Land, but hung their Harps on the Willows when they were captivated in <HI>Babylon,</HI> whom <HI>John</HI> the Divine saw should be o∣verthrown, as a great Milstone in the Sea. Then will the Saints be glad and rejoice, that have not defiled themselves with any of her Merchandize, the worst of which is Slaves and Souls of Men; and those Virgin Souls, whose Garments are not spotted with the Flesh, but are thus redeemed from the Earth, can sing the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> the Servant of God, and the Song of the Lamb, saying, <HI>Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Al∣mighty! just and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints! Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name! for thou

<P N="10">X. But to return to the Law, that was given to a hard-hearted People, un∣to whom many Things were suffered on that Account, that they made Captives of those they were at War with, and drove out the Inhabitants that possessed the promised Land, which they had for∣feited by their Wickedness; but what is that to us, who are not at War with these Negroes, neither can we say their Country is given unto us, or that we have a Command or a Dispensation for the Trade; (a Permission you have, and so had <HI>Judas</HI> to betray Christ, and so do you betray the Truth for Gain) yet ready are you to fasten on the hardest Thing that was suffered to them, while you pretend to the Dispensation of that Grace and Truth that comes by Jesus Christ.

One became poor, to be sold unto a Brother, or to a Stranger, any of his Kin may redeem him; or, if able, he may redeem himself; and the Price of his Redemption shall be according to the Number of Years to the Year of <HI>Jubilee;</HI> and if he fails of these Opportunities of Redemption, the <HI>Jubilee</HI> shall release him, not only from Servitude, but shall restore him to his Family and Possession.</P>

Or if our Minerals or Manu∣factures were improved by the Labour of such Criminals, they would be a li∣ving Testimony, to warn others by their Bondage and Slavery, and a just Recom∣pence for their idle Practices, which lie

heavy on those that have done us no Wrong: Yet in that Love that cements the whole Creation, and beareth all Things, I would advise my Brethren whether <HI>Indian, Moor</HI> or <HI>Tawney</HI> Slave for whom Christ has suffered, therefore let us his Creatures submit with Patience to what our Lord has permitted in this World, as believing that there is an E∣ternal Region which swallows up this, wherein he will vindicate his Justice. Therefore for his Sake who suffered for us, in whom we may be free indeed, and over the Heads of our Oppressors, and over our present Suffering, whereby we may chearfully, for our little Time here, fulfil our daily Task, and gain the Love of those we are under in the Land of our Captivity, which will prevent evil Words amongst us, and Severity and Cruelty to∣wards us, or otherwise they will treasure up unto themselves Wrath against the Day of Wrath, when we possess a boundless Liberty, in our eternal Habitations, in which we have a large Room when we are centred thereto.</P>
<P>Also if any are under, or liable to be under the Sentence of Death for Theft, let them submit unto it as just unto them, having broken a known Law which ought
<PB N="16" REF="003212_0030_0FF01CED35682A38"/>
to have been obeyed, not only with Re∣gard to the Natural Life, but in an espe∣cial Regard to its striking at Unjustice, which leads to an eternal Death; there∣fore with Submission to the Law of Man, but chiefly with true Repentance before our Lord that was crucified between the Thieves for Sinners, let us, like the pe∣nitent One on the Cross, confess to the Justness thereof for our evil Deeds, and seek unto Him for Mercy, in which Con∣dition he was received into the Lord's Favour; therefore despair not; yet, as the Other was hardned, presume not. Tho' certain it is, they suffered under the Power of Darkness in the <HI>Jews</HI> which rejected the Son to set free <HI>Bar∣rabbas</HI> the Murderer, and they crucified the Thieves, all which is contrary to the express Letter of the Law of God, and the Law of Equity, which goes no far∣ther for Theft than to make Restitution in Substance or Service, which is more fully expressed by <HI>Josephus,</HI> Lib. 4. ch. 8. which our Friend <HI>George Fox</HI> preached in his Time, as answering the Law of <HI>God,</HI> and the just Principle in all, which was before Transgression was, or the Law against Sin was, which is holy just and good in its Ministration of Judgment,
<PB N="17" REF="003212_0031_0FF01CE200821C98"/>
against all Transgression, and is an Evi∣dence to such as break it, how far short they are of the Ministration of Righ∣teousness in the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ, which contradicts not, nor falls short of, but fulfils the outward Law, which is so exact in the Ministration of Justice and Equity, that it ap∣points Breach for Breach, Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, Burning for Burning, and Blood for Blood, and that one Man∣ner of Law shall be as well for the Stran∣ger as for one of their own Country, <HI>Lev.</HI> xxiv. 20. which also commands that they neither vex a Stranger, nor oppress him, seeing they were Strangers in the Land of <HI>Egypt, Ex.</HI> xxii. 21. And it ma∣ny Times occurring that these Strangers the Negroes, have not the same Admi∣nistration of the Law to them as is to others, and that the Whites also are li∣able to the Sentence of Death for Theft, which being contrary to the Law of God, and through the Regard which tender-minded People have to the Life of Man, hinders them from prosecuting the Law on Thieves, or Serving in Offices, or on Juries, tho' best qualified for such Servi∣ces, and would be very glad to the ut∣most of their Power to suppress Theft,

or any other National Evil, but dare go no farther than the Law of God admits of, therefore cannot be instrumental to hurry into Eternity such unhappy Crea∣tures, who being void of the Fear of God, and under the Instigations of the Devil, would rather hazard an untimely Death than be confined to labour for an honest Livelyhood; But when the Sen∣tence of Death is passed on them, and they wait for their eternal Habitations according to their Deeds, the Deceit of the Enemy is then discovered, and his false Supports fall, and they with them, into the most miserable Condition, that they would then be glad of the worst Terms of Labour, which before a small Share for their Crimes (it being the An∣tidote for Idleness) or Captivity, the Re∣verse of Nature, which will subdue the wildest of Creatures) might have pre∣vented, as some Parts of the World have had good Experience of. And these Things bearing upon my Spirit, under Suffering with the Afflicted, that their Cause may be considered; it is not that Sin should be countenanced, which God hath forbidden, but that Judgment may be mixed with Mercy, according to the Law of God, which has such Regard to
<PB N="19" REF="003212_0033_0FF01D5B6DE2EED8"/>
Mercy, which always was to overshadow the Judgment-Seat, that it enjoyns Com∣passion, not only to the Widow and Fa∣therless, and Strangers, and Servants, but even to the inferiour Creatures, tho' they belonged to an Enemy, as <HI>Ex. xxiii.</HI> 4, 5. <HI>If thou meet thine Enemy's Ox, or his Ass, going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again; and if thou see the Ass of him that hateth thee, lying un∣der his Burden, thou shalt surely help with him.</HI> And the 12th Verse, <HI>Six Days thou shalt do thy Work, and on the Seventh Day thou shalt rest, that thine Ox and thine Ass may rest.</HI> But perhaps thou'lt say then, <HI>Doth God take Care for Oxen?</HI> Yes, verily, the Law hath so guarded against the hard-hearted <HI>Jews,</HI> that it tenderly regards the very Birds of the Air, that if thou find one of their Nests by the Way as thou goest, that the Dam should not be taken with the Young; and tho' five of them should be sold for one Farthing, yet not without the Father, unto whom every Hair of our Head is numbred; then if I abuse one of them, will it not groan unto its Creator, who made it of his good Pleasure, and every Thing that hath Breath gives him Praise; who when he was intreated for <HI>Nineveh,</HI>

A good Man, saith <HI>Solomon,</HI> is merciful to his Beast: The Beast serves us, and should we not be ungrateful for their Service if we take not due Care of them: For the Nature and Spirit of a Man may be known by his Government over the inferior Creatures, which the Lord created for his Glory, and the Ac∣commodation of Man. And should not we, in Love and Thankfulness to him that made them (in which Sense we are Brethren) and in Gratitude for their Ser∣vice, take Care that they have Food and Rest, and what else is convenient for them? and not only for our own Profit, but from a Principle of Justice in my self: For should I receive Benefits from them, and yet be so barbarous as to de∣ny them what is necessary, then certainly I have estrayed from the righteous Law of <HI>God</HI> written on my Heart. And if I should kill or torment any of God's

The Creature made not it self, nor was it cre∣ated in vain. Neither should we oppress the Creation, by coveting to winter more Creatures than we have provided suffi∣ciently for. Would this be doing as we would be done by? Were we going a Voy∣age to Sea, would we not lay in Store for the worst Weather and the longest Time? in which Duty the very Bee and the Ant are Instruction to us; and shall we want Wisdom, or neglect to provide for the Creatures under our Charge, when our Interest is bound up therein? Neither should we deface their Beauty, by Cut∣ting off their Ears, or other Ornaments which God has given them, according to his Law in Nature, for Defence from Flies and Weather; and yet we go to the very <HI>Indies</HI> for Fans and Umbrella's, which are for the same Service to us; for which the very <HI>Indians</HI> upbraid us, for Robbing the Creatures of their natu∣ral Covering, and yet cover our selves

with borrowed Hair, which is unnatural, which shews the great Degeneracy &amp; Fall of Man from his first Creation; but as Man comes to be restored again thereto, thro' Christ, he acts in that Nature, which can∣not exert it self otherwise than in pure Love and Tenderness towards all the Creation of God. And were we come to this innocent Life, of doing as we would be done by throughout all the Creation, whereby we could not inculcate any Principles in our Children, that proceed from the wrathful Nature, then should we much more enjoy our selves, and they would easily be subdued by Love, which universally governs without a Sword, so that the very dumb Creatures have a Sense of it, and are governed by such in Peace, not finding Matter to raise the wrathful Nature in them: For as Love begets Love, so does Wrath beget Wrath, and they that take up the Sword shall perish by it: So that every Sin brings its own Suffering; as we may observe by our neighbouring Province of <HI>South-Ca∣rolina,</HI> when the Inhabitants in their Commerce with the <HI>Indians,</HI> would force their Wives or Captives from them, tho' for Debt, for which they sold them for Slaves; which when the <HI>Indians</HI> beheld,

it soon raised the same Property in them, to the Loss of many Lives, and the de∣molishing of their Situations; and many fled in Canoes and Periagua's to Sea for Safety, rather than expose themselves to the Fury of the <HI>Indians;</HI> who before were a peaceable People to them that were in Peace; which gave <HI>Robert Bar∣row</HI> and Company Victory over them, and was their Safeguard beyond the Sword, and remains so throughout all Generations; which gave them Occasion to bless the Lord, who removed their <HI>Indian</HI> Captive by Death, that nothing might appear to contradict that Love which united us in the Beginning as Bre∣thren, by whom we were supported, which in Gratitude makes them near un∣to us, who made Room for us without Resistance, as a Land given unto us by the Providence of God, which the Sword could never have done; and they as a wise People perceived these Things, and may judge many of us, that have betray∣ed their Innocency by our evil Exam∣ple, being derogated from that Love which might have been a Means of Bap∣tizing them into the Nature of the Gos∣pel, both the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> also, which excepts not nor despises any for

their Complections: Remember <HI>Miriam</HI> was smote for it with a Leprosy, tho' under the Law, being gone from the Testimony, which is the same in Male or Female, White or Black, whereby we are brought into Favour with the Lord; as in the Time of the Prophets, when <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was under Suffering in the Dungeon, the only Interceder for his Liberty was <HI>Ebedmelech.</HI> the <HI>Ethi∣opian,</HI> for which he was singularly in the Lord's Favour, and rewarded according∣ly, as one that put his Trust in the Lord, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxix. 18. Also under the Gospel, there was not the least Exception against the believing <HI>Ethiopian</HI>'s partaking of the Priviledge of Baptism; therefore let us not forbid or hinder them to be baptized, but stand clear of these Things, which the righteous Seed throughout the Uni∣verse (which makes up the true Church) is redeemed from, who are in the Faith that a more general Purgation will be, whereby numberless Numbers will be brought in, and the Lyon's Nature will be subdued by the Lamb's, that the Child may play with the Asp at the Mouth of the Cockatrice's Den; for not any Thing hurts or destroys in this Prin∣ciple, neither makes afraid. But what
<PB N="25" REF="003212_0039_0FF01D68CC2A6910"/>
have they to do with Peace, who would impose that on another they would not bear themselves? Did not they lay a Precedent to the <HI>Indians,</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to do to them as they had done to other Nations? And what can we say against Bondage for Bondage? Which caused the Legislative Power, wisely to make Laws against making or receiving <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, seeing the Evil Ground, and the Fruit it brought forth; for every Principle acts in its own Centre in Nature, as the Loadstone draws what has Affinity with it self. So when the Sun draws up the Clouds from the Sea, which empty themselves over the Uni∣verse, how industriously does it center towards the Ocean again, from whence it was raised, and had its own Being. So what has its Original from Covetousness, which is the Root of all Evil, and so leads to Wrath and Violence to effect it, must needs leaven us into the same Na∣ture, that we may support it by the same Power; therefore we cannot expect That to be blessed to us, which is the Product from an Evil Root, for then Satan would be divided against himself.</P>

Tho' I am sensible that some well-meaning People have unthinkingly run into it, neglecting the Oracle of God, have looked at others, and especially those who have presumed to mention the Lord's Name, and to take his Cove∣nant into their Mouths, who are the greatest of Deceivers, and have betrayed them into this Practice, as if it was no Evil, till they have seen their own Cap∣tivity and Bondage, and that they have been led astray by the others Hypocrisy, &amp; then they would gladly have been clear, and to have come to their former Con∣dition; for whose Sakes am I thus con∣cerned, that you may wait upon the Lord to know his Will concerning you, who is able and willing to help the Sin∣cere out of it, that would freely part with all for his Sake, and their own Re∣demption, knowing that Sin must bear his Judgments, that we fall not short of his Mercies; for how can any Man in this Gospel Dispensation, whose Con∣science is not seared, die in Peace, to leave these poor Creatures in such un∣happy Circumstances; for though their Matter might grant them all Enjoyments but Liberty, how does he know what

Therefore let us wait for Access to the Throne of Grace, that we may have Admittance to the Balance of the Sanctuary, to weigh these Things; and then put in thy Lordliness and Riches, and Estates founded on Op∣pression; and tho' thou hast built a Town with Blood, and established a City with Iniquity; and thou could'st put in the Glory of the whole World, which pas∣seth away, and is but according to the Prince of the Power of the Air; and then see if it will answer to the Loss of eternal Riches, to thy Soul, which cost

As this Trading in Souls bespeaks; as tho' the rational Soul, created and infus'd by the Lord in Man, which distinguishes him from the Beast, could be confined to a Body of Earth, or extinguished with it; tho' we see, the nigher the Body is to its Dissolution, the more sensible and apprehensive is the Soul of its eternal Duration, in a Ha∣bitation suitable to its Nature, and to what it hath witnessed and had Unity with, in the earthly Tabernacle, which

these Things whereby we should crucify him afresh, and put him to open Shame, and deny his Gospel, which brings Life and Immortality to those that obey the Light thereof; a Measure of which is given to every Man, to make known the Mystery, which from the Beginning of the World hath been hid in God, who created all Things by Jesus Christ, who in the Beginning moved by his Spirit on the Face of the Deep, for the carrying on and perfecting of the outward Crea∣tion; so he moveth in our Hearts by his Spirit for our new Creation in Christ, whose first Appearance may be as a Grain of Mustard-Seed against Sin, yet as the first Work of Faith we are to believe in it, as a Measure of the Revelation of Christ, which was promised should first reprove for Sin, which was in order to bring those that obey it out of Sin; whereby, like the Leaven in the Meal, we may be changed into its Nature, by which we encrease in the Faith, and the Comforts thereof are known; which can∣not proceed from Nature, because it con∣tradicts the Natural Man, which wars a∣gainst it, to keep the Creature in Bon∣dage to Lust: Neither will the Devil re∣prove for Sin; for then Satan would war

against himself. Therefore let us not despise the Day of small Things, but love the Appearance of the Spirit, till Christ is formed in us; that being bap∣tized into his Death, we may be made Partakers of his holy Life, and blessed Resurrection; and then shall we know, not only the Imputing, but the Impart∣ing and Partaking, of the Blood, which is the Life; and the Life of Christ infu∣sed in Man, gives Light to manifest what is contrary to the Mind of Christ, and gives Victory over the World, the Flesh and the Devil, that he should not miss of Salvation by it that abides in it. But some will say, Revelation is ceased; for whose Sakes have I thus simply deliver∣ed my Sense thereof, as believing it the Foundation of all true Religion: For if Revelation is ceased, the true Know∣ledge of God, and of Christ, is ceased; for, saith the Text, <HI>No Man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him;</HI> and no other Founda∣tion can any Man lay, than that which is already laid, which was the Founda∣tion of all the Righteous Generations, who drank of the same Rock on which the Church stands; not on <HI>Peter</HI> who was a Man, in whom, as such, we are

But this is not to be while the Devil rules in the Children of Disobedience; yet let us that profess (as all true Christians are) to be led by the Spirit of God, which changes not, but as in the Beginning, so does now lead those that obey it into all Truth, which selected them from the World. to bear their Testimonies against the Cor∣ruptions of the Times, and to confess, and proclaim many excellent Doctrines of the universal Redemption by the Grace of God, unto which they directed us, and recommended their Testimonies as a Safe∣guard to us from Deceivers, by which there is an infallible Discerning of Spirits, and discovers the Ground and Tendency of every Thought and Principle, where∣by we come forward to Perfection, ac∣cording to the Measure of the Gift of Christ, that is perfect, which to the Glo∣ry of the eternal Truth, of God is own∣ed, thro' that Power that raised Jesus,

as the first Fruits of the Resurrection from the Dead, who is the Well-Spring of all our Mercies, thro' his Blood, and is ascended on high, making Intercession for us, and has given Gifts unto Men for their Perfection. But what hast thou to do with this Dispensation, that hast not discerned thy own Spirit and Condition? How shalt thou minister to Spirits in Pri∣son? Thou, that teachest a Man should not steal, but work with his Hands the Thing which is good; and yet dost thou become a Receiver, which by the out∣ward Law is judged together? and blame <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Babylon</HI> for Oppression, and yet be guilty of the same Practice? As nothing is more hateful than Oppression, which will make a wise Man mad, so what can more contradict it self, than to deny the Use of the Carnal Sword, and yet receive of the Prey, which at best is but gained by the Power thereof? So that this Trade is far wide of Friends Principles in the Beginning; and is so to all them that are led by the same Truth: And shall we be so implicit, as not to see so unjust a Practice, which the darkest Times or Apostacy has not exceeded? To what Purpose then is it to such to pretend to a Reformation? But it is not

so with the Honest-hearted, that mourns with them that mourns, and suffers with the Sufferers, even in the natural Body, and much more in the spiritual Body, that nothing might be suffered in the Mi∣nistry of the Gospel that sacrifices to an Idol, which hurts the tender Conscience that has a Zeal for the Promotion of the Truth, knowing that the Luke-warm the Lord will spue out of his Mouth, unto which he will not return: Which is an Answer to those, who finding that their Testimonies against Oppression return upon their own Heads, they would have this Practice left passive, as if a Man's Liberty was a Matter indifferent: But, Beloved, was it your own Case, you would then make it, as indeed it is, the weighty Matters of the Law, Judgment, Justice, and Charity which is Love, which is the greatest of all.</P>

well known that the Ground of this Trade had no such Intention; however our Saviour's Rule discovers it, <HI>By the Fruit the Tree is known,</HI> which produces amongst us no such Consequence; for how should you be Instruments to gain them to the Gospel, who have joined, or had Fellowship with their Enemies in Countenancing the Trade, by receiving of the Benefit; but Christ's Church will not be built up by that Power, who is able to take the Kingdom from others, and give it unto them.</P>

So might the Masters of the Gally-Slaves answer; But if it is so, it were better to lose that Life, that we may find a Life in Righ∣teousness; which I am sensible, in the lowest Ebb of Poverty, cannot submit to any unjust Means for a Living, and yet begs not its Bread, but knows its Sup∣port

port from the Providence of God, which causeth the Grass to grow for the Cattle, upon whom the Eyes of all Creatures wait, and he gives them their Food in due Season; who opens his Hand, and satisfies the Desire of every living Thing; and shall we distrust this Providence, who are under the Gospel, unto whom the Promise is, if we seek the Kingdom and the Righteousness thereof, all other Things shall be added; sufficient for the Day is the Evil thereof; and much more the Ministers of the Gospel who are to live by it; for surely, if you overflow in Spirituals, that you are able to mini∣ster unto the Church for the Good of Souls, you need not go back to the Heathen for Support in Temporals: Yet if these Things offered are contrary to the Openings of Truth in any Soul, let not such be wanting in tender Love to inform me better; which I have endea∣voured in a private Manner, but recei∣ved not the least Satisfaction of its Con∣sistency with either Nature, Reason, Humanity, or Morality, and much less with Christianity: Therefore, because of the Love that I bear to Truth and Just∣ice, it remained as a Burden to my Life,

until I in some Measure, according to my weak Capacity, expressed my self af∣ter this Manner, to lay open the Ground and Nature thereof, as a Caution to those that have not considered it, and that I might discharge my Conscience, before I go hence, as a Duty incumbent to my Brethren; that we may all see our Place and Service in the Creation, during our short Abode in Time, that nothing may hinder our Happiness to Eternity; and tho' some should resist the Truth until their Understandings become dark to that Principle, which would have dis∣covered it fully unto them, in the Day of their Visitation, yet the Truth and its Witnesses will be clear of their Blood; tho' their Loss, as <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s, may be lamented, in that they have resisted so many Visitations of the Love of God; whereby they might, as pruned Branches, have shewn forth the Work of the Hus∣bandman, and displayed unto the Hea∣then throughout the Earth, the Nature of the Vine that bore them; and then Beautiful would they have appeared un∣to them, being shod with the Prepara∣tion of the Gospel of Peace, but terrible as an Army with Banners, against the

Whore and all her unrighteous Merchan∣dize. But how is this Beauty defaced, by thine Eye becoming evil towards thy Brother, which hath darkned thy whole Body; and by how much thou hast been enlightned, by so much the more art thou become dark, or thou wouldst have un∣derstood, that all Unrighteousness is shut out of the Kingdom; How then shall the Unrighteous teach, or oversee, or discipline the Church, that have not ru∣led for God in their own Houses, but have mixed with the Heathen for Ad∣vantage, until they have lost the Savour of the Gospel; which hath been the greatest of Sorrows to those, that are sensible from whence such are fallen, and for all that are concerned or suffer by the Trade. If <HI>David</HI> so much lamented for the Fall of one beloved <HI>Jonathan,</HI> how shall the very Earth mourn for the Fall of Multitudes that are born of her! And much more let such Priests or Teachers, that have not preached a better Doctrine than this, either in Precept or Example, let them mourn between the Porch and the Altar, that if it may please the Lord who is Rich in Mercy, to work their Redemption, left while they preach to

Ah! my Friends! the Consideration of these Things hath been Sorrow of Heart (beyond what may be mentioned) to those that have consider∣ed the Worth of Souls. Let such be∣hold and see, if there is any Sorrow to be compared to it; which I would ra∣ther have chosen to have bewailed in the Wilderness, were it the Lord's Will, than thus to have appeared against a Crime so much in Request; which pro∣motes Idleness in the Rich, being fur∣nished with Slaves, that it hinders the Poor from Bread; which are Evils in the Commonwealth, and no Doubt had their due Weight with our late Assembly, who in a great Measure have discountenanc'd the Trade, which has given them Honour in the Hearts of the Just, who are refreshed thereby, whose Sup∣plications are to the Lord, that he would prosper the Work in their Hands, and rejoice that there are those that seek the Good of both Church and State.</P>

The Sense of it hath burdened my Life Night and Day, to behold such go into it, to the corrupting of the World, that they see no Harm in selling them at Vendues like Beasts, in a Christian Country, where we are called forth in∣to that Power thro' which we might have kept it out of both Church and State, which now does more Hurt amongst us than either <HI>Atheists</HI> or <HI>Deists:</HI> And this I offer as a true Witness; that it were better we had never known the Truth, than afterwards to charge Sin on it, as tho' it admitted of such Practices.
