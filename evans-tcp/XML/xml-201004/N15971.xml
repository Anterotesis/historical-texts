<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest Writers of the present Age having thought pro∣per to write the Lives and Characters of great and famous People, I see no Reason why I may not employ myself
<PB N="vi" REF="020440_0003_0FAF0A45B75F75F8"/>in writing the Lives and Character, of little Masters and Misses; and I will be bold enough to say, that I make not the least Doubt of my little Read∣ers finding more Improvement and A∣musement from this Volume, than they would from the Perusal of one of those huge Works, which would take them a great Part of their Lives to read through, and cost them five hundred Times as much as this.</P>

In this little Work I shall notice the Conduct and Behaviour of such young Gentlemen and Ladies, whose good Sense and Prudence render them highly worthy of Imitation; nor shall I spare to censure those, whose Stubbornness, Ob∣stinacy, or Naughtiness, render them necessary to be held forth to publick No∣tice as a Caution to all good Children, and to remind them, that, if they be∣have amiss, I shall lay their Faults be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>

<HEAD>Miss BETSEY ALLGOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pretty little Miss, though now but in the seventh Year of her Age, has more Thought and Prudence than many at seventeen. She works at her Needle to Admi∣ration, reads like a little Queen, and writes a very pretty Hand. How far she has improved in the Art of Drawing, the Specimen in the next Page will shew.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="020440_0005_0FAF0A46B0199D28"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>However pretty these Accomplish∣ments may be considered, yet they are but trifling when compared with the Graces of her Mind; I mean, her good and pretty Behav∣iour. She never laughs at those who may not happen to know so much as herself, but she endeavours to instruct them; she is not satisfied
<PB N="11" REF="020440_0005_0FAF0A46B0199D28"/>with telling them that such a Thing was done wrong, but she endeavours to tell them how to do it right.</P>
<P>So great is her Reputation among all her little Friends and Neighbours, that whenever any Dispute happens among them which they cannot set∣tle themselves, Miss Betsey is always applied to, to make up the Matter, and her Decision is never disputed by either Party.</P>
<P>Miss Betsey says her Prayers con∣stantly every Night and Morning, and says Grace before and after Meat. She never attempts to con∣tradict her Papa or Mamma, but cheerfully does every Thing she is bidden to do. By these Means she pleases every one around her, and is herself perfectly happy; for it is
<PB N="12" REF="020440_0006_0FAF0A47A0B11078"/>impossible for a Child to be happy, who is perpetually whining and pi∣ning after every Thing, and equal∣ly restless and unhappy even if it gets what it asks for.</P>
<P>Miss Betsey's Pap and Mamma were wise People, and often remark∣ed, that the Pervisity of Children is oftentimes more owing to the Mis∣management of Parents, than to the Children themselves. When Chil∣dren cry for any Thing, it should never be given them; because, if they get it by that Means, when they want any Thing that is impro∣per for them, they will think they have only to cry, and then they will obtain it.</P>
<P>Thus you see, my pretty little Readers, that Miss Betsey never
<PB N="13" REF="020440_0006_0FAF0A47A0B11078"/>cries for any Thing she wants, nor asks for any Thing a second Time, which has been once denied her. By this good Behaviour, Miss Bet∣sey has acquired so great a Reputa∣tion, as will never be forgotten so long as a Leaf of this Book shall hold together.</P>

<HEAD>Master BILLY BAD-ENOUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Gentleman is one of those Kinds of Characters which even we little great Writers find it difficult to describe; because there is in his Composition such a strange Mixture of Goodness and Naughtiness, as in some Degree per∣plexes us in what Light to place him.</P>
<P>Master Billy Badenough was hap∣py in having the best of Parents, who spared no Expence to give him the best Education; and, it must be confessed, no Boy studied his Book closer or better, or made a more ra∣pid Progress than he did. At the Age of nine Years, he could read, write, and cast Accounts with any
<PB N="15" REF="020440_0007_0FAF0A488EF44328"/>one, had made some Progress in Latin and French, and understood some little Matters in Geography. He was very goodnatured, and rea∣dily parted with any Thing to his Playfellows.</P>
<P>These were his good Qualities; and I could wish I were not under the Necessity of repeating his bad ones; but you know that we little Biographers must speak the Truth, and conceal nothing.</P>
<P>One of his principal Faults was, that of robbing Orchards. It was but the other Day, that Mr. John Goodwell caught him in his Orch∣ard, hanging with his whole Weight upon one of the Boughs of a Fruit-Tree, in order to break it off, and carry away both the Bough and the
<PB N="16" REF="020440_0008_0FAF0A490D7C50F8"/>Fruit thereon. This is an exact Representation of the Matter.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>He was fond of going a Birdnest∣ing; and, indeed, there would have been no Harm in this, had he, like good Boys in general, taken Care of the poor innocent little Things, and fed them; but it was his Rule sel∣dom
<PB N="17" REF="020440_0008_0FAF0A490D7C50F8"/>to bring home any. Some he would throw into Ponds and Riv∣ers, and was even so hard-hearted and naughty, as to stand and laugh at the poor dear little Things while they were drowning and struggling for Life. Others, that could nei∣ther fly nor walk, he would set up∣on the Ground, and shy at them with Sticks until he had killed them, and even the few that he brought home, he took no Care of them, but suffered them to die for Want. This, however, is so melancholy a Subject that I cannot pursue it.</P>
<P>His Papa, finding he was guilty of these, and many other naughty Tricks, such as kicking up Boys Heels on the Ice, and fighting with every one who gave him the least
<PB N="18" REF="020440_0009_0FAF0A4B6778EB60"/>Offence, determined him to send him to Sea, for which Purpose he is now learning Navigation. Should he happen to be cast away on a de∣sert Island, how can he expect to re∣ceive Mercy, who has shewn so lit∣tle to poor innocent Birds? But, I hope, as he grows older, he will grow better, and repent.</P>

<HEAD>Miss NANCY CAREFUL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pretty little amiable young Lady had the Misfortune to lose her Mamma when she was on∣ly four Years of Age, and to add to her Calamities, she had hardly reach∣ed her seventh Year, when she fol∣lowed her dear Papa to his Grave. There certainly cannot be a greater Misfortune happen to little Ones, than the early Loss of their Parents. Miss Nancy was truly sensible of this. Her Papa and Mamma lay buried in the same Tomb; and this dear little Girl would often sreal a∣way from the House of her Guard∣ian to seat herself upon their Grave and water it with her Tears. Can
<PB N="20" REF="020440_0010_0FAF0A4C7121FCD8"/>you view this Picture, and not join in letting fall a Tear with Miss Nancy Careful?</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>She had, however, poor little Maiden, two Things which contri∣buted to console her under these terrible Misfortunes: The first was that she lived in the House of her
<PB N="21" REF="020440_0010_0FAF0A4C7121FCD8"/>Guardian, who faithfully discharg∣ed the Trust reposed in him; and secondly, that she had an only Bro∣ther, who was worthy of such a Sister, and who did every Thing in his Power, to make her forget the terrible Loss they had both sustain∣ed; but I shall forbear saying any Thing here of that little Gentle∣man, as I shall particularly speak of him in the next Article of this my invaluable Work.</P>
<P>Miss Nancy not only attended closely to her Book and her Needle, but hardly ever spent an idle Mo∣ment; and so attentive was she to improve herself in all useful Knowledge, that her Guardian was frequently obliged to force her out upon Visits, lest she should hurt
<PB N="22" REF="020440_0011_0FAF0A4CB38E93F0"/>her Health by too close an Appli∣cation to what she considered as her Duty. This, my pretty little Rea∣ders, you know, is a very uncom∣mon Case.</P>
<P>Before the had reached the Age of ten Years, there was hardly any Youth in the Neighbourhood, ei∣ther Master or Miss, who could read, write, spell, and cast up com∣mon Accounts with her; and, with∣out mentioning her Excellency in the finest Needle-work, her Pastry, Pickles, and Preserves, were justly admired by all the Gentry for many Miles round.</P>
<P>All these Things considered it is no Wonder that a young Gentleman in those Parts should pay Miss Nan∣cy a Visit on her reaching her nine∣teenth
<PB N="23" REF="020440_0011_0FAF0A4CB38E93F0"/>Year. He found she pos∣sessed an uncommon Share of good Sense, Meekness, and Affability, without the least Tincture of Pride or Affectation. He soon married Miss Nancy, who now rides about in her Coach, admired by her Husband, beloved by her Friends, and envied only by those who do not possess her Virtues.</P>

<HEAD>Master SAMMY CAREFUL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Gentleman is the Brother of the Lady, whose Cha∣racter I have just given. He is two Years older than his Sister, and is worthy of the best Thing that can be said of him.</P>
<P>On the Death of his dear Papa, he felt the keenest Agonies, and was truly sensible of his Loss; but when he saw his poor little dear Sister's Heart ready to burst with Tears and Grief, he thought it became necessa∣ry in him to stifle his own Sorrows, in order to alieviate those of his Sister.</P>
<P>He would now and then cry with her, with a View to humour her; then he would suddenly wipe the
<PB N="25" REF="020440_0012_0FAF0A4D8DF16D70"/>Tears from her Cheeks, and reason with her on the Impropriety of their making themselves miserable about what they could not recover, and which would even make their Parents unhappy in Heaven, did they know it. When Sammy found he had thus consoled his Sister, whom he most tenderly loved, he would him∣self steal out into the Fields set him∣self down at the Foot of a Tree, and there have his Cry out by himself. My pretty Readers do not your little beating Hearts feel an uncommon Emotion at the Sight of the Picture in the next Page? May you never have Occasion to do the like!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="020440_0013_0FAF0A4E808CEE20"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>As Master Sammy had always been a very sober and careful Child, and very attentive to his Books, it is no Wonder that he proved, in the End, to be an excellent Scholar.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when he had reach∣ed the Age of fourteen, Mr. William Goodall, a wealthy Merchant in the
<PB N="27" REF="020440_0013_0FAF0A4E808CEE20"/>City of Boston, took him into his Compting house, in order to bring him up in the mercantile Way, and thereby make his Fortune.</P>
<P>This was a sad Stroke upon his poor Sister Nancy, who, after having lost both her Papa and Mamma, was now likely to lose her Brother like∣wise; but Sammy did all he could to appease her, and assured her, that he would spend all his leisure Time with her. This he most punctually performed, and never were Brother and Sister so happy in each other's Company as they were.</P>
<P>Mr. William Goodall was highly satisfied with Sammy's Behaviour, and, dying much about the Time that Miss Nancy was married to the Gentleman, he left all his Business
<PB N="28" REF="020440_0014_0FAF0A4EF04BC8E8"/>to Sammy, together with a large Capital to carry it on. So much is Mr. Careful esteemed, (for we must now no longer call him Master Sam∣my) that he was chosen, at the late general Election, Representative in the General Court, for one of the first Towns in New-England, with∣out the least Expence to himself. We here see what are the Effects of good Behaviour.</P>

<HEAD>Miss FANNY DAUDLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Lady was an only Child, and therefore, as is too often the Case, was a ruined one; that is, was suffered to do just what she liked, without any one being permitted to contradict her. There was no such Thing as getting her to Bed at Night, or up again in the Morning; for Miss Fanny was said to have so weakly a Constitution, that she could not bear to be forced to any Thing.</P>
<P>This young Lady in her infant Years, had every Appearance of a good Constitution, and never could more Pains have been taken to spoil it. She was covered with a Load
<PB N="30" REF="020440_0015_0FAF0A4FAD532A28"/>of Clothes, in order to keep her warm, and prevent her from taking Cold. They were constantly feed∣ing her with the richest Things, in order to nourish her, and make her strong, as they thought; and she was not put upon her Legs until she was eighteen Months old.</P>
<P>In spite of all these Precautions, however, at the Age of six Years, Miss was crooked both in her Legs and Shape, owing, no Doubt, to the very Means they took to prevent it, and this undoubtedly was a Fault of her Friends, and not her own, for which she was much to be pitied, as are all unfortunate Children, who are ruined by the mistaken Kindness of their Friends.</P>
<P>It would have been unpardonable
<PB N="31" REF="020440_0015_0FAF0A4FAD532A28"/>in me to take notice of these personal Defects, had not the Imperfections of her Mind been still greater. Though she seldom arose until Noon, yet great Part of the remain∣ing Day was spent in this Manner on the Couch.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>So little Time was spent on her Book, that even at six Years of Age
<PB N="32" REF="020440_0016_0FAF0A521E705FA8"/>she could hardly tell a great A from a House; and whenever she was de∣sired to take a Needle in her Hand, she was instantly overcome with the Vapours. She was hated by all the Servants, to whom she was a con∣stant Plague; and very few of the young Ladies in the Neighbourhood chose to visit her, because she was no less peevish and obstinate than she was proud and ignorant. It was in one of these obstinate Hu∣mours, and merely out of Contra∣diction to the Advice of every one, that she determined to take a Walk out one Day, though it rained much. The Consequence of this was, that she caught a violent Cold, which brought on a Fever, and put and End to her Life in the twelfth Year of her Age.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="020440_0016_0FAF0A521E705FA8"/>
This plainly shews you, my little Readers, how necessary it is to be industrious in every Thing else, as well as your Book; since Idleness and Obstinacy are equally pernicious to those who give Way to them.</P>

<HEAD>Master BILLY EASY.</HEAD>
<P>MY pretty little Readers, when they shall be grown up to Years of Maturity, will have too many Occasions to observe, that it is as great a Misfortune to be of too easy a Temper, as to be of too vio∣lent a one, and here is an unhappy Instance of it.</P>
<P>Master Billy Easy had always been considered by his Parents as a very dutiful and obedient Son, and they had conceived great Hopes from so promising a Child. He paid every due Attention to his Book, minded what was said to him, and readily and cheerfully did every Thing he was bidden. If these were not pro∣mising
<PB N="35" REF="020440_0017_0FAF0A53255D9CE0"/>Circumstances in his Favour, I know not what may be considered as such; but such are the unsettled Matters of this Life, that there is no answering for any Thing, or for any Body.</P>
<P>Master Billy, in the tenth Year of his Age, unfortunately got acquaint∣ed with a Boy of a very naughty and bad Turn of Mind, who made use of very bad Expressions, told Fibs immoderately, and was always at the Head of every Kind of Mischief that was going forwards. Billy Ea∣sy was of a Disposition, which, like Wax, might be moulded into any Form; and, had he happened to fall in good Company, he would un∣doubtedly have learned Good from them.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="020440_0018_0FAF0A5370371420"/>
<HI>Lead us not into Temptation,</HI> is a Part of our Lord's Prayer, and a very ne∣cessary one it is. Master Billy be∣came the constant Companion of this naughty Boy, who led him into all kinds of Errour; and so powerful was the Force of bad Example over him, that he was often drawn into the Commission of those Crimes which his Heart disapproved, but he could not withstand the Temptation.</P>
<P>He was frequently concerned in fobbing Orchards, and even stealing Fruit wherever he could find it. At last he became so naughty as to take up and put in his Pocket the loose Halfpence his Papa or Mamma happened to leave any where. It will be too disagreeable to me to re∣late every Circumstance, which at
<PB N="37" REF="020440_0018_0FAF0A5370371420"/>last determined his Parents to send him to Sea, in order to avoid more <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>disagreeable Consequences. They did so, and poor Billy Easy perished in a Storm, and had a watry Grave.</P>
<P>My dear little Readers, be cau∣tious of bad Company. Resist the first Temptation to evil, and you
<PB N="38" REF="020440_0019_0FAF0A5431E3DDA8"/>will then have nothing to fear; but if you give Way to tristing Crimes, greater ones will steal on you insen∣sibly, and you will even arrive at the highest Degree of Naughtiness be∣fore you even see the Danger, or think you are doing any Thing amiss.</P>

<HEAD>Miss POLLY CHARITY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Lady was truly de∣serving of the Name the bore. It was the constant Study, even of her infant Years, to do all the Good she could to her little Playfellows, with whom she never quarrelled in her Life. Whenever she knew of any poor little Creature in Distress, she would beg a penny of her Papa or Mamma, and go and give it to it privately. She has been often known, when a Piece of nice Cake has been given her, to pretend to be eating it, and then take an Opportunity of sliding it into her Pocket, in order to give into some poor Neighbour's Child.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="020440_0020_0FAF0A553154A1B0"/>
One Day, some one of Miss Pol∣ly's little Acquaintances, coming along the Road near Miss Charity's House, found her standing and cry∣ing over a little Beggar, who sat by the Side of the Road. This is a just Representation of this pitiful Scene. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Her Acquaintance asked her what she
<PB N="41" REF="020440_0020_0FAF0A553154A1B0"/>was crying for. "My dear, (said Polly) this poor little Creature is starving, and I have not a Penny to give her; but if you will lend me Two pence, if you have so much about you, I will certainly pay you again very soon. What a terrible Thing it is to think, that while we live upon Dainties, this poor little Girl shall be starving!"</P>
<P>"My dear, (said Miss Polly's Ac∣quaintance) I am happy that I have Two-pence about me, which is all I am worth in the World, and those were just now given me by a Gen∣tleman for my pretty Behaviour to him. Here they are, and you shall be indebted to me only One Penny, for I will give her the other myself." They eagerly embraced each other.
<PB N="42" REF="020440_0021_0FAF0A561FE67930"/>gave the poor Child the Two-pence, and then parted highly delighted.</P>
<P>It seems that Miss Polly was al∣lowed a Halfpenny a Day for Pock∣et Money, and she determined not to spend a Farthing of it till she had paid her Debts. Accordingly, at the End of four Days, she went to carry the Two-pence to her little Acquaintance, who absolutely re∣fused to take any more than One Penny of it. At last, to settle all Disputes, it was agreed, that the Penny should be given to a poor Neighbour's Child, which was ac∣cordingly done; and here this im∣portant Dispute ended.</P>
<P>This amiable Miss Polly Charity in Time grew up to be a Woman, and had the Happiness to get mar∣ried
<PB N="43" REF="020440_0021_0FAF0A561FE67930"/>to a Gentleman of large For∣tune, who was equally charitable with herself. They now live hap∣pily together amidst all the Com∣forts of Life, and have the Prayers of all the poor Families about them.</P>

<HEAD>Master SIMON LOVEPENNY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a good Sort of a Boy enough, take him for all in all; and it may be said of him, that he was neither remarkably good nor remarkably bad. In short he was one of those Characters, of whom we can say nothing that is very ill or very good.</P>
<P>He always obeyed his Parents commands, and did as he was bid∣den. Indeed, he was at his Books as long as any Boy, and endeavour∣ed to learn as much; but his prin∣cipal Study, at least that which pleas∣ed him most, was casting Accounts, and he had learned many intricate Interest Tables by Heart. Thus far
<PB N="45" REF="020440_0022_0FAF0A5699E3A3C8"/>he was undoubtedly a good Boy.</P>
<P>In his very infant Years, he shewed a great Fondness for Money, and saved up every Halfpenny that was given him. I am told that he spent a great Part of his Time in thus counting over his Money.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>If he at any Time lent any little
<PB N="46" REF="020440_0023_0FAF0A59005B6288"/>Fellow a Penny for a Week, he al∣ways took a Farthing Interest; and if it was only a Halfpenny, he would be contented with taking a few Peaches, Apples, Pears, or what he could get, and these he always sold again, and never eat them himself.</P>
<P>Whenever he lent a Penny to a∣ny little Boy whom he thought ex∣travagant, he always obliged him to leave in his Hands a Top, a Bat∣tledore, a Gig, or some such like Thing by way of Security, which he always sold, if the Debt was not paid in proper Time.</P>
<P>Though it is very necessary for young People to be careful and pru∣dent, yet Master Simon began so early to have the Love of Money at Heart, that he never parted with
<PB N="47" REF="020440_0023_0FAF0A59005B6288"/>any Thing unless he had some View in it, and this made him selfish, al∣ways ready to partake of what others had, but took Care never to part with any Thing himself. It ap∣pears by a little Book that he left behind him (for he died in the tenth Year of his Age) that he in one Year, by lending out Money in the Manner I have mentioned, collected no less than the capital Sum of five Shillings and Two-pence three Far∣things, and that his capital Stock consisted of eighteen Shillings and five Pence Half penny; but to what publick Charity he left all this large Sum of Money, I could never learn. I have, indeed, heard it reported, that he left it to his Sister to build her a Baby-house, and to properly furnish it.</P>

<HEAD>Miss BETSEY PERT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a very genteel young Lady, and may, in some De∣gree, be called a pretty one. She has been brought up at a Boarding School, where she learned the usual accomplishments of Reading, Writ∣ing, Accounts, French, fine Needle work, Dancing, and Musick; but unfortunately for her, her Parents have brought her up like a Lady, without having any Fortune to give her to support that Character.</P>
<P>I have often heard my Papa say, when I was a <HI>Boy</HI> (for now I am commenced a Writer I consider my∣self as a <HI>Man</HI>) that "Parents should always educate Children suitable to
<PB N="49" REF="020440_0024_0FAF0A5A61D8DF08"/>the Condition they might be able to place them in; and that it would be as idle to teach a Girl Dancing and Musick who was to be the Wife of a poor Tradesman, as it would be to teach a Boy Greek and Lat∣in, when he was designed for a Butcher or a Baker."</P>
<P>But to return to Miss Betsey Pert. This said Boarding-school Educa∣tion has so pussed her up, that she cannot even endure those, who have been brought up in what she con∣siders as the vulgar Way. She has no Idea of any Kind of Industry; for that she leaves to those, whom she considers as poor and ignorant. Her whole Time is taken up in dress∣ing herself, and in paying and re∣ceiving Visits.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="020440_0025_0FAF0A5AED7924D0"/>
Here she is, now going to pay a Visit to Miss Thoughtless.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Miss Betsey has a good natural Genius; but she has been always so much suffered to have her own Way at home, that she expects it every where else. Hence she is ve∣ry
<PB N="51" REF="020440_0025_0FAF0A5AED7924D0"/>pert when any one contradicts her, and expects all that Civility and good Behaviour which is wanting in herself. Young Ladies, and young Gentlemen too, before they attempt to find Fault with others, should carefully examine themselves and see that they are not deficient in those Points as well as others.</P>
<P>When Miss Betsey grows older, she may perhaps grow wiser; but I would advise all little Folks to en∣deavour to be wise as soon as possi∣ble; and that they may easily be, if they will but take a little Pains. Of all Things let them avoid Pride; for Pride is the certain Forerunner of Folly; and Folly, you know, is an Enemy to Wisdom. Let them never give pert Answers, nor despise
<PB N="52" REF="020440_0026_0FAF0A5BB000AA70"/>others, because they may not have had so good an Education as them∣selves. In short, Wisdom consists in Prudence, Humility, and Caution.</P>

<HEAD>Master DICKEY SPRIGHTLY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a most singular young Gentleman for his Activity and Sprightliness, as well as for his Learning, Politeness and Affability. No little Gentleman could make a Bow more gracefully, on coming into, or going out of a Room, than Master Dickey Sprightly.</P>
<P>In the Winter Season, when the Ground was covered with Frost and Snow, and the Weather so cold, that his Sisters were not permitted to go out, he would sit by the Fire-side, and tell them such a Number of pretty Stories, which he had read in his little gilt Books, as charmed
<PB N="54" REF="020440_0027_0FAF0A5C9FFACC50"/>every little One that heard him. This happy Accomplishment of tel∣ling pretty little Stories, drew upon him so many invitations to spend Evening after Evening with Masters and Misses in the most respectable Families, that he was never at a Loss to know what to do with his lei∣sure Time. So glad was every one to have his Company, that they al∣ways treated him with Plenty of Fruits, Pies, Tarts, Cheesecakes and Custards, in order to buy the Plea∣sure of his Company again.</P>
<P>In the Summer Time, he was here and there and every where; sometimes up in a Tree, sometimes down in a Fit, and sometimes scam∣pering along the plain Ground, in Pursuit of any Thing that happen∣ed
<PB N="55" REF="020440_0027_0FAF0A5C9FFACC50"/>to come in his Way: Here you see him running after a Rabbit in a Warren; but I will lay a Penny, that he will never overtake it.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>However, amidst all this Gaiety and Sprightliness, he attended pro∣perly to his Books; but then he
<PB N="56" REF="020440_0028_0FAF0A5D75278F28"/>was so exceedingly quick at learning his Tasks, that he generally finished his before other Boys had hardly thought of theirs; so that he had twice the Time on his Hands which other Boys had; and he had besides so excellent a Memory, that he ne∣ver forgot what he had once learned.</P>
<P>When Master Dickey had reached the fourteenth Year of his Age, a very learned Counsellor in the Neigh∣bourhood prevailed on his Father to let him study the Law under his Inspection, and the Offer was ea∣gerly embraced by all Parties. Mas∣ter Dickey has now left off all Play, and is become as solid as an old Man. He is now making great Progress in the Knowledge of the Law; and if we may be permitted
<PB N="57" REF="020440_0028_0FAF0A5D75278F28"/>to judge of future Events from pre∣sent Circumstances, there is no doubt of his one Day becoming a Judge.</P>

<HEAD>Miss CHARLOTTE THOUGHTFUL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS amiable little Maiden was the only Child of very respec∣table Parents, who took every Care in their Power to give her a good Education, and to instill into her Mind the soundest Principles of Virtue. Her Papa was once a weal∣thy Merchant; but from Losses which the wisest cannot foresee, his Circumstances became much re∣duced. He therefore determined to make one bold Push, in order, if possible, to retrieve himself. He ac∣cordingly fitted out a Ship, in which he ventured his All, and went on board of it himself; but alas, they had scarcely got clear of the Land,
<PB N="59" REF="020440_0029_0FAF0A5FCB86CA58"/>when a Hurricane arose, the Ship was dashed to Pieces on a Rock, and every Soul on board perished. What a melancholy Scene is this!</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Every Thing was now lost, and the unhappy Widow, Mrs. Thought∣ful, was forced to give up every Thing to unrelenting Creditors.
<PB N="60" REF="020440_0030_0FAF0A611FBE28E0"/>This good Lady took these Misfor∣tunes so much to Heart, that she died soon after, leaving poor Miss Charlotte totally destitute of the Necessaries of Life.</P>
<P>Though I am but a young Wri∣ter, and little acquainted with the Commerce of the World, yet I am fully convinced, from the very lit∣tle I have seen, that Honour, Pro∣bity, and Virtue, will always find some Friend when in Distress.</P>
<P>Miss Charlotte, who was but four Years of Age, was too young to feel all the Weight of this Misfortune, though she dearly loved her Parents, and shed Torrents of Tears on the Loss of them. There lived in the Neighbourhood a Maiden Lady of great Fortune, who had always ad∣mired
<PB N="61" REF="020440_0030_0FAF0A611FBE28E0"/>the Sweetness and Affability of Miss Charlotte's Temper. This Lady took the sweet Orphan home to her House, and treated her, in e∣very Respect, as though she had been her Daughter. Private Tutors at∣tended her at home to instruct her in every useful Accomplishment; and her different Tutors found they had very little Trouble in making her comprehend the most difficult Things. Miss Charlotte always called the Lady her Mamma, and paid her equally the same Respect as though she had been such. The Lady, in Return, took the pretty little Orphan with her into the po∣litest Company, where she was con∣stantly admired by every one for the Politeness of her Conversation, and
<PB N="62" REF="020440_0031_0FAF1144F068EDD8"/>the Affability and Sweetness of her Disposition. In this Manner, Time insensibly stole away, until Miss Charlotte had nearly reached the nineteenth Year of her Age, when her worthy Friend died, leaving her possessed of her whole Estate, and recommending her to the Care of her Nephew, to whom the whole of her Estate was to devolve, in Case Miss Charlotte should refuse to marry him; but Miss Charlotte loved him: They married and were happy.</P>

<HEAD>Master JEMMY STUDIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pretty little Fellow, or, I should rather say, this pretty little young Gentleman, who is now but in the eighth Year of his Age, seems to be born to be a great Au∣thor. Master Jemmy is my inti∣mate Companion, though I am ra∣ther older than he is; and I do not recollect that, in the course of this important Work, I have told my little Readers that I am turned of eleven. My little Friend Jemmy is constantly reading: and here you see him, even at nine o'Clock at Night, with a Book in his Hand, and sitting by the Fire Side.</P>

<P>For my own Part, though I love my Book very well (and I have the Vanity to think, that what I have here written will sufficiently prove it) yet I love a Bit of Play and Fun, now and then, as well as any Boy; for I think it is a just Observation, that too much of one Thing is good
<PB N="65" REF="020440_0032_0FAF1145B853D0A8"/>for nothing; and even the wise Sol∣omon tells us, there is a Time and Season for all Things. I mean not this as any Reflection upon my dear Companion Jemmy; I only fear, that, by his sticking so very close to his Books, he may hurt his Consti∣tution; for we may carry too far e∣ven the most laudable Pursuits. I hope my little Readers will not im∣agine that I am jealous of Master Jemmy's Abilities, and fearful that he may rival me in writing such little Books as these: No, though I am but a little Fellow, I have a great Soul, and am above all thoughts of Jealousy. I will therefore say no more about it.</P>
<P>There is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="66" REF="020440_0033_0FAF1146BB0C2278"/>that it is impossible to know him without loving him. Though he is born to a very large Fortune, yet he treats the poorest with the same Respect as the rich; for it is his Maxim, that it is Virtue and Ge∣nius only, and not Fortune, that should distinguish between the dif∣ferent Beings here below. Six poor little Boys come constantly twice a Week to his House, on whom he spends two Hours each Time, in order to instruct them in Reading, Writing, and Accounts. He like∣wise lays out most of his Pocket-mo∣ney in little gilt Books, which he distributes among the little needy Ones; and even Bibles, Testaments, and Common-Prayer Books he fre∣quently
<PB N="67" REF="020440_0033_0FAF1146BB0C2278"/>makes a Present of to those who are grown up to Manhood.</P>
<P>I have already observed, that Master Dickey Sprightly will, in all Probability, one Day or other, be∣come a Judge; and from the same Degree of Reasoning, there is every Probability, that Master Jemmy Studious will at last become a Bi∣shop.</P>

<HEAD>Master ISAAC CURIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little Youth, in some Mea∣sure, very properly answered the Name he bore, that of Master Isaac Curious; for there was no Hole or Corner into which he would not creep, nor any Secret among the lit∣tle Ones in the Neighbourhood, which he would not get at the Bot∣tom of. You here see him in full March after a Secret, like any pret∣ty little Miss, with one Hand in a Muff and the other holding an Umbrella over his Head, lest the Sun should tan his delicate Coun∣tenance.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="020440_0038_0FAF114B05FF9D30"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>It is no Wonder that Master Isaac is a Dunce; for those, who trou∣ble themselves so much about other People's Business, seldom mind their own. He seldom sate down to write, unless it was to inform some little Companion of an im∣portant Piece of News: Such as,
<PB N="78" REF="020440_0039_0FAF114BAAACF510"/>Master Tommy has been found guilty of telling a Fib, Master Dic∣key of stealing some Dumps, Master Sammy of smuggling some Marbles, and some such Things as every good Child would rather pity than endea∣vour to make publick; for, as the best of us little Ones are not without Faults, we should forgive that in others, which we hope will be for∣given in ourselves.</P>
<P>It is no Wonder, that this Kind of Behaviour procured Master Isaac many Enemies and few Friends; for when it is once known, that a little Boy gives his Mind to Tale∣bearing, he is soon considered as a dangerous Enemy in the Assemblies of little Masters and Misses. I do not mean, that little Masters or
<PB N="79" REF="020440_0039_0FAF114BAAACF510"/>Misses should ever say what they are afraid of hearing repeated at any Time; but the Misfortune of these Tale-bearers is, that they seldom represent Words as they were real∣ly spoken, but give them a different Turn by the Manner in which they relate them, and often embellish them with a great Variety of Fibs. What Sort of a Man Master Isaac will make, is as yet difficult to say, and I will not be uncharitable in my Conjectures.</P>
<P>I would advise all my pretty lit∣tle Readers to behave in such a Manner, that the Tongue of Slan∣der may never have it in his Power to injure their Reputation. If they should at any Time learn that any Thing had been said amiss of them,
<PB N="80" REF="020440_0040_0FAF114C677F09C8"/>and, if they are convinced, that the Fault found with them is just, let them endeavour to do better; but, if they are convinced that the Ac∣cusation is false, let them take no Notice of it, and it will die away of itself.</P>

<HEAD>Miss FIDDLE FADDLE.</HEAD>
<P>HAD I not for certain known the contrary, I should have been ready to lay a Farthing, that Miss Fiddle Faddle was a Sister or very near Relation, of Master Isaac Curious, so much are they alike in Temper and Disposition.</P>
<P>Miss Fiddle Faddle is undoubt∣edly a very petty, genteel Child, a∣bout seven Years of age, and does not want a tolerable Share of good Sense, though Pride and Assectation seem in a great Measure to have de∣stroyed it. And here give me Leave to observe to you, that Prettiness is an Injury to a young Lady, if her
<PB N="82" REF="020440_0041_0FAF114D291CA880"/>Behaviour is not as pretty likewise; for bad Behaviour makes the pret∣tiest Face that ever was born, ugly and deformed.</P>
<P>Miss Fiddle Faddle would not be seen in the Morning with a Night∣cap on, however decent it might be, no, not for the World. All the Forenoon is spent at her Glass, which she is sometimes ready to break in Anger, because she cannot put her Cap on to her Mind; and she has already been near an Hour in piching upon the proper Part of her Face to stick that Pach on. See what a Piece of Work she makes about it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="020440_0041_0FAF114D291CA880"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>When Miss Fiddle Faddle is in the Company of little Females of her Acquaintaince, her whole Dis∣course turns on the prevailing Fash∣ion of Head-dress; what an ele∣gant Taste one little Miss has, and how terribly unpolite is another.
<PB N="84" REF="020440_0042_0FAF115006F23A90"/>As to entering on any Discourse on little Books, she cannot bear it, for Reading, she says, spoils her Eyes, and makes her Head ach. As to making up her own Caps and Linen, her Mamma will not suffer her to do it, because it would spoil the Milliner's Trade. So that her whole Time is spent in little more than eating, drinking, gossipping, dressing, undressing, and sleeping. In short, should Miss Fiddle Faddle live to be a Woman, I do not know of a better Husband for her than Master Isaac Curious.</P>
<P>My dear pretty little Readers, I would by no Means advise you to be careless or negligent of your Dress, but to be always neat and de∣cent, and dress suitably to your For∣tunes;
<PB N="85" REF="020440_0042_0FAF115006F23A90"/>but let me advise you to re∣collect, that the finest Dress in the World will be of very little Service, if you neglect to read your Book and improve your Minds. A thou∣sand Accidents may unite to deprive you of Beauty and fine Clothes; but nothing can deprive you of Learning when once acquired.</P>

<P>THIS young Gentleman, though in the seventh Year of his Age, is by no Means fond of Company, tho' I know of no little Gentleman better qualified for it than he is, as he has always loved his Book, read a great deal, and has a very good Memory, nor do I know of anyone among my little Acquaintance whom I more esteem than Master Billy Bashful. But this is his Way of walking in the Street, so shame-faced that he cannot hold up his Head.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="020440_0043_0FAF115079708B48"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Though I would by no Means wish any of my pretty little Readers to be pert or impudent in Compa∣ny, yet I do not like to see Children over bashful; for a cheerful and lively Turn in Conversation is al∣ways the most agreeable, and never
<PB N="88" REF="020440_0044_0FAF115179952660"/>fails to make either a Master or Miss taken Notice of; but poor Billy Bashful, though he possesses so many Talents for Conversation, seldom opens his Mouth in Com∣pany, and therefore passes for a Blockhead in the Opinion of those who do not know him. This, how∣ever, should be a Lesson to my Rea∣ders, not to despise any little One, merely because they do not talk much; for Experience has convinc∣ed us, that those who sit still and say nothing, are often wiser than those who talk a great deal.</P>
<P>My little Readers must adapt their Conversation to the Company they may happen to be in. When they are in Company with none but little Ones like themselves, they
<PB N="89" REF="020440_0044_0FAF115179952660"/>may then, if they now and then choose it, let their little Clappers run nineteen to the Dozen; but when they are in Company with their Superiours, they must not be too fond of hearing themselves talk, in order, as they may think, to shew their Wit: On the contrary, they must never speak but when they are spoken to, and, when a Question is asked them, they must give a direct Answer in as few Words as possi∣ble. This will be considered as Modesty and not Bashfulness. And here it may be necessary for me to explain to my little Readers, the Difference between Bashfulness and Modesty.</P>
<P>Modesty requires, that a young Gentleman or Lady should give a
<PB N="90" REF="020440_0045_0FAF115294D874D0"/>direct Answer to any Question that is asked them, without Fear or Trembling; but, at the same Time, it requires you to say no more than is necessary; whereas Bashfulness prevents little Ones answering any Questions that are put to them, until the Question has been asked them three or four Times over, which is always disagreeable, as it borders upon all Manners. Thus you see, that Modesty is desirable, but Bashfulness should be shunned.</P>

<HEAD>Miss FANNY SQUEAMISH.</HEAD>
<P>I AM afraid my pretty little Readers will begin to think me an ill-natured Sort of an Author, who is more pleased with picking out faulty Characters than good ones; but I would beg Leave to re∣mind them, that by pointing out to them what is a Blemish in other little Folks, it may enable them to avoid the like in themselves. Were I to lay before my little Readers nothing but good Characters, they would be of no Use to them, as Self Love and Vanity would induce them to think that they were equal∣ly good themselves; whereas, by
<PB N="92" REF="020440_0046_0FAF115366FD0C70"/>seeing the Errours of other little Ones laid before them, they begin to enquire in themselves, whether they are not guilty of the like. I would advise all my Readers to com∣pare every Character they here read with themselves, and the Compari∣son may perhaps prove useful to them.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, that Miss Fanny Squeamish was of but a weakly Constitution; but this was in a great Measure owing to her being too much indulged in her In∣fancy. Not a Breath of Air from Doors or Windows, that could be excluded, was suffered to approach her; and, when she went abroad, she was wrapped up in such a Man∣ner, that you would suppose the Air
<PB N="93" REF="020440_0046_0FAF115366FD0C70"/>of this Country was like that of Norway or Friezeland.</P>
<P>Sometimes she was carried about the Streets in this Manner; and you <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>may easily judge what Benefit she could receive from the Air, when shut up in a Sedan Chair.</P>
<P>There are some young Ladies, and Miss Fanny is one of them,
<PB N="94" REF="020440_0047_0FAF11546472C3C8"/>who would be exceedingly unhap∣py, should any one tell them, that they never looked better in all their Lives; for these squeamish Sort of young Ladies are never more hap∣py than when they are pitied, and some of them expect, that a whole Company should be sad and mel∣ancholy, because they happen to fancy themselves indisposed. If their Finger does but ach, from the Scratch of a Pin, or any other trif∣ling Accident, the whole House is in an Uproar, the Doctor and A∣pothecary sent for, and the Knocker instantly muffled, as a Token to all the Neighbours that Miss Fan∣ny is very ill.</P>
<P>My little Readers may perhaps think, that I am telling them this as
<PB N="95" REF="020440_0047_0FAF11546472C3C8"/>a Tale to amuse them; but I do assure them, upon my little Hon∣our, that I do, at this Time, know a young Lady, who answers, in e∣very Point, to the Description I have here given of Miss Fanny Squea∣mish. But I hope my Readers will ever have too much good Sense, to attempt to make People believe they are ill when nothing ails them, for we have real Evils enough, without raising imaginary ones.</P>

<P>His Father's Effects were all sold for the Benefit of his Credi∣tors, and poor Tommy was left to the wide World to seek his For∣tune. He had cried bitterly enough for the Loss of his dear Father;
<PB N="97" REF="020440_0048_0FAF1154DEA23578"/>but, as soon as these first Struggles were over, he very wisely reflected, that, though he had lost a kind and indulgent Father, yet he was sensi∣ble, that all the Tears in the World would not restore him to his Cares∣ses, and that it was now his Duty to consider of what Steps were to be taken, in order to preserve him∣self from Want, and thereby pre∣vent any Reflection being thrown on the Memory of his dear Father.</P>
<P>As Tommy had already learned to read, write, and cast Accounts most prettily, he determined to offer his Services to Mr. Worthy, who was a Merchant of great Reputa∣tion, and had formerly dealed with his Father. Tommy walked up and down the Street a long Time
<PB N="98" REF="020440_0049_0FAF1155738A0FB0"/>before he had Resolution enough to knock at the Door. At last he did, was let in, and introduced to Mr. Worthy, who having listen∣ed with great Attention to his in∣nocent and artless Tale, eagerly embraced him, promised to be his Friend, took him instantly into his House, and made him one of his Clerks; and here he is at Business.</P>

Tommmy, Night and Morning, thanked God for these Marks of his Goodness, and employed all his leisure Hours in the Improvement of his Mind, and in such Accom∣plishments as he thought might be useful to him in his present Station.</P>
<P>By these means he soon became a very accomplished young Gentle∣man, and gained the Esteem of his Master and all the Gentlemen their House had Dealings with. So that, in a few Years, he became first Clerk. In this Capacity he con∣tinued until he was twenty-one Years of Age, when Mr. Worthy was happy to discover that there was a secret Liking between Mr. Prudence and his only Daughter. Mr. Worthy gave him his Daugh∣ter
<PB N="100" REF="020440_0050_0FAF1156363E7980"/>in Marriage, and Mr. Prudence accepted of her as one of the great∣est Blessings this World could bes∣tow. They now joined in Part∣nership, and all three live a Life of Happiness, blessing that Hour, in which it pleased God to bring them acquainted with each other.</P>

<HEAD>Miss POLLY HONEYCOMB.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pretty little Miss is one of the most worthy Charac∣ters I have attempted to hand down to Posterity, by inserting it in this valuable Work, which will un∣doubtedly be read by the little Chil∣dren of future Ages.</P>
<P>Miss Polly Honeycomb (will you believe it my little Readers!) is nev∣er out of Temper. Let what will happen, she constantly preserves the Serenity of her Temper, and looks upon those Disappointments, which vex and torment other little Maids, with the utmost Indifference. If that Day happens to turn out rainy, which she and some other little Ones had appointed to go abroad
<PB N="102" REF="020440_0051_0FAF11574195CEB8"/>upon a Party of Pleasure, it gives her not the least Concern, and she endeavours to console her Com∣panions by saying, "To be sure, we did intend to have a good deal of Pleasure Today, and I dare say we should, had the Weather proved fine: But who can tell, but that it has pleased God to order it to rain Today, in order to keep us at home, and thereby avoid some dreadful Accident, which might have hap∣pened to us had we gone abroad? Besides, this Rain will do more Good to the Husbandman and Farmer, than we shall all our Lives. You know we can go a∣broad another Day."</P>
<P>It was in this Manner this amia∣ble young Lady reconciled herself to
<PB N="103" REF="020440_0051_0FAF11574195CEB8"/>every Disappointment that happen∣ed; for she considered God as the Director of all Things, and thought it would be very naughty in her to repine at what he was pleased to direct. I once heard her say (which I shall never forget) "To be sure, it is a most terrible Thing to lose our dear Papa or Mamma, or even any particular Friend; but then we should remember, that they are taken from this World, which I am told is a very wicked one, to enjoy everlasting Rest in Heaven."</P>
<P>Were every little Maiden, and I may say Master too, to act in this Manner, what a World of Uneasi∣ness would they save themselves. There would then be no crying and sobbing about the meerest Trifles,
<PB N="104" REF="020440_0052_0FAF1157B7F9A6A0"/>and often about what it would be dangerous to let them have. Miss Polly is not only always gay, happy, and cheerful herself, but makes o∣thers so also wherever she is. In short, so sweet and amiable is her Temper, that she more resembles a little Angel than a Descendant of Adam and Eve. Strive to imitate her, my dear little Readers, if you wish to be wise and happy as this young Lady is.</P>

<HEAD>Master FRANCIS BACON.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER this young Gen∣tleman was descended from the Family of the great Sir Francis Bacon, or not, is a Matter I never could positively discover. Indeed, all that I can learn of him, is, that he was a remarkably good Scholar for his Age, that he wrote many pretty Things, and that he unhap∣pily died at the Age of eleven Years. The following Letters, written by this young Gentleman, will give my little Readers some Idea of his Knowledge and Abilities.</P>

<P>YOU will see, my dear compan∣ion, from the Letter I now send you, that I am still capable of writ∣ing. I thank God, I am now much better than I have been for some Time past. I should be happy to see you again at Windsor, as I think I should now be better able to en∣tertain you than I was when you was last here. My Tutor has tak∣en away my Books from me; so that, in the tenth Year of my Age, I am obliged to turn Child again, in order to find some Amusement to pass away my Time. Will you believe me? I have made a Kite as tall as myself, and I have filled it full of Stars. I wish you would

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear little Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received your very kind Let∣ter, which you sent me in Answer to mine; and I am exceedingly sor∣ry that you have been forced to put off your Visit until a future Day, as I shall by that Time be perhaps in my Grave. Since I last wrote to you, my Disorder has relapsed, and I am now bad enough. I have struggled hard to write this Letter to you; and, as soon as I have fin∣ished it, I will lay down my Pen forever. My Physician gives me no Hopes; but advises me to be resign∣ed: I am perfectly so. Why should I be otherwise? As soon as I have
<PB N="109" REF="020440_0054_0FAF11592885B7E0"/>quitted this sickly Frame of mine, I shall find myself in the Presence of a good God, and in the Com∣pany of my dear Parents, who have undoubtedly prepared a Seat for me among the Blessed, where no worldly Disorders can reach us. The Bishop last Night honoured me with a Visit.—I was going to make a long Letter of this; but I find the Moment is hastily ap∣proaching, in which I must set out on a long Journey. Farewell, my dear little Friend, farewell forever.</P>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LITTLE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</HEAD>
<P>IT is but just and reasonable, af∣ter I have taken the Liberty to write so freely of so many little Masters and Misses, that I should give some short Account of myself, and prove my Right to the import∣ant
<PB N="111" REF="020440_0055_0FAF115B0930DFF0"/>Character I have here assumed, in presuming to judge of the Con∣duct of others.</P>
<P>To proceed.—My Papa is a Clergyman, and one of the finest Scholars in the Kingdom. He has written several valuable Sermons, which have received the Approba∣tion of almost all the religious old Ladies in the Kingdom. My Mam∣ma was formerly the Governess of a very capital Boarding-School for young Ladies, which she retired from with the pleasing Reflection of seeing several young Ladies ar∣rived at the Age of Maturity, who, under my Mamma's Directions, had acquired an uncommon Share of polite Education, and every fe∣male Accomplishment. It is there∣fore
<PB N="112" REF="020440_0056_0FAF115C0DC5DD18"/>no Wonder, that I should im∣itate my Parents, and thus, in a very early Period of my Life, take upon me to direct little Masters and Misses, as I hope, hereafter, when I shall become a Man, and a Cler∣gyman, to point out to my Flock the sublimest Truths of Religion and Morality.</P>
<P>I was born on the 1st of January, in the Year of our Lord, 1770; and as soon as I was born, I was declared to be the very Model of my Parents: I was instantly pro∣nounced to have Mamma's Eyes, Papa's Nose, Aunt's Mouth, and Uncle's Chin; and one old Lady in particular, putting on her Spec∣tacles, in order to examine my Fea∣tures more minutely, cried out in a
<PB N="113" REF="020440_0056_0FAF115C0DC5DD18"/>prophetick Strain, "I will venture to prophesy, that this sweet Babe will one Day or other become a great Writer and a valuable Preach∣er."</P>
<P>I can recollect very little of my infant Years, further than that my Nurse would frequently observe, that I was always exceedingly dis∣pleased whenever she made Use of the Bells on my Choral, by shak∣ing them to amuse me; and she has since told me, that nothing would quiet me so soon as taking up a Book and reading to me, though I certainly could not, at that Age, understand a single Syllable she pronounced. This Circum∣stance I have often heard my Papa himself confirm.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="020440_0057_0FAF115C736F5BC0"/>
When I came to be breeched, I laid aside all juvenile Sports, and was a very poor Hand at Marbles, Trap-Ball, or Cricket. Indeed I was so little attentive to Play, that I was soon disregarded by the rest of the Boys, who considered me as a dull heavy little Fellow. If ever they got quarrelling together, I never used to intermeddle, but re∣tired to a Corner, pulled out some little Book, which I always carried about me, and left them to fight it out among themselves, as you here see.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="020440_0057_0FAF115C736F5BC0"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>I was never happier than when I could get into my Papa's Study, and, even long before I had any Idea how to form a Letter, I would get a Pen in my Hand, and fill a large Piece of Paper, with what may be called Pot-Hooks and Hangers.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="020440_0058_0FAF115DF93631C8"/>
My Papa soon discovered my natural Inclinations, and encourag∣ed and cherished my early and eager Pursuit after Knowledge. He ac∣cordingly taught me how to hold my Pen, then how to make small Let∣ters, then larger ones, and so on, until within ten Months, when I had learned to write as good a Hand as most of the little Boys in our Neighbourhood who were twice my Age. I likewise conquered the four first Rules in Arithmetick in a Trice, and my Papa tells me, that he doubts not, but that I shall by and by be a great Mathemati∣cian and Divine.</P>
<P>After I had learned to write and read like a Man, my Papa advised me to sit down and write short Let∣ters
<PB N="117" REF="020440_0058_0FAF115DF93631C8"/>out of my own Head, which I accordingly did; and, as I have a great many of these by me, I may, some time or other, find Leisure to peruse and correct them for the Press, when I shall lay them before my little Readers for their Amuse∣ment as well as Improvement.</P>
<P>After I had finished a vast Num∣ber of these Letters, my Papa advis∣ed me to rise one Step higher, and write the Characters of all the lit∣tle Masters and Misses I could re∣collect; but of all Things com∣manded me to conceal the proper Names of the Parties and give them borrowed Titles. How far this first Publication of a little Writer may please the little World, I can∣not tell; but they may be assured,
<PB N="118" REF="020440_0059_0FAF115E6FFAF968"/>that it has cost me much Labour and Study.</P>
<P>I would advise all the little Read∣ers, into whose Hands this Book may fall, carefully to notice all the different Characters they have here read, and thereby regu∣late their Conduct and Behaviour, not only when they are at their own Homes, but more particularly when they are abroad upon Visits. If they carefully observe the Conduct of others, they will often have Oc∣casion to lament, that Masters and Misses are not always so good as they should be. When they evi∣dently discover Imperfections in others, before they venture to cen∣sure or find Fault with them, they should carefully examine themselves,
<PB N="119" REF="020440_0059_0FAF115E6FFAF968"/>whether they likewise have not been guilty of the same Kind of naughty Actions, or at least others equally as bad. By accustoming themselves to this Kind of Self-Examination, they will acquire not only a Know∣ledge of others, but of themselves also, which is the most desirable Thing in this Life to be thorough∣ly acquainted with.</P>
<P>Thus, my little Readers, have I finished this <HI>original</HI> Work, not a single Line of it having been taken from any Book whatever. Is there any <HI>great</HI> Author living, who can, as truly say so much of any of his Works?</P>
