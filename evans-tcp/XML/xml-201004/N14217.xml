<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTABLE AUDITORS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO form the minds of youth to the principles of useful knowledge, and to the esteem and practice of virtue, is at once to communicate the greatest benevolence to mankind, and to receive the most rational satisfaction of which a generous mind is capable.</P>
<P>At the auspicious Aera of the birth of an institution, founded here, to promote piety, virtue and literature, per∣mit me to solicit your attention to this pleasing theme— A theme on which I cannot flatter myself, that I shall offer any thing new, since it has received its deserved Eulogies, from the enlightened of all ages, in which learning has flourished.</P>
<P>Were I to speak of the importance of the good edu∣cation of youth, in order to their passing through life with decency, reputation and usefulness, and acting their part well on the theatre of the world; or in praise of the various branches of academic science; or of the success which has attended the pious labors of those who have laid the foundations of such institutions, in which the gentle hand of instruction has led the steps of expanding genius, in the path of virtue and of knowledge; or were I to shew
<PB N="4" REF="018006_0003_0FA45464701A8B70"/>that the virtuous education of the rising generation, lays the sure foundation of that <HI>righteousness which exalteth a nation;</HI> my attempt would be anticipated by the celebrated masters of instruction, not only of <HI>Athens</HI> and of <HI>Rome,</HI> but of these more enlightned days.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding the subject has not novelty to recom∣mend it, the occasion must apologize for me, generous audi∣tors, while I shall attempt, for your entertainment, to offer a few thoughts on the advantage derived to mankind from the improvement of the understanding in knowledge, and the importance of the virtuous education of youth.</P>
<P>The divine architect, in the creation of the world, has pour'd abroad in rich profusion his benignity among the countless variety of beings, its inhabitants; each representa∣tive of his omnipotence, his knowledge, his wisdom and his goodness. To <HI>man,</HI> the favorite of heaven, is given a pre∣eminence; in that it hath pleased the sovereign goodness, to endue him with the powers of reason; uniting to the divine workmanship of the body, an immortal spirit, capa∣ble of thought and reflection, and of everlasting improve∣ment in knowledge and virtue; and so wisely constituting those, that the animal powers and senses shall be happily subservient to the rational improvement of the mind.</P>
<P>It is by the cultivation of this noble power, that man attains to superior dignity among his fellow men. by this he is brought to the knowledge of his end, and of the wis∣dom
<PB N="5" REF="018006_0004_0FA454652DE04B10"/>of that being, to whom, true science teaches him to refer, with unceasing gratitude, the tribute of sublime praise. This is the glorious end of all science, and for which the father of spirits confered the gift of reason on man.— The cultivation then, of our rational powers in knowledge and in virtue, is a duty as profitable as it is binding, and as pleasing as it is profitable.</P>
<P>If we confine our prospect to those great characters which have rose to eminence and glory on the stage of life, we shall find that they have attained that greatness by the im∣provement of their minds in knowledge and virtue, and in the application of their attainments to the public good. I join the esteem and practice of virtue with useful knowledge, because there can be no true greatness without goodness; and deeds however illustrious that originate not in solid vir∣tue, are but the splendor of false greatness; it is virtue that gives them consistancy, dignity and merit.</P>
<P>From the dawn of life the mind gradually expands to receive the rays of truth, presented by an endless variety of objects, which, if neglected by salutary instruction, con∣tracts a sordid selfishness, and is absobed in ignorance; and by such neglect, deprived of receiving and communicating that rational happiness of which it is capable.</P>
<P>Sensible of the vast importance of education, that the prosperity and happiness of individuals, of families and of nations, depend upon it; wise legislators, heathen as well
<PB N="6" REF="018006_0005_0FA454660146C070"/>as christian, have paid particular attention to it, and encourag∣ed and supported institutions of learning. They have sought for, and maintained, in this honorable employment, men qualified to guide the youth to knowledge and virtue; hence colleges and schools of learning have been founded and en∣dowed in early days; and the encouragement and support of literature and of the arts and sciences interwoven with their systems of government and laws.</P>
<P>This was the case with the wiser heathen of <HI>Greece</HI> and of <HI>Rome;</HI> and in their public schools were formed those re∣nowned statesmen, patriots, orators, poets, philosophers and heroes; who by their abilities and generous labours, raised their respective republics to eminence and glory in the his∣tory of mankind. They rose to opulence and dominion, more by the aids of superior knowledge, than martial bra∣very. By informing the minds of their youth with the knowledge of the rights of mankind, and warming them with patriotic virtue, they were animated to such active deeds as rendered them great in the estimation of mankind, and reflected at the same time, the highest honor on the wisdom of their government. Great and good men in all ages, have ever esteemed it their honor and felicity to encourage and support institutions of learning.</P>
<P>Justness of thinking and propriety of reasoning on sub∣jects within the ken of human comprehension, with a sui∣table application of the principles of knowledge to the great purposes of living, are the happy fruits of a well regulated
<PB N="7" REF="018006_0006_0FA4546794F30980"/>education: and in this consists the dignity and glory of man.</P>
<P>By learning and virtue the civilized man is distinguished from the savage, and raised as far above the uncultivated part of his species, as they are above the animal. Learning enlarges the mind—frees it from its "native barrenness and rusticity"—collects and strengthens the mental powers— reduces the passions to a proper subordination to the law of reason, and restores harmony to the soul. It cherishes a manliness of spirit—it flourishes under the shield of virtuous freedom—it is the enemy of slavery—the support and orna∣ment of every profession of the gown, the sword, the bar and the pulpit. It is the delight of our youthful days; an agreeable and profitable companion in active life; and the solace of advanced age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cicero</NOTE></P>
<P>To a mind engaged in the search of truth, time imper∣ceptibly passes away—and is regaled with the repast of angels. On the wings of virtue and knowledge, it soars towards perfection, and with the steadiness of the eagle, enjoys the beams of science, unclouded by prejudice or error.</P>
<P>Learning expands the heart with universal philanthropy—stimulates the soul to a generous emulation—the good of mankind is the noble rule of its conduct —it is the light of human life. Happy the people whose sons pursue the paths of knowledge and of virtue! They will attain the purposes of life, by cultivating the arts of peace, manu∣factures,
<PB N="8" REF="018006_0007_0FA454682B3FC318"/>agriculture and commerce; and by the practice of that righteousness which consists in justice, mercy and truth, reach the summit of human greatness.</P>
<P>On the contrary; ignorance degrades the soul—the man is lost in the uncultivated savage—and the "human form divine" but little superior to the irrational creation. By <HI>ignorance</HI> the mind is not only deprived of <HI>those enlarged</HI> improvements in knowledge, and of that perfection of which it is made ca∣pable, but it is the slave of the sensitive passions, and like a ship without a pilot, overwhelmed and lost in the storms of life.</P>
<Q><L>"<HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>vice,</HI></L>
<L>"In consort foul agree, each heigt'ning each,</L>
<L>"While <HI>virtue</HI> draws from <HI>knowledge,</HI> brighter fire."</L></Q>
<P>The savage tribes of our western wilderness, in their mode of life, exhibit a striking contrast to the advantages and felicity of a civilized people. Destitute of any regular forms of government, life and property are not secure; while no laws restrain the licentious, or protect the peaceable subject. They are the perpetual slaves of fierce and cruel passions and gloomy imaginations; the passive votaries of the <HI>prince of darkness,</HI> who rules uncontrouled in those dark corners of the earth. But, what a happy change even among savages, is made by the introduction of knowledge! Their barba∣rous tempers are softened by the genial warmth of science; darkness no longer obstructs the mental ray. There, "witchcraft, magic and sorcery," and the answers of the
<PB N="9" REF="018006_0008_0FA4546A5CD370B8"/>oracles of demons disappear— to the shades of ignorance they fly—they flourish only in those dark regions of the earth, where the light of science never shines.</P>
<P>To ignorance, as the prolific cause, must be attributed, the complication of miseries which tyranny and persecution have brought upon mankind in the different ages of the world.</P>
<P>Detestable ignorance! thou, offspring of sin, and fruitful parent of evil! with foul assiduity thou nourishest blind bigotry, gloomy superstition, unresisting slavery, and bloody persecution! too long hast thou held mankind in thy chains. Thy charm shall be broken. In thy ruin shall science, liberty and virtue triumph!</P>
<P>The introduction of knowledge opens the minds of a people to comprehend the great purposes of living; and to pursue the means of attaining happiness. It disposes them to suppress lawless ambition and revenge; which, among the uncivilized, speedily kindle the flames of war—for mankind, uncultivated, are prone to commence hostilities at every injury; having little to loose by the ravages of con∣quest. Far different is the case with those nations with whom manufactures, trade and commerce have made a progress: their interest and happiness are secured by a peaceable conduct. Great indeed have been the changes which have been made among mankind by the introduction of the arts of civil and social life, and the happy system of
<PB N="10" REF="018006_0009_0FA4546BE5AA9018"/>evangelical truth—by the lighth of these the nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have emerged from gothic ignorance and barbarism; and rose to greatness and refinement, both in a political and religious view. Hence, the vast difference between the manners of these, and those of the wandering herds of <HI>Tartars,</HI> the plundering tribes of <HI>Arabia</HI> and the savage nations of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>By improving the human understanding, great discoveries have been made, tending to the common utility and happi∣ness of mankind.</P>
<P>Inriched with the knowledge of the ancients, the moderns have excelled them in many valuable arts and manufactures. In profitable branches of science they have also excelled.— As the superior lustre of the sun eclipses the rays of inferior orbs, so shines the genius of a <HI>Newton,</HI> among philosophers of former times. Admitted to pry into the <HI>arcana</HI> of go∣vernment by which the heavenly bodies are regulated, with a force of penetration peculiar to himself, he has struck out new paths for succeeding geniuses, and reaching the zenith of human science, attained the glorious end, to which all knowledge is directed—to acknowledge and adore the allwise ruler of this stupendious frame! In the contemplation of the universe the mind is enraptured, and anticipates the period which shall disingage it from matter and open a field for everlasting advancement towards perfection.</P>
<P>Great improvements have been made in later days in the
<PB N="11" REF="018006_0010_0FA4546D5E056CC0"/>science of geography. The lesser divisions only of the earth were known to the ancients; their geographical knowledge was bounded by <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>Ganges;</HI> all besides was to them a <HI>Terra incognita.</HI></P>
<P>The polar property of the magnet, and its uses in navi∣gation, was to them unknown: hence their knowledge of distant regions and nations was very imperfect, and their ideas of them visionary and romantic: and without this most useful discovery, we must have continued in the same igno∣rance; and like the ancient <HI>Phoenicians</HI> performed our voyages only along the shores, and by the guidance of the stars. But by the aid of this invention, the skilful mariner can now find his way thro' the pathless deserts of the ocean in storms and darkness, to the wished-for port: by this, trade and commerce, the great sources of national opulence and power, are carried on, the nations spread over the face of the globe become acquainted, and are no longer strangers or enemies, but friends, allies and brethren of one universal family. Commerce gives life and motion to the world; the spirit of industry is hereby excited, the treasures and delica∣cies of various climates distributed round the earth, and the general happiness promoted. Far different from this, was the intercourse of nations in the darker ages; <HI>then</HI> they fought each other to plunder or destroy; and were known only as victors and vanquished, tyrants and slaves.</P>
<P>Thus, from a few instances, we may discover the happi∣ness derived to mankind from the improvement of the un∣derstanding.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018006_0011_0FA4546D6D03C208"/>
Were we to trace the various and almost endless branches of the arts and manufactures to their source, each of them would afford a pleasing topic of panegyric in favour of learn∣ing; since they all owe their origin and perfection to the application of the principles of philosophy and the powers of mechanics: but our time will not indulge a further pur∣suit of the agreeable theme.</P>
<P>Come we now to speak of the importance of the virtuous education of youth.</P>
<P>From the acknowledged advantages which are enjoyed by those nations who cultivate the arts and sciences, and train up their youth in useful knowledge, and the practice of moral virtue, the necessity of education must strike every mind with conviction: and learning can have no enemies, the "ignorant excepted."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reflections on learning.</NOTE> No man, respected auditors, can be truly great, who is not a friend to learning; since no man can be truly great without an enlightned understanding and a benevolent heart. The importance then of the proposition which I would attempt to illustrate, must, by the wise and good, be universally acknowledged.</P>
<P>As the skill of the Artist gives beauty and lustre to the rude diamond taken from the mine; so does the polish of education discover <HI>the just value of the</HI> rational immortal mind.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018006_0012_0FA4546E2D52DC08"/>
The design of education is to qualify youth for an active, <HI>useful</HI> and <HI>virtuous life;</HI> and to direct them into the path of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>endless felicity.</HI> These are the great ends for which this institution is founded; which ordains, that the youth be initiated into such branches of human science, as shall lay a foundation for their after improvement; and above all, that such impressions of moral obligation, and the great principles of natural and revealed religion, be made on their minds; as, by the divine blessing, may make them truly good; as well as useful in life.</P>
<P>Youth is a susceptible age; free from prejudice, and ea∣ger in the pursuit of knowledge; instruction obtains a wel∣come admittance to their minds; the heart receives it by an easy transition; and from thence it flows, in all the various actions of riper days.</P>
<P>Those impressions which are made upon the mind in child∣hood and youth are most lasting; as a new vessel long re∣tains a tincture of the liquor which it first receives: these form the manners, and regulate the temper thro' life; agreeable to the observation of the wisest of men. <HI>Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>As education opens the mind to receive the light of revelation, it is hand-maid of religion; and the mer∣ciful parent of the whole family of <HI>Adam,</HI> is pleased to cherish the seeds of pious instruction planted in the youthful
<PB N="14" REF="018006_0013_0FA4546FB46C2698"/>breast, with heavenly influence; and from those families and institutions, in which religion is inforced by examples of goodness, and instructions of early peity, have those persons usually been taken, whom GOD hath honored with distin∣guished usefulness in the world.</P>
<P>As without application, knowledge is not to be acquired; and the mind gradually expands to receive it; the skilful hand of instruction is necessary to rear it to valuable attain∣ments. As the fertile soil by proper cultivation sends forth a rich harvest, but if neglected by the hand of industry, yields nought but weeds and briers; so the minds of youth, well instructed, will send forth generous and salutary fruit, to reward the labor.</P>
<P>In a public school, youth engaged in the same studies, will be excited by a laudable ambition to excel. The knowledge diffused among the whole, will become in a degree the property of each individual. There the unhappiness of some dispositions will be cured by a constant association with those that are pleasant and amiable—they will polish one another. And, under the direction of the faithful precep∣tor, the vicious passions will be checked as soon as they appear; and the laudable, encouraged, protected and re∣warded.</P>
<P>Our venerable ancestors, impressed with the importance of improving this early period of life, founded colleges and schools; by which they have left us a monument of their
<PB N="15" REF="018006_0014_0FA45470838E9948"/>wisdom, their piety and their patriotism, as lasting as time. This good work of theirs, it hath pleased GOD remarkably to bless;—into those fountains he has cast the salt of divine grace; and the salutary streams have made glad the city of GOD. This generous part of that rightousness which con∣sists in a zealous pursuit of duty towards the rising genera∣tion, we this day experience the blessed fruits of, from the great father of mankind, whose <HI>gentleness hath made us great.</HI></P>
<P>Let us bow the knee, my highly favoured auditors, to the GOD of our fathers and of our salvation, with never ceas∣ing gratitude, that it is our happy lot to draw the vital air, and flourish in this land of knowledge, of liberty and pub∣lic virtue! That we are individual members of these States, which Heaven has crowned with the blessings of INDE∣PENDENCE and PEACE; and rendered prosperous in population, commerce and wealth, and above all, that we enjoy the light of the gospel of the blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> in great∣er purity than any people on <HI>Earth!</HI> May it be the subject of our daily solicitude—<HI>what shall we render to the Lord for all his benefits!</HI></P>
<P>In this happy age, and even since the commencement of our successful struggle to be free, we behold a spirit of enquiry on the great subject of the natural rights of mankind, ra∣pidly spreading over the earth; and the eyes of despotic princes and of their oppressed subjects opening to the con∣viction of liberty and justice; national prejudices disappearing
<PB N="16" REF="018006_0015_0FA4547131C28A68"/>before the dawn of science; error dropping the mask; and dismissing bigotry and persecution from her train; and mankind embracing each other as brethren. No more shall the suspicion of heresy condemn the innocent victim to the torture; the weapons of infernal revenge shall forever sleep; and the blind votaries of delusion receive the glori∣ous light of heavenly PEACE.</P>
<P>On the wide theatre of this new world, upon the thres∣hold of which we are just entering, what chearing pros∣pects open before us! Here, virtuous freedom crowned with the laurels of victory ever opposing ambition, will cherish future geniuses that will arise, to eclipse the glory of former ages! This prodigious continent, extending thro' various climates and regions, luxuriant in soil, will crown the arts and sciences with the productions of her worthy sons.— Empire having reached the limits of the globe, will proba∣bly <HI>here</HI> rest, after it's long travel from the eastern hemis∣phere; and the arts and sciences attain their last polish of perfection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A growing taste for useful knowledge is an important characteristic of the people of this new world;—and seems to be the happy effect of that well regulated freedom and equality, enjoyed by them; and a pleasing omen of future advances, to that perfection of knowledge and social happiness, which may be attained by the united exertions of the human powers. This taste for literature has laid the foundations of ten colleges, several of them well endowed, in these thirteen states; in which there are resident, from 800 to 1000 students: besides a number of public academies, which are designed to prepare youth for admit∣tance into those colleges; and to give a good english education, to those whose circumstances may forbid their passing thro' a course of classic learning.
<P>There are also formed, several societies of the <HI>literati,</HI> for advance∣ment of knowledge; and those institutions have been established un∣der all the disadvantages attending the settlement of a new country; and several of them, even while our enemies, tho' undesigned by them, were assisting, in laying the foundations of the august edifice of a rising empire, cemented by the blood of our countrymen!</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018006_0016_0FA4547389050560"/>
A happy presage of future glorious days, yet to open on this continent, seems afforded, by the rapid progress of po∣pulation, and of the arts and sciences, in the course of a century and a half past: Long concealed from the know∣ledge of mankind, and happily sequestered from the old world deluged in ignorance and slavery—may we not indulge the pleasing thought, that Heaven hath reserved it, for the stage, on which the last and most glorious displays of the divine goodness to the children of men, shall be ushered in — when, in a sublime and perfect sense, there shall be given to the inhabitants, a pure language—the language of PEACE and everlasting love! <HI>Paradise,</HI> long lost to the children of Adam, shall be found in this western world; and become the residence of the favorites of Heaven!</P>
<P>Hail, happy days! we congratulate you, O ye people, yet unborn, in the joyful prospects, when the wilderness of <HI>America</HI> shall become cultivated; and the forest which now conceal the murderous Indian, watching for his prey, shall adorn the banks of yonder majestic lakes and rivers; and the sails of merchantmen, whiten the watery prospect; and the muses flourish under the protection of FREEDOM and
<PB N="18" REF="018006_0017_0FA45475207B46F0"/>PEACE; when schools of virtue, colleges and academies, shall adorn her plains, and temples erected to <HI>Jehovah,</HI> reach the limits of yonder western ocean: the congregations of the saints croud the gates of <HI>Zion,</HI> and the incense of thanks∣giving arise, from ten thousand altars, to the throne of GOD.</P>
<P>Then shall those glorious events, long purposed in the eternal mind, obtain their full accomplishment! Then shall they adore HIM from the <HI>West;</HI> the wilderness blossom as the rose, the waste places smile like <HI>Eden;</HI>—and the de∣serts of <HI>America</HI> flourish, as the garden of GOD.</P>
<P>The enlightned of foreign nations, who have been look∣ing upon <HI>us,</HI> with an ardent curiosity, have been pleased to give us the pre-eminence, in knowledge and virtue, to any people on the earth: and shall I go too far, when I say, <HI>this</HI> we owe to the piety of our fathers? They <HI>wisely</HI> thought, that the most valuable <HI>legacy</HI> they could leave their <HI>children,</HI> was a <HI>virtuous education.</HI> And the happy effects of our contest for FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE, under the auspi∣cious smiles of Providence, have been owing to men of superior talents and enlightned genius, who rose to stand foremost in the storm; and by whom our <HI>Republic,</HI> long tost on the warring element, is now moored in the harbour of PEACE!</P>
<P>While we revere the character of our illustrious <HI>Chief,</HI> as wise in council, glorious in the field, and amiable in every moral and social virtue, with warmest sentiments of thanks∣giving
<PB N="19" REF="018006_0018_0FA454769C9732D8"/>to Heaven, who has honored him, as the father and saviour of his country; we leave it to the future sons of <HI>America,</HI> to do justice to his unrivaled fame. The names and deeds of our worthy patriots, statesmen and heroes, will be handed down, on the faithful page of history, and applauding generations, will water their tombs, with the tears of gratitude and joy!</P>
<P>Nor less illustrious, will be their characters, who at this dawning of American greatness, with pious zeal for their country, have founded academies and schools of learning.</P>
<P>The patrons of learning and of virtue, who with the amiable generosity of <HI>Maecenas,</HI> have promoted the means of salutary instruction, have received the noble epithet of <HI>Patres Patriae,</HI> and benefactors of mankind.</P>
<P>I must ask your indulgence, while on this occasion, I make an address, or two:—and were I permitted, I would honor my discourse, with a public acknowledgement of the gene∣rous deed, which has convened us together, by laying the deserved applause, of a grateful public, at the feet of the honorable founder of the <HI>Exeter Academy.</HI> Her future sons will pronounce the <HI>name,</HI> with affectionate and grate∣ful veneration.</P>
<P>May the blessing of thousands, who by means of this generosity, may be rescued from ignorance and qualified for usefulness, rest on the honorable Founder! and the rewards

<P>To the respectable inhabitants of this Town, I would beg leave to address my discourse:—Allow me, Gentlemen, to observe, that it must afford every friend of virtue, a satis∣faction, that we may congratulate you on the birth of this public Institution, and its establishment, by the honorable Legislature of the State; in which, your sons—the rising hope of your declining days, may be placed under promis∣ing advantages, for an early education. The success of the instructions which they will receive at the Academy, will greatly depend, on your kind endeavors to co operate with the <HI>Preceptor,</HI> in his faithful labors, for their benefit. Be∣hold the man! respectable parents! who relinquishing his connections in a distant part of the country, embraces the lot, which an all-diposing Providence points out, and becomes the guardian and <HI>Preceptor</HI> of your sons! Your zeal to suc∣ceed his labors, will not be wanting;—he will find them light'ned by your kind attention to his comfort and useful∣ness, while directing the studies, and forming the principles, and morals, of your beloved offspring.</P>
<P>The commodious edifice, which you, Gentlemen, have
<PB N="23" REF="018006_0022_0FA4547A6ED82448"/>erected, is an honorable testimonial of your zeal to promote the laudable Institution. May it be made a rich blessing to our Towns, and to this, in a particular manner!</P>
<P>We humbly <HI>dedicate</HI> and recommend this <HI>Academy</HI> to the <HI>Father</HI> of mercies—to him who hath loved the children of men—and to the enlight'ner of the world; beseeching Him to take it into his holy protection; and that it would please him, to preserve it, and long continue it an extensive blessing; that the would smile on the means of education, and succeed our united efforts, to spread the honors of his name, among mankind, in this, and succeeding generations!</P>
<P>O may a glorious multitude of plants of renown, reared and cultivated in this nursery of knowledge and virtue, after bearing much fruit to bless mankind, be transplanted to a happier soil, and flourish in immoral bloom, in the <HI>Para∣dise</HI> above! May the generous Founder there behold the fair fruits his labors!</P>
<P>May this <HI>Institution live 'till nature dies!</HI> and <HI>suns</HI> and <HI>stars</HI> and <HI>worlds</HI> are rapt in universal ruin!</P>
