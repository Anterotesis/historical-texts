<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE SERMON on the <HI>holy rite</HI> of CON∣FIRMATION, was delivered in New-York, in Saint George's chapel, on Sunday May the 4th inst. and (with a little variation) in the afternoon of that day, in Saint Paul's chapel.</P>
<P>This sacred rite was administered in the first mentioned of these chapels, on Sunday, April the 27th last, and in the other chapel, the day the sermon was preached. The au∣thor hopes that it's publication may be of utility, (especially, as not any thing, to his knowledge, hath been published, in this country, on the subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which it treats) and conceives, there will be a propriety in <HI>prefixing it</HI> to the sermon on the <HI>holy sacra∣ment</HI> of the LORD'S SUPPER.</P>
<P>Those persons who subscribed for the pub∣lication of the four discourses, which accom∣pany the sermon, above mentioned, and were not informed that it would be printed, have it at their option to receive it <HI>gratis,</HI> or to pay <HI>eight pence,</HI> to defray the expences of the press.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MICAH vi. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly; and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SERIOUS is the truth, that those who enjoy the greatest spiritual privileges, are not always the most distinguish∣ed for the practice of virtue!</P>
<P>How highly favoured, for instance, were the people of Israel?—"Unto them," it is said, "pertained the adop∣tion; and the glory; and the covenants; and the giving of the law; and the service of God; and the promises."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>But were they, in general, obedient to the will of Hea∣ven? How often did the Almighty complain of their impieties?</P>
<P>"I have spread out my hands," said he, "all the day, unto a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; who provoke me to anger continually to my face."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Isai. lxv. 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>"This people of Jerusalem is slidden back with a perpe∣tual backsliding; they hold fast deceit; they refuse to re∣turn. I hearkened and heared, but they spake not aright. No man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one turned to his course, as the horse rush∣eth into the battle."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Jer. viii. 5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021347_0005_0FB31BCC9CF45A80"/>Often did God inflict judgments on his people to reclaim them from vice; and often, to accomplish this end, did he address them in language of threatning and reproof, by the voice of his prophets.</P>
<P>In the chapter before us, this people were thus addressed by the prophet Micah.</P>
<P>"Hear ye now what the Lord saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice!"</P>
<P>Or, as the sense is; plead openly, vehemently; let there be witnesses to hear the case, which is so favourable on God's part, and so full against his people, that the very mountains and hills, on which they have publickly sinned against him, and on which he greatly blessed them, had they eyes to see, ears to hear, and a voice of utterance, would testify that God planted them with vines and olives; cloathed them with grass and flocks; stored them with springs of water, and beautified them with cedars and all pleasant trees of the forest;—but on these places have these people made their groves; set up their idols; sacrificed to devils, and com∣mitted impieties not to be named! Speak, therefore, O Micah, as though thou wouldest make the mountains and hills hear, that they may witness for God against this peo∣ple!</P>
<P>"Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth; for the Lord hath a con∣troversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel;"— no longer forbear to punish them for their iniquities.—"O my people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against me!"—If I have ever been doing thee good; if I have imposed on thee nothing griev∣ous nor unjust, why art thou weary of me? Or, if thou hast found any injustice in me, hesitate not to declare it; witness against me!</P>
<P>The Almighty then recounted the favors he had conferred on the people of Israel, and, particularly, the deliverance he gave them from Egyptian bondage, and from their ene∣mies, while passing through the wilderness to the land of Canaan; and also, the instruction communicated to them by Moses.</P>
<P>This address of the prophet, seems to have awakened in
<PB N="7" REF="021347_0006_0FB31BCD99F4E9A8"/>
the people a sense of guilt; a disposition to return to obedi∣ence. They enquire what sacrifice they shall render God as an atonement for their sins; and express their willingness to offer the <HI>most costly</HI> in their power;—even the lives of <HI>their</HI> CHILDREN, if <HI>these</HI> to God would be acceptable.</P>
<P>"Wherewith shall I come before the Lord and bow my∣self before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?—Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams? Or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my trans∣gression; the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"</P>
<P>To these enquiries, the prophet answers in the words of our text.—"He HATH shewed thee, O Man! what is GOOD. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly; and to love mercy; and to walk humbly with thy God?"</P>
<P>The Almighty, it is here said, HAD SHEWED the people of Israel "what was GOOD;" or what was their DUTY.— It is probable the prophet alluded to the following passage in the tenth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, wherein the duty of men is expressed.</P>
<P>"And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God; to walk in all his ways; and to love him; and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul: To keep the com∣mandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day, for thy good?"<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Deut. x. 12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are many other passages, indeed, in the sacred writ∣ings, in which the whole of our duty is declared. And the children of Israel were informed, in the text, that all their sacrifices to God would be unacceptable to him, if they were <HI>regardless</HI> of VIRTUE.</P>
<P>"What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" Or, what service canst thou render him, that will be accept∣able, whilst thou dost not obey his will?</P>
<P>"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to
<PB N="8" REF="021347_0007_0FB31BCF93BA2FA8"/>
obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams!"<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xv. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>As sacrifice, or external worship, is not pleasing to God, unless we are possessed of righteousness;—and as the WHOLE of our duty consists, it is said, in "doing justice; loving mercy, and walking humbly with God;" we beg leave to pay a little attention to these particulars.</P>
<P>It cannot be said we "DO JUSTLY," if, in any sort, we <HI>injure</HI> our <HI>fellow creatures.</HI> And, in how many respects, may they be injured?</P>
<P>They may be robbed of their VIRTUE, which is, of all things, the most estimable.</P>
<P>They may be deprived of their REPUTATION; be pierced by the tongue of detraction, and receive thereby a wound more injurious than death itself.</P>
<P>By artifice, fraud or power, they may be divested of their PROPERTY; and, by the hand of violence, they may be <HI>maimed</HI> in their PERSONS, or <HI>deprived</HI> of LIFE.</P>
<P>It cannot be said, that we "DO JUSTLY," if we are re∣gardless of the duty we owe to <HI>our</HI> COUNTRY, by duly ho∣noring IT'S LAWS.</P>
<P>Public justice is explicitly enjoined on us. We are re∣quired "to render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor can it be said that we "DO JUSTLY," while we perform not <HI>all</HI> the <HI>relative duties</HI> we owe to <HI>each other.</HI> What injustice may legislators, magistrates, ministers of religion, parents, and divers other characters, be chargeable with, when they are inattentive to the discharge of the trust reposed in them?</P>
<P>We do not, indeed, properly revere this precept of jus∣tice, except we "do unto all men, as we would they should do unto us;" <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 31.</NOTE> or unless all our actions, towards each other, are governed by the principles of uprightness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntegrity.</P>
<P>There is not, we conceive, any virtue that so contributes
<PB N="9" REF="021347_0008_0FB31BD150E47298"/>
to the happiness of society, as JUSTICE. And it is no small testimony, in favor of our religion, that JUSTICE, as well as MERCY, is so forcibly and repeatedly enjoined on us.</P>
<P>"That," says God, "which is altogether just, shalt thou follow."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Deut. xvi. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Ye shall not steal; nor deal falsly; nor lie one to another."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Lev. xix. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor; nor rob him."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; in weight; nor in measure. Just balances, and just weights shall ye have."<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 35, 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Remove not the ancient land-mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which thy fathers have set up.—Enter not into the fields of the fatherless; for their Redeemer is mighty, he shall plead their cause with thee."<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 28. xxiii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Wo unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteous∣ness; that useth his neighbor's service without wages."<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Let no man defraud his brother, in any matter; be∣cause the Lord is the avenger of all such."<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. iv. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>To JUSTICE, it is required, that we <HI>add</HI> MERCY.</P>
<P>He who is <HI>truly merciful,</HI> is free from malice, hatred and revenge.—If injured, "he avengeth not himself; but rather giveth place to wrath; knowing that vengeance belongeth to God."<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such a person, not only forgives his enemy; forbears "to recompense to him evil for evil;"<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 17.</NOTE> but, "if he hungers, he feeds him; if he thirsts, he gives him drink,"<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 20.</NOTE> and therefore, "is not overcome of evil, but overcomes evil with good."<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>"As he hath opportunity, he doth good to ALL men;" <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 10.</NOTE> "to ALL he is compassionate, pitiful and courteous;" <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 8.</NOTE>—he uses no severity towards any, though <HI>legal justice</HI> might warrant the action.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021347_0009_0FB31BD2FAA80D60"/>His deeds of benevolence are not performed to gain hu∣man applause; as far as possible, they are done in secret, and he is stimulated to them by love to God and love to man.</P>
<P>This is the character that, (in the most exalted sense of the expression▪) may be said to "LOVE MERCY;" he is, in this instance, an ornament to human nature and religion, and a blessing to mankind; and he enjoys a pleasure, in consequence of his benevolence, truly sublime, and alto∣gether unexperienced by the man of avarice, hatred or revenge.</P>
<P>We cannot but highly approve ourselves to the deity when we "show mercy." And those who are devoid of mercy, cannot but be the objects of God's displeasure.</P>
<P>It was said by our Lord; "If ye forgive men their tres∣passes, your heavenly father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heaven∣ly father forgive your trespasses."<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>"And he," saith Saint James, "shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy."<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other particular demanded of us, is, to "WALK HUMBLY WITH GOD;" or to "humble ourselves, to walk with him."</P>
<P>HUMILITY certainly becomes <HI>sinful men.</HI>—The psalmist, contemplating the excellence of God, and the depravity of our nature, exclaims: "Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him!"<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Psal. viii. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Before honor," says Solomon, "is humility."<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our Saviour was a most perfect example of humility, and he exhorts us to "learn of him to be meek and lowly in heart."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>PRIDE, the sin of <HI>Lucifer,</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 6.</NOTE> is most hateful to God; reproachful to men, and will terminate in their abasement and destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021347_0010_0FB31BD82694A1F8"/>"A proud look," we are assured, "is an abomination to God."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 16, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>"The lofty looks of man," saith a prophet, "shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of man shall be brought down; for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low."<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Isai. ii. 11, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>But however becoming humility is to mankind; and how pleasing soever our humble demeanor may be to God, we cannot conclude that he requires of us nothing more than the virtue of humility, when he enjoins us to "walk humbly with him."</P>
<P>JUSTICE, MERCY, and HUMILITY, are, indeed, <HI>car∣dinal virtues;</HI> but should they, (in the common acceptation of the words) be possessed by us, we might, notwithstanding, be <HI>defective</HI> in <HI>our duty;</HI> be the slaves of vice; polluted by sin; devoid of the Almighty's affection.</P>
<P>A person may be merciful, just and humble, while he continues in a <HI>state of</HI> INFIDELITY; rejects the dispensation of the gospel; is destitute of sobriety; temperance, and chas∣tity, and indulges himself in many vices.</P>
<P>The phraze, therefore, "to walk humbly with God," is very comprehensive, and is designed to include here, the <HI>whole of our duty;</HI> except our "doing justice and loving mercy."</P>
<P>Agreeable to the tenor of the sacred writings, can it be said that we "walk humbly with God;" perform all our duty, or are entitled to salvation, unless we give our assent to the truths of divine revelation;—are penitent for our sins;—rely on the merits of Christ for the absolution of our offences;—revere all the divine precepts, to the utmost of our ability, and are possessed of all the graces and virtues of christianity; holiness, RENOVATION of HEART, and a meetness to participate of celestial enjoyments?</P>
<P>"He that believeth not," says our Lord, "shall be dam∣ned." <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE> It is "the blood of Christ," we are informed, appropriated to us by faith, "that cleanseth us from sin."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">1 John 1.7.</NOTE></P>
<P>Without "repentance," we are assured we "shall pe∣rish."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="021347_0011_0FB31BDAB01EEC88"/>"The workers of iniquity," it is declared, shall finally be rejected by Christ.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 23.</NOTE> "Without holiness," it is said, "no man shall see the Lord,"<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE> and except we are BORN," says our Saviour, "of WATER and of the SPIRIT, we can∣not enter into the kingdom of God."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">John iii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Those who are the heirs of salvation, or who properly "receive" Christ, are said to be "BORN, not of blood; nor of the will of the flesh; nor of the will of man, but <HI>of</HI> GOD."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">ibid. i. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Such,</HI> "cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and are perfecting holiness in the fear of God;"<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vii. 1.</NOTE> and as they are obedient to the dictates of the divine spirit; are influenced and governed by it,—of THEM, it may be <HI>truly said,</HI> that THEY "walk humbly WITH God."</P>
<P>"As many," says St. Paul, "as are led by the spirit of God, are the sons of God;"<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE> and if "we live," says this apostle, "after the flesh, we shall die; but if through the spirit, we mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live."<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus <HI>extensive</HI> and <HI>spiritual,</HI> are the demands of our reli∣gion; nothing less than a due regard to <HI>these things,</HI> can be meant by "fearing God and keeping his commandments;" <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. xii. 13.</NOTE> or, by "doing justly; loving mercy, and walking hum∣bly with him."</P>
<P>And <HI>such virtue,</HI> we presume, was possessed by "ENOCH," when "he walked with God;"<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Gen. v. 22.</NOTE> by "NOAH, who was a just man, and perfect in his generations, when he walked with God, according to all his commandments;"<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">ibid. vi. 9.</NOTE> and by ABRAHAM, when the Lord appeared to him and said; "walk before me, and be thou perfect."<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>From what hath been said, on this interesting subject, we perceive how <HI>delusive</HI> it must be, to rely on the external worship of God, or on some moral virtues only, for salva∣tion!</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="021347_0012_0FB31BDC92A0A570"/>These things are demanded of us; but they are far from comprehending ALL that duty we owe to God, our neigh∣bor, and ourselves!</P>
<P>It is the design of the gospel to <HI>restore</HI> our FALLEN NA∣TURE; to teach us wisdom; to inspire us with principles of virtue; to reform the WHOLE LIFE;—to give us puri∣ty of heart;—to reconcile us to God, and prepare us for the enjoyments of his presence.</P>
<P>And, if thus, we also perceive how <HI>vain</HI> it must be to hope for salvation, though possessed of the highest degrees of FAITH in Christ, while we are destitute of MORAL GOOD∣NESS;—justice; mercy, and humility; sincerity, integrity, chastity, and those other virtues, which are required of us!</P>
<P>How grateful should we be to GOD, that HE HATH "SHEWED US <HI>what is</HI> GOOD;"—that he hath made a dis∣covery of his will to us; that we are not left to fruitless ef∣forts to discover our duty, by the <HI>dim light</HI> of <HI>nature,</HI> but that we are blest with the perfect effulgence of divine reve∣lation!</P>
<P>While this consideration should excite in us gratitude to the Almighty, it teaches us to reject the <HI>pretended revelations</HI> from above, communicated by enthusiasts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As the canon of sacred scripture hath long since been <HI>perfected,</HI> it is truly astonishing, that, in this enlightened age, the very extraordinary <HI>reveries</HI> of BARON SWEDEN∣BORG, should be received as <HI>divine revelations</HI> by so many respectable characters in Europe!</P>
<P>How opposite is the conduct of some men to each other! How striking the contrast between the <HI>Deist</HI> and <HI>Enthusiast!</HI> The one, most credulous; the other, totally devoid of faith! Enthusiasts, however, in general, are regarded as <HI>honest, well-meaning</HI> persons; (the moral character of this gentleman is amiable) happy would it be for Deists, if as much could be said in their favor!</P></NOTE> or impostors!</P>
<P>A moment's reflection must convince us of the IMPORT∣ANCE of <HI>duly submitting</HI> to that dispensation of grace which
<PB N="14" REF="021347_0013_0FB31BDE127F7D28"/>
God hath favored us with; or of <HI>properly honoring</HI> the re∣quisition of the text!</P>
<P>As it is declared, that "blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it;"<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 28.</NOTE> and that the "Lord Jesus will be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, to take vengeance on those who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ;"<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. i. 7, 8.</NOTE>—shall we not, there∣fore, from the <HI>present moment,</HI> if we have any concern for the honor of God; the interests of virtue; our own honor, and present and future felicity, be most sedulous to <HI>regard</HI> our <HI>duty;</HI>—to "do justly; to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God?"</P>
<P>That such may be our wisdom; such our virtue and hap∣piness, will God Almighty of his infinite mercy, be pleased to grant; for the sake of the merits of Christ; to whom with the Father and Holy Ghost, be ascribed all honor and glory, adoration and praise, now and for ever!</P>

<HEAD>SERMON II.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROMANS vii. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For I was alive without the law once; but when the com∣mandment came, sin revived, and I died.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT attending to that important relation which these words have with the context, we will consider in <HI>what sense</HI> Saint Paul was "<HI>alive</HI> without the law."</P>
<P>NEXT, shew, what we are to understand by the "<HI>coming</HI> of the <HI>commandment</HI>" to him.</P>
<P>And, lastly, the <HI>effects</HI> of <HI>this</HI> to our apostle;—"Sin revived, and he died."</P>
<P>FIRST, we are to notice in <HI>what sense</HI> Saint Paul "was <HI>alive</HI> without the law once."</P>
<P>There were three kinds of laws which the Almighty deli∣vered to the people of Israel.—The <HI>ceremonial law,</HI> which prescribed the rituals of their religion;—the <HI>judicial law,</HI> by which justice was administered among them,—and that law which is <HI>stiled moral,</HI> which enjoined the whole of their duty to God, their neighbors and themselves.—And it was this last mentioned law that our apostle had in view, when he said, that he was "alive without the law."</P>
<P>Very frequent, in the sacred writings, we perceive that a <HI>state</HI> of SIN or IMPIETY, is compared to a <HI>state</HI> of DEATH. And also, that a <HI>return</HI> to VIRTUE, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> RIGH∣TEOUSNESS, is compared to LIFE.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021347_0015_0FB31BE1124A4428"/>In <HI>this sense</HI> we are to understand our Lord, when, in the parable of the prodigal son, it is said; "this my son <HI>was dead,</HI> and <HI>is alive again;</HI> he was lost, and is found."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>The same ideas are conveyed by our Saviour in these words. "I am the resurrection and the life. He that be∣lieveth on me, though he <HI>were dead,</HI>—yet <HI>shall he live.</HI> And whosoever <HI>liveth,</HI> and believeth in me, shall <HI>never die;</HI>"<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">John xi. 25.</NOTE> or not eternally perish.</P>
<P>In such language, Saint Paul often expressed himself. In his epistle to the Romans, he says; "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be <HI>dead,</HI> indeed, unto sin, but <HI>alive</HI> unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of un∣righteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God, as those who are <HI>alive</HI> from the <HI>dead.</HI>"<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"And you," said he to the Ephesians, "hath God <HI>quick∣ened,</HI> who <HI>were dead</HI> in trespasses and sins."<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this same mode of speech, in the Revelations of Saint John, was the church in Sardis reproved for their declensi∣on in goodness; or defect in righteousness.</P>
<P>"These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou <HI>livest,</HI> and art dead."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>When Saint Paul, therefore, agreeable to this manner of expression, "was <HI>alive</HI> without the law,"—we must con∣clude that he thought <HI>most favourably</HI> of his spiritual condi∣tion; that he assured himself he was in a state of grace, and an heir of salvation.</P>
<P>At that period, he says he was "<HI>alive without</HI> the <HI>law;</HI>" —not without a knowledge of the LETTER of it; but of it's SPIRIT; of it's DEMANDS; the extension and purity of it's precepts:—Or, he then flattered himself he <HI>duly honored</HI> the law, and was entitled to justification before God, through an observance of it's commands.</P>
<P>He was then <HI>"alive;"</HI> free from the terrors of guilt; free from all doubts and fears respecting his title to immortal happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="021347_0016_0FB31BE28F80C3E8"/>At that moment we behold him as a PHARISEE of the <HI>first character;</HI> priding himself in his OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; —his strict observance of the Sabbath; his frequent fastings and deeds of mortification;—his payment of tythes of all things tythable which he possessed;—his zeal for the pro∣pagation of the jewish religion;—his extraordinary acts of devotion, and almsgiving to the distressed.</P>
<P>He then could solace himself with the reflection, that he was not chargeable with any gross vice; and "thank God that he was not as other men were; extortioners, unjust, adulterers;"<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 11.</NOTE> but that, in his own esteem, and in his own words, "as touching the righteousness of the law, he was blameless.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>While in this situation, he was raising the superstructure of his hopes of salvation upon the <HI>unstable foundation</HI> of the <HI>merit</HI> of his GOOD WORKS.</P>
<P>Being entirely ignorant of the necessity of the RIGHTE∣OUSNESS of CHRIST, to be appropriated to him <HI>by</HI> FAITH, he was endeavoring to establish his OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; not attending to this great truth of the gospel, that "CHRIST is the <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>law,</HI> for RIGHTEOUSNESS to every one who <HI>believeth</HI> in him."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus was Saint Paul in the "wide and broad way, that leadeth to destruction," while he flattered himself he was in the "strait and narrow path which conducts to salvation!"</P>
<P>Elevated he was to the pinnacle of danger, while he ap∣prehended he was resting on the rock of ages!—Most dan∣gerous, indeed, was his situation; though, to him, pleasing was the delusion!</P>
<P>Had he been arrested by the hand of death, while thus trusting to his <HI>own goodness,</HI> for acceptance with God,— how wretched would have been his state!</P>
<P>But it pleased the Almighty to behold him in compassion; to awaken him to a sense of his danger. And this was ef∣fected, by the "<HI>coming</HI> of the <HI>commandment</HI>" to his <HI>mind,</HI> through the efficacy of the spirit of grace. "When the <HI>commandment came,</HI> sin revived, and I died."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="021347_0017_0FB31BE40F4A65F0"/>In strictness of speech, it may be said the "command∣ment came" to men, when it was delivered by the Almighty to Moses, on Mount Sinai. But it could not, in this man∣ner, come to our apostle; as the law was given more than fifteen hundred years before he existed.</P>
<P>In one sense, it may be said, "the commandment came" to him, when he was taught it in his youth. But we can∣not suppose the commandment thus came to Saint Paul, a∣greeable to his meaning in the text. As he was educated a Pharisee, he, in the early part of his life, became acquainted with the letter of the law;—but several years elapsed, after he thus attained a knowledge of the commandment, before he uttered the words before us.</P>
<P>We, therefore, conclude, that when "the commandment came" to him, he beheld it, in ALL its FORCE, EXTENT, and SPIRITUALITY;—he was <HI>then convinced,</HI> that it was designed, not only to regulate his <HI>external demeanor,</HI> but to reform, govern, and purify his HEART. He then became sensible of that important truth, inculcated by our Saviour, in his exposition of the law, that "<HI>out</HI> of the <HI>heart</HI> proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witness, blasphemies."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xv. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our apostle then beheld the imperfection that attended even his most righteous acts, and how far he was from the heavenly kingdom. He then, indeed, had a just view of himself in the glass of the law; he had an eye to see that it is "holy, just and good;"<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 12.</NOTE> to discern, that it "requires <HI>truth</HI> in the <HI>inward parts,</HI>"<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 6.</NOTE> and he had an ear to hear it's denunciation of divine wrath against the person who shall violate even the least of its precepts.<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>When the commandment <HI>thus came</HI> to Saint Paul, the <HI>scene</HI> was <HI>changed;</HI> he was no longer a <HI>proud</HI> PHARISEE; but became an <HI>humble</HI> PENITENT;—his understanding was enlightened; the veil of ignorance and delusion was with∣drawn from his eyes; his conscience was alarmed; he felt
<PB N="19" REF="021347_0018_0FB31BE5B302AF70"/>
the pressure of sin, the terrors of guilt.—In him <HI>"sin revi∣ved;"</HI> —not to be <HI>indulged;</HI> to <HI>reign;</HI> to <HI>live;</HI> but to <HI>die;</HI> —he endured it's anguish, and beheld it's ingratitude, base∣ness and demerits.</P>
<P>Until that period, the viper of iniquity, if we may be in∣dulged the similitude, lay in his breast, as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> state of DEATH;—but then it became <HI>animated;</HI> it pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced him to the heart with its sting; which not only occasioned pain, but was productive of the pangs of death.</P>
<P>"Sin <HI>revived,</HI> and he <HI>died.</HI>"— All his hopes of salvation, by virtue of his own righteousness, were then <HI>no more;</HI>— he then perceived that he was obnoxious to the <HI>curse</HI> of the <HI>divine law;</HI>—justly exposed to eternal condemnation;— his heart was then <HI>truly</HI> contrite, and the language of his soul was, "what he should do to be saved?"<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 30.</NOTE>—He could then supplicate Heaven in the language of penitence; "God be merciful to me a sinner!"<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>Then those deeds of righteousness which he regarded as "<HI>gain</HI> to him, he counted," as he says, "<HI>loss,</HI> for CHRIST." <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 7.</NOTE>—Then "he resolved to be found <HI>in Christ,</HI> not having on his own righteousness which was of the law, but that which was <HI>through faith</HI> in the divine Saviour."<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">ibid. vers. 9.</NOTE>—And then it was, that "the commandment which was ordained unto LIFE, (to those who should perfectly obey it) he "found," as he himself expresses it, "to be unto DEATH."<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Happy was it for Saint Paul, that he thus died, that he might live forever!—From that moment, he felt in himself the pulse of a spiritual life;—he was delivered from the burthen of sin;—he enjoyed the smiles of Heaven;—he be∣came most studious to please God;—he had a just detestati∣on of vice;—his soul was enamoured with the love of vir∣tue;— his affections were supremely fixed on the Almighty, —he served him with chearfulness, and from principle;— the great object of his pursuit was, the promotion of the glory of God, and the salvation of men;—his pleasures were holy, and his hopes of redemption, scriptural.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="021347_0019_0FB31BE8B7F68DA8"/>Then it was, indeed, that he "passed from death unto life;"<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">John v. 24.</NOTE>—that he was "turned from darkness unto LIGHT; from the power of Satan unto God:"<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 18.</NOTE>—And then too it was, to speak in his own language, that he "received the Spirit of adoption, whereby he could cry, Abba, Father;"<NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE> that "the Spirit itself bore witness with his spirit, that he was a child of God; an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ of immortal happiness!"<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">ibid. vers. 16, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>How great, how blessed are the <HI>effects</HI> of <HI>Christianity!</HI>— We perceive it is designed to <HI>humble</HI> our PRIDE; to divest us of <HI>all dependance</HI> on OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS for salvation, that we may rely only on the MERITS of CHRIST for eternal happiness;—that it is intended to illume the un∣derstanding; to give us contritions of heart; to reconcile us to the Almighty;—to renovate our souls; to restore us to holiness; the love, service, favour, and enjoyment of God!</P>
<P>How <HI>great</HI> was the CHANGE Saint Paul experienced, when he embraced the gospel!—And SUCH a CHANGE must WE <HI>experience,</HI> if by US it hath not been experienced, or we <HI>cannot enter</HI> into the kingdom of Heaven!</P>
<P>As Saint Paul was "alive without the law," it is feared, there are many, at present, in a <HI>similar</HI> situation. But un∣less they shall <HI>suffer</HI> the "<HI>Commandment</HI> to <HI>come" to them;</HI> to penetrate their hearts;—to awaken in them a sense of guilt;—to cause sin in their minds to revive, and, in conse∣quence thereof, themselves in this manner, to expire in death; to relinquish their delusive hopes of salvation, they <HI>must perish for ever!</HI></P>
<P>For "the wages of sin is death;"<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE>—the impenitent will be deprived of salvation;—there is "no other name;" no other righteousness, "by which we can be saved, but <HI>that</HI> of CHRIST;"<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 12.</NOTE>—and except we are <HI>regenerate,</HI> or "<HI>born</HI> of the SPIRIT," we are assured, "we cannot see the king∣dom of God!"<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">John iii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="021347_0020_0FB31BEB8DB12850"/>From the <HI>religious experience</HI> of SAINT PAUL, that we have noticed; or the progress of grace in his heart, which he hath left upon record, and no doubt for our spiritual ad∣vantage, we may make the following practical observations.</P>
<P>FIRST: As Saint Paul, even while he was a zealous pro∣fessor of religion, and a rigid observer of its external duties, was indulging <HI>fallacious hopes</HI> of redemption,—we may no∣tice the propensity mankind have to entertain <HI>unjust con∣ceptions</HI> of their title to salvation; or the probability there is of their <HI>being deceived,</HI> with respect to their religious state.</P>
<P>Our apostle was far from being <HI>singular,</HI> in this instance. —The Jews in general vainly expected to attain salvation by their <HI>imperfect observance</HI> of the precepts of the law; and this occasioned them to <HI>reject</HI> the RIGHTEOUSNESS of CHRIST.</P>
<P>"But Israel," saith Saint Paul, "which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righte∣ousness," (or to the righteousness that God accepteth.) Wherefore? Because, they sought it, <HI>not</HI> by <HI>faith;</HI> but, as it were, by the <HI>works</HI> of the <HI>law;</HI> for they stumbled at that stumbling stone."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 31, 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>The law demands a <HI>perfect obedience</HI> of each of its injunc∣tions; and as all men are sinful, "by the <HI>deeds</HI> of the <HI>law,</HI> therefore, we are assured, <HI>no flesh</HI> shall be <HI>justified</HI> before God;"<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 20.</NOTE> or obtain salvation.</P>
<P>It was the unhappiness of too many of the people of Israel, previous to the promulgation of the gospel, that, in like manner, they were deceiving themselves; saying in their hearts, in the words of the prophet Jeremiah, "Peace, peace, when there was no peace!"<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>And is there not too much reason to apprehend, that <HI>great numbers,</HI> even of the <HI>professors</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> cherish the same spirit of <HI>delusion;</HI> that some flatter themselves they are the heirs of salvation, by reason they have felt, perhaps, some compunction for sin; have experienced a partial re∣formation of their lives; are just in their dealings, and are
<PB N="22" REF="021347_0021_0FB31BEE4874DB20"/>
observant of the devotional parts of religion?—That others, willing to magnify the grace of God, promise themselves immortal happiness, by virtue of their faith only in Christ, while they are almost wholly regardless of his commands?</P>
<P>It cannot reasonably be doubted, but that, in a variety of ways, many persons countenance erroneous hopes of salva∣tion; and, painful is the reflection, it is not improbable, but that great numbers, even leave the world in this state of <HI>deception!</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord assures us, that in the day of judgment, many, in vain, will claim a title to salvation. They will say to him, "Lord! Lord! have we not prophesied in thy name; in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?" But he will then say unto them; "I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniqui∣ty!"<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 22, 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>Will it not, therefore, be wisdom in us to regard the a∣postolic council, to "<HI>examine ourselves</HI> whether we are in the faith?"<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>"<HI>Try me,</HI> O God!" said the Psalmist, "and seek the ground of my heart! <HI>prove me,</HI> and <HI>examine</HI> my thoughts! <HI>Look well</HI> if there be any wickedness in me!"<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxix. 23, 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>How worthy is <HI>such conduct</HI> of our <HI>imitation!</HI>—And most true it is, that if we indulge ourselves in "any wickedness," we are not entitled to salvation. "For he," saith St. John, "who is born of God, <HI>sinneth not;</HI> but he keepeth himself and the wicked one toucheth him not!"<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>SECONDLY: As "by the law, we are informed, is the <HI>knowledge</HI> of <HI>sin;</HI>"<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 20.</NOTE> as "the law, it is said, is a SCHOOL MASTER to bring us to Christ,"<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 24.</NOTE>—how grateful should we be to God, for dispensing to us the law?</P>
<P>And that it may be instrumental in giving us a proper sense of <HI>sin,</HI> we perceive the propriety of <HI>preaching</HI> the LAW, in ALL IT'S EXTENT, PURITY and TERROR.</P>
<P>Thus was it preached by the prophets, by our Lord and
<PB N="23" REF="021347_0022_0FB31BF1A6A99D10"/>
his apostles. And never will mankind be properly disposed to listen to the invitation of MERCY, offered in the GOSPEL, until they shall suffer themselves to pay due attention to the <HI>voice</HI> of the LAW.</P>
<P>Until Saint Paul did thus, he was <HI>"a live;"</HI> disesteemed the righteousness of Christ; but "when the <HI>commandment came,</HI>" he was sensible of his unhappiness, and duly prized the salvation of the gospel. We discern, therefore, the <HI>im∣portance</HI> of <HI>cherishing convictions</HI> for <HI>sin,</HI> that we may be in∣clined to repair to Christ, by faith, for redemption.</P>
<P>THIRDLY: As the law is thus subservient to our salva∣tion, it should, on this account, be <HI>highly reverenced</HI> by us.</P>
<P>And we should also greatly esteem it, for its moral excel∣lence. Though we are "saved by grace, through faith,"<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 8.</NOTE> our Saviour most forcibly enjoins on us a sincere and uni∣versal observance of the precepts of the law. Without which, indeed, or "without holiness," it is declared, we cannot enjoy salvation.<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>What a reverential and affectionate regard had DAVID, for the LAW of GOD?</P>
<P>"O how I love," said he, "thy law! It is my meditation all the day! How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth."<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 97, 103.</NOTE> "I love thy com∣mandments above gold! Yea, above fine gold!"<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">ibid. vers. 127.</NOTE></P>
<P>How did Saint Paul inculcate the commands of the law, and regard them in his life?</P>
<P>"Shall we continue in sin," said he, "that grace may abound? God forbid! How shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>And, it is affirmed by him, that "those who are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts."<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 24</NOTE></P>
<P>LASTLY: Most happy was it for our apostle, that he <HI>did not suppress</HI> his convictions for sin, but suffered "the com∣mandment" to have access to his HEART; as these convic∣tions terminated in his salvation!</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="021347_0023_0FB31BF3142FFFD0"/>If WE regard OUR <HI>Redemption,</HI> let <HI>such</HI> be OUR CON∣DUCT!</P>
<P>Let us not be wedded to iniquity!</P>
<P>Let us break off our sins by righteousness!</P>
<P>Let us not indulge delusive hopes of salvation!</P>
<P>Now to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, be ascribed all honor and glory, henceforth, and for ever!</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CORINTHIANS v. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>We walk by faith, not by sight.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is no inconsiderable recommendation of Christianity, that it's benevolent intention is to advance the <HI>present</HI> and <HI>future happiness</HI> of mankind. In this life, it affords the highest satisfaction our nature is capable of; and, at death, opens to our view, the pleasing prospect of a blessed im∣mortality.</P>
<P>This future felicity, our holy apostle contemplates; re∣flects on with pleasure, and pants after; as we are informed in the beginning of the chapter we have named. "For we know," says he, "that if our earthly house of this taber∣nacle were dissolved, we have a building of God; an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan earnestly, desiring rather to be cloathed upon with our house which is from heaven."</P>
<P>Saint Paul then ascribes the aspirations which Christians have after immortal happiness, and their capability to par∣ticipate of celestial joys, to the <HI>influences</HI> of the divine SPI∣RIT.—"Now he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God, who hath given us the <HI>earnest</HI> of his SPI∣RIT."</P>
<P>Our apostle next considers the professors of Christianity, while here, as in a state of pilgrimage, and, in the words be∣fore us, mentions what it is that directs their steps; <HI>governs,</HI> and <HI>influences them</HI> in this world. "We <HI>walk by</HI> FAITH: not by sight."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021347_0025_0FB31BF62A3849E0"/>As, in these words, it is declared, that FAITH <HI>directs</HI> our <HI>conduct;</HI> and as <HI>great virtue</HI> is <HI>ascribed</HI> to <HI>faith,</HI> in the sa∣cred writings, we will beg leave to attend to it's <HI>nature,</HI> and to regard the truth, that it is <HI>"by faith,"</HI> the sincere profes∣sors of the gospel <HI>"walk,"</HI> and <HI>"not by sight."</HI></P>
<P>Faith, <HI>in general,</HI> may be said to be a persuasion of the truth of those things, of which we are <HI>informed,</HI> but of which we have <HI>no ocular</HI> nor <HI>sensible demonstration.</HI></P>
<P>As such is the nature of faith, it may pertain to the things which are of <HI>this world,</HI> as well as of the <HI>world above;</HI> or, it may be said, there is a faith which is <HI>earthly,</HI> and that which is <HI>heavenly,</HI> or <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P>The objects of <HI>earthly faith,</HI> are <HI>innumerable:</HI> What men of distinguished character; what cities; what kingdoms; what empires have existed, and do now exist, at a distance from us?—How many events have happened? What changes have there been in the natural and political world? How numerous, indeed, are the things, of which we are inform∣ed, but which are not within the circle of our observation?</P>
<P>The objects of <HI>religious faith,</HI> are also <HI>many.</HI> They include the being of a God, and all his attributes, as revealed to us in the holy scriptures; the plurality of persons in the God∣head, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the formation of the universe;—divine providence;—the economy of our redemption, as exhibited in the gospel;—the immortality of our souls;—the resurrection of our bodies;—the dissolution of the world;—a day of judgment;—everlasting rewards or punishments, according to our actions in the present state.</P>
<P>Or, in other words, the objects of this faith, are <HI>all</HI> the doctrines and precepts; promises and threatnings, and par∣ticulars contained in the sacred writings.</P>
<P>In <HI>one sense,</HI> when we give our assent to the truths of di∣vine Revelation, it may be said, we are possessed of <HI>faith;</HI> but as the scriptures enumerate several kinds of faith, it will be proper to notice them, that we may have a just appre∣hension of that faith, which is essential to our salvation.</P>
<P>Does a person <HI>believe</HI> the <HI>gospel?</HI> Does he take upon him the Christian profession?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="021347_0026_0FB31BF7E5990FA0"/>But does he <HI>continue in his sins;</HI> a slave of vice?—Is his faith <HI>uninfluential</HI> on his conduct; is it merely speculative?</P>
<P>If thus, it is <HI>not</HI> the faith specified in the text;—but that which Saint James alludes to, when be says; "Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works; Thou believest there is one God; thou dost well; the devils also believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, the <HI>faith without works is dead?</HI>"<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">James ii. 19, 20.</NOTE>—Unavailable; insufficient to thy salvation.</P>
<P>A sect of <HI>libertine Christians,</HI> (the disciples of Simon Magus, termed Gnosticks) arose in the days of the apostles; they pretended to extraordinary illuminations from Heaven, and taught that nothing more was required of men to obtain salvation, than <HI>faith only,</HI> in Christ; and thus they encour∣aged the <HI>most licentious practices.</HI></P>
<P>Saint James confutes their impious doctrine; evinces the necessity of moral goodness, as the fruits of faith, and affirms, that "as the body without the spirit is dead; so faith, without works, is dead also.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">ibid. vers. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our Lord, in the parable of the Sower, speaks of a faith that is <HI>temporary.</HI></P>
<P>Those who have it, "hear the word with joy; they receive the gospel, even with rapture, and make a splendid professi∣on of virtue; but not being established in goodness, "they believe for <HI>a while</HI> and in time of temptation <HI>fall away;</HI>"<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Matt. viii. 13.</NOTE> —they are such as "put the hand to the plough and <HI>look back;</HI>"<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 62.</NOTE> in the words of Saint Paul, they "make ship∣wreck of faith and a good conscience;"<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 19.</NOTE>—or "cast off their first faith."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>This temporary faith, as well as that which is merely spe∣culative, we have too often <HI>exemplified</HI> among the professors of Christianity. It is a serious truth, indeed, that vast num∣bers of those who assume the Christian name, are, in no sort, or, but very little influenced by their faith, to the re∣proach of Christianity, and to the great increase of their guilt!</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="021347_0027_0FB31BF9CD0822C8"/>The holy scriptures also mention a faith by which <HI>mira∣cles were wrought.</HI></P>
<P>The apostles performed miracles, but, as they acknow∣ledged, not by their own power, but by virtue of their faith in Christ.</P>
<P>Saint Peter gave healing to an object of distress, a cripple from his infancy, "who was daily laid at the beautiful gate of the temple," to excite charity from the benevolent. When the multitude saw the man "walking, leaping and praising God, they were filled with wonder and amazement." And unto them, said the apostle, "Why marvel ye at this? Or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though, by our own pow∣er, or holiness, we had made this man to walk? The God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye deli∣vered up. And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Acts iii.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such faith some men may have had, who did not obtain salvation; for our Lord assures us, that many who shall have "prophesied in his name; and in his name shall have cast out Devils, and done many wonderful works," shall, at last, be rejected by him, because they were "workers of iniqui∣ty."<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 22, 23.</NOTE> "And," saith Saint Paul, "though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith; so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>The sacred writings likewise mention those who <HI>had faith</HI> to <HI>rely</HI> on the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> to <HI>work miracles.</HI></P>
<P>"Speak the word only," said the Centurion to Christ, "and my servant shall be healed." "As thou hast believ∣ed," it was answered by our Saviour, "so be it done unto thee."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Matt. viii. 8, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"A woman of Canaan," we are informed, solicited Christ in behalf of her daughter, who was "grievously vexed with a Devil." "O woman," said our Lord to her, "great is thy faith! Be it unto thee even as thou wilt."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xv. 22, 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>But we have not evidence sufficient to induce us to be∣lieve,
<PB N="29" REF="021347_0028_0FB31BFD783B7260"/>
that <HI>all</HI> those who had this faith in Christ, received him as the Saviour of the world, or submitted to his dispen∣sation of grace. For, it is probable, that some who thus believed in Christ, regarded him as a Prophet only.

<P>The faith that entitles us to salvation, is preceded by re∣pentance. "Repent ye," said our Saviour, "and believe the gospel,"<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Matt. i. 15.</NOTE> And Saint Paul, "testified both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 21.</NOTE> By this faith, men are <HI>reconciled</HI> to God; <HI>delivered</HI> from the <HI>punishment</HI> due to their <HI>sins,</HI> and▪ through the operations of the divine Spirit, <HI>restored</HI> to <HI>holiness,</HI> to a meetness for the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>It is the declaration of the divine word, that our salvation is "of <HI>grace through faith.</HI>"<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>"The just," saith the prophet Habakkuk, "shall live by faith."<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Habak. ii. 4.</NOTE></P>

<P>The sacrifice of the death of Christ, was the great atone∣ment for human guilt;—"he gave himself a ransom for all;"<NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 6.</NOTE> he "tasted death for every man;"<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 9.</NOTE>—and, there∣fore it is, that the apostle, last mentioned, affirms, that "we are justified freely by the grace of God, through the redemp∣tion

that is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood; to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; that he might be just, and the jus∣tifier of him who believeth in Jesus."<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 24, 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>And "being justified," says the same apostle, "by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ."<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is manifest, however, that the faith, by which we ob∣tain reconciliation with God, and a title to Heaven, is in us an <HI>active principle;</HI>—the <HI>parent</HI> of <HI>virtue.</HI></P>
<P>It is declared, that it "worketh by love;"<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 6.</NOTE>—that it "purifieth the heart,"<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 9.</NOTE>—and that by it we <HI>"walk;"— make progress</HI> in holiness.</P>
<P>It may be justly said, indeed, of <HI>this faith,</HI> that it not only gains us admittance into the heavenly world, and is produc∣tive of righteousness; but that it is to us the source of con∣solation; and that we experience it's happy effects in various circumstances and conditions of life;—"for <HI>we walk;</HI>" are <HI>influenced,</HI> "by <HI>faith,</HI> not by sight."</P>
<P>Does the world exhibit it's allurements to rob us of virtue?</P>
<P>What but <HI>faith</HI> occasions us to <HI>rise superior</HI> to <HI>it's temp∣tations;</HI> to behold, with holy indifference, the glare of rich∣es; the tinsel of vanity, and causes us duly to govern our passions?</P>
<P>The <HI>effect</HI> of <HI>faith</HI> was very visible in the conduct of MO∣SES, when in Egypt. By virtue of his faith, he rejected all the pomp and power; all the wealth and pleasures, even of a kingdom, and chose a state of humiliation and affliction, that he might enjoy immortal happiness.</P>
<P>"By <HI>faith,</HI>" saith Saint Paul, "<HI>Moses,</HI> when he came to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God; than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of

<P>Most just, indeed, is the assertion of Saint John, that "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 4,</NOTE></P>
<P>Do we <HI>love</HI> GOD <HI>supremely?</HI> Do we render him the <HI>oblation</HI> of our <HI>hearts?</HI></P>
<P>But should we do thus, unless, <HI>through faith,</HI> we realized to our Minds, the excellence of his nature; his wisdom and purity; his justice and mercy; his goodness and truth, and other perfections?</P>
<P>Impossible is it to love an object, that doth not appear to us amiable or lovely. As the divine Being is possessed of every possible excellence, and as we naturally love beauty and perfection, we are almost unavoidably inclined to love God, when, by faith, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sposition of virtue, we behold his perfections.</P>
<P>What is it, but <HI>faith,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> renders the <HI>divine</HI> SAVIOUR of the world an object to us so <HI>attractive?</HI>—Faith beholds CHRIST astonishing the whole heavenly world with his LOVE; laboring; toiling; bleeding; dying, that we may live for ever!</P>

<P>And what obedience is <HI>so perfect; so acceptable</HI> to God, as that which originates from <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>love?</HI></P>
<P>Are we assailed by the Prince of darkness?—Does he cast his fiery darts around us for our destruction?—And are we not exhorted to "take the <HI>shield</HI> of <HI>faith,</HI> that we may be enabled to repel these assaults, and be preserved from his power?<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 16.</NOTE></P>

<P>What was it, but <HI>faith,</HI> that inspired them with patience and resignation; equanimity and chearfulness; fidelity and fortitude, under these tryals so painful to human nature?</P>
<P>It was <HI>through faith,</HI> Saint Paul informs us, that some of the worthies of old, "took joyfully the spoiling of their goods; that others, were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection; that others had trial of cruel mockings, and scourgings; bonds and im∣prisonment; that they were stoned; sawn asunder; tempt∣ed, and slain with the sword."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 34. xi. 35, 36, 37.</NOTE></P>

<P>Do some men relinquish their worldly expectations of emolument?

<P>What was it but <HI>faith,</HI> in it's full operation on the apos∣tles,
<PB N="33" REF="021347_0032_0FB31C047679ADC0"/>
that caused them to disseminate the truths of Christia∣nity, in distant regions, through incredible fatigue, and suf∣ferings; and at the expence of every thing estimable in life, and even of life itself?</P>
<P>What is it but <HI>faith</HI> in the merits of the compassionate Sa∣viour, that gives consolation to the breast of guilt, and occa∣sions us to "rejoice evermore,"<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. v. 16.</NOTE> as well as "in every thing to give thanks?"<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vers. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>Is it any thing but <HI>faith</HI> that causes us to revere, to delight in, the divine precepts; to trust in the divine promises, and to fear the divine threatnings?</P>
<P>Is it not <HI>faith</HI> that gives efficacy to our prayers, and ena∣bles us to render the Almighty an acceptable service?<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 6. Jam. i. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was it not <HI>faith</HI> that gave virtue to the sacrifice of Abel; while that of Cain was rejected?<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>What enables us to <HI>persevere</HI> in righteousness, but <HI>faith?</HI> "The life that I now live in the flesh," said Saint Paul, "I live <HI>by faith</HI> in the Son of God."<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was it not <HI>through faith,</HI> that this holy apostle triumphed over every impediment in the path of his duty; "fought the good fight," and received "a crown of life?"<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what but <HI>faith</HI> can console us in the hour of our dis∣solution; disarm death of it's terrors; occasion us to meet it, not only without fear, but with serenity, and even with joy?</P>
<P>As FAITH thus affects and governs us;—is the spring of virtue; sustains us in afflictions; inspires us with ardor to promote the glory of God and the salvation of mankind; causes us to render our hearts an acceptable offering to the Almighty; gives efficacy to our devotions; enables us to

retain our integrity; to rejoice in tribulations; supports no in death, and, at all times, and in all places, influences our thoughts, words and actions, and occasions us to be solicitous to approve ourselves to Heaven; we therefore perceive the propriety of the apostolic assertion, that the sincere Christ∣ian "<HI>walks</HI> by FAITH, and <HI>not</HI> by SIGHT."</P>
<P>He is not governed by <HI>worldly maxims;</HI> he is not influ∣enced by <HI>worldly objects,</HI> fashions, vanities and pleasures. "He is crucified to the world, and the world to him;"<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 14.</NOTE> "he looks," says an apostle, "not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen;"—knowing, that "the things which are seen, are temporal; but that the things which are not seen, are eternal."<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 18.</NOTE> Though while here, DUTY occasions him to <HI>pay attention</HI> to <HI>earthly objects,</HI> on these he fixes not his <HI>affections;</HI> "if riches increase, he sets not his heart upon them;"<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxii. 10.</NOTE> his enjoyments are spi∣ritual; his hopes and expectations are most exalted; and as "he hath here no continuing city, he therefore, seeks a better country, even an heavenly one."<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus we have paid some attention to the nature of faith, and shewn that by it the worthy professors of Christianity "<HI>walk,</HI> and <HI>not by sight.</HI>"</P>
<P>From what hath been said, we behold the <HI>importance</HI> of evangelical FAITH; that <HI>devoid of</HI> IT, we must be devoid of the religion of the gospel; destitute of it's holiness; it's promises; it's consolations, and pleasures.</P>
<P>How becoming, therefore, is it for us to adopt the language of the apostles; "Lord, increase our faith!"<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>How proper to pay a due attention to the devotional parts of religion; the reception of the Lord's supper; public and private prayer, by which ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearts are molified, and our faith is invigorated, established, and rendered influential on our conduct?</P>
<P>From what hath been delivered, we also perceive the pu∣rity of our <HI>religion,</HI> that if we indulge our <HI>evil propensities,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="021347_0034_0FB31C080CE70250"/>
or <HI>"walk by sight,"</HI> we have no claim to <HI>that faith</HI> which our Saviour demands as necessary to our salvation.</P>
<P>A life of <HI>impiety,</HI> is a life of virtual <HI>infidelity;</HI> a denial in our deeds, of what we profess with our lips. Such conduct is not only most reproachful, but renders us obnoxious to the severity of the divine displeasure!</P>
<P>Will it not, therefore, be wisdom in those who are regard∣less of virtue, through divine aid, so to realize to their minds the various <HI>objects</HI> of <HI>faith,</HI> and the <HI>importance</HI> of <HI>religion,</HI> that, in future, their conduct may be worthy of their Chris∣tian character; that they may escape that awful doom, which will be pronounced against those who <HI>believe not</HI> the gospel of Christ?</P>
<P>Happy are <HI>those</HI> who are <HI>duly influenced</HI> by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ith!</HI> By persevering in the way of righteousness, how felicitous will be the reward of their toil!</P>
<P>Soon will not faith be exchanged for vision!—Soon will they not behold, not "as through a glass darkly; but face to face!"<NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what beauteous objects;—what dazzling glories; what scenes of bliss, will open to their view for their ever∣lasting possession and enjoyment?</P>
<P>That WE may be the blest number of <HI>those</HI> who shall par∣ticipate of the effects, the unspeakable rewards of FAITH, will God Almighty of his infinite mercy be pleased to grant; for the sake of the merits of the divine, compassionate Jesus; to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be ascribed all honor and glory, adoration and praise, now, henceforth, and for ever!</P>

<P>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was at Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.

<P>AS the <HI>sacred rite</HI> of CONFIRMATION, hath this day been admistered to many of this congregation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Saint Paul's Chapel, there were about five hundred and fifty who were <HI>confirmed,</HI> and among these, many of the most respectable members of the congregation.</NOTE> it will not be improper to pay some attention to this institution.</P>
<P>Anciently, it was stiled, the perfection; the unction; ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignation; the imposition of hands; the sign, or seal, of the Lord;—but, in modern ages, it hath generally obtained the name of confirmation;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Bingham's Antiquities of the Christian Church, Vol. I.

<PB N="38" REF="021347_0036_0FB31C0E73055720"/>
in answer to our prayers, to obtain grace and ability, proper∣ly to regard our Christian obligations.</P>
<P>This rite was administered only by those of the Episcopal character; except in extraordinary cases, when a Presbyter, by a Bishop's authority, was empowered to confirm,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Eusebius's Eccles. Hist. Lib. vi. Cap. xlii. Fleury's Eccles. Hist. vol. I. p. 59. vol. III. p. 293. vol. IV. p. 330. vol. V. p. 670. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pin's Eccles.

If he was absent, as he generally was, when baptism was received by those in churches at a distance from the mother church; or by such as were baptized in haste, on beds of sickness, confirmation was deferred until the bishop could have a convenient op∣portunity to visit them.</P>
<P>This information we receive from St. Jerome,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saint Jerome</HI> was born about the year of our Lord 340. He is esteemed to have been the most learned and eloquent of all the fathers. See Lives of the Fathers, vol. II. page 455.</NOTE> who says; "That it was customary in the church, for bishops to go and invocate the Holy Spirit, by imposition of hands, on such as were baptized by presbyters and deacons, in villages and places remote from the mother church."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hieron. cout. Lucifer. Cap. iv.</NOTE></P>
<P>As it often happened that such persons died before the bishop could attend them for this purpose, to prevent this inconvenience, as far as possible, the canons, in some places, required that bishops should visit their diocesis annually; and if they were so extensive that this could not be effected, their diocesis were to be reduced into smaller districts.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Se Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I. Fol. 526.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is required, by our church, that those to <HI>be confirmed,</HI> shall have arrived to years of discretion, and attained a know∣ledge
<PB N="39" REF="021347_0037_0FB31C0F8FF8AF20"/>
of the essential doctrines of Christianity; understand the nature of this institution, and receive it with freedom and deliberation.</P>
<P>Our catechism is stiled "An instruction to be learned of every person, before he be brought to be confirmed by the bishop;"—which is appointed to be done, "so soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord's prayer, and the ten command∣ments, in the vulgar tongue, and be farther instructed in the church catechism, set forth for that purpose."</P>
<P>The preface to our office of confirmation, very clearly expresses the knowledge that is demanded of those who shall be confirmed, and declares also, the nature and end of confir∣mation. After reading of which, the following very serious and important question is addressed to those who wish to be confirmed.</P>
<P>"Do ye here, in the presence of God, and of this con∣gregation, <HI>renew</HI> the solemn promise and vow that was made in your name at your baptism; <HI>ratifying</HI> and <HI>confirming</HI> the same in your <HI>own persons,</HI> and acknowledging yourselves <HI>bound</HI> to believe, and do all those things which your God-fathers and God-mothers then undertook for you?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It cannot, we imagine, be <HI>improper</HI> for those members of our churches to be <HI>confirmed</HI> who have arrived even to <HI>old age,</HI> and who have not had an opportunity to submit to this holy rite.</P>
<P>Very probably, the greater number of such persons, were baptized in their <HI>infancy,</HI> and with respect to <HI>these,</HI> there are the <HI>same reasons</HI> to be offered why <HI>they</HI> should be <HI>confirmed,</HI> as <HI>those</HI> in <HI>youth.</HI> Indeed, such persons who are advanced in life, should, we conceive, with <HI>alacrity,</HI> embrace the <HI>first opportunity</HI> to partake of the benefits of confirmation.</P>
<P>And <HI>such too,</HI> we apprehend, should be the conduct of those <HI>communicants</HI> among us, who have <HI>not</HI> been con∣firmed.</P>
<P>The holy <HI>sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Lord's supper,</HI> is entirely dis∣tinct from the sacred rite of <HI>confirmation,</HI> and was instituted to answer a <HI>very different end,</HI> viz. to maintain in us a lively sense of <HI>gratitude</HI> for the death and passion of our Saviour. How different is <HI>this</HI> from the <HI>solemn dedication</HI> of ourselves to GOD; the <HI>ratification</HI> of our <HI>baptismal vows</HI> and <HI>promises,</HI> in confirmation?</P>
<P>As it was not intended that the <HI>reception</HI> of the <HI>eucharist</HI> should <HI>release</HI> us from an <HI>observance</HI> of the <HI>sacrament</HI> of <HI>bap∣tism,</HI> we can discern <HI>no reason</HI> why <HI>such</HI> an act should <HI>free</HI> us from a <HI>submission</HI> to <HI>that rite</HI> which is a <HI>recognition</HI> and <HI>confir∣mation</HI> of our <HI>baptism.</HI></P>
<P>He who <HI>communicates,</HI> performs an act of devotion; ex∣presses his thankfulness for the death of Christ; acknow∣ledges his belief in him, and obligations to revere his precepts. And does not the <HI>non-communicant</HI> THUS, when he repeats the Creeds, and joins in the Liturgy of our church?</P>
<P>But as neither of these persons, by such conduct, <HI>for∣mally</HI> takes on himself his <HI>baptismal obligations,</HI> no sufficient reason, we presume, can be rendered, why <HI>both</HI> of them should <HI>not be confirmed,</HI> if they have not received confirm∣ation.</P>
<P>As <HI>this</HI> is an institution of our church; as it is, in itself, <HI>most solemn</HI> and <HI>edifying,</HI> and cannot, with the <HI>least impro∣priety,</HI> be regarded by any <HI>worthy communicant,</HI> for the sake of EXAMPLE, if for <HI>no other end,</HI> communicants, we are of opinion, would act with <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>wisdom,</HI> should they <HI>honor</HI> this <HI>sacred rite.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such,</HI> we are happy to mention, hath been the conduct of communicants in general, of the CLERGY, as well as of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ragations, in the states of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> (and we know not but in the other states.) wherein this rite <HI>hath been</HI> administered; and <HI>hereby,</HI> they have <HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed</HI> their <HI>disposition</HI> to <HI>regard</HI> ALL the <HI>ordinances</HI> of their church; to be <HI>consistent</HI> episcopalians; to <HI>"fulfil all righteousness."</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="021347_0038_0FB31C111006FB48"/>To which, each person solemnly and audibly answers in the affirmative.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="021347_0039_0FB31C12A958F9E8"/>As in this ordinance we so fully recognize our baptismal obligations, and so solemnly dedicate ourselves to the service of God, we, therefore, perceive that <HI>confirmation</HI> obviates several of the objections made to <HI>infant baptism,</HI> and greatly enervates the plea of necessity, of those who deny it's validi∣ty, for <HI>rebaptizing</HI> such as were baptized in their infancy.</P>
<P>It is worthy of observation, that, in the <HI>Jewish church,</HI> a practice prevailed, which, to the Jews, was something simi∣lar to confirmation, with us.</P>
<P>An author of eminence mentions, "That, in the Jewish church, when a child attained the age of thirteen years, the father, having taught him the principles of his religion, pre∣sented him, in a sacred assembly, to undertake, in his own person, to become a son of the precept;—that is, one who takes upon himself, from that period, obedience to the law of God, and to answer for his sins; and that, thereafter, prayer was made for his improvement in grace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buxtorf. Synag. Judaic.</NOTE></P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that <HI>this ceremony,</HI> with great propriety, followed the rite of <HI>circumcision;</HI> which was a fi∣gure of <HI>baptism;</HI> as was the paschal-supper, a symbol of the eucharist.</P>
<P>The imposition of hands and prayer, by the bishop, always attended confirmation; and it was customary to anoint those who were confirmed with oil, to denote that heavenly unction that was received by them from above;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Bingham's antiquities, Vol. I, Fol. 535, 536▪</NOTE> but this practice hath been discontinued by the church, since the mi∣raculous gifts of the Holy Ghost have ceased to be conferred in confirmation.</P>
<P>The sanctifying and more ordinary influences, however, of the divine Spirit, may reasonably be expected to be com∣municated, when this rite is duly administered. Our Savi∣our has been graciously pleased to promise, that the Holy Ghost shall be given to those who ask it:<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 13.</NOTE> And at what time can we so rationally hope to receive this blessing, as in confirmation, when, agreeable to the will of God, and,
<PB N="42" REF="021347_0040_0FB31C154B4C6520"/>
with hearts of purity, we solemnly and publickly dedicate ourselves to him, and when, to our own prayers for his bles∣sing, we have the prayers of the bishop of the church, and of the whole congregation?</P>
<P>The imposition of hands was a ceremony used in all sorts of benedictions;—but more especially in ordination, the re∣conciliation of penitents, and in confirmation.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Augustin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This learned and pious Father was born in 355. Lives of the Fathers, Vol. II. Page 458.</NOTE> derives the imposition of hands, for con∣veying the holy Spirit, from the practice of the apostles;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aug. de Trin. Lib. xv. Cap. xxvi.</NOTE> though there were very different effects from this ordinance, when administered by them, from what there were in the age in which he lived.</P>
<P>It is observed, by a celebrated author, "That though men have not in confirmation, the gift of tongues conferred on them, as in the days of the apostles, they may, notwithstand∣ing, have other gifts, sufficient to testify the presence of the divine Spirit; and also, to entitle the act of the imposition of hands to the dignity of an apostolic institution."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I. Fol, 538.</NOTE></P>
<P>As baptism, in the primitive church, <HI>preceded</HI> confirma∣tion; so this rite was administered, <HI>previous</HI> to the reception of the Lord's supper; and this practice is enjoined by our church.</P>
<P>It was the general custom of the church, in the first ages of christianity, for those who were <HI>confirmed, immediately</HI> to <HI>partake</HI> of the EUCHARIST.

<P>No reasonable objection can be made against <HI>that</HI> person's approaching the table of the Lord who has <HI>worthily</HI> received confirmation;—on the contrary, it is, unquestionably, <HI>most proper;</HI> and it may be of great utility for those who have been <HI>confirmed,</HI> to <HI>partake</HI> of the <HI>Lord's supper;</HI>—that the grace they have received in confirmation, may thereby be augmented; that they may be confirmed in goodness, and, in

<P>It is said by a judicious author; "That the grace which we obtain by the reception of the Eucharist, doth <HI>not begin,</HI> but <HI>continue life.</HI> No man, therefore, receiveth this sacra∣ment <HI>before</HI> baptism; because no dead thing is capable of nourishment."</P>
<P>"Salvation," he adds, "is proposed to all men as their end; and those who, by baptism, have laid the foundation, and attained the first beginnings of a new life, have, in the Lord's supper, nourishment and food provided, for the pre∣servation and perfection of that life."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, Lib. v.

<P>The <HI>usefulness</HI> of confirmation, when properly received, cannot justly be questioned.

<P>"Confirmation," says a pious author, "would highly promote the truth and power of godliness and religion. It would bring good instructions to an happy effect, and cause every one who should receive it, and sin thereafter, to blush and hang down his guilty head, when he should call to mind that good confession which he, in this ordinance, had openly made, before so many witnesses.

He must reflect, that many will appear as witnes∣ses against him, if he shall transgress; that if he is regardless of his duty, he will, at last, bear testimony against himself, be condemned out of his own mouth; and that, if he shall continue to live in a course, contrary to his holy profession, he can expect no other than that awful sentence, mentioned in the gospel, which Christ will pronounce against hypocrites, and all impenitent sinners, in the day of judgment,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Patrick's exhortation to confirmation.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Confirmation," saith an excellent prelate of the church of England, "is the consummation and perfection; the cor∣roboration and strength of baptism, and baptismal grace. In baptism, we undertake to do our duty; in confirmation, we receive further aid to perform it. In baptism, others pro∣mise for us; in confirmation, we engage for ourselves; we release our sponsers from their obligations made, at the font, in our behalf, and take them on ourselves; and we receive the advantage of the prayers of the bishop, and all the church, offered up in our favour. In baptism, we give up our names to Christ, in confirmation, we put our seal to our profession, and God affixes his seal to his promise."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bishop Taylor, on confirmation.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was, therefore, with great reason that a learned and pious author, thus expressed himself on this subject. "There is no cause." said he, "wherefore we would doubt that we shall not receive benefit from confirmation; but certainly cause to complain of the neglect of this christian institu∣tion."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hooker's Eccles.

<P>Though the ancient fathers of the church, did not esteem confirmation essentially necessary to salvation, to those who had been baptised; they, however, entertained so high an idea of the <HI>utility</HI> of this rite, that if by any persons it was treated with neglect or contempt, such, we are informed, were ordinarily denied ecclesiastical promotion and holy orders.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I.

<P><PB N="45" REF="021347_0043_0FB31C1D239F6A50"/>This institution is, by all ancient writers, regarded to be co-eval with the apostles, and derived from their example and practice; and there are several passages of sacred writ which are adduced in it's favor; particularly, the eighth chapter of the acts of the apostles; wherein mention is made of the laying on of hands, of two of them, upon those whom Philip, of the order of deacons, had baptized; the words are these.</P>
<P>"But when they (the Samaritans) believed Philip, preach∣ing the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women. Now when the apostles, which were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John; who, when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost. (For as yet He was fallen upon none of them: Only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then they <HI>laid their hands on them,</HI> and they received the Holy Ghost."</P>
<P>SAINT CYPRIAN, on this text, thus expressed himself.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saint Cyprian,</HI> so much distinguished for his humility, fortitude, zeal, charity, and other good qualities, was consti∣tuted bishop of Carthage, about 248, and suffered martyr∣dom in 258.

<P><PB N="46" REF="021347_0044_0FB31C1E98917590"/>SAINT AUGUSTIN also, was of the same sentiment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aug. de Trin. Lib. xv.

<P>"For," says he, "by the Holy Ghost which is given in the catholick church by the <HI>imposition of hands,</HI> our fore∣fathers would have us understand <HI>that</HI> which Saint Paul alludes to when he says, 'The love of God is shed abroad in <HI>our hearts</HI> by the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> which is given us.'<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 5.</NOTE> This is that charity which those have not who are cut off from the communion of the church; and though such 'should speak with the tongues of men and angels; and understand all mysteries; and all knowledge, it would profit them no∣thing;' for <HI>those</HI> have <HI>not</HI> the LOVE of GOD, who <HI>love not</HI> the UNITY of the CHURCH."</P>
<P>"The Holy Spirit," he adds "that is now given by the <HI>imposition of hands,</HI> does not appear by any sensible and mi∣raculous effects attending it, as was the case in the infant state of the church, and necessary to it's extension and support. Who now expects that those who receive the imposition of hands, should immediately speak with new tongues? The love of God, however, is supposed to be diffused into their hearts, invisibly and latently; so that they may truly say, 'That the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost that is given them.'<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aug. de Bap.

<P>On this subject he further says. "Hereby we know that God abides in us, by the spirit which he hath given us.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 John III. 24.</NOTE> If thou art sensible that thou hast in thy heart the love of God, thou hast this knowledge from the <HI>divine spirit.</HI> In the first age of the church the Holy Ghost fell on those who believed, and they spake tongues they had never learned, as the spirit

<P>Another evidence in support of confirmation, is deduced from Saint Paul's <HI>confirming</HI> those disciples he met with at Ephesus, who had received only the baptism of John.</P>
<P>"They were baptized," saith the sacred text, "in the name of the Lord Jesus; and when Paul <HI>laid his hands</HI> upon <HI>them,</HI> the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues and prophesied."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xix. 5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>These persons, who in "number were about twelve," were first <HI>instructed</HI> into the principles of christianity; they next made a <HI>public acknowledgment</HI> of their faith, by being <HI>baptized</HI> in the name of Christ; and, immediately thereafter, by imposition of the apostles hands, were <HI>confirmed</HI> in their christian profession, by the reception of the Holy Ghost, in it's visible and extraordinary gifts; accommodated to the ne∣cessity of those early days of christianity, and therefore, of them, it may, with great truth be affimed, in the language of Saint Paul to the <HI>Ephesians;</HI> "That <HI>after</HI> they <HI>believed,</HI> they were <HI>sealed</HI> with the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of promise."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>

<P>Saint Paul, in the sixth chapter of his epistle to the He∣brews, in the first and second verses, exhorts them to holi∣ness and steadfastness in the christian faith.</P>

<P>BISHOP TAYLOR, on this passage, observes, "that here are six fundamental points of Saint Paul's catechism, which he regarded as the foundation of the christian church; and among these, <HI>imposition of hands,</HI> (which the apostles used in <HI>confirming</HI> those who were baptized, and invocating the Holy Ghost upon them) is reckoned as a part of the foundation; and, therefore, those who acknowledge it not, may be said to dig up this foundation.—Where Saint Paul calls it the <HI>doctrine</HI> of the <HI>laying on of hands,</HI> it not only appears to be a lasting ministry, as no part of the christian doctrine can be changed nor abolished; but also, to be of <HI>di∣vine institution.</HI>—If it was not so, the apostle would have been guilty of that, for which our Saviour reproved the scribes and pharisees; 'The teaching for doctrines, the com∣mandments of men;' which, as we cannot suppose him chargeable with, we must, therefore, infer, that this doctrine of imposition of hands, or confirmation, is <HI>apostolical</HI> and <HI>divine.</HI>"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Bishop Taylor's discourse on Confirmation.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="021347_0047_0FB31C232783FB68"/>That celebrated reformer, JOHN CALVIN, on this text, delivered his sentiments in the following manner.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is worthy of notice, that several of the <HI>reformed churches</HI> which do not retain the rite of confirmation, make use of a ceremony, which, in a great degree, appears design∣ed to answer it's salutary intention, viz. <HI>That,</HI> which by them is stiled, THE OWNING OF THE COVENANT; which, it is conceived, is unnecessary here to explain.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Those, without the church, did not come to baptism before they had made confession of their faith, in these, there∣fore, catechism was wont to precede. But the children of the faithful, because adopted from the womb, and by right of promise belonging to the church, were baptized while infants; but their infancy being past, after they were instructed in the faith, they did also offer themselves to ca∣techism; and then another symbol was added, namely, <HI>im∣position</HI> of <HI>hands.</HI> This one place, therefore, doth <HI>abund∣antly testify,</HI> that the <HI>original</HI> of <HI>this ceremony</HI> proceeded from the APOSTLES; though afterwards it was turned in∣to superstition; as the world doth commonly degenerate from the best institutions, to corruptions. Let us therefore know," said he, "that it was instituted by the first authors to be a solemn rite of prayer, as Saint Augustin also calls it. They designed indeed, by this symbol, to approve the con∣fession of faith made by youth; but thought of nothing less than thereby to render void the sacrament of baptism.

<P>In his book of institutions,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv.

<P>One of these passages of sacred writ, is Acts ii. 4.

<P>"That which <HI>imposition of hands,</HI>" says he, "now gives to every one in confirming <HI>neophytes,</HI> (those regenerated) the same did the descent of the Holy Ghost then confer on all believers. But because we have said, that imposition of hands, in confirmation, confers something on him who is born a∣gain and regenerated in Christ, perhaps some one will be ready to say, 'What can the ministry of confirmation profit me, after the mystery of baptism?—If, after baptism, we want the addition of a new office, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e we not received all that was necessary at the font.'—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s not so, beloved. For, if you observe, in the military h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, when the emperor hath chosen one to be a soldier, he does not only affix a mark or character on him, but furnishes him with competent arms for fighting;—thus it is with a baptized person, the benedic∣tion is his armour. Thou hast made him a soldier; give him also the weapons of warfare. What doth it profit, though a father confers a great estate upon a child, if he doth not also provide him a tutor? The Holy Ghost is the keeper, and comforter, and tutor of those who are regenerated in Christ. If we shall ask, 'What advantage did the apostles receive by the coming of the Holy Ghost, after the passion and resur∣rection of Christ?' The Lord himself evidently shewed us, when he said, 'I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot hear them now. Howbeit, when he the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.' When the Holy Ghost is given, the heart of a believer is dilated and enlarged with prudence and constancy. Before the descent of the Holy Ghost, the apostles were terrified, even to the denial of Christ; but after his visitation, they were armed with a contempt of death, even to suffer martyrdom for his sake."

<P>It may not be amiss to mention here, a few other testimo∣nies from the <HI>ancients</HI> in support of confirmation, and also the sentiments of some foreign divines of reformed churches, who were not in communion with the church of England.</P>
<P>EUSEBIUS (in his Eccles. Hist. Lib. iii. book xx.) men∣tions, from SAINT CLEMENS, (who in 188 was made catechist in the school of Alexandria, and who was tutor to Origen) that SAINT JOHN, when he returned to Ephesus, from his banishment by Domitian, to the isle of Patmos, go∣ing into the adjacent country, to discharge the duties of his function, he was smitten with the goodly appearance of a young man, and commended him to the care of an Asian bishop, who paid great attention to the youth, and instructed him in the principles of christianity. Some time thereafter, however, the young man, by evil companions, suffered him∣self to become very dissolute, and even to be guilty of theft, and several enormous crimes. Saint John, returning to that country, sought out the youth; pathetickly addressed him; reclaiming him from vice, and <HI>confirmed</HI> him.</P>

<P>SAINT AMBROSE, who was bishop of Milan, and born about 333, upon Heb. vi. 2. where the apostle joins impo∣sition of hands with baptism, notes; "That it means the imposition of hands, which is supposed to confer the Holy Ghost, and that <HI>this rite</HI> was administered by bishops <HI>after baptism,</HI> for the confirmation of men in the unity of the church of Christ."</P>

<P>Without quoting any thing more from the ancients, on this subject, it may not be altogether superfluous to observe, that in 1691, Sir PETER KING, afterwards LORD CHAN∣CELLOR of England, published his celebrated book, entitled, "An Enquiry into the constitution, discipline, unity and worship of the primitive church, that flourished within the <HI>first</HI> 300 <HI>years</HI> after Christ, faithfully collected out of the extant writings of those ages, by an impartial hand."

<P>"We confess, with a <HI>faith</HI> taken out of the <HI>divine scrip∣tures,</HI> that, in the times of the apostles, this was observed.

<P>In their apology to the <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> in 1532, adverting to infants who have been baptized, they say: "That when they shall have come to years of discre∣tion, and understand the faith, and begin truly to love Christ, we bring them to the profession of those things, even what∣soever they have attained to by the help of their parents, or godfathers, or by the ministry of the church, that they may themselves, of their own accord, most freely own and profess all those things before the whole church, to their own sal∣vation, in the celebration of the <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>imposition of hands;</HI> which being done, they are <HI>confirmed.</HI> And there is forth∣with given them full power and right to <HI>communicate</HI> of the body and blood of Christ, with the faithful."

<P N="3">III. Then they are asked, whether they will <HI>renew</HI> the covenant they entered into with God at baptism?</P>
<P N="4">IV. This being consented to by them, the heads of the covenant are explained, according to the form prescribed by the apostle to Titus, Chap. ii. 11, 12, 13. "Denying un∣godliness and worldly lusts; to live righteously, soberly, and godly in this present world; looking for the blessed hope," &amp;c. And they are required openly, before the church, to renounce the world, the devil and the flesh, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">V. Next, a profession of faith is demanded of them, so that they all repeat aloud the apostles creed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Then, on their knees, saying after the minister, they pray unto God, to forgive the sins of their youth, and strengthen them by his holy spirit, unto all the good purpose of his will; which also the whole assembly doth, praying for them. After the prayers,</P>
<P N="7">VII. There is a declaration, to these young disciples, of their right to participate of the Lord's supper.</P>
<P>And, lastly, there is added the <HI>apostolical rite of imposition of hands,</HI> with the invocation of the name of God upon them, to strengthen, (or confirm) the hope of his heavenly grace."</P>
<P>The LEIDEN DIVINES, (in their synopsis pueroris the∣ologiae, Dis. xlvii.) observe, "That it is probable this doc∣trine of <HI>imposition of hands,</HI> is referred to that care of the <HI>ancient church,</HI> whereby children, instructed in catechetical doctrine, before they were admitted to partake of the Lord's supper, were presented to the church, to answer concerning the faith, and commended by prayer unto God, the <HI>rite of imposition of hands</HI> being added thereunto; which was a gesture of those who pray and bless, even from the time of the patriarchs."</P>
<P>CHEMNITIUS, a <HI>Lutheran</HI> clergyman of eminence, says; "Our divines have often shewed, that the <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>confirma∣tion</HI> (unprofitable, superstitious, and anti-scriptural traditions, being removed from it) might be piously used, and to the edi∣fication of the church, according to the <HI>consent</HI> of <HI>scripture,</HI> after this manner, viz. That those who have been baptized in their infancy, when come to years of discretion, should be diligently instructed in a certain and plain catechism, of the doctrine of the church; and when they seem competent∣ly to have understood the principles of it, should afterwards be presented to the bishop and church; and there the child that was baptized in infancy, should,</P>
<P N="1">I. Be admonished, in a short and plain manner, concern∣ing his baptism, viz. what, how, why, and into what, he was baptized: What the whole Trinity, in that baptism, conferred upon him, and sealed to him; namely, the cove∣nant of peace and grace; and how there was then made a renunciation of satan; a profession of faith, and promise of obedience.</P>
<P N="2">II. The child himself should stand before the church; make ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roper, and public confession of this doctrine and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith.</P>
<P N="3">III. He should be questioned about the chief heads of the christian religion, and where he hath not a proper know∣ledge of any doctrine, he should be more fully informed re∣specting it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. He should be put in mind, and declare by this pro∣fession, how he differs from all heathen, heretical, fanatic, and profane opinions.</P>
<P N="5">V There should be added, a grave and serious exhortation, out of the word of God; that he should persevere in good∣ness, and by going forward therein, be farther confirmed in the covenant of baptism, and in that doctrine and faith. And next.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Public prayer should be made for those children, that God, by his holy spirit, would vouchsafe to govern, preserve and confirm them, in this profession; Whereunto, without superstition, may be added <HI>imposition of hands.</HI> Nor would that prayer be vain; for it is warranted by the promises con∣cerning the gift of perseverance, and grace of confirmation."</P>
<P>"Such a <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>confirmation,</HI>" adds this author, "would very much profit youth, and the whole church; for it would be <HI>agreeable</HI> both to <HI>scripture</HI> and <HI>pure antiquity.</HI>" Exam. Concil. Trident. part II. de Confirm.</P>
<P>The ASSSEMBLY of DIVINES, held at WESTMINSTER in 1644, in their annotations on 2 Tim. i. 6. say; "That the <HI>laying on of hands,</HI> which is usually called <HI>confirmation,</HI> stood. I, In examining those who had been baptized; what progress they had made in the doctrine of christianity.

<P>Happy event! Shall we not hope to behold very salutary effects of this <HI>consecration</HI> of themselves to God?</P>
<P>Were they made <HI>partakers</HI> of the HOLY GHOST? May we not therefore, in their future conduct, expect to behold the blessed consequences of their reception of the SPIRIT of unity and peace; wisdom and purity; harmony and love?</P>

<P>When he "came and saw" the effects of "the grace of God," he <HI>"was glad;"</HI> transported with holy joy; and, with great fervor, "exhorted them all, that, <HI>with purpose of heart;</HI>" with the greatest sincerity; with invincible for∣titude, resolution and patience, notwithstanding the opposi∣tion they might meet with, "they would <HI>cleave unto the</HI> LORD;" with firmness, adhere to his doctrines; with pie∣ty, reverence his ordinances, and precepts; with diligence, endeavor to promote his glory, and, in all their actions, to approve themselves to his eye of omniscience!</P>
<P>We cannot doubt but these NEW DISCIPLES were <HI>obe∣dient</HI> to this exhortation of VIRTUE! That they discerned it's <HI>importance!</HI> That they were convinced their present and future happiness, depended on their "<HI>cleaving to the</HI> LORD, with <HI>full purpose of heart!</HI>"</P>
<P>That they also, reflected on the <HI>serious truths,</HI> that "GOD will <HI>not</HI> be <HI>mocked;</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 7.</NOTE> that RELIGION pertains to the HEART, which it is designed to <HI>reform,</HI> together with the <HI>whole life,</HI> and that INSTABILITY in the <HI>faith,</HI> as well as actions of vice, would be <HI>disgraceful</HI> to themselves, and <HI>reproachful</HI> to christianity!</P>
<P>How worthy of <HI>imitation</HI> is their EXAMPLE! As we have the <HI>same incentives</HI> to holiness, as had these converts at Antioch, let us indulge the hope, that we shall duly honor our christian profession!</P>
<P>What, indeed, shall tempt us to a <HI>different conduct?</HI> shall the infamy of vice; the pangs of guilt; the dread of future misery; the displeasure of our God? Or shall worldly riches; shadowy honors; momentary, unsatisfactory, sinful enjoy∣ments? Heaven forbid!</P>
<P>GOD, <HI>angels</HI> and <HI>men,</HI> will <HI>look</HI> for VIRTUE, for <HI>religi∣ous deportment,</HI> in those especially who have <HI>now</HI> been con∣secrated to him!</P>

<P>This do, in remembrance of me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE sacraments of christianity were ordained in com∣passion to the weakness of our nature; they are but few in number, <HI>baptism,</HI> and the <HI>Lord's supper;</HI> and, when duly regarded, are attended with very essential advantages.</P>
<P>At present permit us to pay a little attention to the last-mentioned of these ordinances now before us, which was instituted by our Saviour, but a short time before his passion.</P>
<P>In discoursing on this sacrament, we will,</P>
<P>FIRST, Explain it's nature.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Shew the obligations we are under to ob∣serve this institution.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Regard the qualifications requisite to our due reception of it.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, Notice some of the advantages which will attend a proper discharge of this service.</P>
<P>LASTLY, We will pay attention to some of those parti∣culars which prevent many from receiving this ordinance.</P>
<P>FIRST, we are to explain the nature of the sacrament of the Lord's supper.</P>
<P>Though some authors have greatly <HI>perplexed</HI> and <HI>embarrass∣ed</HI> this subject, we apprehend it is, in itself, <HI>extremely simple;</HI> and that it may be fully, and clearly explained in a few words.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="021347_0061_0FB31C429261D750"/>Properly to understand this christian rite, it will be neces∣sary to observe, that it was <HI>typified</HI> under the Jewish eco∣nomy.</P>
<P>The <HI>paschal supper</HI> was instituted to maintain in the minds of the Jews, a sense of the goodness of God in <HI>preserving</HI> them <HI>from death,</HI> when the destroying angel flew the First-born, in every dwelling of the Egyptians.—That the Jewish passover was ordained to <HI>effect this purpose,</HI> is very evident from the words of it's institution, which are contained in the twelfth chapter of the book of Exodus.</P>
<P>"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them; draw out and take unto you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the passover. And ye shall take a bunch of hysop, and dip it into the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel, and the two side-posts, with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians, and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come unto your houses to smite you. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee, and to thy sons, for ever. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promis∣ed, that ye shall keep this service. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you; what mean you by this service? That ye shall say, it is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he <HI>smote</HI> the Egyptians and <HI>deliver∣ed our houses.</HI>"</P>
<P>That this event was typical of a much greater deliverance that mankind should receive, even a <HI>deliverance from eternal death,</HI> by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ; and that the pas∣chal lamb was a figure of our Saviour, is manifest from di∣vers passages of sacred writ.</P>
<P>Was the paschal lamb ordered to be slain on the <HI>fourteenth day,</HI> of the first month, at even?—On the <HI>same day,</HI> at even, of that month, did our Saviour offer himself a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins; and, in allusion to the paschal lamb, he
<PB N="65" REF="021347_0062_0FB31C4417684B58"/>
was stiled, by John the baptist; "The <HI>Lamb of God,</HI> that tak∣eth away the sins of the world."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was there no deliverance from death, for any Israelite, who, on the night of the passover, should <HI>not continue</HI> in his dwelling, the lintel and two side-posts of which, were sprink∣led with the blood of the paschal lamb?—Neither are we de∣livered from everlasting death, unless we are <HI>under covert</HI> of the blood of Christ; by it, "have our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience;"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 22.</NOTE> for it is this blood only, we are assured, "that cleanseth us from sin."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was the paschal lamb slain <HI>before</HI> the Mosaick law and sacrifices were enjoined on the people of Israel?—This was expressive of the truth, that mankind could not be redeemed by an observance of the law and the Mosaick rites, but by virtue only of the <HI>true passover,</HI> "the lamb of God, slain, (in the divine purpose,) from the foundation of the world."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is worthy of observation, that our Saviour constantly celebrated the Jewish passover at Jerusalem, (and when only twelve years old, we are informed, he repaired to that city for this purpose<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 42.</NOTE> until he abolished this rite, by instituting another ordinance in it's place.</P>
<P>Just before his death, he said to his apostles; "With de∣sire I have desired to eat this passover with you, before I suf∣fer. For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until IT be <HI>fulfilled</HI> in the <HI>kingdom</HI> of GOD;"—or, as we conceive, the sense is: 'I will no more partake of this or∣dinance; <HI>that</HI> which IT <HI>typified,</HI> will soon be <HI>accomplished</HI> in the <HI>spiritual kingdom</HI> I have established; and, after my resurrection, I will, <HI>in spirit,</HI> be <HI>present</HI> with such worthy members of my church, as shall assemble to commemorate my passion, and rejoice, with them, in the happy fruits and effects of my sufferings.'</P>
<P>That Saint Paul apprehended the paschal lamb, was an <HI>emblem</HI> of the sacrifice of Christ, is very evident from the en∣suing exhortation to the church at Corinth. "CHRIST our <HI>passover</HI> is <HI>sacrificed for us;</HI> therefore, let us keep the
<PB N="66" REF="021347_0063_0FB31C4718B4F380"/>
feast; not with old leaven; neither with the leaven of ma∣lice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of since∣rity and truth."</P>
<P>As the <HI>principal intention</HI> of the Jewish passover, was, as hath been noticed, to occasion the Israelites, ever to be <HI>grate∣ful</HI> to God for that signal instance of his goodness, in pre∣serving them from <HI>death,</HI> when the first born of the Egyp∣tians were slain;—so the <HI>primary intention</HI> of the christian passover, or of the sacrament of the Lord's supper, is, to pre∣serve in our minds a <HI>lively sense</HI> of <HI>gratitude</HI> for the sufferings of our Saviour, to deliver us from <HI>death eternal.</HI></P>
<P>"This do, in <HI>remembrance</HI> of <HI>me.</HI>"</P>
<P>As if our Lord should have said, 'this bread, by me brok∣en, and given to you, represents my body, which I shall now give to be broken on the Cross for your redemption; often thus break bread, and partake of it, that you may not be <HI>un∣mindful</HI> of my sufferings; but always <HI>retain sentiments</HI> of gra∣titude for that testimony I shall give you of my affection;— the purchase of your salvation, at the expence of my death and passion.'</P>
<P>Such, we presume, is the <HI>nature</HI> of this sacrament. We proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to consider the <HI>obligations</HI> we are under to <HI>regard it.</HI></P>
<P>As the Jewish passover was a type of this ordinance; the former, the shadow, of which the latter, is the substance, we may rationally conclude, from <HI>this consideration,</HI> that this sa∣crament is <HI>most forcibly</HI> enjoined on us by divine authority; as the people of Israel were positively commanded to observe the passover; and, indeed, upon their non-observance of it, without a just reason, they were to be <HI>put to death.</HI> "The man," it is written, "that is clean; and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be <HI>cut off</HI> from his people."</P>
<P>The <HI>authority</HI> of our LORD to <HI>institute sacraments</HI> is <HI>un∣questionable;</HI> for "all power was given to him in Heaven and in earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 18.</NOTE> And can any command be <HI>more explicit,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="021347_0064_0FB31C48DE22C478"/>
than <HI>that</HI> which enjoins on us this sacrament? "THIS DO, in remembrance of me."</P>
<P>This service, it may be remarked, is farther enjoined on us, not only by the <HI>example</HI> of the <HI>primitive church,</HI> but also, by the words of Saint Paul.</P>
<P>"For I have received of the Lord," said he, to the Corin∣thians, "<HI>that</HI> which I also <HI>delivered unto you;</HI> that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said; Take eat; this is my Body which is broken for you; <HI>this do</HI> in remembrance of me. After the same manner he took the cup, when he had supped, saying; This cup is the New-Testament in my blood; <HI>this do,</HI> as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death until he comes."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 23 to 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>To prevent our unworthy reception of this sacrament, we are entreated previously to <HI>examine</HI> whether we have that preparation which it requires. "But let a man <HI>examine himself,</HI> and <HI>so let him eat</HI> of that bread, and drink of that cup."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ver. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>These, and other expressions of Saint Paul, clearly enforce on us this duty. And as it is also enjoined on us by the <HI>law</HI> of <HI>gratitude,</HI> it may most justly be affirmed, that there is not any precept of sacred writ <HI>more explicitly,</HI> nor <HI>more forcibly,</HI> enjoined on us, than is the <HI>injunction,</HI> in the text, that requires us to be partakers of this holy sacrament.</P>
<P>As this fact cannot, consistent with our religious princi∣ples, be questioned by any of us, we shall now,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, attend to the <HI>qualifications</HI> requisite to our <HI>due observance</HI> of this ordinance.</P>
<P>We perceive, from what hath been said, that the <HI>princi∣pal intention</HI> of this sacrament, is to <HI>preserve</HI> in <HI>our minds</HI> a <HI>sense of gratitude</HI> for the <HI>love of</HI> CHRIST in effecting our salvation, by virtue of his death.</P>
<P>But is it possible our hearts can be <HI>duly impressed</HI> with a
<PB N="68" REF="021347_0065_0FB31C4ACE8339A8"/>
sense of thankfulness to Christ, while we are in a <HI>state</HI> of <HI>im∣penitence;</HI> not entitled to the blessings of the gospel, and re∣gardless of it's sacred precepts?</P>
<P>Impossible is it for the person who is a stranger to repen∣tance; destitute of faith in Christ, and inattentive to the di∣vine commands, to be an heir of salvation; to be <HI>truly thank∣ful</HI> for the mercies of Christ; or to render him an acceptable service.</P>
<P>But when we are christians indeed, though our graces may be defective; our religious attainments imperfect, we <HI>are qualified</HI> to approach this ordinance; we have that pre∣paration, which, in the judgment of our church, is requisite to our being <HI>worthy partakers</HI> of this sacrament; for then we "truly repent of our former sins; steadfastly purpose to lead a new life; have a lively faith in God's mercy, through Christ; a thankful remembrance of his death, and are in charity with all men."</P>
<P>A moment's reflection would be sufficient to convince us, that it would be, most absurd and criminal, for a professed INFIDEL to receive this sacrament. But the person who <HI>professes</HI> to <HI>believe</HI> in the christian faith, but <HI>demes it</HI> in <HI>prac∣tice,</HI> is, perhaps, more guilty than such a character; and as sinful, at least, would it be, for an impious christian to par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake of this holy ordinance, as for one who does not pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess to believe in divine revelation.</P>
<P>The person, therefore, of impenitence; of practical in∣fidelity; of impurity of heart and life; destitute of righte∣ousness, must be <HI>unprepared</HI> to celebrate the passion of our Lord.</P>
<P>We hasten to the <HI>fourth</HI> proposition, which was to notice some of the <HI>advantages</HI> which <HI>attend</HI> the <HI>worthy reception</HI> of this sacrament.</P>
<P>It may be said that it is beneficial to us, in several re∣spects.</P>
<P>It will occasion our observance of the divine precepts to be <HI>more perfect,</HI> and <HI>acceptable</HI> to the Almighty.</P>
<P>No obedience can be pleasing to God, that <HI>proceeds not</HI> from LOVE. The obedience of SERVILITY and FEAR,

cannot be acceptable to the Deity; who requires the free-will offering of the heart.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 26.</NOTE> And impossible is it, that we should love God, unless we shall be convinced of the excel∣lence of his nature; or be sensible of his love to us. As, in this sacrament, we commemorate the sufferings of Christ, we have the highest testimony of the Almighty's affection for us, in giving the son of his love to be a propitiatory sa∣crifice for our sins; our hearts, therefore, we may reasona∣bly hope, will be impressed with a sense of love to the God of beneficence. And thus, while we are rendering to God a <HI>most rational tribute</HI> of <HI>gratitude,</HI> we are <HI>excited</HI> and <HI>enabled,</HI> with <HI>greater perfection,</HI> and <HI>more acceptably,</HI> to <HI>honor</HI> his <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>When we duly commemorate the passion of our Lord, and have a lively sense of the <HI>ignominy</HI> of his death; of his excruciating pangs, both of body and soul, which he endur∣ed to atone for our guilt, can we be <HI>insensible</HI> of the <HI>demerits</HI> of <HI>sin;</HI> of the punishment due to the violation of the divine law? And, consequently, must not our hatred against sin be increased; our resolutions of virtue be strengthened?</P>
<P>When, in this ordinance, we receive the symbols of our Saviour's passion, while our <HI>faith thereby</HI> shall be increased, will not our <HI>hearts</HI> be <HI>expanded</HI> with CHARITY to <HI>all men,</HI> even to our <HI>enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Is it possible to have proper conceptions of the love of Christ, manifested in his death, to all men; to the most guilty and unworthy; to his greatest enemies, even his mur∣therers, and not feel compassion for our greatest foes; not be desirous of advancing the felicity of all mankind?</P>
<P>Among other benefits, we might enumerate, which will be derived to us, by our worthy reception of this sacrament, we shall only mention, that thereby we shall obtain <HI>absoluti∣on</HI> for our <HI>sins;</HI> and also, have our <HI>hearts replenished</HI> with <HI>grace;</HI> or, in the language of our communion office, we shall "spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood;

dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; be one with Christ, and Christ with us;" and also, have our <HI>affection</HI> for <HI>each other,</HI> as members of a religious community, greatly augmented and established.</P>
<P>The primitive christians were justly distinguished, for their love and benevolence "to all men; but especially to those of the household of faith."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 10.</NOTE> And it cannot reasonably be doubted, but their <HI>ardent affection</HI> for <HI>each other;</HI> their <HI>unity,</HI> and <HI>distinguished piety,</HI> were, in a great degree, owing to that attention which they paid to this sacred institution.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The primitive christians used to partake of this holy sacrament <HI>daily,</HI> or as often as they assembled for public worship, and this practice continued a <HI>considerable time</HI> in the church.</P>
<P>"We receive," says <HI>Saint Cyprian,</HI> "the Eucharist <HI>every day,</HI> as the food that nourishes us to salvation."</P>
<P><HI>Saint Ambrose</HI> mentions that <HI>this custom</HI> prevailed in the Diocess of Milan.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Jerome</HI> informs us, that <HI>this practice</HI> obtained also in the church of Rome.</P>
<P>And <HI>Saint Augustin</HI> intimates, that it was <HI>not uncommon</HI> in his time.</P>
<P>In the churches of the <HI>east,</HI> this custom began first to de∣cline. Saint <HI>Basil</HI> tells us, that, in his days, they communi∣cated <HI>four times a week;</HI> on the Lord's day, Wednesday, Fri∣day and Saturday, and also upon other days, if the memory or festival of any martyr fell upon them.</P>
<P>Afterwards, as the power of religion began more sensibly to <HI>decay,</HI> this sacrament was received by the church <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice</HI> only a <HI>week;</HI> in some time thereafter, but <HI>once</HI> a <HI>month,</HI> and, in process of time, in most churches, but <HI>three times in a year,</HI> viz. at Christmas, Easter and Witsuntide. See <HI>Cave's</HI> Primitive Christianity, Chap. XI. Page 339, 340.</P>
<P>Originally, ALL the members of the church <HI>communicat∣ed;</HI> but as christians increased in number, a more <HI>exact dis∣cipline,</HI> in this respect, became necessary. None were ad∣mitted to this ordinance until they had arrived to the degree of the <HI>faithful;</HI> for <HI>catechumens,</HI> and such as for some crime, were under the <HI>censure</HI> and <HI>suspension</HI> of the church, and had not passed through the several stages of <HI>penitents,</HI> were not allowed to communicate, but commanded to <HI>depart</HI> from the church when this sacrament was administered. Ibid. P. 333.</P>
<P>All those, however, who were baptized, and against whose conduct no exception was made, were not only <HI>permitted,</HI> but, by the rules of the church, <HI>obliged</HI> to communicate, un∣der pain of ecclesiastical censure.</P>
<P>The most ancient canons are very express to this purpose. Among those stiled the <HI>apostolical canons,</HI> there is one in the following words. "All such of the faithful as come to church, and hear the scriptures read, but <HI>stay not</HI> to the prayers, <HI>nor partake</HI> of the <HI>holy communion,</HI> ought to be <HI>sus∣pended</HI> as authors of <HI>disorder</HI> in the church."</P>
<P>Which canon the <HI>council</HI> of <HI>Antioch</HI> repeats with a little enlargement. "All such as come into the church of God, and hear the holy scriptures read, but <HI>do not communicate</HI> with the people in prayer, and <HI>refuse</HI> to <HI>partake</HI> of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> which is a <HI>disorderly practice,</HI> ought to be <HI>cast out</HI> of the <HI>church,</HI> 'till they confess their fault, and bring forth fruit of repentance; when they do so, if they ask pardon, they may obtain it." See Bingham's Antiquities of the christian church, Vol. I. Book XV. Chap. IV. Fol. 769.</P>
<P>In the first ages of christianity, not only <HI>catechumens</HI> and those <HI>under penance,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> the <HI>other</HI> members of the church, except communicants, were required to <HI>withdraw</HI> when this holy sacrament was dispensed.</P>
<P>But in the days of <HI>Saint Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sostom,</HI> there were some who requested the privilege to be <HI>present</HI> during the performance of the whole office of the communion, without being <HI>obliged</HI> to <HI>communicate.</HI> They were not willing to be accounted <HI>penitents,</HI> and to be <HI>shut out</HI> of the church with them; nor yet, would they be <HI>communicants.</HI> Against <HI>such</HI> persons, this <HI>eloquent father</HI> inveighs with a considerable degree of ani∣mation.</P>
<P>"Are you <HI>unworthy,</HI>" said he to them, "of the sacrifice, and unfit to partake of it? Neither then are you <HI>worthy</HI> of the <HI>prayers.</HI>"</P>
<P>Do you not hear the church's herald proclaiming, "All ye who are <HI>penitents withdraw!</HI>" All those who do not cum∣municate, are penitents. If thou art of the number of peni∣tents, thou mayest not partake. For he who is not a par∣taker, is a penitent.</P>
<P>Why does he say; "All ye who cannot pray, depart?" And why do you impudently stay?</P>
<P>I am not one of those, will you say, but of such as may partake. Consider, I pray you, and seriously weigh the matter. The royal table is prepared; angels give their at∣tendance; the Lord himself is present, and do you stand yawning as an idle spectator only?</P>
<P>Your <HI>garments</HI> are <HI>defiled,</HI> and are you under <HI>no concern?</HI> But will you say, they are clean. Then sit down and par∣take!</P>
<P>The king comes daily to see the guests, and discourses with them all. And now he says in your consciences; friends, how came you to stand here, not having on a wed∣ding garment? He said not, why art thou set down? But before he was set down, he pronounced him unworthy. For he said not, Why art thou <HI>set down?</HI> But, <HI>Why camest thou in hither?</HI> The same now he says to every one who standeth here with an impudent boldness. For every one who doth not partake, is shameless and impudent.</P>
<P>Those who are in sin, are for that, first cast out. As none of those who are not initiated into the church by bap∣tism, should be present; so neither should any who are initi∣ated, if they are defiled.</P>
<P>Tell me, if any one who is invited to a feast, washes his hands, and sits down, and is prepared for the table, and yet <HI>eats not,</HI> does he not <HI>affront</HI> the person who invited him? Were it not better that such an one should not be present?</P>
<P>In like manner, thou art present; thou hast sung the hymn, and made profession with the rest, that thou art of those who are worthy, inasmuch as thou didst not depart with the un∣worthy. How is it that thou remainest, and yet dost not partake at the table? Art thou unworthy? Thou art then unworthy also of the communion of prayers." Chrys. Hom. III. in Ephes. Page 1051.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="021347_0068_0FB31C50D40FDD40"/>But however <HI>numerous</HI> and <HI>great</HI> are the advantages which we receive, when in a proper manner, we are partakers of this holy ordinance, it is painful to reflect, that, by <HI>great numbers</HI> of the professors of christianity, it is <HI>disregarded.</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="021347_0069_0FB31C5431D08870"/>
And as there are many who seem disposed to <HI>observe</HI> this duty; but suffer themselves, to be diverted from it, through various impediments, we shall, therefore, as we proposed,</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="021347_0070_0FB31C5569B70BF0"/>LASTLY, Notice some of those <HI>obstacles</HI> which occasion numbers to <HI>omit this service.</HI></P>
<P>Some there are, who decline to communicate, by reason there is an <HI>interruption</HI> of that <HI>affection</HI> and harmony which subsisted between them, and their neighbour; and, in justification of their conduct, they adduce the following re∣quisition of our Saviour.</P>
<P>"If thou bringest thy gift to the altar and there remem∣berest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."</P>
<P>These words suppose, that the person here alluded to, who "brings his gift to the altar," <HI>is</HI> the <HI>aggressor;</HI> HE "there remembereth, that his brother hath <HI>ought against</HI> HIM." When this is the case, that the offending party may offer an acceptable service to God, it is necessary he should make all reasonable satisfaction, in his power, for the injury done to his neighbour. This is ALL that is required in this case. And though the party offended should <HI>refuse</HI> to be reconciled to him, he may, notwithstanding, "come and offer his gift."</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="021347_0071_0FB31C586D6BCEC0"/>But if those who make this objection, are <HI>not</HI> the <HI>aggres∣sors;</HI> but have been injured, they have only to <HI>forgive</HI> the injury, and then, agreeable to the dictates of reason and re∣ligion, they are at <HI>liberty</HI> to attend on this ordinance.</P>
<P>There are others, who absent themselves from the Lord's table, because they apprehend it is approached by some per∣sons of <HI>immoral character.</HI></P>
<P>It may, indeed, some times, be thus. There may be those, who, as <HI>Saint Augustin</HI> observes, "press the sacred elements with their teeth, when they do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrace Christ with their hearts."</P>
<P>We should not, however, he <HI>hasty</HI> to <HI>censure</HI> our chris∣tian brother; but rather be inclined, with an holy severity, to judge ourselves.</P>
<P>It must, notwithstanding, be the <HI>duty</HI> of the governors of every church, upon <HI>proper information,</HI> to examine into the charge of immoral conduct against communicants; and, if convinced of their impiety, to suspend them the privilege of the communion, until they shall offer sufficient testimony of their reformation.</P>
<P>Imperfect, indeed, must be the discipline of that church, which <HI>knowingly</HI> admits unworthy characters to partake of this holy sacrament!</P>
<P>But it is most true, that such persons, pollute the ordi∣nance only to themselves; for, in the language of an apostle, "to the pure, all thing are pure."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 15.</NOTE> We cannot suppose, that our Lord would have suffered Judas to have received this sacrament, had his presence polluted it to any but himself.</P>
<P>There are others, who, <HI>through</HI> FEAR, are prevented from commemorating the death of Christ. They imagine they are <HI>unworthy</HI> to approach the Lord's table; and that should they "eat and drink unworthily, they would eat and drink <HI>damnation</HI> to themselves."</P>
<P>Such, are persons of vice, or virtue. If they are devoid of that religion the gospel requires, "wherefore do they not repent, and amend? Why will they render that as <HI>an excuse</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="021347_0072_0FB31C5AC146E780"/>
for not performing this duty, which reflects so much <HI>disgrace</HI> on themselves; and, from which through divine aid, they can obtain deliverance?</P>
<P>Or why will they incline to <HI>continue</HI> in that state, which occasions them to be unprepared for death; unfit indeed to offer the Almighty any act of devotion, either of prayer, or praise? For "the sacrifice of the <HI>wicked</HI> is an abomination to the Lord."</P>
<P>If those who apprehend they are unworthy to commune, are possessed of penitence for sin; faith in Christ; hearts of sincerity, and purity, and unfeigned desires and resolutions, to obey the divine commands, to the utmost of their ability, they will be acceptable guests at this holy banquet; for we are assured, that "God accepteth according to what a man <HI>hath;</HI> and not according to that which he <HI>hath not.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such persons, therefore, <HI>should not</HI> be <HI>intimidated</HI> from discharging their duty, in this instance. Practice, in all pro∣bability, will render them <HI>more perfect</HI> in the performance of it; and, if in virtue, they have not arrived to the greatest degree of perfection, the consideration, that the observance of <HI>this duty</HI> will have a tendency to <HI>promote</HI> their <HI>growth</HI> in GRACE, and <HI>establish</HI> them in GOODNESS, should be a <HI>forcible incentive</HI> to <HI>engage</HI> them in the <HI>practice</HI> of this <HI>rea∣sonable</HI> and advantageous service.</P>
<P>Those who receive this sacrament, while in a state of im∣penitence; or to accomplish sinister views; or through the prevalence of custom; or with dissimulation, or irreverance, unquestionably, receive it in an <HI>unworthy manner,</HI> and with∣out any benefit to themselves. And though the <HI>sin</HI> of <HI>such</HI> is <HI>great,</HI> it is NOT <HI>unpardonable.</HI></P>
<P>Some members of the church of Corinth, even while in a <HI>state</HI> of <HI>intoxication,</HI> partook of this ordinance. This oc∣casioned them "not to <HI>discern</HI> the Lord's body." And such conduct, this gross profanation of this institution, was so offensive to God, that he inflicted on them temporal judg∣ments, that they might not again be chargeable with such impiety.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="021347_0073_0FB31C5CA8A82848"/>"He that eateth and drinketh unworthily," said St. Paul, "eateth and drinketh damnation to himself;" or provokes God to inflict some judgment upon him, that he may be re∣claimed from this sin; for the word rendered <HI>damnation,</HI> in the original, signifies <HI>judgment.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The word, in this passage of sacred writ, that is trans∣lated <HI>damnation,</HI> is <HI>krima,</HI> which imports <HI>temporal judgment.</HI> The <HI>same word</HI> is used by Saint Peter, 1 Ep. iv. 17. "The time is come that <HI>judgment</HI> must begin at the house of God."</NOTE></P>
<P>"For this cause," added our apostle, "many are weakly and sickly among you, and many sleep," or are dead. "If we would judge ourselves we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world."</P>
<P>We shall mention but one particular more, which, we fear, prevents some from attending on this holy ordinance; though there are not any, perhaps, so candid as to acknow∣ledge it; and this is an apprehension, that if, they shall par∣take of this sacrament, they will be <HI>obliged</HI> to be <HI>more cir∣cumspect</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> in their <HI>deportment;</HI> and that the same evil action would be more criminal in them, should they become communicants, than it is while they do not receive this sacra∣ment.</P>
<P>Such conduct must evince great <HI>depravity</HI> of heart, as well as <HI>ignorance</HI> of the nature of christianity.</P>
<P>What <HI>new</HI> obligation of virtue is enjoined upon us when we <HI>receive</HI> this sacrament?</P>
<P>When we submit to the ordinance of baptism, are we not obligated to perform <HI>each duty</HI> of our religion, to the utmost of our ability?</P>
<P>We hope however, for the honor of christianity, there are but <HI>few,</HI> who, from this <HI>mistaken idea,</HI> decline the re∣ception of this sacrament.</P>
<P>To conclude. Let such as <HI>are communicants,</HI> approach this holy ordinance with reverence; with hearts of humility, faith, sincerity, charity, purity and gratitude!</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="021347_0074_0FB31C5D98BA3340"/>That they may be duly thankful for the love of Christ, which they will recognise, let them reflect on the <HI>dignity</HI> of his character; upon "the length and breadth, depth and height" of his sufferings; and upon the <HI>happy effects</HI> of his passion; that it will not only deliver them from everlasting and inexpressible infamy and woe, but exalt them to never ending and inconceivable honor, glory and happiness!</P>
<P>And let such humbly assure themselves, that the divine Saviour will graciously condescend to meet them at his table; to indulge them with his smiles; to replenish their hearts with grace; to favour them with his blessing!</P>
<P>Let the <HI>sincere christian,</HI> who, through <HI>groundless scruples</HI> and <HI>fears,</HI> hath been <HI>prevented</HI> from <HI>receiving</HI> this <HI>sacrament,</HI> rise superior to all opposition in the performance of this duty!</P>
<P>From an ardent desire to render obedience to the will of Heaven; from an humble reliance on the divine goodness to pity his infirmities, and from a desire to make advance∣ment in the christian life, let him resolve, in as perfect a manner as possible, to commemorate the love of the merciful Saviour!</P>
<P>Let <HI>those</HI> who have been <HI>inattentive</HI> to this <HI>sacred insti∣tution,</HI> who have not perhaps, bestowed on it <HI>one serious thought,</HI> be intreated, without delay, to take it into their se∣rious consideration!</P>
<P>That this sacrament might be enforced on us in the most solemn manner, our Saviour, as it should seem, enjoined it upon us in his <HI>last moments,</HI> almost with his latest breath! It is equally obligatory on <HI>all</HI> the members of his church; and we have not the least intimation, that any apology will be admitted for a disregard of this ordinance!</P>
<P>And let such persons be prevailed on to enter into the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>christianity;</HI> to pay attention to each part of their duty, that they may enjoy the pleasures arising from a good conscience; participate of the sublime enjoyments of religion here, and of it's inexpressible rewards hereafter!</P>
<P>That <HI>such</HI> may be their <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>happiness,</HI> will God Almighty of his infinite mercy, be graciously pleased to grant;
<PB N="78" REF="021347_0075_0FB31C5F2B0E08A0"/>
for the sake of the merits of the divine compassionate Jesus; to whom with the Father, and divine Spirit, be ascribed all honor and glory, adoration and praise, now, henceforth, and for ever!</P>
