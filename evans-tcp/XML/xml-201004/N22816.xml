<HEAD>THE CAUSE OF MAN.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN nature has been a theme of much dis∣cussion. Among the ancients, some railed at man, and some ridiculed his imperfections. Certain modern philosophers make depravity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Critics may remember, that <HI>depravity,</HI> through the whole of this piece, signifies such a disposition of heart as wishes universal diffusion of wretchedness.</NOTE> a part of their creed; and assign the most elevated seat in Paradise to those, who feel the most perfect contempt for human nature. The catechisms of these sages inform us, that man is malevolent; that his passions hurry him into wretchedness; and that his understanding is only another name for imperfection. Should individuals offer this for a description of their own minds, per∣haps justice might read the character with silent ap∣probation. When 'tis produced as the picture of man, the same justice commands to wipe the aspersion from the portrait of our common nature.</P>
<P>If exalted actions flow from elevated sentiments, then, to establish human dignity, and reason man into approbation of himself, must be among the first ad∣vancements towards virtue.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, our task, to plead the cause of man.</P>
<P>Let us examine his disposition; consider the utility of his passions; survey the perfection of his under∣standing, and observe how far surrounding creation stands as monumental testimony of human greatness.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030139_0003_0FE4A6DC694BAF90"/>From the situation of man, we may argue the ne∣cessity of benevolence in his disposition. He was, doubtless, formed for happiness. His desire of bliss, and his powers of fruition, evince the truth of this assertion. His felicity depends, almost entirely, on social intercourse. Solitary, man is in want, in fear, in disconsolation. A reciprocation of beneficence alone can make him happy. This he must be disposed to perform, or he cannot fulfil the final cause of his nature. Man's destination for happiness, and his mu∣tual dependence, therefore, clearly originate the ne∣cessity of human benevolence.</P>
<P>Feeling and experience evince the benevolent dis∣position of man. A sight of distress wounds the heart. A view of joy warms the soul with gladness. We are pleased to remove pain. We rejoice to communicate delight. These things we could not perform without a disposition to diffuse felicity. This disposition is all we mean by benevolence.</P>
<P>Suppose the heart of man malevolent, he must then lose every social satisfaction. For who could receive those mutual favours, which none were disposed to bestow? Man must be condemned to solitary misery. Never would he wipe a tear from the eye of sorrow; never would he pour the balm of consolation into the bosom of grief. Nay, he would grieve at the ap∣pearance of joy. He would eagerly disseminate wretchedness. Every benefaction of Providence would swell the tide of human misery; and man could never smile undisturbed, while one joyous emotion existed, even in the bosom of Deity. Must we be∣lieve man endowed with such a disposition? Yes, if we believe him malevolent. But can our rea∣son, our feelings, our experience, subscribe to such a creed? No. For necessity and sympathy both evince man benevolent. Nor could he be otherwise, unless his soul were blacker than the dunnest fiend that fear-distempered fancy ever generated in the dark regions of mythology.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030139_0004_0FE4A6CFF60B0D70"/>Though man stands vindicated from the charge of malevolence, yet has calumny blackened his character with other accusations.</P>
<P>Human passions have often been a mark for the ar∣row of contumely. Austerity condemns them, because they are sometimes irregular. As well might the same austerity curse the elements of nature, because the thunder, the earthquake, or the hurricane, sometimes rend an oak, split a mountain, or sweep a kingdom into the ocean.</P>
<P>If we impartially look on our own nature, the utility of our passions must appear.</P>
<P>Man is, at times, in danger. Danger originates the necessity of caution, and caution is secured by the passion of fear.</P>
<P>Unresisting innocence invites the hand of oppression. To prevent a repetition of injury, omniscient Deity planted the seed of anger in the bosom of man.</P>
<P>Self love, to some the most odious of all the passions, is still an emanation of benevolence. Like that, it has for its object the diffusion of felicity. It first se∣cures our own enjoyment. It then offers our bosom to a parent, to a friend, to our country, to the indiscri∣minate citizens of the world. Thus on self love are grafted philanthropy, patriotism, friendship, and all the tender growths of domestic charity.</P>
<P>A love of glory is the most violent, extensive and durable, of all the passions. For glory, men encoun∣ter toil, danger, and death itself. No pain, no labour, no toilsome virtue, no arduous heroism, can be a price too dear to purchase immortal renown. A passion which thus disposes men to sacrifice ease, safety, and life itself, to gain the applause of their fellow men, must inviolably unite mankind, and lodge in every breast a pledge for the social exertions of each indi∣vidual.</P>
<P>Let the votaries of apathy decry the passions. What can be the felicity, what the virtue, of their passionless philosopher? If man were void of self love, would
<PB N="6" REF="030139_0005_0FE4A6E26FE9CEE0"/>
the voice of native want rouze him from the sleep of indolence? What would shield his bosom from dan∣ger, what would arm his hand with power, if fear did not teach him caution, and anger learn him to resist the aggressions of violence? Who would toil for man? who, with a smile, would bleed on the altar of eman∣cipation, if the God of nature had not with love of glory warmed the bosom of man? Destitute of pas∣sions, man had stood, like the marble statue, without a motion; and eternally worn the same smile or frown which the last touch of nature's hand left impressed on his countenance.</P>
<P>Understanding claims our next attention. This forms a splendid part of human nature. By this man perceives, remembers, reasons and imagines. Per∣ception and memory principally subserve the opera∣tions of reason and imagination.</P>
<P>Guided by reason, man has travelled through the abstruse regions of the philosophic world. He has originated rules by which he can direct the ship through the pathless ocean, and measure the comet's flight over the fields of unlimited space. He has established so∣ciety and government. He can aggregate the profu∣sions of every climate, and every season. He can me∣liorate the severity, and remedy the imperfections, of nature herself. All these things he can perform by the assistance of reason.</P>
<P>By imagination, man seems to verge towards crea∣tive power. Aided by this, he can perform all the wonders of sculpture and painting. He can almost make the marble speak. He can almost make the brook murmur down the painted landscape. Often, on the pinions of imagination, he soars aloft where the eye has never travelled; where other stars glitter on the mantle of night, and a more effulgent sun lights up the blushes of morning. Flying from world to world, he gazes on all the glories of creation: or, lighting on the distant margin of the universe, darts the eye of fancy over the mighty void, where power
<PB N="7" REF="030139_0006_0FE4A6CCE164CC30"/>
creative never yet has energized, where existence still sleeps in the wide abyss of possibility. By imagination he can travel back to the source of time; converse with the successive generations of men, and kindle into emulation while he surveys the monumental tro∣phies of ancient art and glory. He can sail down the stream of time until he loses <Q>sight of stars and sun, by wandering into those retired parts of eternity, when the heavens and the earth shall be no more.*</Q></P>
<P>To these unequivocal characteristics of greatness in man, let us adduce the testimony of nature herself. Surrounding creation subserves the wants and pro∣claims the dignity of man. For him day and night visit the world. For him the seasons walk their splen∣did round. For him the earth teems with riches, and the heavens smile with beneficence.</P>
<P>All creation is accurately adjusted to his capacity for bliss. He tastes the dainties of festivity, breathes the perfumes of morning, revels on the charms of melody, and regales his eye with all the painted beau∣ties of vision. Whatever can please, whatever can charm, whatever can expand the soul with extacy of bliss, allures and solicits his attention. All things beautiful, all things grand, all things sublime, appear in native loveliness, and proffer man the richest plea∣sures of fruition.</P>
<P>Can he then raise his feelings too high in the scale of self approbation? Can he sufficiently abhor that con∣tumely which perpetually babbles of human depravity? In man, is it not calumny against heaven? Is it not pointing the arrow of ingratitude against the munifi∣cent bosom of a God?</P>
<P>If man can rejoice in diffusion of felicity, is he not, like his Creator, benevolent? If his passions urge him to embrace the common interest of man, are they not useful? If his understanding guides him down the ca∣reer of existence, is it not perfect? If surrounding creation waits on his wants, does it not, in the lan∣guage
<PB N="8" REF="030139_0007_0FE4A6D866F42EE8"/>
of its Creator, talk aloud of human greatness? Do not all these shining tints brighten on the portrait of man? Yes. He rejoices in munificence; he toils for universal felicity; he developes the mysteries of nature; he aggregates the goods of space, of dura∣tion, and even arrests the attention of earth and heaven.</P>
<P>This thought elevates man high on the theatre of existence, and places him full in view of a surround∣ing universe. It gives him an important part in the great drama of being. It tells him all intelligence are interested in the success of his performance.</P>
<P>Yes, my countrymen, you arrest the attention of shining millions. On you are fixed the eyes of all that bright throng of departed patriots, philosophers and philanthropists, who measured their atchievements by the dignity of their nature; and whose beatified spirits, now leaning from the azure battlements of heaven, allure their followers up the shining road to glory. You they hail as their genuine descendents; as the patrons of science; as the votaries of virtue; as the candidates of immortal beatitude.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> To the <HI>CORPORATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE rites of this anniversary first call our attention to the Honourable Corporation. You, Gentle∣men, are the founders and guardians of that seminary to which we owe our education. You majestic edi∣fice you raised and hallowed to the genius of science. This commands our thanks.</P>
<P>Our fondness for this institution, and our knowledge of the liberality and pecuniary powers of its founders, give us a most pleasing anticipation of its future great∣ness. Under your auspices, this seat of literature may flourish long after the republican glory of Columbia has eclipsed the splendour of eastern empire. By your munificence, the name of Rhode-Island College may be handed to posterity, when the Cambridge and Ox∣ford of Britain shall have faded from the page of history.</P>
<P>Then shall your reward be the reward of benefi∣cence. The votaries of science shall sprinkle the tear, and burn the incense of gratitude, over the tombs of their departed patrons.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE know you are persuaded that custom alone does not give birth to this address. We claim the privi∣lege of telling the world how much we feel obliged. Gratitude cannot be refused this small indulgence.</P>
<P>On this occasion, should we attempt to narrate the merits of our benefactor, modesty might raise a sus∣picion of adulation; envy would deduce our panegyric from the partiality of our hearts; while the world would inform us, that the science, knowledge and phi∣lanthrophy, of the man who has obliged us, are now become a theme of common conversation. We can, therefore, express our gratitude only; and ardently wish that others, in pursuit of science, may have the same director who has guided our steps.</P>
<P>Yes, if ever our souls, in the silent moments of de∣votion, have dared to heave a wishing sigh to heaven for a single favour on ourselves—often, when we be∣hold his face no more, often shall that wish be repeat∣ed, for the health and felicity of him, whom genera∣tions yet unknown shall learn to call their benefactor. The world shall join in our devotion: a prayer so benevolent must ascend grateful to the ear of heaven; and the immortal spirit of great MANNING, the im∣maculate companion of the LAMB, shall, with a smile of gratulation, behold <HI>you</HI> still the <HI>Father</HI> of his or∣phan seminary.</P>

as recollection can extend its eye, we behold each of your actions towards us rising up, like the kindness of a parent, and irresistibly charming us into grati∣tude. From you we have received the precepts of science. From you we have learned the philosophy of morals. While the lore of wisdom has flowed from your tongues, your examples have allured us into love of virtue and religion, or left us wicked beyond the reach of palliation.</P>
<P>We know your bosoms throb with parental anxiety for our prosperous reception in life. We are assured we shall have all the favours of your friendship, all the blessings heaven can bestow on your prayers.</P>
<P>Each of our good deeds will seem a kind of reward for your many favours. Each of our digressions from virtue, will wear the fable complexion of ingratitude.</P>
<P>Accept, generous Sirs, this little tribute of our thanks; and suffer us to soothe our hearts with un∣ceasing remembrance of your kindness.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow-Students,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM unwilling to leave the stage at this time, without addressing a few words to you. You are still in the career of collegiate acquisition. Still you enjoy those means of information which are now forever se∣cluded from us. Pant not with too much eagerness for the day of emancipation. On that day, you will think the moments of your collegiate existence have been few.</P>
<P>College is the world in miniature. There you may learn, not science only, but man himself. There you may examine each principle which actuates the human
<PB N="12" REF="030139_0011_0FE4A6CE6BBA3E90"/>
heart. There you may trace every passion from its first dawn, involved in the shades of kindred emotions, through all its various phases, until it blazes out in all the meridian glow of action.</P>
<P>The votary of that science which does not mend the heart, is, by its influence, transmuted into tenfold more a child of reprobation. Keep, therefore, your bosoms alive to all the exquisite emotions of virtue.</P>
<P>Suffer not a noble emulation, by eagerness of pur∣suit, to be degenerated into envy. Envy triumphs only in the expiring agonies of merit.</P>
<P>Beware of that passion which throws the dun mantle of suspicion over the white bosom of innocence.</P>
<P>Listen not to the whisper of slander. Slander in∣volves merit in darkness; as the black cloud of the north rolls over the brightness of heaven.</P>
<P>My good friends, live without a fault, and you shall live without a sigh, unless it be the sigh of sym∣pathy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Classmates,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OFTEN, on similar occasions, from this place, the world has heard the pathetic narration of colle∣giate joys that are past. I will not pretend to deter∣mine why this has been done. This narration may be all reality. It may be a customary story, told to lure from the eyes of pitying spectators the tear of sympa∣thy, as a tribute grateful to valedician eloquence. It may be an ingenious artifice, woven to conceal the loathsome visage of classical animosity.</P>
<P>Far from me be a wish to disguise the truth. Yet,
<PB N="13" REF="030139_0012_0FE4A6F00AE72EF8"/>
if we have had enmities, why may we not cease to feel them? Why may not the white hand of charity throw the veil of forgetfulness over those parts of our clas∣sical existence, which we cannot recollect without a painful emotion? Never will our bosoms soften with a warmer glow of forgiveness. Never, perhaps, shall we all meet again, till we meet beyond the narrow sea of time. Let us, therefore, on this day, solemnize the funeral of expiring enmity. Let us plant on its tomb the green olive of friendship. Let us part as brothers.</P>
<P>Must we then part? Yes, the dark curtain of sepa∣ration is now drawing between us. In a few hours we behold each others faces no more. To-morrow's sun shall see us scattered over the face of the world. We must now reciprocate a last adieu before a gazing mul∣titude. This task is ungrateful. Parting friends, like parting lovers, wish to lean on each others bosoms, and sigh a fond farewell in some sequestered shade, where no grief-unhallowed eye can violate the tender intercourse.</P>
<P>Are not we of that description? Are not we friends? Can it be otherwise? Memory is witness too faithful. Never, never can he who now addresses you, cease to feel the obligations of gratitude. When pale disease <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The speaker, while in College, was sick of a fever. During his illness, his class∣mates and fellow-students were his constant attendants.</NOTE> and excruciating pain stretched him on the restless couch for many a sleepless midnight, you watched his wants through all the tedious hours; you offered the cordial to his expiring spirits; you, with tender assi∣duities, soothed his groans, and cheered him back again to life. O my God! with thy tremendous bolt transfix this heart, if ever it cease to glow with joy at the joy of these my friends, or to melt with sorrow at their woes.</P>
<P>My good brothers, we this day launch out on the billowy ocean of life. A world lies before us. He

who smiles away the terrors of the tempest, is our Father.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>These two sentences are an imitations of Milton, b. 12, l. 646 and 647.</P>
<Q><L>The world was all before them, where to choose</L>
<L>Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.</L></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Let all our exertions ultimate on the felicity of our brother men. Then shall a heart, which never can re∣proach us, be our eternal companion. Then, when the grim messenger of fate shall point his iron shaft full at our breasts, with a magnanimous smile, we will meet dissolution; sleep undisturbed the sabbatism of death, and wake to ceaseless raptures beyond the re∣gions of time.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>The latter part of this sentence is an imitation of Pope, vol. iii. 12mo, p. 158.</P>
