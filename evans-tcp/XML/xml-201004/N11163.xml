<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Essays, were drawn up many years ago, partly as helps to moral and divine conference, in a religious society, and partly as the result of such conferences. They are generally the result of free, and pretty enlarged and comprehensive meditations on the subjects they treat of, and consist of such thoughts as occurred first and most obviously to the open mind, in its free and unfettered dis∣cursions on said subjects;—and they were meant meerly as hints to start the conver∣sation, and to keep it alive, and to the bu∣siness in hand, that it might not deviate in∣to wild and impertinent digressions.</P>
<P>THIS will account for the Nature and Form of the Essays, which are very singu∣lar and uncommon. They consist of a num∣ber of loose, general, and often, unconnect∣ed Aphorisms, or general Maxims, com∣monly closed by some practical corollaries or inferences of the greatest moment.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="014137_0003_0F97D456095F0C40"/>
THE primitive design of them, was to convey the most ample, general instruction to the mind on every subject treated of; yet so, as that instruction might exhaust the subject in Miniature, as it were, or, in the narrowest compass consistent with per∣spicuity, —and that the method of explain∣ing the subjects, should be calculated, as much as possible, for affecting the heart by proper motives, and stirring up men to the diligent practice of the virtues and duties explained. And I hope the judicious and intelligent Christian reader will find, up∣on an attentive perusal of the Essays themselves, that they are not ill adapted to this purpose; excepting, perhaps, a few, which are more superficial than the rest.</P>
<P>IT had been easy to have filled up these Skeletons of Doctrine, and lengthened them out to the ordinary size of pulpit discourses. In this form they would have had, doubt∣less, many advantages which they are now necessarily deprived of: In this form, they would have admitted of Connexion, Argu∣mentation, Illustration, Persuasion, Pathos,
<PB N="v" REF="014137_0004_0F97D45674DD14C0"/>and all the Graces and Beauties of fine Com∣position; whereas, their present form neces∣sarily precludes these advantages.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, in such a form, they would have been very volumnious and expensive: Few would have purchased them, and perhaps, fewer read them. The present volatile, irreligious taste, nauseates e∣very thing prolix in divinity. Five or six pages of a religious book is as much as we can, in conscience expect, that a modern fine Gen∣tleman or Lady should read at one sitting. The taste of the times is, therefore, purpose∣ly consulted in the shortness of these Essay</P>
<P>A PERSON of this squeamish disposition, may here read, in eight or ten minutes, some of the most important things which can be said on each of these subjects, without break∣ing off abruptly, in the midst of the sense, and losing the whole chain of connexion.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if the Essays are tolerably exe∣cuted on this plan, the doctrinal aphorisms contained in them, should be so plain and self-evident, as to supercede the necessity of arguments and illustrations; the prac∣tical
<PB N="vi" REF="014137_0005_0F97D459EFB9D988"/>corollaries should flow spontaneously and consequentially from these aphorisms, and the whole should be demonstratively built upon the scriptures referred to in the margin.</P>
<P>AFTER having humbly recommended these imperfect Essays to the public candour and indulgence, and implored the blessing of GOD upon them, for the general good; if I might presume to offer my advice to my fellow-creatures concerning the best way of using them,—it would be as fol∣lows: That they would read them, in their private and devout retirements, as Hints for Meditation on these important subjects, lay∣ing their minds open, without prejudice, to the influence of divine truth, and earnestly imploring the Father of lights to write these truths and virtues with sun-beams upon their understandings; convey them warm to their hearts, and make them powerfully opera∣tive and influential on all the active powers and faculties of their nature.</P>
<P>I HAVE added the Sermons as some com∣pensation to those who may disrelish the dryness of many of the Essay</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>of</HI> CONVERSION, <HI>or</HI> REGENERATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. RELIGION being a <HI>character,</HI> must have a <HI>principle;</HI> and this principle must supreme∣ly govern and predominate in the life. We do not call a man <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>friendly,</HI> unless generosity and friendship prevail in him above churlishness and un∣friendliness, and are fixed principles in his nature.—So it would be equally absurd to call a man <HI>religious,</HI> only because of the performance of a few outward religious duties, while the main of his temper and character is irreligious and immoral. <HI>He</HI> only deserves the charac∣ter of being <HI>religious,</HI> who is such uniformly and predo∣minantly, and in whom morality and religion is a pre∣vailing and discriminating character!</P>
<P N="2">2. TRUE religion, where it is, must govern the man; and nothing can do this but an <HI>inward principle.</HI> Grace, which is this principle, must oppose corruption, and fi∣nally prevail over it.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE word of GOD, and indeed the nature and rea∣son of things, place religion primarily and radically in the <HI>heart,</HI> and represent it as flowing thence into the life and conversation. The heart, as it is the source and fountain of all external corruption, so it must be of all true religion. The tree must first be made good before
<PB N="10" REF="014137_0009_0F97D45C7671D208"/>its fruit can be good. A bitter or polluted fountain, can∣not send forth pure or sweet water. Men gather not grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles. Good principles are necessarily prerequisite to <HI>morally</HI> or <HI>formally</HI> good ac∣tions. Accordingly, the whole stress is laid, in scripture, upon <HI>heart-religion;</HI> or that which is seated and radicated in the heart, and proceeds from pure and right principles and motives there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 26. Ezek. xxxvi. 26.—xviii. 31. Joel ii. 12, 13. Psal. li. and cxxxix. 1 Sam. xvi. 7. 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Deut. xiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it has been the general opinion of mankind, as well as the voice of scripture, that men are born into this world in a <HI>depraved, corrupt</HI> and <HI>irreligious</HI> state, with strong propensities to vice, and a disinclination to that which appears to be virtuous and good, by the very law of their nature, written on their conscience, and mani∣fested to them by their moral instinctive feelings; so it has been generally thought the peculiar work of the Dei∣ty, the GOD and <HI>Father</HI> of men, to help them, by his grace and Spirit, to rise out of this state of depravity and corruption, and to return to his obedience, favour and enjoyment, in the steep and narrow path of virtue and piety. This has ever been thought a care and work wor∣thy of GOD the Father of spirits, towards his human off∣spring; and even a heathen could say, <HI>Nullus vir magnus unquam fuit, sine Divino afflatu.</HI></P>

<P N="6">6. OUR Lord strongly expresses both the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>necessity</HI> of this change in sinners, by telling them, <HI>That unless they are born again of water, and of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>are converted,</HI> they not only <HI>shall not,</HI> but even <HI>cannot, enter in∣to the kingdom of heaven</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John iii. 3, 5. Matth. xviii. 3. Luke viii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. GRANTING these expressions of <HI>a new birth by the Spirit,</HI> and a becoming <HI>new-creatures,</HI> and the like, to be <HI>figurative</HI> and <HI>metaphorical;</HI> yet if these metaphors have any significancy and propriety at all, they must imply the following truths; namely, (1.) That the change of a sinner by conversion or regeneration, must be <HI>exceeding great,</HI> bearing some analogy to the difference between the circumstances of a child before and after its birth;—or between a being in a state of non-entity, and after the commencement of its existence, in some essential respects at least.—(2.) That it is not a <HI>partial,</HI> but an <HI>universal</HI> change; a change of the whole bent of the heart and drift and direction of the affections.—(3.) That it is not a meer <HI>outward, imperfect</HI> change, but one that is <HI>in∣ward, essential</HI> and <HI>complete.</HI>—(4.) That it is a change not produced by the sinner's own natural powers and endea∣vours, but <HI>wholly supernatural,</HI> the product of a <HI>divine a∣gency,</HI> effected and produced by the Spirit of God: And (5.) That it is a change absolutely necessary in every son and daughter of Adam, in order to their entering in∣to the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P N="8">8. EITHER these inferences are plainly and clearly de∣ducible from these metaphors; or, otherwise, the me∣taphors must not only be supposed highly <HI>improper,</HI> but even <HI>pernicious;</HI> tending to mislead the judgments of men, and obscuring a doctrine of great importance to men's salvation, otherwise plain and obvious in itself,
<PB N="12" REF="014137_0011_0F97D45DF68978B8"/>which would be a high imputation on the wisdom and goodness of GOD, and an unanswerable objection against the revelation of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. SELF-LOVE, a <HI>desire of reputation</HI> and <HI>fame,</HI> and a prin∣ciple of <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>slavish fear,</HI> often produce a kind of re∣ligious character, which is merely outward and greatly imperfect.</P>
<P N="10">10. ALTHOUGH that seed of grace, which is the prin∣ciple of the spiritual life, is infused <HI>at once</HI> into the whole nature, in the act of regeneration, and gives it a holy taste, bent, turn, tendency and direction; yet the fruits of it shew themselves but <HI>gradually</HI> and <HI>successively,</HI> in the progressive work of sanctification, as occasions, trials and opportunities elicit and draw them forth into act and view.</P>
<P N="11">11. IF regeneration, agreeable to the import of the metaphor, be an <HI>instantaneous</HI> act or operation of the holy Spirit upon the soul, producing a radical, essential change in its temper, giving it a new principle of spiri∣tual life, a general divine bent and tendency:—And if sanctification and mortification are only effects of this new and divine principle of life, carrying on a continu∣al conflict and warfare against the corruptions of nature, and a gradually strengthening and confirming the habits of virtue and holiness;—then may we very easily and ra∣tionally account for an <HI>imperfect Christian</HI> going directly to heaven, at death, without the necessity of any <HI>interme∣diate purgatorial</HI> sufferings to fit him for that world of per∣fect purity. The soul, from the moment of its regene∣ration, was holy, and was defiled only in consequence of its union with a corrupt bodily nature, with which it was carrying on a continual warfare. In the moment of death, it was released from this corrupt bodily nature, and sprung, immaculate, to its kindred spirits, and its native heaven. The grave is a furnace which will <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ify</HI> and <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fine</HI> this corrupt body, whence
<PB N="13" REF="014137_0012_0F97D45EB5371BA0"/>it will be raised a glorious, spiritual body, and a fit com∣panion for the glorified spirit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Subject continued. <HI>The corrupt, grulty, lost and help∣less State of Man before Conversion.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE scripture evidence of the wretched state of man <HI>by nature,</HI> is very extensive. Among a vast multitude of scriptures, the following may be consult∣ed; Psal. li. 5. Eph. ii. 1, 3. Job xiv. 4. Psal. xiv. 1—3. Jer. xvii. 9. Isa. lxiv. 6. Rom. vii. 14, to the end.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST is said to have come as a physician to the <HI>sick,</HI> and to seek that which was <HI>lost.</HI> The prodigal is re∣presented as <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>lost,</HI> and his conversion is termed a <HI>coming to himself,</HI> a <HI>being found,</HI> and a <HI>coming again to life.</HI> Conversion is termed a <HI>new birth,</HI> a <HI>new creation;</HI> and sin∣ners, before conversion, are said to be <HI>dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> The unconverted man is said, <HI>not to receive the things of the Spirit of</HI> GOD; <HI>they are foolishness to him,</HI> neither <HI>can he know them.</HI> Conversion is represented as a work of great power; such as GOD exerted in Christ when he raised him up from the dead.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM all these scripture representations we may infer the exceeding <HI>helplessness</HI> of sinners, in an uncon∣verted state. A dead person hath no power to rise. We cannot come to Christ unless the Father draw us. We cannot think a good thought. All our sufficiency is of GOD, who must work in us both to will and to do; and without Christ we can do nothing. We cannot be con∣verted
<PB N="14" REF="014137_0013_0F97D45F773F2C58"/>without the Spirit: But the Spirit is the Father's free gift in Christ. He must open our eyes before we can <HI>see,</HI> and create us anew in Christ Jesus before we can <HI>spiritually live</HI> and <HI>act.</HI> Faith is the first grace acted by a converted Christian; and yet this faith we cannot act of ourselves, <HI>it is the gift of</HI> GOD. We are naturally cor∣rupt and disinclined to good before our conversion, and <HI>here</HI> lies our helplessness, until God by his quickening Spirit gives life to our souls, and enables us to will and to do, and creates us anew in Christ Jesus to good works.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM <HI>reason, observation</HI> and <HI>experience</HI> we have the following evidences of this truth: (1.) We know good and evil by our natural conscience; yet we find in our∣selves a strong disinclination to the good which we ap∣prove, and a prevailing inclination to the evil which we disapprove.—(2.) We know that we are very unlike GOD, and that we do not cordially love and chuse him and his laws: But GOD could not form creatures with such a temper: This therefore proves, that we are now degenerated from our first state, and become corrupt creatures.—(3.) If children come into the world such as we may suppose that God first created man, <HI>i. e. holy,</HI> and with a <HI>propensity to good,</HI> or even in a state of indif∣ference to good and evil; some would surely be virtu∣ous from the womb upwards; some would surely follow the good principle of their nature, especially as <HI>praise</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> lie on that side; but universal observation and experience prove the contrary, as well as the word of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. liii. 1,—3. Rom iii. 10, &amp;c.</NOTE>.—(4.) If men were not born corrupt and impo∣tent, a virtuous and religious education would bring all who are blessed with it over to the side of virtue, in spite of evil example: But do we not plainly see that chil∣dren are backward to imitate good examples, and prone to follow bad ones? They greedily suck in evil advice and the knowledge of wicked things; but it requires

If we attentively examine our own hearts, lives and experiences but for <HI>one day,</HI> we shall have an overpower∣ing conviction of our dreadful corruption. How readi∣ly do we forget GOD? How averse are our minds to the contemplation of him and his perfections? How little do we think of the love of Christ? We read or hear with unconcern, the amazing story of his love, and feel little or no gratitude for it. Our memories, our thoughts, our meditations, the general bent and tenour of our affecti∣ons and passions, even our religious duties, and our very best works, may convince us of the wretchedness of our state by nature.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE see that a virtuous and Christian education cannot, of itself, recover our natures, or remove their corruption.—We see that the study of philosophy and the knowledge of the scriptures, cannot accomplish this. —We see that the most powerful preaching, and best adapted means of grace, cannot effect this great change. —We see men making many vows and resolutions, and labouring hard in the way of outward means, to rise from their corruptions, and yet all prove ineffectual.— We have often, in an unconverted state, been convinced of our guiltiness and danger; we have often resolved to do better, and we have bound <HI>our resolutions</HI> with <HI>solemn vows:</HI> —We have even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a time to begin a better life; but before that time came, our resolutions have proved as the morning cloud. And even when we have at∣tempted to mend our life and conduct, have we not found ourselves so exceeding feeble, as to be unable to effect any thing to purpose? Have we not felt, as it were, a dead weight pulling us backwards, and sinking us down into the bed of sloth, carnal security and inaction?

<P N="1">1. THOUGH GOD hath reserved in his own hands the great work of Conversion, as his <HI>own proper work,</HI> and we cannot therefore convert ourselves; yet we ought not to say that we can do nothing. GOD hath given to unconverted sinners a great deal of important work to do, and put it in their power to do it;—hath obliged them by commands, persuaded them by exhor∣tations, awed them by threatenings, engaged them by motives, encouraged them by promises, and given them reason to expect that he will meet with them and con∣vert them in the performance of this work. He hath al∣so laid their help on one who is mighty to save.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALTHOUGH unconverted sinners are <HI>spiritually dead,</HI> yet they are not <HI>naturally so.</HI> They have an understand∣ing, a will and a memory: They may know something of their guilt and danger: They may understand some∣thing of Christ and his saving design: They may read and hear, think and meditate on GOD'S word; frequent his house, and attend his ordinances. But if sinners will not do these things, they will not do what they <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>are able</HI> to do, and therefore are inexcusable.</P>
<P N="3">3. A DISPENSATION of GOD'S Spirit attends his gos∣pel, and he hath promised to give his Spirit to them
<PB N="17" REF="014137_0016_0F97D461B68C9598"/>that ask him; to <HI>all</HI> that ask him, without limitation or reserve. He hath even made it the duty of sinners to ask this Spirit, and to attend diligently on divine ordi∣nances, which are the walks of the Spirit. Now, if sin∣ners know that they cannot be converted without this Spirit, and that they cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven, unless they are converted; and if, notwithstand∣ing they know this, they do not diligently ask it of GOD, nor attend on those instrumental duties and means of grace, in the use of which this Spirit is dispensed, then they are wholly to blame for continuing uncon∣verted.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD is following sinners with the common influ∣ences and operations of his Spirit; striving with them, and seeking admittance into their hearts. Now, if sin∣ners would obey and cherish this common operation, and ask the special and converting influences of the Spirit, he has obliged himself by promise to give it them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 9,—13. Rev. iii. 20.—xxii. 17.</NOTE>: But if, on the contrary, they resist and grieve this holy Spirit, which would have sealed them to the day of re∣demption, they themselves are wholly to blame for con∣tinuing unconverted.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF the case were even otherwise, and there were but a <HI>bare probability,</HI> or even a <HI>possibility,</HI> that the humble and earnest endeavours of a sinner might meet with accep∣tance, and be crowned with success, he is wholly inex∣cuseable and condemnable in neglecting these endea∣vours.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The same Subject continued. <HI>The Duty of unconverted Persons.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SUCH ought often and seriously to consider, That it is impossible they should ever go to heaven in their present state. The scriptures expressly preclude them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 3. Luck xiii. 5. John iii. 3, 5. 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.</NOTE>; and in the very reason and nature of things, they are wholly disqualified both for the <HI>employments</HI> and <HI>enjoyments</HI> of the heavenly state.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY should labour to obtain a deep sense of the danger and misery of an unconverted state: of the evil and guilt of sin, and of the torments to which it will un∣avoidably expose the unconverted sinner, who dies in his iniquities.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEY should frequently consider the shortness and uncertainty of the <HI>present life,</HI> which is their <HI>only working day,</HI> their only <HI>period of trial</HI> and preparation for eternity, and that death will shortly put an end to all their <HI>hope, help</HI> and <HI>endeavours;</HI> and therefore, as they value salvation, they should not delay conversion.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY should labour for a deep, convictive sense of their own inability to convert themselves, and that they must perish for ever unless GOD help them, and that speedily.</P>
<P N="5">5. THEY should endeavour after a thorough and firm persuasion, that there is <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>help</HI> for them in GOD, and that they <HI>may,</HI> and assuredly <HI>will,</HI> obtain the grace of conversion, if they take the right method, and labour diligently in seeking it. They should set it before them
<PB N="19" REF="014137_0018_0F97D4633606DB38"/>in firm purpose and resolution, as a settled and determin∣ed point, that by the help of GOD, they <HI>will</HI> be con∣verted, and that they will never give over seeking the blessing, in all the appointed means of grace, until they find it; saying with <HI>Jacob,</HI> <Q>I will not let thee go, un∣til thou bless me.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. THEY should <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>resolutely</HI> set about deny∣ing all manner of know sin, and every tempting com∣panion and amusement, and attempt the performance of every known duty, as well as they are able, without de∣lay; uncertain how quickly death may cut them off in their sins, and frustrate all purposes of future amendment.</P>
<P N="7">7. ALL this should be attempted <HI>in the strength of</HI> GOD, through Christ, assuredly depending <HI>on,</HI> and confiding <HI>in</HI> his help in the way of duty, and perpetually keeping up a deep sense of their own impotence; that all their suf∣ficiency is of GOD, and that, of themselves, they can do nothing; but all things, Christ strengthening them.</P>
<P N="8">8. THEY should <HI>instantly</HI> and <HI>forthwith</HI> make choice of GOD for their portion and blessedness, and attempt to enter into solemn covenant with him through Christ. They should bring themselves back to him as returning prodigals; give <HI>themselves, their interest,</HI> and all their <HI>powers</HI> and <HI>abilities</HI> up to him, as his long-abused proper∣ty, and submit to him in all things.</P>
<P N="9">9. THEY should attempt <HI>daily</HI> and <HI>perpetually</HI> to ac∣cept of Christ, by faith, in all his saving offices, giving up their polluted, diseased souls into his hands as their compassionate Physician and Redeemer; assuredly be∣lieving, that he will in no wise cast them out or reject them, and firmly trusting both his power and his grace.</P>
<P N="10">10. IF, in the course of these endeavours, the unre∣newed heart rises up against these duties, and the <HI>world</HI> and the <HI>devil</HI> tempt the sinner to slight them as <HI>needless,</HI> or to neglect them as <HI>impossible,</HI> or <HI>too severe,</HI> (which will doubtless be often the case) it would be the wisest course
<PB N="20" REF="014137_0019_0F97D463F50BAE70"/>for the person, thus tempted, to flee instantly to GOD, by prayer, for succour, and to get the temptation remov∣ed. One earnest look unto GOD, upon such occasions, has been found by experience, to bring more strength into the soul, and to be more efficacious against temp∣tation, than all the human reasoning and resolutions in the world. However, it is the duty of the sinner to op∣pose the temptation <HI>by all means,</HI> and <HI>with all his might;</HI> and it would be wise, beforehand, to be always expect∣ing such trials, and to be pre-engaging the almighty aid against the hour of temptation.</P>
<P N="11">11. As the unconverted should never neglect <HI>secret prayer,</HI> nor <HI>any one ordinance</HI> which they can attend; so, when the <HI>Spirit of</HI> GOD moves upon their souls, either in convincing them of sin and misery, or in exciting holy thoughts and good resolutions, they should cherish these motions, and pray GOD, at the time, to increase and set home these convictions, till they issue in an effectual and saving coversion: For, if they resist, and quench, and grieve the holy Spirit, he will leave them, and they are in danger of being undone for ever.</P>
<P N="12">12. To help them in these duties, they should often set a part seasons for more solemn meditation, self-exa∣mination and prayer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The same Subject continued. <HI>Symptoms of an unconvert∣ed State.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHATEVER characters the scriptures re∣present as under an impossibility of entering into the kingdom of heaven, are certainly to be reckon∣ed
<PB N="21" REF="014137_0020_0F97D464B4E64838"/>among the unconverted. Such are <HI>all unbelievers</HI> and <HI>in penitent sinners;</HI>—all habitual fornicators, adulterers, unclean, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extorti∣oners, idolaters, envious, malicious persons, strife-mak∣ers, sowers of sedition, and the like<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. Cal. v. 19—21. Eph. v. 5, &amp;c. Rev. xxi. 8. Mark xvi. 10.</NOTE>. Yet it should be observed,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT in order to pronounce men unconverted, we must suppose them under the dominion of these sins, and to be living customarily and habitually in the prac∣tice of them: Which will appear from their committing them <HI>freely,</HI> and with <HI>delight; frequently; pleading for them; palliating</HI> and <HI>extenuating</HI> them, and hating to be admo∣nished and reproved on account of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. MEN who continue wilfully ignorant of their chri∣stian duty, and careless about it (which may be known by their undervaluing, despising and neglecting the means of knowledge and of grace) are certainly in an unconverted state. All church-neglecters come under this predicament.</P>
<P N="4">4. MEN who are careless of their <HI>hearts</HI> and <HI>thoughts,</HI> and give themselves little trouble about their <HI>hidden sins</HI> and <HI>heart-plagues,</HI> notwithstanding they may be pretty careful and conscientious in the outward part of moral and religious duties, are certainly unconverted: For, where there is true grace, it turns the eye inward to the heart, and the true convert is most watchful against hid∣den corruptions.</P>
<P N="5">5. THOSE who neglect the duties of <HI>secret prayer, medi∣tation</HI> and <HI>self-examination,</HI> although they may be scrupu∣lously punctual in attending the public ordinances of re∣ligion, are certainly unconverted: For, secret duties, more especially <HI>secret prayer,</HI> is the <HI>first,</HI> the <HI>continued,</HI> and the <HI>last</HI> duty of the converted soul.</P>
<P N="6">6. WANT <HI>of relish</HI> for <HI>holy actions,</HI> and <HI>religious duties;</HI> a <HI>distaste</HI> to them; a desire that they were not necessary,
<PB N="22" REF="014137_0021_0F97D46739A08C58"/>and a being pleased with any excuse to get rid of them, are very sure signs of an unconverted state; more espe∣cially, when this disrelish for holiness is accompanied with an inordinate desire of, and hankering after world∣ly enjoyments and sensual pleasures.</P>
<P N="7">7. MEN, who upon impartial examination, find that they are no better than they were many years ago, but rather more vicious and depraved, have all the reason in the world to pass an unfavourable judgment on their state: For grace is of a growing nature, and where it is, car∣ries forward the soul progressively to higher attainments in virtue and holiness.</P>
<P N="8">8. MEN who have freely indulged vice in their youth, and can remember no time since when they were greatly humbled before GOD for their youthful lusts; greatly exercised about deliverance from their guilt and domi∣nion, and made to abandon them with indignation; and who are not very sensible of some remarkable change for the better, both in their hearts and lives, may certainly conclude that they are yet in <HI>the gall of bitterness.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. A MAN who is not <HI>rationally assured,</HI> and who does not sometimes <HI>feel,</HI> that he loves GOD above all things, and that he is ready to part with all things, his most va∣lued interests, his most beloved lusts, and even life itself, in obedience to his will, and rather than give up his title to him:—He who loves any creature more than GOD—earth more than heaven—his body more than his soul;—who had rather be rich than good, and pre∣fers the pleasures of this world before GOD'S favour and enjoyment, is certainly unconverted.</P>
<P N="10">10. THAT man, who upon the most deliberate con∣sideration, is not willing to deny himself the most belov∣ed gratifications; to take up his cross and follow his Redeemer through poverty, contempt, persecution and even martyrdom itself; who does not cordially accept and embrace him in all his characters, submit to him in
<PB N="23" REF="014137_0022_0F97D4681FE43AF8"/>all his offices, trust him without reserve, and give up all things <HI>to</HI> him and <HI>for</HI> him, is certainly still in an unrege∣rate, unconverted state.</P>

Matth. xxv. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE unconverted are enemies to GOD by wicked works; full of natural antipathy and enmity against his being, nature, will and laws. The principle which prevails in their hearts, would naturally lead them to
<PB N="24" REF="014137_0023_0F97D468753FED70"/>dethrone and destroy the blessed GOD, if they had the power,—And being such, GOD is a consuming fire to them: His nature and all his laws are against them, and so are also all his perfections, except his mercy, which indeed waits a while to be gracious; but, being abused and slighted, will in the end aggravate their guilt and misery.</P>
<P N="5">5. SUCH continue under the guilt of all the sins they ever have committed. Every law and threatning in the Bible is against them: They are condemned already; sentence is already passed against them in numberless places; so that nothing but the slender and precarious thread of present life suspends the execution.</P>
<P N="6">6. THEY are on the very brink of perdition, moment∣ly in danger of dropping into a place and state of end∣less misery. Every night they lie down, there is even something more than a possibility, that before the morn∣ing's light, they may lift up their eyes, being in torments.</P>
<P N="7">7. THEY have no covenant right or title to any mer∣cy they enjoy. Every blessing they enjoy has the na∣ture of a <HI>curse</HI> to them, in the manner in which they re∣ceive and use it. This earth is only their prison, where they are for a short time, supported by GOD, 'till the time of their execution comes. <HI>The wicked is reserved to the day of destraction; they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxi. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF they were perfectly known, their case would be pitied, and their nature hated, by every good person on earth. And the angels and other holy spirits, so far as they know them, do thus regard them.</P>
<P N="9">9. IF such did thoroughly know their own wretched and perilous condition, they could not possibly enjoy one moment's peace, tranquility or happiness in this life. And, indeed, whatever of this kind they do enjoy, is on∣ly a fatal delusory happiness, founded on <HI>false hopes;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="014137_0024_0F97D4693484DEB8"/>producing a <HI>destructive security,</HI> and issuing in <HI>endless despair.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. THERE is only left for them this comfort, that they are yet out of a place of torment, and that there is still hope and help for them in GOD, through Christ, if they will speedily embrace the opportunity. The <HI>pre∣sent moment</HI> is all they can rationally rely upon, in which to better their state, and cast the die for eternity!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The same Subject continued. <HI>Mistakes about Conversion rectified.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT has been already observed, that conversion is a <HI>thorough</HI> and <HI>remarkable</HI> change; and therefore, that those persons must be deceived, who imagine them∣selves to have been truly converted, merely because of some <HI>outward, partial,</HI> and <HI>incomplete</HI> change which they may have undergone, either from difference in age and circumstances in life; alterations in their health, consti∣tution, or interests and connexions; the principles of self-love, honour and reputation; legal pannies and ter∣rors, or from false and incomplete views of religion. It may now be observed <HI>negatively,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT <HI>christian baptism</HI> cannot be that conversion or regeneration, to which the promise of heaven is an∣nexed: For we are expresly told, that unless a man is born again of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as well as of <HI>water,</HI> he <HI>cannot</HI> en∣ter into the kingdom of GOD. Besides, many baptized persons, are amongst the wickedest of men, and have evident and absolute need of spiritual regeneration.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="014137_0025_0F97D469F479BF10"/>
(2.) THE <HI>bare profession,</HI> even of a <HI>true religion,</HI> how∣ever specious, is not conversion: Else all the professors of a true religion would be <HI>true converts;</HI> which we know is far from being the case in fact. Much less,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) CAN it consist in a man's changing his religious profession: For this may be, and often is done from <HI>worldly, interested, luerative</HI> motives, and <HI>false, erroneous</HI> principles, and not from convictions of truth and duty.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) STRONG convictions of sin, and great fear of GOD'S wrath, cannot, of themselves, prove a sinner to be truly converted. If so, we must conclude, that <HI>Cain, Herod, Pilate, Simon Magus</HI> and <HI>Judas Iscariot,</HI> were true converts, which is not true in fact; because the terrors of these unhappy men did not issue in true repentance.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) AN <HI>external sober, moral conduct,</HI> a life free from the gross outward acts of sin, and a regular attendance on the ordinances of religion, are no certain evidences of conversion, though they may justly command the respect and esteem of our fellow-men. This was the righteousness of the <HI>Pharisees:</HI> It is also the righteous∣ness of most hypocrites and formalists: And yet our Saviour, who knew and detected the real characters of these men, has assured us, that unless <HI>our righteousness</HI> shall <HI>exceed theirs,</HI> we shall in no wise enter into the king∣dom of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) A MAN'S really renouncing and abandoning some sin or sins, to which he has been addicted, cannot prove him a true convert, while he continues in the love and practice of other sins. <HI>Herod</HI> heard <HI>John Baptist</HI> gladly, and did many things in obedience to his minis∣try, which were not much against his natural inclina∣tion; but would by no means part with his beloved lust, his darling <HI>Herodias</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark vi. 20, 23.</NOTE>. Men do many things of this kind from meer prudential motives, and because these sins are destructive of their health, interest and re∣putation:
<PB N="27" REF="014137_0026_0F97D46AB4476470"/>But he who offends <HI>wilfully, allowedly</HI> and <HI>per∣severingly</HI> in one point, is guilty of the whole law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James ii. 10.</NOTE>; and plainly shews that he despises the authority by which it is enjoined, and obedience to it enforced.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) A MAN'S shewing remarkable zeal in religion, is no certain proof that he is a true convert, or a real Christian. Zeal is either <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> according to the <HI>objects</HI> about which it is employed, the <HI>motives</HI> from which it originates, and the <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI> with which it is exercised. If zeal be <HI>according to knowledge,</HI> it can hardly exceed in the measure of it; for it is always good to be zealously affected in a good thing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 18.</NOTE>: But a <HI>blind, ignorant</HI> and <HI>misguided</HI> zeal, is the most furious, mischiev∣ous and destructive of all the passions. The apostles knew not what manner of spirit they were of, when in a paroxism of their frantic zeal, they called for fire from heaven to destroy the <HI>Samaritans</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 25.</NOTE>. As touching zeal, <HI>St. Paul,</HI> when <HI>Saul,</HI> persecuted the church of Christ, and destroyed that which he should have built up<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Read Acts ix. Gal. i. 13, &amp;c. Phil. iii. 5, 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT has been already said, <HI>positively,</HI> and I here re∣peat it, That conversion is a <HI>great, universal, radical</HI> change of the soul, by the regenerating influences of the Spirit of GOD,—not of the <HI>substance</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of the soul; but of its <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>principles;</HI>—not such as to preclude all sin and corruption in this life; but such as causes pie∣ty and virtue to predominate in the character, and as it lays a foundation for <HI>progress in holiness,</HI> and <HI>final perfection.</HI> It is, in short, a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>divine nature</HI> and <HI>principle,</HI> gene∣rating a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>divine life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>foreruaners</HI> and <HI>concomitant attendants</HI> of this change, are generally, as follows: (1.) This change is preceded by such a conviction of guilt and pollution, as deeply humbles the soul before GOD, and makes it
<PB N="28" REF="014137_0027_0F97D46B7541DD88"/>feel itself exposed to eternal misery; that it is <HI>helpless</HI> and <HI>lying at undeserved mercy,</HI> and that it <HI>must perish,</HI> if it re∣ceives not <HI>this mercy.</HI>—(2.) By such a sense of the evil of sin, as causes the soul to abhor it, and to wish above all things to be freed from its dominion and pollution.— (3.) By such a sense of the depravity and badness of the sinner's heart, as makes him see the necessity of its being changed by divine grace, and makes him wish, above all things to be truly regenerated.—(4.) By such a sense of the sinner's inability to change his own heart and af∣fections, as makes him feel that it never can be done, unless GOD is pleased to take the work wholly into his own hands.—(5.) By such a sense of the sinner's <HI>need of Christ,</HI> as makes him see his help in him alone, so as earnestly to desire to embrace him; to be united to him, and found in him:—And <HI>finally,</HI> by such a sight and sense of the power and grace of Christ, his all-sufficien∣cy to save unto the uttermost, and his fulness and suit∣ableness to all the sinner's wants and desires, as engages the sinner, as a <HI>lost, sin-sick, perishing</HI> creature, to cast him∣self chearfully into the hands of this glorious, compassi∣onate Redeemer, with a full and unshaken confidence, that he will work the great salvation <HI>in him</HI> and <HI>for him,</HI> and give him a complete victory over every enemy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The same Subject continued. <HI>The Way of discerning true Conversion by its Effects and Consequences.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS soon as the Spirit of GOD regenerates the soul, it is conscious of a <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of <HI>light</HI> and <HI>knowledge</HI> which it had not before, and is possessed with
<PB N="29" REF="014137_0028_0F97D46C352CA7D8"/><HI>correspondent affections.</HI> It knows <HI>itself</HI> in a different man∣ner from what it formerly did. Unconverted men do little study and little know their <HI>inward man.</HI> Their thoughts and observations are chiefly employed about <HI>outward circumstances</HI> and <HI>external accomplishments:</HI> But the light of grace opens a new scene to the soul, the eye of which is turned <HI>inward, backward</HI> and <HI>forward;</HI> and as light increases, it still sees more and more of its natural <HI>deformity, vileness</HI> and <HI>guiltiness,</HI> and more and more ad∣mires that <HI>wonderful mercy,</HI> which regarded it in its low condition, and undertook its redemption and deliver∣ance.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE converted soul knows and sees GOD in quite a different manner from what was usual. A <HI>new</HI> and <HI>glo∣rious</HI> light shines now on all his <HI>perfections, providences, laws</HI> and <HI>works.</HI> In its unrenewed state, it had indeed a speculative knowledge of GOD, which struck it at times, with wonder and admiration: But now GOD appears in∣comparably glorious and amiable; a fit object of the soul's love and choice, and its desirable portion. For∣merly, it could observe his wondrous works and adorable providences, without considering GOD in them: But now the whole world seems full of GOD; GOD appears more or less to the soul in every work, in every provi∣dence, in every mercy, and in every affliction: and the soul sees and approves his <HI>glory</HI> and <HI>beauty,</HI> his <HI>power</HI> and <HI>wisdom,</HI> his <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>goodness</HI> in all; is charmed with these manifestations of him, and follows hard after him as its <HI>only</HI> and <HI>all-sufficient portion.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE converted soul has quite a new kind of know∣ledge and apprehension of <HI>Christ</HI> to what it formerly had. Unconverted persons, at the very best, only consider Christ as a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>worthy person,</HI> and a <HI>benefactor</HI> to a guilty world; as sustaining a most <HI>heroical</HI> and <HI>benevolent</HI> character, and therefore worthy the admiration and praise of men: But the true convert sees Christ, by
<PB N="30" REF="014137_0029_0F97D46CF4387050"/>faith, as the <HI>chief among ten thousand, and altogether lovely.</HI> There is a kind of secret, unaccountable charm in the very <HI>name,</HI> and <HI>idea</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> that excites his love and draws his affections; whom having not seen, he loves, and in whom, although now he sees him not, yet be∣lieving, he exults and rejoices, with a joy unspeakable and full of glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pet. i. 8.</NOTE>. He sees an inexpressible beauty in his <HI>person</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aracter,</HI> and a wonderful excellency, fit∣ness and necessity in all his <HI>saving offices;</HI> and, in this view, Christ is exceeding dear and precious to him. He tegards him as his <HI>Lord,</HI> his <HI>love,</HI> his <HI>life,</HI> his <HI>friend,</HI> his <HI>wisaom, righteousness, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctification</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>omption.</HI> When you speak of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, his heart leaps with grati∣tude and joy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is ready to cry out, <Q>This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Je∣rusalem;</HI> —he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o bath loved me, and washed me from my sins in his own blood;—he in whom I have believed, and to whom I have committed my soul, against that day;—my Saviour, my Lord, my Jadge, and my portion!</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. THE real convert has quite a new knowledge and judgment of GOD'S <HI>holy law,</HI> and quite new regards and affections respecting it. The <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s prayer is now answered in him, <Q>Lord, open thou mine eyes, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I may behold wondrous things out of thy law<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 18.</NOTE>.</Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, indeed, beholds GOD'S law with <HI>mew eyes,</HI> and regard, it with <HI>new affections.</HI> As the very best among unconvert∣ed persons have very <HI>false, contracted, unworthy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the divine law; so neither are they cordial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the strictness of its requirements, and that holin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it enjoins. <Q>The carnal mind is enmity again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD; for it is not subject to the law of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in∣deed can be: For the law is <HI>spiritual,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on∣ly relished and delighted in by a <HI>removed, spiritual</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="014137_0030_0F97D46DB433FF98"/>mind; but <HI>such</HI> are <HI>carnal, sold under sin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 14.—viii. 7</NOTE>.</Q> Some of the divine laws, indeed, which do not cross their belov∣ed lusts, may, in some measure, gain their liking and approbation, and they may be ashamed to speak evil of the law in general, which the reason of mankind and the scriptures of truth, pronounce to be <HI>holy, jusi</HI> and <HI>good</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 12.</NOTE>: But still their corrupt hearts and natures reluctate against the <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>perfection</HI> of the divine law; and the more they know of its purity, exceeding broadness, and the unabating, unremitting strictness of its requirements, still the more do their hearts rise up against it. Now, converting grace reconciles both the <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>affec∣tions</HI> to the purity of the divine law, both by opening the sinner's eyes to behold the beauty of holiness, and by conforming and attempering his heart to that purity and spirituality which the law requires. <Q>He delights in the law of GOD, after the inward man;</Q> he con∣sents that it is <HI>holy, just</HI> and <HI>good;</HI> and when his corrup∣tions would lead him to violate its precepts, he wholly condemns himself, and approves that law, which, thro' the momentary prevalence of corruption, he trangresses<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. throughout.</NOTE>. But that I may be brief,</P>
<P N="5">5. THE renewed soul has quite a new knowledge and judgment of <HI>sin,</HI> and his heart stands quite differently af∣fected towards it.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE instrumental duties of religion; <HI>divine ordi∣nances</HI> and <HI>religious duties,</HI> are regarded in a quite other manner than usual by the renewed sinner, and perform∣ed and frequented on quite disterent principles, and for quite different ends and purposes; namely, to promote the glory of GOD, and obtain spiritual communion with him in the use of these means.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE <HI>passions</HI> and leading <HI>affections</HI> of the renewed soul, have quite a <HI>new tendency, bent</HI> and <HI>direction.</HI> His <HI>joys</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="014137_0031_0F97D46E76801E30"/>are quite new, as to their objects; and so are his <HI>desires</HI> and <HI>aversions,</HI> his <HI>cares</HI> and <HI>fears,</HI> his <HI>hopes</HI> and <HI>sorrows.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. IN a word, a man, after conversion, may be said to be a <HI>new creature;</HI> he has new <HI>principles,</HI> new <HI>ends,</HI> new <HI>purposes</HI> and <HI>pursuits,</HI> new <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>enemies,</HI> new <HI>interests,</HI> new <HI>pains</HI> and <HI>pleasures,</HI> and consequently, a <HI>new nature;</HI> according to that very plain and emphatical declaration of the Apostle, <HI>Therefore, if any man be in</HI> Christ, <HI>he is a</HI> NEW CREATURE: OLD <HI>things are</HI> PASSED AWAY; <HI>behold,</HI> ALL THINGS <HI>are become</HI> NEW<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="9">9. IF these things, therefore, be so; if such is the <HI>universal</HI> and <HI>remarkable</HI> change wrought in the sinner by regeneration, Is it possible that such a change can have long passed upon men, and yet they be totally ignorant of the matter?</P>
<P N="10">10. IT may indeed happen, that a few are savingly changed in <HI>infancy</HI> and <HI>childhood,</HI> and under the influence of an early Christian education, before vicious habits have been formed and confirmed in the soul. In others also, the change (as to the sensible effects of it) may have been <HI>slow, gradual,</HI> and almost <HI>imperceptible;</HI> and so, neither the <HI>work</HI> itself, nor the <HI>time</HI> when it was perform∣ed, may be discerned or acknowledged, in a course of ma∣ny years. It may also happen, in some cases, that all the symptoms of a <HI>saving</HI> and <HI>effectual</HI> conversion may be felt, and yet those who feel them, may long doubt of their <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>reality,</HI> and suspect that they are <HI>fallacious</HI> and <HI>counterfeit;</HI> until the Spirit himself shines upon his own work, and compels (as it were) a convictive evi∣dence of its truth; <Q>The Spirit witnessing with their spirits<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 16.</NOTE>:</Q> However, it is next to impossible, but that all must know, that a <HI>great work has been wrought upon them,</HI> and <HI>a mighty change</HI> has passed <HI>in them;</HI> and that "whereas they were once blind, now they see<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John ix. 25.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="33" REF="014137_0032_0F97D46F34270748"/>
11. IT may be laid down as a general maxim, to which experience and observation have furnished very few exceptions, That the <HI>greater sinners</HI> men have been, the <HI>deeper</HI> and more <HI>humiliating</HI> have been their convicti∣ons of sin, and the <HI>more sensible</HI> and <HI>remarkable</HI> this great change in them, both to themselves and others.</P>
<P N="12">12. WHAT must we rationally and probably infer con∣cerning persons of this character, who have never yet experienced any such remarkable change in themselves? —Either, that they are total strangers to <HI>self-examination</HI> and <HI>self-knowledge</HI> (which is a sure mark of a graceless state;)—or that <HI>no such change</HI> has ever as yet passed up∣on them!</P>
<P N="13">13. WHAT then must we necessarily conclude, con∣cerning the state of the generality of nominal Christians? —That they are not converted, nor born again of the Spirit; and consequently, that, in their present condi∣tion, they <HI>cannot</HI> enter into the kingdom of heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 5.</NOTE>!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The same Subject continued. <HI>The Motives to Conversion.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE conversion of a sinner gives joy in heaven. It gives pleasure to the heart of GOD, and of his <HI>dear Son;</HI> and <HI>every benevolent spirit</HI> of that upper world, partakes in the joy, that a co-heir is born to glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 11. Matth. xxiii. 37. Luke xix. 41, 42.—xv. 7, 10, 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="34" REF="014137_0033_0F97D46FF42C7DB8"/>
2. As far as it is known, it rejoiceth the heart of every good person upon earth. The whole church mi∣litant rejoice in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. To bring sinners to <HI>repentance</HI> and <HI>final happiness,</HI> is the chief design of all the manifestations of GOD to men, and of all his great and memorable transactions on earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. To effect this was the grand design of Christ's <HI>in∣carnation, ministry, miracles, labours, sufferings,</HI> ascension to glory, and pouring down the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, on his apostles and on the church.</P>
<P N="5">5. To accomplish the conversion of human sinners, the apostles of the Lamb <HI>laboured,</HI> and <HI>wrote,</HI> and <HI>travel∣led,</HI> and <HI>suffered,</HI> and <HI>died;</HI> and this is the grand business of all the labour and expence of a gospel ministry in the world.</P>
<P N="6">6. GOD'S merciful nature invites, allures, and en∣courages sinners to repentance and conversion. He hath no pleasure in the final misery of sinners, but that they should turn from their way and live.—<HI>This</HI> he <HI>so∣lemnly swears</HI> by his sacred life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</NOTE>. He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repen∣tance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii. 9.</NOTE>. He is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and of great compassion, pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiv. 6.</NOTE>. See this merciful disposition of GOD to re∣penting sinners, illustrated with an inexpressible beauty and energy, in the conduct of the <HI>father</HI> towards the <HI>re∣turning prodigal,</HI> Luke xv.</P>
<P N="7">7. GOD'S most gracious <HI>calls,</HI> and exceeding many great and precious <HI>promises,</HI> should have an irresistable force to induce us to conversion; especially when considered in conjunction with those riches of his goodness, and for∣bearance, and long-suffering patience, which sinners are despising and abusing, to the unspeakable aggravation of their own guilt and misery<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="35" REF="014137_0034_0F97D470B67F10A8"/>
8. THE gates of heaven are set open, and all the riches of its beauty and glory displayed before sinners, for this very purpose, that they might be allured by the prospect of celestial glory, to conversion and re∣pentance.</P>
<P N="9">9. WE are apt to think the descriptions given in scrip∣ture of hell and everlasting misery and torment, very disgusting; but the sole design of <HI>these representations</HI> is to alarm the fears of sinners by the prospect of this misery, that so they may be brought to a speedy and effectual conversion. <HI>Hell</HI> would never have been re∣vealed to sinners, had it not been, that knowing these ter∣rors of the Lord, they might be persuaded to repentance.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE <HI>safe</HI> and <HI>happy state</HI> which conversion puts us into, and the <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>glorious privileges</HI> which it confers upon us, even in this life, should be a powerful motive to our getting into this happy state: Pardon, peace and reconciliation with an offended GOD; deliverance from the indwelling power, curse and condemnation of sin, adoption, protection; an interest in GOD as our por∣tion, and the comfortable hope of his eternal enjoyment.</P>
<P N="11">11. GOD'S having brought down the terms of his great salvation so low, and made it such a possible, fea∣sible and practicable thing for sinners to be saved, will render them wholly inexcusable, if they continue un∣converted, and so come short of salvation. They are commanded and invited, by a solecism in language, to buy the great salvation without money or price, to come and drink of the water of life freely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lv. 1, 2. Rev. xxii. 17.</NOTE>; only to look unto Christ, from the ends of the earth, and be sav∣ed; to come unto him, to receive him, and to believe in him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlv. 22. John i. 12. Matth. ii. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">12. ALTHOUGH we cannot fulfil these reasonable and easy conditions of the new and gracious covenant, by any strength of our own, yet GOD hath promised, that
<PB N="36" REF="014137_0035_0F97D4717415F818"/>he will put his Spirit into us, and help us, and work in us both to will and to do the things that are pleasing to him, if we <HI>sincerely</HI> and <HI>importunately</HI> solicit this di∣vine agent by prayer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 9—14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="13">13. BUT the most <HI>cogent</HI> and <HI>necessitating</HI> motive of all is, That we either must <HI>be converted,</HI> or must <HI>perish eter∣nally!</HI> The scripture is <HI>clear, decisive,</HI> and <HI>peremptory</HI> in in this matter: so that we are under this <HI>dilemma;</HI> <Q>We must either <HI>turn</HI> or <HI>burn;</HI> either be <HI>converted</HI> to GOD, and born again of the Spirit, or take up our residence for ever with devils and damned spirits!</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. JUSTIFICATION: <HI>Or the method of a Sinner's being justified before</HI> GOD.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. JUSTIFICATION no where in scripture sig∣nifies a sinner's being <HI>made righteous;</HI> but it every where signifies his being <HI>esteemed, manifested,</HI> or <HI>pronounced</HI> righteous.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS word, although it has always this significati∣on, yet it has <HI>three</HI> different senses in the scriptures; either, <HI>first,</HI> it is taken for our <HI>present</HI> justification <HI>in the sight of</HI> GOD, our being <HI>pardoned,</HI> and accepted into a state of favour and friendship with him:—Or, <HI>secondly,</HI> for our justification <HI>before men,</HI> and <HI>our own consciences:</HI>—Or, <HI>third∣ly,</HI> for our <HI>public sentence of acquittance and approbation,</HI> on the day of judgment, in the presence of the assembled world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxii. 1, 2.

<P N="3"><PB N="37" REF="014137_0036_0F97D4723443D648"/>
3. JUSTIFICATION is a forensic or law-term, opposed to <HI>condemnation.</HI> Now condemnation never signifies the <HI>making of men guilty,</HI> but only <HI>pronouncing them so;</HI> in like manner, justification never signifies making men holy, but only declaring them to be such in the eye of the law.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are said to be justified by the imputation of Christ's righteousness: Now, to <HI>impute,</HI> is to esteem any character or quality to belong to a person as his.</P>
<P N="5">5. A THING may be imputed to a person, which was always his own: So <HI>sin</HI> is imputed to a sinner, when he is treated as an offender; in like manner, <HI>righteousness</HI> is justly imputed to a person, who has always obeyed the law.</P>
<P N="6">6. A THING, <HI>quality</HI> or <HI>character</HI> may also be imputed to a person, which was not <HI>always</HI> or <HI>originally</HI> his own, but is only esteemed to belong to him, in the eye of the law: Thus, a debt is imputed to the <HI>surety,</HI> and his payment of it is imputed to the <HI>debtor,</HI> and reckoned <HI>his act</HI> and <HI>deed.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THIS seems to be the proper notion of <HI>imputation</HI> in the present doctrine. Christ as our surety, has under∣taken to <HI>pay our debts,</HI> i. e. <HI>to atone for our sins.</HI> Our sins are, therefore, imputed to him, and accordingly he suf∣fers for them, as though they had been his own: And his righteousness is freely and graciously imputed to us, if we are indeed believers, so that we may plead it be∣fore GOD as <HI>our justifying righteousness:</HI> And <HI>therefore</HI> it is that GOD justifies and acquits us as righteous, even for the sake of his dear Son's righteousness, which we accept and plead by faith.</P>
<P N="8">8. As <HI>sinners</HI> we may be said to owe a <HI>double</HI> or <HI>twofold debt</HI> to GOD, which must be paid before we can be justi∣fied. We owe him <HI>perfect obedience</HI> to the law, through the whole of our lives; and <HI>this</HI> would indeed justify us, if we were innocent creatures, and did perfectly fulfil
<PB N="38" REF="014137_0037_0F97D4746F072B58"/>this condition of the first covenant: But being now <HI>sin∣ners,</HI> we owe the debt of <HI>eternal punishment,</HI> and the debt of <HI>perfect obedience</HI> also, (our obligations to which, as the creatures and subjects of GOD, can never be cancelled:) Now, we are equally unable to pay <HI>either</HI> of these debts. As the punishment which we owe is <HI>eternal,</HI> we must be <HI>ever</HI> paying it, and never shall have paid off the score. No moment shall arrive in the course of eternal durati∣on, when we shall be able to say, <HI>This debt is paid.</HI> And as to the <HI>other debt</HI> of <HI>perfect obedience,</HI> the payment of it becomes impossible to those who have <HI>once sinned;</HI> seeing that obedience can never be <HI>perfect,</HI> in which there is <HI>one failure</HI> or <HI>defect.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. SINNERS being therefore <HI>thus incapable</HI> and <HI>insolvent,</HI> Christ <HI>undertook for them</HI> as their <HI>surety;—first, by suffering,</HI> to pay the debt of punishment due for their sins; and <HI>secondly,</HI> by his <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>sinless obedience</HI> to the law of GOD, from his birth to his death, he hath wrought out for them a complete righteousness, answering every de∣mand of the law; and thus he is become THE LORD THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>. 6.—xxxiii. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE righteousness which is imputed to believers for their justification, is not the <HI>personal</HI> righteousness of Christ, as <HI>man;</HI> nor his <HI>essential</HI> righteousness, as GOD; but his <HI>suretiship</HI> righteousness, as GOD-<HI>man Mediator;</HI> and is the whole of his <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>sufferings,</HI> from his birth to his death, which he performed in the room and stead of believers.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imputation, therefore, is GOD'S graciously making over of this perfect suretiship righteousness of of Christ to believers, and his accepting their persons, on that account, as righteous.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>The Doctrine of Justification, through the imputed Righteousness of Christ, continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the doctrine of justification, by the righteous∣ness of Christ, we are not to apprehend GOD as mistaking our real characters, and esteeming us perfect∣ly righteous, when indeed we are not: On the contrary, he considers us as being just what we are, <HI>poor, sinful men,</HI> who have fulfilled the demands of his law, only by the obedience of our surety.</P>
<P N="2">2. NOR ought we to esteem ourselves the <HI>more righte∣ous</HI> or <HI>worthy,</HI> on account of our being thus justified, but as unworthy and hell-deserving as ever: Consequently, this doctrine is so far from ministring to spiritual pride, that, when rightly understood, it must tend greatly to humble the justified believer; seeing those who are <HI>thus justified,</HI> are still <HI>ungodly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE righteousness of Christ is imputed to none but <HI>true believers; i. e.</HI> such as have truly received Christ, and are united to him by faith: For, in thus receiving him, we receive his <HI>person, offices</HI> and <HI>benefits,</HI> and conse∣quently, <HI>his righteousness,</HI> which is one of those benefits, <HI>freely</HI> offered in the gospel to all who will accept it.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS righteousness is not imputed to a sinner be∣fore he has faith, nor is the imputation of it delayed till the fruits of faith appear; but the moment a sinner be∣lieves, it is imputed to him, and he is justified<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 24, 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. BUT that this doctrine may appear in a still more <HI>clear, convictive</HI> and <HI>unexceptionable</HI> point of light: (1.) It
<PB N="40" REF="014137_0039_0F97D47580C65D40"/>is evident, that man is naturally and necessarily under law to GOD; and this is equally true of all created be∣ings. (2.) Some kind of righteousness is absolutely ne∣cessary to man's justification. (3.) That righteousness which justifies man, must be such as answers to the per∣fection of that law under which man is. (4.) The law was at first given to man for <HI>two distinct</HI> ends; <HI>first,</HI> To signify GOD'S will, enjoined by his authority for the rule of man's duty; and, <HI>secondly,</HI> As a covenant between GOD and man, according to which, man was to expect life or death eternal, as he <HI>should</HI> or <HI>should not</HI> fulfil the terms of it. Now, this law, in the <HI>last</HI> sense of it, is abrogated by the bringing in of a <HI>better covenant;</HI> but in the <HI>first</HI> sense, the law, as a <HI>rule of duty, obliging to obedience,</HI> is of perpetual obligation. In <HI>this sense,</HI> Christ came to <HI>esta∣blish the law,</HI> and has incorporated it into his gospel, in its utmost purity, as the <HI>law of his kingdom,</HI> and the <HI>rule of his subjects.</HI> It is therefore a righteousness answerable to the demands of <HI>this law,</HI> which alone can justify us. But,</P>
<P N="5">(5.) WE can have no such righteousness of our own; nor can any creature provide such a righteousness for us: And it is expressly declared by the Apostle, <Q>That by the deeds of the law, no flesh living shall be justified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 3.—iii. 20, 28. Gal. ii. 16.—iii. 21.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="6">(6.) THE law, an obedience to which the Apostle ex∣cludes from having any share in our justification, is not merely the <HI>ceremonial law,</HI> as some have imagined, but the <HI>moral law</HI> also:—That law, by which is the <HI>know∣ledge of sin</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 20.—vii. 7.</NOTE>:—That law which was <HI>ordained to life</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 10.—x. 5.</NOTE>:— That law, by the breach of which the whole world was condemned, and from the curse of which Christ came to deliver us<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.

<P N="7">(7.) No such NEW LAW <HI>of gospel sincerity</HI> (taking in <HI>faith, repentance</HI> and <HI>sincere,</HI> though <HI>imperfect,</HI> obedience, as the ground of our justification under the <HI>new covenant,</HI> instead of perfect obedience under <HI>the old</HI>) has ever been given by GOD as the term of our pardon and acceptance: For, if we were justified before GOD by such a <HI>patchwork, im∣perfect</HI> righteousness as this, two absurdities would follow: —<HI>First,</HI> GOD must be supposed to abate in the demands of his law, in favour of our corruptions; and, if GOD could abate <HI>any thing</HI> of the perfection of his law, he might abate <HI>more;</HI> yea, he might cancel its obligations altogether. In that case, Christ lived and died in vain, who lived and died to <HI>establish</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> the law; and mankind might have been redeemed and saved without his <HI>atonement</HI> and <HI>mediation!—Secondly,</HI> We are then still under a <HI>covenant of works,</HI> and <HI>live</HI> by <HI>doing:</HI> For, let the work be <HI>perfect</HI> or <HI>imperfect,</HI> it will still be a <HI>covenant of works,</HI> so long as <HI>works</HI> are the <HI>condition of it!</HI>—Both of which are expressly contrary to the doctrine of the gospel.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) WE cannot possibly be justified by the <HI>works,</HI> or <HI>merit,</HI> or <HI>righteousness</HI> of any <HI>mere creature,</HI> however holy or dignified; none being able to pay more than that righteousness which he himself owes, as a creature, to the law of GOD: For creatures are obliged to employ all their powers, talents and faculties in the service of their Creator; and when they have done all that they are commanded, and all that they can, they have done on∣ly their duty; and therefore can, properly speaking, merit nothing for other creatures<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 9, 10.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The Doctrine of Justification continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE have already observed, that we have no righteousness of our own whereby we can be justified, so that if ever we are justified, it must be by the righteousness of <HI>another;</HI> and <HI>this other,</HI> as the scrip∣tures declare, is the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> who appeared up∣on earth to fulfil all righteousness; though he owed no such righteousness on his own account, as Mediator (this being an office which he voluntarily undertook, and to which he was by no means antecedently obliged): For this purpose also, he was <HI>made of a woman, made under the law; appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh; gave his life a ran∣som for many, and made his soul an offering for sin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 4. Phil. ii. 7, 8. Matth. xx. 28. Heb. ix. 28. Isa. liii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS it appears to me a matter of unspeakable impor∣tance that mankind should well understand this doc∣trine, so I take the liberty of entreating the readers of this little Essay, to bestow a close attention to the apho∣risms advanced in it, and to the scriptures in the margin, upon which these aphorisms are grounded.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST is expressly called the LORD OUR RIGH∣TEOUSNESS, and we are said to be justified by HIS RIGH∣TEOUSNESS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxiii. 6. Isa. xlv. 24.—liii. 11. Dan. ix. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS <HI>mediatorial</HI> or <HI>suretiship righteousness</HI> of Christ, is expressly said to be <HI>made over,</HI> or <HI>imputed</HI> to believing sinners for their justification<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 24.—v. 18,—21.—viii. 1,—4.—x. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST wrought out this righteousness for us, by
<PB N="43" REF="014137_0042_0F97D476B4F743E0"/>the appointment of GOD, in consequence of the cove∣nant of redemption<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zech. vi. 12, 13. 1 Pet. i. 19, 20. Prov. viii. 22,—31. Heb. x. 5,—10. Isa. xlii. 6.—xlix. 3,—9—l. 5,—10. —liii. 10. 2 Tim. i. 9. Tit. i. 2. Gal. i. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS righteousness was wrought out in the <HI>same nature</HI> which <HI>sinned</HI> and <HI>fell,</HI> and which <HI>stood in need of it:</HI> He assumed not the <HI>nature,</HI> nor undertook <HI>the cause</HI> of <HI>fallen angels,</HI> but of the <HI>fallen</HI> and <HI>lost seed of Adam,</HI> the pro∣genitor of human sinners. So that HE, by assuming <HI>our nature</HI> is become <HI>our kinsman,</HI> to redeem <HI>our lost inheri∣tance</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ruth. iv. 4,—15. Levit. xxv. 24.</NOTE>; and, it is remarkable, that GOD <HI>prepared him a body</HI> for this very purpose; which proves, that the design was originally from GOD, and that he is well-pleased for his righteousness sake<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 4. Heb. ii. 14. Psal. xl. 6. Rom. viii. 3.—v. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. NOTHING can be clearer and plainer from the whole current of scripture, than that what Christ <HI>did</HI> and <HI>suffered in our nature,</HI> as <HI>God-man Mediator,</HI> he <HI>did</HI> and <HI>suffered</HI> pro∣perly <HI>in our room</HI> and <HI>stead,</HI> and that both his <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>sufferings</HI> were properly <HI>vicarious,</HI> i. e. <HI>for us,</HI> and transfer∣able <HI>to us,</HI> upon our being enabled to comply with, and fulfil the conditions of the covenant of grace; <HI>i. e. be∣lieve</HI> in such a manner as to <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>return</HI> unto GOD, by a saving conversion<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Read and attentively consider Heb. ix. 26,—28. 1 Pet ii. 24. John i. 29. Eph. v. 2. Matth. xx. 28—xxvi. 28. 1 Tim. ii. 6. Gal. iii. 13, Rom. iii. 25. 2 Cor. v. 21.</NOTE>; and <HI>this alone</HI> can account for the greatness of our Lord's <HI>dejection, consternation, terror</HI> and <HI>agony</HI> in the last scenes of his passion.</P>
<P N="7">7. GOD the Father hath declared his acceptance of this righteousness for all the purposes for which it was intended, and in consequence of which, he is declared to be a <HI>just God,</HI> while a <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>justifier of sinners</HI> who believe in Jesus<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 26.</NOTE>. He is represented as delighting in
<PB N="44" REF="014137_0043_0F97D47777A24388"/>Christ, in the very prospect of his <HI>thus offering himself,</HI> and <HI>working out a righteousness</HI> for men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii. Isa. xlii. 1.

GOD'S <HI>acceptance</HI> and <HI>approbation</HI> of this righteousness, is also proved by his raising him from the prison of the grave, and receiving him into heaven<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 24. Rom. iv. 25.—viii. 34. Heb. xiii. 20. John xvi. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE way in which we become interested in this righteousness, is by <HI>faith,</HI> which will be the subject of the following Essay.</P>
<P N="9">9. AS this mediatorial righteousness of Christ is <HI>per∣fect</HI> and <HI>complete,</HI> so if it be imputed to a sinner for his justification, it must be every way sufficient for that pur∣pose. It is to the <HI>full satisfaction</HI> of all the parties concern∣ed: For, <HI>first,</HI> as Christ was perfectly holy in his nature, of infinite dignity in his person, and <HI>did</HI> and <HI>suffered</HI> all that the law required, so the demands of the law are ful∣ly satisfied, and the law itself <HI>more</HI> honoured than it could have been by the perfect obedience of innocent men or angels:—<HI>Secondly,</HI> GOD himself is <HI>perfectly satisfied,</HI> as the whole design was <HI>from him,</HI> and all his perfections do most illustriously shine out in this way of justifying a sin∣ner<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii. 23, 24. 1 John iv. 10. Acts ii. 23.</NOTE>: —It is a method pleasing to Christ: He <HI>freely</HI> offered himself; he <HI>gloriously revived</HI> from under his suf∣ferings, and is <HI>highly exalted</HI> and <HI>rewarded</HI> in consequence of them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Philip. ii. 6,—11.</NOTE>:—Nor surely, can the <HI>pardoned sinner</HI> himself have any thing to object against this method of his jus∣tification. He had no righteousness <HI>of his own,</HI> nor could the whole universe of created beings furnish him with any which could be available: In <HI>this forlorn</HI> and <HI>destitute condition,</HI> GOD pitied him and laid his help upon one
<PB N="45" REF="014137_0044_0F97D47834356EC8"/>mighty to save; and Christ wrought out a most perfect righteousness for his justification.</P>
<P N="10">10. AS it is undoubtedly true, that we cannot be jus∣tified by any <HI>inherent, personal righteousness</HI> of our own; so it is equally certain, that without <HI>such an inherent righte∣ousness,</HI> wrought <HI>in us</HI> by the regenerating, sanctifying Spirit, we can never enter into the kingdom of heaven. This is a doctrine of vast importance also, and which is evident from the whole current of scripture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. Heb. xii. 14, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. <HI>Holiness</HI> is that <HI>preparatory qualification,</HI> which is necessary in or∣der to our possessing the inheritance of GOD'S saints in glory,—in the same manner as <HI>faith</HI> is necessary in order to obtain an interest in the righteousness of Christ, for the sinner's justification. <HI>Faith</HI> puts us in a state of favour with GOD: <HI>Holiness</HI> qualifies us for his enjoyment. With∣out <HI>faith</HI> we cannot be <HI>justified:</HI> Without holiness we cannot be <HI>glorified.</HI></P>

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>ESSAY III. <HI>The</HI> NATURE <HI>of</HI> FAITH <HI>in general, and of</HI> JUSTIFYING FAITH <HI>in particular.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FAITH is properly an assent of the under∣standing to the truth of some testimony: It ought always to rest on <HI>sufficient evidence,</HI> and is either <HI>hu∣man</HI> or <HI>divine,</HI> according to the testimony which it re∣spects.</P>
<P N="2">2. HUMAN faith is an assent to the testimony of <HI>men,</HI> and admits of various degrees, from absolute disbelief, to a firm persuasion.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="46" REF="014137_0045_0F97D478F58A2D40"/>
3. THE firmest foundation of human faith, is, when a number of men, of good character and competent judges of the matter which they testify, perfectly agree in their testimony;—when they lay down their lives in confir∣mation of it, without any view of interest in propagat∣ing a falsehood;—and when numbers, who are declared enemies to their testimony, yet confess the principal matters of it. On this foundation stands our belief of the truth of Christianity, so far as it is a <HI>matter of fact,</HI> which recommends itself to our understandings by <HI>ex∣ternal evidence.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. DIVINE faith rests on the testimony of that GOD, who can neither <HI>be deceived himself</HI> nor <HI>deceive us;</HI> and therefore must be <HI>infallibly true.</HI> Wherefore, whenever we come to be assured that GOD hath <HI>revealed</HI> or <HI>declared</HI> any thing or doctrine, we are as certain of its truth, as that GOD liveth; however <HI>mysterious</HI> or <HI>incomprehensible</HI> the doctrine or matter revealed may appear to our <HI>limit∣ed, finite understandings.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. HUMAN testimony is, in its own nature, <HI>fallible,</HI> because it is the testimony of a creature, <HI>whose perfections are limited,</HI> and who may possibly be <HI>mistaken, deceived, lie</HI> or <HI>repent:</HI> Yet human testimony may, in some cases, be so circumstanced, as to give the <HI>highest degree</HI> of <HI>moral cer∣tainty.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. SAVING faith begins by receiving, and submitting to the <HI>whole testimony of</HI> GOD, recorded in scripture, as <HI>true, divine</HI> and <HI>infallible.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. IF it be true, that we ought to <HI>have reason</HI> to be∣lieve what we do believe; or, that we ought to believe <HI>only upon sufficient evidence,</HI> it will follow, that every be∣liever of Christianity should endeavour to be well ac∣quainted with the evidences of the truth of Christianity, both <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. THIS <HI>general faith</HI> of the <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>divinity</HI> of the ho∣ly scriptures, includes in it a <HI>particular faith</HI> of every <HI>par∣ticular
<PB N="47" REF="014137_0046_0F97D479B40AD0A0"/>truth, doctrine promise, law</HI> or <HI>threatning,</HI> contained in these scriptures. Consequently,</P>
<P N="9">9. WHEN we have once paid the <HI>obedience of faith</HI> to the whole word of GOD, and known by the contents of this revelation, <HI>our own guilty, miserable, helpless</HI> and <HI>perishing</HI> state by sin, and the glorious remedy provided in a Me∣diator and Redeemer;—his glorious dignity, power, grace, offices and suitableness to our wants and necessi∣ties, we then <HI>believe on him</HI> as the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD, and <HI>our Redeemer.</HI> This is <HI>justifying, saving</HI> faith; the faith requir∣ed by Christ and his apostles.</P>
<P N="10">10. DIVINES have distinguished faith, as it <HI>assents</HI> to <HI>truth,</HI> or <HI>receives and applies a promise:</HI> The former they call an <HI>act of the understanding;</HI> the latter, an <HI>act of the will:</HI> The former they call <HI>assent;</HI> the latter <HI>consent.</HI> But faith in the simple notion of it, seems to be only <Q>an act of the understanding, firmly assenting to saving truth.</Q> Yet,</P>
<P N="11">11. THE necessity of the <HI>consent of the will;</HI>—the act of <HI>trust</HI> or <HI>reliance,</HI> as it is called, or the <HI>application of the promise,</HI> is, by no means denied: But this I would rather consider as the <HI>fruit of faith,</HI> than as <HI>faith itself.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. DIVINES have distinguished and explained <HI>histo∣rical faith—temporary faith—faith of miracles—faith of devils,</HI> and the like; but as neither of these is the <HI>true gospel faith,</HI> to which the promises are annexed, the consideration of them is here omitted.</P>
<P N="13">13. TRUE and <HI>saving</HI> faith begins in the belief of GOD, his <HI>providence</HI> and his <HI>word,</HI> and terminates and fixes on <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>his righteousness,</HI> as the <HI>great, saving object</HI> therein exhibited.</P>
<P N="14">14. FAITH, in the principle of it, is the <HI>gift of</HI> GOD <HI>to us,</HI> and <HI>a grace wrought in us</HI> by his holy Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 8. Col. ii. 12. 2 Thes. i. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="15">15. FAITH does not <HI>justify</HI> and <HI>save us</HI> as it is an <HI>act of ours</HI> (for so, it is <HI>a work</HI> and has no merit for this pur∣pose;)
<PB N="48" REF="014137_0047_0F97D47A77546208"/>but only as it <HI>credits</HI> the testimony of GOD con∣cerning his Son Jesus Christ, so as to <HI>receive</HI> him in all his offices, according to the gospel offer of him;—to <HI>unite the soul to him</HI>—and to <HI>embrace, rely upon</HI> and <HI>plead</HI> his righteousness, which justifies.</P>
<P N="16">16. FAITH, disposing the soul to embrace Christ and his righteousness, this righteousness is graciously imputed by GOD to the believer for his <HI>justification,</HI> and the Spi∣rit, through Christ, is communicated to the believer for his sanctification;—so that Christ dwells in his heart <HI>by,</HI> or <HI>through</HI> faith; and Christ is made of GOD to the believer, both <HI>his righteousness</HI> and his <HI>strength.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. THAT faith which is the <HI>gift of</HI> GOD, ever <HI>purifies the heart, works by love,</HI> and is the fruitful principle of <HI>holy obedience.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. THE just <HI>live by faith.</HI> Their whole life is <HI>a life of faith on the Son of</HI> GOD, in which they daily lean and rely on him, and derive strength from him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. 1,—16.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IV.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of entering into</HI> COVENANT <HI>with</HI> GOD.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A COVENANT is a <HI>stipulation</HI> or <HI>agreement</HI> between <HI>two</HI> or <HI>more</HI> parties, wherein certain terms and condi∣tions are to be fulfilled, and certain benefits received upon their performance. But if any of the parties fail to perform their stipulations they become <HI>covenant-break∣ers;</HI> the other party is absolved from its obligation, and the covenant becomes <HI>void.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="49" REF="014137_0048_0F97D47B366F3DE0"/>
2. IN all covenants between men, there is a <HI>parity</HI> or some kind of <HI>equality</HI> between the parties contracting; and by reason of that natural liberty, which is the inviolable, unalienable privilege of every human creature, with re∣gard to his fellow-men, the <HI>contract, stipulation,</HI> or <HI>agree∣ment</HI> must be supposed to be <HI>free</HI> and with <HI>full consent,</HI> and the terms and conditions of the covenant, such as both parties shall mutually consent to. So that the most dig∣nified or powerful mortal, can have no right to force any conditions upon his fellow-men, or bind them to any duties, which they do not freely and voluntarily con∣sent to; only upon this proviso, that they have by some crime, <HI>forfeited their natural liberty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT is the most astonishing act of condescension, that ever GOD vouchsafed, to enter into covenant with man, as <HI>his creature,</HI> and much more, as his <HI>sinful, obnoxious creature.</HI> As his <HI>creature</HI> and <HI>natural subject,</HI> it was sufficient that GOD gave to man <HI>a law,</HI> with <HI>a penalty:</HI> As a <HI>sinful creature,</HI> and <HI>rebellious subject,</HI> man had no right to expect any thing else but punishment, without any covenant-privileges or mercies.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD, when he created man a moral agent, did, in the state of his innocence, enter into a covenant with him, the equitable terms of which were, <Q><HI>Do,</HI> and <HI>live;</HI>— <HI>transgress,</HI> and <HI>die.</HI></Q> Man had power to keep this co∣venant of life; but if he transgressed it, there was no provision made in the covenant of <HI>pardon</HI> for transgressors, or of <HI>new strength to obey.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. WHEN man had broke the first covenant, and for∣feited all title, not only to GOD'S <HI>covenant goodness,</HI> but even to mercy,—(wonderful <HI>grace!</HI>) GOD was pleased to enter again into covenant with man. And this last co∣venant is well termed a <HI>covenant of grace;</HI> because it is founded on the <HI>free, undeserved</HI> grace of GOD, and the merits of the Redeemer;—and because GOD'S grace and Spirit are stipulated in it, to enable man to rise from his fallen
<PB N="50" REF="014137_0049_0F97D47BF414E6A8"/>state, and to give him strength to fulfil the conditions of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. GOD being not only the <HI>Maker</HI> and rightful Lord of man, and infinitely <HI>holy, just</HI> and <HI>good;</HI> but fallen man having also forfeited his life,—GOD, I say, has a right to propose the covenant to man, and to fix the terms and conditions of it; and it is infinitely right that man enter∣ing into covenant with his Maker and Redeemer, should be willing to sign a <HI>charte blanche.</HI> Yet does not GOD force the will of man to consent to his gracious cove∣nant, but only proposes it to him; shews him the equi∣ty and advantage of his complying with it, and <HI>gently moves</HI> him to his duty and interest, by the motives of his gospel and attractions of his holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="7">7. GOD'S freely tendering this covenant to sinners of mankind, is a sufficient warrant and encouragement for our taking hold of it, and entering into covenant with him; which, without this warrant, would seem dreadful presumption in such <HI>creatures</HI> as we are.</P>
<P N="8">8. GOD'S part of the covenant is all a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>gracious promise</HI> of something which we <HI>do not,</HI> and <HI>cannot</HI> proper∣ly <HI>deserve</HI> or <HI>merit</HI> by any thing we can do;—and our part of it is <HI>all duty,</HI> which we were bound to perform antecedently to any covenant promise:—And even our <HI>ability</HI> to do this duty, and perform these conditions, on which we are entitled to covenant blessings, is promised and offered in the covenant itself. <Q>I will be their GOD, and they shall be my people.—I will give grace and glory, and no good thing will I withhold from them that walk uprightly.—I will take away the hard and stony heart, and will give them an heart of flesh.—I will write my law on their heart, and put my fear in their inward part—and I will be their GOD, and they shall be my people.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. THERE is something very singular in all these forms of GOD'S covenant, '<HI>I will,</HI> and <HI>they shall.</HI>' In
<PB N="51" REF="014137_0050_0F97D47CB423DEB0"/>all covenants between men, the parties fulfil their own conditions, independently on each other. But GOD not only <HI>proposes the covenant,</HI> but also <HI>gives strength</HI> and <HI>ability</HI> to fulfil the conditions on their part;—puts his Spirit into their hearts; writes his law in their inward part,— and often makes them a <HI>willing people in the day of his pow∣er.</HI> The very covenant itself <HI>offers</HI> and <HI>conveys grace</HI> and <HI>strength</HI> to fulfil it.</P>
<P N="10">10. ALTHOUGH we are not properly at liberty whether we shall chuse GOD as our covenant GOD, or enter into covenant with him, or not;—but are obliged both by <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>interest</HI> to do it, and to do it without hesitation or delay; yet our chusing him, and entering into covenant with him, must be a matter of <HI>cordial</HI> and <HI>deliberate choice.</HI> <Q>Chuse ye this day whom ye will serve. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of GOD, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to GOD, which is your reasonable ser∣vice.</Q> —GOD will have <HI>our heart;</HI> the approbation of our reason and the free and chearful consent of our mind in this matter,—that it may not be a <HI>constrained,</HI> but a <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> service. If he constrains any to be thus happy, it is by the constraints of his <HI>grace;</HI> making them a <HI>willing people</HI> in the day of his power.</P>
<P N="11">11. AS sinners, in a natural state, have neither a relish for the promises of GOD'S covenant, nor a heart and in∣clination to perform the conditions of it; hence it fol∣lows, that none but gracious persons <HI>can</HI> or <HI>will</HI> enter in∣to covenant with GOD; and that all who make a pre∣tence of doing it, without being previously disposed and inclined by GOD'S holy Spirit, are only <HI>hypocrites</HI> and <HI>self-deceivers.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. WHAT GOD, on his part, offers in this covenant, is <HI>himself,</HI> principally and comprehensively: <Q>I will be their GOD.</Q> And this includes <HI>all blessedness</HI> which any creature is capable of enjoying. When GOD pro∣mises
<PB N="52" REF="014137_0051_0F97D47D74175F78"/>to be a GOD to us, he promises to be a GOD <HI>all-sufficient</HI> to us, to be <HI>ours,</HI> in <HI>all his fulness,</HI> according to our measure and capacity: For, if having this GOD, we are <HI>straitened,</HI> it is not <HI>in him,</HI> (as the Apostle says) but <HI>in ourselves</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 12.</NOTE>; in the <HI>narrowness</HI> of our own capacities, not in his <HI>infinite fulness.</HI> He undertakes to <HI>be to-us,</HI> and to <HI>do for us,</HI> all that it belongs to him, as an infinitely <HI>wise, holy</HI> and <HI>good</HI> GOD, to <HI>be</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> to his covenant people.</P>
<P N="13">13. WE may see then that <HI>all good</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> is vir∣tually sum'd up in this covenant offer and promise; <Q>I will be your GOD.</Q> Accordingly, in other places of scripture, GOD, in condescension to human weakness, is more particular and explicit, in this covenant tender:— <Q>I will give grace and glory, and no good thing will I with-hold from my covenant people. All are yours. All things shall work together for good to them that are in covenant with GOD.</Q></P>
<P N="14">14. AS GOD proposes <HI>himself</HI> in all his fulness in this covenant, according to the <HI>measure</HI> and <HI>capacities</HI> of his creatures; so when he makes his demand from us, of what we, on our part, are to <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> in entering into covenant with him, he demands <HI>ourselves</HI> and <HI>our all, ab∣solutely</HI> and <HI>without reserve;</HI> that we surrender <HI>ourselves</HI> and <HI>ours;</HI> whatever we <HI>have, are,</HI> or <HI>can do,</HI> wholly up to his pleasure and disposal; to do <HI>with us, for us, in us,</HI> and <HI>by us,</HI> just what seemeth good unto him.</P>
<P N="15">15. AS submission to GOD'S <HI>will,</HI> and an unshaken trust and reliance on his <HI>power, goodness, veracity</HI> and <HI>faith∣fulness,</HI> are important conditions of this covenant, <HI>on our part;</HI> so, being assured of grace and glory, we are to leave <HI>all inferior goods,</HI> which relate meerly to our present state of existence, wholly and entirely to the <HI>will of God,</HI> endeavouring to subject our will, with regard to them, wholly to his, firmly believing, that every thing in our lot is appointed by infinite wisdom and goodness, and
<PB N="53" REF="014137_0052_0F97D47E34091350"/>being only concerned that all things may work together for GOD'S <HI>glory,</HI> and our <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>eternal happiness.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>The Same continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. MEN may be said to enter into covenant with GOD either <HI>indirectly</HI> or <HI>directly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE very sustaining of a profession of religion, or appearing not to deny, but rather to avow, that we are the people of GOD, carries in it an implicit acknowledg∣ment of a <HI>covenant transaction.</HI> The bulk of whole Chri∣stian nations appear to be thus in covenant with GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN every prayer to GOD, and acknowledgment of his authority over us, and right to dispose of us, there is the <HI>matter of a covenant</HI> with him; and though we may not intend, or directly avow any such thing, yet we do <HI>indirectly</HI> and <HI>implicitly</HI> give ourselves to GOD in cove∣nant, and bring ourselves under the penalty of the cove∣nant, if we do violate or break it.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE most solemn acts of directly and explicitly entering into covenant with GOD, are—a private sur∣render and self-dedication of ourselves to GOD:—The giving up of our children to GOD in baptism—and the renewing our baptismal covenant at the Lord's table.</P>
<P N="5">5. A PRIVATE and solemn surrender and dedication of ourselves to GOD, through the Redeemer, is one of the earliest duties we should perform in religion, after we have come to understand the nature of our baptismal vows, and the obligations we are under to GOD. Forms of this kind may be met with in many devotional books.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="54" REF="014137_0053_0F97D47EF5214D98"/>
6. THIS kind of covenanting should be performed in a very solemn and deliberate manner.</P>
<P N="7">7. SOMETHING of the same nature ought to be done by every communicant, both in his preparation for the Lord's supper, and at the ordinance itself; wherein an express recognition should be made, of all the principal and essential parts of our covenant with God, through the Redeemer.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE giving up of our children to GOD in baptism, is an occasion upon which we are called to an express cove∣nant surrender of ourselves, and all that is ours to GOD: We do, at that time, expressly acknowledge GOD to be <HI>our</HI> GOD, and offer him our children, in virtue of a co∣venant which is supposed to subsist between GOD and us: And the vows we make for our children, suppose our own vows of the same kind.</P>
<P N="9">9. Is it not surprising, that the same covenant which we renew with so much solemnity at the Lord's supper, is generally so superficially renewed at the baptism of the children of most Christians?</P>
<P N="10">10. IF a solemn preparation is necessary in order to the right renewing of our covenant with GOD at the gospel supper; is it less so before we give up our children to GOD in baptism? Is not <HI>equal solemnity, seriousness</HI> and <HI>devotion</HI> necessary on both occasions?</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY V. <HI>A</HI> FORM <HI>of renewing</HI> COVENANT <HI>with</HI> GOD, <HI>at the</HI> LORD'S TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>AS our great business in this ordinance is to call into lively and grateful remembrance, the painful and ignominious death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to
<PB N="55" REF="014137_0054_0F97D47FB4A94ED8"/>keep up this remembrance of it in the church and world: —As we are led to remember it not only as a <HI>confirma∣tion of the truth of his doctrines,</HI> but also as <HI>a sacrifice of atone∣ment</HI> for the sins of the world, and for our sins, and con∣sequently as the highest and dearest pledge of his and his Father's love to us, and the sweetest and surest ground of our hope, as believing sinners:—And as our principal business at this sacrament, (this feast upon a sacrifice) is solemnly to <HI>enter into,</HI> and <HI>renew our covenant with</HI> GOD, over these dear memorials of his Son's death—over these signs and seals of the blood of the everlasting covenant: —In which solemn transaction we do profess to take and avouch GOD, to be our GOD—and to become his people, according to the terms of the covenant. I have thought it might be exceeding proper and useful upon these occasions, to rehearse and repeat at large the form of a solemn covenant transaction, as it ought to be made, in substance, by every communicant, <HI>at</HI> or <HI>before</HI> this sacrament.</P>
<P>I SHALL therefore put this form of covenanting with GOD, in the <HI>first</HI> person of the <HI>singular</HI> number—that every one of us may, upon this occasion, use it <HI>for him∣self,</HI> and make it <HI>his own.</HI></P>
<P>LET me therefore beseech each of my fellow-com∣municants, as in the immediate presence of the GOD of heaven, and over the memorials of his Son's sacrifice— and as, on this solemn occasion, about to enter into and renew covenant with GOD, to let their hearts and thoughts go along with this form of a solemn covenant transaction, and cordially and deliberately to make it <HI>their own covenant;</HI>—each saying in his heart with me, and saying it <HI>sincerely</HI> and <HI>feelingly.</HI></P>
<P>"MOST great and adorable JEHOVAH! Behold! a poor, insignificant guilty worm of the dust, here prostrate before thee, as it were on the bended knees of my soul, acknowledging thy glorious majesty and divine perfec∣tions, thine eternal duration, infinity, self-sufficiency, all-sufficiency,
<PB N="56" REF="014137_0055_0F97D48197B99008"/>unchangeableness, and incomprehensibility —thine almighty power, all penetrating knowledge, un∣erring wisdom, unbounded goodness, unfailing faithful∣ness, impartial justice and undissembled truth.</P>
<P>"I DESIRE to rejoice (and O! that the whole world would rejoice!) that there is <HI>such a</HI> GOD, and that this GOD ruleth in the heaven and in the earth, and doeth according to his most sacred, sovereign, and holy will throughout the universe.</P>
<P>"LORD, I acknowledge with <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>joy,</HI> that I am thy <HI>creature,</HI> thy <HI>servant,</HI> thy <HI>subject,</HI> under infinite and un∣changeable obligations to <HI>know, serve, honour, fear, reve∣rence</HI> and <HI>obey</HI> thee; yea to <HI>be</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> just what thou pleasest. And I would for ever adore thee, that thou hast so closely connected <HI>my duty,</HI> with <HI>thine own glory,</HI> and <HI>my highest interest:</HI> That although my foundation is in the dust; all my original shame, and my nature sin— yet thou art giving encouragement to such a <HI>base, guilty wretch</HI> as <HI>I am</HI> and <HI>have been,</HI> to approach thee the <HI>eternal all,</HI> the fountain of all being, holiness and happiness through <HI>Jesus</HI> CHRIST, the eternal Son of thy love, with hopes of being pardoned, accepted and saved by his most pre∣cious merit and mediation! LORD, what am I? what is my <HI>original, lineage, descent</HI> and <HI>nature?</HI> what my <HI>conduct, merit</HI> and desert, that thou should'st once condescend to look down from the throne of thy majesty and holiness, upon such a creature as <HI>I have been,</HI> and <HI>still am:</HI>—That thou should'st once permit me to name thy <HI>venerable name</HI> with my guilty lips—much more, that thou should'st stoop to enter into covenant with me, or cause me to hope for any blessing from thee!</P>
<P>"VERRILY, O LORD, I <HI>blush,</HI> am <HI>ashamed</HI> and even <HI>con∣founded,</HI> at the very thoughts of this matchless grace and condescension!—And were it not that <HI>thou</HI> LORD, hast spoken it;—that <HI>it is thine own</HI> revealed, declared will, to regard such sinners through Christ, and that thou
<PB N="57" REF="014137_0056_0F97D481F44BD528"/>canst never <HI>change, lie</HI> nor <HI>repent,</HI> I should even now de∣spair of any mercy at thy hands:—For, I must confess in the presence of the all-seeing, heart-trying GOD, whom the closest hypocrisy cannot deceive, that I have been an <HI>unprofitable servant,</HI> a <HI>prodigal son,</HI> a <HI>wandering sheep,</HI> a <HI>barren fruitless tree,</HI> a cumberer of the ground, a <HI>vile ob∣stinate</HI> rebel, who, by ten thousand aggravated sins, have deserved the hottest hell!—How often hast thou called thy back-sliding creature, while I have refused?—How often hast thou stretched out thy gracious hand and merciful sceptre, while I have disregarded?—What <HI>commandment</HI> of thine have I not broken?—What <HI>talent</HI> or <HI>ordinance</HI> have I not misimproved?—What <HI>mercy</HI> have I not slighted?—What instance of thy grace and favour; what gift of thy providence, have I not turned into wantonness?—How far have I been from using this world so as not to abuse it?—How many duties have I neglected through <HI>sloth</HI> and <HI>vanity,</HI> and other <HI>base, low, unworthy</HI> motives?—How many sins have I com∣mitted against light, knowledge, and conscience of duty? —How many of my poor fellow-creatures (those im∣mortal souls, for whom Christ died!) have I tempted and drawn into sin, by evil example, wicked solicitati∣ons, and foolish, light, vain, unchristian behaviour?— And therefore have <HI>their</HI> guilt to answer for as well as <HI>my own!</HI>—How unwatchfully, uncircumspectly, and un∣like a child of light, and a disciple of Christ, I have walked, LORD, thou knowest?—How many <HI>foolish, idle words</HI> and <HI>vain, sinful jests</HI> have proceeded out of my mouth,—and how little of that which was good for the use of edifying, or that might minister grace to the hearers? How many of my poor fellow-creatures have I <HI>corrupted</HI> and <HI>defiled;</HI> but how few have I <HI>edified</HI> and <HI>pro∣fited?</HI> —How little have I watched over my <HI>heart,</HI> my <HI>thoughts,</HI> my <HI>lips,</HI> my <HI>passions,</HI> my <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>spirit?</HI>—How easily have I been provoked to <HI>anger,</HI> to <HI>revenge,</HI> to <HI>envy,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="014137_0057_0F97D482B4FF46A8"/>to <HI>slander,</HI> to <HI>rash</HI> and <HI>uncharitable judging,</HI> and to <HI>injurious</HI> and <HI>abusive language</HI> against my neighbours, yea, against my dear christian brethren, whom I should love in the LORD <HI>fervently</HI> and <HI>unfeignedly,</HI> and to whom I should do <HI>good</HI> and not <HI>evil,</HI> all the days of my life! How unthank∣ful, ungrateful, impatient, undutiful, unhumble have I been! How shamefully defective and wanting have I been, in all the relative and social duties of life, as a child, a parent, a neighbour, a friend, a husband, a wife, a subject, a Christian!—O, alas! How cold and stupid in prayer! How inconstant and indevout in my atten∣dance on holy ordinances and holy duties! How care∣less in reading thy holy word, and treasuring it up in my memory!</P>
<P>"O LORD, thou knowest these things altogether, and now they lie as a heavy burden upon my soul! Now I see their folly and their <HI>baseness;</HI> their <HI>guilt</HI> and their <HI>trea∣chery!</HI> And O! that I might see them clearer and clearer, until the sight might pain my very heart, and make my soul sink in humility, and overflow with the tears of sincere, unfeigned contrition and repentance! Behold, LORD, I am vile! What shall I answer before thee? I put my hand on my mouth, and my mouth as it were in the dust, and cry out <HI>unclean</HI> before thee. My sins against <HI>light</HI> and <HI>love;</HI> against <HI>mercies</HI> and <HI>corrections;</HI> against <HI>advices</HI> and <HI>reproofs;</HI> against <HI>vows, promises,</HI> resolutions and <HI>cove∣nant engagements;</HI> against GOD the <HI>Father,</HI> GOD the <HI>Son,</HI> and GOD the <HI>holy Ghost;</HI> against GOD, my neighbour and myself. My sins of omission and commission; of thought, word and deed; known and unknown; remem∣bred and forgotten; of childhood, youth, and manly age: —My sins against reason and conscience; against the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>gospel</HI>—are next to an infinite sum; they are far beyond my numbering; they are in number more than the hairs on my head, or than the sands on the sea-shore, which cannot be reckoned:—They have gone
<PB N="59" REF="014137_0058_0F97D48374443BD8"/>over my head;—they have ascended up even unto hea∣ven, and bear witness against me, crying for vengeance, like the blood of righteous <HI>Abel.</HI>—And whereas the very smallest of this number is sufficient to sink me into hell, and for ever to separate me from thy gracious presence, —yet, O LORD, they are all ever before thee and in the light of thy countenance, accompanied with every circumstance of their guilt and aggravation:—For there never has been a thought in my heart, a word in my mouth, or an action in my life, but thou, O LORD, know∣est it altogether. Although I have often studied to conceal and forget my sins, yet they are ever in the light of thy countenance, and recorded in the book of thine infinite knowledge and remembrance, as though they had been but just now committed!</P>
<P>"LORD, be thou therefore merciful unto me a <HI>sin∣ner;</HI> a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>guilty</HI> transgressor! <HI>Mercy, mercy,</HI> is my only suit; my only plea! <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>pardon</HI> through the blood of Christ, is <HI>all my hope</HI> and <HI>all my salvation!</HI></P>
<P>"O LET the King this day at his table grant me the forfeited life of my soul at my request, of <HI>mere undeserv∣ed mercy:</HI> For what profit is there in my blood, O thou GOD of salvation?</P>
<P>"I HAVE no righteousness of my own to plead, wherefore I should be <HI>pardoned, justified</HI> and <HI>accepted</HI> of thee to mercy! All my righteousnesses, even the whole sum of them taken together, are but <HI>filthy rags!</HI> They need pardon, but cannot deserve favour. I do, there∣fore, from my very heart, <HI>renounce</HI> and <HI>disclaim</HI> every kind and degree of <HI>trust</HI> and <HI>dependance</HI> on my <HI>prayers, tears, charities, repentances, good frames, holy duties,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> my other <HI>best works,</HI> for pardon and justification with thee, my GOD. Every duty which I have done since I was born, has been mixed with so much <HI>sin, infirmity</HI> and <HI>im∣perfection,</HI> that they are utterly unworthy to be accepted and rewarded by a holy GOD; unless it be through the
<PB N="60" REF="014137_0059_0F97D484343A9B00"/>merit, and for the sake of Jesus CHRIST. I there∣fore put my whole trust in CHRIST the Mediator, as my <HI>surety</HI> and <HI>atoning sacrifice;</HI> as my <HI>wisdom, righte∣ousness, sanctification</HI> and <HI>redemption;</HI> as my Lord and Re∣deemer; my Prophet, Priest and King; for <HI>pardon, sal∣vation</HI> and <HI>glory:</HI> For I know of no other name given un∣der heaven, whereby I can be saved.</P>
<P>"I BLESS thee, O LORD of heaven and earth, that thou art well pleased with sinners, in him the Son of thy love;—that, in him, thou art reconciling a guilty world unto thyself, not imputing their trespasses to them;—that through him sinners have access unto thee the Father;—that thou hast exalted him by thy right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give <HI>repen∣tance and remission of sins;</HI>—that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life;—that through his blood we have remission, even the full for∣giveness of all sin; that whosoever cometh unto him by faith, he will in no wise cast out,—and that I, even I, have liberty to enter into an everlasting covenant with thee, through him, who is the <HI>way,</HI> the <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>life;</HI> the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>living way</HI> unto thee the Father.</P>
<P>"BEHOLD, therefore, with an eye of compassion thy <HI>returning prodigal,</HI> thy <HI>lost sheep,</HI> desiring to come un∣to thee <HI>in this way,</HI> which thou thyself hast appointed. I desire to <HI>come,</HI> LORD draw me by thy holy Spirit! I desire to <HI>believe,</HI> LORD help thou mine unbelief! I de∣sire to come <HI>weary</HI> and <HI>heavy-laden</HI> under the burden of my sins; Lord increase a sense of their insupportable weight, and give me <HI>that rest,</HI> which thou hast graciously promised! I desire to surrender my soul and body to thee, with all their powers and faculties—all that I <HI>am, have,</HI> and <HI>can do,</HI> sensible of thy right to them by crea∣tion, preservation and redemption; and sorry, heartily sorry, that I ever strayed from thee in any instance, or ever served satan or my own lusts. LORD, do thou gra∣ciously accept the surrender through CHRIST, and make
<PB N="61" REF="014137_0060_0F97D484F3F9B9A0"/>me in all things, just what thou would'st have me to be. Make me <HI>worthy of thee</HI> and <HI>fit for thy enjoyment.</HI></P>
<P>"I CALL heaven and earth, thyself, thy holy angels, and my fellow-communicants, to witness <HI>this day,</HI> that <HI>here,</HI> over the memorials of thy Son's sacrifice, I do <HI>take</HI> and <HI>avouch</HI> thee, O thou eternal GOD, to be my cove∣nant GOD, and my heavenly Father through Christ.— O save thy creature, thy servant, thy subject, thine un∣worthy child, who putteth his trust in thee, and chuseth thee as his chief good and everlasting portion! O lift upon me the light of thy countenance; be reconciled un∣to me through Christ; manifest thyself unto me, so as thou dost not unto the world: Let all thy divine per∣fections be engaged for my protection, support, com∣fort and direction, through the straits and difficulties, the dangers and temptations of this wicked world; through the dark valley of the shadow of death, and in∣to thy blissful and happifying presence, in the world of spirits above. Let no evil spirit, or evil lust, be ever permitted to pluck me out of thy gracious hands; but lead me by thy counsel here, and afterwards receive me to glory. And now, O GOD, that I am <HI>thine</HI> by this <HI>express self-dedication,</HI> employ me wholly in thy service, and use me as an instrument of thy glory. Make me faithful unto the death, and give me a crown of life. Not <HI>my will</HI> but <HI>thy will</HI> be done, both by me, in me, and concerning me. I trust thy wisdom and mercy with my temporal and eternal <HI>all,</HI> and only desire a will to submit and resign to thee in all things, and to ac∣quiesce in all thy dealings and dispensations, as knowing them to be infinitely the <HI>wisest</HI> and the <HI>best.</HI></P>
<P>"I CALL heaven and earth to witness <HI>this day,</HI> over these solemn pledges of redeeming love, that I do take the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the second person of the bles∣sed Trinity, to be my LORD and <HI>Saviour;</HI> my <HI>head</HI> and <HI>husband;</HI> my <HI>surety, propiciation</HI> and <HI>advocate;</HI> my <HI>prophet,

I desire to commit and betrust my guilty, precious, perishing soul, with all its everlasting concerns, into thy <HI>faithful, powerful, com∣passionate</HI> hands; and would desire above all things, a far∣ther and more experimental knowledge of thy <HI>power</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> whom I thus trust with mine eternal all, that so my faith and hope may be yet stronger, and my doubts and fears fewer in number and of less strength. Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!—I know that the Father hath committed <HI>all power</HI> to thee; hath made thee head over all things for the good of the church; hath constituted thee a Prince and a Saviour, to give re∣pentance and remission of sins:—I also <HI>know</HI> and <HI>believe,</HI> that thou thyself art the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>-sufficient</HI> GOD; and, as Me∣diator, art <HI>perfect</HI> GOD and <HI>perfect man,</HI> and therefore art every way qualified to be a Saviour for lost and undone sinners:—And as thou art <HI>perfectly qualified,</HI> so thou hast often declared thy <HI>great willingness</HI> to <HI>seek</HI> and to <HI>save</HI> those that are lost.—LORD, save <HI>me,</HI> thy <HI>lost sheep.</HI>—Save me from my sins which are many, and from thy fearful divine judgments which they have deserved; for thou, LORD, art mighty and able to save unto the uttermost, all sinners that come unto GOD by thee.—I <HI>take</HI> and <HI>avouch</HI> thee for my <HI>prophet:</HI> O reveal thy word in my heart—write thy law there—put thy fear there, and give me the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of thyself, and of thy Father.</P>
<P>"I TAKE thee for my <HI>priest:</HI>—O plead the everlast∣ing merit and efficacy of thy sacrifice and of thy blood with the Father, on my behalf, who have no merit of my own.—O thou beloved <HI>Son of</HI> GOD, thou <HI>Lamb of</HI> GOD who takest away the sin of the world, whom the Father always heareth, and who never prayest in vain—intercede for me with thy Father, that my sins may be pardoned
<PB N="63" REF="014137_0062_0F97D48675183D48"/>for the sake of what thou hast done and suffered, and that I may be clothed with thy most perfect and spotless righteousness. I would receive thee this day, O thou <HI>bleeding Lamb of</HI> GOD, into a <HI>broken</HI> and <HI>bleeding</HI> heart;— a heart pierced with sorrow for my sins, and flaming with gratitude for the precious fruits of thy dying love.</P>
<P>"I TAKE and <HI>avouch</HI> thee this day, O blessed Jesus, for my <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Lawgiver:</HI> LORD, take the possession and dominion of my heart;—rule supreme there;—cast out all thine enemies, my lusts, my evil and ungoverned thoughts and passions;—bring my will and every affec∣tion under the authority and direction of thy laws and the Spirit.</P>
<P>"I TAKE thee, O blessed Jesus, this day, for my <HI>head</HI> and <HI>husband:</HI>—O make me a living member of thy mystical body.—May I daily and hourly derive strength, vigour, spiritual nourishment and growth in grace from thee, the living head of divine influences.—Let this be the day of my spiritual espousals.—Betroth me unto thy self:—Adorn me with the wedding garment of thy righteousness:—Let me, with the king's daughter, be all glorious within; clothed with the garment of holi∣ness, even that white raiment of needle work, which is the righteousness of the saints, that my soul may be as a bride adorned to meet her husband:—Take me into thy banqueting house, and let thy banner over me be love.— <Q>Awake, O north wind; come thou south, and blow upon my garden, that the odorous spices of divine grace may flow forth; and then let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

"I DO this day, take thee, O blessed Jesus, for my <HI>elder brother</HI> and <HI>forerunner,</HI> who hast taken possession of the promised inheritance, in the name of all thy fol∣lowers: —O do thou prepare a place, even one of the lowest and humblest mansions in thy Father's house for me; that I may be for ever with thee, to see thy glory, and be a humble and thankful partaker of thy happi∣ness.</P>
<P>"I AVOUCH thee, this day, for mine <HI>almighty</HI> and <HI>everlasting friend;</HI>—as a friend who art here giving me an amazing and astonishing proof, both of the reality and greatness of thy friendship, in these memorials of thy <HI>bitter passion,</HI> and <HI>bleeding, dying love:</HI> O do thou en∣kindle in my heart suitable returns of love and friend∣ship.

<P>"I DO call heaven and earth, and all my christian brethren to witness this day, over these dear and solemn pledges of redeeming love, that I do take the HOLY GHOST, the third person of the ever∣blessed Trinity, to be my <HI>sanctifier,</HI> my <HI>enlightener,</HI> my <HI>renewer,</HI> my <HI>guide</HI> and <HI>comforter;</HI> praising GOD for the inestimable gift of his holy Spirit: O thou <HI>heavenly dove,</HI> do thou descend upon my soul, as a <HI>fuller's soap</HI> and <HI>refiner's fire:</HI>—Descend, bearing the olive branch of peace, love, joy and comfort.

I wait, O LORD, for thy salvation! I crave not great things in this world. Order all things relating to my body and temporal concerns, just as thy wisdom and goodness will judge most meet for me; only let my soul be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>"AND as, after I have renewed this my covenant at thy table, I am again to go forth into a <HI>sinful, deluding</HI> world, where I shall be surrounded with fresh tempta∣tions: —O let me ever bear this solemn covenant trans∣action in my mind, that I may not prove treacherous to my <HI>dearest</HI> LORD;—that I may not add the guilt of perjury to that of unfaithfulness. O! let me ever bear about with me such a sense of the dying love of my dear Redeemer, as may engage me to the most chear∣ful and universal obedience to his laws.—Let me never prove a scandal and disgrace to the Christian name, by apostacy, or infidelity;—and to thy name shall be the praise and glory, through eternal ages.

<HEAD>ESSAY VI. <HI>The</HI> NATURE, DESIGN, <HI>and</HI> USE <HI>of the</HI> LORD'S SUPPER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SACRAMENTS are solemn ordinances insti∣tuted by Christ, <HI>representing, sealing</HI> and <HI>applying</HI> Christ, and his purchased benefits to the souls of belie∣vers.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE are <HI>two</HI> such in the New Testament, <HI>viz. baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's supper,</HI> answering to <HI>circumcision</HI> and the <HI>pascal lamb</HI> in the Old Testament dispensation of the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="3">3. THESE sacraments are institutions of a positive, and not of a moral nature; deriving all their worth from the authority which enjoins them, and as binding upon us as any moral duties whatever.</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE gospel sacraments are not burthensome, expensive and laborious; but cheap and easy, and yet of useful significancy.</P>
<P N="5">5. BAPTISM fitly represents our need of being <HI>washed by the blood,</HI> and <HI>sanctified by the Spirit</HI> of Christ, which are both emblematically set forth by the cleansing, purify∣ing nature of the element of water made use of in that ordinance; and it is to be <HI>but once</HI> administred as an <HI>ini∣tiatory ordinance,</HI> on our first entering into the church of Christ.</P>
<P N="6">6. AS, in baptism, we take upon us the profession of Christianity, and submit to the whole religion of Christ, we do virtually oblige ourselves in this ordinance, to re∣ceive the Lord's supper.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE Lord's supper obliges us to the same duties as baptism, and no more, nor any other: Both are <HI>signs</HI> and <HI>seals</HI> of <HI>the same covenant.</HI> The specific difference seems to lie here: Baptism is but <HI>once</HI> administred as an
<PB N="67" REF="014137_0066_0F97D489823DE210"/>initiatory ordinance;—the Lord's supper often, as a strengthening and nourishing ordinance: Baptism has a more special reference to the <HI>religion of Christ:</HI>—The Lord's supper, to CHRIST, the author and founder of it. How falsely then do many baptized Christians imagine themselves under <HI>fewer obligations</HI> to holiness, than <HI>com∣municants?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <Q>THE Lord's supper is a sacrament, wherein, by giving and receiving bread and wine, according to Christ's appointment, his death is shewed forth; and the worthy receivers are (not after a corporal and car∣nal manner, but by faith) made partakers of his body and blood, with all his benefits, to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Assembly's shorter Catechism.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. THIS sacrament is enjoined on all Christians, as a pledge of their duty, obedience and allegiance to Christ, the glorious captain of salvation; and to keep up in their hearts a grateful remembrance of his dying love.</P>
<P N="10">10. IT was instituted by Christ, just before his death, after he had eat his last passover; is enjoined upon his followers by his dying command, and is to be continu∣ed by them to the end of the world.</P>
<P N="11">11. THE <HI>specific nature</HI> and <HI>proper notion</HI> of this ordi∣nance, is, <Q>A memorial of Christ's sacrifice; or a keep∣ing up the fresh remembrance of his death in the church, together with the cause, design and benefits of it; all which benefits are sealed and applied to be∣lievers in receiving it:</Q> <HI>This do in</HI> REMEMBRANCE <HI>of me, and as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do</HI> SHEW FORTH <HI>the Lord's death,</HI> 'TILL HE COME<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 23,—29. Luke xxii. 19, 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">12. BOTH the sacraments are standing evidences of our
<PB N="68" REF="014137_0067_0F97D48A33F37810"/><HI>guilty, polluted</HI> state by sin, and of the hope we have of pardon and cleansing through Christ.</P>
<P N="13">13. IN preparing to receive, and in actually receiving the Lord's supper, we are led to consider the death of Christ, on which it is founded, in the following impor∣tant and interesting views—In contradistinction to Jews, we are led to consider the cross of Christ as <HI>his</HI> and <HI>our</HI> glory;—we are led to consider his death as that of a <HI>martyr</HI> or <HI>witness,</HI> to the truth of the doctrines which he taught, and as that of our example living and dying;— and also as <HI>a sacrifice,</HI> by which the sin of man was expi∣ated: And this sacrament we are led to consider, as a <HI>feast upon a sacrifice;</HI> from which view of it, many im∣portant considerations arise,—as, (1.) It naturally re∣minds us of the evil and accursed nature of sin, which needed such an expensive sacrifice.—(2.) Of the incom∣prehensible love of GOD, who furnished such a sacrifice for the expiation of human guilt.—(3.) As those who <HI>feasted upon a sacrifice,</HI> were supposed to be in a state of fa∣vour with the Deity to whom the sacrifice had been of∣fered, and to be in perfect friendship one with another; so thus feasting on the sacrifice of Christ, denotes our fel∣lowship and communion with the Father and the Son, and that we are united together in the strictest bonds of Christian charity and love.—(4.) This sacrament being a <HI>feast upon a sacrifice,</HI> we ought to consider it as a proper form of renewing covenant with GOD, and a sign and means of our participating in the blessings of this cove∣nant. —(5.) This sacrament represents the death of Christ as that of a conqueror, who conquered in dying, and who, by his resurrection, has secured victory for all his followers.—(6.) His death, as represented in this sacrament, should be considered as the ground of his ex∣altation, and of that extensive dominion and power which he now holds in the heavenly world, for the good of his church:—And, (7.) While we here contemplate
<PB N="69" REF="014137_0068_0F97D48AF4A2B370"/>his death, our thoughts should spring upward to his glo∣rified state, and forward, to his second, triumphant ap∣pearance, when we shall have reason to glory in a once crucified master.</P>
<P N="14">14. THE chief <HI>use</HI> and <HI>design</HI> of this sacrament, is to <HI>perpetuate,</HI> and, as it were, to <HI>eternize</HI> the memory of the love of GOD and of Christ to us; to actuate, enkindle and enflame our love and gratitude to them; to bring frequently into our remembrance the most powerful motives to universal holiness, and to unite the hearts of Christians in the firmest and most endearing bonds of love.</P>
<P N="15">15. NONE seem to have a right to this ordinance, in the sight of GOD, but the <HI>true disciples of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. NONE have a right to it, in the sight of men, but such as appear, in a judgment of charity, to be <HI>real Chri∣stians.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. NONE therefore should be admitted to it, with∣out a due, previous examination of their Christian know∣ledge, and some evidence of their sincerity in religion.</P>
<P N="18">18. THOSE who have been admitted upon mistaken notions of their sincerity, may be again excluded, when the church receives proof of such mistakes.</P>
<P N="19">19. NO person ought to approach this ordinance, without <HI>actual</HI> preparation for it: Though, if they are <HI>ha∣bitually</HI> serious, their actual preparation, (when unex∣pected opportunities of communicating offer them∣selves) need cost them but little time or trouble; and, it is a childish and a dangerous superstition, to imagine, that any certain time, or any certain number of devo∣tions, are absolutely necessary in order to our acceptance in this ordinance.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VII. <HI>That</HI> HABITUAL <HI>and</HI> ACTUAL PREPARATION <HI>which is necessary for worthily receiving the</HI> LORD'S SUPPER, <HI>more fully considered.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. DIVINES sometimes distinguish our prepara∣tion for the sacrament of the supper, into <HI>ha∣bitual</HI> and <HI>actual.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HABITUAL preparation seems to imply two things; <HI>first,</HI> A <HI>gracious state;</HI> and <HI>secondly,</HI> A <HI>regular, pious, cir∣cumspect life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT seems evident from the very nature and de∣sign of this ordinance, that it belongs only to <HI>true disci∣ples</HI> and <HI>real Christians.</HI> It is a nourishing ordinance; but such only can be nourished as have <HI>life:</HI> Besides, the graces of faith, love, hope, &amp;c. which are properly exercised in this ordinance, can only be exercised by <HI>real, living</HI> Christians. It is a solemn renewal of our co∣venant with GOD; but how can those renew a covenant, which they never entered into at all? How can such as are in league with the devil and their lusts, be said to enter into covenant with GOD? What sincerity can there be in such a transaction as this? Does it not im∣ply the most insolent, bare-fac'd mockery?</P>
<P N="4">4. IT implies also a <HI>regular, pious, circumspect</HI> life, such as becometh the gospel of Christ: That a man's life cor∣respond in some measure with his profession, and the truth and sincerity of his religion appear visible, in the genuine and examplary fruits of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. THOSE who have <HI>this habitual preparation of soul</HI> for holy ordinances, need be under no scruple of approach∣ing the Lord's table upon the shortest warning; be∣cause, having the essentials of religion, and a habitual
<PB N="71" REF="014137_0070_0F97D48DBAAFC9D8"/>seriousness and sobriety of spirit, their sincere endeavours to please GOD in the way of commanded duty, can ne∣ver be unacceptable to him, nor unavailable to them∣selves. It would, therefore, be sinful in such to abstain from a sealing ordinance, meerly because they have not had much time to make a formal, actual preparation; because, having already those good dispositions which such a preparation is intended to beget, such a prepara∣tion is not absolutely necessary; and not to dispense with it, in such circumstances, would be superstition, not religion.</P>
<P N="6">6. YET where time and opportunity permit, the very best men should by no means neglect a careful, actual preparation of soul for attending so solemn an ordinance. For (1.) It is expressly commanded: <HI>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 28.</NOTE>. (2.) The business to be transacted at the Lord's table is of a very solemn nature: It is no less than en∣tering into, or renewing covenant with the great GOD, over the memorials of his Son's sacrifice:—And who∣ever considers what kind of creatures we are; the nature, terms and conditions of the covenant, and how solemnly, and circumspectly every part of it should be transacted, and that this is the principal business of an actual preparation (which should by no means be ne∣glected 'till we come to the Lord's table) will surely see reason for some time and care in this business, when we can command it. (3.) The very best men are not al∣ways in a proper frame of mind, for the most common and ordinary duties of religion: Good men find it ne∣cessary to take some pains with their hearts for the right performance of the duties of <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>hearing the word,</HI> and surely proportionably more care should be taken in preparing for the sacrament of the supper.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="72" REF="014137_0071_0F97D48DF43A1630"/>
7. ACTUAL preparation consists in a careful endea∣vour, to put the heart and affections in the best frame and posture possible for approaching GOD in this holy ordinance; and is expressed in scripture, under the ge∣neral notion of self-examination: <HI>Let a man examine him∣self,</HI> and <HI>so let him eat,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE things concerning which we ought principal∣ly to examine ourselves, are our <HI>knowledge, faith, love</HI> or <HI>charity, repentance,</HI> and <HI>new obedience.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. A KNOWLEDGE of <HI>ourselves,</HI> our <HI>sins, wants, weak∣ness, guilt</HI> and <HI>danger;</HI>—a competent knowledge of GOD, his perfections and laws, the obligations we are under to him, and the duties we owe him;—a knowledge of the Saviour, and the way of salvation by the new cove∣nant; —and a competent knowledge of the sacrament of the supper, the graces there to be exercised, and the duties there to be performed, is indispensably necessary, in order to our rightly and worthily partaking of the Lord's supper; lest, <HI>not discerning the Lord's body, we eat and drink judgment to ourselves</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">10. FAITH in Christ, as the <HI>Son,</HI> and <HI>sent</HI> of GOD; and in his power and grace as an all-sufficient and most willing Saviour, is a grace, the exercise of which is of absolute necessity in this ordinance; and as there is no receiving or applying of Christ, without this grace, it is necessary we should examine ourselves concerning the reality of it, before we approach this ordinance, lest we should be found <HI>mockers of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="11">11. As the <HI>eucharist</HI> or <HI>sacrament of the supper,</HI> is founded on the inconceivable love of GOD and Christ, to a lost world, and is intended as a badge, sign, means and cement of love and unity among Christian brethren, —love to GOD and <HI>man,</HI> is a grace of absolute necessity in all worthy communicants; and therefore, the truth and
<PB N="73" REF="014137_0072_0F97D48EB51D1F48"/>reality of it in our hearts should be carefully examined into, before we venture to approach this gospel banquet: For, to approach this <HI>love-feast</HI> without <HI>supreme love</HI> to GOD, and <HI>cordial affections</HI> for <HI>our fellow-Christians,</HI> or while the contrary temper prevails in the soul, would be the vilest abuse.</P>
<P N="12">12. WE have already observed, that impenitent sinners, or those who live allowedly in the course or practice of any one known sin, have no right to this ordinance; and this may shew the necessity of examining ourselves of the truth and reality of our <HI>repentance,</HI> in order to our ap∣proaching this sacrament worthily.</P>
<P N="13">13. WE can by no means have a satisfying evidence of the truth of our <HI>faith, love,</HI> or <HI>repentance,</HI> unless we are conscious, that our lives are bettered and reformed, and that we have been enabled, at least for some while past, to pay a <HI>new obedience</HI> to the divine laws: For, the only satisfying proof we can have of the <HI>truth of our graces,</HI> is the <HI>fruit of holiness</HI> which they produce in our lives and conversations; and so from the goodness of the fruit, we rationally infer the goodness of the tree. It is high∣ly convenient therefore, for all who design to approach the sacrament, to try their sincerity in religion by this <HI>touchstone,;</HI> and not rashly to believe, that they are pos∣sessed of the sacramental graces and qualifications, 'till they feel the energy of them warm at their hearts, and experience the fruits of them, in some degree of holiness of life.</P>
<P N="14">14. NOT only must worthy communicants have these graces <HI>in reality;</HI> but the principal design of <HI>actual preparation</HI> is to bring them into <HI>lively exercise,</HI> by prayer, meditation, self-examination, reading the scriptures, and other proper devotional books. By frequent meditations on the heinousness of sin; the dignity, sufferings, shame and death of Christ, who was the atoning sacrifice for sin; the wonderful love of GOD in providing such a sa∣crifice,
<PB N="74" REF="014137_0073_0F97D48F744D7B08"/>and freely delivering him up for us all; the in∣valuable benefits and blessings procured for penitent believers by this sacrifice:—By frequent meditations of this kind, the <HI>faith</HI> of communicants should be increased and strengthened; their <HI>love</HI> inflamed; their sorrow for sin, indignation against it, and repentance of it perfect∣ed, and their resolutions to holy obedience invigorated: So that when they actually approach the Lord's table, these graces may not move heavily and aukwardly for want of use, as though the chariot wheels of the soul were taken off; but in a brisk, lively, active and vigo∣rous manner, like the <HI>chariots of Aminadab;</HI> each acting in its proper sphere, and all of them harmoniously and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n concert, lifting up the soul towards heaven.</P>
<P N="15">15. HENCE may be drawn a powerful argument for the <HI>frequent</HI> receiving of the Lord's supper: For, if the right receiving of the Lord's supper requires the vigo∣rous exercise of all the noblest graces of the Christian religion;—if it is indeed an <HI>epitome</HI> or <HI>summary</HI> of the whole of practical Christianity;—if it be necessary for those who would worthily receive this ordinance, to me∣ditate on the <HI>chief, vital</HI> doctrines of our holy religion, and to exercise its noblest graces, by the way of prepa∣ration for this duty.—It may hence be inferred, that the <HI>oftener</HI> we receive this sacrament aright, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>more fre∣quently</HI> our souls are employed in those divine prepara∣tory exercises, the more rapidly must they grow in knowledge and in grace, and be fitted for every good word and work.</P>
<P N="16">16. SINCE all the benefit to be reaped from holy or∣dinances, is only to be expected by a <HI>proper preparation</HI> for them, and a due <HI>attendance</HI> on them, it is not at all to be wondered at, that the souls of those who receive the sacrament, without due preparation, do decay and go backwards in religion: For, to trisle with holy things, betrays such an irreverence and atheism of heart, as
<PB N="75" REF="014137_0074_0F97D490350BF4C0"/>must needs, in time provoke GOD wholly to withdraw his good Spirit from such triflers, and leave them total∣ly under the power of <HI>blindness of mind</HI> and <HI>hardness of heart.</HI> Hence it often happens, in fact, that <HI>careless, untender</HI> and <HI>uncircumspect</HI> professors of religion, turn out, in the end, <HI>tenfold more reprobate, profligate</HI> and <HI>abandoned,</HI> than other sinners, who have never thus profaned and abused the sacraments.</P>

<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>ESSAY VIII. <HI>Our proper</HI> DUTY <HI>immediately after receiving the</HI> LORD'S SUPPER, <HI>and that Course of Life, in Consequence of it, by which we may most effectually Honour our</HI> CHRISTIAN <HI>Profession.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE should retire as soon as possible to examine ourselves, of our frames and exercises of mind at this holy ordinance.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF we find that we have had lively exercises of the sacramental graces, we should humbly and heartily thank GOD for the aids of his Spirit, and importunately beseech him to continue these gracious frames, and pre∣serve us from forfeiting them by fresh acts of sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we find that our frames and affections have been dull, dead, or trifling, we ought attentively to consider from whence this may have proceeded. If we are conscious that we have been at due pains to pre∣pare our hearts, and that we have indulged no wilful sin; and if we find that our dullness and coldness was matter of grief to us at the ordinance, we ought not to be over much dejected, but hope that it may have pro∣ceeded
<PB N="76" REF="014137_0075_0F97D490F5700DC0"/>from bodily indisposition, and that we may have nevertheless been accepted. We should also beseech GOD to vouchsafe those comforts now, which were with∣held from us at his table, and that he would enable us perseveringly to seek them. But,</P>
<P N="4">4. IF we find that this uncomfortable frame has been owing to carelessness, and a want of due preparation on our part, or has proceeded from a consciousness of guilt from some indulged iniquity or unmortified lust, we should deeply lament such a criminal circumstance be∣fore GOD, apply earnestly to the blood of sprinkling for cleansing, and implore the divine pardon and mercy through Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT becomes us immediately after this ordinance, to renew our holy resolutions, and to call up all our vi∣gilance, for the two following reasons: (1.) <HI>Satan</HI> is pecu∣liarly busy, after sealing ordinances, in endeavouring to rob us of the comforts of religion; to undo what was done at the ordinance; and either to cajole us into <HI>security,</HI> or to drive us into <HI>despair;</HI> and, generally speaking, the greater sensible comfort we have had in the ordinance, the greater danger shall we be in of falling into <HI>spiritual pride</HI> or <HI>fatal security</HI> after it. It has been also observed, that men are liable to fall into the heaviest temptations immediately after sacraments. <HI>Satan's</HI> most violent as∣saults upon our Saviour, happened immediately after his baptism, the visible descent of the holy Ghost upon him, and that signal honour done him, by a voice <HI>from the excellent glory</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 21, 22.—iv. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and it was on the back of his first sacrament, and after the most confident and sanguine resolutions of <HI>Peter,</HI> that he was tempted to deny his Lord and Master, and so scandalously yielded to the temptation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv. 29,—71.</NOTE>. (2.) It becomes us to renew and strengthen our resolutions, that our Christian profession
<PB N="77" REF="014137_0076_0F97D491B71C98C8"/>may be adorned, and that Christianity may not suffer by our follies and indiscretions.</P>
<P N="6">6. THESE good resolutions should be formed <HI>wholly</HI> and <HI>only</HI> in the strength of Christ; and indeed, <HI>this itself</HI> ought to be one of our most solemn resolutions, that we will <HI>live wholly by faith on the Son of</HI> GOD. This is that all-important doctrine of humility and self-denial which is inculcated upon us, throughout the whole gospel, and which is indeed the very <HI>spirit and genius</HI> of the gospel it∣self, that, renouncing all self-righteousness and self-de∣pendance, we are to rely wholly on the righteousness and strength of the Redeemer; going forth to perform all duty, and to encounter all temptation, only in his strength and in the power of his might; casting all our cares upon him who careth for us, and desiring to be found only in him, clothed with his righteousness. Had <HI>Peter's</HI> good resolutions been formed in this manner, he could never have fallen: The arm of omnipotence would have been his sure defence, and his head would have been shielded in the day of battle.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF our souls have been properly exercised at this sacrament, our conduct and conversation will shine after∣wards with a peculiar lustre. Holy exercises will pro∣bably shew themselves by their natural fruits. Our faces will shine like that of <HI>Moses</HI> when he returned from con∣versing with GOD on the mount; and we shall give the world occasion to <HI>take knowledge of us, that we have been with Jesus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT will be advantageous after sacraments, expressly to mention our sacramental engagements in all our prayers, as an expedient to keep a solemn sense of them alive on our minds.</P>
<P N="9">9. WHEN we are called out in the course of provi∣dence to encounter any trial, temptation or difficult and self-denying duty (which must frequently be the case
<PB N="78" REF="014137_0077_0F97D49274733B18"/>with every Christian) we should call to remembrance, this our solemn covenant, so publicly transacted, and so lately renewed; and ask our consciences what conduct will best become us as communicants, who have bound ourselves by solemn and public vows to be the Lord's, and to live wholly to his honour and glory.</P>
<P N="10">10. THAT course of life by which we may best ho∣nour our Christian profession after this sacrament, seems to be the following. (1.) Our conversation ought in all things to be such as becometh the gospel of Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. i. 27. Eph. iv. 1. &amp;c. Col. i. 10. 1. Thes. ii. 12.</NOTE>. (2.) We should have a constant eye to the example of Christ, and carefully study it, as laid down in the gos∣pel, with a particular design of being conformed to it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. xvi. 24. 1 Pet. ii. 21. 1 John ii. 6. Rom. viii. 29.</NOTE>. (3.) We should endeavour to shew the world by our out∣ward deportment, that we enjoy a serene, chearful and happy state of mind: Yet at the same time we should guard in a particular manner, against discovering a re∣lish <HI>for sensual, sinful indulgences,</HI> or a disposition to levity, trisling and vanity. (4.) It is of the utmost impor∣tance to the honour of our profession, that we <HI>govern our passions;</HI> as Christian professors, who indulge <HI>anger, malice, envy, covetousness, revenge,</HI> or the like, are the foul∣est blots and scandals of religion. (5.) If communi∣cants would not be guilty of crucifying their Lord afresh, let them be careful of truth in their words, faith∣fulness in their promises, honesty in their dealings, mo∣desty, sobriety and temperance in their lives, and that on all occasions they speak honourably of religion.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IX. PRACTICAL REFLECTIONS <HI>on the</HI> INCARNATION <HI>and</HI> BIRTH <HI>of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>proper before or after the</HI> LORD'S SUPPER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FROM the amazing change of circumstances which our Lord underwent in his incarnation, we have an astonishing demonstration of the riches of GOD'S love to our world, and of his mercy to lost sin∣ners.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALSO of the unspeakable condescension of Christ: And this is amazingly heightened by his perfect fore∣knowledge of every circumstance of <HI>pain, shame</HI> and <HI>po∣verty,</HI> which should accompany his incarnation, and the long space of time in which he should suffer this eclipse of glory, and series of ignominious sufferings.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM that abasement, poverty and pain to which Christ stooped that he might save human sinners, and to which his loving Father freely delivered him up for us all, we may and must infer the unspeakable <HI>importance of a human soul,</HI> and of its redemption and salvation: Also, the <HI>dreadful evil of sin</HI> and <HI>eternal misery,</HI> its just wages, to deliver us from which, the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD condescended to be <HI>born of a woman,</HI> and to <HI>die on a cross!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. FROM this wonderful stoop of humility and con∣descension in the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD, and those abasing humi∣liating circumstances, in which he chose to appear in our nature, we learn how little value GOD sets on those things which are so highly esteemed among men; I mean worldly riches, grandeur, honour and high estate.—And hence we see worldly pride and vanity, worldly ambition and avarice, or immoderate desire of worldly riches, in their true light, and have the best antidote against them.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="80" REF="014137_0079_0F97D493F46EBEA8"/>
5. FROM the mean and obscure birth and humble circumstances of the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD, compared with his amiable and divine character, we are taught not to de∣spise men on account of their obscure birth, or humble circumstances in life, but to form our estimate of them, and respect for them, on their moral characters, per∣sonal worth, and the God-like qualities and perfections of the soul and inward man, which alone are estimable in themselves, and in the critical discerning eye of GOD.</P>
<P N="6">6. FROM the obscure birth and humble circumstances of the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD, the poor, needy and despised things of this world may borrow an argument of consolation in their mean and straitened circumstances. Why should a real Christian be mortified by the contempt of the world, when this was precisely his Master's case? Nay, ought it not rather to be an honour to the <HI>pious poor,</HI> that they are in the same circumstances with their divine Master, who was despised of men, and had not where to repose his venerable head?</P>
<P N="7">7. OUR Saviour's mean birth and low circumstances, may teach us how little account we should make of the things of <HI>time</HI> and <HI>sense</HI> in general, and how little all worldly pomp, honour and splendor can contribute to our true happiness. Who so happy and blessed as the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD? Who so contented as he? And yet who <HI>so poor</HI> and <HI>despised?</HI> And this should also teach us how we should stand affected to worldly things—That <HI>quiet∣ness</HI> and <HI>self-deniedness</HI> of children; that holy indifference with regard to worldly things, and that <HI>meekness, humility</HI> and <HI>contentedness</HI> of mind, which is so distinguishing a characteristic of the children of GOD, and the disciples of Christ.</P>

ADOPTION is a word borrowed from the civil law, and signifies the chusing of a stranger by those who have an estate, and no issue, and giving him the politi∣cal and legal relation of a son and heir to their estate, and engaging to deal by him as though he were the is∣sue of their own body.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE are all, by nature, children of wrath, children of the devil, and strangers and enemies to GOD. GOD'S adopting us, is therefore, a more generous and merciful act than human adoption, and differs from it in the following respects.—(1.) When men adopt, they fix their love on strangers, because they are destitute of children; but GOD need not have done this, seeing he sustains the relation of a Father to myriads of holy and happy beings, who have never, by apostacy, forfeited his paternal love. (2.) Some excellence or hopefulness in the persons adopted by men, is generally the motive of their adopting them; but GOD saw nothing in us amiable, excellent, promising or engaging, but every
<PB N="82" REF="014137_0081_0F97D49574316F58"/>thing just the reverse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xvi. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE>. (3.) Men cannot change the temper or disposition of those whom they adopt; but GOD gives a temper and disposition suitable to the re∣lation: They receive from him <HI>the Spirit of adoption,</HI> whereby they cry, <HI>Abba, Father</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are adopted by GOD <HI>in Christ,</HI> and all the bles∣sings which GOD gives us, as his sons, flow to us <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through Christ,</HI> as the channel of their conveyance. Christ, in consequence of <HI>his Sonship</HI> is made <HI>heir of all things</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 3.</NOTE>, and the whole inheritance of GOD'S <HI>human family,</HI> is put into the hands of their elder brother for them. Indeed, he has purchased the inheritance in their name and stead, and has the right of dispensing it to his human brethren; so that adopted sinners are <HI>heirs of</HI> GOD, and <HI>joint heirs with Christ,</HI> in whom is treasured up all fulness for their supply<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Luk. xxii. 29. Rom. viii. 19. John xx. 17. 1 Cor. i. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE privileges of believers, in consequence of their adoption, are exeeding many, gracious and astonish∣ing. Their state and relation is altered: From being children of the <HI>devil,</HI> they are become the children of GOD by faith in Jesus Christ, and have GOD'S name, and his Son's name put upon them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxiii. 19. Eph. iii. 10.</NOTE>;—from being slaves to the <HI>devil</HI> and their lusts, they are restored to the glorious liberty of the <HI>sons of</HI> GOD; they are taken into GOD'S family and houshold, are made fellow-citizens with the saints, and, in consequence of this, are entitled to pro∣tection, provision, and communion with their Father. Particularly, they are promised protection<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxxii. 2, 18.</NOTE>; plenti∣ous provision<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxiii.

Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE>; and correction when they stand in need of it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 6,—11.</NOTE>. They have, in short, GOD himself for their portion—<Q>Heirs of GOD: All are yours, and ye are GOD'S, and GOD is Christ's.</Q> Rich and glorious in∣ventory! They are also at length introduced into the immediate presence of their heavenly Father, in the up∣per mansions, and fully satisfied with his love, being ac∣cording to the capacities of their nature, perfectly as∣simulated to his image and likeness; of which glorious event, the apostle <HI>John</HI> speaks with astonishment and rapture<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 1,—3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE marks of the adopted children of GOD, are in general, a <HI>reverential, submissive, loving</HI> and <HI>obedient</HI> temper of mind. If we are indeed the <HI>children of</HI> GOD, we have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. We feel that inward reverence towards GOD, and respect and veneration for him, which a dutiful child does to a loving and respectable father.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF we have the Spirit of adoption, we feel supreme love for our heavenly Father, and this will shew itself in the following things: (1.) We shall entertain worthy and delightful thoughts of GOD, as a most kind, gra∣cious, reconciled Father in Christ; the thoughts of him will be very precious, and our meditations of him will be sweet<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxix. 17.—civ. 34.</NOTE>. (2.) We shall delight to draw near to GOD in prayer, with an humble boldness and freedom of soul— to hear <HI>of him</HI> and <HI>from him</HI> in his word—and earnestly desire communion with him in all holy ordinances of worship. (3.) We shall have a real zeal for GOD'S honour and glory in the world; rejoice to see <HI>our Father</HI> honour∣ed, and his interest flourishing, and be grieved at heart to see him neglected, blasphemed and dishonoured by
<PB N="84" REF="014137_0083_0F97D496F4808D40"/>sinners: And, (4.) We shall earnestly wish and long for a full conformity to our heavenly Father, and the full enjoyment of his love and presence for ever, in his upper house.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF we are indeed GOD'S children by adoption, and do supremely love him that begat, we shall also love all them that are begotten of him. We shall love the whole <HI>Christian brotherhood,</HI> so far as they bear the image of their heavenly Father, by whatever names known, into whatever sects or parties split and divided.—Yea, we shall be linked in bonds of tenderest affection, to the whole numerous family both in heaven and on earth, whether our <HI>human brethren</HI> by adoption and regeneration, or our <HI>angelical brethren</HI> by creation and unsinning recti∣tude and obedience. All who, with us, can call GOD <HI>Father,</HI> will have a distinguished place in our benevolent and complacential affections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii. 15. 1 John v. 1.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XI. <HI>Of</HI> REPENTANCE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. REPENTANCE partakes both of the nature of <HI>conversion</HI> and <HI>sanctification.</HI> Conversion be∣gins by repentance; and it is the constant daily duty of true converts, as long as they have finful natures and imperfect characters.</P>
<P N="2">2. REPENTANCE implies in it, a deep and afflicting sense of the evil nature and desert of sin; an earnest de∣sire to be freed from its guilt, dominion and condem∣nation, and sincere endeavours to turn from it to
<PB N="85" REF="014137_0084_0F97D498DAEA8890"/>the service and savour of a holy GOD, through a Re∣deemer.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEREFORE the proper subject of repentance, is a sinner in the present life: For, in hell there is no place for repentance; and in heaven, though the bles∣sed will retain the greatest hatred of sin, yet being guilt∣less and sinless, they can have no proper compunction or contrition for sin, nor any uneasy afflictive sensations of mind on its account. All sin and sorrow will be then for ever done away.</P>
<P N="4">4. THOUGH all sinners will sooner or later be filled with sorrow and distress for what they have done against GOD, yet many in this life are <HI>hardened past feeling,</HI> through the deceitfulness of sin; have their neck as an iron sinew, their brow as brass, and live and die in this <HI>stupid, hardened, remorseless</HI> state, after having drowned the voice of conscience, and grieved the holy Spirit of GOD, which would have sealed them to the day of re∣demption.</P>
<P N="5">5. OTHERS have also some kind of sorrow for sin, which is never effectual; some kind of repentance which is never true and saving; but, as the Apostle ex∣presses it, <HI>needeth-to be repented of.</HI> We have examples of this in <HI>Cain, Pharaoh, Ahab,</HI> the <HI>Israelites, Nebuchadnezzar, Judas,</HI> and many under our own observation.</P>
<P N="6">6. WE ought, therefore, carefully to distinguish be∣tween a <HI>false</HI> and <HI>true</HI> repentance; one that is merely <HI>legal,</HI> and one that is <HI>evangelical.</HI> These are distinguished by their <HI>names</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> languages, and by their <HI>motives</HI> and <HI>effects.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THE words <HI>necham</HI> in the Hebrew, <HI>metameleia</HI> in the Greek, and <HI>poenitentia</HI> in the Latin, are rendered <HI>re∣pentance</HI> in the English; yet they only signify, <HI>trouble</HI> and <HI>vexation after sin,</HI> accompanied with <HI>anguish</HI> and <HI>torment</HI> of mind. The words <HI>shevah</HI> in the Hebrew, <HI>metanoia</HI> in the Greek, and <HI>resipiscentia</HI> in the Latin, are also translat∣ed
<PB N="86" REF="014137_0085_0F97D499349ABC60"/><HI>repentance</HI> in the English, though they are of very dif∣ferent meaning from the former, and signify a <HI>change of mind;</HI> a <HI>becoming wise after sin,</HI> and consequently, a <HI>doing better than before.</HI> And <HI>this last</HI> only, is <HI>saving, effectual, evangelical</HI> repentance. In the former sense only, wick∣ed men are said <HI>to repent,</HI> when the dread of GOD'S wrath breaks in upon their consciences, and fills them with the terrific apprehension of their guilt, danger and misery.</P>
<P N="8">8. CONVICTION of every kind, whether <HI>legal</HI> or <HI>evan∣gelical, effectual</HI> or <HI>ineffectual,</HI> is wrought by the <HI>Spirit of</HI> GOD, who <HI>convinces the world of sin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE Spirit uses various <HI>instruments</HI> and <HI>means</HI> in awakening the soul to a distressing sight and sense of sin, such as reading and hearing the word; afflictive provi∣dences, dreams, public and private remonstrances, re∣proofs and admonitions, or serious reflections excited by some of these.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE word of GOD works remorse in the hearts of sinners, by discovering to them the purity of the di∣vine nature, the extent of the divine law, the evil and danger of sin, and by leading the sinner to compare his own temper and actions with the law of GOD; while the Spirit enlightens the understanding, and sets home these things on the conscience<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. xx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 19. Rom. vii. 12. Acts ii. 37. 2 Cor. vii. 10.</NOTE>; and this is called a <HI>law work.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. REPENTANCE <HI>unto life,</HI> or evangelical repentance, is wrought by the <HI>law</HI> and <HI>gospel</HI> in conjunction, acting under the influence and energy of the holy Spirit. The <HI>law</HI> is made to shew the soul its guilt and danger, while the <HI>gospel</HI> points out a remedy: The <HI>law</HI> wounds; the <HI>gospel</HI> heals: The <HI>law</HI> is made to enter, that sin may abound and appear exceeding sinful; the <HI>gospel</HI> shews how grace much more abounds through Jesus Christ<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="87" REF="014137_0086_0F97D499F4E4B5E0"/>
12. A MERE <HI>legal repentance</HI> may be, and often is in∣effectual, as in the cases of <HI>Pharaoh, Judas,</HI> and others; yet it is often preparatory to, and issues in <HI>an evangelical repentance</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 37, &amp;c.—xvi. 27, 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="13">13. FALSE and true, or effectual and ineffectual re∣pentance are best distinguished by their concomitant cir∣cumstances and effects; as, (1.) A mere legal repen∣tance, is a <HI>terror of conscience,</HI> arising from a <HI>sense</HI> of <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>danger,</HI> which often consists with the love of sin, and a hatred of holiness: But the real gospel penitent truly hates and abhors sin, and himself because of it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 104. Job xlii. 6. Jer. ii. 34, 35.—iii. 25. Ezek. xxxvi. 31.</NOTE>. (2.) The true penitent forsakes sin and flees from it, not chiefly as it is <HI>damning,</HI> but as it is contrary to the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>will</HI> of GOD, and a vile abuse of gospel grace; and he turns from it to GOD, with a full purpose of, and hearty endeavours after new obedience<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hos. xiv. 8. Acts xi. 23. Luke xv. 18, 20.</NOTE>. (3.) True re∣pentance is ever accompanied with <HI>hope of mercy;</HI> with an apprehension of the mercy of GOD in Christ, and a trust in this mercy<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vii. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="14">14. IT is vile and unwarrantable presumption in sin∣ners to hope for pardon or mercy without repentance.</P>
<P N="15">15. REPENTANCE is sadly mistaken by those, who imagine that it consists in being sorry or troubled for sin, while they still continue to commit it.</P>
<P N="16">16. LET not distressed mourning penitents despair of GOD'S mercy, which is particularly promised to such, throughout the whole scriptures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 28. Psal. li. 17.—xxxiv. 18. Isa. lvii. 15. Isa. lxvi. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="17">17. As we daily sin, repentance is our daily duty: No person in this world will ever be above the exercise of this grace, or above the need of pardon.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XII. <HI>Of</HI> SANCTIFICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. TO <HI>sanctify</HI> is to <HI>make holy,</HI> and to <HI>be sanctified</HI> is to <HI>be made holy;</HI> so that <HI>sanctification</HI> and <HI>holiness,</HI> are, for the most part, synonymous terms. Sometimes, indeed, to sanctify, signifies, to <HI>set apart a person for the service of</HI> GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 19. Exod. xxviii. 41.</NOTE>; which has a near relation to the for∣mer sense.</P>
<P N="2">2. SANCTIFICATION, as we are here to consider it, is a being <HI>really</HI> and <HI>heartily devoted to</HI> GOD <HI>through Christ:</HI> It is the health, beauty and vigour of the soul, whereby all its faculties being renewed, are enabled to <HI>turn from sin to</HI> GOD, and to exert and exercise those graces by which the sanctified person walks before GOD in righ∣teousness and holiness all the days of his life, until <HI>grace</HI> is perfected in <HI>glory.</HI> In this sense all Christians are <HI>call∣ed to be saints,</HI> or to be sanctified; however the devil, aided by human blindness and stupidity, may have turn∣ed the term, <HI>saints,</HI> into ridicule among men<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 7, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. REGENERATION is an <HI>instantaneous work,</HI> or rather <HI>act</HI> of GOD'S Spirit, giving a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>divine</HI> principle of spiritual life to the soul. <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>adoption</HI> are <HI>acts</HI> of GOD'S grace <HI>without us,</HI> whereby a <HI>relative</HI> change passes on our state: But <HI>sanctification</HI> is a <HI>continued pro∣gressive work</HI> of GOD'S Spirit <HI>within us,</HI> influencing and co-operating with our endeavours, from the moment of our regeneration, until our dying day, and the complete perfection of our holiness.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="89" REF="014137_0088_0F97D49B74602848"/>
4. SANCTIFICATION is begun in <HI>conversion</HI> and per∣fected in <HI>glory:</HI> and includes in it the exercises of <HI>repen∣tance,</HI> and of all the <HI>graces</HI> and <HI>virtues</HI> of the Christian life. 'Tis a progressive work, begun, carried on, and perfected by the holy Spirit of GOD in the human soul; carrying it on from light to light, from strength to strength, and from one degree of holiness to another, 'till at length it appears perfect before GOD in <HI>Zion.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE two principal branches of sanctification, and which comprehend all the rest, are <HI>mortification</HI> and <HI>vivi∣fication;</HI> or, as the scriptures express it, a <HI>dying daily to sin, and living unto righteousness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 11,—19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. DYING <HI>unto sin,</HI> or <HI>mortification,</HI> implies in it our ut∣most endeavours to guard against the prevailing power of sin, and to extirpate or root it out of our souls, by all gospel methods, and by all the instrumental means of religion which GOD hath appointed for that purpose. And this duty seems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imply in it the following things: (1.) Hearty endeavours to keep up a constant, lively, believing sense and apprehension of the evil nature and desert of sin, both as <HI>defiling</HI> and <HI>condemning.</HI>—(2.) Con∣stant watchsulness against the outbreakings of corrupt nature; with frequent careful examinations whether sin is gaining or losing ground in our souls.—(3.) Constant application to GOD in Christ, and in the use of the means and ordinances of grace, for help against the power and love of sin:—And this <HI>first,</HI> by faith in the propitiation and merit of Christ for justification, and a sense of pardon;—and <HI>secondly,</HI> by faith or trust in the promises, and more directly, in Christ himself, for pow∣er and strength to conquer every lust.</P>
<P N="7">7. VIVIFICATION, or a <HI>living unto</HI> GOD, or unto <HI>righte∣ousness,</HI> as a distinct branch of holiness or sanctification, consists properly in obtaining, cultivating, and improv∣ing in all the virtues and graces of the Christian life,
<PB N="90" REF="014137_0089_0F97D4E2B5196A10"/>upon gospel motives and principles. In order to this, our natures must be changed by regeneration; our reli∣gious actions must be performed according to the rule of GOD'S word; in obedience to his divine authority; in faith; to the glory of GOD as their chief end, and with a humble stedfast reliance on Christ both for <HI>assis∣tance</HI> and <HI>acceptance:</HI>—And this course must be <HI>habitual</HI> and <HI>persevering;</HI> or, as the scriptures beautifully express it,— <HI>a walking with</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="8">8. WE must act in religion on the following motives, in order to the advancement and perfection of our sanc∣tification: —(1.) We must have the example of Christ habitually in our view as the pattern and model of our temper and behaviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 21. Philip. ii. 5.</NOTE>.—(2.) The love of Christ dis∣played in our redemption, and the application of it in all its steps should constrain us to love him: This is the most powerful inducement to universal gospel holiness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 14.</NOTE>. —(3.) Our relation to GOD as his children; our pro∣fessed subjection to his laws and government; the glo∣rious hope and inheritance set before us, and the many great and precious promises made unto us in the go∣spel, are all of them so many <HI>powerful motives inducing</HI> and <HI>urging</HI> us on <HI>to perfect holiness in his fear</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vii. 1.</NOTE>. (4.) Our union to Christ, and our bodies and spirits being, in con∣sequence, members of his mystical body, and temples of the holy Ghost, is a wonderful cogent motive, both to <HI>mortification</HI> and <HI>vivification;</HI> and, to this purpose the Apostle most beautifully and forceably uses it, 1 Cor. vi. 15,—20.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIII. <HI>The</HI> NATURE <HI>and</HI> BLESSED EFFECTS <HI>of an</HI> UNION <HI>with</HI> CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. UNION with a person or thing, signifies <HI>such a connexion,</HI> as, in some sort, constitutes <HI>sameness</HI> or <HI>oneness;</HI> to be united therefore to Christ, implies, that the person so united, is in some sense, <HI>one with him.</HI> Christ is in some sense <HI>one with him,</HI> and he <HI>one with Christ.</HI> This is a great mystery, as the Apostle tells us; but it is a mystery plainly revealed and taught in the scriptures, and upon the right knowledge of it depends our right conceptions of vital religion, and much of the comfort of every Christian.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS union is not <HI>essential,</HI> like that of the three persons in the Godhead; nor personal, like that of the divine and human natures of Christ in the person of the Mediator;—nor <HI>thirdly, relative, civil</HI> or <HI>political,</HI> like that which subsists between a king and his subjects, or a master and his servants or disciples: If this were the nature of <HI>this union,</HI> as some Christians understand it, then would it be no mystery as the Apostle represents it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 32.</NOTE>; but the plainest and most comprehensible thing imaginable: For the weakest understanding can easily understand how it is, that a king and his subjects make <HI>one body politic,</HI> or a master and his servants <HI>one body domes∣tic.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is a <HI>mystical</HI> union. It is a <HI>mystery,</HI> and there∣fore the <HI>modus</HI> or <HI>manner</HI> of it can admit of no clear and and full illustration or explanation, in the present im∣perfect state. It is however shadowed forth to us un∣der many <HI>figures</HI> or <HI>metaphors,</HI> which prove, that it is a ve∣ry
<PB N="92" REF="014137_0091_0F97D4E434109530"/>close and intimate union, and such as transforms and assimulates the soul into the very <HI>temper, likeness</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ, and makes it <HI>one with him,</HI> in some very important respects. It is compared to the union of a <HI>vine</HI> with its <HI>branches</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xv. 1. &amp;c.</NOTE>, between a <HI>husband</HI> and his <HI>wife</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 30. Rom. vii. 4.</NOTE>; the <HI>corner-stone</HI> or <HI>foundation</HI> and the <HI>building</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 4.</NOTE>; the <HI>head</HI> and <HI>members</HI> of the same natural body<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 15.</NOTE>; the union of <HI>meat</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> with <HI>the body,</HI> which they nourish<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">John vi. 56.</NOTE>; and the union between GOD the Father and <HI>Christ</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 11.</NOTE>. Be∣lievers are called <HI>the body of Christ,</HI> and <HI>members in particu∣lar,</HI> and are powerfully dissuaded from the sin of unclean∣ness from this very consideration. In other scrip∣tures, believers are represented as <HI>one Spirit with Christ;</HI> Christ is <HI>in them the hope of glory,</HI> and <HI>their life</HI> is hid with Christ in GOD. St. <HI>Paul</HI> did not live, but <HI>Christ lived in him.</HI> Christ and believers are represented as having <HI>one common interest; one</HI> GOD <HI>and Father,</HI> and <HI>one common in∣heritance</HI> as joint heirs<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 17. Col. i. 27—iii. 3. Gal. ii. 20. Matth. xxv. 40. John xx. 17. Rom. viii. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are not to form any gross conceptions of this mystical union between Christ and believers, as though it implied any <HI>physical mixture</HI> or <HI>confusion</HI> of the two be∣ings thus united; and yet these very expressive meta∣phors prove, that this union must be something exceed∣ing <HI>close</HI> and <HI>intimate,</HI> such as makes the soul truly a par∣taker of the divine nature and image of Christ; as <HI>lea∣vens, transforms</HI> and <HI>assimulates</HI> it; such by which the soul imbibes (if I may so speak) the Spirit of Christ; de∣rives strength, and vigour and nourishment from him, as its <HI>living head,</HI> and as the <HI>branches</HI> do from the <HI>parent vine.</HI> Christ <HI>dwells</HI> and <HI>abides</HI> in the believer by his Spirit, and
<PB N="93" REF="014137_0092_0F97D4E4F35DE700"/>the believer <HI>grows up into him in all things, which is the head.</HI> <Q>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can we, except we abide in Christ; for without him, (or out of him, disunited from him) we can do nothing;</Q> bring forth no fruit unto righteousness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xv. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS is a <HI>spiritual union.</HI> <Q>They that are joined to the Lord, are one spirit;</Q> and this is true in two important senses: (1.) They partake of the same di∣vine Spirit with their Lord and Master. To <HI>him</HI> indeed GOD gives not the Spirit by measure. In him it hath pleased the Father that all fullness of the Spirit and his graces should dwell; and, through this union, believers derive from him such supplies of this Spirit, and his graces, as they stand in need of. It is the very same Spirit which dwelleth in Christ, as the head, which is dispensed by him to the living members of his mystical body. All these members, whether in heaven or on earth, drink in the same Spirit, from the same never∣failing fountain or repository, and are all united together in love by the same Spirit. (2.) They have also the <HI>same temper</HI> and <HI>disposition;</HI> the <HI>same mind</HI> in them which is also in Christ Jesus. His interest is their interest; and his will is their will. They have the same aims, desires, aversions, delights; the same love of GOD, zeal for his glory, and charity and affection for his creatures and children. And hereby they know that Christ abideth in them, by the Spirit which he hath given them: But those who have not <HI>thus</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>temper of Christ,</HI> may be assured that they are none of his.</P>
<P N="6">6. THIS union of the soul to Christ is formed <HI>by faith.</HI> The holy Spirit works this faith in the soul, and draws it to Christ; and faith receives Christ into the soul, and forms the bond of spiritual union between them; so that thenceforth the soul <HI>lives in Christ,</HI> by <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>love,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="014137_0093_0F97D4E6DAB56318"/>and <HI>Christ lives in the soul</HI> by the quickening, sanctifying and comforting influences of his holy Spirit. <HI>Christ,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>dwelleth in our hearts by faith.

<P N="7">7. THE effects of this union are many and exceeding precious: For, (1.) The moment our souls are thus united to Christ, we are in a <HI>justified state,</HI> in a state of acceptance and reconciliation with GOD, and conse∣quently can never come into condemnation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE>. (2.) The moment of this union, is the moment of <HI>our spiri∣tual regeneration:</HI> We then begin to be <HI>partakers of a di∣vine nature,</HI> which, by virtue of this union, we receive from Christ the head of divine influences. (3.) With the first moment of this union begins our <HI>eternal,</HI> as well as our <HI>spiritual life:</HI> It is our <HI>birth to glory.</HI> (4.) Our progress in holiness depends entirely on this union; for severed from Christ, we can do nothing. (5.) Fellow∣ship and communion with GOD is entirely the fruit and effect of this union: For, we can have no fellowship with GOD, but <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Christ. (6.) Fellowship and communion among Christians is begun and carried on by this union: For, they are all united unto one ano∣ther <HI>in Christ,</HI> and <HI>to</HI> GOD <HI>through Christ;</HI> and this com∣munion is formed by their all partaking the same Spirit from Christ the head, by which as members, they are united together into one body.</P>
<P N="8">8. LET us never rest satisfied, until this blessed uni∣on is formed in our own souls; and until we know that it is, by the blessed effects of it, purifying our hearts by faith, and enabling us to bring forth much fruit of ho∣liness.—I had almost forgot to add, under the forego∣ing particular, That the perseverance of the saints in grace, is the blessed effect of this union; and that this union, is the strongest argument to prove it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIV. <HI>Of the</HI> FINAL PERSEVERANCE <HI>of the</HI> SAINTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS every blessing is valuable in proportion to its <HI>certainty</HI> and <HI>duration,</HI> so the final perseve∣rance of the saints in holiness, if it be true, must be a ve∣ry comfortable doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS doctrine is necessarily denied by all those who imagine they can put themselves into a state of grace, and put themselves out of it, at pleasure; and in∣deed by many who acknowledge the necessity of su∣pernatural and efficacious influences of the Spirit in con∣version, and yet suppose this grace <HI>amissible</HI> by the con∣verted sinner, who, by his abuse of his natural liberty, may <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>finally fall from grace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN we speak of a sinner's <HI>persevering in grace,</HI> or <HI>falling from grace,</HI> we mean <HI>true grace,</HI> or a real work of regenerating grace in the soul: For, we make no doubt, that many who have seemed to have had grace, in a judgment of charity, have fallen from that grace which they <HI>only seemed to have,</HI> but <HI>had not</HI> in reality. We have observed before, that a very specious religious cha∣racter is often formed on the principles of <HI>self-love, ho∣nour, fame, reputation</HI> and <HI>fear,</HI> or the terrors of consci∣ence, from a sight and sense of guilt and demerit, which, although it is exceeding <HI>hollow, defective</HI> and <HI>imperfect,</HI> yet often imposes not only on a credulous world, but also upon the persons who sustain it. None but GOD certainly and infallibly knows whether persons have true grace or not. Hypocrites often make as fair a profes∣sion as real Christians; and when such fall into a course of gross sins, we are not rashly to conclude that <HI>men may
<PB N="96" REF="014137_0095_0F97D4E7F3900AF0"/>fall from grace,</HI> as it is impossible for us to know whether such were ever <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>really</HI> gracious.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is no objection against this doctrine, that some truly gracious persons have fallen into very gross sins; yea, into courses of sin, and thereby dishonoured Christ, and their profession of his religion. The question is, Whether truly gracious persons can ever <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>final∣ly</HI> lose the principle of grace; <HI>wholly</HI> apostatize from GOD, and fall into reprobacy and condemnation?</P>
<P N="5">5. SOME have imagined, that the saints may fall <HI>total∣ly</HI> from grace, but not <HI>finally;</HI> as in the instances of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon:</HI> But, though this would solve many diffi∣culties, yet it does not seem to be the scripture doc∣trine.</P>
<P N="6">6. IF what we have said of <HI>conversion</HI> be true, it seems by no means probable, that GOD should regenerate men, and give them his Spirit, and wholly change their na∣tures, and put his image on their souls, and yet, that ei∣ther <HI>they themselves,</HI> or the <HI>devil,</HI> should be allowed to de∣stroy and undo this glorious work, and wholly raze and blot out that image of his, which was engraven by his Spirit on their hearts!</P>
<P N="7">7. IF GOD, by an act of astonishing grace, <HI>justifies us</HI> when <HI>ungodly;</HI> if he also takes us out of the <HI>devil's</HI> family by <HI>adoption,</HI> and gives us the spirit and temper of sons, whereby we are disposed and enabled to cry, <HI>Abba, Fa∣ther,</HI> and to render a filial and dutiful obedience: Can we suppose him so capricious (with reverence be it spo∣ken!) as to change his own free acts; recal his gifts and favours; condemn us again and cast us back to the fa∣mily of the devil, from which he had but just taken us by a miracle of mercy; especially when we are told that <HI>his gifts and calling are without repentance</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxix. 28,—34. Rom. viii. 32,—39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF the doctrine of our <HI>mystical union with Christ,</HI> through faith and the indwelling influences of the Spi∣rit,
<PB N="97" REF="014137_0096_0F97D4E8B39A9628"/>be true; the perseverance of the saints in holiness, must follow of consequence: For, can we suppose that the mystical body of Christ can be mangled or dismem∣bered? That his members may be cut off and made members of the devil? Or that our bodies may be one day <HI>temples of the holy Ghost,</HI> and the next <HI>synagogues of satan?</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Is it not something very shocking and absurd to reason, to suppose, that the states of men GOD-ward should be liable to hourly change; one hour justified persons, the next under sentence of condemnation; one hour holy saints, the next profane reprobates; one hour favourites of heaven, the next confederates with hell: The hour before death in a state of salvation, angels ready to guard and convey them to bliss; an hour hence, the prey of devils, and conveyed by them to ever∣lasting torments!</P>
<P N="10">10. WE do not say that the saints are infallible by any power of standing in themselves; or that divine grace is a thing, which, in its own nature cannot be lost. We believe, that if believers were left to themselves, they would fall from grace every hour. But we found this doctrine wholly on the power and promise of GOD; firmly believing, on the authority of his infallible word, <Q>That his gifts and calling are without repentance; and that all who are begotten again to a lively hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in the heavens for them, SHALL BE KEPT BY THE POWER OF GOD, THROUGH FAITH, UNTO SALVATION, ready to be re∣vealed in the last times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 3,—6.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11. FOR the clear and superabundant scripture evi∣dence
<PB N="98" REF="014137_0097_0F97D4E973B912D8"/>of this doctrine, read with attention the scriptures referred to below in the margin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John x. 27,—29.—vi. 39, 40.—xvii. 11. 1 John ii. 19. —iii. 9.

Job xvii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE scripture instances or examples alledged against this doctrine, are either, (1.) Of <HI>hypocritical pro∣fessors,</HI> or <HI>mere temporary believers,</HI> falling from an out∣ward profession of religion, which we believe to be a ve∣ry possible and common case. Or, (2.) Of the <HI>casual</HI> and <HI>temporary</HI> defections and falls of true saints, which we readily grant to be too frequent a case. Or, (3.) Of <HI>conditional threatenings</HI> made to true saints, as a means of, and excitement to their perseverance. And all these scripture instances which are commonly objected to this doctrine, may, without straining them, be reduced to one or other of these classes.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE principal objections alledged against this doctrine, from the nature and tendency of it, is, (1.) That it ministers to carnal confidence and security, and tends to hinder that watchfulness and circumspection, that holy fear and trembling with which it becomes such guilty, imperfect creatures as we are, to work out our salvation: But, the very best of men, can have no ground of confidence, save in the strength and promise of GOD. We know also, that if we live not holily, watchfully and circumspectly, we have no true grace. These are the only certain and infallible signs and marks of true grace, and where these are wanting, it would be the most irrational and absurd presumption, to be confi∣dent of persevering in a grace which we have not. (2.) It is objected, that this doctrine renders admonitions and reproofs, vain and needless. But these are the very appointed means of our standing, and to prevent our
<PB N="99" REF="014137_0098_0F97D4EA3366E7B0"/>apostacy and ruin. We can have no certainty of per∣severance, but what arises from our certainty of the truth of grace, and this can be only ascertained by a rea∣dy and chearful compliance with every gospel motive to universal holiness.</P>
<P N="14">14. FEW Christians <HI>can</HI> or <HI>ought</HI> to take any comfort from the application of this doctrine to themselves. None have any right to do so, but such as have the clearest and most satisfying evidences of the truth of grace in themselves. And how few real Christians, comparative∣ly speaking, have actually attained to this satisfying evi∣dence of the truth of grace, from which they may take the comfort of the doctrine of perseverance?</P>
<P N="15">15. LET it therefore be our first and principal care, to have true grace; let it be our next to know that we have it, to make our calling and election sure and cer∣tain to ourselves; and then let us freely rejoice in the immutability of the divine love;—that his gifts and calling are without repentance; that where he has once begun a good work, he will carry it on to the day of Christ Jesus, and that neither earth nor hell, shall be able to pluck us out of his hand, or out of his Father's hand. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XV. <HI>Of</HI> PEACE <HI>of</HI> CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONSCIENCE is a comparing of our moral actions with their rule, and a practical judg∣ing of them by this rule; the result of which is, that we either <HI>acquit</HI> or <HI>condemn</HI> ourselves, according to this
<PB N="100" REF="014137_0099_0F97D4EAF50063D0"/>evidence. When we acquit ourselves upon this practi∣cal judgment, then have we <HI>peace of conscience.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. PEACE of conscience is the <HI>fruit</HI> and <HI>effect</HI> of <HI>sanc∣tification:</HI> For, it is impossible that an unsanctified, im∣penitent, graceless person, can, upon true evidence, ac∣quit himself at the bar of his own conscience; or, in other words, enjoy true peace of conscience.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN order to true peace of conscience, it is not enough that the matter of our actions be conformable to the law of GOD: We must also be conscious that they are done from <HI>right motives</HI> and for <HI>right ends;</HI> in obedi∣ence to the authority of GOD, with a view to his glory and the good of our fellow creatures, or for our own spi∣ritual benefit.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is one thing to be able to acquit ourselves of <HI>some particular crime</HI> falsely laid to our charge by men, which a very wicked person may be able to do; and quite another thing to be able to acquit ourselves, in our <HI>general conduct,</HI> in the sight of GOD. In order to <HI>this peace,</HI> we must labour to maintain the testimony of a good conscience, both <HI>towards</HI> GOD and <HI>towards men;</HI> or, as the Apostle elsewhere expresses it, we must <HI>have lived in all good conscience</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiii. 1.—xxiv. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. A GOOD, <HI>quiet,</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> conscience is one of the greatest blessings upon earth; one of the richest and most invaluable privileges of the sanctified; can be on∣ly obtained in the way of circumspect holiness, and should be pursued with the utmost assiduity by every Christian. Both the nature of it, and an earnest resolu∣tion to pursue it, are well expressed in these words of <HI>Job: My heart shall not reproach me, so long as I live</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 6. Read also, 1 John iii. 19,—21. 1 Tim. i. 5. 1 Pet. iii. 19. 1 Tim. iii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. Two things are particularly necessary to peace of conscience: <HI>First,</HI> That <HI>our sins are pardoned,</HI> through
<PB N="101" REF="014137_0100_0F97D4EBB37504F8"/>faith in the Redeemer's blood: For, where guilt re∣mains, there can be no ground for peace, and where a sense of guilt remains, no peace can actually take place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 11,—14.—x. 22.</NOTE>. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A <HI>holy life:</HI> For, <HI>there is no peace, saith my</HI> GOD, <HI>to the wicked</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. lvii. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>ravishing</HI> pleasures, the <HI>solid joys</HI> and <HI>extatic delights</HI> of a peaceable conscience, are beautifully expressed by the Apostle<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 12.</NOTE>; <Q>For this is our rejoicing, even the testimony of our conscience, that in simpli∣city and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of GOD, we have had our conversation in the world.</Q> And again<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 1,—4.</NOTE>; <Q>Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with GOD, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and rejoice in hope of the glo∣ry of GOD. We glory in tribulations also; know∣ing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope mak∣eth not ashamed, because the love of GOD is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which is given unto us.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. THE <HI>horrors</HI> of an <HI>evil, guilty, condemning</HI> conscience are, beyond compare, the most shocking miseries of this life; and too certain preludes of that worm which dieth not, and that fire which is not quenched. Conscience is a lion, which will one day or other, rise up and tear to pieces, with resistless fury, the impenitent sinner. We have some instructive and alarming instances of these horrors of a guilty and awakened conscience, in the cases of <HI>Cain, Judas</HI> and <HI>Francis Spira.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. THE dangerous and destructive counterfeit of <HI>peace of conscience,</HI> is <HI>security,</HI> or a <HI>false</HI> and <HI>ill-grounded</HI> peace of mind, in a wilful course of sin. This arises either from
<PB N="102" REF="014137_0101_0F97D4EC7377A4D8"/>false and unworthy notions of GOD'S perfections, or from a long custom of sinning against light, whereby the con∣science becomes as it were <HI>seared</HI> and <HI>past feeling</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 18, 19.</NOTE>: But a piercing light will, one day or other, discover this cheat to the sinner, and fill his soul with an anguish which he shall neither be able to support nor divert.</P>
<P N="10">10. LET us labour to obtain an <HI>enlightened, well in∣formed</HI> conscience, that we may neither, on the one hand, become the dupes of superstitious fears, groundless pa∣nics, and imaginary terrors, for actions in which there is really no guilt; nor, on the other, like Saint Paul, bring guilt upon ourselves, by erring <HI>ignorantly through unbelief</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="11">11. LET us pray and labour for a <HI>tender, sensible, faithful</HI> conscience; lest we be given over to the dread∣ful soul-destroying judgments of <HI>blindness of mind</HI> and <HI>hardness of heart.</HI></P>

<P N="2"><PB N="103" REF="014137_0102_0F97D4ED336541D0"/>
2. IT is a direct fruit of the Spirit, not only as <HI>sancti∣fying,</HI> but as <HI>comforting</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22.</NOTE>: It is the love of GOD shed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghost which is given unto us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS also is a privilege only of the <HI>sanctified:</HI> For, although the holy GHOST operates on the hearts of the wicked, as a <HI>renewer</HI> and <HI>sanctifier;</HI> yet he visits none as a <HI>comforter,</HI> sheding abroad the love of GOD in their hearts, except such as are in a state of <HI>pardon</HI> and <HI>reconci∣liation</HI> with GOD, and as are <HI>actually holy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IF we would experience and enjoy within us, that spiritual kingdom of GOD, which consists in <HI>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 17.</NOTE>; we must, by a <HI>virtu∣ous, watchful</HI> and <HI>circumspect</HI> life, have our souls always prepared and adorned, as fit temples for the residence of the holy Ghost: For, this joy does not seem to be essen∣tial to a sanctified state; but seems rather to depend much on the manner in which we improve our talents, and entertain and cherish the motions and operations of the holy Spirit on our minds. It may be also, in many cases, a peculiar and sovereign favour conferred by GOD on some believers, who may best improve it to his glo∣ry, and the comfort and edification of others, or certain important occasions and emergencies.</P>
<P N="5">5. As, therefore, we would expect this divine privi∣lege, and taste this pure and heavenly joy, let us be so∣licitously watchful over every movement of our hearts and affections, and labour after the utmost purity of soul.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3"><PB N="105" REF="014137_0104_0F97D4EEB37EDC80"/>
3. THIS comfortable assurance of GOD'S eternal love is not, in its own nature <HI>permanent;</HI> but may be, and of∣ten is <HI>lost for a time,</HI> either through falls and miscarriages, or an unwatchful and uncircumspect life, or for other reasons and purposes known only to GOD. Nay, it may be doubted, whether any Christian ever enjoyed this privilege uninterruptedly for many years, or even months together. Nor indeed is it necessary, as it is not essential to salvation. It is necessary to our salvation, that we should always trust in GOD; but it is not equal∣ly necessary, that we should always know that we do so.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD may have wise and gracious reasons for with∣holding this comfortable assurance wholly from some Christians, and for interrupting it often in others; name∣ly, to humble and preserve them from spiritual pride; to chastize them for carelessness and unwatchfulness, and to exercise them in the graces of godly sorrow, re∣pentance, patience, dependance, and a painful diligence in the work of religion.</P>
<P N="5">5. CHRISTIANS may also forfeit this comfortable as∣surance, by their miscarriages and indiscretions; by grieving the holy Spirit and resisting his motions and impulses, and by neglecting the duties of meditation, self-examination, prayer, and the other instrumental or∣dinances of GOD'S appointment.</P>
<P N="6">6. BUT this assurance is a privilege certainly <HI>attainable</HI> by Christians, because it has been <HI>actually attained</HI> by numbers of GOD'S people. It appears that <HI>Job</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xix. 23,—27.</NOTE>, <HI>Da∣vid</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii. 5. and his psalms passim.</NOTE>, St. <HI>Paul</HI> and all the other apostles had this com∣fortable assurance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 12.—iv. 7, 8. 2 Cor. iv. 17.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1, 6, 7, 8.

<P N="8">8. THERE are numberless conditional promises of sal∣vation laid down in scripture, the conditions whereof, if we can be persuaded that we have been enabled to fulfil them, we may be equally assured of <HI>eternal life,</HI> and that we are in a <HI>state of salvation.</HI> For instance; <HI>he that believeth, repenteth, is converted and born of</HI> GOD, <HI>shall be saved.</HI> <Q>This is the record, that GOD hath given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son: He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life; but the wrath of GOD abideth on him.</Q> If, therefore, I have obtained a rational assurance, that I have <HI>believed,</HI> or <HI>received the Son of</HI> GOD <HI>by faith;</HI> that I have <HI>repented,</HI> and am <HI>truly regenerated</HI> and <HI>born again of the Spirit,</HI> I am equally assured of <HI>eternal life.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. THE scriptures abound with marks and characters of <HI>true believers</HI> and <HI>real converts. E. g.</HI> <Q>This is the love of GOD, that ye keep his commandments. We know that we have passed from death unto life, be∣cause we love the brethren. The fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, &amp;c. and they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with its lusts. There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. To be spiritually minded is life and peace. As many as are led by the Spirit of GOD, they are the sons of GOD. Every man, who hath this hope in himself, purifyeth himself, as GOD is pure, &amp;c.</Q> Now, if we are rationally and upon good grounds persuaded that we have these marks and characters, we may be equally assured of spiritual life in possession, and eternal life in reversion.</P>

It is necessary, that we should <HI>discern in ourselves</HI> these marks and evidences, to which the promises of salvation are made: And, (5.) In order to remove all doubt and un∣certainty, it seems necessary, in most cases, that the Spi∣rit should shine upon his own work, and give his <HI>concur∣ring testimony;</HI> and for this we should earnestly pray, while we examine.</P>

THERE is an <HI>extraordinary witness of the Spirit,</HI> which seems distinct from this, and which is much more rare and uncommon; wherein, without any self-exami∣nation, reflection or reasoning, the Spirit of GOD <HI>imme∣diately shines on the soul,</HI> with such an irresistable and over∣powering light, and with such sensible first-fruits of hea∣venly glory, as puts the persons thus highly favoured, infinitely above all doubt of the safety of their state. This often happens to <HI>eminently holy men,</HI> upon the near approach of death.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE very lowest degree of this assurance is not to be expected without <HI>true faith,</HI> and a conscientious re∣gard to GOD'S commandments, accompanied with self-examination, and careful serious reflections on our tem∣per, frame and actions, compared with the word of GOD.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="108" REF="014137_0107_0F97D4F2111E2420"/>
14. IT is the duty of every Christian, to labour to ob∣tain this comfortable assurance of the safety and happi∣ness of his state, for the following reasons: (1.) Without it he can have no rational hope, or joy in the holy Ghost. (2.) He cannot, with truth and sincerity, bear an ho∣nourable testimony to religion, or encourage and com∣fort others from his own experience. (3.) He cannot praise GOD or rejoice in him, as he ought; nor be so chearful in his service, or so examplary in his own life, as he otherwise might. (4.) His death cannot be ho∣nourable to christianity, nor edifying to saints or sinners; as he must go down to the grave, in a state of doubt and hesitancy.</P>
<P N="15">15. To obtain this comfortable assurance, is, for ordi∣nary, a work which requires much labour, diligence and perseverance; but when obtained, it will abundantly re∣compence the labour of a whole lifetime.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XVIII. <HI>The</HI> IMMORTALITY <HI>of the</HI> SOUL.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE doctrine of the soul's immortality is of great importance in religion: For, if the soul perished with the body, <HI>self-denial, mortification,</HI> and <HI>ex∣treme sufferings</HI> in the cause of virtue, would be <HI>absurd;</HI>— and the best Christians would, as the Apostle suggests, be of all men the most miserable.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY the soul's being <HI>immortal,</HI> we do not mean that it is impossible for him who made it to destroy it; or that it is, in its own nature, immortal, independently on GOD; but that it does not perish or die with, or like the
<PB N="109" REF="014137_0108_0F97D4F273BF3528"/>body, nor can be destroyed by any creature; but is ap∣pointed by GOD for an endless existence, and fitted and qualified for this deathless existence in its own nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. REASON does not assure us, that <HI>thought</HI> and <HI>consci∣ousness</HI> are <HI>inseparable</HI> and <HI>essential</HI> properties of human souls: For ought we know, they may be and exist with∣out continued thought, consciousness and reflection, though the contrary opinion is highly probable, and seems to be countenanced by scripture.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE know of but two kinds of substances in the universe, <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>spirit.</HI> And these we conceive of as entirely different and distinct from one another. GOD, we are sure, is a <HI>pure spirit; immaterial, without body</HI> or <HI>bo∣dily parts:</HI> But we are not equally certain that created spirits, either <HI>angels</HI> or <HI>human souls,</HI> are spirits of the same nature with GOD, or <HI>wholly immaterial.</HI> Though their being called <HI>spirits,</HI> and being said to be made after the image of GOD, and to be <HI>his off-spring,</HI> is a <HI>strong pre∣sumption</HI> that they are <HI>immaterial.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. IF it could be certainly proved that our souls are wholly immaterial, as GOD is, it would be a strong ar∣gument in favour of their immortality: Because, it would hence follow, that they are <HI>incapable of dissolution;</HI> that they could not perish with the body, and that none but GOD could destroy them. But we have abundant arguments to prove the <HI>soul's immortality,</HI> laying aside the consideration of its being <HI>immaterial.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. THERE is much the same reason to believe the <HI>spi∣rits of brutes</HI> to be <HI>immaterial,</HI> as the <HI>souls of men. Both</HI> are called <HI>spirits</HI> in the scripture; though it is said, that the one <HI>goeth upward</HI> at death, and the other <HI>downwards.</HI> And it is as difficult to conceive how a <HI>merely material</HI> substance should <HI>perceive, reason, remember, compare, love</HI> and <HI>hate</HI> in a <HI>beast,</HI> more than in a <HI>man.</HI> Yet there are not the same reasons to believe the immortality of the spirits of beasts, as of the souls of men.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="110" REF="014137_0109_0F97D4F3485CB388"/>
7. THE strongest and most conclusive arguments for the <HI>immortality of human souls,</HI> are of a <HI>moral nature,</HI> and do not arise from their being <HI>immaterial:</HI> For, although we know our bodies to be material, yet we have sufficient reason to believe, that they shall be raised from the dead, and rendered immortal in a future state. And if we have reason to believe this of our mortal bodies, why may we not believe the same of our souls, even suppo∣sing them to be material.</P>
<P N="8">8. THERE is a great apparent resemblance between men and brutes in many respects, both <HI>living</HI> and <HI>dying.</HI> They seem to have much the same natural perceptions of pleasure and pain. All the brute creation seem to have some portion of reason, fore-thought, contrivance and memory. So that it is hard to conceive an essenti∣al difference between the souls of men and the spirits of beasts; only, that the former appear to be a more per∣fect kind of spirits. Yet there are many <HI>great</HI> and <HI>essen∣tial</HI> differences between men and beasts, which lay a foundation for believing the souls of men to be <HI>immortal,</HI> whereas the spirits of beasts may be <HI>mortal</HI> and <HI>perishable</HI> at their death.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE souls of men have plainly <HI>a capacity for virtue and religion.</HI> It is evident that they have a <HI>conscience, a moral sense</HI> and <HI>feeling,</HI> a <HI>divine law</HI> written upon them; that they have hopes and fears, relating to invisible powers, and a future and invisible state. They have naturally <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>joy,</HI> when they are conscious of having acted up to the moral law of their nature; and <HI>fears</HI> and <HI>forebodings</HI> of punishment, when they grossly violate the laws of their own minds. In other words; it appears, that they are <HI>moral agents, accountable creatures,</HI> under law to GOD; and that they know they are responsible to him for their moral actions. But there is not the least evidence or appearance of this among the brute creation. Now if GOD has implanted <HI>this law, this moral sense,
<PB N="111" REF="014137_0110_0F97D4F3F3C4FDA0"/>these hopes and fears</HI> in human souls, as the law of their nature; is it to be thought, that they are vain and false, and have no real objects?</P>
<P N="10">10. THE spirits of brutes do not seem capable of im∣provement: Whatever they <HI>know</HI> and <HI>do</HI> seems to be by <HI>instinct.</HI> The bird builds her nest as ingeniously the <HI>first year,</HI> without any instruction, as she does after the ex∣perience of <HI>ten years;</HI> and knows her food, her enemies and resources as well. But the soul of man is capable of daily improvement, not only in <HI>virtue,</HI> but in the <HI>knowledge of arts and sciences.</HI> Is it not likely then, that <HI>human souls</HI> are made for <HI>noble ends,</HI> and for <HI>higher enjoy∣ments,</HI> even for an <HI>immortal, ever improving duration?</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. THE generality of men of all nations, even the most ignorant and barbarous, have believed the immor∣tality of the soul, and this universal belief, must be sup∣posed founded on <HI>some obvious principles,</HI> level to the ca∣pacity of all, which is a strong presumption that it is <HI>true</HI> and <HI>founded in nature.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. MEN in general have <HI>a strong desire,</HI> and a fond hope of immortality; and the more virtuous and holy they are, the more earnest is this hope and desire of im∣mortality: But would a <HI>good</HI> GOD provide gratifications for all the natural desires of the lowest order of creatures, and leave this noblest appetite in man ungratified?— or would he inspire the <HI>holiest</HI> and <HI>best of men</HI> with <HI>pantings, breathings</HI> and <HI>earnest longings,</HI> which are <HI>vain, imaginary</HI> and <HI>delusive?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. IT seems not consistent with the divine goodness to form so excellent a creature as man, for so short <HI>a duration</HI> and such <HI>low employments,</HI> as are to be met with in this life. Is it reasonable to imagine, that the hu∣man soul, by the time its noble saculties just begin to be cultivated and fitted for noble pleasures and enjoyments, should be extinguished and cut off for ever?</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="112" REF="014137_0111_0F97D4F4BA540D78"/>
14. GOOD men desire nothing so much as to enjoy GOD more perfectly than they can in their life; and the more they love GOD, the more eager and unsatisfied is this desire in their souls. Nay, this desire, is the fruit of GOD'S grace in them, and of his own planting. But if the human soul is not immortal, the best of men, can never obtain their <HI>noblest desire,</HI> and the <HI>highest enjoyment</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> of which their nature is capable.</P>
<P N="15">15. IF the soul were mortal, a desperate villain might deprive the most virtuous man of <HI>his being,</HI> and of all the future rewards of his virtue: But is it consistent with the justice and goodness of GOD, that this should be in the power of a bad man?</P>
<P N="16">16. IF GOD is a just governor of his rational crea∣tures, the <HI>virtuous must</HI> and <HI>will</HI> be rewarded according to their works, and the <HI>wicked</HI> punished according to theirs: But we are sure this does not always happen in the present life; therefore, there must be a <HI>future state</HI> of retribution, and consequently human souls are im∣mortal.</P>
<P N="17">17. OUR Lord Jesus Christ has put this doctrine be∣yond all doubt, having brought life and immortality to light by his gospel. The whole of his religion; all his threatnings and promises, his rewards and punishments, go upon this suppuration, and all his discourses and pa∣rables are full of it.</P>
<P N="18">18. CHRIST's raising the dead bodies of many, and rising himself from the dead; also, the appearance of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> to the disciples on the <HI>mount of transfigu∣ration,</HI> were so many occular demonstrations of the im∣mortality of the soul, and that its existence depends not on the life of the body.</P>
<P N="19">19. IT is no objection to this important doctrine, that the faculties of the souls of <HI>aged</HI> or <HI>sick persons,</HI> are <HI>impaired</HI> and <HI>infeebled</HI> by the diseases and decays of the body; seeing the soul must exert its faculties <HI>by</HI> and
<PB N="113" REF="014137_0112_0F97D4F574AA5C60"/><HI>through</HI> the bodily organs. On the contrary also, the souls of some men are uncommonly active and vigorous when their bodies are in the deepest decays, and just at the point of death.</P>
<P N="20">20. IF our souls are indeed immortal, and must live for ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>happy or miserable, is there any care or con∣cern in this life a thousandth part so important to man, as to provide for the future happiness of his immortal soul?</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XIX. <HI>Of</HI> DEATH.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THOUGH we can hardly conceive of the <HI>na∣tural immortality</HI> of a body composed of <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>blood;</HI> yet GOD could doubtless have made our bo∣dies immortal, if he had so pleased. And had we con∣tinued in a state of innocence, there is no doubt but that we would have been immortal; for this seems implied in the promise of the covenant of works.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHETHER this reward and privilege of innocent man, would have been an immortality on earth or in heaven, is no where plainly revealed.</P>
<P N="3">3. THOUGH man was <HI>naturally mortal;</HI> yet GOD could have preserved him from death, by the salubriety of the air and water, the wholesome, restorative and medicinal quality of the fruits of the earth, and that composure and equability of the passions and affections, resulting from the innocency and perfection of the soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. SOME have supposed, that the <HI>tree of life,</HI> from which man was excluded by sin, had, in its fruit, the
<PB N="114" REF="014137_0113_0F97D4F63383C268"/><HI>preternatural quality</HI> of preserving man immortal, so long as he had access to eat it: Others, that it was a <HI>sacra∣mental pledge</HI> of his immortality so long as he continued in a state of innocence.</P>
<P N="5">5. HOWEVER these things may be, yet we are assur∣ed both from scripture and experience, that <HI>fallen, sinful</HI> man, is <HI>mortal;</HI> that death is the <HI>wages</HI> and <HI>consequent</HI> of <HI>sin</HI> in all the race; and that death hath passed upon <HI>all,</HI> because <HI>all have sinned</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ii. 17. Rom. v. 12. Job xxi. 23. Heb. ix. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. As death is the <HI>wages of sin,</HI> and by the unalterable purpose of GOD, all men are doomed to die; so a great many <HI>second causes</HI> may have concurred to secure the ac∣complishment of this purpose; as the curse of the earth, poisoning its fruits with the seeds of death; the baneful influences of the accursed air upon our lungs and juices; the intemperature of the seasons, and the quick successions from wet to dry, and from extreme heat to extreme cold; the exorbitancy and irregularity of our passions and appetites through sin; the sickly and enfeebled constitutions of our forefathers, and the like.</P>
<P N="7">7. WITH regard to beasts, we suppose death to put a period to their pains, pleasures and very beings. But, as it is attended with some degree of pain, and deprives these creatures of being, and many pleasurable enjoy∣ments, religion and even humanity should restrain us from giving them unnecessary pain, and much more from taking away their lives, where necessity, or the law of self-preservation, does not require it.</P>
<P N="8">8. WITH regard to man, <HI>death</HI> in itself considered, or the <HI>mere separation of soul and body,</HI> ought not to be greatly dreaded, as probably the pain of it is much smaller than we imagine: But what renders death peculiarly impor∣tant and formidable to man, is its <HI>awful consequences.</HI> <Q>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="115" REF="014137_0114_0F97D4F6F36CB410"/>
9. "THE sting of death is sin." A consciousness of guilt, of exposedness to an impartial judgment, eternal banishment from GOD, and the positive inflictions of his wrath, render death extremely formidable to the <HI>wicked,</HI> as it must be to <HI>such,</HI> the period of all their pleasurable enjoyments, and the commencement of eternal mi∣sery.</P>
<P N="10">10. EVEN nature, in good men, has an abhorrence of death, in itself considered, as we may learn from the Apostle himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 2.</NOTE>; because, say some, death is <HI>unnatural,</HI> being no part of the original constitution, but an <HI>adven∣titious</HI> consequent upon sin, and part of the punishment of it. But many other reasons may be assigned for this, such as the natural fear of the pain of dying, our unac∣quaintedness with the separate state and invisible world, and remaining doubts of their unpreparedness, with ma∣ny. Besides, the soul and body, who have been long such close and intimate companions, must naturally have a reluctance to part from each other, though but for a season.</P>
<P N="11">11. IT is the peculiar privilege of the <HI>righteous,</HI> that death will redound to their unspeakable advantage.— <HI>Death is theirs,</HI> as the Apostle emphatically expresses it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 22.</NOTE>. <HI>To them to die, is gain</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THE sting of death is taken away, in their justi∣fication: For, after rational evidence, that a person is pardoned, and restored to the favour of GOD, there is no more rational ground for the <HI>fear of death;</HI> as that <HI>sense of guilt</HI> and <HI>fear of punishment</HI> which are the sting of death are taken away, and such a person has ground for that triumphant exultation; <Q>O death, where is thy sting! O grave, where is thy victory<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="116" REF="014137_0115_0F97D4F7B4F78648"/>
(2.) DEATH changes its nature to the righte∣ous, and, of an <HI>enemy</HI> becomes a <HI>friend.</HI> The <HI>king of ter∣rors</HI> is changed into a <HI>messenger of divine love:</HI> As, <HI>first,</HI> It frees them from all misery, and from the remainder of indwelling corruption. It ends the mortal strife and conflict, and gives them a complete victory and triumph over every enemy. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It fits and qualifies them for farther and higher communion with Christ in glory. When they are <HI>absent from the body,</HI> they are <HI>present with the Lord;</HI> see him face to face, and enjoy him perfectly without a <HI>medium.</HI> It enlarges and qualifies the soul for more perfect communion with, and the more perfect en∣joyment of GOD, <HI>Christ, angels</HI> and <HI>blessed spirits.</HI> And, as <HI>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven,</HI> it pre∣pares the body for putting on a spiritual and immortal form, without which it could not be fitted for heaven.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE change of those who shall be alive at the resurrection and second coming of Christ, will be equiva∣lent to death: There appearing no reason why such should be privileged above their fellow creatures.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE translation of <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah,</HI> are the only two exceptions from the universal mortality of the hu∣man kind; and perhaps were intended as demonstrative proofs of an unseen world.</P>
<P N="14">14. THOUGH death will be certain gain to the righte∣ous; yet a longer continuance in the present life may be beneficial to many of them, and answer great and im∣portant purposes in the scheme of providence: Where∣fore, an absolute and impatient desire of death, or pe∣remptory prayers for it, are not commendable in good men; but all lawful means to preserve and prolong life ought to be used by them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. i. 21,—26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INFERENCES. 1st, How ought a sense of universal mortality to <HI>humble</HI> the <HI>pride of man;</HI> and especially that arising from <HI>birth, honour, power, wealth, riches</HI> and <HI>nobi∣lity?</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="014137_0116_0F97D4F873A3A678"/>We have surely no reason to be vain or proud of any thing, of which death can rob us.</P>
<P N="2">2. How <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>ridiculous,</HI> yea, and <HI>unhappy</HI> a thing would man be, if he were wholly under the dominion of death, and had no claim to immortality?</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the consideration of death, the greatest of all natural evils, and from its <HI>universality,</HI> we may infer, the great evil of sin, from which it took its rise.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM the shortness and uncertainty of life, and the importance of it, as a state of probation for eternity, we should learn the importance of improving our time, and the great guilt and solly of lavishing and squander∣ing it in foolish and vain, and much more in sinful amuse∣ments and pleasures<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc. 12.—xxxix. 4.5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF death be so important in its consequences, how dreadful a thing is murder? and how cautious and cir∣cumspect ought judges and juries to be in matters of life and death?</P>
<P N="6">6. How desperately mad is the wretch who is acces∣sory to his own death, by which, he not only deprives himself and the world of all the benefits and advantages of his life, but plunges into an awful eternity, under all the irremissible guilt of suicide.</P>

<P N="1">1. THIS is a doctrine of <HI>pure revelation,</HI> seeing there is no principle or appearance in nature, from whence it can be rationally inferred.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE instance of a grain of corn dying in the earth before it springs, and like instances, are good <HI>illustrations</HI> of the doctrine already revealed, and shew that the thing is neither <HI>impossible</HI> nor <HI>absurd;</HI> but cannot prove it.</P>
<P N="3">3.

5. THE resurrection body will be the <HI>same in substance</HI> with that which died, but will have <HI>far different qualities,</HI> suited to the state and place of retribution: For, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; neither is it conceivable that they should long endure the torments of hell, unconsumed, without a perpetual miracle.

<HEAD>ESSAY XXI. <HI>Of a</HI> FUTURE JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment, Heb. ix. 27.</P>
<P N="2">2. MANY of the arguments for the immortality of the soul, equally prove a judgment to come; such as the <HI>moral agency</HI> and <HI>accountableness</HI> of man; the operations of his conscience and moral sense; his unacountable <HI>hopes</HI> and <HI>fears</HI> respecting an invisible power and a future state; the unequal distribution of rewards and punish∣ments
<PB N="120" REF="014137_0119_0F97D4FAB532BA88"/>according to men's moral characters in this present state, and the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is remarkable also, that a belief of a judgment to come, and a future state of rewards and punishments, according to men's present behaviour, has been as <HI>univer∣sal,</HI> as the belief of the soul's immortality; and is in∣deed grounded on the same general principles.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE holy scriptures <HI>fully, clearly,</HI> and <HI>circumstantial∣ly</HI> establish and teach this doctrine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jude 14. and Eccles. xii. 14. Matth. xxv. Rev. xii. and xxii. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. GOD will judge the world by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by whom he <HI>made</HI> and <HI>governs</HI> it, and by whom he has re∣deemed it. There is a great and evident propriety in this, from many reasons too tedious here to mention. This also tends powerfully to prove the <HI>real divinity</HI> and <HI>infinite perfection</HI> of our Redeemer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 31. 2 Cor. v. 10. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. CHRIST at the day of judgment, will descend from heaven, in visible pomp and splendour inexpressible; clothed with his own glory, his Father's glory, and attend∣ed with all the shining retinue of heaven;—will seat himself on a glorious white throne in the lower heavens, and having summoned before him, the whole rational creation, <HI>angels, men,</HI> and <HI>devils,</HI> will judge and sentence them according to their respective works and charac∣ters<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 26.

<P N="7">7.

WE have already supposed, that the souls of the righteous, during the whole intermediate state, from the article of death, to the day of judgment, are in a <HI>place</HI> and <HI>state</HI> of blessedness,—called in scripture <HI>Paradise, Abraham's bosom, heaven,</HI> and the like; though it is uncertain, whether this be the same place and state into which they will enter after the final judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOUGH the sight of their descending Redeemer, and their being placed on his right hand before the judgment seat, will fill the righteous with inexpressible joy; yet the sentence passed on them after judgment, <Q>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, &amp;c.</Q>—may be properly deemed the <HI>first part</HI> of their <HI>public triumph,</HI> and of the <HI>honour</HI> conferred upon them be∣fore the assembled world: This being the <HI>first declaration</HI> of their title to the eternal joys of their Lord, in conse∣quence of their judgment and acquittance.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEY will then go away with Christ and the holy
<PB N="122" REF="014137_0121_0F97D4FC34A1C910"/>angels into <HI>life eternal,</HI> where they will ever be with each other, and with their dearest Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE must consider heaven both as a <HI>place</HI> and a <HI>state</HI> of blessedness; but <HI>where</HI> this place, or <HI>what</HI> this state precisely is, we are not at present permitted to know.</P>
<P N="5">5. AS Christ has, and the saints will have <HI>glorious bo∣dies,</HI> there must needs be a <HI>local heaven,</HI> or <HI>some place</HI> where these bodies will <HI>be</HI> and <HI>reside.</HI> But whether the whole universe may not be turned into a heaven to them; or whether any particular part of it may be appropriated for their peculiar residence, is what we cannot certainly tell. True, the heaven of the saints is termed a <HI>city,</HI> the <HI>New Jerusalem, mansions in</HI> GOD<HI>'S house, sure habitations,</HI> and the like; but for all we know, these may be only <HI>figu∣rative expressions.</HI> GOD may create a heaven around his saints wherever they are, even in hell; and they may have intimate communion with each other, from the most distant parts of the universe. The <HI>angels</HI> always behold the face of GOD in heaven, and yet they are re∣presented as ministring to the saints on earth. Where∣ever GOD graciously communicates himself to his ration∣al creatures, there is heaven; and, as GOD is immense and infinite, his creatures can no where be out of his immediate presence.</P>
<P N="6">6. HEAVEN, wherever it is, must be a <HI>glorious place,</HI> adorned with every thing which can gratify and delight the refined and heavenly senses of glorified and spiritu∣alized bodies; and as, in our perfect glorious state, we may have a great many <HI>more</HI> and <HI>different</HI> senses and <HI>capa∣cities,</HI> than what we have at present, and all these may have their proper and adapted gratifications; therefore, it is impossible for us to conceive at present any thing of the glory and happiness of that place, which <HI>eye hath not seen, nor car heard,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="123" REF="014137_0122_0F97D4FCF42B58C0"/>
7. BUT we can at present conceive something of the <HI>heavenly state,</HI> as a state of <HI>perfect holiness,</HI> exempt from all sin and misery; and indeed, good men enjoy something of heaven in this sense of the word, or have some fore∣tastes or prelibations of it in their souls, in this life.</P>
<P N="8">8. HEAVEN is a state of <HI>improved knowledge</HI> and <HI>perfect holiness.</HI> The glorified saints do <HI>see</HI> and <HI>know</HI> GOD <HI>intui∣tively,</HI> in his own nature, and in a spiritual manner, as one spirit may be supposed to see and know another. They also have a clear discernment of the wisdom and contrivance of his works, and of the holiness, justice and equity of his ways and providences; which is a kind and degree of knowledge we cannot attain to in this life, and which must afford inexpressible happiness to the mind, by delightfully gratifying its noblest powers. The righteous in heaven are also <HI>altogether holy;</HI> have no propensity to sin; no struggles with corruption; no conflict with temptation; no remorse for guilt, nor any fear of displeasing GOD, or enduring his displeasure. They <HI>clearly see</HI> and <HI>know</HI> GOD, and therefore they per∣fectly <HI>love</HI> and <HI>admire</HI> him. They know the equity of his laws and the beauty of holiness, and therefore they cannot but delightfully obey him and work holiness, and can be in no danger of inclining to the hateful ways of sin. Besides, enjoying so glorious a reward of holiness, and seeing sin so dreadfully punished in the damned, they are everlastingly guarded against the love of sin in the most powerful manner imaginable.</P>
<P N="9">9. AS GOD is the perfection of beauty, and the source of all blessedness and comfort, so the highest part of our heavenly blessedness will consist in the <HI>contemplation</HI> and <HI>enjoyment</HI> of him. In <HI>knowing him,</HI> we shall <HI>know all truth,</HI> and in <HI>enjoying</HI> him we shall <HI>enjoy all good</HI> and <HI>happiness;</HI> for there is neither <HI>truth</HI> nor <HI>happiness</HI> but <HI>in</HI> and <HI>from</HI> him; so that he must ever be the <HI>supreme good</HI> and <HI>chief p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion</HI> of our souls: Besides, that the knowledge and enjoy∣ment
<PB N="124" REF="014137_0123_0F97D4FDB3499BB0"/>of GOD are <HI>transforming</HI> and <HI>assimulating;</HI> so that to <HI>know</HI> and <HI>enjoy him,</HI> is to <HI>be like him;</HI> and to <HI>be like him</HI> in our measure, is to be <HI>as holy, happy</HI> and <HI>glorious,</HI> as our nature will admit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE presence and enjoyment of Christ and of the holy Ghost, will also be prime ingredients in our hea∣venly blessedness. Indeed, in enjoying <HI>them,</HI> we enjoy GOD<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 17, 18. Phil. i. 23. 2 Cor. v. 5,—8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="11">11. NOR need we scruple to suppose, that the sweet fellowship and communion of <HI>angels</HI> and <HI>saints,</HI> more especially those whom we have <HI>known</HI> and <HI>loved</HI> on earth, will be ingredients in our heavenly blessedness. <Q>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living GOD, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels; to the general as∣sembly and church of the first-born, which are writ∣ten in heaven, and to GOD the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Able<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Heb. xii. 22, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="12">12. THE happiness of the righteous will be <HI>eternal.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. IT shall also, in all probability, be <HI>ever improv∣ing,</HI> as they grow in knowledge and holiness.</P>
<P N="14">14. IT is highly probable, that there will be different degrees of glory in heaven, according to the different degrees of holiness among GOD'S children on earth<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 41, 42. Matth. xxv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="15">15. WE should now have our conversation in hea∣ven, and be preparing for that blessed place and state: For, how sad a case will it be, if we are describing that blessedness which we shall never enjoy, nor even see, but at an unapproachable distance, as the rich man did <HI>Laza∣rus,</HI> through the impassable gulph.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIII. <HI>Of</HI> HELL, <HI>or the</HI> PLACE <HI>and</HI> STATE <HI>of the</HI> WICKED.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ALTHOUGH the wicked carry hell in their consciences from the moment of their death, and are probably doomed to herd among the devils, and to share in their present punishments; yet their rising from their graves in <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>deformity;</HI> their ranking themselves on the left hand of the judge, and more espe∣cially their receiving that awful sentence; <Q>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</Q> may be reckoned the begin∣ning of their <HI>hell,</HI> or <HI>eternal torments</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 41. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HELL is both a <HI>place</HI> and a <HI>state.</HI> The <HI>place</HI> or <HI>locality</HI> of hell cannot be doubted after the resurrection, as the bodies of the wicked must needs be in some place. Be∣sides, the scriptures represent it as <Q>a lake of fire and brimstone; a fire prepared for the devil and his an∣gels,</Q> and the like;—and <HI>Dives</HI> is represented as lift∣ing up his eyes, being in torments; and an <HI>impassable gulph</HI> is said to be fixed between him and <HI>Lazarus.</HI> But whether the souls of the wicked are now, in their inter∣mediate state, confined to any such place, is a question not easy or needful to be answered. Some think, that they and the devils are suffered to roam at large through the universe. Let it suffice us to know, that wherever they are, it is hell with them. They are under a pain∣ful sense of the divine displeasure, and have a dreadful expectation of the judgment, and of greater miseries yet to come.</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE have been many vain speculations about the <HI>place</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of hell's torments. Some have
<PB N="126" REF="014137_0125_0F97D4FF335E11F8"/>thought it absurd to suppose, that the positive torments of damned spirits, of the devil and his angels, should be excited <HI>by material fire.</HI> But if we consider, that it is our <HI>spirits</HI> which feel the pain of burning through our bodies, we shall not think it incredible, that GOD should excite the same idea of pain from sire in <HI>pure spirits,</HI> without the intervention of bodies. However, fire may be only <HI>figuratively</HI> used, to signify the most intense pain and torments. And as for the <HI>place</HI> of the damned, it bet∣ter becomes us to endeavour to shun it, than curiously to enquire <HI>where</HI> or <HI>what</HI> it is.</P>
<P N="4">4. AT the resurrection of the wicked, their souls be∣ing united to their bodies, they shall be judged; and that awful sentence being passed upon them, <Q>Depart from me ye cursed, &amp;c.</Q> they shall be dragged away by devils, and with them, shut up in the prison of hell; thus sharing in the punishment of those with whom they apostatized.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT appears from scripture, that the misery of the damned will be <HI>properly eternal, everlasting fire;</HI> a <HI>worm that dieth not,</HI> and <HI>a fire that is</HI> not <HI>quenched.</HI> It appears agreeable to reason also, that creatures who have despised and rejected <HI>an everlasting heaven of blessedness,</HI> should have <HI>an everlasting hell of misery;</HI> and that those who have slighted the glorious hope set before them, should inhe∣rit endless despair, which, indeed, upon the whole, was <HI>their own choice</HI> and <HI>preference.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. AS to the <HI>state</HI> of <HI>hell,</HI> or rather of <HI>the damned,</HI> it a∣rises in a great measure from their own wicked and hellish dispositions, which cannot admit of happiness, but are naturally productive of misery. A wicked man is, and must be <HI>a hell to himself.</HI> He is <HI>self-fitted</HI> and <HI>prepared to this destruction;</HI> and he needs only to be out of the body, and out of a capacity of tasting GOD'S goodness, to be in <HI>hell,</HI> and to be equally a <HI>devil.</HI> So that repentance of sin, and
<PB N="127" REF="014137_0126_0F97D5010E2C0D40"/>holiness, are in their own nature, necessary to deliver men from hell, and to qualify them for happiness.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE chief ingredients in the miseries of the dam∣ned, are, (1.) Their being banished from the presence and enjoyment of GOD, the fountain of happiness:— (2.) The society of <HI>devils</HI> and other damned spirits, who will be continually upbraiding them, and exciting their hellish passions:—(3.) A remembrance of the good things of this life which they have lost, and a sense of their desperate madness in rejecting that eternal blessed∣ness which they might have enjoyed, for the meerest trifles:—(4.) Envy at the happiness of the blessed:— (5.) A painful sense of GOD'S wrath, and the infliction of positive torments from the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power;—and <HI>finally,</HI> despair of ever seeing an end of their misery—with, perhaps—a conti∣nual increase and aggravation of it, from their increasing wickedness and guilt.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF any thing can awaken our fears, surely it ought to be a dread of our falling into this place of torment<NOTE N="*">Luke xii. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIV. <HI>What, as</HI> CHRISTIANS, <HI>we ought to do more than others, from Matth.</HI> v. 47.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>other</HI> mentioned here, are <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>sinners,</HI> and imply all the <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>profane,</HI> and all <HI>hypo∣crites</HI> and formal, insincere professors of religion: And it is plainly supposed, that the true and sincere disciples
<PB N="128" REF="014137_0127_0F97D501BB4EA9B8"/>of Christ, who hope for salvation through faith in him and obedience to his gospel, must do much more, and go much farther in the duties of religion and sound mora∣lity, than these. The following may serve as a few illustrations of this observation.</P>
<P N="1">1. OTHERS, even <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>sinners may</HI> and <HI>do</HI> love those that love them: But we must love and wish well to our enemies; pray for them and do them good.</P>
<P N="2">2. OTHERS <HI>may</HI> and <HI>do</HI> take some care of the decency of their outward behaviour, that they may be accept∣able before men: But we must watch over the most hidden movements, thoughts and desires of our hearts; —labour to approve ourselves to the eye of GOD, and to keep consciences, as well as appearances, void of offence both towards GOD and man.</P>
<P N="3">3. OTHERS will <HI>sometimes</HI> mind religion when they have nothing else to do, either for their worldly plea∣sure or profit: But we must make religion the <HI>principal leading</HI> business of our lives, to which all things must give way.</P>
<P N="4">4. OTHERS perform the duties of religion, as a <HI>disagreeable task,</HI> either to stand fair in the opini∣on of men, or to satisfy the importunate demands of conscience: But we must <HI>delight</HI> and <HI>rejoice</HI> in them, as our most sweet and pleasurable enjoyments.</P>
<P N="5">5. OTHERS are ever contriving <HI>how little</HI> they may do in religion, in order to shun hell: But we must be am∣bitious to <HI>abound in good works,</HI> that we may the more please and honour GOD, and enjoy a greater measure of his likeness and favour.</P>
<P N="6">6. OTHERS, walking by sight and sense, take up their rest and portion in the things and enjoyments of this world; ever anxiously enquiring who will shew them any earthly good:—But, living and walking by the faith of unseen things, we must make GOD our <HI>only portion</HI> and <HI>in∣heritance,</HI> seeking and delighting in the uplifting of his
<PB N="129" REF="014137_0128_0F97D50234190558"/>countenance, and the manifestation of his reconciled fa∣vour.</P>
<P N="7">7. OTHERS are most curious in knowing and studying the characters and concerns of their neighbours: But we must be most diligent in the study and knowledge of ourselves and of <HI>our own proper concerns.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. OTHERS are indulgent and favourable to them∣selves and their own failings, while they are severe and unmerciful observers and censurers of the sins and fail∣ings of their neighbours: But we must be <HI>severe to our∣selves,</HI> and <HI>charitable</HI> in our judgment of <HI>others, hoping all things</HI> and <HI>believing all things</HI> in favour of our neighbour.</P>
<P N="9">9. OTHERS, even <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>sinners,</HI> may and do of∣ten attend the duties of public religion: But, we must also be found conscientious in the religion of the <HI>family</HI> and <HI>closet;</HI> in the duties of <HI>private</HI> and <HI>secret</HI> devotion.</P>
<P N="10">10. OTHERS perform <HI>some duties,</HI> and deny <HI>some sins:</HI> But we must be governed throughout by a principle of <HI>uniform obedience;</HI> hating every false way, and having an equal respect to all GOD'S commandments, as <HI>holy, just</HI> and <HI>good.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. OTHERS square their religion by the fashion and custom of the places where they live: But ours must be <HI>unfashionably singular</HI> in this respect, being wholly measur∣ed by the law of GOD, which is the only rule and mo∣del of our obedience.</P>
<P N="12">12. OTHERS are discouraged and disheartened from duty by the reproaches and persecutions of the wicked: But we must learn to <HI>glory in the cross,</HI> and to <HI>rejoice in suf∣ferings</HI> and <HI>persecutions</HI> for the sake of Christ.</P>
<P N="13">13. OTHERS will <HI>sin</HI> rather than <HI>suffer:</HI> But we must <HI>suffer</HI> rather than <HI>sin.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. OTHERS render evil for evil, and railing for railing: But if we would be the true disciples of Christ, we must render <HI>good</HI> for <HI>evil,</HI> after the most amiable and perfect example of him, who, <Q>when he was reviled,
<PB N="130" REF="014137_0129_0F97D502F3B18D10"/>reviled not again: when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righte∣ously<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 23.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="15">15. OTHERS are indulgent to their <HI>favourite sins</HI> and <HI>beloved lusts:</HI> But we must be particularly severe against <HI>these, plucking out the right eye,</HI> and <HI>cutting off the right hand.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. OTHERS love their flatterers: But we must love our well designing reprovers.</P>
<P N="17">17. OTHERS accept of Christ as a <HI>Saviour from hell:</HI> But we must also accept him as a <HI>Saviour from sin;</HI> em∣bracing him in all his offices, as a <HI>king</HI> to rule us, and a <HI>prophet</HI> to teach us, as well as a <HI>priest</HI> to offer himself an atonement, and intercede for us.</P>
<P N="18">18. OTHERS are for a <HI>cheap</HI> and <HI>easy</HI> religion which costs them little labour or self-denial: But we must chuse a self-denying religion; a <HI>painful, ailigent, laborious</HI> course in the service of GOD.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXV. <HI>Of</HI> HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS, <HI>and the contrary</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS is a very comprehen∣sive virtue, and essentially necessary to every Christian. It consists in the prevailing bent and ten∣dency of the mind and heart towards GOD, and the things of God and heaven; and is directly opposed to <HI>worldly-mindedness, earthly-mindedness, covetousness</HI> and <HI>sensua∣lity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS necessarily presupposes <HI>regeneration, conversion,</HI> a change of mind and heart be re∣newing grace, or a sanctified nature, in some degree at least; for every man, by nature, is <HI>earthly, sensual, devil∣ish,</HI> not having the Spirit of GOD;—seeing that that which is born of the flesh <HI>is</HI> and <HI>must be flesh;</HI>—and see∣ing that the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>unrenewed</HI> mind, is <HI>enmity against</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS will principally shew it∣self in the following instances:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IN a supreme regard to GOD above the crea∣ture. The heavenly-minded man loves GOD and the Saviour, although unseen, above all things in this world, by means of that faith which is the evidence of things not seen, and the substance of things hoped for. No object of sight or sense so strongly moves the noblest affections of his soul, or so powerfully elicites and draws forth his defires, as an invisible GOD, and an exalted Redeemer, whom having not seen, he loves, and in whom, although now he sees them not, he yet rejoices with joy unspeakable and full of glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 8.</NOTE>. Tell the
<PB N="132" REF="014137_0131_0F97D504735C5890"/>heavenly-minded man of enjoying riches, power, pomp or honour;—recount to him the various gratifications and pleasures of sense—of women, wine, luxurious and delicate living;—place his affections to all these, and desires of enjoying them, over against his love of an unseen GOD and Saviour, and his desire of enjoying them;—put it to his choice, and he will despise the <HI>for∣mer,</HI> in comparrison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. iv. 6, 7.—xlii. 1,—4.—lxiii. 1, &amp;c.—lxxiii. 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THE heavenly-minded man sees and enjoys GOD in his <HI>works</HI> and <HI>providences.</HI> His mind is turned to a contemplation of GOD in his vast and wonderful works. In these he has a deep and affecting conviction of the power, wisdom and goodness of him who made them all. He tastes the goodness of GOD in every en∣joyment of sense; in every pleasure and refreshment. He eyes and enjoys GOD in every dispensation of pro∣vidence. He receives every mercy as the gift of GOD, and a fresh obligation to gratitude, love and praise; and hears the voice of GOD in every affliction, reprov∣ing, chastening and calling him home from sin, or quickening him to the performance of some long-ne∣glected duty.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE heavenly-minded man, converses with, and enjoys GOD, in his <HI>word</HI> and <HI>ordinances.</HI> He reads the scriptures diligently, with correspondent holy affections; with gratitude and spiritual desire and appetite. He hears GOD speaking to his soul in them; trembles at his word; delights in the purity of his laws, humbly submits to their authority, and feeds pleasurably upon his promises and offers of mercy. He frequents ordi∣nances, with no other view than to <HI>glorify</HI> and <HI>enjoy</HI> GOD in them. In <HI>prayer,</HI> he really, humbly and delightfully converses with GOD. In <HI>praise</HI> his soul exalts and mag∣nifies the Almighty. He hears sermons that he may
<PB N="133" REF="014137_0132_0F97D5053363C300"/>the better know GOD, and his duty, and love them; and that he may, by this means, cleanse his way, re∣form his life, and get strength for both. He prepares for sacraments and attends them, that he may actually renew his covenant with GOD, and receive comfort and strength to keep it stedfastly: And he has a pleasure and delight in these duties, superior to any which he feels in the enjoyments of this earth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxvii. 4, 5.—lxiii. 1, 2.—lxv. 4.—lxxxiv. —xix. 7,—10.—cxix. 73, 127.—cxxii. 1,—4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THE heavenly-minded man has a turn for spiri∣tualizing all the common occurrences and events of life. He is disposed to give a useful and edifying turn to every topic of conversation; and to profit even by the worst, or most common things that happen to himself, or to others around him. It would be endless to illus∣trate this remark.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) THE heavenly-minded man, having his conver∣sation, his heart, his hopes, his treasure, and the object of his dearest love, and strongest desire in heaven, must needs have a peculiar and uncommon delight in those companions, and in that kind of conference and dis∣course, which are employed about spiritual and hea∣venly things. Companions and conversation of this kind, exactly hit his taste, as his mind is high and heavenly bent. This is so just and obvious a character of hea∣venly mindedness, that it needs no farther confirmation or illustration.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) THE heavenly-minded man may be said to live by the faith and hope of unseen and heavenly things. He considers this world but as a wilderness through which he is journeying towards his Father's house, and eternal inheritance. Hence, present things affect him but little, as present conveniences would a travelling wayfaring man. He had rather have them than want them; but
<PB N="134" REF="014137_0133_0F97D505F36A1818"/>if he suffers a little in his journey, he cares not much for it. His Father, his Redeemer and almighty friend, and his brethren and sisters in Christ which has left this world, are in heaven before him; his treasure is there; his rest, reward, crown, and inheritance are there.— His heart therefore must be there also.—He is there∣fore <HI>habitually, believingly, hopefully</HI> and <HI>joyfully</HI> looking for∣ward to his journey's end. And indeed, the more eager∣ly that the eye of his faith and hope is fixed upon the heavenly prize, <HI>i. e.</HI> the more heavenly-minded he is, the less will he regard or mind the things that are around him, or the cross accidents that happen to him on his journey thither. Hence it follows; that he walks by <HI>faith,</HI> not by <HI>sight;</HI> looketh not on the things that are seen and temporal, but at the things which are unseen and eternal;—setteth his affection on things above, and not on things below. His fears and cares, hopes and desires, sorrows and joys, are chiefly of the <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>heavenly</HI> kind, and but <HI>little, seldom,</HI> and <HI>moderately</HI> moved about this world, and the things of it, which pass away. On the contrary, earthly-mindedness, discovers itself by the following marks:—A loving and preferring the creature above GOD;—the body and its concerns above the soul and its interest;—earth above heaven;—the objects and enjoyments of sight and sense, above those of faith and hope. The earthly-minded man, prefers mo∣ney before grace;—earthly honour above heavenly;— the favour of men before that of GOD;—a good living in this world, before the hopes of heavenly blessedness. He is little moved by the <HI>works</HI> or <HI>providences</HI> of GOD; little affected by <HI>his word;</HI>—little delighted with <HI>his or∣dinances</HI> or <HI>people;</HI> has no pleasurable relish for holiness itself, or the means of attaining it: But performs these, if he does perform them at all, in a <HI>customary, formal, earnal, lifeless</HI> manner, to stop the mouth of conscience;
<PB N="135" REF="014137_0134_0F97D506B374C290"/>to please the world and promote worldly ends; or to be seen and praised of men.</P>

GOSPEL sincerity is expressed by two words: —The <HI>first</HI> signifies <Q>a thing which will stand the test, if it is examined or judged of by the light of the sun, <HI>eilikrinia,</HI></Q> and is used by the Apostle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 8.</NOTE>, when he commands the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth; or it may al∣lude to the judgment passed on grain when it is win∣nowed, which will bear winnowing, and being sepa∣rated from the chaff, looks the better.—Sincerity is something which will stand the test.—The other word is <HI>aplotes</HI> which is commonly translated <HI>simplicity;</HI> which signifies, a <HI>thing without folds,</HI> and intimates <HI>an open</HI> and <HI>undisguised</HI> behaviour, without <HI>deceit, guile, or dis∣simulation. —Thus</HI> we are commanded to have our conversa∣tion in this world in <HI>simplicity and godly sincerity;</HI> not with <HI>worldly</HI> or <HI>knavish</HI> and <HI>deceitful</HI> wisdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 12.</NOTE>. And according to this sense of the word we are commanded to lay aside <HI>all guile</HI> and <HI>hypocrisy</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 1.</NOTE>. And the man is pronounced bles∣sed in whose spirit there is <HI>no guile</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxii. 2.</NOTE>. And <HI>Nathaniel</HI> is pronounced an Israelite indeed, in whom was <HI>no guile;</HI> —that is, a <HI>plain man,</HI> as <HI>Jacob</HI> is called<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">John. i. 47. Gen. xxv. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="136" REF="014137_0135_0F97D507736DE8A8"/>
2. GOSPEL sincerity supposes a single aim and inten∣tion of pleasing GOD, in the whole of our course. And although this intention may not be actually alive in our hearts, as the moving and producing cause of every single action; yet if we are <HI>sincere,</HI> it must be our <HI>habi∣tual, prevailing intention;</HI> and wherever we have time to <HI>doubt</HI> or <HI>deliberate</HI> about the nature of any action, this must be our <HI>actual intention</HI> in it; and that nothing con∣trary to this intention prevails with us. This is includ∣ed in these general precepts of Christianity—<Q>Whe∣ther ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of GOD.—Whatever we do, we do it unto the Lord, and not unto men.—Servants be obedient to your masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ; doing the will of GOD from the heart; with good will do∣ing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 5,—9. Col. iii. 22,—24.</NOTE>.</Q> The same is also meant by a <HI>single eye,</HI> and the contrary, namely, <HI>insincerity</HI> by <HI>the double minded man, who is unstable in all his ways,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. GOSPEL sincerity, supposes an impartial enquiry into our duty, what it is;—a hearty desire and endea∣vour to know, in every instance, <HI>what is the good</HI> and <HI>acceptable</HI> and <HI>holy will of the Lord,</HI> and how <HI>we may so walk as to please</HI> GOD<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. iv. 1.</NOTE>. The upright man is anxious to know his master's will in every particular case, and is ever ready to say, <Q>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And what I know not, teach thou me.</Q>— He desires to have no <HI>biass, prejudice,</HI> or <HI>prepossession</HI> against the will of GOD, how cross soever it may be to his own will or former notions or prejudices. He de∣sires to be excused from no part of his duty, how diffi∣cult or self-denying soever.—And as this is the <HI>sincerity</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="014137_0136_0F97D50833413740"/>of his <HI>disposition;</HI> so he gives all diligence, by prayer, enquiry, reading, and a close attendance upon ordi∣nances, to know the whole of his Master's good pleasure, that he may prepare himself to do according to it. But insincere men, are careless about the knowledge of their Master's will; because they are prejudiced against the performance of it, and <HI>hold the truth in unrighteousness. Nathaniel's</HI> conduct affords a fine illustration of this branch of sincerity; and our Saviour seems to fix the noble character he gives him, on his impartial enquiry after truth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOSPEL sincerity runs through the whole of a man's religious character and conduct, and supposes an entire and universal application to the practice of duty, so far as we know it, without any stated, allowed reserves to the contrary. The sincere man, as his governing aim is to please and serve GOD, so he will be as careful of the exercise of every grace and virtue, in the frame and temper of the heart, as in the outward actions of the life.—He will be as careful and watchful over his <HI>private</HI> conduct, as his <HI>public;</HI>—as sorry for his <HI>secret</HI> sins, and the follies of his <HI>heart,</HI> as for his outward offences; —as devout and constant in the religion of the <HI>family</HI> and <HI>closet,</HI> as in that of the <HI>church;</HI>—as conscientious in shunning one sin as another, and in performing one du∣ty as another. And indeed, there cannot be a more <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>decisive trial</HI> of our sincerity than this; namely, to examine and observe how we stand affected to those parts of morality and religion, to which none but GOD <HI>and our own consciences</HI> are privy. If we perform these as carefully and circumspectly, as we do the most out∣ward and visible duties, which are seen and praised of men, then may we conclude on just grounds, that we have truth in the heart, and sincerity in the inward parts.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="138" REF="014137_0137_0F97D508F3371198"/>
5. SINCERITY supposes a conformity and agreement between the sentiments of a man's heart and his words and actions. A sincere man will not say that he be∣lieves a doctrine which he really does not believe, to please, or gain the good opinion of any man. He will not speak of exercises, feelings, or experiences which he never had, in order to obtain any privilege:—He will not profess a sorrow for sin which he feels not, nor resolution of repentance and amendment which he ne∣ver truly nor solemnly made. The sincere man, either speaks not at all, in matters of religion, or else speaks sincerely what he thinks. He <HI>canteth</HI> not, he <HI>dissembleth</HI> not, he <HI>lieth</HI> not either <HI>for,</HI> or <HI>to,</HI> or <HI>concerning</HI> GOD, or the things of his soul.—St. <HI>Peter</HI> was flagrantly guilty of this kind of <HI>insincerity</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 11,—14.</NOTE>, and so are all hypocrites.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE same thing will sincerity produce in all our conduct <HI>towards men.</HI> A sincere man will scorn to use <HI>trick, artifice,</HI> and <HI>dissimulation,</HI> to gain his ends with his fellow-creatures; he will not pretend friendship or kind∣ness where he has none; nor make promises which he intends not to perform; nor act an unfriendly part be∣hind men's backs, after professions of respect and regard to their faces;—much less will he stoop to the baseness of making pretences of friendship, on purpose to im∣pose on men, or use sly insinuations to draw things from them in the freedom of discourse, with the murderous design of divulging these very things afterwards to their disadvantage. This is the wicked cunning and craftiness of the old serpent, and not the <HI>openness</HI> and <HI>sin∣cerity</HI> of a Christian indeed, in whom there should be no guile.</P>
<P N="7">7. WE are obliged to this temper and conduct by numberless considerations: (1.) It is expressly required by the precepts of our religion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Josh. xxiv. 14. John vi. 24. Rom. xii. 8. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. (2.) We cannot
<PB N="139" REF="014137_0138_0F97D509B3A45640"/>expect acceptance with GOD, in any duty, without sin∣cerity, Jam. ii. 10. Matth. xxiv. 51. Phil. i. 10. (3.) We cannot have peace of mind, or stand acquitted at the bar of our own consciences, if we are insincere in religion, 1 John iii. 19,—21. 2 Cor. i. 12. Gal. vi. 4. (4.) To be sincere in religion, would save the profes∣sors of it abundance of trouble which hypocrisy occa∣sions them. The easiest and surest way of seeming to be religious, is to be so in reality; and it is the most difficult and disagreeable task in the world to be ever wearing a mask and false disguise. (5.) Insincerity is the very image of the <HI>devil,</HI> that <HI>subtile, malicious, deceit∣ful, guileful</HI> old serpent, who transformeth himself into an angel of light.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT is greatly to be lamented, that this noble vir∣tue, which indeed is one of the most distinguishing badges of true Christianity, should yet be so little re∣garded, and so shamefully violated among professing Christians, that under the warmest professions of friend∣ship, and the most solemn obligations to it, there should be so little besides <HI>trick</HI> and <HI>artifiee, deceit</HI> and <HI>dissimulation, double-dealing</HI> and <HI>undermining</HI> practised among Christian brethren. A clear, but melancholy proof this, that we have only a name to live, while we are in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity, and doing the works of our father the <HI>devil.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXVII. CHRISTIAN ZEAL, <HI>and its</HI> OPPOSITES <HI>and</HI> COUN∣TERFEITS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ZEAL seems properly to signify, a <HI>heat, fervour</HI> and <HI>impetuosity</HI> of <HI>mind</HI> and <HI>action;</HI> and is ei∣ther <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> either a <HI>virtue</HI> or a <HI>vice,</HI> either <HI>religious</HI> or <HI>common</HI> and <HI>profane,</HI> according to its objects, and the proportion it bears to their importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. EVEN religious zeal is not so much a Christian grace or virtue, as a qualification which should attend the exercise of every Christian grace and virtue.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE scriptures give as many instances of a <HI>bad</HI> zeal as of a <HI>good</HI> one: We cannot therefore be too cautious about what objects our zeal is employed, and in what degree, lest, while we imagine we are pleasing and ho∣nouring GOD, we may in fact be dishonouring and of∣fending him, and increasing our own guilt.</P>
<P N="4">4. As Christian zeal is, however, a very important and indispensible duty, and as we are expressly com∣manded to <HI>be zealous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 10.</NOTE>, it may be right to enquire into the properties of a true Christian zeal; to consider its specious and imposing counterfeits, to speak of the obli∣gations we are under to be zealous, and of that temper which is contrary to it; and by doing this we shall ex∣haust the subject.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) EVEN a religious zeal is no farther good and commendable, than when it is on the side of truth and virtue. The <HI>cause</HI> therefore must be <HI>good</HI> about which our zeal is concerned, or it will have the most mischiev∣ous consequences. To be zealous, that is, to have a
<PB N="141" REF="014137_0140_0F97D50BF3A9A988"/>strong and ardent concern, for falsehood, and against truth; or for vice and against virtue, and to act vigo∣rously in consequence of this zeal, is to do the very greatest mischief in our power, and to act the <HI>devil,</HI> as much as our capacities and influence will admit. Such was the zeal of the Jews against Christ, his Apostles, and the primitive Christians. Such, particularly, was the zeal of <HI>Saul,</HI> afterwards <HI>Paul,</HI> when he <HI>madly,</HI> and with uncommon ardor and activity persecuted the church of Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 17, 18.—xiii. 45.—xvii. 5. Rom. x. 2. Gal. i. 14. Phil. iii. 6.</NOTE>. The caution therefore of this same Apostle is extremely apposite and necessary; <Q>It is good to be always zealously affected in a good thing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 18.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">(2.) IGNORANCE of truth and duty, where there is a possibility and opportunity of coming to the knowledge of them, will not excuse in this matter, otherwise it would have excused St. <HI>Paul</HI> and most of the <HI>Jews</HI> in their misguided and mischievous zeal. Therefore, our zeal, especially our religious zeal, should always be preceded by a careful, serious enquiry into the truth, and accompanied with knowledge. The reason of this is plain; for, of all zeal, religious zeal where it is blind and misguided is the most furious and mischievous. It is increased by the importance of its object; and when it is blind and misguided, it rages against the cause and glory of GOD, and the highest concerns of men, which are truth and righteousness. We may see its dreadful effects in the primitive <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>heathen</HI> persecutions, and in the seas of Protestant blood spilt by the church of Rome. If the <HI>Jews</HI> had known Christ, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; yet since they <HI>might</HI> have known him, their ignorance was no excuse for their zeal against him. It was their sin, that their
<PB N="142" REF="014137_0141_0F97D50CB3626758"/>zeal of GOD was not according to knowledge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 2.</NOTE>. What things Saint <HI>Paul</HI> did against Christ, were <HI>ignorantly thro' unbelief;</HI> yea, he verily thought that he ought to have done them; yet was he not thereby justified in doing them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 12,—15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) RIGHT and good zeal, must be proportioned to the value and importance of the objects about which it is employed. As there is diversity in the importance even of these things which are of divine duty and obli∣gation, so we should be most zealous about the most im∣portant things and duties of religion, and proportionably less zealous about those things and duties which are of less importance. It is the way of hypocrites to be mighty zealous about trisles; about small matters, and ceremonial observances, while they are very luke∣warm and indifferent, about the greater duties of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morality.</HI> They tithe <HI>mint, anise</HI> and <HI>cummin;</HI> while they neglect the weightier matters of the law, <HI>mercy, judgment</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiii. 23, 24.</NOTE>. How preposterous and absurd is it to see a man break charity with his Christian bro∣ther, for the neglect of <HI>modes, ceremonies,</HI> and <HI>human in∣ventions,</HI> while he would caress him, though a drunkard, an adulterer, or a profane swearer, if he observed these? Reason will teach us, that duties of the highest impor∣tance, should be the most ardently cared for, and the most diligently performed. We would deem him a fool, who would be more concerned about the security and welfare of his finger or toe, than of his heart or brain. Every thing appertaining to true religion merits our regard and observance; but the vitals of religion merit our warmest zeal. <Q>GOD loveth mercy more than sacrifice, and righteousness more than all burnt offer∣ings.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="143" REF="014137_0142_0F97D50D73607358"/>
(4.) TRUE zeal always takes its rise in <HI>the heart,</HI> and is founded on a <HI>right temper</HI> and <HI>right affections</HI> there. It is termed <HI>fervency of spirit</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 11.</NOTE>. Christian zeal is the spright∣ly vigour, and strenuous activity of every holy affecti∣on and disposition; and these springs set the active pow∣ers of the soul and body to work in the cause of GOD and goodness.—And here we may take notice of the <HI>opposites</HI> and <HI>counterfeits</HI> of true zeal, in this view of it;— such as, <HI>first,</HI> a <HI>Laodicean, careless, indolent, lukewarm</HI> temper of mind: The person is neither hot nor cold;— he will not wholly throw up a profession of religion; yet is he too indolent and unconcerned to act up to it with becoming earnestness and intenseness, spirit and re∣solution. He, as it were, <HI>halts between two opinions;</HI> his mind is in a state of <HI>torpid equilibrium,</HI> without heat enough to espouse its interests and perform its duties, or coldness enough to abandon it and give it up. This is the sad case of millions in the Christian church<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 14,—19.</NOTE>. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> there is a seeming counterfeit zeal for religion, where there is no warmth of <HI>affection,</HI> a <HI>blustering, noisy,</HI> profession, spending itself either in religious discourse or controversy, or in uncharitable and censorious judg∣ings and railings against the characters and professions of others, where there is really no true regard to religion at heart. This seems to have been the zeal or (hypo∣crisy) of the <HI>scribes</HI> and <HI>pharisees;</HI> and is well described by the prophet<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 31. Psal. lxxviii. 36, 37. Isa. xxix. 13.</NOTE>. Or, <HI>thirdly,</HI> it is a dreadful counterfeit of true Christian zeal, when men make a great shew and stir in religion, merely to deceive others, and to obtain <HI>wicked</HI> or <HI>secular</HI> ends, as was the case with <HI>Jehu,</HI> when he said; "Come see my zeal for the Lord<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Kings x. 16.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="3">(3.) TRUE Christian zeal always begins at home; it first casts the beam out of our own eye; its indig∣nation
<PB N="144" REF="014137_0143_0F97D50E3366E7B0"/>rises highest at our own faults; it is vigorous∣ly concerned for our own reformation, correction, im∣provement in knowledge and grace; perfection and final security and happiness. It is absurd to imagine, that a man can have any right and true hatred of sin in others, while he has none against it in himself; or that a man should be anxiously concerned for another man's reformation, salvation and happiness, while he has no regard to his own.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) TRUE Christian zeal is ever properly employed about others in the <HI>second place.</HI> Christians are zealous of good works, both in themselves and others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 14.</NOTE>. We have instances of this kind, Acts xvii. 16. Rev. ii. 2. Charity should quicken our zeal both <HI>against the sins</HI> and for <HI>the happiness</HI> of others. <HI>David</HI> was grieved, and shed tears, when he beheld transgressors.—<HI>Lot</HI> was vex∣ed by the filthy conversation of the wicked. Christ cast the money changers out of the court of the temple, and in this was fulfilled in him that scripture, <Q>The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</Q> <HI>Paul's</HI> spirit was moved, at the sight of <HI>Athenian</HI> idolatry. True zeal will engage us to reprove the sins of others, in a proper place, time and manner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. v. 11. Tit. i. 10,—13. 2 Tim. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. True zeal against sin, will make us shun sinful companions, Psal. cii. 4.—It will also engage us to do all the good for the souls of others that we can, Eccles. ix. 10.</P>
<P N="7">7. THAT we may shun irregularities in the exercises of our zeal towards others, we should observe the fol∣lowing cautions: 1. Let us take heed of a censorious, un∣charitable spirit in our reproofs of others.—This is a zeal <HI>unchristian</HI> and <HI>without knowledge,</HI> and is never likely to do any good. 2. Let us beware of <HI>passion</HI> and <HI>wrath</HI> in our zeal to reclaim and reform transgressors. Love to the person of the offender, and meekness should ac∣company
<PB N="145" REF="014137_0144_0F97D50EF6A26F58"/>our most zealous endeavours to reform him: For, in this case, as in others, <HI>the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of</HI> GOD. 3. The instruments of Christian zeal, are <HI>scripture, reason</HI> and <HI>persuasion.</HI> It is a wicked, antichristian, unwarrantable zeal, to destroy men's bodies, or rob them of their interests, for the good of their souls. This is the zeal of Popish inquisi∣tors. 4. Our zeal should be tempered with <HI>prudence.</HI> The zeal of a private Christian cannot, with prudence, be carried so far in the reformation of abuses, as that of a <HI>magistrate</HI> or <HI>public minister of religion.</HI> Although every Christian should be zealous for the propagation of truth and goodness, yet the measure of his zeal should cor∣respond with his station.—Besides, the exertions of our zeal against sin should be regulated, by the character of offenders, and the nature of their offences. <HI>Public, bold</HI> and <HI>shameless</HI> offenders are to be <HI>rebuked sharply</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. i.</NOTE>. Of some have compassion, making a difference: And others save with sear, <HI>pulling the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of the sire</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jude 22, 23.</NOTE>. 5. Right zeal is exerted against all sin, both in ourselves and others.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) TRUE Christian zeal is enforced upon us by many reasons and obligations: 1. The importance of religion deserves our zeal.—2. The difficulties that at∣tend the right discharge of our Christian duty require zeal, and render it necessary.—3. We can have no evi∣dence of our own sincerity, without becoming fervour and earnestness in the duties of religion; for, considering the unspeakable importance of religion, if we are <HI>truly</HI> concerned about it at all, it must be <HI>zealously.</HI>— 4. We shall never do much good to the souls of others, or much honour to our common Christianity, without a proper degree of Christian zeal.—5. We have the examples of the <HI>prophets,</HI> and of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> and of all eminently good men, to countenance
<PB N="146" REF="014137_0145_0F97D50FB31D57A8"/>and encourage us in a zealous adherence to religion, and in the zealous practice of the duties of it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXVIII. PATIENCE <HI>and the</HI> CONTRARY VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. PATIENCE is <HI>twofold.</HI> It either, (1.) respects the evils of life which we are actually feeling; or, (2.) some future good, which we have reason to expect, but which we do not as yet enjoy. The first is expres∣sed in scripture by the word <HI>upomone,</HI> which signifies an <HI>enduring of afflictions with constancy.</HI> The second by the word <HI>makrothumia,</HI> a <HI>length of mind,</HI> which signifies a <HI>patient wait∣ing for a promised good,</HI> and is opposed to <HI>hastiness of spirit</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 12. James v. 10. Rom. ii. 4.—xi. 22. 2 Cor. vi. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. PATIENCE does not consist in <HI>insensibility,</HI> nor sup∣pose it. It supposes that we <HI>feel</HI> the whole weight of our troubles and afflictions, but bear them with a Chris∣tian spirit and temper; and implies the following things.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT we have the command and possession of our own souls and are not rifled or discomposed, by the cross or painful accidents of life; but that we are so much <HI>our own man</HI> as to see, and steadily to pursue and perform the duties which become us as <HI>men,</HI> and <HI>Chris∣tians.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. PATIENCE will prevent us from making hasty judgments either concerning GOD or <HI>man;</HI> either against ourselves or others. <HI>Impatience</HI> makes men fretful and discontented, and hurries them on in the heat of their spirits, to rash and wicked judgments both of GOD and
<PB N="147" REF="014137_0146_0F97D510732283E0"/>man; "I said, in my haste, all men are liars," and so Psal. lxxvii. 7,—10. Patience will make us consider, that we may be mistaken both with regard to the <HI>designs</HI> and <HI>intentions</HI> of GOD and man, and with regard to the <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>propriety</HI> of our afflictions, and will save us from many rash, wicked and uncharitable thoughts, both of GOD and our neighbour.</P>
<P N="5">5. PATIENCE, will preserve us from using unlawful methods both of delivering ourselves from present af∣flictions and obtaining the things we desire,—if we are endued with Christian patience we will rather <HI>suffer</HI> than <HI>sin:</HI> We will rather continue poor and miserable, than better our state by forbidden and unlawful means: We will wait GOD'S time and will, in the way of du∣ty and honest endeavours; being assured, that GOD will deliver us from trouble, and perform his promise to us in the very best and fittest time and manner, if we do indeed wait upon him and trust in him.</P>
<P N="6">6. CHRISTIAN patience will engage us to persevere in the way of duty, in the midst of all discouragement and opposition; because, it proceeds upon a suppositi∣on and firm unshaken belief, <Q>That whatever befals us, is best and fittest for us upon the whole; that whatever we suffer, we not only suffer deservedly, but it is <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>needful</HI> that we should so suffer, and that whatever GOD hath promised, shall surely be perform∣ed in the fittest and properest time.</Q> In a word, it proceeds upon a firm, convictive and practical belief of the truth, wisdom, goodness and power of GOD, and of the perfect equity, wisdom and goodness of all his pro∣vidential dealings with his creatures, and that if we do but our part, GOD never can nor will fail in his. Nay, that even his delays in delivering us from affliction, or conferring upon us his promised blessings, are just and right, merciful and gracious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 9. Heb. xii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="148" REF="014137_0147_0F97D511340542C0"/>
7. THIS grace is perfectly reasonable, and fit and be∣coming to be exercised by such creatures as we are, as will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the following reasons.</P>
<P N="8">8. IMPATIENCE under afflictions, or in the delay of expected good, can be of no manner of service to us, but must do us a great deal of hurt. Our fretting and murmuring under afflictions, discompose us, and make their weight <HI>double.</HI> It shews a rebellious temper, and renders us unworthy of the relief which we desire; while, at the same time, it cannot procure us any relief, but must needs make our case worse.</P>
<P N="9">9. WE deserve no good thing at the hand of GOD, but all evil, even <HI>eternal misery;</HI> and therefore, if we <HI>think right,</HI> a living man has no right to complain, a man for the punishment of his sins; but it is his evident duty to bear the indignation of the Lord, because he hath sinned against him. If we had our deserts, we would be in hell; therefore, we should bear patiently every afflicti∣on, which is short of this.</P>
<P N="10">10. EVEN where GOD hath made promises to deliver his people from afflictions, or to bestow upon them mer∣cies, he hath not <HI>ordinarily</HI> limitted himself to <HI>any particu∣lar time:</HI> but justly expects that we should refer the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> wholly to his own infinite justice, wis∣dom and goodness, and wait upon him believingly, con∣fidently and resignedly for the event.</P>
<P N="11">11. GOD'S mercies and deliverances are so <HI>full, com∣plete</HI> and <HI>satisfying</HI> in themselves; and the very smallest of them is so great an honour, when conferred by so great a being, upon such worthless, undeserving and hell-deserving creatures as we are, that it becomes us to wait patiently for them, in the most diligent and self∣denying means, all the days of our lives. What are we that we should <HI>set a time</HI> to the great GOD, and be fret∣ful, peevish and impatient if he does not hear our cries,

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIX. MEEKNESS, <HI>and the opposite</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE scriptures teach us to consider <HI>meekness,</HI> as referring, in its exercises, both to GOD and <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. MEEKNESS, as it is a right temper towards GOD, respects either his <HI>word,</HI> or his <HI>providences.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As it respects his <HI>word</HI> or his <HI>revealed will,</HI> it con∣sists in a humble, teachable submission to the authority of his word; that the soul bows to it and acquiesees in it, and sacrifices all its <HI>prejudices, carnal reasonings</HI> and <HI>pre∣conceived opinions</HI> to its dictates. It implies the temper of young <HI>Samuel,</HI> <Q>Speak, Lord, for thy servant hear∣eth.</Q> Or, that of <HI>Cornelius's</HI> houshold, <Q>Behold, we are all hear present before GOD, to hear what is commanded us of GOD.</Q> Thus we are commanded, <HI>to receive with meekness</HI> (with the cager, submissive, obe∣dient temper of humble disciples, and with all readiness of mind) <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word, which is able to save our souls</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 21.</NOTE>.
<PB N="150" REF="014137_0149_0F97D512B30C92B0"/>Thus Christ was anointed to <HI>preach good tidings to the meek:</HI> And GOD dwells with them who are of a hum∣ble heart, and who tremble at his word; and guides the meek in judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxv. 9. Isa. lxi. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. MEEKNESS towards GOD, implies an <HI>humble, com∣placential submission</HI> to his <HI>providential will,</HI> in its <HI>severest</HI> and <HI>most afflictive dispensations.</HI> And this is submission or re∣signation to the will of GOD, in opposition to a fretful, murmuring, impatient spirit against his providence. The man who is thus meek towards GOD, is dumb and openeth not his mouth; and is still, and submits quietly to the rod; and humbles himself under the mighty hand of GOD, and accepts the punishment of his iniquities, and says with Eli, <Q>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. MEEKNESS, as it is a right temper of mind and spirit towards our neighbour, consists in a sweet and ea∣sy, courteous and obliging, peaceable and composed temper and behaviour, and is opposed to a boisterous, unruly, morose, revengeful, and more especially to a surly and angry temper and conduct towards others.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE meek person is calm under provocations, and, having a command over his own spirit, is not hur∣ried on to cursing, railing, reproachful language, or to hasty resentment and revenge, which always drives peo∣ple of furious, ungoverned passions, to sinful, and often to very unjust and injurious extremes. The meek man will never be angry without a cause, or above mea∣sure; will never take an affront where none is meant, nor resent a real affront above what it deserves. He is slow to wrath; not easily provoked; thinketh no evil; speaketh not unadvisedly with his lips; rendereth not railing for railing; but, by soft and reasonable answers, turneth away wrath, and overcometh evil with good. Anger resteth in the bosom of fools: But it is not so
<PB N="151" REF="014137_0150_0F97D5137402A6C8"/>with the meek man; he letteth not the sun go down on his wrath. If his brother sin against him <HI>seventy-seven</HI> times in a day, and say, <HI>I repent,</HI> he forgiveth him, and easily maketh up any breach, upon proper acknow∣ledgment and submission. <HI>Peace</HI> is his <HI>element,</HI> and wrath the aversion of his nature.</P>
<P N="7">7. MEEKNESS discovers itself, in a great cautiousness of giving offence to others. Proud, angry, wrathful and turbulent men, are not cautious of this: They are perpetually giving offence, and seem to delight and glo∣ry in it, as a sign of courage. But the gospel teacheth us to speak evil, (unnecessarily) of no man; not to be brawlers, but gentle, kind, tender-hearted, thus shew∣ing all meekness to all men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 2.</NOTE>. The meek man is ever a civil, affable, courteous man; and a good heart teaches him that which is the grand precept in <HI>politeness</HI> and <HI>true good breeding;</HI> namely, to give no oftence or uneasiness to any in company; but to endeavour to give pleasure and satisfaction to all, so far as that may be done with a good conscience.</P>
<P N="8">8. MEEKNESS will shew itself in a modest and be∣coming deportment in every different rank, station and relation of life. It will make <HI>servants, children,</HI> and all <HI>inferiors</HI> contented and pleased with their low and in∣ferior stations; the poor with their poverty, and the afflicted with their afflictions. And it will make su∣periors humble in their exalted stations, affable, and courteous, just and merciful, mild and gentle to those that are under them, in inferior states.</P>
<P N="6">6. ABOVE all, a meek temper will shew itself in things that relate to religion. Surely the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of GOD. We are to contend indeed earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints, and not to deny or dissemble what, we take to be the truth of the gospel, even at the risque of
<PB N="152" REF="014137_0151_0F97D5143310D488"/>life itself: But to manage religious disputes and contro∣versies with angry contention and a persecuting spirit, is to defend and maintain truth in a manner quite op∣posite to the temper and spirit of the gospel, and which is never like to make proselytes. It is to offer a holy sacrifice with unhallowed fire,—and, like <HI>Uzzah,</HI> to po∣lute the ark of GOD, by a <HI>wrong touch:</HI> Therefore, we are commanded, <Q>In meekness to instruct those who oppose themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii, 25.</NOTE>. To be ready to give an answer to every man that asketh us a reason of the hope that is in us, with meekness and fear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 15.</NOTE>.</Q> And even <HI>of∣fending brethren</HI> are to be treated, and if possible recover∣ed from the snares of the <HI>devil,</HI> <Q>In the spirit of meekness<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 1.</NOTE>. Nay, the wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, (or meek) full of mercy and good works;</Q>—and a wise and knowing man in religion, is to rule his tongue and angry passions, and to shew, out of a good conversation, his works, with <HI>meekness of wisdom</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jam. iii. 13, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Indeed, the very genius of the gospel is <HI>meekness.</HI>—It is the ministry of reconciliation with GOD and man.—It proclaims <HI>peace upon earth,</HI> as well as <HI>good will towards men.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. WE cannot be Christians without this temper; without all <HI>lowliness</HI> and <HI>meekness:</HI> For, this is the very temper and spirit of Christ, and he has commanded us to take his yoke upon us and learn of him; for, says he, "I am meek and low of heart." And this <HI>temper</HI> he eminently expressed through the whole of his own life.</P>
<P N="11">11. MEEKNESS is one of the fruits of the regenerat∣ing, sanctifying spirit, without which we are sure, none will enter into the kingdom of heaven. Indeed, the most of these fruits, as enumerated by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> are
<PB N="153" REF="014137_0152_0F97D514F3299860"/>branches of meekness. <Q>Meekness, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness;</Q>—and the great∣est number of the works of the flesh, are directly the opposites of meekness; such as, <Q>hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife and envyings.</Q></P>
<P N="12">12. MEEKNESS is a grace exceedingly ornamental to the Christian character. We are commanded to be clothed with humility (which is a sister grace to meek∣ness) <Q>and to put on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight or GOD, of great price<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 4.</NOTE>.</Q> It is said also, <Q>that he who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 32.</NOTE>.</Q> The meek also are pro∣nounced <HI>blessed,</HI> by our Saviour, and have a promise that they shall <HI>inherit the earth</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE meek man has the only chance of going <HI>easily, quietly</HI> and <HI>happily</HI> through the world. Nothing that happens will much rifle or disturb him, and his tem∣per will render him beloved and admired by all.</P>
<P N="14">14. LET us not mistake an <HI>easy, indolent, insensible, cow∣ardly</HI> natural temper for <HI>Christian meekness.</HI> It is a grace of GOD'S holy Spirit; and the true Christian is meek, not for want of true courage and sensibility of injuries received, but in obedience to the laws of GOD, and in conformity to the doctrines and example of his Sa∣viour.</P>
<P N="15">15. IF we would obtain this grace we must pray and strive to obtain it with <HI>all diligence</HI> and much <HI>self-denial:</HI> For, it is directly against the grain of our corrupt and sinful nature, and the prevailing maxims of the world. Indeed, no man will ever be endued with true Christian meekness, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he has been renewed by the holy Spirit,
<PB N="154" REF="014137_0153_0F97D515B307C050"/>and has learned of Christ to be meek and lowly of heart.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXX. CHARITY, <HI>and the opposite</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CHARITY is but another word for <HI>love;</HI> and when it is used as a term in divinity, in its largest and most extensive sense, it signifies the whole of our duty to GOD and man, both in its principle and proper fruits and effects. In a word, charity is the ful∣filling of the whole law, and includes the two great commandments laid down by our Saviour as the sum and substance of the law and the prophets. <Q>Thou shalt love the Lord thy GOD with all thy heart, with all thy soul, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy self.</Q> Charity, therefore, in this largest sense, implies a right temper of mind, both to GOD and our <HI>neighbour,</HI> and all its genuine fruits and effects, and therefore, is the whole of true religion and morality.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS grace or virtue, as it respects GOD, (1.) presupposes a right knowledge of GOD; that we know him, or have worthy and just conceptions of him in his adorable and amiable perfections (for there is not a more certain maxim, than that we can have no love for an unknown object;) and this knowledge, though it may be obtained in part, and in some degree, from his works and providences, yet it is most perfectly obtained from his revealed word, illustrated and set home upon the soul by the influences of his Spirit. (2.) It implies that we love him <HI>supremely,</HI> and above all other beings; for if we do not love him <HI>thus,</HI> we do not love him as GOD; or the affection does not correspond with the
<PB N="155" REF="014137_0154_0F97D5178D18C498"/>object of it. (3.) It implies that we are cheerfully and cordially devoted to his service and obedience: <Q>for this is the love of GOD, that we keep his command∣ments.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3 THE vices opposite to this branch of charity— are, (1.) A wilful and careless ignorance of GOD; a neglecting the means of knowing him and acquainting ourselves with him, without which it is impossible we should love him as we ought. (2.) An excessive <HI>self-love,</HI> or love of any creature, or creature enjoyment, by which the supreme love and affection of the soul is stolen away from GOD, and placed on the creature; which is <HI>spiri∣tual idolatry.</HI> (3.) All sin and vice is a violation of this branch of charity; but more especially those sins, which strike most directly at the <HI>glory of</HI> GOD, such as <HI>blasphemy, pro∣fane swearing, atheistical</HI> thoughts and speeches, speaking irreverently and slighting of GOD, his works, word, or∣dinances, laws, and people. Indeed, the natural mind is enmity against GOD, and none but such as are born of him, can truly love him.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE second grand branch of charity, and as essen∣tial as the former, is <HI>love to our neighbour.</HI> And this may be divided into two branches, <HI>humanity</HI> and Chris∣tian <HI>charity.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. EVERY man, in scripture account, is <HI>our neigh∣bour,</HI> be of what <HI>nation,</HI> or <HI>religion</HI> he will, and we owe <HI>love</HI> or <HI>charity</HI> to every man as such; as our fellow-crea∣tures; a partaker with us in the same common nature; as sprung from the same original stock, a creature of the same GOD, an inhabitant with us of the same world; subject to the same feelings, passions, appetites, wants, necessities, miseries with ourselves, and bound with us to the same eternal world. From which relations naturally flow the duties of justice, sympathy, mercy, compassion, all springing from the root of charity or love to our neighbour. Hence we are to <HI>owe no man
<PB N="156" REF="014137_0155_0F97D517F33B72B0"/>any thing but love;</HI> and <HI>this love</HI> is the <HI>fulfilling of the whole law,</HI> as far as it respects our neighbour; because it will naturally and powerfully dispose us to treat our neigh∣bour in all respects <HI>as we ought,</HI> wherever it truly takes place, and prevails in the heart.</P>
<P N="6">6. CONTRARY to this branch of <HI>charity</HI> or <HI>humanity,</HI> is all injustice, evil-speaking, evil-thinking, or rash and censorious judging of our neighbour; all narrow, nati∣onal prejudices against men; all local, contracted affec∣tions which shut out a party of mankind from our hu∣manity, on account of their being of a different nation or religion from ourselves; all envy, malice, and cruel∣ty towards our fellow-creatures, and all partiality in the administration of justice.</P>
<P N="7">7. CHRISTIAN <HI>charity</HI> or <HI>love,</HI> properly so called, con∣sists in a peculiar affection for our fellow Christians, under the notion of their being <HI>our brethren;</HI> disciples of the same LORD and Master; spiritual children of the same GOD by adoption and regeneration; heirs of the same precious hope, and incorruptible inheritance; fel∣low-pilgrims in the same strange country, and fellow-travellers together to the same land of promise. This is still an advance upon humanity, and unites Christians together in the most peculiar bonds; so that whatever is a violation of the laws and bonds of common <HI>humani∣ty,</HI> is much more so of the laws of <HI>Christian charity.</HI> In∣deed, charity, or Christian love, is the peculiar genius of christianity, and is that grace which Christ has honour∣ed, by making it the peculiar and distinctive badge of his disciples. <Q>By this, says Christ, shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if you have love one for another.</Q> Nor is the exercise of any grace so warm∣ly urged upon Christians, as this.</P>
<P N="8">8. A PECULIAR fruit of charity is <HI>alms-giving,</HI> or re∣lieving the necessities of the <HI>poor,</HI> the <HI>needy,</HI> the <HI>miserable</HI> and the <HI>oppressed;</HI> and indeed, this is what commonly
<PB N="157" REF="014137_0156_0F97D518B4D69898"/>passes in the world by the name of <HI>charity,</HI> though very unjustly: For, the Apostle assures us, that a man may <HI>give</HI> even <HI>all his goods to feed the poor,</HI> and yet <HI>have no cha∣rity.</HI> An alms, if it proceeds not from <HI>charity,</HI> that is, from a true Christian love to GOD and our neighbour, and from a principle of dutiful obedience to GOD, is no grace at all.</P>
<P N="9">9. WE have an excellent character and description of charity given, 1 Cor. xiii. 4, &amp;c. <Q>Charity suffer∣eth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly; seeketh not her own; is not easily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniqui∣ty, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things; believeth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things: Charity never faileth. And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXI. CONTENTMENT, <HI>and the opposite</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONTENTMENT is a grace which re∣spects only our <HI>outward condition in this world,</HI> and not our spiritual condition here, or our lot and ap∣pointment in the world to come; and it consists in such a moderate value for, and attachment to the things and enjoyments of the body and of this mortal life, that whether we have or want them; whether we have little or much of them, we are so well satisfied, and so little disturbed, that we are thankful to GOD for what we
<PB N="158" REF="014137_0157_0F97D5197345BF68"/>have, and are at <HI>leisure</HI> to enjoy both GOD and <HI>ourselves.</HI> In short, it consists in such a submission to GOD, and sa∣tisfiedness with the allotments of his providence, with regard to our worldly circumstances, that we may be able to say with the Apostle, <Q>I have learned in what∣soever state I am, therewith to be contented; both to be full and to be hungry: both to abound, and be abased and suffer need<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. iv. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. CONTENTMENT cannot reach to a man's spiritual condition or future state; for, although a sinner may have reason to thank GOD that he is out of <HI>hell;</HI> yet, it would ill become him to say, <Q>Whatever state my soul is in, whether in a state of grace or sin, converted or unconverted, I am therewith contented.</Q> The design of GOD'S word is, that sinners should have no peace or contentment in their sinful and perishing condition, and that they should never rest contented, till their peace is made with GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. NOR would it become a gracious man to be con∣tented with low attainments in grace and holiness, and an imperfect measure of conformity to GOD. Saints should be restless in their endeavours to <HI>perfect holiness in the fear of</HI> GOD; and forgetting things behind, to reach forward, and press on to the mark for the prize of their high calling. Phil. iii. 13, 14, and many other scrip∣tures.</P>
<P N="4">4. NOR is it at all to be supposed, that any human creature <HI>could,</HI> or <HI>should</HI> be contented to be demned, and thrust out for ever from the beatific presence of GOD. All sinners, indeed, ought to acknowledge damnation their just portion, and approve the law and sentence which condemns them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 4. Rom. iii. 4.</NOTE>: But it is against the <HI>law of self-preservation;</HI> yea, against our duty to GOD, to con∣sent to be damned, or to be contented with this allot∣ment.
<PB N="159" REF="014137_0158_0F97D51A356BC418"/>That strong expression, therefore, of St. Paul, Rom. ix. 3. and that of Moses, Exod. xxxii. 32, must have some other meaning.</P>
<P N="5">5. NOR ought we to be <HI>so contented</HI> with our condi∣tion and circumstances in this life, as to be willing to take up our lot, portion and everlasting abode here. Christian contentment is consistent with the most earnest wishes and desires to be in a better country, even an heavenly; to be <HI>absent from the body,</HI> and the things and enjoyments of it, and <HI>present with the Lord;</HI> and only supposes, that as wise and prudent travellers, we are contented with such lodgings and fare as we meet with in our journey to our Father's house, and our heavenly inheritance.</P>
<P N="6">6. NOR does contentment, even with our worldly cir∣cumstances, imply an insensibility of our difficulties and afflictions, or forbid lawful desires and endeavours to get rid of them by bettering our condition. Such de∣sires are the foundation of diligence, industry, and the use of means, and therefore cannot be displeasing to GOD. But, contentment supposes, that if we are dis∣appointed in the use of means, we acquiesce and are sa∣tisfied, without murmuring, convinced that such is the will of heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. CONTENTMENT is opposed to <HI>covetousness</HI> and <HI>worldly-mindedness,</HI> and supposes that our desires of the good things of this world are low, modest and christi∣an; that we seek not eagerly great things for ourselves, but bound our wishes and views to a moderate compe∣tency; resolving, that having food and raiment we will be therewith contented; seeing that a man's life consist∣eth not in the abundance of the things he possesses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 15. Gen. xxviii. 20. Heb. xiii. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. IMMODERATE worldly cares and anxieties about what <HI>may</HI> happen to us in time to come, are inconsistent with Christian contentment, as they render men uneasy
<PB N="160" REF="014137_0159_0F97D51AF3047490"/>for the present, unfit them for the duties of religion, and speak a distrust of the providential goodness of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxi. 34. Matth. vi. 34. Phil. iv. 6.</NOTE>. Besides, these cares and anxieties, although they destroy our peace, yet they cannot better our circumstances; for, <HI>taking thought,</HI> cannot add one cubit to our stature, or alter the course or allotments of divine providence.</P>
<P N="9">9. ALL murmurings and repinings against the provi∣dence of GOD, as though GOD had dealt more severely with us than he ought or might have done, are in∣consistent with Christian contentment. To remedy this, we should consider GOD'S universal providence, and the equity and perfect rectitude of his ways, 1 Sam. iii. 18.</P>
<P N="10">10. ENVY against others, who are in more prosperous and honourable circumstances than we, is inconsistent with Christian contentment. There can be no content∣ment in the envious breast. Why should my eye be evil against my neighbour, because GOD is good to him? If my neighbour is a wicked man, his prosperity will destroy him: If a good man, why should I envy his prosperity, and not rather rejoice in it; seeing GOD made him prosperous for wise and good purposes? In∣deed, my envying my neighbour his prosperity or hap∣piness, is a plain and convincing proof, that I myself do not deserve these blessings at the hand of GOD; and that if I had them, I would make a very bad use of them.</P>
<P N="11">11. A TRULY contented man, however he may wish his condition better, yet never will use <HI>unlawful means</HI> to better it. This is to make haste the wrong way, to be rich, easy or happy; and shews great discontent. The danger of this is well painted, in one instance of it, 1 Tim. vi. 8,—10. See a good advice also against this kind of discontent, Luke iii. 14.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="161" REF="014137_0160_0F97D51BB3241638"/>
12 CONTENTMENT will engage us to make the best of our condition whatever it be. The contented man will survey his remaining comforts with gratitude to GOD, and comfort himself by considering how sew and tolerable his distresses and misfortunes are, compar∣ed with those of many others. He will also endeavour to extract some spiritual advantage out of every afflic∣tion.</P>
<P>To engage us to contentment with our present lots and conditions, let us consider, (1.) That they are ap∣pointed by a GOD of infinite justice, wisdom and mercy. (2.) That let them be as bad as they will, we deserve still worse. (3.) That it is generally <HI>our own fault,</HI> that they are not better. (4.) That if we are indeed GOD'S children, all will work together for good to us; and that our wants and afflictions are ordered <HI>in mercy,</HI> and because <HI>need so is:</HI> And if we are not GOD'S chil∣dren, we are punished <HI>less,</HI> much less, than our iniquities deserve. (5.) That however <HI>grievous</HI> or <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>un∣comfortable</HI> our lots are, our wants and miseries cannot be of long continuance, but must soon be terminated by death. (6.) That the best of men, even the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD himself, have been in worse present circumstances than we are; and yet were perfectly contented; from whose examples we should learn this grace.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXII. CHASTITY <HI>and the contrary</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GOD hath implanted in the sexes such appe∣tites and affections towards each other as are necessary for the propagation of our kind, and without which, probably the first command, <Q>Multiply and re∣plenish the earth,</Q> would not have been readily obeyed. And it is here worth observing, as a proof of the divine wisdom and goodness, that a natural pleasure is annexed to those actions by which our kind is propa∣gated, and life supported and sustained.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHASTITY consists in the regulation of these appe∣tites and desires between the sexes.</P>
<P N="3">3. As GOD hath implanted no natural appetites in his creatures, for which he hath not provided lawful gratifications; so the appetites between the sexes, may be gratified in a lawful manner. Wherefore, chastity consists not in <HI>eradicating</HI> these natural appetites, but in <HI>regulating</HI> them; restraining them within the bounds of moderation, and directing them to right objects. Hence appears the unreasonableness of <HI>celebacy</HI> and a <HI>monastic life.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. ALTHOUGH brutes, generally speaking, are re∣markably moderate in the gratification of these appe∣tites, yet they cannot be called <HI>chaste,</HI> having no consci∣ence, and being under no moral or divine law. <HI>Chastity</HI> therefore is a <HI>human</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> virtue, arising from reason, reflection, and submission to the authority of a divine law.</P>
<P N="5">5. REASON and <HI>reflection</HI> will quickly convince us that the loose and unbounded gratification of the ap∣petites
<PB N="163" REF="014137_0162_0F97D51D33EDEA30"/>between the sexes, would be productive of the greatest mischiefs in human society; and therefore <HI>marriage,</HI> (the only remedy against this mischief) has been held sacred and venerable among almost all nations, who have had little else than the dictates of natural reason for their guide. Indeed, other gratifications of these appetites have been tolerated among some of them. And the more brutish these nations have been, the more unbounded and unrestrained have they been in the gratifications of these appetites, (witness the ancient Britons.)</P>
<P N="6">6. THE Christian revelation has limitted the gratifi∣cation of these appetites to <HI>one woman</HI> and <HI>one man,</HI> in a state of marriage, during the life of either of the par∣ties; and has strictly, and upon the severest penalties, forbid the gratification of them in any other way: The reasons of which limitation and prohibition, are very wise, and sufficiently obvious: Hence we may learn what is <HI>unchastity,</HI> in <HI>deed, word,</HI> and <HI>thought.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. UNCHASTITY in <HI>deed,</HI> is when single and unmar∣ried persons do at all actually gratify these appetites; or when married persons at all actually gratify them, with any other persons than their own husbands or wives; and is distinguished into sins of <HI>fornication, adultery, incest, poligamy, sodomy</HI> and <HI>self-pollution.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. UNCHASTITY in thought or desire, is when one of either sex, looketh upon one of the contrary sex, which is a forbidden object, so as to lust after them, or desire criminal converse with them. And how much more criminally unchaste must it be, so to in∣flame the heart with an absent, forbidden object, as to act over the guilty scene in imagination?</P>
<P N="9">9. UNCHASTITY in word, is when we use such fil∣thy obscene language, as has a tendency to excite un∣chaste thoughts and desires, either in ourselves, or others. In order to maintain and preserve our chastity,
<PB N="164" REF="014137_0163_0F97D51DF3D0FBF0"/>the following things seem necessary and useful:—(1.) To pray for, and endeavour after <HI>true conversion,</HI> or a <HI>new, clean,</HI> and <HI>pure</HI> heart; for while we have a corrupt na∣ture, our passions and appetites will ever be inordinate and ungovernable.—(2.) To shun all unnecessary inti∣macy and familiarity with forbidden objects of the dif∣ferent sex, by which we may insensibly contract unlaw∣ful desires, which may in time lead to criminal actions; or, where a friendship is cultivated between the sexes, to improve it to the promoting of purity and virtue.—(3.) To chuse and consort with such companions of our own sex, as are most chaste and modest in their language and deportment; and on the contrary, to shun all lewd, immodest, profligate companions, who will soon vitiate our taste, and corrupt our manners.—(4.) To be much in reading the scriptures, and such other books, as tend to purify the mind, and inspire chaste and holy thoughts; and cautiously to shun the perusal of loose plays, songs, romances, and such trash as corrupt and debauch the mind.—(5.) Often to examine our own hearts, and meditate on the extreme evil and danger of unchastity; how unlike it renders us to the pure and holy GOD; how unfit for his enjoyment, and how obnoxious to his vengeance; that burning lusts, are fuel to kindle un∣quenchable flames, in the place of torment.—(6.) Fasting and prayer, have been found excellent and effec∣tual remedies for unchastity; and indeed, all the in∣strumental duties of religion should be used in this view.—(7.) Chastity agrees well with diligence and so∣briety, and often dwells under the same roof with them. —(8.) Marriage is to many, the only remedy for un∣chastity; and it is a lawful and honourable one.—(9.) But, in short, without a new and divine nature, and grace in exercise, nothing will effectually secure either married or single from <HI>unchastity,</HI> either in <HI>thought, word,</HI> or <HI>action.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXIII. HUMILITY, <HI>and the opposite</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HUMILITY consists in a right judgment of ourselves, compared with other beings; and is opposed to the vices of <HI>pride, arrogance, self-righteousness, self-conceit, vanity,</HI> and <HI>boasting</HI> and <HI>glorying</HI> in one's self, with a contempt of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. HUMILITY, like all the other Christian graces, must be seated in the mind, and thence display and ma∣nifest itself in our words and outward deportment; and therefore the Apostle exhorts Christians to <Q>put on humbleness of mind.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. HUMILITY does not consist in making a wrong judgment of ourselves or others, or in thinking less or worse of ourselves than we deserve; but in making a right and just judgment of ourselves and others on com∣parrison; and if we do so, we shall have little reason for pride, arrogance or self-conceit. Nor,</P>
<P N="4">4. DOES humility consist (as many have supposed) in mean clothes, dejected looks, and a complaisant cringing behaviour to our fellow creatures: All these may consist with the most insufferable pride and ambi∣tion, and are often only cloaks to conceal it. Yet the world makes humility to consist wholly in these things, and will not allow a man to have any pride, who is ne∣gligent or slovenly in his dress, or affable in conversa∣tion.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE humble soul sees that he is <HI>nothing</HI> before GOD, or in comparrison with him; that he is but a creature of a day, sprung from the dust, whose breath is in his nostrils, wholly depending on GOD for his soul
<PB N="166" REF="014137_0165_0F97D51F74CA9278"/>and its faculties, his body and its senses; for every mo∣ment of his existence, every support and comfort of the present life, and every hope of future life; and therefore, he <HI>walks</HI> exceeding <HI>humbly with his</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE humble soul sees that it is not only a <HI>dependent</HI> creature, but a <HI>sinful, guilty, helpless, perishing, lost, miser∣able</HI> creature, who has destroyed itself; who deserves hell, and no kind of mercy or favour from GOD at all: Therefore, he is contented in all states without mur∣muring; bears afflictions with patience; is thankful for every, even the smallest favour; rejoices in the glad tidings of a Saviour and salvation; gladly disclaims and renounces his own righteousness and merit, and joyfully embraces and pleads the righteousness and merit of Christ; comes to GOD poor and empty, wretched and miserable, humble and penitent, and falls down before the throne of his mercy, willing to accept the free sal∣vation with the utmost gratitude, on GOD'S own terms; on <HI>any terms.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THE humble soul, knowing its own natural weak∣ness, blindness, ignorance and fallibility; how prone it is to errors, mistakes and prejudices; readily renounces and disclaims its own weak, corrupt, fallible judgment in religious matters; submits its reason and understand∣ing wholly to the dictates of GOD'S <HI>word</HI> and the <HI>guidance of his Spirit,</HI> and is willing humbly and gladly to learn from GOD and his <HI>blessed Son,</HI> the truths and duties of re∣ligion. He is not wise in his own conceit, or wise above what is written, but wholly submits his under∣standing to revealed truth.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE humble soul thinks meanly of its own know∣ledge and goodness, compared with that of other men of nobler powers, and higher attainments and advantages; esteeming others better than himself, and in honour preferring them. He is so f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such, that he honours and respects them as better and more useful
<PB N="167" REF="014137_0166_0F97D520330664A8"/>than himself; thanks GOD for his grace in them and his gifts to them; is ready to learn from and imitate them; speaks honourably and respectfully of them to others, and thereby endeavours to promote their useful∣ness in the world: Nay, he is not angry or offended, nor is his pride piqu'd, if they are honoured more than him, and at his own expence. To bear this patiently shews true humbleness of mind.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE humble soul, sensible that all its knowledge and goodness is <HI>borrowed</HI> and <HI>derived;</HI> is the fruit of GOD'S gifts and grace, and of the opportunities and ad∣vantages which he has conferred upon it; and how ve∣ry limitted and imperfect its knowledge is at the best; how very little it knows of what may be known, and how imperfect its knowledge is of the things which it knows, how many degrees of grace and goodness there are between it and the perfection of holiness of which our nature is capable: The humble soul, I say, know∣ing and being convinced of all this, can never despise those who have less knowledge and goodness than him∣self; because, he hath nothing which he hath not re∣ceived, and it is GOD who hath made him to differ, and he is still but a poor, imperfect creature, full of igno∣rance and corruption. This therefore keeps him from <HI>spiritual pride;</HI> from <HI>self-righteousness</HI> and <HI>self-conceit;</HI> from being puffed up, and from glorying in a state which is so very far short of perfection. He is humble, and pities the infirmities of others.</P>
<P N="10">10. PRIDE was the first sin of men and angels, and is still the predominant vice of sinners, and the last sin which is totally subdued and rooted out of the human heart by renewing grace.</P>
<P N="11">11. PRIDE <HI>towards</HI> GOD, shews itself by the follow∣ing symptoms. Men who will believe their own vain imaginations, sooner than GOD'S word; who set up their darkned reason, above the word of GOD, and their
<PB N="168" REF="014137_0167_0F97D520F2FA4718"/>own corrupt wills, above the will and law of GOD; who oppose GOD, and murmur against him, and will not accept of his Son and his righteousness, but believe they have righteousness and merit enough for their jus∣tification, are excessively proud: And this is the most hellish and provoking of all pride; yet, it is the pride of every unconverted sinner.</P>
<P N="12">12. PRIDE <HI>towards men,</HI> shews itself in undervaluing and despising others, and preferring ourselves before them; in contradicting and opposing others upon all occasions; in looking down upon others as beneath our notice, and undervaluing all their good qualities and accomplishments; in speaking much of ourselves, prais∣ing ourselves, and boasting and glorying in our actions and dispositions.</P>
<P N="13">13. GAIETY and fondness of dress, is a kind of <HI>child∣ish, womanish</HI> vanity, which hardly deserves the name of <HI>pride.</HI> It is a kind of childish folly which deserves to be laughed at, and which no sinner of good common sense was ever guilty of. What? Proud of that which co∣vers our nakedness and shame!</P>
<P N="14">14. THE <HI>devil</HI> affords the highest example of pride; and the blessed Jesus of humility.</P>
<P N="15">15. PRIDE is the most <HI>shameful</HI> and <HI>absurd</HI> vice of a man; and humility the most <HI>amiable</HI> and <HI>ornamental</HI> vir∣tue of a Christian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxviii. 6.

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXIV. SOBRIETY, <HI>and the contrary</HI> VICES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SOBRIETY is a very extensive virtue, which is not only opposed to <HI>drunkenness</HI> and <HI>intemperance</HI> (as it is commonly understood;) but to all <HI>levity of mind</HI> and <HI>irregularity of the passions, appetites</HI> and <HI>affections.</HI>—Indeed, to be <HI>sober,</HI> is to perform the third part of our Christian duty. <Q>We must deny all ungodliness and every worldly lust, and live godly, righteously and soberly in this world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 12.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. THERE is an intoxication or drunkenness of the mind, as well as of the body; and the <HI>scripture</HI> or <HI>go∣spel sobriety</HI> is particularly, if not chiefly opposed to this vice. All temperate and abstemious men, are not so∣ber men. <HI>Young women</HI> and <HI>deacons wives</HI> are command∣ed to be sober<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 4. 1 Tim. iii. 11.</NOTE>; and it would be indecent to imagine, that this was a caution against intemperance in drink∣ing. Young men are exhorted to be sober-minded<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tit. i. 6.</NOTE>; which shews that this virtue relates to the government of the mind, as well as to that of the bodily appetites. —Sobriety is also opposed to <HI>gaiety</HI> and <HI>vanity in dress</HI> in women, and pertness or immodesty of behaviour: <Q>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but with good works<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Tim. ii. 9.</NOTE>.</Q>—It is also opposed to <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>self-conceit</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 3.</NOTE>: <Q>Let no man think of him∣self

<P N="3">3. SOBRIETY, therefore, as it is a <HI>mental virtue,</HI> seems to signify <HI>gravity</HI> and <HI>decorum</HI> of thought and behaviour; and consists in a due and prudent regulation of the pas∣sions, appetites, affections and actions, and is opposed to <HI>levity, sickleness</HI> and <HI>inconstancy of mind; to pride, self-con∣ceit,</HI> and extravagant <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>affections</HI> of all sorts.— So that a sober man, is one who is discreet, humble, prudent, composed, patient, meek, grave and exampla∣ry in all manner of life and conversation.</P>
<P N="4">4. SOBRIETY is also often particularly opposed to in∣temperance in drinking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. i. 6,—8. 1 Pet. iv. 7. 1 Tim. iii. 2. Tit. i. 8. —ii. 2, 12. Acts xxvi. 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. DRUNKENNESS which is the opposite to sobriety in this sense of it, is, in itself, <HI>a great evil,</HI> and productive of many others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 29, 30, 33.</NOTE>. (1.) It is expressly and repeated∣ly forbidden in the gospel, under the penalty of forfeit∣ing the favour of GOD and eternal life, 1 Cor. vi. 10. Gal. v. 21. Matth. xxiv. 48, 51. (2.) Christ and his Apostles, have warned Christians against it, in a very singular, and most urgent manner; and no wonder, see∣ing it is in itself so beastly a vice, and attended with so many hurtful consequences with regard to men's <HI>bodies, souls,</HI> reputation and worldly interests. (3.) It is a vice peculiarly Heathen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 12, 13, 14, 1 Thes. v. 8.</NOTE>. (4.) It wholly unmans us;—renders us stupid and ridiculous, just objects of ridicule and contempt, even to children, servants, and idiots<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxix. i. Hos. iv. 11.</NOTE>. (5.) It incapacitates us for all the duties we owe to GOD, our families, our neighbours, and our∣selves; and puts us in the way of doing the most
<PB N="171" REF="014137_0170_0F97D523F3466F30"/>wicked and hurtful actions. (6.) It justly renders us unworthy of all trust and confidence from others. (7.) It lays us open an easy prey to all knavish and designing men; lays the foundation of many chronical and acute diseases, and generally brings its votaries to poverty, contempt, and an unpitied and premature death.</P>
<P N="6">6. IN order that we may be preserved from this most disgraceful and most destructive of all vices, the following maxims and cautions may be found service∣able.—(1.) Shun the company of such as are addicted to this swinish vice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 20.—xxiv. 20, 21.—iv. 14, 15. Hab. ii. 15.</NOTE>.—Tarry not long among those who are in the way to excess, how sober soever their general character may be, lest you should be induced to run to the <HI>same excess of riot,</HI> and so contract a vicious habit.—(3.) Take care never to exceed that quantity of wine or strong liquor, which you find by experience to be a proper and moderate refreshment. The boun∣dary of temperance is so very narrow, that we may easily exceed it; which, if we do, we lose the com∣mand of ourselves, and may quickly be hurried to the greatest length of excess.—(4.) Endeavour never to make strong liquor necessary to your refreshment. There is much wisdom in laying restraints on the appetites, at times, even in the use of innocent enjoyments. These wholesome restraints strengthen self-power and self-go∣vernment.—(5.) Shun habitual idleness, which is com∣monly the parent of drunkenness, gaming and most other pernicious vices.—(6.) Frequently consider the <HI>shame,</HI> the <HI>folly</HI> and the <HI>horrid guilt</HI> and danger of drunken∣ness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxix. 19, 20.</NOTE>.—(7.)

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXV. CHRISTIAN COURAGE <HI>or</HI> FORTITUDE, <HI>and its opposites.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FORTITUDE or courage, is that temper or disposition of mind which sets a man upon do∣ing <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>commendable</HI> actions in the face of any <HI>danger</HI> or <HI>opposition</HI> which may lie in his way. Nay, the truly brave man is rather <HI>animated</HI> than <HI>disheartened,</HI> by the number or greatness of the dangers and difficulties which lie in the way of his duty. <Q>The righteous is bold as a lion; and he that hath clean hands grows stronger and stronger.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. CHRISTIAN courage or fortitude, is a being <HI>bold, fearless</HI> and <HI>intrepid</HI> in the cause of Christ, and in our du∣ty and allegiance to him. As bravery in war has been ever esteemed the highest proof of courage, (because <HI>life,</HI> the dearest of all earthly enjoyments, is risked in war) so we borrow our idea of Christian courage, from the state of christianity in this world, which is very properly represented as a state of warfare;—and to exercise Christian courage, is but another phrase for <Q>being good <HI>soldiers of Jesus Christ,</HI></Q> who is called very expres∣sively the <HI>Captain of our salvation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. COURAGE naturally supposes difficulties, dangers and opposition; for, without these, there could be no proper trial or exercise of this virtue. This therefore proves, that the Christian life, as a state of warfare, is not that easy, inactive, indolent thing, which the gene∣rality of nominal professors seem to imagine; but a life of conflict, full of hazards, difficulties and opposition; and that he who has never experienced and encountered
<PB N="173" REF="014137_0172_0F97D525735C4508"/>these, has never yet truly enlisted himself under the banner of Jesus, nor wared a good warfare.</P>
<P N="4">4. COURAGE, in order to denominate it a <HI>Christian virtue,</HI> must, as well as <HI>zeal,</HI> be founded upon <HI>knowledge,</HI> and a rational conviction, not only of the goodness of the cause in which we are engaged, but also of the dif∣ficulties we have to encounter; the risk we run; the measure of our strength; the aids and succours we have to expect, and the wages we have to receive if we come off conquerors. In short, it supposes that we have <HI>counted the cost</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xiv. 26,—33. Phil. iii. 7,—14. Acts xx. 22,—24. Rom. viii. 18. 2 Cor. iv. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE necessity and expediency of Christian forti∣tude will appear from the <HI>numerous, subtile</HI> and <HI>powerful</HI> enemies of our salvation: (1.) From invisible, malig∣nant spirits<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ehp. vi. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE>. (2.) From our own lusts and corrup∣tions, which treacherously take part with these spiritual enemies against us, and being, as it were, our very selves, are the more difficult to deny, mortify and con∣quer. (3.) From our fellow creatures, who too often use every artifice to allure us to sin, or to shame and fright us from duty.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of our Christian duties ab∣solutely require the exercise of this virtue. What for∣titude must it require to comply with that exhortation of our Lord, <Q>If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me?</Q> <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>self-conquest</HI> are the noblest feats of cou∣rage, and require the exertions of a firm, resolute and determined soul. <Q>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 32.</NOTE>.</Q> To be more particular: (1.) Repentance, which is a general and indispensable
<PB N="174" REF="014137_0173_0F97D526332619D8"/>Christian duty, requires the utmost degree of fortitude and resolution to subdue and eradicate old rooted habits, and to deny ourselves such things as we have long had great pleasure in, and to abstain from which, will be ex∣tremely painful. We must forsake old companions; re∣solutely withstand their enticements to sin and vanity, endure their scoffs, and, at length, their rage. It may happen, that we cannot truly repent without disobliging our nearest relations and dearest friends; without dis∣continuing <HI>gainful business,</HI> as well as renouncing <HI>beloved lusts;</HI> or without making acknowledgments for injuries done, and restoring, with shame, what we have unjustly acquired. But under all these difficult and self-denying duties, the cowardly and irresolute man must shameful∣ly succumb.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) .THE false opinions and depraved customs of the world make sad havock among human souls, and it is the duty of every Christian to oppose them, and to counteract their mischievous tendency. The evange∣lical precept is, <Q>Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds.</Q> Now, the false maxims and depraved cus∣toms of the world, like irresistable torrents, sweep the cowardly and irresolute Christian along with them. He hears his religious opinions ridiculed; his GOD irreve∣rently mentioned; his Saviour traduced, and his pious friends made the laughing stock of fools, yet dares not reply; fears to be rude; dreads the ridicule or resent∣ment of some fellow-worm—nay, perhaps the same pusillanimity leads him basely to lend the smile of seeming approbation to this wickedness, and at length cordially to fall into it himself. But the resolute and courageous Christian, dares to be singularly good; he dares to stem the torrent of popular depravity and chr∣ruption; —he dares to be pious and upright, against the example of <HI>the multitude who do iniquity.</HI>—He can
<PB N="175" REF="014137_0174_0F97D526F34B5CE8"/>bear to be laughed at as an unfashionable fool, by both the great and little vulgar, with all the fortitude and magnanimity of a Christian hero. He shines as a light in the world, amidst a crooked and perverse generation, holding forth the word of life, and counting it all joy to be persecuted for righteousness sake. We the whole world to deride, to persecute, to oppose him, he would, with the heroic leader of Israel's tribes, resolve, <Q>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxiv. 15.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="3">(3.) To be brief: Would we see the excellency and necessity of Christian fortitude, we must view the Christi∣an in the following stations of duty and of providence— Reproving sin—opposing error—propagating truth— conssicting with temptation—struggling under the pressure of pain and heavy calamities and afflictions— exposed to the rage and malignity of persecuting zeal— and upon the very verge of eternity, encountering <HI>death,</HI> the <HI>last</HI> and <HI>most terrific</HI> enemy in the Christian warfare:—Especially, in the awful hour of death, and amidst the agonies of dissolving nature, the irresolute man is stupified with horror. He dares not take a re∣trospect of his by-past life, nor look into the fathomless abyss of eternity. He recollects, that the face of man has often terrified him so, as to make him do violence to conscience: How then shall he behold the face of GOD, whom he hath offended through a sinful fear of man, and of whose words he has been ashamed before an <HI>adulterous generation? Fearful</HI> he clings to life; <HI>re∣luctant</HI> he starts back from the brink of eternity, and dreads the sight of his almighty judge. Dismal for∣bodings sill his soul with distressful agonies, and he quits the world, leaving the spectators under a painful uncertainty whither he is gone.—But the Christian who has courageously served his GOD in life, is gene∣rally bold as a lion in the near prospect of death.—
<PB N="176" REF="014137_0175_0F97D527B30FB760"/>To him, death is a messenger of peace. He triumphs over his terrors through the blood of the Lamb; en∣quires fearless for his sting, and demands his guidance to the unknown regions of eternity! <HI>There</HI> he expects congratulating angels to meet him. <HI>There</HI> he hopes to see GOD as his reconciled Father, face to face, and that wonderful God-man Christ Jesus, who was so much his friend as to die for him;—to see him exalted to the highest honours,—exalted to be his judge:—And recol∣lecting some of the tokens and manisestations of his love, he desires now to testify to all around him, the <HI>grace,</HI> and <HI>faithfulness</HI> and <HI>loving kindness</HI> of his Lord. He dies in hope; dies exulting; moves and instructs the spectators of his exit, and perhaps does more honour to GOD, and more good to his fellow-men, in his death, than he has been enabled to do in all his life.</P>
<P N="7">7. FAITH begets this virtue in the soul, and gives vigour to all its acts and exertions. (1.) By that faith, which is the evidence of things not seen, we perceive, that the cause we have espoused is good; that it is the cause of GOD and of Christ; the cause in which the eternal interest of our souls is embarked. (2.) By faith we see the arm of omnipotence stretched out for our succour, and may say, with humble confidence, that we have <HI>almighty strength,</HI> respecting what we have to en∣counter with in the way of our duty. How base then to be <HI>dastardly</HI> and <HI>faint-hearted,</HI> with such odds on our side? (3.) By the eye of faith we see the glorious Cap∣tain of our salvation spreading his standard over us— standing with a celestial crown in his hand to reward our valour, and millions of our fellow-soldiers, behold∣ing, as it were, from the battlements of heaven, our be∣haviour in the Christian race and warfare. Seeing then we are encompassed with such a cloud of witnesses, ought we not, <Q>Laying aside every weight, and the sin
<PB N="177" REF="014137_0176_0F97D528740CBCD0"/>which easily besets us, to run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus<NOTE N="*">1 Cor. ix. 23. 2 Tim. iv. S. Heb. xii. 1,—4.</NOTE>?</Q> (3.) By faith we look back and behold the gracious army of <HI>martyrs, apostles, prophets,</HI> and <HI>patriarchs,</HI> who were bold to attempt, and resolute to perform the most ar∣duous things. <HI>These</HI> have each conquered singly, and triumphed. <HI>These</HI> were <HI>men</HI> as <HI>we are,</HI> and justly expect that we should behave with equal ardour, fortitude and perseverance in the Christian warfare. They seem to chide our sloth, and animate us to activity by observing, that <Q>GOD is still almighty;—that our religion is still divine;—that our Redeemer is still the same Jesus, and his gospel worthy as much honour now as ever it has been.</Q></P>

<PB N="178" REF="014137_0177_0F97D52932F4B168"/>contending for the truth of his word; testifying our confidence in it, and discouraging every indecent free∣dom with it. (6.) By vindicating his providential go∣vernment, and displaying the wisdom, goodness and equity of his ways. These are, doubtless, some of the principal ends for which the tongue is given to man.</P>
<P N="2">2. A VERY good and noble use of the tongue is, to promote by it the good of our neighbour; which we may do, (1.) By labouring to instruct the ignorant in what may relate to the concerns of his body; but more especially in what respects his soul. (2.) By commen∣dation, in such manner as may be an encouragement to him to proceed in the way of godliness and virtue, so as to advance his good name, and extend the sphere of his usefulness: But in this good office, we should guard in a particular manner against flattery, or imprudent com∣mendation, which is deadly poison to most men. (4.) By <HI>peace-making:</HI> There being nothing more destruc∣tive to religion and virtue than malicious strife; nor any thing more unseemly in a Christian. Those there∣fore who are the happy instruments of removing this hellish evil from between men, are, in a peculiar man∣ner, considered by the GOD of peace as <HI>his children:</HI> And, (5.) By vindicating injured characters and persons. This is doing very great service to men; discovers a no∣ble spirit, and is an office that procures the esteem of men, and GOD doubtless regards the discharge of it with complacence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 35,—37.</NOTE>. (6.) One of the noblest and most benevolent uses of the tongue, towards our fellow-crea∣tures, after instructing them in the principles of religion, and animating them to the practice of it; is to pour the balm of consolation into the wounded spirit. Words fitly spoken to the broken in heart; to those agoniz∣ing souls who are sinking as it were, under the pressure of some heavy affliction into the black sea of despair, are in∣deed
<PB N="179" REF="014137_0178_0F97D529F2EF8530"/>like <HI>apples of gold in pictures of silver.</HI> Can there be a more <HI>God-like, Christian-like</HI> office than to sooth the throbbings of the anxious mind; to give it, <Q>beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the gar∣ment of praise for the spirit of heaviness?</Q> This is one of the most amiable and benevolent offices of the gracious Redeemer, <Q>To bind up the broken hearted and to comfort all that mourn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxi. 1,—3.</NOTE>.</Q> And such as imi∣tate him in this branch of his prophetic office, are, to their sorrowing distressed fellow-creatures, as <HI>rivers of water in a dry place,</HI> and the <HI>shadow of a great rock in a weary land:</HI> They are <HI>a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, and a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxxii. 2.—xxv. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER Christian use of the tongue, is to ma∣nage it so as not to <HI>destroy,</HI> but to <HI>increase,</HI> mutual confi∣dence among men. This must be done by maintaining a strict correspondence between <HI>our words</HI> and <HI>our thoughts.</HI> Whenever we speak, an honest upright heart should dictate our speech, and we should on no pretence, tell a lie, not even that good may come<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 8. Psal. xv. 1, 2.</NOTE>. Great regard should be paid in particular to our promises; to pro∣mise nothing or enter into no engagements but such as we are deliberately resolved to perform at all hazards.— In short, our words should contain nothing but truth, and the whole truth, reserving nothing, where the re∣serve would amount to the consequence of a lie in pre∣judicing any. Yet in some cases it may be lawful to reserve <HI>a part of the truth</HI>—or to use something of a feint. See 1 Sam. xvi. 2.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXVII. <HI>The</HI> UNCHRISTIAN ABUSES <HI>of the</HI> TONGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE unchristian abuses of the tongue, form a strong contrast to the former subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the noblest use of the tongue, consists in those exercises of it which tend to celebrate, magnify and glorify the blessed GOD, and set forth his excellencies to our fellow-creatures; so whatever has a direct, or indi∣rect tendency to dishonour GOD, or give our fellow-creatures <HI>wrong, mean,</HI> and <HI>unworthy</HI> apprehensions of him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the most <HI>capital sins</HI> and <HI>abuses</HI> of the tongue— such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, (1.) atheistical speeches: As saying, that <HI>there is no</HI> GOD; denying or disputing his being, or in∣sinuating such hints and arguments, as tend to destroy this belief in ourselves or fellow-creatures. This is striking at the glory of GOD with a witness, and erazing the very foundations of all religion among men. Equal∣ly pernicious are those speeches and arguments, which, while they seem to admit the being of a GOD, insinuate, that he did not create, and does not rule and govern the world:—Or, allowing his universal providence, in giving general laws to nature, while they deny his par∣ticular providence, or his ordering and over-ruling all the particular actions of his creatures.—Nor is it a whit better to deny GOD'S moral government of his ra∣tional creatures; that he is the <HI>observer of men;</HI> the wit∣ness and judge, the rewarder and punisher of their mo∣ral conduct. To this may be added the vile guilt of robbing GOD of any of his persections, of his omnisci∣ence, omnipresence, his holiness, justice, mercy or
<PB N="181" REF="014137_0180_0F97D52B731E6D00"/>truth;—or of extolling any of these perfections, to the prejudice of the rest.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) BLASPHEMY: Either cursing GOD, as <HI>Job</HI>'s wife would have persuaded him to do; or challenging GOD to come forth, and do his worst; or boldly and insolently defying his vengeance; or charging him foolishly, as cruel and unjust, and laying more on us than we deserve; or boldly calling down his vengeance upon ourselves or others; or sporting with his judg∣ments, undervaluing his mercies, and ridiculing his works, or word, or providences. This is to do all that we can to debase and vilisy the Almighty, by speaking of him in a manner that we dared not to do of a digni∣fied fellow-worm.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) PROFANITY, nearly bordering on the former. Speaking slightly and disrespectfully of holy things and ordinances, and that holiness which is the image of GOD on his people;—mimicking and mocking holy ac∣tions, such as prayer, preaching, the sacraments, and the like;—making a jest of the scriptures, and using them proverbially to prosane purposes;—speaking slightingly of the laws of GOD and the rules of holiness, as not worth our notice;—making a mock at sin as a meer trifle, and talking of the most awful and serious matters, such as death, judgment, heaven and hell, in such a slight, vain, and sportive manner, as plainly shews that we have no practical belief of them.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) SOLEMN perjury; or calling GOD to witness a known lie, and praying down his vengeance upon us, in case our declaration be not true, when we know that it is not.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) COMMON swearing; which by the frequent and familiar abuse of GOD'S holy name, lessens our own re∣verence and that of others for an oath; turns the vene∣rable name of JEHOVAH, into a meer <HI>scarecrow,</HI> or an <HI>empty sound,</HI> to convey our hellish passions to others, and
<PB N="182" REF="014137_0181_0F97D52C33442158"/>paves the way to <HI>customary, horrid perjury.</HI> This is an abuse of the tongue, which, besides its being forbidden by the word of GOD, on the penalty of his severest dis∣pleasure, is attended with neither pleasure, profit nor ho∣nour; —is rude, barbarous, uncivil, and unmeaning, and fit only for <HI>devils</HI> and <HI>damned spirits.</HI></P>
<P N="6">(6.) THE common and profane use of GOD'S name, even where neither cursing, swearing, nor damning is annexed to it: Such as, O GOD! O LORD! O CHRIST! <HI>E Gad! O Je!</HI> and GOD bless us! CHRIST bless us! and the like, when they are spoken in a <HI>light, unmeaning, customary</HI> manner: For, as GOD'S name is sa∣cred and glorious, so every <HI>common use</HI> of it, is an <HI>irreve∣rent abuse</HI> of it, and is expressly forbidden in the third commandment, <Q>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy GOD in vain, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. As the next important use of the tongue, is to pro∣mote the good of our fellow-creatures; so, whatever tends directly, or indirectly to hurt or injure our neigh∣bour, in any of his interests, is a <HI>vile, unchristian, diaboli∣cal</HI> abuse of it. Indeed, all the above-mentioned abuses of it, are against <HI>Christian charity:</HI> For, though they di∣rectly and immediately tend to dishonour GOD, yet they mediately and indirectly tend to corrupt and ruin our neighbour. Indeed, whatever sin comes the length of the tongue, <HI>is,</HI> and necessarily <HI>must be</HI> desiling to all around us, who are disposed to receive infection. But the abuses of the tongue, which are most immediately repugnant to Christian charity, are the following: (1.) <HI>Direct lying,</HI> or <HI>untruth:</HI> For, as the tongue and speech were given to be a true and regular <HI>index</HI> and <HI>interpreter</HI> of the mind; so a man who speaks not truth, is like a <HI>clock</HI> whose hand points to the wrong hour, or like a <HI>com∣pass</HI> whose needle deviates from the true pole, <HI>useless</HI> and <HI>worth nothing.</HI> Besides, as truth is the foundation of all right intercourse between men, so there could be no liv∣ing
<PB N="183" REF="014137_0182_0F97D52E395AF7D8"/>in society, or transacting business with our fellow-creatures, if falsehood prevailed universally. Indeed, truth is so <HI>sacred, valuable</HI> and <HI>important</HI> a branch of Chri∣stian morality, and so essentially necessary to the well∣being of human society, that it should never be violated, even in jest, or upon the slightest and most trivial occa∣sions.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) DISSIMULATION: Either by willfully conceal∣ing necessary truth, or speaking in a doubtful, ambigu∣ous, enigmatical manner, with a design to deceive or mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lead our neighbour.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) DOUBLE-DEALING; being fair to our neigh∣bour's face, and otherwise behind his back.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) MISREPRESENTING a <HI>story</HI> or <HI>fact,</HI> which is one of the most mischievous kinds of lying and back-biting; for, by omitting <HI>one single word</HI> or <HI>circumstance</HI> of a story or fact, it may be quite altered to the unspeakable pre∣judice of our neighbour and of the truth.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) DECEITFUL-PROMISING: Causing our neigh∣bour to rely on a promise, which we either do not in∣tend to persorm at all, or which we have no hope of being able to perform punctually, at the time and in the manner proposed: This makes unspeakable confusion in the <HI>trading world,</HI> and in every other department of life, and tends effectually to ruin our character, and ve∣ry often our neighbour's too, who is led to deceive others on the strength of our promise.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) BEARING FALSE WITNESS against our neigh∣bour; either by telling known and malicious lies to the prejudice of our neighbour, in the way of calumny, slander and back-biting; or by unnecessarily abetting, propagating and spreading the slanders of others, whom we have reason to suspect of malice against him: Much more, by taking away his life, interest, or good name, by perjury.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) SPEAKING the very worst that we can of our
<PB N="184" REF="014137_0183_0F97D52E732EA170"/>neighbour, consistent with truth, with a designed con∣cealing any good qualities he possesses, on purpose to hurt his character or interest, or to impede his useful∣ness: For, we may do unspeakable hurt often, even by speaking <HI>improper</HI> and <HI>unseasonable</HI> truths: But nothing short of <HI>Christian charity</HI> and <HI>prudence</HI> can direct in this matter.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) DIVULGING and <HI>blabbing</HI> out such secrets as our neighbour may have, in confidence entrusted us with, either with a malicious design to hurt him, or through meer imprudence, and a tatling disposition.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) ALL such abusive, ignominious names and in∣sulting language, either <HI>of</HI> or <HI>to</HI> our neighbour, as tends to break Christian charity, stir up anger, and occasion quarrels and law-suits; which besides their provoking nature and unhappy consequences, prove the want of charity, meekness, humility and patience, and are a scandal and disgrace to our common Christianity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 21,—26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) ALL sporting with, and mocking at the <HI>sins</HI> and <HI>natural infirmities</HI> of our neighbour, and speaking, lessen∣ing degrading things of him, on account of the latter.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) VAIN, <HI>idle, unedifying</HI> conversation, which neither tends to <HI>comfort</HI> or <HI>improve</HI> either ourselves or others, especially if it is continued long, to the destruction of our own, or our neighbour's precious time: For, we are told, we shall <Q>give an account of every idle word we speak at the day of judgment.</Q></P>
<P N="12">(12.) PROPAGATING evil, pernicious principles and doctrines, which tend to poison our neighbour's mind, and to pave the way for a vicious practice.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) FLATTERING our neighbour in his follies and vices, and thereby feeding his pride and strengthening his hands in folly and wickedness; more especially, with the detestable view of getting some savour from him, or advantage over him, as the reward of this iniquity.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="185" REF="014137_0184_0F97D52F351AF498"/>
(14.) ABUSING our neighbour's confidence in us, by giving him bad or ruinous advice, when we hope to benefit by his complying with it.</P>
<P N="15">(15.) CORRUPTING our neighbour, and seducing <HI>him</HI> or <HI>her</HI> to sin, and thereby committing the very worst kind of murder, both upon the soul and body of our neighbour.</P>
<P N="16">(16.) BY filthy songs, or corrupt and profane speeches, polluting and debauching the minds and hearts of our neighbours, and inducing them to the love and practice of sin.</P>
<P N="17">(17.) INSTEAD of comforting the sick, afflicted and distressed, laughing at and insulting their miseries, and thereby doubling the burthen of their sorrows.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE sins of the <HI>longue</HI> are the most numerous class of all our sins, except those of the <HI>heart;</HI> and indeed, they will never be much lessened, until the heart is re∣newed and sanctified by divine grace.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the sins of the tongue are the <HI>most destructive,</HI> as well as the <HI>most numerous,</HI> we had need to set a double guard over the motions of this unruly member, seeing that in no way are we like more to disgrace our Chris∣tian profession, than by an unbridled tongue.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE right use and government of the tongue, is one of the <HI>least doubtful proofs</HI> of true religion.—<Q>If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. If any man among you seem to be religious and bridle not, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 26.—iii. 2.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXXVIII. <HI>The best</HI> METHOD <HI>of maintaining</HI> PEACE, LOVE, <HI>and</HI> UNITY <HI>among</HI> CHRISTIAN BRETHREN.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONSIDER, that although Christianity is a <HI>perfect institution,</HI> and tending to make <HI>Chris∣tians perfect;</HI> yet Christians being only in the way of cure, in a state of recovery, do not arrive at absolute perfection in this life, at least, not before death.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is therefore <HI>absurd</HI> and <HI>unreasonable</HI> in one Chris∣tian to expect absolute perfection in the character and temper of another, while here below in the school of Christ. As long as I live, I will have my failings and infirmities, and my brother will have his.—Hence arises,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE duty of, and obligation to, <HI>mutual forbearance</HI> among Christian brethren: For, if I hope and expect, that any brother will <HI>bear with my failings</HI> and <HI>infirmities</HI> in temper and conduct, and will have pity and compas∣sion on my weakness; justice and charity require that <HI>I should bear with his,</HI> and not be <HI>over rigid</HI> and <HI>severe</HI> in my requirements from him. If not, I <HI>do not</HI> unto others, as I <HI>would they should do unto me,</HI> and am become a trans∣gressor of this golden rule of equity.</P>
<P N="4">4. IF this Christian maxim of <HI>bear and forbear,</HI> or of <HI>pitying,</HI> and, in love, <HI>forgiving one another,</HI> is not regarded and observed, there cannot possibly be any such thing as a Christian society, great or small, held together upon earth.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE failings and imperfections of our Christian brethren, though very undesirable in themselves, yet are over-ruled to serve excellent purposes in this state of trial
<PB N="187" REF="014137_0186_0F97D530B31C6960"/>and probation: Upon them are grafted some of the noblest Christian virtues, such as <HI>charity, meekness, patience, self-denial, compassion, forbearance,</HI> and a <HI>forgiving temper;</HI>— and they are excellent <HI>touch-stones,</HI> whereby we may exa∣mine and prove our own spirits, and discover whether we are indeed possessed of these Christian graces, <HI>i. e.</HI> whether we are Christians.</P>
<P N="6">6. WHOLLY to break society and fellowship with my Christian brother or brethren, because <HI>he</HI> or <HI>they</HI> have offended me, speaks the most unsufferable pride.—It is, in plain construction, to presume that I myself am per∣fect and blameless, and need no forbearance or for∣giveness from my brethren.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF GOD should break with us for every offence, what would become of us? Yet the example of GOD and of CHRIST are expressly set before us for our imi∣tation in this duty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 2, 32. Col. iii. 13, 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. BUT what are the terms and conditions of for∣giving, or being reconciled with our Christian bro∣ther, when he offends us? I answer, <HI>signs of true peni∣tence;</HI> and to forgive him, and be reconciled with him, and keep up Christian fellowship and communion with him, upon <HI>these signs,</HI> is a Christian duty so indispensably necessary, that our Saviour has charged us, if our Chris∣tian brother offend us, not only <HI>seven times,</HI> but even <HI>se∣venty times seven, i. e.</HI> 490 times in one day, and return, and say, <HI>I repent,</HI> we must <HI>as often forgive him</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 15,—35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="9">9. BUT are there not some offences, which, though they claim our forgiveness, yet give just cause of our quitting all Christian fellowship and society with our brethren? Answer. No offence can justify <HI>private re∣venge</HI> in a Christian. If my brother should even attempt to take away my life, and turn again and shew signs of
<PB N="188" REF="014137_0187_0F97D53172DA72A8"/>true sorrow and penitence, I must as a Christian, forgive him and be reconciled with him; though, in such cases, public justice must be allowed to take place for the good of society: But, a man who is called a <HI>brother,</HI> may, by the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of his offences, and by a <HI>proud, haughty, impenitent</HI> disposition, render himself wholly un∣worthy of Christian fellowship and communion in any society; yet so as to be again received and re-admitted, upon giving proper signs of true penitence.</P>
<P N="10">10. BUT must we <HI>so put up with,</HI> and <HI>forbear</HI> the fail∣ings and infirmities of our Christian brethren, as to ne∣glect the duties of <HI>reproof</HI> and <HI>admonition,</HI> lest we break the bond of peace, and provoke or displease our offend∣ing brother? Answer. By no means. This would be to <HI>suffer sin upon our brother. Unity</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> among Christi∣an brethren, must be founded on, and comport with truth, integrity and a charitable zeal for each other's welfare. We are to continue rebuking and exhorting, in a Christian manner, but never to break the bond of Christian fellowship, till men appear to be <HI>incorrigible re∣probates. I</HI> have <HI>one failing, you</HI> have <HI>another:</HI> I must bear with your failing, while I use every endeavour to correct it; <HI>you</HI> must do the same by <HI>me.</HI> No giving up with this mutual duty, till we both get to heaven; where, being both perfect, we shall have no need of mu∣tual sorbearance and forgiveness.</P>
<P N="11">11. I WILL not renounce or disown my <HI>natural bro∣ther,</HI> nor quit the family, though he offends me, or is angry with me without cause. He is my <HI>brother,</HI> and a multitude of tender and endearing considerations plead for forgiveness, and a re-establishment of peace and uni∣ty: And shall I renounce and disown a <HI>Christian bro∣ther,</HI> and quit <HI>the fellowship of the saints,</HI> for the like rea∣son, where the obligations to brotherly love are much more <HI>numerous, sacred</HI> and <HI>noble,</HI> and the motives to for∣giveness and unity, much more tender and endearing.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="189" REF="014137_0188_0F97D53232BF2A48"/>
12. THE same reasons which will engage us to quit one Christian society, because of the failings and infir∣mities of our brethren, should engage us to quit the fel∣lowship of the church itself; and then we renounce all union and communion with the body of Christ, and putting ourselves out of the way of all the means of sal∣vation, do <HI>virtually</HI> renounce heaven itself, <HI>i. e.</HI> aposta∣tize!</P>
<P N="13">13. IF we are indeed Christians, we must all <HI>meet in heaven,</HI> and <HI>there</HI> live together as friends, in one society for ever: And shall we part society for every trisle on the road, where we have so much need of each other's mutual advice, reproof, forbearance and charity?</P>
<P N="14">14. CONSIDER the damage done to Christianity by <HI>schism</HI> and <HI>divisions</HI> among Christian brethren; the plea∣sure it gives to the <HI>devil;</HI> the tendency it has to prevent others from uniting themselves to those communities, from which deserters have carried off an evil report, and the malicious and wicked triumph it gives to the envi∣ous enemies of Christian union, communion and peace, and the injury it does to the great and noble designs of such societies.</P>
<P N="15">15. IF a deserter from a religious society should be asked by an enemy of religion, what his reason was for deserting? Consider the danger he is in of wounding religion in the answer he must make. <Q>I did not like the men; or, I did not like their proceedings; or, I got no good, but rather harm, by being of the num∣ber.</Q> Here a man speaks at once <HI>uncharitably</HI> of his Christian brethren, and <HI>falsely</HI> and <HI>unfavourtably</HI> of the ways of GOD: For, few men are so just and modest as to declare the true reasons of such a conduct, and to lay the blame, where it properly is, upon their own fickle∣ness, inconstancy, unchristian disposition, and distaste and disrelish to that which is good; or, perhaps, a mean and
<PB N="190" REF="014137_0189_0F97D40FF446D7D0"/>vile ambition to please and gratity some declared and malicious enemy to so good a design.</P>
<P N="16">16. LET a man consider, whether, on his <HI>death-bed,</HI> he could approve of having broken the bonds of Chri∣stian peace and unity, and quitted a society, formed on Christian principles, and in which he might have both <HI>done</HI> and <HI>received</HI> some spiritual good; merely, because all his Christian brethren were not just, in all respects, such as he would have them; while he himself had pos∣sibly as great failings as any among them.</P>
<P N="17">17. REAL <HI>offences</HI> from our Christian brethren can∣not justify our quitting Christian communion: Much less <HI>supposed offences,</HI> or <HI>real benefits,</HI> so miscalled.</P>

<P>THE general rule given by our Saviour to this purpose, may be found, Matth. vii. 1, &amp;c. "Judge not that ye be not judged, &amp;c."—It is evident, however, from <HI>reason</HI> and from <HI>other scriptures,</HI> that this rule has a great many important exceptions, and that our Saviour does not mean to prohibit <HI>every kind</HI> of judg∣ing of our neighbour.—For,</P>
<P N="1">1.

2.

Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is so far from being a <HI>sin,</HI> that it is an eminent proof and branch of love and Christian charity, to fear for our Christian brethren, and be jealous over them with a godly jealousy, lest they should be overtaken by the temptations which surround them, and to warn and admonish them against their danger<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 3.</NOTE>;—also, to <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>condemn</HI> them for things plainly <HI>erroneous</HI> in their principles, or <HI>immoral</HI> in their conduct, and in tenderness and love, sharply to reprove and rebuke them<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lev. xix. 17.

<P N="5">5.

<P N="1">(1.) JUDGING out of our province, or passing a judg∣ment on persons or things which we have no right to interfere with. Ministers have no right to interfere in the proper office of Magistrates; nor Magistrates, in those <HI>peculiar</HI> to Ministers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 13, 14.</NOTE>. The Apostle would not <HI>censure</HI> or <HI>inflict spiritual punishments</HI> on those who were <HI>out of the church</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cor. v. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) PRAGMATICALLY judging, deciding and deter∣mining in-matters above our knowledge and reach, and where we can have no evidence of the truth, which is the only ground of right judging:—Such as <HI>ignorant men,</HI> censuring <HI>deep and learned opinions,</HI>—or our taking upon us to judge of the <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>designs</HI> of men's <HI>hearts.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) SEVERE censuring and judging of others, for things in their own nature indifferent. Pretending that to be wrong in men, which we cannot prove to be so; requiring that in them, which GOD hath not required; forbidding that to them which GOD hath not for∣bidden, and condemning them for not <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>forbear∣ing</HI> such things.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) BLIND and <HI>rash</HI> judging of our neighbour, with∣out plain and sufficient conviction of his guilt. A dis∣posedness to censure, and pass sentence against him, be∣fore we know the crime, or know he is guilty of it: Suspecting him of evil principles and evil designs in his actions, and raising these suspicions into accusations against him, before full evidence, or any evidence at all
<PB N="193" REF="014137_0192_0F97D41234769E48"/>appears, whereon to ground these suspicions.—This is censoriousness and rash judging with a witness; incon∣sistent with <HI>equity</HI> or <HI>brotherly love.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) TAKING up an evil report against our neigh∣bour, upon <HI>hear-say,</HI> or mere <HI>common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame,</HI> and joining with the censorious and malevolent world, in the <HI>hue</HI> and <HI>cry</HI> against our neighbour, before a particular and candid inquiry into the truth of the allegation. This proves that we have no Christian love for our neighbour, no tender∣ness for his good name; but that we delight in scandal, and are evil disposed to our neighbour.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) CRUELLY and unmercifully making the very worst of our neighbour's conduct, without making proper allowances for the temptations he lay under, and the disadvantageous circumstances in which these temptation might attack him. These often greatly <HI>alleviate</HI> the guilt of the actions; and sometimes to∣tally <HI>alter their nature,</HI> and even <HI>justify</HI> them. See the <HI>shew bread</HI> eaten by <HI>David,</HI> and the ears of corn pluck∣ed by our <HI>Saviour's disciples.</HI></P>
<P N="7">(7.) PREJUDICE and <HI>partiality</HI> in judging and con∣demning the actions of others; censuring them through hatred or dislike of their person, rather than an abhorrence of their crimes; passing that fault over slightly in our∣selves, or in our friends, which we aggravate and con∣demn without mercy in our enemies, or even in indif∣ferent persons; being quick in seeing the <HI>mote in our brother's eye,</HI> while we excuse and justify <HI>the beam in our own.</HI></P>
<P N="8">(8.) UNCHARITABLE judging of others; which in∣cludes a number of cases:—1. All evil-surmisings, and groundless suspicions and jealousies.—2. Putting the worst construction on men's conduct, while it will bear better.—3. Taking upon us to judge of men's thoughts and principles, when there is nothing reproachful in their actions.—4. Judging of men's <HI>spiritual</HI> state and
<PB N="194" REF="014137_0193_0F97D412F4530CD0"/>condition, that it is evil, upon reasons which GOD'S word does not justify.—5. Running down a character by the wholesale, when there may be many <HI>good</HI> and <HI>praise worthy</HI> things in it.—6. Condemning <HI>whole nations</HI> or <HI>religious</HI> sects of men in the lump, when there are many excellent persons among them.—7. Imputing to men opinions and consequences, which they do not al∣low nor hold in order to expose them to hatred and con∣tempt. —8. To interpret calamities which befal people, as <HI>judgments from</HI> GOD for things we dislike in them; or for some supposed injuries to us, or to our friends.—9. To be backward to admit fair tokens and proofs of re∣pentance for <HI>real injuries</HI> done us; and to be unforgiving and irreconcilable, and rashly to give up all our hopes of sinners, and all endeavours for their good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cor. xiii.</NOTE>.—10. To publish the real faults of others <HI>without occasion,</HI> or with∣out a very good and warrantable design;—and much more to do it <HI>wantonly</HI> and <HI>maliciously.</HI>—11. To slander <HI>whole families, kindreds, nations, sects,</HI> or <HI>parties</HI> of men, for faults done by <HI>one</HI> or <HI>a few</HI> of them, which the others could not prevent, and which they do not approve.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XL. <HI>of a</HI> PEACEABLE DISPOSITION, <HI>and the opposite</HI> EVILS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE very distinguishing <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>genius</HI> of Christianity is <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>love;</HI> and one of the fruits of the spirit is <HI>peace;</HI>—not only a sense of recon∣ciliation and peace with GOD through the merit and intercession of Christ, and, as a fruit of this <HI>peace of con∣sicience,</HI> or an inward complacential well-pleasedness with our own state and frame, arising from the joyful hope that we are objects of the divine favour, and have pas∣sed from death unto life;—but also a <HI>loving</HI> and <HI>peace∣able</HI> disposition <HI>towards all men,</HI> arising from Christian principles and motives.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS peaceableness being a fruit of the holy Spi∣rit, must <HI>begin,</HI> and be <HI>radicated</HI> in the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>temper.</HI> So far as it is truly Christian, it supposes a <HI>change of nature:</HI> For, although some men are more indolent and easy in their temper than others, and are naturally averse to quarrelling, and fond of ease and quiet, yet they can∣not be said to <HI>love</HI> and <HI>study peace,</HI> upon gospel motives, until their natures are changed and renewed by the GOD
<PB N="196" REF="014137_0195_0F97D41475C45010"/><HI>of peace.</HI> Such persons may be said to slee from con∣tention, as a coward from a man that bruises him; not from a true and hearty dislike to quarrelling, or love of friendship.</P>
<P N="3">3. PEACEABLENESS, therefore, as a Christian tem∣per, supposes not only an hearty love and value for peace, from the amiableness of such a temper <HI>in itself,</HI> from the <HI>authority of</HI> GOD who enjoins it, in imitation of the example and Spirit of Christ, who set us the brightest pattern of it, and from the valuable purposes it serves in the world and church; but also, zealous and unwearied endeavours to maintain as peaceable disposi∣tion in ourselves towards all men, and to promote it among others. A pretence to love peace, while we are litigious and provoking, impatient, fretful and peevish, stubborn and refractory, and while we promote the quarrels of others, is the vilest and basest hypocrisy.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Apostle tells us, <Q>If it be possible, as much as in us lies, to follow peace with all men.</Q> This plainly supposes, that, however we ought zealously and sincerely to endeavour it, and to let nothing fail on our part, in order to obtain this universal peace with man∣kind, yet the thing may be often <HI>impossible to us;</HI> and that, in such cases, we cannot charge ourselves with blame.</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS may happen through the perverse humours of those with whom we have to do. Captious persons often take offence without any occasion, and will heark∣en to no reason against their preconceived prejudices. The more you yield to them, still the more unreason∣able are their demands; so that the only way of being at peace with them, is to break off all intercourse and connexion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxx. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. WITH others we cannot be at peace without vio∣lating our consciences, or acting contrary to our duty.
<PB N="197" REF="014137_0196_0F97D415348196E0"/>If we do our duty to them, or upon them, they will not be at peace with us: But we cannot, we must not buy their peace and good-will so dear, as to sell our own peace with GOD for the purchase. Neither <HI>truth,</HI> nor <HI>holiness,</HI> nor <HI>justice</HI> are to be sacrificed for peace. To obtain peace <HI>with men,</HI> we must not make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience <HI>towards</HI> GOD. Conse∣quently, those who in a modest and charitable manner, maintain and defend their own religious principles against adversaries,—or zealously reprove vice, cannot justly be charged with <HI>unpeaceableness.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. To do what in us lies to follow peace with all men, implies, that we humbly lay aside all <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>pre∣judice</HI> in the pursuit of peace; that we <HI>try,</HI> and <HI>try</HI> and <HI>try</HI> again, without wearying, as far as we lawfully may, to obtain this desirable end; and that we labour zea∣lously to promote the peace of our neighbours, with∣out widening their differences by ill offices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxiv. 14.</NOTE>. A <HI>proud man</HI> can never be a <HI>truly peaceable man.</HI> He who would seek peace and pursue it, must not be ashamed to hum∣ble himself, confess his faults, and make every needful and reasonable concession, in order to the re-establishing of peace.</P>
<P N="8">8. THIS Christian grace of peaceableness, is not con∣fined to a few friends, or to a favourite party, but must extend to <HI>all men.</HI> Some think, that if they can live at peace in their families, with their friends, their next neighbours, or their church, it is immaterial what tem∣per they have to the rest of the world, those of other islands, kingdoms, or religious professions. But peace∣ableness, as a Christian grace, arises from a principle of <HI>universal love and charity to</HI> ALL MEN, and therefore has ALL MEN for its object. As we are to love ALL MEN, and do good to ALL MEN, so, as much as in us lies, we are to live peaceably with ALL MEN; and for this purpose,
<PB N="198" REF="014137_0197_0F97D415F4E1DF50"/>our Saviour teacheth us to consider <HI>every man</HI> as <HI>our neighbour,</HI> and every <HI>true Christian</HI> in the world, be he of what denomination he will, as <HI>our brother.</HI> To this pur∣pose,</P>
<P N="9">9. WE should be careful to behave inoffensively to all men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 32.</NOTE>. A peaceable temper will restrain us from insolence, rudeness, injurious reflections, and outrage∣ous passions towards others: It will engage us to study men's tempers, and be tender of using such innocent freedoms, with passionate persons, as might be no temp∣tation to others who are of a milder temper. It will restrain us from acting the busy-body, by intermedling unnecessarily in the affairs of others, or prying into their secrets with a design to reveal them, whereby they are provoked and others inflamed. It will also engage us for conscience sake to give unto all, in their several sta∣tions, that honour and respect which is due to them, and the neglect of which might be just matter of of∣fence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 13. Prov. xxvi. 20. 1 Thess. iv. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">10. A TRULY peaceable man is <HI>slow</HI> in taking of∣fence: <HI>slow</HI> to wrath. It is amazing how many dis∣turbances and contentions happen in the world, by <HI>ap∣prehending offences</HI> where none are either <HI>meant</HI> or <HI>given.</HI> A peaceable person, will be loath to suppose that an af∣front is designed against him; he will be ready to put the best construction on doubtful words or actions; nor will he over-rate a real offence, or be willing to resent it in a hasty and rigid manner.</P>
<P N="11">11. A PEACEABLE man is not implacable, but is desirous to regain and re-establish peace as soon as pos∣sible. Peace is his element; the very temper and complexion of his soul; and therefore, when a breach happens, he watches and lays hold of the very first op∣portunity
<PB N="199" REF="014137_0198_0F97D416B466BFC8"/>of reconciliation; finding himself unhappy while in a state of variance with his neighbour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 23, 24 Luke xvii. 3, 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">12. A PEACEABLE man will rather put up with ma∣ny smaller injuries, than proceed to the rigour of justice, or commence law-suits, which are not only expensive and tedious, but almost ever widen the breach, inflame the angry passions, and procrastinate and protract the wished for term of reconciliation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 39,—41.</NOTE>. ABRAHAM affords us a fine example of a peaceable temper.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gen. xiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="13">13. WE should be most assiduous in cultivating peace and good-will, with such with whom we are most nearly connected, such as our families, neighbourhoods and churches; for, as from these, we have daily temp∣tations to anger and contention, so our strongest guard should be placed where the greatest danger lies. Be∣sides, the maintaining and promoting of peace in these connexions, is the surest way of promoting our own du∣ty and happiness, and that of others around us.</P>
<P N="14">14. ABOVE all, Christians are under the highest and most inviolable obligations to be at peace with one an∣other, by the <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>motives</HI> of their holy religion. They are the children of the GOD <HI>of peace;</HI> the dis∣ciples of the <HI>Prince of peace;</HI> peace is the bond of union among themselves; Christ has bequeathed his peace to them, and, if they are <HI>Christians indeed,</HI> they are ani∣mated and aided by <HI>the Spirit of peace and love:</HI> Besides, by an <HI>unpeaceable, strifeful, contentious</HI> temper, they at once <HI>belie</HI> and <HI>disgrace</HI> their profession, and injure the interests of their common Christianity<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 33. 2 Cor. xiii. 11.

<HEAD>ESSAY XLI. <HI>Of a</HI> MERCIFUL TEMPER, <HI>and its opposites.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. MERCY, is a <HI>kind, compassionate, sympathising</HI> concern for the <HI>miserable,</HI> which prompts to a readiness to help, relieve, or at least alleviate their mi∣series, when it is <HI>in the power</HI> of the merciful, and <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>right</HI> to be done.</P>
<P N="2">2. AS there could have been no place for the exer∣cise of the divine mercy, unless misery had made its en∣trance among creatures; so, nor could there have been place for the exercise of mercy between man and man, if mankind were not miserable.</P>
<P N="3">3. MERCY, as it is a Christian virtue, must have its seat in the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>temper;</HI> therefore, we are command∣ed to "put on bowels of mercies." It is also like all other Christian graces, a <HI>fruit of the Spirit;</HI> a part of that image of GOD reinstampt upon the fallen soul, in con∣version.
<PB N="201" REF="014137_0200_0F97D418345C24F0"/>—There may be a <HI>counterfeit appearance of mercy</HI> in the actions, from <HI>ostentation,</HI> or <HI>base</HI> and <HI>unworthy de∣signs,</HI> where there are <HI>no bowels of mercies,</HI> but rather a <HI>cruel</HI> or <HI>unfeeling</HI> disposition. The Apostle puts the highest outward appearance of a merciful disposition which can be well conceived, and yet supposes, that the person may be wholly void of the grace of mercy it∣self<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. A MERCIFUL disposition, where it is, will give evidence of itself by <HI>outward correspendent actions.</HI> A pre∣tence to a merciful disposition, where there is no out∣ward fruits of it, when proper opportunities offer them∣selves, is the vilest mockery; and is finely exposed by the Apostles <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James ii. 15, 16. 1 John iii. 17, 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. THERE may be a very merciful disposition in the heart, where the person who has it, has it not in his power to give very convincing proofs of it, by his ac∣tions. However, where it is, it will prompt a person to <HI>do all that he can</HI> to give proof of it. He will, at least, <HI>pity</HI> and <HI>sympathize</HI> with his suffering fellow-creature, and what he can do more, he will do it to relieve him. Now, if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted of GOD, according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. MERCY, as a Christian grace, has its first and <HI>chief</HI> respect to <HI>men's souls;</HI> the troubles and miseries which they suffer, and the dangers to which they are exposed by sin: And indeed, this concern for the mi∣sery of men's souls, is the chief character which dis∣tinguishes <HI>Christian mercy,</HI> from <HI>mere humanity.</HI> How many good natured men in the world, whose hearts bleed to see a fellow-creature in bodily pain or misery, and who would go almost any lengths to relieve him; yet have no mercy on their own souls, or the souls of their
<PB N="202" REF="014137_0201_0F97D49C366EFF60"/>fellow-sinners, but would see them go to hell, and help them thither, without the least attempt to prevent it: But Christian mercy <HI>bleeds,</HI> and is <HI>moved</HI> chiefly by the <HI>misery</HI> and <HI>danger</HI> of <HI>human souls;</HI> does all that it can to instruct the ignorant, and to reclaim the wicked and erroneous;—and what it cannot do itself, it rejoices to see done by others, and gives every encouragement in its power, to designs and endeavours to reform men's manners and save their souls, that they may be plucked as brands out of the burning.—Noble proofs and examples of this merciful disposition, we have in <HI>Lot, David,</HI> the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and especially in <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. MERCY is not confined to the <HI>soul,</HI> but reaches to the <HI>whole man.</HI> Here it strikes in with <HI>humanity,</HI> and improves it; weeping with them that weep, and look∣ing not only at its <HI>own things,</HI> but also on the <HI>things of others.</HI> It pities and sympathizes with the pains and diseases of others bodies; the troubles and perplexities of their minds; their wants and necessities; their dis∣asters and disappointments; their oppressions and afflic∣tions. And when in its power, it labours to mitigate all these afflictions, by drawing out its soul to the hungry; by clothing the naked; by helping the sick; by pleading the cause of the oppressed; by administring counsel to the perplexed, and comfort to the sorrowing and afflicted. And whereas, <HI>mere humanity</HI> only does these things from <HI>instinct,</HI> and to ease the anxiety of the mind on the sight of distress;—the merciful Christian does them from love to his neighbour, from a conside∣ration of duty, and from obedience to the authority of GOD.</P>
<P N="8">8. BUT a merciful disposition is seen in its greatest lustre and advantage, when it pities and forgives per∣sons who, by injurious treatment to ourselves, are wholly at our mercy, and upon whom we have it fully
<PB N="203" REF="014137_0202_0F97D49CF4031040"/>in our power to glut our revenge; yea, when we may do so under the colour of justice. This is <HI>God-like</HI> mercy indeed! But.</P>
<P N="9">9. IT belongs to Christian <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>prudence</HI> to judge, <HI>to whom,</HI> and <HI>how far,</HI> such acts of mercy should extend. That lenity which would prompt us to give up our rights upon all occasions to lawless men, might often be of mischievous consequence:—It might often tend to harden sinners in their vices, and embolden them to treat others as they have done us, with hopes of impunity. By forgiving a man who attempts my life, I may procure the murder of other innocent per∣sons. By pardoning and giving liberty to a robber, whom I have caught breaking open my house, and pillaging my goods, I embolden this villain to rob my neighbour's. Nor is it in all cases proper or prudent for a man to forgive personal injuries, without legal sa∣tisfaction and examplary punishment. Acts of lenity and mercy to offenders, should always consist with a proper concern for the public good, and our own per∣sonal safety.</P>
<P N="10">10. CHRISTIAN mercy, however, is always sorry for the authors of injuries, and heartily wishes their <HI>repen∣tance</HI> and <HI>eternal welfare.</HI> It will never admit of cruelty or revenge against an offender. If his crime will ad∣mit of it, it is willing to forgive him, upon proper marks of repentance. If punishment is necessary, it would have it to be of the mildest and gentlest nature, that the offence will admit of; and it pities the person of the guilty sufferer, and would rejoice if the punish∣ment might be wholly remitted;—having nothing at heart but the interest of human society, virtue and jus∣tice; and, like GOD, taking no pleasure in the misery of sinners.</P>
<P N="11">11. THERE is also ample room for the display of mercy, in the exaction of debts. If the debtor is
<PB N="204" REF="014137_0203_0F97D49DB52944A8"/>fallen into poverty by accidents or misfortunes, it will bear with him, if able; or if able, and circumstances allow, will remit <HI>part</HI> or <HI>whole</HI> of the debt: Or, if he is even bankrupt by his own fault, and therefore, justly deserves to suffer as a criminal, yet it will consider the necessitous circumstances of his innocent family and connexions, and will remit what it can on their be∣half.</P>
<P N="12">12. THOUGH mercy should extend to <HI>all</HI> in <HI>these in∣stances;</HI> yet it will be shown in the <HI>first place,</HI> and in the <HI>highest degree,</HI> to those whom GOD and nature hath con∣nected most intimately with us; such as our families, relations and friends: For, it would be a preposterous disposition, and not Christian mercy, to pity and help strangers, while our own household, kindred and friends were disregarded by us, in their misery.—Above all,</P>
<P N="13">13. OUR <HI>Christian brethren</HI> claim a <HI>peculiar part</HI> in our bowels of mercies. If one member suffers, all the members should suffer with it. <Q>We are to bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</Q></P>
<P N="14">14. OUR <HI>heathen slaves</HI> are proper objects and excel∣lent tests of a merciful disposition. Their <HI>case</HI> and <HI>state</HI> is allowed to be very <HI>pitiable</HI> and <HI>miserable</HI> upon al∣most all accounts. They often provoke us, and needs must. They are, in a manner, entirely at our mercy, and their very lives in our hands. They are <HI>our fellow creatures,</HI> and <HI>might</HI> and <HI>should</HI> be our <HI>Christian brethren.</HI> They are GOD'S <HI>creatures,</HI> and <HI>our neighbours,</HI> whom we should <HI>love as ourselves.</HI> And surely, if a merciful man, will be merciful even to his beast, much more ought he to be so to his <HI>human slave!</HI>—It may therefore be de∣pended on, that those who have no pity for their slaves, but are of an <HI>unfeeling, cruel, merciless</HI> temper towards them, are strangers to this grace.</P>
<P N="15">15. THIS is one of the most amiable and GOD-like of all the Christian virtues, being that temper by which we
<PB N="205" REF="014137_0204_0F97D49E766D0F48"/>do, in a most eminent manner, resemble and bear the image of the blessed GOD, and his Son <HI>Jesus</HI> CHRIST; who forgive us <HI>ten thousand talents,</HI> and are merciful to the <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>unthankful.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. IT is declared, that they <Q>Shall have judg∣ment without mercy, who shew no mercy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James ii. 13.</NOTE>;</Q> and, <Q>That if we forgive not men their trespasses, neither will GOD forgive us ours.

<P N="17">17. IT needs not be added, that a merciful disposi∣tion, is one of the most <HI>amiable</HI> and <HI>endearing</HI> accom∣plishments in a man, and stands the fairest chance of rendering him universally beloved by his fellow-crea∣tures.</P>

In short, <Q>It is to render unto every one his due.</Q> And, in this <HI>general view,</HI> it may be called, <HI>integrity, uprightness</HI> or <HI>righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IF we act <HI>justly</HI> towards GOD, we shall love, re∣verence, and esteem him supremely, and above all things; we shall believe, obey and trust him without reserve, and we shall worship and praise him, according to his glorious perfections.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we are <HI>just</HI> to the <HI>holy angels,</HI> we shall love them as our fellow-creatures; as the subjects and servants of our Redeemer; as pure, holy, and benevolent beings; and, more particularly, as ministring spirits sent forth to minister to them who are heirs of salvation, and as deep∣ly and affectionately interesting themselves in <HI>our good,</HI> and in <HI>our Redeemer's glory.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IF we are <HI>just</HI> to our <HI>fellow men,</HI> we shall love them as ourselves; we shall sympathize with, and help them in their wants and afflictions; we shall conscientiously abstain from <HI>injuring</HI> them in their persons, families, re∣putation, or interests; we shall deal fairly, truly, can∣didly and equitably with them in all dealings and trans∣actions of life; we shall perform to each of them the honours, duties, or services, which of right belong to them, according to the various relations in which they
<PB N="207" REF="014137_0206_0F97D49FF41C06E0"/>stand to us, and we shall do what we <HI>can</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to promote both their temporal and eternal welfare.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF we are <HI>just</HI> to <HI>ourselves,</HI> we shall prefer our souls to our bodies; eternity to time; and the favour of GOD and eternal happiness, to all the alluring, deceitful offers of sin. We shall be humble, patient, meek, mo∣dest, just, charitable, self-denied, and every thing else which we ought to be.</P>
<P N="6">6. BUT as justice between man and man, is that branch of equity or righteousness, which we are here to consider, it may be most beneficial to take a view of that excellent <HI>rule</HI> and <HI>measure</HI> of it laid down by our Sa∣viour, Matth. vii. 12. <Q>Therefore, all things, whatso∣ever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. THE measure of our acting towards others, here proposed, is not what they <HI>actually do</HI> to us, but what <HI>we would they should do to us.</HI> Yet this is the measure by which most men act towards their neighbours: They render evil for evil; railing for railing, &amp;c. Nor will they do good to those who will not do good to them. Nay, many think themselves justified in cheating others, because they first cheated them. But this is <HI>retaliation</HI> and <HI>private revenge,</HI> not <HI>equity.</HI> The gospel has taught us a quite different rule of acting, and denies to Chri∣stians the right of private revenge, farther than <HI>self-de∣fence</HI> requires<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 31,—35. Rom. xii. 19,—21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT is not <HI>in all cases,</HI> lawful to do unto others, what <HI>we would</HI> they should do unto us, were we in their circumstances, and they in ours, without presup∣posing the <HI>lawfulness</HI> or <HI>fitness</HI> of the action. A criminal might be glad that his judge would acquit him; but could not <HI>reasonably</HI> expect it. A drunkard would be glad that his neighbour would intoxicate him, yet he ought not for that reason to make his neighbour drunk,
<PB N="208" REF="014137_0207_0F97D4A0B41C6888"/>because it would be unlawful. A poor man might be glad if his rich neighbour would give his whole estate to him; yet how could he reasonably expect it?</P>
<P N="9">9. THE <HI>spirit</HI> of the precept is plainly this: <Q>In all our transactions with our neighbour, we ought, lay∣ing aside prejudice and partiality, to suppose ourselves in our neighbour's place and circumstances, and he in ours; and then we should attentively consider what we might <HI>reasonably</HI> and <HI>lawfully</HI> expect from him, if he were in our place, and we in his; and accord∣ingly, we should be the same to him in our thoughts, words and actions, as we would <HI>have him to be unto us,</HI> if the tables were turned.</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. WHERE <HI>self<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess</HI> and <HI>prejudice</HI> keep the posses∣sion of the mind, men will never act right upon this rule; for, where these are, we shall ever expect <HI>more</HI> from others, than we would do unto them, if our cir∣cumstances were changed. How common is it to see persons make very <HI>free</HI> and <HI>merry</HI> with the failings of their neighbours and their families, and think they have a right to do so without giving offence? Yet when it falls to their turn to be <HI>so treated,</HI> they resent <HI>highly,</HI> and perhaps <HI>justly,</HI> the same treatment from their neigh∣bour. How many, who in their necessity, have no bounds in their expectations from their neighbours, and never think they do enough for them; yet have no bowels of compassion for the poor, when the tables are turned, and they become rich. All this proceeds from selfishness and prejudice; a want of considering what is right and sit to be done.</P>
<P N="11">11. AS to the <HI>excellency</HI> of this rule, and <HI>our obliga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ons</HI> to conform to it, they are both self-evident. It is founded on the <HI>sameness of nature</HI> in men, and their <HI>natu∣ral equality.</HI> The relative and accidental differences be∣tween men, are small in their own nature, and very
<PB N="209" REF="014137_0208_0F97D4A173F10328"/>transient and changeable. He that is now a king, may be soon a subject: The master may soon be a servant: The rich may soon be poor; and the honourable may fall into dishonour and contempt. I may need that jus∣tice or kindness from my neighbour to-morrow, which he demands from me to-day. It is plain then, that there should be <HI>one common rule</HI> or <HI>measure</HI> of justice and equity for all men. If it is unjust to keep two kinds of weights and measures, one to <HI>buy</HI> with, and the other to <HI>sell</HI> by; it is surely equally unjust that I should have <HI>one</HI> law for <HI>myself,</HI> and <HI>another</HI> for <HI>my neighbour.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. THIS is a rule of justice which has obtained among all nations, it being a clear dictate of reason, and of the law of nature,—<Q>Not to do to others what we would not bear from them; and to do to others, in all cases, what we would reasonably expect from them.</Q></P>
<P N="13">13. AS this is a rule, the equity of which is so clear and self-evident, that none can dispute or deny it; so it is easily carried about with a man in his memo∣ry; and an honest man of the weakest judgment can easily and quickly apply it, on the most sudden emer∣gencies. Most arts and sciences are so tedious and in∣tricate, that they are hard to learn, and difficult to re∣tain. The artist and mechanic can do little without his books and instruments.—But this art of doing jus∣ly depends only upon <HI>one short single rule,</HI> easily retained, and not easily forgotten. In short, to act justly in all cases for ordinary, needs only a <HI>single honest appeal to the heart and conscience,</HI> by the light of this rule; <Q>All things whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P N="14">14. THIS is <HI>the law of the prophets:</HI> It is a short and comprehensive summary of all the directions recorded in scripture, how one man should behave towards an∣other:
<PB N="210" REF="014137_0209_0F97D4A23419FF58"/>For, as that precept, <Q>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,</Q> is the fulfilling of the whole law, in the duty of <HI>Christian charity;</HI> so this is the ful∣filling of the whole law in the matters of <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>equity.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. THE use of this precept extends to the whole of our intercourse with our fellow-creatures, and to all our <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>words</HI> about them. It would prevent all rash, uncharitable and censorious opinions and judg∣ments of our fellow-creatures, and all injurious actions towards them.—It would lead us to usefulness and inof∣fensiveness in conversation; to integrity and rectitude in all our dealings and commerce, and to a right me∣thod of treating those who need our compassion or kindness. It would regulate our temper and conduct under provocations, and teach us a just and charitable way of speaking and acting towards those who differ from us in their <HI>religious</HI> or <HI>other sentiments.</HI>—And, it would teach us a just and equitable conduct to superi∣ors, inferiors, and equals.</P>
<P N="16">16. THE <HI>excellency</HI> and <HI>usefulness</HI> of this rule, shew us the great importance of <HI>self-acquaintance</HI> and <HI>reflection,</HI> on which it is founded, and by the <HI>medium</HI> of which it must be practised on.</P>
<P N="17">17. THE equity of this great law and measure of justice, proves to a demonstration, the <HI>holiness, justice,</HI> and <HI>goodness</HI> of GOD'S laws; how far they are from deserv∣ing the character of being <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>grievous</HI> impositions, tending to deprive us of our natural liberty. He who acts and lives justly, acts and lives according to the <HI>law of his nature,</HI> which is the law of <HI>eternal reason:</HI>—<Q>And what doth the Lord thy GOD require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy GOD.</Q></P>
<P N="18">18. WE should pray without ceasing, that GOD may write this law on our souls, and keep it ever in the
<PB N="211" REF="014137_0210_0F97D4A42D774070"/>thoughts of the imaginations of our hearts, so that we may never swerve from this universal rule of righteous∣ness.</P>

<DIV1 N="43" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>ESSAY XLIII. CHRISTIAN HOPE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Christian hope</HI> is a firm expectation of that future and eternal happiness, which GOD hath promised to his faithful obedient people, upon a rational and well-grounded persuasion, that they have complied with the terms of his gracious covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE object of Christian hope is the <HI>divine promises,</HI> contained in GOD'S word; for, it is upon his word that he causeth his servants to hope: And it ever pre∣supposes, a firm faith in these promises.—Christian hope, therefore, is ever built upon <HI>faith,</HI> and can reach no farther than its foundation: For, we cannot rationally <HI>hope for,</HI> or <HI>expect</HI> that which we do not believe that we shall receive.</P>
<P N="3">3. I HAVE said, the object of Christian hope is the divine promises; though it may be rather said to be the blessings contained in the divine promises, the chief and most comprehensive of which is, GOD himself, as the <HI>chief good of our natures,</HI> the comprehensive sum total of all our happiness; and therefore it is said, by way of eminence, "That our hope may be in GOD," as the ultimate object of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 31.</NOTE>. For, if we pursue every pro∣mised
<PB N="212" REF="014137_0211_0F97D4A489011978"/>blessing or happiness to the source of it, we will find it centered in GOD, and flowing from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST is also sometimes called <HI>our hope,</HI> as the channel of all divine blessings to us, and the great <HI>pro∣mulgator</HI> and <HI>revealer</HI> of the divine promises. And we are said to abound in hope, through the power of the <HI>holy Ghost;</HI> because, as he is the worker of <HI>faith,</HI> so of <HI>hope,</HI> in the hearts of Christians; bearing witness with their spirits, that they are children and heirs of GOD; confirming their rational inferences as to the goodness and safety of their state; persuading them of the power and faithfulness of GOD, and the certain accomplish∣ment of his promises, and sweetly assuring their hearts, so as to raise them above tormenting fear, anxious doubtings, and distracting despair.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE primary foundations of Christian hope, as well as of Christian faith, are the <HI>unchangeable truth</HI> and <HI>almighty power</HI> of GOD.—He <HI>cannot lie,</HI> and he can do all things which are the objects of power; consequent∣ly, he can neither <HI>deceive our faith</HI> nor <HI>disappoint our hopes.</HI> Whatsoever therefore GOD hath <HI>said</HI> or <HI>promised,</HI> we can never confidently enough expect and hope for, nor firmly enough believe.</P>
<P N="6">6. MEN may be strong in the Christian hope, giving glory to GOD; that is, they may firmly believe the truth of his word, and the sure accomplishment of his promises to his people, while they may be very doubtful of their own state, and so be deprived of the <HI>joy of hope:</HI> For, as hope supposes faith, and faith rests upon a divine promise; while we cannot clearly and rationally apply this promise to ourselves, we cannot yet hope for the accomplishment of it to ourselves.— Yet we may clearly see our title to the promised bles∣sing on condition we did but truly believe and apply the promise. Hence it clearly follows, that our hope
<PB N="213" REF="014137_0212_0F97D4A53672E760"/>must ever keep pace with the evidence of our title to the promised blessing. Where we have no rational evidence of this, we can have no rational hope; and according to the <HI>strength of our evidence,</HI> such will be the <HI>strength of our hope.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. HENCE it is also clear, that all the hopes of wick∣ed men, and even of men (however sober, moral, and orderly in their lives) who are yet without any rational evidence of their being truly religious, are mere <HI>wicked, groundless presumptions,</HI> which only serve to keep up their fatal security, and to render their damnation the more certain and the more dreadful: For, how dreadful must it be for those men to find all their <HI>towering airy</HI> hopes, piercing them like broken reeds, and breading under them like a spider's web, only to render their fall into endless misery and despair the deeper and more distressing?</P>
<P N="8">8. HENCE it appears, that <HI>despair,</HI> is a more pro∣mising symptom in wicked men, than the most <HI>con∣fident hopes.</HI> And that the foundation of a true Christian hope in all such, must be laid deep in an utter despair of ever seeing the face of GOD in mercy, while they continue void of true religion, and under the pow∣er of wicked habits.</P>
<P N="9">9. CHRISTIAN hope is distinguished from worldly hopes, by the <HI>excellency of its objects,</HI> and the <HI>stability of its foundation.</HI> Its principal object, as we observed, is GOD, and an eternal state of glory and happiness; in his pre∣sence, wherein we shall be conformed to the image of his Son; and its foundation is the <HI>divine power</HI> and <HI>faith∣fulness;</HI> so that it is a <HI>sure, glorious</HI> and <HI>blessed</HI> hope. But <HI>all, all</HI> sublunary hopes are mean in their nature, uncer∣tain in their attainment, and deceitful and unsatisfying in their fruition and enjoyment.</P>
<P N="10">10. TO hope for the perfection of our nature, and the full enjoyment of GOD, is a <HI>glorious hope,</HI> which by
<PB N="214" REF="014137_0213_0F97D4A5F4265B68"/>its very nature, tends to raise, purify and refine our souls, and which when enjoyed, will leave us not a single wish or desire ungratified: But earthly hopes; the hopes of honours, wealth, power, or sensual pleasures, are of a low, mean nature, and naturally tend to depress and sen∣sualize the mind: And, even when they come to be at∣tained, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do they disappoint us? How little do they please<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us? How often have we cause to be ashamed of them? And how often does the very frui∣tion of them turn out to be our greatest evils and vexa∣tions? that it is peculiar to the nature of the Christian hope, that it <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not ashamed,</HI> because the fruition exceeds our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> expectations.</P>
<P N="11">11. HOW <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain are we of the attainment of our earthly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and desires? How many have eagerly and dilige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y pursued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne one trifling earthly hope (that, suppose, of being rich, or being honoured or respected) all their days, and yet could never attain it, but have been per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ally crossed and disappoint∣ed in all their expectations? This is the reason why <HI>young men</HI> are generally more sanguine in their hopes and expectations from the world, than <HI>old men,</HI> who, by a woful experience, have so often found all their hopes from it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>strated, and that all its most gay and promising appearances, are extremely flattering and deceitful. But it is the distinguishing characteristick of the Christian hope, that it is a sure and certain hope; and those who enjoy it know it to be so. Al∣though the objects of the Christian's hopes, are fu∣ture and unseen, yet his hope gives them a presence and reality, and therefore the patient waiting for this hope, is attended with joy and comfort. The interval of a thousand years did not weaken <HI>Abraham's</HI> hope of the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> but he <HI>rejoiced to see his day,</HI> be∣cause he knew that GOD <HI>was faithful who promised.</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="014137_0214_0F97D4A6B46D43C0"/>Such also is the Christian's hope of future glory; though he has not yet seen it, yet believing, he re∣joices in assured expectation of it, with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</P>
<P N="12">12. HOPE is exceeding suitable to our <HI>present state.</HI>— In heaven it is excluded by full enjoyment, and in hell, by utter despair: But, as we are here in a <HI>middle state,</HI> between the two worlds;—as we are now in a state of trial and expectance, it is perfectly fit that we should be governed and influenced by the hope of a future re∣ward, which tends, on the one hand, to quicken our diligence in our proper work, and on the other, to pre∣serve us from slothful despondency.</P>
<P N="13">13. HOPE is highly necessary to the Christian in the present state. Surrounded with temptations both terrifying and alluring, to draw us away from our duty, the hope of salvation is our <HI>helmet</HI> and <HI>breastplate;</HI> tos∣sed with the storms of doubts, perplexities, worldly cares and persecutions, hope is the <HI>anchor of the soul,</HI> sure and steadfast, that enters within the vail, and, be∣ing fixed on the immortal shore, gives the soul security and rest; harrassed with sore afflictions, and passing through the dark valley of the shadow of death, what could support us but the Christian hope? This was the boast of the afflicted Apostles: They gloried even in tribulations, rejoicing in the hope of the glory of GOD; they reckoned their greatest sufferings not wor∣thy to be compared with the glory to be revealed; looking at things invisible and eternal, they knew their <HI>light</HI> and <HI>momentary</HI> afflictions wrought out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. This was the support of the <HI>martyrs</HI> under all their sufferings in the cause of Christ: <Q>Blessed are ye when all men persecute you: Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your rew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>.</Q> in short, hope
<PB N="216" REF="014137_0215_0F97D4A773EE3080"/>sets all the springs of Christian activity to work; sweet∣ens the most difficult and self-denying duties of religion, and is that which only can make men eminent, useful and diligent Christians.</P>
<P N="14">14. TRUE Christian hope, may be distinguished from <HI>carnal confidence</HI> and <HI>presumption,</HI> chiefly by its <HI>quickening</HI> and <HI>purifying</HI> effects. <Q>He who hath this hope in him, purifyeth himself as GOD is pure.</Q> If we be∣lieve the many great and precious promises of the gospel, and are caused to hope for their accomplish∣ment, <Q>We shall cleanse ourselves from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit, and perfect holiness in the fear of GOD.</Q> When a man's hopes do not purify his soul, nor make him diligent in his Christian duty, but leave him wicked, careless and slothful, it may be depended on, that they are mere groundless pre∣sumptions; those hopes of the hypocrite which pe∣rish. The Christian hope is a <HI>lively hope;</HI> the inward spring of fervent desires, reviving joys and zealous en∣deavours. The man who has got a believing view of the high prize of glory, presses on towards it, with un∣remitting diligence, and purifies <HI>himself,</HI> because he knows none but the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> will receive it, or can enjoy it.</P>
<P N="15">15. THE Christian hope tends to <HI>purify, cleanse</HI> and <HI>sanctify</HI> all who have it, in various ways; as, (1.) By the objects of it, which are the <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> GOD, and a state of <HI>pure</HI> and holy <HI>blessedness.</HI> Indeed, none but such as are in some measure purified from their lusts and sins, can entertain or please themselves with such a hope at all: Whence it follows, that no wicked persons ever <HI>had,</HI> or <HI>can</HI> have a <HI>true Christian hope.</HI>—(2.) Those who have this hope are purified by the frequent and serious thoughts of GOD, and heavenly glory. As the object of their hope is spiritual and divine; so the
<PB N="217" REF="014137_0216_0F97D4A833D31AE8"/>frequent contemplation of it purifies and raises their af∣fections from the earth, and transforms them into the same likeness: As the Christian's hope, treasure and heart are in heaven, so it is likely his conversation will be there also.</P>
<P N="16">16. EVERY man will have his hope; but it behoves us to see to it that <HI>our's</HI> is rationally founded, and a true Christian hope, that will attend us to death, and to the gates of heaven.—If it purifies our hearts and quickens our holy diligence, it will never deceive us; but if not it is counterfeit; and, <Q>what will become of the hope of the hypocrite, when GOD taketh away his soul?</Q></P>
<P N="17">17. HOW great will their fall be, who fall from a conceited and imaginary heaven into a real hell? Hope, of all the passions, is the most calm and quiet; but when disappointed, the rage, impatience, sorrow and despair of hell must follow. Let us therefore examine our hopes, least this should be <HI>our</HI> sad case.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLIV. <HI>The</HI> NATURES <HI>and</HI> PERSON <HI>of</HI> CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS Christ is the <HI>end of the law,</HI> the <HI>sum</HI> and <HI>sub∣stance of the gospel;</HI> the <HI>pearl of great price;</HI> the <HI>author, finisher</HI> and <HI>object of our faith, trust., hope</HI> and <HI>de∣pendance;</HI> our Redeemer, and through GOD, our <HI>portion</HI> and <HI>salvation,</HI> it well becomes us, as Christians, to grow in the knowledge of, and acquaint ourselves well with this glorious person: For, the better we know him in his <HI>natures, person</HI> and saving offices, the more clear and comfortable will be the grounds of our faith and trust in him; the better shall we love him, and the more chearfully shall we follow and obey him.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE is, indeed, a most <HI>wonderful</HI> and <HI>mysterious</HI> person; but the holy scriptures have revealed to us a number of his glories, and given us many rich materi∣als for the growing knowledge of him, and acquaintance with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE is represented in one view, as the <HI>wonderful councellor,</HI> the <HI>mighty</HI> GOD, the <HI>everlasting Father,</HI> the <HI>Prince of peace;</HI> the Word which was in the beginning with GOD, and which was GOD; the Creator of all things, visible and invisible, by whom all things <HI>are</HI> and <HI>consist:</HI>—And, in another view, he is represented, as the <HI>Son of man;</HI> the <HI>man Jesus; born of a virgin;</HI> appearing in the <HI>form of a servant,</HI> and in the <HI>likeness of sinful flesh; smitten, wounded</HI> and <HI>bruised,</HI> a <HI>man of sorrows</HI> and ac∣quainted with <HI>grief; hungering, thirsting, weary, sorrowing, bleeding</HI> and <HI>dying; made of a woman;</HI> made <HI>under the law,</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="014137_0218_0F97D4A9B3EEA998"/>and the like;—which plainly proves, that in this mys∣terious person, there are <HI>two</HI> widely different and dis∣tinct <HI>natures;</HI> not only a <HI>soul</HI> and a <HI>body</HI> as in other hu∣man creatures, but a truly <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human nature;</HI> by the one of which he is <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>really</HI> GOD, and by the other <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>really man.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. SOME hereticks supposed, that the divine nature of Christ served as a <HI>soul</HI> to his <HI>human body,</HI> and there∣fore, that he had no human soul, distinct from his <HI>God∣head,</HI> or divine nature: but this is an error against scrip∣ture, which assures us, that Christ had a <HI>true human soul,</HI> distinct from his divine nature, and that this soul was sorrowful even to death. Now it would be impious to suppose, that the GOD-HEAD or <HI>divine nature</HI> of Christ, <HI>suffered,</HI> or felt any uneasy passion. Besides, unless Christ had had a proper human soul besides his divine nature, as we have, he could not be <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>properly man,</HI> as we are; and therefore not a proper <HI>Kinsman-Re∣deemer.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. CHRISTIANS are divided about the time of the creation of Christ's human soul: The generality hold∣ing that is was created and joined to his body in the vir∣gin's womb.

<PB N="220" REF="014137_0219_0F97D4AA74BCB798"/>in uniting his glorious divine nature to our <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>frail humanity;</HI> and his wonderful love, in exalting <HI>our nature</HI> to a personal union with the <HI>Deity:</HI>—Yet these two natures do, and must continue <HI>distinct, unbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded</HI> and <HI>unmixed.</HI> By virtue of this wonderful union, the man Jesus is spoken of as GOD, and the <HI>divine word,</HI> which is GOD, is spoken of as <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THAT our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>was,</HI> and <HI>is</HI> possessed of a truly divine nature, or that he is <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>really</HI> GOD in one of his natures, appears against <HI>Socinians</HI> and <HI>Ar∣rians,</HI> from the works that he did; the divine names and attributes ascribed to him, and the divine perfections which were displayed in his miracles. As we heard above, he is expressly called GOD; the <Q>the bright∣ness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person:</Q> He is said to have been <HI>in the beginning,</HI> that is <HI>eternal;</HI> to have been <HI>before Abraham was;</HI> to have <HI>created</HI> and <HI>made all things.</HI> He is stiled the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the beginning and the end; the searcher of the hearts and trier of the reins of the children of men. He is <HI>omnipotent,</HI> for he <HI>raised the dead; turned water into wine; created bread and fish</HI> in the eater's hands, and <HI>made all things,</HI> visible and invisible. He is <HI>omniscient,</HI> for he <HI>knew the very thoughts</HI> of men. He is <HI>omniscient,</HI> for although in heaven, he promises to be <HI>where ever two or three of his disciples are;</HI> and to be every where with his servants to the end of the world. He is therefore the <HI>proper object of divine worship,</HI> and accordingly <HI>all the an∣gels of</HI> GOD, are commanded to <HI>worship him. Stephen</HI> worshipped him; <HI>St. Paul</HI> swore by him, and all sinners are commanded to believe in him, to rely and trust on him, and to honour him, even as they honour the Fa∣ther; therefore he is, in one of his natures, <HI>properly</HI> GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. Isa. ix. 6. Col. ii. 9. Rev. i. 8.—ii. 23.—iv. 11.—v. 11, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="221" REF="014137_0220_0F97D4AB33DAD760"/>
8. THAT our Lord Jesus Christ was also truly man, is evident, not only from his <HI>conception</HI> and <HI>birth,</HI> and from his being called <HI>the seed of the woman,</HI> the <HI>son of Da∣vid,</HI> the <HI>man Jesus,</HI> and a <HI>man of sorrows</HI> and acquainted with griefs; but also from every proper character of humanity appearing in him. He <HI>increased in knowledge,</HI> and <HI>in stature,</HI> as other men; he <HI>cat, drank</HI> and <HI>slept;</HI> was <HI>hungry</HI> and <HI>weary;</HI> felt all the innocent passions of hu∣manity in all their strength and delicacy; spoke famili∣arly of his soul and body, his flesh and blood; suffered, and at length bled and died;—thus giving full proof, that in one of his natures, he was, in all respects, like unto his human brethren (sin only excepted) and there∣fore well qualified to be a <HI>mere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ul high-priest,</HI> and <HI>compassi∣onate elder brother,</HI> and <HI>kinsman-redeemer;</HI> the <HI>seed of the woman,</HI> and the <HI>Son of David,</HI> after the flesh.</P>
<P N="9">9. AS the human nature of Christ was to be the <HI>pro∣pitiatory sacrifice</HI> for the sins of the world; therefore, it behoved to be perfectly pure and immaculate, without any taint of <HI>inherent</HI> or <HI>derived</HI> corruption (otherwise it could not have been a sacrifice acceptable to GOD, nor available for us;) therefore, it pleased GOD to secure the sinless purity of this nature, by its being conceived and formed by the holy Ghost, in the sanctified womb of a pure virgin. Whence he was called the <HI>holy child Jesus;</HI> the <HI>lamb of</HI> GOD, <Q>without spot or blemish; holy harmless, undefiled, and separate from sin∣ners.</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. THERE is no reason to doubt but that the <HI>human soul</HI> of Christ was the <HI>noblest spirit</HI> which GOD ever cre∣ated, and his body the most perfect human body that ever was formed; seeing, that in this <HI>consecrated temple</HI> the DEITY himself was to reside, and <Q>all the fulness of the GOD-HEAD, to dwell bodily.</Q> So that there is no doubt but this glorious dignified man, considered
<PB N="222" REF="014137_0221_0F97D4ABF3F5A6A8"/>only as a man, <HI>was,</HI> and <HI>is</HI> the <HI>most glorious creature of</HI> GOD; and is filled with all the graces and perfections, whereof a limited, created nature is capable; seeing that it was <HI>by</HI> and <HI>through this nature,</HI> that GOD was to display and manifest himself to men.</P>
<P N="11">11. AS the divine nature of Christ was not capable of <HI>suffering,</HI> so neither was it capable of <HI>humiliation, ex∣altation</HI> or <HI>reward.</HI> CHRIST'S divine nature could not properly be said to humble itself; to empty itself of its glory, or to be rewarded for its services, or exalted to a higher degree of glory, or blessedness, or dominion, than it enjoyed before; therefore, wherever we find these changes of state ascribed to Christ in scripture, we must understand it of his human nature, which indeed humbled itself in the work of our redemption, and has obtained a glorious exaltation and an increase of dignity and blessedness, as the reward of its humiliation, labours and sufferings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. ii. 5,—11. Psal. ex. 7, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">12. ALTHOUGH there was a perfect union of the <HI>Word</HI> or <HI>divine nature</HI> of Christ with his human nature, while upon earth; yet the manner and degree in which the divine nature communicated the perfections of power and knowledge to the human nature, is, to us, a great mystery. It appears, that Christ, as a man, grew up from his childhood, and increased in know∣ledge as other men do: Yet, no sooner does he enter upon his public ministry, having been thereunto set apart by the baptism of <HI>John,</HI> and the anointing of the holy Ghost, but we find him possessed of <HI>amazing,</HI> even <HI>infinite knowledge</HI> and <HI>almighty power.</HI> From which it would seem to appear, that during his private life, the divine nature of Christ communicated little else to his human nature, than sanctifying knowledge and holy in∣fluences, and that his communications became more
<PB N="223" REF="014137_0222_0F97D4ACB40F7038"/>unlimited and extensive, as the great work of his mini∣stry required.</P>
<P N="13">13. SUCH is the <HI>glorious object</HI> of our <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope.</HI> From which it appears, how worthy he is of, and how justly entitled to our <HI>trust, homage, love</HI> and <HI>adoration;</HI> For, whatever is amiable, excellent, or a perfection in GOD and <HI>man,</HI> he possesses in the most eminent degree. The offices which he sustains and executes, as our Me∣diator, are to be considered below.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLV. CHRIST, <HI>our</HI> PROPHET.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ALTHOUGH Christ is, in one of his na∣tures, GOD <HI>equal with the Father,</HI> yet in his complex person, as GOD-<HI>man-Mediator,</HI> he is the <HI>Father's righteous servant,</HI> whom GOD hath provided, appointed, sanctified and sent into the world, on the great and gra∣cious errand of redeeming lost sinners; fulfilling and honouring his law, and promoting his glory; to whom he hath (for a time at least) entrusted the whole ma∣nagement of his mediatorial kingdom; committed all power and judgment, and made him the head and go∣vernor of all things, of all the scenes of providence, all the kingdoms of the world, and all the angels of heaven and devils of hell, of which he is the glorious king and head.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN this his <HI>mysterious, complex person,</HI> as GOD-<HI>man-Mediator,</HI> he more especially sustains and executes three offices for the good of the church, and for the salva∣tion
<PB N="224" REF="014137_0223_0F97D4AD746200F0"/>of sinners:—As sinners are naturally <HI>ignorant</HI> and blind in the knowledge of GOD, and in the way of serv∣ing him acceptably, in compassion and relief of this misery of our fallen race, he is become our <HI>prophet</HI> to instruct us:—As they are <HI>guilty</HI> and subject to con∣demnation and wrath, and have no access to GOD or power with him; in this our guilty and rebellious state, he is become our <HI>Priest</HI> to atone for our sins by the sacrifice of himself, and to plead, pray and inter∣cede for us with his justly offended Father, and to procure us access to him with humble boldness and fa∣vourable acceptance with him:—As we are by nature bond slaves of <HI>satan</HI> and of lust, having numberless ene∣mies which seek our perdition, and neither power nor skill to oppose them, he is graciously become our <HI>King,</HI> not only to give laws to our consciences, but to capti∣vate our hearts to himself; to rule and reign within us by the power of his Spirit, and having thus rescued us from the power of inward enemies, to lead us on to the conquest of the world and the <HI>devil,</HI> with all their stra∣tagems and temptations.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>prophetic office</HI> consists chiefly of two parts: 1. To reveal, preach and inculcate those truths and doctrines of GOD, which are necessary to the salvation of sinners: And, 2. To foretel, with certainty, future events, relative to the church of GOD, or the members of it, or others, which seemed to depend, for their ex∣istence, on uncertain contingencies and events. This was the twofold business of both the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> prophets; and in the Jewish church, there were certain established marks of trial, whereby the <HI>true</HI> prophets, were distinguished from the <HI>false.</HI> Now, in both these respects, Christ is the <HI>prime</HI> and <HI>chief</HI> prophet of the church; nay, he may be said, by way of eminence, to be the <HI>only true</HI> Prophet of GOD; because all other true
<PB N="225" REF="014137_0224_0F97D4AF5C634DB0"/>prophets were only his <HI>organs</HI> or <HI>instruments,</HI> (if I may so speak) deriving all their <HI>revelations, predictions, gifts</HI> and <HI>graces,</HI> from the light of his Spirit, communicated to them, illuminating, <HI>inspiring</HI> them, and speaking and writing <HI>by</HI> and <HI>in</HI> them.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHATEVER revelations, or divine inspirations, <HI>Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Job, David,</HI> or the pro∣phets and the patriarchs of old, were favoured with, or have recorded in the scriptures, for illuminating, con∣verting and building up the church;—or, if any Hea∣thens of old, <HI>Socrates, Heraclitus,</HI> or any of the Heathens at this day, have obtained, or do obtain, any <HI>just</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> revelations of GOD or his will, or any <HI>superna∣tural light</HI> or <HI>assistance,</HI> all has proceeded from the <HI>Mediator,</HI> that fountain of light and grace; that <HI>light of the Gen∣tiles</HI> and <HI>glory of his people Israel;</HI>—that <HI>true light</HI> which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world;—who, having been from eternity in the bosom of the Father, and having learned of him, declareth him to his crea∣tures;—for none hath <HI>thus</HI> known the Father, but the <HI>Son;</HI> the <HI>word</HI> and <HI>wisdom</HI> of GOD, and him to whom the Son revealeth him. In particular, we are assured, that "all scripture is given by inspiration of GOD;" and that the prophets spake in old time, as they were moved by the holy Ghost, which is the Spirit of Jesus.</P>
<P N="5">5. ALTHOUGH the Mediator was <HI>thus</HI> the Prophet of GOD in all ages; yet he was more <HI>visibly, sensibly</HI> and <HI>solemnly</HI> inaugurated and set a part to his prophetic office, at his baptism by <HI>John,</HI> where, instead of being anointed with oil (a ceremony used of old at the instalment of <HI>propliets,</HI> as well as of <HI>priests</HI> and <HI>kings</HI>) he was anointed with a plentiful effusion of the holy Ghost, with which he was filled without measure; and all men commanded to hear him, under that character, by a voice from hea∣ven;
<PB N="226" REF="014137_0225_0F97D4AFB43EC568"/>which seems a surprising, literal fulfilment of <HI>Moses's</HI> prophesy concerning him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xviii. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT may be observed, that Christ, in the course of his ministry, remarkably fulfilled and discharged the two branches of the prophetic office, mentioned above: 1. He revealed the will of GOD to men for their salva∣tion; and, 2. He foretold future events.</P>
<P N="7">7. IN the first of these branches, Christ the Medi∣ator, reveals the will of GOD to men, for their salvation, both by his <HI>word outwardly,</HI> and by <HI>his spirit</HI> applying the word to their hearts. In this respect, how far has he the pre-eminence above all other prophets? Other prophets can only declare GOD'S will to men, from the revelati∣on of Jesus Christ, and after this have no more that they can do, not being able to dispense the quickening Spirit, without which the outward declaration of GOD'S will, is ineffectual to the salvation of sinners: But this divine Prophet is not only the original <HI>revealer</HI> and <HI>declarer</HI> of GOD'S <HI>will,</HI> but also the <HI>dispenser of the Spirit,</HI> by which he can, when he pleases, reveal GOD'S will inwardly to the hearts and consciences of sinners, and make it ope∣rative and effectual there for their salvation.</P>
<P N="8">8. BY his personal ministry, and that of his Apostles, he as the Father's righteous servant, has revealed all truth and duty necessary to the salvation of sinners. He expressly declares, that what he spoke and taught was <HI>from the Father,</HI> and not of <HI>his own will</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xii. 49.</NOTE>. He un∣folded and cast a new light on the dark prophetic parts of the old Testament, and shewed how all the prophe∣sies and sacrifices there shadowed forth, prefigured and pointed to <HI>himself</HI> and <HI>gospel blessings,</HI> as the <HI>substance</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 27.</NOTE>. He made those things clear to us, which were not well
<PB N="227" REF="014137_0226_0F97D4B073D82010"/>understood by the prophets who revealed them, by the secret impulses of his Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet, i. 12.</NOTE>. He declared the spiri∣tual nature of GOD, and that worship he requires, and vindicated the <HI>purity, spirituality,</HI> and <HI>vast extent</HI> of the divine law, from the false glosses, and corrupt interpre∣tations of the Jewish teachers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. vi. and vii.</NOTE>. He distinctly re∣vealed the way and method of our recovery through himself; gave a clear revelation of a judgment to come, and of an eternal state of rewards and punishments; thus bringing life and immorality to such a clear light by his gospel, as it had never appeared in before, by former divine revelations.</P>
<P N="9">9. AS a Prophet, he foretold many future events, (which is deemed the highest proof of the prophetic spirit and character) such as <HI>Peter's</HI> denial of him; the treachery of <HI>Judas;</HI> his <HI>own</HI> sufferings, death, and resur∣rection; the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the disper∣sion of the Jews forty years before it happened<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 44.—xxi. 24.</NOTE>: The surprizing success and spread of his own gospel<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">mark xvi. 17, 18.</NOTE>: The sufferings and persecutions of his followers, and the degeneracy and corruption which should prevail among them. And, as all these things have punctual∣ly come to pass, we have abundant ground to believe, that the prophesies contained in the book of his reve∣lations to his servant <HI>John,</HI> and those prophesies, which by his Spirit, he enabled his other Apostles to utter, concerning the fall of <HI>Antichrist;</HI> the restoration of the <HI>Jews;</HI> the gathering in, and conversion of the Hea∣then nations; the glory of his church in the latter days, and the final destruction of our earth by fire, will, all of them, be accomplished in due time.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="228" REF="014137_0227_0F97D4B134D59AB0"/>
10. CHRIST also as a Prophet, teaches not only by <HI>outward revelations,</HI> but by the <HI>inward operations of the Spi∣rit</HI> on the souls of man. He not only spake as never man spoke; but his words (when he pleases) are <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>life;</HI> working powerfully and effectually in them who believe. He opened the heart of <HI>Lydia,</HI> that she attended to the things spoken by <HI>Paul.</HI> He open∣ed the understandings of his disciples, that they might understand the scriptures, and caused their hearts to burn within them, by the sacred energy of his Spirit, while he opened to them the scriptures concerning him∣self. Thus does he, when he pleases, make the light of his glorious gospel shine upon the hearts of sinners: enlighten, transform, and renew them, and thereby give free course to the word of his grace, and glorify it: And to him we are to look, as our Prophet, for those <HI>inward teachings,</HI> and <HI>effectual illuminations</HI> of his Spirit, to make his word effectual and saving.</P>
<P N="11">11. CHRIST the Mediator was foretold by <HI>Moses,</HI> as a Prophet, like unto himself, to be raised up, to the Jews, from among their brethren, to whom they should hearken without gainsaying or reserve. And the re∣semblance between HIM and <HI>Moses</HI> is remarkably strik∣ing in many respects: (1.) In their birth; they were both <HI>Israelites;</HI> both born in obscurity: (2.) In their early exposure to great <HI>risks, dangers</HI> and <HI>hardships:</HI> (3.) Both come to <HI>their own</HI> with special commission and miraculous power from GOD, and their own received them not kindly, but evilly requited them, and pervers∣ly rebelled against them: (4.) Both were exceedingly meek in their temper; exposed themselves to much hardship and self-denial in their ministry; were zealous, diligent and faithful in all GOD'S house: shewed great signs and wrought great miracles to confirm their mis∣sions: (5.) Both were authors of a new dispensation
<PB N="229" REF="014137_0228_0F97D4B1F4703D78"/>of religion, and Mediators between GOD and <HI>man:</HI> (6.) Both had near access to, and familiar converse with GOD, and peculiar marks of his favour; and had their revelations immediately from GOD, and confirmed them with the seal of miracles: (7.) Both fasted forty days: (8.) Both were very zealous for the LORD GOD of <HI>hosts,</HI> and affectionate lovers of an ungrateful people: (9.) Both were <HI>rulers</HI> and <HI>deliverers,</HI> as well as <HI>Prophets;</HI> the one from the captivity of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the bondage of <HI>Egypt;</HI> the other from the captivity of the <HI>devil,</HI> and the bondage of their own lusts: (10.) Both chose <HI>se∣venty disciples.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. LET us see to it, that we <HI>hearken to this Prophet,</HI> which speaketh from heaven. Let us hear with sub∣missive attention, both what he speaks to us <HI>outwardly</HI> by his word, and <HI>inwardly</HI> by the voice of his Spi∣rit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 23. Heb. xii. 25.

<HEAD>ESSAY XLVI. <HI>The</HI> PRIESTLY OFFICE <HI>of</HI> CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Aaronical priesthood, was a type of the priesthood of Christ, though the priesthood of <HI>Melchisedec,</HI> was a more perfect one: Consequently, the Jewish high-priests, and <HI>Melchisedec,</HI> were types of Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. TWO qualifications were necessary to the Jewish high-priests: (1.) That they should be of the same nature with their brethren<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 1. 2.—iv. 15.</NOTE>.—(2.) That they should be solemnly separated and set apart to their office, by the appointment of GOD, and by consecretion or inves∣titure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 1, 4.</NOTE>. Now Christ, the great high-priest of our profession, had both these qualifications<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 14, 17.—v. 5. 6, 9, 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. AS the priest's office, is founded on the fallen state of human nature, and appointed in relief of the guilty, it consists of two parts or branches: (1.) To offer sacrifice: And, (2.) To make intercession.</P>
<P N="4">4. SACRIFICES were of two kinds under the law: Either <HI>eucharistical,</HI> as acknowledgments of mercies; and these were commonly called <HI>gifts,</HI> and were <HI>unbloody,</HI> consisting of the fruits of the earth, &amp;c. Or, they were <HI>expiatory,</HI> or <HI>atonements</HI> for sin, and these were called <HI>sa∣crifices,</HI> and were always <HI>bloody;</HI> for, without shedding of blood, there was no remission of sins.</P>
<P N="5">5. CHRIST, in this sense, was a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real sacrifice.</HI> His soul was made <HI>an offering for sin.</HI> Thus he is called, <Q>The Lamb of GOD which taketh away the sins of
<PB N="231" REF="014137_0230_0F97D4B373C3D8A8"/>the world:—Our passover sacrificed for us:—The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world:—The propitiation for our sins, and the sins of the world: —He was offered to bear the sins of many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 12, 26.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. THE entire human nature of Christ was the sacri∣fice which he offered up for the sins of the world.—He not only gave his <HI>soul</HI> or <HI>life</HI> and offering for sin, but bore our sins in his own body on the tree:—And this sacrifice received its dignity and value from his <HI>divine nature,</HI> which offered the human: For he, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself up without spot unto GOD<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. BY this sacrifice has Christ made an atonement for sin; satisfied the demands of divine justice; con∣firmed and illustrated the truth, holiness and justice of GOD, and made his law exceeding honourable; pur∣chased our forfeited blessings and lost happiness; open∣ed a way for the mercy of GOD to all the sinful race of <HI>Adam;</HI> and procured the pardon of sin, the divine fa∣vour, the gift of the Spirit, and eternal life for every soul of man who will fall in with his saving design, and take him as their <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>King</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 7. 1 Tim. ii. 5. Gal. i. 4. Heb. ix. 12, 15. 1 John ii. 1, 2. Numb. vi. 23. Deut. xxi. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE intercessory part of the Priest's office, was to offer up the prayers of the people and to intercede for them. The high-priest entered into the holiest of all on the great day of atonement or expiation, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord; sprinkling the blood of their sacrifices before the mercy-seat. Christ, in like manner, having offered himself a sacrifice of atonement for our sins, hath entered into heaven, in the virtue of his most precious blood, to offer up the pray∣ers of his people, and make intercession for them<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 12, 24. Rom. viii. 34. Heb. 7. 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="232" REF="014137_0231_0F97D4B435532F20"/>
9. AS Christ was of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> not of <HI>Levi,</HI> from whom the Aaronical priesthood descended, so he is said to be a <Q>priest for ever after the order of Mel∣chisedec.</Q> The resemblance between the priest∣hood of Christ and that of <HI>Melchisedec</HI> is remarkable in several cases: (1.) In the ancientness of that order, and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s paying tithes to <HI>Melchisedec,</HI> and being blessed by him, although the father of the Aaronical priesthood. (2.) <HI>Melchisedec</HI> was a <HI>priest upon a throne,</HI> or a <HI>king</HI> as well as a <HI>priest;</HI> so was Christ. (3.) The original and descent of <HI>Melchisedec</HI> was peculiar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 3.</NOTE>; so was Christ's: For, who can declare his generation? (4.) The priesthood of <HI>Melchisedec</HI> was not encumbered with such a <HI>ritual,</HI> and so many ceremonies and carnal commandments and ordinances, as that of <HI>Aaron;</HI> but was more simple and catholic: So is Christ's.</P>
<P N="10">10. THERE are several things in the priesthood of Christ peculiar to itself; as, (1.) He was perfectly sin∣less, although he transacted with GOD for sinners. (2.) Other priests offered <HI>brutal sacrifices,</HI> but Christ offered <HI>himself.</HI> He was both the <HI>Priest</HI> and the <HI>sacrifice.</HI> His divine nature was the altar on which he offered up the humanity. (3.) Other priests offered <HI>many sacrifices,</HI> even <HI>daily;</HI> whereas he offered but <HI>one sacrifice</HI> of infinite value and virtue. (4.) Other priests and sacrifices, were ineffectual for expiating or taking away <HI>moral guilt:</HI> They made not him who did the service, or for whom it was done, <HI>perfect</HI> as pertaining to the <HI>conscience:</HI> They only took away the guilt of ceremonial pollutions or omissions: But the sacrifice of Christ takes away the guilt of all sin. This is <Q>the Lamb of GOD, which taketh away the sin of the world.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11. THE priesthood of Christ, and his most expen∣sive sacrifice, should put us in mind of our guilty state,
<PB N="233" REF="014137_0232_0F97D4B4F4AF1B38"/>and of the malignant nature of sin; seeing there could have been no remission of the very smallest sin, without the sheding of the blood of Christ.</P>
<P N="12">12. HENCE we see the wonderful love of GOD in preparing <HI>such a Priest</HI> and <HI>sacrifice,</HI> for our guilty race, and not sparing him, but freely giving him up for us all:—As also the amazing condescension and philan∣thropy of Christ, in becoming a sacrifice and victim for the <HI>ungodly;</HI> for <HI>sinners;</HI> for <HI>enemies.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. HOW <HI>freely, cheerfully,</HI> and <HI>assuredly</HI> should we de∣pend on the merit of such a sacrifice as this? And how entirely give ourselves over to the guidance of such an high-priest? How should we reverence him?

<P N="1">1.

<P N="3">3. IN considering those whom he subdues, and the kingly power he exercises over them both in subdu∣ing and ruling them, the following things may be ob∣served; (1.) All are at first of <HI>satan's kingdom; children of wrath;</HI> they <HI>serve divers lusts,</HI> and walk according to the course of this world, often indeed, they meet with checks of conscience; make resolutions; seem inclin∣able to submit to his government, and say, <Q>I go, fir— but go not;</Q> the love of sin still prevailing and ren∣dering them children of disobedience.—(2.) CHRIST gives them to understand, that they are rebels, and that if they persist they must inevitably perish<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job ix. 4. Luke xiii. 3.—xix. 27.</NOTE>.—(3.) He makes a proclamation of mercy and pardon to them if they return and submit; both by his word and Spirit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John vi. 37. Rev. iii. 20, 21.</NOTE>.—(4.) He shews them by his word and by his Spirit, that it is both their <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>interest</HI> to submit to
<PB N="235" REF="014137_0234_0F97D4B6754D7260"/>him as their rightful Lord and Sovereign; and that in vain they expect the benefits of his <HI>priestly office,</HI> if they submit not to him as <HI>a king</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xiv. 11, &amp;c.</NOTE>.—(5.) He convinces them of the infinite advantage resulting to them from an entire subjection to his laws and government: That they shall be pardoned;—received into favour;—made kings and priests to GOD;—kept from falling; and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.—(6.) He gives them the laws of his kingdom;—shews them the duties they must perform, and the sins they must watch against; that they must be <HI>diligent,—zealous,—fervent</HI> and <HI>persevering;</HI> that they must wait upon him, and not draw back by apostacy. And, (7.) He holds out both the <HI>crown</HI> and the <HI>cross:</HI> he shews them what they may expect to <HI>lose</HI> and <HI>suffer</HI> in his service; that they must be willing to part with, and forego all things for the crown of glory in reversi∣on; that they must be willing to deny themselves; to be hated of all men, and to lose life itself in his cause and in fidelity to him.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN sinners become the subjects of Christ, they cast themselves at his feet,—not desiring to capitu∣late or stand on terms; but give him (as a victorious prince) a <HI>blank paper</HI> to make his own terms; resolved, cheerfully and without reserve, to subscribe them. And this subjection is accompanied with the greatest love to, and desire after Christ,—his <HI>person</HI> and <HI>service,</HI> as well as his <HI>rewards;</HI> with a consent to be the Lords to all intents and purposes,—both to <HI>serve,</HI> to <HI>suffer for,</HI> and to <HI>enjoy</HI> him.

<P N="6">6. IN his government of enemies, he sets bounds to their power, malice and wickedness;—he turns the evil designed by them, into good; and in the end, he will exercise kingly power and authority over them, in taking vengeance on all that have continued incor∣rigible.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Christ hath exercised his kingly office in all ages of the world and church; but he will shew it more gloriously in the latter days, when the world will be full of his dutiful subjects.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLVIII. <HI>The due</HI> IMPROVEMENT <HI>of</HI> TIME.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we shall have considered the shortness of time; its vast importance, and pointed out the best methods of redeeming and improving it, we shall have exhausted this subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE shortness of time, both <HI>absolutely</HI> and <HI>relative∣ly</HI> considered, is so very obvious to persons who are the least capable of reflection and observation, that little need be said of it: For, (1.) How small a thing is the aggregate of time, making one total sum of all its dis∣tinctive periods, from the first birth of created things, to the final dissolution of this world and the present scene, and till time shall be computed no more? A few thousands of fleeting years will sum it all. Yet a little while, and the mighty angel shall lift up his hand to heaven, and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that <HI>time shall be no more.</HI> (2.) If we consider time as <HI>relative to us,</HI> or the <HI>measure of our duration;</HI> what a <HI>span,</HI> what an <HI>hand-breadth,</HI> what a <HI>cvpher</HI> is it? How quickly are our years gone, as a tale that is told? A <HI>day,</HI> how quickly is it gone; and yet how few are the days of the years of our lives? That mighty thing a <HI>year,</HI> which looks so large and extensive before us, how swiftly does it pass, and how short and trifling does it look in retrospect? Yet how few are the years of most lives?—How quickly does a clock tell a <HI>second?</HI> While we pronounce the word, it is expired? Yet a short row of figures in <HI>seconds,</HI> makes the sum of a long life. When we see the heap of sand in the upper lobe of an
<PB N="238" REF="014137_0237_0F97D4B8B46C5578"/><HI>hour-glass,</HI> and mark how slow it wastes, by running into the lower; we are apt to say, surely this will be long in expending; yet within the short compass of an hour, all is fallen! Just such is the life of man. Look for∣ward upon fifty or sixty years, it seems an immense heap of time; but the fleeting transient minutes quick∣ly run it out, and bring it to a period. (3.) How com∣paratively small is the period of most human lives? It is supposed, that not every tenth person reaches the age of thirty years. The two thirds of our species die in infancy, and these are happy? But from that age up, in which all are moral agents, and accountable for their actions, how many graves do we find of every length? How many die of every age? The thread of time (short at the very longest) is <HI>suddenly,</HI> and alas! <HI>unex∣pectedly</HI> cut off, and they drop into their graves, like unripe fruit.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE necessity of improving time, will appear not only from the <HI>shortness of its duration,</HI> but from its <HI>vast im∣portance.</HI> (1.) Time is our <HI>only opportunity</HI> both for <HI>do∣ing</HI> and <HI>receiving good,</HI> as <HI>accountable creatures. Opportunity</HI> is absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of every great and good design. If we had all the <HI>will</HI> and all the <HI>power</HI> in the world, to do good for ourselves or others; yet without opportunity, we can do nothing. The being that never existed, (if such an <HI>ideal being</HI> is fairly supposable) could never have any capacity or opportunity, either of enjoying or communicating good. The being which exists but a short time, though it may have the noblest capacities for doing and receiving good, yet <HI>its opportunity</HI> is only <HI>as its time.</HI> It is owing to the infinite goodness of GOD, that he ever created any be∣ing at all, or gave unto them capacities and opportuni∣ty of giving and enjoying good. The simple existence of every living creature which GOD hath made, is an
<PB N="239" REF="014137_0238_0F97D4BAA05DBC70"/>intentional favour and mercy to that creature; for, to <HI>exist,</HI> is to be in a capacity for happiness. It is better even for <HI>ants</HI> and the most <HI>trifling insects to be,</HI> than <HI>not to be;</HI> for, even their short and insignificant duration, is filled with a happiness suitable to their nature. But, where <HI>sense, reason</HI> and <HI>immortality</HI> are supperadded, to such beings, the intentional goodness of GOD is even infinitely greater; because, to such beings, GOD hath not only given nobler capacities of communicating and receiving a higher and more sublime happiness, but hath also given them an opportunity of enjoying this happiness eternally! O, then, under what high obliga∣tions are <HI>men,</HI> are <HI>human creatures,</HI> to GOD, even for his creating goodness, who hath taught them more than the beasts of the field, made them wiser than the fowls of heaven, stampt upon their nature the image of his own immortality, and made them capable of eternally enjoying the <HI>chief good?</HI> But, (2.) We must consider that the <HI>only opportunity</HI> which we have of ensuring the eternal enjoyment of the chief good of our natures, is our <HI>present, scanty, uncertain span of time.</HI> When the cur∣tain of time falls, all opportunity ceases of either <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>receiving</HI> that good, which will be eternal in its fruits, consequences and rewards: For, when the night of death cometh, no man can work the rewardable works of GOD; there is no knowledge, device or repentance in the grave. The reason is, because we are probation∣ary creatures, and our present precarious existence, is the only time of our trial. Hence it appears, how <HI>all-important</HI> time is to us, as our <HI>eternal all</HI> depends on the manner in which we improve our short allotment of it. It is our seed time for eternity. It is our work∣ing, labouring day, wherein we are to lay up in store a good foundation for the time to come. It is our only opportunity of providing for, and ensuring a blessed immortality. (3.) Hence it will follow, that
<PB N="240" REF="014137_0239_0F97D4BAF4984B60"/>as this is the talent which gives worth to all other ta∣lents, every day or hour of it abused, or not used in subserviency to our eternal interests, though it may not totally deprive us of <HI>eternal happiness itself,</HI> yet it will certainly lessen the <HI>degree of that happiness.</HI> He who, with <HI>one pound,</HI> gained <HI>ten,</HI> was made ruler over <HI>ten cities;</HI> and he who gained but <HI>two,</HI> was made ruler only over <HI>two</HI> cities. A plain proof, that a vigorous improve∣ment of <HI>this,</HI> and every other talent, will be proporti∣onably rewarded; and that the more slothful and idle servant (though he may not be altogether unfaithful) will fall short of the reward which he might have ob∣tained by diligence and circumspection.</P>
<P N="3">3. AS to the best methods of <HI>redeeming</HI> and <HI>improving</HI> time, the following may be worthy our attention: (1.) An habitual daily consideration of, and attention to the great importance of it, as it stands connected with our eternal interests.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) DAILY serious reflections on its <HI>exceeding short∣ness</HI> and <HI>uncertainty,</HI> and how quickly our day of proba∣tion may be at an end. And this will naturally lead us,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) TO consider the greatness of the work we have to do in this our day, and how dreadful the consequen∣ces will be to us, if we should leave it unfinished.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) MOST will find it worth their serious enquiry, whether they have ever, to this day, considered for what purpose they have had <HI>time,</HI> and been sent into this world; and whether they are not yet to learn the very meaning of the <HI>improvement of time.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) PERSONS who have a due sense of the impor∣tance and value of time, will employ as little of it as possible in <HI>absolute idleness;</HI> or, which is the same thing, in busying themselves in matters, which contribute no∣thing to their own advantage, or that of other persons, much less in mischief.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="241" REF="014137_0240_0F97D4BBB4784BF8"/>
(6.) TIME employed in worldly business and cares, is not always <HI>misspent</HI> or <HI>thrown away;</HI> for, while we have bodies, families, and the poor and needy to care for, lawful worldly industry, will ever be an essential part of our Christian duty. But that the time spent in worldly business be <HI>lawfully spent,</HI> it is necessary that we thus spend it in subserviency to a higher, nobler end; that we do it to the glory of GOD, and in obedience to his command, and that the world is kept down from the highest place in our affections.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) ALL time spent in diversions and amusements is not lost or squandered; for, it is needful, that the mind be unbent and the spirits refreshed, in order to fit both for more important duty. But diversions should never exceed this measure. A person who is running for a rich prize, should not stop and turn aside to catch butter∣flies.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) WHERE persons are conscious, that they have trifled away the prime of life in <HI>idleness; dissipation</HI> and <HI>pleasure,</HI> and in a wretched unconcern about their high∣est interests, it becomes them to be more frugal and parsimonious of time than others;—<HI>first,</HI> because much of it is already guiltily squandered and lost, and in all probability little remains,—and <HI>secondly,</HI> because they have peculiar need to redeem their time by a double di∣ligence in well doing, that, if possible, they may make some amends for former trifling.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) A RIGHT <HI>contrivance</HI> and <HI>planning</HI> of business, would be an excellent expedient for the better improve∣ment of time:—So much of every day to the duties of religion;—to the improvement of the mind;—to world∣ly cares and labours;—to company;—diversion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>(10.) DILIGENCE and <HI>dispatch</HI> in business, is absolute∣ly necessary to make the best of time.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XLIX. <HI>The</HI> CONSIDERATION <HI>of</HI> ETERNITY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ETERNITY, what a <HI>vast, amazing, unfa∣thomable, incomprehensible</HI> subject! It is the <HI>exis∣tence</HI> and <HI>duration</HI> of him, who is incomprehensible to all but himself!—As we quickly lose all our ideas in consi∣dering <HI>immensity,</HI> or <HI>infinite space;</HI>—so we are equally lost in considering <HI>eternity,</HI> or <HI>infinite duration;</HI> and no wonder, since they are in some sort attributes of the <HI>incomprehen∣sible</HI> JEHOVAH, which none by searching can find out unto perfection!</P>
<P N="2">2. THE word <HI>aion,</HI> which we English <HI>eternity,</HI> signifies <HI>perpetual existence;</HI> and since we are finite creatures, it is little wonder, that we should be incapable of forming any adequate conception of it: For, it is not to be sup∣posed, that a being who has <HI>begun to exist,</HI> should be able to conceive the nature of a being who is <HI>self-existent,</HI> and never had a beginning of existence.</P>
<P N="3">3. ETERNITY is generally distinguished into two periods (if one many be allowed so to express it;) the <HI>first,</HI> is the eternity of duration which <HI>is past,</HI> and which can be attributed only to GOD, who alone possesses it all: The <HI>second,</HI> is that eternity of duration which flows on endlessly from any given period of time. This last eter∣nity is not peculiar to GOD, but is attributed also to all immortal creatures, such as <HI>angels, men</HI> and <HI>devils;</HI> who, though they have begun to exist, yet never shall cease to be.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS last eternity, I mean the eternity of creatures, is not <HI>necessary</HI> like the duration of GOD'S existence; but wholly depending on the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>will of</HI> GOD, who
<PB N="243" REF="014137_0242_0F97D4BD364ECD30"/>has been pleased to form some of his creatures, for an existence co-eval with himself; <HI>i.e.</HI> to <HI>will</HI> and <HI>cause</HI> their duration to be <HI>eternal.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. HOW wonderful a being is <HI>that</HI> GOD, who is eter∣nal in his duration, and immensely unlimited in his ex∣istence! his <HI>duration</HI> and his <HI>being</HI> admit of no limits, and therefore admit of no kind of comparison with the <HI>existence</HI> or <HI>duration</HI> of any created being.</P>
<P N="6">6. HOW entirely are we dependent on GOD, from whose <HI>necessary existence,</HI> we have borrowed our <HI>limited existence;</HI> and by the very power of whose will, we con∣tinue to exist every moment?</P>
<P N="7">7. THOUGH <HI>absolute eternity</HI> belongs only to GOD, yet as we share in all that eternity which is before us, and must be happy or miserable through this endless dura∣tion, according as we spend our present time; it follows that we should live here below, with a constant habitu∣al view and regard to our eternal existence and dura∣tion.</P>
<P N="8">8. THIS will enable us upon all occasions to form a proper estimate of things. For, if any <HI>temporary</HI> or <HI>momentary</HI> pleasures, honours or gains, which would rob us of eternal happiness, should solicit our attention or pursuit, they ought, at all events, to be forborne and rejected.—And if any <HI>temporary</HI> sufferings or self-denials, which are necessary to our eternal happiness, should fall in our way, they should at all adventures, be endured rather than we should run the risk of suffering eternal tor∣ments: For, whatever of joy or pain is <HI>temporary,</HI> bears proportion to that which is <HI>eternal.</HI> And it is a maxim of eternal reason, that lesser inconveniences ought al∣ways to be preferred to greater; and that to <HI>sell eternal happiness</HI> for the pleasures of a <HI>moment,</HI> yea, of <HI>ten mil∣lions of years,</HI> argues desperate folly.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY L. <HI>The</HI> DUTY <HI>of</HI> MASTERS <HI>of</HI> FAMILIES.</HEAD>
<P>MASTERS of families are pretty universally al∣lowed to sustain the offices of <HI>prophets, priests</HI> and <HI>kings</HI> in their own families, and if we borrow our ideas of the number and importance of the duties they owe to their families, from the sustaining <HI>these three offices,</HI> their duty, in this relation, will appear very weighty and important indeed.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is the business of a <HI>prophet</HI> to <HI>instruct;</HI> it is there∣fore the business of masters of families, to instruct their families, not only in the maxims of prudential wisdom, but more especially in the doctrines and duties of reli∣gion.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT will not excuse parents in the neglect of this duty, that they are <HI>ignorant</HI> themselves. They ought to <HI>learn</HI> and get knowledge for this very purpose. And there are few, but if they take due pains, may acquire knowledge enough, to give <HI>good, wholesome</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> instructions to their housholds.</P>
<P N="3">3. IGNORANT and unlearned parents should be the more conscientious in providing proper instructors for their families.</P>
<P N="4">4. PARENTS may instruct their families very usefully and effectually by setting before them blameless, virtuous and religious examples; and the best instructions without this, will be very <HI>ineffectual,</HI> if not perni∣cious.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF it is the duty of <HI>kings</HI> to give good laws, and to preserve good order among their subjects; masters of families are obliged to do this in their families.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="245" REF="014137_0244_0F97D4BEB4C8D140"/>
6. THE orders and regulations of masters of families, in their families, should not be more numerous than is necessary, lest they be neglected or forgotten through the multiplicity of them; and their necessity should be <HI>made apparent,</HI> that they may be enforced with firmness and resolution.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the government of a family (a society often made up of persons of very different tempers and dispo∣sitions) great prudence, skill and attention are needful, and above all, the divine counsel and assistance.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT appears to be of ill consequence for the ruler of a family, to give way to the petulency or unreasonable humours of a capricious domestic; as this would be implicitly giving up his prerogative, and fostering ill humours, and rebellious, lawless dispositions in the sub∣ject. It belongs to Christian prudence to determine when this rule ought to be dispensed with, in order to prevent greater evils.</P>
<P N="9">9. LENITY, <HI>compassion</HI> and <HI>mercy,</HI> should be tempered with <HI>firmness, steadiness</HI> and <HI>resolution,</HI> in him, who would govern a family well. Tyranny in little domestic so∣cieties, is odious; and too much lenity may produce great evils.</P>
<P N="10">10. BODILY <HI>punishment</HI> should be the last expedient used to reform or correct a domestic offender; and pru∣dence alone can point out the proper time and place for this.</P>
<P N="11">11. THE good example of a king is equally binding with his laws, and far more encouraging and alluring; so it is in the master of a family.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE chief duties of a <HI>priest,</HI> are <HI>sacrifice</HI> and <HI>in∣tercession.</HI> This points out the obligation of <HI>praver,</HI> as a duty incumbent on all masters of families, in their own families.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="246" REF="014137_0245_0F97D4BF7542C400"/>
13. CHRISTIAN masters of families who neglect this duty <HI>habitually,</HI> act worse than the heathens did, who daily offered prayers and sacrifices to their <HI>gods.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. IF <HI>family prayer</HI> and <HI>instruction</HI> are duties incum∣bent on all Christian masters of families, which they in∣dispensably owe to GOD, and to the souls of their chil∣dren and other domestics; and if the <HI>morning</HI> and <HI>even∣ing</HI> are the proper seasons pointed out for the profitable performance of this duty; then the masters of families who, for ordinary, or very often, spend their mornings and evenings abroad from their families, are not in the way of their Christian duty, and their families do pro∣bably lose more by this absence and neglect, than they can gain by the cares and worldly labours of the day.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LI. <HI>How</HI> CHRISTIANS <HI>may and ought to resist</HI> TEMPTATI∣ONS, <HI>and make them turn out to the</HI> BENEFIT <HI>of themselves and others.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS we are, by nature, and by the prevailing in∣fluence of evil example, exceeding prone to sin; and as temptations to it are scattered thick in our way, so to resist temptations to evil, is certainly the most <HI>important</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> part of our Christian duty and warfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE difficulty of our resisting a temptation, is in proportion to our natural or habitual proneness to the particular sin to which we are tempted, and the strength or weakness of our virtue or grace, taken together.</P>
<P N="3">3. A PERSON who has been, by <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>custom,</HI> and may still be by <HI>constitution,</HI> exceeding prone to some particular sin; yet, by improvement in virtue and strength of grace, may much more easily resist a temp∣tation to that particular sin, than another person of weaker grace and feebler virtue, who is, and has been naturally and constitutionally less inclined to that sin.</P>
<P N="4">4. SOME very vicious and wicked persons, have little inclination to some certain sins, and therefore are in less danger of being tempted to commit them than others of much better dispositions upon the whole; yet whose unhappiness it is, to be naturally prone to those sins, and easily drawn into them.</P>
<P N="5">5. WORLDLY-MINDED, <HI>covetous</HI> persons, are not ea∣sily tempted to the sins of idleness, gaming, squander∣ing or luxury, and but seldom have any strong propen∣sity
<PB N="248" REF="014137_0247_0F97D4C0F53A5BA8"/>to carnal, sensual indulgences, or the sins of the flesh; because, all these oppose and tend to destroy their ruling passion, which is the love and pursuit of gain. But they are prone to the sins of lying for gain, of cheating, over-reaching, injustice, usury, cruelty, op∣pression, and immoderate worldly cares, hazards and toils; and against these their strongest watch and guard should be placed: For, it is but a vain and emp∣ty boast, for a covetous man to say, <Q>I am no game∣ster, prodigal, or spendthrift; no careless, slothful man.</Q> The world knows he is not, cannot be such, in consistence with his ruling passion; and that care, diligence and frugality in him, are only ministers and hand-maids of his capital vice.</P>
<P N="6">6. ANGRY, <HI>envious, malicious, revengeful</HI> persons; as also, <HI>vain, boasting, ambitious</HI> men, are seldom prone to the sins of the flesh, or the soft, social, effeminate vices. This is not the complexion of their nature, or the cast of their corruption. Their ruling passion leads them to other objects, and renders them an easy prey to a dif∣ferent set of temptations. Therefore it is little virtue in them, to be free from a set of sins, to which they have naturally so little propensity.</P>
<P N="7">7. THOSE who are extremely addicted to the sins of the flesh, are often free from the sins of <HI>pride, vanity, ambition, malice, covetousness</HI> and <HI>revenge;</HI>—not because they are <HI>virtuous,</HI> but because they have no strong biass towards these sins, and because the current of their cor∣ruptions hurries them another way, and leads them to different objects. It would therefore be an empty boast in <HI>such a person,</HI> to say, <Q>I am just in my commercial dealings, easy in my temper, affable in my deport∣ment, kind, charitable, and good natured to all,</Q>—be∣cause the opposite sins do not clash or interfere with his <HI>ruling passion.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="249" REF="014137_0248_0F97D4C1B3E5FED8"/>
8. THE <HI>first</HI> rule for resisting temptations, is to be perfectly acquainted with our <HI>ruling passion,</HI> and our strongest propensities to vice;—or in the more nervous language of scripture, <HI>To know, every man,</HI> the <HI>plague of his own heart;</HI> the sin which does <HI>most easily beset him;</HI> his <HI>bosom sin,</HI> his <HI>beloved lust.</HI> Every man has some sin∣ful passion or propensity which <HI>predominates</HI> above the rest. And to <HI>know</HI> this sin, is to have discovered our greatest enemy, and our greatest weakness.</P>
<P>THE <HI>second</HI> rule is, to set the strongest guard upon the weakest avenue of our soul, and against our most powerful enemy.</P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> rule is, to hold no deliberáte parley with this prevailing lust, nor ever to spare or give it quarter, when it makes its assaults however artfully.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fourth</HI> rule is, to shun those thoughts, compa∣nies and amusements, which we have found by experi∣ence, to prove fuel to the sins which most easily beset us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fifth</HI> rule is, to pray and strive in a special man∣ner against these particular sins.</P>
<P>THE <HI>sixth</HI> rule is, to consider the danger of falling under the power of these enemies, and the difficulty of recovering. To all these may be added, a</P>
<P>SEVENTH prudential maxim, namely, to keep our∣selves diligently employed in some honest calling or bu∣siness, which is a very powerful preservative against temptation, as it cuts off those occasions and opportu∣nities which minister to it.</P>
<P N="9">9. TEMPTATIONS may turn to the advantage of those who resist them many ways:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) As conquest over them is a proof of grace, and ground of joy.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) As every conquest of this kind strengthens the habit of virtue; gives courage and magnanimity to the
<PB N="250" REF="014137_0249_0F97D4C273BDBE28"/>soul, and renders future victories over the same enemy more easy.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) As it renders those who have thus conquered, the better qualified to advise and succour those that are tempted, and gives them a better right to do so.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) As it shews us experimentally the power put into our hands to conquer other temptations, and tends to humble and give us remorse for not having availed ourselves of this power upon former occasions.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) As it tends to beget gratitude in us towards that Being, by whose grace alone we are enabled to conquer any temptation; and teaches us <HI>on whom</HI> to rely, and <HI>whence</HI> to draw our succours, in future trials. And,</P>
<P N="6">(6.) As it is beating the devil in the field of battle, depriving him of a triumph, and discouraging him from farther attempts upon us.</P>
<P N="10">10. WE may make the resisting of temptations use∣ful to others, in various ways: As, (1.) If we are so∣licited by any particular person to sin, to resist his solici∣tation, may be a means of reforming him. (2.) On some occasions it may be lawful and useful to encourage and support the tottering virtue of others, by informing them of our success; or by relating it under the fictiti∣ous name of some third person: As, <Q>I have known a person, who was thus tempted, and thus resisted.</Q> (3.) If the temptation is of <HI>a public kind,</HI> he who resists it, preaches a loud sermon against vice; and it is much if some one or more, in company, are not benefited by it. (4.) If none for the present are bettered by such a public testimony against vice, yet it must leave the guilty, under such a conviction of the power and merit of virtue, as may some time or other prevail.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LII. PUBLIC SPIRIT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. PUBLIC <HI>spirit,</HI> is a <HI>generosity of temper,</HI> arising from the principle of universal benevolence, and is directly opposed to a <HI>narrow, selfish, contracted</HI> temper, which seeks only its own private interest, plea∣sure and advantage.</P>
<P N="2">2. A TRULY public spirited person, does not, indeed, neglect himself as an individual, nor his family, as parts of himself; but he does not live for himself or his family alone; his generous heart deviseth liberal things, and takes pleasure in forming schemes and projects for the good of mankind, with whose interest he feels his own interest to be closely and inseparably connected. On the contrary, a <HI>selfish person,</HI> destitute of the virtue of public spirit, has his eye chiefly fixed on that dear idol <HI>himself</HI> (of which he considers his family as a part.) All his schemes and projects terminate there, and he takes little or no pleasure in any advantage, or honour, but what comes in to this dear idol.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHATEVER promotes the public honour or good: whatever scheme <HI>brings</HI> or <HI>offers</HI> benefit to one's coun∣try, or tends to promote its credit and reputation among strangers, gives a peculiar pleasure to the pub∣lic spirited person, and he is ready to encourage, sup∣port and assist it, to the utmost of his power. If he has not the talent of projecting such schemes himself, he readily falls in with them when proposed, and is so far from needing to be prompted to join in them, that he rejoices in having an opportunity of <HI>doing public good,</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="014137_0251_0F97D4C3F3B27388"/>which is his favourite ruling passion. And if he can do but little himself in gratifying so benevolent a passion, he labours to encourage others, who are better able. On the contrary, the <HI>selfish man,</HI> has a thousand pruden∣tial reasons against consenting to a scheme which might cost him something: <Q>It will beggar the public; it will oppress the poor; it is impracticable; or it will never answer the end proposed.</Q>—If he is out-voted by a majority, he consents with reluctance, and is for bringing the terms of expence as low as possible, always having an eye to <HI>self.</HI>—If for shame be is obliged to contribute, the hesitating manner in which he does it, or the boasts he makes of it, give plain evidence that he did it unwillingly.—If the scheme miscarries, or does not answer the intention, he reproaches and abuses the projectors, and makes this an argument against all fu∣ture public spirited projects.</P>
<P N="4">4. A TRULY public spirited person has a real, sensible pleasure in the prosperity and success of his neighbours, and heartily feels for their adversity and ill-fortune. It would give his generous benevolent heart a refined plea∣sure to see all prosperous, all rich, all healthy, all hap∣py, all honoured and esteemed:—And when he sees the reverse, he <HI>feels</HI> for the calamity of his neighbours, and is himself the less happy amidst his own health, ho∣nour, success and abundance. On the contrary, the <HI>selfish man</HI> has an <HI>unfeeling heart</HI> towards his neighbour.— Is he happy and prosperous himself? He hugs and blesses himself in his good fortune: He sacrifices to his own net, and burns incense to his own dreg. He imputes it to his own industry, diligence, honesty or in∣tegrity, and has no pity for his neighbour's misfortunes which, according to him, are all owing to some neglect or misconduct on his part. In short, he <HI>feels only for him∣self,</HI> unaffected either with hearty joy or grief for the good or bad fortune of others.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="253" REF="014137_0252_0F97D4C4B3DC4E60"/>
5. THE public spirit of a place may be pretty cer∣tainly inferred, from the monuments of it in that place. Do we see in a nation or in a neighbourhood, <HI>learning, arts</HI> and sciences encouraged and flourishing; rich and stately churches; charity foundations for educating the poor, and healing the sick; the public roads in good repair and the like; it may be depended on, that pub∣lic spirit prevails in such places.—On the contrary, where <HI>public works</HI> and <HI>public charities</HI> are neglected in places, otherwise rich and opulent, and where private property abounds, it may be depended on, that <HI>there</HI> a <HI>selfish spirit</HI> and <HI>narrow, contracted principles prevail.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. PUBLIC spirit was cultivated and cherished with the greatest care amongst the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> and had wonderful effects in <HI>that commonwealth.</HI> It seems now to prevail much in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>British colonies.</HI> Wherever <HI>true learning</HI> and <HI>noble sentiments of liberty</HI> pre∣vail, it flourishes. Under the contrary circumstances, it is <HI>starved</HI> and <HI>perishes.</HI> It is at a low ebb among these Islands, a few only excepted.</P>
<P N="7">7. PUBLIC spirit is <HI>a shinning</HI> and a useful virtue: (1.) It is the offspring of universal charity and benevolence. (2.) It is the brightest resemblance of GOD and his <HI>blessed San.</HI> (3.) It is the certain mark of a <HI>brave, en∣larged, benevolent</HI> soul. (4.) It is the parent of <HI>noble, generous</HI> and <HI>useful</HI> actions.—And therefore, (5.) It is the source of the truest and most rosined delight and pleasure to those who are possessed of it.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE Apostles of Christ, and those of their succes∣sors who propagated the gospel in foreign nations, at the expence of every thing dear and comfortable in na∣ture, gave proof of the highest and noblest public spirit∣edness.</P>
<P N="9">9. NEXT to these, those who charitably contribute to the propagation of the gospel, stand foremost in the catalogue of the public spirited.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="254" REF="014137_0253_0F97D4C6B1E404B8"/>
10. THE Christian religion lays down the finest and <HI>noblest rules,</HI> and the <HI>strongest motives</HI> for public spirit; and indeed, a selfish man cannot be a true Chris∣tian.</P>
<P N="11">11. SELFISHNESS is the most despicable of all human vices.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LIII. A <HI>proper</HI> TEMPER <HI>and</HI> CONDUCT <HI>toward</HI> ENEMIES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. OUR blessed Saviour has laid down an express precept to his disciples, which <HI>states</HI> and <HI>limits</HI> their duties towards enemies: <Q>But I say unto you love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you,</Q> Matth. v. 44. He hath also enforced this precept, by giving the highest example of obedience to it, in his own conduct. Yet there is no precept of the gospel, the equity of which has been more disputed than this, and the impos∣sibility of obedience to it, more stiffly and publicly asserted.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE reason of the great reluctance of men's minds against this precept seems to be this, that ma∣lice and revenge are the most radical parts of the <HI>devil's</HI> image remaining in the minds of men, through their apostacy and the corruption of their nature; and <HI>these</HI> together with <HI>mistaken notions of self-preservation,</HI> and <HI>im∣moderate self-love,</HI> disposed men to imagine, that to love an enemy is <HI>impossible,</HI> and to hate him is <HI>just.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="255" REF="014137_0254_0F97D4C74DC13D80"/>
3. BUT when we speak of the duty of <HI>loving enemies,</HI> we must carefully distinguish between the love of <HI>ap∣probation</HI> and <HI>esteem,</HI> and the love of <HI>benevolence</HI> or <HI>good∣will.</HI> As to the <HI>former,</HI> we cannot have it for one who does not appear amiable to our understanding, even to a child;—but the latter we owe, and ought to pay to all men. A parent for instance, is far from ap∣proving a <HI>stubborn, refractory, immoral</HI> child; yet still his love of benevolence and good-will, shall continue in its full force and efficacy. <Q>GOD hateth the workers of iniquity, and is angry with the wicked every day:</Q> He cannot therefore love them with a love of <HI>esteem</HI> and <HI>complacency;</HI> yet is he <HI>good</HI> and <HI>kind</HI> to the <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>unthankful;</HI> and with such a love of benevolence and beneficence did he love this <HI>sinful, inimical</HI> world, as to give his only begotten Son to it, <Q>that whosoever be∣lieveth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 45. John iii. 16.</NOTE>.</Q> Christ could not surely love with esteem and complacency the inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who killed and stoned the prophets, and were then plotting against his own life without a cause: Yet how warmly does he express his love of benevolence and beneficence to them, and even prays for his own murderers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiii. 37. Luke xix. 41, 42.—xxiii. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>extent</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of the duties of benevolence and beneficence, either to friends or enemies, is various, according to <HI>merit, circumstances,</HI> or <HI>relation.</HI> The general scripture rule is, "To do good to all:"—The restriction is, <HI>to some more than to others,</HI> according to a variety of circumstances and considerations.—A good maxim in this case, is, to prefer <HI>compassion to an enemy,</HI> before a mat∣ter of mere <HI>generosity to a friend,</HI> when we cannot exercise both together.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="256" REF="014137_0255_0F97D4C7B45B9C38"/>
5. NEITHER reason nor scripture requires any acts of kindness to our enemy, which are evidently prejudi∣cial to our own interest, or which might give him an ad∣vantage over us.</P>
<P N="6">6. WE should <HI>forgive,</HI> and <HI>do good</HI> to enemies, after the example of GOD and <HI>his Son</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6,—10. 1 John iv. 10.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LIV. TEMPTATIONS <HI>arising from</HI> COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is generally allowed, that we take in most temptations by the ear, or by the sense of hear∣ing; and if so, we are exposed to numberless temptati∣ons in company: Especially, if we consider, that the eye comes in, in aid of the ear, and often helps on these temptations.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS is occasioned by the universal corruption and degeneracy of human nature, and by the consequent carnal, earthly, impure nature of the passions and affec∣tions, and the ungovernable licentiousness of the tongue which is actuated by those inward, irregular and im∣pure movements of the soul. Human society, in its present state, may be compared to a <HI>Hospital,</HI> where all are weak and diseased, and where, by a spreading con∣tagion, every one more or less infects another, and in∣creases his weakness and disorder: So, that every mem∣ber of it, is more or less infected and contaminated by others. No two can associate together, who are in a state of perfect health and soundness.</P>
<P N="3">3. UPON the whole, the <HI>wiser</HI> and <HI>more virtuous</HI> our company is, the less will we be exposed to tempations of any kind;—and it may happen, that in many occa∣sional interviews with wise and virtuous persons, all may, upon the whole, be made better.—This effect might be expected from religious societies and conferences, were they rightly conducted.—But we now chiefly mean, the <HI>common</HI> and <HI>occasional</HI> interviews of mankind with each other, at <HI>entertainments, complimental visits, parties of
<PB N="258" REF="014137_0257_0F97D4C93406F840"/>pleasure, accidential</HI> or <HI>occasional rendezvous,</HI> and the like, to which we are said to resort <HI>for the sake of com∣pany.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. ONE of the first temptations arising from com∣pany, which we shall mention, is to <HI>error.</HI> It is scarce possible to spend an hour in any company where <HI>religion, morality,</HI> or matters of <HI>human prudence</HI> are the topics, but some pernicious <HI>error</HI> is broached and maintained by some, and imbibed and embraced by others. <HI>False maxims</HI> are so exceeding common in the world, and so universally espoused, and adhered to by the multi∣tude, that it is scarce possible to steer clear of them in any company; and many of them seem, at first sight, so plausible, as well as recommended by ge∣neral practice, that the weak and inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsiderate readi∣ly swallow them, and he must be a resolute person in∣deed, who will dare to controvert them:—For in∣stance,—<Q>That it is lawful to hate and persecute our enemy, and take private revenge. That a man is to study his own ease, pleasure and interest, and the like.</Q> These errors though they may seem, at first sight, of little consequence, yet lead men to the most pernicious and immoral practices, and confirm them in them.</P>
<P N="5">5. COMPANY tempts to <HI>levity.</HI> In the gaiety of conversation we are often led insensibly away from that sobriety and temperance of mind (if we may so speak) which always becomes creatures in our circum∣stances. <HI>Puns, flashes of wit, humour,</HI> and a thousand hints started in almost every mixed company, <HI>intoxi∣cate</HI> and <HI>inebriate</HI> the mind, and render it <HI>volatile</HI> and <HI>un∣guarded.</HI> And this is most commonly the case, where <HI>good nature</HI> prevails, and <HI>good cheer</HI> abounds; where the minds of all are opened by mutual love and good cheer, and under no restraint or reserve. Persons
<PB N="259" REF="014137_0258_0F97D4C9F5F73368"/>in this situation are often so far hurried off their guard, as to violate the laws of good morals, either by bear∣ing too hard upon the weakness or good nature of some person in company;—by exposing or ridiculing some absent person, or by smutty jests and double <HI>entendres,</HI> offensive to the modest ear, and prejudicial to all.— And when these come also to be aided by <HI>immodest looks,</HI> or <HI>gestures,</HI> and so, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison the <HI>eye,</HI> as well as the <HI>ear,</HI>—morality must receive a dangerous would, and corruption be propagated.</P>
<P N="6">6. COMPANY tempts to <HI>profanity.</HI> It is very seldom, that matters of religion are conversed of in company with <HI>that decency</HI> and <HI>discretion</HI> which becomes such sub∣jects. Scripture is often quoted with a <HI>levity</HI> and <HI>indis∣cretion,</HI> which betrays a great irreverence for it. The great doctrines of religion are disputed and controverted, with an angry warmth, or a flippant lightness, which tends to discredit them both in our own minds, and in the minds of others. The names of GOD and CHRIST, <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>hell, salvation</HI> and <HI>damnation,</HI> are bandied about as the meerest trifles. Disrespectful and unbe∣lieving hints are often uttered, in the heat of passion and discontent, against doctrines or duties, which we do not like, and which cross the grain of our corrupt nature: All which tend to destroy our reverence for holy things, an eraze the very foundations of practi∣cal seriousness and piety.</P>
<P N="7">7. WE do not now speak of those companies and so∣cieties where <HI>profanity,</HI> and <HI>irreligion</HI> are the professed topics of conversation; nor of those schools of debau∣chery and sensuality, where persons meet for the pur∣poses of <HI>drunkenness</HI> and <HI>lewdness.</HI> At such places per∣sons seek temptations, and not temptations persons. But we speak of those <HI>social meetings,</HI> which are deemed <HI>innocent, diverting,</HI> and even <HI>improving,</HI> and of the
<PB N="260" REF="014137_0259_0F97D4CAB3AE4538"/>temptations there to be met with, and guarded against.</P>
<P N="8">8. COMPANY tempts to a sinful mispense of time, in idle and unprofitable discourse. The danger of com∣pany would be still less than it is, if the conversation could be confined to something <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>profitable</HI> of any kind, though it did not turn much on matters of morality or religion;—such as <HI>history, geography,</HI> the <HI>laws and customs of nations,</HI> the <HI>improvement of trade, hus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an∣dry, navigation,</HI> and the other <HI>arts and sciences:</HI> But to the scandal of most companies, the conversation generally turns upon <HI>mere nonsensical bagatelles;</HI> degenerates into <HI>empty chit chat</HI> upon the veriest trifles, where the hearers have a chance to learn nothing but the most imperti∣nent nonsense, and where the speakers must run into the same insipid nonsense, if they would be heard. <HI>Thus,</HI> much precious time is often thrown away in <HI>those idle words,</HI> for which men must give a serious account at the last day;—that foolish talking and jesting which is not convenient, by which guilt is contracted, and a habit of trifling acquired.</P>
<P N="9">9. BACKBITING, <HI>calumny</HI> and <HI>detraction,</HI> are other temptations frequently met with in company. It is of the nature of human corruption, that it drives men from one extreme to another. If companies are not be∣trayed into the <HI>social</HI> and <HI>good-natured vices</HI> of <HI>levity, dissi∣pation,</HI> and <HI>intemperate gaiety;</HI> or sunk into the <HI>swinish vices of debauchery, drunkenness</HI> and <HI>lewdness;</HI> or carried away by <HI>impiety</HI> and <HI>profanity;</HI>—they are too generally engaged in the dirty work of <HI>calumny</HI> and <HI>detraction.</HI> The s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bles and weaknesses of absent persons, are put in the most ridiculous light, and their persons exposed to contempt;—or their failings are criticised and magnified, and their characters maliciously torn to pieces. And while appeals are every moment made to you for the
<PB N="261" REF="014137_0260_0F97D4CB756F0038"/><HI>trust</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> of these slanders, you are put to the sad ne∣cessity, either of quarrelling for your absent friend—or, which is far more common, of hearing him traduced in silence, and perhaps, through a weak complaisance, joining issue with the slanderer, and granting things to the disadvantage of an innocent, injured person, which your conscience does not approve.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE best methods of shunning the temptations arising from company, are, (1.) For ordinary to fre∣quent and associate with the best companies: For, man being a social creature, cannot well be wholly without company.—(2.) When we accidentally or on business fall into company of a worse kind, to endeavour as far as our influence will reach, to give the conversa∣tion a profitable, or, at least, an innocent turn and di∣rection.—(3.) Where we cannot do this, to be on our guard against unworthy compliances, and to discounte∣nance, as far as we can, trifling, profanity and immora∣lity.—(4.) If we find ourselves unable to do this, and that we are in danger of sinful compliances, to make our stay as short as possible.—(5.) To make reflections after retiring, on the temptations we have met with, and to fortify our minds against future dangers of the same kind.—(6.) To shun, if possible, for the future, those companies, or kinds of company, in which we have met with temptations too strong for our virtue and resolution: And, (7.) which ought to have been mentioned <HI>first,</HI> To aim our prayers and endeavours against the temptations of society, and especially of those companies, which, by the nature of our situation or bu∣siness in lie, we are obliged most commonly to fre∣quent.</P>
<P N="11">11. SOLITUDE, and a sequestered retirement, as we shall see anon, is no security against temptations; and
<PB N="262" REF="014137_0261_0F97D4CC33A81F00"/>man, a sociable creature, could never be designed for it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LV. TEMPTATIONS <HI>arising from</HI> SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ALTHOUGH a social life, or a life spent in company, has its snares and dangers, yet it has its advantages too; and the society of our fellow-creatures, well conducted, may contribute greatly to our improvement in virtue and happiness. How many noble and useful hints are often started in conversation, which we would have laboured for in vain in the way of private meditation? How many motives to virtue, and dissuasives against vice? How often has a tottering re∣solution been supported and strengthened by a single word; by a single look or frown?</P>
<P N="2">2. NOR need we imagine, that we can flee from the danger of temptation, by shunning the society of our fellow-creatures; for, there are a number of temptati∣ons which seem almost peculiar to <HI>solitude,</HI> and which will pursue us to the most remote and hidden recesses.</P>
<P N="3">3. AS GOD hath made man a <HI>social creature,</HI> and en∣dowed him with <HI>social bents,</HI> it appears he is chiefly de∣signed for a <HI>social, active</HI> life, to give assistance to, and receive assistance from his fellow-creatures; and there∣fore, that it is not the duty of men to seek and affect so∣litude and retirement, unless it be ocasionally, for the purposes of meditation, self-examination, extraordinary prayer and devotion.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="263" REF="014137_0262_0F97D4CCF489A560"/>
4. IF it be the intention of GOD, that me should live in society, and employ their social powers and ta∣lents for the purposes of devotion; we may well sup∣pose that a <HI>monkish, recluse</HI> life, is against the intention of GOD, and that he may justly give over men to strong temptations, who thus affect a kind of life, so contrary to the end and design of their being.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT has been observed, that the first <HI>hermits</HI> and <HI>re∣cluses,</HI> did greatly corrupt Christianity; and that the monks and nuns of later ages, have been, generally speaking, a very wicked kind of people, infamous for many great vices: For, by binding themselves up un∣der solemn vows, to austerities which GOD never en∣joined, their corruptions have been the more outrageous, and they have been suffered to fall into the vilest abo∣minations.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is remarkable, that the <HI>devil</HI> pursued our Savi∣our to a wilderness, where he thought he could more ef∣fectually ply his temptations against him, than in the society of men. And the evil spirit, in the parable, who left the possessed man, is said to have wandered in <HI>solitary</HI> and <HI>dry places,</HI> where he consorted with many other spirits. Nor is it unworthy of a remark here, that if there is any truth in <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rast,</HI> and the pranks and illusions of evil spirits, they have generally prevailed in places <HI>little frequented</HI> and <HI>thinly peopled,</HI> and have fled places of concourse in the society of then.</P>
<P N="7">7. SOLITUDE often tempts men to sins, through the advantage of secrecy, which they would be ashamed to practise in human society.</P>
<P N="8">8. SOLITUDE naturally generates melancholy, and clouds the mind with gloomy thoughts; thereby dark∣ening and spoiling the judgment.</P>
<P N="9">9. RECLUSES, as they have little society with the world, and know little of the force of these temptations
<PB N="264" REF="014137_0263_0F97D4CDB399E278"/>which accompany a social life, so they are naturally prone to an over-rigid, uncharitable disposition of mind, and censorious reflections on the actions and conduct of those who are engaged in active, social life.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE <HI>devil,</HI> ever vigilant and active to seduce rati∣onal creatures, when he cannot get the advantage over them, by the temptations which arise from society, of∣ten drives them into sullen solitude; puts them out of temper with the world, and the proper duties of life, and there pursues them with <HI>blasphemous suggestions, un∣clean thoughts,</HI> and <HI>desperate resolutions.</HI> And it has been generally observed, that those whom he drives to <HI>self-murder,</HI> have been long haters of society, and lovers of solitude and retirement.</P>
<P N="11">11. UPON the whole. To shun society lest we fall into temptation, is not only rank cowardice, but also very absurd. There are proper times and occasions when we should seek solitude, and when retirement is both necessary and useful; but we should consider the proper duties of our stations as <HI>men</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> and never fly society when we have a chance of either doing or getting good by it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LVI. <HI>How far</HI> CHRISTIANS <HI>are obliged to recede from their proper Rights, and deny themselves some lawful Enjoyments and Amusements, out of Charity to their weak Brethren, and that they may not lay a Stumbling-block before them.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CHRISTIANS, as such, are not abridged of any <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>acquired right</HI> as <HI>men</HI> and <HI>ci∣tizens;</HI> nor does their religion forbid them and lawful and innocent enjoyment, or gratification of life, provid∣ed it does not fall directly in the way of some duty of religion, for which it ought to be denied for a time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix. 3,—7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. NOT only have Christians <HI>such liberty in the</HI> LORD, but it is often their duty to plead for, vindicate and as∣sert this liberty, against those who would dispute or infringe it; even while, for prudential reasons, or for conscience sake, they may see it expedient to recede from it, and give it up.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Apostle, however, gives an important cau∣tion in this matter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. viii. 9.</NOTE>: <Q>But take heed, lest by any means, this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak.</Q> It is certain, there∣fore, that this Christian liberty of ours, may in some instances, be used to very bad purposes; and things which are lawful in themselves, are not lawful to <HI>all men,</HI> nor <HI>at all times,</HI>—but ought to be forborn, when, through the ignorance or weakness of our Christian brother, they may be a means of offending
<PB N="266" REF="014137_0265_0F97D4CF351C34E8"/>him, or leading him into guilt. <HI>St. Paul</HI> speaks of a <HI>power</HI> or <HI>liberty</HI> which he and the other Christians had, to do many things, and yet adds,—<Q>Neverthe∣less we have not used this power, but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix. 12.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. THERE are, it seems, some instances, wherein the use and exercise of our Christian liberty, may <HI>destroy</HI> a <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>ignorant brother. St. Paul,</HI> speaking of meats forbidden by the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> declares the power and liberty which Christians have to use them freely: <Q>I know, says he, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself;</Q>—yet he adds—<Q>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably.—Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died:—For, through thy knowledge (of thy Christian liberty, and use of it) shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died: For, when we sin so against the brethren, and would their weak conscience, we sin against Christ.—Let no man put a stumbling-block, or an occa∣sion to fall, in his brother's way. It is good nei∣ther to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. But let us follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Rom. xiv. and 1 Cor. viii.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5.—(1.) THIS Christian liberty of ours is never to be given up merely to please, humour, and gratify <HI>some</HI> at the expence of <HI>others.</HI> This was the cause of <HI>Peter's</HI> base dissimulation, for which his brother <HI>Paul</HI> withstood him to his face, and on account of which he declared, <Q>that he walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Gal. ii. 11,—14.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="267" REF="014137_0266_0F97D4CFF3989A58"/>
6.—(2.) OUR Christian liberty is by no means to be betrayed or given up, in order to escape persecution. This treachery seems to have been the chief crime of the <HI>Judaizing teachers,</HI> who urged it upon the Gentile converts to be circumcised, and who themselves observ∣ed all the ceremonies of the Jewish law, that they might pass for <HI>Jews,</HI> with the Jewish and Heathen per∣secutors, under that pretext; and for which <HI>St. Paul,</HI> so severely reproaches them and their followers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gal. ii. 1,—6.—iii. 1,—4.—v. 1,—13.</NOTE>.— And indeed, all persecution for religion, and among Christians, is founded on some incroachment on Chris∣tian liberty,—or on imposing some things on the con∣science inconsistent with it.</P>
<P N="7">7.—(3.) OUR Christian liberty should not be given up to meer peevishness, humour and caprice. Many persons who know, or ought to know the extent of Christian liberty, are yet so unreasonable in their humours or un∣happy in their temper, that they will not allow to others the same innocent liberties which they allow to them∣selves. or, while they themselves <HI>swallow a camel,</HI> they lose all charity and temper with their brother, if he does not <HI>strain at a gnat.</HI> Now, to endeavour to please such persons to their good unto edifying, is to aim at an impossibility. Caprice and contradictory humour can never be pleased, never be edified. Indeed, every attempt to please it, is to increase the disorder, and to strengthen its petulancy.</P>
<P N="8">8. OUR Christian liberty ought to be vindicated and adhered to resolutely, where the giving it up is like to be hurtful to the souls of men, and the interests of reli∣gion, by propagating <HI>idolatry</HI> and <HI>superstition.</HI> And in this case, persons of the greatest note and weight in the church, should be ready to suffer all things, rather than
<PB N="268" REF="014137_0267_0F97D4D0B515BCA8"/>give it up by base compliance. This was <HI>Archbishop Cranmer's</HI> crime. Reformation in religion, and separa∣tion from idolatrous and superstitious communities, can never be accomplished or justified, but on this principle. Upon this foundation is built the <HI>protestant reformation,</HI> and those protestants who still labour to reduce Christi∣anity to its original and native simplicity, act very com∣mendably on this principle, and will ever be had in esteem by the proper judges and true friends of Christi∣an liberty.</P>
<P N="9">9. CHRISTIAN liberty, is in many cases to be given up in compassion to the ignorance and inveterate pre∣judices of others, until this ignorance and these preju∣dices can be removed. The apostolic decree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 22.</NOTE> was made on this account; and the Jewish converts were allowed to have their children circumcised, and to ab∣stain from certain meats, and to observe certain legal ceremonies, until they would be better instructed in the principles of their Christian liberty:—Whereas, the Gentile or Heathen converts were not indulged in these matters, as they had no inveterate prejudices of educa∣tion in their favour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the whole Epistle to the Gai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tians, compared with Acts. xvi. 1,—3.—xxi. 17,—28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="10">10. OUR Christian liberty ought perhaps in many cases to be given up in favour of <HI>incurable weakness,</HI> especially where it is <HI>general.</HI> Suppose a whole neigh∣bourhood of weak of Christians had got it their heads, from the apostolic decree, that it was sinful to eat blood, or things strangled; or, from any other means were persuaded, that it was an unpardonable crime to eat with unwashen hands, or to shave their heads or beards, or any other whimsy; it would perhaps become
<PB N="269" REF="014137_0268_0F97D4D1780E1900"/>the duty of an intelligent Christian, living among them, and who could not reason them out of their superstition, to comform to these customs and usages, lest he might, by his example, induce some of these poor people to act against their consciences, and so to contract guilt. This is that giving up of Christian liberty which is plead for by <HI>St. Paul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. and 1 Cor. viii. and ix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="11">11. BUT if such a community should hold it sinful to marry; or to worship GOD in public assemblies (as the <HI>Familists</HI> and <HI>Brownists</HI>); or to receive the sacraments (as the <HI>Quakers</HI>); or should insist on the necessit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of do∣ing something <HI>forbidden by</HI> GOD, or of omitti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> some∣thing commanded by him; in these cases we ought not to comply, but insist on our Christian liberty.</P>
<P N="12">12. MANY things which are simply lawful in them∣selves, yet because of the abuses made of them, ought to be shunned and denied by Christians. There can be no moral evil in often visiting a tavern, or a house of in∣famous report, supposing there is no ill design, or ill practice; nay, perhaps, it may be done with the best views and from the best motives: Yet, because of the scandal that might attend this practice, it might be best to refrain it. I know not whether <HI>card-playing</HI> and <HI>dancing</HI> may not be perfectly innocent in themselves; yet if these practices are generally abused, it were best to discountenance and refrain them.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE general rule seems to be this, that where-ever the use of our Christian liberty, has a direct ten∣dency to hurt the souls of others (unless in some capi∣tal point where it ought not, and cannot with safety be given up) it is best to forego it and recede from it; for, our neighbour's good and edification is a charity we owe him. But, as all things may be abused to evil
<PB N="270" REF="014137_0269_0F97D4D235F5A8E0"/>purposes, so may the lawful use of our Christian liber∣ty. And after all, <HI>prudence</HI> and <HI>discretion</HI> must be the um∣pires in this matter.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LVII. <HI>What</HI> DIVERSIONS <HI>are lawful, and the</HI> WAY <HI>to regulate them.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE best moralists have condemned some fa∣shionable diversions, as unlawful in them∣selves. Such are games of <HI>hazard,</HI> and success in which depends in a great measure on <HI>lottery,</HI> such as <HI>cards, dice,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF there are any other diversions which are either directly sinful in themselves, or lead unavoidably to the corruption of manners, these are wholly out of the que∣stion at present, as being in themselves unlawful, and therefore forbidden to Christians; such as rioting and drunkenness, chambering and wantonness, impure dalli∣ances, lasciviousness, effeminacy, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. OF <HI>lawful diversions,</HI> some are calculated to exer∣cise the body, and those are best suited to sedentary per∣sons, whose callings afford them too little exercise for the purposes of health; such as <HI>running, walking, leaping, fencing,</HI> and all those plays or diversions which give mo∣tion and exercise to the body, and tend to circulate the blood, and promote digestion and perspiration. Others are calculated to recreate and unbend the mind, such are <HI>chess,</HI> and a number of others; and these seem best adapted for those who live an active, laborious, fatiguing life.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="271" REF="014137_0270_0F97D4D33848E7B0"/>
4. THE very words, <HI>diversions</HI> and <HI>amusements,</HI> point out the use and design of these pastimes. They are only intended to unbend the mind, and refresh the bo∣dy and animal spirits, that those who use them may be the better fitted and qualified to discharge the serious, necessary and important businesses of life; the care of the soul and of the body.</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM this notion of <HI>diversions, amusements</HI> or <HI>recrea∣tions,</HI> we may learn many important lessons about the right choice, use and regulation of them. As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IT is evident, that a life spent in a continual, or almost perpetual round of diversions, must be a <HI>wicked, ill spent</HI> life. This is wholly to misemploy life, and ne∣glect the proper business of it; and that too, under the wicked notion, that it is innocent, proper and beneficial to do so.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IF diversion or amusement may be properly considered as the <HI>physic of life,</HI> by which the disorders of the body and mind, contracted by an intense application to the serious and proper business of it, are relieved and cured, and their vigour, sprightliness and activity restor∣ed, for a fresh application: Then, to spend one's life in a perpetual round of diversions, is as absurd and prepo∣sterous, as though a person, neglecting all food, should live wholly upon physic, under a pretence of preserving his health and vigour.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) IF habits are contracted by repeated act; then a life spent in giddy diversions and amusements, must in course of time so relax and effeminate both the body and mind, as to render them wholly unfit for any ap∣plication to the serious and important businesses of life; must beget an inveterate habit of the worst kind of idleness; and, in sine, must turn persons, thus devoted to diversions, into meer <HI>whirligigs</HI> and <HI>useless drones,</HI> bur∣dens and nuisances to society. A life of perpetual di∣version,
<PB N="272" REF="014137_0271_0F97D4D50E4A5B10"/>version, is a life of perpetual intoxication; and persons devoted to it, are generally the most useless and mischie∣vous members of society. Witness perpetual dancers and gamesters.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) WHEN diversions are turned into the constant business of life, they wholly change their nature, and lose their good effects; they are so far from unbending the mind, that they become its only burden; they are so far from recreating and refreshing the body, that they fatigue it, and exhaust the animal spirits; they are so far from rendering the body vigorous, and the mind chearful, that they injure the health and sink the spirits. This is, with a witness, to make a toil of a pleasure; and to turn that cordial drop, which makes life's bitter draught go glibly down, into a <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>deleterious poi∣son.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) IF the proper design of diversions is, by refresh∣ing the body and recreating the mind, to render both more lively and vigorous, and thereby fit them for a more vigorous application to the proper, necessary and important duties of life; then all such diversions and amusements as evidently tend to hurt the body or the mind, and obstruct the proper end of diversions, must needs be unlawful and sinful: And the same will hold true of lawful and innocent diversions continued too long at a time. Although <HI>gaming</HI> were innocent in it∣self, yet it were extremely unlawful to spend whole weeks, night and day, in that diversion, to the breaking of natural rest, and thereby hurting both the body and mind, and to the neglect of all duties, civil, social and religious. Although <HI>dancing</HI> may be innocent in itself, yet to spend whole nights in that exercise, to the fa∣tiguing of the body, neglecting all the duties of the fa∣mily and closet, and unfitting persons for the proper bu∣siness of the next day, is certainly criminal and unlaw∣ful.—For
<PB N="273" REF="014137_0272_0F97D4D535295448"/>a poor man, whose family calls for all his time and labour to clothe and feed them, to spend <HI>one day,</HI> much more, <HI>several days</HI> in diversions, is a sin against <HI>justice, charity</HI> and <HI>mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. DIVERSIONS which may be innocent and lawful to <HI>some,</HI> and in <HI>certain circumstances,</HI> may be yet unlawful to <HI>others,</HI> and in certain <HI>different circumstances.</HI> As, (1.) It may not be absolutely unlawful in a Christian, to amuse himself by playing an <HI>innocent game,</HI> or play∣ing on a <HI>musical instrument,</HI> or <HI>walking,</HI> or <HI>riding,</HI> or, per∣haps dancing;—yet to mix with <HI>swearing, drinking,</HI> or <HI>profane</HI> company for the sake of partaking in these amusements, as it would be extremely <HI>indecent,</HI> so it would also be very <HI>criminal;</HI> as it would shew, that this <HI>love of pleasure</HI> was superior to his <HI>aversion to vice</HI> and <HI>evil example;</HI>—and as his example in this particular instance, would look like a giving a sanction to the vices of his company.—(2.) To persons who find, that by any particular diversions and amusements, they are strongly tempted to sin; such <HI>diversions</HI> or <HI>amusements</HI> must needs be extremely sinful;—Thus, supposing <HI>dancing</HI> and <HI>gam∣ing</HI> to be <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>inoffensive</HI> in themselves, yet to per∣sons who, by the one, are tempted to <HI>fret, swear</HI> and <HI>cheat;</HI> or who, by the other, are tempted to <HI>other sins,</HI> these diversions must be <HI>highly criminal.</HI>—(3.) Where any particular diversion, though innocent in itself, is greatly abused in a place, and madly pursued by the inhabitants, to the prejudice of <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>good morals;</HI> Christians ought not only to <HI>ahstain from,</HI> but also <HI>bear a testimony against</HI> such diversions, so abused, for the good of society.—(4.) Diversions which may be inno∣cent in themselves, may change their nature and become exceeding criminal, either by being <HI>mistimed,</HI> or <HI>too long continued.</HI> For instance, to indulge to amusements on the <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> or in a time of <HI>public distress</HI> or <HI>calamity</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="014137_0273_0F97D4D5F42F8710"/>which calls for consideration, mourning, prayer and re∣pentance;—or, indulge to diversions and amusements, when <HI>justice, charity</HI> and <HI>mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> call us to <HI>other</HI> and <HI>more important</HI> business, is doubtless <HI>very sinful.</HI> Or when, (as was observed above) we squander much of our precious time in trifling amusements, and make them the <HI>business of life;</HI> this is to act the part of the <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>unprofit∣able servant,</HI> who was justly condemned to outer dark∣ness.</P>
<P N="7">7. A LIFE spent in giddy diversions, is utterly incom∣patible with the hopes of salvation; being inconsistent with a <HI>due</HI> and <HI>serious concern</HI> either for the <HI>soul</HI> or the <HI>bo∣dy;</HI> for ourselves, or for others.</P>
<P N="8">8. IT might be a good touch-stone for such diver∣sions as are <HI>suitable</HI> and <HI>becoming</HI> for Christians; to try within ourselves whether we could seriously ask GOD'S blessing upon them; or quit them at an instant, and address ourselves to GOD in solemn prayer: For, as it is our duty always to watch and pray, lest we enter into temptation, and to be ever in a posture of readiness to meet the summons of death in the way of our duty; and as we know not the moment we may be called to give an account of our stewardship, all diversions inconsis∣tent with this frame of mind, seem improper for Chris∣tians.</P>
<P N="9">9. TO render diversions or amusements <HI>lawful,</HI> they must have these properties:—(1.) They must be <HI>inno∣cent</HI> in themselves:—(2.) They must be <HI>decent</HI> and of <HI>good repute,</HI> or such as the generality of good people have not condemned (and this will cut off <HI>card-playing,</HI> and almost all <HI>games of hazard,</HI> more especially <HI>all gaming for money,</HI> from the list of innocent diversions):—(3.) They ought to be such as are not of pernicious conse∣quence, by the bad regulation and abuse of them in the places where we live:—(4.) No more of our pre∣cious
<PB N="275" REF="014137_0274_0F97D4D6B403DF48"/>time should be consumed by them, than is barely necessary for the purpose of recreation; nor should they be oftener used than is needful, lest the mind be intoxi∣cated by them, and led off from more important mat∣ters, by contracting a habit of trifling and levity:— (5.) They should be such as we find by experience are not attended with strong temptations to ourselves, and as have no sensible tendency to draw off our minds from the duties of religion, or from the necessary and important duties of life. Upon the whole, they should be such, and so used and regulated as not to excite any remorse of conscience in a sensible, serious and tender mind.</P>
<P N="10">10. THOUGH it does not seem reasonable, or consis∣tent with the present frail and imperfect state of hu∣man nature, to forbid all kinds of worldly amusements and recreations, as <HI>unlawful,</HI> yet to persons of a right way of thinking, and of a spiritual and refined taste; these kinds of diversions will he found <HI>very little necessary;</HI> and the very duties of religion, such as <HI>reading, singing of psalms</HI> with melody in the heart, <HI>meditation</HI> and <HI>contem∣plation</HI> on the works and ways of GOD, <HI>religius conference,</HI> and <HI>doing good offices</HI> to the souls and bodies of men, will furnish pleasures and delights, far preferable to any that can result from worldly pleasures and amuse∣ments.</P>
<P N="11">11. IN short, the fashionable diversions are attended with so many snares and dangers to virtue and innocence, and, at the best, are such <HI>thieves of precious time,</HI> that those discover the <HI>soundest judgment</HI> who have the least taste and fondness for them, and who least frequent and join in them.</P>
<P N="12">12. RELIGION promises the <HI>highest</HI> and <HI>noblest comforts and pleasures,</HI> and those who betray too fond a desire for worldly pleasures and diversions, either prove that
<PB N="276" REF="014137_0275_0F97D4D773DC5E00"/>they have never experienced the pleasures of religion, or, by their conduct, persuade the world, that the others are <HI>equally necessary</HI> and <HI>agreeable.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. THE <HI>devil,</HI> by a surprizing dexterity, has turned some of the most solemn periods of life, into seasons devoted to the madest riot and giddy diversion; witness our <HI>birth-days,</HI> and the <HI>first day of every New Year.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LVIII. <HI>The</HI> VALUE <HI>and</HI> IMPORTANCE <HI>of a</HI> CHILD.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IMMORTALITY has stamped an amazing value on man. No conscious being, who is ca∣pable of eternal happiness or misery, can possibly be <HI>un∣important</HI> or <HI>of little account.</HI> Man, who carries about with him a <HI>rational, undying</HI> soul, little knows or consi∣ders of what a treasure he is possessed. All the beau∣ties, all the riches, all the stupendous wonders of ma∣terial nature are, in comparison with it, less than no∣thing, and vanity! If man considered this, would it not be more his endeavour to act up to the dignity of his nature? Would he not be ashamed of <HI>base, mean</HI> and <HI>ignoble</HI> actions, which vilify and debase his real im∣portance, and degrade him below his rank in the uni∣verse?</P>
<P N="2">2. THE moment in which a rational, immortal spirit animates a human <HI>foetus,</HI> a spark is kindled which shall never be extinguished. The material sun will grow old, wax dim with years, and be probably put out as a lamp that burneth; the stars shall fall from their orbits, and
<PB N="277" REF="014137_0276_0F97D4D833C3FFB8"/>be covered with darkness; but this breath of the Al∣mighty, this intellectual spark once kindled up in the moral world, shall burn on with undiminished and ever-increasing lustre, as long as GOD himself endures.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE birth of a child we deem to be but a trifling event, and look with <HI>indifference,</HI> perhaps with <HI>contempt,</HI> on the little, helpless stranger. But if we viewed it with the penetrating eye of reason; if we considered it as emerging from eternal night into life immortal;—as an heir of worlds unknown, and a candidate for an ever∣lasting state;—as a glimmering spark of being, just struck from nothing by the all-creating rock, which must burn and flame on to eternity, when suns and stars have returned to their native darkness or non-entity;— which must survive the funeral of nature, and live through the rounds of endless ages; which must either rise from glory to glory, ascending perfection's scale by endless gradations, or sink deeper and deeper into the bottom less abyss of misery, and to which its immortali∣ty must either prove an <HI>unsufferable curse,</HI>—or a <HI>blessing in∣conceivable,</HI> according to the manner in which it shall have acquitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>self in its present probationary state— we shall clearly discern, that the value and importance of a human infant can scarcely be computed.</P>
<P N="4">4. To illustrate this thought, let us briefly consider, <HI>The evil</HI> or <HI>good</HI> which may be either <HI>done</HI> or <HI>received</HI> by a child, in the course of its existence. And,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) PERHAPS this child is an <HI>embrio-fiend.</HI> Knowest thou, O man, O parent, to what this child is born? Of what this child is capable? It is now a pitiable, helpless infant, but if thou knewest the enormous sins and dreadful sufferings with which its future existence is pregnant, and most of them probably through thy own sinful example and guilty neglect, thou wouldst be so far from rejoicing at its birth, that thou wouldst weep
<PB N="278" REF="014137_0277_0F97D4D8F6053558"/>and lament for the miseries which are coming upon it, and upon thyself for thy neglect of the duties which thou owest it. Perhaps thou hast never prayed that GOD might sanctify this child while in the womb. It has been indeed baptized; but hast thou ever offered up one fervent prayer for it since it has been born? Hast thou offered it up to the holy Trinity by faith, and with that solemnity which the baptismal dedication requires? Instead of setting before it a pious and virtu∣ous example, teaching it to pray, inspiring it with a horror against vice, instilling into its tender opening mind, the principles of piety and good morals, correct∣ing its errors, and restraining its passions and appetites, hast thou not set before it the very worst example— taught it the language of blasphemy and profanity, fostered every malignant passion, and cherishing every budding vice in its soul? And what is the consequence? It grows up a monster of wickedness, a <HI>devil incarnate.</HI> It spreads the baneful contagion of vice as far as its in∣fluence can reach; becomes the <HI>tempter,</HI> the <HI>devil</HI> of every company; the spoiler and obstructer of all good! How many of its fellow-immortals has it drawn into guilt and misery? Perhaps it at len<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th becomes infa∣mous for wickedness, and blots the annals of history with a character disgraceful to human nature, and with crimes before <HI>unparalelled, unheard of!</HI> And O who can describe the miseries which await it in a state of retribu∣tion? The <HI>Neros,</HI> the <HI>Herods,</HI> the <HI>tyrants,</HI> the <HI>scourges</HI> of the earth, were once helpless infants!</P>
<P N="2">(2.) PERHAPS this child is an <HI>embrio-angel.</HI> Knowest thou, O man, O parent, to what this child is born, of what this child is capable? It has been the child of thy prayers and vows. Thou hast solemnly given it up to GOD in baptism, and he has graciously accepted the surrender. It is thy constant solicitous care to recom∣mend
<PB N="279" REF="014137_0278_0F97D4D9B384CC08"/>it daily to the guidance and protection of its Fa∣ther in heaven; to set a blameless, pious and virtuous example before it; to instil into its tender opening mind the principles of piety, integrity and universal goodness. Indulgent heaven smiles on thine endeavours and renders them successful by the concurring aids of omnipotent grace, The seed of knowledge and of grace so liberally sown, will presently grow up into a plenteous harvest of usefulness here and glory hereafter. The child, like the holy child JESUS, will grow up in knowledge, as in stature, and in favour both with GOD and <HI>man.</HI> The implanted principle of grace, shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iv. 14.</NOTE>. He shall bring forth much fruit to the glory of GOD, and to the good of his fellow mortals. Every day will bring him some good, or make him the instrument of some good to his fellow men. Nor shall his progress in holiness and happiness be terminated by this mortal life, but probably go on through eternal ages. In a word, who can conceive the good of which such a child may be made the instrument, or the degrees of happiness and of glory to which it may be advanced? St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and all those worthies under the <HI>Patriarchal, Mosaical</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> dispensations, who wrought so much good in the world, and who now shine in such superior orbs of glory, were once <HI>feeble, despised infants!</HI> May I speak it with propriety on this occasion, The blessed JESUS was once a child!</P>
<P N="5">5. SINCE <HI>such</HI> therefore, is the <HI>amazing importance</HI> of a child, why should we wonder, that JESUS took up such in his arms and blessed them, declaring, that of such was the kingdom of heaven? Why should we wonder, that their guardian angels continually behold the face of our Father in heaven? Why should we won∣der, that such a stress is laid on their education in the
<PB N="280" REF="014137_0279_0F97D4DA73E1F3B0"/>holy scriptures, and that our risen ascending Lord should have given it so particularly in charge to his Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> to be peculiarly attentive to this, as one of the highest proofs of his love to him: <HI>Simon Peter lovest thou me? Feed my lambs</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 10. Mark x. 16. John xxi. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. IF <HI>such</HI> is the <HI>value</HI> and <HI>importance</HI> of children, can <HI>parents,</HI> can <HI>masters,</HI> can the <HI>clergy</HI> ever be sufficiently attentive to the unspeakable important business of their religious education?</P>
<P N="7">7. PARENTS, more especially, are obliged to this duty by a number of the weightiest motives and consi∣derations. (1.) They have been the immediate instru∣ments of bringing their children into a tempting, in∣snaring world, and have transmitted to them an heredi∣tary taint of corruption, the seed of guilt and of mi∣sery. (2.) Providence has so ordered it, that children are long continued in a helpless state under the care of their parents, that they may have a sufficient time and opportunity to form them for usefulness in this life, and glory in that which is to come; and has implanted a strong <HI>storge</HI> or <HI>natural affection</HI> in their hearts towards their children, which should powerfully prompt them to this duty. (3.) Their own comfort and the good of human society, should also powerfully inclin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parents to cultivate the minds and hearts of their children with the greatest assiduity.</P>
<P N="8">8. THREE things seem of prime importance in the education of children, <HI>instruction, government</HI> and <HI>ex∣ample.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) INSTRUCTION should be begun as soon as chil∣dren are capable of receiving it, which is generally very early in life. The plainest and most practical truths should first be instilled into the tender minds of children, and that in the plainest and most familiar manner, with
<PB N="281" REF="014137_0280_0F97D4DC4B1FAFD0"/>such a <HI>seriousness</HI> and <HI>solemnity</HI> as is not forbidding and dis∣gusting, but which may rather convey <HI>pleasure</HI> and <HI>amuse∣ment</HI> to the mind. And parents ought to improve their own understandings, that they may be better qua∣lified properly to instruct their children; which is no easy task to the wisest.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IN the article of government, parents should at∣tentively study the tempers and dispositions of their children; as upon some ingenious tempers, gentle re∣proofs will have a better effect than stripes, and with others it is absolutely necessary to use <HI>severe reproof,</HI> and the <HI>rod of correction.</HI> In government, it is best to begin with mildness in all children, as correction is a duty which is managed well with great difficulty: When correction is found necessary, it should not be inflicted <HI>rashly,</HI> without duly weighing the <HI>nature</HI> of the crime and its true <HI>demerit.</HI> The greatest severity in punishing should be for <HI>immoralities; indiscretions</HI> should be passed over with a light correction. A child should never be punished for <HI>dullness</HI> or other <HI>natural infirmities.</HI> In cor∣recting no signs of <HI>revenge</HI> or <HI>violent passion</HI> should ever appear, but the child who is corrected should be made sensible, that it is done with reluctance, and purely for its own good; and much care should be taken, to give it a deep conviction of the evil of the crime, for which it is chastised.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) ALL the instructions and corrections of parents will avail nothing, but rather make matters worse, if their <HI>examples</HI> are <HI>vicious</HI> and <HI>immoral.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LIX. THE CONSTRAINTS OF CHRIST'S LOVE; A SERMON FROM 2 CORINTHIANS V. 13, 14.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to <HI>GOD:</HI> Or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. For the love of <HI>CHRIST</HI> constraineth us.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems evident by the whole tenor of this epistle, that the holy and zealous Apostle had not a few enemies in the church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and those too such as he might least of all have expected—his fellow profes∣sors and fellow-teachers of christianity. These vain∣glorious teachers, instead of building upon the Apostle's foundation, and supporting and confirming his authori∣ty over his beloved converts, endeavoured by every trick of artifice and calumny to overturn and subvert it. They represented him to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> as mean and contemptible, as light and inconstant, as proud, over∣bearing and imperious, as a subverter of the law, yea, as a downright <HI>mad-men.</HI> They put a bad construction on all his words and actions, preferred themselves be∣fore
<PB N="283" REF="014137_0282_0F97D4DD8AA9F330"/>him, and endeavoured by every art to raise their own credit on the ruins of his apostolical authority and reputation.</P>
<P>SUCH treatment as this could not but greatly affect the good Apostle. not only as it tended to cool and weaken the affections of his beloved Corinthian con∣verts towards him; but more especially, as it was like∣ly to prejudice their minds against the important doc∣trines of the gospel which he had, with great labour, zeal and sincerity, preached amongst them. And hence it is, that we find so great a part of this epistle employ∣ed in <HI>St. Paul's</HI> vindication of his own character and conduct, as an Apostle of CHRIST;—in reclaiming the <HI>Corinthian</HI> church from an undue attachment to these Judaizing teachers,—and in rekindling proper regards to those distinguishing and unadulterated doctrines of the gospel, which he had, in the course of his ministry, propagated amongst them.</P>
<P>As that peculiar <HI>fervency</HI> and <HI>ardour</HI> with which this elo∣quent Apostle of the Gentiles prosecuted the gospel mi∣nistry, seems to be one of the great quarrels which his enemies had against him, he makes a noble and spirit∣ed apology to the Corinthians for his conduct in this respect, from the 10th verse to the end of the chapter; alledging the <HI>grandeur</HI> and <HI>importance</HI> of the doctrines which the gospel reveals, as a sufficient reason for the greatest possible zeal and importunity of address.</P>
<P>AT the <HI>tenth verse</HI> he had laid down the certainty of a future judgment, in which all men must appear be∣fore the tribunal of CHRIST, to receive, every one, ac∣cording to the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. And this he alledges as one powerful reason and motive of zeal and fervor in the gospel ministry: <HI>Know∣ing therefore,</HI> says he, <HI>the terrors of the</HI> LORD, <HI>we persuade men;</HI> that is, being firmly assured of a strict and im∣partial
<PB N="284" REF="014137_0283_0F97D4DE33B7A3A8"/>judgment, and its awful consequences—of that eternal and irreversible sentence of condemnation which shall then pass upon all finally unbelieving sinners, and which shall fill their souls with unspeakable terror and endless despair, we use every argument and every art of address to persuade men;—to <HI>urge,</HI> and, if possible, to <HI>engage,</HI> them to escape the terrors of that day, by a timous application to CHRIST, and a sincere repen∣tance.</P>
<P>AND as some of these enemies, had probably unjustly charged him with a vain-glorious applauding, or com∣mending of himself in his former epistle, he wipes off this assertion by telling them, that what he had been obliged to say of this kind, was only in his own necessary defence, and to furnish his friends with a suitable an∣swer to his censorious and hypocritical enemies: For, says he, <Q>We commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart;</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> who seem out∣wardly to glory and triumph over us, although inward∣ly they are <HI>self-condemned,</HI> and are conscious, that they have no reason to glory against us.</P>
<P>IN the words of our text the Apostle still continues to vindicate himself, and suggests a <HI>farther</HI> and <HI>still more powerful</HI> motive of his zeal and earnestness in the work of the ministry: For, says he, <Q>whether we be beside ourselves, it is to GOD: Or whether we be sober, it is for your cause; for the love of CHRIST constraineth us.</Q> As though he had said; <Q>If, to <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>indif∣ferent</HI> spectators, who are not actuated by the same motives, and have not the same view and sense of di∣vine things as we the Apostles have, we should seem to speak and act with a degree of zeal bordering upon frenzy or enthusiasm, and to be transported beyond
<PB N="285" REF="014137_0284_0F97D4DEF69C4920"/>our <HI>natural selves</HI>—beyond the cold measures of hu∣man prudence or discretion—it is a <HI>zeal for the glory of</HI> GOD which animates us and produces these <HI>extraordi∣nary effects:</HI>—Or if, on the other hand, we be <HI>sober,</HI> and prosecute all the arts of calm and dispassion are reasoning to convince sinners, and lead them to GOD through CHRIST, it is <HI>for your sakes</HI> we take such serious pains, in a matter which so nearly concerns your high∣est interests. So, that <HI>love</HI> to GOD, and <HI>bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olence to men,</HI> are the two grand principles by which we are ac∣tuated, and well may we be zealous in so good a cause; <HI>for the love of</HI> CHRIST <HI>constraineth us</HI>—That un∣paralelled love of his, manifested in the redemption of a guilty world;—that love which engaged him to die for a lost and dead world; a world of creatures who were dead in trespasses and sins; void of spiri∣tual life, and under the condemnatory sentence of a broken law: This wonderful love of CHRIST (as well as the certain prospect of a future, impartial judgment) <HI>constraineth us</HI>—It <HI>beareth us away</HI> as with a <HI>stro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g</HI> and <HI>resistless</HI> torrent, so that we cannot resist or withstand that impetuosity, with which it carries us on to the most active and zealous discharge of our ministerial duty.</Q></P>
<P>THE Greek word <HI>sunechei,</HI> which we render <HI>constrain∣eth,</HI> is vastly emphatical. Sometimes it signifies to <HI>throng</HI> and <HI>press</HI> on every side, as with a croud<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke viii. 45.</NOTE> some∣times, to <HI>hold fast</HI> or <HI>have in possession,</HI> as a prisoner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 63.</NOTE>; sometimes, to <HI>surround,</HI> or <HI>invest a town by siege,</HI> to pre∣vent the enemy's escape<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 43.</NOTE>; sometimes, to be <HI>in a strait</HI> between two contrary opinions, or to have the mind in an anxious state of hesitancy or suspence between two
<PB N="286" REF="014137_0285_0F97D4DFB4F5C8F8"/>opposite resolutions or determinations<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>; and sometimes it signifies to be strongly <HI>urged</HI> or <HI>pressed in spirit,</HI> under a kind of <HI>irresistable impulse of mind,</HI> which forcibly urges one on to the revelation of some mystery, or the decla∣ration of some truth; as it is said, Acts xviii. 5. That <HI>Paul (suneicheto to pneumati)</HI> <Q>being pressed in spirit, tes∣tified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</Q> And it seems to have much this last sense in our text: <Q>The love of Christ constraineth us,</Q>—it irresi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ably moves, impels, and bears us on to zeal and importunity in the sacred duties of our Apostleship, so that we can by no means disengage ourselves from the binding nature and urgency of those motives and obligations it lays us un∣der. <Q>For, as though he had said, how can we be cold and unaffected in promoting the salvation of sin∣ners; a cause in which our glorious Master not only <HI>laboured</HI> and <HI>suffered,</HI> but even <HI>laid down his life:</HI></Q> Or, <Q>We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again.</Q> Therefore, this dying love of Christ constraineth us to be <HI>instant</HI> and <HI>importunate</HI> with sinners, not only to ac∣cept the precious benefits it has purchased for them, but also to walk worthy of the glorious privileges and hopes it has conferred upon them.</P>
<P>Now, that we may the better perceive the <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>force</HI> of the Apostle's reasoning, and feel the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>constraint</HI> of a Saviour's love, I shall, in the <HI>first</HI> place, by divine assistance, briefly shew you the <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>specific</HI> nature of the love of CHRIST, and by what characters it is distinguished from, and exalted above the love of mortals. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Explain it by its effects,
<PB N="287" REF="014137_0286_0F97D4E0738F9D90"/>or shew in what instances it most eminently appears and is expressed. And <HI>thirdly,</HI> Apply the doctrine to some practical uses, by shewing what influence it should have upon us, both as <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>people.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to shew you the peculiar and specific nature of this love of CHRIST, and by what properties it is chiefly distinguished from, and exalted above the love of mortals. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE will find, on the smallest reflection, that <HI>love</HI> is a certain mode or affection of the mind, drawing it forth with desire and complacency towards some ob∣ject; and, including in it (according to the scripture no∣tion of it, and as it is exercised from GOD to man) <HI>compassion, benevolence</HI> and <HI>bounty.</HI></P>
<P>LOVE, as it exists in us, besides its imperfection, has generally a great mixture of <HI>selfishness.</HI> <Q>We are sensi∣ble of a penury and want in our own beings.</Q> We feel a dependance not only upon GOD, but also in some measure on our <HI>fellow-creatures,</HI> both for <HI>being</HI> and <HI>well-being.</HI> Our happiness in the present state, is neither complete, nor independent, and therefore we <Q>seek some augmentation of it, and some addition to it, by union with the objects we love.</Q> If we closely and impartially examine the frame of our own nature, and the motives of our actions, we will find, that perhaps the most pure and disinterested acts of our love, bene∣volence and charity, are mixed with some degree of selfishness.—Let even a wicked person, who has any re∣mains of natural tenderness and humanity left in his breast, see a man who is an object of great pity and compassion, his heart will melt towards him,—he will <HI>feel</HI> for his distress, and, if possible, give him some succour or relief;—not perhaps from any hope of reward in this
<PB N="288" REF="014137_0287_0F97D4E13470A6F0"/>life, nor merely out of ostentation, <HI>that he may be seen and praised of men;</HI>—not out of any love to GOD, or obedi∣ence to his command, nor from any prospect of a future reward—(the supposition excludes all such motives); but <HI>purely</HI> to relieve the anxious and sympathetic feelings of his own breast. He relieves the miserable, that he himself may be less miserable. He endeavours to mi∣tigate the pain of his suffering and distressed fellow-crea∣ture, that he himself may be less pained and distressed. And although good and truly virtuous and gracious men may have <HI>nobler</HI> and <HI>purer</HI> motives of their charity, yet it is much to be questioned, whether something of self-interest may not mix itself with their most disinte∣rested actions.</P>
<P>I AM far, indeed, from condemning this natural sym∣pathy and compassion, so deeply implanted in the hu∣man heart, by the GOD <HI>of nature,</HI> for the succour and relief of our fellow-men. I only mention this in proof of what I have advanced, namely, <Q>That human love or charity, in the purest instances of it, is not perhaps wholly disinterested: Either <HI>glory,</HI> or <HI>fame,</HI> or <HI>pleasure,</HI> or <HI>profit,</HI> or <HI>commodity,</HI> or some <HI>interested selfish</HI> motive or obligation so mix themselves with the most <HI>generous heroic</HI> acts of our love and charity, as to blast their pretensions to <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>disinterestedness,</HI> and greatly to impair their merit.</Q></P>
<P>BUT now <Q>the love of CHRIST is not this way excit∣ed. We had neither done any thing to <HI>oblige</HI> him, nor had we any thing to <HI>engage</HI> him, farther than the misery in which he saw us involved might <HI>move</HI> him.</Q> He loved us <HI>only</HI> because he <HI>would</HI> love us. He had no <HI>by-end,</HI> no <HI>self-interest</HI> to serve in loving us and having compassion upon us. <HI>Herein is love</HI>—a peculiar and dis∣tinguishing love—<HI>not that we loved him, but that he loved us;</HI> which is equally true of the Father and of the Son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="289" REF="014137_0288_0F97D4E1F45F93D8"/>
2. THIS love of CHRIST, as it is a <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>disinterest∣ed,</HI> so it is <Q>a <HI>free, generous</HI> and <HI>heroic</HI> love; like that of some great and public benefactor, who touched with commiseration for the afflictions and distresses of mankind, undertakes their relief. <HI>When we were without strength, ungodly sinners, enemies,</HI> says the Apostle, CHRIST <HI>died for us</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6, 8, 10.</NOTE>.</Q> Either of these three last characters might, in the estimate of human reason, have frustrated the kind intentions of a Saviour's love: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o! it triumhps over them all. It is a <HI>singular, irre∣sistable, unconquerable, triumphant</HI> love;—a love, as the wise man describes that passion, <HI>stronger than death; many waters,</HI> numberless provocations and indignities, <HI>could not quench it</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. viii. 6.</NOTE>. Many and great obstacles stood in its way, the wrath of GOD, the cruelty of men, the rage of devils, the shame and pain of the cross, and, what was worse than all, the ingratitude and obstinacy of those very sinners who where the objects of this love, and their contempt of and aversion to its saving designs— and vet it surmounted them all! Are mankind <HI>un∣godly, sinners, enemies?</HI> Yet CHRIST will love them and die for them! O wonderful philanthropy! Surely no in∣stance of human love can equal this. We have heard of and applauded brave and generous men, who have hazarded and exposed their lives for their friends, their country, their religion;—yea, we have heard, <Q>per∣haps in the single instance of <HI>Damon</HI> and <HI>Pythias,</HI> of one friend's offering to lay down his life for another. And indeed, as our Saviour observes, <HI>greater love has</HI> no man <HI>than this, that he lay down his life for his friends;</HI> this being the very utmost extent of <HI>human friendship</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John xv. 13.</NOTE>: But greater love <HI>hath</HI> CHRIST, who laid down his life for his enemies!</Q></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="290" REF="014137_0289_0F97D3DCF7D63468"/>
3. YEA, so great and unparalelled is this love of CHRIST to sinners, that it surmounts all human thought and comprehension. The Apostle urges his beloved <HI>Ephesians</HI> to <HI>comprehend with all saints, the breath, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which,</HI> adds he, <HI>passeth knowledge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. iii. 18, 19.</NOTE>. The breadth, and length, and depth, and height of this love are beyond our <HI>ken</HI> in the present state; and indeed, we shall, perhaps, ne∣ver be able <HI>fully</HI> to comprehend them. In order to know the just dimensions of a Saviour's love, we must first know the full dignity of his person, the greatness of his condescension, and the depth of his sufferings; and these, perhaps, no created understanding will ever be able fully to comprehend. What a strange com∣mand or requisition, therefore, is this?—to know and comprehend a love, which is <HI>incomprehensible</HI> and <HI>passeth knowledge!</HI>—I answer, this is a lively expression of the dis∣tinguishing greatness of CHRIST'S love, in the Apostle's <HI>grand</HI> and <HI>masterly</HI> manner. The love of CHRIST is a subject which all the saints search and pry into with the greatest attention and delight. They endeavour to comprehend it more and more: <Q>something they know; more they desire to know; they stoop down with the angels, <HI>and desire to look into these things</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 12.</NOTE>.</Q> They are daily making new discoveries and new researches into the wonders of his love which passeth knowledge, and which will prove the continual exercise and the increas∣ing joy and admiration of their perfected spirits, through the ages of eternity,—when they shall join in that new and perpetual song, <Q>Worthy is the lamb, that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory and blessing:—for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to GOD, by thy blood, of out every kindred, and tongue, and people and
<PB N="291" REF="014137_0290_0F97D3D034253A58"/>nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 9,—12.</NOTE>.</Q>—Now, the Apostle prays for these <HI>Ephe∣sians,</HI> that the <HI>same mind</HI> might be in them, and that with all saints, they might study more and more to comprehend the boundless and amazing dimensions of the love of CHRIST, as being the most powerful mo∣tive to reciprocal love, and cheerful universal obedi∣ence.</P>
<P>BY such characters then is this love of CHRIST dis∣tinguished from, and exalted above, the love of mortals. It is <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>disinterested</HI>—<HI>free, generous,</HI> and <HI>heroic</HI>—and exceeds all human comprehension. I proceed.</P>
<P N="2">II. To explain this love of CHRIST by its effects; or to shew in what instances it most eminently appears and is expressed. And here the field is so exceeding large, that I must of necessity, be very brief and general. Were an angel, with all his heavenly knowledge and eloquence, to attempt a display of the grand proofs and effects of his love, how infinitely must he come short of doing justice to the subject? How much more <HI>we,</HI> whose views and apprehensions are limited and confin∣ed?—But that we may attempt it in our feeble and im∣perfect manner,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE greatness of our Saviour's love manifests itself in the <HI>readiness</HI> and <HI>cheerfulness</HI> with which he un∣dertook our relief in the covenant of redemption.—Great was the misery into which mankind were fallen. <HI>All were dead,</HI> as the verse below our text assures us. The hu∣man race, as <HI>one man,</HI> had revolted and apostatized from GOD, and were become slaves to <HI>satan</HI> and their own lusts. The whole world of mankind were become guilty before GOD, and were enemies to him by wick∣ed works. This is that <HI>spiritual death,</HI>—that separation of the soul from GOD, the fountain of <HI>spiritual and eternal,</HI>
<PB N="292" REF="014137_0291_0F97D3DDB55A18A8"/>as well as of <HI>natural</HI> life,—that <HI>death in trespasses</HI> and <HI>sins,</HI> mentioned by the Apostle, Ephes. ii. 1.—And the plain and just consequence of this, was a sentence of con∣demnation to <HI>eternal death.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH was the condition of lapsed man when CHRIST undertook for him; proportionably great therefore must that price and work of redemption be, which was necessary to restore the human race to GOD'S forfeited favour, and to their own lost purity, perfection and happiness. GOD'S majesty was offended, and his law transgressed. The former must therefore be <HI>appeased</HI> and the latter <HI>honoured.</HI> For this purpose the Redeemer must assume our nature;—a body must be prepared for him, in which he must not only <HI>obey</HI> and <HI>suffer,</HI> but even <HI>die! All were dead, and he must die for all!</HI> Before he could see his seed;—see the travail of his soul and be satisfied;—before the Father would give him <HI>the Heathen for his inheritance,</HI> and <HI>the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession,</HI> he must <HI>bear our griefs,</HI> and <HI>carry our sorrows;</HI> he must be <HI>wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, and make his soul an offering for sin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. liii. 4, 5, 11. Psal. ii. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS was the hard law of redemption,—<HI>these</HI> the ar∣duous conditions to which our Redeemer must submit! He must assume a body;—he must <HI>suffer</HI> and <HI>obey, bleed</HI> and <HI>die</HI> in the cause! And yet how cheerfully does he undertake it, when there was no other to help or bring deliverance?—<Q>Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire,</Q> says he,—<Q>then said I, lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my GOD: Yea, thy law is writ∣ten within my heart<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xl. 6,—8.</NOTE>.</Q> He well knew the will of his heavenly Father: He perfectly understood the dif∣ficult law of redemption which he had put himself un∣der:
<PB N="293" REF="014137_0292_0F97D3D3F7000460"/>He knew how dearly he must purchase the sal∣vation of sinners. The black and dismal scene of his sufferings was full in his view; and yet he <HI>so loved us</HI> as to submit with delight—rejoicing in the distant pros∣pect of relieving and succouring perishing rebels, on these difficult terms. <HI>Lo, I come,</HI> says the benevolent Redeem∣er —<Q>I delight to do thy will, O my GOD!—He re∣joiced in the habitable parts of the earth, and his delights were with the sons of men of old, even from everlasting<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii. 31.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. How surprizing an instance have we of his love, in his <HI>incarnation,</HI> in consequence of these engagements? <Q>In the fullness of time, GOD sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, that he might redeem them that are under the law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 4.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>The word, (says St. <HI>John</HI>) was made flesh, and dwelt among among us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John i. 14.</NOTE>.</Q> The <HI>Messiah</HI> became IMMA∣NUEL, GOD <HI>with us,</HI> GOD <HI>manifest in the flesh,</HI> clothed with mortality, and <HI>tabernacling</HI> among men!

But, behold! here is greater love, and a lower stoop of condescension! CHRIST, the Lord of angels, before whom the highest orders of these blessed spirits <HI>bow</HI> and <HI>adore</HI> in the most prostrate and submissive forms, has <HI>done this!</HI> He so loved us, <Q>as to make himself of no reputation, to take upon him the form of a ser∣vant, and, being found in fashion as a man, he hum∣bled himself yet farther, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 6.—8.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. IF we confider the peculiar circumstances of his humanity, they will greatly strengthen the argument of his love. He became <HI>an infant!</HI> An infant of <HI>poor, de∣spised</HI> parents! The son of <HI>Mary,</HI> and of <HI>Joseph</HI> the car∣penter! —<Q>Blessed Lord, what grace and condescensi∣on was this—that thou shouldst be <HI>born</HI> for us—and <HI>thus</HI> born—born in such circumstances of <HI>obscurity</HI> and <HI>contempt</HI>—thy chamber of state, a <HI>stable</HI>—thy cradle, a <HI>manger</HI>—thy mother, a <HI>poor despised virgin,</HI> and thy re∣puted father, a <HI>labouring mechanick!</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN like manner, if we trace the various circumstances of our Saviour's life, each of them will serve to illu∣strate the wonders of his love. While on the stage of public action, he still appeared under the same disadvan∣tages as to any characters of worldly splendor or re∣nown, and in circumstances of low abasement; was still <Q>a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, despis∣ed and rejected of men. The son of man had not where to lay his head<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. viii. 20.</NOTE>;</Q> and having no worldly
<PB N="295" REF="014137_0294_0F97D3D4D97833E0"/>estate, consequently he was of <HI>little worth</HI> in he eyes of the world, and had but <HI>few friends</HI> among the children of men. Nor could his spotless reputation escape the keenest reproaches of sinners. The <HI>holy one</HI> and <HI>the just;</HI> he who <HI>did no sin,</HI> and in whose mouth was <HI>found no guile,</HI> who was <HI>holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners,</HI> and of whom this world was not worthy, was calumni∣ated and traduced as a <HI>blasphemer,</HI> a <HI>deceiver,</HI> a <HI>mad-man,</HI> and a <HI>confederate with devils.</HI> Thus did he endure the contradiction of finne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s against himself—<Q>of <HI>sinners,</HI> (O amazing ingratitude!) towards whom he had the kindest intentions, and for whom he was actually do∣ing the kindest things.</Q> <HI>Strange, mysterious</HI> love, that reconciled the SON of GOD to such treatment from his own guilty creatures, and engaged him to bear it with a meekness and resignation, which the rudest injuries could neither conquer nor disturb! But,</P>
<P N="4">4. THE last scene of his sufferings and death, is the most astonishing and incomprehensible instance of his love. Here the scriptures lay the <HI>grand emphasis.</HI> HE <HI>Idied!</HI> He died for ME! He died for ALL! <Q>He bore our sins in his own body, on the tree! He gave himself for US, that he might redeem us to himself, and make us a peculiar people, zealous of good works! To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood;—to him be glory and do∣minion for ever and ever, Amen!</Q> Here <HI>all</HI> is won∣der.

Love written in <HI>tears,</HI> and <HI>groans</HI> and <HI>blood!</HI> The <HI>Son of</HI> GOD <HI>bleeding</HI> and <HI>expiring</HI> for the <HI>sons of men,</HI> that he might raise them to the dignity and happiness of the <HI>sons of</HI> GOD! Could he have purchased our redemption with∣out
<PB N="296" REF="014137_0295_0F97D3E060D48698"/>the pain and shame of the cross, the condescension had not been so exceedingly amazing: But this could not be;—without <HI>shedding of blood</HI> there could be <HI>no re∣mission;</HI>—and therefore, <HI>he died for us</HI>—he humbled him∣self to the lowest degree of abasement, and became obe∣dient unto the death, even the death of the cross, the most cruel and painful, as well as vilifying and abasing death;—even the death of a Roman slave! He took a body, on purpose to be <HI>striped, pierced, wounded, broken</HI>— to <HI>languish, bleed</HI> and <HI>die!</HI>—He became a man, with de∣sign that he should be a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs;—<Q>That GOD should lay upon him the iniquities of us all, and make his soul an offering for sin;—might bruise him and put him to grief<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. liii.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>NOR was there one circumstance of horror wanting in this <HI>amazing tragedy,</HI>—one bitter ingredient missing in this <HI>tremendous cup,</HI> a guilty conscience and total despair excepted. Betrayed by his disciple, relinquished by his friends, insulted by devils, surrounded by the cruel mocks and taunts of his enemies, forsaken of his Fa∣ther, destitute of the supports and consolations of a com∣mon martyr, pierced with nails, transfixed with a spear—he expired between two thieves—the sun hiding his face, the earth trembling, graves opening, rocks rend∣ing, and all nature, as it were, sympathizing with her expiring LORD, and feeling for the pains and indigni∣ties which he endured!—<HI>He died;</HI> and, O, <HI>what a death?</HI> —Let <HI>this death,</HI> therefore, be unto our souls the voucher of his love.—By this let us measure it in its amazing dimensions!—Nor,</P>
<P N="5">5. DID his love terminate with his mortal life on earth: If it had, it had been still incomplete, and we might still have perished in our sins. But as he died for our sins, so he rose again for our justification, and
<PB N="297" REF="014137_0296_0F97D3D574288230"/>ever lives at the Father's right hand, making intercession for his people. Hence the Apostle's triumph: <Q>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of GOD'S elect? It is GOD that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is CHRIST that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of GOD, who also maketh intercession for us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 33, 34.</NOTE>.</Q> As the love of CHRIST engaged him to humble himself <HI>even unto death</HI> for sin∣ners, so it also engaged him to become not only an <HI>advocate</HI> and <HI>intercessor</HI> with GOD the Father in their be∣half, but also, <Q>a Prince and a Saviour, to give repen∣tance and remission of fins<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 31.</NOTE>.</Q> It engaged him, <Q>after he had led captivity captive, to ascend up on high, and to give gists to men, even to the rebel∣lious;</Q>—to send down his Spirit as the <HI>renewer</HI> and <HI>comforter</HI> of his people;—to enter into the holiest as their <HI>fore-runner,</HI> to take possession of the promised inheritance in their name and stead, and prepare mansions of glory in his Father's house for their reception,—and to <Q>give some Apos∣tles; and some Prophets; and some Evange∣lists; and some Pastors and Teachers, for the per∣fecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of CHRIST; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of GOD, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of CHRIST<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ephes. iv. 8,—13.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AND how signal is his grace and love in <HI>applying</HI> the salvation he has purchased, to the souls of men;—in enlightning, converting, guiding, restoring, quickening, and comforthing them? He brings them into his ban∣queting-house, and his banner over them is love; he satisfies their souls as with marrow and with fatness, and
<PB N="298" REF="014137_0297_0F97D3E0B65EE260"/>causes them to eat hidden manna, and to drink living waters of divine consolations. He knows and pities their infirmities, sympathizes with them under their temptations, sufferings and conflicts, and follows them with a constant, tender care. Whom he loveth, he loveth to the end. His affection is not <HI>wavering, fickle</HI> and <HI>inconstant,</HI> but <HI>firm</HI> and steady as the foundation of his throne. He never leaves nor forsakes his own, but causes goodness and mercy to follow them all the days of their lives, and when their <Q>flesh and their heart fails, he is the strength of their heart, and their everlasting portion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxiii. 26.</NOTE>.

<P N="6">6. HEAVEN is the glorious theatre on which the super-abounding riches and fulness of the love of CHRIST, both to the souls and bodies of his people, shall be most earnestly and magnificently displayed, in its <HI>lost scene</HI> and <HI>final issue.</HI> Heaven is the full accomplishment of this love. <HI>There,</HI> if ever, the <HI>heights,</HI> and <HI>depths,</HI> and <HI>lengths,</HI> and <HI>breadths</HI> of this love of CHRIST, will be <HI>fully compre∣hended</HI>—at least, <HI>clearly perceived,</HI> to the everlasting asto∣nishment of the enraptured soul—ever advancing—ever improving in perfection and happiness—ever drinking in full draughts of those rivers of pleasures which flow from the fountain-head of life, joy, perfection and im∣mortality. —<Q>CHRIST loved the church, and gave him∣self for it, that he might present it to himself a glo∣rious

<P>AND now, having thus shewed you the <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>transcendent nature,</HI> and briefly pointed out to you, some of the most eminent expressions and effects of a Re∣deemer's love, what needs more to illustrate the force of the Apostle's reasoning, or to shew you the con∣straints of this love?—<HI>Shew you,</HI> did I say,? Nay, do we not already begin to <HI>feel</HI> the constraints of this love upon our souls, <HI>bearing us away</HI> with a <HI>sweet,</HI> but pow∣erful influence to higher degrees of <HI>faith, love, gratitude</HI> and <HI>obedience?</HI> have not our souls already begun to <HI>catch the holy sire,</HI> and to enter into the force and spirit of the Apostle's reasoning—<Q>the love of CHRIST con∣straineth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again?</Q> Do we not already begin to anti∣cipate the songs of the redeemed nations; <Q>Unto HIM that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests un∣to GOD, even HIS FATHER; to HIM be glory and dominion for ever and ever; AMEN<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 5, 6.</NOTE>!</Q> Surely our

But this naturally leads me in the</P>
<P N="3">III. PLACE to improve the doctrine to some practi∣cal uses, by shewing <HI>what influence</HI> and <HI>constraint</HI> this love of CHRIST should have upon us, both as Ministers and people.</P>
<P N="1">1. As <HI>Christians,</HI> as the <HI>disciples</HI> and <HI>followers</HI> of the bles∣sed JESUS, surely this love of his should constrain us to reciprocal acts of love, imitation, and obedience.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) To reciprocal acts of love. The natural effects of love, are <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>reciprocal love.</HI> Love begets love, as naturally as a parent begets his own likeness. 'Tis as natural for us to love our friends, and be grate∣ful to our benefactors, as to dread and sly from our enemies.—Now, as the blessed JESUS is not only most amiable and lovely in himself, possessed of every natural and moral excellency which can attract the esteem of an intelligent being, but as he is also our best friend and most generous benefactor, hence our obligations to gratitude and reciprocal love are quite indisputable. He has pur∣chased our love and gratitude at the dearest price, and has engaged us <HI>to love him</HI> by the most astonishing acts of love and beneficence to us; in so much, that nothing can be more just and equitable than that dreadful denouncia∣tion of the Apostle, against all who are insensible to the attractions of a Saviour's love: <HI>If any man,</HI> says he, <HI>love not the</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>let him be anathema, maranatha, i. e.</HI> let him be <HI>accursed,</HI> and the LORD will come speedily and execute that curse upon him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xvi. 22.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="301" REF="014137_0300_0F97D3D6F533DF80"/>question therefore, is not, <HI>whether</HI> the love of CHRIST to <HI>us,</HI> should <HI>be</HI> a motive of ours to <HI>him;</HI> for this is self-evident? But rather, <HI>in what manner</HI> we may best express our love to our great benefactor? And it is plain, that this is best done by imitation and obedience. It fol∣lows therefore,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT the love of CHRIST should constrain us to the <HI>imitation</HI> of him, our beloved Lord and Master. To imitate the beloved object, is a natural and genuine effect of love. We naturally endeavour to imitate those whom we love, especially in those things for which we love them, and by which we hope to commend our∣selves to their favour and esteem. Now, as the <HI>moral perfections of</HI> CHRIST, and those divine graces and virtues which shone so conspicuous in him, through the whole of his incarnate state, are one of the principal foundati∣ons of our esteem for him; and as the imitation of those virtues and graces serve principally to recommend us to his friendship and regard: So <HI>in these</HI> we will earnestly endeavour to imitate him, if we truly love him. We will endeavour, that the same mind and temper be in us, which was also in CHRIST JESUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. ii. 5.</NOTE>. If we are indeed his <HI>sheep</HI> we will hear his voice and follow him; —will deny ourselves and take up our cross, learning of him to be meek and lowly, pure and patient, humble and resigned, that, in all things, we may be conformed unto him, and, in so doing, find peace, and rest, and hap∣piness to our souls<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Math. xvi. 24.—xi. 29. John x. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE ancient philosophers manifested their love to the leaders of their respective sects, by a <HI>most scrupulous imitation</HI> of them, in the whole tenor of their behaviour: And shall we, the disciples of JESUS, be less observant of the most holy and perfect example of our divine
<PB N="302" REF="014137_0301_0F97D3E234F80348"/>Master, than they were of those of <HI>Zeno</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> of <HI>Plato,</HI> and <HI>Aristotle?</HI> Especially, when the Apostle tells us, that <HI>even hereunto are we called; because</HI> CHRIST also suffered for us, LEAVING US AN EXAMPLE, THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS STEPS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 21.</NOTE>. And when another Apostle assures us, that <HI>he who said he abideth in him,</HI> or is his disciple, <HI>ought himself also</HI> SO TO WALK, <HI>even as</HI> HE WALKED<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE love of CHRIST should constrain us, his followers and disciples, to a <HI>cheerful and universal obedience to all his commandments.</HI> And what is this but to <HI>imitate his example?</HI> For, what duty hath he commanded us to perform, of which he hath not given us an example in his own conduct, so far as difference of nature and cir∣cumstances would permit? To obey him, therefore, in his most difficult and self-denying precepts, what is it but to imitate his own example, and to do that out of love and duty for him, which he, in obedience to his Father, hath done for our sakes, and to promote our salvation and happiness? To obey him, therefore, is to imitate him, and to imitate him is to be like him both in holiness and happiness.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>is the love of</HI> GOD, says the Apostle, that is, the most certain and substantial evidence of our love to him, <HI>that we keep his commandments</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 3.</NOTE>. And as this is the surest testimony of our love to the Father, so it is also of the Son. <Q>He that hath my commandments and keep∣eth them, he it is that loveth me. If a man love me, he will keep my words; but he that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 21, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q> We cheerfully and readily <HI>obey</HI> they person whom we <HI>love.</HI> Duty and incli∣nation here unite their kindred influences; laying a
<PB N="303" REF="014137_0302_0F97D3D7B42C8588"/>powerful and irresistable constraint on all the faculties of the soul, and engage them in a course of ready, ac∣tive, cheerful and universal obedience. Besides, this is the very use which the Apostle makes of the doctrine, in the verse below our text. CHRIST <HI>died for all,</HI> and the principal end of his doing so, was, that those who <HI>spiritually live,</HI> in consequence of his death, <HI>should not henceforth live unto themselves, i. e.</HI> according to the lusts of their own wills, or the dictates of their corrupt hearts; but according to the <HI>law, will</HI> and <HI>pleasure</HI> of HIM <HI>who died for them and rose again.</HI> Hence you see, that the obe∣dience of Christians, is one of the primary ends of CHRIST'S death, as well as the highest and surest evi∣dence of their love to him. <Q>He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and puri∣fy us unto himself, a peculiar people, zealous of good works:</Q> And he will be the <Q>Author of eternal salvation only to them that obey him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 12. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b. v. 9.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>HERE then, Christians, let us bring our love of CHRIST to this touch-stone, and try its <HI>sincerity</HI> and its <HI>strength.</HI> Do we love the Lord Jesus CHRIST in sinceri∣ty? If so, then we study above all things to please him, and dread above all things to offend him;—then we have an exquisite relish for, and delight in his service, and none of his commandments seem grievous to us, but the practice of the most self-denying duties is ren∣dered easy and delightful, by that love which is the principle of our obedience;—if so, then his Sabbaths, his house, his ordinances, his glory, honour and inte∣rest in the world, his laws and his people, are all of them dear to us, and beloved by us, for the love which we bear unto Jesus; But, and if the contrary of all this is the matter of fact, then the dreadful, tremendous con∣clusion is, That the <HI>love of the Father abideth not in us,</HI> and <HI>that we love not the Lord Jesus</HI> CHRIST <HI>in sincerity!</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="304" REF="014137_0303_0F97D3E2F469DCA8"/>
2. UPON us, who are the Ministers of his everlasting gospel, the love of CHRIST ought to have a mighty con∣straint. As Christians, we lie under the same obliga∣tions of love, gratitude, imitation and obedience with others. We lie involved in the same common ruin with the rest of our guilty race;—have <HI>ourselves to save,</HI> as well as <HI>them who hear us,</HI> and, therefore, have the same obligations to CHRIST for his great salvation, and have the same motives and necessity with others to <HI>work out our own salvation with fear and trembling,</HI> and to <HI>give all diligence to make our calling and election sure.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, the whole tenor and all the duties of our sa∣cred office, tend directly to beget and cherish (so far as instrumental means can) the habits of holiness and uni∣versal obedience in our souls; and therefore, perhaps, lays us under higher obligations to an examplary piety than others who enjoy not the same advantages. As Christian Ministers, our obligations <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>multiply.</HI> We are surrounded, as it were, and pressed on every side, with a vast variety of the most cogent arguments and powerful motives to <HI>zeal, ardour</HI> and <HI>diligence</HI> in the dis∣charge of our ministry. We are debtors both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, to the <HI>wise</HI> and the <HI>un∣wise.</HI> <Q>A dispensation of the gospel is committed un∣to us, a necessity is laid upon us, and wo unto us, if we preach not the gospel; if we be not instant in season and out of season; reproving, rebuking, ex∣horting with all long-suffering and doctrine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 14. 1 Cor. ix. 16. 2 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>love of</HI> CHRIST constraineth us—<HI>charity</HI> and <HI>uni∣versal benevolence to the souls of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> constrain us—our <HI>ordi∣nation vows</HI> constrain us—the <HI>blood of souls will be upon us,</HI> if we are unfaithful or remiss: But if, on the other hand, we are <HI>wise to win, souls</HI> to CHRIST;—if we are faithful and successful in our office, important will be
<PB N="305" REF="014137_0304_0F97D3E3B44A3EE8"/>our services among men, and great and glorious our re∣ward in heaven. If we <HI>turn many unto righteousness,</HI> we shall <HI>shine as the brightness of the firmament,</HI> and <HI>as the stars for ever and ever;</HI> we shall deliver immortal souls from perdition, and increase the number of the blessed, and the <HI>hallelujahs</HI> of the redeemed. By the conversion of sinners, we shall <HI>give joy in heaven,</HI> enlarge the Redeem∣er's kingdom, and promote his interest among men;— we shall weaken the kingdom of <HI>satan;</HI> defeat his ma∣lice; counteract his destructive designs, and lessen the number of his unhappy subjects. And, finally, every soul whom we are happily instrumental in saving, will be a new gem in our diadem of glory, a fresh accession to our everlasting joy and happiness, on that memorable and important day, when the LORD shall <Q>make up his jewels, and give unto every man according to his works, and to the deeds done in the body.</Q></P>
<P>ANIMATED therefore by these glorious hopes; fired by these important prospects; urged and pressed, as it were, on every side, with these almighty motives and considerations, well might the love of CHRIST, the love of souls, and a sense of duty and obligation, constrain the Apostles;—well may they constrain us their un∣worthy successors, to the most ardent zeal and unweari∣ed diligence in promoting the glory of GOD, the inte∣rest of CHRIST, and the salvation of sinners;—well may they cause us to look down with sovereign contempt on that <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>favour</HI> of men, which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a snare, in the discharge of our duty, and engage us to be stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the LORD, knowing that our labour shall not be in vain in him;—well may they steel and fortify our hearts against all the opposition of <HI>men</HI> and <HI>devils,</HI> and cause us to cry out, with our stedfast, magnanimous Apostle, in the face of bonds, imprisonments and death itself,—<Q>None
<PB N="306" REF="014137_0305_0F97D3E474AA25B0"/>of these things move us, neither count we our lives dear unto ourselves, so that we might finish our course with joy, and the ministry which we have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 24.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls was about to ascend into heaven, he <HI>thrice</HI> interrogated <HI>Peter</HI> in the same terms; <Q><HI>Simon,</HI> son of <HI>Jonas,</HI> lovest thou me more than these?</Q> To which, when the great Apostle had <HI>thrice</HI> answered in the affirmative; <Q>Yea, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</Q> His Lord charged him to testify his love to him, by <HI>feeding his lambs and his sheep</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE>." Do we therefore love the Lord Jesus CHRIST? Let us give proof of our love, by feeding his lambs and his sheep, and nourishing up in the words of faith and sound doc∣trine, those souls whom he hath redeemed with his pre∣cious blood. And O that they who hear us might learn to be wise to salvation; that, laying aside all malice, and guile, and hypocrisies, and evil-speakings, as new∣born babes, they might desire the sincere milk of the word, and grow thereby. Amen and Amen.</P>

<PB N="308" REF="014137_0307_0F97D3E5F4C8D910"/>circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of man but of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 11. 28, 29.</NOTE>.</Q> —So may we say with regard to <HI>christianity:</HI> <Q>He is not a Christian who is one meerly in name and outward profession; but he only who has the <HI>heart,</HI> the <HI>spirit</HI> the <HI>temper,</HI> the <HI>principles,</HI> and the <HI>conduct</HI> of a Christi∣an, whose praise is not of <HI>man</HI> only, but of GOD also.</Q> To be Christians <HI>indeed</HI> and in <HI>reality, my brethren,</HI> is to be lights in the world, to be harmless and blameless; un∣rebukeable and unreproveable, in the midst of a crook∣ed and perverse generation. And not only so; not merely to be thus <HI>negatively</HI> good; but also <HI>positively</HI> so; shining as lights to direct others in the way of life and happiness—<HI>Holding forth the word of life</HI>—Holding forth our good examples, as luminous torches or flambeaus, to conduct the feet of erring, wandering, benighted travellers, into the path of peace and felicity.</P>
<P>As <HI>natural light</HI> is the most pleasing and comfortable object to the eye and to the mind;—as it reveals all na∣tural objects to us;—directs our steps in this world;— points out the dangers of our way, and enables us to dis∣tinguish between that which is pleasant and eligible, and that which is hurtful and pernicious. <Q>For truly, (as Solomon observes) the light is sweet, and a plea∣sant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. xi. 17.</NOTE>.</Q> So <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> which answer much the same purposes in the <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>intellectual</HI> worlds, as material light does in the <HI>natural,</HI> are beautifully termed the <HI>light of the mind,</HI> in a figurative and metaphorical sense. Hence also, GOD, the great source and examplar of all truth and virtue, is called <HI>light.</HI> <Q>GOD is light, and in him there is no darkness at all.</Q> And CHRIST, who is the <Q>brightness of the Father's glory, and the express
<PB N="309" REF="014137_0308_0F97D3E6B42307D8"/>image of his person,</Q> is called, by way of eminence, <Q>The light of the world;—and that light which light∣eth every man, which cometh into the world.</Q> The scriptures also, which are the purest channels of truth and virtue to a benighted world, are called, <Q>Lights in a dark place;—a light to our feet, and a lamp or lan∣thorn thorn to our paths.</Q></P>
<P>AGREEABLE to all this;—when sinners are <HI>converted,</HI> or turned from <HI>error</HI> and <HI>vice,</HI> to <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> they are said to have <HI>their eyes opened;</HI> their <HI>understandings en∣lightened,</HI> and to be <HI>brought from darkness to light,</HI> and from the power of satan to GOD: And GOD is said to <HI>bring them out of darkness into his marvellous light.</HI> <Q>Ye were sometime darkness, (says the Apostle) but now are ye light in the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>AND hence, true Christians are called <HI>children of the light,</HI>—and commanded to <HI>walk in the light;</HI> to <HI>shine as lights in the world,</HI>—and to <HI>let their light so shine before men, that others, seeing their good works, may glorify our Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>To be a <HI>true Christian,</HI> therefore, <HI>my brethren,</HI> is to su∣stain the <HI>most honourable</HI> and <HI>beautiful</HI> of all characters:— It is to <HI>imitate</HI> and <HI>resemble</HI> GOD, who is the great source and fountain of light, and in whom there is no darkness at all;—to imitate and resemble CHRIST, who is the <HI>light of the world,</HI> and the <HI>life of men;</HI>—to imitate and re∣semble the <HI>saints,</HI> those brave and generous souls, who, in all ages, have copied after GOD, and shone as lights in the world, in the midst of a crooked and per∣verse generation, holding forth the word of life.—To be <HI>true Christians,</HI> is to be as like to the glorious GOD, both in virtue and happiness,—and to do as much good to our fellow-creatures in our day and generation, as possibly we can:—in a word, to be as lovely, as venerable, as virtuous, as holy, as happy and as useful, as
<PB N="310" REF="014137_0309_0F97D3E77522DFF0"/>the capacities of our limited, depraved nature will permit.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL had founded a church in <HI>Philippi,</HI> which worshipped the true GOD, and received the LORD JE∣SUS CHRIST, while many of their brethren and fellow-citizens, still continued in their idolatry and infidelity. It was, therefore, the desire and ambition of the good Apostle, that the converted <HI>Philippians</HI> should labour for the conversion of their heathen brethren. He desired, that the unbelieving and idolatrous <HI>Philippians,</HI> (who were attentive and malicious observers of their Christian brethren, because of the new religion they had embra∣ced, and the new kind of life they had devoted them∣selves to) should see nothing in them, but what was <HI>wise, reputable,</HI> and of <HI>good report;</HI> and <HI>such as becometh the gospel of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>THIS, however, it seems had not been the case, so much as the good Apostle wished. These <HI>young converts</HI> although they had broke off from the idolatry and infi∣delity of their neighbours, yet were still of very imper∣fect characters, in point of morality:—Although they had embraced the profession of Christianity; yet they had not fully imbib'd its spirit and temper. However sound they might be in <HI>faith,</HI> yet they lacked that <HI>charity,</HI> which is the bond of <HI>perfectness,</HI> and without which true Christianity, cannot either <HI>live</HI> or <HI>move</HI> or have <HI>its being.</HI> No sooner had they broke off from their unbelieving and idolatrous brethren, than they began to quarrel among themselves. This seems to have been the true ground and motive, of the Apostle's noble and excellent exhor∣tation, in our text; which will ever be equally useful, and equally applicable, while Christianity has a being in a corrupt, imperfect, world and state.</P>
<P><Q>Do all things, (says the Apostle) without mur∣murings and disputings: That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of GOD, without, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="014137_0310_0F97D3E8352243B0"/>
IN the words, we have <HI>three</HI> things observable, and which-shall (through the divine assistance) be the subject of the present discourse.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>post</HI> or <HI>station</HI> of a Christian in this world. He lives <Q>in the midst of a crooked and perverse ge∣neration;</Q> who are, at heart, enemies to that holiness which he professes; who will be close and malicious observers of all his conduct; and who are capable of being either greatly benefited, or greatly hurt by his example and conversation.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE have the <HI>Christian's destination</HI> in this world; what divine providence designs he should be; or what purpose he is designed to serve, in the midst of a crook∣ed and perverse generation. He is to <HI>shine as a light in the world: Holding forth the word of life,</HI>—that he may serve the double purpose of both saving himself and others.</P>
<P N="3">III. WE have the <HI>duty of a Christian</HI> in this world, in order to his answering this destination of providence: <Q>He is to be <HI>harmless</HI> and <HI>blameless; a child of</HI> GOD, <HI>without rebuke;</HI></Q> that the gospel may not be blamed; that sinners may be converted, and that his Christian brethren may be edified: In a word, <Q>He is to let this light of his so shine before men, that others, seeing his good works, may glorify our Father which is in hea∣ven.</Q></P>
<P>ARE there any amongst us, <HI>my brethren,</HI> who have the noble ambition, not only of obtaining this heavenly feli∣city ourselves, but also of leading others in the same road? Are there any amongst us, who have the noble ambition of concurring with JESUS CHRIST in the work of human redemption? Let such learn, to day, from St.
<PB N="312" REF="014137_0311_0F97D3E8F4F6D680"/><HI>Paul,</HI> to prosecute so noble a design by shining as lights in the world; by being <HI>harmless and blamless</HI> as the <HI>children of</HI> GOD, <HI>without rebuke,</HI> in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. May the holy Spirit himself in∣spire us with this divine ambition—and may the bles∣sing of GOD, attending this discourse, give us power and spirit to pursue so noble a design, until our en∣deavours are crowned with heavenly glory.—Amen.</P>
<P N="1">I. THEN we are briefly to consider the <HI>post</HI> and <HI>station</HI> of a true Christian in this world:—<Q>He lives in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.</Q></P>
<P>THIS sentiment and expression of the Apostle might be easily <HI>justified</HI> and <HI>illustrated,</HI> by considering the <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>morals</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> amongst which the primitive Christians lived, to whom he here writes. The character which our Saviour and his Apostles have left us on record, both of the Jews and Gentiles of that age, (and which is abundantly confirmed by contempo∣rary writers) makes it appear, that they were, indeed, "a crooked and perverse generation."</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> had scarcely the very shadow of religion left amongst them in that abandoned age. The mea∣sure of their iniquity seems then to have been <HI>filled,</HI> and they were <HI>ripe for destruction.</HI> To the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> the 'most <HI>numerous</HI> and respectable sect amongst them, our Saviour thus addresses himself—<Q>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnati∣on of hell?</Q> And, as to the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> they were men of <HI>atheistical principles,</HI> and detestable morals.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>morals</HI> and <HI>manners</HI> of the <HI>Heathens</HI> of that time, and into what a state of luxury, bebauchery, and universal corruption they had degenerated, I might re∣fer you to their own historians, moralists and satyrists: But that portrait which this Apostle himself has given
<PB N="313" REF="014137_0312_0F97D3E9B5215950"/>us of the <HI>Romans,</HI> one of the most learned, philosophi∣cal, and civilized Heathen nations, shall suffice in lieu of every other authority.—<Q>Being filled (says the Apostle) with all unrighteousness, fornication, wick∣edness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, back∣biters, haters of GOD, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful; vile in their affections; changing the truth of GOD into a lie; and worshipping and serving the creature more than the CREATOR, who is GOD over all, blessed for ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 21,—34.</NOTE>.</Q> What a black catalogue of vices is this? And was not that a "crooked and perverse generation," indeed, of which this was the general and prevailing character?</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>my brethren,</HI> we need not go back to antiquity, to justify and illustrate this observation of the Apostle. In every age of the world, GOD'S true church and people, <Q>live in the midst of a crooked and per∣verse generation.</Q></P>
<P>THE Apostle is still addressing every Christian amongst us, in the words of our text, with equal propriety as he did his converts at <HI>Philippi</HI>—<Q>Be ye harmless and blameless, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, amongst whom ye shine as lights in the world.</Q> The world, as distinguished from the church, ever has been, and ever will be, "a crooked and perverse generation." This world has been ever distinguished into two grand classes of men, diametrically opposite in their principles, ends, motives, dispositions and manners, and generally distinguished in scripture by the appellation of the <Q>world, and the church;—the seed of the woman, and seed of the
<PB N="314" REF="014137_0313_0F97D3EA743497F0"/>serpent;—the sheep and the goats;—the tares and the wheat;—the righteous and the wicked;—the chil∣dren of this world, and the children of light.</Q> If we attentively read the scriptures, we will find that the word world, is generally used to repre∣sent the worst of these two classes.—<Q>The world (says St. <HI>John</HI>) lieth in wickedness.—The world (says he) knoweth us not.—Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him: For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.</Q> St. <HI>James</HI> tells us, <Q>that the friendship of the world is enmity with GOD;</Q> and therefore beseeches Christians, <HI>to keep themselves unspotted from the world.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <Q>the LORD JESUS CHRIST gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of GOD;</Q>—and there∣fore earnestly beseeches Christians not <HI>to be conformed to this world,</HI> in its manners, customs, spirit or maxims, but <HI>to be transformed by the renewing of their minds.</HI> <Q>If the world hate you (says CHRIST to his disciples) ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</Q></P>
<P>IT were easy, <HI>my brethren,</HI> to multiply quotations to this purpose; but surely evidence enough has been pro∣duced to prove, that the world, in which Christians live; or, that that company of men with which the church is contrasted, and from which it is distinguished every where in scripture, is <Q>a crooked and perverse genera∣tion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="014137_0314_0F97D3EB354EA310"/>
THE <HI>same truth</HI> will evidently appear from the <HI>general maxims</HI> and <HI>prevailing manners of</HI> the world, by which the crookedness and perverseness of their sentiments and conduct will be clearly manifested. Will either the dictates of enlightened reason, the best interests of socie∣ty, or the <HI>gospel of</HI> CHRIST, justify such maxims as the following:—<Q>Youth is the proper season for pleasure and gallantry:—It is ridiculous to make much ado about religion:—We should not aspire to be saints: All that religion requires of us, is to be just and honest in our dealings:—Calumny and ridicule are the salt or zest of conversation:—It is unworthy of a man of honour to put up with an affront. Revenge is sweet: —Ambition is the vice of noble souls:—Impurity is intollerable in women, but pardonable in men. We should be conformed to the world, and act agreeable to its maxims.</Q>—Which of these my friends, (and a great many more might be added to the number) does not flatly contradict some precept of CHRIST, and the very spirit and genius of Christianity?—And yet which of these maxims is not received in society as a first principle, against the truth of which, it would be deemed affectation to dispute?</P>
<P>AND are not the <HI>prevailing manners</HI> of the world, exact∣ly conformable to <HI>these maxims?</HI>—How few regard even the solemnity of an oath, where interest is concern∣ed? —What faith is, now a days, to be put in the pro∣mises or professions of men? The very form of religion is in such sovereign contempt, that it is deemed highly impolite to introduce even the mention of it into com∣pany. How few in Christian countries, comparatively speaking, attend the ordinances of CHRIST, or pay any regard to the public worship of GOD?—What are the lives of the generality, but a course of mere extrava∣gance, sensuality, and dissipation—of enquiry how they may provide for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof—
<PB N="316" REF="014137_0315_0F97D3EBF45C5F88"/>what they shall eat, or drink, and wherewithal they shall be clothed, without a single serious thought about the state of their souls, or eternity? If we enquire into the source of mirth and pleasantry in most companies, shall we not find the laugh almost perpetually raised, either at the expence of religion, or at the natural or moral failings and infirmities of our fellow-creatures? Subjects which drew tears from the eyes of <HI>David,</HI> and which no right mind can contemplate, without pain and anxiety! Indeed, what is modern wit and gaiety, but calumny, slander and profanity, rendered laughable, by the ludicrous garb in which they are dressed?—To all this, may I not add, that some of the most scandalous and filthy vices are become so common and fashionable in Christian countries, that to resist or decline them, would be deemed an almost unpardonable singulari∣ty.</P>
<P>SURELY nothing more need be added to prove, That the <HI>world</HI> in which Christians live, is <Q>a crooked and perverse generation;</Q>—that to follow the multitude, is to renounce the guidance of reason and religion; and that to be conformed to this evil world, in its general customs, maxims and manners, is to imitate the very worst exam∣ples, and to forfeit all that glory and happiness which the gospel has set before us. I am now to lay before you, under the</P>
<P N="2">II. HEAD of discourse, The <HI>Christian's destination</HI> in this <HI>evil world;</HI> or, <HI>what purposes</HI> he is <HI>designed</HI> and <HI>appoint∣ed</HI> to serve in the midst of a crooked and perverse gene∣ration.—<Q>He is to shine as a light in the world, hold∣ing forth the word of life.</Q> Upon such a view of things, Christians may possibly say, <Q>Since <HI>such</HI> is the world in which we live;—since human society is so empoisoned and corrupted, let us shun the contagion: —Let us break off all commerce with the living:—
<PB N="317" REF="014137_0316_0F97D3EE4EC22708"/>Let us abandon the society of men, and, like hermits, secure our innocence in obscurity and retirement, in the solitude of desarts and caves of the earth.</Q> By no means, says St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Man is a social creature, and is designed for society: Flee not, therefore, from the des∣tination of Providence: Continue in that world where the example of your virtue is so necessary: Labour to disabuse and undeceive your fellow-mortals, and to pre∣vent them, if possible, from falling into misery: Let your life, your conversation, and your whole deport∣ment, be a reproach to their vices, and a light to direct their feet into the paths of peace, holiness and happi∣ness: <Q>Shine as lights in the world; holding forth, in your example and behaviour, the word of life, for the direction and instruction of others.</Q></P>
<P>THE Greek word, which we translate <HI>light,</HI> has a pe∣culiar energy in the text. It is compounded of two words, which signify <HI>an elevated light,</HI> or a <HI>light held up,</HI> for the guidance and direction of others. The Apostle probably alludes to the ancient <HI>Pharos,</HI> a <HI>tower</HI> or <HI>light∣house,</HI> built by <HI>Ptolemy Philadelphus,</HI> on an island of the same name, in the mouth of the river <HI>Nile</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> on the top of which a fire was kept continually kindled in the night, to direct vessels into the harbour. The allu∣sion, <HI>my brethren,</HI> is very plain and very beautiful. The Christian serves as a <HI>guide</HI> and <HI>director</HI> to a crooked and perverse generation. Elevated above the false maxims and corrupt manners of the world, he holds forth be∣fore him the word of life; <HI>i. e.</HI> he <HI>shows</HI> and <HI>manifests,</HI> by his example, <HI>that</HI> which the word of GOD demands of us, in order to our entering into life eternal.</P>
<P>THE <HI>word of</HI> GOD is termed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 105.</NOTE>, <Q>A light to our feet and a lamp to our paths,</Q> because it gives us direc∣tion in the whole of our conduct. When our temporal
<PB N="318" REF="014137_0317_0F97D3EEF56E8EF0"/>and eternal interests clash and interfere with each other, it puts that important and significant question, <Q>What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</Q> In the time of affliction, it calls us to <HI>consider,</HI> <Q>and to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of GOD, that he may exalt us in due season.</Q>—Under the influence of riches and prosperi∣ty, it directs us, <Q>not to trust in uncertain riches—to be rich in the good works of charity and liberality— to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God; willing to distribute; ready to communicate:—To make unto ourselves friends of the mammon of un∣righteousness, that when we fail here, they may re∣ceive us into everlasting habitations.</Q>—On a death∣bed, and in the near prospect of eternity, it is a light to our feet, and a lamp to our paths—by representing death as a <HI>conquered, disarmed</HI> tyrant;—by opening an eternal world of glory to the faith of the Christian;— by assuring him, that when <Q>his heart and his flesh fail, GOD will be the strength of his heart and his portion for ever;—that blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord, for they do rest from their labour and their works do follow them.</Q></P>
<P>Now, that which <HI>David</HI> says of the <HI>word of</HI> GOD, St. <HI>Paul</HI> here says of the <HI>destination of the Christian.</HI> As GOD hath given his word to be a light to men's feet and a lamp to their paths,—to guide their feet into the way of peace and happiness,—so he hath also destined and ap∣pointed Christians, <Q>to shine as lights in the world, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,</Q>— practically <HI>holding forth,</HI> and <HI>examplifying</HI> the word of life, for their guidance and direction.</P>
<P>THE Christian's life and conversation should be the word of GOD reduced to practice; a living comment on the word of life; so that the ignorant and wicked
<PB N="319" REF="014137_0318_0F97D3EFCC758F58"/>world, who either cannot or will not read the word of GOD, may see it clearly held forth, and plainly exam∣plified in the life of the Christian. And indeed, <HI>my bre∣thren,</HI> what have the lives of the saints been, in all ages, but just a <HI>holding forth of this word of life?</HI> They have preached more powerfully and more effectually, by their lives and examples, than their doctrines, to those crooked and perverse generations, among whom they shone as lights in the world. GOD hath <HI>set them up,</HI> in every age and generation, as <HI>beacons</HI> and <HI>Pharoses,</HI> to stem the torrent of human depravity and corruption;— to shew the practicability of virtue in human nature; —to be a reproof and reproach to prevailing vice and immorality, causing iniquity, as ashamed, to hide its face,—and to allure mankind into the paths of virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>WOULD we see, for instance, the preference which the interests of <HI>eternity</HI> should have to those of <HI>time;</HI> let us behold it examplified in the conduct of Moses, <Q>Who refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of GOD, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of CHRIST great∣er riches than the treasures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> because he had respect to the recompence of reward.</Q>—In the lives of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> we have the noblest examples of pious masters of families: <Q>As for me, (says <HI>Joshua</HI>) and my house, we will serve the Lord.</Q> <Q>For I know <HI>Abraham,</HI> (says GOD) that he will command his children, and his houshold after him, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 19. Josh. xxiv. 15.</NOTE>.</Q> —In King <HI>David,</HI> the most fervent piety and animated devotion shine forth conspicuously.—<HI>Job</HI> taught the world, in his day, that <HI>dutiful submission</HI> and <HI>entire resigna∣tion</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="014137_0319_0F97D3F0925607E0"/>which we owe to the will of GOD in times of the deepest calamity and affliction; <Q>What! shall we receive good at the hand of GOD, and shall we not receive evil also; the LORD giveth, and the LORD taketh away, and blessed be the name of the LORD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job i. 21.—ii. 10.</NOTE>.</Q> In <HI>Zaccheus</HI> we have a bright example of the proper use of riches, and the great duty of restitution;—<Q>Behold, LORD, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, by false accu∣sation, I restore him four-fold<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 8.</NOTE>:</Q> And in the life of St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself, we have examplified a whole con∣stellation of Christian virtues and duties;—the most examplary humility, patience and self-denial;—un∣paralelled zeal and diligence in promoting the glory of GOD, and the salvation of men,—and the most earnest desire <Q>of being absent from the body and present with the LORD.</Q>—All these answered the designation of divine providence, and fulfilled this positive and active part of their Christian calling:—All these were <HI>burning</HI> and <HI>shining lights</HI> in the world; holding forth the word of life to those <HI>crooked and perverse generations,</HI> among whom divine providence had stationed and placed them.</P>
<P>NOR, <HI>my brethren,</HI> was <HI>this duty peculiar</HI> to these <HI>great lights</HI> of the <HI>ancient world;</HI> it is equally the duty, the honour and the interest of every individual Christian to the end of time, to be a <HI>burning and a shining light</HI> in his day and generation, and thus to <HI>hold forth the word of life,</HI> to the crooked and perverse generation, among whom he is stationed by divine providence.</P>
<P>MANY Christians, indeed, are not able to <HI>build church∣es,</HI> to <HI>found hospitals,</HI> to <HI>preach</HI> or defend the gospel, or to propagate it to distant parts of the world;—but every Christian is surely able to live a good, virtuous and
<PB N="321" REF="014137_0320_0F97D3F13489DC10"/>examplary life.—Every Christian is able <Q>to adron the doctrine of GOD his Saviour,</Q> to exhibit the vir∣tues and graces of genuine Christianity;—to encou∣rage virtue and piety, and discountenance vice and im∣morality as far as his influence and example can reach. And this is every Christian's duty: <Q>Let your light, (says CHRIST, the great Lord and Law-giver of Christians) so shine before men, that others seeing your good works, may glorify your Father in hea∣ven. —Be ye harmless and blameless, (says the Apos∣tle) the children of GOD without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.—Have your conversation honest among the Gentiles; (says St. <HI>Peter</HI>) having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you, as of evil doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in CHRIST—and may, by your good works which they shall behold, glorify GOD in the day of visita∣tion.</Q></P>
<P>THESE scriptures, <HI>my brethren,</HI> while they point out the duty of Christians, also shew the propriety and ex∣pediency of it. It is proper, it is fit and expedient, that Christians should maintain and preserve an immacu∣late and examplary character—that the gospel may not be blamed;—that their profession may not be disgraced; —that sinners may be reclaimed, and that the church may be edified. They owe this duty to GOD, to them∣selves, to the Church, and to that crooked and perverse generation, among whom GOD hath placed them as <HI>lights,</HI> to hold forth the word of life.</P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>positive part</HI> of the Christian's duty. He is to be <HI>actively holy</HI> and <HI>examplary,</HI> in all manner of life and conversation; and that, not merely from the selfish and contracted view of securing his own salvation;— but also, from the more <HI>catholic</HI> and <HI>charitable</HI> motive of promoting the salvation of his fellow men;—that he

<P N="3">III. To the <HI>negative</HI> duty of a Christian, in order to his answering this destination of providence: <Q>He is to live harmless and blameless, as the child of GOD, without rebuke.</Q></P>
<P>THESE words must be understood <HI>here</HI> (as indeed eve∣ry where else in scripture when applied to men) not in their most rigid and strictly literal meaning, as implying a <HI>sinless perfection:</HI> For, alas! in this sense, <Q>there is not a just man upon earth, who doeth good and sin∣eth not. In many things we all offend: And if we say we have <HI>no sin,</HI> we are <HI>liars</HI> and the <HI>truth is not in us.</HI></Q> They must therefore be understood in a <HI>qualifi∣ed sense,</HI> as only implying <HI>gospel sincerity</HI> and <HI>evangelical righteousness.</HI> <Q>Be ye harmless, blameless and irre∣proachable as the children of GOD;</Q> that is, <Q>pay a <HI>constant regard</HI> to the laws of that great Master whom you serve, so far as human weakness and infirmity will permit; and let it appear evidently even by the very nature of those failings and short-comings which the weakness and imperfection of your nature sometimes betrays you into, that your sins are not <HI>deliberate</HI> and <HI>allowed,</HI> proceeding from a <HI>spirit of rebellion;</HI> but arising wholly from the <HI>weakness</HI> and <HI>infirmity</HI> of your nature, in the present imperfect state.</Q> It is said emphatical∣ly of the <HI>wicked</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> xxxii. 5.</NOTE>, <Q>They have corrupted themselves; their spot is not the spot of GOD'S children; they are a perverse and crooked generation.</Q> GOD'S <HI>children,</HI> it seems, have <HI>their spots;</HI> but they are not the spots of the wicked. They sin not cordially, presumptuously, allowedly, nor perseveringly. They love holiness and
<PB N="323" REF="014137_0322_0F97D3BEB3A89818"/>pursue it, as far as the weakness and infirmity of their nature will permit. It is their honest and hearty en∣deavour, <Q>to be harmless and blameless, the children of GOD, without rebuke;</Q> and with the charitable and right-thinking part of mankind, they generally ob∣tain a good report, an irreproachable character. A real Christian can join <HI>Job,</HI> with some sincerity, in saying: <Q>I will not remove my integrity from me; my righte∣ousness I hold fast, and will not let it go? My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</Q> And what was predicated of <HI>Job,</HI> may, with some propriety, be said of <HI>him;</HI> <Q>That he is a perfect man, and an up∣right; one who feareth GOD and escheweth evil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job i. 1.—xxvii. 6.</NOTE>.</Q> It will be his great ambition and earnest endeavour, as a child of GOD, not only to imbibe the temper and dis∣position of a child, crying Abba Father; but also to imitate his heavenly Father in all those virtues and graces which constitute his moral character, being <HI>holy</HI> as GOD is <HI>holy, pure</HI> as he is <HI>pure,</HI> and <HI>merciful</HI> as he is <HI>merciful,</HI> in all manner of life and conversation.</P>
<P>IN VAIN, <HI>my fellow Christians,</HI> do we <HI>assume the cha∣racter</HI> of being the <HI>children of</HI> GOD.—<HI>In vain</HI> are we the expectants of a glorious immortality, in conse∣quence of this assumed character:—and, <HI>in vain</HI> do we impose on a credulous world, by this hollow and hypo∣critical profession, while we are unlike our heavenly Fa∣ther in the temper of our minds, and the conduct of our lives; while, instead of being <HI>harmless, blameless, un∣rebukeable</HI> and <HI>examplary,</HI> we continue to be a <HI>perverse</HI> and <HI>crooked generation,</HI> and have lives and conversations all blurr'd over with the <HI>spots of the wicked.</HI> Indignant hea∣ven must justly spurn such affrontive insolence; and that <HI>omniscient</HI> GOD, who requires <HI>truth in the heart,</HI> and <HI>sincerity in the inward part,</HI> will appoint us our portion with hypocrites, where shall be weeping and wailing,
<PB N="324" REF="014137_0323_0F97D3F2B46890A0"/>and gnashing of teeth. But I have already trespassed too long on your patience, and shall beg leave to con∣clude, by addressing my most tender exhortations to <HI>two sorts of persons:</HI> And, <HI>1st,</HI> To such of you, <HI>my bre∣thren,</HI> who, by your Christian profession, and by a cor∣respondent examplary life, have the honour of shining as lights, in the midst of a crooked and perverse gene∣ration, holding forth the word of life.</P>
<P>I CALL you, my brethren, to consider the <HI>grand</HI> and <HI>sublime</HI> of your Christian character and calling. When St. <HI>Paul</HI> would animate his son <HI>Timothy</HI> to a zealous dis∣charge of the duties of his ministry, he tells him, <Q>Take heed unto thy self, and unto thy doctrine: For, in doing this, thou shalt both save thy self, and them that hear thee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>.</Q> He makes him a kind of subordinate saviour; a fellow-labourer and fellow-worker with CHRIST, in the glorious work of human redemption.</P>
<P>BUT what <HI>Timothy did by his ministry,</HI> every Christian is called, in our text, to do by his <HI>example.</HI> If, indeed, <HI>my brethren,</HI> you are <Q>harmless and blameless, the chil∣dren of GOD, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life,</Q> you shall not only <HI>save yourselves,</HI> but also be highly instrumental in <HI>saving others.</HI> And oh! what an <HI>honour,</HI> what a blessedness is this?—In pursuing this de∣sign, you enter into the plan of redemption, and partake of the honours of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the Re∣deemer;—you do a <HI>work</HI> the most pleasing to GOD; the most profitable to yourselves, and the most beneficial to your fellow-creatures:—A <HI>work</HI> which employed the counsels of GOD from all eternity;—and a <HI>work,</HI> on which he lavished (if I may so speak with reverence)
<PB N="325" REF="014137_0324_0F97D3F376E72918"/>the life and blood of his dear Son; I mean, the salva∣tion of poor mortals.</P>
<P>BY <HI>this divine</HI> and <HI>God-like labour</HI> of love, you are al∣so brightening your immortal crowns and doubling your eternal rewards. <Q>For what is our hopes, (says St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI>) or our joy, or our crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, at his coming? For ye are our glory and our joy.</Q>—In like manner, <HI>my brethren,</HI> those souls, to whose salvation you have contributed, by your virtuous and pious examples, will be your crown, your joy, and your glory, through eternal ages. In those regions of perfect love, you will be happy, not only in seeing the happiness of those whom you loved here, but also in having promoted their eternal happiness;—in having preserved them from the contagion of the age;— in having recovered them from a crooked and perverse generation, and in having snatched them as brands from the burning.—And O! my friends, can there be any difficulty unconquerable—any virtue too severe—any self-denial too painful with such motives as these before your eyes? Is it possible, that any frivolous pleasure, or trifling emolument of sin, should have power or influ∣ence enough to rob you of this glory, this joy, and this crown of rejoicing? I would,</P>
<P N="2">2. BEG leave to address myself in a few words, to such as are unhappy enough still to make a part of that crooked and perverse generation, amidst whom the few righteous shine as lights in the world.</P>
<P>MY unhappy fellow-sinners! Let me beseech you in the spirit of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>meekness,</HI> to enter into the views of providence, who has set those eminent examples of virtue and piety before your eyes! For what reason hath GOD, the Father of mercies, kindled up so many <HI>burning</HI> and <HI>shining lights</HI> in this world of his—Men of
<PB N="326" REF="014137_0325_0F97D3F435012720"/>our own nature and make, adorned with so many con∣spicuous virtues—who have been ornaments to human nature, and benefactors to the world?—Is it only that we should behold them with an eye of <HI>envy</HI> and <HI>contempt?</HI> Is it only that we should blacken their characters, and pursue them with calumny and slander; thus aggra∣vating our own guilt and condemnation?—Is it not that we should emulate their virtues, imitate their examples, and be corrected, reformed and instructed by their manners?</P>
<P>LET us <HI>blush</HI> to think that men of the <HI>same common nature</HI> with ourselves; composed of the same flesh and blood; animated with the same passions, and born heirs of the same corruptions and infirmities, should have yet so far outstripped us, in every thing <HI>noble,</HI> GOD-<HI>like, rational</HI> and <HI>divine?</HI>—Are not the same succours, the same promises of aid and assistance, the same sources of grace, virtue and holiness, open to us, as were to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> to <HI>Job,</HI> to <HI>Elijah,</HI> to <HI>Paul;</HI> and as are to all the good, the virtuous, the pious, and examplary, of this as well as every foregoing age? Wherefore then do we not avail ourselves of these advantages?—Is there any assignable reason why any of our fellow-creatures should outdo us in any thing <HI>amiable, lovely, virtuous, praise-worthy</HI> and <HI>of good report?</HI> Why any of our fellow-men should excel us in the care of their own souls, or of the souls of their fellow-creatures? <Q>The saints, are the excellent ones of the earth, in whom should be all our delight:</Q> Let us respect their virtues: Let us cherish their acquaintance: Let us love their society, and follow their examples. Too, too long have we scandalized the church, it is now time we should edify it. Too, too long have we laboured for the destructi∣on of our fellow-men, it is now time we should labour for their conversion and salvation. Too, too long have
<PB N="327" REF="014137_0326_0F97D3C5414A9100"/>we been <HI>joined to this crooked and perverse generation; this world which lies in wickedness.</HI>—It is now time we should shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life, for the guidance and direction of those whom our bypast evil examples have perverted and confirmed in their wickedness!</P>
<P>To conclude in one word: Let me address that ex∣hortation to all of you, <HI>my dear hearers,</HI> which St. <HI>Peter</HI> addressed to the Jews—<Q>Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</Q>—Deliver yourselves from their <HI>principles, maxims, customs</HI> and <HI>manners;</HI> from their <HI>sins</HI> and from their <HI>judgments.</HI>—<Q>Make haste, flee for your lives, lest ye perish.</Q> May GOD, the merciful Fa∣ther of our spirits, give weight to this exhortation, and set it home powerfully upon each of our consciences; and to his great name shall be the eternal praise, through JESUS CHRIST our only Lord and Redeemer. Amen and Amen.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY LXI. THE AGGRAVATED GUILT OF MURDER: A SERMON FROM EXODUS XX. 13.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Thou shalt not kill.</HEAD>
<P>IT may perhaps be deemed a little unseasonable and impolite to handle a subject of this kind, before a civilized and christianized assembly. Methinks, I hear some of my hearers object, and say, <Q>You pay us but a rude and unwelcome compliment, by even supposing us capable of committing such an atrocious and un∣natural crime as this. Murder! The shedding of in∣nocent blood! Our blood runs chill, and freezes at the very thought of it. No; GOD forbid! Our hearts are too tender and humane ever to harbour such a design, or listen to such a temptation!</Q></P>
<P>THERE was a time, <HI>my hearers,</HI> when most murderers could doubtless have said all this, with as much <HI>confidence</HI> and <HI>sincerity</HI> as any of us now can, and when their very
<PB N="329" REF="014137_0328_0F97D3F5B4FE7F70"/>souls would have shuddered at the thoughts of com∣mitting so great a wickedness. But there was also a time when the increased strength of their corruptions hurried them on to commit it with greediness, and un∣der the most aggravated circumstances of guilt.</P>
<P>ALAS! we little know the <HI>deceitfulness</HI> and <HI>desperate wickedness</HI> of our own hearts, or the <HI>depth</HI> and <HI>inveteracy</HI> of our corruptions, when we imagine ourselves above the danger or possibility of committing the greatest and most atrocious crimes. <Q>The heart (says the pro∣phet) is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who can know it? It starts aside like a broken bow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 9.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>WE look upon murder, (and justly) as the most atrocious crime which can be committed by man—we have no compassion for the persons of murderers, but regard them as <HI>monsters of iniquity,</HI> who have even no claim to <HI>human pity:</HI>—But I am persuaded, <HI>my friends,</HI> that nothing but the restraining grace of GOD, prevents multitudes, who are thus <HI>merciless</HI> in their judgment of others, from committing the very same crime. <Q><HI>Cruel man!</HI>—Thou hast no mercy on thy fellow-sinner!— Thou thinkest him unworthy the pity either of GOD or man!—Thou deemest it impossible for thee to fall into the same wickedness!—Yet thou art <HI>proud, imperi∣ous, intolerant</HI> and <HI>unforgiving!</HI> Yet thy soul often <HI>boils, ferments,</HI> and <HI>rankles</HI> with the passion of <HI>anger, fury, re∣venge, envy,</HI> and <HI>malice prepense</HI> against thy neighbour! Yet thou prayest for his damnation, and devisest evil against him, and wishest him dead, because he stands in the way of some gratification, or has wounded thy imaginary honour, or hurt thy pride! Be it known unto thee, <HI>O blind</HI> and <HI>merciless man,</HI> that <HI>thou art the very murderer</HI> whom thou condemnest without pity;
<PB N="330" REF="014137_0329_0F97D3F675392EE0"/>and that nothing but some <HI>prudential motive,</HI> or rather, the <HI>restraining grace of</HI> GOD, bridling thine outrageous passions, for the safety and security of human society, prevents thee from perpetrating the very fact thyself, which thou thinkest <HI>unpardonable</HI> in <HI>another.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thou shalt not kill, <HI>says GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be paying a bad compliment to the under∣standings of my hearers, to take up much of your time in shewing you—That there are many circumstances, wherein the taking away of human life, is not to be deemed <HI>sinful</HI> or <HI>criminal;</HI>—such as <HI>chance-medly,</HI> when one man takes away the life of another, by <HI>mere acci∣dent,</HI> without any <HI>knowledge</HI> or <HI>design</HI> in the action;—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>man-slaughter, on one's own defence,</HI> when a man from a principle of <HI>self-preservation,</HI> is, as it were, compelled to take away the life of another who assaults him unpro∣voked, in order to save his own. The same also hap∣pens in <HI>a lawful, defensive war,</HI> when men are forced to destroy an invading enemy, in defence of their own lives, liberties and properties;—or, <HI>lastly,</HI> when men have for∣feited their lives, by such crimes as essentially affect the public good and safety, and which are adjudged worthy of death, by laws <HI>human and divine.</HI> In all these cases, and perhaps in some others, the taking away of human life, is so far from being criminal, that it may be a duty which we owe to GOD, <HI>our neighbour</HI> and <HI>ourselves!</HI></P>
<P>THE crime therefore <HI>here</HI> forbidden by GOD, and which is emphatically expressed in the English lan∣guage by the word murder, is the <HI>shedding of innocent blood;</HI> —or <Q>wilfully and feloniously killing of another, upon prepensed malice; whether secretly or openly; whether ourselves, or by others.</Q> And this prepensed malice, is either, (1.) Express, when it may be evidently proved, that there was ill-will;—or, (2.) Implied; when one kills another suddenly, having nothing to de∣fend
<PB N="331" REF="014137_0330_0F97D3F7347C3BC8"/>himself: For, in such a case, the law justly pre∣sumes, that there must have been <HI>malice.—To this</HI> may also be added, the atrocious crime of <HI>suicide,</HI> or a man's laying violent hands upon himself;—as also, <HI>duelling,</HI> which contains in it the essence and guilt of both the above crimes.</P>
<P>IN farther improving this subject, I shall, I. <HI>A little</HI> expose the heinous and and aggravated guilt of murder. —II. Shew you that it is a crime justly punishable by death.—III. Endeavour to expose those <HI>passions, tempers</HI> and <HI>practices</HI> which lead to it. I am,</P>
<P N="1">I. A LITTLE to open and <HI>expose</HI> the <HI>heinous</HI> and <HI>aggravated guilt</HI> of murder. And this may be shown 1st, From the very <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>consequences</HI> of the crime itself; and, 2dly, From the light in which both the <HI>word of</HI> GOD, and the <HI>consciences of men</HI> represent it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the very nature and consequences of the crime itself. (1.) Man is fearfully and wonderfully made; <HI>made,</HI> we are told, in the <HI>image</HI> and <HI>likeness</HI> of GOD. Man is GOD'S offspring and <HI>representative</HI> on this earth. His body is, perhaps, the noblest piece of divine workmanship; and GOD, when he had made it, breathed into it the breath of life, and made it <HI>a living</HI> and <HI>intelligent image</HI> of <HI>himself!</HI> Now to break to pieces this <HI>living temple;</HI>—to <HI>deface, undo,</HI> and, as much as in us is, <HI>wantonly to destroy</HI> this workmanship of GOD;— to separate this soul and body whom GOD hath joined together;—to disunite and take down this tabernacle, which GOD hath built and set up, by a miracle of his power, wisdom and goodness;—what a <HI>daring</HI> crime? What an <HI>audacious</HI> wickedness? All our power, wisdom and contrivance cannot give <HI>form, existence</HI> or <HI>life</HI> to a
<PB N="332" REF="014137_0331_0F97D3F7F6274BE8"/>worm; and shall we dare to destroy a fellow-man? Shall we perfume to take away, in the wantonness of our pride and passion, that which all the powers on earth, and all the angels in haven cannot give?</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT GOD <HI>makes nothing in vain,</HI> is a maxim not to be disputed. Who knows the destiny of a human creature, or for what purposes Providence may have designed him? Presumptuous, short-sighted mortals that we are, we are apt to pronounce a being worthless and useless, on whom his Maker may set much value, and by whom he may do great things! When we see <HI>Saul persecuting the church,</HI> and assisting in the stoning of <HI>Stephen,</HI> we may adjudge him worthy of death, and think the world would be well rid of such a monster; yet this very <HI>Saul</HI> was <HI>a chosen vessel,</HI> who was to prose∣lyte half the Roman empire to JESUS! How many wicked and worthless men, have become benefactors to the world and ornaments to humanity!</P>
<P>How many pests to human society have become fa∣thers of children, who have done honour to human na∣ture, and become the saviours of their country?—This should reach us not to despise the meanest of the crea∣tures of GOD, or the wickedest of men, who are still in a place of repentance. But the murderer does what in him lies to defeat the designs of GOD'S providence, and cut off the purposes of his will. True, he can ne∣ver effect this: <Q>GOD'S counsel shall stand, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations: For there is neither wisdom or device, or counsel against the Lord!</Q>—Yet no thanks to the murderer for this— who, in the rage or wantonness of his passions, cuts off a human creature, who, for all he knew or considered, might have been appointed by GOD to answer the no∣blest purposes, and to bring about the noblest designs in the world!</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="014137_0332_0F97D3F8B4A74368"/>
<Q>CRUEL and inhuman mother!—Knowest thou how useful, how worthy, how ornamental a member of society, that child might have proved, whom thou art now about to <HI>strangle</HI> or <HI>abandon</HI> to certain death;—to what honours, to what happiness, to what usefulness, to what degrees of future glory it might have been advanced!</Q>—<Q>Vile and <HI>savage barbarian,</HI> who, for the slightest provocation, or to gratify the most diaboli∣cal revenge, art just about to plunge the murderous steel into thy neighbour's bowels, or to level him to the earth by a leaden death!—Stop thy hand, till thou hast considered, That thou art now about to rob helpless children, of a father—a helpless wife, of her provider—the poor and needy, of a helper—his friends, of a friend, and the world, perhaps, of a more useful member of society than thy worthless self!</Q></P>
<P N="3">(3.) THE chief end and design of this world and state is, that men should prepare and provide for a bet∣ter, and an eternal world. Human life was given chiefly for this purpose, and would be worth nothing on any other supposition. I may even affirm it, with confidence, that it would be unworthy of the wisdom and goodness of GOD to create such a being as man, and to expose him to the many calamities and afflictions of this life, <HI>merely</HI> for the small portion of pleasure and happiness which he enjoys in it.</P>
<P>LIFE, <HI>human life,</HI> is a <HI>time</HI> and <HI>space</HI> of <HI>trial</HI> and <HI>proba∣tion</HI> for eternity. In this view of it, human life is an <HI>invaluable treasure,</HI> and every moment of it is of the <HI>ut∣most importance!</HI> For this purpose the Psalmist importu∣nately prays; <Q>LORD, cut me not off in the midst of my days; thy years are throughout all generations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cii. 24.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="334" REF="014137_0333_0F97D3F974730080"/>For this purpose we pray against <HI>sudden deaths;</HI> lest we should be hurried into eternity, and before the judg∣ment seat, with our sins upon us, and in an unprepar∣ed state.</P>
<P>BUT, now, the murderer robs us of all our precious time,—sends us suddenly and unexpectedly before the tribunal of GOD, without the possibility of a GOD <HI>have mercy;</HI> and, perhaps, plunges us, impenitent, into an everlasting hell of misery and despair!—O! <HI>what restitu∣tion</HI> can be made in this case! What reparation for this injury! If any guilt can look too big for divine mercy, it must be such guilt as this!</P>
<P>WHAT can <HI>our sorrow,</HI> what can <HI>our tears, what</HI> can <HI>even our blood</HI> do towards atoning such aggravated guilt as this? Can we redeem this soul from hell? Can we again give it a new state of trial and probation; or one hour wherein to work out its own salvation?</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THIS is a crime against <HI>humanity;</HI> a crime against all the soft, tender and sympathetic feelings of the heart! It speaks an infatuated understanding, a hard heart, a seared conscience!—A man must first kill him∣self as it were; do violence to all his feelings, as a man; have totally divested himself of his humanity before he could imbrue his hands in the blood of his fellow-crea∣ture, his neighbour, his friend, his brother of the hu∣man race.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) IT is a crime truly <HI>diabolical.</HI> The <HI>devil</HI> was a murderer from the beginning; and hence he is called <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apollyon,</HI> the <HI>destroyer. Envy, malice</HI> and <HI>re∣venge,</HI> from which murder springs, as from its proper source, are passions <HI>truly diabolical;</HI> and a man must in∣deed be a <HI>devil incarnate,</HI> before he can coolly premedi∣tate murder, and take pleasure, or enjoy gratification, in spilling innocent blood. And this is the infamous glo∣ry of those, who scruple not to declare, that <HI>revenge is
<PB N="335" REF="014137_0334_0F97D3FA34683E98"/>sweet!</HI> If there be, indeed, a pleasure in this kind of revenge, it is truly the pleasure of a devil, and perhaps the only species of pleasure of which a devil is ca∣pable!</P>
<P N="6">(6.) GREAT and <HI>horrible</HI> as the crime of murder is <HI>in itself,</HI> yet there are many circumstances which may ex∣ceedingly aggravate and increase its guilt; from the time when, and place where it is committed; from the persons upon whom, and deliberate manner in which it is perpetrated. Perhaps it was a poor innocent, a help∣less infant! Perhaps it was an aged, indulgent father, or the child of our bowels! Perhaps it was a brother, or a friend who sticketh closer than a brother, and whom we ought to have protected at the hazard of life! Perhaps it was done deliberately, in cold blood, after long premeditation, and for some slight provocation, or upon some mere punctilio of honour! Perhaps it was the father of a family, whose helpless children depended wholly upon his life for their support! These, and a num∣ber of other circumstances, render this crime exceedingly heinous.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE aggravated guilt of murder farther appears from the light in which both the <HI>word of</HI> GOD, and the consciences of men, represent it. When <HI>Cain</HI> slew his brother <HI>Abel</HI>—<Q>The LORD said, what hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cryeth unto me from the ground. And now thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv.</NOTE>.—Your blood of your lives will I require, at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. ix.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="014137_0335_0F97D3FB4C93D170"/>
IT is a crime of a <HI>deep die,</HI> and of a <HI>crimson colour;</HI>—a <HI>land-polluting, land-defiling</HI> sin. <Q>Ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are, for blood it defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxi. 12,—15.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood: Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. iv. 2, 3.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>Ye know, (says the Apostle) that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 15.</NOTE>.</Q> And how earnestly does the Psalmist pray, <Q>Deliver me, O LORD, from blood-guiltiness<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. li.</NOTE>.</Q>—<Q>Surely, at the command of the LORD came this upon <HI>Judah,</HI> to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of <HI>Manasseh,</HI> and for the innocent blood which he shed: For, he filled <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> with innocent blood, which the LORD would not pardon<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xxiv. 3,4.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>THE heinousness of this crime is also manifest from <HI>those terrors of conscience</HI> which generally follow the com∣mission of it. How dreadful was the case of <HI>Cain?</HI> <Q>My punishment, (says he) is greater than I am able to bear;—from thy face shall I be hid, and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv. 14.</NOTE>.</Q>—How piercing is the lamentation of unhappy <HI>Lamech?</HI> <Q>Hear my voice, ye wives of <HI>La∣mech,</HI> hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt! If <HI>Cain</HI> shall be avenged seven fold, surely <HI>Lamech,</HI> seven∣ty
<PB N="337" REF="014137_0336_0F97D3FE3387ECD0"/>and seven-fold!</Q> (See how his terrors are multiplied, from a sense of his guilt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv. 24.</NOTE>!)—The same truth might be illustrated from the history of <HI>Joseph's brethren—of Da∣vid</HI>—of <HI>King Herod</HI>—of <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI>—of <HI>Judas</HI> the trai∣tor, and of many other murderers, in profane history. Indeed, it is very remarkable, that <HI>man-slayers</HI> are haunt∣ed with the most frightful terrors, which leave them lit∣tle ease or peace of mind; and that many of those who have perpetrated the most horrid murders, in the most secret manner, have been driven by these terrors, to <HI>be∣tray their guilt,</HI> to confess <HI>their crimes,</HI> and to die for them, rather than enjoy a life, wholly insupport∣able!</P>
<P>NOR, my friends, are these terrors <HI>vain things:</HI>—They have their ground in the very constitution of our nature, and in that moral law which GOD hath written on the human heart. They are <HI>peculiar</HI> to <HI>men,</HI> to <HI>moral agents, accountable creatures:</HI> And <HI>that</HI> GOD, who hath implanted them in the human breast, must be a <HI>liar</HI> and a <HI>deceiver,</HI> (with all reverence be it spoken) if these terrors have not an object in nature, and if they are not the forerun∣ners of future punishment! I should now, in the</P>
<P N="2">II. PLACE, shew you that this is a crime justly punish∣able by death. But indeed, this is a truth almost too obvious to need either <HI>proof</HI> or <HI>illustration.</HI> Surely, if there is any <HI>capital crime</HI> committed among men, <HI>murder</HI> is that crime. The divine law is express in the matter, and seems to insist on the death of the murderer, at the risk of the community, without leaving any room or plea for mercy. <Q>At the hand of every man's bro∣ther will I require the life of man: Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. ix. 6.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="338" REF="014137_0337_0F97D3FEB6E50E08"/><Q>He that smiteth a man that he die, he shall surely be put to death.—He shall have no refuge.—Thou shalt even take him from mine altar, that he may die<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxi. Lev. xxiv.</NOTE>. Ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer; but he shall be surely put to death. Ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; it can∣not be cleansed of the blood shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Deut. xix. Exod. xxi.</NOTE>.</Q>—The most barbarous nations, even from the light of nature and reason, have always deemed murder worthy of death—as appears from the history of <HI>Jonah</HI> and the <HI>mariners</HI>—and the <HI>Bar∣barians</HI> of the island <HI>Melita,</HI> who, when they saw a viper fasten on the hand of <HI>Paul,</HI> said, <Q>No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xxviii. 4.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE same passions and barbarity of temper which have led a man to commit <HI>one murder,</HI> may lead him to commit many;—and such are the dreadful conse∣quences of this crime, that it would be dangerous to spare the life of such a criminal, unless we could be as∣sured of his true conversion, which is a matter not easi∣ly ascertained: And therefore no security could be given to society, for his future good behaviour.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that above all crimes, <HI>murder</HI> seldom goes unpunished even in this life; Providence often strangely so ordering it that those who have com∣mitted this crime in the most <HI>secret manner,</HI> have frequent∣ly been discovered by the most surprising means, and brought to condign punishment, often many years af∣ter the commission of the fact.</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, <HI>my brethren,</HI> murder is such an atro∣cious crime, and condemned by the laws of GOD and
<PB N="339" REF="014137_0338_0F97D3FF83C07AD0"/><HI>man</HI> to so shameful and ignominious a punishment; how careful ought we to be, both as <HI>men</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> to mortify such <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>tempers,</HI> and shun such <HI>practices</HI> as tempt and lead to it?—To <HI>expose these,</HI> therefore, in a practical manner, and to caution my hearers against them, is the</P>
<P N="3">III. AND last head of discourse proposed.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN let us set a strict watch <HI>over our hearts,</HI> in their very inmost thoughts, desires and <HI>movements. Out of the heart,</HI> says the wise man, <HI>are the issues of life.</HI> This is the <HI>cockatrice's nest,</HI> where all the viperous brood of malignant passions are hatched and brought forth. How often has an unfriendly thought, harboured there, boiled up into malice and broke out into <HI>murder?</HI>— We are apt to think little of anger, and freely to in∣dulge it: With <HI>Jonah,</HI> we think we do well to be an∣gry: We let the sun go down on our wrath—and keep it from day to day, from week to week, and from month to month, fermenting in our bosoms: We call to mind every circumstance that may aggravate our wrath, and brood upon it in our minds night and day, 'till it rankles and festers into malice—never considering, that anger and malice are the very <HI>seeds of murder</HI>— nay, that they are <HI>murder</HI> itself in GOD'S account, and by the determination of the gospel of CHRIST!—What says Christ? <Q>Ye have heard, that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill: But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment: And whosoever shall say unto his brother, <HI>Raca</HI> shall be in danger of the council: But whosoever shall say, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 21, 22.</NOTE>.</Q> We are commanded to be angry and not sin; and cautioned not
<PB N="340" REF="014137_0339_0F97D40034A4D268"/>to let the sun go down upon our wrath!—But alas! How difficult a duty is this? And yet how important: How quickly does anger degenerate into ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce and envy? And how often do these malignant passions break out into rage, and end in <HI>bloodshed</HI> and <HI>murder</HI> itself! Of what importance is it, therefore, that we should keep the heart with all diligence, and crush and stifle those seeds of <HI>murder</HI> there, before they become un∣governable and <HI>bring forth fruit unto death?</HI>—How dan∣gerous is an <HI>irrascible temper?</HI> And therefore the wise man counsels, <Q>Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go; lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 24.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>From within, (says our Saviour) out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murderers, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses;—these are the things which defile a man<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. xv. 18,19,20.</NOTE>.</Q> This is the source of all corruption; the fountain and origin of all the out∣ward evils of the life, which sendeth forth ini∣quity, as a fountain sendeth forth its waters. Of what importance is it, therefore, to <HI>watch over the heart,</HI> and to have <HI>this fountain of the life cleansed</HI> and <HI>purified</HI> by grace! Were men at any pains with their <HI>hearts</HI>—would they look into these <HI>chambers of imagery,</HI> and put a stop to the workings of iniquity there;—would they give no quarter, no indulgence, to the sensual and malignant pas∣sions, but instantly <HI>crush</HI> and <HI>exterminate</HI> them as they rise in the imagination, and check the thought of wick∣edness, which is sin; and, while they attempt this, would they <HI>pray for</HI> GOD'S <HI>help,</HI> and that he would cre∣ate in them a clean heart, and renew a right frame of spi∣rit within them, they would have few out-breakings of sin in their lives.—But just the reverse of this is the
<PB N="341" REF="014137_0340_0F97D400F8537EA0"/>case of sinners; they not only totally neglect the go∣vernment of the heart, but freely invite evil thoughts into it, and fondly cherish them there; so that their hearts are like <HI>the sluggard's garden,</HI> a nursery of eve∣ry poisonous and noxious weed, and over-run with all the <HI>sensual</HI> and <HI>malignant</HI> passions. <Q>Whosoever hateth his brother, (says St. <HI>John</HI>) is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abid∣ing in him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 11.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. AVARICE, or <HI>covetousness,</HI> is often the cause of mur∣der. <Q>The love of money, hath, in this respect, been the root of much evil—which, while many have coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tim. vi. 7,—10.</NOTE>.</Q> Many of the <HI>wholesale murders</HI> committed under the pre∣text of war—and most of the <HI>private murders</HI> committed in robberies, have sprung from this source.</P>
<P>AHAB committed this kind of murder on <HI>Naboth,</HI> for his vineyard. A king covets a neighbouring state, and sends his soldiers to murder the inhabitants, the rightful proprietors, that he may possess it: And yet <HI>this</HI> shall be sanctified by the name of <HI>a lawful war,</HI>—and the <HI>murderers</HI> who fall in the attempt, shall be said to <HI>die in the bed of honour;</HI> and the <HI>chief murderer,</HI> who set them on, shall be called a <HI>mighty hero!</HI> And his name shall shine in the annals of history! But that GOD who sit∣eth on the throne of the universe, and is the avenger of innocent blood, seeth his guilt and shall repay it.—If the poor wretch, who, under a sense of provocation, taketh away the life of his neighbour, shall be deemed a murderer—What shall we think of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> and many other doughty <HI>heroes</HI> since their time, who have shed the blood of many <HI>millions</HI> of innocent men,
<PB N="342" REF="014137_0341_0F97D401B44564B8"/>merely through <HI>avarice,</HI> or in the wantonness of their <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>ambition,</HI> to acquire the fame of <HI>mighty conque∣rors?</HI>—What shall we think also of those, who, under a pretence of religion, have shed tuns of Christian blood, by <HI>inquisitions, racks, faggots,</HI> and every cruel invention of persecution, both heathen and antichristian?—Is it easy to find a name for these <HI>wholesale murderers?</HI> But the souls of them who were slain, are crying from under the altar, <Q>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi. 9.</NOTE>?</Q> And verily GOD will hear their cry; for vengeance belongeth unto him, and he will repay it! Let us therefore beware of covetousness, ambition and superstition, which so often lead to blood-guilti∣ness!</P>
<P N="3">3. DRUNKENNESS often <HI>leads to, and ends</HI> in the sin of murder. What says the Wise Man? <Q>Who hath wo? Who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babblings? Who hath wounds without cause? They that tarry long at the wine; for at last it biteth like a <HI>serpent</HI> and stingeth like an <HI>adder</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 29,—32.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>While they are drunken as drunkards, (says <HI>Naham</HI>) they shall be devoured as stubble sully dry.</Q>— <Q>Wine is a mocker, (says <HI>Solomon</HI>) strong drink is a raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby, is not wise.</Q> How many unnatural quarrels; wounds without cause, and even murders, have been the conse∣quences of intoxication? And, indeed, what else can we expect, when the understandings of men are extinguished, their passions enflamed, and their reason dethroned? in such a situation as this, to what lengths of excess may not men go? Or what is to restrain them from committing the most atrocious crimes?—The light of reason <HI>is put
<PB N="343" REF="014137_0342_0F97D40274DD43A0"/>out;</HI> the judgment is all <HI>darkness</HI> and <HI>confusion;</HI> and the passions, like a boisterous sea, are all in a rage and fer∣ment! They have no guide; no guard; no director! Their words and actions are all at random; and are more likely to have a bad than a good direction.</P>
<P>INDEED, the generality of <HI>private murders,</HI> are owing more or less to this cause. Ought not this, therefore, to be better than a thousand arguments <HI>for sobriety,</HI> and <HI>against drunkenness?</HI> Can we possibly be over cautious against an excess, which <HI>unmans us,</HI> which deprives us of the guidance of reason, proves a <HI>stimulus</HI> to all the pas∣sions, and renders us the dupe of every temptation, and liable to commit the greatest and most destructive crimes?—How many thousands are there this day in the world, who have suddenly committed such crimes in their liquor, in a drunken, unguarded moment, as have ruined themselves and their families, and as they never would probably have thought of in sobriety?</P>
<P>WE have reason to tank GOD, indeed, that this vice is not very common amongst us. But surely we can∣not guard too much against it. The</P>
<P N="4">4. AND last source of murder which I shall mention, is the <HI>false notions of honour and shame,</HI> which prevail in the world; and it is the <HI>devil's</HI> interest to maintain them and keep them up in the minds of men, as they contribute so largely to the peopling of his kingdom.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fear of shame</HI> has drove many unhappy mothers, to commit the most unnatural and barbarous of all murders, upon the <HI>fruit of their own bodies</HI>—their smil∣ing, helpless infants?—A dread of the imputation of cowardice, from the meanest and vilest part of the human species, has driven many a man to commit mur∣der upon his neighbour, or to expose himself to the same fate, against every dictate of reason, humanity, charity, and even self-preservation.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="014137_0343_0F97D4033560C798"/>
How many men deem themselves as much in <HI>honour</HI> and duty bound, to take away a man's life, who, in passion, would <HI>give them the lie,</HI> (when, perhaps, it was only giving them their due!)—as to perform any duty of justice, charity or mercy! And what is very re∣markable, <HI>these men of honour,</HI> these <HI>heroes of the point,</HI> are often persons of the most <HI>infamous principles,</HI> and of the most <HI>insolent</HI> and <HI>provoking</HI> behaviour; so that those who converse with them, are under the sad dilemma, either of treating them with a respect which they by no means deserve; or, of being run through the body, for telling them a <HI>naked,</HI> and oftentimes a <HI>seasonable</HI> truth!</P>
<P>AND yet the person who, from Christian principles, or from the principle of self-preservation, would decline this way of determining a point of honour, must lose the esteem of the world, and be posted and stigmatized as a <HI>coward!</HI></P>
<P>How many murders have had their rise from a word misunderstood, from an affront never designed, or from other punctilios so trifling, as not to deserve the smallest degree of resentment?</P>
<P>To conclude. Would we be removed at the great∣est possible distance from the commission of this heinous and atrocious crime,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) LET us labour to obtain a <HI>sound conversion!</HI> Let us pray that GOD would give us a <HI>new heart</HI> and a <HI>right frame of spirit;</HI> that he would root out of our heart eve∣ry bitter root of <HI>malice, envy</HI> and <HI>revenge,</HI> and that he would implant, in their stead, the principles of <HI>humanity, mercy, meekness, patience</HI> and <HI>Christian charity;</HI> that we may <HI>do justly, love mercy</HI> and <HI>walk humbly</HI> with our GOD!</P>
<P N="2">(2.) LET us keep a strict watch and guard over our <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>appetites;</HI> those lusts which war against the soul, and hurry it no to every species of excess.</P>
<P>AND while we watch, let us <HI>pray</HI> that we enter not into temptation; that GOD would, by his grace, keep
<PB N="345" REF="014137_0344_0F97D403F44A5A40"/>us from falling; and powerfully <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>uphold</HI> us in every time of need. And,</P>
<P>LASTLY; let us shun evil company, which is often the occasion of these sins. <Q>Evil communications cor∣rupt good manners.</Q></P>
<P>THE mischiefs which have arisen from evil company, and the snares which men have been brought into by it, are innumerable. <Q>Blessed is the man, that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful, (says <HI>David</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. i.</NOTE>). He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. My son, (says <HI>Solomon</HI>) if sinners entice thee, consent thou not: walk not thou in the way with them: Re∣frain thy foot from their path: For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men: Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it and pass away: For they sleep not unless they have done mischief.</Q></P>
<P>MAY GOD sanctify these instructions of his word to us, and make them <HI>operative on our hearts,</HI> and <HI>fruitful in our lives,</HI> through the power and Spirit of CHRIST. Amen.</P>

<P>☞ The Author begs leave to return thanks to all his Subscribers, for the genteel encouragement they have given him; but more especially, to the inhabitants of St. Croix, of all denominations, who have subscribed for not less than 450 books; which is, indeed, but one among many instances of respect and civility he has received from them since his residence among them. He heartily wishes the work was more wor∣thy of their acceptance, and hopes, that his distance from the press will apologize for any little errors or inaccuracies which may appear in the work.</P>
