<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BLOOD calls for BLOOD.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the People of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends, and Fellow-Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET me conjure you by all you hold dear, here and hereafter, by all the ties of nature and justice, to rouse in defence of your persecu∣ted brethern and fellow subjects in America, who daily fall innocent victims to lawless power: let me intreat you to rouse in defence of your rights and liberties; those rights and liberties which heaven gave, and for which your fathers bravely fought, and gloriously fell, to preserve themselves and their posterity free; be assured if bleeding America can be reduced to slavery, all the boasted privileges of Englishmen must fall with her: let me therefore beseech you to oppose with uplifted hands, and streatched out arms, the cruel, bloody, &amp; unnatural Tyranny of George the third, and his diabolical Tory minions: Perdition, destruction, and all the miseries of a tortured death, attend the wretch, who calls
<PB N="182" REF="013988_0002_0F9258099E8EB160"/>himself an Englishman, and yet can tamely see his brother, or fellow subject, perish through wanton cruelty, oppression or the sword.</P>
<P>No tyrant was ever more despotic and cruel than the present Sovereign, who disgraces the seat of royalty in the British empire; no Court ever more corrupt than his, and yet, O my countrymen, to this merciless and despotic tyrant, and to his wicked and corrupt ministry, you sacrifice your rights, and yield a peaceable submission.</P>
<P>Consider the gloomy, the dreadful prospect before you, the plains of America are running with the blood of the inhabitants, her essence of the English constitution destroyed, and nothing but the form, the mere shadow of it remains; all the dear bought liberties, purchased and sealed with the blood of your forefathers, wrested from you by the polluted hands of an abandoned set of miscreants, supported and defended by a royal tyrant; and a dark cloud of slavery, like a rising tempest; overspreads the land, it approaches swiftly, and at this moment threatens our destruction; it is therefore high time you should be roused and awakened to a sense of your danger, and by an appeal to heaven, by a glorious resistance, provide for your common safety.</P>
<P>This is the only way, we have no other, to pre∣vent the ruin that threatens us, if we are inattentive or inactive at this time, our chains will be fast ri∣vetted, and liberty must expire; your petitions and remonstrances have been spurned by the King, and you have now no remedy left but that of entering
<PB N="183" REF="013988_0003_0F92580A50A26C40"/>into an ASSOCIATION in defence of your com∣mon rights, and the rights of America. They have set you a noble example, an example worthy of Britons, an example which you are bound by all the principles of justice and self-preservation to follow: he must be blind that is not convinced of this, and he is an abandoned wretch, an enemy to mankind, who will not persue the road.</P>
<P>Upon your virtue and resolution at this juncture, depends the salvation of England and America; it is now in your power to prevent the farther pro∣gress of despotism, the butchery of your fellow∣countrymen, and yourselves from slavery and ruin.</P>
<P>When the humble supplications of an oppressed people are treated with contempt, and a deaf ear turned to their complaints, when their rights are daily invaded, their property unlawfully wrested from them, and their blood inhumanly shed, it is incumbent on them, it is a duty they owe to God and their country, to take the field and resist their oppressors, to shew themselves brave, when bra∣very is required, and dare to be resolute in the hour of danger. Remember, my fellow countrymen, our predecessors led the way, the Americans have followed their noble example, and we are bound to follow them. Where would have been Liberty and Property, if it had not been for the virtue, bravery, and resolution of our ancestors? They stood forth in the glorious cause, and many of them secured it to posterity with their blood. Shall we then, tamely submit to have those privileges for which they fought and fell, ravished from us by a
<PB N="184" REF="013988_0004_0F9258F58CDF49C0"/>lawless tribe of men, who call themselves Senators or Ministers, and who taking advantage of their Prince, are laying waste their country, and spread∣ing desolation through the land? Shall it be said in after times, that the year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy Five, was less glorious than that of Sixteen Hundred and Eighty Eight; and that as the age grew more and more enlightened, it become more and more pusillanimous. Forbid it Heaven!</P>
<P>Let me intreat you O! Englishmen, to rouse from that state of supineness in which you have so long lain; open your eyes to the danger that sur∣rounds you, and stand forth the defenders of Ame∣rican virtue and public liberty. Havoc is now the cry at St. James's, and the dogs of war are let loose to tear out the vitals of our brethern; Ameri∣ca through the abandoned cruelty of an accursed administration, and an unrelenting King, is become a field of blood, overspread with desolation and slaughter. It is in your power to put an end to this horrid, unnatural civil war, it must owe its extinction or continuance to you, if you are virtuous, brave, and resolute, the lives, liberties, and properties of your fellow subjects, may be preserved, and your country saved from destruction; if on the contrary, you should be irresolute and pusillanimous at this time, (unworthy the name of Englishmen) thou∣sands, many thousand lives must be lost; the liber∣ties of England will be no more, and your proper∣ty taken from you at the will and pleasure of the King and his ministers.</P>
<P>It can only be from the virtue and united efforts of
<PB N="185" REF="013988_0005_0F9258F5C26330D8"/>England and America, that the constitution of Great-Britain, and all our invaluable privileges can be preserved; should you remain quiet spectators of the present inhuman Massacrees, and destructive measures, you will deserve the worst of slavery, and the cruelest punishment ever inflicted on a people.</P>
<P>If you have any honour, if you have any virtue, or any bravery, you will now stand forth and resist the tyrants, you will demand the heads of those men, who advised those sanguinary, fatal, and ruinous measures; you will declare to the world, you will not consent to arbitrary invasions of your liberties, arbitrary dispensing with the laws, and ar∣bitrary governing by an army; that you owe no submission to a King, beyond the bounds of law; that your lives, liberties, and estates, shall not be disposed of at his pleasure, and that you are bound by the laws of God and man, to resist a tyrant; that you will oppose all unjust violence, and those who attempt the life of the constitution, as the great enemies of their country; this has been prac∣tised in all ages, and all nations determine, that when Kings invade the lives, liberties, or properties of their subjects, that tear up the foundation of public freedom, and the sacred constitution of their coun∣try, may be resisted, either by calling in and join∣ing with foreign assistance, or by taking arms in defence of the law and common liberty; this is what was declared at the Revolution, and this is the foundation upon which the people took arms in the time of Charles the first.</P>
<P>The axe is now at the root of the tree; the
<PB N="186" REF="013988_0006_0F9258F6803A8860"/>overthrow of the Constitution is the great design of the King and his ministers, the open and avowed enemies to the rights of mankind, who have already sufficiently proved to the world, that they mean the subversion of the universal right of Christians and subjects. Let those, my countrymen, who plead for tyrants, submit to their power; but let us esteem liberty, religion, and property, equally with our lives, every man's birthright by nature; no go∣vernment ever received a legal authority to abridge or take it away; nor has God vested any single or confederated power in any hands to destroy it; and it is in defence of these glorious priviledges, these common rights, I have written this paper, and to preserve them unviolated by the polluted hands of lawless tyrants, I would lay down my life, for life is a burthen in any other state but that of freedom.</P>
<P>It is notoriously known, notwithstanding all the royal and ministerial falshoods which have been, and are daily advanced, to our disgrace, it is known that we do not enjoy, undiminished, one single priviledge purchased by the blood of our ancestors, and confirmed to us by Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights. Every man then, who remains passive at this time, is an enemy and a traitor to his coun∣try. I loose all kind of patience when I reflect up∣on the melancholy situation of England and Ameri∣ca, and the villainous principles of those men, in∣trusted by the sovereign with the management of the affairs of this once great, free, and powerful kingdom, I am fired with a just indignation against the authors of our misfortunes; and if I appear too warm, I hope it will be imputed to my zeal in the
<PB N="187" REF="013988_0007_0F9258FB1F1EFAE0"/>public cause, and not to any malice or resentment, against individuals, for I here declare to have none, but I most sincerely wish to stop the further effusion of human blood, and would willingly sacrifice my life, could I rescue my country from the hands of particides and traitors, and from that destruction which now threatens it.</P>

<P><HI>The necessity, utility, and national advantage of a political paper in defence of the natural rights of man∣kind at this important aera, must appear greater than at the last glorious Revolution, We now see, and with infinite concern, the King and Ministry, the Lords and Commons, all united, and firmly resolved, on per∣suing measures, which (without a noble opposition from the people) must end in the destruction of the laws, rights, and liberties, of the whole British empire, in England and America. It is therefore only necessary to say, this paper will be carried on by two gentlemen of literary abilities, alike enemies to the arbitrary ef∣forts of ONE, or a purchased majority of FIVE HUNDRED and FIFTY EIGHT TYRANTS, to whom they, and they hope, their fellow subjects, never will submit.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The CRISIS will be continued with spirit, in defiance of every exertion of lawless power, upon the true principles of the constitution, against the secret na∣chinations, and despotic designs, of the present corrupt
<PB N="188" REF="013988_0008_0F9258FC84875CE0"/>court and ministry. The authors being determined, even at the risk of every thing that is dear to man, to rescue the liberty of the press, the natural rights of mankind, and the constitution of the British empire, in England and America, from that ruin, with which they are now threatened. In order with more ease to accomplish these great ends, they earnestly beg the assis∣tance of those, who are real friends to the laws, liber∣ties, and constitution of their country.</HI></P>
