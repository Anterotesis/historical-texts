<P>CONVINCED that the Treaty of Commerce with Great-Britain conceded important principles, which ought never to have been relinquished; the Writer of these Sheets supposes, that it ought not to be implicated, by an unjust and irrational construc∣tion, upon the supposition, that the UNITED STATES have it not in their power to reciprocate the Disadvantages of their Commerce with GREAT-BRITAIN. Conceiving this not to be the case, nor to have been intended, but that the UNITED STATES are at full Liberty to place it upon the footing of Reciprocity, provided the Regulations, necessary thereto, extend to every other Nation, the following Observations are most respectfully submitted, by</P>

<HEAD>OPINIONS RESPECTING THE COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE <HI>Vnited States</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A GREAT fundamental principle of action, applying to national intercourse and transac∣tions of every kind, whether commercial or not, is, that one nation should not injure another: that national conduct should, upon all occasions, be frank and sincere; or that whatever might be the relative power, there should be no aim to over-reach, or to obtain unequal or improper advantages. The writers upon the law of nations agree in this great principle, as springing from the law of nature. From whence they infer, that treaties made, and to be kept, should have equality for their basis, let what may be the state and condition of the contracting parties; for as superiority of power creates no obli∣gation, or right, "so power or weakness," says Vat∣tel, "does not, in this respect, produce any differ∣ence." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel, book 1. chap. 1. page 18.</NOTE> Equal treaties then, founded on equal rights, and conferring equal benefits, are alone obli∣gatory by the law of nations. "Treaties equal," says Vattel, "are those in which the contracting par∣ties promise the same things, or things that are equiv∣alent;
<PB N="8" REF="031857_0005_0FEF21A094FC5C38"/>
or, in short, that are equitably proportioned, so that their condition is equal. Equal treaties may be subdivided into as many kinds as the sove∣reigns have different transactions between them. Thus they treat of the conditions of commerce,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel, book 2. chap. 12. sect. 172.</NOTE> &amp;c. "Nations not being less obliged than individuals, to have regard for equity, they ought, as much as possi∣ble, to preserve equality in their treaties; when, therefore, the parties are in such a state, as to obtain the <HI>same reciprocal advantages,</HI> the law of nature re∣quires their treaties should be equal, at least, if there is not some particular reason to deviate from that equality, such as gratitude for a former benefit,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vattel, book 11. chap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. sect. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> &amp;c. Unequal treaties, says the same author, are those in which the allies do not promise the same things, and where the conditions of commerce, or whatever may the objects of the treaty, are unequal.</P>
<P>To apply the foregoing observations, drawn from the law of nations, to a particular article of the Brit∣ish treaty, to determine its meaning and construction, it may not be improper, in the first place, to recite the 14th article of the treaty at large, and then to in∣quire, whether there is not sufficient latitude, in its construction, to justify such additional regulations of commerce, as shall give that protection and support to the commerce and navigation of the United States, which reciprocity demands.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>14th ARTICLE.</HEAD>
<P>There shall be between all the dominions of his Majesty in Europe and the territories of the United States, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of Com∣merce and Navigation. The people and inhabi∣tants of the two countries respectively shall have liberty, freely and securely, and without hindrance and molestation, to come, with their ships and car∣goes, to the lands, countries, cities, ports, places and rivers, within the dominions and territories
<PB N="9" REF="031857_0006_0FEF21A22A61E250"/>
aforesaid, to enter into the same, to resort and to remain and to reside there, without any limitation of time: also to hire and possess houses, and ware∣houses, for the purposes of their commerce; and generally the merchants and traders, on each side, shall enjoy the most complete protection and secu∣rity for their commerce; but subject always, as to <HI>what respects this article, to the Laws and Statutes of the two countries respectively.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>If the stipulation of a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce and navigation herein made, as well as the protection and security promised to the mer∣chants and traders on each side, is not sufficiently ex∣plicit, when it is declared, as to what respects the ar∣ticle, to be always subject to the laws and statutes of the two countries respectively; should it be made a question, whether a general stipulation, under as gen∣eral an exception, as to the laws and statutes of the two countries, shall be construed to preclude the Le∣gislature from making laws and statutes, which are necessary to procure the reciprocity guarantied, or such laws and statutes as are founded in reciprocity and equality; and in the policy and practice of one of the contracting parties, the British? or whether it ought to be supposed, that the other contracting party (the United States) should be tied down under the general stipulation, and not allowed to protect its citizens and commerce against foreign interference? or whether a perfect liberty of commerce and naviga∣tion ought to be granted on one side, against a very imperfect one on the other? or, in other words, whether the affected perfect liberty conferred by the treaty, marred by restrictions and prohibitions, ought to reciprocate few, or no advantages on the one hand, whilst the most perfect liberty, common to every cit∣izen of the United States, is allowed on the other, with the exception of an extra tonnage duty upon foreign vessels, and an addition of one tenth to the amount of the impost accruing upon their cargoes?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031857_0007_0FEE935263F45498"/>If such a construction is admitted, there is no room left on which legislation can exercise its powers; all future laws and statutes of the two countries being necessarily contravened. And although British mer∣chants and traders might introduce practices injurious to the rights and interests of the merchants and citi∣zens of the United States, they would not be amen∣able to laws made posterior to the treaty; and of course there might be a set of foreigners, under the privileges of a general protection, committing inju∣ries to the commerce of the country beyond the reach of legislative remedy.</P>
<P>If this construction was the one designed, why was the exception made as to the laws and statutes of the two countries? Was it to ratify and confirm British navigation acts, and the restrictions and prohibitions of British statutes on the one side, and to leave no means to reciprocate such disadvantages on the other?</P>
<P>If this was intended, why was it not declared; and that no future laws or statutes should be made to limit or restrain the liberty therein given; in which case, with what view, or to what purpose, was the succeeding, the 15th article, made?</P>
<P>The 15th article appears to be but an exception or a proviso to the 14th; or if it is not, it has neither meaning nor signification: For if the legislative power was to be controled, in future, by the pro∣visions of the preceding article, of what consequence was it to stipulate, that "no other or higher duties <HI>shall</HI> be paid by the ships and merchandizes of the one party, in the ports of the other, than such as are paid, by the like vessels, on merchandize of all other na∣tions"? or that "no other, or higher duty, should be imposed in one country, on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of the other, than are, or <HI>shall be payable</HI> (mark this ex∣pression) on the importation of the like articles, being of the growth, produce or manufacture of any other foreign nation"? Or of what import are the follow∣ing
<PB N="11" REF="031857_0008_0FEF21AA70C95588"/>
words? <Q>Nor <HI>shall</HI> any prohibition be imposed on the exportation or importation of any article, to or from the territories of the two parties respectively, which <HI>shall</HI> not equally extend to all other na∣tions.</Q> The reply is, that the 15th article must become nugatory, and be without meaning or signi∣fication, if the unnatural construction aforementioned is admitted. The stipulation of the 14th article ap∣pears to guaranty a reciprocal liberty of commerce, and navigation, with protection and security to mer∣chants and traders; but subject to the laws and sta∣tutes of the two countries respectively; provided such laws and statutes shall conform to the provisions and limitations of the 15th article. Taking the two articles together, the constructions harmonize, and the legislatures of the two countries are left only un∣der the restraints of reciprocity, as to commerce and navigation; that in case either party should think it necessary to reciprocate what it should deem unequal, or disadvantageous, the regulations necessary therefor must extend to every other nation. This construc∣tion gives to the treaty its true meaning, and con∣forms to the law of nations, which exacts justice and equality, as the basis of commercial and political trans∣actions. It is presumed then, that the United States have a clear, obvious right to pass such laws and sta∣tutes as are necessary to equalize commercial advan∣tages, and to give protection and security to their cit∣izens against foreign interference.</P>
<P>Admitting the foregoing reasoning to be just, the next inquiry which arises out of our subject, is, What regulations does reciprocity require, on our part, to place the commerce of the two countries upon that footing of equality which wisdom on the one side, and a liberal policy on the other, ought to demand?</P>
<P>To permit commercial intercourse to take off the surplus productions, beyond what are necessary for home consumption, is a duty that nations owe to the
<PB N="12" REF="031857_0009_0FEF21ADD448E6D0"/>
welfare and happiness of each other; and the obliga∣tion is no less strong, that the exchanges should be founded in justice and equity; for the moral princi∣ple of nations does not permit unequal regulations of commerce; or, at least, if they are assumed, or pro∣cured through artifice or intrigue by the one party, it is made the duty of the other, by the law of na∣tions, to resist and to oppose them. In order then to examine the subject before us with clearness and pre∣cision, it is necessary to inquire,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What is the relative situation, in respect to commerce and navigation, arising out of the ex∣isting laws and statutes of the two countries re∣spectively? And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To suggest what measures are probably neces∣sary to place their commerce and navigation upon the footing of reciprocal and mutual ad∣vantage.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In treating the important subject herein undertaken, it is proper to premise, that what is aimed to be es∣tablished, rests as much upon facts, as deductions; upon commercial statements, as political inferences. The facts depended on, are the custom-house state∣ments of Great-Britain, and those official documents, and other references, which were thought sufficient data, on which to ground that system of rules and regulations, by which Great-Britain is, and has been guided in her commerce with this country. A re∣currence to the same facts and authorities, which, it is conceived, are the best the subject admits, cannot be deemed unfair, to shew the inequality and danger of the United States from such regulations, and the necessity of resisting and opposing them by counter regulations.</P>
<P>The first object of inquiry herein proposed, referring to the comparative benefits resulting from the com∣mercial and maritime regulations of the two coun∣tries, shall be considered under their distinct heads, as far as the nature of the subject will permit.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031857_0010_0FEF21AF5A6E8678"/>In the year 1783, the British Parliament, not know∣ing what might be the effect of the independence of the United States, in regard to the English commerce; the national resources and credit being reduced to a low state, and a general alarm being spread through the nation, for fear that the resentment of this country might transfer its commerce to other channels, gave a discretionary power to the king, by the advice of the privy council, to adopt such temporary regulations, in regard to the United States, as the interest of the na∣tion, and the new situation of the United States, might require. Accordingly the following order of the king and council passed 2d of July, 1783.</P>

<P>With respect to the regulations above recited, it is to be observed, that they were repeated the Decem∣ber following, and have been, from time to time, since continued, with little alteration in their principle, by acts which have passed, at every session of Parliament, authorizing his Majesty to make them; and they are now confirmed, with the approbation of the United States, in the ratification of the late treaty with Brit∣ain,
<PB N="15" REF="031857_0012_0FEF21B8CBF94AD8"/>
viz. in the 14th article aforementioned, which subjects the liberty of commerce, therein given, "to the laws and statutes of the two countries respectively." It is but justice to the treaty, however, to say, that the provisions of the 12th article, which were refused ratification by the United States, were intended as a mitigation to the injuries and inequalities of these reg∣ulations. The concessions therein made, by the Brit∣ish government, although unequal to the sacrifices, by the United States, in other parts of the treaty, might have been of some commercial advantage; but they were accompanied with such indignities to the freedom and independence of the country, in re∣lation to productions from the dominions of other states, that they could not be accepted.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to observe upon the detail, it will be proper to make a few observations upon the principle of the foregoing regulations.</P>
<P>They hold up an important distinction between the European and the other dominions of Great-Britain, in the allowance of commerce with the United States. If this distinction was proper, why did it not go fur∣ther, and extend the same restriction to Ireland, which is no more than a British colony; or to Scotland or Wales, or to all of them; for there would have been equal propriety in extending the restrictions further, even to all the British dominions, whether in Europe or elsewhere, which, it is believed, would have been most for the interest of the United States, as to have limited the restrictions to the English colonies only? In such case, the United States would have seen through the equity of the regulations, and governed themselves accordingly. As well might the United States say, that liberty of commerce should be grant∣ed to the subjects of Great-Britain, except with Vir∣ginia, South-Carolina and Georgia, and with them, so far as to permit the citizens of the United States to transport tobacco, rice, and naval stores to Great-Britain, if shipped in American bottoms, with liberty
<PB N="16" REF="031857_0013_0FEF21BA51208968"/>
to import into those states, in like bottoms, English manufactures, with the exception of woolen cloths, cottons, and some other principal British merchandiz∣es, which should be totally prohibited.</P>
<P>Whenever a nation sets up a principle of action, as a rule of commercial or political conduct, which is to operate upon the commerce or policy of other nations, it is becoming, that it should regard justice and equity, in relation to such nations with which she has political or commercial transactions. It is not sufficient for a nation to say, that she has colonies, which, because she has planted, she will wantonly exclude from other nations, and monopolize to herself their commerce and labour: nor is it sufficient, that this principle be fortified by the usages and practices of nations; or that Grotius, Puffendorf, Burlamaqui, and Vattel, implicitly or explicitly justify it. Two considerations, in their nature previous to the adoption of such a rule, enter into its exercise, and ought to make its principle; the first is, whether it is for the best interest of the parent state as connected with the least injury to the inhabitants of her colonies: and the second, whether it is for her best interest as connected with those advan∣tages she derives from the commerce of other states. Admitting the right of monopoly over colonies, in the most extensive sense that protection and power can give it, it does not follow, that the inhabitants of colonies have no claim upon the parent state, from situation and humanity, from circumstances and ex∣pedients, in procuring their own welfare, with the objects of their establishment: although the parent state is sovereign, and colonies should be subordinate; and should produce, say indefeasible right, on the one side; and absolute submission on the other; yet un∣necessary and cruel deprivations cannot be justified under such a claim. Their circumstances and situa∣tion, their internal and external relations, must pro∣duce a choice of means, which must designate the wisdom, justice and policy of the measures pursued.
<PB N="17" REF="031857_0014_0FEF21BD9C443C90"/>
To say then, that colonies have no rights, but such as are absorbed in the mere will of the metropolitan state, is absurd: nor less so, would it be to say, that it would be always for the interest of the metropolitan state to exclude foreigners from a participation in its colonial commerce; for such a regulation should arise rather from policy than right, and must depend upon the liquidation of advantages and disadvantages, in its commerce with other states: if the right is assumed, the policy may be denied, and the metropolitan state may become the loser from its assumption. In such case, it had been better to have adhered to the policy, rather than the right. The concurrence, then, of both the one, and the other, must be brought into view, to determine the fitness and propriety of such com∣mercial regulations. The right then rests precisely upon the same footing, which every independent country possesses, of regulating its own commerce, to extend, to limit, or totally to prohibit it, with foreign nations, leaving the same right to the nation affected by such regulations, which must, of necessity, at length reduce the right to a mere question of policy.</P>
<P>Let us examine then, whether right and policy concur, in the present case, to justify Great-Britain in excluding the citizens of the United States from a participation in the commerce and navigation of her West-India islands, admitting the right and power of retaliation in the United States, which shall hereafter be shewn.</P>
<P>Whenever we reflect upon what was the relative situation of the United States and the English West-India colonies, that we were the offspring of the same parent, established and protected by the same power, and nourished and cherished for the same purpose, viz. the aggrandizement of the British empire; without entering into the disputes which brought on the American revolution; suffice it to say, that there was, before the revolution, a close, intimate and beneficial commercial connection, which subsisted between the
<PB N="18" REF="031857_0015_0FEF21BF21F7D8B8"/>
English West-India islands and the now United States. Mutual wants and conveniences were its foundation, which contributed not less to the growth and prosperi∣ty of the then respective colonies, than to the opulence and grandeur of the mother country.</P>
<P>To sever and cut off a commercial intercourse, springing from situation, interwoven by habit, and cemented by so many ties of interest and convenience, ought to be justified by arguments of more solidity than the independence of the United States, or the mere right of monopoly over the trade and produce of colonies.</P>
<P>It is admitted, that the citizens of the two coun∣tries, by the sovereignty and independence of the United States, became aliens to each other, and that each country possessed, in a sense, the right of limit∣ing, restricting, or prohibiting its commerce, as it might deem best; yet, when a narrow, illiberal pol∣icy, bottomed upon resentment and disappointment, rather than its real interest, or the convenience or ad∣vantage of its colonies, became adopted into a system of commercial regulations, such a conduct, if proved, must deserve reprobation and reproach, and in the end will produce defensory measures, which shall re∣quite their injustice. Several of the states, in the year 1784, in their individual capacities, as well as the English West-India merchants and planters, made in∣effectual efforts to procure the repeal of these offensive regulations. The latter, that is, the English mer∣chants and planters, petitioned the English parliament, pointing out the injurious consequences of the regu∣lations of commerce to the West-India islands; that they were founded in ill policy and resentment, and would induce a retaliation on the part of the United States. The states of Virginia, New-York, New-Jer∣sey, and Maryland, passed resolutions upon the sub∣ject, considering them as aggressions upon the com∣merce of the states, and strongly recommending countervailing restrictions. The state of Massachu∣setts
<PB N="19" REF="031857_0016_0FEF21C49F668B30"/>
passed a navigation act, with an expectation it would have been followed by similar acts from the other states, which was to have been in force until Congress should have been empowered to regulate trade: but it not being seconded by any other state than Rhode-Island, it was repealed, for the want of a more general concurrence. Thus ended the prophe∣cies of retaliation by English writers, and West-India planters; and thus became fruitless, the individual attempts of several of the states to remedy the inju∣ries and cruelties of these pernicious regulations of commerce.</P>
<P>Mankind don't administer to the rights of others so much from duty as from fear; it is by retaliation, that nations must make their rights and interests re∣spected, when they are infringed. The United States, untaught by experience, and not having provided against the evils, which awaited their independence, for six years were laid under British commercial bon∣dage, and patiently suffered their navigation, com∣merce, and manufactures, to be almost cut up by the roots, for the want of those defensory restrictions, which were necessary to their protection. These in∣juries, sensibly as they were felt, had their attendant benefits; they afforded an instructive lesson to the honest unsuspecting politics of our country. Great-Britain, under the deceitful appearance of tendering to us the liberal hand of friendship and reconciliation, at the establishment of peace, disarmed us of our pru∣dence; and, by her commercial arrangements, even put to hazard the very independence for which we had contended, and achieved. The several states saw the evil, which was sapping their best interests, jealous of their sovereignties, and distracted by opposing sen∣timents, from the defect of the old organization of Congress; and from the necessity of a power to reg∣ulate commerce, the great actuating motive for the adoption of a Federal Constitution, the now Consti∣tution of the United States became accepted, and ap∣proved
<PB N="20" REF="031857_0017_0FEF21C9DD2E69C8"/>
by the people, trusting, that its result would produce a conduct from Great-Britain more conso∣nant to equity, and to those advantages she was daily deriving from the commerce of the United States. But English ministers, hitherto knowing the influence of language, habits, manners, fashions, and credits; knowing the difficulties and embarrassments attend∣ant on the altering of old channels of commerce; knowing her power to circumscribe her own mar∣kets, whilst ours were open to her manufactures; knowing the prejudicies and jealousies subsisting be∣tween the several states, she has even procured a pre∣ference in our own ports, through her merchants and factors, for the employment of her ships and vessels, to those of the United States: and the United States, for several years, exhibited a situation as novel as it was absurd; foreign ships and vessels finding in our ports ample and ready freights, whilst those of the United States, circumvented by British restrictions, were rotting at our wharves, for want of employ.</P>
<P>It is by the settled tendency of measures, rather than by professions and declarations, that we must judge of the friendship or enmity of nations: we need not recur, for instance, to the histories of either France or England, to know their enmity and hatred to each other: a recurrence to their laws, and to their rules of commerce, will sufficiently discover their pas∣sions and resentments, perhaps more strongly than the history of their battles. Accident, mistake, or occurrences, from a thousand circumstances, might produce temporary hostilities; but in the settled rules and regulations of their general and commercial pol∣icy, their hatred, their malice, and their rivalries, will be more fully designated: in like manner, if we re∣cur to the English regulations of commerce, adopted towards this country, in the face of the petitions and remonstrances of the most respectable English merchants and West-India planters, to point to their leading motives, <HI>we cannot doubt, that extreme selfishness,
<PB N="21" REF="031857_0018_0FEF21CB7922D8A8"/>
and a marked resentment against the United States general∣ly, and the New-England states in particular, for their manly conduct in the revolution, were the chief objects and end of their policy.</HI> Circumstanced and situated as the New-England States particularly were, at the close of the war, can the narrow, selfish, bigoted policy of a British minister be justified in denouncing their navi∣gation, fisheries, and commerce, by the most sudden, cruel and oppressive regulations? Is it possible, that the New-England states can have witnessed the ten∣dency of such measures, and observe them continued and persisted in, and yet be taught, as some amongst us affect to instruct us, that an English alliance ought to be courted and preferred to all others? if alliances with restrictions and prohibitions ought to be court∣ed; if they are marks of friendship, a New-England∣man might well ask, what are indications of enmity, short of open hostility? whilst he will apostrophize and say, From such friendship, and such regulations of commerce, good Lord deliver us!</P>
<P>But as it would be unwarrantable, and it is not my intention, to misrepresent, either the designs or the policy of the British government, it is fitting that the facts and statements, on which the foregoing suggestions are grounded, should be laid before the public.</P>
<P N="1">1. The citizens of the United States and their vessels were excluded commercial intercourse with the British West-India islands, whereby the employ∣ment of above thirty thousand tons of American shipping was totally interdicted, besides the disadvan∣tage of a great diminution, both in the vent of Amer∣ican productions, and in the supply of those of the West-Indies, which arose from confining the carrying trade, in both directions, to English vessels.</P>

British or American bottoms, viz. beef, pork, salted fish, whale oil, spermaceti candles, &amp;c. whereby the New-England states sustained an annual loss of vent or market for upwards of <Q>fifteen thousand barrels of beef and pork, two hundred and thirty thousand quintals of fish, about five hundred tons of whale oil,</Q> which, with the other articles of the growth and produce of the United States annually shipped to the English West-Indies, amounted, by the British ac∣counts, to not less than a million sterling, which not only supplied them with the produce of the English islands, viz. with <Q>three million six hundred thou∣sand gallons of West-India rum, three thousand hogsheads, fifteen hundred tierces and four thou∣sand barrels of sugar, one hundred and fifty thou∣sand gallons of molasses, with coffee to the amount of £50,000 sterling; cocoa, mahogany plank, pi∣menta, ginger, cotton wool, fustick, logwood, and lignum-vitae, to the amount of £. 60,000 sterling, besides a balance in cash of £.240,000 sterling.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Brian Edwards's pamphlet, respecting the trade of the West-India islands with the United States.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It was natural for the unsuspecting politics of the United States to suppose that Great-Britain had so much to gain, by permitting their commerce to take its old channels, and in the end, so much to lose, if they would not permit it, that the general balance of the whole trade was so much to the advantage of Great-Britain, by receiving an annual balance from the United States of above six hundred thousand pounds sterling, besides the immense advantage arising from the freightage of the produce of the United States, that she would not, under such circumstances, aim to proscribe her markets to American vessels; nor to carry into effect against them, her illiberal system of restrictions and prohibitions upon foreigners, and foreign vessels, to the disadvantage of any particu∣lar part of the commerce of the United States, especial∣ly of the New-England states: but in this, the United
<PB N="23" REF="031857_0020_0FEF21CE8F5402E0"/>
States have found themselves deceived, and Great-Britain has hitherto been able to support her narrow, selfish system of commercial regulations, unretaliated by the United States, through her machinations and intrigues, in the government of the United States.</P>
<P>But the necessity of revising the commercial system of the United States does not rest, merely, upon the English colonial arrangements, but must be considered in connection with her European system of commer∣cial policy; and in relation to the distinctions and disabilities, which the laws of England impose, between foreigners and British subjects.</P>
<P>Although merchant strangers enjoy important priv∣ileges in England, compared with those of some other countries of Europe, except Holland; that when friends, they have a constitutional right of residence, and a legal protection to their persons and properties, extending even to the right of holding real estate, when not to their own use, they are still under nu∣merous disabilities, and subject to peculiar impositions, which, although lessening, says Judge Blackstone, "from the commercial interest and policy of the nation," yet they create important distinctions be∣tween natives and foreigners, to the benefit of the one, and to the prejudice of the other. To these im∣positions, numerous as they are, say British ministers, the citizens of the United States became subject from their independence! and what rendered them the more injurious, was, that they had been the ground, and reason, on which the commerce of the United States had, in many cases, been predicated. A con∣spicuous example of the fact herein stated, well known to the people of New-England, is the alien duty of £.18-3 sterling per ton on foreign train oil, original∣ly intended, as it now continues to be, a prohibition upon its importation into England; whereby the employment of one hundred and thirty sail of our vessels, or thirteen thousand tons of shipping, in our whale fishery, was laid under such embarrassments,
<PB N="24" REF="031857_0021_0FEF21D660685360"/>
that it became nearly ruined before other channels of vent could be found <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To preserve the whale fishery of Massachusetts from total ruin, the state of Massachusetts, in the year 1785, was obliged to grant the follow∣ing bounties upon whale oil, viz. on white spermaceti oil, five pounds per ton; yellow ditto, three pounds; and common whale oil, 40 shil∣lings per ton; which were continued until the 1st of December, 1787: and on which were paid £. 10,293-3-10 Massachusetts currency.</NOTE>; and it has not, even at this period, arrived at its usual state of prosperity; not now employing more than forty ships of two hundred tons, or eight thousand tons of shipping; in conse∣quence of which, a remittance of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling in train oil, to pay for British manufactures, allowed <HI>free entry,</HI> was at once interdicted, and the country reduced to the necessity of finding therefor other means of payment.</P>
<P>Upon the same principle, American built ships were prohibited sale in British ports; or, what was the same thing, the prohibitions and restrictions of the English navigation act destroyed the English market for the sale of American built vessels, which, before the revolution, Great-Britain had been in the habit of purchasing, deriving, at least, two fifths of her ships and vessels from the built of America, amount∣ing to about two hundred and ten thousand tons, which, if renewed every seven years, the time allow∣ed, by British accounts, for the duration of American built vessels, an annual vent for thirty thousand tons of shipping became lost to the United States; which, if calculated at six pounds sterling per ton, including their sails and rigging, without reckoning their freight to England, amounted to one hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling. If we add to these injuri∣ous distinctions, the numerous restraints upon aliens, who may reside in England, for the purpose of carry∣ing on commerce, (the particulars of which may be seen by recurring to the English rate books), we shall find, that the privileges granted, by the 14th article of the British treaty, to the citizens of the United States, unless counter restrictions and prohibitions are
<PB N="25" REF="031857_0022_0FEF21D9FB7CD9F0"/>
adopted, can bear no comparison with the privileges conferred upon British subjects, residing in this coun∣try, independent of the restraints of the English navi∣gation act, of which I shall take more particular no∣tice hereafter.</P>
<P N="1">1. English merchants are allowed to import into England, many articles of merchandize, which are not permitted to merchant strangers.</P>
<P N="2">2. Numerous articles of merchandize are not per∣mitted to be uttered or sold, either by foreigners or British subjects.</P>
<P N="3">3. The exclusive privileges given to particular trading companies, such as the East-India Company, the Turkey Company, the Hudson-Bay Company, &amp;c. are further restraints upon the liberty of commerce.</P>
<P N="4">4. The prohibitions upon the exportation of raw materials, such as gold, silver, iron, brass, copper, lat∣tin, bell metal, pan metal, gun metal, shruff metal, tallow and raw hides, unwrought horns, wool, wool∣felts, mortlings, fuller's clay, pipe clay, and many other articles, the bases of manufactures, are among the restraints upon commerce.</P>
<P N="5">5. The qualified prohibition upon the following articles, which are only allowed to be exported when under a given price, or value, at the place of exporta∣tion, viz. gun-powder, wheat, rye, barley, malt, oats, beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. under the express exception, that when allowed, are only permitted to be exported in British bottoms.</P>
<P N="6">6. The absolute prohibition, upon the importation of most articles of manufactures from foreign coun∣tries, and of course, upon those of the United States, such as woolen cloths, shoes, goloshoes, hats, wool cards, &amp;c. some of which might be very advantage∣ously exported from this country to England.</P>
<P N="7">7. The importation into England of beef, pork, cattle, sheep, fish, &amp;c. important articles of export from the New-England states, are deemed a public nuisance, and are forfeited if offered for sale.</P>

<P N="9">9. The alien duties of scavage, package, and por∣terage, paid to the corporation of London, and to other cities in England, on goods exported therefrom.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>There are no less than nine distinct tables of prohibited articles in the English rate books, each containing a long list thereof, under the distinct heads of,

<P>In short, to enumerate the invidious distinctions between English subjects and foreigners, in relation to commercial advantages in Great-Britain, would be to transcribe some pages, at least, from their English rate books; and to take up more time and attention than is necessary for the present purpose: sufficient is it to say, that the acts and statutes of the English Par∣liament are well calculated to procure to the English merchants, the factorage upon foreign merchandizes, to exclude foreigners from participation in any of the advantages of her internal commerce, and to secure her markets, exclusively, to her own citizens, against foreign interference, by prohibiting such articles of foreign growth or manufacture, which interferes with her own. It is by recurring to the principles of these laws, and by carrying them into practice, that the United States will be able to obtain, promote, and secure their own prosperity, and at the same time, to retaliate the disadvantages they experience, from the selfish, commercial policy of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>If what has been already suggested, does not fully state the principles of the English regulations of com∣merce;
<PB N="27" REF="031857_0024_0FEF21E15575C640"/>
if the details produced, do not corroborate those principles, nor satisfactorily evince their injustice, and inequality, the annual balance of trade, in favour of Great-Britain, will give force to their tendency, and must convince every unprejudiced mind, that means more effectual, than those already devised, are necessary to place the commerce of the two countries upon a more equal footing than the one on which it now stands.</P>
<P>If there is a principle of commercial intercourse, which can neither be controverted by argument, nor denied with reason; if there is a predominating maxim, distinguished as a just rule of commercial transaction; it is, <HI>that a commerce is beneficial, or perni∣cious, in proportion to the balances paid and received by the respective countries carrying it on.</HI> The commercial intercourse between England and Russia, for example, has been the theme of much English Parliamentary discussion, if not of political lamentation and grief, in consequence of the annual balance of half a million sterling, paid in favour of Russia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Balance of trade in favour of Russia, against Great-Britain, in the year 1749, was 1,012,209 rubles, at 4s2 each,

The annual balance of two hundred and forty thou∣sand pounds sterling,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Brian Edwards's pamphlet on the commerce of the United States with the English West-India islands.</NOTE> in favour of the United States, in their commercial intercourse with the English West-Indies, was taken SINGLY, by the English minister, to determine the policy, of prohibiting and restricting the commerce of the United States to those islands; although, if taken collectively, into one com∣prehensive and liberal view, the concession of the West-India trade, and many others, in the European, would have been proper, on the part of Great-Brit∣ain; and even then, would not have been equiva∣lent to the immense advantages she derives from the commerce of the United States. Commerce is the
<PB N="28" REF="031857_0025_0FEF21E7D0AF54F0"/>
interchange of the products of one country, for those of another; the advantages are reciprocal, when the one receives as much of the other, as it gives of its own products in exchange; but if the exchanges are unequal, in proportion to their excess, they become beneficial to the one, and injurious to the other. From hence arise the advantages or disadvantages of the balance of trade, which, if insidiously or art∣fully procured on the one side, ought to be retaliated and counteracted on the other.</P>
<P>Among the several means which have been sug∣gested, to ascertain the balance of trade, between countries having commercial intercourse, two ways seem to have a preference; although these are not without their objections; the one is, by custom-house dockets; the other, by the price and value of bills of exchange. It appears, by the English state∣ment of imports and exports for the year 1773, that there was paid, by the United States to Great-Brit∣ain, a balance of £.610,184-12-5 sterling; viz.</P>

<P><PB N="30" REF="031857_0027_0FEF21EADFE246F8"/>It is observed, that much is to be inferred from the state and condition of the people, in relation to the general balance of trade; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Anderson on commerce.</NOTE> if the people are generally employed, and their affairs prosperous; if the several professions and callings find ready vent for their la∣bour, that such circumstances are a strong symptom of a favourable balance: but this is a suggestion very little to be depended on, as it has applied to the United States, since the adoption of the Federal Con∣stitution; for the renovation of public credit, by funding the debts of the United, and of the individual states, produced such an effect, by the introduction of near eighty millions of dollars into circulation, that the relation of personal to real property became sud∣denly altered, and thereby the means of industry ex∣tended, and the value of lands and other property greatly enlarged; but these circumstances were no evidence of a more favourable commercial relation to foreign nations; for the increase of wealth did not spring from industry, nor from new improvements in arts, manufactures, or commerce, but from the estab∣lishment of public credit, of banks, and from the cre∣ating of artificial capitals, on which were predicated some useful schemes, but many pernicious specula∣tions, injurious to commerce, manufactures and agri∣culture; and has hitherto added little or nothing to the advantage, or independence of the country, in re∣lation to foreign nations. But when we have had so unfavourable a balance, so immense in its amount, when applied to Great-Britain, that the demand for British manufactures, instead of relaxing, has acquired force, from our commercial policy: that the manu∣factures, which had grown up under the restrictions and prohibitions of the several states, had been grad∣ually expiring; whereby the intermediate relations between husbandmen and merchants have almost wholly subsided: that what had been called protect∣ing duties, whether arising from insufficiency in their
<PB N="31" REF="031857_0028_0FEF21EC696A10E8"/>
execution, or inadequacy in their provision, had af∣forded neither security nor protection; or from what∣ever cause, a plain, obvious fact is manifest; <HI>that the manufactures of the United States are now reduced to a lower state, than they have been at any former period.</HI> No doubt, some of those inconveniences are to be attri∣buted to the war in Europe; but it must be remem∣bered, that the inconvenience, attendant on the paper system of the United States, from the nature of it, was to reduce the value of specie, by causing an arti∣ficial repletion; the effect of which, was to raise the price of labour, and of the necessaries of life, and of course to discourage our own manufactures, by render∣ing their competition more favourable to foreigners.</P>
<P>The fitness and propriety of commercial intercourse depends on calculation, and minute investigation of advantages and disadvantages: To suppose that an object of such importance ought to rest merely on the casual, transient information of the members of a Legislature, would seem improper; or, at least, it has been deemed so, by the British nation, as long ago as Cromwell's time, (1665), when a board of commis∣sioners of trade and plantations was established; which, although afterwards laid down for a time, was revived in the year 1696, under the administration of King William. To this board, the British nation owes its principal commercial prosperity: its business has been, from time to time, to recommend altera∣tions in the trade laws; to state "favourable, or un∣favourable balances of trade, with foreign nations; and to receive proposals for the case and improvement of navigation, manufactures, and commerce." By the constitution of the board, it was to consist of mem∣bers, having a "<HI>thorough knowledge of the general state, history, and interests of commerce.</HI> How far an estab∣lishment of this sort, would be worth the considera∣tion of our government, is not the present inquiry, any further than to shew, that the navigation, man∣ufactures, and commerce of a country, and the pla∣cing
<PB N="32" REF="031857_0029_0FEF21F2CADB76F8"/>
them in a just relation to each other, and to for∣eign nations, are objects of the highest importance, demanding the attention of government, particularly in relation to the policy of such nations, with which we have unfavourable balances.</P>
<P>There are writers, among whom is Mr. Hume,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 5th essay, vol. 2.</NOTE> who have supposed, that the received, if not established opinions, in respect to balances of trade, were errone∣ous, and without foundation; and that such balances would find their own level: that the precious metals were no other than merchandize, which would have a value with regard to commodities, or other proper∣ty, in proportion to their plenty or scarcity: that if money was more plenty than other property, it would be of a less comparative value; and that if commodi∣ties, or other property, were plentier than money, that it would be of a comparative greater: that if a country had accidentally loft the greater part of its circulating medium, that the remaining quantity would still be a mean of transferring property, at a proportionably less price: and that, therefore, a nation had nothing to do, but to attend to its industry, and that trade would balance itself. However plausi∣ble and solacing this theory is, and however well in∣tended it may have been, for the people and times in which it was suggested, the government of England never thought the principle worthy of their atten∣tion, but aims at preserving a general balance in its favour; and considers every trade pernicious, which carries a balance against her; and the more so, in proportion to the increase of such balance. Professor Smith concurs, in some points, with Mr. Hume, in regard to balances of trade; but confesses, that there is a balance of <Q>produce, and consumption, which, as it happens to be either favourable or unfavour∣able, necessarily occasions the prosperity or decay of a nation;" "if the exchangeable value of the an∣nual produce," says this excellent writer, "falls short of the annual consumption, the capital of the
<PB N="33" REF="031857_0030_0FEF21FA44A88910"/>
society must annually decay in proportion to this deficiency. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith on the wealth of nations, vol. 2. chap. 3d. part 2d. page 208.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>But admitting Mr. Hume's position to be true, in an abstract view, it does not follow, that trade ought to be left to itself, and to the commercial impositions, that other nations may put upon it; for a commer∣cial law extends beyond the jurisdiction of the gov∣ernment making it: it may go to the denying, cur∣tailing, or extending the privileges of other nations; even to the giving a preference of one nation to an∣other. In proportion as such a law limits, restricts, or denies commercial intercourse to other nations, the assumed jurisdiction, if unretaliated, becomes per∣nicious and injurious. In this case, a commercial, may have the effect of a political law, operating either upon other nations generally, or to extend the power of one state, whilst it may be a mean of de∣pressing that of another: it may give advantages, with or without receiving equivalents; it may deny benefits, when more than equivalents are bestowed, if the nation receiving the disadvantages, will permit them: but if the restrictive operation of the law should be retaliated, as it ought to be, the commercial inter∣course might diminish, or be suspended for a time, until both parties should find it convenient to make mutual concessions. Since, by regulating trade then, it may be so contrived, as to produce favourable or unfavourable balances, so a nation, for the most part, paying an unfavourable balance, may most commonly conclude, that in case of its taking place, it arises from unjust and selfish trade laws in other nations, which require, and ought to be retaliated. For one of three things must necessarily result from an unfavourable balance of trade, when the commodities imported are consumed, and are not re-exported. 1. The specie must either be exported, to pay the unfavourable bal∣ance:—or, 2. it must be made up from the excess, in the commerce with other states;—or, 3. it must re∣main a debt against the country.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="031857_0031_0FEF21FBC8CFD048"/>With respect to the first, whatever may have been said by Mr. Hume, that a circulating medium will regulate itself, and that no country need be apprehen∣sive from its exports, whilst it has population, and the means of industry; yet every state must feel appre∣hensive for its safety and welfare, from depreciating the value of property, in relation to the precious met∣als, when such changes are known to lay the founda∣tions of injustice, and to produce distrust, disorder, and confusion in every country. For example, we need but to retrace events a few years back, in our own country, to know the cause and effect of the loss of our circulating medium. The heavy balances due to Great-Britain, from cutting off our usual remittances, by her commercial regulations, produced the uneasi∣nesses, distrusts, and confusions of the year 1786. The people, who had contracted debts, and made promises of specie at one rate of value, found themselves utterly unable, from its undue exportation, to fulfil them at another, i. e. an enhanced one, arising out of its scar∣city;—for instance, he who had bought a hundred bushels of grain, and gave his note for it, at a given price, payable at an advanced period, say twelve months, found that it would require more than double the quantity of grain to discharge his note. In short, such were the disorders introduced into the money transactions of the country, through this fertile source of public calamity, that public and private credit were for a long time suspended, and confusion and disaffec∣tion to government, in some instances, grew out of the unfavourable balances of trade, grounded on British regulations of commerce.</P>
<P>With respect to the liquidating an unfavourable balance of trade with one country by a favourable one with another, it must be considered as a mean too precarious and uncertain to be calculated upon, in a system of commercial regulations; for it cannot be expected to continue longer than until the nations, with which we have favourable balances, shall become
<PB N="35" REF="031857_0032_0FEF21FD53CC6F88"/>
apprized of their situation and interest. For instance; Can it rationally be expected, that France, with which we have had, before the present European war, a more favourable balance of trade than with any other na∣tion, amounting to 2,068,348 dollars, will not put further restrictions upon our commerce, or demand an equivalent, in some form or other; especially when she finds, that the balance she pays to the United States, goes to feed and to nourish the commerce and power of her enemy? Every nation ought, then, to expect an unequal commerce will be retaliated, and that it will be restricted and retrenched, as times and opportunity present.</P>
<P>Although there was a balance of trade of 235,975 dollars, in the year 1790, against the United States, yet it has been said, that it has been sometimes in their favour; but a little reflection upon what took place, prior to the present European war, will not only shew the suggestion unfounded; but will sufficiently prove, that unless additional protection had been given to the commerce of the United States, what with the old debts due to Great-Britain, and those which were daily accruing, there was much reason to fear, that the English commerce would, in a few years, have absorbed the greater part, or all, of the personal property of the country; as the insufficiency of the exports was made up, for several years, out of the public securities, bank stocks, and an extensive sale of our wild lands in England; and although these operated as remit∣tances to a vast amount, comprehending, as it has been supposed, one half of the national bank stocks, and one third, at least, of the public debt of the United States; yet the concurrence of these circumstances was not sufficient to reduce the price of bills of ex∣change. If these then are facts, and that they are, a reference to people in trade, and to the rates of ex∣change, until the beginning of the present European war, will fully evince;—must it not, then, be a serious cause of alarm, to see the same pernicious commercial
<PB N="36" REF="031857_0033_0FEF21FEDC41EAD0"/>
system persisted in, almost without a suggestion, or an attempt, to retaliate the commercial policy of England? Well might the British minister exult, as he did, in the year 1790, that the independence of the United States had cost nothing to Great-Britain; that so far from its proving an injury, it had saved the heavy ex∣pense of their protection; whilst Great-Britain had derived greater commercial benefits, from the United States, than when they were colonies: or, in other words, that the American independence had been, and would continue, but a name, whilst a physical depend∣ence could be retained by commerce.</P>
<P>If the power of regulating commerce, given to the United States, implies an obligation, it must have been intended, that the commerce should be so man∣aged, that the annual imports should not exceed the exports; or that the productions of foreign countries should not be consumed out of proportion to the means of paying for them, by the productions of the United States; for any thing short of this, is not the regulation, but the mismanagement of commerce; for the term regulation carries with it, the idea of a just and proper method of management, which can∣not be the case, if this principle is unattended to.</P>
<P>Baron Montesquieu observes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Montesquieu, book 20, chap. 12 and 13.</NOTE> that the liberty of commerce depends upon its restraints; that it does not consist, on the one hand, in an unbridled freedom to traders; nor yet in unjust impositions for the sake of revenue, on the other: that government should stand neuter between its commerce and revenues, and not suffer the interests of the latter to encroach upon the rights of the former. In short, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Blackstone, book 3. ch. 13. vol. 3. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>17.</NOTE> the law maxim of <HI>sic utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas,</HI> seems strongly to apply, both as to the individual liberty of commerce, and to the rules and regulations necessary to produce it; on the extension of which, must principally de∣pend the public economy:—Public economy exacts,
<PB N="37" REF="031857_0034_0FEF2206B19E9B30"/>
that the public income should not exceed the public expenditure:—In this case, the annual exports are the income, and the annual imports the expenditure; which, if the regulations of commerce do not con∣trol, so that the latter should not exceed the former, it is a sure mark, that the commerce is not sufficient∣ly restrained. The impost laws of the United States allow the importation of every thing from abroad, whether wanted or not, on payment of the stipulated duties; but to allow the importation of such articles, which we do not want, or can procure amongst our∣selves, must lessen the capacity to obtain what we actually stand in need of. If we expend equally in what we do, and do not want, we must have a redu∣ced quantity of what we do want, by the amount of the expenditure in what we do not want. To lessen foreign importations, then, it is necessary to prohibit entry to such articles as we can raise or manufacture amongst ourselves in sufficient quantities, to supply the demand. High duties, by some called protecting duties, are seldom collected, or very imperfectly so, <HI>in countries even less suited to conceal smuggling than the United States;</HI> from whence it may be inferred, that prohi∣bitions will afford greater security to American manu∣factures, than what are called protecting duties, which offer temptation to smuggling, produce little or no revenue, and justify the sale, use, and consumption of such manufactures, which merit an exclusion. Sure it is, that means more effectual, than those which have been hitherto devised, are necessary to re∣duce the ruinous and growing balance of trade, against the United States, in favour of Great-Britain. The state of Massachusetts prohibited the importation from abroad, of many articles of home produce, and manufacture, in the year 1786, which had a benefi∣cial effect, as to several of the articles; for whilst the prohibition shut out foreign importation, such was the competition produced in their manufacture, that many of the articles were supplied at a less price than
<PB N="38" REF="031857_0035_0FEF220A723E7128"/>
before their importation was prohibited. The article of nails, particularly, fell from seven and six pence, Massachusetts currency, to five and four pence per thousand; and the other articles of iron ware in a like proportion; whilst the general prices of all were not enhanced by the prohibition. The articles pro∣hibited by Massachusetts were as follows, viz. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Massachusetts impost act, passed in the year 1786.</NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="39" REF="031857_0036_0FEF220C00E7D790"/>There is little doubt but most, if not all the foregoing articles, as well as many others, might be supplied, in sufficient quantities, to answer the de∣mands of the citizens of the United States, without foreign importation. Admitting this to be the case, ought not such articles to be prohibited? ought not the citizens of the United States, who are taxed by, and submit to the federal and state governments, to be protected in their professions and callings, against foreign interference? is it not bad economy for a government, acting in its personal capacity, to pur∣chase what it does not want, or what its citizens do, or may procure of themselves? is it not as reprehen∣sible to permit such importations, as it would be for a farmer to allow himself to purchase wheat or corn, when he had the most ample means to procure a suf∣ficiency of both? Absolute prohibitions, therefore, upon all articles of foreign importation, interfering with our own manufactures, when their demand can be supplied; increasing duties upon articles imported, which are of our own manufacture, until extinguish∣ed by prohibitions; heavy duties upon such articles as we ought, and do not manufacture, as an encour∣agement to their being undertaken, are the measures pursued by Great-Britain; and the means the most likely to promote manufactures, and to procure a more favourable balance of trade. But should the
<PB N="40" REF="031857_0037_0FEF220F0D0F6DF8"/>
present pernicious system of commercial regulations be unalterably adhered to, and the produce and manufac∣tures of the United States meet no farther protection against foreign interference, would not the separate states be justified in levying an excise upon such im∣ported articles, which produce an injurious effect upon their respective manufactures? for example, why should not the farmers of the United States be entit∣led to the exclusive sale of their productions, especially when they already suffer so many inconveniencies for the want of established markets? why then should not the articles of beef, cheese, porter, beer, and other articles, which appertain to the produce of the soil, be prohibited? do the protecting duties, as they are termed, exclude their consumption? on the contrary, are not large sums annually expended upon such im∣ported articles? do they not produce a much greater injury from their importation, than the revenue, de∣rived from them, is a benefit? may it not be asked, why these articles are not permitted entry into Eng∣land? and whether the policy of protecting the inte∣rests of agriculture and manufactures, in its principle, does not apply as strongly to the United States, as to Great-Britain? The best vent for the productions of every country, is that of its richest citizens, who, if supplied with what they use, through foreign nations, must prostrate all efforts to improvement, and leave to the native farmers and artisans, the supply of the poorer citizens only, who are unable to purchase, but of the inferior kinds. It is by prohibitions, and in the expenditures of the richer citizens, that the poorer are to be maintained, and the requisite improvements in arts and manufactures are to be expected: and shall government, for the sake of retaining duties, imper∣fectly collected, indulge luxury, pride, and vanity, at the expense of the public welfare? Are the sums col∣lected in this way, to be put in competition with the interests of the great body of husbandmen and artisans of the United States? Are they to be put in opposition
<PB N="41" REF="031857_0038_0FEF22126B04D528"/>
to the habits, manners, and independence of the coun∣try? If laws are intended to prevent public evils; if the impost laws, particularly, can be so constructed, as to lessen luxury, to influence manners, and to induce habits of industry, economy, and moderation, ought not considerations of this sort to have weight in a re∣publican government? Nations, like individuals, suf∣fer more from example, than by the natural progress of corruption. Every one, therefore, must wish, that if the American character shall be contaminated, it should result from the slow progress of luxury, through its own improvements, rather than from the corrupt sources of the tinseled sineries of Europe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The importer of foreign luxuries and fineries finds it greatly for his own profit to encourage a spirit of dissipation and extravagance amongst all ranks of people; for he not only reaps profit on them, but, in the mean time, he knows that what were accounted mere su∣perfluities at first, soon become necessaries of life, so that this trade will increase with the increasing demand for them: It is his interest, therefore, and will be his study, to promote, as far as he can, that general spirit of extravagance and dissipation, which is the most effec∣tual bar to sober industry, and the most certain means of destroying the internal felicity of every individual of the state. In consequence of this system, the people soon become poor, and the profits of the dealer increase with their poverty; how absurd then is it in mankind, to estimate the degree of improvement of a country by the richness of its merchants!</Q></P>

<P><Q>Luxury and prodigality, says Sir Josiah Childs, are as well pre∣judicial to kingdoms as to private families; and that the expense of foreign commodities, especially foreign manufactures, is the worst ex∣pense a nation can be inclinable to, and ought to be prevented as much as possible.</Q></P>
<BIBL>See Sir Josiah Childs's preface to his new dis∣course upon trade.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Another object, perhaps of no less importance than what has been before intimated, to reduce an unfav∣ourable balance of trade, may not be improper here to suggest: it is a measure of no less consequence than to secure the commissions, or factorage, upon the sup∣ply of our own markets with the productions and merchandizes of foreign countries: and it is conceiv∣ed, that no better suggestion, for the purpose, can be readily offered, <HI>than an alien duty upon goods, wares, or productions of foreign countries, shipped for, or consigned to
<PB N="42" REF="031857_0039_0FEF2217584C8520"/>
any other, than an American citizen; and that no draw∣back should be allowed upon the exportation of articles, oth∣erwise shipped or consigned, which had previously paid duty upon importation:</HI> By a measure of this sort, the Unit∣ed States might calculate a saving, at least, of two millions of dollars annually, which the commissions upon importation and exportation, calculated at 5 per cent. with incidental charges, would at least amount to.</P>
<P>American merchants, considered as such, in relation to their country, stand in an important point of view; they are to be regarded as the instruments of com∣munication with foreign countries, of exciting do∣mestic industry, of diffusing prosperity and wealth, and of holding the capitals of the country, to be re∣curred to, in cases of exigence or necessity. To sup∣pose that persons, of this respectable class, ought not to find protection, in preference to those of foreign nations, is to consider that foreign merchants are not bound by ties and connections, which attach them to their native country; and that their opinions and sentiments are divested of those partialities, which commonly actuate the human heart. So fully do the English laws recognize this principle of attachment to their native country, that they suppose, if a merchant shall even assume a foreign allegiance, that it is only <HI>"local and temporary,"</HI> and that his natural allegiance is a perpetual, actuating principle, from which he can∣not be withdrawn without the "concurrent act of the government to which it was first due." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Blackstone, book 1. chap. 10. p. 370.</NOTE> This principle of the English law is likewise concurrent to another, quite as generally received, and better un∣derstood, which is, <HI>that the profits obtained in commerce, if carried on by foreigners, will be expended out of the country, in which they were procured.</HI></P>
<P>When we reflect upon the numerous evils, arising from the profits of labour, (which most commonly center in commerce), being expended out of the coun∣try,
<PB N="43" REF="031857_0040_0FEF2218E29057C8"/>
to which they properly belong; that a gradual poverty, and an accumulating misery, are its never failing consequence, as may be exemplified in the peo∣ple of Scotland and Ireland, particularly the latter, where their wealth, being principally expended in England, instead of nourishing the sources, from whence it is derived, has reduced the inhabitants to the lowest state of beggary and wretchedness. In proportion, therefore, as a country suffers its com∣merce to be carried on by foreigners, will its citizens become depressed and impoverished. Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia, afford an additional ex∣ample in point, where English and Scotch merchants and factors carry on the commerce, and retire to their native country, with the wealth which they thereby acquire, to the injury of those states. To suppose, then, that a distinction ought not to be made, between American merchants and those of other countries; and that the disabilities of foreign merchants ought not to be increased in the United States, when so many inconveniencies must arise from the establishing of a foreign influence, from the transferring the profits of commerce to a foreign country, and from withdraw∣ing the credits and capitals from the country, at a time of exigence, or of war, when they may be most needed, is, in every point of view, a prostration, both of national and commercial policy. For this purpose, additional and special impediments should be thrown in the way of naturalizing merchant strangers, in order to procure the preferences and advantages herein con∣templated. When we consider the numerous disabili∣ties of foreigners, carrying on trade in Great-Britain, the commercial impositions to which they are subject, and the restraints which meet them in every direc∣tion:—that residence procures no remission to those restraints, except in the British plantations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The colonial assemblies were authorized to naturalize foreigners of good character, after a residence of seven years.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="031857_0041_0FEF221C0308DEE8"/>
the commercial disabilities still follow them, until they can find influence sufficient to obtain, at a great ex∣pense, a special act of naturalization in their favour,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Blackstone, vol. 1. p. 371 to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>74.</NOTE> which cannot be sustained, in either house of parlia∣ment, without a disabling clause, declaratory, <Q>that they can neither be themselves members of the privy coun∣cil, nor of either house of parliament, nor hold any office of trust, civil or military, nor capable of any grant from the crown:</Q>—when we compare these disabilities with the liberties and privileges of English merchants and factors coming to, and trading in the United States; when we compare them with the ease, facility, and advantages of Englishmen, becoming naturalized A∣merican citizens, every one is left to wonder at the motives, the policy, and inducements, which author∣ize the disparity.—In short, there seems to be little less than a communion of commercial benefits on the one side, against limitations, restrictions, taxes and prohibitions on the other!</P>
<P>With respect to the relative situation of the two countries, in regard to navigation—the last division of our subject—in order to place it fairly before the pub∣lic, it may not be improper to recite a few clauses from several principal statutes of the British parlia∣ment, viz. from an act entitled, "An act for the en∣couraging and increasing of shipping and navigation," "An act for the encouragement of trade," and from other acts supplementary thereto.</P>
<P>The first of these statutes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">12 Cha. 2. ch. 18.</NOTE> enacts, Section 1. <Q>That no goods or commodities whatsoever shall be im∣ported into, or exported out of any lands, islands, plantations, or territories, to his majesty belonging, or in his possession, or which may hereafter belong unto, or be in the possession of his majesty, his heirs and successors, in Asia, Africa, or America, in any other ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such ships or vessels as do truly, and without fraud, be∣long

<P>Sect. 3. <Q>Extends the same prohibition to all goods or commodities whatsoever, of the growth, production and manufacture of Africa, Asia or America, under like penalties.</Q></P>
<P>Sect. 4. <Q>Provides that no goods or commodities, that are of foreign growth, production, or manu∣facture, and which are to be brought into England, Ireland, Wales, the islands of Guernsey or Jersey, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, in English built ship∣ping, or other shipping belonging to some of the a∣foresaid places, and navigated by English mariners, as aforesaid, shall be shipped or brought from any other place or places, country or countries, but on∣ly from those of the said growth, production, or ma∣nufacture, or from those ports where the said goods and commodities can only, or are, or usually have been first shipped for transportation, and from none other places or countries,</Q> under the forfeiture of vessel and cargo.</P>
<P>Sect. 6. <Q>That from henceforth it shall not be law∣ful to any person or persons whatsoever, to load, or cause to be loaden, and carried in any bottom or bottoms, ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, whereof any stranger or strangers born, (unless such as are citizens or naturalized), be owners, part own∣ers, or masters, and whereof three fourths of the mariners, at least, shall not be English, any fish, vic∣tual, wares, goods, commodities or things, of what kind or nature soever the same shall be, from one port or creek of England, Ireland, Wales, islands of Guernsey or Jersey, or town of Berwick upon Tweed,

<P>The 6th Section of the Act for the encouragement of trade, contains the following prohibition. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">15 Cha. 2. ch. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>That no commodity of the growth, production or manufacture of Europe, shall be imported into any land, island, plantation, colony, territory or place to his majesty belonging, or which shall here∣after belong unto, or be in possession of his majesty, his heirs and successors, in Asia, Africa, or America, (Tangier only excepted), but what shall be bonâ fidê, and without fraud, laden and shipped in Eng∣land, Wales, or in the town of Berwick upon Tweed, and in English built shipping, &amp;c. whereof the mas∣ter and three fourths of the mariners, at least, are English, and which shall be carried directly thence to the lands, islands, plantations, &amp;c. and from no oth∣er place or places whatsoever, under the penalty of the forfeiture of goods and vessel.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to the Sections of the foregoing Acts, the following clauses are taken from two other Acts, passed in the 26th and 27th years of the present King of England, since the American revolution, supplemen∣tary and confirmatory of the prohibitions and restric∣tions of the acts aforesaid, as they respect the United States, viz.</P>

<P><Q>From and after the 1st day of August, 1786, no ship or vessel shall be deemed or taken to be British built, or enjoy the privileges thereunto belonging, which shall from thenceforth be rebuilt or repaired in any foreign port or place, if such repairs shall ex∣ceed fifteen shillings for every ton of the said ship or vessel,</Q> except to enable her to perform the voyage in which she shall then be engaged. 26 Geo. 3d ch. 60.</P>
<P>"For obviating all doubts which may arise, touching the meaning and construction of the act made and passed in the 26th year of his present majesty, for the further increase and encouragement of shipping and navigation," Be it enacted and declared, that all ships and vessels, <Q>which, by said act, are declared not to be entitled to any of the privileges or advantages of a British built ship, or of a ship owned by British subjects, and all ships and vessels not registered ac∣cording to the directions and regulations of the said acts, shall, although such ships and vessels may be owned by his majesty's subjects, be held and deem∣ed, to all intents and purposes, as alien ships, and shall, in all cases, be liable to such and the same pe∣nalties and forfeitures as alien ships, in the like ca∣ses, are or shall by law be liable to. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">27 Geo. 3. ch. 19.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Although the acts, from which the foregoing clauses are transcribed, passed in the 12th and 15th years of the reign of Charles 2d. and the 26th and 27th of George 3d. yet the first act was produced during Cromwell's protectorship, at the instigation of Mr. St. John, who, through resentment, from an unsuccess∣ful negotiation with which he had been charged to the states of Holland, procured its adoption.

Lord Hawkesborough, in his discourse with regard to neutral nations, calls Cromwell's act <Q>A NOBLE STRAIN OF COMMERCIAL POLICY, which hath proved the fertile source of all the naval pow∣er, which hath operated insensibly to the preserva∣tion, and hath been the spring from whence hath flowed, the wealth and greatness of England.</Q></P>
<P>How far <HI>this noble strain of commercial policy</HI> ought to be resisted, or harmonized with; and whether, in the poetic language of the noble Lord, the United States ought to echo to the song, and in notes respon∣sive, bear up its lengthened sound, let it be the ob∣ject of the following observations to examine.</P>
<P>Admitting the advantages of navigation, and of a carrying trade, to be unquestionable, as a mean of wealth and defence, which will scarcely be denied;— a commercial intercourse ought equally, as has been already suggested, to reciprocate such advantages;— and the benefits received should equal those which are bestowed: But the inquiry recurs, What is the state of the case, as it respects the important subject in discussion? It is, in fact, that in the year end∣ing the 1st of October, 1790, the United States al∣lowed to the vessels of Great-Britain, five times the direct freightage that they received; and of course, our carrying trade contributed to the wealth and de∣fence of Great-Britain in the proportion of four parts in five, at least, of what it did to the advantage and benefit of the United States!!</P>
<P>The whole tonnage of vessels, on which duty was paid in the United States, in the aforementioned year, was 761,710 tons, of which there were belonging to the United States 492,100 tons, to other nations 269, 610 tons, of which Great-Britain had 226,953 tons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Jefferson's statement to Congress in December, 1793.

whereby Great-Britain drew for the freightage, calcu∣lating but one trip, or two passages to the vessels, at the mean rate of fifty shillings sterling per ton, on each passage, 1,134,765 pounds sterling, which sum, if rendered into dollars, amounts to 5,043,400 dol∣lars, or about one quarter part of the value of the ex∣ports of the United States, by the employment of eleven hundred and thirty-four ships, of two hundred tons each; which, if calculated to carry twelve men to each vessel, employed 13,608 seamen; whilst the direct freightage of American vessels, to and from the British dominions, employed no more than 43,580<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Jefferson's statement.</NOTE> tons of shipping, leaving the immense balance of 183,370 tons in favour of the shipping of Great-Brit∣ain:—so that he relative advantages, on the employ∣ment of the respective ships and seamen of the two countries, stood in the proportion of two hundred and eighteen ships to eleven hundred and thirty-four: in seamen, of 2,616 to 13,608—and in the value of freightage, 968,444 dollars to 5,043,400, without taking into view the advantage of freightage from port to port, permitted to English vessels in the United States, and not allowed to American vessels in the British dominions, which must add much to the already too glaring disparity.</P>

<P>Although Mr. Jefferson, in his report, states the par∣ticular balance of trade arising from the imports from, and the exports to Great-Britain, to be 5,992,012 dollars against the United States, yet, for the greater accuracy, as well as to shew the British statement of imports and exports into, and from Great-Britain, the following statement is transcribed from Ander∣son's Chronological History of Commerce, which is the latest that it contains, and is for the year 1785.</P>

That prodigious augmentation cannot be viewed as permanent, unless owing to the increase of the quantity of articles of our own growth, or manufacture, that were exported. But it has already been stated, that that quantity has received but a trifling addition, if any, since the former period. That increase is due to mere temporary causes; the first arising from an advanced price, of perhaps forty per cent. upon the total amount of our exports, be∣yond their usual value; the second, from our having become the car∣riers of a large proportion of the produce of some of the West-India islands. Those two items, both of which are owing to the present European war, constitute nearly one half of the value of our exports for the two last years.</Q> <BIBL>See Gallatin on the finances of the United States, lately published, page 27.</BIBL></P></NOTE></CELL>

<P>See Tench Coxe's statement of exports, in his view of the United States.</P>
<P>Observe, that the above statement does not include the imports or ex∣ports to and from the British colonies.</P>
<P>If the foregoing statements are founded upon facts; (for it is by facts and statements of this sort that the commercial policy of a country must be adjudged);— if they justly point out the relative advantages, aris∣ing from the commerce and navigation of the two countries, can there be a doubt remaining, as to the ill policy of our existing regulations of commerce?
<PB N="57" REF="031857_0054_0FEF2249B9AAF468"/>
and is it not obvious, that a balance of trade, so im∣mense in its amount, and so ruinous in its conse∣quences, threatning both public and private credit with shipwreck, ought, by some means or other, to be remedied? and to what measure, concurrent to those already suggested, can we better recur, than to an American navigation act, similar to that of Great-Britain? It is a measure of justice to ourselves, of protection to our citizens, and of reciprocity to Great-Britain. Tench Coxe, in his view of the United States, observes upon it, <Q>That the article of the British trade laws, which confines the importation of foreign goods to the bottoms of the country producing them, and of their own citizens, appears applicable to our situation. By means of those two flags, we should be certain of the necessary importa∣tions; and we should throw out of each department of the carrying trade, every competitor, except the ships of the nation by which the goods were pro∣duced or manufactured. All trade with several countries, such as China and India, whose vessels seldom or never make foreign voyages, would be secured in our own hands. It will be found, that a modified application of this regulation, in practice, will be attended with no difficulties or inconveni∣ences; and besides the immediate benefits already mentioned, our merchants will be led <HI>directly</HI> to the <HI>original</HI> market for the supplies of which we stand in need. Instead of purchasing goods of Russia, or the East-Indies, in England, France, or Holland, our own ships will sail directly to the fountain, from whence they have hitherto flowed to us through foreign channels. The credits given to us in Eu∣rope, after the peace, kept us in the practice of go∣ing to a very few places, for all our importations. But they have trusted us, in many instances, at a dear rate indeed; and however useful credit may be, as a supplement to our means of trade, in this young country, it is very certain that we should
<PB N="58" REF="031857_0055_0FEF224B4534D708"/>
first lay out to the best advantage, our funds in hand.</Q></P>
<P>Lest it may be objected, that the reforms herein suggested, in the commercial system of the United States, might impugn the revenue, and thereby pro∣duce mischief and disorder in the public finances;— but as this is neither intended, nor expected; and with a view to prevent such a suggestion, as well as to avoid unnecessary amplification, it may not be improp∣er to suggest the following queries.</P>
<P>Query 1. Whether the revenue upon goods im∣ported, ought to be calculated upon, beyond the value of the goods or produce exported?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether an increase of revenue, arising from an undue importation in one year, must not be fol∣lowed by a reduced revenue in succeeding years; and if the excess be repeated, (the imports exceeding the exports), whether the revenue, grounded upon such importations, will not be subjected to a gradual reduc∣tion, if not a final extinction?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether the amount of the importations would in fact be diminished by particular prohibitions, tak∣ing several years together; and whether the exclu∣sion of articles, unnecessary and luxurious, would not produce the same revenue, by the increase of such ar∣ticles as were useful and convenient?</P>
<P N="4">4. And, lastly, Whether a diminution in the re∣venue from a partial exclusion of foreign tonnage, by an American navigation act, might not readily be in∣demnified by an increased duty upon the domestic?</P>
<P>Before the present subject is concluded, it may not be improper to make a few additional observations.</P>
<P>An American navigation act, it is conceived, must operate not less beneficially to the agricultural, than to the commercial states, by giving security to the trans∣portation of their produce to foreign markets at all times, and especially in times of war; and should it be sound, that the competition, in the supply of vessels, should not at first be sufficient to furnish the freight∣age
<PB N="59" REF="031857_0056_0FEF224EEBEA66B0"/>
at the lowest rates, (which must soon be the case,) the agricultural states, under such circumstances, would be wanting in a just view of their true interests, not to co-operate in the measures necessary to produce it: In proof of which, it may be asked, what would have been the probable situation of the southern states, from the present European war, if the United States had been without navigation? Their produce must, in all probability, have perished upon their hands, or have been transported to market at so heavy an expense, as to have left little to the profit of their lands: whereas they have found immense prices for their productions, whilst our ships and vessels have had ample and gene∣rous freights for their transportation. The union of the commercial and agricultural interest in this, as in most other cases, has been found contributive to the general welfare; and perhaps no measure of more ge∣neral policy, or particular advantage, applying to the northern and southern states, could be readily devised for the mutual benefit of agriculture and commerce, than an American navigation act, upon the principles herein proposed.</P>
<P>But when we consider the encouragement of navi∣gation as contributive to the general defence, without going far into the history of ancient or modern na∣tions, there are few or no instances of a country hold∣ing extensive colonies or possessions abroad, or of en∣joying power or respectability at home, or among the neighbouring states, without the aid of a maritime force. Navigation, as a nursery of seamen, and as a mean of bestowing wealth and power, is found, by experience, to be among the first objects of national policy. The Carthagenians maintained their indepen∣dence, and were successful rivals to the Roman power, as long as they preserved their naval superiority:— The most brilliant achievements of the Athenians were through the means of their fleets:—<Q>The answer giv∣en by the oracle of Delphi to the Athenians, to fortify their city with wooden walls against the invasion of
<PB N="60" REF="031857_0057_0FEF225537E7EF78"/>
Xerxes, is an advice which has been successfully adopt∣ed by the French and English,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Postlethwaite</NOTE></Q> and ought to be operative upon the citizens and government of the United States.</P>
<P>France, by the establishment of distant colonies, and by laying a duty, amounting to a prohibition, upon foreign shipping, in the time of Lewis 14th, gained such an ascendency upon the ocean, that her fleets be∣came formidable to those of England, Holland, and Spain: England, although always known as a mari∣time power, yet from the time of King Edgar, to that of Queen Elizabeth, made no great figure upon the ocean:—Her colonies, principally Virginia, and after∣wards the Carolinas, added to the wise provisions and prohibitions of her navigation acts, first laid the foun∣dation, and afterwards established her maritime im∣portance.</P>
<P>To the policy of these acts ought the citizens of the United States to have recourse, as a mean of pro∣curing their country's prosperity and power, as a measure of security against foreign invasion;—to con∣voy and to protect their commerce, to assure to them the just reward of their labour, and to protect it against foreign interference:—as a defensive measure, to equalize the advantages of commerce with foreign nations; to place prohibitions against prohibitions, and generally to secure those benefits, to which their situation, productions and good policy ought to en∣title them.</P>
<P>To conclude:—Fellow-Citizens of the United States! let not <HI>"partial views, or local prejudices,"</HI> deter you from a due consideration of the measures herein recommended: weigh well your commercial and political situation with Great-Britain! Let unity of action and design (the chief characteristics of a na∣tion) mark your measures and councils!—Weak— timid—yielding politics never yet achieved any thing of importance!—It is for you to say, whether you
<PB N="61" REF="031857_0058_0FEF2256C0163398"/>
will be a great, independent, enterprising and com∣manding people;—or a weak—dependent—timid— and degraded one!—Speak the word, infuse your influence into your government; and those acts and measures will soon be pursued, which will not only secure you against the impending evils, which threat∣en you, but will waft to your favoured shores, pro∣gressive wealth, prosperity, and power.</P>
