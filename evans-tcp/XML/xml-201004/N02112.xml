<HEAD>AN ESSAY, ON Scripture-Prophecy Wherein it is Endeavoured To Explain the <HI>Three Periods</HI> contained in the 12th Chapter of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> with some Arguments to make it Probable, that the <HI>first</HI> of these <HI>Periods</HI> did Expire in 1715.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>IT has always been the Policy of the Teachers of False Religions, to keep their Principles from being nicely Examined into by the People, and it seems, for the same Reason, a Mark of a True One, when it is submitted to the
<PB N="2" REF="002509_0004_0FDB660202BADE28"/>Enquiry of Mankind, and when they are invited to be their own Judges, by those who instruct them: The Accomplishment of Prophecies is of this Kind, it is an Appeal to the World, and to this effect we find it insisted on by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> in the following Passages, as a Convin∣cing and Distinguishing Proof of the True God, in Opposition to Idols.</P>
<P><Q>I am the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah xlii. vers. 8.</NOTE> that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Praise to graven Images.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Behold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 9.</NOTE> the former Things are come to pass, and New Things do <HI>I</HI> declare, before they spring forth <HI>I</HI> tell you of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Produce your Cause, saith the Lord, bring forth your strong Reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">chap. xli. v. 21.</NOTE> saith the King of <HI>Jacob.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Let them bring forth and shew us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 22.</NOTE> let them shew the former Things what they be, that we may consider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, and know the latter End of them, or declare us Things for to come.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002509_0005_0FDB660536347AE8"/>
<Q>Shew the Things that are to come hereafter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> that we may know that ye are Gods; yea, do Good or do Evil, that we may be Dismayed, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hold it together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Behold, ye are of nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE> and your Work of nought, an Abomination is he that chooseth you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let all Nations be gathered together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">chap xliii. vers. 9.</NOTE> and let the People be assembled; Who among them can declare this, and shew us former Things? let them bring forth their Witnesses, that they may be Justified, or let them hear and say, it is Truth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ye are my Witnesses, saith the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> and my Servant whom <HI>I</HI> have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and understand that <HI>I</HI> am He.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>I</HI> have declared, and have saved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> and have shew∣ed when there was no strange God among you, Therefore ye are my Witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have declared the former Things from the beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. xlviii, 3.</NOTE> and they went forth out of my
<PB N="4" REF="002509_0006_0FDB6606A94B26D8"/>Mouth, and I shewed them, I did then suddainly, and they came to pass.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have even from the beginning declared it to thee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 5.</NOTE> before it came pass I shewed it thee, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st thou shouldst say, mine Idol has done them, and my graven Image, and my molten Image has commanded them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thou hast heard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> see all this, and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee now Things from this time, even hidden Things, and thou didst not know them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They are created now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> and not from the beginning, even before the Day when thou heardst them not, lest thou shouldst say, Be∣hold, I knew them.</Q></P>
<P>Thus does the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> employ the the strongest Terms to Recommend the Study of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> and the Observation of the Events which confirm the Truth of it; and St. <HI>Peter</HI> applies the Old Prophecies to the Times after Christ's Birth, in these words,</P>
<P><Q>Of which Salvation the Prophets have en∣quired
<PB N="5" REF="002509_0007_0FDB660A80C65D40"/>and searched diligently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. i. 10.</NOTE> who prophecy'd of the Grace that should come unto you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Searching what,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE> or what manner of Time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, did signifie, when it testified before-hand the Suffer∣ings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Unto whom it was Revealed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> that not unto themselves, but unto Us they did minister the Things which are now Reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel unto you, with the holy Ghost sent down from Hea∣ven, which Things the Angels desire to look into.</Q></P>
<P>And as the greatest Arguments made use of to the <HI>Jews,</HI> to prove that Christ was the <HI>Messiah,</HI> were taken from their Prophets, so that the like Arguments might not be wanting through-out all the Times of the Christian Church, St. <HI>John</HI> has left us,</P>
<P><Q><HI>The Revelation of Jesus Christ,</HI> which God gave unto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. i. 1.</NOTE> to shew unto his Servants the
<PB N="6" REF="002509_0008_0FDB660C0230D250"/>Things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his Servant <HI>John.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Blessed is he that Readeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> and they that Hear the Words of this Prophecy, and keep those Things which are written therein, for the Time is at hand.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Prophecy</HI> appears chiefly to be contain'd within <HI>A Book written within,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. V. 1.7.</NOTE> <HI>and on the back∣side, Sealed with seven Seals,</HI> which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amb— <HI>took out of the Right Hand of Him that sate upon the Torone,</HI> and <HI>Opened</HI> the several <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als</HI> one after another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. vi. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12. ch. viii. 1.</NOTE> whose Contents compared with History, will be found to describe all that was to come to pass in the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> after the Time of St. <HI>John</HI>'s writing, which was about ninty five years after Christs Birth.</P>
<P>This is, in all appearance, the same Book, in which <HI>Daniel</HI> is ordered <HI>To shut up the Words,</HI> and <HI>Seal the Book,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 4.</NOTE> <HI>even to the Time of the End,</HI> when it was to be further Explained by St. <HI>John,</HI> and Unsealed, in order of Time, as the Events
<PB N="7" REF="002509_0009_0FDB6610E5742668"/>were to happen, which are the only compleat Interpreters of Prophecy, According to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Observation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. i. 20.</NOTE> <HI>That no Prophecy of the Scripture is its own Interpreter</HI> (as it ought to be rendeed, and not as in the <HI>English</HI> Translation, <HI>Of private Interpretation.</HI>)</P>
<P>If therefore that <HI>Time of the End</HI> is not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ady come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan xii. 9.</NOTE> it is in vain to attempt any Explanation of the Periods mentioned in this Chapter of <HI>Daniel, for the Words are closed up, and sealed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. xii. 9,</NOTE> <HI>till the Time of the End.</HI> <Q>But when that <HI>Time</HI> comes <HI>Many shall be Purifyed and made White,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> <HI>and Tryed, but the Wicked shall do Wickedly, and none of the Wicked shall Understand, but the Wise shall Understand:</HI></Q> So that as cer∣tainly as the Prophecy ought to be obscure till that <HI>Time,</HI> it ought to be plain after it is come, to those who are meant by the <HI>Wise.</HI> And if it can be shewn what those Events are which the Prophecy referrs to, and that they are already happened, in order as they are described by <HI>Daniel,</HI> and Explained by St. <HI>John:</HI> Then it must be confessed, that the <HI>Time</HI> is come, and that
<PB N="8" REF="002509_0010_0FDB6611CE27CB68"/><HI>those who will not understand are Wicked,</HI> that is, engaged in interest to Oppose the Truth, and will deserve to have that applyed to them which our Saviour, on a like occasion, says of the Pha∣risees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xvi. 3.</NOTE> <HI>O ye Hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the Sky, but can ye not discern the Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>By which charge of <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> our Saviour did not mean, that the Pharisees knew him, and yet denyed him against their Conscience; for he observes, That they <HI>did not discern the Times,</HI> that is, did not know him, and yet this was an <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> tho' they were not sensible of it; for their Power and Advantage blinded them so, that they deceived themselves, and opposed his Doctrine out of <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> or guilty Prejudice.</P>
<P>The Application of this to <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Distinction, will not be difficult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim iii. v. 15.</NOTE> when it comes to be shewn, that it relates to a <HI>Time</HI> when the World was to be divided into Two great Contending Parties, One of which would adhere to the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and therefore are called <HI>Wise unto Salvation;</HI> and the other Party would adhere to that Cause
<PB N="9" REF="002509_0011_0FDB6615DC125B08"/>which is supported by human Policy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jude 16.</NOTE> <HI>holding Mens Persons in Admiration because of Advantage;</HI> and is therefore called in <HI>Zachariah</HI> by the distinguish∣ing name of <HI>Wickedness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach v. 8.</NOTE> that had <HI>a House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE> built it in the Land of Shiner,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan I. 2. Rev. XII 6.14. xvii. 5.</NOTE> which <HI>Daniel</HI> informs us was at <HI>Babylon,</HI> and which agrees with the <HI>Woman in the Wilderness,</HI> and <HI>the Babylon</HI> in St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Now to make these things plainer by a parti∣cular Enquiry, I shall compare several Passages of Scripture with one another, and with the Remarkable Events in History, and submit it to the Reader, Whether the study of Scripture Prophecy deserves the Neglect or Prejudice it generally meets with in the World; or, Whe∣ther it is not far more reasonable, as well as more becoming Christians in Profession, to follow St. <HI>John</HI>'s Advice.</P>
<P><Q>Blessed is he that Readeth, and they that Hear the Words of this Prophecy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. I. 3.</NOTE> and keep these Things which are Written therein.</Q> And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ch. xxiii. 7.</NOTE> <Q>Blessed is he that keepeth the Sayings of the Prophecy of this Book.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002509_0012_0FDB66170D503018"/>
And he enforces it with these Solemn Threat∣nings.</P>
<P><Q>For I testify unto every Man that heareth the Words of the Prophecy of this Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> If any Man shall add unto these Things, God shall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And if any Man shall take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay from the Words of the Book of this Prophecy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> God shall take away his Part out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things which are written in this Book.</Q></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the <HI>Three Periods</HI> in the 12th Chapter of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> contained in these Words,</HEAD>
<P><Q>AND I heard the Man Cloathed in Linnen which was upon the Waters of the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan XII 7.8.9.10.11.12.13.</NOTE> when he held up his Right Hand and his Left Hand unto Heaven, and Sware by Him that liveth forever, That it shall be for a <HI>Time, Times and a half;</HI> and when <HI>He</HI> shall have accomplished to scatter the Power of the Holy People, all these things shall be finished.</Q></P>

<P>THe three Periods, are <HI>Time, Times and a half, One Thousand Two Hundred &amp; Ninty Days,</HI> and <HI>One Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty Five Days.</HI> And that their Meaning and Connection
<PB N="13" REF="002509_0015_0FDB661F9A5ECB20"/>with one another may appear, it will be necessary to take the whole Passage which <HI>I</HI> have cited, in the Order in which it lies, and explain every Expression in it particulary, as <HI>I</HI> go along.</P>
<P>"And <HI>I</HI> heard the <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii 7.</NOTE> "which was upon the Waters of the River.</P>
<P>This <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen,</HI> is amply descri∣bed in the beginning of this Vision, which com∣prehends all the three last Chapters of <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. X. 1.</NOTE> and <HI>was Revealed unto</HI> Daniel—<HI>in the third year of</HI> Cyrus—as he <HI>was by the side of the great River,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> <HI>which is</HI> Hiddekel.</P>
<P><Q>Behold, a certain <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> whose Loyns were girded with Fine Gold of <HI>Uphaz,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>His Body also was like the <HI>Beryl,</HI> and his Face as the Appearance of Lightning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> and his Eyes as Lamps of Fire, and is Arms and his Feet like, in Colour, to polished Brass, and the Voice of his Words like the Voice of a Multitude.</Q></P>
<P>This Description is, evidently, of the same Person who is Represented in St. <HI>John,</HI>— <Q>like
<PB N="14" REF="002509_0016_0FDB6623420F7F10"/>to the Son of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. I. 13.</NOTE> Cloathed with a Garment down to the Foot, and girt about the Paps with a Golden Girdle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His Head and his Hairs were White like Wool,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> as White as Snow, and his Eyes were as a Flame of Fire;</Q></P>
<P><Q>And his Feet like unto Fine Brass, as if they burned in a Furnace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> and his Voice as the Sound of many Waters.</Q></P>
<P>Where <HI>Waters</HI> in St. <HI>John</HI> answer to <HI>Multitude</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XVII. 15.</NOTE> according to St. <HI>John</HI>'s own Interpre∣tation, <HI>The Waters which thou sawest—are Peoples and Multitudes—</HI></P>
<P>And in what Sense he wears a <HI>Golden Girdle,</HI> is Explained by this place of <HI>Isaiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. XI. 5.</NOTE> <HI>And Righ∣teousness shall be the Girdle of his Loyns, and Faithfulness the Girdle of his Reins.</HI></P>
<P>The same Person is again described in St. <HI>John,</HI> as—<HI>A Mighty Angel come down from Heaven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. X. 1.</NOTE> <HI>cloathed with a Cloud, and a Rain-bow was upon his Head, and his Face was, as it were, the Sun, and his Feet as Pillars of Fire.</HI></P>
<P>And the Account that <HI>Daniel</HI> gives, That he
<PB N="15" REF="002509_0017_0FDB670E9AB111A0"/>—<HI>alone saw the Vision;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. X. 7.</NOTE> <HI>for the Men that were with him saw not the Vision, but a great Quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves,</HI> is a Circumstance that Confirms this Opinion, That the <HI>Person</HI> is the <HI>same</HI> who appeared to St. <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. IX. 7.</NOTE> when <HI>the Men who journeyed with him stood Speechless, hearing a Voice, but seeing no Man;</HI> which Voice said, <HI>I am Jesus whom thou Persecutest.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE></P>
<P>The same Person is Represented by <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Vision of —<HI>the third of Belshazzar— standing before him as the Appearance of a Man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 15.16.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>And I heard a Mans Voice between the Banks of</HI> Ulai, <HI>which called, and said,</HI> Gabriel, <HI>make this Man understand the Vision.</HI></P>
<P>Where <HI>Gabriel</HI> receives Orders from the other, who is his Superior. And in the same manner in the Vision of <HI>the third of Cyrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan: X. 5, 8.</NOTE> <HI>The Man Cloathed in Linnen,</HI> struck <HI>Daniel</HI> so with <HI>This great Vision,</HI> that <HI>no strength remained in him.</HI> And it is manifestly another inferior Person that is represented as an <HI>Hand that touched him, which set him upon his Knees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>
<HI>and upon the Palms of his Hands.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002509_0018_0FDB662495DED8B0"/>
And said unto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE> <HI>O Daniel▪ a Man greatly beloved, Understand the Words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright, for unto thee am I now sent</HI>—.</P>
<P>By which Words this last may be discovered to be <HI>Gabriel,</HI> that was, in a former Vision, ordered to make him <HI>Understand the Vision;</HI> and it is put out of all doubt, that it is he, by the Continuance of his Discourse in the Vision of the third of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> where he acknowledges <HI>That</HI> Michael <HI>one of the chief Princes came to help</HI> him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. X. 13.</NOTE> and that <HI>there was none that holdeth with him in these things but Michael your Prince.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE></P>
<P>And that this Observation may have its full Extent, it may be Remarked, that after <HI>Daniels</HI> Prayer in the first of <HI>Darius,</HI> he says: <HI>Yea, whiles I was speaking in Prayer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. IX. 21.</NOTE> <HI>even the Man</HI> Gabriel, <HI>whom I had seen in the Vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the Evening Oblation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And he informed me, and talked with me, and said,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE> <HI>O</HI> Daniel! <HI>I am now come forth to give thee Skill and Understanding.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002509_0019_0FDB6627E7173F78"/>
Now there is <HI>No Vision at the beginning,</HI> in this discourse, but only a <HI>Prayer,</HI> and all the <HI>Vision</HI> comes after: By which it may be under∣stood, that <HI>Daniel</HI> means, That <HI>Gabriel</HI> was the Person of whom he says in the Vision of the first of <HI>Belshazzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 16.</NOTE> <Q>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and ask'd him the Truth of all this; so he told me, and made me know the Interpretation of the Things.</Q></P>
<P>And this is the first Vision, or <HI>the Vision at the beginning,</HI> in order of Time, which <HI>Daniel</HI> is said to have had peculiarly to himself, tho' he interpreted the Visions of others before; and accordingly it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">cap viii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>In the third Year of the Reign of King Belshazzar, a Vision appeared unto me, even unto me</HI> Daniel, <HI>after that which appeared unto me at the first.</HI> Which must be that in the seventh Chapter.</P>
<P>In the same manner it is, that St. <HI>John</HI> in the close of the <HI>Revelations</HI> speaks of <HI>Gabriel</HI> and <HI>Michael,</HI> tho' in other Words, when he says,</P>
<P><HI>The Lord God of the Holy Prophets s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Angel to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w unto his Servants the Things which

<P>And indeed, as the Lamb alone was worthy to <HI>Open the Book and to loose the Seals thereof.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">chap. v 2, 5, 9.</NOTE> He alone, was that <HI>Michael the great Prince, who standeth up for the Children of the People;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan xii. 1,</NOTE> to whom <HI>Daniel</HI> belonged, and alone could answer that Question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">chap. 8.13.</NOTE> that is proposed to him, by <HI>the other Saint, who asked that certain Saint, How long should be the Vision concerning the daily Sacrifice?</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Where it must be Observed, That the word Translated <HI>Other,</HI> in Verse 5. may signifie like∣wise <HI>the Last,</HI> and is here to be taken in that sence, meaning <HI>Michael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">chap. 12.1.</NOTE> (who was mentioned just before) and <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who had been speaking to <HI>Daniel</HI> all the while, from the end of the X Chapter till the very preceeding Verse. And when he had done speaking, <HI>Daniel</HI> is Repre∣sented as coming out of a profound Attention, which the Angel's Silence put an end to; Then, as was natural, he <HI>Looked up, and behold,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">chap 12.5.</NOTE> <HI>there stood these last Two,</HI> &amp;c. And in the next Verse the Words Translated, <HI>Upon the Waters of the River,</HI> may be rendred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> <HI>Highest up the stream of the River,</HI> which is exactly conformable to the Original. And according to this Interpretation, the <HI>Man cloathed in Linnen,</HI> may be <HI>One</HI> of the <HI>Two</HI> in the former Verse; and the <HI>Other</HI> is He that speaks in the beginning of the sixth Verse, where the word <HI>[One]</HI> is put in to compleat the Sense, but is not in the Original, and really alters
<PB N="20" REF="002509_0022_0FDB662F4F747778"/>the Meaning. All which is perfectly conform∣able to the Description in the viii Chapter at the 13 and 16 Verses.</P>
<P>All these Descriptions perfectly agree with Our Saviour's Office of <HI>High-Priest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ix. 11,</NOTE> <HI>Of good Things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with Hands;</HI> for which Reason He is <HI>entred into Heaven it self now to appear in the Presence of God for us.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">24,</NOTE> And there∣fore he is the only Person who can consult the Spiritual <HI>Urim and Thuminim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xxxiii 8,</NOTE> and give answer to those who are <HI>Jews by the Circumcision of the heart.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ii. 29,</NOTE></P>
<P>I have been the more tedious and particular in Discovering who those <HI>Two Persons</HI> (menti∣oned by <HI>Daniel</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>) are, because it is a strong Argument to prove, that the Subject on which they are Represented, speaking in the same manner, in different Visions, is really the very same Subject, and that therefore the VIII. Chapter of <HI>Daniel</HI> is to be Explained by the same Key with the VII and XII Chapters, and with the XII, XIII and XVII Chapters of St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Revelations.</HI> And of this Observation
<PB N="21" REF="002509_0023_0FDB66308E97E6A0"/>I shall make great Use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 11,</NOTE> when I come to Explain the Taking away <HI>the Daily,</HI> and Setting up <HI>the Abomination that maketh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esclare.</HI></P>
<P>And now that I have enquired, Who was this <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen, which was upon the Waters of the River,</HI> and what was the Occasion upon which he is here Represented in this Solemn Manner, I go on to Explain what is meant by this Expression.</P>
<P><Q>—When He held up His Right Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 7,</NOTE> and His Left Hand unto Heaven, and Sware by Him that liveth forever.</Q></P>
<P>The manner of a Solemn Appeal to God, by Holding up both Hands towards Heaven, was Practised by <HI>Moses,</HI> when the <HI>Israelites</HI> Fought with the <HI>Amalekites.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xvii. 12.</NOTE> And what follows, Ex∣plains the Reason of this Posture; for after the Lord had promised <HI>Moses Utterly</HI> to Destroy <HI>Amaleck, Moses</HI> says, <HI>The Lord hath Sworn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">16,</NOTE> <HI>That the Lord will have War with</HI> Amaleck <HI>from Generation to Generation.</HI></P>
<P>In which word, the Expression <HI>[The Lord
<PB N="22" REF="002509_0024_0FDB6632CBDACA40"/>hath Sworn]</HI> is in the Original <HI>[The Hand upon the Throne of the Lord]</HI> which <HI>Throne of God</HI> is <HI>Heaven.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. v. 34,</NOTE> From whence it is plain, that <HI>Lifting up the Hands unto Heaven,</HI> was a Posture used in the most Solemn Oaths, and accordingly it is described in <HI>Daniel,</HI> where these words follow, <HI>And Sware by him that Liveth For Ever.</HI> This Oath is the same with that in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Revelations,</HI> and (as I have already shewn) taken by the <HI>same Person,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. x. 5.</NOTE> where <Q>The Angel which stood upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, Lifted up His Hand to Heaven,</Q></P>
<P><Q>And Sware by him that liveth forever and ever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> who Created Heaven, and the Things that therein are; and the Earth, and the Things that therein are; and the Sea, and the Things which are therein,—</Q></P>
<P>It has been already shewn, who that Angel was, and as the Substance of the Oath which follows, is a Prophecy, so it was the Character of the High-Priest in Office to Prophecy; which is observed by St. <HI>John,</HI> upon the Advice that <HI>Caiphas</HI> gave the <HI>Jews, viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002509_0025_0FDB6636CFE15690"/>
<Q>That it was expedient that one Man Dye for the People. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. xi. 50,</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><Q>And this spake he not of himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">51,</NOTE> but being High-Priest that year, he Prophesied that Jesus should dye for that Nation;</Q></P>
<P><Q>And not for that Nation only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">52,</NOTE> but that also he should gather together the Children of God that were scattered abroad.</Q></P>
<P>It was therefore in the Exercise of the Priestly Office, that the <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the <HI>Mighty Angel</HI> in St. <HI>John,</HI> are Repre∣sented as declaring the Will of God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> Of the Number of Years meant by Time, Times, and an Half.</HEAD>
<P>THIS leads me to the subject matter of this <HI>Solemn Oath,</HI> which is in <HI>Daniel</HI> thus ex∣pressed.</P>
<P><Q>That it shall be for a <HI>Time, Times, and an half,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 7,</NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="002509_0026_0FDB663815805560"/>and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the Power of the Holy People, all these things shall be finished.</Q></P>
<P>And in St. <HI>John</HI> the same is intended by the following words,</P>
<P>"—That there should be Time no longer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. x. 5. 6,</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>But in the Days of the Voice of the Seventh Angel, when he shall begin to Sound, the My∣stery of God should be finished, as he has de∣clared by his Servants the Prophets.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI>'s Expression,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 7,</NOTE> <HI>That it shall be for a Time, Times, and an half,</HI> refers to the Question in the fore-going Verse,</P>
<P><Q>How long shall it be to the End of these Wonders?<NOTE PLACE="marg">9</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And that Question obliges the Reader to observe, That it is at the End of a long Scries of Prophecy, which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan at Chap. X. and is there introduced in this manner,</P>
<P><Q>Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy People in the Latter Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. x. 14,</NOTE> for yet the Vision is for many Days.</Q> And again,</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002509_0027_0FDB663BCC531B08"/>
<Q>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the Scripture of Truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The same Introduction is to be found in the VIII Chapter, where <HI>Gabriel</HI> is sent <HI>to make him understand the Vision.</HI> Who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 16.</NOTE> upon that tells <HI>Daniel,</HI><Q>Understand, O Son of Man, for at the Time of the End shall be the Vision.</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE> And afterwards,</P>
<P><Q>—Behold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> I will make thee know what shall be in the Last End of the Indignation, for at the Time appointed, the End shall be.</Q> And concludes,</P>
<P>"—It shall be for many Days.<NOTE PLACE="marg">26,</NOTE>"</P>
<P>And to the same effect <HI>Daniel</HI> informs <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar;</HI> That <Q>there is a God in Heaven that revealeth Secrets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 28.</NOTE> and maketh known to King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> what shall be in the Latter Days.</Q></P>
<P>And in the Vision of the first of <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> The Period, <Q>Until a Time, Times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 25.26.</NOTE> and the dividing of Time," is applyed to a Power, whose Dominion was to be taken away, to consume and destroy it unto the End.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002509_0028_0FDB663E2179FA10"/>
By comparing of all which Characters of the Time, as I did before of the Persons represented in the Visions, it is evident, that the II. VII. VIII. and XII. Chapters of <HI>Daniel</HI> relate to one and the same Subject, and are to be made use of to Explain and Illustrate one another; and if that is not sufficient to give light to the Prophecy, we will find an entire satisfaction by observing where St. <HI>John</HI> treats of the same Period, both in the words of <HI>Daniel,</HI> when he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XII 14.</NOTE> that <Q>the Woman is Nourished in the Wilderness for a Time, Times and half a Time</Q> and in other Words, which mean the same thing, and in one place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 6.</NOTE> relate to the same <Q>Woman in the Wilderness that they should feed her there a Thousand Two Hundred and Three Score Days.</Q> And upon another Occasion relate to the Witnesses, <Q>who shall Prophecy during a Thousand Two Hundred and Three Score Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. XI. 3.</NOTE> Cloathed in Sack-Cloath.</Q></P>
<P>The same Period is again mentioned under another Measure of the same Time, when it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XI. 2.</NOTE> that <Q>the Gentiles shall tread under the
<PB N="27" REF="002509_0029_0FDB663F9246E8C8"/>Holy City <HI>Forty and Two Months:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XIII. 5.</NOTE></Q> and <Q><HI>That the Mouth speaking</HI> great things, shall have Power given him to continue <HI>Forty and Two Months.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is very plain from all these Passages compared, that, <HI>Time, Times, and a half, One Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days,</HI> and <HI>Forty Two Months,</HI> mean all the same thing, and consequently, that the Word <HI>Time</HI> signifies a Year, <HI>Times,</HI> two Years, and <HI>half a Time,</HI> half a Year, since three Years and a half, consisting of Three Hundred and Sixty Days each, make just One Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days, or Forty Two Months; and it is well known, that the most ancient Year among the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> was divided in their Kalendar into Twelve Months of just Thirty Days each, which makes just Three Hundred and Sixty Days.</P>
<P>The only thing that has any Difficulty in these places which I have quoted, is, to know what is here meant by a <HI>Day.</HI> It will be very obvious by considering the many things that are to be done in the time of <HI>One Thousand Two Hundred
<PB N="28" REF="002509_0030_0FDB6643378760B8"/>and Sixty Days,</HI> that they cannot possibly be done in the space of three natural Years and a half; but it comes then to be inquired, by what it can be certainly known, what they mean, and in this the Books of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophet <HI>Ezekid,</HI> have given all the light that can be desired.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ev. XXIII. 3.</NOTE> In the Institution of the Sabbath, where it is plain that the <HI>Sabbath of Days,</HI> which every Person was to keep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. XXV. 4.</NOTE> represented another <HI>Sabbath of Years, which the Land was to keep.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> denounces Gods Judg∣ments on the <HI>Jews</HI> for Murmuring at the Report which the Spys brought back of the Land of <HI>Cenaan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. XIV. 34.</NOTE> he tells them <Q>After the Number of the Days in which ye searched the Land, even Forty Days (each Day for a Year) shall ye bear your iniquity's, even Forty Years.—</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, In Ezekiel</HI>'s Vision concerning the Siege of <HI>Jerusalem:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. IV. 4.</NOTE> He is commanded to <Q><HI>Lie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> his <HI>left Side,</HI> and lay the iniquity of the House of <HI>Israel</HI> upon it, according to the Number of the Days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="002509_0031_0FDB66458CA12B68"/>
<Q>For I have laid upon thee the Years of their iniquity, acording to the Number of the Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> Three Hundred and Ninety Days, so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the House of <HI>Israel.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And when thou hast accomplished them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6,</NOTE> lie again on thy <HI>right Side,</HI> and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the House of <HI>Judah</HI> Forty Days, I have appointed thee each Day for a Year.</Q></P>
<P>These passages seem to be so full and clear a Proof, that it was a Figure well understood among the <HI>Jews,</HI> to use a <HI>Day</HI> to signifie a <HI>Year,</HI> that I would not add any thing further on the Subject, if <HI>Daniel</HI> himself did not furnish an instance of his using it, which may be easily cleared up by History, but is very difficult to be apprehended in any other way of Interpre∣tation.</P>
<P><HI>When a Hand touched Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. X. 10.11.13.</NOTE> and it was said to him, <HI>Unto thee am I now sent. Gabriel</HI> goes on to inform him, that <Q><HI>The Prince of the King∣dom of</HI> Persia <HI>withstood</HI> him <HI>One and Twenty Days;</HI> and adds, <HI>But lo, Michael, one of the
<PB N="30" REF="002509_0032_0FDB6647CB7B1A28"/>Chief Princes came to help me, and I remained there with the Kings of</HI> Persia.</Q></P>
<P>Now it is known from History, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had been <HI>One and Twenty Years</HI> chosen Prince or General of the <HI>Persians,</HI> who were then a distinct Nation from the <HI>Medes,</HI> before the destruction of <HI>Babylon,</HI> in which <HI>Cyrus</HI> joyned his Uncle <HI>Cyax∣ares,</HI> called in Scripture <HI>Darius</HI> the <HI>Mede,</HI> and so it was One and Twenty Years before that Prince was ready to execute the design of Pro∣vidence in that great Expedition which brought about the Deliverance of the <HI>Jews</HI> out of the Captivity, whose Prince was <HI>Mich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> and ac∣cordingly it was this <HI>Michael,</HI> who is likewise, <HI>The Lord that stirred upon the Spirit of</HI> C,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron.

I. 1.2.3.4</NOTE> <HI>King of</HI> Persia, (in the first year of his Reign in <HI>Babylon</HI>) <Q>that he made a Proclamation thro'-out all his Kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus saith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> The Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and he hath charged me to build him an House an <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which is in <HI>Judah.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002509_0033_0FDB664BAC8FEDB0"/>
<Q>Who is there among you of all his People?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezra. 1.3.</NOTE> His God be with him, and let him go up to <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> which is in <HI>Judah,</HI> and build the House of the Lord God of <HI>Israel,</HI> he is the God which is in <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> let the Men of his Place help him with Silver, and with Gold, and with Goods, and with Beasts, besides the Free-will Offering for the House of God that is in <HI>Je∣rusalem.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This may be compared with <HI>Isaiah,</HI> where we find, <HI>That</HI> the Lord <Q>saith of <HI>Cyrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. XLIV. 28.</NOTE> He is my Shepherd, and shall perform all my Pleasure, even saying to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Thou shalt be built, and to the Temple, Thy Foundation shall be laid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus saith the Lord to his Anointed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">XLV. 1.2 3.4.</NOTE> to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> whose Right Hand I have holden, to <HI>Subdue Nations before him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All this seems a natural Explanation of that <HI>Verse</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> and Confirms the Observation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. X. 13.</NOTE> That <HI>Days</HI> were used in the Figurative Stile to
<PB N="32" REF="002509_0034_0FDB664D0B5A1508"/>signifie <HI>Years,</HI> even in the Account of Things past, by the same Prophet, who imploys them in that Sense in his Predictions of Things to come, as in the <HI>Two Thousand three Hundred Days,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>But before I leave this Subject, I must not omit an Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple in the Gospel, where our Sa∣viour himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uses a <HI>Day</HI> for a <HI>Year,</HI> when</P>
<P>— <Q>There came certain of the Pharisees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lake XIII. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>
<PB N="33" REF="002509_0035_0FDB664F4D2A3D40"/>saying unto Him, Get thee out, and depart hence, for <HI>Herod</HI> will kill thee.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he said unto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE> Go ye and tell that Fox, Behold, I cast out Devils, and I do Cures <HI>to Day</HI> and <HI>to Morrow,</HI> and the <HI>Third Day</HI> I shall be Perfected.</Q></P>
<P>"Nevertheless,<NOTE PLACE="marg">33</NOTE> I must Walk <HI>to Day</HI> and <HI>to "Morrow,</HI> and the <HI>Day following—</HI></P>
<P>In this place it cannot be our Saviour's meaning that he had but <HI>Three days</HI> to live; but that He was by His Father appointed to carry on His Ministry <HI>Three full Years;</HI> And this was the full <HI>Number of Years</HI> which he was to <HI>Perfect</HI> or Compleat, besides a few Months, which not making up so much as <HI>half a Year,</HI> are not mentioned in this short and occasional Reply.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that by a <HI>Day,</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> it was usual, in the Figurative Stile, to mean a <HI>Year,</HI> and so this Period of <HI>Time, Times and an Half,</HI> or <HI>Forty two Months,</HI> or <HI>One thousand two hundred and sixty Days,</HI> may justly be allowed to signifie <HI>One thousand two hundred and sixty Years.</HI> And here some Eminent Chronologists
<PB N="34" REF="002509_0036_0FDB6652F48B9960"/>have endeavoured to shew, that since every one of these Years did consist but of <HI>three hundred and sixty days</HI> among the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> that in the adding up of the Sum, no more natural Days should be counted than 1260 times 360, which would shorten the Term by more than five days in every year. But it must be considered, that neither the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> nor indeed any other Na∣tion, did at the end of a considerable number of common or Solar Years, count any more than we now do, but that they either suffered five days to pass over without counting them at the end of every year, or when in a few years they perceived the Seasons to go contrary to their Ka∣lender, they threw in a Month extraordinary, to bring them right; and whatever way they varied this, still we find, in effect, that they counted no more years, at the long run, than the Sun actually performed; and therefore we must follow their Method through-out, and according to their Kalender allow no more than 360 days to a year, in computing the number of the <HI>Figurative Days,</HI> which signifie <HI>Years.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen we consider
<PB N="35" REF="002509_0037_0FDB6653D13712F0"/>how many of these Years are past and gone, we must not only Observe the Kalender, but also make the same Allowances that the Antients did, from time to time, and then we are sure to agree with them in every part of our Calculation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> The Method of the following Enquiry.</HEAD>
<P>AND now that I have sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn what is meant by <HI>Time, Times and a Half,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. XII. 7.</NOTE> I go on to con∣sider what is meant by the words that follow,</P>
<P><Q><HI>And when He shall have accomplished to scatter the Power of the holy People, all these things shall be finished.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Expression is very short, but sufficient to Remind <HI>Daniel,</HI> that it should certainly come to pass, as he had been informed already in the Vision of the <HI>Four Beasts,</HI> That <Q><HI>He</HI> shall speak great Words against the most High,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. VII. 25.</NOTE> and shall
<PB N="36" REF="002509_0038_0FDB6657A80400D8"/>wear out the Saints of the most High, and think to change Times and Laws; and they shall be given into his hands until a <HI>Time, and Times, and the dividing of Time.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Sameness</HI> of the Period shews plainly, that the <HI>[He]</HI> is the same in both these Places; and the Description of <HI>Wearing out the Saints of the most High,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap XII. 7.</NOTE> is very agreeable to that of <HI>Scatter∣ing the Power of the holy People;</HI> And <HI>their be∣ing given into his hand until Time,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VII 25.</NOTE> <HI>Times,</HI> &amp;c. has the same Force with, <HI>When he shall have accomplished to scatter the Power of the holy People,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XII 7.</NOTE> <HI>all these shall be finished,</HI> that is, <HI>All these Time, Times,</HI> &amp;c. for the word <HI>[things]</HI> is not in the Original.</P>
<P>All that is wanting to understand these two Places, is to know who is meant by this <HI>[He]</HI> and that is to be learn't more particularly from the preceeding Verse in the VII Chapter.</P>
<P>— <Q><HI>Ten Kings</HI> that shall arise, and another shall rise after them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. VII. 24.</NOTE> and <HI>He</HI> shall be diverse from the first, and <HI>He</HI> shall subdue <HI>Three</HI> Kings.</Q> And then follows,</P>

<P>But as this is the latter end of a Vision, that consists of several parts, which by the Descrip∣tion are Explained to be Successive to one another, it is not possible to apprehend the full Evidence of what is meant by these last Words, without observing their Connection and Consistency with what goes before, and with other Visions on the same Matter; and then it will, I believe, be past dispute, to what they relate, and to what Period of Time alone they can be applyed.</P>
<P>They are part of the first Vision which <HI>Daniel</HI> himself had Originally, as I observed before, which was in the first of <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> and this Vision contains a general Abridgment of the Hi∣story of what was to happen from his own Time downwards, in a distinct Method, which he himself expresses thus, in short,</P>
<P>"These great Beasts which are Fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> are "<HI>Your Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 17.</NOTE> which shall arise out of the Earth.</P>

<P><PB N="38" REF="002509_0040_0FDB665B4C2F04C0"/>
The same Series of History had been expressed as methodically, but not so particularly in the Vision which <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> saw, and which <HI>Daniel</HI> interpreted to him, and ended with telling him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 45.</NOTE> that <Q>The Great God had made known to the King what should come to pass hereafter.</Q></P>
<P>The Vision of the <HI>third of Belshazzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. X. XI. XII.</NOTE> and that of the <HI>third of Cyrus,</HI> serve in most parti∣culars, to illustrate and explain that of the <HI>frst of Belshazzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII</NOTE> and all these considered together, are sufficient to clear up History, till the latter Period of the <HI>fourth Beast,</HI> and to make that more evident, what is in <HI>Daniel</HI> must be compared with the descriptions given by St. <HI>John</HI> in his <HI>Revelations</HI> of The <HI>great Red Dragon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XII. 3. XIII▪ 1.111 XVII. 7.</NOTE> and of <HI>The Beast</HI> which <HI>rose up out of the Sea;</HI> and of <HI>The other Beast which came up out of the Earth:</HI> And of <HI>the Woman and the Beast that carrieth her.</HI></P>
<P>Now that all these things may be considered in their proper place and order, there does not seem to be a more natural and easy Method, than first to go through <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s Vision
<PB N="39" REF="002509_0041_0FDB665ED51A63B8"/>of the <HI>great Image,</HI> with <HI>Daniel</HI>'s interpretation of it, and then to resume the same Subject as it is represented to <HI>Daniel</HI> himself under the figure of <HI>four Beasts,</HI> and there to take in the concurring places of Scripture which generally allude to that figure, and but seldom to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s <HI>great Image.</HI></P>
<P>This last therefore as it is a compleat abridg∣ment of it self, will give the most familiar and easy notion of the main Scope of <HI>Daniel</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>'s Prophecies, and when that is well apprehended, it may be attempted with better Success to range in order the particular branches of them, and the circumstances which have attended the great turns and most remarkable changes which have happened in the World.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> Nebuchadnezzars Vision of the great Image.</HEAD>
<P><Q>IN the second Year of the Reign of <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> dreamed Dreams, wherewith his Spirit was troubled, and his Sleep brake from him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then the King commanded to call the Magicians and the Astrologers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> and the Sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the King his Dreams, so they came and stood before the King.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the King said unto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> I have dreamed a Dream, and my Spirit was troubled to know the Dream.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then spake the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> to the King in <HI>Syriack,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> O King, live forever! Tell thy Ser∣vants the Dream, and we will shew the Interpretation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The King answered and said to the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>
<PB N="41" REF="002509_0043_0FDB66615EA24CE8"/>the thing is gone from me, if ye will not make known unto me the Dream, with the Inter∣pretation thereof, ye shall be cut in Pieces and your Houses shall be made a Dunghill.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But if ye shew the dream and the Inter∣pretation thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. II. 6.</NOTE> ye shall receive of me Gifts and Rewards, and great Honour, therefore shew me the Dream and the Interpretation thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They answered again, and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> let the King tell his Servants the Dream, and we will shew the Interpretation of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The King answered and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> I know of certainty, that ye would gain the Time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But if ye will not make known unto me the Dream, there is but one decree for you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE> for ye have prepared Lying and Corrupt Words to speak before me, till the Time be changed, therefore tell me the Dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the Interpretation thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Chaldeans</HI> answered before the King, and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> there is not a Man upon the Earth
<PB N="42" REF="002509_0044_0FDB6664F08E63B0"/>that can shew the King's Matter, therefore there is no King, Lord, nor Ruler that asked such things of any <HI>Magician,</HI> or <HI>Astrologer,</HI> or <HI>Chaldean.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And it is a rare thing that the King requireth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE> and there is none other that can shew it before the King, except the Gods whose dwelling is not with Flesh.</Q></P>
<P>By all this Discourse it is plain that <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar</HI> believed that these <HI>Wise Men,</HI> &amp;c. had a supernatural Art,. and if they had, he argued justly, that they could as well tell him the <HI>Dream,</HI> as the certain Interpretation or <HI>Accomplishment.</HI></P>
<P>But whether the <HI>Wise Men</HI> pretended to this supernatural Art till now that they were forced to own the contrary, or whether they were only Men of Learning, and it was the superstition of the People, and not their own Pretensions, that made them pass for <HI>Conjurors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. I. 20. chap. II. 13,</NOTE> as seems most probable, since <HI>Daniel &amp; his Fellows</HI> were reckon'd among them.</P>
<P>However that was, They were, it seems, obliged upon this occasion to undeceive <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="002509_0045_0FDB6665CDA729B8"/>and accordingly they gave him an Answer that disown'd any supernatural Art in themselves, and allowed that none but the Gods could Answer such a Question as the Kings, which Gods they did not pretend <HI>dwelt with Flesh,</HI> that is, inspired them.</P>
<P>It seems therefore, that all that they now pretended to, was to be skilled in that figurative Language, which had been usually employed in true Prophetical Revelations, and so could without any inspiration explain the importance of the Terms, and put the matter into Words commonly used and easily apprehended.</P>
<P>In the same manner it seems to have been that the <HI>Magicians</HI> in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Court imployed their Art and Skill to impose upon him, as far as Jugling Tricks would go. But where their Tricks failed them, they cryed out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. VIII. 19</NOTE> <HI>This is the Finger of God.</HI> By which they gave up all Pretence to being themselves Divinely Inspi∣red.</P>
<P>But <HI>Daniel</HI> when he was brought before the King, gave him a proof or a <HI>Sign,</HI> that what
<PB N="44" REF="002509_0046_0FDB6668189C4330"/>he was going to explain, would really come to pass, since he told him what no Body could know but God and the King himself, when he was reminded of his Dream.</P>
<P><Q>The King answered and said to <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 26,</NOTE> whose name was <HI>Belteshazzar,</HI> Art thou able to make known unto me the Dream which I have seen, and the Interpretation thereof?</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Daniel</HI> answered in the presence of the King and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE> The Secret which the King hath demanded, cannot the <HI>Wise Men,</HI> the <HI>Astrolo∣gers,</HI> the <HI>Magicians,</HI> the <HI>Southsayers</HI> shew unto the King.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But there is a God in Heaven that revealeth Secrets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28,</NOTE> and maketh known to the King <HI>Ne∣buchadnezzar,</HI> what shall be in the latter Days.—</Q></P>
<P><Q>As for thee, O King, thy thoughts came into thy Mind upon thy Bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29,</NOTE> what should come to pass hereafter, and he that revealeth Secrets, maketh known unto thee what shall come to pass.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But as for me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE> this Secret is not revealed
<PB N="45" REF="002509_0047_0FDB666B0D757EE0"/>to me for any Wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the Interpretation to the King, and that thou mightst know the thoughts of thy Heart.</Q></P>
<P>Where <HI>Daniel</HI> gives two Reasons why God has instructed him in the <HI>Kings Matter,</HI> one that he might be inclined to deal favourably with the <HI>Jews</HI> now in Captivity, and the other that he might be well assured that what he was warned of in a Dream, would certainly come to pass, and was not a common Dream.</P>
<P>The Description of the <HI>Dream</HI> it self comes next.</P>
<P><Q>Thou, O King sawest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 31,</NOTE> and behold a great Image, this great Image, whose Brightness was Excellent, stood before thee, and the form thereof was Terrible.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This Images Head was of fine Gold, his Breast and his Arms of Silver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">32,</NOTE> his Belly and his Thighs of Brass.</Q></P>
<P>"His Legs of Iron, his Feet part of Iron "and part of Clay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">33,</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002509_0048_0FDB666D4D24A3A8"/>
<Q>Thou sawest till that a Stone was cut out without Hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">chap. ii. 34,</NOTE> which smote the Image upon his Feet that were of Iron and Clay, and brake them to pieces.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then was the Iron, the Clay, the Brass, the Silver and the Gold broken to pieces toge∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">35,</NOTE> and became like the Chaff of the Summer Thrafhing-Floors, and the Wind carried them away, that no place was found for them, and the Stone that smote the Image, became a great Mountain.</Q></P>
<P>"This is the Dream,<NOTE PLACE="marg">36,</NOTE> and we will tell the "Interpretation thereof before the King.</P>
<P>Thou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">37,</NOTE> O King, art a King of Kings, for the "God of Heaven hath given thee a Kingdom, "Fower, and Strength, and Glory.</P>
<P><Q>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heresoever the Children of Men dwell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">38,</NOTE> the Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of the Field and the Fowls of the Hea∣ven hath he given into thine Hand, and hath made thee Ruler over them all; Thou art this Head of Gold.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI> had before informed the King, That <HI>He who revealed Secrets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">29,</NOTE> <HI>made known unto the King what shall come to pass.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="002509_0049_0FDB66719A0E5190"/>
And therefore what was <HI>already past,</HI> was not to make any part of the Dream. The <HI>Assyrian</HI> Monarchy had been very Powerful, and the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Kingdom, (which was founded on the Ruins of it) had subsisted some years before <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> but it was the Design of this Prophetical Dream, to describe only what was <HI>Yet to come;</HI> and so the first Kingdom, meant by the <HI>Head of Gold,</HI> contained only <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> and his Followers to the Third Generation, as it is limited in <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s Prophecy,</P>
<P><Q>And now have I given all these Lands into the Hand of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerem. xxvii. 6.</NOTE> the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> my Servant, and the Beasts of the Field have I given him also, to serve him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And all Nations shall serve him, and his Son, and his Sons Son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> until the very time of his Land come, and then many Nations and great Kings shall serve themselves of him.</Q></P>
<P>He was, undoubtedly, the greatest Conqueror of his Time, and had Success where-ever he made War, and so was a <HI>King of Kings,</HI> or a great Monarch; and the Spoils of every Nation
<PB N="48" REF="002509_0050_0FDB6673605A9F90"/>which he attempted to Conquer, were <HI>given into his Hand.</HI> And this <HI>Babylonish Kingdom</HI> lasted till the Death of his Grand-Son <HI>Belshazzar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And after thee shall arise another Kingdom</HI> In∣ferior <HI>to thee</HI>—<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>The word <HI>Inferior</HI> denotes, That the second Kingdom was Represented by the <HI>Breast</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> which were <HI>lower</HI> in the <HI>Image</HI> than the <HI>Head,</HI> and were of Silver, a Mettal next, in order of Mettals, to Gold; and for the same reason, the Third is called, just after, <HI>The Kingdom of Brass,</HI> which carries on the Order observed in the Description of the <HI>Image;</HI> But neither of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Expressions means, that these Monarchies were less Considerable than the first.</P>
<P>This Second Kingdom was the Kingdom of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> which was the prevailing Monarchy after the taking of <HI>Babylon,</HI> till the Time of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great; and then came <HI>another Third Kingdom of Brass, which shall bear Rule over all the Earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>This <HI>Grecian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>archy,</HI> begun by <HI>Alexander,</HI> comprehended many Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> which
<PB N="49" REF="002509_0051_0FDB6676F3789708"/>had not submitted to either of the two first Mo∣narchies; and indeed, at its first setting up, took in all that was then considerably Peopled in the World, which is according to the Stile of the Scripture, meant by <HI>All the Earth.</HI> For the <HI>Romans</HI> were then a very small inconsiderable Colony, tho' afterwards they grew strong enough to put a Period to all the Branches of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Monarchy.</P>
<P>But the Expression, <HI>Shall bear Rule over all the Earth,</HI> may well be thought to relate further to a Time when the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire was to be set up again by <HI>Constantine,</HI> whose Dominion was much more Extensive than <HI>Alexander</HI>'s. I shall in the Sequel of this Discourse produce several probable Reasons for this last Interpretation. But now I must go on in Order.</P>
<P><Q>And the <HI>Fourth Kingdom</HI> shall be strong, as Iron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 40.</NOTE> forasmuch as Iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as Iron, that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</Q></P>
<P>This was the <HI>Roman Power,</HI> which Conquered all that had belonged to the <HI>Babylonish, Persian</HI> or
<PB N="50" REF="002509_0052_0FDB667B6AA432E0"/><HI>Grecian Monarchies;</HI> and this Power continued Strong and United for a very long period; but at last there came a very great Change in their Affairs, which is next described.</P>
<P><Q>And whereas thou sawest the Feet and Toes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE> part of Potters Clay, and part of Iron; The Kingdom shall be Divided, but there shall be in it of the Strength of the Iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the Iron mixed with Miry Clay.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And as the Toes of the Feet were part of Iron and part of Clay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE> so the Kingdom shall be partly Strong and partly Broken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas thou sawest Iron mixt with Miry Clay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE> they shall mingle themselves with the seed of Men, but they shall not Cleave one to another, even as Iron is not mixed with Clay.</Q></P>
<P>Here is an Account of the great Change in the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> when the <HI>Barbarons Nations,</HI> well described by <HI>Clay,</HI> possessed the Western part of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> and the <HI>Roman Em∣perors</HI> still preserved the Eastern part to Them∣selves:
<PB N="51" REF="002509_0053_0FDB667C4F3F9850"/>Thus <HI>They mingled themselves with the the Seed of Men:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. VI. 2.</NOTE> in the same Sence that <HI>The Sens of God saw the Daughters of Men,</HI> and <HI>took to them Wives, of all which they chose;</HI> That is, the Princes of the World took as many Wo∣men, among the common People, as they liked. And this appears to be <HI>Moses</HI>'s meaning, by what follows,</P>
<P><HI>When the Sons of God came in to the Daughters of Men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. VI. 4.</NOTE> <HI>they bore Children to them, the same be∣came Mighty Men, which were of Old, Men of Renown.</HI></P>
<P>In the same manner, when the Noble and Antient <HI>Roman Emperors</HI> were to share the Em∣pire with <HI>Mean and Upstart Nations,</HI> as the <HI>Goths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm LXXXII 6.</NOTE> <HI>Van<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>They</HI> (that is, these Emperors, who were as <HI>Gods</HI>) <HI>Mingled Themselves with the Seed of Men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 43.</NOTE> But <HI>they did not cleave one to an∣other.</HI> Their Dominions became entirely Sepe∣rate, and they did not interfer with one another in the same Countries, but subsisted at the same time as two Neighbouring Powers, till at last,</P>
<P><Q>And in the days of these Kings shall the God
<PB N="52" REF="002509_0054_0FDB667DCE1A69A0"/>of Heaven set up a Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE> which shall never be destroyed; and the Kingdom shall not be left to other People, but it shall break in pieces, and Consume all these Kingdoms, and it shall stand Forever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the Stone was cut out of the Mountain without Hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE> and that it brake in pieces the <HI>Iron,</HI> the <HI>Brass,</HI> the <HI>Clay,</HI> the <HI>Silver</HI> and the <HI>Gold,</HI> The great God hath made known unto the King what shall Come to Pass hereafter; and the Dream is Certain, and the Interpretation thereof Sure.</Q></P>
<P>This Represents the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> which being <HI>The Stone which the Builders Rejected,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke XX. 17.</NOTE> <HI>the same is become the Head of the Corner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whosoever shall fall upon that Stone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> <HI>shall be broken; and on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to Powder.</HI></P>
<P>One part of this has been fully Accomplished from our Saviour's Time to this day, upon all who have Persecuted the Followers of Christ, who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. II. 4.</NOTE> <HI>coming unto the Lord as a Living Stone, disallowed indeed of Men, but Chosen of God, and Precious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002509_0055_0FDB668224ACDEC8"/>
They <HI>also,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> <HI>as lively Stones are built up a Spi∣ritual House,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Their first Persecutors, the <HI>Heathen Roman Emperors,</HI> fell under the Conquering Sword of <HI>Constantine;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut.

<P>And the <HI>Protestant Interest</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> is now come to that Height, that it will not be very difficult for them, if they are again Provoked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke XX. 18.</NOTE> To <HI>Grind their Enemies to Powder.</HI></P>
<P>It is, evidently, to this Time, that <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Micah</HI> Refer, when they say,</P>
<P><HI>And it shall come to pass in the Last Days,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. II. 2. Micah IV. 1.</NOTE> <HI>that the Mountain of the Lord's House shall be Esta∣blished in the Top of the Mountains, and shall be Exalted above the Hills, and all Nations shall flow unto it.</HI></P>
<P>And the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> in another place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah XXIV 23.</NOTE> after he had described the <HI>Lord of Host's Reigning in</HI> Mount Zion <HI>&amp;</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and before his Antients gloriously,</HI> he adds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">XXV. 3.</NOTE> <HI>The City of the Terrible Na∣tions

<P>Here is a plain Allusion to <HI>Babylon,</HI> which be∣ing <HI>The Head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 31.</NOTE> gave the Name to <HI>This Image</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> whose Form was <HI>Terrible,</HI> and which did not loose its Name, even in the <HI>Branches,</HI> as appears by St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Mystery Babylon the great,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XVII. 5.</NOTE> <HI>written in the Womans Forchead.</HI> And this na∣turally leads me (now that I have Explain'd the several parts of this Dream) to make Two Ob∣servations upon the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. It may be observed, <HI>first,</HI> That the next Chapter where <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> (unmindful of the Warning of this Dream) sets up a <HI>Golden Image to be Worshipped,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Den. III. 1—6.</NOTE> is a good Illustration of the great Propriety of this Dream, to Represent the whole Scene of <HI>Tyranny</HI> that was to follow to the end of the World, which would be as one. <HI>Image</HI> or <HI>Idol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> which, <HI>Whoso falleth not down and Worshippeth, shall be cast into the Burning F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery Furnace.</HI> Though the Persons who have used this Cruel and Arbitrary Power, have been
<PB N="55" REF="002509_0057_0FDB66848B41E988"/>different, and the Form of Government has often Varied, yet it has not fared better with the People or Subjects: They have still continued in the same Slavery, tho' under different Masters, and this is still with the greater Propriety of Speech Represented by an <HI>Image</HI> or <HI>Idol,</HI> because the Superstitious Conceits of Mankind have been the chief Instruments of their Misery, for nothing imposed more on them than the Divine Honours that Princes often Assumed to Themselves in their Life Time, and which were Universally paid them, after their Death; and as this was the chief Source of the <HI>Heathen Religion,</HI> so it was by this Deceit chiefly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. XX. 25.</NOTE> that <HI>The Princes of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>Exercised Dominion Over them:</HI> for, <HI>First,</HI> The People was made to believe, that Kings after their Death were Translated to Heaven, and ought to be Worshiped as Gods, and from hence it grew Customany to make Statues, in Honour of them, before which the Ignorant Multitude used to Worship and offer Sacrifices: These Statues of Kings and Empe∣rours, St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls, <HI>These Dumb Idols,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor.

<PB N="56" REF="002509_0058_0FDB6688545C8E10"/>which the</HI> Gentiles <HI>were carried away;</HI> Whereas he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap.

<P><HI>But to us there is but One God— and One Lord.—</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> And again,</P>
<P><HI>What shall I say then,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. X. 19.</NOTE> <HI>that an Idol is any thing, or that which is offered in Sacrifice to Idols, is any thing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>But I say,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE> <HI>That the things which the</HI> Gentiles <HI>Sacrifice, they Sacrifice to Devils, and not to God.</HI>—</P>
<P>Where the word <HI>[Devils]</HI> should be rendred <HI>Daemons,</HI> which was the Name the <HI>Heathens</HI> gave to their Deified Princes, and means the same with those that were <HI>called Gods, as there be Gods many and Lords many.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor.

<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho' the great Quantity of Idols that were Worshipped, were in Honour of the
<PB N="57" REF="002509_0059_0FDB668A9DBC59B8"/>Dead, yet the Living Princes of the World had generally the same Honours paid them.</P>

<P>The Petition of the <HI>Princes</HI> to <HI>Darius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VI 6.</NOTE> to whom they also said, <HI>King</HI> Darius, <HI>live for ever,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> was <HI>to make a firm Decree, That whosoever shall ask a Petition of any God or Man for Thirty Days, save of thee, O King, shall be cast into the Den of Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>Which placed him in the stead of <HI>the Gods</HI> for that Time, and shews, that it was the Practice of the <HI>Persians</HI> to treat their Princes as <HI>Gods,</HI> while they were alive. In like manner, <HI>Alexander</HI> made himself be Worshipped as the Son of <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> and the <HI>Roman Empe∣rours Augustus</HI> and <HI>Domitian,</HI> while alive, were called <HI>Davi</HI> or <HI>Gods;</HI> And it grew a Custom after the <HI>Antonines,</HI> to adore the Emperours Pictures, which were fixed on the Standards of
<PB N="58" REF="002509_0060_0FDB668E655DEB00"/>the Army. So that the Idolizing of Princes in their Life Times, was practised under all the four Monarchies.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, that the <HI>Great Idol</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> was very properly used as a Represen∣tation of the Grand Imposture under living Princes, who were Worshipped as Gods, which was to continue to deceive the whole World from <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Time forward; and which St. <HI>John</HI> Expresses in another Figure, Representing only what was to come after his Time, by</P>
<P>A <HI>Red Dragon having Seven Heads and Ten Horns:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev X. I. 3.</NOTE> of which he afterwards says, <HI>And the great Dragon was cast out,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE> <HI>that Old Serpent, called, the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World.</HI></P>
<P>By which it appears, that the like Delusion had commenced long before the Period, or the <HI>great Image</HI> in <HI>Daniel,</HI> even from the first Time, that at the Instigation of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> that is, the Spirit of Ambition, and the love of Absolute Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen.

IV. 8.</NOTE> And by <HI>Cain's slaying his Brother Abel,</HI> we may observe, how early a Man assumed that Right over anothers Life, which belongs to God only, and which is the first Eminent instance of Arbitrary and Cruel Power.</P>
<P>The like Crime is Recorded of <HI>Lamech.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> And soon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VI. 11.</NOTE> <HI>the Earth was filled with Violence,</HI> for which Reason it appeared <HI>Corrupt before God,</HI> who sent a Deluge to <HI>Destroy</HI> all, except <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family.</P>
<P>It was not long after the Deluge, when among the Descendants of <HI>Ham,</HI> there arose <HI>Nimrod, who began to be a Mighty One in the Earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">X. 8.10.</NOTE> and whose Kingdom was at <HI>Babel</HI> (which is the same word in the Original that is elsewhere rendred <HI>Babylon</HI>) where they attempted <HI>to Build a City and a Tower, whose Top might reach to Heaven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 4.</NOTE> <HI>and to make them a Name, lest they should be scattered abroad over the Face of the whole Earth.</HI> And this design was directly in Opposition to Gods Command: <HI>Replenish the Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I 28.

<PB N="60" REF="002509_0062_0FDB66916F2371A0"/>from them, which they had imagined to do.</HI></P>
<P>And we find the same Ambitious Arbitrary Power afterwards Remarkably exercised by the <HI>Pharaohs;</HI> and in process of Time, sometimes <HI>Egypt,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Assyria</HI> had the greatest part of the World under them, till the Kingdom of <HI>Babylon</HI> was set up, which made the <HI>Golden Head</HI> in the <HI>great Image.</HI> And thus by a short View of Ancient History,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XII. 9.</NOTE> we see what had been all along the <HI>Idolatry</HI> that had <HI>deceived the whole World:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 31.</NOTE> Which <HI>Daniel</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> allude to in the <HI>great Image,</HI> and the <HI>Old Serpent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It must be Observed in the Second place, That the Image is supposed to remain entire in all its parts, <Q>Till that a Stone was cut out without Hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">II. 34.</NOTE> which smote the Image upon his Feet, that were of Iron and Clay, and brake them to Pieces.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then was the Iron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE> the Clay, the Brass, the Silver and the Gold broken to pieces together, and became like the Chaff of the Summer Threshing Floors, and the Wind
<PB N="61" REF="002509_0063_0FDB6694EFE27028"/>carried them away, that no place was found for them.</Q></P>
<P>The design of this is plainly to shew, that the distinguishing Characters of the several Mona∣chies should Continue during the whole Period; and in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XIII. 1.</NOTE> it agrees with the description of the <HI>Beast</HI> in St. <HI>John, That rises up out of the Sea:</HI> which will be found to be the <HI>Fourth Beast</HI> or <HI>Empire</HI> in its last Period, but it is described,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> <HI>Like unto a Leopard, with Feet like a Bear, and a Mouth like a Lyon.</HI></P>
<P>Which will appear to be the Beasts that Represented the <HI>Three First Monarchies</HI> in the same manner as the <HI>Brass, Silver and Gold</HI> of the <HI>Image</HI> had done.</P>
<P>Now this shews, how properly there ought to have been, (as there really has) a <HI>Babylon</HI> in the last Period of the <HI>great Image,</HI> which should notoriously assume the divine Honours formerly paid to <HI>Heathen Princes,</HI> and which the <HI>Christian Emperours</HI> were too Religious and Modest to accept: But the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> in his <HI>Babylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. V.</HI> Daniel's Vision of the Four great Beasts.</HEAD>
<P><Q>IN the first Year of <HI>Belshazzar</HI> King of <HI>Babylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan vii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Daniel</HI> had a Dream and Visions of his Head upon his Bed, then he wrote the Dream, and told the Sum of the Matters.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Daniel</HI> spake and said, I saw in my Vision by Night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> and behold the Four Winds of the Heaven strove upon the great Sea.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And Four great Beasts came up from the Sea diverse one from another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This is the first Vision, which we have an Account, was originally communicated to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aniel,</HI></P>
<P><HI>The four Winds of Heaven</HI> represent the Powers of the World, as in <HI>Jeremiah.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>Upon <HI>Elam</HI> will I bring the four Winds from the four Quarrers of Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iix 36.</NOTE> and I will scatter them towards all these Winds, and there shall be no Nation, whither the Out-casts of <HI>Elam</HI> shall not come.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="002509_0066_0FDB669B7A1DF1E8"/>
The <HI>great Sea</HI> being the place where the natural Winds have their full play, it is a proper Metaphor, for that Extent of Country which is the Scene of these <HI>Winds</HI> in the Figurative Sence, which are the contending Nations of the World.</P>
<P>And in this sence <HI>Isaiah</HI> says: <Q><HI>The Wicked</HI> are like the troubled Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. Lvii. 20.</NOTE> when it cannot rest, whose Waters cast up Mire and Dirt.</Q></P>
<P>The word <HI>Beasts</HI> is afterwards explained.</P>
<P><Q>These <HI>great Beasts</HI> which are four, are four Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. vii. 17.</NOTE> which shall arise out of the Earth.</Q></P>
<P>And this being all the Interpretation, given in this Chapter, of the three first <HI>Beasts,</HI> I shall Interpret every one singly, and, as I go along, consider what light other Chapters of <HI>Daniel</HI> afford to explain them.</P>
<P>The meaning then of this general abstract of the Vision is, that the great Contentions among the Nations of the World should produce <HI>Four great Empires</HI> different from one another, and successive, as appears by what immediately follows.</P>
<P><Q>The first was like a Lion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vii. 4.</NOTE> and had Eagles
<PB N="65" REF="002509_0067_0FDB669C93C9EB00"/>Wings: and I beheld till the Wings thereof were pluck't, and it was lifted up from the Earth, and made stand upon the Feet as a Man, and a Mans H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art was given to it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jeremiah</HI> expla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns the <HI>Lions coming out of his Thicket,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. IV. 7.</NOTE> by <HI>The Dest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>being on his way.</HI> And as the Lion was always reckoned the King of Beasts, so it was a natural Figure to represent the first Monarch, whom <HI>Daniel</HI> called a <HI>King of Kings:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. II. 37.</NOTE> The rest of the descrip∣tion is taken from a Passage in a Vision which belongs to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> alone, which is thus expressed,</P>
<P><Q>The same Hour was the thing fulfilled upon <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> and he was driven from Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IV. 33.</NOTE> and did eat Grass as Oxen, and his Body was wet with the Dew of Heaven, till his Hairs were grown like Eagles Feathers and his Nails like Birds Claws.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And at the end of the Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE> I <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar</HI> lift up mine Eyes unto Heaven, &amp; mine Understanding return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d unto me, and I blessed the <HI>Most High,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and Honoured
<PB N="66" REF="002509_0068_0FDB669ED96E3160"/>him that liveth For Ever, whose Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Generation to Generation.</Q></P>
<P>This is an exact Commentary upon the Expressions in the description of the first Beast, and it must not be wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red at, that <HI>Nebuchad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zzar</HI> alone is described, and not his Successors, because in him fell the Glory of that first Monar∣chy, tho' it was not Destroyed till <HI>Belsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzar</HI>'s Time; and we shall find that <HI>Daniel</HI> mentions no more Particulars of the other Beasts, than their first and most bright Transactions, as shall be shown in all the rest, as they come in order, and indeed it would be impossible to do more in so short a Compass as the bounds of a Chapter.</P>
<P><Q>And behold another Beast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII. 5.</NOTE> a second like to a Bear, and it raised up itself, on one side, and it had three Ribs in the Mouth of it, between the Teeth of it, and they said thus unto it, Arise devour much Flesh.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> explains this Figure of a <HI>Bear,</HI> as that of a <HI>Lion,</HI> when he says,</P>
<P><HI>As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. XVIII. 15.</NOTE> <HI>so is a Wicked Ruler over the Poor People.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="002509_0069_0FDB66A31FBB8518"/>
<HI>Its raising it self on out side,</HI> is more fully explained in another Vision of <HI>Daniel,</HI> under a different Figure, where this <HI>Medo-Persian</HI> Empire is more particularly Described and Interpreted.</P>
<P><Q>In the third Year of the Reign of King <HI>Bel∣shazzar,</HI> a Vision appeared unto me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 1.</NOTE> even unto me <HI>Daniel,</HI> after that which appeared unto me at the first.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I saw in a Vision,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> and it came to pass when I saw, that I was at <HI>Shusban,</HI> in the Palace, which is in the Province of <HI>Elam,</HI> and I saw in a Vision, and I was by the River of <HI>Ulai.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Then I lifted up mine Eyes, and saw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> and behold, there stood before the River a Ram which had two Horns, and the two Horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</Q></P>
<P>Which higher is plainly <HI>Persia,</HI> and the same with the <HI>Side</HI> on which the <HI>Bear</HI> raised it self, for in the Interpretation the Angel say's,</P>
<P>"The Ram which thou saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st having two "Horns, are the Kings of <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="002509_0070_0FDB66A41351B1A8"/>
The Figure of the <HI>three Ribs in the Mouth of it,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII. 5.</NOTE> <HI>which said unto it, Arise devour much Flesh,</HI> is explained in the Vision of the third of <HI>Cyrus,</HI></P>
<P>"Also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 1.</NOTE> I in the first Year of <HI>Parius,</HI> the <HI>Mede,</HI> "even I stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</P>
<P><Q>And now will I shew thee the Truth, Behold, there shall stand up yet <HI>Three Kings</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> and the <HI>Fourth</HI> shall be far Richer than they all, and by his Strength, thro' his Riches, he shall stir up all against the Realm of <HI>Grecia.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These <HI>Three Kings</HI> were <HI>Cyrus, Camb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses,</HI> and <HI>Darius Hystespes,</HI> who <HI>stood up</HI> after <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> here called <HI>Darius</HI> the <HI>Mede,</HI> and were great Conquerors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. 5.</NOTE> and are therefore called <HI>Three Ribs,</HI> which probably mean Jaw-Bones with rows of Teeth, as it is said <HI>Crocodiles</HI> have, one within another; and these are very proper to <HI>devour much Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>The reason why the <HI>Fourth</HI> is not reckoned among them, is, because the first three only advanced or aggrandized the Monarchy. But <HI>Xerxes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI 2.</NOTE> <HI>tho' Stronger and Richer than they,</HI> yet by provoking <HI>Greece,</HI> laid a Fountation for
<PB N="69" REF="002509_0071_0FDB66A9AFF1A6B0"/>the Ruin of what the others had Built up; and as, in fact, he was intirely Unsuccessful and Unfortunate in that Attempt, from him may be dated the Decline of the <HI>Persian Monarchy;</HI> and in his Time expired that Remarkable Character of the <HI>Ram,</HI> which had been maintained during their three first Kings, which is thus expressed,</P>
<P><Q>I saw the Ram pushing Westward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 4.</NOTE> and Northward, and Southward, so that no Beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his Hand, but he did according to his Will, and became great.</Q></P>
<P>Now when <HI>Xerxes pushed Westward</HI> he was smartly Repulsed, and forced to give it over after many Losses.</P>
<P><Q>After this, I beheld, and lo, another like a Leopard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. 6.</NOTE> which had upon the back of it Four Wings of a Fowl; the Beast had also Four Heads, and Dominion was given to it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A Leopard</HI> is the swiftest of all the Beasts of Prey, and is by <HI>Jeremiah</HI> applied to a Powerful Prince.</P>
<P><HI>A Leopard shall watch over their Cities.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. V. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="002509_0072_0FDB66AACFF311A0"/>
A Fowl is likewise a Figure of a Destroying Power, which is employed by <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> among others, of the same Force.</P>
<P><Q>And I will appoint over them Four Kinds, saith the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. XV. 3.</NOTE> the Sword to Slay, and the Dogs to Tear, and the Fowls of Heaven, and the Beasts of the Earth, to devour and destroy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I will cause them to be removed into all Kingdoms of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> because of <HI>Ma∣nasseh, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And <HI>Wings</HI> are used, as the Image naturally imports, for the Extensiveness of a Country or Dominion, as it is imployed by <HI>Isaiah,</HI></P>
<P><HI>And gather together the Dispersed of</HI> Judah <HI>from the Four Corners</HI> (the Original is <HI>Wings</HI>) <HI>of the Earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. XI. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>So that what is meant so far, is that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Power should begin with a Rapid Conquest, and then be divided into Four Parts, which should extend towards all the <HI>Corners of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But here follows another Figure, which ought not to be confounded with what goes before.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="002509_0073_0FDB66AC4DE97A48"/>
<HI>The Beast had also Four Heads.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Character of <HI>Heads,</HI> is explained by St. <HI>John</HI> in the Discription of the Fourth Beast.</P>
<P>The S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven Heads, are Seven Mountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XVII. 9.10.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>And there are Sev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Kings, Five are faln, One is, and Another is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t come.</Q> Which should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndred, <HI>And are Seven Kings,</HI> for <HI>[there]</HI> is not in the <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>Now since St. <HI>John</HI> is so exact an Interpreter of <HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el</HI> in the sequel of this Vision, it ought to be allowed, that where-ever <HI>Daniel</HI> is not particular enough to explain his own Terms, St. <HI>John</HI> is always to be admitted to explain them.</P>
<P>And therefore as the <HI>Seven Heads</HI> are generally allowed by the best Interpret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs to mean <HI>Seven Forms of Government,</HI> which the Fourth Beast came under successively, so the <HI>Four Heads</HI> may well be supposed to mean the same thing of the <HI>Third Beast.</HI></P>
<P>But this will seem still more likely, when we consider, how this Vision agrees with the Description of the same Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re under the Figure of a <HI>He-Goat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="002509_0074_0FDB66AFEC394230"/>
<Q>And as I was considering, Behold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 5.</NOTE> an He-Goat came from the West on the Face of the whole Earth, and touched not the Ground, and the Goat had a notable Horn between his Eyes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he came to the Ram that had two Horns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> which I had seen standing before the River, and ran unto him in the Fury of his Power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I saw him come close unto the Ram,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> and he was moved with Chol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r against him, and smote the Ram, and brake his two Horns, and there was no Power in the Ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the Ground and stamp'd upon him, and there was none that could deliver the Ram out of his Hand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Therefore the He-Goat waxed very great, and when he was strong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> the great Horn was broken, and for it came up Four notable Ones toward the Four Winds of Heaven.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And out of one of them came forth a little Horn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="002509_0075_0FDB66B0D8285B50"/>
The Interpretation of all this is added in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me Chapter.</P>
<P><Q>And the Rough Goat is the King of <HI>Grecia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. VIII. 21.</NOTE> and the great Horn that is between his Eyes, is the first King.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now that being broken, whereas Four stood up for it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE> Four Kingdoms shall stand up out of he Nation, but not in his Power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And in the latter time of their Kingdom when the Transgressors are come to the full,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> a King of fierce Countenance, and Under∣standing dark Sentences, shall stand up.</Q></P>
<P>The first part is very plain of <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Followers. But the <HI>latter Time of their Kingdom, when the Transgressors should come to the full,</HI> and this <HI>little Horn</HI> was to <HI>stand up,</HI> who would be a <HI>King of Fierce Countenance, and Understanding dark Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ences,</HI> plainly refers to the <HI>Ten Horns</HI> in the seventh Chapter, who were <HI>Ten Kings that shall arise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 20.24.25.</NOTE> and to the <HI>little Horn which came up, whose Look was more Stout then his Fellows, and should think to change Times and Laws.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="002509_0076_0FDB66B30AF223A8"/>
But there is still another help to Illustrate this whole Matter, in the Vision of the third of <HI>Cyrus;</HI></P>
<P><Q>And a mighty King shall stand up, that shall Rule with great Dominion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 3.</NOTE> and do according to his Will.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And when he shall stand up, his Kingdom shall be Broken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> and shall be Divided towards the Four Winds of Heaven, and not to his Posterity, nor according to his Dominion which he Ruled, for his Kingdom shall be pluckt up, even for others besides those.</Q></P>
<P>Here is a plain account of the Four Heads, or different Forms under which the <HI>Grecian Empire</HI> should come,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Under one <HI>Mighty King that shall stand up;</HI> who is <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 4.</NOTE> <HI>When his Kingdom shall be Broken, and shall be Divided towards the Four Winds of Heaven.</HI></P>

<P>And to Confirm this Interpretation, St. <HI>John</HI> in his Description of the <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st which rises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p out of the Sea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev.

<P>This indeed was an entire Riddle, not possible to be explained, till the Times of <HI>Dioclesion</HI> and <HI>Constantine,</HI> and seems to have contributed more than any thing to <HI>Shut up the Vision,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 26.</NOTE> <HI>for it should

<P><Q>I beheld,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE> and the same <HI>Horn</HI> made War with the Saints, and prevailed against them. The Interpretation of all this follows:</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> The <HI>Fourth Beast</HI> shall be the <HI>Fourth Kingdom</HI> upon Earth, which shall be divers from all Kingdoms, and shall devour the whole Earth, and shall tread it down and break it in Pieces.</Q></P>

This is the <HI>First State</HI> of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> it was <HI>diverse</HI> from the Others, because it had <HI>Seven Heads,</HI> or different forms of Government: Whereas the <HI>First Beast</HI> or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had but <HI>One Head</HI> or form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch.</P>

<P>And now this <HI>Fourth Beast</HI> had <HI>Seven</HI> of these <HI>Heads,</HI> which made it <HI>divers</HI> from all the Others.</P>
<P>This Distinction of <HI>Seven Heads</HI> is not expresly mentioned by <HI>Daniel,</HI> as the Characters of the first <HI>Three Beasts</HI> are, who were either in being, in his Time, or soon after; But this <HI>Fourth Beast</HI> was reserved to be fully explained by St. <HI>John,</HI> who describes it thus,</P>
<P><Q>—And behold a great <HI>Red Tragon</HI> having <HI>Seven Heads</HI> and <HI>Ten Horns,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XII. 3.</NOTE> and <HI>Seven Crowns</HI> upon his Heads.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="002509_0082_0FDB66C3931EC680"/>
The Reason why the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire is here described by a <HI>Dragon,</HI> seems to be, because <HI>Trajan,</HI> the first Emperour, of whom St. <HI>John</HI> Prophesies, and who Reigned very soon after the <HI>Revelations</HI> were written, did after his Con∣quest of the <HI>Dacians,</HI> take their Standerd, which was a <HI>Dragon</HI> and made it a <HI>Roman</HI> Standard.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> here, and in other places, follows <HI>Daniel</HI>'s manner of Description, which represents in the Vision a Figure, as existing at onc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Picture, which in the Explanation appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contain several parts, that are Successive, in order of Time.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>great Image</HI> appears all of one Piece, though the parts of it are found by the Inter∣pretation to have existed one after another.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Four great Beasts</HI> came out of the Sea, and seem to have been seen all at once, tho' in the Explanation they are plainly Successive.</P>
<P>And thus it is of this <HI>great Red Dragon,</HI> whose <HI>Seven Heads</HI> are Successive, and were indeed all in Being before the <HI>Ten</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as St. <HI>John</HI> exprelly says, where he comes to relate what he learn'd from the Angel,</P>

<HI>The latter Time of their Kingdom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII 23.</NOTE> is another Mark of the Time when the <HI>little Horn</HI> in the VIII Chapter begins: Now we have already considered the <HI>latter Time</HI> of the <HI>Grecian Monar∣chy,</HI> and have shewn it to have been, in all probability, when <HI>Constantive</HI> renewed the <HI>Greek Empire.</HI></P>
<P>But we may strengthen that Observation, if we take notice, that this <HI>Little Horn</HI> which is said to subdue <HI>Three Kings</HI> out of the <HI>Ten,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. 24.</NOTE> is in this VIII Chapter described, <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting down some of the Host of Heaven, and of the Stars to the Ground, and stamping upon them.</HI></P>
<P>And St. <HI>John</HI> tells us how many of these Stars were cast down, <HI>(out of Heaven:)</HI></P>
<P><Q>And there appeared another Wonder in Heaven, and behold, a great Red Dragon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XII. 9.</NOTE> having seven Heads and ten Horns, and seven Crowns upon his Heads.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And his Tail drew the third part of the Stars of Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> and did cast them to the Earth.—</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>is a Wonder in Heaven,</HI> Representing
<PB N="90" REF="002509_0092_0FDB66DAD02583B0"/>the fourth Kingdom in this World; which shews, that <HI>Heaven,</HI> in the Vision, means no more than Power and Government, and <HI>Earth,</HI> the Sub∣jects or Common People. And here are the <HI>third part of the Stars cast down to the Earth;</HI> which by so early a Dream as <HI>Josephs,</HI> meant no more than so many Eminent Persons, as it is plain, was a common Figure in his Time, by this Passage.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph</HI> <Q>Dreamed another Dream and told it his Brethren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. XXXVII 9.</NOTE> and said, Behold, I have Dreamed a Dream more, and behold, the Sun and Moon, and the eleven Stars made Obeisance to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he told it to his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> and to his Brethren, and his Father Rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this Dream that thou hast Dreamed? shall I, and thy Mother, and thy Brethren, indeed, come to bow down our Selves to Thee to the Earth.</Q></P>
<P>But it is well known by the Event, that they did <HI>Bow Themselves down to him,</HI> and so the Dream proved a true Prophecy. And thus we see, that the <HI>Stars of Heaven</HI> may mean the same with the <HI>Ten Horns.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="002509_0093_0FDB66DB93F37F88"/>
But it remains to shew, that this <HI>Tail</HI> in St. <HI>John,</HI> means the same with the <HI>little Horn;</HI> and this <HI>Isaiah</HI> helps us to make out, without dif∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ty;</P>
<P><HI>The Ancient and Honourable, he is the Head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">isa. IX. 15.</NOTE> <HI>and the Prophet that Teacheth Lyes he is the Tail.</HI></P>
<P>And we know, that St. <HI>John</HI> calls him <HI>the false Prophet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XIX. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>who wrought Miracles before the Beast.</HI></P>
<P>And we find in another place, that <HI>Isaiah</HI> was no Stranger to the Figure of the <HI>Dragon and the Beast that rises up out of the Sea.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XIII. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong Sword shall punish <HI>Leviathan</HI> the piercing Serpent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah XXVIII. 1.</NOTE> even <HI>Leviathan</HI> that Crooked Serpent, and he shall slay the Dragon that is in the Sea.</Q></P>
<P>But to return to the Description of the <HI>little Horn,</HI> and his subduing <HI>Three Kings,</HI> which are in <HI>Daniel</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> called <HI>Stars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 10. Rev. XII. 3.</NOTE> and a <HI>third part of the Stars of Heaven,</HI> as indeed <HI>Three</HI> is the <HI>third</HI> of <HI>Ten,</HI> as nearly as it can be divided.</P>
<P>It will be proper in this place to shew the
<PB N="92" REF="002509_0094_0FDB66DD5569D790"/>Reason of varying the Figure, under which this <HI>little Horn</HI> is represented, and that will serve to Confirm the Observa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns already made.</P>
<P>In the Vision of the four Monarchies, <HI>He</HI> comes in, in his Order, and as a Power that had small Beginnings in the last Stage of the <HI>Fourth Beast,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan VII 20.24</NOTE> as a <HI>little Horn after</HI> or <HI>behind</HI> the rest of the <HI>Horns:</HI> A <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> who was not very considerable at first, but that grew by Degrees to have <HI>Eyes like a Man, and a Mouth speaking great Things,</HI> till his <HI>Look was more stout than his Fellows.</HI></P>
<P>In St. <HI>Johns</HI> XII Chapter, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere the History of the old <HI>Heathen Empire,</HI> its Persecution of the <HI>Christians,</HI> and its Destruction by <HI>Constantine</HI> are the Subject, This <HI>little Horn</HI> is represented as the last thing that would arise out of the Remains of this <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pro∣perly expressed by the Figure of a <HI>Tail.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev.

<P>In the XIII Chapter, where the rise of the new <HI>Western Empire</HI> is described, and the Wound it received by the Abolition of its <HI>Empe∣rors,</HI> and the setting up the <HI>Ten Kings</HI> in their
<PB N="93" REF="002509_0095_0FDB66DE8A0DAF48"/>Room, by which the <HI>Wound was Healed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XIII. 3.</NOTE> that is, the Disorders of the <HI>Empire</HI> Abated, This <HI>little Horn</HI> is represented, not in his first State of <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> only, who was not very great while the <HI>Emperors</HI> lasted, but when the <HI>Ten Horns</HI> had at last succeeded in their Room, then this <HI>little Horn</HI> shewed himself in his advanced State, as described by <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 8.</NOTE> <HI>of a Mouth speaking great Things,</HI> and accordingly St <HI>John</HI> says of the <HI>Beast that was Wounded and Healed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XIII. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>And there was given unto him a Mouth speaking great Things and Blasphemies.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the same sense that <HI>Aaron</HI> was given to <HI>Moses, instead of a Mouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. IV. 16.</NOTE> where the <HI>Mouth</HI> is a different Person from him to whom <HI>it was given.</HI></P>
<P>And in the same Chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> that this Power may be more particularly described, his original is traced meerly as it relates to himself.</P>
<P><Q>And I beheld another Beast rising up out of the Earth, and he had two Horns like a Lamb,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XIII. 11.</NOTE> and he spake like a Dragon.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="002509_0096_0FDB66E402AA28D0"/>
This Power was to be distinguished by its being a Succession of Persons, taken out of the <HI>Earth,</HI> which signifies, the <HI>Common People,</HI> as in fact, the <HI>Popes</HI> have always been; They are not like other Princes, of Noble Families, but are Elected out of a number of Cardinals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings, vii 31.</NOTE> who rise often to that Dignity from little <HI>Priests,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. xi. 15.</NOTE> taken from among <HI>the lowest of the People.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Two Horns like a Lamb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiii II.</NOTE> express empha∣tically his Pretension to be the Representative, or, as he calls himself, the Vicar of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who was the <HI>Lamb Slam;</HI> and the <HI>Two Horns,</HI> shew whence the Figure is first derived, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>the Lamb</HI> of the Passover, which was to be <HI>without Blemish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xii. 5. Levit. I. 10.</NOTE> <HI>and a Male;</HI> and this was always the Rule of the Burnt Offerings, it was to be <HI>a Male without Blemish;</HI> for, <HI>the Males were the Lords.</HI></P>
<P>The speaking <HI>like a Dragon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiii 11.</NOTE> signifies, that notwithstanding his Pretences to be the Vicar of Christ, he really would take upon him to Com∣mand with the Power and Cruelty of a Heathen Persecuting Roman Emperor, who is described
<PB N="95" REF="002509_0097_0FDB66E55571F5B0"/>by a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragon standing before the Woman ready to be delivered, to devour her Child.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>And that <HI>Woman</HI> is Christs Church.</P>
<P>The last Character given of the <HI>See of Rome,</HI> is not of the Person of the Popes, or their Suc∣cessors, but of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xvii. 3.4.5.15.</NOTE> under the Figure of a <HI>Woman,</HI> who is called <HI>Babylon, who sitteth on many Waters, who are People and Nations,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>who Reigns over the Kings of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>According to this Image it will follow, that the Succession of Popes will be expressed by <HI>Bel,</HI> which was the Image of the old King <HI>Belus,</HI> worshipped in <HI>Babylon;</HI> and of this <HI>Jeremiah</HI> Prophesies,</P>
<P><Q>And I will Punish <HI>Bel</HI> in <HI>Babylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jor. II. 44.</NOTE> and I will bring forth out of his Mouth that which he hath swallowed up, and the Nations shall not flow together any more unto him, yea, the Wall of <HI>Babylon</HI> shall Fall.</Q></P>
<P>And what <HI>Bel</HI> or <HI>Belus</HI> had been in the most ancient Time, <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was afterwards, and therefore is called the <HI>Head of Gold</HI> of the <HI>Terrible Image;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. ii. 33.</NOTE> and for that reason in this New
<PB N="96" REF="002509_0098_0FDB64EA4CF6CD48"/><HI>Babylon</HI> the Head of that Church is naturally expressed by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> or the King of <HI>Babylon:</HI> And in this sense the same Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> says, just before,</P>
<P><Q>Thus saith the Lord the God of <HI>Israel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer II. 33.</NOTE> the Daughter of <HI>Babylon</HI> is like a Threshing-Floor, it is time to thresh her, yet a little while, and the time of her Harvest shall come.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE> the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> hath Devoured me, he hath Crushed me, he hath made me an empty Vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a Dragon, he hath silled his Belly with my Delicates, he hath cast me out.</Q></P>
<P>It is very plain, how well this description agrees with the time when Christ shall<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Math. iii 12.</NOTE> <HI>throughly purge his Floor,</HI> and when <HI>the</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">xiii. 30.40.</NOTE> <HI>Time of the Harvest,</HI> and <HI>of Gathering the Tares to be Burnt in the Fire,</HI> is come; and when<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Rev. xiv. 15.</NOTE> <HI>The harvest of the Earth is Ripe;</HI> and this, <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> who swallowed<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Jer. LI. 34.</NOTE> <HI>like a Dra∣gon,</HI> agrees very well with the <HI>two Horned Beast,</HI> who<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Rev. xiii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>spake like a Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>And it is very easy to see, that the Prophet
<PB N="97" REF="002509_0099_0FDB64EDF2941EC0"/><HI>Jeremiah</HI> did not here mean Old <HI>Babylon,</HI> but the same New <HI>Babylon</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> since</P>
<P><Q>In those Days, and at that Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 20.</NOTE> saith the Lord, the Iniquity of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and the Sins of <HI>Judah,</HI> and they shall not be found, for I will Pardon them whom I will Reserve.</Q></P>
<P>How can this be said with any Propriety of the old <HI>Jews,</HI> who after their Return from their first Captivity in Old <HI>Babylon,</HI> Rejected the Messiah, and were again destroyed and dispersed for their Sins? Nor is their second Dispersion over to this Day; so that the destruction of <HI>Babylon,</HI> meant here by <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> can be no other than the Destruction of the same <HI>Babylon,</HI> which St. <HI>John</HI> Prophecies of, and which is yet to be expected.</P>
<P>I have now explained the first Characters of the <HI>little Horn,</HI> in the VII of <HI>Daniel,</HI> that he should <HI>rise after the Ten Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 24.</NOTE> <HI>and be divers from the first Ten, and should subdue three Kings:</HI> And shewn what other Passages may serve to Illustrate and Confirm these first Characters.</P>

<P>I Go on now to the other parts of <HI>his</HI> Descrip∣tion, which serve to six the Time of <HI>his</HI> Beginning.</P>
<P><Q>And <HI>he</HI> shall speak great Words against the Most High,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VII. 25.</NOTE> and shall wear out the Saints of the Most High, and think to change Times and Laws, and they shall be given into <HI>his</HI> Hand, untill a Time, Times and the Dividing of Time.</Q></P>
<P>The Continuation of the Description which I have not yet mentioned in the next Chapter, where <HI>Gabriel</HI> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>prets, is to the same effect;</P>
<P><Q>And his Power shall be mighty, but not by his own Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. 24.</NOTE> and he shall destroy Wonder∣fully, and shall prosper and practise, and shall destroy the Mighty and the Holy People.</Q></P>

<P>And to this agrees the short Expression in the XII Chapter, which I have made my Prin∣cipal Business to explain in this Essay,</P>
<P>—<Q>It shall be for a Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. XII. 7.</NOTE> Times and an Half, and when he shall have accomplished to seatter the Power of the Holy People, all these things shall be finished.</Q></P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> speaks in the same strain <Q>and there was given unto him,</Q> (that is, to the Beast risen out of the Sea,,)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XIII. 5.</NOTE> <Q>a Mouth speaking great Things, and Blasphemy's, and Power was given unto him, to continue Forty and Two Months.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he opened his Mouth in Blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to Overcome them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> and Power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations.</Q></P>

<P>And afterwards, where the same Power is represented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iii 11.</NOTE> <HI>as coming out of the Lorth with two Horns like a Lamb, but speaking as a Dragon.</HI> It is thus continued,</P>

<P><Q>And he doth great Wonders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> so that he maketh Fire come down from Heaven, on the Earth, in the sight of Men.</Q></P>

<P><Q>And he had Power to give Life unto the Image of the Beast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> that the Image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that, as

<P>All these Passages compared with one another, give so full and plain an Account of the <HI>Popes of Rome,</HI> from first to last, that a very moderate Knowledge of History serves to satisfie us, that they are meant of them, and cannot be applyed to any other.</P>

<P>But among other Characters, the Division of the Period into <HI>Time, Times</HI> and <HI>a Half,</HI> carries in it a strong Proof, that the whole is perfectly well adapted to the <HI>Bishops of Rome,</HI> under these three States, 1st, their <HI>Rise,</HI> 2dly, their <HI>Greatness,</HI> and 3dly, their <HI>Decline.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Western Roman Empire,</HI> fell with <HI>Valen∣tinian</HI> III. in the Year 455, upon whose Death <HI>Genserick</HI> came and killed <HI>Maximus</HI> the Usurper, and sacked <HI>Rome.</HI> This <HI>Valentinian</HI> III. had a little before, in 445 given Orders to <HI>Aetius</HI> his General in <HI>France,</HI> in which he says,</P>

<P>And <HI>Marcian</HI> the Emperor of the East, did,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Car Sigon.</HI> p. 314.</NOTE> in 450. write to the same Pope <HI>Leo I.</HI> in these terms, <Q>We write to your Holiness, who holds the first place among the Bishops of the Divine Faith, that by your Orders a Council may settle the Peace of the Church.</Q> And in another Letter he proposes, <Q>That a Council may declare what is profitable for the Christian Faith by their Act, as your Holiness shall constitute, according to the Rules of the Church.</Q></P>
<P>So that the Popes had then that Power acknow∣ledged to belong to them, by the Emperors both of the East and West, which they have exercised, more or less, ever since; and therefore it seems more re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sonable to date the Rise of the <HI>Papacy,</HI>

There was no probability that <HI>Daniel</HI> should <HI>Understand</HI> a Description that belonged to the <HI>Romans,</HI> a Nation then not known in <HI>Asia,</HI> and to the last Scene of their Power, which was not to begin, till almost a Thousand Years after the Time of this Prophecy.</P>

<P>By this answer of the Angels, <HI>Daniel</HI> was Commanded to rest satisfied without Enquiring more particularly about the meaning of what he had <HI>heard,</HI> because the Accompl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shment, that alone, was able to explain it fully, would not be till that Time should come which is called, <HI>the Time of the End,</HI> and that therefore according to the Nature of Prophecy, as explained by St. <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet I 20.</NOTE> <HI>That it was not its own Interpreter,</HI> he was to be contented to let it remain <HI>Closed up and Sealed</HI> till it should be explained by degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>This <HI>Time of Trouble, so that none is like it,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="002509_0115_0FDB13C7686AC570"/>must be the same with what in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> is called,</P>
<P>—<Q><HI>Great Tribulation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth, x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv. 21.</NOTE> such as was not since the Beginning of the World to this Time, No, nor never shall be.</Q></P>

<P>And if we would know what are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>Times of the Gentiles,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> informs us, when he says,</P>

<P>Thus we find, that this <HI>Time of the End,</HI> and <HI>Time of Trouble,</HI> upon a due Tracing of it, in∣cludes the whole Period of the <HI>Forty two Months,</HI> which means the same Thing with the <HI>Time, Times and a Half,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>And what follows, gives the Reason of this way of speaking, and shews what was this <HI>Time of the End.</HI> For when <Q>The Seventh Angel shall begin to Sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> the Mystery of God shall be Finished, as he hath declared by his Servants the Prophets.</Q></P>
<P>And accordingly, when <HI>the Seventh Angel Sounded,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 15.</NOTE> it is said, <HI>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>By which, compared with the whole Thread of this Chapter, We may perceive, that the

<P>And thus we may observe, that This <HI>Mystery of God,</HI> as it was Contemporary with, so it was Opposite to that <HI>Mystery of Iniquity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess.

<P>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is a kind of Paraphrase upon that short general Character, given in the 11 <HI>h</HI> Verse of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> XII.

<P>With this Description of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s agrees what
<PB N="119" REF="002509_0121_0FDB651F8C9E0E88"/>we find in the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> when he describes "the Covering cast over all People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. xxv. 7.</NOTE> and the "Vail that is spread over all Nations.</P>
<P><Q>But God will destroy it, and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> wipe away Tears from all Faces, and the Rebuke of his People shall he take away from all the Earth.</Q></P>

<P>Here are the <HI>Wise</HI> and the <HI>Wicked,</HI> and those that <HI>cleave to the</HI> Wise <HI>with Ilatteries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>But the most exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Commentary upon <HI>Daniel,</HI> as on all other occasions, so on this 10th Verse of the XII Chapter of that Prophet, is in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Revelations,</HI> where he sees</P>
<P><Q>Another Angel ascending from the East, having the Seal of the Living God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. vii. 2.</NOTE> and he cryed with a loud Voice to the four Angels, to whom it was given to hurt the Earth, and the Sea,</Q></P>
<P><Q>Saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> Hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, till we have Sealed the Servants of our God in their Foreheads.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="002509_0123_0FDB6524175A4968"/>
<Q>And I heard the Number of them which were Sealed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. vii. 4.</NOTE> and there were Sealed an Hundred and Forty and Four Thousand of all the Tribes of the Children of <HI>Israel.</HI></Q> And here it might be proved, if the compass of this Treatise would permit it, that these One Hundred and Forty and Four Thousand are the same with the <HI>Two Witnesses in Sackcloth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>So far there were but few that <HI>Understood,</HI> who are likewise mentioned in <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> when <HI>the Lord said</HI> unto the Man with the <HI>writers Ink-horn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. IX. 4.</NOTE> <Q>Go through the midst of the City, through the midst of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and set a Mark upon the Fore-heads of the Men that Sigh, and that Cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And to the others he said, in mine hearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> Go ye after him through the City, and smite, let not your Eyes spare, neither have ye Pity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Slay utterly Old and Young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> both Maids and little Children and Women, but come not near any man upon whom is the mark, and
<PB N="122" REF="002509_0124_0FDB65258C51A7F0"/>begin at my Sanctary; then they began at the Ancient M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n which were before the House.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he said unto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. IX. 7.</NOTE> Defile the House, and till the Courts with the Slain; Go ye forth, and they went forth and Slew in the City.</Q> Where <HI>Ezckiel</HI> calls that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>the City</HI> which St. <HI>John</HI> calls <HI>the Earth and the Sea,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>viz.</HI> the Christian Roman Empire.</P>
<P>But afterwards St. <HI>John</HI> gives an account of a great Addition to this small Number, by which means there were in all <HI>many</HI> that <HI>Understood,</HI> and were <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</HI></P>
<P><Q>After this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. vii 9.</NOTE> I beheld, and lo, a great Multi∣tude, which no Man could Number of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, Cloathed with White Robes, and Palms in their Hands.</Q></P>
<P>There follows a Doxology, or Thanksgiving from them, and then the Angel informs St <HI>John,</HI></P>
<P><Q>These are they which came out of great Tribulation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> and have Washed their Robes and made them White in the Blood of the Lamb.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="002509_0125_0FDB6528F72C7360"/>
<Q>Therefore are they before the Throne of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. VII 15.</NOTE> and serve him Day and Night in his Temple; and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They shall Hunger no more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> neither Thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE> shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living Fountains of Water, and God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</Q></P>
<P>Here is a plain Description of the <HI>Reforma∣tion,</HI> when <HI>great Multitudes washed their Robes,</HI> by Purifying their Worship, and <HI>came out of great Tribulation,</HI> by escaping the further Persecution of the <HI>Church of Rome.</HI> Thus were the <HI>One Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty days of Tribu∣lation</HI> shortned for the <HI>Elects sake,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth▪ xxiv. 22. Amos viii. 11.12.13. Isa. xlix. 8.9 10.19.25.</NOTE> who after that, did not <HI>Hunger or Thirst after the Words of the Lord,</HI> nor were the <HI>Heat</HI> or <HI>Sun</HI> to <HI>smite them</HI> after the <HI>Prisoners</HI> were to <HI>inherit the desolate Heritages,</HI> or the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> and the <HI>Captives of the Mighty, and the Prey of the Terrible delivered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="002509_0126_0FDB652AD8145268"/>
But it will be still more evident, that the <HI>Reformation</HI> is here intended, if we observe, That <HI>all Kindreds,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiii 7.</NOTE> <HI>and Tongues, and Nations,</HI> were at first under him <HI>that opened his Mouth in Blasphemy against God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> and that likewise, <HI>All that dwelt upon the Earth W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rshipped him;</HI> as likewise, that the <HI>Woman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> called, <HI>Mystery Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xvii. 1 5.15.18.</NOTE> <HI>did sit on many Waters;</HI> which Waters were <HI>People, and Nations, and Multitudes, and Tongues:</HI> And that this <HI>Woman</HI> was that <HI>great City that Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gneth ever the Kings of the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI></P>
<P>So that once, all the <HI>Common People,</HI> as well as the <HI>Great Kings</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> that Ruled the People Cruelly and Tyrannically, were altogether Subject to the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> and her <HI>Popes.</HI> But where the <HI>Slaughter of the Witnesses</HI> is de∣scribed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">XI</NOTE> (who were those who still continued in <HI>Tribulation,</HI> bearing Testimony to the Truth, under Persecution in <HI>Popish</HI> Countries) There we find two Parties described, who are very differently disposed to them.</P>
<P><Q>They of the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9</NOTE> and Kindreds, and
<PB N="125" REF="002509_0127_0FDB652C6ACAFC90"/>Tongues, and Nations, shall see their Dead Bodies three Days and a half, and shall not suffer their Dead Bodies to be put into Graves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And they who dwell upon the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XI. 10.</NOTE> shall Rejoyce over them, and make Merry, and shall send Gifts one to another, because these two Prophets Tormented them that dwelt on the Earth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And after three Days and an half, the Spirit of Life from God entered into them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11</NOTE> and they stood upon their Feet, and great Fear fell on them which saw them.</Q> By this last Verse, compar'd with <HI>Ezekiel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. xx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vii. 1 to 11.</NOTE> it was plainly a friendly Office to keep these Dead Bodies out of Graves, in order to their Resurrection: And here it is plain, that <HI>they of the People and Kindreds,</HI> &amp;c. that is, some <HI>of the People,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 9.

<P>I Now go on to the express Words which six the second Period.</P>
<P><Q>And from the time that the <HI>daily</HI> Sacrifice shall be taken away,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>This Verse Determines the whole Period of the <HI>Daily</HI>'s being taken away, (for <HI>Sacrifice</HI> is no where in the Original) and of the <HI>Abomina∣tions</HI> Continuing, from the Time that the <HI>Daily</HI> was Removed, and the <HI>Abomination</HI> set up.</P>
<P>There is another Passage in <HI>Daniel,</HI> which relates to this <HI>Daily,</HI> in his Vision of the third of <HI>Belshazzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. VIII. 9.10.</NOTE> where he is describing the <HI>little Horn which waxed exceeding great, even to the Host of Heaven, and cast down some of the Host, and of the Stars to the Ground, and stamped upon them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="002509_0130_0FDB65354BBD95B0"/>
He goes on to give the most distinguishing Character of this <HI>Little Horn.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. viii 11.</NOTE> he magnified himself, even to the Prince of the Host, and by him the <HI>Daily</HI> was taken away, and the place of his <HI>Sanctuary</HI> was cast down.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And an Host was given him against the <HI>Daily,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> by Reason of <HI>Transgression,</HI> and it cast down the Truth to the Ground, and it prac∣tised and prospered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then I heard one Saint speaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE> and another Saint said unto that certain Saint which spake, —How long shall be the Vision concerning the <HI>Daily,</HI> and the <HI>Transgression</HI> of <HI>Desolation,</HI> to give both the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> and the <HI>Host</HI> to be trodden under Foot?</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he said unto me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> Unto <HI>Two Thousand and Three Hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays,</HI> then shall the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> be cleans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</Q></P>
<P>In clearing up these two Passages of the last Chapter of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the VIII. which both mention this taking away the <HI>Daily,</HI> and setting up the <HI>Transgression,</HI> or <HI>Abomination</HI> of <HI>Desolation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="002509_0131_0FDB65360D219280"/>
<HI>First,</HI> It is observable, (as I have already shewn) That the two Persons speaking, as well as the Subject of their Discourse, are the same in both Visions, <HI>viz. Michael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. X. 5.</NOTE> or the <HI>Man Cloa∣thed in Linnen with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lden Girdle,</HI> and <HI>Gabriel,</HI> or <HI>the Man sent to make</HI> Daniel <HI>understand the Vision.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. 16.</NOTE> Wherefore I shall not now Repeat what has been so fully treated of in the beginning of this Treat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se; and this is a strong Argument that these two Passages are on the very same Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As the <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen with a Golden G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le,</HI> has been shewn to be Our Saviour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. IX. 10.</NOTE> who is the <HI>High-Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> in his <HI>own Tabernacle:</HI> It will be very Natural and Consistent, to suppose the <HI>Daily</HI> no other than what belonged to his <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> and not that which was peculiar to the old <HI>Tabernacle</HI> and <HI>Temple</HI> of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xxi. 38.</NOTE> This <HI>Daily</HI> cannot be the <HI>Lamb offered Day by Day continually,</HI> because that was not offered <HI>in the Sanctuary,</HI> but on the <HI>Brazen Altar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XXVIII. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> which was <HI>without the Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>It can therefore only mean the <HI>Daily in the Sanctuary, on the Altar to burn Incense,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xxx. 1, 3.</NOTE> <HI>overlaid
<PB N="130" REF="002509_0132_0FDB6537906474F8"/>with pure Gold,</HI> Which <HI>Moses</HI> was commanded,</P>
<P><Q>—Thou shalt put it before the Vail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod XXX. 6.</NOTE> that is by the Ark of the Testimony, before the Mercy Seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with thee.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And <HI>Aaron</HI> shall burn thereon sweet Incense every Morning;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> when he dresseth the Lamps, he shall burn Incense upon it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And when <HI>Aaron</HI> lighteth the Lamps at Even,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> he shall burn Incense upon it, a perpetual Incense before the Lord throughout your Generations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ye shall offer no strange Incense thereon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor burnt Sacrifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE> nor Meat Offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> neither shall ye pour Drink-Offering thereon.</Q></P>
<P>This was then as much a <HI>Daily,</HI> as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Daily Oblation or Sacrifice on the Brazen Altar; which was to be <HI>a continual Burnt Offering thro'-out their Generations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XXIX. 42.</NOTE> and the former agrees with <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Expression, whereas the latter does not.</P>
<P>This likewise agrees with <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s Expression, when <HI>the</HI> Man <HI>with the writers Ink-horn, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="131" REF="002509_0133_0FDB653CE8E66DB0"/>to set a Mark on them that Sighed,</HI> his order is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. IX. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Come not near any Man upon whom is the Mark, and begin at my Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Chapter <HI>Ezekiel</HI> gives a Descrip∣tion that is like to<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Dan. VII 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>Daniel</HI>'s and<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Rev. IV. 1.

The X Chapter begins thus,</P>
<P><Q>Then I looked, and behold in the Firmament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. X. 1.</NOTE> that was above the Head of the Cherubims, there appeared over them, as it were, a Saphire-Stone, as the Appearance of the like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss of a Throne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And he (that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> the Ancient of Days) spake unto the <HI>Man Cloathed in Linnen,</HI> and said, Go in between the Wheels, even under the Cherub, and fill thine hand with Coals of Fire from between the Cherubims, and scatter them over the City—</Q></P>
<P>Now this agrees exactly with St. <HI>John</HI>'s Description,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. VII 3, 4</NOTE> after <HI>the Servants of God were Sealed in their Fore-heads,</HI> during which sealing

<P><Q>And another Angel came and stood at the Altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> having a Golden Censer, and there was given unto him much Incense, that he should offer it with the Prayers of all Saints, upon the Golden Altar, which was before the Throne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the Smoke of the Incense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out of the Angels Hand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the Angel took the Censer and filled it with Fire of the Altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> and cast it into the Earth, and there were Voices, and Thundrings, and Lightnings, and an Earth-quake.</Q></P>
<P>Here is a plain taking away the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ily</HI> Offering of the Incense from the Golden Altar, and scat∣tering the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e on the <HI>Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> that is, among the Common People, which <HI>Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kiel</HI> calls the <HI>City;</HI> and so the Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of the visible Worship of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> being taken away, There was no true <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Church</HI> left, but among the

<P>Thus I have, I think, sufficiently shewn what was the meaning in <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. ii. 11,</NOTE> of <HI>taking away th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Daily.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now proceed to Explain, what is the <HI>Abomination of Desolation,</HI> or <HI>Transgression of Desolation,</HI> meant in the XII. and VIII. Chapters of <HI>Daniel;</HI> and here we have the Assistance of the Interpretation given in the XI. Chapter, in which mention is made of <HI>Polluting</HI> the <HI>Sanctuary of Strength,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">XI. 31.</NOTE> where the Golden Altar of Incense stood, and not the Brazen Altar for burnt Offer∣ings, as I have already observed; and where it is said, <Q>They shall take away the <HI>daily,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE> and place the <HI>Abomination</HI> that maketh Desolate; And such as do <HI>Wickedly</HI> shall <HI>He</HI> Corrupt by <HI>Flatteries.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Who this <HI>He</HI> is, is described in a few Verses after,</P>

<PB N="141" REF="002509_0143_0FDB6552A0C878A8"/>and Contrary to all the concurring Descriptions by which it plainly did not belong to the Inter∣ruption of <HI>Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Offerings</HI> on the <HI>Brazen Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar,</HI> which expired with the <HI>Jewish Temple</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and with <HI>Christ</HI>'s Death, <HI>who offered Himself Once for All,</HI> in the Spiritual Sense among the <HI>Christians.</HI> But it belonged to a <HI>Spi∣ritual Service,</HI> on <HI>the Golden Altar</HI> with the <HI>Prayers of the Saints,</HI> where Christ is <HI>High Prist,</HI> and which <HI>Sanctuary</HI> is his Church, which the <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ests</HI> have Polluted, by setting up <HI>a Man</HI> to be <HI>Worshipped,</HI> and to be a Vicar of God, with Power to Dispense even with Gods Laws.</P>
<P>But the rest of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Description in the XI. Chapter is too material to be omitted in Confirmation of all this.</P>
<P><Q>Neither shall he regard the <HI>God of his Fathers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. XI. 37,</NOTE> nor the desire of <HI>Women,</HI> (that is Marriage) nor regard any God, for he shall Magnifie him∣self <HI>above All.</HI></Q></P>

<P>It is very Obvious how well this agrees with the Description of the XIII. and XVII. of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> already cited, in what goes before.</P>
<P>I will only add a few other places where St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> allude plainly to the same Thing, and which indeed need no Commentary. St. <HI>Paul</HI> says to the <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssalonians,</HI></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Mystery of Iniquity</HI> doth already work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. II. 7.</NOTE> only he who now Letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way;</Q></P>

<P><PB N="143" REF="002509_0145_0FDB65588CBD8538"/>

<P><Q>And for this cause God shall send them <HI>strong Delnsion,</HI> that they should believe a Lye.</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE></P>
<P>And again, St. <HI>Paul</HI> warns <HI>Timothy,</HI></P>
<P><Q>Now the Spirit speaketh expresly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. IV. 1.</NOTE> that in the <HI>Latter Times</HI> some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed to Seducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils, (or <HI>Daemons</HI>)</Q></P>

<P>And then he adds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE> <Q>But they shall proceed no further, for their <HI>Folly</HI> shall be made manifest unto all Men.</Q></P>
<P>Of the same St. <HI>Peter</HI> says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet.

<P><Q>And many shall follow their <HI>Pernicious Ways,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> by means of whom the VVay of Truth shall be evil spoken of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And thro' <HI>Covetousness</HI> shall they with feigned Words make <HI>Merchandize of you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> whose Judg∣ment now of a long time ling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reth not, and

<P>And afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet II. 14.</NOTE> <Q>Having Eyes full of <HI>Adul∣tery,</HI> and that cannot cease from sin, Beguiling Unstable Souls; an heart they have exercised with <HI>Covetous Practices,</HI> Cursed Children.</Q></P>
<P>And he closes thus,</P>
<P><Q>For when they speak <HI>great Swelling Words</HI> of <HI>Vanity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> they allure through the <HI>Lusts of the Flesh,</HI> thro' much <HI>Wantonness,</HI> those that were clean escaped from them who live in <HI>Error.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>While they promise them <HI>Liberty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> they themselves are the <HI>Servants</HI> of <HI>Corruption;</HI> for of whom a Man is Overcome, of the same is he brought in Bondage:</Q></P>
<P><Q>For if after they have <HI>Escaped the Pollutions of the World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE> thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again <HI>Entangled</HI> therein and <HI>Overcome,</HI> the latter End is worse with them than the beginning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For it had been better for them <HI>Not to have known the Way of Righteousness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE> than after they have known it, to turn from the <HI>Holy Command∣ment</HI> delivered unto them.</Q></P>
<P>There is little Occasion to shew how well all
<PB N="146" REF="002509_0148_0FDC1BDC6FEA28B8"/>these Passages of Scripture agree with one another, and with <HI>Daniel</HI>'s and St. <HI>John</HI>'s Descriptions of <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now to Determine What is meant by this Period in the XII. Chapter of <HI>Daniel,</HI> more particularly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 11.</NOTE> <Q>From the Time that the <HI>Daily</HI> shall be taken away, and the <HI>Abomination that maketh Desolate</HI> set up, there shall be <HI>One Thousand Two Hundred and Ninety Days.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It has been shown, That <HI>He</HI> that <HI>With-holdeth</HI> was <HI>Taken out of the way,</HI> when the <HI>Western Empire</HI> ended with <HI>Valentinian</HI> the III. in 4.55. from whence counting 1290 years, it will reach to 1745.</P>
<P>Now let us Examine the Period in the VIII. Chapter, in answer to the Question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. 13.</NOTE> <Q><HI>How long shall be the Vision concerning the</HI> Daily, <HI>and the</HI> Transgression <HI>of</HI> Desolation, <HI>to give both the Sanctuary and Host to be troden under Foot?</HI></Q></P>

<HI>Moses</HI> speaks in the same Stile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen.

<P>Now reckoning from the third of <HI>Belshazzar</HI> when <HI>Daniel</HI> had this Vision, the whole Period of Two Thousand and Three Hundred Pro∣phetical <HI>Days,</HI> which were <HI>Years,</HI> we shall find they began, by the common Account, 553 years before Christ.

<P>And since I have had occasion to mention the <HI>Babylonish Captivity</HI> of 70 Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IV X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>V.</NOTE> I must observe that the beginning of it was not a Total <HI>Cap∣tivity,</HI> but for the first 18 Years <HI>Jerusalem</HI> st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Subsisted with her own Government, tho' many were lead away <HI>Captives</HI> from her.

<PB N="149" REF="002509_0151_0FDB6563D7818460"/>strongest Evidence for fixing the <HI>Time of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>inning</HI> of all the <HI>Three,</HI> I must not omit the Opinion St. <HI>Jerome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> That Beginning,</HI> when he saw in the fifth Century, the <HI>Barbarous Nations</HI> invading the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> whom he reckons up to the Number of <HI>Ten,</HI> and when he saw <HI>Gaul</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> already Conquered, and <Q><HI>Rome</HI> it self the Scene of War, Strugling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.

<P>And thus have I endeavoured to explain the <HI>Second Period,</HI> contained in these Words of <HI>Daniel,</HI></P>
<P><Q>And from the time that the <HI>Daily</HI> shall be taken away,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. XII 11.</NOTE> and the <HI>Abomination</HI> that <HI>maketh Desolate,</HI> set up, there shall be a Thousand Two Hundred and Ninety Days.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. XI.</HI> Of the Third Period.</HEAD>
<P>I Will now proceed to explain the Third and last Period of <HI>One Thousand Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Thirty Five</HI> Days, and then shew that these three distinct Periods are not only distinguished in this XII. Chapter of <HI>Daniel,</HI> but likewise in the VII. and very particularly in the History, as
<PB N="151" REF="002509_0153_0FDB65692E66A598"/>it is contained in the <HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI> ends his Prophecy with this comfortable Warning from the Lord,</P>
<P><Q>Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to <HI>The Thousand Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Thirty Five</HI> Days;</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>But go thou thy Way till the end be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE> for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy Lot at the <HI>End</HI> of the Days.</Q></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e is a Blessed Time Prophesied of at the very <HI>End.</HI> We have already observed, that <HI>Time of the End</HI> to be the <HI>One Thousand Two Hundred</HI> and <HI>Sixty</HI> Years, but then when that Time is out, the <HI>End</HI> takes first <HI>Thirty</HI> Years <HI>to set up the Daily</HI> again, and <HI>take away the Abomination that maketh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esolate,</HI> and now <HI>Forty Five</HI> Years more, before all is quite finished. It is natural that the <HI>End</HI> shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thus consist of several Years, since most of the great Transactions of the World ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> done the same.</P>
<P>The <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wish Captivity</HI> ended in the first of <HI>Cyrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezra. I. 1.</NOTE> but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Laboured under such Dfficulties that they could not Rebuild the Temple till the
<PB N="152" REF="002509_0154_0FDB656AA592BA88"/>VI year of <HI>Darins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exra VI. 15. Nehem. II. 1. V. 14. VI. 15. XII. 27. XIII. 6.</NOTE> nor was the Wall of their City finished, (which alone secured them from the Insults of their Neighbours) till the XX of <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> at the soonest, or as seems most probable, till the XXXII Year of that Kings Reign.</P>
<P>The Overturning the <HI>Heathen Roman Empire</HI> by <HI>Constantine,</HI> is the Period whence we reckon its End, and yet it had a Revival, in <HI>Julian,</HI> several years after, which lasted till, on <HI>Julian</HI>'s Death, it finally Perished.</P>
<P>The <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Popes</HI> in <HI>England</HI> was taken away by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. and thence we reckon its Fall, tho' it had a dangerous Revival in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, but was quite Extirpated upon her Death.</P>
<P>And in <HI>Germany,</HI> when the <HI>Reformation</HI> first began, and the <HI>Smalkaldick</HI> League was at its height, we reckon the <HI>Papal Power</HI> received its Decisive Stroke among those Princes and Cities who imbraced the <HI>Reformation;</HI> tho' afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> the V. had Imprisoned some, Deprived others, and well nigh Extinguished the Party, till
<PB N="153" REF="002509_0155_0FDB656C0D3EF5F0"/>Affairs took a new Turn, by the Policy of <HI>Manrice</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony;</HI> and then the <HI>Reformation</HI> was firmly Established by the Treaty of <HI>Passan.</HI></P>
<P>Just so We are to consider the Fate of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> that it has received its Stunning Blow, when it lost that <HI>Most Christian King,</HI> as they might well call <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. whose chief Ambition was to Extirpate <HI>Heresie,</HI> in which Attempt he ventured his Kingdom, at the Per∣swasion of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who <HI>flattered</HI> him with a better Crown in <HI>Heaven,</HI> for his Service done to the <HI>Church on Earth.</HI></P>
<P>We are yet to expect the Fall of the <HI>Court of Rome,</HI> by its being totally Deserted and Neg∣lected by the Princes who still depend on it. And when that is over, the Orders of <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Fryers,</HI> and particularly the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> are very likely to take several years more before they are wholly stript and rooted out of the Kingdoms and Countries, where they now enjoy so large Possessions, and have so much Sway with the Ignorant People, and then every thing that is to be done, during the <HI>End,</HI> will be prepared
<PB N="154" REF="002509_0156_0FDB656F4CE5F0E0"/>for the Period when,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan xii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty Five Days:</HI> which agrees perfectly with St. <HI>John</HI>'s Declaration,</P>
<P><Q>Blessed and Holy is he that hath Part in the first Resurrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev xx. 6.</NOTE> on such the second Death hath no Power, but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ, and shall Reign with him a Thousand Years.</Q></P>
<P>As the next Verse of <HI>Daniel,</HI> does with the rest of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Description of the same Reign of a Thousand Years.</P>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI> ends thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii. 13.</NOTE> <Q>But go thou thy way till the <HI>End</HI> be, for thou shalt rest; and stand in thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot at the <HI>End of the Days.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And St. <HI>John</HI> says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xx. 4.</NOTE> <Q>And I saw Thrones, and they sate upon them, and Judgment was given unto them, and I saw the Souls of them that were Beheaded for the Witness of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and for the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and which had <HI>not Worshipped</HI> the <HI>Beast,</HI> neither his <HI>Image,</HI> neither had received his <HI>Mark</HI> upon their <HI>Fore-heads,</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="002509_0157_0FDB6570A4A4D430"/>or in their <HI>Hands;</HI> and they Lived and Reigned with Christ a <HI>Thousand Years.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>But the rest of the Dead Lived not again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xx. 5.</NOTE> until the <HI>Thousand Years</HI> were finished, this is the <HI>first Resurrection.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the <HI>Lot</HI> that <HI>Daniel</HI> is promised to stand in, at the <HI>End of the Days.</HI></P>
<P>And this is agreable to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Description, to the <HI>Thessalonians.</HI></P>
<P><Q>But I would not have you to be Ignorant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes. IV. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Brethren, concerning them which are a Sleep, that ye Sorrow not, even as others which have no Hope</Q> (that is, no <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> which intitles them to the Promise of a <HI>Resur∣rection;</HI>) He goes on,</P>
<P><Q>For if we believe that <HI>Jesus</HI> dyed and rose again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> even so them also which Sleep in <HI>Jesus</HI> will God bring with him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this we say unto you by the Word of the Lord, that we which are alive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not pre∣vent them which are asleep;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="002509_0158_0FDC1BDA22447218"/>
<Q>For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Thess. IV. 16.</NOTE> with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God, and the Dead in Christ shall rise first.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Trump of God</HI> is the same with <HI>The Voice of the Seventh Angel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. x. 7.</NOTE> which, <Q>when he shall begin to sound, the Mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his Servants the Prophets.</Q></P>
<P>And when <Q>the Seventh Angel Sounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. XI. 15.</NOTE> there were great Voices in Heaven, saying, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdons of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the Four and Twenty Elders which sate before God on their Seats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> fell upon their Faces and Worshipped God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Saying, We give thee Thanks, O Lord God Almighty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE> which art, and wast, and art to come, because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great Power, and hast Reigned.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the Nations were Angry, and Thy Wrath is come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> and the Time of the Dead,
<PB N="157" REF="002509_0159_0FDC1BD3EA52F9E8"/>that they should be Judged, and that Thou shouldst give Reward unto thy Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and them that fear Thy Name, small and great, and shouldst Destroy them which Destroy the Earth.</Q></P>
<P>Here is an abstract of many of Gods past Judgments, and a View of what was yet to come, and there the <HI>Prophets</HI> are mentioned as the first that are to be <HI>Rewarded,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xx. 4.</NOTE> and then the <HI>Saints,</HI> and last of all, the <HI>Small and Great,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> who <HI>do not stand before God</HI> till the <HI>Thousand Years are expired;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> and then all that have <HI>Destroyed the Earth,</HI> first the <HI>Beast and False Prophets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> then <HI>Satan,</HI> and last <HI>Death and Hell</HI> will be destroyed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> expresses it to the same effect, when he says.</P>
<P>"For as in <HI>Adam</HI> all dye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. XV. 22.</NOTE> even so in Christ "shall all be made alive.</P>
<P>"But every Man in his own Order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> Christ "the first Fruits, afterwards they that are Christs at his coming.</P>
<P><Q>Then cometh the <HI>End,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE> when he shall have delivered up the Kighdom to God, even the
<PB N="158" REF="002509_0160_0FDB6573F27ED588"/>Father, when he shall have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power.</Q></P>
<P>"For he must Reign till he hath put all "Enemies under his Feet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. XXV. 25</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>The last Enemy that shall be Destroyed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> Death.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we see in the order of Events, that the <HI>Prophets</HI> are part of those that are <HI>to be Rewarded first,</HI> and <HI>are Christs at his Coming;</HI> and surely <HI>Daniel</HI> among them, at the end of the 1335 Days, which if they begin with the Year 455 will end in the Year 1790.</P>

<P><PB N="159" REF="002509_0161_0FDB6575D22C4C48"/>
The <HI>First Period</HI> is described in the XII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan xii. 7.</NOTE> Chap∣ter of <HI>Daniel,</HI> by <HI>Scattering the Holy People for a Time, Times and a Half,</HI> in the VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. 25.</NOTE> of <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Vision of the <HI>Four Beasts,</HI> by <HI>thinking to Change Times and Laws,</HI> which <HI>shall be given into his Hand, for a Time,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 2.

<P>The <HI>Second Period</HI> is described to last <HI>from the taking away the Daily Sacrifice, and setting up the Abomination that maketh Desolate One Thousand Two Hundred and Ninety Days,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. 26.</NOTE> in the XII. of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and in the VII. that Period is describ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by <HI>The Judgment sitting to take away his Dominion.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiv. 7.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Which is exactly agreeable to St. <HI>John</HI>'s De∣nunciation, <HI>That the Hour of Gods Judgment is come.</HI> Just before the Angel says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">XVI. 18.19.</NOTE> <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n is fallen, is fallen,</HI> which <HI>Babylon</HI> was only said to

<P>And again, when <HI>Babylon</HI> is described as <HI>Fallen,</HI> in another Chapter, it is said,</P>
<P><HI>Alas! alas! that great City,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xviii. 10.</NOTE> Babylon, <HI>that mighty City! for in one H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r is thy Judgment come.</HI> Which suits exactly <HI>Daniel</HI>'s d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scription, in the VII.

<P><Q>And I looked, and behold, a White Cloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> and upon the Cloud sate one like unto the Son of Man, having on his Head a Golden Crown, and in his Hand a sharp Sickle,</Q></P>

<P><Q>And another Angel came out from the Altar, which had Power over Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> and cryed with a loud Cry to him that had the sharp Sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp Sickle, and gather the Clusters of the Vine of the Earth, for her Grapes are fully Ripe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the Angel thrust in his Sickle into the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> and gathered the Vine of the Earth, and cast it into the great Wine-press of the Wrath of God.</Q></P>

<PB N="166" REF="002509_0168_0FDC1BDF2CFB6180"/><HI>Thousand Years</HI> should be fullfilled, and after that he must be loosed a little Season.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I saw Thrones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev xx. 4.</NOTE> and they sate upon them, and Judgment was given unto them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here St. <HI>John</HI> brings it to the <HI>Thousand Years,</HI> of which he says, <HI>Blessed and Holy is he that hath part in the first Resurrection.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> Which I observed before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 12.</NOTE> agreed with <HI>Daniel's, Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the One Thousand Three Hundred Thirty Five Days,</HI> in the XII. and to the <HI>Kingdom of the Saints,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. 26.27.</NOTE> in the VII.

<P>And thus I have gone through the <HI>Three Periods,</HI> and given my Reasons Why the <HI>First</HI> may be reckoned to have expired in the Year 1715. The <HI>Second</HI> to be expected to expire in 1745, and the <HI>Last</HI> in 1790.</P>
<P>And that this may not seem Presumptuous, tho' in General it is not safe to Guess at what is yet to come, We may remember that our Saviour allows and commands us, in St. <HI>Luke, When these things begin to come to pass,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke XXI. 28.</NOTE> <HI>then look
<PB N="167" REF="002509_0169_0FDC1BE1944A7D10" MS="y"/>up, and lift up your Heads, for your Redemption draweth nigh.</HI> If therefore I have made it Probable, that the <HI>First Period</HI> is <HI>come to pass,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xxi. 31. Matth. xxiv. 33. Mark XIII. 29.</NOTE> we may be justly intituled to Hope that the Rest which end in <HI>The Kingdom of God,</HI> are <HI>nigh at Hand, even at the Doors.</HI></P>
