<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT was discovered soon after the peace, that the Confedera∣tion, in its present form, was wholly inadequate to the end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f its creation; that of making America one State, for great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ational purposes. As soon as peace took place, confusion in very department of Congress, ruin of public and private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>redit, decay of trade, and loss of importance abroad, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he immediate consequences of the radical defects in the Confe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eration. During the war, the fear of a powerful enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswered all the purposes of the most energetic government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as soon as that fear was removed, the thirteen United <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tates began to draw different ways. Some refused to ratify <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he treaty of peace; others neglected to pay their respective <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uotas to the public Treasury; and others absolutely rejected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most salutary propositions of Congress; propositions to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich the greater number of States readily assented. In vain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave Congress called upon the different States to pay up their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uotas in order to support the falling credit of America: In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain have they pointed out to them the necessity of establishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir public faith as a nation, by complying with their treaties: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n vain have they recommended to them to forego their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmediate interests, and consider the interests of the Union. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongress might advise, or recommend measures: might ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove the conduct of some States, and condemn that of others; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ht preach up public faith, honour, and justice: But was
<PB N="4" REF="021264_0003_0FB2B7DD2EEEC928"/>
this sufficient to preserve a union of thirteen States, or sup∣port a national government? It had no authority, its powers expired at the peace, became a dead letter, for the fear of common danger was gone. Peace, which to other nations pro∣duces, and which under other circumstances would have pro∣duced to us, the greatest blessings, was pregnant with the greatest evil; disunion, the certain parent of internal quarrels, disorder, and blood-shed. In this situation of America, some of the best and wisest of her citizens, lamenting that the term of her glory was so short, and dreading the fatal consequences which would necessarily follow from disunion, proposed that a Convention of the States should be called for the purposes of amending the Confederation. The wisdom of the measure was instantly seen: It was approved by Congress, recommended to, and adopted by the States.</P>
<P>IT is on all hands agreed, that an abler or more upright Assembly never met in America, than the late Convention held at Philadelphia. The original design of their meeting was to amend the present Articles of Confederation: But upon con∣sulting together; upon accurately investigating the Confedera∣tion, and informing each other of the real situation of their respective States, they saw so many radical defects in the one, and so many alarming appearances in the other, as induced them readily and unanimously to modify the Federal Consti∣tution: And after four months spent in painful inquiries, and diligent labour, produced the frame of government now offered to the consideration of the citizens of America. A form of government, which the President of the Convention, with the modesty peculiar to him, acknowledges to be in some respects defective; but which he likewise tells us, <Q>was the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered in dispensible.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021264_0004_0FB2B7DF0951BE00"/>WHEN we take a view of the respectable names who met upon this occasion, and composed this plan of government, we ought to approach it with deference and respect. Though not in such a manner as to deprive us of the power of discovering its faults; yet with such liberality as will lead us to consider it as the result of the deliberations of good and able men, actu∣ated by just motives, and governed by pure principles. Men not swayed by selfish prospects, but urged to action by general philanthropy, and the desire of handing to posterity the best form of Federal Government, that America is capable of re∣ceiving, or perhaps that was ever offered to the consideration of mankind.</P>
<P>IF we read the proposed plan under these ideas, and think we discover imperfections, and faults; ought we not rather to distrust our own perceptions, than the understandings of its makers? Because it is much more probable, that a single reader, even of great capacity, should be mistaken, than that so respectable a body as the Convention, with minds equally enlightened, and more unbiased, should, after the freest and fullest investigation of this important subject, be wrong.</P>
<P>I confess I am not one of those who would adopt without consideration, or blindly pursue a plan produced by any body of men, however eminent their characters for wisdom and virtue. "Not to pin my faith upon the sleeve of any man," was one of my earliest lessons. However, I am persuaded that the work before us, requires no blind followers: but standing upon the basis of its intrinsic merit, possesses strength sufficient to withstand the shocks of its most powerful enemies. Often have I read this work; and sometimes discovered, as I thought, important defects; yet upon doubting my own judgment, and reading it again, have generally found the fault in myself, not in the Constitution. Yet I will not pretend to say that it is per∣fect. Did perfection ever come from the hands of man? If
<PB N="6" REF="021264_0005_0FB2B7E04DD601E8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were perfect, it would be illy suited to our imperfect capaci∣ties. Government in itself is not a positive good; but some∣thing introduced by societies to prevent positive evil. The best frame of government is that which is most likely to pre∣vent the greatest sum of evil. Such I apprehend is the go∣vernment now under consideration. Had the design of the Convention been to frame a Constitution for any individual State, they might perhaps have produced one, in the abstract, still nearer perfection. But far different was the purpose of their meeting! and I feel myself happy in concurring with that august body in thinking, that it is the best government which could be obtained for the thirteen States of America. Under this impression I shall attempt to explain those parts of it which are, or have been supposed to be difficult; and to answer some of the principal objections which have been made to it.</P>
<P>BEFORE we enter into a discussion of the different articles which compose the Constitution, it may not be improper to take into consideration the question respecting a Bill of Rights; which many, from habit and prejudices, rather than from reason, and truth, have thought necessary; and upon the want of it have founded one of their principal objections.</P>
<P>FEW people know the origin of the term; still fewer have considered, without prejudice, the necessity of the thing. What is a Bill of Rights? A declaration insisted on by a free people, and recognized by their rulers, that certain principles shall be the invariable rules of their administration; because the preservation of these principles are necessary for the preser∣vation of liberty. If this distinction be just; can there be a difference, whether these principles are established in a separate declaration, or are interwoven and made a part of the Con∣stitution itself? Is an infringement of a Bill of Rights by the Governing powers, of more serious consequence, than an in∣fringement
<PB N="7" REF="021264_0006_0FB2B7E36BD69860"/>
of the frame of government? The question carries the answer along with it. That there is no distinction between them is a truth, an attempt to prove which would be an offence against common sense.</P>
<P>OF all the European governments a Bill of Rights is known I believe, to that of England alone. The cause of this is obvious. The liberty of that country has been procured and established by gradual encroachments upon the regal powers seized by, if not yielded to, the first Prince of the Norman fa∣mily. The first declaration of this sort found in the history of that government, is the Charter of Hen. the 1st, obtained in consequence of that Monarch's feeble title to the Throne. The frequent infractions of that Charter by Henry himself, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as by subsequent Monarchs, produced the famous Magna Charta of John, which is generally considered as the founda∣tion of English freedom. But in those ages of darkness, when scarcely a rule of descent was fixed, much less principles in politics established, Charters, or Declarations of Rights, were soon lost sight of, whenever interest induced, and circum∣stances offered opportunities to the English Princes, to infringe them.</P>
<P>These violations gave rise to the Charter of Hen. 3d, which was of much more importance than any of the preceding; and the discontents and confusions which led to it, in the end gave birth to the House of Commons. From this period some ideas of liberty began to prevail in the nation, but which for a long course of years were obscured by turbulent Barons, long and destructive civil wars, and the arbitrary government of an able line of Princes. The art of printing, the reformation, and the restoration of letters, at length enlightened the minds of men: Just ideas of liberty now prevailed, and the Commons saw, that if the powers exercised by the Tudors were to continue
<PB N="8" REF="021264_0007_0FB2B7E5B8D6FEB0"/>
in their new Sovereigns, all hope of liberty was at an end. Their restless spirit frequently shewed itself during the reign of Elizabeth; but that prudent Princess had the address to allay their fears, and the vigour to repress their spirit. A new and foreign race of Princes now ascend the Throne. The oppor∣tunity was not to be lost: Political positions were laid down in, and established by the House of Commons, which were considered by many as extraordinary, as they were true.</P>
<P>JAMES, without the tallents, affected to reign with as high an hand as the Tudors. Charles unfortunately for himself, had been educated in the prejudices of his father. His ill-advised and arbitrary measures, involved him in difficulties which pro∣duced the Petition of Right in 1628. In this was set forth the unalienable rights of English-men. New infractions produced new quarrels; which terminated in a total change of govern∣ment. At the restoration all was joy and festivity. The tide of royalty ran too high, to think of Bills of Rights, or privi∣leges of English-men. The conduct of James the 2d, the last King of that ill-fated family, involved the nation in fresh dis∣contents: The Prince of Orange is called to its assistance: The King quits the Kingdom: The Throne is declared va∣cant; and William afcended it upon terms stipulated in a Bill of Rights. It may be asked, why did the English consider a Bill of Rights necessary for the security of their liberty? The answer is, because they had no written Constitution, or form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the English Constitution is no more than an assemblage of certain powers in certain persons, sancti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied by usage and defined by the authority of the Sovereignty; not by the people in any compact entered into between them and their rulers.</P>
<P>If at the revolution the English had fully marked out the go∣vernment under which they chose in future to live, without
<PB N="9" REF="021264_0008_0FB2B7E841AC96C0"/>
contenting themselves with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stablishing certain principles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bill of Rights, can there be a doubt, but that such frame of government would have supplied the place of, and rendered unnecessary, a Bill of Rights?</P>
<P>FORMER Princes had pretended to a divine right of govern¦ing: William acknowledged his to flow from the people, and previously to his ascending the Throne, entered into a con∣tract with them, which recognized that just and salutary prin∣ciple. Had the English at this time limited the regal power in definite terms, instead of satisfying themselves with a Bill of Rights, there would have been an end of prerogative: but they from habit were contented with a Bill of Rights, leaving the prerogative still inaccurately defined, to claim by implifi∣cation, the exercise of all the powers not denied it by tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declaration.</P>
<P>WHEN the United Netherlands threw off their dependence on the Crown of Spain and passed their act of Union, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought not of any Bill of Rights; because they well knew tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the States General could have no right nor pretext to pass th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bounds prescribed by that celebrated act: So in the instanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before us, Congress have no right, and can have no pretext to pass the bounds prescribed them by this Federal Constitution and the powers conceded to the Federal Government by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respective States, under this government, are as accurately defined, as they possibly could have been in a Declaration o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rights.</P>
<P>WHEN Independence was declared by the Americans, the had no government to controul them: Were free to chus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the form most agreeable to themselves. Six of these State have no Bill of Rights; wisely judging, that such declaration rend to abridge, rather than preserve their liberties. The
<PB N="10" REF="021264_0009_0FB2B7E9F8A71CE0"/>
considered their Constitutions as the evidence of the social compact between the governors and the governed, and the only proof of the rights yielded to the former. In all disputes respecting the exercise of power, the Constitution or frame of government decides. If the right is given up by the Consti∣tution, the governors exercise it; if not, the people retain it. Each of the remaining seven States has a Declaration of Rights, adopted rather from habit arising from the use in the English government, than from its being necessary to the preservation of their liberties.</P>

<P>Section 1. <HI>All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Senate and House of Representatives.</HI></P>
<P>IT is necessary to observe that, Congress consists only of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Senate, and House of Representatives. The President make no part of it; for his negative only amounts to a reconsidera¦tion of the public measures; as notwithstanding his disappro¦bation, a bill becomes a law, if two thirds of each House agre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it.</P>
<P>Sect. 2. <HI>The House of Representatives shall be composed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> members chosen every second year by the people of the sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> States, and the electors in each State shall have the qualification requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Legislature.</HI></P>
<P>It will be asked by some,—Why should the Representative to Congress be elected for two years, when in Virginia and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other States, the State Delegates are annually chosen? I answer to this question a variety of reasons occur; such as tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they will have a great distance to go: That the purposes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Legislation being purely federal, it will take them som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time to become acquainted with the situation and interests <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the respective States, as well as the relative situation and in¦terest of the whole Union: That it would be difficult to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men of abilities to serve in an office, the re-election to whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be so frequent. If the election had been once in thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> years, it would perhaps have been an improvement. The u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦stable councils, the feeble laws, the relaxation of governme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which afflict this, and almost every State in the Union, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> justly be attributed to the frequent changes which take pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> among the rulers in all the American governments.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="021264_0011_0FB2B7F09CB21D78"/><HI>Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among a several States which may be included within this Union, ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing to their respective numbers, which shall be determined, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adding to the whole number of free persons, including those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>xed, three-fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall be made within three years after the first meeting of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongress of the United States, and within every subsequent term <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.

<P>EVERY free person counts one, every five slaves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount three. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y this regulation our consequence in the Union is increased, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an increase of numbers in the Congress. But some objectors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue that this arrangement is unjust; and that it bears hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the southern States, who have been accustomed to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der their slaves merely as property; as a subject for, not as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents to taxation; and therefore by adding three fifths of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves to the free persons, our numbers are increased; and con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quently by how much is that increase, by so much is the in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ase of our federal burthen. It is true, that slaves are pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rty,—but are they not persons too? Does not their labour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>oduce wealth? And is it not by the produce of labour, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taxes must be paid? The Convention justly considered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the light of persons, rather than property: But at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time conceiving their natural forces inferior to those of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whites: knowing that they require freemen to overlook
<PB N="13" REF="021264_0012_0FB2B7F201ED0EA8"/>
them, and that they enfeeble the State which possesses them, they equitably considered five slaves only of equal consequence with three free persons. What rule of federal taxation so equal, and at the same time so little unfavourable to the south∣ern States, could the Convention have established, as that of num∣bers so arranged? Suppose the value of the lands in the respective States had been adopted as the measure: Let us see what then would have been the consequence. The northern States are comparatively small to the southern, and are very populous; whilst to the southward, the inhabitants are scattered over a great extent of territory. Any given number of men in the latter States possess much greater quantities of land, than the like number in the former. It is true the lands to the north∣ward sell for a greater price than those to the southward, but the difference in price is by no means adequate to the difference in quantity; consequently an equal number of men to the southward would have to pay a much greater federal tax than the like number to the northward.</P>
<P>BY the 8th article of Confederation, the value of lands is made the measure of the federal quotas. Virginia in conse∣quence is rated something above Massachusetts, whose num∣ber of white inhabitants is nearly double.</P>
<P>AFTER all, this point is perhaps of no great consequence The Congress probably will rarely, if ever, meddle with direct taxation, as the impost duties will in all likelihood answer al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the purposes of government, or at any rate the post-office which is daily increasing, and a tax upon instruments of writ¦ing, will supply any deficiency.</P>
<P>INDIANS are mentioned in this clause because there are na¦tions of Indians within the limits of several of the States.</P>

<P>THE inequality of the representation of the Senate, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en made a great ground of objection.</P>

It will not be denied that the small, have an equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght to preserve their independence with the large States; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d this was their only means of preserving it.

equal to the large, even to Virginia; and it certainly was a great point gained by the large ones, to get their consequence increased in the House of Representatives in proportion to their numbers. In the United Provinces each of the seven States has but one vote in their Congress, and in that Confede∣ration the disproportion between the States is much greater, than in ours; for the Province of Holland pays rather more than one half of the whole federal quota. Yet so great are the evils which would arise from a disunion, that this wealthy Pro∣vince readily submits to so unequal a representation.</P>
<P><HI>Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be, into three classes. The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacat∣ed at the expiration of the second year; of the second class, at the expiration of the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expiration of the sixth year; so that one third may be chosen every second year: And if vacancies happen by resignation, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> otherwise, during the recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such va¦cancies.</HI></P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the Senators are to be chosen by the Legislatures of the respective States, who surely are compe∣tent judges of those who are most capable of filling this impor∣tant office: Notwithstanding one third of them are re-chosen every two years: Yet the enemies to the Constitution affect to call this an aristocratic body: And endeavour to excite visionary fears in the minds of men, that they will form a dis∣tinct order in the State, and become formidable to the libert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

of America. I am not gifted with the spirit of prophecy, and there∣fore cannot say what will happen; but this I will boldly assert, that if power cannot be trusted in the hands of men so ap∣pointed, it can be trusted no where. The different States will be well acquainted with the characters of those whom they elect to the Senate; their time of duration when elected is too short to enable them to form dangerous intrigues, or bring about important revolutions. It is a well established principle in rhetorick, that it is not fair to argue against a thing, from the abuse of it. Would you say there should be no Physicians be∣cause there are unskilful administers of medicine: No Law∣yers because some are dishonest: No Courts because Judges are sometimes ignorant; nor government because power may be abused? In short, it is impossible to guard entirely against the abuse of power. Annual elections will not do it. The Delegates of Virginia are annually elected, yet it is a fact, that there has not been an Assembly since the government was framed, wherein the Bill of Rights and the Constitution have not been infringed. The instances have been of no great im∣portance and therefore notwithstanding the danger of the prin∣ciple, they have been overlooked.</P>
<P><HI>The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a Presi∣dent</HI> pro tempore, <HI>in the absence of the Vice-President, or when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e shall exercise the office of President of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>THE Vice-President has been introduced from the State Government of New York. This useful, though surely inoffensive officer, has been made by some objectors the bugbear of the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>titution. It is a strong proof of want of argument in the ene∣mies to it, when they hold up this officer as dangerous. He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lected by the same persons as the President, and in the same
<PB N="17" REF="021264_0016_0FB2B7FCCD052528"/>
manner. He presides in the Senate, but has no vote except when they are divided. This is the only power incident to his office whilst he continues Vice-President; and he is obviously introduced into the government to prevent the ill-consequen∣ces which might otherwise happen from the death or removal of the President. This is the purpose for which a similar offi∣cer has been introduced into the Constitution of New-York.</P>
<P><HI>The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirma∣tion.

<P><HI>Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit, under the United States but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.</HI></P>
<P>I CONCEIVE that the Senators are not impeachable, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore Governor Randolph's objection falls to the ground I am surprized that a man of that gentleman's abilities shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have fallen into this mistake. The Senators having a powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over their own members, have the right of expulsion. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then should they be impeachable? For upon impeachment the punishment is only removal from, and incapacity to hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offices. Expulsion amounts to the same thing. Besides, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Senators are elected by the people, though mediately, as we as the House of Representatives, and therefore have not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same degree of responsibility annexed to their characters, the officers of government; and for this obvious reason,—t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> former are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pointed by the people themselves to stand their places, and they are the best judges of those who are mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fit to serve them; but the latter are appointed by the servan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="18" REF="021264_0017_0FB2B7FE761E56F0"/>
of the people. It is a generally received maxim among writers on government, that the Judiciary and Legislative de∣partments should be kept distinct. The position is true to a certain extent; but this like most other general rules, is liable to exceptions. In the English government, which is certainly the freest in Europe, the House of Lords not only try impeach∣ments, but is the highest civil court in the kingdom. In that Constitution the House of Commons are the impeachers, the House of Lords the triers: But no members either of the House of Commons or House of Lords, was ever impeached as such: But whenever members of either House have been impeached, it was as great officers of State. Under the fede∣ral government this is impossible, because the members of nei∣ther House can hold any office of State.</P>
<P>IF this reasoning be not conclusive, the fourth section of the second article puts it out of doubt, viz. "The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment, &amp;c." The Senators are representatives of the people; and by no construction can be considered as civil officers of the State. If this be the case, in whose hands can this power be lodged with greater propriety, or with greater safety, than in those of the Senate? Or how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an a better court be appointed? To impeach either the mem∣bers of Senate or House of Representatives, would be to im∣peach the representatives of the people, that is the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves, which is an absurdity.</P>
<P>Sect. 4. <HI>The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laces of chusing Senators.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="021264_0018_0FB2B7FF8507DB68"/><HI>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. 5. <HI>Each House shall be the judge of the elections, re∣turns, and qualifications, of its own members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each House may provide.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behaviour, and with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgement require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question, shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neither House, during the cession of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</HI></P>
<P>EXPERIENCE and a change of circumstances may render it necessary that the Congress should have the power of regulat∣ing the elections: But as the Senate is elected by the State Legislatures, the place of such election must be the place where they meet. Besides which, this power was necessary lest some of the States from obstinacy, or selfish views, should alter the time and place of holding the elections in such a manner, as might impede the operation of the federal government.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="021264_0019_0FB2B801016E5D10"/>Sect. 6. <HI>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the United States. They shall in all cases, except treason, felony and breach of the peace, be privi∣leged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the autho∣rity of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office.</HI></P>
<P>SAY the objectors,—Why are not the salaries of the members of Congress ascertained by the Constitution? I will answer them by another question,—Why are not the salaries of every officer of the United States ascetained by it? Or rather, why should the Convention have descended into such minutia? Can it be supposed, for a moment, that in the present situation of America, when there are still left many men of talents and virtue, from amongst whom the Congress will doubtless be chosen, that they will pass a law to give themselves immoderate sallaries? But even should they, what would be the mighty evil to this extensive continent, from eighty or ninety persons having salaries larger than perhaps their services might merit?</P>
<P>IT is proper that Congress should have the regulation of this matter for another reason. It is a fact well known in the commercial world, that, from one certain cause, the quantity of specie is insensibly increasing: This of consequence lessens its value: Therefore a salary which now would be sufficient forty years hence, would be wholly inadequate.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="021264_0020_0FB2B802CA3799C0"/>IN the latter part of this section there is an admirable check upon the members of both Houses; as nothing can tend in a greater degree, to prescribe their independence of conduct, and prevent intriguing, than that no member shall be eligible to any office which has been created, or whose emoluments have been increased, since the time of his election, and during the time for which he has been elected.</P>
<P>Sect. 7. <HI>All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.</HI></P>
<P>IN this the Constitution is an improvement upon that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England: There all money bills must not only originate bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be perfected in the House of Commons: Here though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Senate cannot originate such bills, yet they have the powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of amending them, and by that means have an opportunity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> communicating their ideas to the House of Representatives upon the important subject of taxation.</P>
<P><HI>Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representa¦tives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall fig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, but if not, he shall return it with his objections, to that Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the the objection at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it.

<P>THIS power in the President is derived from the State go∣vernment of Massachusetts and New-York, though in the lat∣ter the Chancellor and Chief Judges are added to the Gover∣nor. This power goes only to a reconsideration of the public measures; and the President's disapprobation, or negative, is nugatory, when two-thirds of each House concur in any mea∣sure after it has undergone his inspection. The Convention wisely judged that the President would in all probability be a man of great experience, and abilities, and as far as his powers extend, ought to be considered as representing the Union; and consequently would be well acquainted with the interests of the whole. Great utility is therefore likely to arise to Con∣gress from his knowledge, and his reasoning upon their acts of Legislation. Farther, the experience of all ages prove that all popular assemblies are frequently governed by prejudices, passions, and partial views of the subject; nay sometimes by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndecent heats and animosities. The ten days therefore given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the President for his opinion of their measures, is wisely in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erposed to prevent the mischiefs which might ensue from those common faults of such assemblies.</P>
<P><HI>Every order, resolution or vote, to which the concurrence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> approved by him, or, being disapproved by him, shall be re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cording to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of bill.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="021264_0022_0FB2B8094699FCB8"/>THE reasoning upon the last clause applies also to this.</P>
<P>Sect. 8. <HI>The Congress shall have power</HI></P>
<P><HI>To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States;</HI></P>
<P>IT is here to be observed, that all taxes, imposts, &amp;c. are to be applied only for the common defence and general wel∣fare, of the United States. By no possibility will the words admit of any other construction. Yet several popular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See in particular the address and reasons, &amp;c. of the Penn∣sylvania Minority.</NOTE> de∣claimers have attempted to sound the alarm by their illeberal and ill-founded suggestions of peculation, bribery, and cor∣ruption, and of the probability of the public Treasury being converted to the use of the President and Congress. But how will this be possible? They will have all fixed salaries, and perquisites. The public accounts of receipts and expenditures will be regularly kept and regularly published, for the public inspection: Besides which, the public offices will always be open for the search and inquiries of every individual. I doubt if human wisdom could devise any better mode of securing a just application of the public money.</P>
<P>AS scarcely any article of the proposed plan has escaped censure, there are objections made to the grant of the imposts to Congress. But when we consider that the purposes for which the imposts are to be applied are merely national, and falls di∣rectly within the design of the Union, that of making all Ame∣rica one State for great political purposes, the objection falls; for in this view America composes but one great republic, all the subjects of which stand precisely upon the same ground,
<PB N="24" REF="021264_0023_0FB2B80ACD2C0E18"/>
and pay only in proportion to their consumption of foreign articles. To this we may add, that those States which export the chief of the produce of their labour, and in consequenec of that circumstance, import more than those which manufac∣ture, receive a compensation for the increased import, by the exported produce being free from duties. And besides, we may fairly conclude, that the consumption of foreign articles throughout America, is nearly in proportion to the enumeration, which is the measure of the respective quotas.</P>
<P><HI>To borrow money on the credit of the United States;</HI></P>
<P>THIS power is lodged with the present Congress.</P>
<P><HI>To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes;</HI></P>
<P>THE power of regulating commerce gives great alarm to the enemies of the Constitution. In this, as in most other instan∣ces, they forget that this is a government for thirteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and think only of the immediate interests of Virginia; as if she had a right to dictate to the other twelve, and as if her interests alone were to be consulted. Be not deceived my countrymen. However important we may be in the scale of Union, there are other States which are equally so. The consequence of this power, say they, will be, that the eastern and northern States will combine together, and not only oblige the south∣ern to export their produce in their bottoms, by prohibiting foreign bottoms; but will also lay such duties upon foreign manufactures as will amount to a prohibition, in order to sup∣ply us themselves.</P>
<P>UPON accurately investigating this point, we shall find the reasoning to be as false, as the supposition is illiberal. It is true the eastern States can build and equip ships, upon better
<PB N="25" REF="021264_0024_0FB2B80C4DC85200"/>
terms than the southern: Nay, I believe I may go farther, and say, that they can upon better terms than any nation in Europe. This arises from their having all the materials for ship-building within themselves, except canvas and cordage, whilst most of the maritime powers of Europe, depend upon foreign countries, not only for these articles, but also for tim∣ber and masts. A great extent of sea coast, a cold climate, a barren soil, and above all, the fisheries, furnish an infinite num∣ber of seamen, who from necessity are willing to navigate for very moderate wages. If this be the case, is their any reason to suppose that the eastern States will not carry our produce upon as reasonable terms as any of the European powers? I believe it is a fact, that before the war, they were the principal carriers to the British West-Indies; so low were the terms upon which their vessels could be chartered. And the same causes still ex∣ists, why they should take freight upon terms equally moderate. But this is not all. The eastern States are not ignorant that the southern possess even better materials for ship-building, than they do; and therefore will take care not to excite their jealousy, nor stimulate them to build ships and become their own carries, by exacting unreasonable freightage. But ad∣mitting that the eastern Delegates should be so dishonest as well as unwise, to combine against those of the south—I will venture to assert, that not a man in America, who is acquaint∣ed with the middle States, can suppose that they would join in such a combination. New-York is rather a country of far∣mers than of sailors: It possesses large tracts of fertile soil, but no fisheries, and before the war, for one ship built in that State, either for freightage or sale, there were thirty in New-En∣gland. All that she will aim at, therefore, will be ships of her own, sufficient to carry her own produce. Her interests, there∣fore will not induce her to enter into this formidable combi∣nation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021264_0025_0FB2B80E0B979720"/>JERSEY, from her local situation, and a variety of peculiar circumstances, has fewer ships and seamen than even any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he southern States. Her interests, therefore, will lead her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o adhere to them.</P>
<P>THE same reasoning applies to Pennsylvania that does to New-York; and still more emphatically; because this State is still more employed in husbandry. And as to the State of De∣laware, it does not own six ships.</P>
<P>LET us then see how this question will stand in point of numbers. The four eastern States will have seventeen voices, which will be opposed by the nineteen voices of the middle States and the twenty-nine of the southern.</P>
<P>I WILL not endeavour to answer the other objection.—The fear of a northern combination to furnish the southern States with manufactures. This I conceive, has arisen either from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnorance of the subject, or an absolute enmity to all confe∣deration. The only manufactures which the northern States possess and with which they can furnish others, are shoes, cot∣ton cards, nails, hats, carriages, and perhaps paper and refined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugars may be added; and should the whale-fishery be ever revived, train oil and spermacaeti candels. The two first ar∣ticles may be in a great measure confined to Massachusetts. Their shoes are as good and as cheap as those imported from Great-Britain, at least as the sale shoes. And as to the second article, the exportation of them from thence is prohibited by act of Parliament. Both New-York and Pennsylvania manu∣facture leather in all its branches, and hats; but not more than sufficient for their own consumption. Connecticut has no manufactures to export; nor has New-York, unless perhaps some refined sugar. Jersey has only domestic manufactures. Pennsylvania manufactures nails, refined sugar, cotton cards, carriages, and, of late, paper for exportation. The Dela∣ware State has only domestic manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="021264_0026_0FB2B8126A744D28"/>IF Massachusetts can furnish us with shoes, cards, train oil and spermacaeti candles; Pennsylvania with nails, white sugar carriages, and paper, as cheap as we can procure them from beyond the Atlantic, why should not such European article be probibited? There is no probability that either the nor¦thern or southern States, will in many years become extensive manufacturers. The price of labour and cheapness of land will prevent it; and the daily migrations from all the States to the western parts of America, will keep up the one, and keep down the other. I have been informed, and I believe rightly informed, that the amount of the imports from Europe, is a great or greater in the eastern or middle States, as in the south¦ern, in proportion to their numbers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a generally received opinion in this country, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exports of the eastern and middle States are very inconsiderable but this is a great mistake; for when we take into consideratio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their wheat, flour, lumber, flax-seed, pot-ash, fish oyl, iro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and rum, there can be no doubt but these articles produce gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sums. I am informed that the European goods annually shipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Massachusetts, are to a greater amount than those shipped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Virginia.

This has arisen from the cultivation of cotton which will not come to perfection to the northward; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> article is manufactured with much less trouble than eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flax or hemp.</P>
<P>IF this account be just, what have the southern States <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fear? But admitting some of the eastern and middle State
<PB N="28" REF="021264_0027_0FB2B814A3646CC0"/>

<P>BY this regulation every House of Representatives will have a share in the appropriations; and no mischief can ensue from appropriations of two years, since the proceedings of each House of Congress are to be published from time to time, as well as regular statements and accounts of the receipts and ex∣penditures of all public money.</P>

<P>BY these clauses, the appointment of the militia officers, and training the militia, are reserved to the respective States; ex∣cept that Congress have a right to direct in what manner they are to be disciplined, and the time when they are to be ordered out.</P>
<P>THESE clauses have been extremely misunderstood, or pur∣posely misconstrued, by the enemies to the Constitution. Some have said, <Q>the absolute unqualified command that Con∣gress
<PB N="30" REF="021264_0029_0FB2B817ABA72008"/>
have over the militia may be made instrumental to the destruction of all liberty, both public and private, whether of a personal, civil, or religious nature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minority address, p. <HI>22 23.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>IS this the result of reason, or is it the dictate of resentment? How can the command of Congress over the militia be either absolute or unqualified, when its officers are appointed by the States, and consequently can by no possibility become its crea∣tures?</P>
<P>THEY will generally be men of property and probity: And can any one for a moment suppose that such men will ever be so lost to a sense of liberty, the rights of their country, and their own dignity, as to become the instruments of arbitrary measures? Whenever that shall be the case, we may in vain contend for forms of government; the spirit of liberty will have taken its flight from America, and nothing but an arbitrary go∣vernment will be fit for such a people, however accurately de∣fined the powers of her Constitution may be. But so long as there shall be a militia so officered, or the majority of the peo∣ple landholders, America will have little to fear for liberty. Congress have the power of organizing the militia; and can it be put into better hands? They can have no interest in de∣stroying the personal liberty of any man, or raising his fortune in the mode of organization: They can make no law upon this, or any other subject, which will not affect themselves, their children, or their connexions.</P>
<P>CAN any one seriously suppose, that Congress will ever think of drawing the militia of one State out, in order to destroy the liberties of another? Of Virginia, for instance, to destroy the liberties of Pennsylvania? Or should they be so wicked,
<PB N="31" REF="021264_0030_0FB2B81914171100"/>
that an American militia, officered by the States, would obey so odious a mandate?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minority address. That hasty and passionate performance is full of absurdities upon this head.</NOTE> The supposition is monstrous.</P>
<P><HI>To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the Legis∣lature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful build∣ings.</HI></P>
<P>So great is the jealousy of some of our citizens, that even this clause has excited their fears. This little spot is to be the centre to which is to be attracted all the wealth and power of this extensive continent: The focus which will absorb the last remains of American liberty. Such are the visionary phan∣toms of the antifederalists.</P>
<P>THE Congress is to govern, as they shall see fit, a district not more than ten miles square. And what possible mischief can arise to the United States from hence? This district must either be purchased by Congress, or yielded to them by the inhabitants of that particular spot, which they may conceive most convenient for them to assemble at, and for which the consent of the State is necessary. If the first, there will be few or no inhabitants; they will therefore induce people to settle it, by establishing a mild government. If the second, the in∣habitants of any particular district certainly have a right to submit to whatever form of government they may think agree∣able, provided the State within which the district lies, consents; without giving offence to Virginia, or any other of the States.

We are told that the wise Franklin has recommended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Philadelphians to offer their city and its environs as the seat of Congress. Can it be supposed that he would recommend this measure to his favorite city were he not well assured that the government of Congress will be a good one? I have no doubt but this district will flourish; that it will increase in populaton and wealth: Because I have no doubt but most people would think it a happiness to live under the government of such men as will compose the Congress; or under such a government as such men will frame for that district.</P>
<P><HI>And—To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into executiont the foregoing powers, and other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any departmen or officer thereof.</HI></P>
<P>BY this clause, Congress have no farther legislative authori∣ty than shall be deemed necessary to carry into execution the powers vested by this Constitution. This regulation is necessary; as without it the different States might counteract all the laws of Congress, and render the Federal Government nugatory.</P>
<P>Sect. 9. <HI>The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.</HI></P>
<P>THIS clause is a proof of deference in the members of the Convention, to each other, and of concession of the northern to the southern States. There is no doubt but far the greater part of that Convention hold domestic slavery in abhorrence. But the members from South-Carolina and Georgia, thinking slaves absolutely necessary for the cultivation and melioration
<PB N="33" REF="021264_0032_0FB2B81C0475B558"/>
of their States, insisted upon this clause. But it affects not the law of Virginia which prohibits the importation of slaves.</P>
<P><HI>The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be sus∣pended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.</HI></P>
<P>BY this clause the Congress have the right of suspending the habeas corpus in the two cases of insurrection and rebel∣lion—a power which follows from the necessity of the thing.</P>
<P><HI>No bill of attainder or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ex post facto law shall be passed.</HI></P>
<P>IT is extraordinary that Mr. Mason should have made a part of this clause a ground of objection. 'Till that gentleman denied it, I had supposed it an universally received opinion that ex post facto laws were dangerous in their principle, and oppressive in their execution. And with respect to bills o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attainder, a very slight acquaintance with the history of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> country in which alone they are used, is sufficient to discove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they have been generally made the means of oppression.</P>
<P><HI>No capitation, or other direct tax, shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.</HI></P>
<P>THIS clause is a confirmation of the third clause of the se¦cond section of the first article.</P>
<P><HI>No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State. No preference shall be given by any regulation of com¦merce or revenue, to the ports of one State, over those of another Nor shall vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to en¦ter, clear, or pay duties in another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="021264_0033_0FB2B81DD822D158"/>ALL writers upon finance hold taxes upon exports to be im∣politic. Yet there are doubtless some articles which will with propriety bear an export duty; such as tobacco and perhaps indigo. But then these articles are of the growth of only five of the States; and it would be a manifest injustice that the pro∣duce of some States should be taxed for the benefit of others. The latter part of the clause provides that all Naval Officers fees and port charges shall be the same throughout the United States; and that a vessel bound to one State from another, and calling at any intermediate State, shall not be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duty, in such State. This tends to faci∣litate the intercourse among the States, and may produce many commercial conveniencies.</P>
<P><HI>No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in conse∣quence of appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money, shall be published from time to time.</HI></P>
<P>AS all appropriations of money are to be made by law, and regular statements thereof published, no money can be applied but to the use of the United States.</P>
<P><HI>No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States:— And no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.</HI></P>
<P>THE first part of this clause proves the Convention had no aristocratical views, nor any idea of establishing an order in the State, with rights independent of the people. The latter part of it is introduced to prevent the officers of the Federal Government being warped from their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="021264_0034_0FB2B81F85780A28"/>Sect. 10. <HI>No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin mo∣ney; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.</HI></P>
<P>THE States, in their individual capacities, should be re∣strained from the exercise of the powers enumerated in this clause, for a variety of reasons. If any State should have a right of making treaties, granting letters of marque, and the like, America might be perpetually involved in foreign wars. By exercising the right of coinage and of emitting bills of cre∣dit, a State might, by the former, debase the currency of the United States, by mixing great quantities of alloy, and by that means defraud the Federal Treasury; and by the latter it might defraud not only its own citizens, but the citizens of other States. But this is not all. An exercise of these rights would materially interfere with the exercise of the like by the Congress; and therefore the particular, should give way to the general interest. The making any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, and the impairing the obligation of contracts, is so great a political injustice, that the Constitu∣tion here requires of the States, that they will forever relin∣quish the exercise of a power so odious. This part of the clause would probably never have been introduced, had not some of the States afforded too frequent instances of unjust laws upon these subjects.</P>
<P><HI>No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports and exports, except what may be obsolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws; and the nett produce of all duties and imposts, laid by any State on im∣ports or exports, shall be for the use of the Treasury of the Unit∣ed States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and
<PB N="36" REF="021264_0035_0FB2B8227233AB58"/>
controul of the Congress. No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops, or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war; un∣less actually invaded, or in such imminent danger, as will not admit of delay.</HI></P>
<P>IF the individual States might lay duties upon the imports, it would be counteracting the same right in Congress, and ruin the great fund out of which the present federal debts are to be paid, as well as the future federal expences defrayed. And with regard to exports, it was highly reasonable that one State should be prohibited from laying an export duty on the articles of a sister State, which may be shipped through that State.</P>
<P>THE exigencies of the Union may however require direct taxes. By this clause, a door is open to the States, to raise their respective quotas, in lieu of direct taxes; by laying a duty upon exports; or even duties upon imports. But as the amount of these duties are to be paid into the public Treasury, no inconvenience can, on the one hand, arise to the general welfare from them; and, on the other, the power of revision in the Congress will be the means of securing a due attention to the interests of all the States, in the mode of laying the du∣ty, as well as in the application of it. The latter part of the clause is no more than a confirmation of principles antecedent∣ly established, and of powers before vested in the Congress; but such as are absolutely necessary for the good order, dig∣nity, and harmony of the whole; and are such as the States have already yielded to the present Congress.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Article the 6th of the Confederation.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE</HI> II.</HEAD>
<P>Sect. 1. <HI>The Executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and together with the Vice-President, cho∣sen for the same term, be elected as follows:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of Electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: But no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote, by ballot, for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inha∣bitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit, sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representative shall immediately chuse, by ballot, one of them for President and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the list the said House shall in like manner chuse the Presiden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But in chusing the President, the votes shall be taken by State the Representation from each State having one vote; a quoru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cessary to a choice, In every case, after the choice of the Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dent,
<PB N="38" REF="021264_0037_0FB2B8269594DF30"/>
the person having the greatest number of votes of the Elec∣tors, shall be the Vice-President. But if there should remain two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall chuse from them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y ballot, the Vice-President.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been urged by many, that the President should be continued in office, only a given number of years, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rendered ineligible. To this it may be answered, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat to be the case, a good officer might be displaced, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad one succeed. Knowing that he could not be continued, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might be more attentive to enrich himself, should opportu∣nities offer, than to the execution of his office. But as his con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuance in office, will depend upon his discharging the duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it with ability, and integrity, his eligibility will most pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably be the best security for his conduct. The longer a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f abilities and virtue, fills an office, the better, and easier <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the duties of it be discharged: The whole system of ad∣ministration becomes well arranged; and every department in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e government well filled. An election to this office once in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very four years, is a sufficient curb upon the President: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lectors hold the reins. If he has misconducted himself, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill not be re-elected; if has governed with prudence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bility, he ought to be continued.</P>
<P>THE Vice-President will probably be a candidate to succeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e President. The former will therefore be a perpetual cen∣nel over the latter; will be a stimulus to keep him up to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty, and afford an additional security for his upright conduct.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these reasons, and the powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecks opposed to the powers of the President, the enemies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Constitution has sounded the alarm with great violence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the ground of his eligibility for life. Some tell us that will be the means of his becoming the hereditary sovereign of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e United States; whilst others hold up to our view the dan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs of an elective monarchy.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="021264_0038_0FB2B828095626E8"/>IT is pretty certain that the President can never become the sovereign of America, but with the voluntary consent of the people: He is re-elected by them; not by any body of men over whom he may have gained an undue influence. No citi∣zen of America has a fortune sufficiently large, to enable him to raise and support a single regiment. The President's salary will be greatly inadequate either to the purpose of gaining adherents, or of supporting a military force: He will possess no princely revenues, and his personal influence will be con∣fined to his native State. Besides, the Constitution has pro∣vided, that no person shall be eligible to the office, who is not thirty-five years old; and in the course of nature very few fa∣thers leave a son who has arrived to that age. The powers of the President are not kingly, any more than the ensigns of his office. He has no guards, no regalia, none of those royal trappings which would set him apart from the rest of his fellow citizens. Suppose the first President should be continued for life: What expectations can any man in the Union have to succeed him, except such as are grounded upon the popularity of his character?</P>
<P>NONE of its citizens possess distinct principalities, from whence money may be drawn to purchase, or armies raised to intimidate the votes. Fortunately for America, she has no neighbouring Princess to interfere in her elections, or her councils: No Empress of Russia to place the Crown upon the head of her favorite Powniotowsky.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present King of Poland was Stanislaus Leginski, Count Powniotowsky.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT has also been objected, that a Council of State ought to have been assigned the President. The want of it, is, in my apprehension, a perfection rather than a blemish. What pur∣pose would such a Council answer, but that of diminishing, or
<PB N="40" REF="021264_0039_0FB2B82AF84EEAC0"/>
annihilating the responsibility annexed to the character of the President. From the superiority of his talents, or the superior dignity of his place, he would probably acquire an undue in∣fluence over, and might induce a majority of them to advise measures injurious to the welfare of the States, at the same time that he would have the means of sheltering himself from impeachment, under that majority. I will here once for all observe, that descended as we are from the English, conver∣sant as we are in the political history of that country, it is im∣possible not to derive both political opinions, and prejudices, from that source. The objectors probably considered, that as in the English government, the first Magistrate has a Council of State; there should be one also in the American. But they should at the same time have recollected, that the King of England is not personnally responsible for his conduct; but that her Constitution looks up to his Ministers, that is, to his Council, to answer for the measures of the Sovereign. But in the American Constitution, the first Magistrate is the efficient Minister of the people, and as such, ought to be alone respon∣sible for his conduct. Let him act pursuant to the dictates of his own judgment; let him advise with his friends; let him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsult those of whom he has the highest opinion for wisdom; but let not his responsibility be diminished by giving him a Council.</P>

<P><HI>No person, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> United States.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation:</HI> <Q>I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of Presiden of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend, the Constitution of the United States.</Q></P>
<P>THE first of these clauses is intended to prevent intrigue and tumult in chusing the Electors: And the reasons already of∣fered, why Congress should have the right of altering "the times and manner of holding the elections for Senators," ap∣ply why they should have the power of determining the time of chusing Electors. The fifth is an additional check upon the President.</P>
<P>Sect. 2. <HI>The President shall be Commander in Chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the United States: He may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the Executive departments, up∣on any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices,
<PB N="42" REF="021264_0041_0FB2B82D9D037D80"/>
and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offen∣ces against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.</HI></P>
<P>THE powers vested in the President by this and the subse∣quent clause, belong, from the nature of them, to the Execu∣tive branch of government; and could be placed in no other hands with propriety.</P>
<P>SO long as laws can not provide for every case that may happen: So long as punishments shall continue disproportion∣ate to crimes, the power of pardoning should some where exist. With whom could this power, so precious to huma∣nity, be better entrusted, than with the President? An offi∣cer who, from his age and experience, will seldom be misled in the exercise of it; and who less liable to the influence of prejudice and passion than a popular assembly, will most pro∣bably be guided by discretion in the use of it.</P>
<P>WHY Governor Randolph should wish to take from him this power, at least in cases of treason; and why he should have made a distinction between the power of pardoning before, and after conviction; I am at a loss to conceive; and shall there∣fore attempt no further answer to an objection which appears to me, unsupported by reason.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Governor Randolph's letter. He has enforced none of his objections with reasons.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Sena∣tors present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appoint∣ments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be
<PB N="43" REF="021264_0042_0FB2B83359D22F08"/>
established by law. But the Congress may, by law, vest the ap∣pointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of law, or in the heads of depart∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>THE Constitution has here lessened the authority of the President, by making the assent of two-thirds of the Senate necessary in the important cases of making treaties, in ap∣pointing Ambassadors, the Judges of the Supreme Court, and the great officers of State.</P>
<P>WRITERS upon government have established it as a maxim, that the Executive and Legislative authority should be kept separate. But the position should be taken with considerable latitude. The Executive authority here given to a branch of the Legislature, is no novelty, in free governments. In Eng∣land, the Executive, or Cabinet Council, is taken indifferent∣ly from either House of Parliament. In the States of New York and Jersey, the Senate not only act as an Executive Council, but also form a part of the Court of Appeals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be observed, that this is the only instance where the Senate have the shadow of Executive power.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE following reasons suggest themselves in support of the propriety of vesting the President and Senate with the power of making treaties.</P>
<P>THE President is the Representative of the Union: The Senate the Representatives of the respective States. The ob∣jects of treaties must always be either of great national import, or such as concern the States in their individual capacities; but never can concern the individual members of the State. Secrecy and dispatch are necessary in making them: For with∣out secrecy and dispatch, they are seldom made to purpose. Hence arises the impropriety of consulting either the Repre∣sentatives
<PB N="44" REF="021264_0043_0FB2B835900D7B58"/>

<P><PB N="46" REF="021264_0045_0FB2B83A12895898"/>NO part of the Constitution seems to have been so little un∣derstood, or so purposely misconstrued, as this article. Its enemies have mustered all their forces against the Federal Court; and have loudly sounded the trumpet, for the benevo∣lent purpose of alarming the good people of Virginia, with the fears of <HI>visionary</HI> danger and imaginary oppression. They have told them the Federal Court, like Aron's rod, would swallow up all the judiciary authority of the respective States. That a citizen of Virginia may be forced to Philadelphia for a debt of 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> although it was contracted with a fellow citizen: And, above all, that the trial by jury is not preserved. In a word, it is the Federal Court that is to be made the great in∣strument of tyranny.</P>
<P>THESE indeed would be serious objections were they well founded.</P>
<P>IT is on all hands admitted, that a Federal Court is necessa∣ry, for a variety of purposes, and under a variety of circum∣stances.</P>
<P>THE only question then is, whether the enumeration of the cases assigned to the Federal Court, by this article, is likely to produce oppression? Or if there be any ground to appre∣hend that Congress will not, by law provide a remedy for all probable hardships, and render the federal jurisdiction conve∣nient to every part of the United States?</P>
<P>THERE has been no objection raised to the Federal Court having original jurisdiction, in all cases respecting public Mi∣nisters, and where a State may be a party; and these are the only cases wherein it has <HI>original jurisdiction.</HI> In these cases, in controversies between two or more States, and between a State and citizens of another State, and between citizens of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame claiming lands under grants of different States, the pre∣sent

Congress have the right of determining.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>9</HI> Article of the Confederation.</NOTE> Here the judi∣ciary is blended in an eminent degree with the Legislative au∣thority; a strong reason, among many others, for new model∣ing that unskilful organized body.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Under the present Confederation, every department of go∣vernment, is lodged in the same body; which alone is a sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason for adopting a new federal system.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Convention sensible of this defect, has wisely assigned the cognizance of these and other controversies to a proper tribunal, a Court of Law.</P>
<P>AMONG these controversies, there is but one possible case where a dispute between two citizens of the same State can be carried, even by appeal, to the Federal Court; and that is, when they claim the same land under grants from different States. As their title is derived through States, this case is precisely within the reason which applies to controversies wherein two States are parties.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this, we are told that in the most or∣dinary cases, a citizen of Virginia may be dragged within the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court, although the trans∣action which gave rise to the controversy originated between fellow citizens. This, it is said, may be effected, by assigning a bond, for instance, given by one fellow citizen to another, either to a foreigner or a citizen of another State. To this I answer, that such assignment would not be attended with any such consequence; because it is a principle in law, that the assignee stands in the place of the assignor; and is neither in a better nor a worse condition. It is likewise asserted, that if two citi∣zens of the same State claim lands lying in a different State,
<PB N="48" REF="021264_0047_0FB2B83D56D5EE98"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat their suit may be carried to the Federal Court for final de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermination. This assertion is equally groundless. For this being a local action, it must be determined in the State where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the lands lie.</P>
<P>AND I repeat it again, because it cannot be too often repeat∣ed, that but one possible case exists, where a controversy be∣tween citizens of the same State can be carried into the Fede∣ral Court. How then is it possible that the Federal Court can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver swallow up the State jurisdictions, or be converted to the purposes of oppression.</P>
<P>SEVERAL reasons occur why the Federal Court should pos∣sess an appellate jurisdiction in controversies between foreign∣ers and citizens, and between the citizens of different States. A foreigner should have the privilege of carrying his suit to the Federal Court, as well for the sake of justice, as from po∣litical motives. Were he confined to seek redress in the tribu∣nal of that State, wherein he received the injury, he might not obtain it, from the influence of his adversary; and by giv∣ing him this additional and certain means of obtaining justice, foreigners will be encouraged to trade with us, to give us cre∣dit, and to employ their capitals in our country. Then con∣troversies must for the most part arise from commercial transactions, by which the bulk of the people can be seldom effected. The first part of this reasoning equally applies to con∣troversies between citizens of different States. Besides, were the jurisdiction of the Federal Court not coextensive with the government itself, as far as foreigners are concerned, a con∣troversy between individuals might produce a national quarrel, which commencing in reprisals, would probably terminate in war. Suppose a subject of France or Great Britain should complain to the Minister residing at the seat of Congress, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was impossible to obtain justice in a Court of Law, in Vir∣ginia,
<PB N="49" REF="021264_0048_0FB2B83EC3CA2B48"/>
for instance. The Minister represents the matter to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Court. That Court will apply to the Congress, not to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> individual State, for redress. Congress replies, <Q>we lamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that it is not in our power to remedy the evil; but we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no authority over the jurisprudence of the State.</Q> Is it pro¦bable that such an answer will be satisfactory to powerful na¦tions? Will they not say <Q>we must take that redress by forc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which your feeble government denies us? We are unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the necessity of seizing American property wherever we ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lay our hands upon it, till the just demands of our subject are satisfied.</Q></P>
<P>THOSE objectors who are so much alarmed for the trial by jury, seem little acquainted either with the origin or use o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that celebrated mode of trial.</P>
<P>I WILL take leave to inform them, that by our laws a va∣riety of important causes are daily determined without the in∣tervention of a jury, not only in the Court of Chancery, but in those of common law; and that by several of our acts of Assembly, the General Court has a power of assessing fines as high as 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for inconsiderable delinquencies, without the intervention of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry, even to find the fact.</P>
<P>AS I have before observed, these causes will be from the nature of things, generally mercantile disputes; must be mat∣ters of account, which will be referred to commissioners, as is the practice of all common law Courts in similar cases. When∣ever it may be necessary that the facts should be stated, no doubt they will be found by a jury of the State, from whence the cause is carried; and will be made a part of the record.</P>
<P>IN criminal cases, the trial by jury is most important. In criminal cases the Constitution has established it unequivocal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.
<PB N="50" REF="021264_0049_0FB2B84047E78F40"/>
But in having only recognized this trial in criminal, it by no means follows that it takes it away in civil cases: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may fairly presume, that by the law which the Congress will make to compleat the system of the Federal Court, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e introduced, as far as it shall be found practicable, and ap∣plicable to such controversies as from their nature are subjects proper to be determined in that Court.</P>
<P>ALL civilized societies have found it necessary to punish a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ariety of offences, with the loss of life. The life of man is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erious forfeiture: Our law has therefore humanely and just∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y said, that it shall not be affected, but by the unanimous opinion of twelve men. In a political view, this mode of tri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, in State prosecutions, is of still greater importance. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief Magistrate, or the Legislature itself, of a republic, is as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able to personal prejudice, and to passion, as any King in Europe; and might prosecute a bold writer, or any other per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, who had become obnoxious to their resentment, with as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch violence and rigour. What so admirable a barrier to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efend the innocent, and protect the weak from the attacks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power, as the interposition of a jury? In this respect, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rial by jury may well be called the palladium of liberty.</P>
<P>THE framers of the Constitution viewing it in this light, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lthough it was impossible to enter minutely into the subject of the Federal Court, and arrange it fully, took care to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lare that, in criminal cases, the trial by jury should be pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rved, lest we should have had some ground of uneasiness upon that important point.</P>
<P>I MUST farther observe, that the Federal Court has no ju∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sdiction over any offences except such as are against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: And the criminal is to be tried in the State where be fact is committed.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="021264_0050_0FB2B84712FB6BB8"/>IT is asked, why has not the Constitution more accurately defined the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, more clearly as¦certained its limits, and more fully pointed out the modes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trial?</P>
<P>TO this it may be answered, that the out-lines of the piece are traced with sufficient accuracy: That to have entered mi∣nutely into this subject, to have filled it with all its parts would have employed almost as much time as framing the Constitution itself, and would have spun out the work to a tedious length. In that case the Convention must have ascer∣tained the number of inferior Courts necessary, the number o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judges, and other officers, with their salaries, the times of holding the Federal Courts, the duration of their terms; in what cases the trial shall be by jury, in what not, with an in∣finite variety of circumstances, the introduction of which in a system of government, would have made a strange appearance. They therefore properly left to the Congress the power of or∣ganizing by law the Federal Court: Well knowing that at least eight of the States must, from their local situation, con∣cur in rendering it convenient to the whole.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four eastern States, and the four southern, being at a great distance from the center, will necessarily concur in mak∣ing the Federal Court as convenient as possible: And therefore appeals to the Supreme Court will be allowed only in cases of great consequence.</NOTE></P>

<P>ALL human productions must partake of imperfection.

<P>THERE is not an article of the Constitution that deserves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cater praise than this.

arise, which would render alterations in the government ne¦cessary; have declard that whenever two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or two-thirds of the State Legislatures, shall con∣cur in deeming amendments necessary, a general Convention shall be appointed, the result of which, when ratified by three fourths of the Legislatures, shall become a part of the Federal Government.</P>
<P>I CONFESS myself at a loss to conceive what better mode could have been adopted. If the system be reduced to prac∣tice, and experience shall discover important defects, there can be no doubt but that two-thirds of Congress will be sensi∣ble to them, and will point them out to the different Legisla∣tures. On the other hand, it is equally certain, that if the defects be flagrant, they will be readily seen by two thirds of the Legislatures, and a Convention will necessarily be the con∣sequence: Nor is there any cause to apprehend, that the re∣sult of such Convention, will be rejected by one-fourth of the States: Since all the States must feel the inconvenience of im∣portant defects.</P>
<P>BUT, say the friends to previous amendments, friends, as many of them pretend even to an energetic Federal Govern∣ment,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Gerry's, Mr. Mason's, and Governor Randolph's, objections.</NOTE> why not amend the Constitution before it is adopted? To this it may be answered, that they should first demonstrate their objections to be well founded; and that their proposed amendments, if they can be said to have offered any, would make it better. I am inclined to think, that neither Mr. Ger∣ry's, Mr. Mason's, nor Governor Randolph's, would. Upon this occasion I hope I shall be excused for recommending to those gentlemen, as well as to other objectors, Dr. Franklin's last speech in the Convention, which is replete with good sense,
<PB N="56" REF="021264_0055_0FB2B84F00E5CC20"/>
as well as a marked deference for the opinions of others. If the objections of these gentlemen be groundless, the Constitu∣tion needs no amendment; if they be not, it cannot be amend∣ed in the manner they propose. Mr. Mason, Mr. Randolph, the State of Virginia, raise objections: Mr. Gerry, and the State of Massachusetts, do the same: Every other citizen, every other State, has an equal right. A new Convention is formed, the proposed plan is amended, or a new one produced. It is again presented to the public eye. New blemishes appear new amendments are thought necessary. That which Mr. Mason may think a perfection, another may think a fault: What would be agreeable to Massachusetts, might displease Virginia. In a word, there would be no end to objections, amendments, and Conventions. All federal government falls to the ground.

<P>TREATIES ought of right to be considered in the light, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Convention has here viewed them. For why should they be made, if due obedience is not to be paid them? The ne¦gative can only be supported by those who feel it their interest that they should be disregarded.</P>
<P>THE objects of government are protection and security Many national circumstances may arise wherein these object cannot be effected, without the observance of treaties.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider who it is that has the power of making treaties, the manner of his election, the checks that the Con¦stitution has interposed to guard against his possible abuse o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power, among which his liability to impeachment is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the least: When we consider the subject matter of treatie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are always of national import, and can not affect the interest of individuals, we have no reason to fear that they will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made improvidently, or converted into instruments of oppre¦sion: They may be unwise, but can never be intentionall wicked.</P>
<P>THIS, like every other article of the Constitution, was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subject of long and serious deliberation; and it was ultimatel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and rightly determined, that as the power of making treatie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was necessary, it could no where so properly, or so safely b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> placed for the interests of the Union as in the hands of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> President: And if when made they were not to have the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦fect of law, the power of making them would be nugatory
<PB N="58" REF="021264_0057_0FB2B85717FB09C0"/>
The following passage from Blackstone's Commentaries, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to illustrate this subject, "It is also," says that elegant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommentator, "the King's prerogative to make treaties, leagues, and alliances, with foreign States and Princes. For it is by the <HI>law of nations</HI> essential to the goodness of a league, that it be made by the sovereign power, and that it is binding upon the whole community: And in England the sovereign power, quod hoc, is vested in the person of the King. Whatever contracts therefore he engages in, no other person in the kingdom can legally delay, resist, or an∣nul. And yet lest this plenitude of authority should be abus∣ed, to the detriment of the public, the Constitution (as was hinted before) has here interposed a check by means of Par∣liamentary impeachment, for the punishment of such Mini∣sters, as from <HI>criminal</HI> motives advise or conclude any trea∣ty, which shall afterwards be judged to derogate from the honor and interest of the nation." 1 Bl. p. 257. I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all the political writers in support of the general doctrine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laid down. The Convention considered it just. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the necessity of entrusting the power to the President; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy also knew that in this, as in every other exercise of power, is the Minister of the people; and that whenever in making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaty he shall be governed by corrupt motives, he will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to impeachment.</P>
<P>HAVING thus gone through the different articles of the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ution. I will now endeavour to answer two other objections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been made to it. The first is, "that the liberty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> press is not secured." The second, "that it will annihilate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dependence of the different States."</P>
<P>ON the first objection I shall only observe, that as the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> can claim the exercise of no right which is not expressly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them by this Constitution; they will have no power to
<PB N="59" REF="021264_0058_0FB2B858C9511DD8"/>
restrain the press in any of the States; and therefore it would have been improper to have taken any notice of it. The ar∣ticle respecting the habeas corpus act corroborates this doc∣trine. The Convention were sensible that a federal govern∣ment would no more have the right of suspending that useful law, without the consent of the States, than that of restraining the liberty of the press: But at the same time they knew that circumstances might arise to render necessary the suspension of the habeas corpus act, and therefore they require of the States, that they will vest them with that power, whenever those cir∣cumstances shall exist. But they also knew, that no circum∣stances could make it necessary that the liberty of the press should be entrusted to them, and therefore they judged it im∣pertinent to introduce the subject. But still there are fears for the district which may become the seat of Congress, and which may be ten miles square.</P>
<P>CAN it be for a moment supposed, that Congress will not preserve the liberty of the press in the government of that dis∣trict? Or that there exist American citizens so lost to a sense of liberty, as to reside under a govenment where it shall be taken away?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be observed, that the consent of the State where this district shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, must be obtained by the Congress: And the State may stipulate the terms of the cession.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS to the other objection, I will admit, that by this Consti∣tution, the several States will be abridged of some of their powers; but of no more than are necessary to make a strong federal government. Sufficient still remains with the State Le∣gislatures to preserve the quiet, liberty, and welfare, of their citizens. To them is left the whole domestic government of
<PB N="60" REF="021264_0059_0FB2B85A529A0DF0"/>
the States; they may still regulate the rules of property, the rights of persons, every thing that relates to their internal po∣lice, and whatever effects neither foreign affairs nor the rights of the other States. Powers weighty enough to be entrusted to most men; and which good and modest men would think sufficient to be entrusted to them. Besides we should remem∣ber that every State has its proportionate share in the national government; and that the Constitution has not only guaran∣teed to them a republican form, but has made <HI>their</HI> indepen∣dence necessary to <HI>its own</HI> existence.</P>
<P>THE adoption of this government will not only preserve our Union, and thereby secure our internal happiness; but will restore that consequence and respectability abroad, which have been lost since the days of Saratoga and York. The firm con∣federation of thirteen States, inhabiting a fertile soil, and grow∣ing rapidly in population and strength, will give them an im∣portance in the world, which they never can acquire when dis∣united: And we are assured from the best authority, that the link of the present Union is but a thread. An energetic go∣vernment will give a spring to every thing: New life will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfused throughout the American system. Our credit will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estored; because the proposed Constitution at the same time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it will give us vigour, will inspire foreign nations with a confidence in us. The restoration of credit, will be the revi∣val of commerce. The sound of the hammer will be again heard in our ports. The ocean will once more be covered with our ships, and the flag of the United States be respected by the nations.</P>
<P>BUT once disunited, these bright prospects immediately va∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Our western hemisphere is clouded over; and destruc∣tive
<PB N="61" REF="021264_0060_0FB2B85C2874FAB8"/>
storms arise. Our inactivity and torpor produced by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relaxation of our laws will become inveterate, unless our inter∣nal quarrels shall rouse us into action; the seeds of whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been long sown, and disunion will make the harve plentiful. Massachusetts and New-Hampshire have more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a pretext of quarrel in their pretensions to the province <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Main; and their mutual interference in the fisheries will s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to increase the dispute. Connecticut and New-York may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vive their old quarrel respecting boundaries. Pennsylvan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> will not forget that the territory of Delaware was once unit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to her; and will probably cast thither a longing eye. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> land and Virginia may dispute the right to the Shores of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> towmack, and the latter may readily revive with Pennsyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦nia, the old dispute respecting the northern boundings: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dispute which terminated unfavourably to Virginia, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the peculiarity of it, was difficult to settle. When such causes of dissention, we add the commercial regulatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the individual States, the ambitious views of their leads and the ill-grounded, though rooted, prejudices of the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have we not abundant reason to fear the most serious calam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ties from a disunion? Then will open a new scene in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦rica; the sword is then drawn not against foreign foes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against each other: The sword is then drawn never to sheathed, till some State more powerful or more fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than the rest, shall subjugate the whole.</P>
<P>EXAMINE then, my countrymen, dispassionately the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦posed plan of federal government, and you will find that far from being full of defects, it is a system well calculated preserve the liberty, and ensure the happiness of Ame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that it reflects additional honor on the names of a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>INTENDED to have subjoined some observations upon Mr Lee's letter to Governor Randolph; but finding that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s manner of treating the subject has carried me farther than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpected, and that answers to most of that gentleman's ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions have arisen naturally out of the different articles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Constitution, I have declined it, for fear lest the length of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e performance might become fatiguing. For however im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtant such a subject may be to mankind; few have the art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treating political disquisitions in such a manner as to inter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the majority of readers. I will h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ever, in this place, ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve, that Mr. Lee, to whose mellifluous tongue, I have of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> listened with pleasure, and who may be said to have grown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in politics, must have written that letter in the heat of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, before he had well considered the proposed system of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral government; or he never could have talked of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and threads of representation, or laid himself so open to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck in every quarter. Mr. Lee, like most other enemies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Constitution, objects without pointing out the alterations

Mr. Gerry's and Mr. Mason's ob∣jections take up but a small compass: But neither of these gentlemen has deigned to give us any thing like argument in support of his objections. Mr. Randolph has said much to point out the necessity of an energetic federal government; but no∣thing to prove that his proposed amendments are founded in reason. And Mr. Lee would have the government wholly new modelled to please himself. I suspect some of these gentle∣men have upon this occasion too much resembled Dr. Frank∣lin's French lady. I would ask Mr. Lee what advantage would result from a numerous representation in a federal Congress? If the numbers in America are not greatly exage∣rated, one member for every 30,000 will make the House of Representatives to consist of an 100; which number will be increased every ten years. Has not Mr. Lee's experience in public affairs taught him that even that is a number too large to transact business with facility? But let the number of that House be relatively great or small, it can in no sense be a rag or part of a representation. That House stands, as to fede∣ral purposes, in the place of the citizens of the thirteen States, and possesses all the powers conceded to it by the ci∣tizens of those States, consequently ten persons would be as much a representation as an hundred. Had Mr. Lee consi∣dered this government as intended for thirteen different States; had he considered that the powers vested in the Congress are merely national, that is such as respect America in its relative situation with foreign nations, or such as respect the relative situation of the States in their individual capacities; and that the States still retain the most important part of their rights, in as much as the right of Legislation in domestic cases, is of much greater consequence than in foreign, I think he never would have made the observation.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="021264_0063_0FB2B865F84BD5B0"/>I CONFESS that for some time I viewed some parts of the Constitution in the light Mr. Lee and some others have done. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at first conceived that the Senators where liable to impeach∣ment; and that some mischief might arise from treaties of peace being made the law of the land. But after mature delibera∣tion, I was convinced that I was mistaken in the former, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Constitution is right in the latter.</P>

<P>THE foregoing little piece was intended to counteract the misrepresentations of the proposed Federal Govern∣ment, which the antifederalists have most industriously disse∣minated in the southern counties. The writer had no idea of publishing any thing upon the subject of the Constitution, till a visit he made to one of those counties, where at the desire of his friend, he was induced to write in haste the pamphlet now offered to the public. It was to have been published time enough to be dispersed before the elections, but the Printer found it impossible to deliver it in time. The primary inten∣tion being thus defeated, it would not have been published at all, had it not been put into the press at the time stipulated. The writer had neither Mr. Mason's, Mr. Gerry's, nor Mr. Lee's objections by him: This it is hoped will be a sufficient apology for its inaccuracies, as far as their objections have been taken notice of. He takes this opportunity of observing, that perhaps he, and not Governor Randolph, is mistaken as to the <HI>impeachability</HI> of the Senate: He acknowledges that he has never conversed with any member of the late Convention upon the subject, though he still thinks that the arguments be
