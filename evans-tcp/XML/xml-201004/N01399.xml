<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THe Scriptures of Truth do not only clearly deliver to, and plainly teach us the Dortrine of a</HI> Future State; <HI>That we must Exist, and Live after this</HI> Mortal Life <HI>Expires; in our Souls</HI> Separatim, <HI>immediately upon our Dissolution, as Written in</HI> Eccl. 3.21. So 12 7. Then shall the Dust return to the Earth, as it was; and the Spirit shall return to God, who gave it.—<HI>And in our Whole Persons Incorruptibly reunited at the</HI> Sound of the Last Trump of God, when Death shall be Swallowed up in Victory, 1 Cor. 15.52, 54. So 1 Thes. 4.16. — <HI>But our Natures, and Condition in this Life do strongly argue it; Our Understandings, tho' naturally-darken∣ed, have a realizing View of it; Our Consciences dictate it, and frequently Alarm us with it: Nothing has a deeper Impres∣sion on us, nor appears with a more black, and formidable Aspect to us than this: — Our Minds hence keep ruffled and un∣easy; Our Thoughts confused, and rack'd, as well they may, Till we have made up and setled our Accompts with GOD, and got our Evidences clear for Heaven, Happiness and Glory.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Nothing concerns us like to this,</L>
<L>That Setled well our Soul's State is.</L></Q>
<P><HI>All the Business of Time is not worth the Naming with, being perfect Nothing to this Great and Truly Necessary Work, so near∣ly relating to</HI> ETERNITY, <HI>that continued</HI> NEVER END∣ING NOW. <HI>No refreshment in Our Journeying thro' the Hideous Wilderness of this World, like this; No Cordial so reviving, none so lasting: 'tis infinitely better than Cool Waters to a Dying thirsty Soul. — To be provided therefore is an Argument of our Christian Prudence, and Highest Wisdom: As an Help whereto this Small Tract, Entituled,</HI> Spiritual Anatomizing <HI>offers it Self to Publick View, in hopes of Answering the Design thereof, and meeting with a Candid Interpretation.</HI></P>
<Q><L>If thine be Christ, thine then is All;</L>

<HEAD><HI>Spiritual Anatomizing:</HI> OR, Characteristical Notes of a Godly State Propos'd, In the Ten following Heads of Queries.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">As Introductory whereto 'tis briefly Offer'd in Five Assertions. <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I. Asser.</HI> THAT <HI>Self Examination</HI> is a plain Gos∣pel Duty, urged on all the Disciples of Christ; in 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your selves whether ye be in the Faith:</HI> [that is] Search and Try, Whether ye be True Christians, or no: For Faith that is Evange∣lical, is our Spiritual Life: 1 Joh. 5.1. <HI>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God;</HI> and gives the Sub∣jects of it a just claime to that Honourable and Distin∣guishing Character. Whence, 'tis Evident, That the At∣tendance of this Duty of Self Tryal gives not the <HI>Being,</HI> tho' it may prove an happy Occasion of it, but is truly Necessary for the Well Being, Comfort and Serenity of a Christian.</P>
<P>The Precept here recommended and pressing it, is ge∣neral; it Reaches and Affects <HI>all Men</HI> under the Gospel: Both Good and Bad are concern'd therein: Gal. 6.4. <HI>Let every Man prove his own Work, and then shall he have rejoycing in himself alone, and not in another.</HI> And not only Duty to God obliges them; but <HI>Self Interest</HI> steps in and lays an indefeazible claim thereto. Self Tryal is a Debt to both God, and our Selves; and can we be so Unjust, and Un∣reasonable, as to forget, and neglect it, when the paying
<PB N="2" REF="001661_0006_0FB4D90885B3BB68"/>it may every way prove our Benefit and Advantage? For hereby we may <HI>Anatomize our Souls,</HI> Unveil their State, and so Discover, bring to Light, and take a Prospect of the Truth of Grace; or its Counterfeit in us. It will give us some Satisfying, if not undeniable Evidence, What our Estate is before the All-seeing, and Heart∣searching God: Jer. 17.10. Heb. 4.13. — Whe∣ther we have ever been born of God, <HI>Job.</HI> 3.3. And so are become <HI>New Creatures,</HI> or no? — Whether we have the Graces of the Spirit infus'd, and implanted in our Souls, or not? Even those better things, as, <HI>Faith, Repentance, Love,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That accompany Salvation,</HI> Heb. 6.9.</P>
<P>Whence, we shall be able to make a right judg∣ment of our Spiritual State, How the case stands with us before the Holy GOD; and so having set things in a true and clear Light, may have the Advantage of Rectifying all Previous Mistakes of our Selves, if any be, Whether resulting from a Criminal Neglect of, or Inadvertency in the Attendance of this Duty; and thereby prevent what otherwise might prove of Fatal Consequence: <HI>For</HI> (says the Apostle, Gal. 6.3.) <HI>if a Man think himself to be something, when he is Nothing, he Deceiveth himself.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. Asser.</HI> That this Tryal of our Selves must be In∣tense, Serious, Searching, Particular and Impartial: in∣timated by the Apostle in the next Paragragh of fore∣cited, 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Prove your own Selves.</HI> A Phrase very significant, and expressive; both dictating the manner, How we shou'd perform it, and pointing us to the Rule we must observe therein. As tho' it had been said, See that ye do it so, as will be to Effect; Attend that ratio∣nal Method, and those likely Measures square your Selves by, That will bring all to a Narrow, and fully resolve you of your Case. The work is Great, and Weighty, both in it self, Tendency and Consequents, and there∣fore must be gone about regularly, with utmost Care and Diligence. The Nature of it is Spiritual and nearly Concerns a future Life, to the rendring which gloriously happy, we must diligently inspect, and carefully cor∣rect
<PB N="3" REF="001661_0007_0FB4D90A083009F0"/>our present State. We must attend it with fervour and zeal; Yea, with the Closest Application, and In∣tenseness of Mind, that's possible; Whereby we shall but consult our Comfort and Happiness, and use One good Medium to our Chearful Persevering in Grace, shou'd we find the Root of the Matter in us, <HI>Job</HI> 19.38.</P>
<P>We must be strict, severe and thorough in this our Search; Admit of no Diversion, stop, or remora what∣ever, but be fix't, and resolute therein, lest Satan our common avow'd Enemy, and our deceitful and despe∣rately Wicked Hearts, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.9. do from their Aver∣sion to the Duty hurry us along, and precipitately throw us into fatal Mistakes, that might urge our building on a Sandy foundation.</P>
<P>Besides, We must not content our Selves with a Try∣al of our State in Gross, but be very Curious, Critical, and Exact therein: Attend it <HI>Gradatim,</HI> by steps, taking every thing in Course, Viewing them successively and well: Ever having in our Eye the <HI>New Creature</HI> in all its fine Parts, and charming Features, by which we must Compare our Selves, if we mean to make a true discovery of our State.</P>
<P>We must beware, we Omit nothing Essential in our Tryal, nor are wanting in our particular Personal Applications therein. We shou'd Ask our Selves all Pertinent Questions, and Summons Conscience to Answer them in Order, and Wait unwilling to pass any over un∣resolv'd: Gal. 6.7. <HI>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III. Asser.</HI> That we must be conformable to the <HI>Word of God;</HI> that Written Declaration of the Divine Will, which necessarily is our Rule therein: for therein only is the Natural Man decipher'd and drawn in his truest Colours to us: As in <HI>Psal.</HI> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7, 8. So <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10. <HI>to</HI> 18. inclusive; and in <HI>ver.</HI> 23. All have sinned and come short of the Glory of God, Eph. 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> Children of Disobedience; fulfilling the Will of the Flesh, and of the Mind; conformable to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the
<PB N="4" REF="001661_0008_0FB4D90C463DFDF0"/>Spirit that rules them; Naturally Children of Wrath' 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>New Creature</HI> is likewise there, and no where else livelily represented, and with a spi∣ritual Air delineated: Thus, 2 Cor. 5.17, 21. <HI>The New Creature is in Christ; Old things are past away, all things are become New. He is made the Righteousness of God in Christ.</HI> Eph. 4.24. <HI>The New Man is after God created in Righteous∣ness and true Holiness.</HI> Col. 3.10. <HI>Renewed in Knowledge af∣ter the Image of Him that created him.</HI> So 1 Joh. 1.4, 12, 18, 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Gods Written Word is the only Glass, wherein we may take a View of their respective Com∣plexions, and see how they stand in direct Opposition each to Other; and are not only of quite different Make and Shape, but of irreconcilable Tempers.</P>
<P>The true Character of One, as Pourtray'd in the Scrip∣tures of Truth is, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> the Reverse, in truth the Contradiction of the Other. This Divine Line, is what we only may measure our selves by, the stretch whereof must be our Boundary, whence we may obtain a full Resolution, and fetch a final Answer. It is a more sure Word of Prophesy, <HI>Whereunto</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>we do well, that we take heed, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark place,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV. Asser.</HI> That we should be Frequent therein. 'Twas the Advice of an Heathen Poet, <HI>Tecum Habita,</HI> Dwell with thy self; and is very Applicable and Instructive to the Christians; for the continuance of their Peace, and Increase of their Comfort depend there∣on. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. Medit. page 221.</NOTE> <Q>During this Mortal State we cannot attain to perfect Security, but are still left Exposed to Temptation, and Danger, that we may accomplish our Warfare with greater Circumspection, that our Obedience may be preserved with awe, <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.11. And our Joy Temper'd with Humility, and Trembling; not boasting our selves, whilst girding on our Armour, as they that put it off, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 20.11. But be renewing our Scrutiny, and Keeping our Watch.</Q> In his way we may Enjoy
<PB N="5" REF="001661_0009_0FB4D90DC776D3E0"/>more of the Light of Gods Countenance, the Rays whereof falling upon our Souls, will set us a moving in the Ways of Holiness, like the <HI>Chariots of Amminadab, Cant.</HI> 2.11. with a Nimble Spontaneity, and be quickening our Advances towards making with diligence <HI>Our Calling and Election Sure,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. By this Means we may see in what we have declin'd, and seemingly gone back in, to our Humiliation, and more speedy Amendment; Or how we have been Progressive Christians, and our Path hath been that of the Just, <HI>Prov.</HI> 4.18 shining resplendently with repeated In∣crease and additional Lustre, stretching it self to the Per∣fection of Meridian Beauty.</P>
<P><Q>Thus we may come to know what Ground we get, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern.— Lib. Animae. Page 376.</NOTE> or lose: what Alte∣rations are in us, how qualify'd, and circumstantiated; what Resem∣blance to, or Degeneracy from God; how near Approaches we have made, or to what distance we are cast. A Distance and Approach to be measured, not by Extension, and space, but by Actions and Dispositions.</Q></P>
<P>We shall find it a Motive to Obedience and an In∣centive to Holiness; 'twill keep us more Constant and Watchful on our Guard against the Wiles of the De∣vil, the Temptations and Snares of the World, and the Lustings of our Hearts; Whence we shall be more strong and powerful to withstand and repel the fiercest and most surprizing Assaults thereof. — In short, This will be a means to our gaining the Victory, and with Trophies of Honour triumphing over all the Ene∣mies of our Spiritual Welfare, to brighten our Graces, and make us with Christs Spouse, in <HI>Cant.</HI> 6.10. with a Charming Blush, <HI>To look forth as the Morning; fair as the Moon; clear as the Sun, and Terrible as an Army with Banners.</HI> —</P>
<P>Lastly,</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V. Asser.</HI> Seeing we have no Strength, nor Ability of our Own for such a Performance of this great and
<PB N="6" REF="001661_0010_0FB4D912ABAAD158"/>important Duty of <HI>Trying our State,</HI> as wou'd attain the desired End, for our Sufficiency only is of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. — And besides, since we are to take our Measures by the written Word of God for Direction, and Conduct herein, <HI>Job.</HI> 5.39. — It highly concerns us to rely on, and trust in the LORD JEHOVAH <HI>in whom is Everlasting Strength,</HI> Isai. 26.4. For His Divine Aids, and Grace to well furnish us to, and help us in every part of This so Necessary, and so Weighty a Bu∣siness; Submissively Prefacing our Entring thereon with our most Serious, Hearty, and Fervent Prayer to our Omniscient God, Agreeable with, if not in the Words of the Holy Psalmist, recorded, Psal. 26.2. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, and prove me; Try my veins and my heart.</HI> And Psal. 139.23, 24. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my Thoughts, and see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any Wicked way in me,</HI> discover it to me, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the way Everlasting.</HI> And with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to the Ephesians, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>verse</HI> 16. <HI>That he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us according to the Riches of his Glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man:</HI> which would well qualify, and prepare us to sincerely Answer and in our Minds resolve the <HI>Ten Heads of Questions</HI> nextly here recited, being all drawn from, and grounded on the Holy Scriptures: — Which wou'd not only give us Peace in our Minds, while we Live; but raise in us an holy Joy, when we dye: The former from a sense we may gain thereby of an Interest in Gods favour thro' Christ; and the latter from a Comfortable Assurance thence of a Triumphant Re∣surrection to Eternal Life, and Glory: — Agreeably says the Apostle in 2 Cor. 1.12. <HI>Our Rejoycing is this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Testimony of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that in Simplicity, and Godly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Grace of God</HI> we have Lived in this World. And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Departure hence with a well grounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon his Reflection and Profession; as written in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tim. 4.7. <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I have kept the Faith;</HI> Triumphantly con∣cludes, <HI>Hence forth there is laid up for me A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="001661_0011_0FB4D913C985BA98"/>OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, which the Lord will give in that Day, not to me only, but to all them also, that love his Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>And now the following Rules for the Tryal of our Spiritual State are Comprehensive Marks of the <HI>New Creature,</HI> Legible Characters of a Godly State, being fairly painted out to us in the written Word of God, and proposed here in a Method most easy, and fami∣liar; as well adapted to Babes in Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.1. as to those, that are Strong in the Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.20.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Ten Interrogative Rules of Tryal.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1. Rule.</HI> HAve we the Spirit of Christ? Otherwise (says the Apostle) <HI>We are none of His,</HI> Rom. 8.9. Are our Minds Spiritually Enlightened? Be the Eyes of our Understandings Opened? <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18. So as in any measure to convince and satisfy us of the Evil of Sin? Of the vile Nature, and Monstrous Deformity of it? This then is an happy Effect of the Spirits Office, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.8, 9, 10, 11. Are we hence become Uneasy under the Yoke of Sin? Are we weary of its Tyranny? and so made willing to part with it? Do we see and judge our Selves miserable, whilst under the Power of, and Acted by Sin? And are we truly desirous of a Remedy? <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.3. — Have we a Spiritual Palate? Do we relish the Heavenly Manna? Do we savour Spi∣ritual things? and Mind the things of God? pressing after a better Acquaintance with them? A more thorough Understanding of them? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.5. They that are after the Spirit, or become Spiritual, Mind the things of the Spirit. Do we live Mortify'd Lives? Do we not pamper the Flesh? and indulge our car∣nal Lusts? but do we what we can, Strive against and oppose the corrupt Dictates of our Natures? Do we Endeavour to withstand the Lustings of our Evil
<PB N="8" REF="001661_0012_0FB4D915471D6D28"/>Hearts, and Carnal Minds? Which are said to be Enmity against God, <HI>Ver.</HI> 7. Do we not willingly make Provi∣sion for, foster up, and gratify 'em? 'Tis written, <HI>Ver.</HI> 13. <HI>If ye live after the Flesh, ye shall dye, but if ye thro' the Spirit do mortify the Deeds of the Body ye shall live.</HI> Do we follow the Dictates of the Spirit of God? Are we in the Gene∣ral course of our Lives under the Divine Conduct of it? Be we guided thereby in the Way of Truth? <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.13. Does it lead us in the Paths of the Lords Precepts? And direct us to walk in his Statutes? This showes our Son-ship, <HI>Ver.</HI> 14. — Do we find our Infirmities help'd in our Applications by Prayer unto God? Do we Supplicate in the Spirit? And Pray with true Devotion of Soul? Are we Fervent, Zealous and Sincere in our Religious Addresses unto God? Do our Hearts go with our Mouths? Do we truly desire the Good we ask for? Do we find the Spirit of Grace breathing in us in our breathings up unto God? <HI>Ver.</HI> 26. Do we taste the first fruits of the Spirit? <HI>Ver.</HI> 23. — Does the Spirit witness to us for our Comfort? As that we are Pardoned Ones? That we are the Adopted of God? And the Sanctify'd in Christ Jesus? <HI>Ver.</HI> 15, 16. So 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12. Helping us with an holy Filial Confidence to cry, <HI>Abba Father, Gal.</HI> 4.6. Have we therein sweet intimate Converse, and endearing fellowship with Christ, and God the Father, thro' him? Tis Written, 1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> Have we any ravishing Interviews with Hea∣ven? — Do we Anticipate the Joys above? And does this Wing, and Enlarge our Desires to nearer Approaches? To more Open Views, and fairer Pros∣pects? And does this Serve to take us off from the Vanities of Time, and Sense; and to set us a long∣ing for the immediate Enjoyments of God, and Glory? If so we have the Earnest of our Inheritance until the Redemption of the Purchased Possession to the Praise of the Glory of Christ, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.14. And 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Hereby we know, that we dwell in him, and he in
<PB N="9" REF="001661_0013_0FB4D917A5DD5C00"/>us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</HI> Gal. 6.7, 8. <HI>Whatsoever a Man Soweth, that shall be also reap: — He that soweth to the Flesh, shall of the flesh reap Cor∣ruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spi∣rit reap LIFE EVERLASTING.</HI></P>
<P>This is an Undoubted Evidence.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. Rule.</HI> Do we Unfeignedly Believe on Christ? Do we heartily Credit the Report given of Him in the Scriptures of Truth? Are our Desires to Him, as to One Mighty, Able, and Willing to Save? Are we willing to take Him in all his Offices? As Pro∣phet to Enlighten, and Instruct us? As Priest to A∣tone for, and Reconcile us to God? And as our King to Reign in, Rule over, and Govern us according to his Will, and to Restrain, and Subdue our Spiritual Enemies for us? Do we rowl, and cast our Selves on Him, as an only Saviour? <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. Our only Atone∣ment, that Infinite Wisdom hath provided? <HI>Prov.</HI> 33.24. Can we leave our All with Him? Consecrating, and Devoting our All unto Him? 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5. Is this, tho' faint, yet the true desires, and attempts of our Souls? Are their Out-goings, tho' weak, yet only after Him? Did we ever discern any real, and distinguishing Ex∣cellency in Christ? Had we ever such a realizing View of his Form, Comeliness, and Beauty, as did carry Out, and Enlarge our Desires after Him? — Did we ever so Apprehend them, as rendred Him Lovely, yea altogether Lovely in our Eyes? <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.16. The truly, and only desireable One of our Souls? To be the <HI>Rose of Sharon, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Valleys?</HI> Cant. 2.1. Infinitely surpassing a <HI>Solomon</HI> in his most Splendid Appearances of Royalty and Glory; —Is Christ be∣come Precious to our Souls? Thus He is to true Believers on Him, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. Are our Hearts set upon Him? Are our Thoughts most an end going out after Him? Are our Minds frequently Engag'd in a sweet, if not a ravishing Contemplating on Him? Do we look upon Him, <HI>as the Power of God, and the
<PB N="10" REF="001661_0014_0FB4D91906331110"/>Wisdom of God?</HI> 1 Cor. 1.24. Do we labour to Sup∣press Vain Thoughts? And in no wise cherish and indulge them? We have then a glorious Title to the Beatifick Vision, <HI>Math.</HI> 5.8. Do we design, and accordingly, as we can, Apply our Selves to Oppose such Sinful Ebullitions of Heart? To check, and stifle Sin in its first Motions, and Stirrings therein? Do we thus make it our business to Purify our Hearts? So indeed do Believers on Christ: Acts 15.9. <HI>Purifying their Hearts by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>We then do believe in Christ, and have a Faith, of the right Kind; such a Faith, as is Operative, and Sa∣ving, A Faith, that always works by Love, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. The End of which, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.9. Is the Salvation of the Soul.</P>
<P>This is a Sure Token.</P>
<P><HI>III. Rule.</HI> Is it our real Desire, our Sincere, and Main Endeavour to be Interested in the Favour and Friendship of Christ? Do we so Esteem, and Appre∣tiate the same, as in Comparison there-with to con∣temn and despise the Friendship of the World? Do we not lay out our Selves after the Latter? Or ra∣ther do we neglect to secure it, as being Enmity to God, and Christ? <HI>James</HI> 4.4. Is the Bent of our In∣clinations chiefly, yea, only towards, and do we make a preferring Choice of Christs Friendship? Is it dear to us, as our Lives? And if standing in Competition there-with, cou'd we not rather Sacrifice them, than willingly sustain the loss of that? — And be we led hence to Value the fellowship of Jesus Christ? Do we prize it above, and prefer it to the fellowship of any Creature, whether intimatest Friend, or nearest and dearest Relative what ever? <HI>Math.</HI> 10.31. So <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.26. We must hate All to that, or we cannot be Christs Disciple. — Do we walk in All the Ordinances of Christs Instituting with sincere Desires, and Breathings of Soul, yea with Uncessant Hart-like Pantings after Communion with Him therein? <HI>Psal.</HI> 42.1. Is the
<PB N="11" REF="001661_0015_0FB4D91CE64A5670"/>reaching of our Soul, the stretch of our Inclinations therefor? And does the Experience of Christs Pre∣sence, the Breathings of his Spirit in upon our Souls in Ordinances give a pleasing Satisfaction to us? Does it cause us to sit under his Shadow with great de∣light? Do we find his fruit sweet unto our Taste? And his Banner over us to be Love? <HI>Cant.</HI> 2.4. And do such Discoveries refresh our Minds? Do they re∣vive us, tho' we walk in the midst of outward trou∣ble? <HI>Psal.</HI> 138.7. Do they replenish, and fill our hearts with holy Joy, and make us to rejoyce more, than in the Increase of Temporal Comforts? Or greatest Affluence of Worldly Enjoyments? Thus was it with the holy Psalmist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 4.6, 7. We may then triumph, and say with him, in Psal. 73.25. <HI>Whom have we in Heaven, but thee; and there is none upon Earth, that we desire besides thee.</HI> Ver. 26. <HI>God is the Strength of our Hearts, and our Portion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Comfortable and Sure Sign.</P>
<P><HI>IV. Rule.</HI> Are we true Penitents before God? Have we ever seen the Evil of Sin? How contrary to the pure Nature, and holy Will of God it is? How destructive to the Nature, Comfort, and Happiness of Man it proves? And is it thence become distastful to us? Yea is it rendred Odious in our Eyes? — Do we Own and Acknowledge our Selves Sinners by Nature? Under Original Guilt before God, which binds us over to Eternal Death? <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. And do we Mourn therefor? Are we Sorry for our Personal Transgressions? Do we with true Compunction of Soul bewaile them unto God? Do we grieve for our heart sins, as well as our Life sins? For our Inward, and Overt Acts of Obliquity, and Rebellion? As sinful Thoughts, as well as sinful Words, and Actions? For the Com∣mandment is Exceeding broad, reaching both the In∣ner, and Outward Man, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.96. Is Sin, as Sin, <HI>[i. e.]</HI> as 'tis an Offence to the Holy God, hateful to us? Can we say, We have a real Aversion to it, as
<PB N="12" REF="001661_0016_0FB4D91F06F0BBC0"/>such? Do we hate Sin with a perfect hatred? Is it our burden? Christ then Invites us with a Promise of Relief, and Ease, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.28. Do we grieve, that we can grieve no more for Sin? Do we make it the Mat∣ter of our greatest Complaint at the Throne of Grace in our Prayers unto God? — Is it our troublesome Companion? Our continual, constant Affliction, yea our greatest, and carried as such in our Addresses unto God? Do we groan to be deliver'd from this Body of Death? And deem, and call our Selves Wretched, till we be? <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. Do we treat Sin, as our Foe? and worst Enemy? Do we knowingly, and willingly indulge no Sin? Do we, what we can, abstain from our Own Iniquities? Our Constitution, and Complexion Sins? Do we Endeavour to lay aside the Sin, that Easily besets us? Our respective Natures lead, and prompt us to? <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. And, as we can, do we at all times turn from it? Shunning all Ways of Sin? All foreseen Temptations thereto? Yea, and do we avoid, what in us lies, all Appearances, and seeming Occasi∣ons of Sinning? 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5.22. — We have then a Sound Repentance, the fruit of a Godly Sorrow for Sin, which will prove to Salvation, not to be repented of, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.12. <HI>If the wicked forsake his Way, and the Unrighteous his Thoughts, and return unto the Lord,</HI> Isai. 55.7. <HI>He will have Mercy on him, and abundantly Pardon him.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Clear Evidence.</P>
<P><HI>V. Rule.</HI> Be we Loyal Subjects of GOD, the King of Heaven? Do we Esteem His Commandments to be Holy, Just and Good, and concerning all things to be Right? <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. Do we make his Will revealed in His Word the Rule, and Measure of all our Acti∣ons? Do we designedly Square them by Christs Gospel Rules? Do we willingly take Christ for our Lord, and Serve Him accordingly? <HI>Luke</HI> 4.8. Are we as willing Christ shou'd Rule and Govern us, as Reconcile us to God, and Save us? Do we Receive Him upon the Terms of the Gospel, as Prophet, Priest and King?
<PB N="13" REF="001661_0017_0FB4D92086EDE530"/>Do we with designed Chearfulness Submit unto His Roy∣al Scepter? Are both his Precepts and Examples, 1 Pet. 2.21. the matter of our Imitation and Practice? Is a Conformity thereto in the Progressive Course of our Lives, endeavoured after by us? Do we labour, that our Obedi∣ence does consist therein? Have we a respect unto all His Commandments? <HI>So shall we be void of shame before Him,</HI> Psal. 119.6. And if <HI>our Hearts Condemn us not, we have then Confidence towards God,</HI> 1 John 3.21. Do we Worship Christ in the Manner He prescribeth, approving of His Wisdom therein? Do we attend on all His Ordinances, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possibly we can; whether of a publick, or of a more private Nature? Otherwise we shall fall under Christ's sharp Reproof, and severest Censure, in Luke 6.46. <HI>And why call ye Me, LORD, LORD, and do not the things that I say.</HI> Is our Care Exercis'd in neglecting no known Duty, either to God, or our Fellow Creatures, tho' never so cross to our corrupt Dispositions of Na∣ture, or evil Inclinations thereof? Do we designedly com∣ply with every way of Duty, let it be never so thwart to our Temporal Interest? Yea, tho' we Incurr the ut∣most Disrespect and Displeasure of Men thereby? And become liable to undergo the greatest of Temporal Sufferings therefor? Do we thus, as Occasion calls for it, <HI>Deny our</HI> Natural <HI>Selves, take up our Cross, and follow Christ?</HI> Matth. 16.24. Have we an Holy Ambition in us of blamelessly Walking in the Commandments, and Ordi∣nances of the Lord, with them in Luk. 1.2. and so of being Righteous before God? Christ is then ours to Save us for ever: 'Tis Written, Heb 5.9. <HI>He being made Per∣fect, became the Authour of Eternal Salvation to all them that Obey Him.</HI></P>
<P>A Full, and Satisfying Token.</P>
<P><HI>VI. Rule.</HI> Have we a true Love to the Godly? Have we an Hearty Affection for the Saints in the Earth? Do we account such as bear Christ's Image, and are careful∣ly conforming to His Pattern and Precepts, the truly Excellent Ones? Prov. 12.26. Do we Affect their Society?
<PB N="14" REF="001661_0018_0FB4D92206A439D0"/>Do we frequent their Company? Thus did the Psalmist, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Example is recorded for our Imitation, Psal. 119.63. <HI>I am</HI> (says he) <HI>a Companion of all them that fear Thee, of them that keep thy Precepts.</HI> And is all our Delight in them? Do we really take Pleasure in them? Is their Conversation Pleasing and agreeable to us? Thus was it with the Psalmist, Psal. 16.3. Do we the rather do good to such? Do we even seek for Op∣portunities to do the best Offices we can for them? Are we in waiting Postures to Serve them? And do we chearfully Embrace Opportunities when they offer? Are we ready to Comfort, Relieve, and Help them, as their Need, and our knowledge thereof calls for? 'Tis Writ∣ten in Gal. 6.10. <HI>As we have therefore Opportunity, Let us do Good to all Men, especially unto them who are of the House∣hold of Faith.</HI> Do we make the several Conditions of the People of God, the respective Cases of the House-hold of Faith, to be even as our own? Do we rejoyce in and at the Flourishing Circumstances of any of Christ's Disciples? Be we likewise Deeply Affected with the sad Exercises, and grievous Sufferings of any of them that Fear His Name, and are watchful against all Iniquity? Agreeable to 2 Tim. 2.19. <HI>They that name the Name of Christ, must depart from Iniquity.</HI> — Do we so Sympathize with them, as to become Afflicted with their Afflictions; and Heartily grieve at the Afflictions of <HI>Joseph?</HI> Now <HI>he that thus dwells in Love with the Brethren, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> 1 John 4.16. This is a most Infallible Mark.</P>
<P>As appears expresly from 1 Joh. 3.14. <HI>We know</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>we have passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VII. Rule.</HI> Are we of a Reconciling, and Forgiving Spirit? Can we easily Overlook Injuries, that are done us? Put up Affronts that are offer'd us? And readily pass by Offences, when given us by any whomsoever? Do we owe such as wrong us in Body, Name, Estate, or Re∣latives, no ill Will? Do we not Maintain and Cherish a rancour of Spirit at them for it? And in no Wise insist
<PB N="15" REF="001661_0019_0FB4D92439CA4FC0"/>on OUR HONOUR, as a Motive to Vent it? Do we retain no Grudge against them therefor? — And when we speak of the Harm we receiv'd, and the Hurt that is done us by any, have we no evil Design therein against them? Is it with no Spirit of Revenge? No such Rash Desire of Satisfaction therefor? Nay, not allowedly in a Thought? — Or is it only offered by us, and mentio∣ned, as the Matter of our Grievance? As what nearly Affects and Afflicts us? — Do we in no Wise, tho' in our Power, requite 'em with Ill? Do we Designedly for∣bear Injuring them, when we can, either in Name, or Interest, Directly, or Remotely, in our own Persons, or by Proxy? 'Tis written, <HI>Avenge not your selves, but give place to Wrath; for Vengeance is mine, I will repay, SAITH THE LORD,</HI> Rom. 12.19. But rather do we return Friend∣ly and Religious Offices, Acts of Christian Love, and Kindness to them, as we can? Rom. 12.20. — Do we in our Prayers to God, sincerely ask, that His Bowels of Compassion might move towards them, for their Weak∣ness, or Wilfulness in Abusing, or Treating us Illy? Do we therein Petition, and from our Hearts desire, that the Divine Favour might be shewn them, and God's Mercy be Display'd and Magnify'd in Forgiving them, tho' they should pursue us with their Cursings, and Spiteful Usa∣ges? Do we take all Occasions to Serve them? Do we Embrace every Opportunity convenient to do them what Good we can? — And tho' we chuse not their Com∣pany, nor ever Embrace them as INTIMATES, yet, can we when Occasionally met, speak Kindly unto them? Do we Treat them Civilly, and Entertain them Heartily, with Christian Friendship? — This is but according to what Christ, our LORD and MASTER has taught us, As written in Matth. 5.44. <HI>Love your Enemies, Bless them that Curse you; Do Good to them that hate you, and Pray for them which Despitefully use you, and Persecute you.</HI> This (says He) will Evidence your being the Children of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 45. — <HI>If we</HI> thus <HI>Forgive Men their Trespasses, our Heavenly FATHER will also Forgive us,</HI> Matth. 6.14. So Luk. 6.39. <HI>Forgive, and ye shall be Forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Clear Evidence.</P>

<HI>VIII. Rule.</HI> When Prosperity Attends us, does it at∣tain Holy Ends upon us? Are we Thankful that <HI>God's Candle shines upon us?</HI> That <HI>the Secret of God is upon our Ta∣bernacle?</HI> Job 29.3, 4. Do we <HI>Rejoyce in the Lord</HI> herefor? Phil. 4.4. And in the Language of the Psalmist, say, Psal. 68.19. <HI>Blessed be the Lord, who Dayly Loadeth us with His Benefits, even the God of our Salvation.</HI> Are we not Puff't up with Pride by our Increase? Do we not use Violence? This is the Character of the Wicked, Psal. 73.6. But what we can, do we withstand, and avoid Temptations thereto? Are we not allowedly Lofty, but Humble in Speech and Behaviour? Are we careful to Improve such a Talent to God's Glory? Do we not take up our Satisfaction in uncertain Riches? Or rather do we Trust in the Living God, <HI>Who giveth us Richly all things to Enjoy,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.17. Do we not Convert the Affluence of good Things, we are Blest with by God, to our own private Use and Service only? Do we not appropri∣ate our Plenty to our particular Interest? Or rather do we <HI>Honour God with our Substance, with the First-fruits of all our Increase?</HI> Prov. 3.9. Do we chearfully distribute any part thereof to Publick, and Pious Uses? And are we free from doing it grudgingly, or of necessity? <HI>For God leveth a Chearful giver,</HI> 2 Cor. 9.7. Are we careful to abound in Works of Piety towards God, and Charity to∣wards Men? And do we design to be Rich in Good Works in some measure in proportion to what God doth Lend to, and Honour us with? Are our Hearts herein? Do we attend it from a Sense of our Duty, and not Eye the Applause, and Encomium's of Men, as our Motive therein? Do we in Obedience to Christ, Matth. 6 3.4 Chuse and Study Secrecy therein, that our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> may not <HI>know what</HI> our <HI>Right Hand doeth?</HI> Are our Hearts full of Grateful Resentments unto God therefor?

<HI>IX. Rule.</HI> Have Afflictions a Sanctify'd Influence, and Effect upon us? Do we see God's Hand therein? Do we own it to be most Just, and Holy? Do they put us upon a Strict Search after, and Enquiry into the Reasons of His Contending with us? Job 10.2. And do we Judge our selves before him? But Justify God in the Measures he taketh with us? Saying, as Written in Psal. 145.17. <HI>The Lord is Righteous in all His Wayes, and Holy,</HI> yea, Merciful <HI>in all His Works.</HI> Doth a Sense of God's Displeasure with us therein produce a true Contrition of Spirit in us? Doth it procure Brokenness of Heart, and fill us with profound Humility of Soul before Him for our Sins? Are we made the more Holy thereby? Do we find our Afflictions <HI>Yielding to us the Peaceable Fruits of Righteousness</HI> Heb. 12.10, 11. When we are Exercised with pressing Temptations, and sore Distressing Tryals, is this the Happy Fruit thereof, <HI>To Purge away our Iniquity, and take away our Sin?</HI> Isa. 27.9. Does it help us to make Advances in Holiness? Do our Losses, and Crosses make us more Humble and Submissive unto God? Are we Designedly Patient under Divine Corrections? Readily saying, as in I Sam. 3.18. <HI>'Tis the Lord, let him do what seemeth him Good.</HI> And again, Lam. 3.39. <HI>Why doth a Li∣ving Man Complain; A Man for the Punishment of his Sons.</HI> Do we thence Endeavour quietly to bear them? Do we in no Wise willingly, and allowedly <HI>Despise the Chastening of the Lord, nor Faint when we are Rebuked of him?</HI> Prov. 3.11. Do we thus Endure Chastening, desiring its continuance till we are made Spiritual Gainers by it, rather than its removal only for our Ease? Do we Learn Obedience thereby, and to be more <HI>in Subjection to the Father of Spi∣rits, that we may Live,</HI> Heb. 12.9. Do our Afflictive Ex∣ercises wean, and take us off from Creature Trust, and Dependance? Do we Learn, and see more of the Uncer∣tainty, and Vanity thereof by all? And are we brought thereby to Rowl our selves on God, and to Trust in Him as our only Satisfying Portion? Hab. 3.17, 18. Are we not led thence to a more Exact Conformity to His Word, that Transcript of the Divine Will, as the Rule of our
<PB N="18" REF="001661_0022_0FB4D928C803C200"/>Lives? Are we made more careful to Square all our Actions by it? Are we more Close Walkers with God by all? Thus was it with the Psalmist, Psal. 119.67. <HI>Before I was Afflicted, I went astray, but now</HI> (says he) <HI>have I kept thy Word.</HI> And will not this minister Comfort &amp; Satisfaction to us? Since God says, in Rev. 3.19. <HI>As many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten.</HI> So Heb. 12.6. <HI>Whom the Lord Loveth He Chasteneth, and Scourgeth every Son whom He receiveth.</HI> And do we not Rejoyce herein, and say with the Psal∣mist, Psal. 119.71. <HI>It is good for us, that we have been Afflicted, that we might Learn Thy Statutes.</HI> Do we hence Encourage our selves in God, and in a way of Gospel Obedience, wait for Him under all, hoping in His Mercy, through Christ, for His Salvation? Lam. 3.24, 25, 26. Rom. 8.18. <HI>I reckon</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>the Sufferings of this present Time, are not worthy to be Compared with the GLORY, that shall be Revealed in us.</HI> So 2 Cor. 4 17. <HI>Our light Affliction, which is but for a Moment, shall then work for us a far more Exceeding, and Eternal Weight of GLORY.</HI></P>

<P N="10"><HI>X. Rule.</HI> Are we Truly, and Evangelically Holy? Have we an Habit of Holiness in our Hearts, and have we Holy Actions Exhibiting it in Our Lives?

Does that Irresistably <HI>Constrain us?</HI> 2 Cor. 5.14. Does a Sense of the Divine Love to us, raise Grateful Resentments in our Souls? And cares thence to return a Chearful Obedience? Do we find in us a Love to God, and His Wayes? To Christ, and His Gospel Precepts? And do we delight our selves therein? Does not this then Argue a Divine Principle in us? 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We Love Him, because He first Loved us.</HI> Is not then our Love to God, a Fruit of His Eternal Love to us? Nay is it not a Clear, and Satis∣fying Manifestation of it? — Do we Act, as under God's Eye? Are we fearful of doing any thing Offen∣sive, and Displeasing to Him? Be we careful in all things not to Grieve Him? But to be Dutiful, and Obliging?
<PB N="19" REF="001661_0023_0FB4D92A464D3C48"/>Col. 1.10. <HI>Followers of God, as Dear Children,</HI> Eph. 5.1.

Phil. 3.8. On the Spirit of Grace to renew, and Sanctify us? 1 Cor. 6.11. To Furnish and Strengthen us to, and in every good Way, and Work? Yea, and to <HI>Seal us to the Day of Redemption?</HI> Eph 4.30. Do we seek the Honour that is from Above? Which only comes from God? Joh. 5.44. Do we design to give, and do God all the Honour we can? Do we pay Him the high∣est Respect, and Reverence? Do we Honour Him in our Hearts, and Lives? Have we High, and Holy Thoughts of God? And are we Humble, and Circumspect in our Walking before Him? Do we Eye God's Glory in all we do? Do we make that the Compass of our Thoughts, our Words, our Wayes, and Actions? Our Chief, our Last, our Highest End in All? Hereby we shall answer the End of our Creation, Preservation, and Redemption, by Christ our Saviour, 1 Tim. 1.15. &amp; 4.10. The Natural Son of the Eternal God, Col. 1.16, 17. &amp; Heb. 1.2, 3. 'Tis Written, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. <HI>Ye are not your own, for ye are Bought with a Price: Therefore Glorify God in your Body, and in your Spirit, which are God's.</HI> So 10.31. <HI>Whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> And by thus <HI>having our Fruit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holiness,</HI> we shall find <HI>the End Everlasting Life,</HI> Rom. 6.22. and in Psal. 50.23.
