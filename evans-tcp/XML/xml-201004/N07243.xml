<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N my last, of the 17th of December, published in the supplement to your Gazette N<SUP>o</SUP>. 1428, I promised you a copy of col. Grant's letter, wrote from Keehowee to our lieutenant-governor the 3d of July 1760; and that I would also endeavour to vindicate our Rangers from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nju∣rious treatment: my copy of this letter I now send you, and will be answerable for the exactness of it, as I compared it myself very carefully with the original laid before the assembly the 11th of July 1760, when I had the honour of a seat there. The observant reader of my former letter, might easily perceive it could not have been long about, from several matters contained therein; particularly general Amherst's let∣ter, taken from the London Gazette of the 19th of September, which arrived here but a day or two before its publication. The sight of col. Grant's insinuation against the Rangers, in the general's letter, with re∣spect to their behaviour in the first campaign, deter∣mined me to publish the colonel's second letter, not only in hopes of clearing these people, but, by doing so, of answering a still more material purpose that will be mentioned hereafter: this, and another of the 4th of June, were all the letters that were laid before the assembly from any regular officer that campaign: The last was published by authority, and why the
<PB N="4" REF="009243_0003_1030C8D283FD5108" MS="y"/>other was not too, has been often admired as; it was certainly expected at the time: however, as it was not, the insinuations therein, is we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l as the colonel's difficulties, were only laughed at, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the gentlemen that saw that letter. And as not one of the Rangers, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called to account by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the day of action, though he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and ought to have done it, the public was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> must have been irrepro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we find he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> revived that mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r himself and him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it to the genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too (which it was though▪ HE would have been ashamed of doing, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> letter was not published, his friends as I imagine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:) it has become too public not to be taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> notice of. This was not possible to be done in the short time between the arrival of the gaze <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the general's let∣ter and the colonel's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, as much of the old affair was forgot; besides, to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>collect it again, enquiries were to be made from many persons, some at a great distance, which necessarily took up time, and in the interim the colonel sailed for Martinique. Their vin∣dication was, at first, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I intended and thought sufficient to answer all my purposes; but, in doing that, I was led insensibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many other observations on the colonel's letters, and on the first c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aign that occasioned them; and, from thenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to make some remarks on the second, by which it will incidentally appear, whether the first was of any and what use to the second, as a matter of mere experience. Since these materials could not be got ready ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly enough for the colonel's entertainment b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore he left this place, it was thought immaterial when they were published, and therefore that I might take my own time to do the whole together, and introduce the affair of the <HI>Rangers</HI> in its most natural and proper place among my observations. This is the best reason I can give why you had them not before.</P>
<P>In the <HI>weekly Gazette</HI> of the 4th of June and 16th of July, are two letters from "THE CAMP" at Ninety-Six and Fort Prince George, dated the 27th
<PB N="5" REF="009243_0004_1030C8D5850366C8"/>of May, and 2d of July, 1760, the first of which furnishes only a few hints; the last seems calculated (notwithstanding its being dated the day before) to be explanatory of the colonel's last letter, in which manner it will be chiefly made use of. Whenever these letters are referred to, to avoid long repetitions, I beg leave to mention only the numbers of the gazettes they are contained in, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 81 and 87.</P>
<P>'Tis needless to say, how commendably and indus∣triously cautious the publisher of that paper h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s been, to prevent being in the least suspected of any prej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice against col. Grant: his many corrections, from time to time, of any and every thing <HI>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>evered</HI> to have es∣caped him, that might even <HI>seem</HI> to have the most distant tendency that way, sufficiently prove it (of which one instance will be men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly) and at the same time render any quotations from his gazettes the less liable to objection from the coloned; however<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall confine myself almost, if not altogether, to those let∣ters and now proceed, to shew upon what founda∣tion they stand.</P>
<P>In the paper N<SUP>o</SUP>. 80, immediately preceding the first letter, the publisher informs us, "<HI>as it is expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the advices from the army will henceforth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daily more and more interesting, the public are desired to observe, that ALL the intelligence published in this paper, and dated from</HI> the Camp, <HI>is from</HI> good <HI>authority, and may</HI> SAFELY <HI>be</HI> depended <HI>on; sometimes perhaps, reperts from or concerning the army may be mentioned, but the next succeeding advices from</HI> "the Camp," <HI>will confirm, correct, or contradict them.</HI>"</P>
<P>The authority of the second letter <HI>must be</HI> unex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep∣tionable, as, besides its standing equally with the first on the above foundation, being date<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from <HI>"the Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,"</HI> the publisher, in his paper of the 30th of July, has given it the following farther s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nction, "<HI>On saturday last arrived from the camp at Congarces, lieutenant colo∣nel Grant, by whom we have a confirmation of ALL the particulars of the action near Et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, contained in the letter in the first page of this paper of the 16th instan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excepting as to the quantity of corn found in Etch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,
<PB N="6" REF="009243_0005_1030C8D89B805438"/>which was there said to be</HI> 500 <HI>bushels; but the report of Mr. Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sox, the commissary, who is now here, under whose care the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn was put, is, that the quantity was not lest than</HI> 600 <HI>bushels, all which was destroyed, except what was made use of by the detachment, besides a quan∣tity of calav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> or Indian beans, between</HI> 80 <HI>and</HI> 100 <HI>bushels, and a great many large heaps of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn flour.</HI>"</P>
<P>This extraordinary letter the curious reader is desi∣red to compare throughout with the colonel's; to en∣able him so to do, notwithstanding its length, I must beg you'll give it a place next before his: indeed it would go very much against me to part them, as they seem so nearly related; the printed letter appear∣ing to be an excellent <HI>prophetical</HI> commentary on the other, and, as some think, wrote by the colonel him∣self, especially, since a passage in the postscript that seems to contradict this supposition, is declared to be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urious. This postscript I <HI>must</HI> beg leave to give the reader here (and is the only notice I intend to take of it) together with that important discovery made three weeks after it was printed; how <HI>necessarily,</HI> will soon be perceived, on comparing it with a passage or two in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onel's last letter.</P>
<P>"P.S. <HI>Col. Montgomery and col. Grant are well, but busy writing dispatches: They have both had some hair∣breadth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apes, as all of us had, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nothing: How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grant escaped their rifles is amazing, as he was the only man in the line of foot on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seback.

<P>The remark on this postscript, in the <HI>weekly Gazette</HI> of the 6th of August following, runs thus, <HI>"the pa∣ragraph in the second page of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paper of the 16th ult. relating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan, designed to
<PB N="7" REF="009243_0006_1030C8DBE3417B70"/>appear in a separate article, was inadvertently put as part of a postscript to the letter in the first pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the same paper; a mistake which a severe fit of sickness pre∣venting the usual and necessary attention is such matters, occasioned to pass unnoticed and uncorrected, which we hope the gentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> who favoured us with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> letter will excuse."</HI></P>
<P>Before I leave this matter, I would desire the reader to observe, that, excepting in this suspicious postscript, Col. M********Y is no where m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ioned, either di∣rectly or otherwise, throughout this very long and wonderful letter that col. Grant has so particularly a∣dopted. The reason of this observation you will soon discover.</P>
<P>As I shall make great use also of the colonel's first letter, dated from Keehowee the day after the success at the Lower-Settlements, published in both ga∣zettes, I must beg the favour of you to reprint that letter too, immediately after the letter N<SUP>o</SUP>. 81 from Ninety-Six, and both before the colonel's adopted and second letters, that gentlemen may, without the trouble of referring back to their old news-papers (which may perhaps be mislaid) be possessed, in an un∣prejudiced manner, of my <HI>principal</HI> authorities in one view, and thereby more easily judge, whether the quo∣tations and reasonings from thence are fair and to the purpose: but, 'tis necessary to observe here, that the two passages in the colonel's first letter, printed in <HI>italicks,</HI> were, at the time of its publication, suppressed, for obvious prudential reasons.</P>
<P>Referring my reader to my principal vouchers, the letters just mentioned, which will be printed at the end (especially to the three last) for all matters rela∣ting to the first campaign in 1760, let me here inform him, in a few words, that I shall endeavour to prove the following propositions:
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First.</HI> That col. Grant had the principal direction of the first campaign.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly.</HI> That he lost two fine opportunities that campaign, of relieving Fort Loudoun, and glo∣riously and effectually reducing the Cherokees.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="8" REF="009243_0007_1030C8DD81A16390"/>
<HI>Thirdly.</HI> That our Rangers did not deserve the cruel treatment they met with seem him — <HI>N.B.</HI> It will be necessary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew this, before we come to the second opportunity the colonel lost.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After these three propositions are discussed, I shall pass to the colonel's second camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign in 1761, in order, <HI>first,</HI> to discover, if the former was of any, and what, use to the second, as a matter of mere experience. And here it will be shewn.</P>
<P>That col. Grant remedied <HI>none</HI> of the matters he complained of in his first campaign; that his con∣duct glaringly demonstrates, his whole dependance was on the <HI>known</HI> cowardice of the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ians; for which and other reasons, he might have gone to the Valleys with ease, in the time he took <HI>before</HI> he returned to Keehowee, and several times afterwards. The situa∣tion the colonel has reduced us to with the Indians, will be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewn to be very shameful and precarious; and that he may be sent to us perhaps a third time to compleat his work, the consequence of which will be pointed at.</P>
<P>I am now, in the first place, to prove, from the colonel's letters, especially from the first, that he had the principal direction of the campaign in 1760; and consequently, that to him we and our posterity will be long indebted, in the highest degree, for the mighty wonderful seats done therein. This having bean of late made a question by some few, who, parti∣cularly since col. Grant favoured us with his last visit, have complimented col. M—y with it, makes it necessary to discuss it here in limine; and how can we decide this point better, than by the as∣sistance of these two letters, which were both laid be∣fore the legislature of the province, and the first prin∣ted by authority, the only one that was so during that campaign? Col. M —y, 'tis generally believed, had the THE NAME, which is not worth disputing about: but who <HI>assumed the</HI> THING is the question. It plainly appears then, by the first letter, beyond all contradiction, so much so, that it is needless to trou∣ble you with any quotations, that col. Grant thought
<PB N="9" REF="009243_0008_1030C8E36753BBD8"/>himself at least upon an <HI>equal</HI> footing with col. M— —y, from the share he claims of the merit in plan∣ning and ordering, as well as in executing the success∣ful enterprize there mentioned; which, though it is amazing to think, how he could <HI>aim</HI> at making it of half the importance <HI>he did,</HI> may be truly called a well∣conducted soldier-like transaction; the only one in both campaigns worth relating. In HIS supposed con∣sequences of it, in regard to the most essential object of the war, a Peace, does he not step still higher? when <HI>alone</HI> declaring, <HI>"the correction you will allow has been pretty severe; and I dare say, the whole nation will readily come into terms, and will not be very fond of breaking them; and I think peace with them is a desira∣ble event for this province;"</HI> which most improbable dare-say, that he takes so much care to assure his ho∣nour is peculiarly his own (for col. M—y's opi∣nion in this grand concern he is left to guess at) we find prevailed (by what immediately follows in that letter, which deserves the reader's particular attention) and undoubtedly occasioned the long unhappy delay at Fort Prince George, at that most critical juncture, when a moment's time ought not even to have been risqued. This in all probability was the great cause (as I shall endeavour to shew more at large by and by) of the loss of Fort Loudoun; the massacre of great part of the garrison; and of the lasting dishonour then <HI>brought upon</HI> his majesty's arms; together with the long tram of misfortunes and heavy taxes, entailed upon the province ever since, and for years to come, even supposing the Indians to continue quiet, which I am afraid I may in my turn "<HI>dare say" too</HI> they will not very long (should the French but have an opportuni∣ty of supplying them) even if we submit to pay for our people they have <HI>still</HI> prisoners amongst them.</P>
<P>To return from this digression, does not col Grant also assume a right of advising his honour, and corres∣ponding with him, when he says, <HI>"it will be necessary you should write a letter to encourage some of the Rangers to go to Fort Loudoun,"</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c and "I <HI>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be glad to hear from you as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssible,</HI>" &amp;c. Since we find
<PB N="10" REF="009243_0009_1030C8E68AA5D868"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in this and the last instance seizing and possessing himself of the most conspicuous station, the top of all, and thence viewing, judging and directing every thing around him, we cannot wish him nor he push himself h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; therefore 'tis time, on the other hand, to en∣qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a little after col. M—y; and here give me leave to ask, if there is one single passage in all that so important letter, where he is represented as transact∣ing <HI>alone</HI> any one thing, or even giving his opinion <HI>sepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately,</HI> relative to either war or peace with the Che∣rokees? is not the language throughout either, <HI>"col. M — y and</HI> I <HI>were convinced"—"were resolved,"</HI> &amp;c.—"WE <HI>shall make use of Tifto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI>"—"WE <HI>shall send off an express,</HI>"—or, "I <HI>informed you,</HI>"—"I <HI>dare say</HI>"—"I <HI>think,</HI>" &amp;c.—"I <HI>have been obliged to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd a guard</HI>"? Can this be the stile of one <HI>under command?</HI> Does it not rather plainly shew the contrary? As to the title to the printed letter, which belies the contents, any person may see how unnaturally it stands there: 'tis certain no such was to it when laid before the assembly, and how so apparently a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kward and in∣consistent an head-piece came to be tacked to it after∣wards, is not easily accounted for: surely, whoever did it, must not have read the letter, or he could ne∣ver have been drawn into so unlucky a mistake, to the prejudice of col. Gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s military fame, and per∣haps modesty too, with all who read that account, without the honour of knowing HIS so respectable abilities.</P>
<P>Part of the last clause in this letter, as some gentle∣men understand it, is too material to this question not to be quoted here, <HI>"Col. M—y desires his respects to you; he does not trouble you with a letter, as</HI> I <HI>have wrote so fully."</HI> Doubtless, this passage is in∣tended to make it <HI>appear</HI> the colonel saw this letter before it was sent; but I must beg to be excused for doubting that he did, from the <HI>cautious</HI> wording it, for it is not said that he did: however, if he did see it (as these gentlemen argue) and admitted col. Grant's right to make use of the remarkable expressions there∣in, it establishes, beyond all contradiction, the point
<PB N="11" REF="009243_0010_1030C8E84E4E23D0"/>com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded for. As to the letter col. M—y begs his honour to forward to general Amherst, nothing positive can be drawn from thence, to invalidate this matter, unless the contents were known, and known to be his, for it is not said whose letter it is, and it is not unlikely to be one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those several letters, which col. Grant takes so much pains to tell his honour he was <HI>"so fatigued in writing;"</HI> besides, many officers might have the honour of writing a letter to the general.</P>
<P>'Tis time now to see, what the second letter con∣tains relative to this point; but first, 'tis necessary to guard you not to lose sight of the subjects of each, which are of somewhat different complexions; the first, a pom∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s exaggerated account of an advantage gained over the Indians; the other, a most curious apology for an unaccountable retreat.—This clue will help you to dis∣cover col. Grant's admirable delicacy in one or two nice hints, and particularly in the following passage, the only one in either letter where col. M—y is even permitted to <HI>appear</HI> to have the <HI>sale</HI> direction, which he is honoured with just before <HI>"we stole a mare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon them in the night"</HI> to get <HI>safe</HI> back to Keeho∣wee! a most suspicious ill-favoured junc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> indeed! <HI>"in this situation"</HI> (we are told) <HI>"col. M—y thought it adviseable to return to Fort Prince George,"</HI> &amp;c. No <HI>I,</HI> no <HI>We</HI> here! what modesty! what self∣denial! When the action was a little more conspi∣cuous, as in a pretty little affair at the close of this letter, who but "I <HI>was obliged to march a company of light infantry into the fort to bring them to reason,</HI>" and in the first letter, "<HI>both col.

<P>Though I am apt to think there is some very mate∣rial mistake in representing the first and last of these actions (unless they are averaged, and col. M — y had the whole honour or the first allowed him by col. Grant, in order to rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him for what col Grant had before borrowed of him out of the last, if so, then to be sure this point is <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irly</HI> settled) as I have heard them related in a quite diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent manner, that this last was
<PB N="12" REF="009243_0011_1030C8EB8C36A5E0"/>the particular remarkable case, wherein col. M—y, for once, contrary to col. Grant's opinion, <HI>"resolved to take advantage of the Indians negligence,"</HI> &amp;c. and in the other situation, that col. Grant, contrary to col. M—y's judgment <HI>"thought it adviseable to return to Fort Prince George,"</HI> to which col. M—y as usual, but with great reluctance, consented, other∣wise the destruction of the Middle Settlements, per∣haps, would not have been deferred, to produce those glorious laurels reaped there the succeeding campaign, at least without trying a second <HI>"brush"</HI> with the Indians: and here I cannot help lamenting (supposing this to be true) how unfortunate it was for the province, that col. M—y, if he was <HI>clearly</HI> commander in chief, who had begun this campaign with so spirited and suc∣cessful a specimen of his judgment at Twelve-Mile creek, should ever afterwards, and most unhappily at Etchowih, give it up (begging col. Grant's pardon, with all his accomplishments) to an officer every way so manifestly <HI>beneath</HI> him.</P>
<P>If there can be any person unacquainted with any of the gentlemen that were on that campaign, who, not∣withstanding all that has been said, still remains dubious in this point, he is requested to compare the printed accounts of the two campaigns in 1760 and 1761 to∣gether; and the great similarity, or rather "SAME∣NESS" of the transactions, and miraculous relations of both, will, if any thing can, amply convince him, that none but one and the same great negotiating genius, ad∣mirably skilled in Indian politicks, presided throughout.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of this matter, as it appears, by these two letters and from other circumstances, that col. Grant had the greatest share in the direction of all the principal actions of this campaign, even in thinking <HI>"it adviseable to return to Fort Prince George"</HI> which his over-nice delicacy to col. M—y, to be sure, made him desirous to conceal; I shall therefore most readily concur with him, in giving him the credit of them all, excepting that which took its rise from Twelve-Mile creek, which he must pardon me, for the reason just now mentioned, for doubting of his
<PB N="13" REF="009243_0012_1030C8F187E656C0"/>right to any share in, unless in entirely marring the good effects of it, by that singular ill-timed <HI>"dare say"</HI> of his, which not only rendered that action altogether useless, but made it prejudicial too. Henceforward, when I speak of the colonel, without mentioning any name, I would be understood to mean col. GRANT, and him only.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to shew, that the colonel lost two fine opportunities in 1760, of relieving Fort Lou∣doun, and gloriously and effectually finishing the war with the Cherokees▪</P>
<P>The first and best opportunity of all was lost, by the ill judged unaccountable delays at Keehowee, after the surprize of the Lower Settlements: for, had a proper and speedy advantage been taken of the apprehensions those Indians were then undoubtedly under, the army might, immediately after that stroke, have run through all the towns in the nation, with little hazard, as the terror of it would have spread, faster than the troops could have marched, and they would have been in the midst of the Indian towns, one after another, in all probability, before the Cherokees could have had time to recollect themselves, and act properly in their own defence: besides this, the uncommonness of the thing, would have made a durable impression on those savages, and not unlikely on their abettors, the Creeks too, to the honour and dread of his majesty's arms for many gene∣rations, and the lasting security of this his province. This supposition col. Grant cannot possibly object to as improbable, because he has said, "<HI>we shall make use of Tistory, &amp;c. to inform their nation, that though they</HI> ARE IN OUR POWER, <HI>we are ready to</HI> GIVE <HI>them peace</HI>"? From this speech to our lieutenant governor too, whom surely he would not, for the good of his majesty's service and the safety of the province, endea∣vour to deceive, it plainly appears, he cannot deny this step to have been feasible. Now let us see if it was not absolutely necessary too. Had the attempt been made, and success crowned it, the utmost expectations and wishes of the people would have been thereby an∣swered, together with general Amherst's intentions,
<PB N="14" REF="009243_0013_1030C8F3240ECDF0"/>signified to our then governor, in the following words, <HI>"that at present the troops new in the province must solely pursue the ends they were sent for, viz. the most effectual punishment of the Cherokees and their abettor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>."</HI> —"<HI>So soon as that work</HI> is compleated, <HI>they must that instant come away;</HI>" their own declared designs would at the same time have been accomplished too [See N<SUP>o</SUP>. 81] "<HI>of throwing in a supply of flour, cattle, and other necessaries into Fort Prince George and</HI> FORT LOU∣DOUN," the latter then in <HI>a known</HI> miserable starving condition, as appeared from a letter, in the weekly gazette, from that garrison, by the express that passed through the camp (mentioned in letter 81) when at Ninety-Six, with dispatches dated from thence the 17th of May, at which time they, after <HI>"having bartered away every thing, even their shirts and blankets, yet had not five weeks provision left."</HI> Ought not every motive of honour, generosity and humanity too, to have concurred to excite a speedy endeavour to relieve those forlorn people, even if col. Grant had not de∣clared the nation to be "IN HIS POWER? but as he did, what could be his motive to hesitate? was there a moment to spare? Is it usual, when a garrison is redu∣ced to the last extremity, to desist from taking all ad∣vantages of an enemy, especially a savage one, when not only our friends liberties, but their lives too, were <HI>known</HI> to be at stake? why then were three weeks suffered <HI>un∣feelingly</HI> to be trifled away at Keehowee, for runners to go backwards and forwards upwards of 300 miles, by that means give some of the Rangers time and occasion to cool, be disgusted, and desert; our friendly Indians to leave us; and the Cherokees an opportunity to recover their spirits and despise us, to steal our horses, and col∣lect themselves together by calling in all their hunters? and, above all, to risque the lives of above 200 fellow-subjects at Fort Loudoun, then looked upon by the Indians as their <HI>certain</HI> prey? when, by col. Grant's largest accounts, we had but 40 Indian prisoners, and all of them, excepting two or three, women and chil∣dren (and the women they are known to regard very little) to insure our 200. Could it be thought, the
<PB N="15" REF="009243_0014_1030C8F4C4D32B20" MS="y"/>Cherokees were such fools, to let slip so fine and cri∣tical an opportunity of imposing upon us, <HI>given</HI> them by the colonel, and to make so stupid an exchange? give up the means of glutting their darling passion, re∣venge, and reduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s besides to what terms they almost pleased, then so evidently, for the sake of that garrison, <HI>just falling with it</HI> into their own power? Are not these natural and obvious arguments that must be sup∣posed to occur at the time? and if just, where then was the least shadow of a reason, to support that most improbable, preposterous, and presumptuous <HI>"dare-say,"</HI> the cause of so many and such lasting mischiefs and disgraces?</P>
<P>But here give me leave to observe, that though the expectations of the army's proceeding to Fort Lou∣doun were so general, as to be the subject of most conversations, especially after the troops left our back settlements, and the passage of a letter, just now quo∣ted, from the <HI>"the Camp"</HI> at Ninety-Six, confirm∣ed those designs, which had also reached the fort at Keehowee, where it was heard, that it was fully de∣termined to relieve Fort Loudoun, and they wished it might be done in time. I say, that notwithstanding this, it should be asserted so roundly, after the return from Etchowih, that the army never intended to go to Fort Loudoun at all, appears, amongst the many extraordinaries done and said, and <HI>unsaid</HI> at that time, al∣together the most extraordinary of all; especially when col. Grant says, in his first letter, "WE <HI>shall send off an express this evening to capt. Demere, &amp;c. to tell the Little-Carpenter, that he may come down with some other headmen, to treat; but that it must be done in a few days, or he may expect to see</HI> ALL <HI>the towns in the</HI> UPPER <HI>nation in ashes.</HI>" For God's sake, what could be the view of this cruel tantalizing message to that unfortunate gentleman? for such it must be, if never intended to be performed: what purpose could it answer but to throw him off his guard, by making him depend on relief (which he certainly did) that was never intended, and thereby prevent his making a push in time, before the strength of the garrison was
<PB N="16" REF="009243_0015_1030C8F827CDC220"/>too much exhausted by short allowance and bad pro∣visions? and farther, to make his majesty's arms appear still more contemptible to the Indians, by such despicable childish threats, mere gasconading! which I am sorry to say has been kept too steadily to ever since, and with just as much success.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the colonel says, "<HI>in</HI> MY OWN <HI>opinion, 'tis next to impossible for us to think of proceeding over the mountains; and if they had not been surprized, the very country we have been in was impractible, if they had spi∣rit,</HI> which <HI>I</HI> much doubt of." This is the first hint of any objection to go to Fort Loudoun, which was so new and surprizing to the assembly, that, in their answer to his honour the lieutenant-governor's congra∣tulatory message, sent them on the success at the Low∣er-Towns, together with the colonel's letter, they could not help joining with his honour in sentiments, and words too, that "<HI>that important event might be a means of restoring and establishing peace with the Indians upon a sure and lasting foundation,</HI> IF PROPERLY IM∣PROVED." These words of his honour, were then thought ominous, and to allude to the above expression of the colonel's.—How could the colonel, consistent with the above declaration, <HI>write to his honour, "the nation was in our power,"</HI> and threaten, if the upper Indians, or those <HI>"over the mountains"</HI> did not come <HI>"to treat,"</HI> to lay all <HI>"their towns in ashes"?</HI> or, how could he desire the governor <HI>"to encourage some of the Rangers to carry flour and cattle to Fort Loudoun"?</HI> Could part of the Rangers do, what was <HI>"next to im∣possible"</HI> for the whole army to do? I believe the colonel was, resolv'd indeed, not to proceed, <HI>"over the mountains;"</HI> and, that his <HI>"own opinion"</HI> SHOULD prevail, notwithstanding <HI>"he much doubted of the In∣dians spirit,"</HI> the only thing that could prevent him, —but more of this by and by.</P>
<P>If it was never intended to go <HI>"over the moun∣tains"</HI> to Fort Loudoun, what can be the pretence for not pushing immediately as far as was? the utmost expedition was required, as well to return to the ge∣neral, as to relieve that garrison; this would have
<PB N="17" REF="009243_0016_1030C8FE0C2EC640" MS="y"/>saved time at least, and added no little weight and authority to the express to the Little-Carpenter. If the messenger, together with Tiftowih and the Old-War∣rior of Estatowih, could have assured the upper nation, that the army set out with them, the Little Carpen∣ter would then have had something to work upon their fears, and urge them to secure the garrison for their friends, by laying them in immediately the corn re∣quired, which in all probability would have been done too, had the army marched with the messengers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'tis well known they were much frightened when they first heard of the troops destroying the Lower Towns: but when they had time and opportunity GIVEN them: to make use of evasions, was there room to expect any other? especially, as the army's unaccountable halting must certainly look suspicious, and give these wily people just reason to think (as 'tis <HI>known</HI> they did) that the colonel was afraid of proceeding further; and in the interim while they were amusing us, must not this suspicion, especially at that most critical junc∣ture, be a fine topic for their warriors to enlarge upon in their town-houses, to excite their nation to conti∣nue a resistance which that circumstance, and that ONLY, made so likely would terminate in their favour to the utmost of their most <HI>sanguine</HI> wishes?</P>
<P>I am very sorry to be obliged to acknowledge here, that the province did not, just at that time, properly consult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own safety, and act with that spirit it apparently has ever since. Of this the remarka∣ble regiment of 1000 men, so hastily voted for the 13th of February 1760, to be raised, paid, and dis∣charged again by the 1st of July following, is a very conspicuous instance. The members then met toge∣ther (only 21 besides the speaker) were divided in their opinions of the proper measures to be taken at that most critical juncture; ten were for agreeing with the committee, to provide for only 500 men, to proceed with some Rangers, to relieve Fort Prince George, at that time closely beset by the Indians; this the other eleven disagreed to: immediately after this, a motion was made and carried, to provide for
<PB N="18" REF="009243_0017_1030C8FFA2523970"/>1000 men; and in about ten res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves, one after ano∣ther, the pay of the officers and men was determined upon; but two more resolutions at the close, that the field officers pay should not commence 'till the regi∣ment was formed, nor that of the captains 'till they had raised half their men, together with no tents be∣ing allowed, bounty-money, or even present pay pro∣vided, effectually destroyed every thing that was car∣ried before: whether its being almost a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re house, or what else prevented that necessary matter being then properly and usefully designed, is difficult to say; however, this is certain, that the gentleman that made the motion was, the same evening, very sorry he had not joined the other ten, and so carried the 500 men only, which, 'tis not unlikely, would have been better en∣couraged and provided for: but, the end of his mo∣tion was, in order to relieve Fort Loudoun, which, in the message to the governor upon these matters, was THEN very rightly declared by the house, as <HI>"not to be done by the province in its present calamitous state,"</HI> for before that message was ordered to be drawn, when the two last res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves were carried, many gentle∣men thought not an hundred men of that regiment would ever be seen together, and so it proved. The small-pox then raging in Charles-Town, prevented the public business being carried on in a proper man∣ner, as considerably above half the members of the house, upon that account, were afraid of coming to town, which in all probability was the princi∣pal reason of matters being carried in that uncom∣mon manner at that time; for they no sooner met in larger numbers at the sorry, but every thing went in a prudent, proper, and spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited manner. Could that regiment have been raised, that, with the Rangers then provided for, would have been thought full suffi∣cient to have gone to Fort Loudoun. Most of those gentlemen that were for the regiment, were of opi∣nion general Amherst could not have been able to spare us any men, from that important campaign he was then engaged in, and therefore the matter seemed to depend on ourselves entirely▪ The other gentlemen
<PB N="19" REF="009243_0018_1030C902B004A5F8"/>flattered themselves he would, and were not disap∣pointed; indeed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of that scheme must have occasioned their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it must have been absolutely impossible for a gentleman of the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nth part of his excellence's penetration and judgment in military <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a copy of these extraordinary votes of the house were sent by governor L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>elton, to be a moment in suspence to give them their just weight, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at the same time convinced, how little we were acquainted, at that time, with the proper encouragement to raise troops; and the large detach∣ment of picked m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he sent us so immediately after∣wards, which he could very illy spare at that impor∣tant season, sufficiently shews his excellency placed NO dependance on the assembly's resolves in that matter, exclusive of the many difficulties he might ap∣prehend from the small-pox, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>known</HI> to be raging amongst us.</P>
<P>However, the same excuse may be pleaded, for this government's acting in this manner at this time, as has been pleaded by all the Northern provinces, when first in like circumstances; none of them (when under no providential distresses) took less time than Carolina to recollect themselves and act properly; the war was entered into only a few months before; time and ex∣perience had not then convinced us of our errors, and taught us to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll upon the properest expedients; indeed when the people did, so soon as August following, they proved to no purpose; but this was not the fault of <HI>the representatives</HI> of the province, who acted pro∣perly; not a moment's time was lost <HI>by them,</HI> after the troops returned from the Cherokee country; at that period, and ever since, <HI>they</HI> have acted with as much spirit as any assembly in America without ex∣ception.</P>
<P>When the troops arrived here, and marched into the Cherok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e country, an entire dependance was pla∣ced on them, that they would <HI>certainly</HI> do our business, as they were reckoned so <HI>fully</HI> sufficient, that all other expence to raise more men was thought absolutely needless. The army certainly <HI>"might have gone to
<PB N="20" REF="009243_0019_1030C90730162A58"/>any town in the nation,"</HI> as col. Grant himself, in his second letter, tells us, <HI>even after</HI> the action at Etchowih, or, in other words, might have gone through the na∣tion; no pretence of want of men there hinted at, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one of the causes of their return; but the impractabili∣ty of carrying their wounded with them: And that there was no complaint of this sort, when the army marched from Ninety-Six to the nation, appears by the letter dated from thence (N<SUP>o</SUP>. 81) which tells us 138 were LEFT, as scouting parties, to guard the back settlements, a service that might have been done according to law by the militia of the province; be∣sides, the settlers thereabouts would have chearfully done that <HI>safe and easy</HI> duty for the short time wanted, if those scouts could not have been spared. In short, more men would have been rather an incumbrance than of any service, and was thought so at the time, and I believe found so the year following, upon account of the additional number of waggons, &amp;c. that must have been got: besides, the same letter (N<SUP>o</SUP>. 81) also says, <HI>"it is but justice, to mention the hearty manner in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieutenant-governor has co-operated with us, without which we could not have been thus far advanced."</HI></P>
<P>Now it will be necessary, before we proceed to the second opportunity the colonel lost, to introduce a vindication of our Rangers, from his most severe re∣flections upon their conduct the day of action, in his letter to our governor.</P>
<P>This is the more readily undertaken, and particularly scrutinized, as I think the poltroonry that whole corps, and indeed all our people (excepting three captains) is accused of, an <HI>oblique</HI> reflection on the province: for whoever can suppose so considerable a sample arrant cowards, must imagine most of the rest only wanted opportunity to prove themselves so too; for it seems hinted, that capt. Morrison also, of our only company of provincials (not Rangers, as letter 87 calls him) might not have been killed "but <HI>he unfortunately was abandoned by his people.</HI>" The waggoners are inclu∣ded in the same condemnation with the Rangers; and even the poor guides, were, most of them <HI>"not worth
<PB N="21" REF="009243_0020_1030C90A36B49F98"/>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>illing,"</HI> or perhaps had some <HI>"little design."</HI> The charge against the Rangers is very heavy, "<HI>I think there was a waggoner and a Ranger killed, and five or six of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wounded: I am sorry that I cannot say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thing in their favour; they behaved</HI> most infamous∣ly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fifty deserted the night before we marched, and they run off to a man <HI>the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment they heard the firing begin,</HI> "excepting capts.

What pity this famous let∣ter had not been printed at the time; then no doubt this pretty stratagem must have taken. To this heavy accusation, let me add a passage of col. Grant's letter to general Amherst, upon his return to Keehower, after the notable exploits last summer, as taken from the London Gazette N<SUP>o</SUP>. 10140, alluding to this old affair "<HI>they</HI> [the Rangers] <HI>seem</HI> now <HI>to despise the In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, as much as they were</HI> susp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted <HI>to fear them</HI> be∣fore."

<P>I shall now, in the last place, endeavour to prove, that the <HI>Rangers,</HI> so far from behaving <HI>"most infa∣mously,"</HI> did not give the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st reason to be even <HI>"sus∣pected"</HI> of fearing the indians.

<P>Now let me proceed to the second opportunity the colonel, in all probability, lost, of effectually and glo∣riously finishing the war with the Cherokees, by his unnecessary return from Etchowih.</P>
<P>Here, though several very forcible arguments a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hominem might be drawn up, from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 40 dead bodies that he tells us, six days after the action, so grave∣ly and positively, without any restriction whatever,

Does he not farther represent the place of action, where this trouble hap∣pened, as having passes, <HI>"the Indians had taken pos∣session of every pass"?</HI> Were not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n these at least, some of the passes that the night march was to avoid? If so, is there any probability of any party's being so owl-eyed as to discover these three holes? farther, who, the least acquainted with the Indians customs, can think, that they would leave their friends bodies so exposed, upon so suspicious a place as the field of battle, for above two days; when, at six miles distance from the army, they had so many fine opportunities, during that time, of carrying them off, at least of burying them, when they took the pains to throw them into holes? and if they were buried, as letter 87 says "<HI>the next day</HI> (the 28th) <HI>the Indians went to bury their dead, and they scratched up ours and left them above ground;</HI>" is it credible, that any man would wait to dig them up and count them, when 'tis well known the army marched that night, and the succeeding day, to their old camp near War-Woman's creek, which, accor∣ding to the same letter, is 30 miles? What time, in this case, had any party, supposing them equipped with spades, if not, with long nails, to be so dangerously curious? If there was a party, who was the officer?
<PB N="31" REF="009243_0030_1030C927D0939760"/>If a single person was so hardy, what was his name and character? These were questions often asked, by numbers of gentlemen of the assembly, besides others, when the army returned, especially when it became ne∣cessary to scrutinize into the particulars of the colonel's letters, to take off that fatal influence they had upon too many (which I pointed out in my last) who could not think any gentleman that regarded his character, and especially one that bore so considerable a commission in his majesty's service, would attempt to assert any thing so roundly, of such consequence too, that he could not support: But, notwithstanding this strict enquiry, by such numbers, neither the party, nor a single man of any character, could ever be named, that saw this re∣markable phoenomenon, though from the colonel's own words <HI>"were found"</HI> and those of his adopted letter N<SUP>o</SUP>. 87 <HI>"we had occasion to see,"</HI> &amp;c. this must be thought to be a notorious and general fact, that every man in the army knew, or might know, the certainty of.</P>
<P>Now, though I despised taking any advantage, to prove the point before us, from the last article, which is given up as altogether fabulous; yet the colonel must not be allowed to take any, in his marvellous ac∣count of the wounded, represented to be, <HI>every one</HI> of them, in a terrible condition, beyond probability: in∣deed, it may be called a traveller's letter altogether, for not one thing in the ordinary way happened to this gentleman during that campaign. The return referred to in letter N<SUP>o</SUP>. 87, tells us, there were 20 killed and 77 wounded, 67 rank and file, 1 drummer, 1 serjeant, Mr. Monro, surgeon's mate, and 7 commission offi∣cers, viz. ensign Eddington, and capt. Peter Gordon, of the Royals; capt. Sutherland, lieut. McMartin and lieut. McKinnon, of the Highlanders; lieut. Tatnal, of the provincials; and capt. Farrel, of the waggoners. This account corresponds better with the colonel's <HI>"above sixty men,"</HI> than it does with his <HI>"many officers;"</HI> however, that's a trifle. What I would chiefly observe, is, that of the eight gentlemen here named, only the two first were disabled, the rest very
<PB N="32" REF="009243_0031_1030C92968567E08"/>slightly hurt, Mr. McMartin and Mr. Tatnal the most; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certain the whole six thought nothing of it. Now, if out of eight officers <HI>named,</HI> we find only two, that is, the fourth part of them, much hurt, after being told too, that "none <HI>of them can walk,</HI> every one <HI>of them must have an attendant:</HI>" Have we not occasion to suspect, from thence; from the <HI>story</HI> of the dead bodies; and that of the Rangers (wherein <HI>"I am sorry that I cannot say any thing in"</HI> his <HI>"favour,"</HI> and it would be too indelicate to say he <HI>"behaved most infamously"</HI> to them; that the remainder of the woun∣ded, returned by the lump, were not in a worse con∣dition in proportion, especially as it is well known, that not more than 3 or 4 at most died before the ar∣my reached the Congarees: indeed I have been in∣formed, by those that were in the action, by some, that not above a dozen, by others, not exceeding 20 at furthest, were so badly off as the colonel represents, however, let us allow 27 were, and that the other 50, if left in a good post, would have been able to give their assistance, <HI>only</HI> to defend it if attacked, which that they ought to have been I shall attempt to shew presently.</P>
<P>Enough has been said already to prove <HI>"the Ran∣gers are much diminished"</HI> ought not to have been lugged in here as one of the causes of this famous <HI>re∣turn,</HI> for <HI>"they run off to a man"</HI> he told us before: but if he intends those that deserted at Keehowee, what is meant by <HI>"some of their horses were employed in carrying flour"?</HI> dild they go without their horses? so far from it, his darling letter N<SUP>o</SUP>. 87 tells us, <HI>"they deserted with not only their own, but a great many m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e:"</HI> We are told farther, that <HI>"others"</HI> (which? horses?) <HI>"not very fond of walking;"</HI> why were they not whipped then? no switches at hand? hard indeed! If the men are meant, I agree entirely with the colonel; I believe they were not a little out of humour, to re∣turn to their friends to be certainly laughed at; but if they had been ordered to face to the right about, it would perhaps have made them happy, and as <HI>"fond of walking"</HI> as any of the rest: I wish they had been tried.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="009243_0032_1030C92F48BC4460"/>
Now, Sir, the mist being so far cleared away, as to enable us to discern things a little more in then na∣tural proportions, let us return to our point, and en∣quire, whether the actual condition of the army at this time at Etchowih, only 20 killed, 27 at most disabled, and 50 slightly hurt, made it adviseable for the colo∣nel, merely out of compassion for the wounded, to <HI>return;</HI> not run off, by no means, my gentle render, think so; none but Rangers act so <HI>"most infamously"</HI> as that: The colonel, he, truly, at midnight (N<SUP>o</SUP>. 87) <HI>"(leaving the huts standing and fires burning.)"</HI> "STOLE" away, very <HI>quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and slowly,</HI> ONLY 30 miles! not a step farther, before he camp'd; <HI>so ease and gentle</HI> a march in that <HI>smooth level</HI> country, could not <HI>possibly</HI> you know <HI>even disturb,</HI> much less <HI>distress</HI> the wounded; besides, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> astonishing effect this inconceivable piece of <HI>smart</HI> generalship must have had upon the savages! In short, this warlike stratagem, equally surprized all sides. The Indians were as sur∣prized in the morning, to find the troops were on their march back, as <HI>they,</HI> it is well known, were <HI>and</HI> surprized at midnight, with such marching orders; and the whole province was surprized at the reasons given, after so many and so great encouragements that the colonel, by his own accounts, appears to have had to proceed. Could it be expected, to penetrate into the Cherokee country without one general <HI>"brush,"</HI> even before, and much less after, the suspicious and shameful delays at Keehowee, which served no pur∣pose but to instil a mechanical unknown courage into the Indians, by finding their continual insults tamely (and as THEY said) <HI>not warrier-like</HI> borne by the co∣lonel? After so many incitements for the Indians to stand one general <HI>"brush,"</HI> could it be expected to lose fewer men than he did? Did the colonel think there would be no wounded? If he thought otherwise, why did not HIS insuperable difficulties, about them, prevail at Keehowee, and prevent his marching from thence at all? He tells us himself, <HI>"we might have gone to any town in the nation;"</HI> and who doubts it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> why did he not go then? <HI>"it was absolutely impracti∣cable
<PB N="34" REF="009243_0033_1030C932B181CC30"/>to proceed with the wounded."</HI> Why was not a post fixed, to secure them? He no where gives us the reason; and does not venture to say <HI>openly</HI> himself, that he had not men enough to spare, for that purpose: however, as he says so through his adopted letter (87) let us quote that entire curious passage here, "<HI>the towns of the Middle-Settlements, satisfied by this time that they could not obstruct our progress, had nothing for it but to carry</HI> every thing <HI>away; and our number of wound∣ed made it</HI> IMPRACTICABLE" (his own word) "<HI>to carry them farther: we had no</HI> FORT <HI>to lodge them in, nor could we</HI> SPARE <HI>a detachment to cover them; hu∣manity could not allow of their being left a sacrifice, for the sake of burning a parcel of empty houses.</HI>" Here, Sir, the whole difficulty, that occasioned this famous <HI>return,</HI> is said to be, the want of <HI>forts,</HI> and want of <HI>spare</HI> men to cover the wounded. Did not capt. Pe∣ter Gordon <HI>glaringly</HI> shew, how easily both these pre∣tences might be obviated? Did not that brave officer, from the best post he could FIND, beat off the diffe∣rent attacks of "THE INDIANS," repeated for so many hours, notwithstanding he was then so hampered with such a number of pack-horses <HI>before,</HI> and cattle <HI>behind?</HI> And did he not do it effectually, so as to save "EVERY THING;" not so much as (87) <HI>"a bag of flour lost by the enemy, or a bullock."</HI> Is not this a KNOWN and <HI>allowed</HI> fact, that capt. Gordon did so? If he had not, I don't know what the colonel would have done for his breakfast next morning, or his troops either, unless their knapsacks were full; but perhaps he would rather have gone without, to have had a better excuse for returning. The leaving the cattle and pack-horses <HI>six miles behind</HI> him, for <HI>so many hours,</HI> looks a little suspicious; especially after he had wrote from Keehowee, "<HI>in</HI> MY OWN <HI>opi∣nion, 'tis next to impossible, for us to proceed over the mountains,</HI>" and seems, as if he was determined, to make <HI>his</HI> opinion good. What else can account for such conduct? If two hundred men, which were the most that capt. Gordon had with him, including pro∣vincials, Rangers, packhorse-men, &amp;c. could, from
<PB N="35" REF="009243_0034_1030C935BAD09460"/>the best post they could <HI>find,</HI> or rather <HI>no post at all,</HI> defend themselves so long <HI>"and save every thing,"</HI> what danger could there be, when a post might have been CHOSEN OUT, intrenched and stockaded, in little time and with ease, of a few men, <HI>free from all incum∣brances,</HI> defending the wounded from any attacks whatever of the Indians? Would not their feeble at∣tempts, so far from being dreaded, been laughed at? Were Indians alone ever known to attack the slightest stockade or entrenchment by assault, much less the cowardly Cherokees? Might not what materials the ruined houses did not supply have been easily furnished from the neighbouring woods? Would not this have eased the wounded greatly, supposing they had been left at Etchowih, where, by the colonel's corrected account of letter 87, there were provisions full sufficient for these people, without taking any from the army, ex∣cepting a little beef, for a change? Though it would perhaps have been rather more spirited, and answered several good purposes, to have carried the wounded with them one very easy march more (not <HI>even</HI> 30 miles) or a second, if they were not attacked in the first, and then left them in a post: Would not 20 men, be∣sides the 50 that were so slightly hurt, with a few ri∣fles from the Rangers or provincials, been fully suffi∣cient for this purpose? besides, carrying the disabled a march or two, might have deceived the Indians, and made them conjecture, this post was more for the tired men, or other purposes, than entirely with a de∣sign to secure the wounded. Is there any reason to think the colonel might not have taken these steps, and proceeded as far at least as he did the second cam∣paign, but that he did not try? And did not every motive, that could possibly actuate the mind of a man of honour, urgently press the experiment at that time, even supposing the risque had been much greater? Was he not convinced his enemies were contemptible? Were not the full 1180 regulars, rank and file, he had with him, including serjeants, equal to any in his ma∣jesty's service? Did they shew any signs of fear? on the contrary, does he not tell us, <HI>"the troops behaved
<PB N="36" REF="009243_0035_1030C93755C3C700"/>remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>"?</HI> and had he not 270, rank and file, of Rangers, and provincials besides, exclusive of pack∣horse-men and guides? Was he not acquainted, at Ninety Six, with the <HI>"very disagreeable news from the Greeks"</HI> (8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) who had just murdered many of our tra∣ders, and seemed to wait only the event of that expedi∣tion to break out entirely against us? Did not this point out the necessity of striking some blow, to inti∣midate those Indians, and make them give us satisfac∣tion? Is it not wholly owing to the want of such a blow, at that time, that we were obliged tam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to put up with so many murders of our fellow-subjects, by these wretches, in cool blood, without daring ever since to resent them? Did he not recollect too, that the honour of his majesty's arms was at stake, when he <HI>silly</HI> stole that surprizing march in the night, which though the Indians might admire, as the monkey did the wonderful feats of the rope-dancer, as very smart indeed <HI>considering who did them,</HI> yet might they not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me reason as pug had, to think, they were <HI>nothing</HI> to what <HI>they could perform themselves,</HI> and therefore be plumed on <HI>thus discovering their own supe∣riority?</HI> Besides these strong motives, where was his compassion that we have been told so much of, and which alone induced him to return? Was it all con∣fined to his own wounded? Had he no fellow feeling for our back-settlers; no bowels for the poor distres∣sed garrison of Fort Loudoun, whom he had <HI>deceived</HI> too by tantalizing them with expectations of relief? Had the 200 poor souls cooped up in that sort, any the least chance to escape the butchering <HI>"hands of the savages"</HI> but by his assistance? Was he not acquain∣ted, before the march from Keehowee, there could be no hopes from Virginia? an express having arrived at Charles Town from thence 13 days before, then bring∣ing accounts, that only the 24th of the preceding month (May) the assembly of that colony had passed an act to make provision for 700 men; which it could not possibly be expected, could be raised, armed, sup∣plied with carriages and provisions, and march, time enough to save that garrison.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009243_0036_1030C93A57586120"/>
But all these motives of encouragement, honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, humanity, and necessity, united together, we find were not sufficient, to prevail with the colonel, after one general <HI>"brush"</HI> with the Indians, and that a successful one too, to march on; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s surprizing, that such an adept in Indian matters should not recollect, that no people under the sun are more remarkable than Indians, especially the cowardly Cherokees, for never rallying again, in a large body, if once routed; had he thought of this, he might have expected to have proceeded without interruption, but then, that would have been acting contrary to <HI>"his own"</HI> FIRST <HI>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian."</HI> Is it not a most mortifying aggravation, to be told, at this most calamitous juncture, <HI>"we have succeeded in every thing we have attempted; the In∣dians have been best every where; they never had the smallest advantage:"—"The Indians will not forget this attack sorn."</HI> What does the colonel mean? Was he sneering at our distresses; letting us know, that he could have answered the general's intentions, and as∣sifted us, but would not? Upon the whole, may not every man see, <HI>the troops</HI> could not be seized with a pannic? and I don't believe there is a man in the pro∣vince thinks <HI>they</HI> were. What then could be the co∣lonel's inducement to return at <HI>any rate?</HI> Was his honour offended at the provoking officiousness of the printers, or others, who had so publickly contradicted his first letter to our governor, by their impertinent title? Did this therefore <HI>oblige</HI> him to think another expedition <HI>absolutely necessary,</HI> where he might have the NAME also, the only thing this then <HI>acting</HI> lieutenant colonel wanted, to make a <HI>complete</HI> commander in chief, and, by an <HI>appare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> conquest, GAIN ALL to himself: and that he was not without expectations of returning again, may be gathered, from his being <HI>beard</HI> to tell some gentlemen, before he went aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that <HI>"it was mere th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> probable, he should return to Carolina again, before Christmas;"</HI> about which time to accord∣ingly did return, not only a <HI>real</HI> lieutenant-colonel of his majesty's 40th regiment, obtained in the interim (by his merits perhaps <HI>in painting</HI>) at New-York, but an ex∣traordinary
<PB N="38" REF="009243_0037_1030C940AEB751F0"/>commander in chief besides: but these cir∣cumstances, however strong, to be sure, cannot, and ought not to be expected to have any weight, against a gentleman so extremely remarkable for his delicacy, candour, and tenderness for the reputation of others.</P>
<P>If general Amherst's orders were so contrary (which is hardly credible) to his declaration to his honour the lieutenant governor, why did not the troops imme∣diately return after the surprize of the Lower Towns, without a moment's loss of time? It would certainly have been less prejudicial to have done so, and looked like dispatch, and not improbably have answered all the purposes those forces were sent for; the general's, by rejoining him early enough to be of service upon that most important campaign he was then engaged in; and ours, by the mischief being done so suddenly and unexpectedly, and the troops immediately vanishing, having such a strong resemblance to the Indians own manner of fighting, which they dread <HI>indeed,</HI> that they might not unlikely, through apprehensions of such an∣other dreadful and unlook'd for visit in a different quar∣ter, have been so intimidated as to give us the satisfaction we wanted. 'Tis surprizing this had no weight with the colonel, one so <HI>thoroughly versed</HI> in Indian matters! As the affair was managed, that large detachment was not of the least service any where that campaign; for it joined the general (as was before supposed it would) too late; when his glorious business was compleated; though the troops were uncommonly fortunate, for the time of year, in getting expeditiously over the bar, and in having an unusual fine passage to New-York. To us indeed, the army may be said to have been of prejudice, for the stroke at the lower settle∣ments, though a fine one for a beginning, losing all its favourable weight, by the <HI>suspicious</HI> delays at Kee∣howee, and the <HI>lamentable</HI> retreat from Etchowih that presently followed, served only to exasperate those Indians the more, which was, very soon after, woe∣fully experienced by our back settlers: And our re∣presentatives in assembly, as soon as they were infor∣med the troops were on their march back, were so
<PB N="39" REF="009243_0038_1030C9424C0DF000" MS="y"/>much alarmed threat, as immediately to <HI>address</HI> the lieutenant-governor, and represent to him, "<HI>that they apprehended the province to be in a much more dangerous situation, at this juncture</HI> (11th of July) <HI>than at the time the troops arrived here.</HI>"</P>
<P>Amongst so many scarce plausible excuses that the colonel makes for his RETURN, as he calls it, is it not surprizing, that the only short and sufficient one (had it been true) should not be so much as once hinted, throughout this curious apologetical letter; I mean that which was verbally propagated, with so much industry, when the colonel, several days before the army, made his appearance amongst us, that the troops were <HI>obliged</HI> to come away as they did, and that it was <HI>never intended</HI> to go to Fort Loudoun at all. <HI>Had</HI> experience shewn it to be safer and easier, after such reports had answered their <HI>intended</HI> purposes, to unsay an hundred of them, ever so universally spread, rather than one unguarded assertion expressed in writing?</P>
<P>Though almost endless reflections might be made here, on the colonel's letters relating to this campaign; yet I shall conclude this head, with only one or two observations more, and then pass to the next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> First then, let me ask, how the colonel came to know, "<HI>that there was not an Indian within</HI> 60 <HI>miles of the fort; the frontier is</HI> therefore <HI>much advanced</HI>"? Was his camp near War-Woman's creek half that distance? Did he not march to this camp the first day, upon his return from Etchowih? And does he not tell us, <HI>"the Indians gave us no trouble the first day's march"?</HI> And were they not so complaisant, <HI>"the second, that they intended to entertain us in a very strong pass"?</HI> Indeed, if they had not waited on the colonel so far, they must have been very nimble the next day after he marched from Keehowee, to have had it in their power to resent the contempt he had shewn their <HI>intended entertainment,</HI> by killing and scalp∣ing one Jefferson, a Buff soldier, in sight of Fort Prince-George: This is a <HI>known</HI> fact, and publickly mentioned at the time, though as publickly <HI>unsaid</HI> a∣gain,
<PB N="40" REF="009243_0039_1030C943E4B527E0" MS="y"/>and that in the <HI>same</HI> paper too that informed us, a week or two afterwards, of the colonel's return to Charics-Town, which he did, on <HI>particular</HI> business, some days before the army reimbarked.</P>
<P>How will the colonel clear the following passage of a glaring contraction, not to say imposition. <HI>"'Tis really unlucky, that a peace could not be brought about; we have succeeded in every thing we have attempted:"</HI> Was not this peace attempted? What else made him halt three shameful weeks at Keehowee, before he marched?</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to make some remarks on the second campaign, in 1761: in order, amongst other things, to discover, if the first was of any, and what use, to the second, as a matter of mere experience.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, I must acknowledge myself extremely puzzled, to find out any improvement made in the second, upon the first campaign, notwithstanding the colonel was so many months appointed to the com∣mand before he took the field. The marches were certainly much more slow and tedious now than be∣fore, and excepting that the pack horses were divided into brigades, and these severally interspersed, and guarded by the different corps, a general <HI>sameness</HI> ap∣parently runs through both, This <HI>"disposition"</HI> the colonel tells us, <HI>"was right in the country we were to act in,"</HI> and to be sure it <HI>must</HI> be so; otherwise, were it not too presumptuous, one would be apt to think that disposition was more <HI>rightly</HI> calculated for the <HI>peo∣ple</HI> he was to act <HI>against,</HI> than for the <HI>country</HI> he was to act <HI>in;</HI> and nothing can more evidently <HI>demonstrate,</HI> that the colonel's chief dependance, <HI>from the very be∣ginning,</HI> was, on the <HI>known</HI> cowardice of the Indians, than his setting out with <HI>this order of march;</HI> for had they suddenly and vigorously attacked any one corps, might not that have been cut to pieces before the next saw its danger, or if it did, could have come to its as∣sistance in time, when itself was so encumbered with two or three brigades of provision-horses, besides batt horses, between it and the other.</P>
<P>From the complaints in 1760, for want of posts and
<PB N="41" REF="009243_0040_1030C9486836FBA0"/>spare men, it might have been reasonably imagined, that the colonel would, as he had it in his power, have remedied those HIS then insuperable difficulties, for sure∣ly HE could not pretend to be any stranger, either to the Indians want of spirit, way of fighting, or na∣tural advantages of situation, after he had before (87) "<HI>penetrated into their country, in spight of the uni∣ted force of lower, middle, and upper Cherokees, I mean such as were disposed for war, which most of them were, excepting a few old men:—and what is equal to forcing our way to their town and destroying them, have returned and carried a large train of wounded men, sixty miles at least, through</HI> the most hazardous country in the world, <HI>in</HI> spight <HI>of</HI> all <HI>their efforts to distress us.</HI>" If any dif∣ficulty still occurred to him, had he not time and op∣portunity to get abundant satisfaction, while in Charles-Town and in our settlements, regarding the situation, distance, number of warriors and houses, &amp;c. of every town in the nation; and to provide himself with ho∣nest intelligent guides, void of any <HI>"little design,"</HI> and worth more then <HI>"a shilling"?</HI> Is it not rea∣sonable to think, this <HI>experienced</HI> officer, so well ac∣quainted with every thing that could be necessary for the campaign, would take care to provide accordingly? especially, when he had so much time, and might have taken <HI>much more</HI> if he thought proper, as there was no necessity for taking the field so early as he did.</P>
<P>Supposing him thus furnished with every thing ne∣cessary, for it would be a reflection on his military ca∣pacity to think otherwise, we will endeavour to see, presently, if with the troops he had when he marched from Keehowee, whether he might not have gone to the Valleys at least.</P>
<P>Might it not, I say, have been expected, that the colonel would certainly have fixed posts as he went a∣long, to secure the wounded, which we were told, <HI>"in a remote frontier is a distressing circumstance,"</HI> and <HI>"it was absolutely impracticable to proceed with them," "nor could we spare a detachment to cover them."</HI> (87) Were there any complaints for want of men this last summer, or any other assistance whatever? Were not
<PB N="42" REF="009243_0041_1030C94CDDA2C2F0" MS="y"/>about 50 negroes, at <HI>his own request,</HI> furnished him, <HI>particularly for this purpose;</HI> as appears by his honour the lieutenant governor's message to the assembly, da∣ted the 2d of April last? "<HI>Cal. Grant, same days be∣fore be marched out of town, represented to me, that in order to penetrate into the midst of the Cherckes towne, through their mountainous country, with the more success, and with as much safety as possible to the troeps, he pro∣pesed to</HI> secure <HI>his communication with Fort Prince-George, by establishing</HI> posts <HI>as he advanced, where he might</HI> lodge <HI>his wounded, sick, and his provisions; there∣fore he thought it necessary, that I should assist him with about</HI> 50 <HI>able negrae men expert in the use of axes and spades.—I thought it reasonable to consent thereto, and desire you to make provision for the same.</HI>"—Notwith∣standing he had these negroes, was any communica∣tion secured with Fort Prince George; any post esta∣blished at all, excepting he four days 913 men, with the wounded, &amp;c. halted at Cowhih, while the colo∣nel went with 1448 rank and file to Stickowih branch; were they not lugged about every where else with the army, for thirty days, from the action near Etchowih until its return to K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>owee? Does not this shew the tenderness for the wounded in 1760 a mere pretence? Does it not also plainly shew, that the colonel was de∣termined to aval himself of them this campaign, in an indirect manner, by unnecessarily, though ingeriously and over carefully, carrying them every where with him, that they might unobservedly retard the march, fatigue the men with carrying them, and give a colour to such laboriously dilatory proceedings?</P>
<P>The colonel told us in 1760, <HI>"destroying an Indian town may be creditable, but 'tis in fact a matter of no great consequence, when the savages have time to carry off their effects;—we might have gone to any town in the na∣tion"</HI> but "<HI>then we should have found it, or indeed rather them all, abandoned."</HI> 'Tis true, the corn-fields were destroyed last summer, as far as the colonel went; but would not these have been abandoned too the year be∣fore as well as the houses, and therefore as <HI>easily</HI> de∣stroyed? Did they not carry off their effects last year?
<PB N="43" REF="009243_0042_1030C94E732B8C60"/>If they had not, would it have been much matter? Ex∣cepting a few pieces of gold, or perhaps a watch or two, that some of them might have got from the Fort Lou∣doun officers, or others they murdered, I believe <HI>"their most valachle effects"</HI> and the "<HI>every thing that might have been left in their houses, which you</HI> may believe <HI>would not</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scape," would have consisted in a few deer-skins, some paint, beads, and a few strings of wampum. It would very much o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge the curious, and no doubt highly entertain them besides, if the co∣lonel would be kind enough to publish an account of the Cherokee moveables, in his own fine picturesque manner.</P>
<P>From the extraordinary risques the colonel run of his own character, and the pains he and his friends took <HI>in one thousand seven hundred and sixty,</HI> to MAKE us believe "<HI>the Indians would not forget that attack soon —they lost at least</HI> 50 <HI>men,</HI>" &amp;c. it appears plain, that he knew, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the assembly, what WOULD please us, what WOULD distress the Indians INDEED, destroy∣ing them whereever they were met with, the only thing that can: Is it not surprizing then, that notwithstanding this, the colonel should still go on in the old road, and be kind enough to give his friends the Cherokees as little trouble as possible? Why else was not a commission officer sent to major Thomson, in the last action near Etchowih, with that most interesting order <HI>"to go to the left, behind the hills, and endeavour to get in the rear of the enemy"?</HI> Was not a commission officer sent with all the other orders of little moment to that most important one; this, upon which so much depended, must be trusted, truly, to a nameless blundering ser∣jeant of the Rangers? Was it this same nameless blockhead, that found the 40 dead bodies in the three different holes the year before? If it was, it is highly necessary the colonel should tell his name, and be <HI>so far</HI> cleared of <HI>entirely</HI> inventing that <HI>story</HI> himself. We were also told the first campaign <HI>"we might have gone to any town in the nation."</HI> It was not doubted then; and the last summer's exploits have demonstra∣ted, that he might. What hindered him in 1760?
<PB N="44" REF="009243_0043_1030C9500DC86D58" MS="y"/>why <HI>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should have had a brush to get at it,"</HI> &amp;c. Have we not the greatest reason to think, that, had the colonel only then made the experiment, and pro∣ceeded one march farther, that he would have had rea∣son to think himself mistaken, and to expect no more interruption the first than he had last year? After the general brush the 10th of June last, did the colonel meet with the least opposition afterwards? Excepting one indiscreet waggoner, who was shot by a few scul∣king warriors as be was going with a torch in his hand in the night to get water, the army, or any party, not even the straggling packhorse-men, who were sometimes, only two or three together, a mile or two from the camp, looking for their horses, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not so much as fired at, 'till he returned to Keehowee. What did the colonel chiefly depend on this last campaign? Was it not on the KNOWN cowardice and ignorance of the Indians? What excuse but that, could be have had, for that otherwise most rash enterprize to the towns on Stickowih branch, supposing an unexpected miscarriage had happened; and would not that have been a good and sufficient plez with all the candid? Had he not had numerous instances to confirm him, that their general national character was justly fixed, as being abjectly pusillanimous to the last degree? What signifies fortifications, natural or artificial, if the people are known not to have spirit or skill to defend them? Was not the rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to Stickowih branch so difficult, that the men and horses, many of them, could not keep their feet, but were frequently tum∣bling down? I am informed, by many of the gentle∣men who were there, and have favoured me with their journals, that one hundred men of spirit and conduct might have kept off and ruined the colo∣nel's whole detachment. Did not all the guides say, that route was vastly more difficult and dangerous <HI>than any besides, all the way even to Fort Loudoun?</HI> Yet, notwithstanding all these dangers and difficulties, did not the colonel effectually accomplish these designs, <HI>with that detachment only,</HI> and return to the 913 at Cowhih the 4th day, about 11 o'clock, without the
<PB N="45" REF="009243_0044_1030C953417ADC48"/>loss of a man, or being so much as fired upon, after marching in all, backwards and forwards, full forty miles, equal, upon account of its difficulty, almost to double the distance, of any route the army had already p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed, or were to pass in their march back? Does not this plainly shew, how happily, how honourably, and how easily, all our disgraces, miseries and heavy taxes, might have been p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an end to last year, had no de∣lays been made at Keehowee, or had only ONE march more been ventured upon from Etchowih? The co∣lonel, in 1760, in one respect, would have run less risque than he did the year after, as the grand design was, or ought to have been then, the relief of Fort Loudoun: there would have been no necessity for sepa∣rating the troops to destroy the corn fields, which might have been omitted 'till their return: they might have pushed forward with all expedition, in one compact body, 'till they had first answered that most material purpose. Now let us compare the two armies toge∣ther. In 1760, the colonel had full 1450 rank and file, including serjeants, of regulars, rangers and pro∣vincials <HI>only,</HI> that <HI>warched</HI> from Kechowee; and had he made no delays there, he would have had 1500, be∣sides Indians. Last year, he had about 2400 rank and file, including guides, waggoners (now packhorse∣men) Indians and negroes. Were not 800 out of the 1200 picked Royals and Highlanders he had in 1760, returned to New-York? In the room of these, he had 980 men, including serjeants, of the battalion corps and Burton's regiment, <HI>that marched</HI> from Kee∣howee. Were tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> troops he had before, and these men of Burton's, <HI>just raised,</HI> so hastily collected toge∣ther, and so ordinary that nothing but the name of regulars could recommend them, to be compared to∣gether? The colonel will hardly say they were, not∣withstanding it must be allowed, that regiment had all the advantage that a diligent and experienced major could possibly give it, who did honour to his majest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s service, by his indefatigable application to his duty and care of those troops under him; yet the whole 800 pick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d men that went away, taken collectively, were certainly
<PB N="46" REF="009243_0045_1030C9591C1CD2B8"/>vastly more than preserable to the 980 that the colonel had in their room. The battalion corps were as good troops as the former, but there were but few of them. The 380 Royal, he had both campaigns. The rest, were provincials, Rangers, waggoners, guides, Indians, and 40 negroes. What value he would set on the first four of these (especially the Rangers) his opinion last year plainly shews; And were they not all new-rai∣sed troops, particularly the provin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ls? 'Tis true, he passed great compliments on both, and they deserved them: but did he not do the same at first, in 1760? and may it not be purely owing to the same cause, <HI>success?</HI> He thought <HI>mighty</HI> matters <HI>were done</HI> at the lower settlements his first campaign, and therefore to be sure it was pity to rob the Rangers of a little praise. In short, he was then <HI>"extremely pleased with the whole."</HI> But did not he <HI>himself</HI> do vasily more wonderful things, last summer, by his own accounts? How then could we <HI>expect</HI> any other, than to hear <HI>"the whole"</HI> praised again? Had it been <HI>otherwise,</HI> we should soon have been told the old <HI>story</HI> of the provincials <HI>"aban∣doning"</HI> their officers; <HI>"the Rangers and waggeners running off to a man;"</HI> and most of the guides being <HI>"not worth a shilling."</HI> As to the Indians, does he not say himself, in his letter to the lieutenant-governor da∣ted the 15th of July last, "<HI>he never could</HI> bear <HI>an In∣dian, before he was acquainted with the upper Chicke∣saws?</HI>" The Catawbas leaving him at K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehowee, in 1760, 'tis certain he thought of n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moment. Upon the whole, the number of troops employed in 1760, were amply sufficient to have gone through the nation: he then said as much himself; at least they were en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have prevented the business of the last campaign; which has fully confirmed that opinion, the superiority in 1761, was more in numbers than in real strength; especially, as no posts were fixed, and the additional quantity of provisions carried about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ry where with the army, must have greatly weakened, encumbered, and retarded the line of march, much more so, than the additional number of raw and ordinary troops could have strengthened it.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="009243_0046_1030C95C884602F0"/>
Let us begin with the army's arrival at Keehowee, the 27th of May last. Did not the colonel then find the Little Carpenter there, and give him a talk to the In∣dians, to this effect, that "<HI>if any would come in as friends, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peaceably and quietly as friends, they should not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lested or any of their effects meddled with"?</HI> Did not the Little-Carpenter set out with this talk to the Great-Warrior, the 29th, and promise to return in twelve days? Was not the giving or sending any talk, at that time, entirely inconsistent with the go∣vernor's advice, <HI>asked for</HI> by the colonel? Was there any the least propriety in then giving a talk at all, much less in sending one, especially to the Great-Warrior, after his monstrous and notorious murder of capt. De∣mere and all his officers but one, 25 of his men, and making prisoners of the rest, when he had granted a capitulation too? Must not the Great-Warrior think this savoured a little of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> year's behaviour at Keeho∣wee; of which what the Indians then thought has been hinted already. Only supposing all the Cherokees had remained peaceably in their town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what satisfaction could the colonel have taken of them? He would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not have broken his word surely, after promising that their persons and effects should be secure?</P>
<P>He marched from Keehowee the 7th of June, with full thirty eight days provision, and reached Stickowih old-town, 34 miles from thence, on the 9th early in the morning the day the Little-Carpenter's 12 days expired: this place is also called the Dividings, from the path to the Middle and Valley settlements parting just there; and would have been an allowed good place to have fixed <HI>a post</HI> at, and secured a communication with Fort Prince George. The colonel knew, from the guides, that he must return here, before he could proceed to the Valleys, a thing then <HI>expected,</HI> and <HI>ge∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rally and publickly,</HI> talked of throughout the army; and what does the colonel say prevented him, when, at his return to Keehowee, <HI>he wrote</HI> to his friends, that he intended <HI>even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n</HI> to go, if the Great-War∣rior did not come in; which account was <HI>very care∣fully and industriously</HI> propagated in town; but, not∣withstanding
<PB N="48" REF="009243_0047_1030C95E5645B4B8"/>this, general Amherst's printed letter in the London Gazette, and col. Byrd's to our lieute∣nant governor, laid before the assembly by his honour in September last, that must have both been wrote just at his return to Fort Prince-George, plainly shew, he had no intention of going there at all. Now sup∣pose <HI>only,</HI> a post had been fixed here, and full one half, or more, of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckhorse loads of provision<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en left, under the care of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men with a few ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es: That day, with the number of men he had, properly disposed (which to be sure the colonel, who had seen so much service, could not be at any loss a∣bout) would have been full sufficient to have com∣pleted this necessary matter, and made it impregnable to the Cherokees: However, let us allow two days more to do that business, and march to his camp near Estatow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h old-town, <HI>only</HI> 7 miles farther; this would have eased and secured the line of march, vastly more than the want of these 100 men would have weakened it; and besides, the colonel would have had many spare horses, for the sick, wounded, and other pur∣poses. The 12th, the colonel would have march∣ed from hence, and the action have happened (suppo∣sing the Indians had waited for him) at the same place, and at night he would have reached Etchowih as before. The day after the action (now the 13th) suppose the troops had reached Noucasih, where there was a warm town-house that the sick and wounded might have been placed in, the bulk of the remaining provisions might have been left here too; they would have been secured from an attack from the Indians, as the land all round was cleared at a sufficient distance: but supposing the colonel had liked the situation of Cow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, as it had been described to him, better, 'tis not much matter; this place was only three miles farther, and that whole day's march, supposing he had gone there, would not have been, at most, above six miles, only one fifth part so far as the march the year before, upon his return to Keehowee, when there were fewer carriers, abundantly more wounded, and they too, by description, in a far worse condition,
<PB N="49" REF="009243_0048_1030C964345406D0"/>though, by the bye, more of the wounded died this campaign, before the army returned to Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>howee, than the year before 'till they reimbarked. Supposing then the colonel had pushed to Cownih the day after the action, letting alone the interjacent towns 'till his return, some of them might have been useful in his march back. This day, the 13th, suppose an express had been sent off to Ninety-Six, as before to capt. Russel, for a fresh supply of provisions to be sent to Keehowee, to wait the colonel's orders. And, at Cowhih let us halt the next day, the 14th; when parties might have been sent out to destroy the Indian houses, or rather huts, at Eyoree, only two miles distant from his camp, and the corn-fields thereabouts and about Cowhih, in all about 40 houses and 200 acres of corn; this would have been easy work for that day, and discovered whe∣ther the Indians were inclinable for another brush. The next day, the 15th, supposing parties were sent to destroy the other towns thereabouts, or, that the co∣lonel proceeded to Stickowih branch; 'tis not so very material which was done first; it will ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e no altera∣tion in time; however, as the enterprize to Stickowih branch seems rather to claim the preference, because, from yesterday's proceedings, the Indians might have been induced to think the army would go to work at the other towns to day: let us then suppose, the colonel moved off as before, to Stickowih, with his 1448 rank and file, <HI>including</HI> Indians, negroes and guides, the 15th; and left 813 rank and file, instead of the 913, to guard the sick, provisions, &amp;c. then allowing him <HI>his own time,</HI> he would have destroyed the five towns thereabouts, vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Stickowih, Kittow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>roe∣tchih, Tasantih, and Ellijoy, and returned to Cowhih the 18th before noon, and these troops had the re∣mainder of the day to rest. The next day, and for two days afterwrds, suppose 700 of the detachment that had halted at Cowhih, had been sent, with 300 others, to destroy the 120 houses and 180 acres of corn at Usa∣nah, Cowhihtchih, and Burning-Town, the farthest of them only seven miles distant from Cowhih, march∣ing from town to town, this work would have been
<PB N="50" REF="009243_0049_1030C96760841CA8"/>as safe as easy; for, after the affair at Eyoree, that at Stickowih branch, and that of capt. Peter Gordon the year before, the colonel must have been convinced, no body of Indians would dare to interrupt so large a de∣tachment. The 21st, at night, let us suppose these troops return to the colonel at Cowhih. The next day, the 22d, halt at Cowhih, and destroy those hon∣ses. The 23d, the whole army march back to Nou∣casih, only 3 miles: a sufficient detachment of light troops might have been sent before, to destroy the 160 houses and 420 acres of corn at that place, and at Taffih, Whatogah, Canugah, and Noihowih, in the way thither. And the next day, the 24th, suppose the army halt at Noucasih, and complete yesterday's work if necessary. Now the Middle Settlements also, on this side Stickowih branch, are completely destroyed; the colonel has been allowed sufficient time too, se∣ven days, to march backwards and forwards from town to town, not 30 miles, besides <HI>the day</HI> the army is sup∣posed to do nothing else but march from Etchowih to Cowhih, only 6 miles, which are included in the 30, to destroy in all 390 houses and 800 acres of corn, and 70 of these houses and 100 acres of the corn close to his camp too at Cowhih; was it not abundantly more la∣borious and difficult, besides dangerous, to march backwards and forwards full 40 miles, with only his 1448 rank and file, to destroy the 190 houses and 530 acres of corn on Stickowih branch, and at Ellijoy in his way back to Cowhih? which he did in less than half the time. But supposing the detachment left at Cow∣hih had been ordered, might it not, in the time it had, have completed a post, sufficient, with 100 tired men, to have secured all the wounded, and what provisions were left, only for a few days? This post need not to have been very strong; a few scouts might have been ordered to watch it; the army too would have been all round it; and then the whole body, when both divisions joined again, might have been employed in destroying those middle towns, &amp;c. by detachments, which would have saved several days. However, as one would be determined to differ from the colonel as little
<PB N="51" REF="009243_0050_1030C968F8264868"/>possible, all possible contrivance has been made use of, to go the most <HI>round-about way to work</HI> that could be thought of, and I believe it would puzzle any inge∣nuity but the colonel's to spin out the time one day longer; besides all this, the colonel had the whole summer before him; supposing he had first of all laid in a sufficient stock of provisions at the Dividings, he might have taken his own time and way too, and com∣pleted every thing we wished for, long before the 16th of October, when, and not before, he left Keehowee to march downwards. The 25th of June, let us march from Noucasih to the Dividings, only 22 miles: when the colonel was last at Etchowih, only 3 miles within Noucasih, he could go with all his wounded, LOADED pack-horses, and litters, from thence to his camp near War-Woman's creek, full <HI>thirty</HI> miles: this shews he can make no difficulty here, unless he is so very unfor∣tunate as never to be able to make <HI>one single</HI> good march, upon the same ground too, but when 'tis a <HI>stolen</HI> one.</P>
<P>Now we are at the Dividings, let us halt the next day, the 26th. On the 27th, suppose 500 men had been dispatched to Fort Prince-George, without or with all the sick and wounded, with the pack-horses, to bring back the fresh supply of provisions that was ordered from Cowhih the 13th (to be sure it would have been <HI>hurrying</HI> matters too much, to have left or sent such orders <HI>before</HI>); and the same day, suppose 1200 light troops, free from any incumbrance, only six or eight days provision each, had been dispatched to the Valleys, might not these men have done that work too with ease, and returned back again to the Dividings in that time; the whole march, backwards and forwards, not exceeding 100 miles at farthest; as good a route too as any the troops had gone yet; and the seven Valley towns lay all in one open valley, from the first to the last not exceeding 12 miles. These 8 days would have brought the 4th of July, when at least 10 days provision would have been left for the colonel's detachment at the Dividings; indeed there would have been more, because the 500 with the

<P>If the colonel th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nks I march too fast, I would only beg leave to remind him of the affair in 1760 <HI>that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k its rise</HI> from Twelve-mile creek. He told us then, that "<HI>after marching</HI> 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>miles from Ninety-Six in three days, without a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting day,</HI>" notwithstanding they had drawn the carriages up the steep and rocky banks at Twelve-Mile creek, <HI>"by the force of men; the horses could not do it, being fatigued and worn out;"</HI> and "<HI>the men were a little fatigued with a march of</HI> 20 <HI>miles that morning, from Beaver-Dams to the river;</HI>" yet those troops could still proceed from thence the same night, and never halt 'till they had effectually destroyed the Lower-Towns, <HI>much more scattered than the Middle;</HI> which they did after a march of 60 miles by 4 o'clock the next evening, without sleeping. Here are 124 miles marched in five succeeding days (should be six from 28th of May to 2d of June) with∣out a halt, and three of then encumbered with waggons, that is, 20 or 25 miles a day for 5 or 6 days together. Now is there any more than one single day's march, according to the foregoing scheme, so long? the only long one proposed is 22 miles; the rest are very easy indeed. In the march to the Valleys, eight days are allowed to <HI>light</HI> troops, free <HI>the whole time</HI> from <HI>all</HI> incumbrances <HI>but their provision,</HI> to march <HI>only</HI> an hundred miles at farthest, not thirteen miles a day. Is there any comparison between the marches in 1760 and last summer? In those, 124 miles are marched in five or six days, many towns destroyed, and much other fatiguing business done: in these, only 176 miles, backwards and forwards, in 33 days, even including the separate marches of detachments (see the scheme at the end) about 5 miles a day: And if the colonel had gone to the Valleys, as was expected, that would have been but 100 miles more, about 8 miles per day on an average, only a third part of the mar∣ches in the first campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="009243_0052_1030C97076FD7420"/>
It may not be amiss to observe here, by the bye, that ten acres of Indian co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are much sooner and ea∣sier pulled up, and effectually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n one of wheat or any British grain; as, 'tis supposed, there are at least 1000 stalks of wheat for one of Indian corn in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re of ground, and a stalk of this may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed up with very little trouble or stooping.</P>
<P>The colonel, if he had planned his matters well, mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt have met the 500 at the Dividings, on his re∣turn from the Valleys; if not, an express sent off im∣mediately, would, in a day or two at most, have in∣formed him, whether they might be expected in time. If a disappointment had happened, he could have re∣turned to Keehowee immediately; if not, another 500 if necessary, might have been sent to escort the provi∣sions, &amp;c. to him. Now, had this step been taken, the colonel, two days after he had received a fresh supply of provisions, might have proceeded to Fort Loudoun, to take ample satisfaction of those principal aggressors, the Great-Warrior and the rest of the mur∣derers there bouts and convinced those savages, that we had spirit and power enough effectually to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their insolence; and then, very probably, this would have had some effect on the Creeks too, and made them glad to give us satisfaction. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dependance was to be placed on the Virginia forces last year as the year before; but if the colonel did really expect (which is hardly possible) that col. Byrd would be near the up∣per towns about this time, would not his marching have greatly facilitated his enterprize, and confounded those Indians. However, if the scheme to Fort Lou∣doun, which I believe was just as much intended as that to the Valleys (though this was expected, the other not) had no: been undertaken, has there not been at least enough said, to shew, the colonel had fall suffi∣cient time, and to spare, to have gone to the Valleys and done the necessary business there; which had he done, there would not have been occasion for above a week or ten days halt at his return to Keehowee, at most; indeed, what purpose could a longer halt have answered? as this would have more than completed

What greater proof could the colonel desire, to be convinced of the nothingness of his laborious peregrination, than the Great-Warrior's not coming at once?

But all could not persuade him to keep his word, when a detachment of 1000 or 1200 light troops would have been sufficient and might have gone almost ten times to the Valleys, in the time he so de∣structively negotiated away at Keehowee and Ninety-Six, 'till numbers deserted▪ Every body was tired out and dissatisfied, excepting the favourite suttling company, who were <HI>all</HI> of them well pleased "<HI>I</HI> DARE SAY."

<P>Would not the coming away from Keehowee, with∣out
<PB N="56" REF="009243_0055_1030C976C118D2A0"/>sending to the Indians at all, have shewn we despised them at least, and bid them defiance? especially, if the colonel had but DONE HIS UTMOST to destroy as many as be could the day of action, the only thing that can have any lasting effect upon them, as the assembly, the best judges of the temper of the Cherokees, plainly de∣clare, in their advice to his honour the lieutenant-go∣vernor in September last, when the Little-Carpenter first came down to treat: which message is so much to my purpose, not only in this, but so many other things I have advanced relative to this campaign, that I must beg leave to quote the greatest part of it here. "<HI>We are very sorry to find ourselves</HI> obliged, <HI>by the necessities and particular circumstances of the province, to advise your Honour to recede from the first, and what you con∣sidered as the grand article, that must be infist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on to sa∣tisfy our honour, and shew to the world an evident acknow∣ledgment of our superiority in arms, and at the same time to revenge the blood of our fellow subjects the late unhappy garrison of Fort Loudoun. We flatter ourselves we do not err, when we think that no province in America can have exerted themselves more vigorously than we have done this year: and with the assistance his majesty has been gra∣ciously pleased to afford us, we had the greatest reason to hope, a solid and lasting peace would have been the happy conclusion of the campaign; especially, as the commanding officer had declared, "that</HI> he would not agree to any terms till he was in the center of the Cherokee nation, and that no preliminaries should ever be signed by him but in one of their town-houses." <HI>Had this been done by a speedy, and, we may say, generally expected, march, to the Valley, since the army's return to Keehowee, we flatter ourselves we should not be</HI> reduced to this disagree∣able necessity, <HI>of advising your Honour to accept a peace, upon terms so precarious, and less honourable than we had reason to expect: but notwithstanding these expectations, we have foundation to think, by col. Byrd's letter to your Honour, dated only seventeen days after col. Grant's re∣turn to Keehowee, that a peace was determined upon; for col. Byrd says,</HI> "my orders were, to co-operate with, and assist, col. Grant. That gentleman writes me, he
<PB N="57" REF="009243_0056_1030C979C56A5658" MS="y"/>has completed his work already; so that could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pro∣ceed, I should not answer that end."—<HI>We dread the unhappy consequences that may attend col. Grant's depend∣ing too much on the importance of destroying the Middle Towns; a thing be made light of last year, for in the letter your Honour then laid before this horse, dated 3d July,</HI> 1760, <HI>he says,</HI> "Destroying an Indian town may be credit∣able; but, in fact, 'tis a matter of no great consequence, when the savages have time to carry off their effects" <HI>Again;</HI> "we might have gone to any town in their nation; but we should have had a brush to get at it, and then we should have found it, or indeed rather them all, abandoned," <HI>which was the case this year. We con∣ceive that the</HI> ONLY THING <HI>in a Cherokee way, that will any effect to bring those savages to a firm and lasting peace, is, to</HI> destroy <HI>as many of their people as we can, and when an opportunity offers so to do, to miss it by no means, which, we fear, has been too much the case in the late ex∣pedition and</HI> defensive <HI>action: and we are not without our apprehensions, that your Honour's information, that</HI> "their young men entertain no very respectable opinion or dread of the English manner of fighting Indians, tho' our numbers are formidable," <HI>may be too well ground∣ed. From these reasons; as the province is already greatly loaded with taxes; and as we have little prospect of the war being carried on in a different, and what we conceive more effectual, manner, than hitherto has been done; or that the colonel of the provincial regiment, though of great influence, merit, and abilities, and well acquainted with the interest of the province, and the proper manner of treating the Cherokees, will ever be consulted: we are</HI> REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY <HI>of advising your Honour to agree to a peace,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c."</P>
<P>In consequence of the above advice, the representa∣tives of the province <HI>"were reduced to the necessity of giving,"</HI> for the reasons therein mentioned, his ho∣nour and the Little-Carpenter agreed upon the twelve articles which were signed by both the 23d of Septem∣ber last, and then published in the gazettes.

Did not the Great-Warrior and Standing-Turkey sign the garri∣son's capitulation; and was it not soon after fatally convinced of their weight and treachery? What could the Little Carpenter then do? Why, he saved one gentleman's life. How? Did he not give all he had for him, even his rifle? 'Tis true, with <HI>his great inte∣rest among the Indian wenches,</HI> he now and then procured the garrison some small pittance of provisions; but did not the other warriors threaten to kill these wenches, if they could find them out? Need any thing more be said, to prove he had lost all his interest even among his own people? The Great-Warrior, Standing-Tur∣key, and Judd's Friend, the three KNOWN leading
<PB N="59" REF="009243_0058_1030C9813598AC30" MS="y"/>men of the Cherokee nation, thought, to come down would shew a condescention <HI>beneath</HI> them; and when these brevetted occasional headmen came, were they not again without our prisoners? (horses and cattle, to be sure, are not worth notice.) Notwithstanding this, we still finally confirmed and ratified the peace the 18th of December: and why could we not have done it as well in September, and saved our 500 pounds, not tribute, to be sure, the Indians won't take it in that light, but charity-money, besides other expences? Indeed the dread of ill usage to our unhappy fellow subjects amongst them, was the principal motive in the assem∣bly, for giving that sum; next to the colonel's ma∣nagement having so uselessly exhausted our funds, and disgusted our people in general, that it would be next to impossible for the province to raise any respectable body of men, even to oppose them should they break out again, and much more has he put it out of our power to raise troops for other purposes: Besides, as the peace WAS FINALLY RATIFIED, the assembly, though they <HI>did not approve</HI> of its being so without our prisoners being FIRST delivered up, yet, that <HI>they</HI> might throw no impediment in the way of so desirable an event, were induced to vote this sum. But I would ask here, if there was a pin to chuse, between the eight <HI>acting</HI> headmen the Little-Carpenter had with him in September, and those that attended him in De∣cember? Why did they not the last time bring our prisoners? They told us truly they were still a hunt∣ing; and so they have been ever since, to this day, poor fellows! Instead of getting any skins by their long hunt, I wish they may be able to save their own. —Surely capt. Watts must have been right, when he said, in the council-chamber, at the time the peace was ratifying, that the Little-Carpenter, <HI>"demanded presents, by way of ransom, for the prisoners not yet de∣livered."</HI> I wish no mistake has happened, as it is believed we shall find that to be the case, directly or indirectly, at last, if we have them at all, which is much doubted by many.—What the representatives of the province, at this time thought of this peace, and
<PB N="60" REF="009243_0059_1030C982D4093A08"/>the methods taken to bring it about, cannot be laid before the reader in a clearer and better manner, than by some of the transactions that passed in assembly at this time, relative to a certain curious talk o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Little-Carpenter's, delivered to capt.

<HEAD><HI>Fort Prince George, November</HI> 15th, 1761. A TALK from the LITTLE-CARPENTER, to Mr. Mackintosh</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHAT is this they are going to do with me and my people now? It is not enough, for the people of Carolina, to be always telling me lies; but now, the</HI> Dreadful Warrior, <HI>as they call him (for my part, I will call him the</HI> Corn-Puller) <HI>is making a strong house at Ninety-Six, for me and my people, while they stay there, and then to drive us to Charles-Town like a par∣cel of sheep. The house has two apartments, one for the men and one for the women. And now that is true what the Virginia people and col. Byrd said, that Carolina and col. Grant spoke with two tongues; and when I was last in Carolina I saw it; for I was promised, where∣ever I come, to get provisions, rum, fresh horses, &amp;c. and I never got either, but starved me. And now, when I bear what they are going to do with me, I and all my people will turn back.</HI>—Upon which Mr. Mackintosh enquiring <HI>how he came by this news,</HI> the Carpenter said, <HI>from
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Cherokees are known to despise their wenches, and disregard all they say.</NOTE> two wenches who left col. Grant at Ninety-Six making the strong house.</HI>—Mr. Mackintosh told him, <HI>how ridiculous it was, for him to believe wenches, who he knew went always about telling lies,</HI> and desired <HI>be might send down an Indian fellow with a white man, to convince him what a lie they invented.</HI>—The Car∣penter said, <HI>it was possible they might lie, as well as the people of Carolina; but to-morrow I will come, and give you a talk to send to the governor and col. Grant;
<PB N="65" REF="009243_0064_1030C998C2236CA0"/>but you must give me a great deal of flour and beef, for I am not alone, I have got a great many with me. I want to ask you, what you will give for each prisoner that is come down; if you pay well for those that it come now, all the rest will come down; if not, I know not bew it shall be; one hundred and fifty weight of leather a piece is the leas? you can give for them, for I was told to deliver them to you.</HI>—Mr. Mackintosh told him, <HI>he heard they was to be given in exchange for their own people.</HI>—The Carpenter said, <HI>that col. Grant told him, their people in Charles-Town</HI> HE <HI>took in war, and it was what</HI> ME <HI>would, to deliver them up; if they got nothing for them they brought down now, they would bring no more down.</HI>—Mr. Mackintosh told the Car∣penter, <HI>he could not presume to say any more on that head, but that he would write to the governor and</HI> col. Grant <HI>to-morrow when be came to the fort.</HI></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Now, Sir, you plainly see the aukward and con∣temptible situation the colonel's fine management has reduced us to with the Cherokees, even with our old friend too the Little-Carpenter. The expence this province alone (exclusive of any assistance) has been at in the war with these savages, for very little more than two years, amounts to upwards of £. 750,000 currency, more than equal to £. 107,000 sterling, of which full two-thirds might have been saved, had the colonel, in 1760, only marched immediately after the surprize at the Lower Settlements, without any delays, and loss of time spent in negotiations with the Indians, which no body, as ever I heard of, thought he had <HI>any</HI> business with; the province wanted his assistance <HI>only</HI> to fight them.</P>
<P>The Indians remain still quiet, and perhaps they may continue so 'till the French are able to supply them, tho' even this is very doubtful, for the spring is not yet far enough advanced, so as to cover the trees with leaves, and give them the opportunity of that secure cover they so much value in war. Our prisoners are <HI>still</HI> out upon the hunt, and if they are permitted to keep them (as well as the horses and cattle) or are paid for them,
<PB N="66" REF="009243_0065_1030C99C21BA0880"/>perhaps they may take compassion on us, and trouble us no more, especially as, 'tis to be hoped that, it will soon be out of the power of the French to supply them; this the matter seems entirely to turn upon: but only suppose this contingency should happen, what one rational security have we, that they would not immediately break out again and join them? Do not all their talks, all their behaviour, plainly shew, they will do only what <HI>they</HI> please, and are so far from fearing, that they despise us and make us their <HI>dupes;</HI> and will keep in with us just as long as it suits their humour, or 'till they can be supplied elsewhere, and no longer?</P>
<P>The colonel, very soon after his return from the French, after the affair at Fort Duquesne, was sent to us the <HI>first</HI> time, and did worse than nothing: He was sent to us again, a <HI>second</HI> time, and did twice as much: And, 'tis very probable, he has not yet shewn us half he can do in the same way; another expedition may be still necessary; the Valleys, the Upper towns, the principal aggressors, have not yet lost any of "THEIR <HI>most valuable effects;</HI>" only suppose (no unlikely thing) that those should break out again, may we not have the colonel sent to us a <HI>third</HI> time "<HI>to bring them to</HI> REASON"? and does the province want any thing more, than his presence a third time, as a commander in chief, to make all our estates as purely <HI>negative,</HI> as the pay of the soldiers and many of the officers was to them, when the monopolizing company of suttlers took their last leave of the camp.</P>
<P>This, Mr. Timothy, is my apprehension, and the principal occasion of this second trouble to you; and if the matters that are here taken notice of, are in the least degree instrumental to prevent so terrible an evil, I shall think I have done the public some service; if not, <HI>liberavi animam mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> But, are we not particu∣larly and extremely unfortunate, in these glorious and happy times all round us, when the numerous officers in his majesty's service have so generally distinguished themselves, that it is impossible to name them all, and to particularize any, would be shewing a want of de∣licacy
<PB N="67" REF="009243_0066_1030C99F91EBD078"/>to the rest; that in these times, I say, we should twice running have this gentleman sent to our assis∣tance, upon a most easy business indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which he had each time very <HI>evidently</HI> in his power to accom∣plish, and completely answer all our wishes; but in∣stead of doing it, has made matters abundantly <HI>worse,</HI> by mistaking his talents and business too. Have we any thing to blame for this but pure ill fortune? Ma∣ny have thought indeed, that the transactions in 1760 ought to have been timely laid before the general, which would perhaps have had some effect, to prevent this complete master of insinuation, painting, and de∣sign, from coming here the second time; but whose business was this? You'll say, the assembly ought to have concurred to give them the proper weight and sanction; but this could not be had from that assem∣bly, whose three years sitting, according to law, ex∣pired a few days after the colonel left us, in August, 1760; and very soon after the next assembly met, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> account of his late majesty's demise arrived, which very soon occasioned that too to be dissolved, before any thing of this sort could have been properly done; and in the interim this gentleman was appointed <HI>again.</HI></P>
<P>Numberless advantages, no doubt, attend the pre∣sent glorious times, wherein his majesty's arms have so universally succeeded every where, but here; not in the colonel's rhetorical figurative manner, on <HI>paper</HI> only, but really in the downright <HI>honest</HI> British man∣ner. But even amongst us, who are so particularly unfortunate as to be the only exception, is it a small advantage, arising purely from these times, to be able to point out the cause of our misfortunes, in a more open, plain and <HI>easy</HI> manner, than the times (as re∣ported) no very great interval since, would have suf∣fered us to do consistent with safety and prudence? when it was suspected to be, av'rice <HI>all,</HI> and</P>
<P>Our flag, inverted, trail'd along the ground. Then, how could it be expected, that WE should be able to make use of those <HI>delicate</HI> expressive hints,

<PB N="68" REF="009243_0067_1030C9A29F32B990"/>Now, even an American may tell out the grievances of an injured province, in his own uncouth manner, without danger of giving offence, <HI>tempera mutantur.</HI> The heart is now sound, the touch'd parts are not a∣bove skin deep at most, are soon distinguished, and as soon removed, to the great case and advantage of the rest. Avarice, artifice, pretence, imposition, design∣ing self-sufficiency, neglect, and gross misrepresenta∣tion, may be pointed at, whatever little dirty corner they may sneak into and huddle together, without that <HI>nice and difficult</HI> delicacy that must have been absolute∣ly necessary heretofore, when so general a room was supposed to be afforded them. To make use of that <HI>nice</HI> stile now, would, if we were able, be not only al∣together unnecessary, but an affront to the times, and imply a doubt of that so general and visible change for the better.</P>
<P>I gave you some reason to expect in my laft, that I would furnish you with a calculation of the profit gained on a hogshead of rum sold by the suttlers in Mr. Lyttle∣ton's camp at Keehowee in December 1759; and also of that gained by the suttling company last summer at same place, in col. Grant's camp. The two principal suttlers in 1759 paid 32 s. 6 d. per gallon for their rum in Charles-Town. The beginning of last summer this article might have been bought for 14 s. per gallon, and even at 13 s. 9 d. as I have been <HI>well</HI> informed a con∣siderable quantity was then bought by the suttler. Now supposing a hogshead of rum of about 110 gal∣lons to weigh about 1000 lb. which I am informed is allowed for a hogshead one with another.—

<P>Then as one gallon of rum that cost at Keehowee in 1759, 50 s. 9½ d. was never sold for more (though sometimes for considerably less) than 6 l. per gallon. The same quantity that cost only 29 s. 2 d. last sum∣mer, ought to have been sold there, in order to gain the like proportional profit, at 3 l. 8 s. 10¼ d. (say 3 l. 9 s. or even 3 l. 10 s.) which leaves above 140 per cent. clear gain; but it was still sold at 6 l. therefore the diffe∣rence, 50 s. currency, upwards of 7 s. sterl. per gallon, that is above 170 per cent. MORE (over and above the other <HI>moderate</HI> profit of ONLY 140 per cent.) was exorbi∣tantly squeezed out of the poor soldiers pockets.—<HI>N.B.</HI> As the army in 1759 did not then halt above three weeks, and that in the middle of winter, at Keehowee, and the troops last summer were fourteen weeks there, the suttling company this last campaign, besides other advantages in so long a halt, had an opportunity of putting off a prodigious quantity of other goods, more than the suttlers in 1759 could; for which rea∣son, the company might have afforded their goods much cheaper, in proportion, than the others were able to do▪ in the summer too, when grass was plen∣ty, it would have been worth while to have had wag∣gons and horses of their own, especially for so long an opportunity, and this I am told that company had, which must make their freight much lower still, as there was no danger then of their horses perishing in the woods for want of food. In my last I took notice of the advanced price on several other articles.</P>

'Tis high time, Mr. Timothy, to finish this tedious letter. The matters mentioned therein, happened dur∣ing the three difficult and laborious assemblies I had the honour to serve in. Whether my remarks are to the purpose, or no, the candid reader will certainly be the best judge: I am sure, he will at least be convinced, that I have not, in that time, been inattentive to the most materials concerns of the public. I shall hardly ever trouble you with a third letter. I am conscious of no prejudices against any man, or that I have exceeded the bounds that truth, honour, sincerity, and duty to the public prescribe.</P>
<P>Prejudices of MOST sorts, of a <HI>national</HI> nature, be∣tween man and man, are contemptible to the last de∣gree; but ALL those of a <HI>domestic</HI> nature, are not only so, but infamous and hurtful too, and subversive of the true general interest of the community. I call all those <HI>demestic</HI> prejudices between man and man, where any set of individuals of the same monarchy, because they happen accidentally to be born in this street, this parish, this county, or this larger division of it, or for any other as partial trifling distinction whatever, are influenced thereby in their interdealings, connections and judgments, to the injury of their fellow subjects born in a different part. All the individuals of the same monarchy, from one extreme to the other, ought to be thought <HI>countrymen,</HI> and have such a regard for each other as is consistent with the whole. The small limited preferences that nature may point out among friends and relations, can be but few, and if not car∣ried beyond <HI>her</HI> bounds, <HI>cannot</HI> have a bad tendency, as <HI>none</HI> of her rules have. All the men in a parish, and more so in a large division of a monarchy, cannot be thought to <HI>know</HI> each other; time and accident ought to be allowed their due effect with all subjects alike; and nothing can be more despicable and prejudicial to a community, than for any set of men, to make the intervention of what they <HI>contractedly</HI> call a <HI>countryman,</HI> the <HI>fine quâ non,</HI> or test of their sincerity, friendship, and favours. Is not this dividing a kingdom against itself, the consequence of which we know very well from
<PB N="71" REF="009243_0070_1030C9AA791F8CE8"/>the highest authority?—There cannot be many, sure∣ly, amongst us, if any, of these narrow destructive sentiments; but if there should, they ought to be pi∣tied: And, if a contrary behaviour, of impartiality and generosity among their fellow subjects, receiving them with open arms every were, will not open their eyes, and make their little hearts glow with more en∣larged and grateful sentiments, and restore them to their true, general, and equal gravitation, they must be left to <HI>feel</HI> the natural consequences <HI>such a selfish behaviour,</HI> when <HI>generally</HI> perceived, <HI>must</HI> occasion. NOTHING can possibly be said for ANY of these <HI>domestic</HI> preju∣dices between man and man; they must be ALL as o∣dious as hurtful. As to SEVERAL of the <HI>national</HI> while mankind are divided into different monarchies and go∣vernments, and, according to the fluctuating situation of all human affairs, frequently involved unhappily into a state of war with each other, SOMETHING may be faid in <HI>their</HI> favour: for instance, under the many gal∣lant and prudent officers at this time in his majesty's navy, may not, and has not, a good use been frequently made, of that common prejudice that our most useful experimental philosophers, the honest British tars have among them, that one Briton is as good as six Frenchmen. In short, <HI>national</HI> prejudices between man and man may be <HI>sometimes</HI> serviceable; but <HI>domestic,</HI> are <HI>always</HI> de∣structive and abominable, and whatever may be thought,
<Q><L><HI>Tros Tyrius que mihi nullo discrimine agetur,</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Wolfe</HI> or <HI>Forbes</HI> I equally admire:</L></Q> That for his generous well-timed intrepidity when the national circumstances required it, to despise all dan∣gers, and attempt <HI>every thing,</HI> even under such great and numerous disadvantages as he had to encounter at Quebec: This for his determined steadiness and fortitude, to be overcome by no difficulties, but still to push forward, and clear his way as he advanced, 'till he had fully accomplished his most important work at the Ohio, though at the same time death-struck, and carried upon a litter many hundred miles, through frosts and snows, in the midst of winter. Military heroism cannot well be carried farther, than it was by these
<PB N="72" REF="009243_0071_1030C9ADB0A6BE10"/>two gentlemen, who will ever be remembered with honour, as long as any spark of it remains in the Bri∣tish American colonies.</P>

<P><HI>P.S.</HI> As you have been so long prevented, for want of assistance, to print the foregoing letter, it gives me an opportunity of remarking (I wish I could say of congratulating the public) on the news from Fort Prince-George dated the 6th ult. and printed in the last weekly gazette, from whence we are <Q><HI>assured, this is the firmest peace that ever was made with the Cherokees;</HI></Q> that <Q><HI>the chain is bright, the path is strait, the talk is good, the hatchet is buried, and the sun shines.</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>The white</HI> PRISONERS <HI>are</HI> deli∣vering <HI>up, and the commandant expects</HI> the whole <HI>e∣very day, with</HI> all the negroes, <HI>in terms of the trea∣ty.</HI></Q> One <HI>prisoner,</HI> and no more, as ever I heard of (perhaps a breeding woman, and so reckoned PRI∣SONERS) was <HI>delivered</HI> up (before the date of that letter) since the Little-Carpenter left Charles-Town in December last. At the time that <HI>double</HI> or <HI>treble</HI> prisoner was brought in, that politician was said to be coming down with the rest, thirty more, and might be expected in a few days. Now it seems, he is gone to Virginia.—Our prisoners are STILL out a hunt∣ing:
<PB N="73" REF="009243_0072_1030C9B0C83D5C18"/>or, <HI>they will not</HI> come away, but <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se</HI> to stay with the Indians: or, they are afraid to stir, on ac∣count of the Northern Indians, who are pretended to be about their towns, and may kill them by mistake for Cherokees, being dressed and painted like them: These, and such like ridiculous pretences, have been long trumped up, and are still making, and no doubt if the Cherckees should tell us, <HI>their</HI> enemy Indians have killed all our prisoners, it would readily be be∣lieved, by some, as highly probable; and those looked upon as very faithless and unreasonable, who would scruple their veracity, and suspect them to have bad any hand in it themselves.</P>
<P>'Tis now (the oth of May) almost a twelve-month since the colonel, by his own account to the general, last <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> drove about <Q>5000 <HI>of the Cherokees into the woods and mountains</HI></Q> (wherefrom? the woods and mountains: much like driving a shoal of fish from one pond into another) <Q><HI>where, having</HI> nothing <HI>to sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t upon, they</HI> MU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T <HI>either</HI> starve or SUE <HI>for peace.</HI></Q> How did the colonel know they had <HI>no∣thing?</HI> I never heard of much corn he destroyed, ex∣cepting in the fields; what was remaining of the prece∣ding crop, for aught he then knew, was h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and secured in these mountains, and 'tis very probable it was so, besides other provisions, sufficient to serve them, with a little horse-flesh now and then as a relisher, for it seems, by this inteiligence, they have EATEN all OUR horses. More houses, or rather huts, are soon fitted up and refurnished, as we know <Q><HI>they saved all their most valuable effects,</HI></Q> unless they got spoi∣led in moving.</P>
<P>The two principal criterions, to judge of the Indians peaceable intentions (together with their continuing quiet) are, their delivering up our prisoners, and not joining the French should they be able to supply them. This last, which is by far the surest sign, would de∣monstrate their sincerity; but this we have not an op∣portunity to judge by yet, and God forbid we ever should. Their long shuffling delays in regard to the other, give us the highest reason to suspect their cor∣diality

<P>ON the arrival of the waggons the second time from Monck's corner, we proceeded on our march the 17th instant, at four in the morning, for Ninety-six fort, leaving an officer with a detachment from the Highlanders to bring up the waggons that were not ready to march from the camp; that day encamped at Miln-creak; 18th, at Hollow-creek, where the remainder of our waggons, with the detachment joined us: The 19th and 20th were obliged to halt to refresh the hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and repair the broken waggons; <HI>here king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ler and about forty Catawbas fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ured us with their company:</HI> The 21st, the arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reached the Little Saluda river, after being severely pelted with rains during the march; the rains con∣tinued all that night, and were so heavy next day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to prevent our marching: The 23d we lodged at Saluda Old-Town, where there is only the vestige of one house; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kin joined us; and on Saturday 24th May, at ten o'clock in the morning, we arrived at Ninety six, where there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ockade, and a great number of miserable people, chiefly women and children, cooped up in it. Captain Thomas Bell who com∣mands this fort is a good sort of a man; the men who are with him are to be put into pay, and left as a garrison, for none else can be spared. We halt here till the cattle can be col∣lected, of which two or three droves are coming up to us. Twenty waggons are sent back to Congarees to bring up more flour.</P>
<P>"At Hollow-Creek we had an express from Fort Prince-George, which the messenger lest 13th instant, <HI>and since the negro Abram is arrived with dispatches from that fort and Fort Loudoun.</HI> This negro, who is the property of one Mr. Behn, has certainly executed the commands of the govern∣ment, in delivering the letters at both forts, with surprising dispatch, in the midst of so much danger: His master, who is now here, says he has no objection to his being made free, but as he has lost his all, except this negro, in the present troubles, hopes the province will not let him be a sufferer.</P>

After we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> marched about 16 miles, a dog was heard bark∣ing at some distance in our front and the guides informed us, that there were a few houses about a quarter of a mile from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, called Little K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owee, of which indeed they had not informed us before: To prevent any inconvenience from these houses, the light infantry company of the Royal was detacked to surround the houses, and put the Indians to death with their ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onets. By an accident▪ a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out which had been at Fort Prince-George that very day, were encamped near the houses, and upon discovering our men, they fired at them; a sew of ours returned the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but immediately rushed in upon them, and most of those who were without the houses, and all who were in them, were put to death with bayonets, except the women and children, according to the orders which had been given. We proceeded directly on our march to Estatoe, and found a few houses on the road just deserted; the beds were warm, and every thing was left in the houses, which you may believe did not escape. We arrived early in the morning at Estatoe, which was abandoned about half an hour before: ten or a dozen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, who had not time to escape, were killed; The town, consisting of above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> houses, well provided with ammunition, corp. and in short all the necessaries of life, we plundered and laid in ashes; many of the inhabitants who had endeavoured to conceal
<PB N="79" REF="009243_0078_1030C9C6B4457070"/>themselves, I have reason to believe perished in the flames, some of them I know of for certain. In order to continue the blow, and to shew those savages that it was possible to punish their insolence, we proceeded on our march, took all their towns in our way, and every house and town in the Lower nation shared the same fate with E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. I could not help pitying them a little: Their villages were agreeably situated; their houses neatly built and well provided, for they were in the greatest abundance of every thing: They must be pretty numerous. Estatoe and Sugar-Town cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> at least of 200 houses, and every other village at least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> houses. After killing all we could find, and burning every house in the nation, we marched to Keowee, and arrived the second of June (after a march of above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miles without sleeping) at four in the evening at fort Prince-George. There must have been from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 to 80 Cherokees killed, with about 40 prisoners; I mean men, women, and children. Those who escaped must be in a miserable situation and can possibly have no resource but flying over the mountains, in case their friends there will receive them: they can have saved nothing: some of them had just time to run out of their beds; others left their sepann warm upon the table and in their kettles. The surprise in every town was almost equal, as the whole affair was the work of a very few hours. They had, both at Estatoe and Sugar-Town, plenty of ammunition, which was destroyed; and every where astonishing magazines of corn, which were all consumed in the flames: they had not even time to save their most valuable effects: The soldiers sound money in many hou∣ses; 3 or 4 watches were got; their wampum, their cloaths, skins, and in short every thing. Many loaded guns went off when the houses were burning. I had almost forget to tell you that we itnended to save Sugar-Town, as the place nearest the fort (where they even had a stockade fort): Cen∣tries were placed for the security of the town, but we found the body of a dead man, whom they had put to the torture that very morning, it was then no longer possible to think of mercy.</P>

<P>"MY last, of about half a dozen lines, was written 22d June, in the hurry of our preparation for the march: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing that the release of the prisoners detained at this fort, had not the effect of bringing about an accommodation of dif∣ferences, after the blow we had given in the lower nation, not∣withstanding that Tiftoe and the Old Warrior of Estatoe had used all their influence for that purpose, as well as the Little-Carpenter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Upper nation, it was found necessary to carry the correction a little farther, in order to sicken the savages of the war, who, it seems, after calling general councils often, determined to oppose our entering their country, by arms, ra∣ther than trust their persons in our hands at a treaty, giving for a reason, the putting the hostages to death, and the seizure and confinement of some more of their headmen, at Fort Prince-George: These were obstructions to a peace which we could not surmount, and of consequence hostilities, as far as people in our circumstances could carry them, were determined on.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bags for carrying flour were made with all expedition, out of the soldiers tents and waggon-cloths, and pack-saddles, with the necessary furniture for them, out of bear-skins and bullock hides; all the invalids were left to reinforce the fort and guard our baggage, for two shirts, a bear-skin and a blan∣ket, with a little rum, was all that any officer could propose to carry: tents for the troops could not be thought of in our cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>"<HI>June</HI> 24th. Early in the morning we set out on our march and arrived that night at Okonee-Creek, distant about 12 miles from Fort Prince-George, <HI>but the night before our march</HI> ABOUT FORTY <HI>rangers diserted, with not only their own horses,</HI> BUT A GREAT MANY MORE, which occasioned a distress in carrying on the flour-bags.</P>
<P>"2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th. We proceeded from Okonee to a strong post, about half a mile below the War-Woman's creek, where we en∣camped in a square, with guards advanced from each face, and the picquets laying out to cover our people in cooking and taking up water, the flour with a guard over it was in the cen∣tre of the square, as well as the horses tied up in the night∣time; almost all this day we marched through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gliest ground, and most dangerous passes ever troops had to penetrate through, narrow defiles and gaps of mountains, where one would imagine a handful of men could ruin an army more nu∣merous
<PB N="82" REF="009243_0081_1030C9D198CA7368"/>far than our little detachment, however every precau∣tion was taken, where horse could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, which frequently was the case, the tops of the mountains, which overlocked the line of march, were scoured by grenadiers and light infantry, This march was about 17 or 18 miles.</P>
<P>"26th. We arrived safe at Stickoe old town 12 miles from our former encampment, through passes rather more dange∣rous than in the former days march.</P>
<P>"27th. In the morning we found ourselves within 18 miles of the nearest town in the middle settlements, called Etchoey, one of their mother towns, and consequently what they call a beloved one; if we were to be opposed at all, this day's march was the time to look for an attack, and you may be∣lieve we prepared accordingly, our picquet being formed from the line of regulars, this night the grenadiers and light in∣fantry were relieved from their share of that duty, because they were to march in front in the morning, and the two bat∣talion corps formed the piquet, which fell in course of roster, to be commanded by capt. Peter Gordon. A few light horse went in front to make discoveries, with a few more on the flanks, but where the ground was very suspicious, platoons of grenadiers and light infantry, were ordered out to scour the thickets, and other places of ambuscade, the grenadiers and light infantry were followed by the Highlanders, and the Royal fell in the rear, next a baggage guard of regulars, in front of the baggage and packhorses, which were led by offi∣cers servants and waggoners, who were armed before we left fort Prince George; <HI>in the center of the packhorses was an effi∣cer and twenty men from the picquet, and in the rear of the whole was the captain of the picquet with 50 men and one offi∣cer,</HI> FOLLOWED <HI>by the cattle under the care of a body of rangers.</HI></P>
<P>"After marching 12 miles, four Indians were discovered, one of which was apprehended by Beamer the guide; he told COLONEL GRANT that the Indians did not expect us so soon, but to this HE paid no credit, as he was fatisfied they must have seen us every day on our march, (the Indian is still in custody.) After marching a mile farther, we came to an ugly kind of plain, covered with wood and brush so thick that one could scarce see three yards distance in some places; and an ugly muddy river, with steep clay banks running through it, overlooked on one fide by a very high mountain, and on the other by hilly uneven ground, a situation, in all its parts, well adapted to the Indian method of fighting, and through this infernal place must our road inevitably go, because the creek or river was only practicable for the baggage and provision horses in one place.</P>

When we came near the town, some of the enemy were discovered in the edge of the wood, upon which the grendiers and light infantry were ordered to march up in columns for forming more expeditiously, and upon receiving our first fire they chose to save themselves by flight: We crossed the river and took pessession of the town, which was ordered not to be burnt, both upon account of the corn it contained, and that we might have houses to put our wounded men in, the number of which was very confider∣able. The action lasted about an hour, Capt. Manly Williams of the Royal was killed, truly a gentleman, and an extreme good officer, it is a loss to the service.—After we had passed, a party lay in ambuscade for the picquet with our provision-horses and cattle; the attack first began in the hollow, when our people thought it expedient to take possession of a rising ground hard by, and there defend themselves; <HI>the attack came i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such a vari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of quarters, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they were obliged to divide themselves into small parties, some with officers, some with serjeants; they were pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igerem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> on by the ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> and as often repulsed them with loss on both sides, the number of wounded being considerable on our part, a sort of breast-work was made of flour-bags, and they were thrown within it.

<HEAD>Col. Grant's SECOND Letter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"COL. Montgomery informed you of our intended march from Keowee town. We left that place the 24th, and foor perceived that our guides had misinformed us about the reads, very likely from ig∣norance, a few perhaps had some little design in representing things in as favourable a light as possible, in order to induce us to go on, that they might have some chance of recovering their horses, or some of their other effects; but let that be as it will, they are very bad judges of the sort of road necessary for the march of a body of troops, and when we came to have a little brush, they knew no road at all, I must except from the number Beamer, who is hardy and intelligent, and Boyl and the Collier have merit; Jones behaved well 'till he was wound∣ed; the others are not worth a shilling.</P>
<P>"'Tis next to impossible for troops to go to the Middle-Settlements without forming posts at different places: if the people who are in pos∣session of the country had spirit to defend it, there are passes innumerable; the whole country the strongest and most difficult I ever was in; a very few men properly conducted might retard the march of an army. But our friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Cherokees, were kind enough to give us no trouble, 'till we got near Etchoé, their beloved town. About SIX miles from that place, we found a considerable body of Indians, of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Settlements, with some Creeks and Chactaws (if we can believe people who pretend to know their language). They were posted upon very advantageous ground, had taken possession of every pass, and seemed determined to defend the town in the best manner they could; but the troops behaved so remarkably well, that the Indians were drove from post to post, and the detachment arrived in very good order at Etcheé, though I must own the march was troublesome, the difficulties of the country not to be imagined, and the fire of the In∣dians, though at a distance, as they have a number of rifles, did execu∣tion. Poor capt. Williams with about 17 of our men killed, many of∣ficers wounded, and above 60 men; those we carried with us to the town, and have brought back with us to this place. I think there was a waggoner and a ranger killed, and sive or six of them wounded: I am sorry that I cannot say any thing in their savour, they behaved most in∣famously, near fifty deserted the night before we marched, and they run off to a man the moment they heard the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing begin, at which time poor capt. Morrison was killed, when he was advancing and doing his duty like a gallant good officer. I assure you he is a less to the prevince, but
<PB N="87" REF="009243_0086_1030C9DE5C49FD38"/>be unfortunately was abandened by his people. Poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ranger to stand, quit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> horse and went on with our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and behaved the whole day extremely will, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Ones<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was likewise of use; in the rear, which was has purt, according to the order of march of that day.</P>
<P>"When the Indians found that it was impossible to prevent our ges∣ting to the town, they endeavoured to cut off our pack-hertes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but were prevented by the captain of the pirquet from doing us any harm in that way. Capt. Peter Gorden who was upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at duty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up the best p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st he could find, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their attack, and saved every thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till a reinforcement was sent to him, and then brough, up the whole to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> town ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p.</P>
<P>"The Indians w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll not terget this attack soon, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fifty men, forty of their dead bodies were found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I hardly think that they have so many wounded in preportion, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never fired but when they were near them. Destraying an Indian town may be creditable, but 'tis in fact a matter of no great consequence, when the savages have time to carry off their effects. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us dear. The killed I look upon as a tride, people are then prended for; but the wounded in a remote frontier is a distressing circumstance. We might have gone to any town in their nature, but we thould have had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to get at it, and then we thould have found it, or indeed rather them all abandoned, but the lift of our wounded must have increased, at sixty miles from fort Prince George, it was impossble to send them back; there was no such thing as leaving them to fall into the hands of savages, and it was absolutely impracticable to preceed with them; many of them are carried upon litters, none of them can walk, every one of them must have an attendant, and some of them are in such a fituation, that they must have two or three upon the march. The number of rangers much diminished, some of their horses employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not very fond of walking; in short, we were obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, in order to get horses for our waunded.</P>
<P>"In this situation col. Montgomery thought it adviseable, to return to fort Prince George, and from thence to proceed to the place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣barkation. There is not an Indian within sixty miles of the sert, the frontier is therefore much advanced. The Cherckces have suffered much, but they will not treat, and tis impossible to force them to come into terms; that must be a work of time, and you knew that no body of troops can extirpate an Indian nation. 'Tis really un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ky that a peace could not be brought about. We have succeeded in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung we have attempted, the Indians have been beat every where, they never have had the smallest advantage, and yet the province is still in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crape, for it appears to me that those savages cannot be convinced that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man is honest.</P>
<P>"We continued two days at E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chcé, and then stale a march upon them in the night, to get clear of the dangerous passes near that town, with our wounded and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risions. They gave us no trouble the first day's march. The second they intended to entertain us in a very strong pass: they had come in three be aies near our camp: the most conside∣rable body was scrprized in their camp on the top of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which com∣manded a defile where we were to pass: they were imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diately beat off, abandoned two bags of flour, a bag of ammunition, one of file, about 60 blankets, their t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>myhawks, wampum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This you see was a scout of some distinction. Another was used <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the some manner; one of our s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anking parties fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, fleed upon them at ten yards distance, when they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, being

They were beat off every where, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much; and indeed they have never come near us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce.</P>
<P>"We have left from 6 to 8 months <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Prince George, and forty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but the garrison remains there unwillingly.
