<P>Help Lord, for the godly Man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Psalm, <HI>David</HI> under an afflicting Sense of the Degeneracy of the Times, it's suppos'd under <HI>Saul</HI>'s Government, crieth to God for Help. <HI>Help Lord,</HI> or <HI>save: For the godly Man ceaseth.</HI> — They were put out of Place, or ta∣ken away by a violent, or natural Death; and there did not appear others of like Piety and Faithfulness to fill their Places, and make good their Ground. Iniquity abounded, and the Love of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y towards God, their Neighbour, and the best Interest of their People, waxed cold. Now such a degener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Day must be a time of Danger and Distress. 2 T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 3.1, 2.—<HI>Perilous Times shall come: for Men shall be Lovers of their own selves,</HI>— ver. 5. <HI>Having a Form of Godliness; but denying the Power thereof.</HI> Accord∣ingly, in this Day of Darkness and Gloominess, the <HI>Psalmist</HI> flieth to <HI>God's Name</HI> as to his <HI>strong Tower;</HI> to the Lord, to <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the self-existing and eter∣nal God, <HI>who is the Hope of Israel, the Saviour there∣of in Time of Trouble.</HI> Let us then hear the Voice of God's Word and Providence in the following <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>

</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who are intended by the Godly &amp; Faithful?</HI></P>
<P>The Children and true People of God are set before us in sacred Writ, under a Variety of en∣dearing Characters, which declare their real Excel∣lency, and the high Esteem which God the Foun∣tain of Honour hath for them.</P>
<P>Here we have them called the Godly &amp; Faithful <HI>Godly.</HI> The Word signifies, as a learned Man ob∣serveth, <Q>A sacred Affection of Mercy, Piety, Grace, Benignity, and bountiful Good-Will to∣wards any, without Respect of Merit.</Q> It is translated, <HI>Pious, Merciful</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Moman. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Calv.</NOTE>. <HI>Faithful.</HI> The Word signifyeth true, believing; all Manner of Faith and Faithfulness". Men of Integrity &amp;c. A full and distinct Consideration of these Characters would open a large Field of Discourse; but I shall in answer to the Inquiry, only say:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are Godly, who have the Image of God re∣stored to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Godly are <HI>God-like,</HI> they resemble God in his communicable Attributes &amp; imitable Perfections. Some of the <HI>divine Attributes</HI> are said to be <HI>incom∣municable,</HI> as God's <HI>Immensity, Unchangeableness</HI> &amp;c. And it would be high Presumption to pretend to resemble God in them. Others <HI>communicable;</HI> be∣cause
<PB N="3" REF="004196_0004_1003FD88677A04A0"/>
his <HI>intelligent Creatures</HI> may bear some Likeness and Resemblance to their <HI>Creator</HI> in them, as in his <HI>Wisdom, Goodness</HI> &amp;c. However, we must always remember that the One is <HI>infinite,</HI> the other <HI>finite.</HI> Math. 19.17. <HI>There is none good but One, that is God.</HI> None essentially, originally, infinitely Good. Now, Man was at first created in this Image of God. Gen. 1.26. <HI>And God said, Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeness.</HI> And this was, not only as God, the infinite and eternal <HI>Spirit,</HI> breath'd into Man the breath of Life, and gave him a <HI>living Soul</HI> endow'd with Understanding, Will, &amp; Affections; but in an especial Manner is he said to be made in the Image of God upon the ac∣count of the <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> of his Nature, where∣by he was fitted to imitate and serve his Maker. Eccl. 7.29. —<HI>God made Man upright,</HI> <Q>Right, conformable to his Nature and Will, which is the Rule of Right, after his own Likeness, Un∣derstanding, Holy, and every way Good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Pool</HI> in loc.</NOTE>.</Q> But, how is the Gold become dim! how is the most fine Gold changed! Man being in Honour, abode not; he soon fell from his original Purity, forfeit∣ed and lost the Image of God, for himself and his Posterity. The Crown is fallen from our Head; wo to us that we have sinned. For as <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>Root and Parent</HI> from whom we all sprang in the way of <HI>ordinary Generation;</HI> so it pleased God to appoint him the <HI>legal Head</HI> and Representative of his Posterity in the <HI>first Covenant:</HI> And accord∣ingly "we sinned in him, and fell with him in his first Transgression". Rom. 5.12. <HI>By one Man Sin entred in the World, and Death by Sin.</HI> ver. 19. <HI>By one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners.</HI> All
<PB N="4" REF="004196_0005_1003FD33B37CCD28"/>
the World is become guilty before God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19. And we have a <HI>corrupt Nature</HI> deriv'd to us from him. <HI>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? not one,</HI> Job 14.4.</P>
<P>However, the Light of Revelation shews us that this great Loss of the Image of God is not irrepe∣rable. In the Scriptures, that God, who dwells in the Light which no Man can approach unto, de∣clareth that there are <HI>Three</HI> that bear record in Heaven, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> and these Three are <HI>One,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.7. That God the Father hath sent forth his Son made of a Wo∣man; in whom, being God-Man in one Person, we behold the Glory of the divine Nature, and humane Nature in its highest Perfection. And the same Word declareth that our Lord Jesus being in the Form of God, took upon him the Form of a Servant, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross, that he might redeem his People from the Curse of the Law, and give them power to become the Sons of God; and that they, together with the Privilege of <HI>Adop∣tion,</HI> might have the Image of God restored to them, <HI>being born of God,</HI> Joh. 1.12, 13. Here we are also taught that in order to their being made Partakers of the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> "not by Communication of the divine Essence to them; but by God's impressing up∣on them Qualities and Dispositions which resem∣ble the Perfections of God": I say, that in order to this, the Son of God hath purchased and received the <HI>Gift of the Holy Ghost,</HI> who by his Office renews his People after the Image of God, when they are born of him; and so enableth them to <HI>put off the old Man which is corrupt; and to put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteousness, and true Holiness,</HI> Eph. 4.22,-24. Now these are called <HI>Godly</HI> in Scripture; for they resemble God in Knowlege,
<PB N="5" REF="004196_0006_1003F9F60EAFE340"/>
Righteousness and Holiness, in Goodness and Truth, Grace and Mercy, according to the Measure of the Gift of Christ; tho' not in sinless Perfection. And even in this Life, beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, <HI>they are changed into the same I∣mage from Glory to Glory,</HI> by the Spirit of the Lord: And they shall be perfectly transform'd into his Likeness when they shall see him as he is in the Light of Heaven. Psal. 17.15. <HI>As for me, I will behold thy Face in Righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy Likeness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Godly imitate the blessed God.</HI></P>
<P>And this naturally follows: Having the Image of God restor'd, they obey that Word, Eph. 5.1. <HI>Be ye Followers</HI> (or Imitators) <HI>of God, as dear Chil∣dren.</HI> The Graces of the Spirit are active Princi∣ples of spiritual Operations. Is God bound for his own Glory, as the highest and most worthy End? The Godly observe that Command, 1 Cor. 10.31. —<HI>Do all to the Glory of God.</HI> It is their sincere Endeavour that in this, their Tho'ts Words and Actions, may unite and center. And when they consider his infinite Glory, and how far they fall short of giving him the Honour due to his Name, even in their best Duties, they say with <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 42. 5, 6.—<HI>Now mine Eye seeth thee; where∣fore I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI> They fly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Righteousness of God provided in his Son for their Justification, and say with the A∣postle <HI>Paul,</HI> Phil. 3.8, 9. — <HI>I count all Things but Loss for the Excellency of the Knowlege of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the Loss of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is
<PB N="6" REF="004196_0007_1003F9B39AFEEB50"/>
of God by Faith.</HI> Again, as God is <HI>righteous</HI> in all his Ways, and <HI>holy</HI> in all his Works; they endea∣vour to serve him in <HI>Holiness</HI> &amp; <HI>Righteousness</HI> before him, all the Days of their Life; and thus to obey that Word, 1 Pet. 1.15. <HI>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which hath called you is holy, so be ye Holy in all Manner of Conversa∣tion.</HI> They present their Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is their reasonable Service. They seperate themselves from Sin, <HI>deny∣ing Ungodliness and worldly Lusts;</HI> And they con∣secrate their Powers and Talents to the Service of God. It is their endeavour that <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> may be written upon <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>Again, As the blessed God is <HI>good to all,</HI> and in a peculiar Manner <HI>good to Israel;</HI> so that Law is written on their Hearts, Gal. 6.10. <HI>As we have therefore Opportunity, let us do good unto all Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, especially unto them who are of the Houshold of Faith.</HI> According to their Ability they do Good, yea are rich in good Works, being desirous that others be∣holding them may <HI>glorify</HI> their <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> and that they may approve themselves his <HI>genuine Offspring.</HI> And as God is good to the Unthank∣ful and Evil, they strive in this also to follow him, observing their Lord's Command, Mat. 5.44, 5. <HI>Love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despite∣fully use you, and persecute you: That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to rise on the Evil &amp; on the Good, and sendeth Rain on the just and on the unjust.</HI> They are inwardly touch'd with a feeling of the Miseries of others, and inclin'd to shew Compassion in Obe∣dience to God's Word. Luk. 6.36. <HI>Be ye merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</HI> They are of a for∣bearing forgiving Spirit, in some Measure as God is.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004196_0008_1003FD8FE3BF4690"/>And then, they behave with becoming Reverence and Subjection, with relation to the <HI>incommunicable Perfections</HI> of God. As God is <HI>infinite</HI> in his Being, and all his divine Excellencies, they <HI>bow down</HI> be∣fore Him in religious Adoration, and pay Him <HI>divine Honour.</HI> As He is God <HI>most High,</HI> they walk <HI>humbly</HI> with him; <HI>resign</HI> themselves, and all their Concerns to his <HI>sovereign Will.</HI> If God call them to deny themselves, and take up their Cross, they learn of <HI>Christ</HI> to say, <HI>O my Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> Is God <HI>Omnipresent?</HI> They take care to Walk before Him, and be perfect. Is God <HI>Eternal</HI> &amp; <HI>Unchangeable?</HI> they rest upon Him as the <HI>Rock of Ages,</HI> under the <HI>Changes</HI> of this Life; they trust not in the uncertain perishing Enjoy∣ments of this passing World; but in the living God, who is the <HI>same, yesterday, to day, and for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Godly and Faithful are true and upright in the Covenant of their God, and in their Behaviour towards Him.</HI></P>
<P>They believe that <HI>God is,</HI> and that he is a <HI>Re∣warder</HI> of them that diligently <HI>seek him.</HI> They re∣ceive his Word as the Word of <HI>God that can't Lie;</HI> and in Obedience to it, give up themselves to the only true and <HI>living God,</HI> who is the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> in the <HI>New and Everlasting Covenant,</HI> to be for Him and no other. And this they do in the Exercise of <HI>true Repen∣tance, unfeigned Faith,</HI> and <HI>Love without Dissimulation.</HI> They cleave to God with purpose of Heart, ob∣serving that first and great Commandment, <HI>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</HI> Mat. 22.37, 8. And having Sworn with all the Heart, they resolve, with an entire Dependance on the Grace of God, as Psal. 119.106 <HI>I have sworn, and I will
<PB N="8" REF="004196_0009_1003FD3542B83678"/>
perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments.</HI> As the Lord is the true and faithful God, who keep∣eth Covenant, so these abhor the Hypocrisy men∣tioned, Psal. 78.36, 7.— <HI>They did flatter him with their Mouth, and lied to him with their Tongues.</HI> It is true, they are not altogether without Guile in this Life, as the Man Christ Jesus was. They know but in Part, &amp; are sanctified in Part; however, they serve God with a perfect Heart in Gospel-sincerity, having <HI>Respect to all his Commandments,</HI> &amp; <HI>hating every false Way.</HI> And they mourn for the remaining Hypocrisy of their Hearts, with that <HI>godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance.</HI> They are not of double Heart, pre∣tending to have an Heart for God, and yet retain∣ing an Heart for the World. They realize what our Lord declareth, Mat. 6.24. <HI>No Man can serve two Masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</HI> And act accordingly, renouncing the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. Their <HI>secret Sins</HI> are their burden, and they bewail them before God; even those evil Thoughts and Inclinations which never appear before Men in overt Acts. They set themselves against all Sin, sensible that such as willingly offend in <HI>one Point,</HI> are guilty of <HI>all.</HI> Yea, in faithfulness to God, and their Covenant Engagements, they cut off the right Hand, and pluck out the right Eye, which offend them, seeking the Destruction of those Lusts which have been most near and dear to them. They sincerely endeavour to lay aside the Sin which most easily besets them, and can in some true Mea∣sure say, as Psal. 18.23. <HI>I was upright before him; and I kept my self from mine Iniquity.</HI> However, finding Sin still cleaving to them and defiling them, they cry out, as Rom. 7.24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this Death!</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="004196_0010_1003FD93D8F148D0"/>
But tho' they complain with the Apostle <HI>Paul, I find a Law that when I would do Good, Evil is present with me;</HI> yet they can say also with him, <HI>I delight in the Law of God, after the inner Man.</HI></P>
<P>Again, they <HI>worship God,</HI> who is a Spirit, <HI>in Spi∣rit and Truth.</HI> They attend <HI>secret Duties</HI> in since∣rity; Secret Prayer, Self-Examination &amp;c; and this not meerly to still the clamours of an accusing Conscience; but that they may walk with that God who is and seeth in Secret, and maintain in∣timate Communion with him. And when they attend the <HI>publick Worship,</HI> they are not as those, Jer. 12.2. <HI>Thou art near in their Mouths, and far from their Reins;</HI> for they believe those Words of their Lord, Rev. 2.23. <HI>All the Churches shall know that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e which searcheth the Reins and Hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works.</HI> And then, they endeavour to keep the <HI>Or∣dinances</HI> of divine Worship <HI>pure,</HI> without corrupt¦ing them with humane Inventions; and also to walk in them <HI>all</HI> blameless. Upon the whole, they abhor the baseness of serving the faithful God with a false Heart; and are also sensible of the high Presumption of attempting this, considering that all Things are open and naked before Him: And therefore breathe out that Prayer, Psal. 26.1, 2. <HI>Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my inte∣grity: I have trusted also in the Lord: therefore I shall not slide. Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my Reins and my Heart.</HI> They do not take up their Religion to serve worldly Views and Inte∣rests, and go so far only in it as will suit the Times; but labour to approve themselves Faithful to their great Lord and Master whatever it cost them. In a Word, <HI>Herein do they Exercise themselves to have al∣ways a Conscience void of Offence toward God, and to∣wards Men.</HI> They abide in the <HI>Calling</HI> wherein they
<PB N="10" REF="004196_0011_1003FD3B8CBB1FF0"/>
are calle'd, faithfully discharging the Duties of it, and improving their Talents in the Service of their Lord: And when prov'd by <HI>fiery Trials,</HI> they imitate faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> who <HI>when tried, offered up Isaac,</HI> Heb. 11.17. And thus do they conti∣nue Faithful unto Death.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Godly and Faithful, are Men of Integrity and Honesty with regard to their Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord teacheth us that the second is like to the first and great Commandment—<HI>Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy self,</HI> Mat. 22.39. And the Faithful have accordingly a sincere Regard to this Command of the Law. They love their Brother <HI>not in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth.</HI> They do not speak Vanity with flattering Lips and a double Heart; but <HI>putting away Lying, speak every Man Truth with his Neighbour.</HI> You may depend upon their Word, their Promises, and their Professions of Friendship. You have their Character drawn to the Life, in the Description which the royal Psalmist gives of a Citizen of Zion, Psal. 15.2, 3, 4, 5. <HI>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh Righteousness, and speaketh the Truth in his Heart. He that backbiteth not with his Tongue, nor doth Evil to his Neighbour, nor taketh up a Reproach against his Neighbour. In whose Eyes a vile Person is contemned; but he honoureth them that feareth the Lord: he that sweareth to his own Hurt, and chang∣eth not. He that putteth not out his Money to Usury, nor taketh Reward against the Innocent.</HI> They seek not their <HI>own only;</HI> but also their <HI>Neighbour's Wealth;</HI> and endeavour in sincerity to observe that golden Rule laid down by Christ, Mat. 7.12. <HI>There∣fore all Things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.</HI> Their Regard to their Neigh∣bour's
<PB N="11" REF="004196_0012_1003FD9B10942400"/>
Welfare is sincere, as to their own; not <HI>e∣qual</HI> in Degree, but <HI>alike</HI> for Kind. And they en∣deavour that their Love may bear a just Proportion to the nearness of the Relation they stand in to him. They bear an hearty Good-Will to their Neighbour respecting the great Concerns of his Soul, and express it in their faithful Counsels, Re∣proofs &amp;c. as they have Ability and Opportunity. They will rather hazard their Neighbour's Displea∣sure, than suffer Sin upon him. Lev. 19.17. <HI>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thine Heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer Sin upon him.</HI> At the same time, they are tender of his good Name, and will not seek to blast his Re∣putation, and hurt his Usefulness, by Backbiting and Defaming him. And then, in their Trade and Commerce, they observe the Warning given, I Thess. 4.6. <HI>That no Man go beyond and defraud his Brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such.</HI> And if in any Instance they have injured him, when they return to them∣selves, they will be ready to confess their Sin be∣fore God, and to give proper Satisfaction to their Neighbour, for the wrong done him.</P>
<P>In a Word, If they undertake any weighty Affair, they will rather expose themselves to Hard∣ships, then betray a Trust committed to them, or not answer the just Expectation of those that Employ them. They prefer the publick Weal, <HI>the Peace of Jerusalem,</HI> before their own <HI>private</HI> secular <HI>Interests;</HI> and accordingly, lay out themselves to serve their People, in the <HI>Places</HI> in which <HI>divine Providence</HI> hath set them.</P>
<P>Thus I have in some imperfect Manner given you the Character of the Godly and Faithful.</P>
<P>We proceed to say,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="004196_0013_1003FA0709833610"/>II. <HI>The Godly may cease, and the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>This may be said of them, when through the Corruption of the Times, they are hindred from serving God, and their Generation. Prov 28.12. —<HI>When the Wicked rise, a Man is hidden.</HI> And this may be one Thing intended in that propheti∣cal Description, which we have of the <HI>slaying of the Witnesses,</HI> Rev. 11. While some are in a literal Sense slain for the Testimony of Jesus; others may be slain <Q>politically and civilly; depos'd, silenc'd, imprison'd, and laid aside as useless and dead.</Q> And in this sense some of the Godly might cease and fail under <HI>Saul</HI>'s Male-Administration; as o∣thers were put to Death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 22.18.</NOTE> But that which I would briefly consider at this Time is, <HI>Their ceasing and failing by a natural Death.</HI> The Godly and Faith∣ful must dye out of this World, as well as others. In this respect, there's <HI>one Event to the Righteous, and the Wicked.</HI> The Godly have <HI>sinn'd,</HI> and must therefore <HI>taste of Death,</HI> and thro' this <HI>dark Valley</HI> follow their Lord to <HI>Glory.</HI> And when they die, their Opportunities of serving God and his People in this Life, fail and cease. Agreably, when that good King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had receiv'd the Sentence of Death, he lamented and said, as Isai. 38.11. <HI>I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the Living: I shall behold Man no more with the Inha∣bitants of the World.</HI> And we have that Exhorta∣tion, Luk. 16.9. <HI>Make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness; that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting Habitations.</HI> At Death, Flesh and Heart fail, Friends, Estates, and all earthly Comforts fail. <HI>As we brought nothing into
<PB N="13" REF="004196_0014_1003FD9C93D06B10"/>
this World with us, so it is certain we can carry no∣thing out.</HI> Yea, the faithful Servants of God are bereav'd of their present Advantages of glorifying God, and promoting the Good of his People. This made the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> say, Phil. 1.23, 4. <HI>I am in a strait betwixt two, having a Desire to depart and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with Christ; which is far better: Nevertheless, to a∣bide in the Flesh, is more needful for you.</HI> The good and <HI>faithful</HI> Servants, as well as the wicked and <HI>slothful,</HI> are call'd to give up an Account, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.19,—30. Tho' the Manner and Event of their doing this, are vastly distant: The faithful Servant doth it with Joy unspeakable and glorious; the Wicked with unutterable Grief and Confusion. However, they are dismiss'd from their Work, one as well as the other. Dan. 12.13. <HI>Go thou thy way, for thou shalt Rest.</HI> The Godly are call'd off from the toilsome Labours and Sufferings of this Life, and taken up to the more excellent Work, and to the glorious Rewards of Heaven.

So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear what Man shall do unto me.</HI> And here, there's a vehement Negation, by a Multiplication of nega∣tive Particles. And the Design, says an excellent Expositor, "is to obviate all Objections which Fear and Unbelief might raise". And indeed the gra∣cious Presence of God, and his divine Assistance are all in all. When the <HI>Cisterns</HI> are broken, this <HI>Fountain</HI> abides the same, to supply the Wants of God's People from it's inexhaustible Fulness. The living and true God hath infinite Knowlege and Wisdom to direct his People in the darkest Times, and to lead them in a plain Path under the most perplexing Difficulties, when they know not what to do, and lift up their Eyes to Him. <HI>The Lord is wonderful in Counsel, and excellent in Working,</HI> Isai. 28.29. Yea, <HI>There is no Wisdom nor Understanding, nor Counsel against the Lord,</HI> Prov 21.30. None that

If he please to work out the Salvation of his People, none can hinder him. <HI>Mountains</HI> shall become a <HI>Plain,</HI> and <HI>crooked</HI> Things <HI>Straight.</HI> And then, under the sor∣rowful <HI>Changes</HI> which pass over his People, <HI>He</HI> a∣bides the same.

Thus God rais'd <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses</HI> to lead his ancient People out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thro' the Wilderness: And then <HI>Joshua,</HI> in Name and Office a Type of Christ, to con∣duct them into <HI>Canaan.</HI> God chose <HI>David</HI> his Ser∣vant, and bro't him to seed <HI>Jacob</HI> his People; yea, enabled him to <HI>Feed them according to the Integrity of his Heart, and to guide them by the Skilfulness of his Hands.</HI> When <HI>Elijah</HI> was Translated, the Spirit rested on <HI>Elisha.</HI> God said to his People of old, Amos 2 11. <HI>I raised up of your Sons for Prophets, and of your young Men for Nazarites.</HI> And when our Sa∣viour

<P>And when his People grow degenerate, and are <HI>fallen by their Iniquities;</HI> God is able to <HI>Exalt them by Righteousness,</HI> and to revive his Work in every Order and Degree of Persons among them, by pouring out his Spirit upon them. Isai. 32.15,—18. <HI>Until the Spirit be pour'd upon us from on High —Then Judgment shall dwell in the Wilder∣ness, and Righteousness remain in the fruitful Field. And the Work of Righteousness shall be Peace, and the Effect of Righteousness, Quietness and Assurance for ever.</HI> Ezek. 36.25,—28 <HI>Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your Filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you. A new Heart also will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony Heart out of your Flesh, and I will give you an Heart of Flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my Judgments, and do them. And ye shall dwell in the Land that I gave to your Fathers, and ye shall be my People, and I will be your God.</HI> And 'tis added, ver. 37. —<HI>I will for this be enquired of by the House of Israel</HI>—</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we here see that it is our Duty to make known our Requests to God, and cry to Him for Help, when the Godly cease, and Faithful fail from among us. When we have sorrowful Occasion to take up those Words, Zech. 1.5. <HI>Your Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever?</HI> We must go to that God with whom the <HI>Fatherless find Mercy,</HI> and encourage our selve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

in this way to wait for his Salvation, who is the <HI>God that heareth Prayer.</HI> And the <HI>Promises</HI> of God's Word should excite us to lift up the Hands which hang down, when we may be ready to faint, and wax weary in our Minds. And when the Sense of our Unworthiness may be apt to dishearten us, then should we look to <HI>Jesus, who ever lives to make In∣tercession;</HI> and take care to ask in his <HI>Name,</HI> who hath said, <HI>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</HI> Let us then pray with∣out ceasing to that God who is a present Help to his People in their Times of Trouble. Psal. 62 8. <HI>Trust in him at all Times, ye People, pour out your Heart before him: God is a Refuge for us.</HI></P>

<P>USE. I. From the Character given of the Godly and Faithful, we learn, <HI>that they are truly Excellent, and worthy of our high Esteem.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Psalmist</HI> speaking of the Saints, calls them <HI>the Excellent in whom was all his Delight,</HI> Psal 16.3. This is indeed the chief Glory of Man, to imitate God in his imitable Perfections and Actions; and to be conform'd to the Image of his Son, who is the <HI>first born among many Brethren.</HI> To <HI>fear God, and keep his Commandments is the whole Duty of Man,</HI> Eccl. 12.13. The <HI>whole</HI> of Man. "His whole Work and Business, his whole Perfection and Happiness". The Ornaments of true Grace are of great Price in the Sight of God, whose Judgment must be right. And accordingly, the Word of God assureth us, that <HI>his Countenance beholds the Upright.</HI> i. e. with Approbation and Delight, <HI>Psal.</HI> 11.7. And that the <HI>Lord hath set apart him that is Godly for himself,</HI> Psal. 4.3. These faithful Servants are indeed the Friends of our Lord Jesus Christ. Joh.

15.15.— <HI>I have called you Friends.</HI> Now, what shall be done to these Men whom this King of Glo∣ry delighteth to Honour? <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</HI> 1 Cor. 29. How wonderful is that Expression! above our Thoughts as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, Luk. 12.37. <HI>He</HI> (the Lord) <HI>shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to Meat, and will come forth and serve them.</HI> They are Vessels unto Honour in this Life, sanctified and meet for the Maste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Use; and the Lord will make known the Riches of his Glory on them another Day. They Honour God by their faithful Obedience, and He hath said, <HI>Them that Honour me, I will Honour.</HI> Let us then <HI>Honour them that Fear the Lord,</HI> while with us; and let their Memory be pre∣cious to us, when they are taken from us by Death. Prov. 10.7. <HI>The Memory of the Just is blessed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By what hath been said of the Cha∣racter of the Godly and Faithful; <HI>We may Examine our selves, whether we are of their Number.</HI></P>
<P>We have that Command in God's Word, 2 Cor. 13 5. <HI>Examine your selves — prove your own selves—.</HI> And 'tis a Matter of great Concern that we obey it, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in the most weighty Affair that can be, we deceive our selves. Let us then make a strict and impartial Inquiry, whether the Image of God be drawn upon our Souls, and whether we are faith∣ful to God and our Neighbour, in the Course of our Lives, without governing Fraud and Deceit. And whereas God's Word, which is Truth, assureth us that <HI>the Heart is deceitful above all Things,</HI> let us, after our best Endeavours us'd <HI>to know our selves,</HI> make that <HI>Prayer</HI> to Him who searcheth the Heart, Psal. 139.23, 24. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my

Heart: try me, and know my Thoughts, and see if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way everlasting.</HI> Let us beseech the Lord to <HI>shine</HI> upon his own Work, if he hath wrought it in us; and to give us his Spirit, <HI>to bear Witness with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God.</HI> Thus we shall have the Peace of the Upright, and shall be animated to <HI>press toward the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Christ Jesus.</HI> Let us also Pray, that if a <HI>deceived Heart hath turned us aside,</HI> we may know it while the Day of Grace is conti∣nued to us; that being mov'd with Fear of having our portion with <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> we may be quickned to seek of God a <HI>perfect Heart.</HI> Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us in the diligent use of Means, <HI>Seek the excellent Graces, and holy Dispositions, which constitute the Character of the Godly and Faithful.</HI></P>
<P>We are required to <HI>covet earnestly the best Gifts,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.31. The Word signifies to be zealously affected towards a Thing, so as to pursue it with fervency of Spirit. And thus we should, according to the Ability and Advantages God affords us, en∣deavour to accomplish our selves with all useful Knowledge, whereby we may be fitted to serve God and our Generation. Prov. 18.1. <HI>Thro' De∣sire a Man having separated himself, seeketh and in∣termedleth with all Wisdom.</HI> But then, we must heed∣fully observe what follows in the last Clause of 1 Cor. 12.31. foremention'd—<HI>And yet shew I unto you a more excellent Way.</HI> And then the Apostle declares in the 13th. Ch. ver. 1, 2. <HI>Tho' I speak with the Tongue of Men, and of Angels, and have not Cha∣rity, I am become as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounding Brass, or a tinkling Cymbal And though I have the Gifts of Prophecy, and understand all Mysteries, and all Knowledge; and though I have all Faith, so that I could remove

Mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing.</HI> Now, the Love here described and commended, is the fulfilling of the Law, the Sum of true Godliness. Or in other Words, which signify much the same in Scripture Language. This is that Fear of the Lord which is the <HI>beginning of Wisdom:</HI> "The In∣troduction to it, or chief Part of it"; and there∣fore that Advice is faithful, and worthy of all Ac∣ceptation. Prov. 4.7.—<HI>Get Wisdom; and with all thy getting, get Understanding.</HI> Without this, what∣ever Knowledge we may obtain, we must die with∣out Wisdom; and perish in that Folly which ends in blackness of Darkness for ever.</P>
<P>I would therefore, in a particular. Manner, direct this <HI>Exhortation</HI> to the <HI>Students of the College.</HI> Be earnest with God to give you <HI>Truth in the inward Parts;</HI> and that in the <HI>hidden Part,</HI> He would▪ <HI>make you to know Wisdom.</HI> Thus <HI>Solomon</HI> while Young, ask'd Wisdom. 1 King. 3.9. <HI>Give thy Ser∣vant an understanding Heart</HI>—. i. e. says a worthy Expositor, "whereby I may clearly discern, and faithfully perform all the Parts of my Duty". God highly approv'd the Choice, gave him his Request, and together with it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at which he had not asked, <HI>Riches and Honour.</HI> And a greater than <HI>Solomon,</HI> even the Great God our Saviour, says to you, Mat. 6.33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righte∣ousness, and all these Things shall be added unto you,</HI> O be perswaded then, sensible of the deep Corruption of your Hearts, and of the great Folly bound up in them since the Fall, to ask this Wisdom of God, who <HI>giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</HI> Obey that Command, Mat. 6 6. <HI>Enter into thy Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>set, and when thou hast shut thy Door, pray to thy Father, which is in secret</HI>—. And in Prayer, beseech the Lord to give you a wise and understanding Heart, that

you may make haste to keep his Commandments. Take <HI>the Wings of the Morning,</HI> and fly to Jesus Christ: Seek a saving Interest in Him without de∣lay, <HI>in whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge,</HI> and who speaks to you, as Prov. 8.17. <HI>I Love them that Love me, and tbose that seek me Early shall find me. Search the Scriptures,</HI> in which you have the <HI>Doctrine according to Godliness,</HI> and make them your daily Study and Meditation. La∣bour to know them from your Childhood; <HI>for they are able to make wise unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Christ Jesus.</HI> And of these sacred Wri∣tings the Apostle gives us that Encomium, 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. <HI>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor∣rection, for Instruction in Righteousness: That the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto every good Work.</HI> But then, you must remember that <HI>the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; neither can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e know them, because they art spiritually discerned,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.14. You need the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, who <HI>in∣spir'd</HI> those <HI>holy Men</HI> that deliver'd God's Word unto us, to give you the saving Knowledge of it. <HI>Great is the Mystery of Godliness.</HI> And therefore you must pray, that <HI>the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, wou'd give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, in the Knowledge of him: The Eyes of your Understanding being enlightened.</HI> Ask the Spirit then, that you may know the Truth as it is in Jesus Seek that you may receive the <HI>Anointing which teacheth you of all Things.</HI> Be ear∣nestly concerned for the fulfilment of that precious Promise to you, Jer. 31.33.— <HI>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts;</HI> that you may he declar'd to be the <HI>Epistle of Christ, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living

Death,</HI> which entred into the World by Sin, <HI>pours</HI> out the most <HI>valuable Lives,</HI> as Water spilt on the Ground; and <HI>removeth them that stood in the Gap before God for the Land, that he should not destroy it.</HI> Let us know therefore and see, that 'tis an <HI>Evil and bitter Thing,</HI> that we have <HI>forsaken the Lord</HI> our God by Sin; let there be a great Mourn∣ing upon the account of this Evil; and let <HI>Christ</HI> be most <HI>precious</HI> to us, because He <HI>saves his People from their Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Must the Godly cease, and Faithful fail; <HI>Let this quicken them to do all the Good they can; and ex∣cite us to be getting Good from them, in the present Life.</HI></P>
<P>Let this Mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. Joh. 9. 4. <HI>I must work the Works of him that sent me, while it is Day: the Night cometh when no Man can work.</HI> And go about doing Good, in some Measure as he did. Discharge the <HI>Duties</HI> of your general, and particular <HI>Calling,</HI> mindful of that Word, Rom. 12. 11. <HI>Not slothful in Bu∣siness, fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord. Let your Light so shine before Men, that they may see your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Study, and use your best Endeavours, to be Blessings in your Families, in the Church and common Wealth. Consider the <HI>Talents</HI> which God hath put into your Hands, and occupy with them; al∣ways bearing in Mind the Account which you must give to God. <HI>Sow bountifully,</HI> that you may <HI>reap bountifully.</HI> Exercise the <HI>Charity,</HI> or Love, <HI>which never faileth.</HI> And remember to improve those <HI>Graces</HI> which must <HI>cease,</HI> as to their <HI>present Exercise;</HI> tho' in their <HI>Habit,</HI> they shall <HI>abide for ever. Faith,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="004196_0028_1003FDBE9E79D1A0"/>
as it is the <HI>Evidence of Things not seen,</HI> shall be <HI>per∣fected</HI> in <HI>Vision; Hope in full Enjoyment</HI> of the Good hop'd for. <HI>Live then, and Well by Faith</HI> now; and put on for an <HI>Helmet,</HI> the <HI>Hope of Salvation. Godly Sorrow, Patience, and Self-Denial,</HI> will cease <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to their Operations, in that blessed World, where <HI>Sin and Misery</HI> have <HI>no Place.</HI> Now then, let these <HI>excellent Graces</HI> have their <HI>perfect Work;</HI> and do not repine nor faint, tho' God call you to the frequent Exercise of them; for <HI>our light Affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory; While we look not at the Things which are seen, but at the Things which are not seen: for the Things which are seen are temporal; but the Things which are not seen, are eternal,</HI> 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18.</P>
<P>Again, Let this Consideration excite us to be <HI>getting Good by the Faithful,</HI> while they are continued with us. Let us <HI>hearken</HI> to their <HI>Counsels,</HI> and <HI>follow</HI> their <HI>Examples, so far as they follow Jesus Christ.</HI> Let their <HI>Presence</HI> with us be <HI>valued</HI> as a <HI>Blessing;</HI> and their <HI>Departure</HI> be duly <HI>resented</HI> as a <HI>Loss,</HI> by which God calls us to Weeping and Mourning. And this brings me to the last Use.</P>
<P N="6">6. When the Godly cease, and Faithful fail by Death; <HI>It is our Duty to lay it to Heart, to humble our selves under the mighty Hand of God, and to Cry to Him for Help.</HI></P>
<P>The Words of our <HI>Text,</HI> were <HI>written for our Learning;</HI> and we have here the <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>in∣spired Psalmist</HI> set before us, for our <HI>Imitation.</HI> And indeed we might well look upon it as an ill-boding Symptom, if none should lay it to Heart, when the Godly are remov'd by Death. Isai. 57. 1. <HI>The Righteous perisheth, and no Man layeth it to Heart; and merciful Men are taken away, none considering
<PB N="28" REF="004196_0029_1003FD5C8E527160"/>
that the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then bear our Part in the Sorrows of this <HI>mournful Day,</HI> in which the godly Man ceaseth, and the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men, in the <HI>Death</HI> of the Reverend and Excellent: Mr. BENJAMIN WADSWORTH, our Honoured President; who after a long Course of Labours and Sufferings, had the <HI>Shadows of Death</HI> turn'd, in a good Mea∣sure, into the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Morning,</HI> by <HI>God's Coun∣tenance</HI> shining upon him. <HI>Mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright: for the End of that Man is Peace.</HI></P>
<P>He was descended from <HI>worthy Parents.</HI> His Fa∣ther was Slain, with Others, on the high Places of the Field, bravely Fighting, at the Head of his Company, against the <HI>Indian Enemy.</HI> This his <HI>se∣venth Son</HI> was put to the <HI>College</HI> some time after his Father's Death. And as he had been favour'd with a liberal Education, was a Person considerable for substantial and useful Learning. His favourite Study was <HI>Divinity:</HI> And it must be acknowledg∣ed that he was an orthodox and judicious <HI>Divine,</HI> well accomplished and spirited for the Work of the Ministry. This, his <HI>Labours</HI> with his beloved <HI>Flock</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He was Ordain'd a Pastor of the first Church in <HI>Boston, September 8th.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>696.</NOTE>, and his <HI>printed Works</HI> testify. His <HI>Prayers</HI> were devout and fervent. His <HI>Sermons</HI> were deli∣ver'd from a strong and faithful Memory; and of∣ten with <HI>that Affection,</HI> which had an happy ten∣dency, by God's Blessing, to enkindle the <HI>like Flame</HI> in the Hearts of his Hearers. His <HI>Preaching</HI> was plain and practical, scriptural and powerful. <HI>In Doctrine,</HI> He <HI>shewed Uncorruptness, Gravity, Sin∣cerity, sound Speech that cannot be condemned.</HI> And
<PB N="29" REF="004196_0030_1003FA1889CDD788"/>
If you consider him as a <HI>Textuary,</HI> I suppose it will be granted, that he was second to few, if any; having laid up God's Word in his Heart, and being able to bring forth out of this <HI>good Treasure,</HI> in a rich abundance. He was diligent to know the State of his <HI>Flock,</HI> and looked well to them, feeding both the Sheep and Lambs, from Love to Christ. He taught <HI>publickly,</HI> and <HI>from House to House.</HI> He vi∣sited the <HI>Fatherless and Widows</HI> in their Affliction; and was ready to shew his pious and charitable Compassions, to the Souls and Bodies of Men, as their Circumstances call'd for it. And in other Instances of <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>undefil'd Religion,</HI> was it his Care to <HI>live</HI> as well as <HI>preach</HI> the Gospel, being an <HI>excellent Christian.</HI> He might with Propriety use those Words, <HI>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. Being an Example of the Believers, in Word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</HI></P>
<P>Nor were his Cares and Labours <HI>confined</HI> to his <HI>own Flock:</HI> The <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>other Churches</HI> came upon him; and he was ready, as there was Occasion, to shew his zealous Affection for the Interests of Christ's Kingdom among us. Yea, His <HI>Heart</HI> was much engag'd in <HI>sending</HI> the <HI>Gospel</HI> to <HI>dark Places,</HI> destitute of so great a Blessing; and he employ'd an <HI>active Hand,</HI> in that <HI>excellent Work.</HI></P>
<P>He was held in Esteem for his prudent &amp; faith∣ful <HI>Advice,</HI> in <HI>Cases of Conscience</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Guide to the Doubting</HI>—with the Preface.</NOTE>, and other diffi∣cult Matters. And we may now justly take up that Lamentation, Isai. 3.1, 2. <HI>Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts doth take away—the Prophet and the Prudent, and the Ancient</HI>—.</P>
<P>His Translation to the <HI>President's Chair</HI> in the <HI>College</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anno</HI> 1725.</NOTE>, was in the decline of Life: And it is
<PB N="30" REF="004196_0031_1003FD615E38B990"/>
tho't, that then entring upon a Work new and difficult, with too intense Labour and close Appli∣cation, He broke his Constitution. However, un∣der this great disadvantage, his Zeal for the Glory of God, and great Regard to the Welfare of the <HI>College,</HI> carried him almost beyond himself; so that I think I may say, that <HI>to his Power, yea and beyond his Power, he was willing to spend and be spent,</HI> in the Service of that <HI>Society.</HI> He was constant, when the state of his Health would in any Measure allow of it, in performing the religious Exercises of the <HI>Hall;</HI> and laborious in them, often expounding the Scriptures. And how careful &amp; concern'd was he that the <HI>College</HI> might receive Damage in none of its Interests! How unwearied in attending the Business of it, even when his bodily Infirmities urged him to spare himself! For the Proof of these Things, I might appeal to <HI>Witnesses</HI> here present, and to the <HI>Books</HI> and Records of the <HI>College,</HI> where, if I mistake not, stand some peculiar Monuments of his laborious Diligence. Indeed, I can't but appre∣hend that the Power of God was magnified in his Weakness; in that, under such frequent Returns of Pain, he was so far strengthned and spirited to his Work; particularly, in the <HI>extreme Cold</HI> of the last <HI>Winter.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did this <HI>faithful Servant</HI> follow his <HI>Lord</HI> in active and passive Obedience. And his bountiful Master gave him some <HI>Earnests</HI> of his Reward be∣fore his Departure: And now, we have abundant Reason to believe that his Rest is glorious in the heavenly <HI>Paradise,</HI> where <HI>God wipes away all Tears from the Eyes of his People;</HI> and there shall be <HI>no more Death,</HI> neither <HI>Sorrow,</HI> nor <HI>Crying,</HI> neither shall there be <HI>any more Pain: for the farmer Things are passed away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="004196_0032_1003FA3F635BF0E0"/>And being <HI>dead,</HI> he <HI>yet speaketh;</HI> and as it were calls to us not to be <HI>offended in Christ,</HI> because of the Cross; for there is <HI>a Reward for the Righteous,</HI> and his Expectation shall not be cut off; no, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t done, while God Rewards according to his <HI>Riches in Glory by Jesus Christ.</HI> Let us then ascribe the Glory of all to God; and encourage our selves to be <HI>Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</HI></P>
<P>Let the <HI>mournful Relatives</HI> sorrow not, as others which have no Hope. <HI>For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again, even so them also which Sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</HI> And their <HI>perfected Spirits</HI> shall re-enter these <HI>vile Bodies,</HI> which shall then be <HI>chang'd</HI> and <HI>fashioned like to Christ's glorious Body;</HI> that they may receive their full Reward, and <HI>ever be with the Lord. Comfort your selves therefore, and one another</HI> with these Words.</P>
<P>To conclude, The Duty which remains to us, is to regard the <HI>Operation</HI> of <HI>God's Hand,</HI> and to make a wise Improvement of his <HI>holy Providence.</HI> Let us then cry after this Servant of God, as 2 Kin. 2 12. <HI>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof.</HI> For know it, such Persons, tho' we here behold the Infirmities of their Flesh, are no small Part of the Strength and Beauty, Defence and Glory of our <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>And then, let us beseech the Lord to <HI>find a Man to stand in the Gap.</HI> May the <HI>Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning, shine</HI> upon the <HI>School of the Prophets</HI> in this <HI>dark Day.</HI></P>
<P>May those to whom is committed the Instruction and Government of the Youth, faithfully and suc∣cessfully attend that excellent Work. May the <HI>Sons of the Prophets</HI> receive the <HI>Unction of the Holy One.</HI> May the <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Evangelical <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI> determine <HI>not to know any Thing, save Jesus
<PB N="32" REF="004196_0033_1003FD66A23C9278"/>
Christ, and him Crucified.</HI> May all their Gifts be sanctified by His Spirit, and consecrated to his Ser∣vice. And may they follow that <HI>Prince of Shepherds,</HI> in His Zeal for the House of God, and Love to the Souls of Men. May the <HI>God of the Sprits of all Flesh, repair</HI> the <HI>Breach</HI> which he hath made, in great Favour to the College, to our Churches, and this Land. And may this <HI>Society</HI> live before God, and flourish under his peculiar Care and Blessing, till the second Coming of our Lord. I conclude with those Words, Joh. 12.26. <HI>If any Man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my Servant be: If any Man serve me, him will my Father honour.</HI> Rev. 2. 10. <HI>Fear none of those Things which thou shalt suffer—: Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 Tim. IV. 6, 7, 8.</BIBL>
<Q><P>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</P>
<P>I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith.</P>
<P>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righte∣ousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto all them that love his Appearing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Epistle of the blessed Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> (in which he gives such an agreable Account of himself) all agree was writ∣ten from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> his beloved Son in the Faith. But whether it was the first, or the second Time of his going thither, and appearing before <HI>Cesar,</HI> is not so certain. A learned Expositor has in his Preface to this Epistle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Hammond.</NOTE>, offered many considerable Arguments to prove that this was the first time of his being at <HI>Rome.</HI> But the Verses that I have now read, and some other Verses in
<PB N="2" REF="004196_0036_1003FD6C308BE6F8"/>
this Epistle together with the Postscript, have in∣duced the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erality of learned Men to conclude that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tten the last time he came thither, and when he had the near and certain Prospect of his Death.</P>
<P>But when this Epistle was written is not so much my present Purpose, as the Things which are contained in the Verses now before us. And I think they may all be reduced to these three general Heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Apostles <HI>Apprehension of himself</HI> with re∣spect to his <HI>present</HI> State, namely <HI>that he was now upon the very brink of Death,</HI> expressed in those Words, <HI>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>His peaceful, and comfortable Reflection upon the past Conduct of himself in the Course of his Life,</HI> in those Words, <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>His pleasing Prospect, and joyful Expectation of what he and other Saints should meet with hereafter. —Thenceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his Appearing.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And these are accordingly the three general Heads, which I propose for the Subject of our se∣rious Meditation at this time.</P>
<P N="1">I. I shall consider the Apostle's <HI>Apprehension of himself with respect to his present State,</HI> namely <HI>that he was now upon the very brink of Death.—I am now ready to he offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Apostle is here plainly speaking of his Death; so what I would observe under this ge∣neral Head, is,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="004196_0037_1003FDCB0D576BA8"/>1. <HI>The Account he gives of Death, or the Manner in which he describes it, viz</HI> as an OFFERING, and a DEPARTURE.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The full Apprehension he had of the near Approach of his Death, or Departure; that he looked upon it to be at Hand, ready even then to come upon him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Calmness, the Easiness, and Freedom, with which he seems to speak or write of if.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us consider the Account the Apostle gives of Death, or the Manner in which he describes it,</HI> viz. <HI>as an</HI> Offering, <HI>and a</HI> departure.</P>
<P>I am ready to be <HI>Offered,</HI> and my <HI>Departure;</HI>— which refer to his Death. So then,</P>
<P N="1">1. He calls it an <HI>Offering,</HI> or <HI>pouring out;</HI> for so it is in the Original, <HI>I am now already poured out</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">gap DESC="foreign"</NOTE>. It is observed to be the same Word that is used, for the <HI>Drink-Offerings</HI> under the Law, which were won't to be <HI>poured out.</HI> Hence the Word, in the Septuagint or Greek Translation for <HI>Drink-Offering;</HI> is derived from the same Word that the Apostle here useth <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb 28.7.</NOTE>. And the Apostle, if he apprehended with what Death he should glorify God, might consider it as a sort of Sacrifice, not by way of Expiation or Atonement; (for there was a sufficiency of that for the greatest Sins, in the Sacrifice that Christ once made of himself) but in confirmation of the Truth of the Gospel which he bore Testimo∣ny to, and was now about to Seal with his Blood. Hence the Word is observed to refer to such Offer∣ings as were for the Confirmation of some Cove∣nant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Leigh, Cri. Sac.</NOTE>. And the Apostle speaks in the same Dialect concerning his Death, to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Ch. 2.17. If I <HI>be offered</HI> (the same Word) upon the Sacrifice and Service of your Faith. Thus the Apostle, we may suppose, looks upon his Death in this View,
<PB N="4" REF="004196_0038_1003FD6EC83C69E8"/>
even as an offering up of his Life to God; and that he does this very freely and readily, considering what a Testimony he should hereby give, and what a Confirmation it would be of the Truth of the Gospel, that new Covenant of Grace, which he had been preaching to the World, ever since his Conversion to the christian Faith.</P>
<P>But then, if we consider the <HI>Word,</HI> according to the literal Meaning of it, viz. <HI>a pouring forth;</HI> it may serve to give us some Idea of Death, which is the <HI>pouring forth</HI> of Life. For the Life goes forth at Death; and in a sudden and violent Death, it may be said to be poured out, in a full continued Stream; and not by Drops, as in a lingring Death. Thus the Blood, which is called the Life of the Beast, was to be poured out<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xii 16.</NOTE>; when the Beast was killed for Sacrifice, or for Food. And it was pro∣phesyed concerning Christ, that he should pour out his Soul unto Death<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isaiah liii 12.</NOTE>. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apostle according to the common Tran∣slation, here speaks of Death as a DIPARTURE. <HI>My Departure is at Hand.</HI></P>
<P>And Death may very properly be called a <HI>De∣parture.</HI> For at Death the Soul departs; it departs from the Body, and takes its leave of it for the present. Moreover, Life, Sense, and Motion, all depart from the Body; and leave it a lifeless sense∣less Carcass, at Death. Nay the Body it self de∣parts at Death. The present Form and Visage of the Face depart, then <HI>his Beauty consumes away like a Moth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal xxxix. 11.</NOTE>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a his <HI>Countenance is changed, and he is sent away</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job 14. 20.</NOTE>. And the Body becomes such a loath∣some Spectacle, that the dearest Friends are con∣cerned
<PB N="5" REF="004196_0039_1003FDD5140BB6C0"/>
to have it removed and burled out of their Sight, not to appear any more till the Resurrection. It is a Departure, as the Man at Death departs from his present House and Home to the Grave, <HI>that House appointed for all the Living. For the Wind passeth over him and he is gone, and the Places</HI> that knew him <HI>shall know him no more</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm ciii. 16.</NOTE>. At Death the Man departs from his present Friends and Company, and instead of being among the Living to Praise God, he is gone to the Congregation of the Dead. He departs also from the present Business and Em∣ployments of Life, to the Place of Silence and In∣activity; from the Hurries and Cares and Labours of this Life, to the Grave, where there is no Work, no. Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wisdom. Fur∣thermore, he <HI>departs</HI> from his present Possessions and Enjoyments; for at Death we leave all behind us, to those that come after us. <HI>Naked came we out of our Mother's Womb, and naked shall we return thi∣ther</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job i. 21.</NOTE>. Moreover, he <HI>departs</HI> from his present Sor∣rows and Sufferings; and if he be a good Man, to that Place where the Wicked cease from troubling, and where the Weary be at rest; where he rests from his Labours, and his Works follow him. In a Word, He departs out of this World; for as our Birth is our Entry into it, so our Death is the Go∣ing out of it, so as to have no more to do with it. We go off the Stage, we make our Exit, and appear no more to act any other Part upon it. Thus Death is a <HI>Departure.</HI></P>
<P>But then the Word<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> translated a <HI>Departure</HI> is observed to signify more properly a <HI>Dissolution.</HI> And this will serve to give us a further Notion of Death; for it may truly be said of Death that
<PB N="6" REF="004196_0040_1003FD73235092B8"/>
it is a Dissolution. It dissolves the vital Union of Soul and Body. That close and intimate Union that there has been of the essential Parts of our Constitution is broken by Death, so that their Relation to, and Dependance upon each other, for their Sensations or Perceptions, are entirely over for the present. One Part is returned or returning to the Dust as it was, while the other is gone to God that gave it.</P>
<P>Moreover, If we consider the Body by it self, Death is the Dissolution of it. For in Life there is a close &amp; regular Connection of the several Parts of the Body, whereby they have a near Relation to, and a Dependance and Influence upon each other, which Conjunction, and Connection of the Parts is in the Time of Life preserved by the Laws of Adhesion and Attraction, or some other Way of the Creator that we know nothing about; which at Death begins to dissolve. Then the wonderful Structure of the humane Body begins to fall to pie∣ces, and this Master-piece of the lower Creation, even all the Members and Organs of the Body that were so <HI>curiously wrought in the lowest Parts if the Earth,</HI> loose their Form, Situation and Contex∣ture, and dissolve at length into the same kind of Dust out of which Man was formed at first, with∣out any more Form, Connection or Dependance one upon another, than the common Sand or Dust with which it is intermingled. <HI>Dust thou art, and unto Dust shalt thou return,</HI> Gen. iii. 19.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come now to consider, <HI>The full Apprehensi∣on the Apostle had of the near Approach of his Death, or Departure; that he looked upon it to be just at Hand, and ready even then to come upon him.</HI></P>
<P>I am <HI>now</HI> ready to be offered, and my Departure <HI>is at Hand.</HI> What particular Reason the Apostle
<PB N="7" REF="004196_0041_1003FDDCDE27AE48"/>
had to think so, we are not told. An ecclesiastical Historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Echard</HI></NOTE> tells us from the Fathers, that God re∣vealed to him, that his Death was approaching, some Time before this; and that he should suffer Mar∣tyrdom at <HI>Rome,</HI> which caused him to hasten with Joy to the Place. And considering that <HI>the Holy Ghost witnessed in every City, of the Bonds and Afflic∣tions</HI> that he should meet with<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 23.</NOTE>; it is no Wonder if he should give him some Notice of his Death, that finishing Stroke of his Sufferings, some Time before-hand. But whether this be so or no, yet if this was the last Time of his being at <HI>Rome,</HI> he was in close Imprisonment, and he might at the Time of his Writing this Epistle be under a Sentence of Death, at least within himself, which he might ar∣gue from the Cruelty and Rage of that bloody Tyrant <HI>Nero,</HI> the roman Emperor, and the fierce Persecution he was now engaged in against the Christians; and so it proved, for in that Persecuti∣on, and towards the latter End of that Reign, he was beheaded, and <HI>Peter</HI> crucified in <HI>Rome;</HI> and as is generally agreed, on the same Day.</P>
<P>And as the blessed Apostle had Notice and Warning of his Death, some how or other, before∣hand, so it has been with others, they have had some Revelation or Intimations of their Death, some Time before it has come upon them. Thus <HI>Aaron</HI> had express Notice of his Death, when <HI>Moses</HI> was ordered to take him, and <HI>Eliezer</HI> his Son to Mount <HI>Hor;</HI> and told him that <HI>Aaron should he ga∣thered unto his People, and die there</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Numb. xx. 25, 26.</NOTE>. And <HI>Moses</HI> himself had it revealed unto him, that he should go up and die at Mount <HI>Nebo</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 49.</NOTE>. And <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Trans∣lation was revealed before-hand, not only to him,
<PB N="8" REF="004196_0042_1003F9EA75BEE170"/>
but to <HI>Elisha,</HI> and to the <HI>Sons of the Prophets,</HI> who ask'd <HI>Elisha</HI> whether he knew <HI>that the Lord would take away his Master from his Head that Day?</HI> To which he replies, <HI>that he knew it</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Kings ii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And altho' these are extraordinary Instances, and the most common Case is that of good old <HI>Isaac,</HI> who <HI>knew not the Day of his Death.</HI> That is, not the very Day, nor particular Time that Life will come to an End; yet God in his Providence of∣tentimes gives fair Intimations to Men that their Departure is at Hand. This is the Case of those that are of an advanced Age, and have the De∣cays of Nature growing apace upon them. This is also the Case of such as are seized with mortal Sick∣nesses, and under uncontroulable Languishments; for when such Distempers prevail, notwithstanding all the Means used for the Removal of them; they give fair Intimations that our Dissolution ap∣proaches, and that the Time of our Departure is at hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. What I proposed further to observe under this first general Head was, <HI>The Calmness, Easiness and Freedom with which he speaks of his Death or Depar∣ture,</HI> which he apprehended to be at hand.</P>
<P>And by what follows in my Text it appears that he was not under any Ruffle or Perplexity of Mind, at his Thinking or Writing of his Death. The realizing Thought of Death, or of its being just at hand, was no Surprize to him. He had been in <HI>Deaths oft,</HI> yea he as it were <HI>died daily;</HI> he had been expecting and waiting for it, and the News of its Approach instead of stirring up any Fear or Terror, it afforded Matter of Rejoycing to him, and he was ready to bid it welcome. He tells us
<PB N="9" REF="004196_0043_1003FDE57779D3F8"/>
in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Chap. i. 23. That he had a <HI>Desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which was far better</HI> than to be here. And he heid sted∣dy of the same Mind, now he saw Death approach∣ing, and coming in good earnest. The <HI>Jeopardy he was in every Hour,</HI> had made Death very familiar to him; and it seemed to be no more to him than to fall asleep; for so he calls it, <HI>a Sleep in Jesus.</HI> And as to what followed after Death, that was a Joy rather than any Fear to him, considering the Promises and the Prospects which the Gospel af∣forded him.</P>
<P>And now this is the happy Privilege of some o∣thers of the eminent Saints and faithful Servants of Jesus Christ; that Death ceases to be <HI>the King of Terrors</HI> unto them, and the near, yea the immedi∣ate Prospects of it, are no Surprize to them. Nay, some who <HI>through fear of Death have all their Life time been subject to Bondage,</HI> yet when Death has actually drawn near, and they have seen them∣selves a going, all their Fears have been scattered, and they have been able to say with the Psalmist, Psalm xxiii. 4. <HI>Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy Staff they comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>But now, what was it that afforded such Calm∣ness and Comfort to the Apostle under the Appre∣hensions of Death? Why, it was the Reflection he had upon his past Conduct; and so the lively Views and certain Prospect of the Glory and Hap∣piness that follow after Death and the Judgment. Which leads me to the other general Heads I pro∣posed to consider, and which lye so obvious in my Text. So then,</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us consider, <HI>The peaceful and comfortable Reflection of the Apostle upon his Conduct, in the
<PB N="10" REF="004196_0044_1003FD7B2EC24A88"/>
Time past of his Life;</HI> especially since he was con∣verted to the Faith of Christ; Namely, <HI>That he had fought the good Fight, that he had finished his Course, and kept the Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The holy Apostle being come to the Close of Life; he looks back upon what was past, to see how he had managed, and behaved himself in the World.</P>
<P>And what can be more proper, than for a Man when he is just finishing the Scene of Life, to take a Review of the several Parts of it, and see how he has managed himself: Whether he has answer∣ed the great End of Living, or frustrated the grand Design of his Being? Whether his Life has been to any good Purpose, to the Honour of God and for the Good of others, as well as for the further∣ing his own Salvation? Whether he has lived as the Grace of God has taught him? This is necessa∣ry for a Man in order to the removing his Fears of Death, and settling his Hopes and Expectations of a future Glory upon a good Foundation. For as we have behaved our selves in this World, so may we expect it will fare with us in the World that is to come. For here we stand Probationers for the eternal State, and we shall receive of our righ∣teous Judge <HI>according to the things done in the Bo∣dy, whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil,</HI> 2 Cor. viii. 10.</P>
<P>And now the Apostle upon a serious, thorough and impartial Review of his past Life, was able to give a good Account of it, which gave him such a Calm in the near Prospect, and such Courage in the very Hour of Death, He had this for his Re∣joycing, even the Testimony of his Conscience that he had fought the good Fight, that he had finished his Course, and that he had kept the Faith.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="004196_0045_1003FDEAEF741240"/>I. <HI>He had fought the good Fight.</HI></P>
<P>Here is an Allusion (as is supposed) to the grecian or roman Games, in which there were <HI>Fight∣ings,</HI> as well as <HI>Wrestlings</HI> and <HI>Racings;</HI> and so he had engaged in the christian Combat: He had list∣ed under Christ's Banner, and waged War with the Enemies and Opposers of Christianity; and had <HI>fought manfully under the Captain of his Salvation; had endured Hardness, as a good Soldier of Jesus Christ:</HI> He conflicted with great Difficulties, &amp; patiently suffered the sharpest Persecutions, &amp; all Manner of Hardships, short of Death, &amp; now was going to suffer <HI>that,</HI> for the Cause of Christ &amp; of his Gospel. And what a long Catalogue of his Sufferings does he give us in 2 Cor. xi. 23, — 27. <HI>In Labours mere abundant, in Stripes above measure, in Prisons more frequent, in Deaths oft, in Perils of Waters, in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by my own Countrymen, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wilderness, in Pe∣rils in the Sea, in Perils among false Brethren; in Weariness and Painfulness, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirst, in Fastings often, in Cold and Nakedness.</HI> But he surmounted these Difficul∣ties, overcame all these Oppositions; and <HI>came off a Conquerer, yea, more than a Conquerer, through Christ that loved him.</HI></P>
<P>And now, altho' we have not is all Respects the same Enemies to fight against, not such Difficulties and Dangers to encounter, no such fierce Oppositi∣ons and Persections from the civil Power, who were at that Time the professed Enemies of Christ; yet there is, as we are told, Job vii. 1. according to the marginal Reading, <HI>a Warfare to Man upon Earth;</HI> and a good Fight which we must be able to say we have fought, if we would have Peace and Comfort in a dying Hour. There are spiritual, and fleshly, and worldly Lusts, (all which war a∣gainst
<PB N="12" REF="004196_0046_1003F9EEAD0BD088"/>
the Soul) for us to fight with. There are also the Examples of the Wicked, the Enticements of Sinners, and the corrupt Customs of the World, and our own evil Habits, to oppose and conquer; and last of all, there is our <HI>Adversary the Devil, who as a roaring Lyon, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>And we must be able to say that we have waged and carried on a War with these our Enemies, that we have been fighting with them, that we have re∣sisted and overcome them. We must be able to say, that by the Grace of Christ, <HI>we have crucified the Flesh, with all it's Affections and Lusts;</HI> that we have watched &amp; guarded against the Snares of the World, and have by Faith gain'd the Victory over it, so as in a good Measure to get above the Hopes or Fears, the Frowns or Flatteries of it. And that we resist the Devil, so as to cause him to flee from us. In a Word, We are so to fight and struggle with our Lusts, and all our spiritual Enemies, as to come to such a Pass, that no Iniquity has the Do∣minion over us.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apostle <HI>finished his Course,</HI> or run his Race. Alluding still to the Isthmian &amp; Olympick Games. And what he here informs us concerning himself was, that notwithstanding all the Difficul∣ties and Dangers, and Oppositions in his Way; yet he kept on his Course, diligently, steddily, vigo∣rously and perseveringly, even unto the End.</P>
<P>The Holy Ghost had witnessed <HI>in every City, that Bonds and Afflictions waited for him;</HI> but says he, with a noble Courage and Resolution, becoming an Apostle, <HI>None of these Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my self, so that I might finish my Course with Joy, and the Ministry I have received of the Lord Jesus,</HI> Acts xx. 23, 24.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004196_0047_1003FDEF331DC508"/>The Apostle had a Race to run, as a Christian, and as a Minister; and in both these Respects he finished his Course; that is, he faithfully discharged the Duties which the Gospel required of him, as a Christian, and as an Apostle. He had the <HI>Testimony of his Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sinceri∣ty, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of God, he had his Conversation in the World;</HI> and that he had exercised himself to have a <HI>Conscience void of Offence, towards God and towards Men;</HI> carefully attending all the Duties of the christian Life.</P>
<P>And then as an Apostle he went abroad faithful∣ly publishing the Gospel of Christ, from City to City, and from one Country to another People, e∣ven to every Plate that the Holy Ghost signified to him that he should go unto. And a great Race indeed in this Respect did he run; and it would take a longer Time, than I have at present, only to reckon up the Voyages and Travels of this great Apostle. And altho' he speaks humbly of himself, as <HI>the least of the Apostles, and not meet to he called an Apostle, because be persecuted the Church of God;</HI> yet he declares at the same time, <HI>that he laboured more abundantly than they all, by the Grace of God that was with him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I Cor. xv. 9, 10.</NOTE>. And by his abundant Labours, and by his superiour Learning, and ex∣traordinary Gifts, there was a universal Resort to him; in so much, that as he says, <HI>The Care of all the Churches came upon him daily</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 28.</NOTE>. And notwith∣standing that <HI>Thorn in the Flesh,</HI> which is supposed by many, to be some <HI>bodily Weakness;</HI> yet he went on steddily, through the whole Course of his Ministry and Service, <HI>preaching Christ warning &amp; teaching every Man, — striving according to his Working, which wrought in him mightily</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 28, 29.</NOTE>. And agreeable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this,
<PB N="14" REF="004196_0048_1003FA4ABB5B9650"/>
he appeals to the Elders of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> when he took his Leave of them, for his Fidelity, Constancy and Diligence in the Service of Christ, and of their Souls. Acts xx. 18,-27. <HI>Ye know after what Manner I have been with you at all Sea∣sons, serving the Lord with all Humility of Mind, and with many Tears and temptations, — and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shew∣ed you, and have taught you publickly, and from House to House, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, &amp; Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore I take you to record this Day, that I am pure from the Blood of all Men; for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Counsel of God.</HI></P>
<P>And as the blessed Apostle, so every Christian has a Race to run, a Course to finish, if he would finish his Life with Peace, and receive a Crown hereafter. There are all the Duties of the christi∣an Life, even those of Piety, Justice and Charity, which may be considered as the christian Race; so that for us to run the christian Race, is to live as the Gospel, and the Grace of God teaches us, which is <HI>to deny Ungodliness, and worldly Lusts; and to live soberly, righteously and godly in the present World <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heh. xii <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>.</HI> And to finish this Course, is to persevere in Well∣doing to the End, <HI>to continue Faithful unto the Death.</HI> It is as the Apostle expresses it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>to run with Patience,</HI> or Perseverance, <HI>the Race that is sot before us.</HI></P>
<P>In short, for I can only hint at Things, to run our Race, and <HI>finish our Course,</HI> is to set out in the Ways of Christianity; to consider the Duties of every Station and Relation, of every Circumstance and Condition of Life; and to go on in the sincere,
<PB N="15" REF="004196_0049_1003FDFD2FD21C78"/>
diligent and steddy Practice of them. It is to run the Way of God's Commandments, and not suffer our selves to be diverted out of it, or hindred from going on in it. It is to <HI>run</HI> without being <HI>Weary,</HI> to <HI>walk</HI> without <HI>Fainting.</HI> It is to <HI>hold on our Way,</HI> yea, and <HI>to wax stronger and stronger.</HI> In a Word, It is to be <HI>always abounding in the Work of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Apostle had this Testimony, that <HI>he had kept the Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Which intends either,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he kept the <HI>Profession</HI> of his Faith.</P>
<P>He was not so terrified by the Enemies of Christ, nor at the Rage and Fury of his cruel Persecutors; but that in the midst of Danger, &amp; Death, he open∣ly and courageously professed Christ, and his holy Religion. And notwithstanding the Contempt and Reproaches that were cast upon Christ, and even the Scandal of the Cross; yet he was not ashamed to own him before Men. And altho' the Cross, that is the Sufferings &amp; ignominious Death of Christ were to <HI>the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks Foolishness;</HI> yet he glories in nothing more than in the Cross of Christ, he being to them who are called <HI>the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor▪ i. 23, 24.</NOTE>. And amidst all the Trials and Temptations to the contrary, he held fast <HI>the Profession of his Faith, without Waver∣ing.</HI> Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. It may intend his keeping the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Faith, or of the Gospel.</P>
<P>And this he kept, as he constantly maintained the Truth of it against all Gainsayers. And as he pro∣pagated the Gospel, by his Preaching, &amp; by his Epis∣tles; so he confirmed the same, not only with the
<PB N="16" REF="004196_0050_1003FA52EB6B8638"/>
strongest Reasonings; but by divers Signs and Mi∣racles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghost. He made full Proof of his Ministry, preaching the Word <HI>in Demonstration of the Spirit, and with Power.</HI></P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="3">3. Some understand the <HI>Grace</HI> of Faith here.</P>
<P>And so he kept the Faith, as he continued his Faith and Trust in God, and in the Lord Jesus Christ. He believed on him with all his Heart. He accepted of Christ as his only Saviour, and looked for Deliverance from all Condemnation on∣ly in and through him; believing as he said, <HI>That there is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI> He looked for Justification, not from his own Righteousness; but from the free Grace of God, <HI>through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ.</HI> He depended also upon him, for all Grace and spi∣ritual Strength, that he stood in need of; acknow∣ledging that it was <HI>through Christ strengthening him, he could do all Things;</HI> and that of himself he <HI>was not sufficient so much as for a good Thought.</HI> In a Word, he gives this Account of himself, Gal. ii. 20. <HI>I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</HI></P>
<P>And he kept this Faith, continued in it firm and steddy to the End; and he grew strong in it, whereby he gave Glory to God, and gained a Vic∣tory over the World; and when Death it self ap∣proached, it did by no Means fail; but he triumphed over all the Pears and Terrors of it, <HI>knowing in whom he had believed.</HI></P>
<P>And now we must thus <HI>keep the Faith.</HI> We must continue in our Profession of Christ, and of his Gospel. We must continue in a firm and unshaken Belief of the Gospel, <HI>the Faith that was once deliver∣ed
<PB N="17" REF="004196_0051_1003FE0D9494B510"/>
to the Saints.</HI> And we must, as we <HI>believe in God, believe also in Christ.</HI> And we must watch and pray, that our Faith fail not; and must resolve that nothing shall discourage, or break us off from our Faith in him; that altho' <HI>he slay us, yet we will trust in him.</HI> We <HI>must trust in him at all Times,</HI> and <HI>in the Shadow of his Wings, we must make our Refuge.</HI> We must trust to the Merits of his Obedience &amp; Death, to the Prevalency of his Intercession, to the Rich∣ness and Freeness of divine Grace; and we must be influenced by such a Faith, to all Love, Holiness and Obedience; and must continue in such a Faith, even unto the Death, if we would receive <HI>the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have gone through the second gene∣ral Head, even the Apostle's Reflection upon the past Conduct of himself, in the Course of his Life; and happy he, and happy every Man, that upon an impartial Review of his Life, is able to give such a Testimony of it; <HI>That he has fought the good Fight, finished his Course, and kept the Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. I proceed to consider the last general Head, viz. <HI>The joyful Expectation which the Apostle had of what he should meet with hereafter,</HI> viz <HI>A Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge would give him at that Day; and not to him only, but to them also that love his Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle was upon the Brink of both Worlds. He had passed thro' this World, &amp; was leaving it; and was just entring upon the Borders of the other. And as with one Eye, he looks back to see what he had done, how he had behaved in his past Life; so with the other, he looks forward to see what he was to receive in the future. And as he had the Testi∣mony of his Conscience, as to his past Life; so he
<PB N="18" REF="004196_0052_1003FE11B959F220"/>
had most joyful Expectations in the Life that was to come. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c. He argues with himself, that since he had fought the good Fight, and finished his Course so well; all which remained now, was to <HI>receive the Crown of Righteousness.</HI> Here he seems to carry on the Allusion to the ancient Games, and proceeds in the <HI>agonistick Stile.</HI> For as the Victors, in those Combats or Racings, received a Laurel, a Crown upon their Winning it, accord∣ing to the Rules of those Games; which was given to them by one appointed to judge and determine whether they had won it, or no: So the Apostle having fought the Good Fight, and run his Race, he is assured, that there is a glorious <HI>Crown laid up for him, which the righteous Judge would give him at that Day, and not to him only, but to them also that love his Appearing.</HI> He had the Testimony of his Conscience, that he had acted his Part well; and so doubted not, but that he had the Approbation of his Judge; and all he expected now was to receive the Token of it, in the glorious Crown before him. Here are several Things proper to be taken notice of, with some Enlargement, was there Time for it.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Name</HI> he gives to that Reward, he says was laid up for him, viz. <HI>A Crown of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Crowns are set upon the Heads of Emperors and Kings in Token of their regal Dignity, and Power, and Glory; accordingly a Crown is an Emblem or Token of very high Honour and Dignity; so that when the Apostle says, there was laid up for him a <HI>Crown,</HI> it was as much as to say, that he had by a patient Continuance in Well-doing, been seeking for <HI>Glory, Honour</HI> and <HI>Immortality.</HI> He believed it was laid up for him, and that he should receive it. He expected all those Marks of Honour and Glory
<PB N="19" REF="004196_0053_1003FE1C0E928B88"/>
which would be conferred upon such whom the <HI>King</HI> of Heaven <HI>delighted to honour.</HI> And hence, sometimes it is called <HI>a Crown of Glory,</HI> and a <HI>Crown of Life</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r v. 4. James i 12.</NOTE>. But here he calls it, <HI>a Crown of Righteousness.</HI> By which we are to understand, either,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Righteousness would be his Crown.</HI></P>
<P>And as Righteousness and true Holiness was the Glory with which our Nature was crowned, and adorned at first; (this being a great Part of the Image of God upon the Soul of Man) so it will most certainly be the special and peculiar Glory of the Saints in Heaven; that they are made perfect in Holiness. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>a Crown of Righteousness</HI> may be intended, a Crown purchased and procured <HI>by the Righteous∣ness of Jesus Christ;</HI> even by his Obedience and Death, which has unbarred the Gates of Heaven, and opened all the Glory and Happiness thereof unto us, and made Way for our obtaining it, by Virtue thereof. Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Rewards of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>A Reward to be bestowed upon righteous Men. For as the Psalmist says, Psal. lviii. 11. <HI>Verily, there is a Reward for the Righteous.</HI> And that in keeping the Commandments, <HI>there is a great Reward,</HI> Psalm xix. 11. Which Reward is not to be reckoned of Debt, but of Grace. Or,</P>
<P N="4">4. By the Crown's being called <HI>a Crown of Righ∣teousness,</HI> we may understand, <HI>that Glory and Happi∣ness which of Right belongs to all the Saints, according to the Tenor of the Gospel-Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>For altho' it be a Reward not of Debt, but of free Grace; yet by Virtue of the Covenant, and Promises of the Gospel, to which the Saints are in∣titled; it may be called a Reward, or a Crown of
<PB N="20" REF="004196_0054_1003FAA44514EF10"/>
<HI>Righteousness.</HI> For God of his free Grace, has by his Word &amp; Promise, transferred a <HI>Right</HI> to them. Hence it is said to the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> Rev. xxii. 14. <HI>Blessed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life.</HI></P>
<P>But which Way soever we understand the Apos∣tle, it comes to the same Thing; for that which is intended by it, is the Glory and the Happiness of the other World, that will be conferred upon all the sincere Saints, and faithful Servants of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is worthy of our Remark, <HI>from whom</HI> the Apostle expected to <HI>receive this Reward, this Crown of Righteousness;</HI> namely, <HI>from the Lord, the righ∣teous Judge.</HI></P>
<P>That is the Lord Jesus Christ, who is constituted the Judge of the World; the Son of God, to whom the Father <HI>hath given Authority to execute Judgment, because he is the Son of Man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. 27.</NOTE>. And he is a righ∣teous Judge: For unto the Son, he saith, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a Scepter of Righteous∣ness, is the Scepter of thy Kingdom</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And this was he whom the Apostle believed in with all his Heart, had preached to the World, had faithfully served; and laid himself out with most indefatigable Diligence, to promote his Interest, and advance his Honour. From him, I say, it was that the Apostle expected to receive a glorious Reward.</P>
<P>And how great and glorious a Crown may we suppose him to expect from such <HI>a plentiful Rewar∣der;</HI> considering how ardently he loved him, how faithfully he served him, how much he denied him∣self for his Sake, what Sufferings he had already
<PB N="21" REF="004196_0055_1003FE2967EE4658"/>
endured, and considering that he was now about to lay down his Life in his Cause?</P>
<P N="3">3. We may consider the <HI>Manner</HI> in which he expected to receive this Crown, viz. <HI>By Way of Gift. Which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' he had been so faithfully serving Christ, and was now ready to die for him, rather than de∣ny him. And altho' he expected a very glorious Reward, yet he has no Apprehension of Merit in all this. He don't look upon himself as having merited the least of what he expected. For if he was a distinguish'd Saint, yet he knew who it was that made him to differ; and <HI>that it was by the Grace of God that he was what he was:</HI> and that if he <HI>laboured more abundantly than the other</HI> Apostles, <HI>it was not HE, but the Grace of God that was with him</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 10.</NOTE>. And as he looked upon all he had already, as what he had received freely from God; so what he expected further, he looked upon as a free Gift; not what he had merited by all his Services and Sufferings, but what would be freely given him. Indeed he looks for it, as what was promised and secured to him by the Gospel-Covenant; but not as what his Services had merited. And so the Apostle distinguisheth between the Rewards of Sin, and the Rewards of Righteousness: One he calls Wages, the other a Gift. <HI>The</HI> Wages <HI>of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. We may observe the <HI>Time</HI> when he expect∣ed to receive this Crown, viz. <HI>At that Day;</HI> which is the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004196_0056_1003FE30AC1B7548"/>For altho' the Apostle in other Places speaks of his <HI>being present with the Lord, when absent from the Body</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 8.</NOTE> and of his <HI>desiring to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil i. 23.</NOTE> than to be here: Yet the Crown of Righteousness, the Completion of his Happiness, which he expects from the righteous Judge, is <HI>at that Day;</HI> viz. that Day when the righteous Judge shall appear to judge the World. We are told, Acts xvii. 31. That God <HI>hath appointed A DAY in which he will judge the World in Righ∣teousness, by that Man whom he hath ordained.</HI> And it is called <HI>that Day</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 12.</NOTE>; and the Judgment of the <HI>great Day</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jade 6</NOTE>. Accordingly that is the Time repre∣sented in Scripture, when the Rewards of Glory shall be given to the Saints. This the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> to encourage the Elders to be faithful in feed∣ing the Flock of God, assures them; <HI>that when the chief Shepherd shall appear,</HI> that is at the Judgment, <HI>they should receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v 4</NOTE>. So that it is when the chief Shepherd and Judge shall appear to judge the World, that <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and all the Apostles expected to receive a Crown of Righteousness, and a Crown of Glory. He was full in the Belief of the Resurrection of the Body, of the Judgment to come, and of the future State; and died in the confident Expecta∣tion hereof; believing there was a Crown laid up for him, which at the Resurrection of the Just and the Judgment that follows upon it, he should re∣ceive. And this Faith, in some good Degree, have all the Saints. And this leads me,</P>
<P N="5">5. To observe, <HI>The full Perswasion and confident Expectation</HI> the Apostle had of <HI>receiving this glorious Crown.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004196_0057_1003FE3658AE9E68"/>He speaks of it with an Assurance; <HI>Henceforth, there IS laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge WILL give me.</HI> He was fully perswaded of this, there was no Doubt or Uncertainty remaining in his Mind about the Matter; but he seems to be well assured of it, as the Racers were of the Laurel, or the Crown they saw hung up at the End of the Race. And with such sure and certain Hopes, with such strong and lively Prospects of a glorious Crown; he is enabled to receive the Massages of Death with all Calmness and Courage, has all his natural Fears of Death scattered, and with Pleasure thinks of his Depar∣ture, which was so near at Hand.</P>
<P>And this is the happy Privilege of some of God's eminent Saints and Servants: They have such clear Evidences of their being in a State of Grace, and such Assurances of there being a Crown of Glory laid up for them; that they can, not only die in Peace, but are able even to rejoyce at such a Time, in Hope of that Glory there is now reserved in Heaven for them, and shall in due Time be re∣vealed in them.</P>
<P N="6">6 Let me further observe, <HI>The pleasing Thought</HI> the Apostle had at this Time, with Respect to the <HI>Salvation and Happiness of others,</HI> as well as his own.</P>
<P>Was he so Selfish as to think and please himself with the Thoughts of a Crown of Righteousness and Glory far none but himself? Was he for mo∣nopolizing the Glory and Happiness of Heaven, as some Men would the Riches and Honours of the present World? No, but pleased himself with the Thought that this World would be the happy Lot and Portion of all true Believers, as well as of him∣self. <HI>And not to me only, but to them also that love
<PB N="24" REF="004196_0058_1003FE41694B26D8"/>
his Appearing.</HI> He did not look upon the Crown as belonging only to him, or as if he was the only one that should receive a Reward; but that others, even all that loved the Appearance of Christ, should be Partakers with him in the future Glory and Felicity.</P>
<P>And here is the Difference between those that run the christian Race, and the Racers among the Grecians or Romans: For in their Racings, there was but one that gained the Prize; altho' many ran, and strove for it. <HI>Know ye not that they which run in a Race, run all, but one receiveth the Prize</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor ix. 24.</NOTE>? Whereas in the christian Race, all that run with Patience and Perseverance, shall obtain the Prize, the Crown of eternal Life. And this Thought, in∣stead of being any Abatement of his Pleasure, was a great Addition to it: It pleased him that others should be as surely, and as gloriously rewarded as he; according to their Services and Faith.</P>
<P>He had his Soul enlarged in Love to his Fellow-Creatures; he wished, and prayed, and longed, and laid himself out to the utmost, for their Conversion and Salvation. He tells us, Rom. x. 1. <HI>That it was his Heart's Desire and Prayer to God for Israel, that they might be saved.</HI> And so earnest &amp; ardent were his Desires for the Salvation of his People, as to carry him beyond Bounds, and to express himself in such an hyperbolical Manner, (as is thought) in Rom. ix. 3. <HI>I could wish that my self were accur∣sed,</HI> or separated, <HI>from Christ, for my Brethren my Kinsmen according to the Flesh.</HI> And how sollicitous was he, that they and others, might believe and be saved? In so much, that he even <HI>travailed in Birth that Christ might be formed in them</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.19.</NOTE>. He preach∣ed,
<PB N="25" REF="004196_0059_1003FE44E46F9360"/>
he taught, he warned, he exhorted every Man, in all Wisdom, labouring and striving according to the Power and Grace of God given to him; and what was it for? but <HI>that he might present every Man perfect in Christ Jesus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 28.</NOTE>. And well might he think of it with Pleasure; that not only he, but that all true Believers should receive such unfading Crowns of Glory from the Lord their righteous Judge.</P>
<P>And this is the Temper of every true Saint: Their Souls are not only elevated into a supreme Love of God, but enlarged in a sincere and fervent Charity to all the Saints; and it will please every Saint to think that others will, as well as they receive those Marks of divine Honour, and Favour; and that they shall join together, even innumerable Companies of Saints and Angels, in shouting forth the Praises of God, and the Lamb for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="7">7. I have but one Word more to add here; and that is, the Apostle's <HI>Description</HI> of those for whom this Crown of Righteousness was laid up, as well as for himself, viz. <HI>Such as love his Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>There is the Appearing of the Lord, the righte-Judge, before mentioned. So that one Part of the Character of a true Christian, of one that is intitled to a Crown, is that he loves the Appearance of Jesus Christ to Judgment. As for the Hypocrite, and the Sinner, he dreads the Appearance of him. What a Terror is it to such to think of Appearing before him, <HI>whose Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, who searches the Hearts, and tries the Reins of the Chil∣dren of Men, that he may render to every Man accord∣ing to his Works; before whom all Things are open
<PB N="26" REF="004196_0060_1003FE4DB8B93D80"/>
and naked, and who will judge the Secrets of Men.</HI> For such can't but be apprehensive of the Shame and Confusion that will cover them when they ap∣pear before his inlightened Tribunal, &amp; shall have all their Sins, even their most secret Wickedness, laid open to the World; and they shall have the Reward of their Deeds rendred to them.</P>
<P>But now the real Christian whose Conscience can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tify for him with the blessed Apostle, that <HI>he had fought the good Fight,</HI> &amp;c. or can appeal to God with good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> saying, <HI>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and done that which is good in thy Sight</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xx. 3.</NOTE>. I say such will love and rejoyce at the Appearing of Jesus Christ. He will be glad there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Day coming wherein he may give up his Ac∣count to God, if his Conscience tells him, that he has glorified God on Earth, and finished the Work that he had given him to do. Glad that there will be an Opportunity to vindicate himself of the ill Thoughts, the hard Speeches and Reproaches that have been cast upon him; to have his Sincerity and Uprightness, his Fidelity and Diligence in the Service of Christ, acknowleged and approved by his Judge; and to receive the blessed <HI>Euge</HI> to his immortal Honour before the World.</P>
<P>Thus every true Christian has Reason to love the Appearing of Jesus Christ; for when <HI>he who is their Life shall appear, they also shall appear with him in Glory</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And thus I have hastily gone over my <HI>Text,</HI> and the Subject was too large and copious to do any thing more than hint at Things, in the Compass of Time allowed me. And what I now hasten to is the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<PB N="27" REF="004196_0061_1003FE536D6EFF28"/>
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>And here I shall only mention two or three In∣ferences, that are the most obvious, and will be most agreeable to the present Occasion.</P>
<P>Infer. I. <HI>What an unspeakable Mercy is it, since there is a Necessity of Dying; that there is any thing to support and comfort us under the certain Pros∣pects and near Approaches of it.</HI></P>
<P>Death in it self considered is an awful Change, and carries a great deal of Terror along with it. Nature abhors and relucts at a Dissolution. It is a very affecting Thing to go off the Stage of Life, and pass into a State of Silence, and Inactivity. It is a very melancholly Thing to take the final Leave of our Families and Friends, our Possessions, and Enjoyments; &amp; to leave the Places that now know us, to know us no more forever.</P>
<P>And if we are utterly in the Dark as to our fu∣ture State, it must needs be very perplexing to the Mind. But, O what Distress must the Man be in, who has no better a Prospect before him, but that of a miserable Eternity! That when Death ap∣proaches, and when all worldly Prospects fail; that there <HI>should nothing remain to him, but a fearful look∣ing for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation to devour him!</HI></P>
<P>But now what an unspeakable Mercy do the Saints enjoy; that they have such Cordials, such Supports &amp; Comforts, at the Approaches of Death, as the Testimony of their Consciences, the Wit∣ness of God's Spirit, the Light of his Countenance, and the Joy of his Salvation? Such sure and certain Prospects of a blessed Eternity, that instead of be∣ing surprized or terrified at Death, it is Matter of
<PB N="28" REF="004196_0062_1003FA97B2B22A28"/>
Joy to them, and instead of shrinking back at the Approach of it, they are able to welcome the King of Terrors, and in holy Triumph, to say with the Apostle, 1 Cor. xv. 55, 56. <HI>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin; and the Strength of Sin is the Law. But Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Infer. II. We learn, <HI>That it is the Testimony of a good Conscience, with Respect to our past Carriage and Conduct in the World, that will afford solid Com∣fort in a dying Hour.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>this</HI> that enabled the Apostle, to think, and speak, and write so calmly of Death; and to please himself with the confident Expectation of a future Reward. And it is only such a Testimony of Conscience for us, that will take away the Ter∣ror, and the Sting of Death: And truly without this, it is impossible for us to have any Peace at the Approach of Death. What Peace or Comfort can that Man have who is conscious to himself, that he has lived in the Neglect of God, and of his Duty to him, of his being unjust in his Dealings, unfaith∣ful to his Trust, unkind, unchaste or intemperate in his Life? How will such a guilty Soul be filled with Distress &amp; Terror at the Approach of Death, knowing that this will open the Scene of eternal Wo and Misery unto him?</P>
<P>Whereas such as upon the closest, and most im∣partial Reflection upon themselves, can say they <HI>have fought the good Fight;</HI> that they have waged War with all their spiritual Enemies; and have through the Grace and Strength of Christ gotten the Mastery of them; that they have run their christian Race with Patience; that they hold fast the Profession, and the Exercise of their Faith with∣out
<PB N="29" REF="004196_0063_1003FE60ABDE06B8"/>
Wavering, they will have a sure foundation for Peace and Comfort in the Hour of Death. For what can do a Man any Hurt that is in such a Case? God and Christ are for him; the Gospel, and all the exceeding great and precious Promises thereof, are on his Side; and then, who or what can be against him.</P>
<P>So that it is according as our Consciences testify for, or against us; that we shall have Hope or Fear, Joy or Sorrow, in a dying Hour. <HI>For if our Hearts condemn us, God is greater than our Heart, and knoweth all Things. But if our Heart condemn us not, then may we have Confidence towards God<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 20, 21.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>Infer. III. <HI>How safe and happy must the true Chris∣tian needs be in Death; since there is a Crown of Righ∣teousness laid up for him, which the Lord the righte∣ous Judge will give him at the Day of his Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>Well might the Apostle say, <HI>that to die was Gain</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Phil i. 21</NOTE>, since that was the Way to a glorious Crown; and it is through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death, that all the Saints do ascend to Glory. That Man who while he lives, lives to the Lord, and when he dies, dies in the Lord; who can take away his Crown? It is secured to him by the Pow∣er, and by the Promises of God, <HI>all which are in Christ yea, and in him Amen.</HI> Wherefore we may all write, as in Rev. xiv. 13. <HI>Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>And now, this we have Reason to think was the happy Case of an aged Saint among us, who was
<PB N="30" REF="004196_0064_1003FE665AD81200"/>
the last Night interred, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose Temper and Carri∣age in his private Station in the World was such, as gives us good Ground to hope, there was a Crown of Righteousness laid up for him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr</HI> John Dickson.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But what abundant Reason have we to think so, with Respect to the worthy and honourable, good and faithful PRESIDENT of the College; who has lately taken his Departure from us by Death?</P>
<P>His Life and Conversation from his Youth up, have been a constant Testimony for him, to all that knew him, of the excellent good Dispositions of his Mind, and of the gracious Impressions upon his Heart from his tender Years. He like King <HI>Josiah,</HI> while he was yet young, began to seek and serve the God of his Fathers.</P>
<P>He was favoured with a liberal Education at the College, (over which he was afterwards called to preside): And when a Student there, he behaved himself with so much Inoffensiveness, Dutifulness, and Diligence, as not only to gain the Love and Good-Will of all, but their Respect and Esteem as a good Proficient in the Learning of <HI>that Day.</HI></P>
<P>Since which he has been imploying his natural and acquired Accomplishments, with a Diligence, Constancy and Fidelity, that was uncommon.</P>
<P>But few Men had more useful Talents, or Accomplishments better fitted for doing Service in the World, than he.</P>
<P>He had a calm and moderate Temper, and had a great Government of his Passions; but with all, had strong and steddy Spirits, which would prompt him to undertake, and would carry him through many difficult Labours, without Fainting or giving
<PB N="31" REF="004196_0065_1003FE71F553C778"/>
over. He was very meek and peaceable, humble, condescending and familiar to all. He was not of a hasty Spirit, that would precipitate him to any rash or unadvised Actions; but in all Affairs, es∣pecially those that were difficult and doubtful, he acted with great Caution.</P>
<P>And altho' where his Conscience was concerned, (which he always appeared to be under the Go∣vernment of,) he would steddily and courageously abide by the Dictates thereof, whether he pleased or displeased Men; for this was his governing Princi∣ple, to manage in all his Affairs, not as pleasing Men but God, that trieth the Hearts.</P>
<P>And yet in other Cases, no Man more careful not to displease or offend. Accordingly in his Dis∣courses, whether private or publick, he for the most part avoided controversial Points, and Mat∣ters of doubtful Disputation; choosing rather to press those practical Duties that were not disputed, than spend his Time in speculative Controversies. He was a Lover, and a Counseller of Peace; and studied the Things that made for Peace, and where∣by one might edify another.</P>
<P>He spent about <HI>thirty Years</HI> of his Life in the publick Ministry at <HI>Boston,</HI> where he was happy in the hearty Love and Respects of his People; and where he diligently, and I believe successfully laid himself out for the good of Souls, in his pastoral Visits, as well as in his publick Preaching; and shewed himself a Pattern of good Works, readily distributing the Tenth of all his Income to pious and charitable Uses, whereby he could with greater Cou∣rage and Confidence call upon others for their Cha∣rities; and did by his own Example provoke them to Love and to good Works.</P>
<P>Furthermore, He endeavoured that his publick Ministry should be of more extensive Service; by
<PB N="32" REF="004196_0066_1003FE737812C450"/>
the many Sermons, and other Discourses which he published; in all of which he used great Plainness of Speech, level'd to the lowest Capacities, more am∣bitious to instruct and quicken others, than to gain Applause to himself; in which Writings, altho' he be dead, yet he speaks to us; and as they have been, so I doubt not, but that they will be a Guide and Comfort to many Souls.</P>
<P>It is now almost <HI>twelve Years</HI> since he was chosen into the Presidentship, and accepted the Care and Burden of that important Office; not for the Ho∣nour, or the Profit of the Place; but as he has often declared, from a self-denying Spirit, and in Obedience to what he apprehended to be the Call of God unto him.</P>
<P>And as he came hither for the Good of the Col∣lege; so he laid himself out very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ligently, and la∣boriously for that End; endeavouring to train up the Youth in such a Way, as he apprehended would render them most Serviceable in their Day; being concerned to rectify their Morals, to reform their Disorders; and to promote true substantial Piety, as well as the most useful Learning, among them.</P>
<P>And altho' he has for the greatest Part of his Presidentship been afflicted and sore broken; yet it has been wonderful to us all, to observe, not only with what Patience he endured his Pains; (which for Years together, except when in Bed, were almost constant upon him.) But with what Diligence and Care he applied himself to the Busi∣ness of the College, under so much bodily Weak∣ness. For altho' this Weakness grew upon him, yet he held out, in the constant Service of his Place, even almost unto the very last. So that I have often thought, that many other Men, for the same Degree of Pain and Weakness, would keep their Chamber, if not their Bed; when he would
<PB N="33" REF="004196_0067_1003FE789FB4FD38"/>
go forth to College, and carry on the Worship of the Hall.</P>
<P>In a Word, and to sum up all; He was one of the brightest Examples of Diligence, Constancy and Fidelity.</P>
<P>And when he apprehended his Departure to be at Hand, he was in the same happy Frame with the blessed Apostle. He had his Conscience wit∣nessing for him, that he <HI>had fought the good Fight, finished his Course, and kept the Faith;</HI> which gave him a Calm and Quietness of Mind; yea, and filled him with joyful Expectations of <HI>a Crown of Righ∣teousness;</HI> and with admiring and adoring Thank∣fulness to God, for his abundant Mercy through Christ, in begetting such lively Hopes within him; telling me at one Time, how deeply and frequent∣ly he was affected with those Words of the Apostle, 1 Peter i. 3,— 9. saying, <HI>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Dead, to an Inheritance incorruptible, and unde∣filed, and that fadeth not away reserved, in Heaven for you,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now, who is there that has seen &amp; known <HI>his Manner of Life</HI> among us, his <HI>Doctrine, Purpose, Long-suffering, Charity, Patience,</HI> and are Witnesses how <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lily, justly &amp; unblameably</HI> he behaved himself; that can possibly doubt of there being a Crown of Glory laid up for him? If we may judge of the Tree by its Fruit, we must thus judge of him: He was a good and holy Man; for he had his <HI>Fruit un∣to Holiness,</HI> &amp; <HI>the End is eternal Life.</HI> He is gone, with the Apostle, to be with Christ for the present, and his Rest is glorious in him; and there is un∣doubtedly
<PB N="34" REF="004196_0068_1003FE80144C3290"/>
a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give him, at <HI>the Day</HI> of his Appearing.</P>
<P>And now what remains, but that we duly resent this bereaving Stroke of divine Providence, and make a wise Improvement of it?</P>
<P>And in a particular Manner, let the <HI>College</HI> be deeply affected with the Breach that God in his holy and sovereign Providence has made upon it.</P>
<P>May <HI>Those</HI> who have the <HI>immediate Instruction and Government of that Society,</HI> be excited and quick∣ened to be more and more imitating their Master that is taken from their Head, in Diligence, Con∣stancy and Fidelity; aspiring after a double Portion of that good Spirit that was in him.</P>
<P>And may the <HI>Students,</HI> the Sons of the Prophets, call to mind the solemn, earnest and affectionate Counsels, Exhortations and Warnings, that you have heard from his Mouth; and may his Prayers and Tears upon your Account, which you have seen and heard, come into your more serious Re∣membrance. And let the bright Example of shin∣ing but unaffected Piety and Goodness, be ever before you as a Pattern to follow.</P>
<P>May the bereaved <HI>Family</HI> be supported under this heavy Loss, and have it sanctify'd unto them. May the <HI>Widow</HI> have the Consolations of God which are not small, and rejoyce in having the Lord her Maker for her Husband.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="004196_0069_1003FABBE523BC78"/>May the <HI>Servants</HI> of the House, so remember the Counsels and Warnings of their deceased Master, as to approve themselves the Servants of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>May <HI>mourning Friends and Relatives</HI> be comfort∣ed to think of the happy Exchange it has proved to him.</P>
<P>May the <HI>Poor</HI> of this Place, and elsewhere, who have been relieved and refreshed by his Charities; be duly affected with the Loss of such a kind Be∣nefactor; and be pleased with the Thought, that by his Acts of Piety and Charity, he has made to himself Friends of the Mammon of Unrighte∣ousness, that now receive him into everlasting Habitations.</P>
<P>And may <HI>all of us in the Neighbourhood,</HI> be suita∣bly affected with the Loss of so good a Neighbour, such a faithful Friend, and Father.</P>
<P>And may the <HI>whole Town</HI> mourn the Loss of this and other Saints, and Servants of Jesus Christ; and when our Glory is thinning after such a Man∣ner, may we cry unto God, as in Psalm xii. 1. <HI>Help, Lord, for the godly Man ceaseth; and the faith∣ful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, Let us earnestly pray for the plentiful Out-pourings of the divine Spirit upon those of us that survive; that the Breaches may be repaired, and their Ground made good who have gone off the Stage. Let us be Imitators of them who are gone before in all that was Good and Excellent; and especially, let us aspire after the same Mind,
<PB N="36" REF="004196_0070_1003FE8AA95D5B00"/>
and Spirit that was in Christ. And as the Apostle advises, with whose Words, I now conclude, Heb. vi. 12. <HI>that ye be not slothful, but Followers of them who through Faith and Patience, inherit the Promises.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Faithful Servant of CHRIST, Described and Rewarded.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW XXV. 21.</BIBL>
<Q>HIS Lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou hast been faithful over a few Things; I will make thee Ruler over many Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are Part of a Parable spo∣ken by our blessed Saviour to his Disci∣ples, when the Time of his Departure from this World, and of his Ascension to his Father began to draw near.</P>
<P>The Design of the Parable seems to be to set forth the different Demeanour of those, who bear the Name of the Servants of Christ, and receive valuable Betrustments from him, in this World; and the suitable Difference he will make in his Treatment of them; when <HI>he shall come in his Glo∣ry,</HI> at the Day of Judgment, <HI>and all the holy Angels with him.</HI> It will then be found, that some of the Servants of Christ have well improved the <HI>Talents</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="004196_0073_1003FE99DD068AC0"/>
he delivered to them; and these he will both com∣mend and reward: While others who have been his Servants by Vocation, external Profession, and special Designation as well as they; will neverthe∣less appear to have made an ill Use of their Lord's <HI>Goods;</HI> or at least not to have improved them to any valuable Purpose: And these he will censure as <HI>Wicked and Slothful,</HI> and doom them to <HI>outer Darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>My Text contains the Words of our Lord to a Servant of the first Sort, who was able to give a good and a joyful Account of himself, and of what his Lord had delivered to him. <HI>Lord,</HI> says he, <HI>Thou deliveredst unto me five Talents; behold, I have gained besides them five Talents more.</HI> He humbly acknowleges that he had improved nothing, but what he had received from Christ his Lord. Tho' his Stock had been large, compar'd with that of his Fellow-Servants; yet it was not his own, but Christ's. Thine the Talents were, and thou ho∣nouredst me by committing them to my Trust. And then he appeals to Christ as a Witness of his Dili∣gence, Faithfulness and Success in improving them. That as he had received much, so he had been careful to return the more; and to make his Im∣provements proportionable to his Receivings: <HI>Behold, I have gained besides them five Talents more.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it a foolish Confidence of Boasting, but the Testimony of a good Conscience, that he had obtained Mercy to be faithful, which gives him this Boldness in the Day of Judgment; for Christ himself admits the Truth of his Account, and ap∣plauds and rewards his Faithfulness and Diligence; saying unto him as in my Text, <HI>well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou hast been faithful o∣ther a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many
<PB N="3" REF="004196_0074_1003FE9F41B1B740"/>
Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI> Upon which we may observe this Doctrine,</P>
<P><HI>That these Servants of Christ, who have faithfully improved the Talents he delivered to them, shall be highly applauded, and gloriously rewarded by him.</HI></P>
<P>For the Illustration of this Truth, I shall do four Things: viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>I shall consider what may be meant by the Ta∣lents delivered to the Servants of Christ.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>I shall show, that it is Christ who delivers these Talents to his Servants.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>That those Servants who improve them faithfully, shall be highly applauded.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>That they shall be gloriously rewarded by him.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to consider, what may be meant by the Talents delivered to the Servants of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And here I may say in general, <HI>That every Thing improveable by them to the Honour of God, or to the Good of others, or of their own Souls is a Talent.</HI> It is a valuable Treasure, which if the Fault be not their own, may become of inestimable Advantage to them; for as much as by a right Use of it, they may be <HI>laying up in Store for themselves a good Foundation a∣gainst the Time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal Life</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tim vi. 19</NOTE>. In this View we may consider, the Endow∣ments of their Minds; the Health &amp; Strength &amp; Vigour of their Bodies; their worldly Enjoyments, Estate, Education, Credit, Interest, Power, Preferments; the Word and Ordinances of God, and Motions of the good Spirit of Grace; and all the Opportu∣nities, or even Occasions of doing or receiving
<PB N="4" REF="004196_0075_10041947A2539900"/>
spiritual Good; as so many Talents committed to their Trust. By a right Use of any of these, they may be doing acceptable Service to God; and by a Misimprovement, at a bare Neglect of them, they may incur the Guilt of Sloth and Wickedness.</P>
<P><HI>How much then does it concern us all, to walk cir∣cumspectly, not as Fools, but as Wise; since there is hardly any Thing can occur to us so indifferent in its own Nature, but that it may minister an Occasion of doing, what may recommend us to the Favour, or ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> us to the Displeasure of God, and so may affect our eternal Interests?</HI>— It is just Matter of Rejoycing to consider, that the most Common of our outward Enjoyments may be so ordered, as to be of everlasting Advantage to us: That our very Food and Drink may be received in such a Manner, as that God will account himself glorified thereby. But then we have Reason to rejoyce with Trembling, when we take a Prospect of the Danger on the other Side: How that by any Misimprovement of these Things, or only by neglecting to glorify God with them, we shall incur his Displeasure, and treasure up Wrath to our selves. Since then we have such an Advantage, and such a Danger continually before us; how tho'tful and vigilant ought we always to be? And what Manner of Persons in all holy Con∣versation and Godliness? Especially if we con∣sider, what I am to say,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That it is Christ who delivers to his Servants all the Talents they are betrusted with.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this is fairly hinted in the Parable now before us; the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ver 14</NOTE> first Verse of which, I think,
<PB N="5" REF="004196_0076_1004194F07C31750"/>
ought to be read, not as in our English Translati∣on, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is;</HI> but, <HI>The Son of Man is</HI> as a Man travelling into a far Country, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods. And unto one he gave five Ta∣lents, to another two, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When our blessed Lord ascended up on high, he received Gifts for Men; had all Things put under his Feet; and was made to be the Head over all Things to the Church <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxviii. 18. Eph. i. 22.</NOTE>. The Administration therefore of the Kingdom of Providence and of Grace, is now in his Hand. So that we are to look upon all the Abilities, Advantages, Occasions and Opportunities we have of doing or receiving Good, as so many Talents committed to our Trust <HI>by him,</HI> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himself a pecu∣liar People, zealous of good Works <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tirus ii. 14.</NOTE>: <HI>By him,</HI> who will call us to an Account in the great Day of Rec∣koning, and be our Judge to determine our ever∣lasting State, according as we have made a good or bad Use of these Talents of Trust and Confidence reposed in us.</P>
<P><HI>Let us then consider seriously with what Strictness and Exactness, and tender Resentments, we may well expect he will take an Account of the Number and the Nature and the Degree of the good Things which be himself hath committed to us.</HI>—As he was the Bestower of them, he cannot but know exactly what they were. And as they were Part of the Purchase of his Blood, and of the Reward of his Obe∣dience unto Death, and were committed by him to us as Marks of Honour and Confidence, to be im∣proved
<PB N="6" REF="004196_0077_1003FAD6AA09EEB0"/>
for our eternal Benefit, he cannot but be most tenderly affected with the Use we make of them. With what Pleasure &amp; Satisfaction must he look upon us, if we faithfully improve them to the blessed Purposes for which he purchas'd &amp; bestowed them. And with what Indignation, if we neglect them as Things not worthy of our Notice or Improvement?</P>
<P><HI>The Consideration of these Things should be a most powerful and prevailing Argument with every one of us to inquire frequently with great Care and Sollicitude, into his own State and Circumstances; that he may know what is his Duty, and what are the Expectati∣ons of his Lord from him.</HI> — Without such an In∣quiry, we shall either not know, or at least not consider what Talents Christ hath delivered to us. And so far as we are ignorant or tho'tless of this, it is certain we shall be scareless and slothful and wicked Servants; and have but a wretched Account to give up to our Master at the Day of Reckoning. And as our Circumstan∣ces are often varying, so our Opportunities and Ad∣vantages for doing Honour to God, and Service to our Generation, are often changing with them, which makes it needful that our Inquiries should be frequent: And very sollicitous we have all the Reason in the World to be, to obtain a good Under∣standing in these Things; because our Usefulness in this World, and our Happiness in the next, so much depend upon our Knowledge of them; and because our Lord himself will take such an exact Account of his own Gifts, as well as of our Improvements.</P>
<P>Let us then be perswaded to inquire frequently and with great Attention; what Services for God and our Generation the natural Abilities which our Lord hath given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, tender us most fit for? An Inquiry this, of great Importance to such as (like
<PB N="7" REF="004196_0078_1004195E964A8718"/>
many of you) have their Course of Life yet to choose; that they may determine upon such a one, as they will be most likely to act in with Pleasure and Satisfaction to themselves, and Usefulness to others.</P>
<P>Again, Let us inquire, what Duties God calls us to from time to time in his Providence; by presenting Opportunities &amp; Advantages, &amp; laying Inducements before us? What Opportunities and Occasions arise out of our present State of Life, to testify our Fear of God, and Regard to his Servants? What to be getting Good to our selves now, and what to be laying a Foundation for Usefulness to others here∣after? What Benefits or Advantages are derived to us from the respective Relations or Capacities in which we are placed? What Incitements to a vi∣gorous Application arise from our outward Circum∣stances, and future Hopes and Prospects? In fine, and above all, how many spiritual Advantages we enjoy in common with our Fellow-Servants by the external Means of Grace? And how many pecu∣liar to our selves by the inward Convictions, Re∣straints, Assistances of that good Spirit which our departed Lord sendeth to us? By frequent In∣quiries of this sort, we shall become more and more sensible what Talents our Lord is committing to our Trust; and of consequence what we have to Im∣prove here, and what to Account for hereafter. And a serious Consideration of these Things will have a happy Tendency to work us up to a fer∣vour of Spirit in the Service of our Lord, and so prepare us for those Applauses and Rewards which the Good and Faithful may expect from him.</P>
<P>And so it may do also, to <HI>remember them who have had the Rule over us, who have spoken unto us the Word of God, and whose Faith it concerns us to fellow, considering the End of their Conversation.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004196_0079_1003FB1C32D62130"/>
For every Benefit we have had Opportunity to re∣ceive by their Means, ought to be considered by us as a Talent, which we must give an Account of to Christ at his second Coming. And all their Abili∣ties and Opportunities to do Service to us or others: And their Fidelity in improving them, ought thankfully to be acknowledged to the Honour of Him, who is Head over all Things to the Church; and who <HI>giveth</HI> such <HI>Gifts to Men, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings me to pay Part of that Tribute which is due to the Memory of our late Reverend and worthy President, who may justly be consider∣ed, if we compare his Opportunities and Abilities together, as one of those Servants whom our Lord honours with the Care of <HI>five Talents,</HI> a large Stock in comparison of what is trusted with many others.</P>
<P>He had his Education in this House, where I hope without Flattery it may be said, that those who are disposed wisely to improve them, enjoy at least as many Advantages to accomplish themselves for the Service of their Generation, as are to be met with in our own Country. When he pro∣ceeded to settle in the Gospel Ministry, the Holy Ghost made him Overseer of a numerous Flock in the Metropolis of the Province, in the generality of whose Affections he was blessed with a very great Interest. And as this gave him a singular Advantage to promote the Good of their Souls; so it evidences the Truth of their Christian Self-denial and publick Spirit (which ought always to be remembred, and spoken of with Honour) in Consenting to the Removal of One so dear to them, to what they apprehended a Station of more gene∣ral Usefulness and Service. And so at length by the sovereign Disposal of our ascended Lord, he
<PB N="9" REF="004196_0080_10041966B024A948"/>
was set at the Head of this Society, in whose Wel∣fare and Prosperity, both the civil and religious Interests of the People of God in this Land are so much concerned that hardly any Place can be tho't of, in which a Servant of Christ hath Oppor∣tunity to be a more extensive Blessing.</P>
<P>And to render him such a one in every Station, the glorious Head of the Church had given him a very capacious and faithful Memory, a sound Un∣derstanding, a clear Apprehension, and an uncom∣mon Faculty of making religious Truths plain to the meanest Capacities. But to crown all, our Saviour Jesus Christ had taken an early Possession of the Heart of this his Servant for himself; had impressed it with a most affectionate Concern for the Souls of Men, and had given him an indefatiga∣ble Spirit to pursue their Interests.</P>
<P>These are some of the Talents with which our blessed Lord betrusted his deceased Servant. But how diligently and faithfully he occupied them I shall have a more proper Occasion to say under a∣nother Head. I must now proceed therefore to say,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That those Servants of Christ who have faith∣fully improved the Talents he delivered to them, shall be highly applauded by him.</HI></P>
<P>And here I shall endeavour two Things; viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>To describe the faithful Servants of Christ; or shew, what Manner of Persons they are who faithfully improve the Talents he hath delivered to them.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>To prove the Truth of the Proposition; or shew, that such Servants shall be highly applauded by him.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who is the faithful Servant of Christ? What is his Character? Or what Manner of Person is the
<PB N="10" REF="004196_0081_1004196FAA9D06F0"/>
Man who faithfully improves the Talents which Christ hath delivered to him?</HI></P>
<P>To which I may say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That he is one whose Heart is full of Affection and Devotion to his Master.</HI> He considers that he is not his own, but is bought with a Price: and that not of corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Christ. And there∣fore he loves the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity, who hath first loved him, and given himself an Of∣fering and a Sacrifice to God for him. If other Lords have had Dominion over him, the faithful Servant of Christ heartily repents his past Subjec∣tion to them. He renounces the Service of the Flesh, the World and the Devil; breaks their Bands asunder, and casts their Cords away from him. He unfeignedly acknowleges the Right of Christ to rule over him, and devotes himself entirely and forever to his Service; saying as in Psalm cxvi. 16. <HI>Oh Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Ser∣vant, and the Son of thine Handmaid. Thy Servant who is devoted to thy Fear,</HI> Psalm cxix. 38.</P>
<P>From this Spirit of Affection and Devotion to him, the faithful Servant of Christ becomes highly concerned for his Master's Interest and Honour, sollicitous above all Things, that whether present or absent, he may be accepted of him; and he can take no rest under the least Sense or Doubt of his Displeasure. It is his earnest Desire and Study to know the Will of Christ in the utmost Latitude of it, and especially with Respect to the Duties of his own Station in particular. His great Inquiry is, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And his ser∣vent Prayer, <HI>Teach me thy Statutes. I am thy Ser∣vant give me Understanding that I may know thy Testi∣monies.</HI> And it is his fixed Resolution (through Christ strengthening him) carefully to perform what∣soever
<PB N="11" REF="004196_0082_100419788C04EF50"/>
he does know, or shall know to be his Duty Without such a Temper of Mind as this, no Man will faithfully improve the Talents which Christ hath delivered to him, but will be habitually <HI>diso∣bedient, and unto every good Work reprohate.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A faithful Servant of Christ is one who endea∣vours to extend his Obedience to the whole Compass of his Duty.</HI> It is not Faithfulness, but some other and some unworthy Principle which actuates the Man, who pretends a Zeal for Christ in some Points of Duty, and yet is knowingly Remiss and Negli∣gent in others: Such a Man <HI>seeks his own, not the Things which are Jesus Christ's.</HI> For a sincere Re∣gard to the Interest and Honour and Will of Christ, must be operative and influencial in one In∣stance as well as in another. And therefore, tho' the faithful Servant of Christ, thro' humane Infir∣mity, offends and falls short of his Duty in many Things, yet it is his Grief and Lamentation that he does so, and <HI>he always labours fervently that be may stand perfect and compleat in all the Will of God.</HI> And <HI>then</HI> only <HI>will he not be ashamed, when he hath a Respect unto all his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The faithful Servant of Christ is peculiarly mind∣ful of the Duties of the Station and Relations in which his Lord hath set him.</HI> These are emphati∣cally his <HI>own Business</HI> and <HI>he studies to do it,</HI> being always tho'tful of that Precept, I Cor. vii. 17. <HI>As God hath distributed to every Man, as the Lord hath call∣ed every one, so let him walk.</HI> And for the same Rea∣son, he will also carefully lay hold of every Oppor∣tunity, Advantage or Occasion arising from the Cir∣cumstances in which his Lord shall at any Time place him, to promote his Master's Interest and Honour, get good to his own Soul, or do good to others. For he looks upon every Opportunity and Advantage for these Things, as a Call from Christ
<PB N="12" REF="004196_0083_1004197C90B40040"/>
to arise and do them. And he thinks it impossible for any Man to be a faithful Servant of Christ, and yet regardless of his Master's Calls to Duty.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The faithful Servant of Christ is a diligent and laborious Servant.</HI> He abhors the Character, and dreads the Curse of him, who doeth the Work of the Lord negligently. And therefore whatsoever his Hand findeth to do, he doth it with his Might. He is not slothful in Business; but servent in Spirit serving the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>He is full of Patience and Resignation to his Master's Will under all the Afflictions with which he thinks fit in his holy Providence to exercise him.</HI> The faithful Servant of Christ don't consider Affliction as coming forth out of the Dust, or Trouble as springing out of the Ground; but as sent by him, who is given of God to be Head over all Things to the Church; by him who loved the Church, and gave himself for it: who therefore cannot be supposed to afflict willingly, or grieve any of his faithful Servants, whom he hath redeemed with his Blood; but rather to chasten them for their Profit, that they may be Partakers of his Holiness. That there∣fore, tho' no Chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous; nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteousness, un∣to them that are exercised thereby. Upon which Account he considers every Fight of Affliction as a Talent, the right Improvement of which, will work for him a far more exceeding, and eternal Weight of Glory. And this may well make him patient in Tribulation. For he reckons that the Sufferings of the present Time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which shall be revealed in us.</P>
<P>Moreover, The faithful Servant of Christ looks unto Jesus the Author and finisher of his Faith; who for the Joy that was set before him, endured
<PB N="13" REF="004196_0084_1004198509CD5E70"/>
the Cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God. And con∣sidering him that endured such Contradiction of Sinners against himself; and also, that Christ suf∣fered for us, leaving us an Example that we should follow his Steps; he is not wearied, neither doth he faint in his Mind; but is ready to deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow his Master, not thinking any Thing too much to suffer from a Sense of Gratitude, and a Principle of Love and Subjection to him, who his own self bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, and hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</P>
<P>In fine, The faithful Servant of Christ is per∣swaded, that it is only if need be, that he is now in Heaviness for a Season thro' manifold Temptations. He can truly say with the Psalmist, Psalm cxix. 75. <HI>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulness hast afflicted me.</HI> And there∣fore instead of murmuring at his Master, or envy∣ing his Fellow-Servants, who seem thro' less Tribu∣lation than he, to be entring into the Kingdom of God; he kisses the Rod, and blesses him that ap∣pointed it; knowing that Tribulation worketh Pa∣tience; and Patience, Experience; and Experience, Hope; and Hope maketh not ashamed, because the Love of God is shed abroad in his Heart, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto him.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The faithful Servant of Christ perseveres in his Duty with an unbroken Resolution as long as he lives.</HI> He remembers the Faithfulness of his blessed Lord to the Interest of miserable Sinners, when for their Sakes, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross. He re∣members that one great End of this was, that we
<PB N="14" REF="004196_0085_1003FAFB73260A38"/>
being delivered out of the Hands of our Enemies, might serve him without Fear, in Holiness and Righteousness before him, all the Days of our Life. He considers that his Lord hath promised to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender eternal Life, only to them, who seek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, by <HI>patient Continu∣ance in Well-doing;</HI> But that, if any Man draw back, his Soul will have no Pleasure in him. And upon such Considerations as these, the faithful Ser∣vant of Christ can say, <HI>I have inclined mine Heart to perform thy Statutes alway even unto the End. I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments. All the while my Breath is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my Nostrils, I will not forget thee, neither will I deal falsly in thy Covenant. My Heart shall not turn back, nor my Steps decline from thy Ways.</HI> And having once framed such ho∣ly and vigorous Resolutions, he earnestly endea∣vours to hold them fast; and <HI>through the Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;</HI> he becomes <HI>Stedfast, Un∣moveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord.</HI> But these Things may suffice for the main Strokes in the Character of the faithful Servants of Christ. It only remains under this Head, that I proceed to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That such Servants as these, shall he highly ap∣plauded by their Master.</HI> He knoweth all Things, he knoweth that they love him. He knows their Works, their Labour, and their Patience. He looks down from Heaven with Approbation and Pleasure upon them now. And he is not unrighteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to forget their Work, and Labour of Love, which they have shewed to his Name: But when he shall come in his Glory, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the holy Angels with him, and shall sit upon the Throne of his Glory, he will call them good and faithful Servants, the blessed of his Father: he will approve &amp; applaud
<PB N="15" REF="004196_0086_10041990EA0147D8"/>
their Faithfulness and Obedience, and publish to their everlasting Honour, their pious and charita∣ble Works in the Presence of the whole Assembly of Men and Angels, who shall be gathered before him at that Day; saying, <HI>I was an hungred and ye gave me Meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me Drink,</HI> &amp;c. Thus their Faithfulness shall be found <HI>unto Praise, and Honour, and Glory at the Appearing of Jesus Christ.</HI> And not only so, but as I am to say,</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>It shall be gloriously rewarded by him also.</HI> Their Reward hereafter shall be vastly greater than their Improvements have been here; &amp; they shall have Comfort and Peace, and unspeakable Rejoycing evermore in the Possession of it. For <HI>they shall be made Rulers over many Things,</HI> and shall <HI>enter into the Joy of their Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They shall be made Rulers over many Things.</HI> This is spoken after the Manner of earthly Princes. For as they, if they be good and wise, will advance those Servants to higher Offices, whom they have found faithful in lower, so will Christ do also. He will make all his faithful Servants Kings &amp; Priests unto God, &amp; his Father. He will give them a Crown of Righteousness. He will grant to them to sit with him in his Throne; and to inherit the King∣dom prepared for them from the Foundation of the World <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 6.2. Tim. iv. 8. Rev. iii. 21. Marth. xxv. 34.</NOTE>. What a Disproportion is here be∣tween the Work and the Reward of a faithful Ser∣vant? He is faithful over a few Things, and he is rewarded for it with a Crown, a Throne, a King∣dom! Verily, Not by Works of Righteousness which we have done; but according to his Mercy he saves and rewards us!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="004196_0087_10041999E3B76308"/>2. <HI>They shall enter into the Joy of their Lord.</HI> Sorrow &amp; Sighing shall now flee away for ever, and all Tears shall be wiped from their Eyes. All the Springs of Joy and Gladness shall be opened unto them; for they shall see God Face to Face, &amp; shall be made like unto him by seeing him as he is. In his Presence they shall find their Joys to be full, and their Pleasures everlasting. Then shall be ve∣rified that Word of their Lord, the Glory which thou gavest me, I have given them. Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou hast given me. And <HI>that beholding</HI> cannot mean a meerly <HI>contemplative,</HI> but a <HI>fruitive</HI> Intuition. <HI>If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gether,</HI> Rom. viii. 17.</P>
<P>I might now proceed to infer from what you have heard, How blessed a Thing it is to be a faithful Servant of Christ? How easily we may ac∣count for it, why our Lord suffers his most faith∣ful Servants to undergo so much Tribulation in this World? How unreasonable it would be, either to forsake the Service of such a Master, or to go on dejectedly in it, because of the Difficulties which may sometimes attend it? How foolish and wicked a Thing it is to refuse this Service, or despise those who are faithful in it; or to do any thing which may tend to render the Labours of any faithful Ser∣vant of Christ less successful, than otherwise they might have been? In fine, How much the condi∣tion of the Generality of Mankind is to be lament∣ed, who instead of devoting themselves to the Ser∣vice of Christ, make themselves Slaves to the worst of Masters? But these, and many other useful Re∣flections, which might be made upon what hath been discoursed at this Time, I must leave to be enlarged upon in your private Meditations and may only add,</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004196_0088_100419A0CE560B40"/><HI>That from the Description which hath been given of a good and faithful Servant, I think we may well con∣clude, that the Servant of Christ lately taken from our Head was such a one.</HI> Indeed his Character hath been already drawn so well, by much better Hands than mine, that there is no Occasion for my attempt∣ing <HI>that.</HI> I shall therefore only go on to observe such Things concerning him, as my Subject natu∣rally leads me to consider.</P>
<P>Under a former Head we have taken a View of some of those Talents which his Lord delivered to him; and here we may turn our Thoughts with Pleasure and Advantage upon his Faithfulness in improving them to his Master's Honour, and the Service of his Generation.</P>
<P>If we consider, how short a Time he spent in this Society when a young Man, in Comparison of what many have done of later Years; how long he was removed from it; what weighty Cares were upon him, during the Time of his Removal; and yet when he returned to it, what a considerable Ac∣quaintance he retained with the learned Languages, and other Parts of Learning also, according to the State of them with us in his younger Time; and how laudably, and to what general Acceptance he presided at the first anniversary Solemnity after his Return, before he began to be broken with bodily Pains and Weakness; we may very reasonably conclude, that he faithfully improved the Advan∣tage of an academical Education by hard Study in his Youth.</P>
<P>Again, How diligent, how constant, how labori∣ous he was in the Discharge of all the Duties of the pastoral Office while he stood in that Relation, you have already been informed by those who had sufficient Opportunity to observe that Part of his Life and Character.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004196_0089_100419A986CB5970"/>And how great his Faithfulness was in the Du∣ties of the honourable Relation which he bore to this Society in his last Years, you need not that a∣ny should inform you. Ye are all Witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblameably he behaved himself among you. Ye are all Wit∣nesses of his servent Affection and Devotion to his Master; of his exemplary Patience and Resignati∣on to his Will under sore Pains, and of long Con∣tinuance; of his tender Concern for the Interest of this Society, and the best Good of all it's Mem∣bers; and of his unwearied Application to all the Duties of his Office, in which he always seemed to go to the utmost of his Ability, and many Times almost beyond it. Sure I am, that some of us have spent whole Days in the Business of this Society with him, when it hath been a continual Uneasi∣ness to us to see that he could take no Rest in any Posture, by Reason of his distressing Pains; and yet have not heard one Complaint come out of his Mouth, no observed any Token of his being dis∣posed to have the Business of the Day hurried o∣ver; but as long as there was any Business to be done, or any Day left to do it in, he hath always appeared as willing and patient, as those who were most at Ease and in Health, to attend upon it, And so he continued without fainting in his Mind, faithful to the Death.</P>
<P>And now, we may very well refresh our selves with the Thought, that the Applauses &amp; Rewards of a good and faithful Servant are become his Por∣tion and Inheritance forever. And God grant that none of us may be slothful; but followers of him who through Faith and Patience inherits the Pro∣mises.</P>

<HEAD>Domini Curatores, Honora∣biles, ac Reverendi, Sena∣tores Academiae, Professo∣res, et Tutores, reliquaque celeberrima Corona.</HEAD>
<P>EX animo confiteor, me ad munus hujus diei obeundum, et ad fungendum officium ora∣toris funeralis, nimis, immo et omnino in∣eptum esse, at{que} imparem. Officium qui∣dem non lectum, fed coactum, non optatum, fed praeter voluntatem impositum. At cum alius nemo inventus fuerit, qui partes, hujus provinciae tristiffi∣mae, in se susciperet, humilis, et permoestus assurgo, ad plorandam mortem luctiferam, Domini, <HI>Benjaminis Wadsworth,</HI> jamdudum hujus academiae praesidis doctissimi, prudentissimi, pientissimi, ac plurimum reverendi.</P>
<P>Hic dies (domini auditores) est ater et lugu∣bris, ut verbis prophetae utar est <HI>dies tenebrarum, et caliginis, dies nubis, et obscuritatis.</HI></P>
<P>Vos omnes alloquitur moesta, et orbata academia, sicut olim <HI>Jeremias</HI> propheta, in lamentationibus su∣is. <HI>Ego ille sum, qui experitur afflictionem, virga furo∣ris Domini, me ducit et cogit in tenebras, non autem in lucem. Nihilne ad vos (O viatores omnes!) in∣tuemini, et videte, an sit dolor, par dolori meo, quo me affecit Dominus, die aestus irae suae ferocissimae.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004196_0092_100419BD34412E98"/>Sed quo nos fert, et quem ad finem sese exten∣dit, gravitas nostri moeroris? <HI>Decet nos dicere Deo, castigationem passi sumus, at non amplius offendemus, quicquid ignoramus, tu Domine nos doceto, et si pecca∣verimus, non pergemus ulterius. Quapropter Jehovam versus speculabor, Deum salutis meae praestolabor, et Deus meus me exaudiet. Ne laetator de me, O mi in∣imice! quum cccidero, tum resurgam, quum sedero ob∣volutus tenebris, Dominus illucescet mihi. Iram Domi∣ni feram, quoniam peccavi in cum, usquedum causam meam agat, et pro me judicium exerceat, producens me in lucem, ut fruar justitia ejus.</HI> Scimus <HI>Harvardi∣nates,</HI> probe scimus, quod Dominus Deus, magis∣trum nostrum, a capite nostro, hodie assumpsit, et decet nos tacere, et non aperire os nostrum, quoni∣am Deus hoc illud secit. Sed quis potest linguam suam continere? Cum eum curru quasi sidereo, et fulgenti, in Coelum ascendentem, intuemur; quin cum propheta exclamet, <HI>Mi pater! mi pater! cur∣rus Israelis et equites ipsius!</HI> Jam vero, nobis quae∣rendum est, non laenam, seu mantelam, sed potius pictatem, et spiritum hujus nostrae <HI>Eliae</HI> ascendentis. Immo nostrum est diligenter curare, et cavere, ne illo anobis discedente jacturam quoque divinae praesentiae aliquatenus faciamus ideoque precibus ardentibus Deum implorare, et solicite inquirendo, cum pro∣pheta conclamare, <HI>Ubi est DOMINUS DEUS ELIJAe.</HI></P>
<P>Fuit ille praeses defunctus, ah! suit, decus, et for∣titudines Ecclesiae Novanglicanae, et academiae Har∣vardinae, dum in hac vita commoratus est. Jam eum non amplius videmus, in hoc orbe terrarum. Ast illum stantem super terram, cum redemptore suo, et nostro, supremo die, oculis intuebimur. Concedat Deus, ut cum illo ipso compareamus, stantes ad dextram salvatoris nostri, Jesu Christi quando caetu angelorum gloriaque paterna, ultimo

venturus est et nos omnes, in extremum judicium vivorum, et mortuorum vocaturus.</P>
<P>Interea sanctus ille vir, cum aliis sanctis usque ad resurrectionem sepulchro condormit, anima ve∣ro conditur in coelis, sinu Christi salvatoris soaviter complexa in eternum. Nos autem in terris reliquir, sicut silios parente studioso, solicito, et prudenti orba∣tos. Cura enim sua, et consilio, doctrina et exem∣plo, patientia et prudentia nos optime praeivit, in viam pacis, ordinis et sanctitatis, nos sedulo duxit, et direxit.</P>
<P>Hic nunc manemus, ejus cura et precibus enixis∣simis, monitis, consiliis, et pientissimi exempli lu∣mine privati, ac destituti.</P>
<P>Gratia autem suit, et indulgentia coeli, quod pre∣cibus, curis, et laboribus fidelissimis, tam diuturne fructi fuerimus, quum sub salutari lenique ejus um∣bra conse derimus, plorimis deliciis, et pari emolu∣mento.</P>
<P>Atqui vero propter peccata nostra, et delicta, a societate nostra, nimis indigna separatus et disjunc∣tus in perpetuum evasit.</P>
<P>Hoc est opus Dei, in omnibus dominantis, cujus providentiae potenti, et sapienti humiliter nobis est submittendum. Hoc nostrum est grave infortuni∣um, ejus autem solamen, et gaudium sempiternum; abiit enim ad coelum usque supremum, <HI>ad Deum omnium judicem, ad Jesum mediatorem, ad myriadas angelorum, et spritus justorum consummatorum,</HI> prae∣mium laboris et sidelitatis, patientiae et forticudinis, in omnibus officiis, aerumnis, et tentationibus lar∣gum, et infinitum ex miserecordia divina sola re∣cepturus. Audivit sanctus praeses, jam nunc audi∣vit vocem salvatoris benignam, ei dicentem, <HI>Euge, serve bone et fidelis, ingredere in gaudium Domini tui. Adesdum, patris mei benedicte, possideto regnum, tibi paratum, a jacto mundi fundamento.</HI> Nonne etiam

in hac re, vocem Spiritus Sancti, nos omnes quo∣que audimus? <HI>Beati ab hoc tempore, mortui ii, qui in Domino moriuntur, immo, dicit Spiritus, ut a labori∣bus suis requiescant, et eos eorum opera sequuntur.</HI></P>
<P>Jam tandem ut spero, mihi vitio non vertetur, si de vita et actionibus reverendi praesidis, aliquan∣tum enarrarem. Dignissimis ille vir, natus suit in oppido <HI>Miltoniae, seu potius Dorcestriae,</HI> at eo tempo∣re vocabatur, silius ordine septimus, digni viri D. ducis <HI>Samuelis Wadsworth,</HI> qui occisus est praelio, manibus Indorum barbarorum, vitas et fortunas pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> suae, et patriotarum, defendendo, pro aris et focis, fortiter dimicando; quinetiam in campo praelii, aut ab eo prope, apud silvas <HI>Sudburienses,</HI> nunc jacet sepultus, et in cujus reliquias, hic ejus filius pietate erga patrem commotus, monumentum erexit.</P>
<P>Reverendus praeses pietatem et religionem a pu∣eritia coluit, et indicavit. Quae cum eo crescebat, usque dum togam acceperit, virilem; ab ineunte aetate, et deinde per totum vitae cursum, se Christo et ejus servitio sancte dicavit et consecravit. Siti∣ens scientiae et peritiae, in linguis literatis, artibus∣que liberaribus, <HI>Concessit Cantabrigiam ad capiendum∣ingenii cultum.</HI> Hic studiis se sedulo applicabat, et omnimodam liceraturam, hisce musarum sedibus, venebatur. Ita ut cum in hac academia, una a∣lumni fuerimus, facile memini, hujus viri notabilem innocentiam, et morum integritatem, cum lauda∣to in studiis progressu conjunctam. Tandem se ad∣dixit studiis theologicis, in qua disciplina, caeteris omnibus superiori, multum prosecit; consque, ut ad docendum in ecclesia et ad praedicandum eter∣num Christi evangelium, aptus promptusque evasit.</P>
<P>Postea ad pastorale officium, a prima ecclesia <HI>Bostoniensi,</HI> electus est; atque in sacro isto officio, et gravi plurimum vitae suae consumpsit, ad gloriam

Christi, et salutem animarum immortalium, omni auro pretiosiorum, promovendam, totis viribus, omnibusque nervis, contendit. Exemplum, beati Jesu salvatoris imitando, et homines cujuscunque generis, praesertim pauperes, pluribus beneficiis affi∣ciendo, operaque Dei, qui illum misit, operando, urbe et rure commeavit.</P>
<P>Testes suae charitatis, et h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilitatis, apud nos plurimos reliquit. At quot suerunt vera et felicia, mi∣nisterii sui sigilla, et quantus interni cordis suit labor, et luctatio, in animabus Christo lucrifaciendis, Deus, cui diu integreque servivit, in evangelio filii sui, <HI>est testis solus et fidelis.</HI> Posthac, et in progressu tem∣poris, placuit Deo optimo et maximo, omnium re∣rum in terra coeloque dispensatori, hanc societatem, eo infelicem, suo capite et principali, honorabili nimirum, et reverendo <HI>D.

Nostrum autem dam∣num, fuit ejus lucrum, et emolumentum eternum. Ibat enim ad astra poli, usque ad coelum supremum, empyraeumque, praemium laborum, victori dandum, a manibus Dei gratiosissimis, accepturus; et Jesum Christum, delicias sui patris, angelorum, et homi∣num, apertis oculis, et facie ad faciem int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turus; et in ejus imaginem, ex gloria, in gloriam, sicut Spiritu Domini, transformandus. De illo viro am∣psissimo, et doctissimo, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uovis excellenti genio, dici potest, ut olim, <HI>a long quor, vestigia s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per a∣dorans.</HI> Inscribere convenit, in ejus monumento, quod <HI>Aristoteles Philosophus,</HI> longe ab hinc, in se∣pulchro magistri sui <HI>Platonis divini,</HI> exarari voluit, nimirum, <HI>hic jacet homo, quem non licet, nec decet, impiis vel ignorantibus laudare.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004196_0096_10041B3936E0C460"/>Sed ut ad propositum redeamus, eadem divina providentia, in omnibus veneranda, quae tunc tem∣poris, subitanea morte praesidis, constitutionem col∣legii valde dirupit, et in nos fecit incursionem, plu∣rium aquarum inundationi aequalem, immo et ma∣jorem, nobis tandem rempublicam literariam, selici∣ter et gratiose restituit. Quaesivit enim, et invenit hominem, qui sepem obduceret, et in irruptione coram Deo consisteret, pro nostra academia, ne ea omnino everteretur. Quamobrem, conjunctis vo∣cibus honorabilium, et reverendorum curatorum, atque senatus academiae honoraudi, <HI>reverendus do∣minus Wadsworth</HI> ad implendum latum hoc inter∣vallum, vocatus est. Et nemo nescit, qua humili∣tate, et suiipsius suarumque rerum abnegatione, quinetiam erga divinam voluntatem submissione, officium praesidis, grave et momentosum, in se sus∣cepit. Porro autem, nobis omnibus facile notum est, qua fidelitate, et constantia, ad officium suum obeundum, sese contulit; idque sub multis infirmi∣tatibus, et corporis languoribus, quod exercitium fidei, et patientiae fortissimae, solidissimacque exegit.</P>
<P>Nullus autem est, qui non agnoscit, quod cum modice convaluerit, et sanitudo corporis eum quo∣damodo permiserit, constans suit, et regularis in munere obeundo, et in omnibus partibus officii sui persiciendis. Quinimo tanta suit in eo propensio, ad opus proprium, et debitum absolvendum, ut vi∣res corporales frequenter excessit, illudque in poste∣riori suae vitae parte, magis atque magis constabat, adeo ut saepe audivimus, cum votum sui animi ex∣primentem, <HI>se labors potius, quam rubigine, ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lescere maluisse.</HI></P>
<P>Tandem accessit fatalis dies, et mortis decretum in se susecpit, et seelix ei, maximeque beatum suit, quod tempore anteacto, et per totam sui vitam di∣dicisser non sibi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>psi, nee ullis aliis creaturis conti∣dere,

sed soli Deo omnipotenti, fideli, et mortuos resuscitanti.</P>
