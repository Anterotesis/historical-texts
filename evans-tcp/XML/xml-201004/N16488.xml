<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is a reproach, too often justly, cast on writers of morality, that their names prefixed in the title-pages of their books, are little else than a confutation of the pre∣cepts that follow.</P>
<P>For as the morals of a divine, add no little weight to the doctrine he would incul∣cate from the pulpit; so the life of a writer equally diminishes, or adds to, the regard the public pay his works.</P>
<P>It is for this reason, as I should be sorry sentiments, whose truth and importance I am so fully convinced of, should meet with less regard from a knowledge of their author, that this little piece comes into the world without a name, which on other occasions has been made so public.</P>
<P>I am sensible of the curiosity naturally arising in every reader, the desire of know∣ing who, and what is the author: but for the above mentioned reason, not to say there is a rudeness in striving to know what is in∣dustriously concealed, I presume my denial of gratifying such curiosity, will not be im∣puted to my having less ambition to appear, in the theory, a persuader of the fair sex to virtue, than I have been, by example, to afford them dissuasives from vice.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE EARL of ****.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF it were possible to suspect your Lord∣ship of ever speaking without de∣sign, the compliment you once honored me with, might be reckoned, as most compliments are, attended with no meaning: you was pleased to say, with an air of pleasantry, you thought me the most proper person of my whole sex, to write <HI>the Duty of a Woman;</HI> yet, as the occasion of your Lordship's making this remark was a very particular one, it was impossible for me to construe it into mere raillery. I am persuaded, if the world were sensible to whom I now address myself, no other apology would be necessary for my presumption in the following work than the knowledge of your private opinion, in my behalf; but as I have no right, at this distance, to transgress so far on your Lordship's complacence, I must submit to the cen∣sure
<PB N="iv" REF="021184_0004_0FB26DFAFA2CFD78"/>of the few, who may make any discovery concerning the author.</P>
<P>But if a perfect knowledge of the subject, be qualification sufficient to en∣title a writer to the exercise of the pen; I presume, as the knowledge dear∣ly bought by experience, is universally esteemed the most just, I have been greatly, though not sufficiently, quali∣fied to venture on compiling <HI>the Duty of Woman.</HI></P>
<P>A very material objection may, in∣deed, arise, in respect to my capacity in conveying those sentiments, the ac∣cidents of my life have so deeply im∣planted. I have, therefore, followed an inimitable original, in the stile of the Sacred Dictates of Wisdom, whose beauties, if I have justly, though faint∣ly, copied, I am satisfied, <HI>the whole Duty of Woman</HI> will need no other recom∣mendation.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>I am with all due respect, My</HI> LORD, <HI>Your</HI> LORDSHIP'S <HI>Most obedient, humble Servant.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>INTRODUCTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GIVE ear, O ye daughters of beau∣ty, attend to the voice of your sister, for experience hath taught her wisdom, and length of days virtue and understanding.</P>
<P>My father was the brother of <HI>tender∣ness;</HI> my mother was the sister of <HI>love.</HI></P>
<P>As the rose-bud opening to the morn, as the dew-drop on the lily, so was the loveliness of my youth.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021184_0006_0FB26E0047A50030"/>
I awoke at the rising of the dawn; my salutation was that of joy and gladness. <HI>Pleasure</HI> beckoned me forth, and I sport∣ed in the sun-shine of <HI>plenty.</HI></P>
<P>The hours were swift, and ran smil∣ing away; but the lightness of my heart out-lived the going down of the sun.</P>
<P>The day departed with the mildest breeze, and the night but invited me to the bed of repose.</P>
<P>My pillow was the softest down, my slumbers attended with golden dreams.</P>
<P>Thus one day passed away, and the morning of the next found me happy.</P>
<P>Happy are the hours of artless inno∣cence! happy the days of virgin sim∣plicity, while the bosom is a stranger to deceit, and the heart inconscious of the painful sigh!</P>
<P>O that I could overtake the wings of time! O that I could recal the pleasures of my youth! for the days of my wo∣manhood have been days of many sor∣rows; the tears of misfortune have be∣dimmed the lustre of mine eye; the li∣ly is fallen, and the rose-bud is blown and withered on my cheek.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021184_0007_0FB26E056442DA28"/>
For I listened to the voice of <HI>adula∣tion,</HI> and her bewitching blandishments allured me to destruction.</P>
<P>The silver tongue of <HI>flattery</HI> is hol∣low, and laden with guile; the manna that drops from her lips, is corrosive poison to the heart.</P>
<P>Hear then, O daughter of Britain. O fairest of the fair among women! let my precepts be treasured in thy bosom, and walk in the ways of my counsel; so shalt thou shun the thorn of reproach, more keen than the bite of the asp, more venemous than the sting of the scorpion.</P>
<P>The hand of scorn shall point its finger from thee; the tear of misery shall never bedew thy cheek; thy life shall be replete with good things, and peace and honour shall satisfy thy soul.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>CURIOSITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the first of all evils, as the source of calamity, as the beginning of
<PB N="8" REF="021184_0008_0FB26E10CAA54010"/>pain, avoid, O daughter of Eve, the bewitching charm of curiosity.</P>
<P>Seek not to know what is improper for thee; thirst not after prohibited knowledge; for happier is she who but knoweth a little, than she who is ac∣quainted with too much.</P>
<P>Remember thy mother, the daughter of heaven, arrayed in the whitest robes of innocence; forget not the fatal con∣sequence of her disobedience.</P>
<P>How much happier in the bowers of paradise, feasting on the luscious grape of gladness, than wandering in the wil∣derness of care to chew the bitter weed of repentance!</P>
<P>Be thou contented, therefore, with knowledge fitting for thee; for in the acquaintance of many things, lieth not wisdom; but in the knowledge of that which is meet.</P>
<P>Let the threshold of thy neighbour's door secure her family, let her window tempt not thine eye to see, nor the open casement thine ear to hear the se∣crets of her house.</P>
<P>The prying eye is a foe to itself, and the listening ear will hear itself slan∣dered.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="021184_0009_0FB26E13DF74AC60"/>
Art thou inquisitive after deeds of scandal and reproof, enquire of thyself, and thou wilt find employment within.</P>
<P>Art thou a virgin, doth the bloom of health grow lively on thy cheek, study not to know the ways of man.</P>
<P>As the way of a serpent in the grass, or a traveller over the waste, in a dark night, so the ways of man are danger∣ous and hard to find out.</P>
<P>Thy ignorance of his cunning may lay thee open to his deceit; but the knowledge thereof must be the conse∣quence of thy being deceived.</P>
<P>Learn therefore, O woman, what thou shouldest know before thou seekest farther knowledge.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. <HI>REFLECTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the way of a man who walketh, yet knoweth not whither he is going, so is the discourse of one who weigheth not his words.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021184_0010_0FB26E16B5E491E0"/>
As the chattering daw, that prateth without understanding; as the young magpie, with its double tongue, talketh by rote; as the monkey jabbers, as the green parrot squalls without ceasing, so is a woman, who regardeth not her speech.</P>
<P>Before thou openest thy lips to speak, reflect whether thou knowest the truth of what thou art about to say, or un∣derstandest the matter thereof.</P>
<P>Else thou mayst be detected in a fals∣hood, and thy assertions may be an im∣peachment to thy understanding.</P>
<P>So shall the stranger, and the ac∣quaintance, repeat thy words to thy disadvantage; the sincere will despise thee, and the wiser than thou, laugh thy folly to scorn.</P>
<P>Let thy promises be few, and such as thou canst perform; lest thou art re∣duced to break thy word, and it be hereafter reckoned of no account.</P>
<P>Be not less circumspect over thy ac∣tions; for the sayings of thy mouth may be forgotten; but the work of thine hands will make a deeper impression, and may be lasting causes of remorse.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021184_0011_0FB26E18E26EED18"/>
Consider what thou art about to do, before thou beginnest thy work; lest thou labour in vain, and the fruit of thy endeavours turn to no end.</P>
<P>Weigh thy strength and thy design; lest thou faint under thy burden and fall short of the recompence of thy toil.</P>
<P>Wouldst thou attempt to reach up to the moon, the nurse would laugh and the young child hold thee in derision; yet as well mayst thou undertake a work thou canst not perform.</P>
<P>Examine also the price of thy labour, the consequence of thy deeds; lest, when thou hast finished thy task, thou art dissatisfied with thy wages.</P>
<P>For the consequence of precipitancy is repentance at leisure.</P>
<P>The price of folly is reproach, and the wages of sin is death.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>VANITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOU art fair as the snow-drop of the spring, the rose of June blows on thy damask cheek, thine eye
<PB N="12" REF="021184_0012_0FB26E1A52034848"/>out-sparkles the blue lustre of the sap∣phire, thou art stately as the tall fir∣tree, and thy presence is commanding as majesty itself.</P>
<P>The east and the west pour forth their treasures to deck thee; the sea and land give up the pearl and the pre∣cious stone; thy array is the finest silk; the diamond is a star on thy bosom, and the ruby and the emerald are interwo∣ven with the hair on thy temples.</P>
<P>Therefore vanity hath lifted thee up, thou flutterest on the wings of thine own conceit, thou despisest even the ground where the vulgar tread, thy chariot is drawn by white horses, and thy feet are hardly conscious of their own burden.</P>
<P>O deluded woman! the butterfly and the gaudy tulip are emblems of thy fan∣cied importance.</P>
<P>They are decked in the pride of sum∣mer, they enjoy the sun-shine a while, but shortly fade and attract the eye no more.</P>
<P>Is thy breath perfume, is thy taste rich? the particoloured carnation and
<PB N="13" REF="021184_0013_0FB26E1F59F65108"/>the speckled rose are sweet, and the juice of the ripe grape as delicious as thy taste.</P>
<P>But the rude hand of the spoiler com∣eth, both in the opening of the bud and at the fulness of the bloom, and the untimely frost turns sour the rich flavour of the vine.</P>
<P>So misfortune may crop thy imagina∣ry greatness, in the bud of thy joys, or in the full bloom of thy splendor; and the clay-cold hand of disease con∣vert thy exquisite taste to undistinguish∣ing bitterness.</P>
<P>Doth gold pamper thee with dainties, doth the smiling aspect of full-fed plen∣ty delight thee:</P>
<P>Be not exalted beyond measure, for thou knowest not how soon they may forsake thee: when starving poverty shall provide scraps for thy table, and meagre want, with famine on her hol∣low cheek, shall stare thee in the face.</P>
<P>Art thou quick of invention, is thy mind stored with the talents of wit and understanding, doth the power of elo∣cution sit on thy tongue, do thy periods flow like honey from thy lips; be not
<PB N="14" REF="021184_0014_0FB26E21FB126BD8"/>vain-glorious of these, nor boast them in thy possession.</P>
<P>For the fool will take a pleasure to peck at thee; thy words will be sifted, and thy speeches examined with the nicest severity.</P>
<P>The malicious and the ignorant will catch at the opening of thy mouth; neither shall the justest of thy sayings escape their criticism.</P>
<P>Nay, they will condemn thee unheard, yea, censure when thou speakest not.</P>
<P>If thou sayest thou wilt act wisely and eschew evil, and the frailties of human nature should overcome thee to do ill, they will then point at thee and cry out, <HI>This is the wise woman who buildeth her house on a rock, who is sagacious to do good; let us profit by her example, let us take pattern by her wondrous wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>Avoid therefore, vain-glory and self-conceit; for she who lifteth herself up, will others take a pride to pull down; and, if the day of calamity should come, her fall will be their triumph and their rejoicing.</P>
<P>But the humble shall be honored in prosperity; they shall find favour in ad∣versity;
<PB N="15" REF="021184_0015_0FB26E2A998B1BB8"/>and compassion shall invite them to her home, in the day of trou∣ble and distress.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V. <HI>KNOWLEDGE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHO is she that travelleth from the farthest parts of the earth, who crosseth the mighty waters, to find out the ways of the children of men?</P>
<P>Who changeth her habitation daily, who dwelleth in the fields and in the populous cities, beneath the straw-crowned cottage, and the golden roofs of the king's palaces?</P>
<P>Fatigue hath wrinkled her forehead, her head is silvered o'er with age; yet she walketh upright, for experience is her support and her strength.</P>
<P>Her name is Knowledge: she is the daughter of Enquiry, and the mother of many children.</P>
<P>For pleasure and profit, and experi∣ence, and sorrow and pain are the fruit of her womb.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021184_0016_0FB26E2C8D9A2D80"/>
Wouldst thou, O fair one, be the guest of her house, be satisfied with what her table affordeth.</P>
<P>For pleasure standeth at the door and inviteth thee with smiles, and profit spreadeth the best on the board; but if thou desirest what she hideth from thee, and pryest into the secrets of her closet, experience will embitter thy drink, and sorrow, like a churl, make thy cheer and thy welcome, naught.</P>
<P>It is not for thee, O woman, to un∣dergo the perils of the deep, to dig in the hollow mines of the earth, to trace the dark springs of science, or to num∣ber the thick stars of the heavens.</P>
<P>Let the kingdom rule itself, let the wise-men and the counsellers enact laws, and correct them; the policy of govern∣ment is a hidden thing, like a well of water in the bottom of a deep pit.</P>
<P>Thy kingdom is thine own house, and thy government, the care of thy family.</P>
<P>Let the laws of thy condition be thy study, and learn only to govern thyself and thy dependants.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="021184_0017_0FB26E2DD21C9CA8"/>
<HEAD>SECTION VI. <HI>REPUTATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BRIGHTER than polished silver, more valuable than <HI>Peruvian</HI> ore, more precious than the pearl in the sea, than the diamond in the bowels of the earth, or all the shining treasures of the mines of <HI>Potosi,</HI> is reputation to a woman.</P>
<P>As the time that is past is gone for ever; as the word that escapeth thy lips, returneth not again; so is the good-name of a woman, when it goeth from her.</P>
<P>Art thou beautiful as the morning, art thou comely as the evening, do strangers speak thy praise, and thy ac∣quaintance pour their encomiums on thee; yet thy way is a narrow path, from which, if thou strayest, thou wilt never more find it out, thy praises will be turned into revilings, and thy enco∣miums into keen reproach.</P>
<P>Art thou placed on an eminence, among the daughters of women, dost
<PB N="18" REF="021184_0018_0FB26E3710A07C28"/>thou sit at the head of the board, do crouds of admirers bow down before thee with reverence; yet thou sittest on a slender pinnacle, from which the sud∣den breath of indiscretion, or the strong blast of envy, may cast thee down; so shall thy fall be that of a falling meteor: thou shalt be despised in the dust, and gazed at on high, no more.</P>
<P>Wouldst thou preserve this jewel of an high price; let not the boaster, nor the professed betrayer, come near thine house.</P>
<P>Be not frequent in the walks, nor in the thronged parts of the city, nor in the high places of the theatre.</P>
<P>Let not thy foot often leap at the sound of music, lest in thy dancing-days, thy reputation forsake thee.</P>
<P>Encourage not a train of admirers, lest their envy and jealousy of each other, cast an odium on thy conduct.</P>
<P>As the way of a man on the ridge of an house, so is the fame of a woman among a croud of fools; but the co∣quet is light of heart, and danceth along; no wonder, therefore, she falleth.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="021184_0019_0FB26E385B077AB8"/>
Yet affect not to despise temptation; for the prude loseth her good-name by the means she taketh to preserve it.</P>
<P>As a man, on the brow of a preci∣pice, trembleth at the depth below, and, fearing to fall, his head swimmeth, and he is gone; so is a woman who boast∣eth her reputation.</P>
<P>Keep the appearance of evil at a dis∣tance; for the shew of a crime may be as fatal to thy reputation, as the reality of a transgression.</P>
<P>Sport not with thy good name, nor run it heedlessly into danger; for the consciousness of thine own innocence, will not protect thee from reproach.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>APPLAUSE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>APPLAUD not on slight acquaint∣ance; be not over hasty in thy commendations.</P>
<P>For the deed that speaketh for thy sister, may not be owing to a deserving motive; nor the words of her mouth pro∣ceeding from the sincerity of her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="021184_0020_0FB26E3C41EBF950"/>
By giving applause rashly, thou mayest be reduced to recal thy opinion; and thy praises hereafter, will not avail thy deserving friend.</P>
<P>Commend not thyself with thy lips; but let thine actions speak in thy behalf.</P>
<P>Yet the merit of thy deeds may be lost in ostentation, and she that seeketh praise, will be disappointed therein.</P>
<P>Also, if thou disclaimest the enco∣miums to which thou art fully entitled, they shall be justly taken from thee again.</P>
<P>For she who affecteth to despise com∣mendation, shall not enjoy the privilege thereof.</P>
<P>Be not exalted, though all men com∣mend thee; for thou knowest not but the breath of a whisper may convert their eulogies into revilings.</P>
<P>Give not applause to another, because she bestoweth it on thee; lest the world detect thy motive, and thy words be held in derision.</P>
<P>Dost thou commend another for vir∣tues more conspicuous in thyself, take heed lest thou art accounted the trum∣peter of thine own deservings.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="021184_0021_0FB26E3ED2E53FF0"/>
Be not too cold in the general ap∣plause, yet utter not thy praise without due deliberation.</P>
<P>Praise not a woman to the skies; for her most consummate perfection, is infe∣rior to the angels.</P>
<P>Thy friend will not thank thee for the extravagance of thy praise; for un∣deserved commendation is the severest satire.</P>
<P>Rather at all times approve than ap∣plaud; for the child, and the undistin∣guishing fool, clappeth his hand in ex∣tasy; but the judgment of the under∣standing examineth and approveth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION VIII. <HI>CENSURE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BE not fond of reproving, for she who assumeth the place of a cen∣sor, will be esteemed arrogant; and she who reproveth others, must look well to her own conduct.</P>
<P>For the ill example of the reprover is a scandal to her office, as the mal∣conduct
<PB N="22" REF="021184_0022_0FB26E3FD4388768"/>of the preceptor bringeth his precepts into contempt.</P>
<P>Beware how thou censurest, lest in like manner thou art censured.</P>
<P>Trust not to the appearance of a crime, nor to the breath of report.</P>
<P>For as the specious shew of virtue may be hypocrisy, so the appearance of ill may be sometimes deceit.</P>
<P>The news of the day may awaken suspicion, but justice condemneth not without strict examination.</P>
<P>The report that prevaileth, may be the workings of envy; and envy is un∣charitable and delighteth in false ac∣cusations.</P>
<P>Prejudice is unjust; for the look is not the true index of the mind; neither doth a day, or a week, discover the behaviour of a stranger.</P>
<P>Be tender of the good name of others, so mayest thou find the same tenderness toward thine own indiscre∣tions.</P>
<P>If thou art forced to condemn, con∣demn with gentleness and compassion; so shall thy praises last longer than thy
<PB N="23" REF="021184_0023_0FB26E49884CC568"/>beauty, and thy reputation, from the ornament of thy youth, become the comfort of thy age.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IX. <HI>INSINUATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET not thy praises savour of iro∣ny; nor thy compassion be mixed with evil reflections.</P>
<P>Insinuation is sly; the breath of her mouth is subtle, and penetrateth unob∣served into the heart of her that hear∣eth.</P>
<P>It is sharp as the east wind; it blast∣eth wherever it blows.</P>
<P>It is poisonous as the breath of the slow-worm; it is venemous as the lick of the young adder.</P>
<P>She affecteth to pity the backslidings of her friend; yet she taketh an op∣portunity to spread the knowledge of them abroad.</P>
<P>She speaketh in all gentleness of her neighbour, and concludeth wishing things were otherwise with her.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="021184_0024_0FB26E4AE24354F0"/>
She crieth, it is hard to judge; but saith, can every body be deceived?</P>
<P>The glance of her eye conveyeth evil thoughts, and the motion of her head giveth room for the apprehension of ill.</P>
<P>If she pointeth with her finger, yet sayeth nothing; her looks are more significant than the strongest phrase of speech.</P>
<P>Her silence is more destructive than the clamours of the loudest calumny.</P>
<P>Insinuation is barbarous and full of guile, she putteth on the face of friend∣ship to abuse.</P>
<P>She smileth while she stabbeth to the heart; she woundeth where she pre∣tendeth love.</P>
<P>Be open in thy censure, or censure not; for he who deserveth not reproof, should be free from the breath of suspi∣cion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. <HI>AFFECTATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHO is she that cometh tripping with nice, mincing steps; whose tongue lispeth sweetness, and whose form is not her own;</P>
<P>She hath put off herself, and decked her with the borrowed plumes of others, by whom she is despised.</P>
<P>She affecteth melody of voice, and harmony of speech, and wisdom, and importance, and dignity of deportment.</P>
<P>Her dress is antic and singular, her attire is gaudy or rich to excess.</P>
<P>She hath forgotten how to tread; she neither danceth nor walketh along.</P>
<P>She distorteth her features to appear lovely, she laugheth at nothing to shew the beauty of her teeth.</P>
<P>She washeth her cheeks till the native bloom departeth away; then painteth with the artificial rose.</P>
<P>She placeth herself in the midst of an assembly; she delighteth to dance
<PB N="26" REF="021184_0026_0FB26E51D7DCEEB8"/>alone, she sitteth in the foremost seat of the theatre.</P>
<P>She is pleased to hear herself speak; she listneth not to the voice of another.</P>
<P>She breaketh in upon the discourse of her sister, and finisheth the sentence her neighbour hath begun.</P>
<P>She taketh on her to instruct the wiser than herself, and to teach what she understandeth not.</P>
<P>Dost thou laugh at her folly, she will pity thy ignorance, and go on in her own way.</P>
<P>She is incorrigible till she seeth her∣self in the form of another; yet even that may not make her sensible of her error.</P>
<P>Beware, O daughter of beauty, lest thou art misled by affectation; for thou wilt be neglected by others, till by re∣flection thou discoverest the cause, and art led to despise thyself.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. <HI>MODESTY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD the daughter of inno∣cence! how beautiful is the mild∣ness of her countenance! how lovely is the diffidence of her looks!</P>

<P>He that robbed thee of it, will de∣spise thee, and expose thy want; and she that hath in secret forfeited her own, will hold thee in much contempt.</P>
<P>Behold the house of incontinence; the mark of infamy is indelibly stamped on the threshold, and on the posts of the door.</P>
<P>At the window sitteth misfortune forcing a smile; and within are remorse and disease, and irretrievable misery.</P>
<P>The children of her house are the curse of their mothers, and their lives the growing monuments of their in∣famy.</P>

<P>Her behaviour winneth the stranger, and endeareth her to those of her ac∣quaintance.</P>
<P>Do her steps lead to the house of mourning, she cometh not in dancing; neither doth the lightness of her heart disgust the wedded to cal unity.</P>
<P>She weepeth with those that weep, she laugheth with those who laugh; she singeth in the house of gladness, and rejoiceth in the joy of her neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>She giveth not her advice to the stranger, nor openeth her lips among a

<P>Art thou deceived, she will mildly endeavour to set thee right; but if thou art froward to be instructed, she will permit thee to enjoy thy opinion undisturbed: so shalt thou praise her when thou findest out thy error, for having so modestly left thee in thy de∣ception.</P>
<P>She is the sister of moderation; she denieth none the privilege of thinking for themselves.</P>

<P>AS the tenderness of a mother in the hour of thy distress, as the love of a father in the day of thy trou∣ble, so is the help of a friend in the time of need.</P>
<P>Dost thou think thou hast many friends, do they profess much love, are they lavish in their promises of kindness; be not credulous, nor rely on the form of set speeches.</P>
<P>The breath of the mouth is cheap and costeth nothing, and the tongue moveth slippery within, but the heart is often unacquainted therewith.</P>
<P>Hast thou tried their sincerity, hast thou experienced the veracity of their
<PB N="36" REF="021184_0036_0FB26E750E464048"/>promises, have they served thee when thou stoodst in need of their assistance; yet, for all this, beware how far thou confidest in them.</P>
<P>Try them once and again, and at the third time they may cast thee off, and say thou troublest them too often.</P>
<P>Hast thou a friend, put it not in her power to be much thine enemy, if thou can'st avoid the necessity thereof; for thou knowest not how slight an occa∣sion may turn her heart against thee.</P>
<P>Thy bent of inclination, thy agree∣able accomplishments, may excite many to a shew of amity, for a while; but friendship dwelleth not in outward ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>Thou art not indebted for their kind∣ness, the favour thou receivest is but the price of thy talents, and their own interest the motive of their good-will towards thee.</P>
<P>There are those who make friend∣ships on purpose to betray; who confer obligations, that they may exact obedi∣ence.</P>
<P>Who think they have a right to com∣mand thee; thy life and thy reputation,
<PB N="37" REF="021184_0037_0FB26E7693F02428"/>they will boast as the effect of their ten∣derness, and thy success as their care toward thee.</P>
<P>Have no confidence in these; neither desire to be entrusted with the privacies of their actions.</P>
<P>Who giveth thee a secret and enjoin∣eth thy silence, she doth it that she may have the pleasure of telling it herself.</P>
<P>Yet let not thy distrust stir up ingrati∣tude. The favour of the day deserveth the thanks thereof, till the injury of to morrow cancels the obligation.</P>
<P>Is there a friend indeed, thou wilt know her when thy acquaintance for∣sake thee: will she defend thy inno∣cence when all men accuse thee falsely, will she bear reproach unjustly, for thy sake? take her to thy bosom; she is a jewel of an high price, a diamond of inestimable value.</P>

Art thou modest, art thou chaste, is thy reputation unsullied, is thy fame spotless as the new-fallen snow; yet elegance will make thee still more wor∣thy admiration.</P>
<P>As the crow or the raven, which de∣vour carrion on the hills of the north, differ from the singing bird of the Ca∣naries, so differeth the elegant woman from her who is wanting therein.</P>
<P>As the elegance of dress adds grace to beauty itself, so delicacy in behavi∣our is the ornament of the most beau∣tiful mind.</P>
<P>Discover not the knowledge of things, it is not expected thou shouldst under∣stand; for as the experience of a ma∣tron ill becometh the lips of a virgin, so a pretended ignorance is often better than a shew of real knowledge.</P>
<P>Undistinguishing levity giveth hourly offence, and the form of solemnity be∣comes unseemly when it lasteth too long.</P>
<P>Is there a word that will offend, is there a tale thy companion chuseth not to hear; avoid it in thy discourse; so shall she honour thy prudence, and ap∣plaud thy good-nature.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="021184_0039_0FB26E806C529A78"/>
Art thou lettered, let not the diffi∣culty of thy speech puzzle the ignorant; lest, instead of admiring thy knowledge, they condemn thee for pride and affec∣tation.</P>
<P>Yet let thy words be choice as the matter of thy speech, nor pervert the elegance of thy phrase to suit the gross apprehension of the weak and injudi∣cious.</P>
<P>Perspicuity will never force thee to be indelicate, or to forget thou shouldst support the elegance of a woman.</P>
<P>Let thy actions be proportioned to thy speech, so shalt thou gain respect; for whoso setteth a watch over the breath of her lips, will preserve the work of her hands free from blame.</P>

<P>The hand which lavishly distributeth its goods, will at length close its singers in emptiness.</P>
<P>Profusion lasteth not for ever; the daughters of riot will become the chil∣dren of poverty.</P>
<P>Who streweth her money in the streets is not generous; who giveth it vainly away is as guilty of waste.</P>
<P>Hast thou enough, preserve it for thine own use; hast thou too much, bestow it, that those who merit, may not want bread.</P>
<P>What thou bestowest on the deserving, is not the voluntary gift of thine hands, but a debt thou owest, and art bound in justice to pay.</P>
<P>The meritorious are entitled to thy superfluities: if thou keepest it from them, thou committest an act of injus∣tice, and wrongest thy neighbour of his right.</P>
<P>If thou givest it to the undeserving stranger, thou givest away the property of another: it is no charity.</P>

<P>Be frugal therefore in that which thou employest for the use of those who need, as in that which thou keep∣est for thyself.</P>
<P>Waste not the substance of the de∣serving poor, nor wrong him of his inheritance.</P>
<P>His merit is a right, and as just as thy immediate possession.</P>
<P>Who hath riches that are a burden to herself, she is not frugal.</P>
<P>Doth she waste them by hoarding them in secret, doth she cast them away in riot and profuseness; she cheateth herself, and abuseth her trust: for the miser and the prodigal defraud both the world and themselves.</P>

Are thy pleasures dearer than thine offspring, dost thou become cruel like the ostrich of the wilderness, art thou har∣dened against thy young ones as though they were not thine; they shall live to look coldly on thee, they shall not re∣gard thee as a mother, in the days of thy widowhood.</P>
<P>Dost thou refuse them nourishment from the fountain of their life, the sea monsters draw out the breast and give suck to their young, but the milk of human kindness is denied to her children.</P>
<P>Dote not on the idol of thy womb, for the extreme fondness of a mother is as dangerous as the violence of her hate.</P>
<P>Thy darling shall be taken from thee in the excess of thy love; or if it live, it shall grieve thine eye and consume thine heart, it shall bring a curse upon thee, and not a blessing.</P>
<P>In the morning of infancy, when the dawn of reason appears, learn thy child obedience.</P>
<P>On this foundation thou mayst build high towers; this clay thou mayst mould into what form thou pleasest.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="021184_0056_0FB26EB1E063F248"/>
An obedient mind is ductile and ten∣der, but a stubborn breast taketh no im∣pression.</P>
<P>As the young osier groweth as it is bent, as the shoot of the vine curleth as we list; so is a young child in the hands of its mother.</P>
<P>Correct betimes; lest thy indulgence be cruel, and evil become habitual.</P>
<P>Trust not a servant with the educa∣tion of thy son, nor a maid servant with the tuition of thy daughter.</P>
<P>Study the temper and capacity of thine offspring, and model thy reproof and severity in proportion thereto.</P>
<P>Let not the austerity of a parent de∣ny complacence to its own child; lest it descend to familiarity with servitude, and listen to mischiefs of flattery and insinu∣ation.</P>
<P>Make thy daughter thy companion, so shall she become thy friend, the yoke of duty will be light, and the obliga∣tions of the child become the voluntary offices of good-will towards thee.</P>
<P>Is thy daughter beautiful, lead her not into the public haunts for admirati∣on; for the way of a virgin, just rising
<PB N="57" REF="021184_0057_0FB26EB35576CFE0"/>to the estate of woman, is a path where the nicest foot will slip, if the hand bear∣eth not on the staff of education.</P>
<P>Let not the bowels of the mother pe∣trify against her child, let her not cast off her daughter to misery.</P>
<P>Sell her not; neither make a sacrifice of her youth to the power of gold.</P>
<P>As those who offer immolations to Moloch, so are the idolaters of Mam∣mon.</P>
<P>Let not thy conduct be a reproach to thy precepts; lest thy daughter disre∣gard thee, and say, thou teachest others, but teachest not thyself.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. <HI>AUTHORITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ART thou supreme in thine own house, or art thou second, in dele∣gated authority; trust not the concerns of thy family to a servant.</P>
<P>Tempt not thy domestics, by putting confidence in them; give them not room to be merely eye-servants.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="021184_0058_0FB26EB4D0344508"/>
Dost thou raise one above the rest; let him be such whose merit is conspi∣cuous; so shalt thou excite commenda∣ble emulation in his fellows.</P>
<P>Let not the number of thy servants exceed the business of the day; for the hand that wanteth employment, is rea∣dy to lay hold on mischief.</P>
<P>An unprofitable servant is a scandal to his master, he bewrayeth the hand that provideth him bread.</P>
<P>The vice of thy servant will be a re∣proach to thine house, for he goeth by the name of his mistress.</P>
<P>If he serve thee faithfully, cast not off thy servant in distress; neither let him ask thee for his wages.</P>
<P>The detention of the price of the hireling is injustice, and exciteth him to be his own pay-master.</P>
<P>Let not the deserving feel the weight of his servitude; neither bid the best of thine houshold sit down at thy table.</P>
<P>The reward of a good servant should be much favour, but familiarity will bring thy kindness into contempt.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIII. <HI>WIDOWHOOD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IS thy love stronger than death, do thy affections survive the decease of thine husband? doth thy flame burn un∣extinguished, even as the funeral lamp of the sepulchre?</P>
<P>The obligations thou liest under, are sacred to the remains of him thou lov∣est.</P>
<P>Be not pompous in the burial of the body, but embalm his memory and per∣fume it with fragrance of his virtues.</P>
<P>Let his frailties sleep with him in the grave, let his offences be remembered no more.</P>
<P>The care of a husband's honour is honour to a wife, and the tenderness to preserve it is most comely to the widow.</P>
<P>Art thou guardian to thy children, wrong not the fatherless.</P>
<P>The orphan and the widow, are joined in calamity; therefore let them not rise up against each other.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="021184_0060_0FB26EBE1AE7F468"/>
Art thou young and seekest a second espousal, experience hath not made thee wise.</P>
<P>Thou art as a galley-slave, who, in the madness of joy for his liberty, run∣neth himself again into bondage.</P>
<P>Art thou ancient, yet seekest the em∣braces of a young spouse, he will be the bane of thy latter days; he will bring jealousy to thine heart, and misery to thy gray hairs.</P>
<P>He will think himself a living body tied to a dead carcass, and hold thee loathed in his sight.</P>
<P>Dost thou think to fix the giddy ap∣potite of youth? thou mayst buy beau∣ty, but it will not become thee; thou mayst paint, but it will not make thee fair.</P>
<P>When thou art dressed for the bridal morn, men shall say, is this decking for the living, thou deceivest thyself; if for the dead, make haste to follow him.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIV. <HI>RELIGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BRIGHT as the morning star, dress∣ed in the radiance of the sun-beams, cometh the seraph of immortality.</P>
<P>She approacheth in white robes, her eye is fixed on the heavens, her knee is humbled in the dust, she giveth laws to the daughters of women.</P>
<P>She teacheth the way of virtue, her precepts are simplicity and truth.</P>
<P>Her profession is pure and undefiled, her temple is not filled with priests.</P>
<P>The duties she enjoineth, are plain and easy; she dealeth not in the systems of speculation and vain philosophy.</P>
<P>She perplexeth not the mind with the hypotheses of scepticism, neither the ca∣villers nor the sophists are the teachers of her precepts.</P>
<P>Attend to her counsel, and abide by her instructions; so shall peace be the companion of thy reflections, and hap∣piness the partner of thy contemplations.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="021184_0062_0FB26EC199BC41C0"/>
In the practice of piety is satisfaction on earth, and its reward is on high, in the regions of bliss and immortality.</P>
