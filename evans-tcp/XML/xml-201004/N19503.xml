<HEAD>Extracts from D. <HI>SOME'S</HI> recommen∣datory Preface to the following Ser∣mons.</HEAD>
<P>"THE neglect of the rising ge∣neration, which so general∣ly prevails, ought, surely, to a∣waken our serious concern for it; and I persuade myself, that the pre∣sent attempt will be welcome to all who are duly impressed with that concern; for, so far as I am capa∣ble of judging, it is well adapted to answer its intended purposes.</P>
<P>"As the subject of these sermons is no matter of controversy, but plain and important duty, one would hope, they will not fall un∣der the severe censure of any. At least I am fully persuaded that hum∣ble and serious christians, whose chief concern is to know, and do their duty, will find agreeable en∣tertainment and much profitable instruction, in the perusal of them."</P>

<P>Train up a Child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a most amiable and instructive part of the character which <HI>Isaiah</HI> draws of <HI>the great Shepherd</HI> of the church, that <HI>he</HI> should <HI>gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom:</HI> A representation abundantly answered by the tender care which our Redeemer expressed for the weakest of his disciples; and beautifully illu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ted by the endearing condescension, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich he embraced and blessed little infants. Nor is it foreign to the present
<PB N="6" REF="025410_0005_0FCCE30EF7CF1C00"/>
purpose to observe, that when he recom∣mends to Peter the care of his flock, as the most important and acceptable evidence of his sincere affection to his person, he varies the phrase; in one place, saying, <HI>feed my sheep,</HI> and in the other, <HI>feed my lambs.</HI> Perhaps it might be intended in part to intimate, that the care of a gospel-minister, who would in the most agreeable manner approve his love to his master, should extend itself to the rising genera∣tion, as well as to those of a maturer age, and more considerable standing in the church. It is in obedience to his autho∣rity, and from a regard to his interest; that I am now entering on the work of ca∣techising, which I shall introduce with some practical discourses, <HI>on the education of children,</HI> the subject which is now be∣fore us.</P>
<P>I persuade myself, that you, my friends, will not be displeased to hear, that I intend to handle it at large, and to make it the employment of more than a single Sabbath. A little reflection may convince you, that I could hardly offer any thing to your con∣sideration of greater importance; and that, humanly speaking, there is nothi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in which the comfort of families, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>¦rity of nations, the salvation of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> interest of a Redeemer, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="025410_0006_0FCCE3395569FAB8"/>
GOD, is more apparently and intimately concerned.</P>
<P>I very readily allow, that no human en∣deavours, either of ministers or parents, can ever be effectual to bring one soul to the saving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST, without the co-operating and transforming influences of the Blessed Spirit: Yet you well know, and I hope you seriously consi∣der, that this does not in the least weaken our obligation to the most diligent use of proper means. The great GOD hath stated rules of operation in the world of grace, as well as of nature; and though he is not li∣mited to them, it is arrogant, and may be destructive, to expect that he should devi∣ate from them in favour of us or our's.</P>
<P><HI>We live not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD:</HI> and were he determined to conti∣nue your lives, or the lives of your chil∣dren, he could no doubt feed or support you by miracle: Yet you think yourselves obliged to a prudent care for your daily bread, and justly conclude that were you to neglect to administer it to your infant off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pring, you would be chargeable with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> murder before GOD and man; nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you think of pleading it as any ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> that you referred them to a miracu∣lous, divine care, whilst you left them de∣stitute
<PB N="8" REF="025410_0007_0FCCE33A574E6670"/>
of any human supplies. Such a plea would only add impiety to cruelty, and greatly aggravate the crime it attempted to palliate. As absurd would it be for us, to flatter ourselves with a hope that our chil∣dren should be taught of GOD, and regen∣erated and sanctified by the influences of his grace, if we neglect that prudent and religious care in their education, which it is my business this day to describe and re∣commend, and which Solomon urges in the words of my text: <HI>Train up a child in the way in which he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>I need not offer you many critical re∣marks on so plain and intelligible a passage. You will easily observe, that it consists of an important advice, addressed to the par∣ents and governors of children. <HI>Train up a child in the way he should go;</HI> and also of a weighty reason by which it is inforced, <HI>and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>The general sense is undoubtedly retain∣ed in our translation, as it commonly is: but here, as in many other places, some∣thing of the original energy and beauty is lost.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word, which we rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>train up,</HI> does sometimes signify, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general, to initiate into some science or
<PB N="9" REF="025410_0008_0FCCE362D658B400"/>
discipline; and very frequently, to apply any new thing to the use for which it was intended. It is e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecially used of sacred things, which were solemnly dedicated, or set apart to the service of GOD: And per∣haps it may here be intended to intimate, that a due care is to be taken in the educa∣tion of children, from a principle of reli∣gion, as well as of prudence and humanity; and that our instructions should lead them to the knowledge of GOD, and be adapted to form them for his service, as well as to engage them to personal and social virtue.</P>
<P>It is added, that a child should be train∣ed up <HI>in the way in which he should go;</HI> which seems to be more exactly rendered by others, at the entrance or from the be∣ginning of his way, to express the early care which ought to be taken to prevent the prevalency of irregular habits, by en∣deavouring, from the first dawning of rea∣son, to direct it aright, and to infuse into the tender unpractised mind, the important maxim of wisdom and goodness.</P>
<P>To encourage us to this care, the Wise Man assures us, that we may reasonably expect the most happy consequence from it: That if the young traveller be thus di∣rected to set out well in the journey of life, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is a fair prospect that he will go on to its most distant stages with increasing
<PB N="10" REF="025410_0009_0FCCE3646BBC1B20"/>
honour and happiness.—<HI>Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>I shall endeavour to illustrate and inforce this important advice in the following me∣thod, which appears to me the most natur∣al, and for that reason the most eligible.</P>
<P N="1">I. I shall more particularly mark out the way in which children are to be trained up.</P>
<P N="2">II. Offer some plain and serious consi∣derations to awaken you to this pious and necessary care.</P>
<P N="3">III. Direct to the manner in which the attempt is to be made, and the precautions which are to be used in order to render it effectual. And then,</P>
<P N="4">IV. I will conclude the whole with a more particular application, suited to your different characters, relations, and circum∣stances of life.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that it is a very deli∣cate as well as important subject, which is now before me; I have therefore thought myself obliged more attentively to weigh what has occurred to my own meditations, more diligently to consult the sentiments of others, and above all, more earnestly to seek those divine influences, without which I know, I am unequal to the easiest task▪
<PB N="11" REF="025410_0010_0FCCE365DBA69148"/>
but in dependance on which, I chearfully attempt one of the most difficult. The re∣sult of the whole I humbly offer to your candid examination; not pretending at a∣ny time to dictate in an authoritative man∣ner, and least of all on such an occasion as this; but rather speaking as to wise men, who are themselves to judge what I say.— May the divine assistance and blessing at∣tend us in all!</P>
<P>First, I am to describe the way in which children are to be trained up.</P>
<P>Our translation, as I have told you, though not very literal, is agreeable to the sense of the original, <HI>The way in which the child should go.</HI> And undoubtedly this is no other, than the good old way; the way of serious practical religion: The way which GOD has in his word marked out for us; the way which all the children of God have trodden in every succeeding age; the way, the only way, in which we and our's can find rest to our souls.</P>
<P>But it is not proper to leave the matter thus generally explained. I would there∣fore more particularly observe—that it is the way of piety towards GOD—and of fairly in our Lord JESUS CHRIST;—the way of obedience to parents, and of bene∣volence to all—the way of diligence, and of integrity; the way of humility, and of
<PB N="12" REF="025410_0011_0FCCE36751E22BB8"/>
self-denial. I am persuaded, that each of these particulars will deserve your serious attention and regard.</P>
<P N="1">1. Children should undoubtedly be trained up in the way of piety and devotion towards GOD.</P>
<P>This, as you well know, is the sum and the foundation of every thing truly good. <HI>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.</HI> The Psalmist therefore invites children to him, with the promise of in∣structing them in it; <HI>Come, ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</HI> And it is certain, some right notions of the supreme Being must be implanted in the minds of chil∣dren, before there can be a reasonable foundation for teaching them those doc∣trines which peculiarly relate to CHRIST under the character of the Mediator; for he who comes unto GOD (by him) must believe that he is, and that he is the re∣warder of them who diligently seek him.</P>
<P>The proof of the Being of GOD, and some of those attributes of the divine nature in which we are most concerned, depends on such easy principles, that I cannot but think, the weakest mind might enter into it. A child will easily apprehend, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="13" REF="025410_0012_0FCCE369DFB493C0"/>
every house is built by some man, and there can be no work without an author; so <HI>he that built all things is GOD.</HI> And from this obvious idea of GOD, as the ma∣ker of all, we may naturally represent him as very great and very good, that they may be taught at once to reverence and love him.</P>
<P>It is of great importance, that children early imbibe an awe of GOD, and an hum∣ble veneration for his perfections and glo∣ries. He ought therefore to be represented to them as the great LORD OF ALL; and when we take occasion to mention to them other invisible agents, whether Angels or devils, we should, as Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> has most judiciously observed, always represent them as entirely under the government and con∣troul of GOD, that no sentiments of admi∣ration of good spirits, or terror of the bad, may distract their tender minds, or in∣fringe on those regards which are the in∣communicable prerogative of the GREAT SUPREME.</P>
<P>There should be a peculiar caution, that when we teach these infant tongues to pro∣nounce that great and terrible name, THE LORD OUR GOD, they may not learn to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it in vain; but may use it with a be∣coming solemnity, as remembering that we and they are <HI>but dust and ashes before him.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="025410_0013_0FCCE36B1DD3D570"/>
When I hear the little creatures speaking of "the great GOD, the blessed GOD, the glorious GOD," as I sometimes do, it gives me a sensible pleasure, and I consider it as a probable proof of great wisdom and piety, in those who have the charge of their educa∣tion.</P>
<P>Yet great care should be taken not to confine our discourses to these awful views, least the dread of GOD should so fall upon them, as that his excellencies should make them afraid to approach him. We should describe him, as not only the greatest, but the best of beings. We should teach them to know him by the most encouraging name of <HI>the LORD, the LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and a∣bundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, and forgiving iniquity, trans∣gression and sin.</HI> We should represent him as the universal, kind, indulgent parent, who loves his creatures, and by all proper methods provides for their happiness. And we should particularly represent his goodness to them; with what more than parental tenderness, he watched round their cradles; with what compassion he heard their feeble cries, before their infant thoughts could form themselves into pray∣er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ We should tell them that they live eve∣ry m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment on GOD; and that all our affec∣tion
<PB N="15" REF="025410_0014_0FCCE36CCB077C80"/>
for them, is no more than he puts in∣to our hearts; and all our power to help them, no more than he lodges in our hands.</P>
<P>We should also solemnly remind them, that in a very little while their spirits are to return to this GOD; that as he is now al∣ways with them, and knows every thing they do, or speak, or think, so he will bring every work into judgment, and make them for ever happy or miserable, as they on the whole are found obedient or rebel∣lious. And here the most lively and pa∣thetic descriptions, which the scriptures give us, of heaven and of hell, should be laid before them, and urged on their con∣sideration.</P>
<P>When such a foundation is laid, in the belief of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being and providence of GOD, and of a future state both of rewards and punishments, children should be instructed in the duty they owe to GOD, and should be particularly taught to pray to him and to praise him. It would be best of all, if from a deep sense of his perfections, and their own necessities, they could be engag∣ed to breath out their souls before him in words of their own, were they ever so weak and broken. Yet you will readily allow, that till this can be expected, it may be very proper to teach them some form of
<PB N="16" REF="025410_0015_0FCCE36E6FA6AB60"/>
prayer and thanksgiving, consisting of such plain scriptures, or other familiar expres∣sions, as may best suit their circumstances and understandings. If the Lord's Prayer be taught them, as a form, I hope you will consider how comprehensive the ex∣pressions are; how fast the ideas rise and vary; and consequently how necessary it is, that it be frequently and largely ex∣plained to them; lest the repetition of it degenerate into a mere ceremony, as I fear it does among many, who are perhaps most zealous for its use.</P>
<P>But what I have said, on this head, of piety and devotion, must be considered in an inseparable connection with what I am to add under the next.</P>
<P N="2">2. Children must be trained up in the way of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>You know, my friends, and I hope ma∣ny of you know it to the daily joy of your souls, that CHRIST is the way, the truth, and the life; and that it is by him we have boldness and access with confidence to a GOD, who might otherwise appear as a consuming fire. It is therefore of great importance to lead children betimes into the knowledge of CHRIST, which is, no doubt, a considerable part of that nurture
<PB N="17" REF="025410_0016_0FCCE36FA161D278"/>
and admonition of the Lord, which the Apostle recommends, and was perhaps what he principally intended by those words.</P>
<P>We should therefore teach them betimes, that the first parents of the human race, most ungratefully rebelled against GOD, and subjected themselves and all their off∣spring to his wrath and curse. The awful consequences of this should be opened at large, and we should labour to convince them, that they have made themselves lia∣ble to the divine displeasure (that dreadful thing!) by their own personal guilt; and thus by the knowledge of the law should we make way for the gospel, the joyful news of deliverance by CHRIST.</P>
<P>In unfolding this, great care ought to be taken that we do not fill their minds with an aversion to one Sacred Person, while we endeavour to attract their regards to another. The FATHER is not to be re∣presented as severe, and almost inexorable; hardly prevailed upon by the intercession of his compassionate SON to entertain thoughts of mercy and forgiveness. Far from that, we should speak of him as the overflowing fountain of goodness, whose eye pitied us in our helpless distress, whose almighty arm was stretched out for our res∣cue, whose eternal counsels of wisdom and
<PB N="18" REF="025410_0017_0FCCE3712D7E4168"/>
love formed that important scheme to which we owe all our hopes. I have often had occasion to shew you at large, that this is the scripture doctrine; our children should be early taught it, and taught what that scheme was, so far as their under∣standings can receive it, and our's can ex∣plain it. We should often repeat it to them, that GOD is so holy, and yet so gra∣cious, that rather than he would on the one hand destroy man, or on the other leave sin unpunished, he made his own son a sacrifice for it, appointing him to be humbled, that we might be exalted, to die, that we might live.</P>
<P>We should also represent to them (with holy wonder and joy) how readily the Lord Jesus consented to procure our deliverance in so expensive a way. How chearfully he said, <HI>Lo, I come! I delight to do thy will, O my GOD!</HI> To enhance the value of this amazing love, we should endeavour, ac∣cording to our weak capacities, to teach them who this compassionate Redeemer is; to represent something of his glories as the eternal SON of GOD, and the great Lord of angels and men. We should instruct them in his amazing condescension in lay∣ing aside these glories, that he might be∣come a little, weak, helpless child, and af∣terwards an afflicted▪ sorrowful man. We
<PB N="19" REF="025410_0018_0FCCE37352A210B8"/>
should lead them into the knowledge of those circumstances of the history of Jesus, which may have the greatest tendency to strike their minds, and to impress them with an early sense of gratitude and love to him. We should tell them, how poor he made himself, that he might enrich us; how diligently he went about doing good; how willingly he preached the gospel to the lowest of the people. And we should especially tell them how kind he was to lit∣tle children, and how he chid his disciples when they would have hindered them from being brought to him: It is expressly said, JESUS <HI>was much displeased, and said, suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of GOD.</HI> A tender circumstance! which perhaps was recorded (in part at least) for this very reason, that children in succeeding ages might be impressed and affected with it.</P>
<P>Through these scenes of his life we should lead them on to his death: We should shew how easily he could have deli∣vered himself (of which he gave so sensible an evidence, in striking down by one word, those who came to apprehend him;) and yet how patiently he submitted to the most cruel injuries, to be scourged and spit upon, to be crowned with thorns, and to bear the cross. We should shew them, how
<PB N="20" REF="025410_0019_0FCCE37416825C10"/>
this innocent, holy, divine person was <HI>brought as a lamb to the slaughter;</HI> and while they were piercing him with nails, instead of loading them with curses, he prayed for them, saying, <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,</HI> And when their little hearts are awed and melted with so strange a story, we should tell them, it was thus he groaned, and bled, and died for us, and often remind them of their own concern in what was then trans∣acted.</P>
<P>We should lead on their thoughts to the glorious views of Christ's resurrection and ascension; and tell them with what adora∣ble goodness he still remembers his people in the midst of his exaltation; pleading the cause of sinful creatures, and employing his interest in the court of heaven, to pro∣cure life and glory for all who believe in him, and love him.</P>
<P>We should then go on to instruct them in those particulars of obedience, by which the sincerity of our faith and our love is to be approved; at the same time reminding them of their own weakness, and telling them how GOD helps us, by sending his holy SPIRIT to dwell in our hearts, to fur∣nish us for every good word and work. An important lesson, without attending to
<PB N="21" REF="025410_0020_0FCCE375AB39A4B0"/>
which our instruction will be vain, and their hearing will likewise be vain!</P>
<P N="3">3. Children should be trained up in the way of obedience to their parents.</P>
<P>This is a command which GOD recom∣mended from Mount Sinai, by annexing to it a particular promise of long life; a bles∣sing which young persons greatly desire. The Apostle therefore observes, that it is <HI>the first commandment with promise,</HI> i. e. a command eminently remarkable for the manner in which the promise is adjoined. And it is certainly a wise constitution of Providence, that gives so much to parental authority, especially while children are in their younger years, their minds being then incapable of judging and acting for them∣selves in matters of importance. Children should therefore be early taught and con∣vinced by scripture, that GOD has commit∣ted them into the hands of their parents; and consequently that reverence and obedi∣ence to their parents, is a part of the duty they owe to GOD, and disobedience to them, is rebellion against him. And par∣ents should by no means indulge their chil∣dren in a direct and resolute opposition to their will in matters of greater or smaller moment; remembering, that a child left
<PB N="22" REF="025410_0021_0FCCE3781E6D4A98"/>
to himself, brings his parents to shame, and himself to ruin; and with regard to sub∣jection, as well as affection, <HI>it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Children should be trained up in the way of benevolence and kindness to all.</P>
<P>The great Apostle tells us that <HI>love is the fulfilling of the law,</HI> and that all those branches of it, which relate to our neigh∣bour, are comprehended in that one word, <HI>love.</HI> This love therefore we should endea∣vour to teach them; and we shall find, that in many instances it will be a law to it∣self; and guide them right in many parti∣cular actions, the obligations to which may depend on principles of equity, which lie far beyond the reach of their feeble under∣standings. There is hardly an instruction relating to our duty more happily adapted to the capacity of children, than that golden law (so important to all of the maturest age) <HI>Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, do ye so unto them.</HI> This rule we should teach them, and by this should examine their actions. From their cradles we should often inculcate it upon them, that a great deal of religion consists in do∣ing good; that <HI>the wisdom from above is full of mercy and good fruits;</HI> and that eve∣ry
<PB N="23" REF="025410_0022_0FCCE37960053C30"/>
christian <HI>should do good unto all as he has opportunity.</HI></P>
<P>That such instructions may be welcome to them, we should endeavour, by all pru∣dent methods, to soften their hearts to sen∣timents of humanity and tenderness, and guard against every thing that would have a contrary tendency. We should remove from them as much as possible, all kinds of cruel and bloody spectacles, and should carefully discourage any thing barbarous in their treatment of brute creatures; by no means allowing them to sport themselves in the death or pain of domestic animals, but rather teaching them to treat the poor creatures kindly, and take care of them; the contrary to which is a most detestable sign of a savage and malignant disposition. The merciful <HI>man regardeth the life of his beast.</HI></P>
<P>We should likewise take care to teach them the odiousness and folly of a selfish temper, and encourage them in a willing∣ness to impart to others, what is agreeable and entertaining to themselves: Especially we should endeavour to form them to senti∣ments of compassion for the poor. We should shew them where GOD has said, <HI>Blessed is the man that considereth the poor, the LORD will remember him in the day of trouble. He that hath pity upon the poor,
<PB N="24" REF="025410_0023_0FCCE37AE24289D0"/>
lendeth to the LORD and that which he hath given, will he pay him again.</HI> And we should shew them by our own practices, that we verily believe these promises to be true, and important. It might not be im∣proper sometimes to make our children the messengers, by which we send some small supply to the indigent and distressed; and if they discover a disposition to give some∣thing out of the little stock we allow them to call their own, we should joyfully en∣courage it, and should take care that they never lose by their charity, but that in a prudent manner we abundantly repay it. It is hardly to be imagined that children thus brought up should, in the advance of life, prove injurious and oppressive; they will rather be the ornaments of religion, and blessings to the world, and probably will be in the number of the last whom Pro∣vidence will suffer to want.</P>
<P N="5">5. Children should be trained up in the way of diligence.</P>
<P>This should undoubtedly be our care, if we have any regard to the welfare either of their bodies or their souls. In whatever station of life they may at length be fixed, it is certain there is little prospect of their acquitting themselves with usefulness, hon∣our
<PB N="25" REF="025410_0024_0FCCE37D427DD528"/>
and advantage, without a close and re∣solute application; whereas the wisest of princes and of men has said, <HI>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men.</HI> And it is evident that a diligent pro∣secution of business keeps one out of the way of a thousand temptations, which idle∣ness seems to invite, leading a man into numberless instances of vice and folly, be∣cause he has nothing else to do.</P>
<P>A prudent and religious parent will therefore be concerned, that his children may not early contract so pernicious a ha∣bit, nor enter upon life, like persons who have no business in it, but to crowd the stage, and stand in the way of those who are better employed.—Instead of suffering them to saunter about from place to place (as abundance of young people do, to no imaginable purpose of usefulness, or even of entertainment) he would quickly assign them some employment for their time: An employment so moderated, and so diversi∣fied, as not to overwhelm and fatigue their tender spirits; yet sufficient to keep them wakeful and active. Nor is this so difficult as so many imagine; for children are a bu∣sy kind of creatures, naturally fond of learning new things, and trying and shew∣ing what they can do. So that, I am per∣suaded,
<PB N="26" REF="025410_0025_0FCCE37F54CF1E30"/>
were perfect inactivity to be im∣posed on them as a penance but for one hour, they would be heartily weary of it, and would be glad to seek their refuge from it, in almost any business you would think fit to employ them about.</P>
<P>Thus should they be disciplined in their infant years, should early be taught the va∣lue of time, and early accustomed to im∣prove it, till they grow fit for some calling in life; in which they should at length be placed with this important maxim deeply engraven upon their minds, "That full employ in whatever service they are fixed, is a thing by no means to be dreaded, but on the contrary, greatly to be desired."</P>
<P>I shall conclude this head with the men∣tioning of a very remarkable law amongst the Athenians, which ordained, "That those who had been brought up to no em∣ployment by their parents, should not be obliged to keep them, if they came to want in their old age; which all other (legiti∣mate) children were."</P>
<P N="6">6. Children should be trained up in the way of integrity.</P>
<P>Simplicity and godly sincerity is not on∣ly a very amiable, but an essential part of the christian character; and we are every
<PB N="27" REF="025410_0026_0FCCE380F13B8400"/>
one of us indispensibly obliged to prove ourselves <HI>Israelites indeed, in whom there is no</HI> allowed <HI>guile.</HI> And this is a cir∣cumstance which will peculiarly require our regard in the education of our chil∣dren, and of all young persons under our care.</P>
<P>It is very melancholy to observe, how soon the artifices and deceits of corrupt na∣ture begin to discover themselves. In this respect we are transgressors from the womb, and go astray almost as soon as we are born, speaking lies. Great care there∣fore should be taken to form the minds of children to a love for truth and candor, and a sense of the meanness as well as the guilt of a lie. We should be cautious that we do not expose them to any temptations of this kind, either by unreasonable seve∣rities, on account of little faults, or by hasty surprizes, when enquiring into any matter of fact, which it may seem their in∣terest to disguise by a falsehood: And when we find them guilty of a known and deli∣berate lie, we should express our horror of it, not only by a present reproof or correc∣tion, but by such a conduct towards them for some time afterwards, as may plainly shew them how greatly we are amazed, grieved, and displeased. When so solemn a business is made of the first faults of this
<PB N="28" REF="025410_0027_0FCCE38340B5BF58"/>
kind, it may be a mean of preventing ma∣ny more.</P>
<P>I will further add, that we ought not on∣ly thus severely to animadvert upon a di∣rect lie, but likewise, in a proper degree, to discourage all kinds of equivocations and double meanings, and those little tricks and artifices, by which they may endeavour to impose on each other, or on those who are older than themselves. We should often inculcate upon them that excellent scrip∣ture, <HI>He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; but he that perverteth his way,</HI> (that twists and distorts it with the per∣plexities of artifice and deceit) <HI>shall</HI> (at length) <HI>be known.</HI> Be shewing them every day, how easy, how pleasant, how hon∣ourable, and how advantageous it is to maintain a fair, open, honest temper; and on the other hand, what folly there is in cunning and dishonesty in all its forms; and how certain it is, that by studying and practising it, they take the readiest way to make themselves obnoxious and useless, in∣famous and odious. Above all, should we remind them, that the righteous LORD loved righteousness, and his favourable countenance beholds the upright; but ly∣ing lips are such an abomination to him, that he expressly declares, <HI>All liars shall
<PB N="29" REF="025410_0028_0FCCE385554FFA78"/>
have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Children should be trained up in the way of humility.</P>
<P>This is a grace which our Lord particu∣larly invites us to learn of him, and most frequently recommends to us; well know∣ing that without it, so humbling a scheme as he came to introduce, would never meet with a welcome reception. And with re∣gard to the present life, it is a most lovely ornament, which engages universal esteem and affection; so that before honour is hu∣mility: On the whole we find, <HI>He that ex∣alteth himself is abased, and he that humbleth himself is exalted,</HI> both by GOD and man.</P>
<P>A regard therefore to the ease, honour and happiness of our children, should en∣gage us to an early endeavour of checking that pride, which was the first sin, and the ruin of our natures; and diffuses itself so wide, and sinks so deep, into all who draw their original from degenerate Adam. We should teach them to express humility and modesty in their converse with all.</P>
<P>They should be taught to treat their su∣periors with peculiar respect, and should at proper seasons be accustomed to silence and reserve before them. Hence they will learn
<PB N="30" REF="025410_0029_0FCCE386F8761230"/>
in some degree the government of the tongue; a branch of wisdom, which, in the advance of life, will be of great import∣ance to the quiet of others, and to their own comfort and reputation.</P>
<P>Nor should they be allowed to assume airs of insolence towards their equals; but ra∣ther be taught to yield, to oblige, and to give up their right for the sake of peace. To this purpose I cannot but think it desir∣able, that they should be generally accus∣tomed to treat each other with those forms of civility and complaisance, which are usual among well-bred people in their rank of life. I know these things are mere trifles in themselves, yet they are the out-guards of humanity and friendship, and effectually prevent many a rude attack, which, taking its rise from some little circumstances, may nevertheless be attended with fatal conse∣quences. I thought it proper to mention this here, because (as <HI>Scougal</HI> very justly and elegantly expresses it) "These modes are the shadows of humility, and seem in∣tended to shew our regard for others, and the low thoughts we have of ourselves."</P>
<P>I shall only add farther, that it is great imprudence and unkindness to children, to indulge them in a haughty and imperious behaviour towards those who are most their inferiors. They should be made to under∣stand,
<PB N="31" REF="025410_0030_0FCCE3896B32BF10"/>
that the servants of the family are not <HI>their</HI> servants, nor to be under <HI>their</HI> go∣vernment and controul. I the rather insist upon this, because I have generally observ∣ed, that where young people have been permitted to tyrannize over persons in the lowest circumstances of life, the humour has shamefully grown upon them, till it has diffused insolence and arrogance through their behaviour to all about them.</P>
<P>Lastly, Children should be trained up in the way of self-denial.</P>
<P>As without something of this temper we can never follow CHRIST, or expect to be owned by him as his disciples; so neither indeed can we pass comfortably through the world. For whatever unexperienced youth may dream, a great many distasteful and mortifying circumstances will occur in life, which will unhinge our minds almost every hour, if we cannot manage, and in many instances deny our appetites, our passions, and our humours. We should therefore endeavour to teach our children this important lesson betimes; and if we succeed in our care, we shall leave them abundantly richer and happier, in this rule and possession of their own spirits, than the
<PB N="32" REF="025410_0031_0FCCE38AAA59BC60"/>
most plentiful estates, or the most unlimit∣ed power over others could make them.</P>
<P>When a rational creature becomes the slave of appetite, he sinks beneath the dig∣nity of the human nature, as well as the sanctity of the christian profession. It is therefore observable that when the Apostle mentions the three grand branches of prac∣tical religion, he puts sobriety in the front; perhaps to intimate, that where that is ne∣glected, the other cannot be suitably re∣garded. <Q>The Grace of God, <HI>(i. e. the gospel)</HI> teaches us to live soberly, righteous∣ly, and godly.</Q> Children therefore, as well as young men, should be exhorted to be soberminded:—And they should be taught it by early self-denial. It is certain, that if their own appetite and taste were to determine the kind and quantity of their food, many of them would quickly destroy their constitutions, and perpaps their lives; since they have often the greatest desire for those things which are the most improper. —And it seems justly observed by a very wise man, (who was himself a melancholy instance of it) <Q>That the fondness of mo∣thers for their children, in letting them eat and drink what they will, lays a foun∣dation for most of those calamities in hu∣man life, which proceed from bodily in∣disposition.</Q> Nay, I will add, that it is
<PB N="33" REF="025410_0032_0FCCE38C131521C0"/>
the part of wisdom and love, not only to deny what would be unwholesome, but to guard against indulging them in too great a nicety either of food or dress, people of sense cannot but see, if they would please to consider it, that to know how to fare plainly, and sometimes a little hardly, car∣ries a man with ease and pleasure through many circumstances of life, which to luxu∣ry and delicacy would be almost intolera∣ble.</P>
<P>The government of the passions is an∣other branch of self-denial, to which chil∣dren should early be habituated; and so much the rather because, in an age when reason is so weak, the passions are apt to appear with peculiar force and violence. A prudent care should therefore be taken to repress the exorbitances of them.—For which purpose, it is of great importance, that they never be suffered to carry any point, by obstinacy, noise and clamour, which is indeed to bestow a reward on a fault which deserves a severe reprimand. Nay, I will venture to add, that though it be very inhuman to take pleasure in mak∣ing them uneasy by needless mortifications, yet when they are eagerly and intemperate∣ly desirous of a trifle, they ought, for that very reason, sometimes to be denied it, to teach them more moderation for the fu∣ture.
<PB N="34" REF="025410_0033_0FCCE38D91995F00"/>
And if by such methods, they gra∣dually learn to conquer their little humours and fancies, they learn no inconsiderable branch of true fortitude and wisdom. I cannot express this better, than in the words of Mr. Locke, in his excellent trea∣tise on the subject before us; <Q>He that has found out the way to keep a child's spirit easy, active and free, and yet at the same time to restrain him from many things which he has a mind to, and draw him to things uneasy to him, has got the true secret of education.</Q></P>
<P>I have sometimes been surprised to see, how far a sense of honour and praise has carried some children of a generous temper in a long and resolute course of self denial. But undoubtedly, the noblest principle of all is a sense of religion. Happy would it indeed be, if they were led to see, that there is but very little in this kind of grati∣fications and indulgences; that the world itself is but a poor empty trifle; and that the great thing a rational creature should be concerned about, is to please GOD, and get well to heaven. May divine grace teach us this important lesson for ourselves, that we may transmit it with the greater advantage to our children! AMEN.</P>

<P>Train up a Child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is certainly a very pleasing reflection to every faithful minister of the gospel, that the cause, in which he is engaged, is the most benevolent, as well as the most religi∣ous; subserving the glory of GOD, by pro∣moting the happiness of mankind. It must be a great satisfaction to a man of integri∣ty and humanity, to think that it is not his business to dazzle and confound his hearers with the artifices of speech, to give the ap∣pearances of truth to falshood, and impor∣tance to trifles, but to teach them to weigh things in an impartial balance, and by the words of truth and soberness, to lead them into the paths of wisdom and goodness.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="025410_0035_0FCCE3915066BB00"/>This is a satisfaction which I peculiarly find this day, while I am urging you to that religious care in the education of children, which I have at large opened in the former discourse. And it is a cir∣cumstance of additional pleasure, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleading the cause of the weak and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pless; of little tender creatures, who are incapable of pleading for themselves, and know not how much their interest is concerned. Nor am I without a secret hope, that if the Divine Spirit favour us with his assistance, some who are yet un∣born may have eternal reason to rejoice in the fruits of what you are now to hear, AMEN.</P>
<P>Having already endeavoured to describe the way in which children are to be trained up; I now proceed,</P>
<P>Secondly, To propose some arguments to engage parents to this pious care.</P>
<P>And here I would intreat you distinctly to consider, that the attempt itself is pleas∣ant; you have great reason to hope it may be successful; and that success is of the highest importance.</P>
<P N="1">I. The attempt itself is pleasant.</P>
<P>I speak not merely of the pleasure arising from the consciousness of discharging pre∣sent
<PB N="37" REF="025410_0036_0FCCE393D209F738"/>
duty, and a probable view of future success; such a satisfaction may attend those actions, which are in themselves most painful and mortifying. But I refer to the entertainment immediately flowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the employment itself, when rightly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> aged. This is undoubtedly one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ways of wisdom, which are ways o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>¦antness, as well as a path, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts consequences is peace and happiness: It is a commandment, in keeping of which there is a great reward.</P>
<P>The GOD of nature has wisely annexed a secret, unutterable delight, to all our re∣gular cares for the improvement of our ris∣ing offspring. We rejoice to see our ten∣der plants flourish, to observe how the stock strengthens, and the blossoms and the leaves successively unfold. We trace, with a gradually advancing pleasure, their easy smiles, the first efforts of speech on their stammering tongues, and the dawning of reason in their feeble minds. It is a de∣lightful office to cultivate and assist opening nature, to lead the young strangers into a new world, and to infuse the principles of any useful kind of knowledge which their age may admit, and their circumstances re∣quire. But when we attempt to raise their thoughts to the great FATHER OF SPIRITS, to present them, as in the arms of faith,
<PB N="38" REF="025410_0037_0FCCE39514392B78"/>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this occasion, my friends, I persuade myself, I may appeal to the repeated expe∣rience of many among you. Do you not find, that the sweetest truths of christianity, which are your hope and your joy in this house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your pilgrimage, are peculiarly sweet when you talk them over with your children? Do you not find, that your in∣structions and admonitions to them return into your own bosom with a rich increase of edification and refreshment? Thus while you are watering these domestic planta∣tions, you are watered also yourselves; and from these holy converses with your chil∣dren, you rise to more endearing commu∣nion with your heavenly Father: GOD by by his spirit visiting your souls in the midst of those pious cares, and giving you imme∣diate comfort and strength, as a token of his gracious acceptance, and perhaps as a pledge of future success. This leads me to urge the religious education of chil∣dren.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="025410_0038_0FCCE39690801B18"/>II. By the probability there is, that it will be attended with such success, as to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he means of making them wise and good.</P>

<P>It is true, this assertion is to be under∣stood with some limitation, as expressing the probability, rather than the certainty of the success; otherwise experien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would contradict it in some melancholy instances.

Attend seriously to these remarks, and then judge whether prudence and con∣science will not oblige you to pursue it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The religious education of children is a very rational method of engaging them to walk in the way in which they should go.</P>
<P>There is the most evident advantage at∣tending our early attempts of this kind, that we shall find the mind more open and disengaged, not tainted with all those cor∣rupt principles, nor enslaved to those irre∣gular habits, which they would probably imbibe and contract in the advance of age.
<PB N="41" REF="025410_0040_0FCCE39A6B7DD1D0"/>
Though the paper on which we would write the knowledge of GOD be not entire∣ly fair, it is clear of many a foul inscription and deep blot, with which it would soon be covered. Though the garden, in which we would plant the fruits of holiness, be not free from weeds, yet many of them are but (as it were) in the invisible seed, and the rest are not grown up to that luxuriant size, which we must expect, if due culti∣vation be omitted or delayed.</P>
<P>It is a farther advantage which deserves to be mentioned here, that infancy and childhood is the most impressible age; and as principles are then most easily admitted, so they are most firmly retained. The an∣cients, those judicious observers of human nature, as well as many modern writers, are full of this remark in their discourses on education, and illustrate it by a great many beautiful allusions which are well known.</P>
<P>The new vessel takes a lasting tincture from the liquor which is first poured in: The soft clay is easily fashioned into what form you please: The young plant may be bent with a gentle hand; and the charac∣ters engraved on the tender bark, grow deeper and larger on the advancing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. It will be our wisdom then to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these golden opportunities; and so much the ra∣ther,
<PB N="42" REF="025410_0041_0FCCE39CF297FB08"/>
as it is certain they will either be im∣proved or perverted; and that if they are not pressed into the service of religion, they will be employed as dangerous artillery a∣gainst it.</P>
<P>But you will say, "With all these ad∣vantageous circumstances we cannot infuse grace into the hearts of our children; and after all our precautions, corrupt nature will prevent us and fix a wrong bias on the mind, before we can attempt to direct it aright." A mournful, but too evident truth! which, far from denying or sup∣pressing, I would often declare and incul∣cate; and the rather now, as it greatly confirms my argument. Are the influenc∣es of a degenerate nature unavoidably so strong, and will you suffer them to be con∣firmed by these additional advantages? Do you apprehend, that, running with the footmen, you shall be in danger of fainting; and do you for that very reason chuse to contend with the horsemen? You cannot, sure, in the face of so much reason and scripture, urge this as an excuse against making any attempts at all of this kind; and how then is it an apology for the ne∣glect of those, which are, (other things being equal) the most rational and easy? But the trifling plea is more evidently si∣lenced, by observing,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="43" REF="025410_0042_0FCCE39EC6E7FD78"/>2. The religious education of children is a method which GOD has appointed; and this greatly increases the probability of its success.</P>
<P>I assuredly know (and may GOD more deeply engrave it in our hearts!) that with regard to your labours as well as our's, <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but GOD that giveth the in∣crease.</HI> But consider, I beseech you, how that increase is to be hoped for: Is it in the omission, or in the use of prescribed means? I urge it on your consciences, my friends, that religious education is an ordinance of GOD, which, therefore, you may reasona∣bly hope he will honour with a blessing. And you might as justly expect, that your souls should flourish in an unnecessary ab∣sence from the table and house of the LORD, or an habitual neglect of reading and prayer; as that your children should grow up for GOD, while you fail in your endeavours to engage them in his service. I repeat it again, religious education is an ordinance of GOD. And is it a work of la∣bour and difficulty to prove the assertion? Which of you does not know, that christi∣an parents are solemnly charged to <HI>bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the LORD;</HI> and that even under the
<PB N="44" REF="025410_0043_0FCCE39F9AE354D0"/>
Mosaic oeconomy, GOD urged it on his people in a very affecting manner? Surely you must have observed, how strictly GOD charges it upon the Jews to take all oppor∣tunities to this purpose, occasional as well as stated. <HI>These words,</HI> says he, <HI>which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently to thy chil∣dren, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</HI> And elsewhere, <HI>thou shalt teach them to thy sons, and thy sons sons.</HI> Plainly recommending a care of more re∣mote, as well as immediate descendants of grand-children, as well as children. Thus when GOD <HI>established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, he commanded the fathers, that they should make them known unto their children; that the genera∣tion to come might know them, even the chil∣dren that should be born, that they should arise and declare them to their children;</HI> that so religion might be transmitted to every rising age. You cannot be ignorant of such passages as these, which need no comment to explain them, and consequently you cannot but know, that the religious edu∣cation of children is a divine institution, as well as in itself a most rational attempt: After which you will not wonder to hear,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="45" REF="025410_0044_0FCCE3A1131D66F0"/>3. That it has in fact been attended with very happy success.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that the great GOD does not confine himself to work by this way; and that he sometimes displays his sovereignty in visibly turning out of it. We acknowledge, that he sometimes leaves those who have been, as it were, born and brought up in his family, to forsake it in a very scandalous manner; while he seems to go into the territories of satan; into ig∣norant, carnal, prophane families, and takes from thence persons, whom he erects as trophies of free, surprising, and (as Mr. Howe justly expresses it) "unaccountable grace." But you well know, that these are more rare and uncommon cases: And though some of you, my friends, are (and I hope never will forget it) happy instances of the singular divine goodness; yet most of you, as I apprehend, were trained up in the knowledge of GOD, and are living mo∣numents of the success which has attended the care of parents, or masters in this par∣ticular. The greater part of those, who have of late been admitted to your com∣munion, have, to my certain knowledge, mentioned it with thankfulness; and I re∣joice to think, how many of the rising ge∣neration among us (if even a child may be
<PB N="46" REF="025410_0045_0FCCE69C0AF490C0"/>
known by his doings) are like to increase the number, and give us an encouraging hope that they will at length be set as olive plants around the LORD'S table, as well as your's. I persuade myself it is so else∣where, and think I may pronounce it with some confidence, that the families of GOD'S children are generally speaking the nurse∣ries of his church. Solomon, no doubt, had observed, that a good education had generally been successful, or we could by no means account for the remark in the text; and a very accurate writer of our own age and nation has carried it so far as to say, "That of all the men we meet with, nine parts in the ten are what they are, good or bad, useful or not, according to their education."</P>
<P>I hope you are by this time convinced, that, humanly speaking, there is great pro∣bability that religious education may be the effectual means of promoting serious piety in the rising age; which was the second ar∣gument by which I was to recommend it: An argument, which may be greatly strengthened, by observing,</P>
<P N="3">III. That the success, which we may so reasonably expect, is a matter of very high importance.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="025410_0046_0FCCE69D60B2F0F0"/>It is of evident importance, to the hon∣our of GOD, and the support of religion— to the present and future happiness of our children—and to your own comfort both in life and death. Weighty and comprehen∣sive thoughts! which I shall briefly touch, and to which I beg you will renew your at∣tention.</P>
<P N="1">1. The honour of GOD, and interest of a Redeemer, is greatly concerned in the behaviour of your children; and conse∣quently in your care of their education, which is like to have so great an influence upon it.</P>
<P>We live in a dying world. Our fathers, where are they? Sleeping in the dust, as we must shortly be. We are sure, that in a little, a very little while, these places must know us no more: And when we are mouldering in the house of silence, who must fill our places in the house of GOD? Who must rise up in our stead for the sup∣port of religion among those who succeed us? From whom can it be expected, but from our children? Yet how can we expect it from these, in the neglect of a method, which comes recommended by so many ad∣vantageous circumstances? "Yes," you will perhaps be ready to say, "GOD will
<PB N="48" REF="025410_0048_0FCCE6A062354F18"/>
take care of his own cause, and almighty grace will do what we have not attempted, because we knew that we could not accom∣plish it." Almighty grace can indeed do it; and almighty power can of these stones, on which we tread, raise up children to Abraham. But shew me your warrant from the word of GOD for expecting it, ei∣ther in the one case, or in the other. You will possibly answer, "He has promised to be ever with his church, and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; but that one generation shall arise and declare his might<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> works unto another, and that the kingdom of his son shall continue as long as the sun and moon endure." Blessed be his name for these encouraging promises, which shall, no doubt, be accomplished. But where has he engaged, that this king∣dom shall always continue among us? Such passages as these will no more prove, that the gospel shall never be removed from Great-Britain, than they would once have proved, that it should never be taken away from Pergamos or Thyatira, or any other of the Asian churches, which have so many ages ago been given up to desolation.</P>
<P>Now let me intreat you for a few mo∣ments, to dwell upon that thought; what if the gospel should be lost from among your descendants! what if in the age of
<PB N="49" REF="025410_0047_0FCCE69EF7191A40"/>
these little ones, or the next who shall suc∣ceed to their's, the house of the LORD should be forsaken, and his table abandon∣ed? What if the ministry should be grown into disuse, or the servants of CHRIST in it should have nothing to do, but to bear a fruitless testimony against an unbelieving generation, till (when their hearts are broken with so sad an office) the gospel here die with them, and religion be buried in their graves? Is it a thought easily to be supported by a true Israelite, that the ark of the LORD should thus be lost, and GOD should write upon us Ichabod, the sad me∣morials of a departed glory!</P>
<P>It would surely be peculiarly melancholy, that religion should die in the hands of those who were the children of the king∣dom. And were not your's so? In this re∣spect, my friends, permit me to say, that I am a witness among some of you. When you have offered your children to baptism, you have delivered them into my hands, with an express declaration of your sincere desire, that they might be devoted to GOD; and have received them again with a solemn charge and promise to bring them up for him, if their lives should be continued. And as for those of you, who do not prac∣tise this institution, I doubt not, but many of you are equally faithful in dedicating
<PB N="50" REF="025410_0049_0FCCE6A2DFD8CD30"/>
your infant offspring to GOD. Is it not then reasonable to expect from both, that they should be brought up as a seed to serve him? And from whom may we hope it, if not from you? If you have experienced the power of divine grace upon your own souls, and have ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed that the LORD is gracious, methinks it should awaken a holy zeal to spread the sweet savour of his name and word wherever you come: You should la∣bour to the utmost for the advancement of his gospel among all your acquaintance, and even among strangers; how much more in your own families, among those whom you have from him, among those whom you have so solemnly given back to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The character of your children, and consequently your care in their education, is of the most evident importance, to their present and future happiness.</P>
<P>I need not employ a great deal of time in proving the truth of the assertion. As christians you must undoubtedly own, that <HI>godliness is profitable to all things, having the promise of the life which now is,</HI> as well as of <HI>that which is to come.</HI> If your chil∣dren, through the divine blessing on your holy care, become truly religious, they
<PB N="51" REF="025410_0050_0FCCE6A448451C78"/>
will not only be preserved from those follies and crimes, which stain the honour, and ruin the substance of families, but they will secure a fair reputation; they will take the most probable method to make life truly comfortable; they will be entitled to the paternal care and blessing of GOD; and to crown all will be heirs of eternal glory with him; And what could your most prudent, faithful, tender love wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h for them as a greater, or indeed a comparable good? On the other hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they prove vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and profane (which in so degenerate an age it is very probable they may, if they have no re∣ligious principle to secure them) what can you expect but their infamy and misery in this world, and their eternal destruction in the next?</P>
<P>One would imagine, that such consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦rations as these should very deeply impress the heart of a parent; and if they were alone, should be sufficient to gain the cause. You, who have so tender a regard to all their temporal concerns; you, who rise early and sit up late, that you may ad∣vance their fortunes, that you may furnish them with those dubious and uncertain pos∣sessions, which may be blessings or curses, as they are improved or abused? can you bear to think, that they may be for ever poor and miserable? Surely, it should cut
<PB N="52" REF="025410_0051_0FCCE6A59F3AFEC0"/>
you to the heart to look on a child and re∣flect, "here is an heir of eternal misery: Alas! what am I doing for him? Prepar∣ing an estate? Contriving for his present convenience or grandeur?" Vain, wretch∣ed, preposterous care! which, to use a ve∣ry plain simile, is but like employing your∣selves in trimming and adorning its clothes, while the child itself were fallen into the fire, and would be in danger of being des∣troyed, if not immediately plucked out. Hasten to do it with an earnestness answer∣able to the extremity of the case, and so much the rather, as the danger is in part owing to you.</P>
<P>I will not say, how far your personal mis∣takes in conduct may have been a snare and a temptation, to your children; nor can I pretend to determine it. But I am confi∣dent of this, that they have derived from you a corrupt and degenerate nature. Through your veins the original infection, which tainted the first authors of our race, has flowed down to them. And is not this an affecting thought? and ought it not to quicken you to attempt their relief?</P>
<P>Dr. Tillotson sets this in a very moving light: "When a man has by treason taint∣ed his blood and forfeited his estate, with what grief and regret does he look on his children, and think of the injury he has
<PB N="53" REF="025410_0052_0FCCE6A8D8B0D0E8"/>
done to them by his fault: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd how solici∣tous is he before he dies to petition the king for favour to his children! How earnestly does he charge his friends to be careful of them, and kind to them!" We are those traitors. Our children have derived from us a tainted blood, a forfeited Inheritance. How tenderly should we pity them! How solicitously should we exert ourselves to prevent their ruin! Mr. Flavel expresses the thought still more pathetically. "Should I bring the plague into my fami∣ly, and live to see all my poor children lie dying by the walls of my house; if I had not the heart of a tyger, such a sight would melt my very soul." And surely, I may add, were there a sovereign antidote at hand, perhaps an antidote I had myself us∣ed, should I not direct them to it, and urge them to try it, I should be still more savage and criminal. The application <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s easy: The LORD deeply impress it on your souls, that your dear children may not die eternally of the malignant plague they have taken from you!</P>
<P>This is one consideration, which should certainly add a great deal of weight to the argument I am now upon. I will conclude the head with the mention of another: I mean, the peculiar advantages which you their parents have for addressing yourselves
<PB N="54" REF="025410_0053_0FCCE6AA21C6B698"/>
to them. You, who have known them from their infancy, are best acquainted with their temper, and manner of think∣ing; you, who are daily with them, may watch the most tender moments, the most favourable opportunities of pleading with them; your melting affection for them, will suggest the most endearing sentiments and words on such occasions: Their obli∣gations to you, and love for you, will pro∣bably dispose them to attend with the great∣er pleasure to what you may say; or your authority over them, your power of correc∣tion, and a sense of their dependance upon you in life, may prevent much of that op∣position and contempt, which from per∣verse tempers, others might expect, espe∣cially if they were not supported by your concurrence, in their attempts to instruct and reform your children.</P>
<P>On the whole then, since your obliga∣tions and your encouragements to attempt the work are so peculiar, I may reasonably hope you will allow its due weight to this second consideration, that the character and conduct of your children, and con∣sequently your care in their education, is of the highest importance to their pre∣sent and future happiness. I add, once more,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="55" REF="025410_0054_0FCCE6ABC2A769B0"/>3. It is of great moment to your own comfort, both in life and death.</P>
<P>Solomon often repeats the substance of that re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>wise son maketh a glad fa∣ther, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lish son is an heaviness to his mother.</HI> And the justice of it in both its branches is very apparent. Let me engage you seriously to reflect upon it, as a most awakening inducement, to the discharge of the important duty I am recommending.</P>
<P>If you have reason to hope that your la∣bours are not in vain, but that your chil∣dren are become truly religious; it must greatly increase your satisfaction in them, that they are dear to you, not only in the bands of the flesh, but in those of the LORD. You will not only be secure of their dutiful and grateful behaviour to you, but will have the pleasure of seeing them grow up in their different stations, to pro∣spects of usefulness in the church, and in the world. Should Providence spare you to the advance of age, they will be a com∣fort and honour to your declining years. You will, as it were, enjoy a second youth in their vigour and usefulness; nay, a sense of their piety and goodness will un∣doubtedly be a reviving cordial to you in your dying moments. A delightful thought will it indeed be! "I am going to
<PB N="56" REF="025410_0055_0FCCE6ADDE9C70E8"/>
take my leave of the world, and my scene of service is over; but I leave those behind me, who will appear for GOD in my stead, and act perhaps, with greater fidelity and zeal, for the support of religion in a de∣generate age. I leave my dear children de∣stitute indeed of my counsel and help, per∣haps in no ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ant affluence of worldly enjoyments; but I leave them under the guardian care of my Father and their Fa∣ther, of my GOD and their GOD. I must soon be separated from them, and the dis∣tance between us must soon be as great, as between earth and heaven: But as I leave them under the best guidance in the wilder∣ness, so I have a joyful persuasion they will soon follow me into the celestial Canaan. Yet a little while, and I, and my dear off∣spring shall appear together before the throne of GOD; and I shall stand forth with transport, and say, Behold, here am I, and the children which my GOD has graciously given me. Then will the bles∣sedness on which I now enter, be multiplied upon me, by the sight of every child that has a share in it. "Now, LORD, sufferest thou thy servant to depart in peace, since thou hast directed, not only mine eyes, but theirs, to thy salvation."</P>
<P>But if you see these dear little ones, grow up for the destroyer; if you see those,
<PB N="57" REF="025410_0056_0FCCE6AEA41E8178"/>
whose infant days have given you so many tender pleasures, and so many fond hopes, deviating from the paths of duty and hap∣piness, how deeply will it pierce you! You now look upon them w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h a soft compla∣cency, and say, "These are they, who shall comfort us under our labours and our sorrows." But alas! my friends, if this be the case, "These are they, who will increase your labours, and aggravate your sorrows; that will hasten upon you the in∣firmities of age, or crush you the faster un∣der the weight of them, until they have brought down your hoary hairs, with an∣guish, to the grave." Little do they or you think how much agony and distress you may endure, from what you will see, and what you will fear concerning them. How many slighted admonitions, how ma∣ny deluded hopes, how many anxious days, how many restless nights, will con∣cur, to make the evening of life gloomy! And at length, when GOD gives you a dis∣mission from a world, which the folly and wickedness of your children has so long imbittered, how painful will the separation be; when you have the prospect of seeing them but once more, and that at the tribu∣nal of GOD, where the best you can expect (in their present circumstance) is to rise up in judgment against them, and to bear an
<PB N="58" REF="025410_0057_0FCCE6B04E1D57A0"/>
awful testimony, which shall draw down upon them aggravated damnation!</P>
<P>And let me plainly tell you, that if in these last moments, conscience should also accuse you of the neglect of duty, and testi∣fy that your own sorrow, and your chil∣dren's ruin, is in part chargeable upon that, it will be a dreadful ingredient in this bitter cup, and may greatly darken, if not entirely suppress those hopes with regard to yourselves, which alone could support you in this mournful scene. I am fully per∣suaded, that if you knew the weight with which these things will sit upon your mind, in the immediate views of the eternal world, you would not suffer every trifling difficul∣ty, or little care, to deter you from the dis∣charge of those duties, which are so neces∣sary to prevent these galling reflections.</P>
<P>To conclude: Let me intreat you seri∣ously to weigh the united force of those ar∣guments, which I have now been urging to excite your diligence in this momentuous care of training up your children in the way in which they should go. Consider how pleasant the attempt is: Consider how fair a probability there is that it may prosper, as it is in itself a very rational method, as it is a method GOD has appointed, and a me∣thod which he has crowned with singular success: Consider how important that suc∣cess
<PB N="59" REF="025410_0058_0FCCE6B1A6E820F8"/>
is, to the honour of GOD, and interest of religion, to the temporal and eternall h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦piness of your children; and finally, your own comfort, both in life and death.</P>
<P>On the whole, I well know, and I am persuaded, Sirs, that you yourselves are convinced, that whatsoever can be opposed to such considerations as these, when laid in an impartial balance, it is altogether lighter than vanity. I do therefore serious∣ly appeal to those convictions of your con∣sciences, as in the sight of GOD: And if from this time at least, the education of children among you be neglected, or re∣garded only as a light care, GOD is witness, and you yourselves are witnesses, that it is not for want of bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plainly instructed in your duty, or seriously urged to the per∣formance of it.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOSE of you, who have made any observation on human life, must certainly know, that if we desire to be agreeable and useful in it, we must rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not only the quality, but the manner of our actions; and that while we are in the pursuit of any important end, we must not only attend to those actions which do im∣mediately refer to it, but must watch over the whole of our conduct; that we may preserve a consistency in the several parts of it. Otherwise we shall spoil the beauty and acceptance of many an honest, and, perhaps in the main, prudent attempt; or
<PB N="61" REF="025410_0060_0FCCE6B6114A6828"/>
by a train of unthought of consequences, shall demolish with the one hand, what we are labouring to build up with the other.</P>
<P>This is a remark which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall have frequent occasion to recollect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is of peculiar importance in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of edu∣cation. It is therefore ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/> that hav∣ing before described the way in which chil∣dren are to be trained up, and urged you to a diligent application to the duty, I now proceed,</P>
<P>Thirdly, To offer some advice for your assistance in this attempt, of leading chil∣dren into, and conducting them in this way.</P>
<P>These will relate—partly to the manner in which the attempt is to be made—and partly to the precautions necessary for ren∣dering it effectual: Which are, as you see, matters of distinct consideration, though comprehended under the general head of directions.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the manner in which the attempt is to be made.</P>
<P>And here it is evident, it should be done plainly, seriously, tenderly and pa∣tiently.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="025410_0061_0FCCE6B79F126C08"/>1. Children are to be instructed plainly: In the plainest things, and by the plain∣est words.</P>
<P>They are to be taught the plainest things in religion in the first place. And it is a pleasing reflection on this occasion, that according to the abundant goodness and condescension of the great GOD, those things which are the most necessary are the plainest. Just as in the world of nature, those kinds of food, which are most whole∣some and nourishing, are also the most common. We should shew our grateful sense of the divine goodness in this particu∣lar, by our care to imitate it; and should see to it, that when the necessities of our children require bread, we do not give them a stone, or chaff; as we should do, if we were to distract their feeble minds with a variety of human schemes, and doubtful disputations. The more abstruse and mysterious truths of the gospel are gra∣dually to be unfolded, as they are exhibited in the oracles of GOD, and to be taught in the language of the spirit; according to the excellent advice of the great Dr. Owen, "making scripture phraseology our rule and pattern in the declaration of spiritual things. But we must not begin here. We must feed them with milk while they
<PB N="63" REF="025410_0062_0FCCE6B92237D788"/>
are babes, and reserve the strong meat for a maturer age. Take the most obvious and vital truths of christianity. Tell them, that they are creatures, and sinful crea∣tures; that by sin they have displeased a holy GOD; and that they must be pardon∣ed, and sanctified, and accepted in CHRIST, or must perish for ever. Shew them the difference between sin and holiness; be∣tween a state of nature and of grace. Shew them, that they are hastening on to death and judgment, and so must enter on heaven or hell, and dwell for ever in the one or the other. Such kind of lessons will pro∣bably turn to the best account, both to them and you. I know it is a very easy thing to inflame the warm, ignorant minds of children with an eager zeal for distin∣guishing forms, or distinguishing phrases; and to make them violent in the interest of a party, before they know any thing of common christianity. But if we thus sow the wind, we shall probably reap the whirl∣wind; venting ourselves, and transfusing into them, a wrath of man, which never works, but often greatly obstructs the righteousness of GOD. Blessed be GOD, this is not the fault of you, my friends, of this congregation. I would mention it with great thankfulness, as both your happiness and mine, that so far as I can judge, it is
<PB N="64" REF="025410_0063_0FCD26C495B5C128"/>
the sincere milk of the word that you de∣sire. Let it be your care to draw it out for the nourishment of your children's souls, as their understandings and capacities will permit them to take it in.</P>
<P>And while you are teaching them the plainest things, endeavour to do it in the plainest words. It is the gracious method which GOD uses with us, who speaks to us of heavenly things in language, not fully expressive of the sublimity and grandeur of the subject, but rather suited to our feeble apprehensions. Thus our LORD taught his disciples, as they were able to bear it; and used easy and familiar similitudes, ta∣ken from the most obvious occurrences in life, to illustrate matters of the highest im∣portance. A most instructive example! Such condescension should we use, in training up those committed to our care, and should examine whether we take their understandings along with us, as we go on: Otherwise we are speaking in an un∣known tongue; and as the Apostle expres∣ses it, are barbarians unto them, be our language ever so grateful, elegant or pathe∣tic.</P>
<P>Give me leave to add, for the conclusion of this head, that though it is to be taken for granted, that children in their earliest infancy are to be engaged to what is good,
<PB N="65" REF="025410_0064_0FCD26C615F402A8"/>
and to be restrained from evil, chiefly by a view to rewards and punishments, more immediate or remote, or by some natural workings of a benevolent affection, which are by all means to be cherished and culti∣vated; yet, as they may grow up to greater ripeness of understanding, something far∣ther is to be attempted. It must then be our care, to set before them in the strongest light, the natural beauties of holiness, and deformities of sin; and likewise to propose, in the easiest and most familiar way, the evidences of the truth of christianity, that they may be fortified against those tempta∣tions to infidelity, with which the present age does so unhappily abound. The exter∣nal evidences of it are by no means to be slighted, such as the credibility of the gos∣pel history, the accomplishment of prophe∣cies, the unity of design carried on by so many different persons in distant ages and countries, its amazing and even miracu∣lous propagations in the world; all which, with many other considerations to the same purpose, are very judiciously handled in a variety of excellent writings of our own age: of which I know not any more suited to your use, than Mr. Bennet's discourses on the inspiration of scripture, which I therefore recommend to your attentive pe∣rusal; and with them Dr. <HI>Watts'</HI> sermons
<PB N="66" REF="025410_0065_0FCD26C877B513F0"/>
on the inward witness to the truth of chris∣tianity, from its efficacious tendency to promote holiness: This appears to me the noblest evidence of all, and will to those who have actually experienced it, be an an∣chor of the soul both sure and stead fast.</P>
<P N="2">2. Children should be instructed in a ve∣ry serious manner.</P>
<P>There is an unhappy proneness in our degenerate natures to trifle with the things of GOD; and the giddiness of childhood is peculiarly subject to it. Great care should therefore be taken, that we do not encour∣age such an humour, nor teach them by our levity or indolence in the manner of our instruction, to take the awful name of GOD in vain, while they are speaking of him, or to him. For this purpose we must la∣bour with our own hearts, to work them to a deep and serious sense of the truth and importance of what we say: This will give us an unaffected solemnity in speaking, which will probably command the atten∣tion, and impress the hearts of our chil∣dren. Endeavour to preserve on your own spirit, an habitual awe of the great and blessed GOD, the LORD of heaven and earth: that when you speak of him to those little creatures, they may evidently see the
<PB N="67" REF="025410_0066_0FCD26C9CE3AC2E0"/>
indications of the humblest veneration and reverence, and so may learn to fear him from their youth. When you speak of CHRIST, let your souls be bowing to him as the son of GOD, through whom alone you and your's can obtain pardon and life; and let them be overflowing with love to him, for his unutterable and inconceivable grace. And when you remind them of death, judgment and eternity, consider yourselves and them as dying creatures: Think in how few months, or weeks, or days, your lips may be silent in the dust, or they may be for ever removed beyond the reach of your instructions; and plead with them in as earnest and importunate a man∣ner, as if the salvation of their immortal souls depended on the effect of the present address. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. Children should be instructed in a ve∣ry tender and affectionate manner.</P>
<P>We should take care to let them see, that we do not desire to terrify and amaze them, to lead them into unnecessary severi∣ties, or to deprive them of any innocent pleasures; that what we say is not dictated by an ostentation of our wisdom and autho∣rity; but that it all proceeds from a hearty love to them, and an earnest desire of their
<PB N="68" REF="025410_0067_0FCD26CB4BF412E8"/>
happiness. Study therefore to address them in the most endearing language, as well as with the softest and sweetest ar∣guments. Endeavour, according to the practice of Solomon, to find out acceptable words. And if tears should arise while you are speaking do not suppress them. There is a language in them, which may perhaps affect beyond words. A weeping parent is both an awful and a melting sight.</P>
<P>Endeavour therefore to look upon your children in such a view, as may be most likely to awaken these tender sentiments. Consider them as creatures, whom you (as instruments) have brought into being, tainted with innate corruption, surrounded with snares, and on the whole, in such ap∣parent danger, that if not snatched as brands out of the burning, they must per∣ish for ever. And that your hearts may be further mollified, and that you may be formed to the most gentle and moving man∣ner of address, let me intreat you to study the scripture in this view, and to observe the condescending and endearing forms in which the blessed GOD speaks to us there. Observe them for yourselves, and point them out to your children. Tell them, how kindly he has demanded, how graci∣ously he has encouraged their services; while he says, <HI>Remember now thy Creator in
<PB N="69" REF="025410_0068_0FCD26CEAA5CC9A0"/>
the days of thy youth;</HI> and elsewhere, <HI>I love them that love me, and those that seek me ear∣ly shall find me.</HI> Tell them that the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath invited them to come to him; for he has said, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest: Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out: And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.</HI> Such scriptures as these should be often re∣peated to them, and should be early incul∣cated on their memory, with an attempt, as far as possible, to let them into the spirit and force of them.</P>
<P>Nor will it be improper sometimes to set before them, how much you have done, how much you are ready to do for them; how many anxious thoughts you entertain, how many servent prayers you offer on their account. Thus Lemuel's mother ad∣dressed him, <HI>What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</HI> As if she had said, <Q>My dear child, for whom I have borne so much, for whom I have prayed so earnestly; in what words shall I address thee, to ex∣press what my heart feels on thy ac∣count? How shall I speak my affectionate overflowing concern for thy happiness both for time and eternity?</Q> So Solo∣mon pleads, <HI>My son, if thine heart be wise,
<PB N="70" REF="025410_0069_0FCD26D0D5F2DDB0"/>
my heart shall rejoice, even mine:</HI> As if he should say, "Think how much is compre∣hended in that argument, that a parent's happiness is in a great measure to be deter∣mined by thy character and conduct." And the apostle Paul lays open his heart to the Gallatians in those prophetic words, <HI>My lit∣tle children of whom I travail in birth again, until</HI> CHRIST <HI>be formed in you.</HI> Yet these were comparatively, strangers to him. And should not you, my friends, feel, should not you express an equal tenderness for those who are indeed parts of your∣selves? But further,</P>
<P N="4">4. Children should be instructed pa∣tiently.</P>
<P>You know, when the husbandman has committed the seed to the ground, he pa∣tiently expects the fruits of his labours. So must ministers do, when instructing their people: So must parents do, when instruc∣ting their children. You must not imagine, my friends, that a plentiful harvest will spring up in a day. The growth of nature is slow, and by insensible degrees: Nor are you to wonder, if advances in knowledge and grace be still flower. Be upon your guard therefore against fretfulness and im∣patience. Your children will forget what
<PB N="71" REF="025410_0070_0FCD26D2124EB4E0"/>
you have once taught them; repeat it a se∣cond time; and if they forget it the second time, repeat it the third. It is thus the great GOD deals with you; and you have daily reason to rejoice that he does. He knows the frailty and weakness of your minds, and therefore acts by a rule, which seems to be laid down with a peculiar re∣gard to the very point I am urging: <HI>Whom shall he teach knowledge, and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept, and line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a little:</HI> As if he should have said, "GOD has treated you like little children, who must have the same short easy lesson repeated again and again." And is it not indeed thus with regard to you? Does not the pa∣tience and condescension of your heavenly Father send to you his ministers, Sabbath after Sabbath, frequently inculcating the same things, that what you have forgot may be brought to mind again? Thus should you do by those committed to your care.</P>
<P>Be teaching them every Sabbath: That is remarkably a good day for the purpose. Then you have leisure for it; then you have particular advantage to pursue the
<PB N="72" REF="025410_0071_0FCD26D39256CF18"/>
work; then you are furnished with some new matter by what you have heard in public; and I would hope your spirits are then quickened by it, so that you can speak out of the abundance of your heart; and you may, by discoursing with them on what has been addressed to you, receive the impression on your own souls.</P>
<P>I add, be teaching them every day, by occasional discourses, when you have not an opportunity of doing it by stated addres∣ses. Drop a word for GOD every day, and often in a day. You will probably find your account in it, and your children theirs. A sudden glance of thought to∣wards GOD in the midst of the world, is often a great refreshment to the christian; and a sudden turn to something serious and spiritual in conversation, is frequently very edifying to others. It strikes the memory and the heart, and is, perhaps, as a nail fixed in a sure place, when many a solemn admonition, and many an elaborate sermon is lost. It is with pleasure that I frequently hear good christians speaking of such occa∣sional hints, which have been dropped by saints of the former generation: Those transient passages, which the pious parents might forget in a few moments, their chil∣dren have distinctly remembered for many future years, and repeated for their own
<PB N="73" REF="025410_0072_0FCD26D51CDAD358"/>
edification, and I might add for mine. Let this therefore be an encouragement to you; and in this respect, in the morning sow this precious seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand, since you know not whe∣ther shall prosper, or whether both shall be alike good.</P>
<P>Once more, let me intreat you to repeat your pious instructions and admonitions, even though your children should grow up to years of maturity, without appear∣ing to profit by them. Say not, that you can teach them no more than they already know; or, that you can try no new me∣thod which you have not already attempt∣ed. You see, that in our assemblies, GOD often brings back souls to himself by set∣ting home on the conscience truths, which, with regard to the speculative part of them, they know as well as their teachers; and adds a divine efficacy to those institutions, which, for a long succession of years, they had attended in vain. Be not therefore weary in well-doing; but let patience, in this instance, have its perfect work.</P>
<P>Thus let your children be instructed plainly, seriously, tenderly, and patiently; I wave some other particulars, which I might have added to these, concerning the manner of instructing them, because I ap∣prehend they will more properly fall under
<PB N="74" REF="025410_0073_0FCD26D6A278EF98"/>
the second branch of these directions: Where I am further to advise you,</P>
<P N="2">II. As to the precautions you must use, if you desire that these attempts in the reli∣gious education of your children may be attended with success.</P>
<P>Here I would particularly advise, that a prudent care be taken to keep up your au∣thority over them, and at the same time to engage their affections to you; that you be solicitous to keep them out of the way of temptation; that you confirm your admo∣nitions by a suitable example; that you cheerfully accept of proper assistances in this important attempt; and that you humbly and constantly look up to GOD for his blessing on all.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we desire to succeed in our at∣tempts for the religious education of our children, we must take care to keep up our authority over them.</P>
<P>To this purpose, we must avoid, not on∣ly what is grossly vicious and criminal (which will more properly be mentioned under a following head) but also those lit∣tle levities and follies which might make us appear contemptible to them. What∣ever
<PB N="75" REF="025410_0074_0FCD26D80CD09BF0"/>
liberties we may take with those who are our equals in age and station, a more exact decorum is to be preserved before our children. Thus we are to reverence them, if we desire they should reverence us; for, as Dr. Tillotson very justly observes, "There is a certain freedom of conversa∣tion, which is only proper among equals in age and quality, which if we use before our superiors, we seem to despise them; and if we do it before our inferiors, we teach them to despise us."</P>
<P>I will not insist on this hint, which your own prudence must accommodate to parti∣cular circumstances; but shall here intro∣duce the mention of correction, which in some cases may be absolutely necessary to the support of parental authority, especial∣ly where admonitions and counsels are slighted.</P>
<P>You know, that the scriptures expressly require it on proper occasions; and Solo∣mon, in particular, enlarges on the head. and suggests some important thoughts with regard to it. Foolishness (says he) is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. Nay, he speaks of it as a matter in which life is concerned, even the life of the soul: Withhold not correction from a child; for if thou beat him with the rod, he shall not
<PB N="76" REF="025410_0075_0FCD26DBB55E00A8"/>
die: Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. And is it kindness, or cruelty, in a parent, to spare the flesh to the hazard of the soul? Parents are therefore exhorted to an early care in this respect, lest vicious habits growing inveterate should render the at∣tempt vain or hurtful; and they are cauti∣oned against that foolish tenderness, which would lead them to regard the tears of a child, rather than his truest and highest in∣terest. <HI>Correct thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying: He that spareth the rod, hateth his son; but he that loveth him, chasteneth him betimes.</HI> Nor can we imagine a more lively commen∣tary on the words than the melancholy sto∣ry of Eli, who, though he was a very emi∣nent saint in a degenerate age, yet erred here, and by a fatal indulgence brought ruin, as well as infamy, on himself and his family. He reproved the abominable wickedness of his sons; but did not make use of those severe methods, which in such a case the authority of a parent might have warranted, and the office of a judge did undoubtedly require. Observe the sen∣tence which GOD pronounced against him for it, and which he executed upon him in a very awful manner. The LORD said un∣to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Is∣rael,
<PB N="77" REF="025410_0076_0FCD26DD4C546EE0"/>
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle: In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house; when I begin, I will also make an end. For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not: And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. Take heed, I entreat you, as you love your chil∣dren, as you love yourselves, that it may not be said of you, that your's have made themselves vile, and you have neglected to restrain them. Let mothers, in particular take heed, that they do not, as it were, smother their children in their embraces; as a French author smartly expresses it. And let me remind you all particularly to be cautious, that the arms of one parent, be not a refuge to the children from the re∣sentment of the other. Both should appear to act in concert, or the authority of the one will be despised, and probably the in∣dulgence of the other abused, and the mu∣tual affection of both endangered.</P>
<P>I cannot say, that I enlarge on this sub∣ject with pleasure; but how could I have answered for the omission of what is so copi∣ously
<PB N="78" REF="025410_0077_0FCCE2F34A826248"/>
and so pathetically inculcated in the sacred writings? It is indeed probable, that the rugged and servile temper of the generality of the Jewish nation, migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ren∣der a severe discipline peculiarly necessary for their children; yet I fear, there are few of our families, where every thing of this kind can safely be neglected. But after all, I would by no means drive matters to ex∣tremities; and therefore cannot persuade myself to dismiss the head without a caution or two. Take heed, that your corrections be not too frequent, or too severe—and that they be not given in an unbecoming manner.</P>
<P>If your corrections be too frequent, it will probably spoil much of the success. Your children, like iron, will harden un∣der repeated strokes; and that ingenious shame will be gradually worn off, which adds the greatest sting to what they suffer from a parent's hand. And there will be this farther inconvenience attending it, that there will not be a due difference made, between great and small faults. The laws of Draco the Athenian, were justly rejected, because they punished all crimes alike, and made the stealing of an apple capital, as well as the murder of a ci∣tizen. You, on the contrary, should let your children see, that you know how to
<PB N="79" REF="025410_0078_0FCD26E056BD80B0"/>
distinguish between indiscretion and wick∣edness; and should yourselves appear most displeased, where you have reason to be∣lieve GOD is so.</P>
<P>Nor should your corrections at any time be too severe. It is prettily said by Dr. Tillotson on this occasion, "That whips are not the cords of a man:" They should be used in a family, only (as the sword in the republic) as the last remedy when all others have been tried in vain; and then should be so used, as that we may appear to imitate the compassion of our heavenly Fa∣ther, who doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</P>
<P>Which leads me to add, that we should be greatly cautious, that correction be not inflicted in an unbecoming manner: and it always is so, when it is given in a passion. A parent's correcting his child should be regarded as an act of domestic justice, which therefore should be administered with a due solemnity and decorum; and to behave otherwise on the occasion, is almost as great an indecency, as for a judge to pass sentence in a rage. It is injurious to our∣selves, as it tends to spoil our own temper; for peevishness and passion will grow upon us, by being indulged towards those who dare not oppose them: And it is on many accounts injurious to our children. Solo∣mon
<PB N="80" REF="025410_0079_0FCD26E2DFD08418"/>
intimates, that correction and instruc∣tion should be joined, when he says, <HI>The rod and reproof give wisdom.</HI> But what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m is there for the still voice of wisdom to be heard in a storm of fury? If your chil∣dren see, that you act calmly and mildly; if they read parental tenderness in your heart, through an awful frown on your brow; if they perceive that correction is your strange work, a violence which you offer to yourselves from a principle of duty to GOD and affection to them; they must be obdurate indeed, if they do not receive it with reverence and love; for this is both a venerable and an amiable character. But if once they imagine, that you chastise them merely to vent your passion, and gra∣tify your resentment, they will secretly des∣pise, and perhaps hate you for it: In that instance at least, they will look upon you as their enemies, and may, by a continued course of such severities, contract such an aversion, not only to you, but to all that you recommend to them. Thus you may lose your authority and your influence, by the very method you take to support it, and may turn a wholesome, though bitter medicine, into poison. But I hope and trust, that your humanity and your pru∣dence will concur to prevent so fatal an abuse.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="81" REF="025410_0080_0FCD26E40AAC1DE0"/>2. If you desire success in your attempts for the education of your children, you must be careful to secure their affection to you.</P>
<P>Our LORD observes, that if any man love him, he will keep his word; and the assertion is applicable to the present case: The more your children love you, the more will they regard your i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ructions and admonitions. GOD has indeed made it their duty to love you, and the most in∣dispensible laws of gratitude require it: yet since so many children are evidently wanting in filial affection, it is certain that all this may not secure it in your's, unless you add a tender obliging behaviour to all the other benefits you have conferred upon them. I observed under a former head, that you should address them in an affec∣tionate manner when discoursing on reli∣gious subjects; but now I add, that you should carry the temper through life, and be daily endeavouring to render yourselves amiable to them. The Apostle cautions parents that they should not provoke their children to wrath, if they would bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD: On the contrary, you should put on the kindest looks, you should use the most endearing and condescending lan∣guage;
<PB N="82" REF="025410_0081_0FCCE2F4980D93D8"/>
you should overlook many little failings, and express a high complacency in what is really regular and laudable in their behaviour. And though you must sometimes over rule their desires, when im∣patiently eager, yet far from delighting ge∣nerally to cross them, you should rather study their inclinations, that you may sur∣prize them with unexpected favours. Thus will they learn quietly to refer them∣selves to your care, and will more easily submit to mortification and denial, when it is not made necessary by clamourous and impetuous demands. On the whole, you should endeavour to behave so, as that your children may love your company, and of choice be much in it; which will preserve them from innumerable snares, and may furnish you with many opportuni∣ties of forming their temper and behaviour by imperceptible degrees, to what may be decent, amiable and excellent.</P>
<P>If you manage these things with pru∣dence, you need not fear, that such con∣descensions, as I have now recommended, will impair your authority; far from that, they will rather establish it. The superiori∣ty of your parental character may be main∣tained in the midst of these indulgences; and when it is thus attempered, it is most likely to produce that mixture of reverence
<PB N="83" REF="025410_0082_0FCD26E587065318"/>
and love, by which the obedience of a child is to be distinguished from that of a slave.</P>
<P N="3">3. You must be solicitous to keep your children out of the way of temptation, if you would see the success of your care in their education.</P>
<P>If you are not on your guard here, you will probably throw down what you have built, and build up that which you have been endeavouring to destroy. An early care must be taken to keep them from the occasions, and the very appearances of evil. We would not venture their infant steps on the brink of a precipice on which grown persons, who know how to adjust the poise of their bodies, may walk with∣out extreme danger. More hazardous might it be, to allow them to trifle with temptations, and boldly to venture to the utmost limits of that which is lawful. An early tenderness of conscience may be a great preservative; and the excess of strict∣ness (though no excess be desirable,) may prove much safer than an excess of liberty.</P>
<P>Bad company is undoubtedly one of the most formidable and pernicious entangle∣ments. By forming friendships with per∣sons of a vicious character, many a hopeful youth has learnt their ways, and found a
<PB N="84" REF="025410_0083_0FCD26E9FA6FB780"/>
fatal snare to his soul. You should be very watchful to prevent their contracting such dangerous friendships; and where you dis∣cover any thing of that kind, should en∣deavour, by all gentle and endearing me∣thods, to draw them off from them; but if they still persist, you must resolve to cut the knot you cannot untie, and let your children know, they must either renounce their associates, or their parents. One re∣solute step of this kind might have prevent∣ed the ruin of multitudes, who have fallen a sacrifice to the importunities of wicked companions, and the weak indulgence of imprudent parents, who have contented themselves with blaming, what they ought strenuously to have redressed.</P>
<P>All bad company is, in this respect, for∣midable; but that is most evidently so, which is to be found at home. Great care ought therefore to be taken, that you ad∣mit none into your families, who may de∣bauch the tender minds of your children, by pernicious opinions, or by vicious prac∣tices. This is a caution which should be particularly remembered, in the case of servants. Take heed you do not bring in∣to your families such as may diffuse infec∣tion through the souls of your dear off∣spring. It is a thousand times better to put up with some inconveniences and disadvan∣tages,
<PB N="85" REF="025410_0084_0FCD26EB886CE7F8"/>
when you have reason to believe a servant fears GOD, and will from a princi∣ple of conscience be faithful in watching over your children, and in seconding your religious care in their education; than to prefer such, as while they are, perhaps, managing your temporal affairs something better, may pervert your children to the service of the devil. I fear, some parents little think, how much secret mischief these base creatures are doing. And it is very possible, that if some of you recollect what you may have observed among the com∣panions of your childhood, you may find instances of this nature, which riper years have since given you opportunity to dis∣cover. See to it therefore, that you be di∣ligently on your guard here.</P>
<P>Again: If you send your children to places of education, be greatly cautious in your choice of them. Dearly will you purchase the greatest advantages for learn∣ing, at the expense of those of a religious nature. And I will turn out of my way to add, that school-masters and tutors will have a dreadful account to give, if they are not faithfully and tenderly solicitous for the souls of those committed to their care. The LORD pardon our many defects here, and quicken us to greater diligence and zeal!—But to return:</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="025410_0085_0FCD26EE043AAC10"/>Give me leave only to add, that it is of the highest importance, if you would not have all your labour in the education of your children lost, that you should be greatly cautious with regard to their settle∣ment in the world. Apprenticeships and marriages, into irreligious families, have been the known sources of innumerable evils. They, who have exposed the souls of their children to apparent danger, for the sake of some secular advantages, have often lived to see them drawn aside to prac∣tices ruinous to their temporal, as well as their eternal interests. Thus their own iniquity has remarkably corrected them: And I heartily pray that the GOD of this world may never be permitted thus to blind your eyes; but that you, my friends, may learn, from the calamities of other fa∣milies, that wholesome lesson, which, if you neglect it, others may perhaps here∣after learn from the ruin of yours.</P>
<P N="4">4. See to it, that you confirm your ad∣monitions by a suitable example, if you de∣sire on the whole that they should prove useful to your children.</P>
<P>A consciousness of the irregularity of our own be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>viour, in any remarkable instan∣ces which may fall under their observa∣tion,
<PB N="87" REF="025410_0086_0FCD26EF9994D7E8"/>
will probably abate much of that force and authority with which we might other∣wise address them. When we know they may justly retort upon us, at least in their minds, those words of the apostle, thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Surely a sense of guilt and of shame must either entirely silence us, or at least impair that freedom and confidence, with which we might otherwise have ex∣horted or rebuked.</P>
<P>Or had we so much composure and as∣surance, as to put on all the forms of inno∣cence and virtue, could we expect regard, when our actions contradicted our discours∣es, or hope they should reverence instruc∣tions, which their teachers themselves ap∣pear to despise? It is in the general true, that there is a silent, but powerful oratory in example, beyond the force of the most elegant and expressive words; and the ex∣ample of parents has often a particular weight with their children; which seems to be alluded to in that exhortation of St. Paul, <HI>Be ye followers</HI> (or imitators) <HI>of God, as dear children.</HI> So that on the whole, as a very celebrated writer well expresses it, "To give children good instruction, and a bad example, is but beckoning to them with the hand to shew them the way to heaven, while we take them by the hand
<PB N="88" REF="025410_0087_0FCD26F0D1BDDEC0"/>
and lead them in the way to hell." We should therefore most heartily concur in David's resolution, as ever we hope our families should be religious and happy: <HI>I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way; I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Cheerfully accept of all proper assist∣ances in the education of your children, if you desire it may succeed well.</P>
<P>It will be your wisdom to accept of the assistance, which may be offered, either from books or friends. Books may in this respect be very useful to you; the book of GOD above all; both to furnish you with materials for this great work, and to in∣struct you in the manner of performing it. Other writings may be subservient to this purpose. Wise and pious treatises on the subject of education may be read with great pleasure and advantage; and you may re∣ceive singular assistance from those cate∣chisms, and prayers, and songs for chil∣dren, with which most of your families are now furnished, through the condescension of one valuable friend in writing them, and the generosity of another in bestowing them upon us. I hope you will express your thankfulness to both, by a diligent care to
<PB N="89" REF="025410_0088_0FCD26F24927C7D0"/>
use them; and I persuade myself, that you and yours may abundantly find your ac∣count in them; for while the language is so plain and easy, that even an infant may understand it, you will often find not only a propriety, but a strength and sublimity in the sentiments, which may be improving to persons of advanced capacities. There is much of that milk, by which strong men may be entertained and nourished.</P>
<P>I add, that in this important work, you should gladly embrace the assistance of pious and prudent friends. I can by no means approve that Lacedemonian law, which gave every citizen a power of cor∣recting his neighbour's children, and made it infamous for the parent to complain of it: Yet we must all allow, that considering the great importance of education, a con∣cern for the happiness of families and the public, will require a mutual watchfulness over each other in this respect: Nor is there any imaginable reason to exclude this from the number of those heads on which we are to admonish one another, and to consider each other to provoke unto good works.</P>
<P>Nothing seems more evident than this; and one would suppose, that persons, who are acquainted with human nature, should suspect, that self-love might work under
<PB N="90" REF="025410_0089_0FCD26F58C651C68"/>
this form, and that they might be a little blinded by a partial affection to their off∣spring. Such a reflection might engage them at least patiently, or rather thankful∣ly, to hear the sentiments, and receive the admonitions of their friends on this head. But instead of this, there is in many people a kind of parental pride, (if I may be al∣lowed the expression) which seldom fails to exert itself on such an occasion. They are so confident in their own way, and do so majesterially despise the opinion of others, that one would almost imagine, they took it for granted, that with every child nature had given to the parent a certain stock of infallible wisdom for the management of it; or that, if they thought otherwise, they ra∣ther chose their children should be ruined by their own conduct, than saved by any foreign advice. If this arrogance only ren∣dered the parents ridiculous, one should not need to be greatly concerned about it; especially as their high complacency in themselves would make them easy, what∣ever others might think or say of them: But when we consider the unhappy conse∣quences it may produce, with regard to the temper and conduct of the rising genera∣tion, it will appear a very serious evil, well worthy a particular mention, and a particular care to guard against it.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="025410_0090_0FCD26F6CDDC08E0"/>As for the assistance of ministers in this work of education, I persuade myself you will be so wise as thankfully to embrace it, both in public and private; and let me urge you to improve it to the utmost. Accustom your children to an early con∣stancy and seriousness in attending divine ordinances, and be often yourselves in∣quiring, and give us leave sometimes to inquire how they advance in acquaintance with religion, and in love to it. And more particularly let them attend to our catechetical lectures, which are peculiarly intended for their service.</P>
<P>I bless GOD, I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seen the happy ef∣fects of this exercise, both in the places where I was educated whilst a child, and in those where I was formerly fixed; and as I am now introducing it among you, with an intention to continue it as long as I am capable of public service, I promise myself your most happy concurrence in it. I will not at large insist on the advantages which may attend it. You easily see, that it will be an engagement to the children to learn those excellent summaries of divine truth, when their progress in them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so often exa∣mined; By repeating it themselves, and hearing it rehearsed by others, it will be more deeply fixed upon their memories: The exposition of it in a plain and familiar
<PB N="92" REF="025410_0091_0FCD26F89E66BAE8"/>
manner may much improve their under∣standings in the doctrines and duties of re∣ligion: And I will add, you who are par∣ents may, by attending on these occasions, possibly learn something as to the way of opening and explaining things, which you may successfully practise at home. In con∣sequence of all, we may hope, that, by the divine blessing, some good impressions may be made on the minds of children. And when they find a minister willing to take pains to instruct them; when they hear him seriously and tenderly pleading with them, and pleading with GOD for them, it may much engage their affections to him, and so promote his usefulness among them, in other ordinances, and in future years. And give me leave to say upon this head, that as no wise and good minister will think it beneath him, to desire the affection of the children of his congregation; so it is the duty of parents to cherish in their offspring, sentiments of respect and love to all the faithful ministers of CHRIST, and especially towards those who statedly labour among them. Whatever mistakes you may dis∣cover in our conduct, or whatever defi∣ciencies in our public ministrations, you should study to conceal them from the no∣tice of your children; lest they should grow up in contempt of those, whose services
<PB N="93" REF="025410_0092_0FCD26FA16BD7110"/>
might otherwise be highly advantageous to them.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, Be earnest in prayer to GOD for his blessing on your attempts in the education of your children, if you desire to see them successful.</P>
<P>This I would leave with you as my last advice? and though I have had frequent occasion to hint at it before, I would now more particularly urge it on your attentive regard. GOD is the author of every good and every perfect gift; it is He who has formed the mind and the tongue, and who teaches man knowledge and address. On him therefore must you fix your depend∣ance, to teach you so to conceive of divine things, and so to express your conceptions of them, as may be most suited to the capa∣cities, the dispositions, and the circum∣stances of your children; and to him you must look to teach them to profit by all, by his almighty grace to open their ear unto discipline, and to bow their heart unto un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>A heathen poet could teach the Romans, in a form of public and solemn devotion, to look up to heaven for influences from thence, to form their youth to the love and practice of virtue. Surely you, my friends,
<PB N="94" REF="025410_0093_0FCD26FB46E0D958"/>
are under much greater obligations to do it, and that in a christian manner; earnest∣ly entreating the GOD of grace, to send down on your rising offspring the effusions of that blessed spirit, which was purchased by the blood of CHRIST, and is deposited in his compassionate hand. If you have tasted that the LORD is gracious, you are daily living on those supplies; let it be your constant errand at the throne of grace, to plead for your children there. Wrestle with GOD in secret, for the life of their souls, and for those regenerating influences on which it depends; and in those family devotions, which I hope you dare not ne∣glect, let the little ones, from their earliest infancy, have a share in your remembrance. You may humbly hope, that He, by whose encouragement and command you pray, will not suffer these supplications to be like water spilt upon the ground: and, in the nature of things, it may tend to make se∣rious impressions on the minds of your children, to hear their own case mentioned in prayer, and may dispose them with greater regard, to attend on what you say to them, when they find you so frequently, so solemnly, and so tenderly pleading with GOD for them.</P>
<P>Doubt not that every faithful minister of CHRIST will most heartily concur with
<PB N="95" REF="025410_0094_0FCD26FDAFAB9148"/>
you, in so great and necessary a request. May GOD return to our united addresses an answer of peace! May he <HI>pour out his spirit on our seed, and his blessing on</HI> our <HI>offspring,</HI> that they <HI>may grow up</HI> before him <HI>as willows by the water courses;</HI> that they <HI>may be</HI> to their <HI>parents for a comfort,</HI> to the <HI>church for a support, and</HI> to our GOD <HI>for a name and a praise!</HI> AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV. ON THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PROV. xxii. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Train up a Child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN treating on this subject of education, I have all along endeavoured, according to my usual manner, to make my discourses as practical as I could. While I was de∣scribing and recommending the way, and offering my advices, with regard to the manner of conducting children into it, most of what I said under those generals was an application to you. I have therefore left myself the less to do here; yet I was not willing to conclude my discourses on a sub∣ject, which it is probable I shall never so largely resume, without</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="025410_0096_0FCD270223418B10"/>Fourthly, a particular address to my hearers, according to your different rela∣tions, and characters in life.</P>
<P>This I promised as my fourth and last general, and I enter on it without farther preface; humbly begging, that GOD, who has so intimate an access to all our hearts, would enable me to speak in the most awak∣ening and edifying manner; and that he would by his blessed spirit, apply it to your consciences, that it may be as a nail fasten∣ed in a sure place; that hearing and know∣ing these things for yourselves, you may hear and know them for your good.</P>
<P>I would here particularly address myself —first to parents, then to children—and in the last place, to those young persons who are grown up to years of maturity, but not yet fixed in families of their own.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let me address my discourse to those of you who are parents; whether you have been negligent of the duties I have now been urging, or through grace have been careful in the discharge of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. To those who have been grossly ne∣gligent in this important care.</P>
<P>I have here one advantage not common to every subject; I mean, that the guilty
<PB N="98" REF="025410_0097_0FCD270387D48FF8"/>
will immediately know themselves. When we apply ourselves in general to uncon∣verted sinners, ignorance of the nature of true religion, a neglect of conversing with your own souls, or the insinuating preju∣dices of self-love, may disguise the true state of the case, and teach people to speak peace to themselves, under the most awful denunciations of wrath and vengeance. But here, one would imagine, that the re∣collection of a few moments might be suf∣ficient to determine the case; because the question relates to past fact, and that not merely to one particular action, but to a long train and succession of labours and at∣tempts.</P>
<P>Now let your consciences witness, whe∣ther I am guilty of a breach of charity, when I take it for granted, that there are some among you who have been, and are, very negligent of the duty I have now been enforcing? You have probably contented yourselves with teaching your children to read, and setting them to learn, like par∣rots, a prayer, and, perhaps too, a cate∣chism and a creed. But I appeal to your consciences. Have you from the very day of their birth to this time, ever spent one hour in seriously instructing them in the knowledge of GOD, and endeavouring to form them to his fear and service; in set∣ting
<PB N="99" REF="025410_0098_0FCD27053A6E1588"/>
before them the misery of their natur∣al condition, and urging them to apply to CHRIST for life and salvation; in repre∣senting the solemnities of death, and judg∣ment, and the eternal world, and urging an immediate and diligent preparation for them? Where is the time, where the place, that can witness, that you have been pour∣ing out your souls before GOD on their ac∣count, and wrestling with him for their lives, as knowing they must perish for ever, without the righteousness of his SON, and the grace of his SPIRIT? Where, or when, have you thus prayed with them, or for them? What sermon have you heard, what scripture have you read, with this thought, "This will I carry to my chil∣dren, and communicate to them as the food of their souls?" I fear there are se∣veral of you who have been so far from do∣ing it, that you have hardly ever seriously thought of it as a thing to be done.</P>
<P>And I would ask, Why have you not thought of it, and why have you not done it? Are these creatures that you have pro∣duced like the other animals of your houses or your field, mere animated systems of flesh and blood, made to take a turn in life for a few days and months, and then to sink into everlasting forgetfulness? Or are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y rational and immortal creatures, that
<PB N="100" REF="025410_0099_0FCD271A6EF6B098"/>
must exist for ever in heaven, or in hell? This is not a matter of doubt with you; and yet you behave, as if the very contrary to what you believe were evident, certain truth. In short, it is the most barbarous part you act, and more like that of an ene∣my than a parent.</P>
<P>It is not that you are insensible of the workings of parental tenderness. No, far from that: it may perhaps sometimes rise to a weak and criminal dotage: yet I re∣peat it again, you are acting an hostile and barbarous part. You are greatly solicitous for their temporal happiness. For this you labour and watch; for this you deny your∣selves many an enjoyment, and subject yourselves to many an uneasy circumstance: But, alas! Sirs, where is the real friendship of all this, while the precious soul is ne∣glected? Your children are born with a corrupted nature, perverted by sinful ex∣amples, ignorant of GOD, in a state of growing enmity to him, and, in conse∣quence of all, exposed to his wrath and curse, and in the way to everlasting ruin. In the mean time it is your great care, that they may pass through this precarious, mo∣mentary life, in ease and pleasure, perhaps in abundance and grandeur; that is, in such circumstances, as will probably lull them into a forgetfulness of their danger,
<PB N="101" REF="025410_0100_0FCCE2FBC41BB648"/>
until there be no more hope. How cru∣el a kindness!</P>
<P>It brings to my mind the account which an ancient writer gives of the old Cartha∣genians, which I can never recollect with∣out great emotion. He is speaking of that diabolical custom which so long prevailed among them, of offering their children to a detestable idol, which was formed in such a manner that an infant put into his hands, which were stretched out to receive it, would immediately fall into a gulf of fire. He adds a circumstance, which one cannot mention without horror; that the mothers, who with their own hands presented the little innocents, thought it an unfortunate omen that the victim should be offered weeping; and therefore used a great many fond artifices to divert it, that soothed by the kisses and caresses of a parent, it might smile in the dreadful moment in which it was to be given up to the idol. Pardon me, my friends; such is your parental care and love; such your concern for the present ease and prosperity of your chil∣dren, while their souls are neglected: A fond solicitude, that they may pass smiling into the hands of the destroyer!</P>
<P>You know, with what just severity GOD reckoned with the Israelites for their abom∣inable wickedness, in taking his sons and
<PB N="102" REF="025410_0101_0FCCE3009E6BAC88"/>
his daughters (for so he calls the children of his professing people) and sacrificing them to be devoured: And can you suppose, he will take no notice of the unnatural neglect of your's? Not to endeavour to save, is to destroy; and is it a little guilt, when an immortal soul is in question? You probab∣ly remember those terrible words in Ezeki∣el; (may they be deeply inscribed on the hearts of all whom they concern!) <HI>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel, therefore hear thou the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me? and if thou speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</HI> If ever you read this passage with attention, you must own it is exceedingly awful, and must be ready to say, "The LORD be mer∣ciful to ministers! they have a solemn ac∣count to give." Indeed they have; and we thank you, if you ever bestow a com∣passionate thought and prayer upon us. But permit me to remind you, and though it be our case, it is not our's alone; you have likewise your share in it. Your chil∣dren are much more immediately commit∣ted to your care, than you and they are committed to our's; and, by a parity of reason, if they perish in their iniquities,
<PB N="103" REF="025410_0102_0FCD27068C293C48"/>
while you neglect to give them warning, their blood will be required at your hand.</P>
<P>And when GOD comes to make inquisi∣tion for that blood, how will you be able to endure it? That awful day will open up∣on on you, and the tribunal of GOD, in all its terrors, will stand unveiled before you. Give me leave to direct your eyes to it in this distant prospect, while there is yet room to mitigate those terrors. If you go on in this cruel negligence of the souls of your children, how will you dare to meet them at that judgment-seat? How will you be able to answer the great FATHER of spi∣rits, when expostulating with you on ac∣count of his offspring, as well as your's, who have been betrayed and ruined by your neglect? "Inhumane creatures," (may HE justly say) "to whom should I have committed the care of them, rather than to you? Did they not, by my ap∣pointment, derive their being from you? Did I not implant in your hearts the natur∣al affections of parents towards them? And to increase the obligation, did they not pass through the tender scenes of infancy and childhood in your arms, and under your eye? If you had no compassion for their perishing souls, if you would exert no efforts for their deliverance and salvation. from whom could those compassions, those
<PB N="104" REF="025410_0103_0FCD270965FE3240"/>
efforts have been expected? But wherein did they appear? Behold the book of my remembrance, the records of thy life, thrown open before thee: Where is the memorial of one hour spent in holy in∣struction, or in fervent prayer with them, or for them? Can I approve, can I acquit you on such a review? Or shall I not ra∣ther visit for these things, and shall not my soul be avenged for such a conduct as this?"</P>
<P>And your children—will they be silent on the occasion? Did Adam, in the distress and amazement of his soul, when in the presence of his Judge, accuse Eve his wife, so lately taken from his side, and commit∣ted to his protection, and still, no doubt, appearing lovely in the midst of sorrow? and will your children in that terrible day spare you? You may rather expect, they will labour to the utmost to aggravate a crime which costs them so dear, that so they may, if possible, alleviate their own guilt, or if not, indulge their revenge. "O GOD," (may they perhaps then cry out in the most piercing accents of indignation and despair) "thou art righteous in the sentence thou passest upon us, and we just∣ly die for our own iniquity. We have destroyed ourselves. But wilt thou not re∣member, that our ruin is in part chargea∣ble
<PB N="105" REF="025410_0104_0FCD270C5E3D3218"/>
here? Had these our parents been faithful to thee, and to us, it had perhaps been prevented. Had our infancy been formed by religious instruction, we might not have grown up to wickedness; we might not, in the advance of life, have de∣spised thy word, and trampled on thy son; but might this day have been owned by thee as thy children, and have risen to that in∣heritance of light and glory, which we now behold at this unapproachable distance. Oh! cursed be the father who begat us; cursed the wombs that bare us; cursed the paps that gave us suck! Remember us, O LORD, whilst thou art judging them; and let us have this one wretched comfort, in the midst of all our agonies, that it is not with impunity that they have betrayed our souls!"</P>
<P>This is indeed shocking and diabolical language; and for that very reason, it is so much the more probable on so dreadful an occasion. And give me leave to ask you one question, my friends, and I will con∣clude the head. If your children were thus crying out against you in the bitter∣ness of their souls, could you attempt to silence them, by reminding them of the care which you took of temporal affairs, or of the riches and grandeur in which you left them on earth? Nay, could you have
<PB N="106" REF="025410_0105_0FCD270D5B7F46B0"/>
the heart so much as to mention such a tri∣fle? And if you could not, then, in the name of GOD, Sirs, how do you satisfy yourselves to confine all your thoughts and labours to that, which, by your own con∣fession, will neither secure your children from everlasting destruction, nor give them one moment's relief in the review, when they are falling into it?</P>
<P>I will make no apology for the plainness, and earnestness, which I have used. Eter∣nal interests are at stake, and the whole te∣nor of scripture supports me in what I say. I had rather you should be alarmed with hearing these things from me now, than tormented with hearing them in another manner from your children, and from GOD at last. If you please to take proper mea∣sures for preventing the danger, I have told you the way at large: If you do not, I hope I may say, "I am in this respect clear from your blood, and the blood of your's, who may perish by your means: Look you to it."</P>
<P>But it is high time that I proceed in my address, and apply myself,</P>
<P N="2">2. To those parents, who have been careful to discharge the duty, we have so copiously described and inforced.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="025410_0106_0FCD270ED7A61F78"/>I cannot suppose, that any of us would pretend to maintain, that in this, or any other branch of duty, we have acted up to the utmost extent and perfection of our rule. I hope an humble sense of the defi∣ciencies of all the best of our services, is frequently leading us to the believing views of a better righteousness than our own, in which alone we can dare to appear before a holy GOD, and answer the demands of his perfect law. Nevertheless, it is surely al∣lowable to rejoice in the testimony of our conscience, with regard to the regularity of our own behaviour, so far as it is con∣formable to reason and scripture; and it is an important duty, thankfully to own those influences of sanctifying and strengthening grace, by which we are what we are.</P>
<P>It is with great pleasure I recollect the reason I have to believe, that many of you, christians, who hear me this day, are in the main, conscientiously practising these du∣ties; and that some of you were doing it long before I was capable of exhorting and directing you. Acknowledge the singular goodness of GOD, by which you have been excited to them, and furnished for them.</P>
<P>More especially have you reason to adore it, if through grace you can say, with re∣gard to the present success, what you may certainly say, as to the future recompence.
<PB N="108" REF="025410_0107_0FCD271084970898"/>
that your labour in the LORD is not in vain. Let GOD have the glory of his own work. I persuade myself, you understand the gospel too well, to ascribe it to the pru∣dence of your own conduct, to the strength of your reasoning, or to the warmth and tenderness of your address. Whatever of these advantages you have possessed, were derived from GOD; and your very care for your offspring is, (as the apostle expresses it in a like case) the earnest care which GOD has put into your hearts. But it was not this care, or these advantages alone, that produced so happy an effect. In vain had your doctrine from day to day dropped as the rain, and distil∣led as the dew, in the most gentle and in∣sinuating manner; in vain had the precious seed of the word been sown with unwearied diligence, and watered with tears too; had not GOD commanded the operations of his blessed spirit to come down, as a more effi∣cacions rain, as more fruitful showers to water their hearts. Oh! be not insensible of the favour. Your own souls might to this very day, have been a barren wilder∣ness, a land of drought, an habitation of devils; and behold, not only they, but your families too, are like a field, like a garden, which the LORD has blessed. GOD might have cut you off many years ago, for
<PB N="109" REF="025410_0108_0FCD2711E5E6CDF8"/>
your neglect of his covenant, or your breaches of it; and behold, he is establish∣ing it, not only with you, but your seed after you, for an everlasting covenant. Methinks your hearts should overflow with gratitude and holy joy, while you dwell on such reflections as these. This should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dd a relish to all the pleasure you find in con∣versing with your children: This should quicken you to a farther diligence in culti∣vating those graces, which you have the sa∣tisfaction to see already implanted: This should reconcile you to all the afflictions, with which Providence may exercise, either you or them: This should support you in the view of a separation, either by your own death, or theirs; since you have so comfortable a hope, that if they are re∣moved they will go to a heavenly Father, and that if they are left behind you, they will be safe and happy under his care, until you meet in a better world, where you will be for ever to each other a mutual glory and joy.</P>
<P>But I cannot congratulate you on this occasion, without the danger of adding af∣fliction to the afflicted parents, whose cir∣cumstances, alas! are far different from your's. I fear, my friends, that there are some among you, who look round you, and look forwards, with far different pro∣spects;
<PB N="110" REF="025410_0109_0FCD27135E3AD888"/>
some who are, with bleeding hearts, borrowing the complaint, which we who are ministers of the gospel, so frequently breathe forth, <HI>We have laboured in vain, and spent our strength for naught.</HI>" "Oh!" (may you perhaps add) "that it were only in vain! those dear children, which we early devoted to GOD in baptism, which we endeavoured to educate in the know∣ledge and fear of the LORD, the children of our hopes, the children of our prayers, are unfruitful unto all our cultivation, or, it may be, visibly turned aside from the good ways in which they were trained up; as if they had known them only to reject and affront them: So that, we have reason to fear, that all we have done, as it is an aggravation of their guilt, will be a propor∣tional aggravation of their ruin."</P>
<P>It is indeed a very pitiable case. We owe you our compassions, and we owe you our prayers; but permit us to intermix our consolations and our admonitions. You have at least delivered your own souls; and as you participate in the sorrows of faithful ministers, you may share in their comforts too; and say with them, though the objects of our compassionate care be not gathered, yet shall we be glorified, for our work is with the LORD, and our reward with our GOD. Go on therefore in the
<PB N="111" REF="025410_0110_0FCD2714CF2A85C8"/>
midst of all your discouragements, and, in this respect, be not weary in well-doing. Take heed of such a despair, as would cut the sinews of future endeavours. If your child were labouring under any bodily dis∣temper, you would be very unwilling that the physicians should quite give him over, and try no farther medicines: You would follow them, and say, "can nothing more be done? Is there not the least glimmering of hope?" Alas! my friends, a child given up by a pious parent, is, to a believing eye, a much more melancholy sight, than a parent given over by the physicians. Excuse me then, if I follow you with the question, "Can nothing more be done? Is there not the least glimmering of hope?" Who told you, that the sentence of con∣demnation is sealed, while you are sure it is not executed. Is the danger extreme? Let your efforts be so much the more zealous, your admonitions so much the more fre∣quent and serious, your prayers so much the more earnest and importunate. And on the whole (to allude to the words of Da∣vid, on a much lower occasion) Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to you, that the child may live? And the sad ap∣prehensions which you now entertain, may only serve to increase the joy with which
<PB N="112" REF="025410_0111_0FCD27188C3146E0"/>
you shall then say, This my son was dead, and is alive again, he was lost and is found.</P>
<P N="2">II. I would address myself to children: To you, the dear lambs of the flock, whom I look upon as no contemptible part of my charge. I have been speaking for you a great while, and now give me leave to speak to you; and pray do you endeavour, for a few minutes, to mind every word that I say.</P>
<P>You see, it is your parents' duty to bring you up for GOD. The great GOD of hea∣ven and earth has been pleased to give his express command, that you should be train∣ed up in the way in which you should go, even in the nurture and admonition of the LORD. It is the wonderful goodness of GOD to give such a charge; and methinks you should be affected with it, and should be inquiring what you should do in return.</P>
<P>Now there are three things, which I would ask of every one of you, in return for this gracious notice which the great GOD has taken of you children; and I am sure, if you love your own souls, you will not deny me any of them.—Be willing to learn the things of GOD; pray for them who teach you; and see to it, you do not learn them in vain. Listen diligently, that
<PB N="113" REF="025410_0112_0FCCE2F9D4A9BBE0"/>
you may understand and remember each of these.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be willing to learn the things of GOD.</P>
<P>The things of GOD are very delightful, and they are very useful: and, whatever you may think of it, your life depends on your acquaintance with them, So CHRIST, himself says, this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true GOD, and JESUS CHRIST, whom thou hast sent (John xvii. 3.) Therefore, you children, should not think much of the labour of learning these things. Oh! far from that, you should be every day upon your knees, beg∣ging GOD that you may be taught to know him, and to know CHRIST. GOD has done a great deal more for you, than he has for many others. You might have been born in a place, where you never would have seen a Bible in all your lives; where you would never have heard the name of CHRIST, where you might never have been instructed in the nature of duty and sin, nor have been told of the world beyond the grave; and so would probably have fallen into Hell, before you had known there was such a place. And the great GOD has ordered matters so, that you are born under the light of the gospel, and
<PB N="114" REF="025410_0113_0FCD271B98C33008"/>
have such plain and such excellent instruc∣tions, that you may know more of divine things in your infancy, than the wise men among the heathen did, when they were old and grey-headed, and had spent all their lives in study. And will you be so ungrateful, as not to be willing to learn, when such provision is made for your in∣struction? GOD forbid! Shall GOD give you his word, and your parents, and mi∣nisters employ their time, and their pains, to teach you the meaning of it, and will you refuse to attend to it? That were fool∣ish, and wicked indeed. I hope much bet∣ter things of you. That is my first advice: Be willing to learn. I add,</P>
<P N="2">2. Pray for those who are to teach you.</P>
<P>I would hope, you little creatures, dare not live without prayer. I hope GOD, who sees in secret, sees many of you o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your knees every morning and eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing, asking a blessing from him as your heavenly Father. Now let me intreat you, that at such times you would pray for those who instruct you in divine things; pray that GOD would bless them for it, and pray that he would help them in it. In praying thus for us, you do indeed pray for yourselves. There is a gracious promise to the people of
<PB N="115" REF="025410_0114_0FCD271DC2ABB740"/>
GOD: <HI>And they shall be all taught of GOD:</HI> (John vi. 45.) Pray, that it may be fulfil∣led. Pray, that GOD would teach us to teach you; else we shall attempt it to a ve∣ry little purpose. Pray for your parents, and pray for your ministers.</P>
<P>Pray for your parents: That GOD would help them to instruct you in such a manner as they have now been directed: That they may do it plainly, so that you may be able to understand what they say; and serious∣ly, that you may be brought to an holy awe of GOD; and tenderly, that you may be engaged to love GOD and his word, and CHRIST and his ways; and pray, that your parents may be stirred up to do it fre∣quently, to give you <HI>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</HI> that you may be put in mind of what you are so ready to forget.</P>
<P>And let me desire you, my dear charge, when you pray for your parents, to pray for your ministers too. I declare it again in the most public manner, it is my earnest desire that children would pray for me. And I verily believe, every faithful minis∣ter of CHRIST would join with me in such a request. We do not, we dare not, de∣spise the prayer of one of these little ones. Far from that, I am persuaded it would greatly revive and encourage us, and we should hope GOD had some singular mercy
<PB N="116" REF="025410_0115_0FCD271EB0E03500"/>
in store for us, and his people, if we were sure the children of the congregation were every day, praying for a blessing on our la∣bours.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed that you do not learn in vain.</P>
<P>The great truths which you are taught from the word of GOD, are not intended merely to fill your heads with notions, but to make your hearts and lives more holy. You know the way to your father's house every step of it, but that would never carry you home, if you would not go in it. No more will it signify to know the way to heaven, unless we walk in it. <HI>If you know these things,</HI> says the Lord JESUS CHRIST himself, <HI>happy are ye if ye do them.</HI> And I may add, that if ye do them not, it had been happier for you, if you had never known them. Dear children, consider it; it is but a little while, and you must die: And when those active bodies of yours are become cold, mouldering clay, the great GOD of heaven and earth will call your souls to his judgment-seat. As sure as you are now in this house, you will shortly, ve∣ry shortly, be standing before his awful throne. Then he will examine, to what purpose you have heard so many religious

instructions, so many good lessons. Then he will examine, whether you have feared, loved and served him, and received the Lord JESUS into your hearts, as your Sa∣viour and your King; whether you have chosen sin or holiness for your way, earth or heaven for your portion. And if it be found, that you have lived without thought, and without prayer, without any regard to the eye of GOD always upon you, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e word of GOD always before you, it will be a most lamentable case. You will have rea∣son to wish, you had never heard of these things at all; for he has said, <HI>The servant that knew his</HI> LORD'S <HI>will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.</HI> Even while I am speaking to you, death is com∣ing on; perhaps his scythe may cut you down, while you are but coming up as flowers. I speak to you thus plainly and earnestly, because I do not know but you may be in eternity before another LORD'S day. Oh! pray earnestly, that GOD would give you his grace to fit you for glo∣ry; and that all of you may be so blessed, that you may be made wise to salvation by it. The LORD grant that it may!</P>
<P>And I have one thing to tell you for your encouragement, and then I have done with you for this time. How young so∣ever you are, and how broken soever your

prayers may be, the great and glorious LORD of angels and men, will be willing to hear what you say. You may be sure to be welcome to the throne of grace. The Lord JESUS CHRIST, when he was upon earth, was very angry with those who would have hindered little children from coming to him: He said, <HI>Suffer little chil∣dren to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of GOD.</HI> And CHRIST is as compassionate now, as ever he was. Go to him as you may humbly hope, he will, as it were, take you up in his arms and bless you. He has said it, and I hope you will never forget it; <HI>I love them that love me, and they that seek me ear∣ly shall find me.</HI> Oh! that I were but as sure, that every child in this assembly would go and ask a blessing from CHRIST, as I am that our dear LORD is willing to bestow it! But to draw to a conclusion,</P>
<P N="3">III. I shall address myself to those young persons who are grown up to years of ma∣turity, under the advantages of a religious education, and are not yet fixed in fami∣lies of their own.</P>
<P>I hope, that many of you have been sen∣sible of the value of those opportunities you have enjoyed, and by divine grace
<PB REF="025410_0118_0FCD2724C0E00F60"/>
have been enabled to improve them well; yet I must add, that I fear, there are others among you, who have unhappily neglected and abused them. I must apply myself dis∣tinctly to each of you.</P>
<P N="1">1. To those young persons, who have neglected and abused the advantages of a religious education.</P>
<P>I confess, there are hardly any to whom I speak with so little pleasure, because I have seldom less reason to hope I shall suc∣ceed. What shall I say to you? What can I say, that you have not often heard, and often despised? One is almost tempted, in such a circumstance, to turn reasonings and expostulations into upbraidings; and even to adopt those too passionate words of Mo∣ses, <HI>"Hear now, ye rebels, you that have grown up in the knowledge, and yet the con∣tempt of divine things; you that have disap∣pointed the hopes, and slighted the admoni∣tions of your pious parents, and so have broken their spirits, and, it may be, their hearts too, and have brought down their hoary hairs with sorrow to the grave. One way or an∣other you have perhaps silenced them. But is it a small thing to you, that you have thus wearied men, and will you attempt to weary your GOD also? Can you dare to hope, that
<PB N="120" REF="025410_0119_0FCD272611740480"/>
you shall at last carry those proud thoughtless heads triumphant over all the terrors of his word?"</HI> You imagine it a very happy cir∣cumstance, that you have got loose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m those mortifying lessons, and uneasy re∣straints, you were once under. But real∣ly, when one seriously considers whither these liberties lead you, and where they will probably end, a just resentment of your ingratitude is almost disarmed, and indignation is converted into pity.</P>
<P>Alas! Sinners, the way of all transgres∣sors is hard; but your's is peculiarly so. You, to whom I am now addressing, are in the morning of your days, and it is not to be supposed, that the impressions of a good education are yet entirely effaced. What future years may do, I know not; but hi∣therto I persuade myself, you have fre∣quently your reflections, and your convic∣tions; convictions which have force enough to torment you, though not to reform you; to plant thorns in the paths of sin, though not to reduce you to those of duty. But if you feel nothing of this remorse and anxie∣ty, such a dead calm is then more dreadful than the fiercest storm and tumult of thought: A sad indication, that your course in wickedness has been exceeding swift; indeed so swift, that it is probable it may not be long. Oh that it might imme∣diately
<PB N="121" REF="025410_0120_0FCD2727956C5C18"/>
be stopped by divine grace, rather than by the vengeance you have so much reason to fear!</P>
<P>At least be engaged to pause in it for a few moments, and let reason and consci∣ence be permitted to speak. How is it that you make yourselves, I will not say entire∣ly, but tolerably easy? Is it by the disbelief of christianity? Do you secretly suspect, that the gospel is but a cunningly-devised fable? Yet even that supicion is not e∣nough. Let me rather ask, "Are you so confident it is so, that you will venture to stake even the life of your souls upon its falshood?" If you were come to such a confidence, yet it is amazing to me, how, even on the principles of natural religion alone, persons in your circumstances can make themselves easy. Can any of the li∣bertines of the present age, who believe a GOD, imagine that he is altogether such an one as themselves? Can they flatter them∣selves so far as to hope, that they, in the ways of negligence, profaneness and de∣bauchery, are like to meet with a more fa∣vourable treatment from him, than those pious parents whose principles they deride? or that this loose and irregular course will end better, than that life of prayer and self-denial, of faith and love, of spirituality and heavenly-mindedness, which they discerned
<PB N="122" REF="025410_0121_0FCD2729CFADC758"/>
in them? Few are so abandoned, even of common sense, as to think this!</P>
<P>But these are more distant concerns. I bless GOD, this kind of infidelity is not in fashion here. You assent to the gospel as true, and therefore must know, that GOD, who observes and records your conduct now, will bring you into judgment for it another day. And if you go on thus, how will you stand in that judgment? What will you plead? On what will you repose the confidence of your souls, that will not prove a broken reed, which will go up into your hand, and pierce you deep, in pro∣portion to the stress you lay upon it? While you behave like a generation of vi∣pers, think not to say within yourselves, <HI>We have Abraham for our father.</HI> Think not to plead a relation to the religious par∣ents, whose GOD and whose ways you have forsaken. Think not to plead an early de∣dication to him in the baptismal covenant, which you have broken, despised, and in fact renounced. Think not to plead that external profession, which you have so shamefully contradicted, and even by wear∣ing it, dishonoured. You will see the weakness of such pleas as these, and will not dare to trifle with that awful tribunal, so far as to mention them there. And when you are yourselves thus silent and
<PB N="123" REF="025410_0122_0FCD272D8025CBC8"/>
confounded, who will appear as an advo∣cate in your favour? Your parents were often presenting their supplications and in∣tercessions for you before the throne of grace, but there will be no room to present them before the throne of justice: Nor will they have any inclination to do it. All the springs of natural fondness will be dried up; they will no longer regard you as their children, when they see you in the accursed number of the enemies of their GOD.</P>
<P>And when you are thus disowned by your parents, and disowned by GOD, whi∣ther will you cause your shame and your terror to go? You, who have had so many privileges, and so many opportunities, perhaps I may add, so many fond pre∣sumptuous hopes too, how will you bear to see multitudes coming from carnal and pro∣fane families, to share with your parents in the inheritance of glory, from which you are excluded? You, who were the children of the kingdom; whose remorse therefore must be the more cutting: whose condem∣nation therefore must be the more weighty! Observe in how strong and lively a view, our LORD has represented this awful thought, in words, which, though imme∣diately addressed to the unbelieving Jews, are remarkably applicable to you: <HI>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when
<PB N="124" REF="025410_0123_0FCD272E49CE6810"/>
ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob</HI> (your pious ancestors) <HI>in the kingdom of GOD, and you yourselves thrust out: And many shall come from the North, and the South, and the East, and the West, and shall sit down with them in the kingdom of GOD; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into utter darkness.</HI></P>
<P>But through the divine forbearance you are not yet shut out. There is still hope even for you, if you will now return to the GOD of your fathers, from whom, by these aggravated transgressions, you have so deeply revolted. Let me once more then tenderly intreat you, and solemnly charge you, by the consolation of the living, and by the memory of the pious dead, by your present comforts, by your future hopes, by the nearly approaching solemnities of death and judgment, by the mercies of GOD, and by the blood of a Redeemer, that you con∣sider and shew yourselves men; that you set yourselves, as it were, attentively to read over the characters inscribed on your memories and understandings in the course of a religious education; that you hearken to the voice of conscience repeating those admonitions, and to the voice of the blessed GOD, as speaking in his word to confirm them; and finally, that you apply to him in a most importunate manner, for those
<PB N="125" REF="025410_0124_0FCD272FC8F4C538"/>
victorious influences of his spirit, which are able to mollify and to transform these hearts of stone, and to raise even you from so low a depth of degeneracy and danger, to the character and happiness of the ge∣nuine children of Abraham. GOD forbid, that I should sin against your souls, and my own, in ceasing to pray that it may be so! And now,</P>
<P N="2">2. I shall conclude all with an address to those young persons who have been, through grace, engaged to a becoming im∣provement of the religious education they have enjoyed.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure of being well assured, that there are many such among you: Many who are now the joy of ministers and parents, and the hope of the church for succeeding years. Let me intreat you, my dear brethren and friends, that you daily acknowledge the divine goodness, in fav∣ouring you with such advantages; and, what is still more valuable, in giving you a heart to prize and improve them.</P>
<P>Think how different your circumstances might have been. Providence might have cast your lot in some distant age or coun∣try, where the true GOD had been un∣known, where your early steps had been
<PB N="126" REF="025410_0125_0FCD2732DB9CD518"/>
guided to the groves and temples of detesta∣ble idols, and you might possibly have been taught to consecrate lust or murder by the name of devotion. Or you might have been educated in popish darkness, where the scripture would have been to you as a sealed book, and you would have seen christianity polluted with idolatrous rites, on some accounts more inexcusable than those of the heathen, and adulterated with the most absurd and pernicious errors. There the mistaken piety of your parents might have proved a dangerous snare, whilst it had infused a blind, and perhaps a cruel zeal, and a proud, furious opposition to all the methods of better information.</P>
<P>Nay, even here, in a protestant coun∣try, is it not too evident, there are many families in which, had you been born and educated, you had sate as in darkness and the shadow of death, though in the land of light and the valley of vision? Your infant-tongue had been formed to the language of hell, and exercised in curses and oaths, ra∣ther than in prayer. You had early been taught to deride every appearance of seri∣ous godliness; and all the irregular propen∣sities of nature had been strengthened by examples of wickedness, which might have been sufficient to corrupt innocence itself. When you consider the wide difference be∣tween
<PB REF="025410_0126_0FCD273447109800"/>
these circumstances and your own, surely whatever your portion of worldly possessions may be, you have reason to lift up your heads to heaven with wonder and gratitude, and to say, <HI>The lines are fallen to us in pleasant places, yea, we have a goodly heritage.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all: There are many around you, who have shared in such advantages as these, and have sinfully abused them, to the dishonour of GOD, to the grief of their parents, and to their own danger, and per∣haps their ruin. And why are not you in that wretched number, or who maketh thee to differ from them? Why are not your hearts barred against the entrance of a Redeemer, but because the LORD has op∣ened them? Why were not all the good instructions which have been given to you, like seed sown upon a rock: but because GOD gave the increase. Adore the riches of this distinguishing grace.</P>
<P>And let me earnestly exhort you, that you be careful still farther to improve it. Give me leave to say, that these fair open∣ings of early seriousness, do naturally raise a very high expectation of eminent ad∣vances in religion. Let it be your humble and diligent care, that these expectations be answered: That your goodness may not be like the morning cloud, or the early dew,
<PB N="128" REF="025410_0127_0FCD2735C7E16908"/>
which soon goeth away; but rather like the dawning light, which shines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</P>
<P>Whilst Providence continues these holy parents, to whom you have been so highly indebted, let it be your constant care, by all the most cheerful returns of duty and gratitude, to express your regard to them▪ and your sense of so great an obligation. And I will add, let it be your care, to hand down to future ages those important advantages you have received from them.</P>
<P>One generation passeth away, and an∣other generation cometh. It is highly pro∣bable, that in a few years, numbers of you will be conducted into new relations; and we please ourselves with the hope, that you will carry religion and happiness into rising families. Let not those hopes be disap∣pointed. When GOD fixes you in houses of your own, let it be your first concern to erect there such domestic altars, as those at which you have worshipped with such holy pleasure, and sensible tokens of divine ac∣ceptance. Let the sacred treasure of divine knowledge which has been deposited with you, be faithfully delivered down to your descendants; that they, in their turn, may arise with the same pious zeal, to transmit it to another generation, that shall be born of them.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="025410_0128_0FCD2738E573A580"/>And may divine grace, that inexhausti∣ble spring of the most valuable blessings, sweetly flow on to add efficacy to all, that real vital religion may be the glory and joy of every succeeding age; until this earth (which is but a place of education for the children of GOD, during their minority) shall pass away to make room for a far nob∣ler scene and state of existence; where pious parents and their religious offspring shall for ever enjoy the most delightful soci∣ety, inhabiting the palace of our heavenly Father, and surrounding the throne of our glorified Redeemer! AMEN.</P>

<P>"IN this country where opinions are every where freely circulated upon all subjects, and where there is a great diversity of senti∣ments respecting religion; it is of the utmost consequence to the cause of truth, to promote a taste for reading the works of judicious and practical writers upon the important doctrines of the gospel.</P>
<P>"Many books, remarkable for their evange∣lical principles, and experimental method of treating religious subjects, have been published by the learned and pious reformers of their church, and their successors in the ministry, which, although some of them are obsolete in the language, and not very fashionable in the arrangement of the several parts, contain those peculiar doctrines of grace, those scriptural truths, which have been frequently blessed with a divine influence.</P>
<P>"We are happy to find, that the demand for these seems to increase of late, in various and distant parts of this country; and that, by the laudable exertions of some of the printers in America, who have published a great variety of practical works, and several editions of the Bi∣ble, this demand is likely to be supplied with convenience to the people, and on as reasonable terms as they can be imported from Europe. We, therefore, take the liberty to recommend the following books, published in this country, to the esteem and perusal of our countrymen, both on patriotic and religious principles; and hope they will prove of eminent usefulness to
