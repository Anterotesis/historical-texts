<HEAD>A COMMENT ON SOME PASSAGES IN THE BOOK of JOB.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IMPERIAL JOB grew old without a care;</L>
<L>Vast were his stores, and sumptuous was his fare.</L>
<L>Of num'rous herds and spacious fields possest,</L>
<L>What monarch could be more securely blest?</L>
<L N="5">Nor was his wealth, the wealth of fields alone;</L>
<L>His heart with every grace divinely shone.</L>
<L>Each comfort heaven unweariedly bestow'd;</L>
<L>With each paternal joy his bosom glow'd.</L>
<L>But now he must his blessedness forego,</L>
<L N="10">And groan beneath variety of woe:</L>
<L>Now he's the victim of Satanic rage,</L>
<L>And nature seems malignant war to wage:</L>
<L>His fields are burnt; his flocks, his Sons, are slain;</L>
<L>His body scar'd and spotted o'er with pain.</L>
<L N="15">He wept; he sunk; yet bowing to the rod,</L>
<L>His soul adores a more immediate GOD:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="012749_0003_0F8BED35020EF658"/>
He shudder's to reproach his maker's name</L>
<L>Tho' by his foolish wife urg'd to blaspheme,</L>
<L>In all the various emphasis of grief,</L>
<L N="20">His friends confess his woes beyond relief;</L>
<L>Each with his mantle rent sits on the ground;</L>
<L>They smite their breasts; the skies with groans resound.</L>
<L>Seven days were all in awful stillness spent</L>
<L>'Till JOB thus gave his long prest anguish vent,</L>
<L N="25">"Perish the day wherein I was conceiv'd;</L>
<L>"In each revolving year, of light bereav'd,</L>
<L>"Be it forgot; let horrid darkness lower</L>
<L>"Thro' all the night, and chase the dawning hour,</L>
<L>"Be it accurst; because a child it gave</L>
<L N="30">"A child of grief, nor saw the womb my grave,</L>
<L>"Wherefore did GOD then spare me, in his ire?</L>
<L>"Oh! had I been permitted to expire!</L>
<L>"Then should I now have slumber'd with the just;</L>
<L>"Where kings and slaves partake an equal dust;</L>
<L N="35">"Where all the wicked are forbid to reign;</L>
<L>"And where th' oppressed poor, no more complain:</L>
<L>"Where groaning prisoners find a full release</L>
<L>"And men no longer are at war with peace:

<L>His strange complaints astounded all his friends;</L>
<L>His murmurs they reprove, and he defends;</L>

Hale is the offspring of the goat and hind,</L>

<L>And seek one fang or scale to load their car.</L>

<L>To scatter death, he fiercely takes delight,</L>
<L>When once the strong, provoke him to the fight.</L>
<L>The stoutest, JOB, are not ashamed to flee,</L>
<L N="290">Who then shall ever dare to turn on me?</L>
<L>Am I indebted for the gifts I own?</L>

<L>He breathes a cloud of mingled smoke and fire.</L>
<L>Survey with fear: What fangs! What scales are seen!</L>
<L>So close no air can edge its way between.</L>
<L>His harden'd jaws, like spacious doors, unfold;</L>
<L N="310">His teeth the mighty with dismay, behold.</L>
<L>When for his sport, he stains the waves with mud;</L>
<L>Behold vast stones uprais'd swim thro' the flood.</L>
<L>The ocean with the skies, a tempest blends,</L>
<L>When thro' the deep his hoary way he bends:</L>

<L>And from the furrow'd foam, with terror flies.</L>
<L>His hugeness now buoyant on the streams,</L>
<L>His scales pour back against the sun, his beams.</L>
<L>Is ought on earth so strong, beyond compare,</L>
<L N="320">So utterly incapable of fear!</L>
<L>Then the Chaldean all his crime deplor'd;</L>
<L>Trembling he ceas'd to murmur, and ador'd.</L>
<L>Thy might is wonderful, great king of kings,</L>
<L>Thou canst perform unutterable things.</L>
<L N="325">Thine ire if once incens'd who can endure;</L>
<L>To thee compar'd arch-seraphs are impure.</L>

How deeply are thy counsels hid from men?</L>
<L N="330">Thy wond'rous purposes surpass their ken.</L>
<L>Should Heaven's bright host aspire to reign with thee;</L>
<L>And with thy godhead claim equality;</L>
<L>Thou might'st on all that vast refulgent train,</L>

<L>This have I heard; but never could I see</L>
<L>Till now, thy wisdom, might and purity.</L>

<L>My work shall be to worship not complain.</L>
