<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrine of Baptisins</HI> hath been dark and obscure in the Church, from the very pri∣mitive Times, and hath had more of <HI>human No∣tion,</HI> than of <HI>divine Truth</HI> in it; and therefore <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> writing touching this Point, speaks thus, in the Beginning of his Book, intituled, <HI>De Bap. Tom. 2. f. 57. Illud mihi ingenuè circa Libri Initium discendum est, ferè omnes eos, quotquot ab ipsi Apostolorum Temporibus, de Baptismo scribere instituerunt, non in Paucis (quod Pace omnium Hominum dictum esse velim) à Scopo aberravisse:</HI> That is, <HI>In the Beginning of my Book</HI> (saith he) <HI>I must ingenuously profess, that almost all those that have undertaken to write of Baptism, even from the very Time of the Apo∣stles, have (which I desire may be spoken with the Favour of all) not in a few Things erred from the Scope.</HI> And as he affirms, that almost all before him had erred in many Things touching Bap∣tism, so did he himself also err, as well as they, not in a Few: And it is as free for me, or any Body else, to differ from him, and other late Writers; especially if that be true which godly and learned <HI>Chemnitius</HI> affirms out of <HI>Augustine,</HI> that these Things are not <HI>Tanquam Articuli Fidei, à quibus diversum sentire Piaculum sit Anathemate dig∣num,</HI> Chemnit. <HI>Examen Concil. Trident. l. de Bapt.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>Reader,</HI> I acquaint thee before∣hand, that in this Point, I shall speak much <HI>other∣wise</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="008338_0003_102F330508074C40"/>than all former, or latter Writers whatever, that I have met with; and though I do not, with∣out some <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> dissent from so ma∣ny <HI>worthy</HI> and <HI>gracious</HI> Men, that have been, and are, otherwise <HI>minded;</HI> yet it is the less grievous to me, because I differ from them (I can say it in Truth before the Lord) not out of any Desire to be <HI>singular,</HI> or for any <HI>worldly</HI> or <HI>carnal End</HI> what∣soever, but only that I might cleave to the <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>evident Word</HI> of <HI>God</HI> alone, even <HI>there</HI> where I see the very <HI>Faithful</HI> to leave it; seeing I am rather to join to the <HI>Word</HI> without <HI>Men,</HI> than to join to <HI>Men</HI> without the <HI>Word;</HI> and where I find the <HI>ho∣liest Men</HI> in the World, and the <HI>Word</HI> parting, I am there to leave them, and to <HI>go along</HI> with the <HI>Word.</HI></P>
<P>And so, in all <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Meekness,</HI> I tender this Discourse to thee; <HI>desiring</HI> that if thou <HI>canst</HI> not at the present <HI>agree</HI> to what is therein contained, yet that thou wouldst not rashly <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>reproach</HI> it, seeing, thro' God's <HI>Goodness,</HI> it may come to pass, that <HI>what thou knowest not now, thou mayest know afterwards.</HI></P>
<P>But because I see this present <HI>Generation</HI> so <HI>rooted</HI> and <HI>built</HI> up in the Doctrines of <HI>Men,</HI> I have the less Hope that this Truth will <HI>prevail with them;</HI> and therefore I <HI>appeal</HI> to the <HI>next Genera∣tion,</HI> wich will be <HI>farther removed</HI> from those E∣vils, and will be <HI>brought nearer</HI> to the <HI>Word;</HI> but especially that <HI>People</HI> whom God hath, and shall form by his <HI>Spirit</HI> for <HI>himself;</HI> for these only will be <HI>able</HI> to make <HI>just</HI> and <HI>righteous</HI> Judgment in this <HI>Matter,</HI> seeing they have the <HI>Anointing</HI> to be their <HI>Teacher,</HI> and the <HI>Lamb</HI> to be their <HI>Light.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE DOCTRINE OF <HI>BAPTISMS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Lord,</HI> foreseeing how great an E∣vil it would be in the <HI>Church,</HI> to leave Men either to their own, or other Mens <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> in the Things of God, did, in the very Beginning of the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> command and bind all the Faithful, to hear <HI>Christ</HI> alone; saying from <HI>Heaven</HI> (that we might give absolute <HI>Credit</HI> to his Voice) <HI>This is my be∣loved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear him;</HI> And the more the <HI>Faithful</HI> have kept to the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> the more they have been free from <HI>Er∣ror,</HI> and the more they have left <HI>this,</HI> and turned aside after the <HI>Doctrines of Men</HI> (though <HI>Men</HI> in some Measure <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>holy</HI>) the more have they been <HI>perverted</HI> and <HI>seduced;</HI> insomuch that the <HI>true Church of God,</HI> and the very <HI>Faithful</HI> themselves, have received, held and maintained, divers <HI>Errors,</HI> and <HI>false Doctrines,</HI> and <HI>Opinions,</HI> even for many Ages and Generations; yea, and have not been altogether free from some, from the very <HI>Apostles</HI> Time: And because many, or most, <HI>godly Men,</HI> in former Ages, held such and such <HI>Opinions;</HI> therefore the <HI>following</HI> Ages have
<PB N="6" REF="008338_0005_102F330A3AAF6448"/>taken them upon <HI>Trust</HI> from them, and have en∣tertained them as <HI>sure</HI> and <HI>certain,</HI> though not at all <HI>consulting,</HI> in those Points, with the great <HI>Doctor</HI> and <HI>Apostle</HI> of the New Testament, <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> And thus have the very <HI>Elect</HI> themselves been drawn into much <HI>Error,</HI> though they have still had <HI>Christ</HI> for their <HI>Foundation,</HI> and were <HI>built</HI> on him so firmly by <HI>Faith, that the Gates of Hell could not prevail against them.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to free the <HI>Faithful</HI> from the <HI>former Mi∣stake</HI> (and consequently from all <HI>Error</HI>) there is no other Way than this, <HI>wholly to forsake the Doc∣trines of Men,</HI> and to <HI>lay by</HI> all those <HI>Opinions</HI> that we have sucked in from our very <HI>Cradles,</HI> and which are now become even a <HI>natural Religion</HI> to us; I say, utterly to <HI>lay by,</HI> and wholly to forget all these Things, and to come <HI>immediately</HI> to the <HI>pure unerring Word of God,</HI> and to the Voice of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> himself, by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> wherein all Things are <HI>true, sincere</HI> and <HI>perfect;</HI> and not bring <HI>Hearts</HI> to the <HI>Word,</HI> that are prepossessed with <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Opinions</HI> learned of <HI>Men,</HI> but to come thither with Hearts and Consciences <HI>free</HI> and <HI>unengaged,</HI> and in all Meekness, Uprightness and Simplicity of Heart, to hear what <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>true Witness,</HI> will say by his <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> which also is the <HI>Spirit of Truth;</HI> and to re∣ceive and believe <HI>that alone,</HI> though never so <HI>dif∣fering</HI> from the <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Doctrines</HI> of this <HI>present Age,</HI> as well as of the <HI>former,</HI> and tho' perhaps the whole <HI>Nation</HI> would be <HI>offended</HI> with it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008338_0006_102F330BD46FFAB8"/>
And <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Course</HI> that I have observed, to come to some <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>certain Knowledge</HI> in the <HI>Doctrine of Baptism:</HI> For, having <HI>read much,</HI> and <HI>discoursed</HI> with <HI>many</HI> touching this <HI>Point,</HI> and having seriously considered what they say, as <HI>one</HI> that searched after the <HI>Truth,</HI> for itself only, and for the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of my own <HI>Soul;</HI> I do profess I could not find any Thing almost spoken, for my Spirit <HI>boldly</HI> and <HI>safely</HI> to lean on, as perceiv∣ing most of what they said, to be but the <HI>Appre∣hensions</HI> and <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> and that they spoke very much by Conjecture, and at Uncertainty in this <HI>Matter;</HI> and thereupon I resolved, <HI>wholly</HI> to withdraw from such <HI>Discourse,</HI> and to lay down whatever <HI>Opinions</HI> I had before entertained, touch∣ing this <HI>Point,</HI> and to come to the <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>ma∣nifest Scriptures;</HI> and from <HI>thence</HI> (after much seeking God) to <HI>learn</HI> whatever the <HI>Lord</HI> should please to <HI>teach</HI> me; chusing rather to <HI>build</HI> on the <HI>clear Word,</HI> though <HI>alone,</HI> than on any <HI>uncertain Inferences,</HI> and <HI>blind Conjectures of Men,</HI> though embraced and magnified by all <HI>the World.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in this Enquiry from the <HI>Word,</HI> I met with that Place, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 2. where the Apostle, speaking of some of the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>initial Points of Christian Religion,</HI> names the <HI>Doctrine of Bap∣tisms;</HI> whence I perceived that, in the <HI>primitive Church</HI> they had the <HI>Doctrine of Baptism</HI> in the <HI>Plural Number;</HI> and therefore did apply myself to search from the <HI>Word,</HI> what these <HI>Baptisms</HI> might be, and so met with the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s own <HI>Doc∣trine,</HI> touching <HI>Baptisms,</HI> mentioned <HI>Matthew</HI> iii. <HI>Mark</HI> i. <HI>Luke</HI> iii. and <HI>John</HI> i. (for all the <HI>Evan∣gelists</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="008338_0007_102F330E2FE75DE0"/>make Mention of this, it being a Matter of so great Concernment) and <HI>Luke</HI> makes Mention of the Ground of this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Baptist,</HI> Chap. iii. 15. <HI>As the People were in Expectation</HI> (saith he) <HI>and all Men mused in their Hearts of</HI> John, <HI>whether he were the Christ or not,</HI> John <HI>an∣swered, saying,</HI> &amp;c. The People, it seems, had <HI>great</HI> and <HI>high</HI> Thought of <HI>John,</HI> because he was the Son of the <HI>High Priest,</HI> conceived after an extraordinary <HI>Manner,</HI> his Parents being both well stricken in Age, and past Children, by the <HI>Course</HI> of Nature; and then the Manner of his Life was strange, for he lived in the Wilderness out of the ordinary <HI>Converse</HI> of the World; and his <HI>Apparel</HI> and <HI>Diet</HI> were unusual, being <HI>Rai∣ment of Camel's Hair, and a leathern Girdle about his Loins, and his Meat Locusts and wild Honey;</HI> but especially his Ministry was mighty, being in the <HI>Spirit and Power of</HI> Elias; and his Baptism new and famous; so that all the People stood in great <HI>Expectation</HI> of some <HI>Work</HI> or <HI>Event</HI> from him, that should <HI>manifest</HI> him to be the <HI>Christ;</HI> wherefore <HI>John,</HI> to take them off from that <HI>gross</HI> and <HI>dangerous Mistake,</HI> plainly told them all, and that openly, <HI>That he was not the Christ,</HI> but that there was a great Deal of Difference between <HI>himself</HI> and the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and that both in Regard of his <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Office.</HI></P>
<P>First for his <HI>Office.</HI> For he begins to shew the Difference from <HI>thence,</HI> because the <HI>Newness</HI> of his <HI>Baptism,</HI> was the Occasion of the Peoples conceiving, that he was the <HI>Messiah;</HI> whereupon he vilifies his own <HI>Baptism,</HI> in respect of <HI>Christ</HI>'s,
<PB N="9" REF="008338_0008_102F3310EAA2E6D8"/>saying, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water;</HI> that is, <HI>my Baptism</HI> is but <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> that washes the <HI>Body</HI> only with a <HI>corporeal Element; but one mightier than I comes,</HI> for I am but a <HI>Creature,</HI> he the <HI>Power of God;</HI> I but a <HI>Servant,</HI> he the <HI>Lord of all,</HI> and one so <HI>infinitely excellent</HI> above all that I am, that the <HI>Latchets of his Shoes I am not wor∣thy to unloose;</HI> that is, I am unworthy to perform the <HI>meanest</HI> and <HI>lowest Office</HI> for him. And hav∣ing thus first spoken meanly of his <HI>own Baptism,</HI> and then magnified <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Person</HI> above his own, <HI>He</HI> (saith he) <HI>shall baptize you with the Holy Spi∣rit, and with Fire;</HI> that is, I that am a <HI>Servant</HI> do baptize with <HI>Water;</HI> but he, that is, the <HI>Son,</HI> baptizes with the <HI>Spirit;</HI> my <HI>Baptism</HI> washes but the <HI>Body</HI> from the Filth of the <HI>Flesh;</HI> but his, the <HI>Soul</HI> from Filth of <HI>Sin;</HI> so that how much the <HI>Spirit</HI> excels <HI>Water,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Creature,</HI> so much his <HI>Baptism</HI> transcends mine.</P>
<P>Now hence I gather <HI>clearly,</HI> even from the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s own Mouth, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI>'s were <HI>distinct Baptisms,</HI> the one <HI>Water-Bap∣tism,</HI> the other <HI>Fire-Baptism;</HI> and though our <HI>late Writers</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> have, and do affirm, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>Christ's</HI> make up but <HI>one intire Baptism;</HI> yet all generally of the <HI>antient Christians</HI> apprehended them to be distinct; one whereof saith, <HI>Illud manifestum est, alium fuisse Johannis Baptismum, alium Christi.</HI> August. <HI>con∣tra Liter.</HI> Petil. c. c. 37. And I could produce <HI>many</HI> more Testimonies besides, but it is not my Meaning to <HI>entangle</HI> any Body with the <HI>Authority</HI> of Men, and therefore I shall make it plain by
<PB N="10" REF="008338_0009_102F33142105F6D8"/><HI>clear Scriptures,</HI> and Evidences from them, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI>'s, are distinct.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI>'s are distinct in their <HI>Appellations</HI> in Scripture; for <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> was still so called, even when the Apostles used it; and it was not called by <HI>their Names</HI> who administered it, but was still called <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism:</HI> Yea, after <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> came in, <HI>John</HI>'s still retained its Name, as being <HI>distinct</HI> from it; and therefore, <HI>Acts</HI> xviii. 24, 25. it is said, <HI>Apollos taught diligently the Things of the Lord,</HI> knowing only <HI>the Baptism of</HI> John.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture saith, that <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> was to follow <HI>John</HI>'s, and did not accompany it at the same Time; for <HI>Matth.</HI> iii. <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>I do baptize you with Water, but he that come after me,</HI> i. e. in Order of Time, <HI>he shall baptize you.</HI> And in <HI>Luke</HI> iii. <HI>I have baptized you,</HI> but <HI>he shall baptize you;</HI> which Places plainly declare <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> did not <HI>go along</HI> with <HI>John</HI>'s, but was to <HI>follow</HI> it, and that he was to <HI>baptize</HI> with the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> after <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> had had its <HI>full Course,</HI> to wit, when he was <HI>risen</HI> from the <HI>Dead,</HI> and <HI>ascended</HI> into Heaven. And therefore <HI>Christ,</HI> after he was risen from the Dead, and immedi∣ately before he was to ascend into Heaven, tho' his Disciples had used <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> or <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> for above three Years, yet affirms that which <HI>John</HI> had said of him, touching his <HI>Bap∣tism with the Spirit, was not yet</HI> fulfilled, but was <HI>shortly</HI> to be fulfilled, as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> i. 4, 5. <HI>Christ being assembled with the Apostles, commanded them that they should not depart from</HI> Jerusalem,
<PB N="11" REF="008338_0010_102F33168E25CBB0"/><HI>but wait for the Promise of the Father, which,</HI> saith he, <HI>you have heard of me; for</HI> John <HI>truly baptized with Water, but ye shall be baptized with the Spirit, not many Days hence;</HI> and this was ful∣filled at the Day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> whence it is evi∣dent, that <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> did not <HI>go along</HI> with <HI>John</HI>'s, and make that up <HI>one entire Baptism</HI> with <HI>itself,</HI> seeing it <HI>followed almost</HI> four Years after, an therefore <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI>'s must needs be distinct.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is evident, that <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s were distinct, in as much as the <HI>Baptism of Christ</HI> was necessary for those very Persons, who had be∣fore been baptized with the Baptism of <HI>John;</HI> whereas, if <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism had been <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> with Christ, that only had been sufficient; but now, those whom <HI>John</HI> had baptized with <HI>Water,</HI> Christ was to baptize again with the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> as in that Place before mentioned, <HI>I have bap∣tized you with Water, but one comes after me, who</HI> shall <HI>baptize you with the Spirit;</HI> even you whom I have before baptized with <HI>Water:</HI> And this was not a second Baptism, but the first Baptism of the <HI>New Testament, John</HI>'s Baptism being more <HI>legal</HI> than <HI>evangelical;</HI> and <HI>evangelical</HI> only, in so much as it pointed out this Baptism of Christ at Hand.</P>
<P>Again, the Baptist himself saith, <HI>I have Need to be baptized of thee;</HI> so that the very Author, or chief Minister of <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> stood in Need of <HI>spiritual Baptism</HI> himself: <HI>Paul</HI> also, <HI>Acts</HI> xix. when he found certain Disciples baptized only with the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> he baptized them a∣gain
<PB N="12" REF="008338_0011_102F3318EE7C73A0"/>in the <HI>Name of Christ,</HI> because they had not received the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and this Baptism into the <HI>Name of Christ,</HI> was not the repeating of any <HI>Water,</HI> but meerly the <HI>Gift of the Spirit;</HI> for <HI>Paul</HI> preached to them largely the Doctrine of Faith in Christ (for the Text relates but the Ab∣stract of the Thing) <HI>and laid his Hands on them,</HI> and through his Ministry the holy Spirit came up∣on them, and this was Christ's Baptism indeed, and no renewing of Water at all, as the <HI>Anabap∣tist</HI> would fain inforce from this Place.</P>
<P>By these Things it is evident, that <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s are distinct; and therefore as what God hath joined, no Man ought to put asunder, so what God hath put asunder, no Man ought to join; as if the <HI>Baptism of Christ</HI> was <HI>insufficient</HI> and <HI>incompleat,</HI> except we should add to it the <HI>Baptism of John;</HI> which is exceedingly to eclipse the Brightness of the Son of God, as to draw a Vail over the greatest Glory of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> which is the <HI>Baptism of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> If the ordinary Objection shall be offered against this, to wit, that <HI>John</HI>'s Doctrine was the same with Christ's, and therefore his Baptism also was the same with his;</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer, it is most true, that <HI>John</HI> did preach <HI>Christ</HI> clearly, both in Regard of his <HI>Per∣son</HI> and <HI>Offices;</HI> but this was not his <HI>proper Work,</HI> as he was the <HI>Baptist,</HI> but in so much as he preach∣ed Christ in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> he belongeth to the King∣dom of Christ, which is <HI>spiritual,</HI> as also, <HI>Abra∣ham, Moses, David, Isaiah,</HI> and all the <HI>Prophets,</HI> did in the same Sense: But so far forth as he
<PB N="13" REF="008338_0012_102F331BA938D370"/>preached the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and administered the <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> and both these not <HI>really</HI> and <HI>spiritually,</HI> but only in the <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Sign,</HI> so far he belonged to the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> rather than to the <HI>New:</HI> Here was <HI>John</HI> in his proper <HI>Office.</HI> I say, so far as <HI>John</HI> preached Christ <HI>spiritually,</HI> he did not that as <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, but as <HI>John</HI> a Believer; and so the same <HI>John,</HI> in Regard of his <HI>Baptist's Office,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Old Testament;</HI> but according to the Revelation which he had from the Father, touching Christ, and his Faith in him, and Confession of him, he belonged to the <HI>New.</HI> And except we learn thus to <HI>distin∣guish</HI> of <HI>John</HI>'s Doctrine, to wit, what he preach∣ed as <HI>Baptist,</HI> and in his proper <HI>Office,</HI> and what as a Believer, who had the Revelation of the Fa∣ther, we shall never understand his <HI>Baptism</HI> a∣right: For <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> was the <HI>Seal</HI> of his Old Testament Doctrine, and not of his New, or of his own immediate Ministry, and not of Christ's; at the highest, <HI>John</HI>'s Ministry and Bap∣tism pointed out Christ, but neither of them were the same with Christ's.</P>
<P>And thus having cleared from the Word, that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> is distinct from Christ's, I shall proceed to speak of each of these Baptisms apart by themselves, and to hold forth to others what myself have learned touching them from the same Word.</P>
<P>And first I begin with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> as be∣ing the first in Order of Time.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John</HI> was brought in besides the <HI>Rite</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and
<PB N="14" REF="008338_0013_102F331E13F3BE08"/>so was a Sign of a great Change to follow: The <HI>Jews</HI> indeed had their <HI>Baptisms</HI> in the Law, for they washed their <HI>Members, Garments, Vessels,</HI> &amp;c. and by this they were cleansed from <HI>legal Pollu∣tions,</HI> but not from any <HI>Sin</HI> or <HI>Stain</HI> that did cleave to their <HI>Conscience;</HI> but <HI>John</HI> was the Author, or first Minister of a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>unwonted Baptism,</HI> cal∣ling all Men to <HI>Repentance for Sin,</HI> and to <HI>flee from the Wrath to come,</HI> and awakening them to <HI>Confession of Sin,</HI> and <HI>Amendment of Life,</HI> and al∣so pointing out one to come, and now at Hand, who should do all these Things for them indeed, which neither he nor his Baptism, could do.</P>
<P>Now touching <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism, I shall shew,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Honourableness</HI> of it in itself.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Weakness and Imperfectness</HI> of it, in Reference to Christ.</P>
<P>And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Continuance</HI> and <HI>Duration</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the <HI>Honourableness</HI> of itself, it appears in several Passages.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That tho' the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> in itself, was more <HI>legal</HI> than <HI>evangelical,</HI> yet in this it did excel all the former <HI>legal</HI> Baptisms, that it point∣ed out <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism near at Hand;</HI> for as <HI>John</HI> himself was greater than all the former Prophets, because he pointed out, with his Finger, Christ the true and great Prophet of the Church; so his Baptism was more excellent than all the former Baptisms, because it pointed out Christ's great and glorious Baptism now at Hand, as he saith, <HI>I bap∣tize you with Water, and he that comes after me, shall baptize you with the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="008338_0014_102F33206C72B538"/>
2. <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism was from Heaven, and not from Men; it had its Institution from God, and was not an Ordinance he took up of his own Head. <HI>Luke</HI> iii. 2. it is said, that at the Beginning of <HI>John</HI>'s setting forth to his Baptism and Mini∣stry, <HI>That the Word of God came to him in the Wilderness;</HI> that is, he was inspired, instructed and taught by a Word from God himself touch∣ing his Ministry-Baptism, and the Discovery of Christ's his was to make; and <HI>John</HI> i. 6. <HI>There was a Man sent from God, whose Name was</HI> John, and Verse 33. <HI>He that sent me to baptize with Water, said unto me.</HI> He went not of his own Accord, but God sent him to baptize; so that as God was the Author of those inferior Bap∣tisms of <HI>Moses,</HI> so of this more high and excel∣lent Baptism of <HI>John;</HI> and hereupon the <HI>Publi∣cans,</HI> that received <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism, are said to <HI>justify God;</HI> and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> that refused it, to <HI>reject against themselves;</HI> that is, to their own Harm, the <HI>Counsel of God,</HI> Luke vii. 29.30.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Christ himself,</HI> who was born under the Law, and subject to the Law, submitted himself also to the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> as the <HI>last</HI> and <HI>liveliest Ce∣remony,</HI> Matt. iii. 13. <HI>Then cometh Jesus from</HI> Ga∣lilee <HI>to</HI> Jordan, <HI>to be baptized of him,</HI> and so Christ, who had submitted himself to the <HI>Cir∣cumcision</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> submitted himself also to the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John;</HI> and as he submitted himself to all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> not for his own Sake, but for ours; so also to the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John.</HI> For seeing Christ was free from Sin, he stood in
<PB N="16" REF="008338_0015_102F3322DE9BE060"/>no Need of <HI>Repentance,</HI> and so not of that <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> which was the <HI>Baptism of Repentance for the Remission of Sin;</HI> but there the <HI>Head,</HI> who was free from Sin, was baptized for the <HI>Body,</HI> which was full of Sin, <HI>that he might fulfil all Righteousness</HI> in his own <HI>Person.</HI> And this was a great Honour to the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> that Christ (though in Reference to our Flesh more than his own) <HI>submitted himself</HI> to it.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John</HI> was very <HI>Honourable,</HI> and of <HI>high Account</HI> in its Time, so that the very <HI>Disciples</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> took it up, and <HI>Christ</HI> himself suffered them, because <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> was the Sign and Fore-runner of his, and because the Time of his own <HI>Baptism</HI> was not yet come; but Christ himself used it not, as <HI>John</HI> witnesses, Chap. iv. 2. saying, <HI>Jesus himself bap∣tized not, but his Disciples;</HI> to wit, with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> which was <HI>Water-Baptism.</HI> For it be∣came not the <HI>Son of God</HI> to <HI>baptize</HI> with a Crea∣ture; nor the <HI>Lord</HI> of all, to use the <HI>Baptism</HI> of a Servant.</P>
<P>And thus, having shewed how <HI>Honourable John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> was in <HI>itself</HI> (wherein I conceive I have not done him, though a Servant, the least Prejudice, but have fully attributed to his <HI>Office,</HI> whatever the Word, or he himself, a Messenger from God, attributes to it) I shall now proceed to shew, <HI>That the</HI> Baptism <HI>of</HI> John, <HI>how honour∣able and excellent soever, is yet far beneath and below</HI> Christ<HI>'s; yea and most weak and imperfect in Comparison of his.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008338_0016_102F332569C55430"/>
For first, <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism was with a <HI>Creature,</HI> with the <HI>Element of Water,</HI> for the <HI>Creature</HI> could baptize but with the <HI>Creature;</HI> that is, <HI>John</HI> with <HI>Water;</HI> and so this was far beneath the Baptism of <HI>Christ,</HI> which was the Work of <HI>God</HI> by <HI>God,</HI> the Work of the Father by the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Son</HI> by the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism was <HI>tantum exterius Lava∣crum,</HI> but <HI>outward,</HI> and reached the outward Man only; the Baptism of Water reached but the Bo∣dy, and it could pierce no deeper; and after all the Washing of the Body with Water, the Soul still remained as full of <HI>Filth, Sin,</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> as ever; and so it was far beneath <HI>Christ</HI>'s, which reaches the <HI>Soul:</HI> The Baptism of <HI>John</HI> was the Baptism of Bodies, but the Baptism of Christ the Baptism of Souls; and only the Baptism of the Spirit reaches the Spirit, and attains to the Soul, Conscience and inner Man, to purge and purify them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Baptism of <HI>John</HI> was but a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Ceremony,</HI> though it had more <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> in it than any of the <HI>Signs</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> as being nearer to Christ, and more newly revived by God; and so thought useful in its Season, yet the Effi∣cacy of it (after the Manner of all Signs) was but weak.</P>
<P>For <HI>First,</HI> It did not give the Spirit one Drop of the Spirit; yea, some who were baptized with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> did not <HI>know the Way of the Lord</HI> perfectly; that is, had no certain Know∣ledge of Christ, the only Way to God, as <HI>Apol∣los, Acts</HI> xviii, yea, some of them did not so much
<PB N="18" REF="008338_0017_102F3327E6B13A48"/>as know, <HI>whether there were any Holy Ghost, or no,</HI> as those twelve Disciples, <HI>Acts</HI> xix. much less had received the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Neither did it give <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Remission of Sin</HI> (for what was the Plunging of a Man in cold Water towards <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Re∣mission of Sin?</HI>) but these were the Works of Christ's own Baptism, which is the <HI>Baptism of the Spirit;</HI> for no Man can repent of Sin, but by the Presence of the Righteousness of God in his Heart, which is the Work of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is given in <HI>Christ's Baptism;</HI> neither can any re∣mit Sin, but God: Our Sins are never forgiven by God, till God dwell in us through Jesus Christ, by the Work of the Spirit; so that <HI>Repentance</HI> was given, and <HI>Sin</HI> forgiven, not in Hope only in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> but really and truly in <HI>Christ</HI>'s, which was the real Baptism of <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Remission of Sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Neither did it give Entrance into the the <HI>Kingdom of God;</HI> for the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> is a <HI>spiritual Kingdom,</HI> and no <HI>earthly</HI> or <HI>corporeal</HI> Thing can give Entrance into it: The <HI>Baptism</HI> in the Water of <HI>Jordan</HI> could deliver no Man up into the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> but the <HI>Baptism in that River that makes glad the City of God,</HI> Psal. xlvi. 4. in that <HI>River clear as Chrystal, that proceeds from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb,</HI> which is the Spirit, which delivers up all that partake of it, first, into the Kingdom of the Son, and after, through that into the Kingdom of the Father The Baptism of <HI>John</HI> left Men in that old World, wherein it found them, but the Baptism of
<PB N="19" REF="008338_0018_102F332988746208"/>Christ delivers them up into the new World, or the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now, in all these Regards, it appears that <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> did not do the Work of the <HI>Bap∣tism of the New Testament,</HI> for then that only had been sufficient, and there had been <HI>no Need</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s to come.</P>
<P>And thus you see that the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> as it is distinct from <HI>Christ</HI>'s, so it is far inferior to his. And therefore great hath been the Mistake of many, for several Ages, who have made <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> equal to <HI>Christ's;</HI> for what is this, but to make the <HI>Servant</HI> equal to the <HI>Lord,</HI> and to set down the <HI>Creature</HI> in the Throne of the only Be∣gotten of the Father? Yea, and it is the quite perverting of <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> for <HI>John</HI> was to be a <HI>burning and shining Light,</HI> to usher in Christ the <HI>true Light;</HI> he was to be as the <HI>Morning∣star,</HI> to usher in Christ, the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> and was not to be so much <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Darkness</HI> to obscure him; he was but to point out Christ, and depart again, and not to sit in equal Glory with him, on his Throne, in the New Testament. <HI>John</HI> said, <HI>he was not worthy to bear his Shoes;</HI> and therefore they do not well, who have prepared an equal Crown for him with Christ, who is <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore we must take great Heed that we do not so magnify <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> as to intrench on Christ's, and to make the Son, out of the Bosom of the Father, to take up the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> a Servant, and to administer one entirely his
<PB N="20" REF="008338_0019_102F332CB4C016E0"/>own; surely this would not have been suitable to the <HI>Glory of the only begotten Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>The third Thing I propound to speak to, touching <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> is the <HI>Time of its Dur∣ance,</HI> or <HI>Continuance,</HI> and that was but very short; for <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> as all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> was but for a Time; yea, this being nearer the Truth and Substance than they, was of less Duration; as the Morning Star, though brighter than the Rest of those heavenly Lights, shines less While than they, because the hasty Appearance of the Sun swallows it up. And so <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> was of great Use a little before Christ's Manifestation to <HI>Israel,</HI> and continued till the Time of his Ascension; and then when Christ's <HI>Baptism</HI> began, the Shadow was to give Way to the Substance, and the Sign to the Truth, and the Letter to the Spirit, and the Servant to the Son; so that Christ's <HI>Baptism</HI> put an End to <HI>John's, Free-Baptism</HI> to <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> and <HI>Spi∣rit-Baptism</HI> to <HI>Creature-Baptism:</HI> For as all the Prophets were until <HI>John,</HI> so <HI>John</HI> was until <HI>Christ;</HI> and <HI>John</HI> must no more exceed his Bounds, than <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> theirs; but as the <HI>Prophets</HI> gave up to <HI>John,</HI> so <HI>John</HI> must give up to <HI>Christ. John</HI>'s <HI>temporary Ministry</HI> had a <HI>temporary Bap∣tism;</HI> but the <HI>everlasting Gospel</HI> (which is that Word in our Flesh) hath an <HI>everlasting Baptism,</HI> which is <HI>the pouring out of the Spirit.</HI> So then, <HI>John</HI> being a <HI>Servant</HI> and <HI>Forerunner</HI> of <HI>Christ, Christ</HI> was not to take up his <HI>Baptism,</HI> but <HI>John</HI> was to resign up his <HI>Baptism</HI> to <HI>Christ;</HI> yea, and as a <HI>Servant,</HI> to deliver up all Things into his
<PB N="21" REF="008338_0020_102F332F1B141548"/>Hands, as <HI>Heir</HI> and <HI>Lord:</HI> And so <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> was to last but till <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Fire-Baptism</HI> should come in, and then the <HI>Fire</HI> should lick up the <HI>Water;</HI> and as <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> should increase, <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> should decrease. So that <HI>John's Baptism,</HI> or <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> (which is all one) be∣longs not to <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Kingdom,</HI> which is a <HI>King∣dom</HI> not of the <HI>Letter,</HI> but of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> not of <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Shadows,</HI> but of the <HI>Truth;</HI> and there∣fore we leave it where we found it, even without the <HI>Bounds</HI> and <HI>Reach</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Kingdom; for <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Baptism</HI> reached unto <HI>Christ</HI>'s Kingdom, but hath no Place in it; and to bring <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> into the Kingdom of <HI>Truth,</HI> is (if rightly understood) to act against <HI>Christ</HI> glorified.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But some will say, this is strange in∣deed, that <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> should have no Place in the Kingdom of <HI>Christ:</HI> and therefore pray stay a little, for we have many Things to object against it.</P>
<P>Object. 1. <HI>Why this should rob us of our Christ∣endom.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, No; for it is not <HI>Water,</HI> but <HI>Spi∣rit-Baptism</HI> that makes us <HI>Christians;</HI> and <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> hath been an unlawful <HI>blending</HI> or <HI>mix∣ing</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>World</HI> together; so that hitherto they could not be well <HI>differenced</HI> from each other, to the great Prejudice of the Congre∣gations of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>But have so many Ages erred, who have used</HI> Water-Baptism?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="008338_0021_102F3331D0595550"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> For the Errors of former Ages, and their great Mistakes in many of the <HI>Truths</HI> of God, I have nothing to say, but that of the Apo∣stle, <HI>How unsearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways past finding out.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 3. <HI>But you are the first Man, for ought we know, that ever opposed it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> One single mean Man, with the Word, may very justly and lawfully contradict the whole World without it; <HI>Truth</HI> is not to be judged by Multitudes, or an Unity, but by the Word.</P>
<P>Object. 4. <HI>But Christ himself was baptized with Water, and surely that perpetuates it in the Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Christ's being baptized with <HI>Water</HI> un∣der <HI>John,</HI> no more perpetuates <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> in the Christian Church, than his being <HI>circumcised</HI> under <HI>Moses,</HI> perpetuates <HI>Circumcision</HI> in the Christian Church; or his submitting to other <HI>Mo∣saical Ceremonies,</HI> perpetuates them; <HI>Christ</HI> brings no <HI>temporal</HI> or <HI>carnal</HI> Thing into his everlasting or spiritual Kingdom, though himself submitted to them under their several Dispensations in the Sea∣son of them.</P>
<P>Object. 5. <HI>But Christ justifies and commands</HI> Water-Baptism <HI>in</HI> John iii. Except a Man be born of Water, <HI>&amp;c. And</HI> Mat. xxviii. Teach and bap∣tize.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I confess these are Places that many have mistaken, to justify the Practice of <HI>Water-Baptism;</HI> but shall shew you, that they do in∣deed misunderstand them. For that first Place, John iii. 5. <HI>Except a Man be born of Water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="008338_0022_102F33342D1D7FE0"/>I confess, many of the Ancients have, by <HI>Water</HI> here, understood <HI>material Water,</HI> and have inter∣preted the Place of <HI>external Baptism,</HI> which was <HI>John</HI>'s only: And hereupon divers of them have exceedingly magnified <HI>Water,</HI> and ascribed it to the Washing of <HI>Souls,</HI> and the <HI>Regeneration</HI> of Christians in some Measure, they not considering, in the mean time, what <HI>Christ</HI> saith in the very next Verse, <HI>That which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spi∣rit;</HI> by which they might have learned, that out∣ward and corporeal Water can do nothing but outward and corporeal Things, and can con∣tribute nothing to the Cleansing of <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Con∣sciences</HI> from Sin.</P>
<P>So that this Place cannot be understood of <HI>cor∣poreal Water;</HI> and I could produce the Testimo∣nies of many godly Men, of good Note, to this Purpose, but do forbear, because I would not have <HI>our Faith</HI> built upon the Authorities of Men; but the Thing is evident from the Text itself, for it saith, <HI>Except a Man be born of</HI> Water, which shews the Water he speaks of, must be such as is able to <HI>give a new Birth,</HI> and to make a Man <HI>a∣new,</HI> that is, a spiritual, holy, heavenly Creature; and no <HI>Water</HI> can do this, but the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and therefore <HI>Christ</HI> adds to <HI>Water</HI> the <HI>Spirit,</HI> by Way of Explication; as if he had said, <HI>No Man can enter into the Kingdom of God, except he be born again of</HI> Water; but the Water I speak of is no material Water, but the Spirit, which is able to produce in us a heavenly Nature, through which only we can have an Entrance into an heavenly
<PB N="24" REF="008338_0023_102F3335BB70A108"/>Kingdom, seeing <HI>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;</HI> so that the Water Christ means in this Place is the Spirit; and many other Places give Witness to this, <HI>John</HI> iv. 10. <HI>If thou didst know who it is that saith unto thee, give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee</HI> living Water. And Verses 13, 14, <HI>Jesus said unto her, whosoever drinks of this</HI> Water (meaning the Water of the Well, called <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well) <HI>shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the</HI> Water <HI>that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the</HI> Water <HI>that I shall give him, shall be in him a</HI> Well of Water, <HI>springing up unto ever∣lasting Life.</HI> and John vii. 37, 38, 39. <HI>Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any Man</HI> thirst, <HI>let him come unto me and</HI> drink; <HI>he that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of</HI> living Water; <HI>but this spake he of the</HI> Spirit, <HI>which they that believed on him should re∣ceive.</HI></P>
<P>Now by <HI>Water,</HI> in all these Places, is not meant <HI>material Water,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as <HI>Christ</HI> himself explicates; and sure his Testimony alone is suffi∣cient.</P>
<P>But again, if in this Place, <HI>except a Man be born of Water and Spirit,</HI> you will needs under∣stand <HI>material Water;</HI> why then, upon the same Ground, you must needs understand that Place in <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>material Fire,</HI> where it is said, <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 11. <HI>He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with Fire;</HI> which is absurd to very Reason to think; but <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> in each Place, added to the <HI>Spirit,</HI> shew only the <HI>Effica∣cy</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="008338_0024_102F333AAB061190"/>of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and so you may as well bring in the Use of <HI>material Fire</HI> in Baptism, from the <HI>Text in Matthew,</HI> as of <HI>material Water,</HI> from the Text in <HI>John.</HI> So that this Place in <HI>John</HI> proves no Authority of <HI>Christ</HI> for <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> in his Kingdom, which is the Church of the New-Testament.</P>
<P>Now the other Place, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 19. <HI>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spi∣rit,</HI> is also of as little Force as the former, to prove <HI>Water-Baptism to be an Institution of Christ.</HI> Indeed I find, that where ever Men have met with the Word <HI>Baptism</HI> or <HI>baptize</HI> in the Scrip∣tures, presently their Thoughts have descended to <HI>material Water;</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not so well considering or understanding that <HI>Water,</HI> which is the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is the only <HI>Water</HI> that performs all the <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> in the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now for that Place, <HI>Go teach all Nations, bap∣tizing them,</HI> they understand it thus, <HI>teach them,</HI> and <HI>baptize them</HI> with material <HI>Water,</HI> using this Form of Words, <HI>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. But herein they err from the Mind of Christ; for by these Words Christ leads his Disciples from <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> to his own; as if he had said, <HI>John</HI> indeed baptized with Water, and ye have hitherto used his <HI>Baptism,</HI> but I shall now shortly baptize you with my own <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and from that Time I would have you <HI>go teach all Nations,</HI> and by the <HI>Ministration of the Spirit,</HI> not baptize them, or dip them in <HI>cold Water</HI> (as <HI>John</HI> did in his <HI>own Baptism,</HI> and
<PB N="26" REF="008338_0025_102F333C5322F8B8"/>you in his) but <HI>baptize</HI> them, or dip them into the <HI>Name of God the Father, Son and Spirit;</HI> and note, that he saith not here, <HI>in the Name,</HI> but, <HI>in the Name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and by the Name of God,</HI> is meant the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> of God, or <HI>God himself;</HI> as <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. <HI>Christ</HI> saith, <HI>in my Name they shall cast out Devils;</HI> that is, in my <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Virtue;</HI> so that the Sense lies thus, <HI>teach the Nations, and baptize them into the Name,</HI> &amp;c. that is, by your Ministry, which shall be of the Spirit, and not of the Letter; you shall <HI>bap∣tize</HI> them, or <HI>dip</HI> them, or <HI>interest</HI> them into the <HI>Name</HI> of God, who is the <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> as he hath discovered himself, in his last and most glorious Discovery of himself in the Gospel; you shall (I say) dip them into his Name, or sprinkle his Name upon them, that they may be <HI>holy, just, true, merciful, righteous, good,</HI> &amp;c. that is, your Ministry, after you have received the Spirit, shall have such Efficacy, that it shall clothe Men with the Name of God, and transform them into his very Nature.</P>
<P>So that this Place cannot be understood of <HI>Wa∣ter,</HI> but instead of baptizing in material Water, as <HI>John,</HI> he tells them, they should <HI>baptize into the Name of God,</HI> in such Sort, that they that were before sinful, corrupt, and evil Men, should now be taken up into the Glory of the <HI>Name</HI> of God. Neither can this Place be understood of a <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Words,</HI> which the Apostles and their Successors should use in baptizing, as most Men have thought and taught, seeing no Place of <HI>Scripture</HI> can be named, wherein the Apostles, in
<PB N="27" REF="008338_0026_102F333E07F4DD80"/>baptizing, used this Form of Words, saying, <HI>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son and Spirit,</HI> which they had undoubtedly done, if <HI>Christ</HI> had commanded it as an absolute Form. And because many will presently be ready to be enraged at this <HI>Assertion,</HI> I will a little cool their Heat with what <HI>Zuinglius</HI> saith of this Place, who was one of the greatest Enemies to the <HI>Anabap∣tists,</HI> that was in his Time; <HI>Christus Jesus</HI> (saith he) <HI>Baptismi Formulam, qua uteremur his Verbis, non instituit, quemadmodum Theologi hactenus falso tradierunt,</HI> Zuing. Lib. de Bap. P. 56. Tom. 2. Oper. that is, <HI>Jesus Christ did not in these Words institute a Form of Baptism, which we should use, as Divines have hitherto falsly taught;</HI> and he af∣firms it upon the same Ground I have mentioned before.</P>
<P>Again, if by this Place, <HI>go teach and baptize,</HI> be meant <HI>Water-Baptism, Paul</HI> did very ill observe the Command of <HI>Christ,</HI> who <HI>baptized</HI> but two or three believing Families at the most, with <HI>Wa∣ter-Baptism,</HI> and yet preached the <HI>Word</HI> in a Cir∣cuit from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Illiricum, Acts</HI> xv. 19. through many <HI>Kingdoms, Countries, Villages, People;</HI> but I say <HI>Paul,</HI> though he used not <HI>Water-Bap∣tism,</HI> yet did punctually fulfil the <HI>Command</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>did teach them, and baptize them into the Name of God.</HI> So that, no Question, there were many Churches planted in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Time, who believed in Christ, and received the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and walked in Fellowship with the <HI>Father and the Son,</HI> and with one another in the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> who never were washed at all with <HI>Water-Baptism;</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="008338_0027_102F333FC7259318"/>but <HI>Paul</HI> knew well, that no outward Thing is of any Account in the Kingdom of God; and that as <HI>Circumcision</HI> and <HI>Uncircumcision</HI> were nothing, so neither <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> nor the Want of it, were any Thing, but a <HI>new Creature is ALL;</HI> and if there be <HI>Faith</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> they are sufficient to the Kingdom of God, with∣out any outward Ceremonies whatsoever.</P>
<P>So that neither of these two Places prove any Institution of <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> of Christ, but that still remains <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> and not Christ's.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 6 The last, and that which seems the strongest <HI>Objection,</HI> is, <HI>that the Apostles practised Water-Baptism,</HI> not only before Christ's Baptism came in, but <HI>after;</HI> and this is most evident in very many Places in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer, true indeed, the Apostles did practise <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> but not from <HI>Christ,</HI> but from <HI>John,</HI> whose Baptism they took up; and an <HI>outward</HI> Ceremony of Honour and Account, is not easily and suddenly <HI>laid down;</HI> and hence some of the Apostles used Circumcision, and that after the Ascension of Christ; for Circumcision was an honourable <HI>Ceremony,</HI> used from <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Time, and so they could not (no not in the Time of the New Testament) suddenly and abruptly leave it off, but they did use it for a Time, for their Sakes who were weak, well knowing, that the <HI>Circumcision without Hands,</HI> would by Degrees put an End to the <HI>Circumcision made with Hands.</HI> For Ceremonies are best laid down, and old Cu∣stoms best laid aside, by the Essicacy of the Spi∣rit, and Power of <HI>Righteousness.</HI> And so in like
<PB N="29" REF="008338_0028_102F334339F50170"/>Manner the <HI>Apostles</HI> used the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> or <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> it having been of <HI>high Account</HI> in the Dawning of the <HI>Day</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and for the <HI>present</HI> still continuing so; but they knew that <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Fire-Baptism,</HI> would by Degrees con∣sume <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> and lick up all the Drops of it; for so <HI>John</HI> himself intimates, saying, <HI>he must increase, but I must decrease;</HI> that is, the Truth must eat out the Ceremony, and the Sub∣stance the Sign, and the more his Ministry and Baptism come in, mine shall go out; and the Mi∣nistry of the Son shall swallow up the Ministry of the Servant, as the Sun-light doth the Moon∣light; and the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> shall devour the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> and his <HI>Spirit-Baptism,</HI> by Degrees, shall put an End to my <HI>Water-Baptism;</HI> and therefore <HI>Paul</HI> (as you have heard) after he had used this Baptism twice or thrice, quite for∣bore it, and yet planted many Churches of Christ; and probably by Degrees did other Apostles too; for they knew that Christ's Baptism included <HI>John</HI>'s, and was fully sufficient of itself without it; and therefore we find <HI>Paul</HI> teaching in <HI>Christ</HI>'s King∣dom but <HI>one Baptism,</HI> and this the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit, Eph.</HI> iv. from <HI>which</HI> the Church of the New-Testament, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> was to take its Beginning, and not from outward Ele∣ments, or Water-washing.</P>
<P>Wherefore, seeing these Things are so, the <HI>A∣nabaptists</HI> have extremely mistaken, who have made their <HI>Water-washing</HI> so essential a Work of the New-Testament, that they would neither <HI>hear the Word,</HI> nor have <HI>Christian Communion</HI> with any
<PB N="30" REF="008338_0029_102F3346E60B1ED8"/>one that was not so washed; yea, though they were convinced touching them, that they had re∣ceived the <HI>Spirit;</HI> this, I say, hath been the great Error of very many honest and well meaning People, through misunderstanding the Word, to make washing with <HI>material Water</HI> so necessary a Thing in spiritual Worship; yea, and more es∣sential to the <HI>Communion of Saints,</HI> than the very <HI>Spirit itself,</HI> whom I do not therefore <HI>judge,</HI> but <HI>pity.</HI></P>
<P>And thus much for <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> which was <HI>John</HI>'s, and belonged only to that middle Mini∣stry, betwixt the Prophets and Christ.</P>
<P>Now the other <HI>Baptism</HI> I am to speak of, is <HI>Christs,</HI> which is <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Fire-Baptism;</HI> and this is the one and only <HI>Baptism</HI> of the New-Testament, as we find <HI>Paul</HI> affirming, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 6. where he saith, that in Christ's Kingdom, where is but <HI>one Body,</HI> and <HI>one Spirit,</HI> and <HI>one Hope</HI> of our Calling, and <HI>one Lord,</HI> and <HI>one Faith,</HI> there is also but <HI>one Baptism;</HI> and this is the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as the Apostle elsewhere shews, saying, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 13. <HI>For by</HI> one Spirit <HI>we are all baptized into</HI> one Body; <HI>and have been made all to drink into</HI> one Spirit.</P>
<P>Now this <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> did not go along with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> but followed it about four Years after (as you have heard) and as appears by the fore-mentioned Place of Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> i. 5. where he tells his Disciples, saying, John <HI>verily baptized with Water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy Spirit, not many Days hence;</HI> and this Pro∣mise of Christ, and of the Father, was fulfilled
<PB N="31" REF="008338_0030_102F33487A8A9668"/>at the Day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> when the Apostles being all met together, there came a <HI>Sound from Hea∣ven, as of a mighty rushing Wind, and it filled the House where they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of Fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all filled with the Spirit.</HI> Here was the <HI>first</HI> Beginning of <HI>Christ</HI>'s, or <HI>Spirit-Baptism,</HI> for it began not till after the Ascension of Christ into Heaven, and his sitting down on the Throne of God; and <HI>John</HI> the A∣postle also witnesses to this, Chap. vii. saying, <HI>the Spirit was not yet given, because Christ was not yet glorified;</HI> but as soon as he was <HI>glorified,</HI> then did he begin to baptize with the <HI>Spirit;</HI> not the Apostles only, but also the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and all Sorts of People that did believe in his Name, through the <HI>Word</HI> of the <HI>Gospel:</HI> So that then Christ's Baptism began to take Place, and to pre∣vail, as you may see, <HI>Acts</HI> viii. <HI>When the Apostles that were at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>had heard that</HI> Samaria <HI>had received the Word of God, by the Preaching of</HI> Philip, <HI>they sent unto them</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> John, <HI>who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for as yet he was fallen on none of them</HI> (only, saith the Text, they were <HI>baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> i. e. they had only been baptized with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Baptism,</HI> who only baptized with <HI>Water,</HI> saying, that they should believe on <HI>Christ that was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me after;</HI> for <HI>John's</HI> Baptism was yet usual, in as much as <HI>Christ</HI>'s Baptism was but new begun.) <HI>Then did the Apostles lay their Hands on them, and they re∣ceived the Holy Spirit;</HI> so that here now was the
<PB N="32" REF="008338_0031_102F334A205C9778"/><HI>Progress</HI> of <HI>Spirit-Baptism.</HI> And after, when <HI>Peter</HI> preached to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and his Family and Friends, the holy <HI>Spirit fell upon them,</HI> Acts x. And <HI>Peter</HI> gives this Account to those of the <HI>Circumcision</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Acts xi. 15. <HI>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on</HI> them <HI>as on</HI> us <HI>at the Beginning;</HI> then <HI>remembered I the Word of the Lord, how that he said,</HI> John <HI>indeed bap∣tized with Water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;</HI> so that <HI>Peter</HI> evidently declares the Gift of the Spirit, by the Ministry of the Gospel, to be the <HI>Baptism of Christ,</HI> or the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> which Christ promised at his Ascension into Heaven.</P>
<P>And this is the <HI>only Baptism</HI> wherein all the Church of the <HI>New-Testament</HI> are to partake with Christ, I say, not the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> but of the <HI>Spirit; he</HI> and <HI>we</HI> drinking into one <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the same <HI>Spirit</HI> descending on us as it did on him. The pouring out of the <HI>Spirit</HI> on the Flesh of Christ, was his <HI>New-Testament Baptism,</HI> and it is ours too; and all our <HI>true</HI> and <HI>sound Comfort</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> lies in this, that we are <HI>baptised</HI> with the <HI>same Spirit</HI> that he was; for it would be as little spiritual Comfort to be dipped in the <HI>same Water</HI> with Christ, as to eat with him at the <HI>same Table,</HI> or to drink with him in the <HI>same Cup,</HI> or to go along with him in the <HI>same Ship,</HI> as <HI>Judas</HI> did, and divers of the <HI>unbelieving Jews;</HI> but to drink with him in <HI>one Spirit,</HI> is to partake of <HI>one Flesh</HI> with him, and to be <HI>one Christ</HI> with him; and this is a Comfort indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="008338_0032_102F334C8622F410"/>
Now the outward Instrument of Christ's, or Spirit-Baptism, is not material Water, but the Word, as Christ shews, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. where he saith, <HI>teach and baptize,</HI> shewing that <HI>teaching the Word,</HI> is the outward Means of <HI>baptizing</HI> with the <HI>Spirit.</HI> And again, <HI>John</HI> xvii. <HI>Now are you clean through the Word,</HI> not which <HI>Moses,</HI> but <HI>which I have spoken to you</HI> (and therefore is the <HI>Gospel</HI> called the <HI>Ministration</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> be∣cause it proceeds from the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and communi∣cates the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and Christ baptizes with the <HI>Spirit,</HI> through the <HI>Ministration of the Spirit,</HI> which is the Preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI>) and <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 26. <HI>Christ gave himself for his Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, with the Washing of Water by the</HI> Word; that is, <HI>Christ</HI> cleanses his <HI>Church</HI> by <HI>such</HI> a Washing of <HI>Water,</HI> as is brought about by the <HI>Word</HI> and the <HI>Water</HI> with which the <HI>Word</HI> washes in the <HI>Spirit;</HI> for by the <HI>Word</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> is given; and the <HI>Word</HI> cleanses by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> by the <HI>Word;</HI> and there∣fore it is also said, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 1. <HI>Having these</HI> Pro∣mises, <HI>let us cleanse ourselves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>From all this it appears, that <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> is not to be performed by Water, but by the Word; and no Man, under the New-Testament, receives the Spirit through the Baptism of Water, but through the Ministry of the New-Testament, which is the only <HI>Ministration of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude; this <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> that is performed only by the <HI>Word,</HI> is that <HI>Baptism</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="008338_0033_102F3350A3477E80"/>of which so many excellent Things are spoken in the New-Testament; as,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. This <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> gives a <HI>new Na∣ture,</HI> and this <HI>Nature</HI> is a <HI>divine Nature,</HI> or the <HI>Nature of God;</HI> and hence it is said, <HI>except a Man be born of Water, and the Spirit;</HI> so that the <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> gives a <HI>new Birth,</HI> and so a <HI>new Nature.</HI> And again, <HI>that which is born of the Spirit, it Spirit;</HI> so that the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spi∣rit</HI> makes us <HI>Spirit,</HI> and through the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> we become that which the <HI>Spirit itself is;</HI> and so the true Foundation of Christianity, begins from <HI>Faith</HI> and a <HI>new Creature,</HI> and not from <HI>Water-washing.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This <HI>Baptism</HI> gives a <HI>new Name,</HI> not <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Thomas,</HI> &amp;c. but as Christ saith, <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 12. <HI>I will write upon him, my new Name:</HI> Our own Name is <HI>Sin,</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>In∣justice,</HI> and <HI>Envy,</HI> and <HI>Covetousness,</HI> and <HI>Unclean∣ness,</HI> and <HI>all Evil;</HI> and this is the Name which the first <HI>Adam</HI> wrote upon; but the Name the se∣cond <HI>Adam</HI> writes on us, is <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Ho∣liness,</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Meekness,</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>all Good,</HI> and this the Name the se∣cond <HI>Adam</HI> writes on us, or his own new Name; for Christ himself was baptized by the <HI>Spirit</HI> in∣to the <HI>Name of God;</HI> that is, was taken up into God, and the <HI>Things of God,</HI> which are <HI>himself,</HI> as into the <HI>Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Mercy, Pow∣er,</HI> &amp;c. and all the whole <HI>Flesh</HI> or <HI>Humanity</HI> of Christ, even all his <HI>Members</HI> are baptized into the same Name of God with him, and so are called by his new Name; so that this Name of
<PB N="35" REF="008338_0034_102F3350A3477E80"/>Christ, this new Name which is given us by God through the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is infinitely better than that Name which is given us by <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> or <HI>God-fathers,</HI> in <HI>Water-Baptism.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Baptism</HI> translates us into a new World: <HI>Except a Man be born of that Water which is the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> No Man can possibly enter into the <HI>Church</HI> of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> which is the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> but through the Baptism of the Spirit; the Baptism of the Spirit makes a <HI>new Creature,</HI> and this <HI>new Creature</HI> enters into a <HI>new World,</HI> which is the <HI>new Jerusalem,</HI> that comes down from God out of Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> enables us to the same Work with Christ; that is, to the Ministry of the New-Testament, saith Christ, <HI>the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach</HI> Isa. lxi. 1. And he began his Ministry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Spirit-Baptism,</HI> which, did immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <HI>Wa∣ter-Baptism,</HI> but was in no Sort <HI>one Baptism</HI> with it; and having, through the Opening the Hea∣vens, received the Spirit which taught him the <HI>Name of God,</HI> he presently began to teach the <HI>Name of God</HI> to others; and Christ himself was not a Minister of the New-Testament but thro' the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> Now all Believers that are anointed with him in his <HI>Unction,</HI> or which is all one, are <HI>baptized</HI> with him in <HI>one Baptism</HI> of <HI>Spirit,</HI> are anointed and <HI>baptized</HI> to the same Mi∣nistry; for the Anointing of the Spirit, is the Teaching of God, and they that are taught of God themselves, ought also to teach others; and the
<PB N="36" REF="008338_0035_102F3354E345CCE8"/><HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ is the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Prophecy, and they that have received that <HI>Spirit</HI> must prophe∣cy, as it is written, <HI>it shall come to pass in the last Days, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, and your Sons and Daughters shall prophecy;</HI> which very Place <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> ii. applies to the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> so that this <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> of Christ makes all Prophets, that partake of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> makes all those one with Christ the Head, who partake of it, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 27. <HI>As many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ;</HI> so that by the true <HI>Baptism</HI> of the New-Testament, we do actually put on Christ, and are made one with Christ; and this is not done by any Water-washing, but by the <HI>Spirit;</HI> for through the Gift of the <HI>Spirit</HI> only are we made one Flesh with Christ; yea, through this we ne∣cessarily become one <HI>Spirit</HI> with him too, as it is said, <HI>he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit;</HI> so that not through <HI>Water,</HI> but <HI>Spirit-Baptism,</HI> do we put on Christ, the <HI>Spirit</HI> carrying us into Christ, and bringing Christ into us, and being one and the same <HI>Spirit</HI> in both; and this is to be baptized into Christ.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Now this <HI>Baptism</HI> that makes us one with Christ, makes us to partake both of his <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Through Baptism of the Spirit,</HI> we are dipt into the Death of Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 3, 4. <HI>Know ye not that so many of us as are baptized into Jesus Christ, are baptized into his Death?</HI> And this is, as the Apostle unfolds it, Verse 6. <HI>The crucifying of the old Man with him, that the Body of Sin may
<PB N="37" REF="008338_0036_102F33567AF235C0"/>be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve Sin.</HI> And all this is done, not through any <HI>Water-wash,</HI> but through the <HI>Gift of the Spirit;</HI> for it is through the <HI>Spirit</HI> only, that we are able to <HI>mor∣tify the Deeds of the Flesh;</HI> and nothing but the Presence of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in us is the <HI>Destruction of Sin;</HI> so that the Spirit of Christ baptizes us into the Death of Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> makes us partake of his <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> as well as of his <HI>Death,</HI> yea, there∣fore do we die with him, that we may live a bet∣ter Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 3, 4. <HI>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptism</HI> (that is, <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI>) <HI>in∣to Death, that like as Christ was raised up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father,</HI> i. e. the Spirit, <HI>so should we also live in Newness of Life; for if we have been planted together in the Likeness of his Death, we shall be also in the Likeness of his Re∣surrection.</HI> Where you see the same <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> that makes us <HI>die</HI> with Christ, doth al∣so quicken us into his <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and depriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us of our own Life; not that we remain <HI>dead,</HI> but that it may communicate to us a better Life than our own, even the <HI>Life of Christ</HI> himself, that we that are Men may live the very Life of the <HI>Son of God</HI> in our own Souls and Bodies, and may be quickened with him, and raised up with him, and set in heavenly Places in him.</P>
<P N="6">6. As <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> makes us one with <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>Head,</HI> so with the <HI>Church</HI> the <HI>Body,</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 13. <HI>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body, whether we be</HI> Jews <HI>or</HI> Gentiles, <HI>whether we be</HI> bond <HI>or</HI> free, <HI>and have been all made to drink
<PB N="38" REF="008338_0037_102F335A92749FE8"/>into one Spirit;</HI> so that by drinking into one <HI>Spi∣rit</HI> with the <HI>Church,</HI> we become one <HI>Body</HI> with it, and no otherwise; I say, not by being dipt into the <HI>same Water,</HI> but by receiving the <HI>same Spirit</HI> do we become <HI>one Body</HI> with the <HI>Church;</HI> and it is not being of <HI>one Judgment,</HI> or <HI>Opinion,</HI> or <HI>Form,</HI> or the like, that makes Men one <HI>true. Church</HI> or <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> but the being of <HI>one Spirit;</HI> and there are no more of that <HI>Church,</HI> which is the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> than they that are baptized with that <HI>one Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Spirit-Baptism,</HI> it truly washes and cleanses from Sin; what <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> doth in the Sign, this doth in the Truth, even cleanses from all carnal and spiritual Filthiness; and no Man is cleansed from <HI>Sin,</HI> but by the <HI>Washing</HI> of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> the pouring forth of the Spirit on all Flesh, is the killing of <HI>Sin</HI> in all <HI>Flesh,</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10, 11. <HI>Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adul∣terers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunk∣ards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God; and such were some of you, but ye are</HI> washed, <HI>but ye are</HI> sanctified <HI>in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God:</HI> So that <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> cleanses from all <HI>Sin</HI> whatever it is, and there is no Man clean∣sed from <HI>Sin,</HI> but through this <HI>Baptism.</HI></P>
<P>And again, <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 26, 27. <HI>Christ gave him∣self for the Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the Washing of Water by the Word, that he might present it to himself, a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any such Thing, but
<PB N="39" REF="008338_0038_102F17B9D3C3EBD8"/>that it should be holy, and without Blemish;</HI> and nothing doth thus purify the Church, till it be without <HI>Spot, Wrinkle</HI> or <HI>Blemish,</HI> and till it be perfectly holy, but the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> And therefore, though the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John</HI> was administred but once, yet the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> is a continued <HI>Baptism;</HI> for as long as Corruption is in the Flesh, the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> is in Use; so that the Nature and Life of a <HI>Christian</HI> are un∣der a constant and continual <HI>Baptism,</HI> God every Day pouring forth his <HI>Spirit</HI> upon a Believer, for the <HI>purifying</HI> and <HI>sanctifying</HI> of him, and mak∣ing him meet for the <HI>immediate Presence of God,</HI> whither no <HI>unclean Thing</HI> comes, nor the <HI>least Uncleanness</HI> in any <HI>Thing.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> saves: Whatever in us is washed with the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is saved as well as sancti∣fied; and how much any one hath received of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> so much is he already saved, <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5. <HI>According to his Mercy he hath saved us by the Washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the ho∣ly Spirit, which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:</HI> Where the Apostle teaches us how God saves, and that is not by <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Batpism,</HI> or <HI>Water-washing,</HI> but by the <HI>Laver</HI> of <HI>Regeneration;</HI> which is the renewing of the holy Spirit, poured on us abundantly thro' Christ; so that he calls the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Laver</HI> of <HI>Regeneration;</HI> such a Laver that re∣news the old Nature; yea, and begets a new one; so that a Man through this <HI>Baptism</HI> is wholly changed, not in a few good Works, but in his whole Nature; and from his Newness of Na∣ture
<PB N="40" REF="008338_0039_102F335E919F4AA0"/>flows Newness of Life; so that he is no more as he was, but is, and lives, and loves, and thinks, and speaks, and acts otherwise than he was wont, and this cannot be the Work of Water in any Measure, but wholly of the Spirit, for where Men are destitute of the Spirit, though washed with Water a thousand Times, there is no Change of Nature in them; but the Change of Nature, wrought by <HI>Spirit-Baptism,</HI> is so much present Salvation, even in this present World. There is another Scripture witnesses the same Thing, and it is 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 20, 21. <HI>A Few (that is, eight Souls) were saved by Water, to which Figure Bap∣tism answering, doth now also save us, not that whereby the Filth of the Flesh is cast away, but whereby a good Conscience answers well to God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, Peter</HI> having said, that Baptism answers to the Flood, and saves the <HI>Church</HI> now, as the Flood did the <HI>Church</HI> then; yea, saith he, but I mean not the outward Bap∣tism, or the Washing away of the Filth of the Body, but the <HI>Answer of</HI> a <HI>good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ:</HI> Which Place is difficult; but I thus conceive it, the Ef∣ficacy of Christ's Resurrection is the Gift of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in a Believer, rectifies his Conscience, and makes it good, so that it can return a sweet Answer to God upon every Word of his; for the Work of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the Heart answers every Word of Faith spoken from God; particularly it can say to God, I was indeed filthy and unclean throughout, but I am now washed, and justified, and sanctified in the
<PB N="41" REF="008338_0040_102F33620C9B2088"/>Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of my <HI>God;</HI> and this <HI>Spirit-Baptism</HI> is that that saves, and not the <HI>Water,</HI> which puts away the Filth of the Flesh only, but leaves the Filth of the Spirit as much as ever.</P>
<P>So that, in this Place, <HI>Peter</HI> puts an End to Baptism in the Flesh, as <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> ii. 28. puts an End to Circumcision in the Flesh, saying, <HI>He is not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that Circumcision which is outward in the Flesh; but he is a Jew that is one inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whose Praise is not of Men, but of God;</HI> that is, saith <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Kingdom of Christ, where all Things are spiritual; Circumcision in the Spirit puts an End to Circumcision in the Flesh; and in the same Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> saith <HI>Peter,</HI> Baptism in the Spirit puts an End to Bap∣tism in the Flesh; for he is not a <HI>Christian,</HI> who is one outwardly, neither is that Baptism which is outward in the Flesh; but he is a <HI>Christian</HI> who is one inwardly, and Baptism is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whose Praise also is not of Men, but of <HI>God.</HI> For under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is the Ministration of the Spirit (as ye have been often minded) we can find nothing among all outward Things, through the Use and Exercise whereof we may attain the Cleanness and Purity of <HI>Righteousness</HI> in our Natures; and therefore <HI>Christ</HI> hath put an End to all outward, carnal and earthly Things of the first Testament, by the inward, and spiritual, and heavenly <HI>Things</HI> of a second, and better, Testament; and by his
<PB N="42" REF="008338_0041_102F33646AF17820"/>own Death and Resurrection only, not without us, but within us, through the Power and Effi∣cacy of his Spirit, all the Baptism of the New-Testament is fully and perfectly performed.</P>
<P>And thus, in all these Particulars, you see the infinite Excellency and Glory of the <HI>Spirit-Bap∣tism</HI> above <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> and this only is suffi∣cient in the Days of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> as being the true and proper <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>New-Testament;</HI> for as <HI>Christ</HI> himself only is sufficient to the Faithful without <HI>John,</HI> though <HI>John</HI> were of Use in this Sea∣son, to point out <HI>Christ,</HI> so the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> only is sufficient to the Faithful, without the <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> though the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>John</HI> were of Use in its Season, to point out the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> and the <HI>Baptist</HI> himself was of this Judg∣ment, who said to Christ, <HI>I have Need to be bap∣tized of thee;</HI> which he means not of <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> (for so <HI>Christ</HI> himself, as you have heard, <HI>did not baptize</HI>) but with the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> and so the <HI>Baptist</HI> himself, who was never baptized with <HI>Water,</HI> neither by Christ nor the A∣postles, nor any Body else, yet was baptized with the Spirit; and the Baptism of the Spirit was suf∣ficient for the <HI>Baptist,</HI> without any Water-Bap∣tism; and so Christ's Spirit-Baptism, by the Word, is sufficient for all the Faithful now, with∣out <HI>John</HI>'s Water-Baptism; for he that is truly washed from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and hath the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in him, to renew his Nature, and to conform him exactly to Christ's own Image, and to work him in this present World into the true Similitude of Heaven, and
<PB N="43" REF="008338_0042_102F3366CAE67B48"/>to be in him a <HI>Fountain of Water springing up unto everlasting Life;</HI> what Need hath he of cold material Water to be poured on his Body, under the Pretence of any Sign whatever, either of <HI>Moses</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> when as he hath the Truth, Sub∣stance, and heavenly Thing itself?</P>
<P>Now this, it may be, may seem strange and dangerous to some of low, and fleshly, and cus∣tomary Religion, but let all such (if it be possible) consider, that where the Substance comes the Shadow is at an End, and the Ceremony where the Truth comes, and the Creature where <HI>God</HI> comes: And if they understand not this for the present, I hope they may understand it afterwards, for we speak not at Uncertainties in this Point, but what we have in some Measure seen, and felt, and <HI>handled of the Word of Life, that we deliver to you, that ye may have Fellowship with us; and truly our Fellowship is with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ,</HI> through the Spirit.</P>
