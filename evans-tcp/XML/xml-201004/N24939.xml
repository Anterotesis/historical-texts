<HEAD>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE <HI>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</HI> IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have con∣nected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which im∣pel them to the separation.</P>
<P>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are en∣dowed by their Creator with certain unaliena∣ble rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to se∣cure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
<PB N="6" REF="033044_0004_0FF62CCFD61FFC78"/>principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to ef∣fect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all ex∣perience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute des∣potism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colo∣nies; and such is now the necessity which con∣strains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great-Britain is a history of repeat∣ed injuries and usurpations, all having in di∣rect object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.</P>
<P>He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his Governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people,
<PB N="7" REF="033044_0005_0FF62CD204710620"/>unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them, and formidable to ty∣rants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</P>
<P>He has dissolved Representative Houses re∣peatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the danger of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the popu∣lation of these States; for that purpose ob∣structing the laws for naturalization of for∣eigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the con∣ditions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>He has obstructed the administration of jus∣tice, by refusing his assent to laws for estab∣lishing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made Judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033044_0006_0FF62CD4196DC018"/>
He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military in∣dependent of and superior to the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For imposing taxes on us without our con∣sent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many cases, of the ben∣efits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarg∣ing its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering funda∣mentally the forms of our governments:</P>
<P>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033044_0007_0FF62CD60704E000"/>
He has abdicated government here, by de∣claring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.</P>
<P>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is at this time, transporting large ar∣mies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, al∣ready begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barba∣rous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has constrained our fellow citizens, ta∣ken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the execu∣tioners of their friends and brethren, or to tall themselves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</P>
<P>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress, in the most humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been an∣swered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of attempts by their
<PB N="10" REF="033044_0008_0FF62CD8C1FE0E38"/>legislature to extend an unwarrantable juris∣diction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and set∣tlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connexions and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consan∣guinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of man∣kind, enemies in war; in peace, friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, Do, in the name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, <HI>Free and Independent States;</HI> that they are absolved from all allegiance to the <HI>British Crown,</HI> and that all political con∣nexion between them and the State of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is, and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as <HI>Free and Independent States,</HI> they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which <HI>Inde∣pendent States</HI> may of right do. And for the
<PB N="11" REF="033044_0009_0FF62CDACDEB7230"/>support of this Declaration, with a firm reli∣ance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honour.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Signed by order and in behalf of the CONGRESS. JOHN HANCOCK, President. Attested. CHARLES THOMSON, Secretary.

<P>ART. II. Each State retains its sovereignty, free∣dom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.</P>
<P>ART. III. The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defence, the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare; binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretence whatever.</P>
<P>ART. IV. The better to secure and perpetuate mu∣tual friendship and intercouse among the people of the different States in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these States, (paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted,) shall be entitled to all privileges and im∣munities of free citizens in the several States; and the people of each State shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other State, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same du∣ties, impositions and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restriction shall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any State to any other State, of which the owner is an inhabitant; <HI>provided also,</HI> that no imposition, duties or
<PB N="14" REF="033044_0012_0FF62CE140FE8058"/>restriction shall be laid by any State on the property of the United States, or either of them.</P>
<P>If any person guilty of or charged with treason, felony or other high misdemeanor in any State, shall flee from justice and be found in any of the United States, he shall, upon demand of the Governor or executive power of the State from which he fled, be delivered up and removed to the State having jurisdiction of his offence.</P>
<P>Full faith and credit shall be given in each of these States to the records, acts and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other State.</P>
<P>ART. V. For the more convenient management of the general interests of the United States, delegates shall be annually appointed, in such manner as the legisla∣ture of each State shall direct, to meet in Congress on the first Monday in <HI>November,</HI> in every year, with a power reserved to each State to recal its delegates or any of them, at any time within the year, and to send others in their stead, for the remainder of the year.</P>
<P>No State shall be represented in Congress by less than two, nor by more than seven members; and no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years; nor shall any person, being a delegate, be capable of holding any office under the Uni∣ted States, for which he, or any other for his benefit, receives any salary, fees or emolument of any kind.</P>
<P>Each State shall maintain its own delegates in any meet∣ing of the States, and while they act as members of the committee of the States.</P>
<P>In determining questions in the United States in Con∣gress assembled, each State shall have one vote.</P>
<P>Freedom of speech and debate in Congress shall not be im∣peached or questioned in any court or place out of Con∣gress; and the members of Congress shall be protected in their persons from arrests and imprisonments, during the time of their going to and from, and attendance on Con∣gress, except for treason, felony or breach of the peace.</P>
<P>ART. VI. No State, without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled, shall send any em∣bassy to, or receive any embassy from, or enter into any conference, agreement, alliance or treaty with any King.
<PB N="15" REF="033044_0013_0FF62CE346BFEF90"/>Prince or State; nor shall any person holding any office of profit or trust under the United States, or any of them, accept of any present, emolument, office or title of any kind whatever from any King, Prince or foreign State; nor shall the United States in Congress assembled, or any of them, grant any title of nobility.</P>
<P>No two or more States shall enter into any treaty, confed∣eration or alliance whatever between them, without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled, speci∣fying accurately the purpose for which the same is to be entered into, and how long it shall continue.</P>
<P>No State shall lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y imposts or duties, which may in∣terfere with any stipu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tions in treaties entered into by the United States in Congress assembled, with any King, Prince or State, in pursuance of any treaties already pro∣posed by Congress to the Courts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>No vessels of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only as shall be deemed ne∣cessary by the United States in Congress assembled, for the defence of such State or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only as, in the judgment of the United States in Congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defence of such State; but ev∣ery State shall always keep up a well regulated and disci∣plined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutred, and shall provide and have constantly ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quan∣tity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.</P>
<P>No State shall engage in any war without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled, unless such State be actually invaded by enemies, or shall have certain advice of a resolution being formed by some nation of In∣dians to invade such State, and the danger is so imminent as not to admit of a delay, till the United States in Con∣gress assembled can be consulted; nor shall any State grant commissions to any ships or vessels of war, nor letters of marque or reprisal, except it be after a declaration of war by the United States in Congress assembled, and then only against the kingdom or State and the subjects thereof against which war has been so declared, and under such
<PB N="16" REF="033044_0014_0FF62CE4D7A70DC0"/>regulations as shall be established by the United States in Congress assembled, unless such State be infested by pirates, in which case vessels of war may be sitted out for that occa∣sion and kept so long as the danger shall continue, or until the United States in Congress assembled shall determine otherwise.</P>
<P>ART. VII. When land forces are raised by any State for the common defence, all officers of or under the rank of Colonel shall be appointed by the legislature of each State respectively, by whom such forces shall be raised, or in such manner as such State shall direct; and all va∣cancies shall be filled up by the State which first made the appointment.</P>
<P>ART. VIII. All charges of war and all other ex∣penses that shall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in Con∣gress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common treasu∣ry, which shall be supplied by the several States in pro∣portion to the value of all land within each State, granted to or surveyed for any person, as such land and the build∣ings and improvements thereon shall be estimated, accord∣ing to such mode as the United States in Congress assem∣bled shall from time to time direct and appoint.</P>
<P>The taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of the legislatures of the several States, within the time agreed upon by the United States in Congress assembled.</P>
<P>ART. IX. The United States in Congress assem∣bled shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, except in the cases mention∣ed in the sixth article—of sending and receiving ambassa∣dors—entering into treaties and alliances, <HI>provided,</HI> that no treaty of commerce shall be made, whereby the legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained from im∣posing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever—of establishing rules for deciding, in all cases, what captures on land or water shall be legal, and in what manner prizes taken by land or naval forces in the service of the United States shall be divided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ropriated—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="17" REF="033044_0015_0FF62CE6E3981B38"/>granting letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace—appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and establishing courts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of captures; <HI>provided,</HI> that no member of Congress shall be appointed judge of any of the said courts.</P>
<P>The United States in Congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting, or that hereafter may arise between two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever; which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following:—Whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of any State in controversy with another shall present a petition to Congress, stating the matter in question and praying for a hearing, notice there∣of shall be given by order of Congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other State in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question: but if they cannot agree, Congress shall name three persons out of each of the United States, and from the lift of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one, the pe∣tioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven nor more than nine names, as Congress shall direct, shall in the presence of Congress be drawn out by lot; and the persons whose names shall be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges to hear and finally deter∣mine the controversy, so always as a major part of the judges, who shall hear the cause, shall agree in the deter∣mination; and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without shewing reasons which Congress shall judge sufficient, or being present shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each State, and the Secretary of Congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence of the court to be appointed in the manner before prescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such
<PB N="18" REF="033044_0016_0FF62CEA048DF848"/>court, or to appear or defend their claim o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence or judgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive, the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to Congress, and lodged among the acts of Congress for the security of the parties concerned: <HI>Provided,</HI> That every commissioner, before he sits in judg∣ment, shall take an oath, to be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the State where the cause shall be tried, "well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question, according to the best of his judgment, without favour, affection or hope of re∣ward:" <HI>Provided also,</HI> That no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States.</P>
<P>All controversies concerning the private right of soil, claimed under different grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions as they may respect such lands and the States which passed such grants are adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time claimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement or jurisdiction, shall, on the petition of either party to the Congress of the United States, be finally determined as near as may be, in the same manner as is before prescribed for deciding dis∣putes respecting territorial jurisdiction between different States.</P>
<P>The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective States—fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United States—reg∣ulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians not members of any of the States; <HI>provided,</HI> that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violated—establishing and regulating post-of∣fices from one State to another throughout all the United States, and exacting such postage on the papers passing through the same as may be requisite to defray the ex∣pens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the said office—appointing all officers of the land forces in the service of the United States, excepting regi∣mental officers—appointing all the officers of the naval forces, and commissioning all officers whatever in the ser∣vice
<PB N="19" REF="033044_0017_0FF62CEB92722EE8"/>of the United States—making rules for the govern∣ment and regulation of the said land and naval forces, and directing their operations.</P>
<P>The United States in Congress assembled shall have au∣thority to appoint a committee to fit in the recess of Con∣gress, to be denominated "a committee of the States," and to consist of one delegate from each State, and to ap∣point such other committees and civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the United States, under their direction—to appoint one of their num∣ber to preside, <HI>provided</HI> that no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of three years—to ascertain the necessary sums of money to be raised for the service of the United States, and to appropriate and apply the same for defraying the public ex∣penses—to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the United States, transmitting every half year to the re∣spective States an account of the sums of money so borrow∣ed or emitted—to build and equip a navy—to agree upon the number of land forces, and to make requisitions from each State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in such State; which requisition shall be binding, and thereupon the legislature of each State shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, and clothe, arm and equip them in a soldier-like manner, at the ex∣pense of the United States; and the officers and men so clothed, armed and equipped, shall march to the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled: But if the United States in Congress assembled shall, on consideration of circum∣stances, judge proper that any State should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number than its quota, and that any other State should raise a greater number of men than the quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised, of∣ficered, clothed, armed and equipped in the same manner as the quota of such State, unless the legislature of such State shall judge that such extra number cannot be safely spared out of the same; in which case they shall raise, officer, clothe, arm and equip as many of such extra number as they judge can be safely spared.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now the honour to submit to the consid∣eration of the United States in Congress assem∣bled, that Constitution which has appeared to us the most adviseable. The friends of our Country have long seen and desired, that the power of making war, peace and treaties, that of levying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ney and regulating commerce, and the correspondent Executive and Judicial authorities, should be fully and effectually vested in the general gov∣ernment of the Union; but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trusts to one body of men is evident— Hence results the necessity of a different organization.</P>
<P>It is obviously impracticable in the federal government of these States, to secure all rights of independent sov∣ereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all—Individuals entering into society, must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circum∣stance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision, the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be reserved; and on the present occasion, this difficulty was increased by a difference among the several States as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests.</P>
<P>In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, per∣haps our national existence. This important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of infe∣rior magnitude than might have been otherwise expected; and thus the Constitution which we now present, is the re∣sult of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.</P>
<P>That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will
<PB N="46" REF="033044_0044_0FF62D26B55F4CB0"/>doubtless consider, that had her interests been alone con∣sulted, the consequences might have been particularly dis∣agreeable or injurious to others; that it is liable to as few exceptions as could reasonably have been expected, we hope and believe; that it may promote the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all, and secure her freedom and happiness, is our most ardent with.</P>
<P>With great respect, we have the honour to be, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient, and humble servants.</P>

<P>N. B. By the returns made into the Secretary of State's office, it appears that the first article of the above amendments is agreed to by only seven States—the second by only four—and therefore these are not obligatory. All the remainder, having been ratified by nine States, are of equal obligation with the Constitution itself.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>NEW-HAMPSHIRE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> BILL OF RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>ARTICLE I.</P>
<P>ALL men are born equally free and independent; therefore all government of right originates from the people, is founded in consent, and instituted for the general good.</P>
<P N="2">2. All men have certain natural, essential and inherent rights—among which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty, acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, possessing and protecting property; and in a word, of seeking and obtaining happiness.</P>
<P N="3">3. When men enter into a state of society, they surren∣der up some of their natural rights to that society, in order to insure the protection of others; and without such an equivalent, the surrender is void.</P>
<P N="4">4. Among the natural rights, some are in their very nature unalienable; because no equivalent can be given or received for them: Of this kind are the <HI>Rights of Con∣science.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own con∣science and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worship∣ping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience, or for his religious profes∣sion, sentiments, or persuasion; provided he doth not dis∣turb the public peace or disturb others in their religious worship.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="51" REF="033044_0049_0FF62D33A2655028"/>
6. As morality and piety, rightly grounded on evangel∣ical principles, will give the best and greatest security to government, and will lay in the hearts of men, the strong∣est obligations to due subjection; and as the knowledge of these is most likely to be propagated through a society, by the institution of the public worship of the Deity, and of public instruction in morality and religion; therefore, to promote those important purposes, the people of this State have a right to empower, and do hereby fully empower the Legislature, to authorise, from time to time, the seve∣ral towns, parishes, bodies corporate or religious societies, within this State, to make adequate provision, at their own expense, for the support and maintenance of public Prot∣est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt teachers of piety, religion and morality.</P>
<P><HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vided notwithstanding,</HI> That the several towns, pa∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, bodies corporate, or religious societies, shall at all times have the exclusive right of electing their own public teachers, and of contracting with them for their support and maintenance. And no person of any one particular religious sect or denomination, shall ever be compelled to pay towards the support of the teacher or teachers of another persuasion, sect or denomination.</P>
<P>And every denomination of Christians, demeaning them∣selves quietly, and as good subjects of the State, shall be equally under the protection of the law: And to subor∣dination of any one sect or denomination to another, shall ever be established by law.</P>
<P>And nothing herein shall be und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stood to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct any former contracts made for the support of the ministry; but all such contracts shall remain, and be in the same state as if this Constitution had not been made.</P>
<P N="7">7. The people of this State have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free, sovereign and in∣dependent State; and do, and forever hereafter shall ex∣ercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction and right, per∣taining thereto, which is not, or may not hereafter be by them expressly delegated to the United States of America in Congress assembled.</P>
<P N="8">8. All power residing originally in, and being derived from the people, all the magistrates and officers of govern∣ment are their substitutes and agents, and at all times ac∣countable to them.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="52" REF="033044_0050_0FF62D36099C9A10"/>
9. No office or place whatsoever in government, shall be hereditary—the abilities and integrity requisite in all, not being transmissible to posterity or relations.</P>
<P N="10">10. Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the whole community, and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family, or class of men; therefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty man∣ifestly endang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l other means of redress are in∣effectual, the people may and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.</P>
<P N="11">11. All elections ought to be free, and every inhabit∣ant of the State, having the proper qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ications, has equal right to elect and be elected into office.</P>
<P N="12">12. Every member of the community has a right to be protected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property; he is therefore bound to contribute his share in the expense of such protection, and to yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent. But no part of a man's property shall be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of the rep∣resentative body of the people. Nor are the inhabitants of this State controllable by any other laws than those to which they, or their representative body, have given their consent.</P>
<P N="13">13. No person, who is conscientiously scrupulous about the lawfulness of bearing arms, shall be compelled thereto, provided he will pay an equivalent.</P>
<P N="14">14. Every subject of this State is entitled to a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries he may receive in his person, property, or character; to obtain right and justice freely, without being obliged to purchase it; completely and without any denial; promptly and without delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="15">15. No subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, sabit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly and formally described to him; or be compelied to acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se or furnish evidence against himself. And every subject
<PB N="53" REF="033044_0051_0FF62D3796486050"/>shall have a right to produce all proofs that may be fa∣vourable to himself; to meet the witnesses against him, face to face; and to be fully heard in his defence, by him∣self and counsel. And no subject shall be arrested, im∣prisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his property, immuni∣ties, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, ex∣iled or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P N="16">16. No subject shall be liable to be tried, after an ac∣quittal, for the same crime or offence. Nor shall the Le∣gislature make any law that shall subject any person to a capital punishment (excepting for the government of the army and navy, and the militia in actual service) without trial by Jury.</P>
<P N="17">17. In criminal prosecutions, the trial of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is so essential to the security of the life, liberty, and estate of the citizen, that no crime or offence ought to be tried in any other county than that in which it is committed: except in cases of general in∣surrection in any particular county, when it shall appear to the Judges of the Superior Court, that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the offence may be committed, and upon their report, the Legislature shall think proper to direct the trial in the nearest county in which an impartial trial can be obtained.</P>
<P N="18">18. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the na∣ture of the offence. No wise Legislature will affix the same punishment to the crimes of theft, forgery and the like, which they do to those of murder and treason; where the same undistinguishing severity is exerted against all offences, the people are led to forget the real distinction in the crimes themselves, and to commit the most flagrant with as little compunction as they do the lightest offences: For the same reason a multitude of sanguinary laws is both impolitic and unjust; the true design of all punishments being to reform, not to exterminate mankind</P>
<P N="19">19. Every subject hath a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. Therefore, all warrants to search suspected places, or arrest a person for examina∣tion or trial, in prosecutions for criminal matters, are con∣trary
<PB N="54" REF="033044_0052_0FF62D39C9763DC0"/>to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order, in a warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a spe∣cial designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure; and no warrant ought to be issued, but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by law.</P>
<P N="20">20. In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised, the parties have a right to a trial by Jury, and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless in cases arising on the high seas and such as relate to mariners' wages, the Legislature shall think it necessary hereafter to alter it.</P>
<P N="21">21. In order to reap the fullest advantage of the in∣estimable privilege of the trial by Jury, great care ought to be taken, that none but qualified persons should be appoint∣ed to serve; and such ought to be fully compensated for their travel, time and attendance.</P>
<P N="22">22. The LIBERTY OF THE PRESS is essential to the security of freedom in a State: It ought therefore to be inviolably preserved.</P>
<P N="23">23. Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws therefore should be made, either for the decision of civil causes, or the punishment of offences.</P>
<P N="24">24. A well regulated militia is the proper, natural and sure defence of a State.</P>
<P N="25">25. Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised, or kept up without consent of the Legislature.</P>
<P N="26">26. In all cases and at all times, the military ought to be under strict subordination to, and governed by the civil power.</P>
<P N="27">27. No soldier in time of peace, shall be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner; and in time of war, such qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s ought not to be made but by the civil magistrate, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ordained by the Legislature.</P>
<P N="28">28. No subsidy, charge, tax, impost, or duty, shall be established, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext what∣soever,
<PB N="55" REF="033044_0053_0FF62D3D732304C8"/>without the consent of the people, or their Rep∣resentatives in the Legislature, or authority derived from that body.</P>
<P N="29">29. The power of suspending the laws, or the execu∣tion of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, ought never to be exercised but by the Le∣gislature, or by authority derived therefrom, to be exerci∣sed in such particular cases only as the Legislature shall expressly provide for.</P>
<P N="30">30. The fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edom of deliberation, speech and debate, in either House of the Legislature, is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any action, complaint, or prosecution, in any other court or place whatsoever.</P>
<P N="31">31. The Legislature shall assemble for the redress of public grievances, and for making such laws as the public good may require.</P>
<P N="32">32. The people have a right in an orderly and peace∣able manner, to assemble and consult upon the common good, give instructions to their Representatives, and to re∣quest of the legislative body, by way of petition or remon∣strance, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the griev∣ances they suffer.</P>
<P N="33">33. No magistrate, or court of law, shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusal punishments.</P>
<P N="34">34. No person can in any case be subjected to law-marshal, or to any pains or penalties by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual service, but by authority of the Le∣gislature.</P>
<P N="35">35. It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws and administration of justice. It is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of every citizen to be tried by Judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will admit. It is therefore not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, that the Judges of the Supreme Judicial Court should hold their offices so long as they behave well; subject however to such limi∣tations on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount of age, as may be provided by the Con∣stitution of the State; and that they should have honour∣able s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laries ascertained and established by standing laws.</P>
<P N="36"><PB N="56" REF="033044_0054_0FF62D3F09C121A0"/>
36. Economy being a most essential virtue in all States, especially in a young one; no pension shall be granted, but in consideration of actual services; and such pensions ought to be granted with great caution by the Legislature, and never for more than one year at a time.</P>
<P N="37">37. In the government of this State, the three essen∣tial powers thereof, to wit, the Legislative, Executive and Judicial, ought to be kept as separate from, and independ∣ent of each other, as the nature of a free government will admit, or as is consistent with that chain of connexion that binds the whole fabric of the Constitution in one in∣dissoluble bond of union and amity.</P>
<P N="38">38. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental princi∣ples of the Constitution, and a constant adherence to jus∣tice, moderation, temperance, industry, frugality and all the social virtues, are indispensably necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty and good government; the people ought therefore to have a particular regard to all those prin∣ciples in the choice of their officers and representatives: And they have a right to require of their law givers and magistrates, an exact and constant observance of them, in the formation and execution of the laws necessary for the good administration of government.</P>

<P>There shall be, in the Legislature of this State, a representation of the people, annually elected and founded upon principles of equality: And in order that such rep∣resentation may be as equal as circumstances will admit, every town, pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, or place entitled to town privileges, having one hundred and fifty rateable male polls, of twen∣ty-one years of age and upwards, may elect one Repre∣sentative; if four hundred and fifty rateable polls, may elect two Representatives; and so proceeding in that pro∣portion, making three hundred such rateable polls the mean increasing number, for every additional Representative.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>MASSACHUSETTS.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A <HI>CONSTITUTION,</HI> or <HI>FRAME</HI> of <HI>GOVERNMENT,</HI> agreed upon by the Delegates of the People of the State of Massachusetts Bay, in Convention, begun and held at Cam∣bridge, on the first of September, <HI>1779,</HI> and continued by adjournments, to the second of March, <HI>1780.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="preamble">
<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of the institution, maintenance, and admin∣istration of government, is to secure the existence of the body politie, to protect it, and to furnish the individu∣als, who compose it, with the power of enjoying, in safety and tranquillity, their natural rights, and the blessings of life: and whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the government, and to take measures, necessary for their safety, prosperity, and happi∣ness.</P>
<P>The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals. It is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, there∣fore, in framing a Constitution of government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his security in them.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the people of Massachusetts, acknowl∣edging, with grateful hearts, the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording us, in the course of his providence, an opportunity, deliberately and peaceably, without fraud, violence, or surprise, of entering into an
<PB N="80" REF="033044_0078_0FF62D6EADD6AE20"/>original, explicit, and solemn compact with each other— and of forming a new Constitution of civil government, for ourselves and posterity;—and devoutly imploring his di∣rection in so interesting a design, do agree upon, ordain, and establish, the following declaration of rights, and frame of government, as the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> A Declaration of Rights, of the Inhabitants of the Com∣monwealth of Massachusetts.</HEAD>
<P>ART. I. All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defend∣ing their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and ob∣taining their safety and happiness.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is the right, as well as the duty, of all men in society, publickly, and at stated seasons, to worship the Su∣preme Being, the great Creator and Preserver of the Uni∣verse. And no subject shall be hurt, molested, or re∣strained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and season, most agreeable to the dic∣tates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession or sentiments—provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship.</P>
<P N="3">III. As the happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as those cannot be generally diffused through a community, but by the insti∣tution of the public worship of God, and of public instruc∣tions in piety, religion, and morality:—Therefore, to pro∣mote their happiness, and to secure the good order and pre∣servation of their government, the people of this Common∣wealth have a right to invest their Legislature with power to authorise and require, and the Legislature shall, from time to time, authorise and require, the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious societies, to
<PB N="81" REF="033044_0079_0FF62D70C0C572E0"/>make suitable provision, at their own expense, for the in∣stitution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, re∣ligion, and morality, in all cases, where such provision shall not be made voluntarily.</P>
<P>And the people of this Commonwealth have also a right to, and do, invest their Legislature with authority, to en∣join, upon all the subjects, an attendance upon the instruc∣tions of the public teachers, as aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any, on whose instructions they can conscientiously and conveniently attend:—</P>
<P>Provided, notwithstanding, that the several towns, par∣ishes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious socie∣ties, shall, at all times, have the exclusive right of electing their public teachers, and of contracting with them, for their support and maintenance.</P>
<P>And all monies, paid by the subject, to the support of public worship, and of the public teachers aforesaid, shall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the support of the public teacher, or teachers, of his own religious sect or de∣nomination, provided there be any, on whose instructions he attends: otherwise it may be paid towards the support of the teacher, or teachers, of the parish, or precinct, in which the said monies are raised.</P>
<P>And every denomination of Christians, demeaning them∣selves peaceably, and as good subjects of the Commonwealth. shall be equally under the protection of the law: and no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another, shall ever be established by law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The people of this Commonwealth have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves, as a free, sov∣ereign, and independent State; and do, and forever here∣after shall, exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them ex∣pressly delegated to the United States of America, in Con∣gress assembled.</P>
<P N="5">V. All power residing originally in the people, and being derived from them, the several magistrates, and officers of government, vested with authority, whether legislative, ex∣ecutive, or judicial, are their substitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="82" REF="033044_0080_0FF62D72716AC1C0"/>
VI. No man, or corporation, or association of men, have any other title, to obtain advantages, or particular and exclusive privileges, distinct from those of the commu∣nity, than what arises from the consideration of services, rendered to the public. And this title being, in nature, neither hereditary, nor transmissible to children, or de∣scendants, or relations by blood,—the idea of a man, born a magistrate, lawgiver, or judge, is absurd and unnatural.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Government is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private interest of any one man, family, or class of men. Therefore, the people alone have an incontestable, unalienable, and inde∣feasible right, to institute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the same, when their protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness, require it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In order to prevent those, who are vested with authority, from becoming oppressors, the people have a right, at such periods, and in such manner, as they shall establish by their frame of government, to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> their public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant places, by certain and regular elections and appointments.</P>
<P N="9">IX. All elections ought to be free; and all the inhab∣itants of this Commonwealth, having such qualifications, as they shall establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</P>
<P N="10">X. Each individual of the society has a right to be pro∣tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and prop∣erty, according to standing laws. He is obliged, conse∣quently, to contribute his share to the expense of this pro∣tection; to give his personal service, or an equivalent, when necessary. But no part of the property of any in∣dividual can, with justice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of the re∣presentative body of the people. In fine, the people of this Commonwealth are not controllable by any other laws, than those, to which their constitutional representative body have given their consent. And whenever the public exi∣gencies require, that the property of any individual should be appropriated to public uses, he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="83" REF="033044_0081_0FF62D745BE1D910"/>
XI. Every subject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourse to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e laws, for all injuries or wrongs, which he may receive, in his person, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and justice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it—completely, and without any denial—promptly, and with∣out delay—conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="12">XII. No subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself. And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa∣vourable to him; to meet the witnesses against him, face to face; and to be fully heard in his defence, by himself, or his counsel, at his election. And no subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his proper∣ty, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P>And the Legislature shall not make any law, that shall subject any person to a capital or infamous punishment, (excepting for the government of the army and navy) without trial by jury.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In criminal prosecutions, the verification of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greatest securities of the life, liberty and property of the citizen.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or founda∣tion of them be not previously supported by oath or affirm∣ation; and if the order, in a warrant, to a civil officer, to make search in all suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accom∣panied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o warrant ought to be issued, but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.</P>
<P N="15">XV. In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, (except in cases, in which it has heretofore been otherwise used and practised)
<PB N="84" REF="033044_0082_0FF62D75E6DEB2E8"/>the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred; unless, in causes arising on the high seas, and such as relate to mariners' wages, the Legislature shall hereafter find it necessary to alter it.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom in a State; it ought not, therefore, to be re∣strained in this Commonwealth.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained, without the consent of the Legislature; and the military power shall always be held in exact subordina∣tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin∣ciples of the Constitution, and a constant adherence to those of piety, justice, moderation, temperance, industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary, to preserve the ad∣vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, consequently, to have a particular at∣tention to all those principles, in the choice of their officers and representatives: and they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magistrates, an exact and constant ob∣servance of them, in the formation and execution of all laws, necessary for the good administration of the Com∣monwealth.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peace∣able manner, to assemble to consult upon the common good; give instructions to their representatives; and to request of the legislative body, by the way of addresses, pe∣titions, or remonstrances, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they suffer.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The power of suspending the laws, or the execu∣tion of the laws, ought never to be exercised, but by the Legislature; or, by authority derived from it, to be exer∣cised in such particular cases only, as the Legislature shall expressly provide for.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, speech, and debate, in either House of the Legislature, is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accusation or prosecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place whatsoever.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="85" REF="033044_0083_0FF62D78A71C5058"/>
XXII. The Legislature ought frequently to assemble, for the redress of grievances, for correcting, strengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. No subsidy, charge, tax, impost, or duties, ought to be established, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people, or their Representatives in the Legislature.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Laws, made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been de∣clared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free gov∣ernment.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. No subject ought, in any case, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treason or felony by the Legislature.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. No magistrate, or court of law, shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. In time of peace, no soldier ought to be quar∣tered in any house, without the consent of the owner; and in time of war, such quarters ought not to be made, but by the civil magistrate, in a manner ordained by the Legisla∣ture.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. No person can, in any case, be subjected to law martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, (except those employed in the army or navy, and ex∣cept the militia in actual service) but by authority of the Legislature.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and charac∣ter, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and administration of justice. It is the right of every cit∣izen, to be tried by judges, as free, impartial, and inde∣pendent, as the lot of humanity will admit. It is, there∣fore, not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the Judges of the Supreme Judicial Court should hold their offices as long as they behave themselves well; and that they should have honourable salaries, ascertained and established by standing laws.</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="86" REF="033044_0084_0FF62D7A4A93C380"/>
XXX. In the government of this Commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end, it may be a government of laws, and not of men.</P>

The Senate shall be the final judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of their own members, as pointed out in the Constitution; and shall, on the said last Wed∣nesday in May, annually, determine and declare, who are elected by each District, to be Senators, by a majority of votes: and in case there shall not appear to be the full number of Senators returned, elected by a majority of votes for any District, the deficiency shall be supplied in the fol∣lowing manner, viz. The members of the House of Repre∣sentatives, and such Senators as shall be declared elected, shall take the names of such persons, as shall be found to have the highest number of votes in such District, and not elected, amounting to twice the number of Senators want∣ing, if there be so many voted for; and out of these, shall elect, by ballot, a number of Senators, sufficient to fill up

But previous to the trial of every impeach∣ment, the members of the Senate shall respectively be sworn, truly and impartially to try and determine the charge in question, according to evidence. Their judgment, how∣ever, shall not extend further, than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold or enjoy any place of honour, trust or profit, under this Commonwealth: but the party so convicted, shall be, nevertheless, liable to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment, according to the laws of the land.</P>

<P>That no person within the said Colony, at any time here∣after, shall be anywise molested, punished, disquieted, or call∣ed in question, for any differences in opinion in matters of religion, who do not actually disturb the civil peace of our said Colony; but that all and every person and persons may, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments and con∣sciences, in matters of religious concernment, throughout the tract of land hereafter mentioned; they behaving them∣selves peaceably and quietly, and not using this liberty to licentiousness and profaneness, nor to the civil injury or outward disturbance of others;—any law, statute or clause therein contained, or to be contained, usage or custom of this realm, to the contrary hereof in anywise notwith∣standing.</P>

<P><HI>Per ipsum regem.</HI></P>
<P>The State of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations has not assumed a form of government different from that contained in the foregoing chapter. For in that, the King ceded to the Governor and Company, all powers, legisla∣tive, executive, and judicial, reserving to himself, as an acknowledgment of his sovereignty, a render of the fifth part of the gold and silver ore that should be found within the territory. The Governor, chief magistrates, and legis∣lators are chosen by the freemen as usual, and all judicial and executive officers are annually elected by the Gover∣nor
<PB N="129" REF="033044_0127_0FF62D83E0F09E00"/>and Company, or Upper and Lower House of Assem∣bly. All processes, original and judicial, formerly issued in the King's name, but they now issue in the name of the Governor and Company. The oaths of allegiance and of office are made conformable to the principles of the revolu∣tion. The Governor, in his legislative capacity, cannot give a negative to any act of the two Houses; but, in com∣mon with the other magistrates, has one voice only.</P>
<P>The State is divided into five counties, in each of which there is a Court of Common Pleas and General Sessions of the Peace, held twice every year, for the trial of all causes not capital, that arise within their limits; from which an appeal lies, to the Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Assize and General Jail Delivery, whose Juris∣diction extends over the whole State, and who also sit twice a year in each county. The Constitution admits not of religious establishments, any further than depends upon the voluntary choice of individuals. All men pro∣fessing one Supreme Being, are equally protected by the laws; and no particular sect can claim pre-eminence.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>CONNECTICUT.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF CONNECTICUT.</HEAD>
<P>CONNECTICUT is divided into six counties, and each county is divided into a number of towns. Each town has a right to send two Representatives to the Gen∣eral Court or Assembly. The General Court consists of two branches, called the Upper and Lower House. The Upper House is composed of the Governor, Deputy-Governor, and twelve Assistants or Counsel∣lors; and the Lower House, of the Representatives of the several towns. This Court has the sole power to make and rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al laws, grant levies, dispose of lands belonging to the State, to particular towns and persons; to erect and style judicatories and officers, as they shall see necessary, for the good government of the people; also to call to account any court, magistrate, or other officer, for any misdemean∣or and mal-administration; and for just cause, may sine, displace, or remove them, or deal otherwise, as the na∣ture of the case shall require; and deal or act in any other matter, that concerns the good of the State, except the election of Governor, Deputy-Governor, Assistants, Treas∣urer, and Secretary, which shall be done by the freemen, at the yearly court of election, unless there be any va∣cancy, by reason of death or otherwise, after the election, which may be filled up by the General Court. This Court has power also, for reasons satisfactory to them, to grant suspension, release, and jail delivery upon reprieve in capital and criminal cases. The General Court has two stated sessions annually, on the second Thursday of May and October.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="033044_0129_0FF62DD4519DA0D8"/>
The Governor, or, in his absence, the Deputy-Gover∣nor, may call the Assembly, on special emergencies, to meet at any other time. The Governor, Deputy-Governor, Assistants, and Secretary, are annually elected, on the sec∣ond Thursday in May. The Representatives are newly chosen for each stated session. The Judges and Justices are annually appointed by the General Court; the same persons are commonly re-appointed, from time to time, during their capacity to serve, unless guilty of misbehaviour. The Sheriffs are appointed by the Governor and Council, without limitation of time; but may be superseded, by the authority that appoints them. The Governor, for the time being, is captain general of the militia; the Deputy-Governor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the field officers, are appointed by the General Court, and commissioned by the Governor. The captains and subal∣terns are chosen by the vote of the Company and house∣holders, living within the limits of the Company; the per∣sons, so chosen, must be approved by the General Court, and commissioned by the Governor, before they have pow∣er to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the pleasure of the Assembly; nor can they resign their commissions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks, as private soldiers. The mode of electing the Governor, Deputy-Gov∣ernor, Assistants, Treasurer and Secretary is, that the freemen in the several towns meet on the Monday next after the first Tuesday in April, annually (being the day appointed by law, for that purpose, and choosing Representatives) and give in their votes for the persons they choose for said offices respectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which votes are received and sealed up by a con∣stable, in the freemen's meeting—the votes for each of said offices, in a different paper—writing on the outside the name of the town, and the office, for which the votes are given in; which are sent by the Representatives, to the General Court, to be held on the second Thursday of May next ensuing; at which time, after the House of Representatives have chosen a Speaker and Clerk, a commit∣tee is chosen of members of both Houses, to sort and count the votes, and declare the names of the persons chosen to
<PB N="132" REF="033044_0130_0FF62DD63A1F8FF8"/>said offices. Any freeman, qualified to vote for Represent∣atives, &amp;c. may be elected to any office in the government. In choosing Assistants, twenty persons are nominated by the votes of the freemen, given in at their meeting for choosing Representatives in September annually, and sealed up and sent to the General Court, in October then next; which are cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> committee of both Houses, and the twenty persons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho have the greatest number of votes, stand in nomination, out of which number, twelve are to be chosen Assistants by the freemen, the next April, in man∣ner afore described.</P>
<P>The qualifications requisite to entitle a person to vote in elections of the officers of government, are maturity in years, quiet and peaceable behaviour, a civil conversation, and forty shillings freehold, or forty pounds personal estate; if the Selectmen of the town certify a person qualified in those respects, he is admitted a freeman, on his taking an oath of fidelity to the State.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es of all, that are thus admitted, are enrolled in the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>'s office, and continue freemen during life, unless disfranchised by a sentence of the Superior Court, on conviction of a misdemeanor.</P>
<P>The Governor, or, in his absence, the Deputy-Gover∣nor, in the Upper House—and the Speaker, in the Lower House of Assembly—have a casting voice, when the mem∣bers of the respective Houses, including the Governor and Speaker, are equally divided in opinion on any question.</P>
<P>There is, in this State, a Superior Court, consisting of one Chief Judge and four other Judges, who have authority in all criminal cases, extending to life, limb, and banish∣ment, and to hear and determine all civil actions, brought by appeal from the County Courts, or on writs of error. This Court also hath authority in all matters of divorce. There are two stated sessions of the Superior Court in each county annually.</P>
<P>There are also County Courts held in the several coun∣ties, consisting of one Judge and four Justices of the quorum, who have jurisdiction in all criminal cases, arising within their respective counties, where the punishment does not extend to life, limb, or banishment. The County Courts also have original jurisdiction, in all civil actions, wherein the demand exceeds forty shillings.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="033044_0131_0FF62DD891B93B40"/>
The Superior and County Courts try matters of fact, by a jury, according to the course of the common law.</P>
<P>Justices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Peace have authority to hear and deter∣mine civil actions, where the demand does not exceed for∣ty shillings. They also have authority, in some cases of a criminal nature, punishable by sine not exceeding forty shillings, or whipping not exceeding ten stripes, or sitting in the stocks.</P>
<P>This State is also divided into a number of probate dis∣tricts, less than counties; in each of which, is appointed a Judge for the Probate of Wills, granting administration on intestate estates, appointing guardians for minors, ordering distribution of intestate estates, &amp;c. An appeal lies, from any decree of this Court, to the Superior Court.</P>
<P>The Superior, County and Probate Courts appoint their respective Clerks.</P>
<P>The General Court has, till very lately, been the only Court of Chancery in this State. But by a late law, the Coun∣ty Courts determine matters of equity, from five pounds, to two hundred pounds value; the Superior Court, from two hundred to eight hundred pounds' value; and the General Assembly, all cases exceeding the last mentioned sum.</P>
<P>All attornies at law are admitted and sworn by the Coun∣ty Courts; there is no Attorney General, but there used to be one King's Attorney in each county; but since the King has abdicated the government, they are now attornies to the Governor and Company.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK,</HI> Established by the Convention, authorised and empowered for that purpose, April <HI>20, 1777.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Convention, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, doth ordain, deter∣mine, and declare, that no authority shall, on any pretence whatever, be exercised over the people or members of this State, but such as shall be derived from and granted by them.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, ordain, determine, and declare, that the supreme legislative power within this State, shall be vested in two separate and dis∣tinct bodies of men—the one to be called, The Assembly of the State of New-York—the other to be called, The Senate of the State of New-York—who together shall form the Legislature, and meet once at least in every year, for the dispatch of business.</P>
<P N="3">III. And whereas laws, inconsistent with the spirit of this Constitution, or with the public good, may be hastily and unadvisedly passed; be it ordained, that the Governor for the time being the Chancellor, and the Judges of the Supreme Court—or any two of them, together with the Governor—shall be, and hereby are, constituted a Coun∣cil, to revise all bills about to be passed into laws by the Legislature; and for that purpose shall assemble themselves, from time to time, when the Legislature shall be convened; for which, nevertheless, they shall not receive any salary or consideration, under any pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce whatever. And that
<PB N="135" REF="033044_0133_0FF62DDC08A7BE78"/>all bills, which have passed the Senate and Assembly, shall, before they become laws, be presented to the said Council, for their revisal and consideration; and if, upon such re∣vision and consideration, it should appear improper to the said Council, or a majority of them, that the said bill should become a law of this State, that they return the same, to∣gether with their objections thereto in writing, to the Sen∣ate or House of Assembly (in whichsoever the same shall have originated) who shall enter the objections, sent down by the Council, at large in their minutes, and proceed to re-consider the said bill. But if, after such re-considera∣tion, two thirds of the said Senate or House of Assembly shall, notwithstanding the said objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of the Legislature, where it shall also be re∣considered, and, if approved by two thirds of the members present, shall be a law.</P>
<P>And in order to prevent any unnecessary delays, be it further ordained, that if any bill shall not be returned by the Coucil within ten days after it shall have been pre∣sented, the same shall be a law, unless the Legislature shall, by their adjournment, render a return of the said bill, with in ten days, impracticable; in which case, the bill shall be returned on the first day of the meeting of the Legislature, after the expiration of the said ten days.</P>

V. That as soon, after the expiration of seven years, (subsequent to the termination of the present war) as may be, a census of the electors and inhabitants in this State be taken, under the direction of the Legislature. And if, on such census, it shall appear, that the number of Repre∣sentatives in Assembly, from the said counties, is not justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roportioned to the number of electors, in the said counties respective<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gislature do adjust and apportion the same by that rule. And further, that once in every seven years, after the taking of the said first census, a just account of the electors, resident in each county. shall be taken; and if it shall thereupon appear, that the number of electors, in any county, shall have increased or diminish∣ed one or more seventieth parts of the whole number of electors, which, on the said first census, shall be found in this State, the number of Representatives for such county hall be increased or diminished accordingly—that is to say, one Representative for every seventieth part as aforesaid.</P>

<P N="7">VII. That every male inhabitant, of full age, who shall have personally resided within one of the counties of this State, for six months immediately preceding the day of election, shall, at such election, be entitled to vote for Representatives of the said county in Assembly; if, dur∣ing the time aforesaid, he shall have been a freeholder, pos∣sessing a freehold of the value of twenty pounds, within the said county, or have rented a tenement therein, of the year∣ly value of forty shillings, and been rated and actually paid taxes to this State:—provided always, that every person, who now is a freeman of the city of Albany, or who was made a freeman of the city of New-York, on or before the fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, and shall be actu∣ally and usually resident in the said cities respectively, shall be entitled to vote for Representatives in Assembly, within his said place of residence.</P>

<P N="9">IX. That the Assembly, thus constituted, shall choose their own Speaker, be judges of their own members, and enjoy the same privileges, and proceed in doing business, in like manner as the Assemblies of the Colony of New-York of right formerly did; and that a majority of the said members shall, from time to time, constitute a House, to proceed upon business.</P>
<P N="10">X. And this Convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, or∣dain, determine and declare, that the Senate of the State of New-York shall consist of twenty-four freeholders, to be chosen out of the body of the freeholders; and that they be chosen by the freeholders of this State, possessed of free∣holds of the value of one hundred pounds, over and above all debts charged thereon.</P>

XI. That the members of the Senate be elected for four years; and immediately after the first election, they be divided by lot into four classes, six in each class, and numbered one, two, three, and four; that the seats of the members of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the first year, the second class the second year, and so on continually; to the end, that the fourth part of the Senate, as nearly as possible, may be annually chosen.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That the election of Senators shall be after this manner; that so much of this State, as is now parcelled into counties, be divided into four great districts; the southern district to comprehend the city and county of New-York, Suffolk, Westchester, Kings, Queens, and Richmond counties; the middle district to comprehend the counties of Duchess, Ulster, and Orange; the west∣ern district, the city and county of Albany and Tryon county; and the eastern district, the counties of Charlotte, Cumberland, and Gloucester. That the Senators shall be elected by the freeholders of the said districts, qualified as aforesaid, in the proportions following; to wit, in the south∣ern district, nine; in the middle district, six; in the western district, six; and in the eastern district, three. And be it ordained, that a census shall be taken, as soon as may be, after the expiration of seven years from the termination of the present war, under the direction of the Legislature: and if on such census it shall appear, that the number of Sen∣ators is not justly proportioned to the several districts, that the Legislature adjust the proportion, as near as may be, to the number of freeholders, qualified as aforesaid in each district. That when the number of electors, within any of the said districts, shall have increased one twenty-fourth part of the whole number of electors, which by the said census shall be found to be in this State, an additional Senator shall be chosen by the electors of such district. That a majority of the number of Senators, to be chosen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s aforesaid, shall be necessary to constitute a Senate, suf∣ficient to proceed upon business; and that the Senate shall, in like manner with the Assembly, be the judges of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own members. And be it ordained, that it shall be in the power of the future Legislatures of this State, for the convenience and advantage of the good people thereof,
<PB N="139" REF="033044_0137_0FF62DE34A20DD70"/>to divide the same into such further and other counties and districts, as shall to them appear necessary.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. And this Convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, or∣dain, determine, and declare, that no member of this State shall be disfranchised, or deprived of any of the rights or privileges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to the subjects of this State by this Con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, unless by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That neither the Assembly nor the Senate shall have the power to adjourn themselves, for any longer time than two days, without the mutual consent of both.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That whenever the Assembly and Senate disa∣gree, a conference shall be held, in the presence of both, and be managed by committees, to be by them respectively chosen by ballot. That the doors both of the Senate and Assembly shall at all times be kept open to all persons, except when the welfare of the State shall require their debates to be kept secret. And the journals of all their proceedings shall be kept, in the manner heretofore accus∣tomed by the General Assembly of the colony of New-York; and (except such parts as they shall, as aforesaid, respectively determine not to make public) be from day to day (if the business of the Legislature will permit) pub∣lished.</P>
<P N="16">XVI.

And that none of the said char∣ters shall be adjudged to be void, by reason of any non-user or misuser of any of their respective rights or privi∣leges, between the nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, and the publication of this Constitution.

<P N="38">XXXVIII.

Provided that the liberty of conscience, hereby granted; shall not be so construed, as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of this State.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX.

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>NEW-JERSEY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS all the constitutional authority, ever possessed by the kings of Great Britain, over these Colonies, or their other dominions, was, by compact, de∣rived from the people, and held of them, for the common interest of the whole society; allegiance and protection are, in the nature of things, reciprocal ties, each equally de∣pending upon the other, and liable to be dissolved by the other's being refused or withdrawn: and whereas George the Third, king of Great-Britain, has refused protection to the good people of these Colonies; and by assenting to sun∣dry acts of the British parliament, attempted to subject them to the absolute dominion of that body; and has also made war upon them, in the most cruel and unnatural manner, for no other cause than asserting their just rights; all civil authority under him is necessarily at an end, and a dissolu∣tion of government in each Colony has consequently taken place.</P>
<P>And whereas, in the present deplorable situation of these Colonies, exposed to the fury of a cruel and relentless ene∣my, some form of government is absolutely necessary, not only for the preservation of good order, but also the more effectually to unite the people, and enable them to exert their whole force in their own necessary defence; and as the honourable the Continental Congress, the supreme council of the American Colonies, has advised such of the Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es as have not yet gone into the measure, to adopt, for themselves respectively, such government as shall best conduce to their own happiness and safety, and the well∣being of America in general:—We, the Representatives of the Colony of New-Jersey, having been elected by all the counties in the freest manner, and in Congress assembled,
<PB N="149" REF="033044_0147_0FF62DF7B3E62DB8"/>have, after mature deliberations, agreed upon a set of charter rights and the form of a Constitution, in manner following, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the government of this Province shall be vested in a Governor, Legislative Council, and General Assembly.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the Legislative Council, and General Assem∣bly, shall be chosen, for the first time, on the second Tues∣day in August next; the members whereof shall be the same in number and qualifications as are herein after men∣tioned; and shall be and remain vested with all the powers and authority to be hold by any future Legislative Council and Assembly of this Colony, until the second Tuesday in October, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thou∣sand seven hundred and seventy-seven.</P>
<P N="3">III. That on the second Tuesday in October yearly, and every year forever (with the privilege of adjourning from day to day, as occasion may require) the counties shall severally choose one person, to be a member of the Legislative Council of this Colony, who shall be, and have been, for one whole year next before the election, an in∣habitant and freeholder in the county in which he is cho∣sen, and worth at least one thousand pounds proclamation money, of real and personal estate, within the same coun∣ty: that, at the same time, each county shall also choose three members of Assembly; provided that no person shall be entitled to a seat in the said Assembly unless he be, and have been, for one whole year next before the election, an inhabitant of the county he is to represent, and worth five hundred pounds proclamation money, in real and personal estate, in the same county: that on the second Tuesday next after the day of election, the Council and Assembly shall separately meet; and that the consent of both Houses shall be necessary to every law; provided, that seven shall be a quorum of the Council, for doing business, and that no law shall pass, unless ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be a majority of all the Rep∣resentatives of each body personally present, and agreeing thereto. Provided always, that if a majority of the Rep∣resentatives of this Province, in Council and General As∣sembly convened, shall, at any time or times hereafter, judge it equitable and proper, to add to or diminish the number or proportion of the members of Assembly for any
<PB N="150" REF="033044_0148_0FF62DF9C1C917A0"/>county or counties in this Colony, then, and in such case, the same may, on the principles of more equal representa∣tion, be lawfully done; any thing in this Charter to the contrary notwithstanding: so that the whole number of Representatives in Assembly shall not, at any time, be less than thirty-nine.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money, clear estate in the same, and have resided within the county in which they claim a vote for twelve months immediately preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote for Representatives in Council and Assembly; and also for all other public offi∣cers, that shall be elected by the people of the county at large.</P>

<P N="8"><PB N="151" REF="033044_0149_0FF62DFBB6275B88"/>
VIII. That the Governor, or, in his absence, the Vice-President of the Council, shall have the supreme executive power, be Chancellor of the Colony, and act as captain∣general and commander in chief of all the militia, and other military force in this Colony; and that any three or more of the Council shall, at all times, be a privy-council, to consult them; and that the Governor be ordinary or surrogate general.</P>

<P N="11">XI. That the Council and Assembly shall have power to make the Great Seal of this Colony, which shall be kept by the Governor, or, in his absence, by the Vice-President of the Council, to be used by them as occasion may require: and it shall be called, <HI>The Great Seal of the Colony of New-Jersey.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. That the Judges of the Supreme Court shall continue in orfice for seven years: the Judges of the In∣ferior Court of Common Pleas in the several counties, Justices of the Peace, Clerks of the Supreme Court, Clerks of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas and Quarter Ses∣sions, the Attorney-General, and Provincial Secretary, shall continue in office for five years: and the Provincial Treasurer shall continue in office for one year; and that they shall be severally appointed by the Council and Assembly, in manner aforesaid, and commissioned by the Governor, or, in his absence, the Vice-President of the Council. Provided always, that the said officers, severally, shall be capable of being re-appointed, at the end of the terms severally before limited; and that any of the said officers shall be liable to be dismissed, when adjudged guilty of misbehaviour, by the Council, on an impeachment of the Assembly.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That the inhabitants of each county, qualified to vote as aforesaid, shall at the time and place of electing
<PB N="152" REF="033044_0150_0FF62DFD9E504CB8"/>their Representatives, annually elect one Sheriff, and one or more Coroners; and that they may re-elect the same person to such offices, until he shall have served three years, but no longer; after which, three years must elapse before the same person is capable of being elected again. When the election is certified to the Governor, or Vice-President, under the hands of fix freeholders of the county for which they were elected, they shall be immediately commissioned to serve in their respective offices.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That the townships, at their annual town meet∣ings for electing other officers, shall choose constanbles for the districts respectively; and also three or more judicious freeholders of good character, to hear and finally determine all appeals, relative to unjust assessments, in cases of public taxation; which commissioners of appeal shall, for that purpose, sit at some suitable time or times, to be by them appointed, and made known to the people by advertise∣ments.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Representatives shall be chosen annually, by the citizens of the city of Philadelphia, and of each county respectively, on the second Tuesday of October.</P>
<P N="3">III. No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained the age of twenty-one years, and have been a citizen and inhabitant of the State three years next pre∣ceding his election, and the last year thereof an inhabitant of the city or county, in which he shall be chosen; unless he shall have been absent on the public business of the United States, or of this State.

Within three years after the first meeting of the General Assembly, and within every subsequent term of seven years, an enumeration of the taxable inhabitants shall be made, in such manner as shall be directed by law. The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making such enumeration, be fixed by the Legislature, and

Each county shall have, at least, one Rep∣resentative: but no county, hereafter erected, shall be en∣titled to a separate representation, until a sufficient number of taxable inhabitants shall be contained within it, to entitle them to one Representative, agreeable to the ratio which shall then be established.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Senators shall be chosen for four years, by the citizens of Philadelphia, and of the several counties, at the same time, in the same manner, and at the same places where they shall vote for Representatives.</P>

<P N="7">VII.

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the first year; of the second class, at the expiration of the second year; of the third class, at the expiration of the third year;

A majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business: but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorised, by law, to compel the attendance of absent mem∣bers, in such manner, and under such penalties, as may be provided.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings; punish its members for disorderly behaviour; and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member; but not a second time for the same cause; and shall have all other powers necessary for a branch of the Legislature of a free State.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceed∣ings, and publish them weekly, except such parts as may require secrecy. And the yeas and nays of the members, on any question, shall, at the desire of any two of them, be entered on the journals.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The doors of each House, and of committees of the whole, shall be open, unless when the business shall be such as ought to be kept secret.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Neither House shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the Commonwealth. They shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach or sure∣ty of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, be privileged from arrest, during their at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dance at the session of the respective Houses, and in go∣ing

<P N="18">XVIII. No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he shall have been elected, be appointed to any civil office, under this Commonwealth, which shall have been created, or the emoluments of which shall have been increased, during such time: and no member of Con∣gress, or other person holding any office (except of attorney at law, and in the militia) under the United States or this Commonwealth, shall be a member of either House, during his continuance in Congress, or in office.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. When vacancies happen in either House, the Speaker shall issue writs of election to sill such vacancies.</P>
<P N="20">XX. All bills, for raising revenue, shall originate in the House of Representatives: but the Senate may propose amendments, as in other bills.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. Every bill, which shall have passed both Houses, shall be presented to the Governor. If he approve, he shall sign it: but if he shall not approve, he shall return it, with his objections, to the House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large upon their journals, and proceed to re-consider it. If, after such re-consideration, two-thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, with the objections, to the other House, by which likewise it shall be re-considered: and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it shall be a law. But in such cases, the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays: and the names of the per∣sons voting for or against the bill, shall be entered on the journals of each House respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the Governor within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him; it shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it; un∣less the General Assembly, by their adjournment, prevent its return; in which case it shall be a law, unless sent back within three days after their next meeting.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of both Houses may be necessary (except
<PB N="159" REF="033044_0157_0FF62E0BCFF9DBE8"/>on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the Governor; and, before it shall take effect, be approved by him; or, being disapproved, shall be re-passed by two-thirds of both Houses, according to the rules and limitations pre∣scribed in case of a bill.</P>

<P N="1">I. That all men are born equally free and independ∣ent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, a∣mong which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="166" REF="033044_0164_0FF62E1A620624E0"/>
II. That all power is inherent in the people; and all free governments are founded on their authority, and in∣stituted for their peace, safety, and happiness. For the ad∣vancement of those ends, they have, at all times, an una∣lienable and indefeasible right, to alter, reform, or abolish their government, in such manner as they may think proper.</P>

That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishments or modes of worship.</P>

The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the in∣valuable rights of man: and every citizen may freely speak, write and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty. In prosecutions for the publica∣tion of papers, investigating the official conduct of officers, or men in a public capacity, or where the matter published is proper for public information, the truth thereof may be given in evidence. And, in all indictments for libels, the jury shall have a right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the Court, as in other cases.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>DELAWARE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A. <HI>DECLARATION OF RIGHTS</HI> and Fundamental Rules of the <HI>DELAWARE STATE,</HI> formerly styled, The Government of the Counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex upon Delaware.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT all government of right originates from the people, is founded in compact only, and instituted solely for the good of the whole.</P>
<P N="2">II. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences and understanding<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or maintain any ministry, contrary to, or against his own free will-and consent; and that-no authority can or ought to be vested in, or assumed by, any power what∣ever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any man∣ner control the right of conscience, in the free exercise of religious worship.</P>
<P N="3">III. That all persons, professing the Christian religion, ought forever to enjoy equal rights and privileges, in this S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate; unless, under colour of religion, any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or safety of society.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the people of this State have the sole, exclu∣sive, and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same.</P>
<P N="5">V. That persons intrusted with the legislative and executive powers, are the trustees and servants of the pub∣lic, and, as such, accountable for their conduct; where∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> liberty manifestly endangered, by the legislative sin∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, or a treacherous combination of both, the people may,
<PB N="174" REF="033044_0172_0FF62E2AB24DB750"/>and of right ought to establish a new or reform the old government.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the right, in the people, to participate in the Legislature, is the foundation of liberty and of all free government; and for this end, all elections ought to be free and frequent: and every freeman, having sufficient evi∣dence of a permanent common interest with, and attach∣ment to the community, hath a right of suffrage.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That no power of suspending laws, or the execu∣tion of laws, ought to be exercised, unless by the Legis∣lature.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That, for redress of grievances, and for amend∣ing and strengthening of the laws, the Legislature ought to be frequently convened.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That every man hath a right to petition the Le∣gislature for the redress of grievances, in a peaceable and orderly manner.</P>
<P N="10">X. That every member of society hath a right to be protected, in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property, and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expense of that protection, and yield his personal ser∣vice, when necessary, or an equivalent thereto; but no part of a man's property can be justly taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of his legal Representatives: nor can any man, that is con∣scientiously scrupulous of bearing arms in any case, be justly compelled thereto, if he will pay such equivalent.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That retrospective laws, punishing offences com∣mitted before the existence of such laws, are oppressive and unjust, and ought not to be made.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That every freeman, for every injury done him in his goods, lands, or person, by any other person, ought to have remedy, by the course of the law of the land, and ought to have justice and right for the injury done to him, freely without sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay, according to the law of the land.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That trial, by jury, of facts where they arise, is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties, and estates of the people.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That in all prosecutions for criminal offences, ev∣ery man hath a right to be informed of the accusation against
<PB N="175" REF="033044_0173_0FF62E2CDBB696D8"/>him, to be allowed counsel, to be confronted with the ac∣cusers or witnesses, to examine evidence on oath in his favour, and to a speedy trial, by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That no man, in the courts of common law, ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive sines imposed, nor cruel nor unusual punish∣ments inflicted.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That all warrants, without oath, to search sus∣pected places, or to seize any person or his property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants—to search suspected places, or to apprehend all persons suspect∣ed, without naming or describing the place or any person in special—are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free government.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without the con∣sent of the Legislature.</P>
<P N="20">XX. That, in all cases, and at all times, the military ought to be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That no soldier ought to be quartered in any house, in time of peace, without the consent of the owner; and in time of war, in such manner only, as the Legislature shall direct.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. That the independency and uprightness of Judges are essential to the impartial administration of jus∣tice, and a great security to the rights and liberties of the people.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. That the liberty of the press ought to be in∣violably preserved.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>CONSTITUTION,</HI> or <HI>SYSTEM</HI> of <HI>GOVERNMENT,</HI> agreed to and resolved upon by the Representatives, in full Convention, of the <HI>DELAWARE STATE,</HI> formerly styled, The Government of the Counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, upon Delaware; the said Representatives being chosen by the freemen of the said State, for that express purpose.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE government of the counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, upon Delaware, shall hereafter, in all public and other writings, be called, <HI>The Delaware State.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The Legislature shall be formed of two distinct branches. They shall meet once or oftener in every year, and shall be called, <HI>The General Assembly of Delaware.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. One of the branches of the Legislature shall be called, <HI>The House of Assembly,</HI> and shall consist of seven Representatives, to be chosen for each county annually, of such persons as are freeholders of the same.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The other branch shall be called, <HI>The Council,</HI> and consist of nine members; three to be chosen for each county at the time of the first election of the Assembly, who shall be freeholders of the county for which they are cho∣sen, and be upwards of twenty five years of age. At the end of one year after the general election, the Counsellor who had the smallest number of votes in each county shall be displaced, and the vacancies, thereby occasioned, sup∣plied by the freemen of each county choosing the same or another person, at a new election, in manner aforesaid. At the end of two years after the first general election, the Counsellor who stood second in number of votes in each county shall be displaced, and the vacancies, thereby occa∣sioned, supplied by a new election, in manner aforesaid. And at the end of three years from the first general elec∣tion, the Counsellor who had the greatest number of votes in each county shall be displaced, and the vacancies, thereby occasioned, supplied by a new election in manner aforesaid. And this rotation, of a Counsellor being displaced at the end of three years in each county, and his office supplied by a new choice, shall be continued afterwards in due or∣der annually forever; whereby, after the first general elec∣tion,
<PB N="177" REF="033044_0175_0FF62E32E391AEB0"/>a Counsellor will remain in trust for three years from the time of his being elected, and a Counsellor will be displaced; and the same or another chosen in each county at every election.</P>
<P N="5">V. The right of suffrage, in the election of members for both Houses, shall remain, as exercised by law at pres∣ent; and each House shall choose its own Speaker, appoint its own officers, judge of the qualifications and elections of its own members, settle its own rules of proceeding, and direct writs of election, for supplying intermediate va∣cancies. They may also severally expel any of their own members for misbehaviour, but not a second time in the same sessions for the same offence, if re-elected; and they shall have all other powers, necessary for the Legislature of a free and independent State.</P>
<P N="6">VI. All money bills, for the support of government, shall originate in the House of Assembly, and may be al∣tered, amended, or rejected, by the Legislative Council. All other bills and ordinances may take rise in the House of Assembly, or Legislative Council, and may be altered, amended, or rejected by either.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A President or Chief Magistrate shall be chosen by joint ballot of both Houses, to be taken in the House of Assembly, and the box examined by the Speakers of each House, in the presence of the other members; and in case the numbers, for the two highest in votes, should be equal, then the Speaker of the Council shall have an additional casting voice; and the appointment of the per∣son, who has the majority of votes, shall be entered at large on the minutes and journals of each House; and a copy thereof, on parchment, certified and signed by the Speak∣ers respectively, and sealed with the Great Seal of the State, which they are hereby authorised to affix, shall be deliver∣ed to the person so chosen President, who shall continue in that office three years, and until the sitting of the next General Assembly, and no longer; nor be eligible until the expiration of three years, after he shall have been out of that office. An adequate, but moderate salary shall be settled on him, during his continuance in office. He may draw for such sums of money, as shall be appropriated by the General Assembly, and be accountable to them for the
<PB N="178" REF="033044_0176_0FF62E35224E7C68"/>same; he may, by and with the advice of the Privy Coun∣cil, lay embargoes, or prohibit the exportation of any com∣modity, for any time not exceeding thirty days, in the recess of the General Assembly; he shall have the power of granting pardons or reprieves, except where the prosecu∣tion shall be carried on by the House of Assembly, or the law shall otherwise direct; in which cases no pardon or reprieve shall be granted, but by a resolve of the House of Assembly; and may exercise all the other executive powers of government, limited and restrained, as by this Constitu∣tion is mentioned, and according to the laws of the State. And on his death, inability, or absence from the State, the Speaker of the Legislative Council, for the time being, shall be Vice-President; and in case of his death, inability, or absence from the State, the Speaker of the House of As∣sembly shall have the powers of a President, until a new nomination be made by the General Assembly.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. A Privy Council, consisting of four members, shall be chosen by ballot, two by the Legislative Coun∣cil, and two by the House of Assembly: provided, that no regular officer of the army or navy, in the service and pay of the Continent, or of this, or of any other State, shall be eligible. And a member of the Legislative Coun∣cil, or of the House of Assembly, being chosen of the Privy Council, and accepting thereof, shall thereby lose his seat. Three members shall be a quorum; and their advice and proceedings shall be entered on record, and signed by the members present, (to any part of which, any member may enter his dissent) to be laid before the General Assembly when called for by them. Two members shall be removed by ballot, one by the Legislative Council, and one by the House of Assembly, at the end of two years; and those who remain, the next year after; who shall sev∣erally be ineligible for the three next years. These vacan∣cies, as well as those oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asioned by death or incapacity, shall be supplied by new elections, in the same manner. And this rotation of a Privy Counsellor shall be continued afterwards in due order, annually, forever. The President may, by summons, convene the Privy Council, at any time when the public exigencies may require, and at such place as he shall think most convenient, when and where they are to attend accordingly.</P>

<P N="10">X. Either House of the General Assembly may ad∣journ themselves respectively. The President shall not pro∣rogue, adjourn, or dissolve the General Assembly; but he may, with the advice of the Privy Council, or on the ap∣plication of a majority of either House, call them before the time to which they shall stand adjourned: and the two Houses shall always sit at the same time and place; for which purpose, immediately after every adjournment, the Speaker of the House of Assembly shall give notice to the Speaker of the other House, of the time to which the House of Assembly stands adjourned.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Delegates for Delaware to the Congress of the United States of America, shall be chosen annually, or superseded in the mean time, by joint ballot of both Houses in the General Assembly.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The President and General Assembly shall, by joint ballot, appoint three Justices of the Supreme Court for the State, one of whom shall be Chief Justice, and a Judge of Admiralty, and also four Justices of the Courts of Common Pleas and Orphans' Courts, for each county, one of whom in each Court shall be styled <HI>Chief Justice,</HI> (and, in case of division on the ballot, the President shall have an additional casting voice) to be commissioned by the President, under the Great Seal—who shall continue in office during good behaviour. And during the time the Justices of the said Supreme Court, and Courts of Com∣mon Pleas, remain in office, they shall hold none other, except in the militia. Any one of the Justices of either of said Courts shall have power, in case of the non-coming of his brethren, to open and adjourn the Court. An adequate, fixed, but moderate salary shall be settled on them, during their continuance in office. The President and Privy-Council shall appoint the Secretary, the Attor∣ney-General, Registers for the Probate of Wills, and grant∣ing letters of administration, Registers in Chancery, Clerks of the Courts of Common Pleas and Orphans' Courts, and
<PB N="180" REF="033044_0178_0FF62E388D735048"/>Clerks of the Peace, who shall be commissioned as aforesaid, and remain in office during five years, if they behave them∣selves well; during which time, the said Registers in Chan∣cery, and Clerks, shall not be Justices of either of the said Courts, of which they are officers, but they shall have au∣thority to sign all writs, by them issued, and take recogni∣zances of bail. The Justices of the Peace shall be nom∣inated by the House of Assembly; that is to say, they shall name twenty-four persons for each county, of whom the President, with the approbation of the Privy Council, shall appoint twelve, who shall be commissioned, as aforesaid, and continue in office daring seven years, if they behave themselves well; and in case of vacancies, or if the Le∣gislature shall think proper to increase the number, they shall be nominated and appointed in like manner. The members of the Legislative and Privy Councils shall be Justices of the Peace for the whole State, during their con∣tinuance in trust; and the Justices of the Courts of Com∣mon Pleas shall be conservators of the peace in their respec∣tive counties.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Justices of the Courts of Common Pleas and Orphans' Courts shall have the power of holding in∣ferior Courts of Chancery, as heretofore, unless the Le∣gislature shall otherwise direct.</P>
<P N="14">XIV.

<P N="15">XV.

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>MARYLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A <HI>DECLARATION OF RIGHTS,</HI> and the <HI>CON∣STITUTION</HI> and <HI>FORM</HI> of <HI>GOVERNMENT,</HI> agreed to by the Delegates of Maryland, in free and full Con∣vention assembled.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, &amp;.</HEAD>
<P>THE parliament of Great Britain, by a declaratory act, having assumed a right to make laws to bind the Colonies in all cases whatsoever, and, in pursuance of such claim, endeavoured, by force of arms, to subjugate the United Colonies to an unconditional submission to their will and power, and having at length constrained them to declare themselves independent States, and to assume government under the authority of the people;—Therefore we, the Delegates of Maryland, in free and full Convention assem∣bled, taking into our most serious consideration the best means of establishing a good Constitution in this State, for the sure foundation and more permanent security thereof, declare,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That all government of right originates from the people, is founded in compact only, and instituted solely for the good of the whole.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That the people of this State ought to have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the internal govern∣ment and police thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, accord∣ing to the course of that law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes, as existed at the time of their first em∣igration, and which, by experience, have been found ap∣plicable to their local and other circumstances, and of such others as have been since made in England, or Great
<PB N="186" REF="033044_0184_0FF62E45B9BE2E48"/>Britain, and have been introduced, used and practised by the courts of law or equity; and also to all acts of Assem∣bly, in force on the first of June seventeen hundred and seventy-four, except such as may have since expired, or have been or may be altered by acts of Convention, or this Declaration of Rights—subject, nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legislature of this State: and the inhabitants of Maryland are also entitled to all property, derived to them, from or under the Charter, granted by his Majesty Charles I. to Caecilius Calvert, baron of Baltimore.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. That all persons invested with the legislative or executive powers of government are the trustees of the public, and, as such, accountable for their conduct; where∣fore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old or establish a new government. The doctrine of non-resistance, against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. That the right in the people to participate in the Legislature, is the best security of liberty, and the founda∣tion of all free government; for this purpose, elections ought to be free and frequent, and every man, having prop∣erty in, a common interest with, and an attachment to the community, ought to have a right of suffrage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. That the legislative, executive and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. That no power of suspending laws, or the execu∣tion of laws, unless by or derived from the Legislature, ought to be exercised or allowed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. That freedom of speech and debates, or pro∣ceedings in the Legislature, ought not to be impeached in any other court or judicature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. That a place for the meeting of the Legislature ought to be fixed, the most convenient to the members thereof, and to the depository of public records; and the Legislature ought not to be convened or held at any other place, but from evident necessity.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="187" REF="033044_0185_0FF62E4749D7AB28"/>
X. That, for redress of grievances, and for amending, strengthening and preserving the laws, the Legislature ought to be frequently convened.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. That every man hath a right to petition the Le∣gislature, for the redress of grievances, in a peaceable and orderly manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. That no aid, charge, tax, see, or fees, ought to be set, rated, or levied, under any pretence, without consent of the Legislature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIII. That the levying taxes by the poll is grievous and oppressive, and ought to be abolished; that paupers ought not to be assessed for the support of government; but every other person in the State ought to contribute his pro∣portion of public taxes, for the support of government, ac∣cording to his actual worth, in real or personal property, within the State; yet sines, duties, or taxes, may properly and justly be imposed or laid, with a political view, for the good government and benefit of the community.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIV. That sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is consistent with the safety of the State: and no law, to inflict cruel and unusual pains and penalties, ought to be made in any case, or at any time hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XV. That retrospective laws, punishing facts com∣mitted before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no <HI>ex post facto</HI> law ought to be made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVI. That no law, to attaint particular persons of treason or felony, ought to be made in any case, or any time hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVII. That every freeman, for any injury done him in his person or property, ought to have remedy, by the course of the law of the land, and ought to have justice and right freely without sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay, according to the law of the land.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVIII. That the trial of facts where they arise, is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties and estates of the people.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIX. That, in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accusation against him:
<PB N="188" REF="033044_0186_0FF62E48E17B0F68"/>to have a copy of the indictment or charge in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence; to be allowed counsel; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have process for his witnesses; to examine the witnes∣ses, for and against him, on oath; and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XX. That no man ought to be compelled to give evi∣dence against himself, in a common court of law, or in any other court, but in such cases as have been usually practised in this State, or may hereafter be directed by the Legislature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXI. That no freeman ought to be taken, or impris∣oned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or de∣prived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXII. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive sines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punish∣ments inflicted, by the courts of law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXIII. That all warrants, without oath or affirma∣tion, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general war∣rants—to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in special—are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXIV. That there ought to be no forfeiture of any part of the estate of any person, for any crime except mur∣der, or treason against the State, and then only on con∣viction and attainder.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXV. That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defence of a free government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXVI. That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without consent of the Legislature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXVII. That in all cases, and at all times, the mili∣tary ought to be under strict subordination to and control of the civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXVIII. That no soldier ought to be quartered in any house, in time of peace, without the consent of the owner; and in time of war, in such manner only, as the Legislature shall direct.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="189" REF="033044_0187_0FF6175419A3DF90"/>
XXIX. That no person, except regular soldiers, mar∣iners, and marines in the service of this State, or militia when in actual service, ought in any case to be subject to or punishable by martial law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXX. That the independency and uprightness of Judges are essential to the impartial administration of jus∣tice, and a great security to the rights and liberties of the people; wherefore the Chancellor and Judges ought to hold commissions during good behaviour; and the said Chancellor and Judges shall be removed for misbehaviour, on conviction in a court of law, and may be removed by the Governor, upon the address of the General Assembly; provided that two thirds of all the members of each House concur in such address. That salaries, liberal, but not profuse, ought to be secured to the Chancellor and the Judges, during the continuance of their commissions, in such manner, and at such times, as the Legislature shall hereafter direct, upon consideration of the circumstances of this State. No Chancellor or Judge ought to hold any other office, civil or military, or receive fees or perquisites of any kind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXI. That a long continuance, in the first execu∣tire departments of power or trust, is dangerous to liberty; a rotation, therefore, in those departments, is one of the best securities of permanent freedom.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXII. That no person ought to hold, at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, more than one office of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, nor ought any person, in public trust, to rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any present from any foreign prince or state, or from the United States, or any of them, without the approbation of this State.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXIII. That, as it is the duty of every man to wor∣ship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to him; all persons, professing the Christian religion, are equal∣ly entitled to protection in their religious liberty; where∣fore no person ought by any law to be molested in his per∣son or estate on account of his religious persuasion or pro∣fession, or for his religious practice; unless, under colour of religion, any man shall dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others, in their natural, civil, or religious rights; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent or main∣tain, or contribute, unless on contract, to maintain any
<PB N="190" REF="033044_0188_0FF62E4E2B1386E0"/>particular place of worship, or any particular ministry; yet the Legislature may, in their discretion, lay a general and equal tax, for the support of the Christian religion; leav∣ing to each individual the power of appointing the payment over of the money, collected from him, to the support of any particular place of worship or minister, or for the ben∣efit of the poor of his own denomination, or the poor in general of any particular county: but the churches, chapels, glebes, and all other property now belonging to the church of England, ought to remain to the church of England forever. And all acts of Assembly, lately passed, for col∣lecting monies for building or repairing particular churches or chapels of ease, shall continue in force, and be executed, unless the Legislature shall, by act, supersede or repeal the same: but no county court shall assess any quantity of to∣bacco, or sum of money, hereafter, on the application of any vestry-men or church-wardens; and every encumbent of the church of England, who hath remained in his parish, and performed his duty, shall be entitled to receive the pro∣vision and support established by the act, entitled "An act for the support of the clergy of the church of England, in this Province," till the November court of this present year, to be held for the county in which his parish shall lie, or partly lie, or for such time as he hath remained in his parish, and performed his duty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXIV. That every gift, sale, or devise of lands, to any minister, public teacher, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preacher of the gospel, as such, or to any religious sect, order or denomination, or to or for the support, use or benefit of, or in trust for, any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the gospel, as such, or any religious sect order or denomination—and every gift or sale of goods, or chattels, to go in succession, or to take place after the death of the seller or donor, or to or for such support, use or benefit—and also every devise of goods or chattels to or for the support, use or benefit of any minister, public teacher, or preacher of the gospel, as such, or any religious sect, order, or denomination, without the leave of the Legislature, shall be void; except always any sale, gift, lease or devise of any quantity of land, not exceeding two acres, for a church, meeting, or other house of worship, and for a burying-ground, which shall be improv∣ed,
<PB N="191" REF="033044_0189_0FF62E4FB6B9B460"/>enjoyed or used only for such purpose—or such sale, gift, lease, or devise, shall be void.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXV. That no other test or qualification ought to be required, on admission to any office of trust or prosit, than such oath of support and fidelity to this State, and such oath of office, as shall be directed by this Convention, or the Legislature of this State, and a declaration of a belief in the Christian religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXVI. That the manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> administering an oath to any person, ought to be such, as those of the religious persuasion, profession, or denomination, of which such per∣son is one, generally esteem the most effectual confirmation, by the attestation of the Divine Being. And that the people called Quakers, those called Dunkers, and those called Menonists, holding it unlawful to take an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th on any occasion, ought to be allowed to make their solemn affirmation, in the manner that Quakers have been hereto∣fore allowed to affirm; and to be of the same avail as an oath, in all such cases, as the affirmation of Quakers hath been allowed and accepted within this State, instead of an oath. And further, on such affirmation, warrants to search for stolen goods, or for the apprehension or commitment of offenders, ought to be granted, or security for the peace awarded, and Quakers, Dunkers or Menonists ought also, on their solemn affirmation as aforesaid, to be admitted as witnesses, in all criminal cases not capital.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXVII. That the city of Annapolis ought to have all its rights, privileges and benefits, agreeable to its Charter, and the acts of Assembly confirming and regulating the same, subject nevertheless to such alterations as may be made by this Convention, or any suture Legislature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXVIII. That the liberty of the press ought to be inviolably preserved.</ITEM>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>VIRGINIA.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>CONSTITUTION,</HI> or <HI>FORM</HI> of <HI>GOVERNMENT,</HI> agreed to, end r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solved upon by the Delegate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Repre∣sentatives of the several Counties and Corporations of <HI>VIR∣GINIA,</HI> in a General Convention, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d at Willi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sourgh, on the 6th of May, and continued, by adjournments, to the 5th of July, <HI>1776.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE, the Delegates and Representatives of the good people of Virginia, do declare the future form of government of Virginia to be as followeth:</P>
<P>The legislative, executive, and judiciary department, shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other: nor shall any per∣son exercise the powers of more than one of them, at the same time; except that the Justices of the County Courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.</P>
<P>The legislative shall be formed of two distinct branches, who, together, shall be a complete Legislature. They shall meet once, or oftener, every year, and shall be called, <HI>The General Assembly of Virginia.</HI> One of these shall be called, <HI>The House of Delegate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and consist of two Repre∣sentatives, to be chosen for each county, and for the dis∣trict of West-Augusta, annually, of such men as act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly reside in, and are freeholders of the same, or duly qualified according to law, and also of one Delegate or Represent∣ative, to be chosen annually for the city of Willi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ourgh, and one for the borough of Norfolk, and a Representative for each of such other cities and boroughs, as may here∣after be allowed particular representation by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>a∣ture; but when any city or borough shall so decrease, as that the number of persons, having right of suffrage therein,
<PB N="210" REF="033044_0208_0FF62E7AD225C468"/>shall have been, for the space of seven years successively, less than half the number of voters in some one county in Virginia, such city or borough thenceforward shall cease to send a Delegate or Representative to the Assembly.</P>
<P>The other shall be called <HI>The Senate,</HI> and consist of twenty-four members, of whom thirteen shall constitute a House to proceed on business; for whose election, the dif∣ferent counties shall be divided into twenty-four districts; and each county of the respective district, at the time of the election of its Delegates, shall vote for one Senator, who is actually a resident and freeholder within the district, or duly qualified according to law, and is upwards of twenty-five years of age; and the Sheriffs of each county, within five days at farthest, after the last county election in the district, shall meet at some convenient place, and from the poll, so taken in their respective counties, return, as a Senator, the man who shall have the greatest number of votes in the whole district. To keep up this Assembly by rotation, the dis∣tricts shall be equally divided into four classes and number∣ed by lot. At the end of one year after the general elec∣tion, the six members, elected by the first division, shall be displaced, and the vacancies thereby occasioned supplied from such class or division, by new election, in the manner aforesaid. This rotation shall be applied to each division, according to its number, and continued in due order annu∣ally.</P>
<P>The right of suffrage in the election of members for both Houses shall remain as exercised at present; and each House shall choose its own Speaker, appoint its own offi∣cers, settle its own rules of proceeding, and direct writs of election, for the supplying intermediate vacancies.</P>
<P>All laws shall originate in the House of Delegates, to be approved of or rejected by the Senate, or to be amended, with consent of the House of Delegates; except money-bills, which in no instance shall be altered by the Senate, but wholly approved or rejected.</P>
<P>A Governor, or chief magistrate, shall be chosen annu∣ally by joint ballot of both Houses (to be taken in each House respectively) deposited in the conference room; the boxes examined jointly by a committee of each House, and the numbers severally reported to them, that the appoint∣ments
<PB N="211" REF="033044_0209_0FF62E7DB9FFA800"/>may be entered (which shall be the mode of taking the joint ballot of both Houses, in all cases) who shall not continue in that office longer than three years successively, nor be eligible, until the expiration of four years after he shall have been out of that office. An adequate, but mod∣erate salary shall be settled on him, during his continuance in office; and he shall, with the advice of a Council of State, exxrcise the executive powers of government, ac∣cording to the laws of this Commonwealth; and shall not, under any pretence, exercise any power or prerogative, by virtue of any law, statute or custom of England. But he shall, with the advice of the Council of State, have the power of granting reprieves or pardons, except where the prosecution shall have been carried on by the House of Delegates, or the law shall otherwise particularly direct; in which cases, no reprieve or pardon shall be granted, but by resolve of the House of Delegates.</P>
<P>Either House of the General Assembly may adjourn themselves respectively. The Governor shall not prorogue or adjourn the Assembly, during their sitting, nor dissolve them at any time; but he shall, if necessary, either by ad∣vice of the Council of State, or on application of a majori∣ty of the House of Delegates, call them before the time to which they shall stand prorogued or adjourned.</P>
<P>A Privy Council, or Council of State, consisting of eight members, shall be chosen, by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, either from their own members or the people at large, to assist in the administration of government. They shall annually choose, out of their own members, a Presi∣dent, who, in case of death, inability, or absence of the Governor from the government, shall act as Lieutenant-Governor. Four members shall be sufficient to act, and their advice and proceedings shall be entered on record, and signed by the members present, (to any part whereof, any member may enter his dissent) to be laid before the General Assembly, when called for by them. This Coun∣cil may appoint their own Clerk, who shall have a salary settled by law, and take an oath of secrecy, in such matters as he shall be directed by the board to conceal. A sum of money, appropriated to that purpose, shall be divided annually among the members, in proportion to their attend∣ance;
<PB N="212" REF="033044_0210_0FF62E80193FD630"/>and they shall be incapable, during their continu∣ance in office, of sitting in either House of Assembly. Two members shall be removed, by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, at the end of every three years, and be ineli∣gible for the three next years. These vacancies, as well as those occasioned by death or incapacity, shall be supplied by new elections, in the same manner.</P>
<P>The Delegates for Virginia to the Continental Congress shall be chosen annually, or superseded in the mean time, by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly.</P>
<P>The present militia officers shall be continued, and va∣cancies supplied by appointment of the Governor, with the advice of the Privy-Council, on recommendations from the respective County Courts; but the Governor and Coun∣cil shall have a power of suspending any officer, and order∣ing a Court Martial, on complaint of misbehaviour or ina∣bility, or to supply vacancies of officers, happening when in actual service.</P>
<P>The Governor may embody the militia, with the advice of the Privy Council; and when embodied, shall alone have the direction of the militia, under the laws of the country.</P>
<P>The two Houses of Assembly shall, by joint ballot, ap∣point Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and Gen∣eral Court, Judges in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, Secretary, and the Attorney General, to be commissioned by the Governor, and continue in office during good beha∣viour. In case of death, incapacity, or resignation, the Governor, with the advice of the Privy Council, shall ap∣point persons to succeed in office, to be approved or dis∣placed by both Houses. These officers shall have fixed and adequate sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aries, and, together with all others hold∣ing lucrative offices, and all ministers of the gospel, of every denomination, be incapable of being elected mem∣bers of either House of Assembly or the Privy Council.</P>
<P>The Governor, with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advice of the Privy Council, shall appoint Justices of the Peace for the counties; and in case of vacancies, or a necessity of increasin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the num∣ber hereafter, such appointments to be made upon the rec∣ommendation of the respective County Courts. The present acting Secretary in Virginia, and Clerks of all the
<PB N="213" REF="033044_0211_0FF62E821225CC38"/>County Courts, shall continue in office. In case of vacan∣cies, either by death, incapacity, or resignation, a Secretary shall be appointed, as before directed; and the Clerks, by the respective Courts. The present and future Clerks shall hold their offices during good behaviour, to be judged of, and determined in the General Court. The Sheriffs and Coroners shall be nominated by the respective Courts, approved by the Governor, with the advice of the Privy Council, and commissioned by the Governor. The Jus∣tices shall appoint Constables; and all fees of the afore∣said officers be regulated by law.</P>
<P>The Governor, when he is out of office, and others, offending against the State, either by mal-administration, corruption, or other means, by which the safety of the State may be endangered, shall be impeachable by the House of Delegates. Such impeachment to be prosecuted by the Attorney-General, or such other person or persons, as the House may appoint in the General Court, according to the laws of the land. If found guilty, he or they shall be either forever disabled to hold any office under govern∣ment, or be removed from such office <HI>pro tempore,</HI> or sub∣jected to such pains or penalties as the laws shall direct.</P>
<P>If all or any of the Judges of the General Court should on good grounds (to be judged of by the House of Dele∣gates) be accused of any of the crimes or offences above mentioned, such House of Delegates may, in like man∣ner, impeach the Judge or Judges so accused, to be prose∣cuted in the Court of Appeals; and he or they, if found guilty, shall be punished in the same manner as is prescrib∣ed in the preceding clause.</P>
<P>Commissions and grants shall run, <HI>"In the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia,"</HI> and bear test by the Gov∣ernor, with the feal of the Commonwealth annexed. Writs shall run in the same manner, and bear test by the Clerks of the several Courts. Indictments shall conclude, <HI>"Against the place and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ity of the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>alth."</HI></P>
<P>A Treasurer shall be appointed annually, by joint ballot of both Houses.</P>
<P>All es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eats, penalties, and forfeitures, heretofore going to the King, shall go to the Commonw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lth, saw only such as the Legislature may abol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, or otherwise provide for.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="033044_0212_0FF62E4C1D47B270"/>
The territories, contained within the Charters, erecting the Colonies of Maryland, Pennsyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ania, North and South-Carolina, are hereby ceded, released, and forever confirm∣ed, to the people of these Colonies respectively, with all the rights of property, jurisdiction and government, and all other rights whatsoever, which might, at any time here∣tofore, have been claimed by Virginia, except the free navigation and use of the rivers Patomaque and Pokomoke, with the property of the Virginia shores and strands, bor∣dering on either of the said rivers, and all improvements, which have been, or shall be made thereon. The western and northern extent of Virginia shall, in all other respects, stand as sixed by the Charter of King James I. in the year one thousand six hundred and nine, and by the public treaty of peace between the Courts of Britain and France, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three; unless by act of this Legislature, one or more governments be established westward of the Alleghany mountains. And no purchases of lands shall be made of the Indian natives, but on behalf of the public, by authority of the General Assembly.</P>

<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>

<P N="5">V. That all powers of suspending laws, or the execu∣tion of laws, by any authority, without consent of the Rep∣resentatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That elections of members, to serve as Represent∣atives in General Assembly, ought to be free.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That, in all criminal prosecutions, every man has a right to be informed of the accusation against him, and to confront the accosers and witnesses with other testimony, and shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself.</P>

<P N="10">X. That excessive bail should not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That general warrants—whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>idence of the fact committed, or to seize any person or persons, not named, whose offences are not particularly described, and supported by evidence—are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That no freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or out∣lawed, or exiled or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the law of the land.</P>

<P N="14">XIV. That in all controversies at law, respecting prop∣erty, the ancient mode of trial, by jury, is one of the best securities of the rights of the people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable.</P>

<P N="24">XXIV. That retrospective laws, punishing facts com∣mitted before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incom∣patible with liberty; wherefore no <HI>ex post facto</HI> law ought to be made.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. The property of the soil, in a free government, being one of the essential rights of the collective body of the people, it is necessary, in order to avoid future disputes, that the limits of the State should be ascertained with pre∣cision: and as the former temporary line, between North and South Carolina, was confirmed, and extended by Com∣missioners, appointed by the Legislatures of the two States, agreeable to the order of the late King George II. in Council, that line, and that only, should be esteemed the southern boundary of this State—that is to say, beginning on the sea side, at a cedar stake, at or near the mouth of Little River (being the southern extremity of Brunswic county,) and running from thence a north west course, through the boundary house, which stands in thirty-three degrees fifty-six minutes, to thirty-five degrees north lati∣tude; and from thence a west course so far as is mention∣ed in the Charter of King Charles II. to the late Proprie∣tors of Carolina. Therefore all the territory, seas, waters, and harbours, with their appurtenances, lying between the line above described, and the southern line of the State of Virginia, which begins on the sea shore, in thirty-six de∣grees thirty minutes, north latitude, and from thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns
<PB N="218" REF="033044_0216_0FF62E8A95B90CE8"/>west, agreeable to the said Charter of King Charles, are the right and property of the people of this State, to be held by them in sovereignty; any partial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, without the con∣sent of the Legislature of this State, at any time thereafter directed, or laid out, in anywise notwithstanding:—<HI>Pro∣vided always,</HI> That this Declaration of Rights shall not prejudice any nation or nations of Indians, from enjoying such hunting-grounds as may have been, or hereafter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall be, secured to them by any former or future Legislature of this State:—<HI>And provided also,</HI> That it shall not be con∣strued so as to prevent the establishment of one or more governments westward of this State, by consent of the Legislature:—<HI>And provided further,</HI> That nothing herein contained shall affect the titles or possessions of individuals holding or claiming under the laws heretofore in force, or grants heretofore made by the late King George II. or his predecessors, or the late lords' proprietors, or any of them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> CONSTITUTION, <HI>or</HI> FORM <HI>of</HI> GOVERNMENT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS allegiance and protection are, in their nature, reciprocal, and the one should of right be refused when the other is withdrawn:</P>
<P>And whereas George the Third, King of Great Britain, and late Sovereign of the British American Colonies, hath-not only withdrawn from them his profection, but, by an act of the British Legislature, declared the inhabitants of these States out of the protection of the British crown, and all their property, found upon the high seas, liable to be seized and confiscated to the uses mentioned in the said act; and the said George the Third has also sent fleets and armies to prosecute a cruel war against them, for the purpose of reducing the inhabitants of the said Colonies to a state of abject slavery; in consequence whereof, all gov∣ernment under the said King, within the said Colonies, hath ceased, and a total dissolution of government in many of them hath taken place.</P>
<P>And whereas the Continental Congress, having consid∣ered the premises, and other previous violations of the rights
<PB N="219" REF="033044_0217_0FF62E8E199A90C0"/>of the good people of America, have therefore declared, that the Thirteen United Colonies are, of right, wholly absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, or any other foreign jurisdiction whatsoever; and that the said Colonies now are, and forever shall be, free and indepen∣dent States.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in our present state, in order to prevent anarchy and confusion, it becomes necessary, that govern∣ment should be established in this State; therefore we, the Representatives of the freemen of North-Carolina, chosen and assembled in Congress, for the express purpose of fram∣ing a Constitution, under the authority of the people, most conducive to their happiness and prosperity, do declare, that a government for this State shall be established, in mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and form following, to wit:</P>

<ITEM>VIII. That all freemen of the age of twenty-one years, who have been inhabitànts of any one county within the State twelve months immediately preceding the day of any election, and shall have paid public taxes, shall be entitled to vote for members of the House of Commons for the county in which he resides.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. That all persons possessed of a freehold in any town in this State, having a right of representation, and also all freemen, who have been inhabitants of any such town twelve months next before, and at the day of elec∣tion, and shall have paid public taxes, shall be entitled to vote for a member to represent such town in the House of Commons:—Provided always, That this section shall not entitle any inhabitant of such town to vote for members of the House of Commons, for the county in which he may reside, nor any freeholder in such county, who resides without or beyond the limits of such town, to vote for a member for said town.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. That the Senate and House of Commons, when met, shall each have power to choose a Speaker, and other their officers; be judges of the qualifications and elections of their members; sit upon their own adjournments from day to day; and prepare bills, to be passed into laws. The two Houses shall direct writs of election for supplying inter∣mediate vacancies; and shall also jointly, by ballot, adjourn themselves to any future day and place.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. That all bills shall be read three times in each House, before they pass into laws, and be signed by the Speakers of both Houses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII.

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>VERMONT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS all government ought to be instituted and supported for the security and protection of the community as such, and to enable the individuals, who com∣pose it, to enjoy their natural rights, and the other blessings which the Author of existence has bestowed upon man: and whenever those great ends of government are not ob∣tained, the people have a right, by common consent, to change it, and take such measures as to them may appear necessary, to promote their safety and happiness.</P>
<P>And whereas the inhabitants of this State have (in con∣sideration of protection only) heretofore acknowledged al∣legiance to the King of Great-Britain: and the said King has not only withdrawn that protection, but commenced and still continues to carry on, with unabated vengeance, a most cruel and unjust war against them; employing there∣in not only the troops of Great-Britain, but foreign merce∣naries, savages, and slaves, for the avowed purpose of re∣ducing them to a total and abject submission to the despotic domination of the British Parliament, with many more acts of tyranny, (more fully set forth in the Declaration of Con∣gress) whereby all allegiance and fealty to the said King and his Successors, are dissolved and at an end; and all power and authority derived from him ceased in the Amer∣ican Colonies. And whereas the Territory, which now comprehends the State of Vermont, did antecedently of right belong to the government of New-Hampshire, and the former Governor thereof, viz. his excellency Benning Wentworth, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> granted many charters of lands and cor∣porations within this State to the present inhabitants and others. And whereas the late Lieutenant-Governor Col∣den, of New York, with others, did, in violation of the tenth command, covet those very lands: and by a false
<PB N="247" REF="033044_0245_0FF62ECE0C143578"/>representation, made to the Court of Great-Britain, (in the year 1764, that for the convenience of trade and adminis∣tration of justice, the inhabitants were desirous of being an∣nexed to that government) obtained jurisdiction of those very identical lands, <HI>ex parte,</HI> which ever was and is disa∣greeable to the inhabitants. And whereas the Legislature of New-York ever have, and still continue to disown the good people of this State, in their landed property, which will appear in the complaints hereafter inserted, and in the 36th section of their present Constitution, in which is estab∣lished the Grants of Land made by that government.</P>
<P>They have refused to make re-grants of our lands to the original Proprietors and Occupants, unless at the exorbi∣tant rate of 2,300 dollars fees for each township; and did enhance the quitrent three-fold, and demanded an immedi∣ate delivery of the title derived from New-Hampshire.</P>
<P>The Judges of their Supreme Court have made a sol∣emn declaration, that the charters, conveyances, &amp;c. of the lands included in the before-described premises, were ut∣terly null and void, on which said title was founded. In consequence of which declaration, writs of possession have been by them issued, and the Sheriff of the county of Al∣bany sent at the head of six or seven hundred men, to en∣force the execution thereof.</P>
<P>They have passed an act, annexing a penalty thereto, of thirty pounds' fine, and six months' imprisonment, on any person who should refuse assisting the Sheriff, after being requested, for the purpose of executing writs of possession.</P>
<P>The Governors Dunmore, Tryon, and Colden, have made re-grants of several tracts of land included in the premises, to certain favourite land jobbers in the government of New-York, in direct violation of his Britannic Majesty's express prohibition, in the year 1767.</P>
<P>They have issued proclamations, wherein they have of∣fered large sums of money for the purpose of apprehending those very persons, who have dared boldly and publickly to appear in defence of their just rights.</P>
<P>They did pass twelve acts of outlawry on the ninth day of March, A. D. 1774, empowering the respective Judges of their Supreme Court to award execution of death against those inhabitants in said district, that they should judge to be offenders, without trial.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="033044_0246_0FF62ECFD021DA30"/>
They have and still continue an unjust claim to those lands, which greatly retards emigration into any settlement of this State.</P>
<P>They have hired foreign troops, emigrants from Scot∣land, at two different times, and armed them to drive us out of possession.</P>
<P>They have sent the Savages on our frontiers to distress us.</P>
<P>They have proceeded to erect the counties of Cum∣berland and Gloucester, and establish courts of justice there, after they were discountenanced by the authority of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The free Convention of the State of New-York, at Har∣lem, in the year 1776, unanimously voted, "That all quit∣rents, formerly due to the King of Great-Britain, are now due, and owing to this Convention, or such future govern∣ment as shall be hereafter established in this State."</P>
<P>In the several stages of the aforesaid oppressions, we have petitioned his Britannic Majesty in the most humble manner for redress, and have, at very great expense, re∣ceived several reports in our favour: and in other instances, wherein we have petitioned the late legislative authority of New-York, those petitions have been treated with ne∣glect. And whereas, the local situation of this State from New-York, which, at the extreme part, is upward of four hundred and fifty miles from the seat of that government, renders it extreme difficult to continue under the juris∣diction of said State;</P>
<P>Therefore it is absolutely necessary, for the welfare and safety of the inhabitants of this State, that it should be henceforth a free and independent State, and that a just, permanent, and proper form of government should exist in it, derived from and founded on the authority of the peo∣ple only, agreeable to the direction of the honourable American Congress.</P>
<P>We the Representatives of the freemen of Vermont, in General Convention met, for the express purpose of form∣ing such a government—confessing the goodness of the great Governor of the universe (who alone knows to what degree of earthly happiness mankind may attain by per∣fecting the arts of government) in permitting the people
<PB N="249" REF="033044_0247_0FF62ED16B7E1820"/>of this State, by common consent, and without violence, deliberately to form for themselves such just rules as they shall think best, for governing their future society; and be∣ing fully convinced, that it is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r indispensable duty to es∣tablish such original principles of government as will best promote the general happiness of the people of this State, and their posterity, and provide for future improvements, without partiality for, or prejudice against, any particular class, sect, or denomination of men whatever; do, by vir∣tue of authority vested in us by our constituents, ordain, declare and establish the following Declaration of Rights, and Frame of Government, to be the Constitution of this Commonwealth, and to remain in force therein forever un∣altered, except in such articles as shall hereafter on expe∣rience be found to require improvement, and which shall, by the same authority of the people, fairly delegated, as this Frame of Government directs, be amended or improv∣ed, for the more effectual obtaining and securing the great end and design of all government, herein before mentioned.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> A <HI>DECLARATION</HI> of the <HI>RIGHTS</HI> of the <HI>IN∣HABITANTS</HI> of the <HI>STATE</HI> of <HI>VERMONT.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights; amongst which are, the enjoying and defending life and liberty—acquiring, possessing and protecting property—and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. Therefore, no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law to serve any person, as a servant, slave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years; unless they are bound by their own consent after they arrive to such age; or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.</P>
<P N="2">II. That private property ought to be subservient to pub∣lic uses, when necessity requires it; nevertheless, when∣ever
<PB N="250" REF="033044_0248_0FF62ED489B69668"/>any particular man's property is taken for the use of the public, the owner ought to receive an equivalent in money.</P>
<P N="3">III. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences and understandings, as in their opin∣ion shall be regulated by the word of God; and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any re∣ligious worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any minister, contrary to the dictates of his conscience; nor can any man be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worship; and that no authority can, or ought to be vested in, or assumed by any power whatsoever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conscience, in the free exercise of religious worship: Nev∣ertheless, every sect or denomination of Christians ought to observe the Sabbath or Lord's day, and keep up some sort of religious worship, which to them shall seem most agree∣able to the revealed will of God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Every person within this Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in his person, property, or character: he ought to obtain right and justice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it—completely, and without any denial—promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="5">V. That the people of this State, by their legal repre∣sentatives, have the sole, exclusive and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That all power being originally inherent in, and consequently derived from the people; therefore, all officers of government, whether legislative or executive, are their trustees and servants, and at all times, in a legal way, accountable to them.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation, or community, and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any single man, family, or set of men, who are a part only of that community: and that the commu∣nity hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right, to reform or alter government, in such manner as shall be,
<PB N="251" REF="033044_0249_0FF62ED6A057DC88"/>by that community, judged to be most conducive to the public weal.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That those who are employed in the legislative and executive business of the State may be restrained from oppression, the people have a right, by their legal represen∣tatives, to enact laws for reducing their public officers to a private station, and for supplying their vacancies in a con∣stitutional manner, by regular elections, at such periods as they may think proper.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That all elections ought to be free and without corruption; and that all freemen, having a sufficient evi∣dent common interest with, and attachment to the commu∣nity, have a right to elect officers, and be elected into office.</P>
<P N="10">X. That every member of society hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property; and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expense of that protection, and yield his personal service, when necessary, or an equivalent thereto: but no part of a man's property can be justly taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of the repre∣sentative body of the freemen; nor can any man, who is conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, be justly com∣pelled thereto, if he will pay such equivalent; nor are the people bound by any law, but such as they have in like manner assented to, for their common good. And previ∣ous to any law being made to raise a tax, the purpose, for which it is to be raised ought to appear evident to the Le∣gislature to be of more service to the community, than the money would be if not collected.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That in all prosecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel— to demand the cause and nature of his accusation—to be confronted with the witnesses—to call for evidence in his favour, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous consent of which jury he cannot be found guilty—nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself—nor can any man be justly de∣prived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That the people have a right to hold themselves, their houses, papers and possessions, free from search or seizure: and therefore warrants, without oaths or affirma∣tions
<PB N="252" REF="033044_0250_0FF62ED8599E1EE8"/>first made, affording sufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any per∣son or persons, his, her or their property not particularly described, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That no warrant or writ to attach the person or estate of any freeholder within this State, shall be issued in civil action, without the person or persons, who may re∣quest such warrant or attachment, first make oath, or affirm before the authority who may be requested to issue the same, that he or they are in danger of losing his, her, or their debts.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That when an issue in fact, proper for the cog∣nizance of a jury, is joined in a court of law, the parties have a right to a trial by jury; which ought to be held sacred.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That the people have a right of fredom of speech and of writing and publishing their sentiments, concerning the transactions of government—and therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The freedom of deliberation, speech, and debate, in the legislature, is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accusation or prose∣cution, action or complaint, in any other court or place whatsoever.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, ought never to be exercised, but by the Legislature, or by authority derived from it, to be exercised in such particular cases only as the Legislature shall expressly pro∣vide for.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defence of themselves and the State: and as stand∣ing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by the civil power.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That no person in this Commonwealth can, in any case, be subjected to law-martial or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army, and the militia in actual service.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="253" REF="033044_0251_0FF62EDB42906AF8"/>
XX. That frequent recurrence to fundamental princi∣ples, and a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temper∣ance, industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary to pre∣serve the blessings of liberty, and keep government free; the people ought therefore to pay particular attention to these points, in the choice of officers and representatives; and have a right, in a legal way, to exact a due and con∣stant regard to them, from their legislators and magistrates, in the making and executing such laws as are necessary for the good government of the State.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That all people have a natural and inherent right to emigrate from one State to another, that will receive them; or to form a new State in vacant countries, or in such countries as they can purchase, whenever they think that thereby they can promote their own happiness.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. That the people have a right to assemble togeth∣er, to consult for their common good—to instruct their re∣presentatives, and to apply to the Legislature for redress of grievances, by address, petition or remonstrance.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. That no person shall be liable to be transported out of this State, for trial for any offence committed within the same.</P>

<P N="6">VI. The legislative, executive and judiciary depart∣ments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other.</P>
<P N="7">VII.

And if there be no choice made, then the Council and General Assembly, by their joint ballot, shall make choice of a Governor.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-Governor and Treasurer shall be cho∣sen in the manner above directed. And each freeman shall give in twelve votes for twelve Counsellors, in the same
<PB N="256" REF="033044_0254_0FF62EE311F50BC0"/>manner: and the twelve highest in nomination shall serve for the ensuing year as counsellors.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Governor, and in his absence, the Lieuten∣ant-Governor, with the Council, (a major part of whom, including the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor, shall be a quorum to transact business) shall have power to com∣missionate all officers—and also to appoint officers, except where provision is or shall be otherwise made by law, or this frame of government; and shall supply every vacancy in any office occasioned by death or otherwise, until the office can be filled in the manner directed by law or this Constitution. They are to correspond with other States—transact business with officers of government, civil and mil∣itary, and to prepare such business as may appear to them necessary to lay before the General Assembly. They shall sit as Judges to hear and determine on impeachments, tak∣ing to their assistance, for advice only, the Judges of the Supreme Court; and shall have power to grant pardons, and remit sines in all cases whatsoever, except in treason and murder, in which they shall have power to grant re∣prieves, but not to pardon, until after the end of the next session of Assembly, and except in cases of impeachment, in which there shall be no remission or mitigation of pun∣ishment, but by act of legislation.

<P>You — do solemnly swear, (or affirm) that, as a member of this Assembly, you will not propose or assent to any bill, vote, or resolution, which shall appear to you injurious to the people; nor do nor consent to any act or thing whatever, that shall have a tendency to lessen or abridge their rights and privileges as declared by the Constitution of this State; but will, in all things, conduct yourself as a faithful, honest representative and guardian of the people, according to the best of your judgment and abilities. (In case of an oath) So help you God. (And in case of an affirmation) Under the pains and penalties of perjury.</P>
<P>And each member, before he takes his seat, shall make and subscribe the following declaration, viz.</P>
<P>You do believe in one God, the Creator and Governor of the Universe, the rewarded of the good, and punisher of the wicked. And you do acknowledge the scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by divine in∣spiration; and own and profess the Protestant religion.</P>
<P>And no further or other religious test shall ever here∣after be required of any civil officer or magistrate, in this State.</P>

XIII. The doors of the House, in which the Gen∣eral Assembly of this Commonwealth shall sit, shall be open for the admission of all persons who behave decently, ex∣cept only when the welfare of the State may require them to be shut.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The votes and proceedings of the General As∣sembly shall be printed (when one third of the members think it necessary) as soon as conveniently may be, after the end of each session, with the yeas and nays on any question, when required by any member, (except where the votes shall be taken by ballot) in which case every member shall have a right to insert the reasons of his vote upon the minutes.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The style of laws of this State, in future to be passed, shall be, <HI>It is hereby enacted by the General As∣sembly of the State of Vermont.</HI></P>

Provided, that if the Governor and Council shall neglect or refuse to return any such bill to the Assembly with written proposals of amendment, within five days, or before the rising of the Legislature, the same shall become a law.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. No person ought, in any case, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treason or felony by the Legislature.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII.

<P>You solemnly swear, (or affirm) that whenever you give your vote or suffrage, touching any matter that concerns
<PB N="259" REF="033044_0257_0FF62EEB0FBCEE40"/>the State of Vermont, you will do it so as in your con∣science you shall judge will most conduce to the best good of the same, as established by the Constitution, without fear or favour of any man.</P>

<P N="21">XXI. Every officer of State, whether judicial or ex∣ecutive, shall be liable to be impeached by the General Assembly, either when in office, or after his resignation, or removal for mal-administration. All impeachments shall be before the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor, and Coun∣cil, who shall bear and determine the same, and may award costs.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. As every freeman, to preserve his independ∣ence, (if without a sufficient estate) ought to have some profession, calling, trade, or farm, whereby he may hon∣estly subsist, there can be no necessity for, nor use in estab∣lishing offices of profit, the usual effects of which are de∣pendence and servility, unbecoming freemen, in the posses∣sors or expectants, faction, contention, corruption and dis∣order among the people. But if any man is called into public service, to the prejudice of his private affairs, he has a right to a reasonable compensation: and whenever an of∣fice, through increase of fees or otherwise, becomes so prof∣itable as to occasion many to apply for it, the profits ought to be lessened by the Legislature. And if any officer shall take greater or other fees than the laws allow him, either directly or indirectly, it shall ever after disqualify him from holding any office in this State.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="260" REF="033044_0258_0FF62EED49D6A570"/>
XXIII. No person in this State shall be capable of holding or exercising more than one of the following of∣fices at the same time, viz.

<P N="26">XXVI. Every officer, whether judicial, executive, or military, in authority under this State, before he enter upon the execution of his office, shall take and subscribe the fol∣lowing oath or affirmation of allegiance to this State, (un∣less he shall produce evidence that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has before taken the same) and also the following oath or affirmation of office, (except such as shall be exempted by the Legislature) viz.</P>
<P><HI>The oath or affirmation of allegiance.</HI></P>
<P>You do solemnly swear, (or affirm) that you will be true and faithful to the State of Vermont; and that you will not, directly nor indirectly, do any act or thing injurious to the Constitution or government thereof, as established by Convention.

<P N="29">XXIX. All prosecutions shall commence by the au∣thority of the Sate of Vermont—all indictments shall con∣clude with these words, <HI>Against the peace and dignity of the State.</HI> And all fines shall be proportionate to the offences.</P>

The person of a debtor, where there is not strong presumption of fraud, shall not be continued in prison after delivering up and assigning over, <HI>bona fide,</HI> all his estate, real and personal, in possession, reversion, or remain∣der, for the use ose of his creditors, in such manner as shall be hereafter regulated by law.

<P N="34"><PB N="262" REF="033044_0260_0FF62EF2009E5EF8"/>
XXXIV. To deter more effectually from the com∣mission of crimes, by continued visible punishment, of long duration, and to make sanguinary punishment less necessary, means ought to be provided for punishing by hard labour, those who shall be convicted of crimes not capital, where∣by the criminal shall be employed for the benefit of the public, or for reparation of injuries done to private per∣sons: and all persons, at proper times, ought to be permit∣ted to see them at their labour.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. The estates of such persons as may destroy their own lives, shall not for that offence be forfeited, but descend or ascend in the same manner as if such persons had died in a natural way.

<P N="9">IX. That in all criminal prosecutions, the accused hath a right to be heard by himself, and his counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof; to meet the witnesses face to face; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour; and in prosecutions by indictment, or present∣ment, a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the crime shall have been com∣mitted; and shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OF <HI>KENTUCKEY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE, the Representatives of the People of the State of Kentuckey, in Convention assembled, do or∣dain and establish this Constitution for its Government.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>The powers of government shall be divided into three distinct Departments, each of them to be consided to a separate body of Magistracy, to wit, those which are Le∣gislative to one, those which are Executive to another, and those which are Judiciary to another.</P>
<P>No person, or collection of persons, being of one of these departments, shall exercise any power properly be∣longing to either of the others, except in the instances herein after expressly permitted.</P>
<P>The Legislative powers of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Sen∣ate and House of Representatives.</P>
<P>The Representatives shall be chosen annually, by the qualified electors of each county respectively, on the first Tuesday in May; but the several elections may be con∣tinued for three days, if, in the opinion of the presiding officer or officers, it shall be necessary, and no longer.</P>
<P>No person shall be a Representative, who shall not have attained the age of twenty-four years, and have been a citizen and inhabitant of the state two years preceding his election, and the last six mouths thereof an inhabitant of the county in which he may be chosen; unless he shall have been absent on the public business of the United States, or this state.</P>
<P>Within two years after the first meeting of the General Assembly, and within every subsequent term of four years,
<PB N="284" REF="033044_0282_0FF62F1C9ACA2398"/>an enumeration of the free male inhabitants above twenty-one years of age, shall be made in such manner as may be directed by law. The number of the Representatives shall, at the several periods of making such enumeration, be fix∣ed by the Legislature, and apportioned among the several counties, according to the number of free male inhabitants above the age of twenty-one years in each, and shall never be less than forty, nor greater than one hundred; but no county hereafter erected, shall be entitled to a separate rep∣resentation, until a sufficient number of free male inhabit∣itants above the age of twenty-one years, shall be contained within it, to entitle them to one Representative agreeable to the ratio which shall then be established.</P>
<P>The Senators shall be chosen for four years. Until the first enumeration be made, the Senate shall consist of eleven members, and thereafter for every four members added to the House of Representatives, one member shall be added to the Senate.</P>
<P>In choosing the Senate, one member at least shall be elected from each county, until the number of counties is equal to the number of Senators: after which, when a new county is made, it shall, as to the choice of Senators, be considered as being a part of the county or counties from which it shall have been taken.</P>
<P>The Senate shall be chosen in the following manner: All persons qualified to vote for Representatives, shall, on the first Tuesday in May, in the present year, and on the same day in every fourth year, forever thereafter, at the place appointed by law for choosing Representatives, elect by ballot, by a majority of votes, as many persons as they are entitled to have for Representatives for their respective counties, to be electors of the Senate.</P>
<P>No person shall be chosen an elector, who shall not have resided in the state three years next before his election, and who shall not have attained the age of twenty-seven years.</P>
<P>The electors of the Senate shall meet at such place as shall be appointed for convening the Legislature, on the third Tuesday in May, in the present year, and on the same day in every fourth year forever thereafter; and they, or a majority of them so met, shall proceed to elect by bal∣lot,
<PB N="285" REF="033044_0283_0FF62F1F5CC5FB68"/>as Senators, men of the most wisdom, experience and virtue, above twenty-seven years of age, who shall have been residents of the state above two whole years next pre∣ceding the election. If on the ballot two or more shall have an equal number of ballots in their favour, by which the choice shall not be determined by the first ballot, then the electors shall again ballot before they separate, in which they shall be confined to the persons, who on the first bal∣lot shall have had an equal number, and they who shall have the greatest number in their favour on the second ballot, shall be accordingly declared and returned duly elected; and if on the second ballot an equal number shall still be in favour of two or more persons, then the election shall be determined by lot, between those who have equal numbers; which proceedings of the electors shall be certi∣fied under their hands, and returned to the Secretary for the time being; to whom shall also be made by the proper officers, returns of the persons chosen as electors in the re∣spective counties.</P>
<P>The electors of Senators shall judge of the qualifications and elections of members of their body, and on a contest∣ed election, shall admit to a seat as an elector, such qualifi∣ed person as shall appear to them to have the greatest num∣ber of legal votes in his favour.</P>
<P>The electors, immediately on their meeting, and before they proceed to the election of Senators, shall take an oath or affirmation, to elect, without favour, affection, partiality, or prejudice, such person for Governor, and such persons for Senators, as they in their judgment and conscience be∣lieve best qualified for the respective offices.</P>
<P>That in case of refusal, death, resignation, disqualifica∣tion, or removal out of this state, of any Senator, the Sen∣ate shall immediately thereupon, or at their next meeting thereafter, elect, by ballot, in the same manner as the elec∣tors are herein directed to choose Senators, another per∣son in his place, for the residue of the said term of four years.</P>
<P>The General Assembly shall meet on the first Monday in November in every year, till the time of their meeting shall be altered by the Legislature, unless sooner convened by the Governor.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="033044_0284_0FF62F20E83B60A0"/>
Each House shall choose its Speaker and other officers, and the Senate shall also choose a Speaker, pro tempore, when their Speaker shall exercise the office of Governor.</P>
<P>Each House shall judge of the qualifications of its mem∣bers: contested elections shall be determined by a com∣mittee to be selected, formed and regulated, in such man∣ner as shall be directed by law. A majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorised by law to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner and under such penalties as may be provided.</P>
<P>Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behaviour, and with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member; but not a second time for the same cause.</P>
<P>Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and publish them weekly, except such parts of them as may re∣quire secrecy, and the yeas and nays of the members on any question, shall, at the desire of any two of them, be entered on the journals.</P>
<P>The doors of each House and of committees of the whole, shall be open, unless when the business shall be such as ought to be kept secret.</P>
<P>Neither House shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days; nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</P>
<P>The members of the General Assembly, and the electors of the Senate, shall receive from the Public Treasury, a compensation for their services, which for the present shall be six shillings a day during their attendance on, going to, and returning from the Legislature, and the place for choosing the Senators; but the same may be increased or diminished by law, if circumstances shall require it, but no alteration shall be made, to take effect during the existence of the Legislature, which shall make such alteration: They shall in all cases except treason, felony, breach or surety of the peace, be privileged from arrest, during their attend∣ance at the session of the respective Houses; and at the place for choosing Senators, and in going to and returning from the same: and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="033044_0285_0FF62F244C012690"/>
No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he shall have been elected, or for one year after∣wards, be appointed to any civil office under this State, which shall have been created, or the emoluments of which shall have been increased, during the time such Senator or Representative was in office: Provided that no member of the first Legislature which shall be assembled under this Constitution shall be precluded from being appointed to any office which may have been created, during his time of service in the said Legislature; and no Minister of re∣ligious society, member of Congress, or other person hold∣ing any office of profit under the United States, or this Commonwealth, except Attornies at Law, Justices of the Peace, Militia Officers and Coroners, shall be a member of either House, during his continuance to act as a minis∣ter, in Congress, or in office.</P>
<P>When vacancies happen in the House of Representatives, the Speaker shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.</P>
<P>All bills for raising Revenue, shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose amend∣ments as in other bills.</P>
<P>Each Senator, Representative and Sheriff shall, before he be permitted to act as such, take an oath, or make af∣firmation, that he hath not directly or indirectly given or promised any bribe or treat to procure his election to said office, and every person shall be disqualified from serving as a Senator, Representative or Sheriff, for the term for which he shall have been elected, who shall be convicted of having given or offered any bribe or treat, or canvassed for the said office.</P>
<P>Every bill which shall have passed both Houses, shall be presented to the Governor; if he approve, he shall sign it, but if he shall not approve, he shall return it with his ob∣jections, to the House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large upon their journals, and proceed to reconsider it; if after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent with the objections to the other House, by which likewise it shall be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall be a law: But in such cases, the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and
<PB N="288" REF="033044_0286_0FF62F25DC3461F8"/>nays, and the names of the persons voting for or against the bill, shall be entered on the journals of each House respectively; if any bill shall not be returned by the Gov∣ernor within ten days, Sundays excepted, after it shall have been presented to him, it shall be a law in like man∣ner as if he had signed it: unless the General Assembly by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall be a law, unless sent back within three days after their next meeting.</P>
<P>Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concur∣rence of both Houses may be necessary, except on a ques∣tion of adjournment, shall be presented to the Governor, and before it shall take effect, be approved by him; or being disapproved, shall be repassed by two thirds of both Houses, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in case of a bill.</P>
