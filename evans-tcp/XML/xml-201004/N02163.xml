<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sin of <HI>ONAN,</HI> and GOD's sudden Vengeance upon it, are so remarkable, that every Body will easily perceive, that from his Name I have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riv'd the running Title of this little Book; and tho' I treat of this Crime in Relation to <HI>Women,</HI> as well as <HI>Men,</HI> whilst the Offence, is <HI>SELF-POLLUTION</HI> in both, I could not think of any other Word which would so well put the Reader in Mind both of the <HI>Sin</HI> and its <HI>Punishment</HI> at once, as this.</P>
<P>THIS Practice is so frequent, and so crying an Offence, especially among the MALE YOUTH of this Nation, that I have Reason to imagine, a great many Offenders would never have been Guilty of it, if they had been thoroughly acquainted with the Heinousness of the Crime, and the sad Consequences to the BODY as well as the SOUL, which may, and often do ensue upon it. This was the chief Motive that induc'd me to write on this Subject.</P>
<P>THOSE who are of Opinion, that notwithstand∣ing the Frequency of this Sin, it never ought to be spoke of, or hinted at, because the bare mentioning of it may be dangerous to some, who without it, would never have thought of it, I hope will find themselves fully Answer'd.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002573_0004_0FDB15D5FB7688C0"/>AND as I am fully perswaded, that there are very few Sentences throughout the BOOK, which do not more or less tend to the Mortification of Lust, and not one that can give Offence to the chastest Ear, so I dare recommend the serious Perusal of it to both Sexes: And that it has been look'd upon as Instructive, without being hurtful, (by others as well as my self,) will appear from the following LETTER sent me by a very Learned and Pious Divine.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received the Favour of your little BOOK against SELF-POLLUTION, and have given it, as it deserv'd, a Second Reading. I am much pleas'd with your Arguments and Admonitions, which are both cogent and swasive, and I hope in GOD, will answer your Design by it, in doing a great deal of Good in the World, both to the SOUL and BODY, by awakening the Guilty, (who are <HI>Daily,</HI> and often∣times <HI>dangerously</HI> wounded by this foul Practice) and deterring the Innocent and Unwary from falling into it. Would all Masters of Schools have but a strict Eye over their Scholars; (amongst whom no∣thing is more common, than the Commission of this vile Sin, the Elder Boys Teaching it the Younger, as soon as ever they arrive to the Years of Puberty) tell them the Heinousness of the Sin, and give sui∣table Correction to the Offenders therein, and shame them before their School-Fellows for it; <HI>[or rather privately reprove and admonish them of the Sin and Danger]</HI> I am perswaded it would deter them from the Practice, and by that means save them from Ruin; Thousands of the Youth of this King∣dom Learning it there, who probably might never have known it elsewhere.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Bought your Author's BOOK call'd <HI>ONANIA,</HI> which I take to be the Best ever Wrote on that Subject. I have read the Learned <HI>Ostervald</HI> upon <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> and other Pious Authors, but they all fall short of what this explains in being the fatal Consequences of that vile Practice, which is really a Service to the World, and what I shall im∣prove to Advantage in the Capacity I stand, not only as a CLERGY-MAN, but a SCHOOL-MASTER; and I hope others of my Function, will do the same, as now they have the Opportunity of this useful BOOK put into their Hands. To me it seems to be Wrote by one of my own Cloth, but be it by whom it will, it is a necessary and much wanted Discourse, to deter all, Youth more especially, from that wicked Practice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the HEINOUS SIN of <HI>SELF-POLLUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SELF POLLUTION is that unnatural Practice, by which Persons of either Sex, may defile their own Bodies, without the Assistance of others, whilst yielding to filthy Imaginations, they endeavour to imitate and procure to themselves that Sensation, which God has order'd to attend the carnal Commerce of the two Sexes, for the continuance of our Species.</P>
<P>IT is almost impossible to treat of this Subject so as to be understood by the meanest Capacities, without trespassing at the same time against the Rules of De∣cency, and making Use of Words and Expressions which Modesty forbids us to utter. But as my great Aim is to promote Vertue and Christian Purity, and to discourage Vice and Uncleanness, without giving Offence to any, I shall chuse rather to be less intelli∣gible to some, and leave several things to the Consi∣deration of my Readers, than by being too plain, run the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zard of raising in some corrupt Minds, what I would most endeavour to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fie and destroy: And that every Body, who would write profitably against any sort of Uncleanness whatever, and not do more
<PB N="2" REF="002573_0008_0FDB15D864813ED0"/>
Harm than Good by his Endeavours, ought to be very careful and circumspect as to this Particular, we may learn from Bishop <HI>Taylor</HI> in his Rules and Exercises of <HI>Holy Living: 'Tis too plain,</HI> says that Learned Pre∣late, <HI>that there are some Spirits so Atheistical, and some so wholly possess'd with a Spirit of Un∣cleanness, that they turn the most prudent and chaste Discourses into Dirt and filthy Apprehen∣sions; like Cholerick Stomachs, changing their very Cordials and Medicines into Bitterness, and in a literal sense, turning the Grace of God into Wan∣tonness. They study Cases of Conscience</HI> (as he pro∣ceeds) <HI>in the Case of carnal Sins, not to avoid, but to learn Ways how to offend God, and pollute their own Spirits, and search their Houses with a Sun-Beam, that they may be instructed in all the Cor∣ners of Nastiness.</HI></P>
<P>I am perswaded, that those who have defil'd them∣selves by this Practice already, or else by wicked Thoughts are tempted so to do, must understand what I mean by SELF-POLLUTION, as I have defin'd it, without any farther Interpretation. To them it is that I chiefly recommend these Pages, with my hearty Desire of their most serious Consideration on what is contain'd in them: And as to such who never con∣tracted this Guilt, and being perhaps of small Expe∣rience may be wholly ignorant of the Sin I would warn them against, I think them happy in their Inno∣cence; assuring them withal, that they shall meet here with nothing but what shall more and more in∣cite them to Chastity, and deter them from all man∣ner of Uncleanness.</P>
<P>SELF-POLLUTION we see remarkably punish'd in <HI>Onan,</HI> by a particular Stroke from Almighty God, for it is not to be thought that his Guilt lay totally in
<PB N="3" REF="002573_0009_0FDB1622CF073E88"/>
not raising up Seed to his Deceased Brother <HI>Er,</HI> tho' we'll own that this was an aggravation of it, but the Way he took to prevent it would have been highly culpable at any other Time; and from the Words of the Text, which informs us of this Part of Sacred History, it is reasonable to imagine, that the greatest Part of the Offence lay in the act of defiling himself, rather than in the Neglect of his Duty; <HI>the thing which he</HI> Did <HI>displeased the Lord, wherefore he slew him also,</HI> Gen. 38. ver. 10. It was therefore the thing he <HI>Did,</HI> rather than the thing he omitted, which most displeas'd the Lord, as may be further seen in, <HI>Deut.</HI> Chap. 25. from ver. 5, <HI>to</HI> 10. Be that as it will, this is certain, that as it was, it prov'd so in∣tollerable a Provocation, that Almighty God could not bear with it, and therefore immediately cut him off by Reason of it.</P>
<P>SOME easy Casuists notwithstanding the Exem∣plary Punishment that has attended this Sin, have made slight of it, and shamefully deceiv'd those who con∣sulted them, several of them perhaps to their Ruin. Others, by being too open though severe enough, have treated this matter so grosly in the learned Lan∣guages, that it is impossible to translate any part of them, wihout offending Chastity.</P>
<P>THE Learned <HI>Ostervald,</HI> in his useful Treatise on Uncleanness in all its Branches, has through an excess of Modesty, pass'd over this abominable Sort of Im∣purity in Silence, or at least spoke of it in such gene∣ral Terms, blending it with lesser Trespasses of Un∣cleanness, that he has fail'd of Representing the Hei∣nousness that is in it. Having hinted at the Sins of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and spoke at large of <HI>Adultery</HI> and <HI>Forni∣cation,</HI> he adds, <HI>That, besides those, there are many Actions contrary to Modesty and Chastity, some
<PB N="4" REF="002573_0010_0FDB15EEAACF1B40"/>
whereof,</HI> says he, <HI>by the Violence of the Passion, and full Consent of the Will, or by Reason of the Ma∣lignity and Infamy of the Action, almost equal the Crime to which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y tend; for some un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hast Per∣sons are hurried by their Lust, to try in every thing to gratify their Brutal Passion, as far as they can conceive to do it, without committing the Fact. But here,</HI> continues he, <HI>I must be very wary, and leave to my Readers, the Trouble of considering with them∣selves, what I may not say, and apply to all the Actions of Impurity, what I may but just touch upon very briefly, and only in general Terms</HI> — And lower he says, <HI>Now forasmuch as I cannot well repeat all those Actions which are hurtful to Purity, and yet my Readers may be doubtful of some of them, and may question whether this or that be un∣lawful, I shall lay down this one general Rule in this Place, whereby these Doubts may be easily resolv'd. Let Natural Chastity and Modesty be first consul∣ted; because, provided a Habit of Wickedness has not quite extinguish'd in us the sense of Modesty, which is natural to us as Men, we shall readily discern whether an Action be unchaste or no. Next; this principle is to be attended to, that a Christian is bound to shun whatever sensualizes the Soul, whatever tends only to satisfie the Passions, and whatever is wont to excite them in us, or other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND again, Enquiry should be made what is necessary, or at least, what is expresly allowed. I say then, that whensoever we are asham'd of what we do, and dare not venture upon it in the sight of others, when it is only the Effect of a disorderly Passion, and aims only at indulging Sensuality, and kindling impure Desires, either in our own, or others Hearts; and when moreover it is neither ne∣cessary nor expresly allow'd, we should be sure to ab∣stain from it.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002573_0011_0FDB1627CA412328"/>THIS is admirable Advice, and excludes not the least Act of Impurity; but there is wanting that Hor∣ror, with which the Reader ought to be fill'd against SELF POLLUTION, above other Acts of Unclean∣ness less criminal. But that this Author only forbore to pronounce his just Censure against this sort of Im∣purity in particular, for no other Reason than his be∣ing too scrupulously modest, is manifest from his own Confession, that he was forc'd to be defective in many particulars. <HI>Some Points,</HI> says he, in his Preface, <HI>should have been more enlarg'd upon; and some Ob∣jections more particularly consider'd; but this would have necessitated me to touch up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n some Things, which Decency forbids. There are also divers Things, which I am obliged to express only in general Terms; others which I dare but just hint; and others again that I am forc'd totally to suppress.</HI>—</P>
<P>THERE have been other Casuists again, who treating of this Subject, have been neither too plain, nor too remiss, but by too much Subtilty strain'd their Arguments beyond their natural Force, and done an In∣jury to Truth and good Sense, by being too Sophistical. One of these having premised, that Lusts of Unclean∣ness are committed first with ones self: Secondly with others, expresses himself in the manner following: <HI>First,</HI> says he, <HI>we will begin with those committed with ones self, which are greater in themselves (ab∣stract them from all other Circumstances) than with any other, as Self-Murder is worse than the Murder of any other; so in and of it self, this is worse than polluting of another. For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ule is, that the Sin that doth break the Order of Love most is the worst, Love being the keeping of the Commandments. I must not defile my Neighbour, because I am to love my Neighbour's Chastity, but I am to love my self, and
<PB N="6" REF="002573_0012_0FDB15F0337854A0"/>
my own Chastity, before the Chastity of any else; and this is a foul Sin, much against Nature, and there∣fore the worse; for the more unnatural the Sin is, the greater the Guilt is still in that respect; and whereas it is thought, that there is not that wrong in it, as in taking away the Chastity of another, I urge it, that there is most Wrong when a Man doth Wrong to himself; and as the Thief doth in the Can∣dle, so these Self-Defilements do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot and weaken the Body by the Curse of God exceedingly. Besides, (as in all such inordinate Practices) there is a secret kind of Murder, what if not in the intention of the Doer, yet in the Condition of the thing done; wherefore God is much displeased with these kind of Sins.</HI>—</P>
<P>TO all the latter Part of these Assertions I could readily agree; but in the beginning of them this Casuist hath been grosly overseen in his way of Rea∣soning. The Difference he states between the Murder of another, and that of ones self, is very just; but then he has forgot to consider, that that difference ceases, when the Murder of another necessarily includes the Murder of ones self: Thus by endeavouring to prove too much, his Argument has not proved what it might have done. At this rate, SELF-POLLUTI∣ON would be more criminal than the most unnatural Abomination with others, which is false, because it is impossible to defile others without defiling ones self at the same time in as high a Degree.</P>
<P>TO condemn and expose a Sin so displeasing to God, so detrimental to the Publick, and so injurious to our selves, requires no Flights of Wit, nor any other way of arguing, than what is agreeable to the plainest Truth, and can stand the Test of the severest Reason. To prove the many Injuries it may do to our selves, as it is the whole Business of the next Chapter, so I refer
<PB N="7" REF="002573_0013_0FDB1629FB0BFF50"/>
the Reader to it; and that it is very detrimental to the Publick, will soon appear, if we consider what is undeniable, that it hinders Marriage, and puts a full stop to Procreation. What remains, is to demonstrate, that it is displeasing to God; and that it is so in a very high Degree, is evident both from the Holy Scripture, and our own Reason.</P>
<P>THERE is not a Place either in the Old or New Testament, where Uncleanness, the Lusts of the Flesh, or the Abominations of <HI>Sodom</HI> are condemn'd, but this Sin is hinted at among others; and there is no doubt, but those who are guilty of it, are compre∣hended among the Abominable, <HI>who shall have their Part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brimstone,</HI> Rev. 21. v. 8. <HI>What! know ye not,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul, that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God?</HI> And this is a very powerful Consideration to disswade from Uncleanness, being taken from the Glory where∣to God has rais'd us, even in regard as to our Bodies. They are the Temples of the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit dwells in us, and pours forth his Be∣nefits upon us, sanctifies us, and consecrates us to the Service of God; wherefore our Bodies partaking of this Honour, we are bound to preserve them in purity, and to employ them to holy Purposes; for if the Tem∣ples dedicated to the Worship of God, may not be prophan'd by any POLLUTION, but must be kept pure and undefiled, how great ought the Holiness of our Bodies to be, seeing God has condescended to make them the Temples of His Holy Spirit? This Reflection of St. <HI>Paul</HI> lets us see plainly, that when∣ever any give themselves over to Uncleanness, they cease to be the Temples of the Holy Spirit, just as the Apostle had said before, that they cease to
<PB N="8" REF="002573_0014_0FDB15F207D32898"/>
be the Members of Jesus Christ, which shews this Sin to be the Occasion that the Holy Spirit of God withdraws from the Hearts of such as are guilty of it, because his Spirit cannot dwell with POLLUTION. He tells us afterwards in the same Chapter, <HI>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a Price, there∣fore glorifie God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits which are God's.</HI></P>
<P>THE same Apostle affirms of the Heathens, <HI>that being given up to Uncleanness, they dishonoured their own Bodies between themselves.</HI> And in another Place, <HI>that it is the Will of God, that we abstain from Uncleanness.</HI> But it would be endless to quote all the Texts, which tend to the same Purpose. Let any Man examine all the Places of the New Testament, where mention is made of Vices and Sins, and he will find, there is not any one other Crime so many times named as Uncleanness; and how can a Person be more superlatively unclean, than when he is guilty of SELF-POLLUTION.</P>
<P>BUT if it was not reveal'd to us that God is highly offended at all manner of Uncleanness; when we reflect on the End of Marriage in all Countries, and in all Societies, and the manner after which God has ordain'd that our Species should be continu'd, na∣tural Religion, and our own Reason would in∣struct us, that to destroy that End, must be very offensive to God, if there is one; for whether we commit Abomination with those of our own Sex, as the Scripture says, <HI>Men with Men;</HI> or with Beasts; or that we defile our own Bodies our selves with this shameful Action, the Consequences are the same to the Society and our Species; and what a learned Divine has said of the first, is equally ap∣plicable
<PB N="9" REF="002573_0015_0FDB162B0B2B40C0"/>
to all three, <HI>That the Crime in it self is monstrous and unnatural; in its Practice filthy and odious to Extremity; its Guilt is crying, and its Consequences ruinous; It destroys conjugal Affecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, perverts natural Inclination, and tends to extinguish the Hopes of Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>FOR <HI>Fornication</HI> and <HI>Adultery</HI> it self, tho' hei∣nous Sins, we have Frailty and Nature to plead; but SELF-POLLUTION is a Sin, not only against N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ture, but a Sin, that perverts and extinguishes Nature, and he who is guilty of it, is la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouring at the De∣struction of his Kind, and in a manner strikes at the Creation it self. That this Sin, and all the Mischiefs that may attend it, are equally ruinous in either Sex, in regard to the civil Society, as well as themselves, shall be demonstrated in the following Chapter. In the Remainder of this, I shall examine into the Cau∣ses of SELF-POLLUTION, and offer some Thoughts to prevent at least the Frequency of it.</P>
<P>I Shall not here meddle with the Causes of Un∣cleanness in general, such as <HI>Ill-Books, Bad Compa∣nions, Love-Stories, Lascivious Discourses,</HI> and other Provocatives to <HI>Lust</HI> and <HI>Wantonness;</HI> as these are sufficiently treated of in most Books of Devotion and Practical Divinity, so I refer the Reader to them, and design only to speak of those peculiar Causes, which belong to this Sin, and hardly any other.</P>
<P>THE first Cause is Ignorance: There are Thou∣sands among the Youth of both Sexes <HI>Ingenious, Docile, Diligent,</HI> and <HI>Tractable,</HI> who either by the Example of their Intimates; through their own Wan∣tonness; or by being idle and alone; and some by meer Accident, have learn'd to Pollute themselves
<PB N="10" REF="002573_0016_0FDB15F5D3070478"/>
after this manner, that would have abhorred the Thoughts, had they understood the Nature of the Sin, and been acquainted with the Heinousness of the Crime. There are likewise many adult Persons, both Men and Women, who are guilty of this Sin, and perhaps Reprobates enough to Commit any, as to Religious Fears, that would never have ventur'd upon this, if they had known what Bodily Suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rings and Infirmities it may be, and often is the Occasion of.</P>
<P>THE Second, is the Secrecy, with which SELF-POLLUTION may be committed: All other Actions of Uncleanness must have a Witness, this needs none. Some lustful Women of Sense, have made all the outward Shew of Virtue and Morality that can be required; they have had Prudence enough, in the midst of strong Desires, to refuse disadvantageous Matches, and yet have abandon'd themselves to this Vice, when at the same time, they would rather have died, than betray'd a Weakness to any Man living, as afterwards becoming Penitents they have confess'd themselves. And again some young Men of vicious Inclinations, have either naturally, or for want of a liberal Education, been shamefac'd to Excess; they have not dar'd to look upon a Woman, and their Bash∣fulness has secur'd them from every Act of Impurity, but This. From all which, it is evident, that the Secrecy of this Sin has betray'd many into it, whom hardly any thing else would have tempted.</P>
<P>THE third and last Cause I shall alledge, is Im∣punity. Tho' the Laws against <HI>Fornication</HI> and <HI>A∣dultery,</HI> are in many Places either very remiss, or ill executed, yet the Dread of them keeps the fear∣ful in Awe. The Punishment for unnatural Impuri∣ties committed with others, is Capital. But the Laws
<PB N="11" REF="002573_0017_0FDB1630EC2E5D20"/>
are not the only thing which vicious Persons are afraid of. Some are with-held from Prostitutes by their Covetousness only. Others again abstain from <HI>Fornication</HI> for nothing else but the fear of Diseases, or the having of Children. Lascivious Widows, who understand the World, have reason to scruple second Marriages, on many Ac∣counts; some love their Liberty; others their Mo∣ney; and if they value their Reputation, they'll not dare to venture on unlawful Embraces; whereas in SELF-POLLUTION, neither the cautious, nor the covetous, imagine that they have any thing to fear.</P>
<P>IT is not easy to determine, whether it be more monstrous or unaccountable, that rather than commit a Sin before others, who would be their Accomplices, and uphold them in it, Men should chuse to be guilty of a greater before God, who has vow'd to revenge it. To say that this proceeds from <HI>Atheism,</HI> and want of <HI>Faith,</HI> is contrary to Experience, for let us take a thousand People to task, that shall have all been guilty of this or any other the most Heinous Crime, and we shall hardly find one, but what will not only acknow∣ledge a <HI>Deity,</HI> but likewise tell us, that he is con∣vinc'd of his <HI>Ubiquity</HI> and <HI>Omniscience,</HI> his <HI>Wisdom, Justice,</HI> and <HI>Omnipotence,</HI> and that he is ready to subscribe to every Article of Christianity. What can be said of this, is, that Man contradicts himself, and acts directly against his own Principle. What could be more absurd in humane Affairs, than that a Thief de∣signing to steal a Horse, should endeavour to shun the Eyes of all the World but the Owners; especially if he was fully perswaded, that this Owner could catch him whenever he would, and instict what Punishment upon him he pleas'd? What Spiritual darkness must surround Man, that should be stark blind in his great∣est Concerns, and clear sighted only in Trifles? When

a Man shews Bashfulness, and the utmost Cowardice to the most impotent Wretch of his Fellow Creatures, is it not unconceivable he should behave himself with gi∣antick Boldness and Impudence, to affront the Almigh∣ty Creator of Heaven and Earth? Yet there is one thing more contradictory still, which is, that at the same time he'll affect to be thought Brave as to Princi∣ple, and a Christian as to Religion.</P>
<P>IT is the general Opinion, that the Shameless are the worst of People; yet Shame when ill plac'd, has often wrought worse Effects than the Reverse alone has ever been able to produce. When a Bastard Infant is found dead, and the Mother lately deliver'd without Witness, is not able to prove either that she had made Provision for it, or during her Pregnancy, imparted the Secret to another besides the Father, our <HI>English</HI> Law, without any other Evidence, presumes the Wo∣man to have Murder'd the Child. From whence it is evident the Legislators must have suppos'd that some Women may have Cruelty enough to commit the ut∣most unnatural Murder of all, and at the same time want Courage to bear Shame: But is there no Reme∣dy to be found against this preposterous Shame? Is it impossible to imbue Youth with better Notions of it than are commonly received either by <HI>Example</HI> or <HI>Instruction?</HI></P>
<P>WOMEN for the generality, are more Bashful and reserv'd than Men, and there are things that a Man of the strictest Morals shall not scruple to do in Pub∣lick, which yet would shock most Women, even after Prostitution: From hence to imagine, that Women are naturally more modest than Men, is a Mistake; all the Difference between them, depends upon Custom and Education; and I am much mistaken, if this great Power of Fashions and Instruction does not point at a

Remedy, that would be very serviceable against SELF-POLLUTION. It is a Rule I know among the most prudent People, never to mention any thing concern∣ing this Vice, to the Youth of either Sex, for fear that either the Desire after Things forbidden, or else Curiosity itself, might prompt the Pupils to what per∣haps they never might have thought on, had it not been for the too instructive Caution of the Teachers. But there are other Methods: The Instruction of Youth I hint at, should commence from their Infancy. If Children were strictly forbid, never to touch their Eyes or Nose, but with their Handkerchief, and that only upon very urgent Necessities; if likewise they saw every Body comply with this Custom, and it was counted abominable to touch them with their naked Hards, I can't see why this might not be so shocking to 'em when grown up, as now the most guilty Denuda∣tions are to well-bred People.</P>
<P>I Would have the Reader reflect on the Matter I treat of, which differs much from other Points of Mo∣rality; for in handling other Topicks, a Man may safely say whatever he thinks any way advantageous to his Design; and has nothing to hinder him from rallying together whatever he apprehends necessary, and proposing his Arguments in their utmost Extent and Force, making them as plain as possible, and ans∣wering all Difficulties imaginable. But in arguing a∣gainst Uncleanness, especially this sort of it, which of all, as it is the most loathsome, the same Liberty is not to be taken, but a Man is extremely confin'd, and is oblig'd to express himself with the utmost Circum∣spection and Caution, for fear of intrenching upon Modesty; which as I promis'd I would not be Guilty of doing, I shall all along with the greatest strictness observe, as knowing I should be oblig'd to name some

Things that might betray my Readers into the remem∣brance of what it is much better that they should for ever forget, as they would not then be able to set such a watchful Guard upon their Thoughts and Fan∣cies, but that some soul or filthy Desires would in Spight creep in; the least imagination only of which, would render them Odious in God's sight, who seeth the Heart, and Delights in none but those who are pure and upright there; with which Apology, hoping it will be thought sufficient for what Omissions and Obscurity I have been guilty of, I conclude this Chapter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Frightful Consequences of <HI>SELF-POLLUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING set forth the Heinousness of this Sin in the preceeding Chapter, one might justly imagine, that the Impression which the Ugliness of Incontinence and Uncleanness in general there repre∣sented must make, would not so immediately wear out, as not to secure, for some small time, the Ima∣gination even of vicious Persons against any slight At∣tacks of Unchastity; but there are Lascivious People of such corrupt Minds, that at no time excepted, they may be rais'd to impure Thoughts by bare words, without Coherence, and the Names of Parts, even when made use of in the Discription of Calamitous Cases and Nauseous Diseases; Therefore as I shall be
<PB N="15" REF="002573_0021_0FDB1633AE70CB40"/>
forc'd to make use of some expressions in this Chap∣ter, which tho' spoke with a Design the most remote from Obscenity, may, working by the reverse, perhaps furnish the Fancies of silly People with Matter for Impurity; therefore I say, I beg of the Reader to stop here, and not to proceed any further, unless he has a Desire to be chast, or at least be apt to consider whether he ought to have it or no.</P>
<P>THE Afflictions which may, and often do fall upon those who are or have been guilty of the sinful Practice of SELF-POLLUTION, belong either to the Soul or the Body: I shall begin with those of the least Con∣cern. In the first place, it manifestly hinders the Growth both in Boys and Girls, and few of either Sex, that in their Youth commit this Sin to excess for any considerable time, come ever to that Robust∣ness or Strength which they would have arriv'd to without it. In Men as well as Boys, the very first Attempt of it has often occasion'd a <HI>Phymosis</HI> in some, and a <HI>Paraphymosis</HI> in others; I shall not explain these Terms any further, let it suffice that they are Accidents which are very troublesome &amp; painful, and may con∣tinue to be tormenting for some time, if not bring on Ulcers and other worse Symptoms; especially if manag'd by raw unskilful People, whom to employ, it is most commonly the Fate of young Men, who being conscious of their Guilt, have not the Assurance to address themselves to Men of Worth and Experi∣ence. Whoever wants to know the Signification of those Words, any <HI>Surgeon</HI> will imform him.</P>
<P>THE frequent Use of this POLLUTION; like∣wise causes <HI>Stranguries, Priapisms,</HI> and other Dis∣orders of the <HI>Penis</HI> and <HI>Testes,</HI> but especially <HI>Gonorr∣haea's,</HI> more difficult to be cur'd, than those contract∣ed from Women actually labouring under soul Diseases.
<PB N="16" REF="002573_0022_0FDB15FDEB4F8640"/>
When the Seminal Vessels are first strain'd, and after∣wards relax'd, the Ferment in the <HI>Testes</HI> is destroy'd and the Seed grown thin and waterish, comes away unelaborated, without any provocation; this Distem∣per often proves fatal, even under the Hands of the most skilful. These <HI>Gonorrhaea's</HI> are chiefly occasion'd, says <HI>Etmuller</HI> (a famous Physician) <HI>a damnata Mastu∣pratione,</HI> from that damnable SELF-POLLUTION; and as Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> also confirms, (speaking of this Practice) by that cursed School-Wickedness of Mastur∣bation <HI>(Res faeda dictu)</HI></P>
<P>IN some it has been the Cause of fainting Fits and Epilepsies; in others of Consumptions; and many young Men who were strong and lusty before they gave themselves over to this Vice, have been worn out by it, and by its robbing the Body of its balmy and vital Moisture, without Cough or Spitting, dry and emacia∣ted, sent to their Graves. In others again, whom it has not kill'd, it has produc'd Nightly and excessive Seminal Emissions; a Weakness in the <HI>Penis,</HI> and loss of Erection, as if they had been Castrated. <HI>Many a young Gentleman</HI> (says the same Dr. <HI>Baynard) has been for ever utterly undone by it:</HI> The Reason he gives for it, is, <HI>That used when young, it so forces and weakens the tender Vessels, that when they come to Manhood, it renders them ridiculous to Women, because impotent, a Curse half</HI> tanti <HI>to Castration; many of them not being able to touch a Woman, but</HI> ad primum labiorum contactum semen emittunt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In some Men of very strong Constitutions, the Mis∣chiefs may not be so visible, and themselves perhaps capable of Marrying; and yet the Blood and Spirits impair'd, and the Seed render'd infertile, so as to make them unfit for Procreation, by its changing the Crafts of the Spermatick Parts, making them become bar∣ren,
<PB N="17" REF="002573_0023_0FDB16352B9DB1F8"/>
as Land becomes poor by being over-till'd; and few of those that have been much accustom'd to this Vice in their Youth, have ever much reason to boast of the Fruits of their Marriage-Bed; for if by Na∣ture's extraordinary Helps, they should get any Chil∣dren, which happens not often, they are commonly weakly little ones, that either die soon, or become tender, sickly People, always ailing and complaining; a misery to themselves, a dishonour to humane Race, and a scandal to their Parents.</P>
<P><HI>WITH what Encouragement to Virtue there∣fore,</HI> says a certain Author, <HI>may young People, be∣hold in a Man at the Age of Fourscore, with a Wife of the like Antiquity, both bless'd with healthy hail Constitutions, and fresh wholesome Countenances, with sound Minds, and perfect Senses, with active Limbs, and of chearful Tempers, presiding over a healthful Progeny, perhaps to the third or fourth Generati∣on; and all these Blessings, owing under Providence, to their Temperance and Continence; when if we turn our Eyes upon licentious Masturbaters, we shall find them with meagre Jaws, and pale Looks, with feeble Hams, and Legs without Calves, their Gene∣rative Faculties weakon'd, if not destroy'd in the Prime of their Years. A Jest to others, and a Torment to themselves.</HI></P>
<P>IN Women SELF-POLLUTION if frequently practis'd, relaxes and spoils the retentive Faculty, oc∣casions the <HI>Flour albus,</HI> an obnoxious as well as per∣plexing Illness attending that Sex, which upon account of the Womb, may draw on a whole Legion of Dis∣eases; among other Disorders, it makes 'em look pale, and those who are not of a good Complection, swarthy and hagged. It frequently is the Cause of
<PB N="18" REF="002573_0024_0FDB15FF347A6320"/>
<HI>Hysterick Fits,</HI> and sometimes, by draining away all the radical Moisture, <HI>Consumptions.</HI> But what it more often produces than either is <HI>Barrenness,</HI> and at length a total ineptitude to the Act of Generation it self, Misfortunes very afflicting to them, because seldom to be redress'd.</P>
<P>THE Reason why I am not more particular in describing the many Calamities and bodily sufferings, which this Practice may be the occasion of in Women, I hope will be obvious to every Reader that is capable of making Reflections. It would be impossible to rake into so much Filthiness, as I should be oblig'd to do, without offending Chastity. One thing I shall add, ad∣dressing my self to young Women, who have any Esteem for their Honour, and would keep their Repu∣tation unspotted, which is, that many of them who thus defile their Bodies, by being needless, or perhaps more fill'd with impure Desires than ordinary, actually deflower themselves, and foolishly part with that va∣luable Badge of their Chastity and Innocence, which when once lost, is never to be retriev'd. This may be the fatal Cause whenever they marry, of endless Jealousies and Family-Quarrels, and make their Hus∣bands suspect more than they have deserv'd, wrong∣fully imagining, that there is but one Way by which Maids may forfeit their Virginity.</P>
<P>THE next evil Consequences to be apprehended from SELF-POLLUTION, are all those other Vices which it may lead the way to, and in time be the Occasion of: Let us once suppose, what some raw ignorant People imagine, that this is only a silly Practice, that there is no such great harm in it, and, if it be a Sin, it is at least less criminal than <HI>Fornication.</HI> Let us, I say, suppose this, tho' not grant it, and after that, se∣riously consider what Effects this foolish Trick of Youth
<PB N="19" REF="002573_0025_0FDB163A6E7B2798"/>
(as some favourably term it) is like to have on either Sex, and what Impression it must necessarily make on the Minds of those, that have given themselves over to it.</P>
<P>AS we are conceiv'd in Sin, it is impossible but lust∣ful Desires will now and then arise, especially in young People that are in Health. By the Reluctancy which all innocent Persons feel against complying with them, it is easily to be discover'd, that they are evil, and that the more violently they attack us, the more vi∣gorously we ought to resist them. While this Con∣flict betwixt Lust and Chastity last, we are Proof against many Temptations, and our Virtue remains trium∣phant. But when once we abandon our Guard, and allow those wanton Thoughts the Liberty of roving and wandering where-e'er they please, and loose Fancy can lead them, we make the first step to our Undoing; and our Chastity is always in Danger, as soon as our Dread and great Apprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of losing it, is gone. We ought not to trust to frail Reason, because it is no Match for our Inclinations, which are infinitely stronger. All carnal Temptations ought to be care∣fully shunned, if it be possible; but if met with, bold∣ly defy'd; for whoever admits of a Parley with Lust, will be vanquish'd at last, and is already capitulating with the Enemy. Therefore for our lives, ought we to forbear all Parley with the Flesh, observing the diffe∣rent Rules the Scripture give, between mortifying those Sins the Devil would put us upon, and mortify∣ing those Lusts the Flesh would tempt us to; the for∣mer is done by resisting, <HI>resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</HI> There when a Man grows stout and couragious, Satan grows cowardly, but it is not so with the Business of the Flesh; there our greatest Safety is in flying; when we have to do with Satan,
<PB N="20" REF="002573_0026_0FDB1605035DB1C0"/>
the Enemy is without us; but when we have to do with Lust, the Enemy is within us.</P>
<P>THE Devil may suggest to the Haughty and the Bash∣ful, that in SELF-POLLUTION they'll run no Hazard of their Reputation, and that no body in the World shall know it but themselves; and to the Covetous, that they shall lose nothing by it; or else represent he Impunity of it to the Cautious and Fearful; but he won't tell them that the All-seeing God must be a Witness to an Act, which his Holiness so much abomi∣nates, that the greatest Loss that can be sustain'd, is that of the Divine Favour, which, to Ballance, the Gain of the whole World is not Equivalent? and that eter∣nal Damnation infinitely exceeds all Temporal Punish∣ments that can be invented. When the first plausible Suggestions are once admitted, the latter Consequen∣ces, which are at least as certain, are not suffered to intrude, or are presently shov'd out as troublesome Companions. But whatever Reservedness before o∣thers, they may flatter themselves with, whenever the Fact is once committed, if it was but a trifling Sin, they can have no Innocence to boast of afterwards. The Barrier that fenc'd their Chastity is broke, and the Enemy to Purity and Holiness makes daily Inroads, and ravages through every Passage of the conquered Soul.</P>
<P>THE Sensuality of such, by being the Occasion of abundance of inordinate Inclinations in them, hurries them on to many Instances of Lewdness, for satisfying this brutish Passion. But the State of the Soul is chief∣ly to be considered; whilst it is ordinarily possess'd by lustful Thoughts and Desires; the unchast Person has his Mind rarely free from lascivious and shameful Ima∣ginations and Fancies, His Heart is a continual
<PB N="21" REF="002573_0027_0FDB163BF9B6EED0"/>
Spring of evil Thoughts, bubling up in it every Mo∣ment: So that there needs only the Presence of an Object to inflame his Desire. Let him but see or hear any thing relating to his beloved Sin, and his Lust is presently kindled by it. And not only so, but at o∣ther times when none of these Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts present them∣selves, his Memory serves to furnish him with such former Passages as had gratify'd his Sensuality; these he recalls to his Mind, and pleases himself with the Though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of them, instead of reflecting upon them, as he ought with Sorrow of Heart, and Confusion of Face.</P>
<P>WHERE this Sin is become habitual, there must be a Distaste to Godliness and Virtue in general, and whatever Wantonness, obscene Discourses, shameful Actions, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thy Representations are to be met with, (how cautiously soever they may to the World seem to be avoided) are treasured up with Care, constantly to feed this Flame of Impurity. For no sooner has Uncleanness got the Mastery over the Heart, but forthwith it pursues the Man every where, and keeps its Possession of him at all Times, and in all Places. Upon the most serious Occasions, and in the very Acts of Religion, he ever and anon finds himself transported with lustful Conceptions and Desires, which incessantly follow him, and take up his Thoughts. I shall not need to say, how great a Part of Mankind find their Mind flag and languish, and wander from their Busi∣ness, and are full even of wicked Thoughts, when they should be praying to God, or hearkening to his Word. But it is certain, that in many, Impurity is the Cause of this Disorder, a Soul that is not chast, will not know how to be devout. To such an one, the holy Exercises of Prayer, Meditation, Reading, &amp;c. are in∣sipid and unpleasant. A Love of Voluptuousness is in∣consistent with spiritual Delights, and those pious
<PB N="22" REF="002573_0028_0FDB1606AC51A848"/>
Affections, and Joys, and Raptures, which accompany a sincere Holiness of Conversation.</P>
<P>I Have in the foregoing Chapter spoke of some, who gave themselves over to this, and yet were Proof against any other gross Sin of Uncleanness, but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not so with all: Thousands have been guilty of <HI>Adul∣tery,</HI> as well as <HI>Fornication,</HI> who would never have yielded to those Temptations, which overcame them, if they had never been initiated in Lasciviousness, and acquir'd to themselves a Habit of Impurity by SELF-POLLUTION first. In such, not only the grosser Crimes of Uncleanness I just now named, but likewise all others that may be occasioned by them, as <HI>Lying, Forswearing,</HI> perhaps <HI>Murder,</HI> and what not, must be laid to the Charge, and brought in as the Effects and Consequences of their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st darling Sin, by which they were infected with a stronger Habit of Impurity, than they could ever have contracted from any other Frailty.</P>
<P>AMONG the Consequences of the Sin I treat of, ought not to be forgot the Troubles and Agonies of a wounded Conscience, whenever it is rous'd, and makes the polluted startle, affrighted at the Enormity of their Crime. To let the Reader see how this Guilt of un∣natural Impurity can alarm the Offenders, when they awaken from their Lethargy of Sin, I shall insert the <HI>Preface</HI> to a little Book, entituled, <HI>Letters of Advice from Reverend Divines, to a young Gentleman about a weighty Case of Conscience.</HI> This <HI>Preface,</HI> wrote likewise by way of LETTER, is address'd to all young Men, who have or may be tempted to this great Sin in the following Manner.</P>

<P>THE Substance of the LETTERS mention'd in this <HI>Preface,</HI> shall be communicated to the Reader, in the
<PB N="24" REF="002573_0030_0FDB1608339907B8"/>
following Chapter; whom I entreat to lend his seri∣ous Consideration, on what shall be further said is this.</P>
<P>THERE are many heinous Offenders, who are har∣den'd in Sin, and continue in it and all worldly Enjoy∣ments, without relenting; but few go so to their Graves; most great Sinners before they die, feel a deep Remorse, and are tormented with the bitter Stings of Conscience, upbraiding them with their Guilt, and representing it to them in its true Colours, and most frightful Forms. What Com∣fort must a Man have, in reflecting on the past Acti∣ons of his Life, who hardly comes to half the Age he might reasonably have expected to arrive at, finds him∣self enervated by the practice of SELF POLLUTION, his Spirits sunk, his Body wasted, and his Strength decay'd; in continual Danger of being forc'd to resign his impure Breath, upon the least Rigour of the Sea∣son, or any other small Accident? What Comfort, I say, must a Man have, when his Crime, representing it self before him, in its most ghastly Shape, Consci∣ence shall upbraid him, that by so many repeated Acts of Murder, he has at last destroy'd himself before he is Thirty Years of Age, as by my own Experience I have known it the case of several? It such great Misfortunes happen but seldom, there are other infirmities that may occasion very disagreeable Reflections. When Persons of good Estates, in the Flower of their Age, find themselves bereft of their Manhood, and conscious of their Impotence, and the cursed Cause of it, are forc'd to decline the most advantageous Matches, and without the least Hopes of Posterity, remain the Contempt of others, and a Burden to themselves; to which perhaps, the Mortification shall be added, that the Name and Honour of an Ancient Family, extinct with themselves, must be for ever buried in Oblivion, whilst the magni∣ficent
<PB N="25" REF="002573_0031_0FDB163F378E4E28"/>
Seats and venerable Structures of their more vertuous Ancestors, are inherited or pull'd down by Strangers.</P>
<P>OTHERS again, who can't be said to die without Offspring, have puny ling'ring Children, more brought up by Physick than Kitchin Diet, which they are forc'd to leave at Fourteen or Fifteen Years of Age, perhaps younger, without any probability that they shall ever come to Maturity: When Persons of large Possessions have no better Views to turn to, than these, and withal so much Reason to lay all the Blame upon themselves, as the frequent practice of SELF-POLLUTION in their Youth, can furnish them with, the Prospect can be but Melancholick. Some Women likewise, tho' married to ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and fertile Husbands, who through the <HI>vileness of their Affections,</HI> have <HI>chang'd,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> ex∣presses it, <HI>the natural use into that which is against Nature,</HI> are all their Life-time wishing for Children in vain; every Year perhaps they change the Air, try all the Baths in <HI>Christendom,</HI> and follow the Advice of most Physicians, and yet are either subject to fre∣quent Miscarriages before the Fifth Month, or else are never impregnated at all. If ever such Women were guilty of SELF-POLLUTION to Excess, and are wise enough to know the Consequences of it, with what Sorrow and Anxieties must the Remembrance of it fill them, even when their Troubles are not extend∣ed beyond Temporal Affairs? But when once they are touched with the quick Sense of their heinous Offences to GOD, how must the Reflection on the Things I have named confound the Guilty of either Sex? What Aggravations will they not heap on their Crimes, even to their own Imaginations?</P>
<P>LET no Body imagine that the Consequences of this Sin, and all other Acts of Uncleanness, will be
<PB N="26" REF="002573_0032_0FDB1609B0197230"/>
less Calamitous to those, whom either the bodily Sufferings and Infirmities I have spoken of, never reach, or no Temporal Afflictions make any Impression upon, in order to Repentance. Those who never feel any Trouble for their Sin, are oftentimes as insensible of the Punishments of it, such Punishments I mean as befall them by reason of it in this Life. Sometimes one may perceive the Judgments of GOD hanging o∣ver the Heads of the Unchaste, and threatning to fall upon them; sometimes actually and visibly pursuing them in their own Persons, or in their Relations, or Affairs in the World, making them groan under the Miseries, Sorrows, and divers Evils they have brought upon themselves; and yet we may see how little Sense they have of the Reason, why these sad Afflicti∣ons are laid upon them, and how ready they are to attribute their Misfortune to any other Cause, rather than to themselves; some of them continuing in their Security, till the Judgment of GOD seizes them, and they die in their Impenitence, which is the most de∣plorable and most dangerous State a Man can fall into. For so long as the Sinner has a Sense of his Guilt, and the Vengeance justly due to him for it, there is some hope of him; but when he is come to this Degree of Obduracy, there is very little to be expected from him; for he is then upon the very Brink of Misery, and but one Step from everlasting Destruction.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said last then, it is manifest, that neither our escaping the Bodily Sufferings which so often ensue upon this Crime, nor our insensibility of the Sin, or the Temporal Punishments of it, make any Amendment in our Condition; and on the other Side, as evident, from what has been said before, that the Consequences of this Crime, may on several Ac∣counts render the Reflection on the Cause of it, most
<PB N="27" REF="002573_0033_0FDB7B08B7E32CB8"/>
terrible to the Offenders, and excite in them such an Inconceivable Indignation against themselves, as (with∣out GOD's Mercy) cannot possibly end but in Despair.</P>
<P>LET us now consider, once, That these Pangs of Conscience (terrible as they are) are most necessary to Repentance, which yet no Body can be sure that it will be accepted. But if those Anxieties to be suffer'd on Earth, are most frightful to all that will reflect on them, how much more ought the Guilty to stand in awe of those other more inevitable, and more intol∣lerable Punishments which are reserv'd for the other Life? The unclean are not always punish'd in this World, but they will be most certainly in the next, unless they take Care to prevent it, by a timely and hearty Reformation. This the Holy Scripture teaches, as expresly as may be; <HI>Neither Fornicators,</HI> says St. <HI>Paul, nor Adulterers, nor the Abominable, shall in∣herit the Kingdom of God;</HI> cautioning also at the same time, that we don't abuse our selves, nor flatter our selves in this respect. And the same Doctrine he repeats, Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. <HI>I have told you before, as I have told you in times past, that they who commit such things, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> So Eph. 5.6. <HI>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things, cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> likewise, in the 2d Epist. Chap. 2. ver. 9. declares and proves by many Examples, that <HI>God reserves the Wicked,</HI> and chiefly the carnal and impure, <HI>unto the Day of Judgment, to be punished.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are the Consequences of SELF-POLLU∣TION; this is that dreadful State to which it brings Men; and these the Sins into which it drives them, and the Punishment to which it renders them obnoxi∣ous.

And one would think them enough to inspire all Persons with a Detestation against this Vice. I am sure, every one has Reason to dread the Thoughts of falling into that Bruitishness and Hardness of Heart, of which all are in great Danger, who at any time pass the Bounds of Modesty, and part with their Chastity; and should therefore seriously study to prevent that Remorse, which sooner or later will be the Portion of the Lasci∣vious; and to keep at a Distance from a Sin, that draws so many others after it, and in a Word, casts its Slaves and Votaries into an Abyss of Evils.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Spiritual and Physical Advice to those who have injur'd themselves by the abominable Practice of <HI>SELF-POLLUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing Chapter, it has been prov'd, that the Hurt which either Sex may receive from SELF-POLLUTION, is Corporal as well as Spiritual: But because every Body, who but once has committed this Fact, has in a grievous manner offended GOD, and wrong'd his Soul, and many of strong Constitutions may for some Time have been guilty of this Sin, with∣out any considerable, or at least perceptible Harm to their Bodies, yet how to redress the spiritual Injury received, shall be our first and chiefest Care. There is no Christian who can be ignorant, that no Pardon can be obtain'd for this as well as other Sins, without Repentance in general; but many are apt to deceive
<PB N="29" REF="002573_0035_0FDB7B0E6A0E4028"/>
themselves concerning the Nature of Repentance, as not well knowing in what it consists; wherefore, it is requisite I should say something of the Manner after which this Duty ought to be performed, as well as the Necessity of it.</P>
<P>THE first Branch of Repentance, and the first Duty of the polluted, is a Sorrow for what they have done; after this, it is very necessary that the Sinner should examine himself, to know what Principle it arises from; for if his Sorrow only proceeds from any Cor∣poral Affliction, which this Sin already has brought upon him; or the Fear that it may do so in time to come, it is not saving, unless the Sinner makes a fur∣ther Progress, and improves the Almighty's Chastise∣ments, to beget in him an unfeign'd Abhorrence of his Transgressions. Wherefore, the principal Cause of his Grief must be the greatness of the Sin it self, and the woful Estate whereinto it brings Men, in relation to GOD and their own Salvation; for it is certain, that no Repentance is acceptable in the sight of GOD, that does not arise from such Meditations as these.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it sufficient to be somewhat grieved and ashamed; but this Grief must be affecting, such as enters deep, and pierces the very Heart, filling it with Sadness and Remorse, Detestation and Fear; or if it be not such at the beginning, it must be such at length. This is above all others the one infallible Mark of a hearty Sorrow, and sincere Repentance; that the Sinner finds no longer any Pleasure or Satisfaction in the things he had formerly delighted in, but seeks to with∣draw and get out of the way of them, and finds more Comfort in his Sadness and Tears for them: Some∣times those that have renounced this and other Sins of Uncleanness, have turned aside another way; and be∣taken
<PB N="30" REF="002573_0036_0FDB160FC0681C58"/>
themselves to Pleasures of another Nature. But so long as they retain an Affection for worldly Pleasures and Joys of whatsoever kind, this is a certain Sign of their not being touch'd with a true Repentance.</P>
<P>BUT above all, Care must be taken, that this Grief be lasting; for Mens Sorrow is oftentimes but light at the beginning of their Conversion, as will easily be apprehended, if we but call to mind that there are two sorts of Sins. Some there are for which a Man is apt to have an extream Concern, as soon as he ever has committed them, and they are such as he is not be∣trayed into by his own Inclination, nor can take Delight in. Thus, when one has committed Murder, or spo∣ken Blasphemy, he will perhaps be immediately struct with the Horror of his Crime, and a stinging Re∣morse, by reason of it. But it is quite otherwise with those Sins into which Men are drawn by Pleasure, and which gratify their Inclinations, and especially when they are become habitual. Though they take up a Re∣solution of quitting these, they do not at first look up∣on 'em with the Aversion due to them; they could yet please themselves with them, and it is not without doing Violence to themselves, and resisting their own Inclinations, that they get rid of them. So that their Dislike of these sorts of Sins is but small at first, the Fire of Lust not being yet wholly extinct. But the chief Commendation of it, is, that it is lasting. And this is what they ought to have an especial regard to, the cause of most Mens Failings in these Attempts, being, that in time the sense of their Crimes abates, and at last wears quite away.</P>
<P>THE Repentance of those who are polluted by this Sin, or any other sort of Uncleanness▪ should remain with them to their Lives end. These are not Sins
<PB N="31" REF="002573_0037_0FDB7B10EBF5D860"/>
which a Man can forget, and the Memory of them ought to be always fresh, that the Penitent may truly say with <HI>David, My Sins are ever before me.</HI> Not only the time that has past since the Commission of it, but even an Amendment of Life does not take away the Sense of so great a Fault; but on the contrary he becomes more and more sensible of it. Even this Thought, that the Sinner has had the Happiness to obtain the Pardon of his Guilt, will render the Re∣membrance of it the more bitter, and the greater Pro∣gress he makes in Holiness, the more abominable will his wickedness appear. The greater Experience he has had of GOD's Mercy, the more he will accuse and loath himself; &amp; the more hope he has of Salvation through GOD's Goodness, the more will he be af∣fected with the danger of being excluded from it to which he had expos'd himself.</P>
<P>ANOTHER great Duty that belongs to Repentance, is Conversion and Amendment: The Guilty must forsake their Sin, and continue no longer in it. When our Blessed Saviour pardon'd the Woman taken in <HI>A∣dultery,</HI> he said to her; <HI>Go and Sin no more.</HI> The Crime must therefore be totally renounc'd; and they which do not this, but relapse into it, have not repented of it. Every Act, and every repetition of their Sin is an Aggravation of both their Guilt and Punishment.</P>
<P>BUT this is but the beginning of Conversion; and this first step will be to no purpose, if the Offenders stop here; it is not enough to renounce their Crime, without renouncing likewise all the Approaches to it: All the several Species of Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity, and all the Defile∣ments of either Body or Mind; all lewd Actions, wanton Glances, impure Thoughts and Desires, toge∣ther with such Familiarities as expose to Temptations;
<PB N="32" REF="002573_0038_0FDB1614711EBCD0"/>
all obscene Discourse, or Expressions, and the like, which are contrary to Chastity, must be entirely laid aside.</P>
<P>IT is true, This Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unciation may appear Difficult at first, and will occasion no small Trouble to those that have contract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bit of giving them∣selves up to all sorts of Passions. But People must courageously resolve to overcome themselves, it being far better to deny themselves in those things, and to cross their own I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clinations for a time, then by pur∣suing them, to perish Eternally. <HI>It is profitable that One <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their</HI> Members <HI>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld perish, and not that their whole</HI> Body <HI>should be cast into</HI> Hell, St. Matth. 5.29.</P>
<P>THERE are two Reasons why it is necessary to re∣nounce all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Species of Impurity: First, because they will be apt to make Men fall again into the Crime; and then, because a true Repentance is incon∣sistent with Defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment. The Soul is not changed, whilst it is not pure, but preserves a Kindness for those filthy and shameful Passions. In a Word, where∣soever there is any Love of Sin, there is no true Re∣formation.</P>
<P>IT suffices not barely to fly Impurity, but they likewise must shew forth their Repentance, by a Life of Mortification; and if it be a general Doctrine a∣mong Christians, not to take Care of the Flesh but to mortify the Body, and keep it under, and bring it into Subjection, none have more reason for the Obser∣vance of these Injunctions than those whom the Pas∣sions of the Flesh have drawn into Sin. A love of Pleasures and compliance with the Flesh, are no where more highly blameable, than in such as are guilty of Impurity. And it must also be granted, that when
<PB N="33" REF="002573_0039_0FDB7B11D087B080"/>
any one is touch'd with a lively Sense of this Crime, he goes on no longer in quest of his vain Delights, he is not then in a Condition to rejoyce and please him∣self, but places his Consolation rather in the Exercises of Repentance: Diversions, and frivilous Entertain∣ments, reading vain Authors, Dressing, and the Care of the Body; all these make but vain Impressions up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him. And on the contrary, when chose that have been impure and dissolute, and who have left off to Sin, as they have grown into Years, do not mortify themselves; when they lose their Ease, and make it their study to obtain the Pleasures and Advantages of Life, passing their time in Idleness, or at Play, and setting their Minds upon Dainties and sumptuous Entertainments, most certainly these are yet in a State of Impenitence, and have never been truly sensible of their Fault, not duly set themselves to make amends for it.</P>
<P>THE Sincerity of Conversion, must not only appear in the things which have relation to Impurity, but in the whole Course of their Conversation. So great a Fall should render a Man Wise, Pious, Circumspect in all things: All that is in him is to become new: He would take occasion from every thing to shew his Re∣pentance, to discharge his Duty towards GOD, to edify his Neighbour, and to purify himself more and more. He ought with the greatest Exactness and Sin∣cerity to practice the Duties of Religion, to give him∣self to Meditation and Prayer, and to be constant in Holy Exercises, casting himself, as St. <HI>Austin</HI> advises, upon GOD, who will not withdraw himself from him, nor leave him to fall, but will help him, if he relies upon, and puts confidence in him: There are only two things requir'd of him, one, that he would fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ly resolve, to make the Glory of GOD, and his own Salvation his chief End, regarding nothing in Compari∣son
<PB N="34" REF="002573_0040_0FDB161674835FE8"/>
with it; and the other, not to trust in his own Strength or Prudence, but in the Omnipotence and infinite Love of GOD. He ought likewise to do all the Works he shall be able, and especially to employ his Goods to the Uses of Piety and Charity, following the Counsel of the Prophet <HI>Daniel, Redeeming their Sins by Alms, and their Iniquities by shewing Mercy to the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>HAPPY are the Guilty who discharge these Duties aright, who with the sinful Woman in St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Gos∣pel, weep bitterly for their Faults, who have renoun∣ced and forsaken them, and are altogether converted, <HI>Their Sins, though great shall be forgiven them.</HI> These are by no means to be despised: For there is a great deal of Love due to all Sinners, but more es∣pecially to such as forsake their Wickedness, and cause <HI>Joy in Heaven</HI> by their Return.</P>
<P>BUT he that allows himself in any known Sin, is a wicked Man, and he that teaches, or any ways en∣courages another to commit a Sin, as is too customa∣rily done in the Practice of SELF-POLLUTION, is likewise a wicked Man, for he is Partner with him in that Sin which he tempts him to, and consequently without sincere Repentance, must expect to share with him in the Punishment; and no wicked Man hath any Portion in the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>The First is an Answer as Desir'd, concerning the Sin of <HI>ONAN.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS to the Business of <HI>Onan,</HI> my Opinion is the same with theirs, That think the Lewdness of the Fact was compos'd of Lust and Murder; the first appears in that he went rashly upon it. It seems he staid not till Night for the time of Privacy for such a purpose, else the <HI>Bed</HI> might have been named as well as the <HI>Ground:</HI> the Second is the Honour of his Dead Brother, and therefore would not be Father of any Child that should be reported his, and not his own: the Third is, that there is a Seminal vital Virtue, which perisheth if the Seed be spilt, and to do this, to hinder the begetting of a Living Child, (as he did at the very time, when she was in full expectation of being embraced by him,) in directing in another way, and not in its proper place, is the first Decree of Murder that can be committed; and the next unto it is the Marring Conception when it is made, and causing of Abortion. Now such Acts are noted in the Scripture, as horrible Crimes, be∣cause otherwise many might commit them, and not know the Evil of them. It is conceived that his Brother <HI>Er,</HI> before, was his Brother in Evil thus far, that both of them satisfied their Sensuality against the Order of Nature, and therefore the Lord cut them off both alike, with sudden Vengeance, which may be for the Terror of those, who in the neglect

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>The next is a LETTER of Advice from another of the Divines.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I am a Stranger to your Person, yet you have made me not to be a Stranger to your Soul, which indeed I find to be deplorable enough, and there is no Sorrow great enough for it, except such Sorrow as drives you from GOD: <HI>Exigit au∣tem ille dolor plusquam lex ulla dolori concessit.</HI> Let your Anger be infinite against your Sin, watch against it with all the Caution that is imaginable, and now that your State is such, that you can scarce Sin any more in that Instance where your Evil lies, shew Zeal and Indignation against your self, and judge your self severely for what is past, and while you live never be reconcil'd to your Self, but pray for Pardon perpetually; but then be sure to hope for it Humbly, or else you can never pray for it acceptably.</P>
<P>DO not think a few Tears, or some short Penan∣ces are enough in your Case; take no Measures but even all you can, and give your self up to a very Holy Life, and remember that your Sin is too great for any thing but GOD's Mercy; this indeed is in∣finite, and must needs infinitely exceed your Burden and Calamity. <HI>Sir,</HI> Your Sins have been carnal,
<PB N="37" REF="002573_0043_0FDB7B14E2CBAF30"/>
take heed you do not add Despair; for it is a spi∣ritual Evil, ten thousand times worse than the other. They dishonour'd your Body, but this dishonours GOD, and speaks reproachfully of him. Once more, begin a true Repentance, and finish it, and be afraid to provoke GOD any more; for there is a time in which GOD will be no more entreated; the oftner any Man breaks his Vows of Repentance, the nearer he is to that State. If GOD gives you Life and Grace of Amendment and Repentance, it is cer∣tain you are not yet fallen into that State; but I pray tempt GOD no more, your Soul is too pre∣cious a Concern to be put so often to the venture. <HI>Sir,</HI> You have only spoken to me in general, and I have given you a proportionable Answer; if in any particular Question you desire to be resolv'd, I will decline no Troubl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you shall require of me, nor think it any, if I may do Comfort or give In∣struction to your Soul. Pray GOD bless and sanctity your Penitential Sorrow to you, make it sincere, and increase it to an excellent and perfect Repentance. Remember that all the Pains and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re which Re∣pentance can put you to in this World, are not half so bad as one Minute of the Eternal Pains of Hell.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>The other LETTER from the same Divine, has this.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO doubt but you have committed a grievous Sin, and the more because you did it know∣ingly, frequently, with deliberation, with delight, and against many Resolutions, (as I perceive) to the
<PB N="38" REF="002573_0044_0FDB161979ADF208"/>
contrary; and therefore it is but necessary you should lay it to Heart, and look upon your self as an inordinate lover of carnal Pleasure, as one that hath defil'd your own Body, and in some sort stain'd your Baptism, offended the Spirit, unhallow'd and desecrated its Temple, and that deserves to be de∣stroy'd: Mistake me not, I do not equal your Sin, with that of <HI>Fornication,</HI> concerning which the Apostle speaks these dreadful things, but I say, in some sort, in a lesser degree, you have incurr'd that Guilt, by Fornicating with your self, and that after you were instructed, and had purpos'd Amendment; yet all this doth not make your Crime unpardona∣ble, but only more difficult to Cure. Sins of Deli∣beration, often repeated against Vows, and with De∣light, are very dangerous; but the Danger consists in this, that they are hard to be forsaken because of an habitual Pleasure in them. You will agree, I suppose, to the Doctrine following, which I take to be infallible.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is no Pardon to be hoped for with∣out Repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Repentance is forsaking the Sin totally.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That it is abandoning of all Sin whatsoever.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That tho' this forsaking of Sin, does not make us clean as to what is past, yet it has a Promise of Mercy and Forgiveness annex'd to it, which we can∣not fail of,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7. If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son cleanseth us from all Sin. <HI>Observe that it is from</HI> all <HI>Sin; and likewise take notice that in the</HI> 9th <HI>Verse he saith,</HI> GOD is faithful and just to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanse us from <HI>all</HI> Unrighteousness. <HI>From whence no may draw another certain Conclusion, that Par∣don
<PB N="39" REF="002573_0045_0FDB7B1BCBB1B2B8"/>
may be claim'd as a matter of Right and Justice, by him that forsakes his Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD should not be just, if he should deny it to such a Person suing for it; it consists not with his Faithfulness to with-hold it. Then add this fur∣ther, that if Sin be forgiven, GOD must needs treat us as his Friends, and use us as kindly, as if we were in Innocence, for</HI> it is Sin only that makes a Separation between GOD and us. <HI>From whence it follows, that his Spirit, which he has promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to those whom he loves, must also return again, and forget the former Affronts that were offer'd to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>YOUR first Question then is resolv'd, and you may be at peace, if you but forsake this Sin and all others; for you see,</HI> the Blood of Christ cleanseth us from all Unrighteousness, when we turn from the Works of Darkness, and walk in the Light. <HI>And to∣gether with our cleansing, the Holy Ghost comes a∣gain, and resumes his former Dwelling, which is no more offensive to him. Now I doubt not but there is a possibility (though perhaps some difficulty) of for∣saking this Sin, and so becoming the Habitation of GOD, through his Spirit, because you have the Spi∣rit of GOD in some of its Operations,</HI> viz. <HI>as the Spirit of Illumination and Understanding, tho' not in all other that belong to it. You discern and ac∣knowledge the Sin, the heinousness of it, its evil Con∣sequents, the Injury it doth to GOD, to his SON and HOLY SPIRIT; I doubt not therefore but the Spirit will further communicate it self to you, if you will but follow my Advice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LABOUR to understand the Gospel, and to have as comprehensive a Sense of your Duty contained
<PB N="40" REF="002573_0046_0FDB161D84F24410"/>
therein, as you can;</HI> and hereby <HI>(those being the Words of the Spirit)</HI> the HOLY GHOST will sanctify that part of you which the Apostle 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5.23. <HI>calls</HI> the Spirit, i. e. <HI>the Mind and Understanding, which is cleansed by these new Principles assented unto: Then bring your Heart to consent to be governed and led by the holy Rules of Life; press them with all the Reason you can upon your Heart and Soul, re∣ceive them and love them, in the Life of it, as the very Words of the HOLY GHOST, the Spirit of Life. Hereby that part of you which the Apostle calls the Soul,</HI> i. e. <HI>the Will and Affections, will be sanctify'd also. Next to this, that which he calls the Body,</HI> i. e. <HI>all the outward Actions of Life, will in∣evitably be sanctify'd, and prove conform to that De∣termination of your Soul or Will, if you do but con∣stantly follow the Counsel of another Apostle,</HI> Build∣ing up your self in your most Holy Faith, praying in the HOLY GHOST, keeping your Soul in the Love of GOD, and the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, to Eternal Life.</P>
<P><HI>I Believe in some Constitutions, the Stimulations to this Sin, may be very vehement and hard to be re∣sisted, and therefore it will not be amiss to tell you that you must call in the Assistance of all other na∣tural Remedies to which a Christian must not think it below him to be beholden. As first; Meditate much upon sad &amp; doleful Objects; get your fancy painted with such kind of Images as have little of Light and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iety in them; for such things do inspire the natural Spirits of all sorts: and in all Parts, making them more brisk and nimble; whereas more dark Thoughts are apt to blunt and stupify them, making them long for nothing of Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="002573_0047_0FDB7B1CF76899D0"/><HI>Boccalini,</HI> as an Antidote against Whoredom; ad∣vises those that way inclin'd, to carry about with them a well-drawn Picture, of the most perfect and faultless Beauty that ever appear'd in Flesh and Blood, pencill'd over again with rotten Teeth, blear Eyes, no Nose at all; in fine, render'd as loathsome as Venom and Corruption can make it, and that whenever De∣sires of the Flesh stir, they would take a sober view of it, and seriously consider what they are about to do, and the Consequents; and no doubt but it would ef∣fectually damp their Inclinations. So in SELF-POL∣LUTION, would Transgressors that way, of either Sex, but set before their Eyes (at the time their Incli∣nations to pollute themselves stir) what woful Miseries and Calamities, both to Soul and Body, others have drawn upon themselves thereby, and they, by the like Practice, will in all likelihood upon themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and seriously consider, that whilst they vainly strive to please themselves▪ they displease GOD, exhaust their own Strength, and are hastening themselves to the Grave, it must surely, one would think, deter them from the Evil; more especially, if they further consi∣der, how that being thereby enervated, should they in that State marry, they would instead of that Love and Delight expected between Man and Wife, find no∣thing but Quarrels, Jealousies, bitter Hatred and Dis∣contents.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>YOU must use a spare Diet, but not totally abstain. Fasting I believe some use as a Remedy against the Provocations of Uncleanness; but I think in some Tempers it rather sharpens the Humour, and makes it more Itching and apt to irritate.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>HAVE a Care of the Kind and Quality of your Meat. As</HI> 1st. <HI>Salt Meat you must forbear,
<PB N="42" REF="002573_0048_0FDB7B1E7A664D58"/>
which you may know by the Nature of the Word makes Men salacious. A Learned Physician of our own observes, that in Ships which are laden with Salt from</HI> Rochel, <HI>the Mice breed thrice as fast as in those Ships laden with other Merchandize. Pigeons, you know, have Salt laid for them to pick upon and the</HI> Egyptian <HI>Priests, being Votaries to a single Life, abstain'd from all Salt whatsoever; but that is an Error on the other Hand, and may have dangerous Effects.</HI> 2dly, <HI>All windy Foods, for the Flautuous∣ness of them, do puff up the Humour, and make those Parts more turgid; such as</HI> Beans <HI>and</HI> Pease, Artichoaks, &amp;c. <HI>You know</HI> Phythagoras <HI>forbid his Scholars to eat a</HI> Bean, <HI>and this was one Reason, I do not question, of his Prohibition.</HI> 3dly, <HI>According to the Description you make of your self, I must add, that Butter is naught for you, all Physicians agreeing that it is to be avoided by those who labour under a Flux of any Humour whatsoever. There is too great an Unctuousness in it; and in some Bodies, by the Resolution of those oily Parts, it creates Fumes also, which hinder the Command of the Mind over those lower Parts.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly, <HI>I would advise you to be most abstemious about the Full and Change of the Moon, for then the whole Body is fuller of Moisture than at other Seasons.</HI></P>

<P N="6">6thly, <HI>TAKE proper Medicines, as well as Food, and use pretty much Exercise, (tho' not too violent) for that spends much of the superfluous Moisture in the Body; and likewise, if it be to a small Weariness, (which is necessary) spends some of those Spirits that will else evacuate themselves at other Places. The
<PB N="43" REF="002573_0049_0FDB7B405084BE98"/>
Bed is too great a Friend to this Sin, therefore let me advise you, to make no further use of it than for sleeping; for whilst you lie awake, at your ease, your Flesh will be egging you on to this sinful Pleasure, therefore employ your self with some good Book, till you find Sleep a coming, and in the Morning, quit your Bed assoon as you awake. I know it is more healthful to the Body to continue in Bed some time after Sleep, that the Vapours may have time to scat∣ter, and the natural Spirits recover their Strength and Activity; but for you, who are prone to this Lust, it is better to deny your Body that Conveniency; than suffer your Soul to be punished through Sensu∣ality. Sleep also on one Side, and not on your Back, for that beats the Reins, &amp; causes irritations to Lust. I know it will cost some Violence at first to Nature, to be flung so suddenly out of a warm Bed upon a cold F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor, but the difficulty will soon vanish after</HI> 5 <HI>or</HI> 6 <HI>times Practice of it, and the comfort you will have in your own Breast by it, will much more than make amends. The Church History, tells us of a young Man in danger of being overcame by a beautiful Harlot that was with him, to betray him into her Embraces, bit off a piece of his Tongue, that so the Anguish and Pain possessing his Thoughts, Lust might have no room there. Do not handle those Parts at any Time, but when Necessity of Nature requires, for handling of them puffs up, irritates and raises Flesh∣ly Inclinations; and I should think likewise, that it will be good, after you have humbled your self so far for this Sin as to forsake it, then not to think of it any more, or as little as ever you can; for even the thinking upon that Sin, doth but renew the Desire of it. Any thoughts concerning Things belonging to those Parts, do but excite and provoke Lust. For then the Thoughts send the Spirits to those Parts,
<PB N="44" REF="002573_0050_0FDB7B20C7D566D0"/>
and make them swell, even as upon other Occasions, they send them to the Muscles in the Legs or Arms, when we would use them. Forget therefore as much as you can, that there has been any such thing done by you, and employ your Thoughts otherwise, till you may think of it with more safety, that is when you are Married.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if after all your most exact compliance with the injunctions here enforc'd, involuntary POLLUTI∣ONS in your sleep, should still infest you, I would advise you, whenever you are apprehensive, or in fear of them, to do what <HI>Forestus,</HI> a noted Physician in his time, lays down, as certain when every thing else has fail'd, which is, to tie a string, when you go to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, about your Neck, and the other end of it about the Neck of your <HI>Penis,</HI> which when an Erection happens, will timely awaken you, and put an effectual stop to the seminal Emission.</P>
<P>THESE are excellent Advices, and Marriage the chief Preventative, it being an Institution appointed by the Almighty, as a Remedy against Incontinence, and to preserve us from the Guilt of Impurity, as well as for the Propagation of our Species; whereby the united Pair may with Honour use that Freedom with one another, as was by no means lawful for them to do while they were single, yet there are Restraints in that State also. Bounds set, that they are not to exceed. And tho' the married State is the most happy and comfortable State in the World, where there is (as there ought to be) an Union of Souls, as well as Bodies, and notwithstanding Holy Writ advises it to those that have not the Gift of Continence, yet we too often find them rather inclin'd to pursue their Lusts, than enter into it; some by vowing Celebacy think themselves excus'd;
<PB N="45" REF="002573_0051_0FDB7B4585596668"/>
others thro' Libertinism, and to be less confin'd in their Passions; others to avoid some Inconveniencies or Restraints they apprehend to accompany the Marri∣age-Life; and others again, because they cannot meet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fortune▪ to their Mind; their Circumstances in the World, as they plead, not allowing them other∣wise to alter their Conditions; and in the mean time, all of them (not being chaste) do expose themselves to the continual Danger of Temptations that way, and cannot avoid being ever and anon overcome by them, and more especially if they indulge Idleness, and high living, which more immediately exposes them to lust∣ful Thoughts, when Business chases them away, by employing the Mind to better Purposes. It was an Idle and Luxurious Life, that gave Occasion for a cer∣tain young Gentleman of Birth and Fortune, as well as Parts, to lament himself upon an advantageous Offer of Marriage made him by his Friend.</P>
<P><HI>THAT he was now, through his Follies alto∣gether uncapable of the married State, having been from his Youth most inordinately addicted to the shameful Practice of</HI> SELF-POLLUTION, <HI>so hateful to GOD and injurious to himself, and which neither his Reason, Conscience, E∣ducation, or Prayers were of force enough to master that unruly Passion, which had plung'd him, not only into the reproachful Infirmity of an irreperable Weakness of the Genitals, so ridicul'd by Men, and so detestable to Women kind, but also into most dreadful Horrors of Conscience, and well nigh Despair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002573_0052_0FDB7B225E3E9590"/>AND no doubt, but from the same Cause it is, that so many very likely Gentlemen of Fortune, that we see or hear of Abroad, do refuse the Offer of Advan∣tageous Matches, being Conscious to themselves of their Infirmity, which as they are asham'd to own, they as industriously take Care to conceal, excusing themselves with the Answer of being too young, or not yet dispos'd to marry; and as they a little advance in Years, that they are then too old. I must confess, whenever I hear or know of such refusing to enter in∣to the State, whom nothing, to Humane Appearance, can hinder, they having plenty of all Things this World can afford them, I cannot help thinking, that either Incapacity as to Manhood, or the Fear of Communica∣ting some ill Disease which they are apprehensive of in themselves, by their former Follies, or <HI>a Mistress</HI> must be the Cause; and I may dare venture to say without being thought Censorious, that where it is o∣therwise than so in One, Ten if they dar'd, could subscribe to my Belief; and this may cease the Won∣der of the Relations and Friends of such Gentlemen, <HI>why</HI> they don't marry? Several within the Verge of my own Knowledge having declined it, and but justly, for the two first Reasons I have named, and many, many more, to their Shame be it spoken, by reason of the last.</P>
<P>EARLY Marriages would be a means of preventing many of those Mischiefs, and the Disgrace which of∣tentimes the Guilty this way bring upon themselves and Families. A noted Physician of our own, in his Book of the Parts of Generation, advises to it, and says, <Q>That for want of it, as the Stream is damm'd up with untemper'd Mortar, it doth and will rage the more, and a vent one way or other it will and must have, for that all, of both Sexes, from a natural Instinct, when arrived to the Years of Puberty, and enjoy their full

Health and Strength, have amorous Motions, especial∣ly those of Sanguine Complexions, and Hot Tempe∣raments; who for want of Marriage, and a due awe upon themselves, are prompted to commit unlawful Actions, or else are subject to involuntary POLLU∣TIONS, which if frequent and profuse, do a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cer∣tainly breed Diseases, (in Men) as those that are done with the Consent; and if they are kept from Mar∣riage by a kind of force, as many are when their In∣clinations are strong towards it; they are the more eager for it, (it being a corrupt Humour, to be strong∣er in our Passions, when we are deny'd) and so often∣times for want of a natural Stream, are over-run into unnatural Practices: And not only the Male Youth in particular, but the Female, when arrived to the Years of Puberty, and give themselves up to Plays, Balls, Mens Company, wanton Discourse, high living and the like, whereby the Humours are heated, and the Desire augmented, have Inclinations to Venery, and sometimes so insuperable, that if Marriage be deny'd them, it puts them upon easing themselves <HI>Pro∣pria Pollutoine;</HI> or brings them into <HI>Chachexies, Hysterick Fits,</HI> the <HI>Green Sickness,</HI> or other Mala∣dies not presently to be Remedied: And this great Inconvenience, <HI>says he,</HI> would be more frequent than it is, did not pious Education, regard to Reputation and Health, and inbred Modesty, temper, and asswage those inordinate Commotions of the Mind. Where∣fore he advises Parents to instill wholesome Principles in their Children, and not neglect marrying them in time, as the best way to secure to them a good Con∣science, perfect Health and Strength, and the Honour of their Families.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="002573_0054_0FDB7B23D2C582F0"/>ST. <HI>Paul,</HI> Counsels Parents, <HI>Not to suffer their Virgins,</HI> (both Sexes) <HI>to pass the Flower of their Youth;</HI> but not meaning, as I suppose, to encourage too early, or unseasonable Marriages; for when so young, that either of them, have neither Mind nor need, it exhausts their vital Moisture, nips them in the Bud, stunts their Growth, and renders them for ever after weak and enfeebled; but when the Man is in his 25th, and the Woman in her 20th Year, and both have retained their Virginity till then, and were born of Healthy, Sound Parents, not tainted with any ill <HI>Sta∣men,</HI> and each in perfect Sanity, of good Constitutions, full of ardent Love and Vigour, Those I would advise to marry, and from their Loins, there will result the best, most Vegete, Lovely, Strong, and Healthy Posterity.</P>
<P>TO secure Youth from wasting their Strength by SELF-POLLUTION, or <HI>Venery,</HI> till that Age, they are so careful in some Countries, that they <HI>Ring</HI> the Men, when they are young. And for the Female Sex, <HI>Paracelsus</HI> advises to a famous <HI>Emplastick Liniment,</HI> both of which, being used as I have seen describ'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Health, Strength, Beauty, and Credit, to say no more, of Hundreds, I may say Thousands of young People of both Sexes in this Kingdom, would be preserved, and consequently our puny half gotten Breed, in a great Measure amended.</P>
<P>MARRIAGE, as it is Honourable in all Countries, so it has been held in great Esteem from the beginning of the World, among all Sorts and Sects of People; the <HI>Romans,</HI> and especially the wise Emperour <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI> did what they could to encourage it, the same did the <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> at their Fes∣tivals, would not admit of any single Men; and if

those that were unmarried, ventur'd to come amongst them, they were, as soon as discover'd, order'd to be whipt by the Women as unprofitable Members of the Republick; nor were any but Married Men, suffer'd to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r any Office; so that throughout the World, as an encouragement to Matrimony, the Married Men were highly preferr'd, excus'd from going to the Wars for the first Year after Marriage, and in every thing had the Advantage of those that liv'd single.</P>
<P>THOSE who have not only injur'd their Souls, but likewise their Bodies visibly, by this Practice of SELF-POLLUTION, if the Case be Chirurgical, ought immediately to repair to a skilful Surgeon. Of <HI>Im∣potency, Infertility,</HI> and other Infirmities of this kind, as there are several Degrees, in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> difficult to be Cur'd than others. Where the Strength is but in Part decay'd, the Blood not altogether dispi∣rited, and the Tone of the Parts but lately relax'd, Cold-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athing has been beneficial to many; in some only accompanied with a Milk-Diet, in others with a more nutritious manner of Living, gentle Exercise, and a few Restorative Medicines. But as every Body cannot bear the Cold-Bath, and Milk does not agree with all Constitutions, in such Cases, as well as others more stubborn and deplorable, as it is impossible to give general Rules for so many Particulars, I would advise every Body to apply themselves to a learned and experienc'd Physician, and without Hesitation open their Case, which, if he be a sagacious Man, may be done with very few Hints, and so contriv'd, that the Phy∣sician shall not know the Patient.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June <HI>5. 1717.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am altogether a Stranger to your Person, yet having read a little Book of yours, I am become acquainted with your refined Notions, and like what you have said against one particular Species of Uncleanness: I bought your Book in hopes you had said something concerning the Married State; what Decorum there must be observ'd not to defile the Marriage Bed; I wish you had said some∣thing more on that Point, for the sake of some of my own Sex, I have disputed with: They have such gross Notions, they imagine the Marriage-Bed can't be defil'd unless they commit <HI>Adultery.</HI> I fancy, <HI>Sir,</HI> you have finer Thoughts than to think Marriage a Provision for the Man's Brutality, therefore I have used the Freedom to address my self to you, hoping you will vouchsafe to tell me whether I am not right in this Particular. First then▪ I consider those In∣clinations were given for the Continuance of our Spe∣cies and no other end, and Marriage instituted that it might be in a decent regular manner; therefore, <HI>Fornication</HI> was forbid, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it is in it se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but it not making for the Good of Society; 'tis fitter one Man abide by one Woman, that there may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due Care of the Offsprings Education. To be Instru∣mental to introduce poor Creatures into the World, and not to take Care of them is worse than the Brutes. SELF-POLLUTION you have proved a Sin, be∣cause 'tis deo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ninate from the End; 'tis an Abuse
<PB N="52" REF="002573_0058_0FDB7B2A7803F740"/>
of the Creative Power, and very properly I think you term it Murder. Now what is in self Evil, Marriage can't make Good, therefore I conclude the Marriage-Bed defil'd, the Man and Wife committing Sin, when the End can't be had for which that Sen∣sation was given; for tho' the Man be at all Times capable of Generation, the Woman is not, as when she has Conceiv'd; and when she, accoring to the Course of Nature, is past it, it then centers in the Pleasure of Sense, and is a Frustraneous Abuse of their Bodies, the same in my Opinion with SELF-POLLUTION and SODOMY. The Man being at all Times capable of Generation, has made me sometimes think the Men might have Plurality of Wives; but then I consider, GOD made but one Woman for the Man. <HI>Sir,</HI> I'll tire you no longer with my Impertinency, only to beg Pardon for this Freedom, and to crave the Favour of a Line or two, which I assure you <HI>Sir,</HI> will infinitely oblige her that is</P>

<HEAD>The ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Reason why in the ONANIA, I did not med∣dle with any Part of Uncleanness relating to the Married-State, is, because I always did as I still do con∣ceive,
<PB N="53" REF="002573_0059_0FDB7B505004C4E0"/>
that no Branch of it could have any Affinity with the Sin of ONAN, and consequently was foreign to my Purpose. But as your ingenious Letter, and the Scruple you seem to labour under, are well worthy of the most serious Reflections, I shall endeavour, as far as I am able, to satisfy you in the Particular on which you require my pinion; and in order to it, desire you to be referr'd to the following Answer.</P>
<P>IN the first Place I am altogether of your Opinion, and think it undeniable, that the Inclinations you hint at were given us for the continuane of our Species, and no other End. Secondly, I am forc'd to allow, that where that End cannot be had, as when the Woman has conceiv'd or by the Course of Nature is past it, all em∣braces are Frustraneous, and can center in nothing but the Pleasure of sense, and I would think my self oblig'd to subscribe to all the Consequences you can infer from it, if I was not assur'd that you are mistaken as to the End of Marriage and the Sinfulness of <HI>Fornication.</HI> In Re∣lation to the latter you imagine that it is forbid, not because it is in it self Evil, but as it is destructive to the good of Society: This is a dangerous Assertion, and gives too great a handle for <HI>Deists</HI> and other <HI>Libertines,</HI> who would perswade the World, that Religion is only a Political Invention, and no farther to be minded, than as it is Beneficial to the Order and Government of Society.</P>
<P>THE only Rule a Christian is to walk by, is the Word of God; where his Precept is Plain, we are restrain'd from any other Standard of the Lawfulness or Unlawfulness of an Action whether it brings a visible Good or a visible Evil, either to our selves or the Pub∣lick. The Justice of GOD is as incomprehensible, as his Mercy. What could, to humane Understanding, be more innocent than the Eating of an Apple? And yet
<PB N="54" REF="002573_0060_0FDB7B30D261E6F0"/>
what Crime was ever more severely punish'd? The Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> was not Luxury, nor Wantonness, but Disobedience, and consisted solely in the Transgression of a direct Command of his Creator; that <HI>Fornication</HI> is forbid, is plain from Holy Writ; but why is it for∣bid, is Arrogance to determine. When our Notions are too much refin'd, they are apt to lead us into Er∣ror. You say that <HI>Fornication</HI> not making for the good of Society, it is better one Man abide by one Women, that there may be a due care taken of the Offsprings Education: This is as strong an Argument against <HI>Poligamy,</HI> as it is against <HI>Fornication,</HI> and therefore is not calculated for the good of Societies in general; for among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and those Hea∣thens whose Religion allows them a Plurality of Wives, there are Nations as Flourishing and Populous as there are among the Christians, and the Neglect of the Offspring is no greater Complaint among them than it is among us. What you add to strengthen your Argument, that to be Instrumental to introduce poor Creatures into the World, and not to take Care of them, is to be worse than the Brutes, I will easily grant, but am apt to think, that in saying this, you made not a due Reflection on the true Reason why <HI>Fornication</HI> among us, is so often the Cause of this Piece of In∣humanity which you justly condemn.</P>
<P>MARRIAGE is honourable throughout Christendom, not so much on a Religious Account, and because it is a State entered into by the Institution of GOD; but chiefly as it is a Fashion and Custom every way countenanc'd and encourag'd by the Laws of the Land, a Formality, which we see that even those of the highest Rank, Kings and Emperors not excepted, are proud to submit to. Among all Ranks and Qua∣lities of People, there are Women deeply involved in
<PB N="55" REF="002573_0061_0FDB7B5198DCF1C8"/>
Sin, and wholly neglectful of almost every Christian Duty; yet those of them who are Fashionable, and would be counted to understand themselves, will, out of Pride only, without any other Consideration, al∣ways refuse to converse with any of their Sex, that are openly known to have forfeited their Honour. As by this caution Strumpets are render'd despicable, so becomes their Offspring, and all Bastards must infalli∣bly bring Shame and Ignominy, which prove so often fatal to the Lives as well as Fortunes of illegitimate Children. But notwithstanding all this, those who are Spurious, and born out of Wedlock, are only infamous in Comparison to those who are born in Wedlock from the same Parents, or others of the same Degree: The natural Son of a great Prince, will always have the Precedency of the most legitimate Child of a Pea∣sant; from whence it is plain, that in a Country where one Man was not to be confin'd to one Woman, and no Body was to be Married, the Issue of one Woman would not be less honourable to the Father, than the Issue of another, and consequently no Man could be aw'd by that Ignominy and Reproach, which with us are certainly the chief, if not the only Causes of the little Provision you complain, is generally made for the Offspring of <HI>Fornication.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be imagin'd, that Men or Women should take less Care of their Offspring than other Creatures, if they were not diverted from it by a more pressing Motive than Brutes are capable of acting from. Avarice is sometimes more powerful then the strongest Ties of Nature; and the Fear of Death it self, is over∣come by the fear of Shame only: However our Passions may impose upon us, Men generally love every Thing for their own sakes, and Self love is, conspicuous, even in Suicide. The Love of rational Creatures to their
<PB N="56" REF="002573_0062_0FDB7B32C5A246A8"/>
Children, arises not so much from a natural Instinct, as is commonly imagin'd, and depends very much on the Delight they take in, and the various Comforts they receive from them; and if we would enter into the true Cause why illegitimate Children are generally more neglected than others, we must compare the Scan∣dal of having half a dozen Bastards, to the Applause and Credit which People receive from the Education and all the good Qualities of so many lawful Children, and we shall find that it is altogether owing to the Shame &amp; Ignominy of it, occasion'd by a Custom, which never could be introduced in any Society, before Marriage had been Time out of Mind in fashion among them. I have urged this so far to make it evident, that you are mistaken as to the End of Marriagei; because it would be absurd to imagine that Marriage was instituted to prevent a Mischief, which could have no Being, if People did not Marry at all. Marriage then is of a more Sacred Original, and was instituted for Reasons more worthy of the Holiness of GOD, than the pro∣curing of temporal Felicity, the Good of Society, or any other political Consideration. Throughout the Scriptures it is manifest, that GOD has no greater A∣version to any Thing than Uncleanness of all Sorts; it would be inconsistent with his Purity, that he should suffer rational Creatures, made after his own Image, promiscuously to mix themselves with one another like brute Beasts: For this Reason he has will'd, that one Man should abide with one Woman, and, <HI>vice versa,</HI> till the Death of either; and to render this Agreement for Life more solemn, he has honour'd it with that Institution which we call Marriage.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, it will easily appear, that the most palpable End of Matrimony to be trac'd from Holy Writ, is to prevent the Sin of Uncleanness,
<PB N="57" REF="002573_0063_0FDB7B544A844E78"/>
that is, hinder all People in whom Carnal Desires are stirred up, from <HI>Fornication,</HI> SELF-POLLUTION, and other sorts of Defilements. From this End of Matrimony I argue thus; Whatever, instead of pro∣moting, is destructive to the sacred End of Marriage, could never be requir'd from us by GOD; but the Forbearance you plead for is such, <HI>Ergo,</HI> it could never, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As for Instance, could you imagine that a young lustful Man, full of Health, after having lain four or five Weeks with a Woman he likes, should now be more able to restrain and curb his carnal Appetites, than he was before he had touchd a Woman? Matrimony at this Rate, instead of ren∣dering People more chaste, would serve rather to whet their Lust, and prompt them on to all manner of Uncleanness. If it be objected, that a lasting Sickness of the Wife, or the long Absence of the Husband, to which most Military, and all Seafaring Men are subject, may produce the same Inconveniency, I ans∣wer, that there is a great difference between Acci∣dents and Misfortunes, that may put a stop to the Commerce between a Man and his Wife, and a settled Abstinence as it were entail'd on the State of Ma∣trimony, and which you imagine all married People ought to comply with. Besides, the Sickness of the Wife is a Calamity inflicted by the Hand of GOD on the Husband, as well as her self, and may serve to put them both in mind of their Duty: And those who are exposed to the Sea, or engag'd in other perilous Enterprizes, may even from thence reap Materials to subdue Lust and other disorderly Passions; and in these Cases, to overcome all Temptation, they shall have the express Word of GOD to assist them: The Hope of everlasting Glory may excite them to the Obedience of the divine Commands, as the Fear of eternal Pu∣nishment may deter them from doing Evil, for whe∣ther
<PB N="58" REF="002573_0064_0FDB7B3462BFFF00"/>
the Man or his Wife be Sick or Well, present or far off, the nuptial Vow, till the Death of either se∣parates the Union, cannot be broke, and GOD's Command against Adultery is as plain as it is strict.</P>
<P>BUT what shall we say to a young Couple, both in Health, that live in Peace and Harmony, and have been a considerable Time striving to render themselves delightful and endearing to each other? How shall they practice this Forbearance, when every Night, naked, they lie in the same Bed together, as most mean People can make no other Shift? This to some would be an insupportable Temptation: But what Reasons, what Inducements, shall make them undergo this severe Abstinence, or rather excruciate themselves with this intollerable Pennance? What Hope have they to excite them to this extraodinary Piece of Purity, or what can frighten them from an imaginary Sin, against which there is no express Command of GOD? Nay, which way shall they imagine That to be a Transgression, concerning which the Scriptures are altogether silent, both Old and New Testament?</P>
<P>IT is inconsistent with the Goodness, nay the Justice of GOD, that any Action in his Eye should be so heinous a Sin as Sodomy, and that he either by his Precept, or the Example of Punishment in others, should not have warn'd us against it. There are many Duties incumbent on married People that are expresly commanded, and not so easily observ'd: The real Difficulties that may occur in that State, are sufficient; we need not, by being over nice, invent any more.</P>
<P>I Am of your Opinion, that there is a Decorum to be observ'd as to the Marriage-Bed, and therefore
<PB N="59" REF="002573_0065_0FDB7B5542E5D240"/>
think that all Excesses and Indecencies, that are de∣structive either to Health or Chastity, are Sinful, and from this I have my Warrant from Scripture; but I likewise think that it cannot actually be defiled with∣out a third Person, and then my Sentiment is, that all shameful Freedoms with others, defile it almost e∣qually with Adultery it self. The Compliment you design me, by fancying that I have finer Thoughts than to think Marriage a Provision for the Man's Bru∣tality, I cannot accept of, for I sincerely believe that State to be a lawful Refuge to all, who from a Fault either of their Constitution or manner of Living, find themselves incapable of remaining single without Sin; therefore I would not scruple to call Marriage a Provision for Incontinence in either Sex.</P>
<P>BUT I am at a loss for the meaning of the word Brutality; for if you give this Name to all Embraces in general, you include the most Lawful ones, even those tending only to Procreation, &amp; then the Expression is very injurious; but if you call so all Commerce with Women after they have conceiv'd, or are past it, the Word is the most improper in the World; for how can that be Brutality, what Brutes are not won't to do?</P>
<P>I WOULD not have you tell me, that what I say now, shews the Practice to be against Nature, and that Men, always refining upon their Passions, have by their Luxury wrapt the very Bent of their natural Appetites, and so accustomed themselves to Enormities, which Beasts themselves are not guilty of. There is a vast dif∣ference betwixt irrational Creatures and our own Species; we may often observe the same Operations in both from very different Principles. It is true, that the Females of most Brutes never admit the Males all the Time of their Pregnancy. But at the Seasons
<PB N="60" REF="002573_0066_0FDB7B35DF2DBC38"/>
when their procreative Appetite stimulates them to Coition, such a Ferment is stirr'd up within them, as Advertises all Males round them, and some at a great distance, of their Salacity. The Females that are af∣fected with this, are always capable of being impreg∣nated, and without it no Male sollicites them. I need not tell you that our Species is destitute of this Piece of Knowledge; but shall only observe, that the very want of this Instinct in Men, is another Argument against you. For is it to be imagin'd, that GOD should have denied us a Faculty, (granted to Brutes) if it was of so great a Concern to our eternal Happi∣ness, as this would be, if what you urge was true? Would it not be clashing with the divine Justice, to have made an Action heinously Criminal, of which we are not sure whether we commit it or not?</P>
<P>THE Business of Conception is full of Uncertainty; Many Women, even such as had been Mothers before, have been impos'd upon by Flatulencies and other Ailments, and thought themselves with Child, and to be Deliver'd, when at last they have brought forth nothing but Wind; others again have attributed that to Diseases, for Months together, which has been really owing to their being impregnated, and fallen in Labour before they suspected themselves to be with Child: And in some the only Sign to be rely'd on that Women have not Conceiv'd, has continu'd to appear regularly all the Time of their Pregnancy. Multitudes of Women likewise, have had reason to think themselves past Child-bearing, and after that brought fine Children into the World: From whence it is evident, that if what you condemn, was so heinous a Sin as <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and by every Body believed to be such, Procreation it self would suffer very much. The Danger of committing so capital a Crime, would render

good People cautious beyond Necessity. The Uncer∣tainty I have spoke of, would raise a thousand Scru∣ples to obstruct the nuptial Enjoyments, and the Fear of having conceiv'd already, would in many Cases hin∣der them from conceiving at all.</P>
<P>THERE is in the History of the Old Testament like∣wise a Circumstance that seems to make against you, and which I would have you seriously to consider. If GOD has willed, that Men should practise the For∣bearance you urge, it is not to be thought that the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> to whom GOD has from Time to Time revealed himself in so peculiar a Manner, could have been ignorant of it. <HI>Abraham</HI> then we'll say was well acquainted with GOD's Will as to this particular; but how comes it, that in this Part of the sacred His∣tory, there is not the least Shadow of Reason to make us believe, that <HI>Abraham</HI> had left off all carnal Com∣merce with <HI>Sarah,</HI> when it had ceas'd with her to be after the Manner of Women, but rather the contrary? For had <HI>Abraham</HI> discontinued the nuptial Embraces, there is no doubt but he would have acquainted <HI>Sarah</HI> with the Reason of it, which alone would have been sufficient Ground for her Disbelief, when the <HI>Angel</HI> foretold that she was to a have Son. She knew that when she was young, and her Husband likewise in the Prime of his Age, and there was no visible Impediment why she should have no Children, she had all along re∣main'd infertile, which made her wonder how she should now conceive, when she had such manifest To∣kens of being past Child-bearing, and her Husband was of a declining Age, and his Vigour much diminished. It was this that provoked her Laughter; she was far from reflecting on the Forbearance of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Benevolence, and seemed rather, when she laughed, conscious of the many fruitless Endeavours they had
<PB N="62" REF="002573_0068_0FDB7B3D409961A0"/>
made since their Youth. It is likewise to be observed, that when <HI>Sarah</HI> said that her Lord was <HI>likewise</HI> Old, she could not mean that he was impotent by Age, and incapable of performing the conjugal Rites: The contrary appeared after <HI>Sarah</HI>'s Death; for he marri∣ed another Wife, and had at least six Children by her, so that she only called him Old in respect to his first Vigour, which certainly was decreas'd.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if <HI>Sarah</HI> had the least Suspicion that it was a Sin for Men to meddle with their Wives after they were past Child-bearing, she would never have alledged, as a Reason of her Unbelief, that her Lord <HI>likewise</HI> was Old; for if the Act it self had been an Indecency, a Thing never practis'd, what had it signified whether <HI>Abraham</HI> was Old or Young?</P>
<P>WHEN in the beginning of this LETTER, I allowed the Embraces you condemn to be frustraneous, I would only be understood as to Procreation; for else it is ma∣nifest they are of great use to Society: They are the Bond of conjugal Amity, and by their means a thou∣sand little Differences and petty Quarrels are made up between a Man and his Wife, which without them would become wide Breaches, and often render the married Couple for ever irreconcileable. That (as you say) they only center in the Pleasure of Sense, is true, but so does Musick, yet it is not forbid us. What I say of SELF-POLLUTION, you would apply to this, which is wrong. SELF-POLLUTION is not Murder, because what is wasted might prove a Child; if it were, all nocturnal POLLUTIONS, which no Body can prevent, would be so many Murders: But because the Seed is wasted in a sinful Manner, it is a Crime, which GOD has punish'd with Death. This ought not to be confounded with an Action which GOD allows of, if not encourages.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="002573_0069_0FDB7B5CD02992C0"/>BESIDES, from the Time the Woman has conceiv'd, till she is brought to Bed, and got up again, the pro∣creative Faculty in the Man is of no Use: The same ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be said, when the Wife is past Child-bearing; therefore it is plain, what I have said before, that the Forbearance you commend, would destroy the End of Matrimony, as it is manifestly explain'd by St. <HI>Paul;</HI> for after he had told the <HI>Corinthians, that it was good for a Man not to touch a Woman,</HI> he goes on thus: <HI>Nevertheless to avoid</HI> Fornication, <HI>let every Man have his own Wife, and let every Woman have her own Husband.</HI> The Apostle names the <HI>End</HI> of Marriage to them, <HI>to avoid Fornication:</HI> And as he knew very well, that the Ceremony, or having the Name of being married, would not suffice for this, but that the only means to keep People Chast, and hinder them from <HI>Fornication,</HI> was carnal Copulation, and even the frequent Practice of it; therefore he adds, <HI>Let the Husband render to the Wife due Benevolence, and likewise also the Wife unto the Husband.</HI> He speaks of it as a Duty, which both owe to each other, and which ought never to be neglected but by com∣mon Consent, and that only for a little while, and a religious Purpose. <HI>Defraud ye not one another, ex∣cept it be with Consent for a Time, that ye may give your selves to Fasting and Prayer; and come toge∣ther again, that Satan tempt you not for your In∣continency.</HI></P>
<P>IF what you induce us to believe, at the Close of your LETTER concerning your Sex, be true; and the Scruple you propose and which seems to Grave! you, be real, then Madam, I am perswaded you are con∣vinced of your Error before now; and I would not have taken so much Pains, or been so diffusive on this Subject, was I not assured that the same Difficulty is
<PB N="64" REF="002573_0070_0FDB7B3ED2D49650"/>
often started, and the same Arguments are used by Libertines and other lewd Profligates to perplex con∣sciencious People: For the openly Wicked, who nei∣ther can, nor endeavour to hide their own evil Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ses, are always pleas'd when they have an Opportunity by the least shew of Reason, to insinuates; as if all Men were bad alike, and the soberest Part of the World no better than themselves.</P>
<P>I Began my LETTER by telling you, that I thought no Part of Uncleanness, relating to the married State, had any Affinity with the Sin of ONAN; but I have since considered better of it, and am assured, that there are married Persons, who commit a heinous Sin to GOD, by frustrating what he has appointed for the Multiplication of our Species, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> commonly such, as think Children come too Fast, and distrust Provi∣dence for their Maintenance and Education. They in∣dulge themselves in all the Pleasures of Sense, and yet would avoid the Charges they might occasion; in or∣der to which they do what they can to hinder Con∣ception. What I mean, is, when the Man, by a cri∣minal untimely Retreat, disappoints his Wife's as well as his own Fertility. This is what truly may be call'd a frustraneous Abuse of their Bodies, and must be an abominable Sin. Yet it is certain, that Thousands there are in the Married State, who provoke and gratify their Lust, as far as is consistent with this their de∣structive Purpose, and no farther.</P>
