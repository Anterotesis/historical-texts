<HEAD>To the Honourable <HI>EDWARD VER∣NON,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Blue,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have presumed to put the following Sheets under your Protection, tho' we have not the Honour of be∣ing personally known to you, nor have applied to you for the Liberty of using your celebrated Name on this Occasion.</P>
<P>As this Book is a faithful Extract from the Journals of two <HI>British</HI> Seamen, late Officers in his Maje∣sty's Navy, we thought we could not more properly dedicate it than to a <HI>British</HI> Admiral.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="007859_0006_102DDA40DE6207C8"/>
We know your Detestation of Flattery; and you know, from long Experience, that a <HI>British</HI> Seaman hath a Spirit too brave to stoop to so degenerate a Practice.</P>
<P>The following Pages we hope will recommend themselves to you, be∣cause they are written in a plain maritime Stile, and void of Parti∣ality and Prejudice.</P>
<P>The Distresses mention'd in this Book have perhaps not been equal'd in our Age; and we question whe∣ther any Navigators living have, for so long a Continuance, suffer'd such Variety of Hardships, as the unfortunate People of the <HI>Wager.</HI></P>
<P>After surviving the Loss of the Ship, and combating with Famine, and innumerable Difficulties, a Rem∣nant of us are return'd to our Native Country; but even here we are still unfortunate, destitute of Employ∣ment,
<PB N="vii" REF="007859_0007_102DDA4363135EC0"/>almost without Support, or any Prospect of being restor'd to our Stations, till some important Que∣stions are decided, which cannot be cleared up till the Arrival of our late Captain, or at least the Commodore.</P>
<P>We, Sir, who present you with this Book, have been several Years in the Navy, and thought ourselves well acquainted with its Laws and Discipline, and have many Certifi∣cates to produce, that we have al∣ways acted in Obedience to Com∣mand; but the Proceedings of the Officers and People, since the Loss of the Ship, are reckoned so dark and intricate, that we know not what to expect, nor what will be the Result of our Superiors Deter∣mination.</P>
<P>The only Consolation we have in our present Anxiety, is placed in a Confidence of the unbias'd Integrity,
<PB N="viii" REF="007859_0008_102DDA4553F72908"/>Justice, and Humanity of the Right Honourable Persons who will One Day determine for or against us.</P>
<P>When you read our Account of the Affair, you'll find the Facts impartially related, the whole Nar∣rative written without the least Shadow of Prejudice or Malice, and no more in Favour of ourselves than of the other Officers concern'd: We stand or fall by the Truth; if Truth will not support us, nothing can.</P>
<P>In our Voyage from the <HI>Brazil</HI> to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> we were oblig'd <HI>to you for the generous Treatment we met with from an Enemy, a Subject of</HI> Spain, <HI>a Person of Distinction, and a Passenger in the same Ship:</HI> Your Virtues have procured you the E∣steem even of your Enemies.</P>
<P>Your Zeal for the <HI>National Ser∣vice,</HI> deserves the Love of every <HI>Honest Briton:</HI> To leave an abun∣dant
<PB N="ix" REF="007859_0009_102DDA4796FF8320"/>Fortune, your Family, and your Country, to hazard your Life in the most perilous Expeditions, with no other Motive than to re∣trieve the Honour of the Nation, shows the Spirit of a true <HI>British</HI> Hero, and deserves the highest Commendations.</P>
<P>That you, SIR, may never de∣viate from your Integrity, but con∣tinue a Terror to the Enemies of <HI>Britain,</HI> an Honour to his Majes∣ty's Service, and an Ornament to your Country, are the sincere Wish∣es of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED><HI>Your most dutiful, And most obedient Humble Servants,</HI> JOHN BULKELEY, JOHN CUMMINS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS an Introduction, we think proper to ac∣quaint the Reader with our Reasons for causing the following Sheets to be made publick to the World. The chief Motive, which induced us to this Task, was to clear our Characters, which have been exceedingly blemish'd by Per∣sons who (next to Heaven) owe the Preservation of their Lives to our Skill, and indefatigable Care; and who having an Opportunity of arriving be∣fore us in <HI>England,</HI> have endeavour'd to raise their Reputation on the Ruin of Ours.</P>
<P>It will appear to the Reader, on Perusal of the following Pages, that this Journal was at∣tempted to he taken from us by Violence at <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> that we have preserved it, at the Ha∣zard of our Lives; that there was no Journal kept after the Loss of the Ship, by any Officers but ourselves; and if we had not been careful in making Remarks on each Day's Transactions, Persons must have continued in the Dark, in re∣lation to all the subsequent Proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="007859_0011_102DDA4C9579C998"/>
It is a very usual Thing to publish Voyages, especially when the Navigators have met with any extraordinary Events. We believe, our Expedi∣dition, though it was not a Secret, is allowed to be an extraordinary One, and consequently at∣tended with extraordinary Events: Indeed while the Commodore was with us, every thing went well, but when the Squadron separated, Things began to have a new Face; after the Loss of the <HI>Wager,</HI> there was a general Disorder and Con∣fusion among the People, who were now no longer implicitly obedient. There were two Seamen par∣ticularly, who propogated this Confusion, they said they had suffer'd Ship-wreck in his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Biddeford,</HI> and received no Wages from the Day that the Ship was lost; that when they were out of Pay, they look'd upon themselves as their own Masters, and no longer subjected to Command. The People however were not alto∣gether infected, but still continued to pay a duti∣ful Respect to their Commander; but when the Captain had rashly shot Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> (whose Fate the Reader will find particularly related) they then grew very turbulent and unruly, the Captain daily lost the Love of the Men, who with their Affection lost their Duty.</P>
<P>Our confining the Captain is reckoned an au∣dacious and unprecedented Action, and our not bringing him home with us, is reckon'd worse;
<PB N="xii" REF="007859_0012_102DDA4F1BD20648"/>but the Reader will find that Necessity absolutely compell'd us to act as we did, and that we had sufficient Reasons for leaving him behind.</P>
<P>Our Attempt for Liberty in sailing to the Southward through the Streights of <HI>Magellan</HI> with such a Number of People, slow'd in a Long Boat, has been censur'd as a mad Undertaking: Desperate Diseases require desperate Remedies; had we gone to the Northward, there appear'd no Probability of escaping the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and when we had fallen into their Hands, 'tis not unlikely but they might have employed us as Drudges in their Mines for Life, therefore we rather chose to encounter all Difficulties than to become Slaves to a merciless Enemy.</P>
<P>Some Persons have objected against our Capaci∣ty for keeping a Journal of this Nature; but several Judges of Maritime Affairs, allow this Work to be exact and regular. We think, Per∣sons with a common Share of Understanding are capable of committing to Paper daily Remarks of Matters worthy their Observation, especially of Facts in which they themselves had so large a Share. We only relate such Things as could not possibly escape our Knowledge, and what we ac∣tually know to be true. We don't set up for Na∣turalists and Men of great Learning, therefore have avoided meddling with Things above our Capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="007859_0013_102DDA51C66EA310"/>
We are also condemn'd by many for being too busy and active for Persons in our Stations. There was a Necessity for Action, and a great deal of it too; and had we been as indolent and regardless for the Preservation of the People, as others who were superior in Command, there would not have been so many who were shipwreck'd in the <HI>Wager,</HI> now in <HI>England</HI> to give a Relation of the Matter.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who commanded in the Long-Boat on his Arrival before us at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> re∣presented us to the <HI>English</HI> Merchants in a ve∣ry vile Light, we were even advised by some of our Friends there not to return to our Country, lest we should suffer Death for Mutiny. But when the Gentlemen of the Factory had perus'd our Journal, they found, if there was any Mutiny in the Case, the very Person who accused us, was the Ringleader and chief Mutineer. We were con∣fident of our own Innocence, and determin'd to see our Country at all Events, being positive that we have acted to the best of our Understandings, in all Respects, for the Preservation of our Lives and Liberties; and when our Superiors shall think proper to call us to an Account, which we expect will be at the Commodore's Arrival, we do not doubt but we shall clear ourselves in spite of all invidious Reflections and malicious Imputations.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="007859_0014_102DDA545CFC5960"/>
It has been hinted to us, as if publishing this Journal would give Offence to some Persons of Distinction. We can't conceive how any Trans∣actions relating to the <HI>Wager,</HI> although made e∣ver so publick, can give Offence to any Great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n at Home. Can it be any Offence to tell the World that we were ship-wreck'd in the <HI>Wager,</HI> when all People know it already? Don't they know that the <HI>Wager</HI> was one of his Majesty's Store-Ships? That we had on Board not only Naval Stores but other Stores of an immense Value? Don't they also know that we went abroad with Hopes of acquiring great Riches, but are return'd Home as poor as Beggars? We are guilty of no indecent Reproaches, or unmannerly Reflections; though, it is certain, we cannot but lament our being en∣gaged in so fatal an Expedition. When Per∣sons have surmounted great Difficulties, it is a Pleasure for them to relate their Story; and if we give ourselves this Satisfaction, who has any Cause to be offended? Are we, who have faced Death in so many Shapes, to be intimidated, lest we should give Offence to the—Lord knows whom? We never saw a satyrical Journal in our Lives, and we though that Kind of Wri∣ting was the most obnoxious to give Offence.</P>
<P>It has been a Thing usual, in publishing of Voyages, to introduce abundance of Fiction; and some Authors have been esteem'd merely for being
<PB N="xv" REF="007859_0015_102DDA567569FB10"/>marvelous. We have taken Care to deviate from those, by having a strict Regard to Truth. There are undoubtedly in this Book some Things which will appear incredible. The Account given of the <HI>Patagonian Indians,</HI> and our own Dis∣tresses, tho' ever so well attested, will not easi∣ly obtain Credit; and People will hardly be∣lieve that Human Nature could possibly support the Miseries that we have endured.</P>
<P>All the Difficulties related we have actually endur'd, and perhaps must endure more: Till the Commodore's Arrival we cannot know our Fate; at present we are out of all Employment, and have nothing to support ourselves and Fami∣lies, but the Profits arising from the Sale of our Journal; which perhaps may be the Sum Total we shall ever receive for our <HI>Voyage to the South-Seas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By what is added to this <HI>Second Edition,</HI> it will appear, that after the Arrival of the Captain, the Officers were try'd for the Loft of the Ship, and being all acquitted, except Lieutenant <HI>Beans,</HI> they were paid their Wages to the Time the Ship was wreck'd.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>A VOYAGE TO THE <HI>SOUTH SEAS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Thursday</HI> the 18th of <HI>September</HI> 1740, sailed from St. <HI>Hellens</HI> his Majesty's Ship <HI>Centurion,</HI> Commo∣dore <HI>Anson,</HI> with the <HI>Gloucester, Pearl, Severn, Wager,</HI> and <HI>Tryal,</HI> and two Store Ships; this Squadron was design'd round <HI>Cape Horn</HI> into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> to distress the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in those Parts. The Ships were all in prime Order, all lately rebuilt. The Men were elevated with Hopes of growing im∣mensely rich, and in a few Years of returning to <HI>Old England</HI> loaden with the Wealth of their Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007859_0034_102DDA8147BDDF60"/>
<HI>Saturday,</HI> the 20th, the <HI>Ram-head</HI> bearing N. by W. half W. distant four Leagues, the Commodore hoisted his broad Pendant, and was saluted by every Ship in the Squadron, with thirteen Guns each. This Day join'd Company with us his Majesty's Ships, <HI>Dra∣gon, Winchester, Chatham, South-Sea-Castle,</HI> and <HI>Rye-Galley,</HI> with a large Convoy of Merchant Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday,</HI> the 25th, we parted Company with the <HI>Winchester</HI> and the <HI>South-Sea-Castle,</HI> with their Convoys, bound for <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> we parted Company with the <HI>Streights</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> Convoys.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> the 3d, at Eight in the Morning, we saw two Brigantines to the South East; the Commodore gave a Signal to chace; at Nine fired two shot to bring 'em to; at Ten spoke with the Chace, being two Brigs from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> bound for <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> the 26th, about Five in the Morn∣ing, the <HI>Severn</HI> showed Lights, and fired se∣veral Guns a-head; soon after we saw the Land bearing W. by S. and at Noon the East End of <HI>Madeira</HI> bore North, distant five Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> we moored in <HI>Fonchiale</HI> road, so called from a City of that Name, which
<PB N="3" REF="007859_0035_102DDA83C5276D70"/>is the Metropolis of the Island of <HI>Madeira;</HI> here we employ'd most of our Time in getting aboard Water, and stowing our dry Provisions between Decks.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, November</HI> the 4th, Captain <HI>Kidd</HI> our Commander was removed on board the <HI>Pearl,</HI> and the Honourable Captain <HI>Murray</HI> succeeded him in the <HI>Wager.</HI> Captain <HI>Norris</HI> of the <HI>Gloucester</HI> having obtained Leave to re∣turn to <HI>England,</HI> on account of his ill State of Health, occasioned the above removals.</P>
<P>While we lay at <HI>Madeira,</HI> we were in∣formed of ten Sail of Ships cruising off and on, to the Westward; these Ships were judg'd to be <HI>French,</HI> and had been seen every Day for a Week before our Arrival: The Com∣modore sent out a Privateer Sloop, but she returned the Day following, without seeing 'em; so that we can give no Account of 'em.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 5th, we sailed from <HI>Ma∣deira.</HI> On the 20th the <HI>Industry</HI> Store-Ship parted Company; and on <HI>Friday</HI> the 28th, by Account, we cross'd the <HI>Equinoctial.</HI></P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>December</HI> we saw the Island of St. <HI>Catharine,</HI> at Noon; the Northmost Land in Sight bore W. N. W. and the South∣most S. W. by W. Variation <HI>per</HI> Amplitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.57 Easterly.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007859_0036_102DDA8569F53DD0"/>
On the 18th, the North End of the Island of St. <HI>Catharine</HI> bore N. W. by W. distant seven Leagues; and the Island of <HI>Gaul</HI> bore N. W. distant six Leagues.</P>
<P>On the 19th we anchor'd in St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Bay in upward of twelve Fathom Water, the Island <HI>Gaul,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Brazil,</HI> bearing N. by E. distant four Leagues. On the 20th we anchor'd in St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s road, and the Day following we moored between the Island of St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s and the <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 22d, the Commodore or∣dered fresh Beef for the sick People.</P>
<P>On the 27th came in a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Brig from <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> for the <HI>Rio Grand:</HI> While we lay here, the People were generally imploy'd in over-hauling the rigging, and getting a∣board Water.</P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>January</HI> 1741, we sailed from St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s; the Commodore saluted the Fort with eleven Guns, the Fort returned the same Number.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> the 22d we lost sight of the <HI>Pearl.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 17th of <HI>February,</HI> the <HI>Pearl</HI> join'd the Squadron; and on the 19th we came to Anchor off the river of St. <HI>Ju∣lian</HI>'s, on the Coast of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> St. <HI>Julian</HI>'s
<PB N="5" REF="007859_0037_102DDA87F15F2518"/>Hill bearing S. W. by W. and the Southmost Land in sight S. by E. distant from the Shore three Leagues. This Day our Captain, the Honourable <HI>George Murray,</HI> took Command on Board the <HI>Pearl,</HI> Captain <HI>Kidd</HI> having died on the Voyage since we left St. <HI>Catha∣rine</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Kidd</HI> was heard to say, a few Days before his Death, That this Voyage, which both Officers and Sailors had engag'd in, with so much Cheerfulness and Alacrity, would prove in the End very far from their Expectations, notwithstanding the vast Trea∣sure they imagined to gain by it; that it would end in Poverty, Vermin, Famine, Death and Destruction. How far the Cap∣tain's Words were prophetick, will appear in the Course of our Journal. Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> succeeded Captain <HI>Murray</HI> on Board the <HI>Wager.</HI></P>
<P>On the 26th of <HI>February</HI> we sent on Board the <HI>Pearl</HI> twelve Butts and two Puncheons of Water; the <HI>Pearl</HI> having, while she was separated from us, been chased by five large <HI>Spanish</HI> Men of War, the Commander in Chief being distinguish'd by a red broad <HI>Pendant</HI> with a Swallow's Tail at his Main-top-mast Head, and a red Flag at his Ensign-staff:
<PB N="6" REF="007859_0038_102DDA8AAD33C700"/>During the Chace, the <HI>Pearl,</HI> in order to clear Ship, threw over-board and stove four∣teen Tons of Water; she likewise stove the Long Boat, and threw her over-board, with Oars, Sails and Booms, and made all clear for engaging; but Night coming on, at Seven o'Clock lost Sight of the Enemy; at Five in the Morning saw the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships from the Mast-head, two Points on the Lee-quar∣ter, still giving Chace, and crowding all the Sail they could; but at Nine the <HI>Pearl</HI> lost Sight of 'em entirely. We judg'd this to be Admiral <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arro</HI>'s Squadron, sent out in Pur∣suit of Commodore <HI>Anson.</HI> Had our Ships united fallen in with 'em, 'tis probable we might have given a good Account of 'em. While we lay at St. <HI>Julian</HI>'s, we saw the Sea full of Shrimps, and red as if they were boiled; the Water appeared tinctured to that Degree, that it look'd like Blood.</P>
<P>On the 27th, we sent on board the <HI>Pearl</HI> four Puncheons of Water more; at Six in the Morning, the Commodore made Signal to weigh; at Eight weigh'd, and came to Sail; this Day we lost Sight of the <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>The 28th, the <HI>Gloucester</HI> came into the Squadron again.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007859_0039_102DDA8C6950D010"/>
On the 7th of <HI>March</HI> we pass'd through the Streights of <HI>Le Mair;</HI> Cape <HI>Diego</HI> on the Island of <HI>Terra del Fuego</HI> bore N. W. by W. three Leagues, and the West End of the Island, Staten Land, bore E. N. E. distant Four Leagues, the Squadron under reeft Courses.</P>
<P>On the 10th we lost sight of the <HI>Ann</HI> Pink, on the 12th carried away the rails and Tim∣bers of the Head on both Sides.</P>
<P>On the 16th the <HI>Ann</HI> Pink join'd the Squa∣dron again.</P>
<P>The 30th the <HI>Gloucester</HI> broke her Main-Yard in the Slings.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 1st, the Commodore order'd Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> the Carpenter, on Board the <HI>Glou∣cester.</HI></P>
<P>On the 8th carried away the Mizen-Mast, two Feet above the Awning; there was no Sail on the Mast. Upon the rowl of a Sea, all the Chain Plates to Wind-ward broke, Lat. 56.31. Long. 87.4 West. At Noon Cape St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> bore North 84 Deg. E. distant 229 Leagues.</P>
<P>The 10th lost Sight of the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl,</HI> Lat 56.29. Long. 85. West. At Ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Night feel in with two small Islands; at Eight in the Morning the Islands bore N. N. W. by the Compass, distant eight Leagues, in the
<PB N="8" REF="007859_0040_102DDA8EAE90B720"/>Latitude 54.00 South; we took 'em for the Islands which lay off <HI>Brewer's Streights,</HI> Lati∣tude 54.50 South, Long. 84.56 West.</P>
<P>On the 12th we had very hard Gales at West, with the largest Swell I ever saw; I was Officer of the Watch (tho' I was Gunner of the Ship, I had the Charge of a Watch during the whole Voyage;) we had our Lar∣board Tacks on Board: Between Six and Seven in the Morning, holding by the Top∣sail Hallyards to Wind-ward, there broke a Sea in the Ship, which carried me over the Wheel, bilg'd the Cutter, and canted her off the Skeets Bottom up athwart the Barge; it likewise half filled the Long-Boat; the Boat∣swain was for heaving the Cutter over-board, I order'd him to do nothing with her till I had acquainted the Captain, who was then very ill in his Cabbin: The Captain desi∣red me to use all Means to save the Cutter; at the same Time I asked Leave to skuttle the Long-Boat, and get the Sprit-sail Yard and Jib in, for fear of endangering the Bowsprit; which he order'd to be done, and told me, it was a very great Misfortune that he should be ill at such a Time. When I came from the Captain, I found the Lieutenant on the Deck, got the Cutter in her Place, skuttled
<PB N="9" REF="007859_0041_102DDA90F04B1150"/>the Long-Boat, and got the Sprit-sail Yard and Jib-boom in. The Carpenter is still a∣board the <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>The 13th, under reeft Courses, the Lar∣board Tacks; the Commodore being on the Weather Quarter, bore down under our Lee, and spoke, with us. He ask'd the Captain, If the Carpenter was return'd from the <HI>Glou∣cester?</HI> The Captain answer'd, No; and am surpriz'd Capt. <HI>Mitchell</HI> should detain him, when he knows I must want him about my Mizen-mast. The Commodore told him he would speak with the <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and or∣der him on Board. He then ask'd the Cap∣tain, Why he did not set the Main-top-sail, and make more Sail? Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI> made Answer, My rigging is all gone, and broke fore and aft, and my People almost all taken ill, and down; but I will set him as soon as possible. The Commodore desired he would, and make what Sail he could after him.</P>
<P>The 14th, the Carpenter return'd from the <HI>Gloucester,</HI> it being the only Day this Fort∣night a Boat could live in the Sea. As soon as the Carpenter came on Board, he waited on the Captain, who order'd him to look on the Chain Plates and Chains, and to give his Opinion of the Mast's going away. The
<PB N="10" REF="007859_0042_102DDA932CD22EA0"/>Carpenter look'd as order'd, and gave Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI> for Answer, That the Chain Plates were all broke. The Captain shook his Head, and said, Carpenter! That is not the Reason of the Mast's going away. The Carpenter not willing, as the Mast was gone, to lay it to any one's Mismanagement, or to occasion any Uneasiness about what was now past Prevention, fitted a Cap on the Stump of the Mizen-mast, got up a lower Studding-same Time fix'd her Main-Yard;
sail-Boom, of 40 Feet, and hoisted a Sail to keep the Ship to.</P>
<P>To-day, being the 19th, and the finest Day we had in these Seas, we were employ'd in repairing the rigging; we bent a new Main-Sail, and reeft him, as did the <HI>Ann</HI> Pink; the <HI>Gloucester</HI> at the same Time fix'd her Main-Yard; the Commodore and <HI>Tryal</HI> keep∣ing a-head, and at a considerable Distance; between Four and Six at Night saw the Com∣modore's Light. At Six, being reliev'd by the Master, he could not see the Commo∣dore's Light, tho' it was visible to every one else on the Quarter-Deck: The Master persisted he could not see it; on which I went and acqauinted the Captain, who came upon Deck, and seeing the Light, ask'd the Master, Where his Eyes were? This was the last
<PB N="11" REF="007859_0043_102DDA9514916568"/>Time I ever saw the Commodore. The Lieutenant having the first Watch lost Sight of him at Nine o'Clock, and at Ten was oblig'd to hand the Fore-Sail; in the doing of which we lost a Seaman over-board. We saw the <HI>Gloucester.</HI> and <HI>Ann</HI> Pink a-stern in the Morning; but they were soon gone a∣head, and out of Sight.</P>
<P>The 21st, as I was in the Steward's room, <HI>Joseph King,</HI> Seaman, came for a Pound of Bread. I heard him ask the Steward, If he thought they would be serv'd with the same Quantity of Water as before? Without waiting for an Answer, No, G—d d—n 'em; as the Commodore was parted, they shou'd find the Difference. Not knowing the Con∣sequence of this, or by whom the Fellow might be spirited up, I acquainted the Cap∣tain with the Affair, who order'd me to deli∣ver a Brace of Pistols charg'd with a Brace of Balls to every Officer in the Ship who wanted 'em, and to take no further Notice of the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 1st. This Day the Officers were call'd, and their Opinions ask'd concerning the best Bower-Anchor; resolv'd to cut the Anchor away, for fear of endangering the Ship, there being no Possibility of securing
<PB N="12" REF="007859_0044_102DDA9709CFB418"/>it without putting our Fore Mast in extre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Danger, the Shrouds and Chain Plates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g all broke.</P>
<P>Fourteen Days before the Loss of the Ship, the Wind at S. and S. S. W. steer'd N. W. by N. and N. N. W. by the Compass: Laid the Ship to for the first four Nights; the mean∣ing of this I could not learn. I ask'd the Lieutenant the reason of our bearing for the Land on a Lee Shore, when we had a fair Wind for our rendezvous, which I had always thought was for the Island of <HI>Juan Ferdinandez.</HI> The Lieutenant told me the rendezvous was alter'd to an Island in the Latitude of 44 S. Upon this I said to the Lieutenant, This is a very great Misfor∣tune to us; that we can do nothing with the Ship in the Condition she is in upon a Lee-shore; and am surpriz'd, that we should be oblig'd to go there. The Lieutenant told me, he had said every Thing he could to dis∣suade the Captain from it, but found him de∣termin'd to go there. The fifth Night, and every Night after, made Sail; the Wind to the Westward. I never reliev'd the Lieute∣nant, but I ask'd him, what he thought of a Lee-shore with the Ship in this Condition? he always reply'd, He could not tell. We
<PB N="13" REF="007859_0045_102DDA9952CB7660"/>saw rock-weed in abundance pass by the Ship. The Honourable <HI>John Byron,</HI> Mid∣shipman, being on the Quarter Deck, said, We can't be far off the Land by these Weeds. The Lieutenant and Mate being by, I said, Gentlemen, what can we do with the Ship in the miserable Condition she is in on a Lee-shore? The Leiutenant answer'd, When∣ever I have been with the Captain since our first lying to, I always perswaded him to go for <HI>Juan Ferdinandez;</HI> therefore I would have you go to him, he may be perswaded by you, tho' he will not by me. I said, If that was the Case, my going to him is need∣less. In a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, the Captain sent for me, and said, Gunner! What Longitude have you made? I told him 82. 30. What distance do you reckon yourself off the Land? I answer'd, about 60 Leagues: But if the two Islands we saw are those which are laid down in your Chart to lay off <HI>Brewer</HI>'s <HI>Streights,</HI> and the same Current continues with the Western swell, we can't be above a third Part of the Distance off the Land. The Captain made Answer, as for the Cur∣rents, there is no Account to be given for 'em; sometimes they set one Way, and some∣times another. I said, Sir, very true; but
<PB N="14" REF="007859_0046_102DDA9B3979BAD8"/>as the Ship has been always under reeft Courses, with the Mizen-Mast gone, she must wholly drive to Leeward, and nigher the Land than expected. The Captain then told me, I suppose you are not unacquainted of my rendezvous for the Island of <HI>Nostra Signora Di Socora,</HI> in the Latitude of 44. I reply'd, Sir, the Ship is in a very bad Condition to come in with the Lee-shore; and if it is possible to bring the Ship to an Anchor, we shall never purchase him again. The Captain answer'd, I don't design to come to an Anchor; for there are no Soundings until you come within seven Leagues of the Land. I purpose to stand off and on twenty-four Hours; and if I don't see the Commo∣dore, or any of the Squadron in that Time, we will go for <HI>Juan Ferdinandez.</HI> To this I said, Sir, the Ship is a perfect Wreck; our Mizen-Mast gone, with our standing rig∣ging afore and abaft, and all our People down; therefore I can't see what we can do in with the Land. The Captain's Answer was, It does not signify, I am oblig'd and determin'd to go for the first rendezvous.</P>
<P>On the 13th, at Eight in the Morning, the Straps of the Fore-Jeer Blocks broke; reeff'd the Top ropes, and lower'd the Yard; went
<PB N="15" REF="007859_0047_102DDA9D60823848"/>to strapping the Blocks. At Nine, the Carpenter going forward to inspect the Chain-Plates, saw the Land from the Fore-Castle; on which he ask'd the Boatswain's Mate, who was by him, If he saw the Land? He answer'd, No. The Carpenter shew'd it him, and he saw it plain. The Carpenter then shew'd it to the Lieutenant; but he would not believe it to be Land, because it bore N. N. W. and said it was impossible; there∣fore he never inform'd the Captain of the Sight of Land, as the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> hath heard the Captain say. At Two in the Afternoon lower'd the Fore-Yard, and hawl'd the Fore-sail up. Notwithstanding I was Officer of the Watch, I was oblig'd to go upon the Fore-Yard, where was Mr. <HI>Camp∣bell</HI> Midshipman, one Boatswain's Mate, four Seamen, and the Master's Servant; which were all the Hands we could get out of the Ship's Company to assist. Whilst on the Yard I saw the Land very plain, on the Lar∣board-beam, bearing N. W. half N. nearest High Land, with Hillocks, and one remark∣able Hommacoe like a Sugar-loaf, very high. At the Sight of Land I came off the Fore-yard, and acquainted the Captain. He imme∣diately gave Orders to sway the Fore-yard
<PB N="16" REF="007859_0048_102DDAA04C4C9710"/>up, and set the Fore-sail; then we wore Ship, with her Head to the Southward. The Cap∣tain coming forward unhappily received a Fall, which dislocated his Shoulder, so that he was obliged to be put into the Surgeon's Cab∣bin. Some Time after he sent for the Lieu∣tenant and myself, acquainting us of the Ne∣cessity there was for making Sail, as being on a Lee-Shore; therefore desired we would use our utmost Endeavours to crowd the Ship off. You see, Gentlemen, said he, my Misfortune will not permit me to continue on the Deck: As for the Master, he is not worthy of the Charge of a Watch; there∣fore I must desire you Mr. <HI>Bulkely,</HI> to be in the Watch with him, and to make but two Watches: Keep a good Look-out, and, if possible, set the Main-top-sail. Mr. <HI>Beans,</HI> I must desire Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> to be with you; and beg you will take all the Care you can. I having the first Watch, set the Main, Fore and Mizen Stay-sails; it blew so hard I found it impossible to set the Main-top-sail; of which I acquainted the Captain: All the Hands we could muster in both Watches, Officers included, were but twelve; the rest of the Ship's Company were all sick below: I very often could get no more than three
<PB N="17" REF="007859_0049_102DDAA1E6709B50"/>Seaman in my Watch. The Ship for these three Weeks hath been no better than a Wreck; the Mizen-mast gone; the standing rigging and Chain-Plates, afore and abaft, mostly broke and ruin'd. The Top-sails now at the Yards are so bad, that if we attempt to loose 'em for making Sail, we are in Danger of splitting 'em; and we have not a spare Sail in the Ship that can be brought to the Yard without being repair'd. This is the present deplorable Situation of the Ship. All the first and middle Watch it blow'd and rain'd; and withal so very dark, that we could not see the Length of the Ship: For the greatest Part of the Night she came up no nearer than S. by W. and S. S. W. At Four in the Morning she came up with her Head West; so that her Head was then off the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, May</HI> the 14th, 1741, at Half an Hour past Four this Morning, the Ship struck abaft on a sunken Rock, sounded fourteen Fathom; but it being impossible to let go the Anchor Time enough to bring her up, be∣ing surrounded on every side with rocks (a very dismal Prospect to behold!) the Ship struck a second Time, which broke the Head of the Tiller; so that we were obliged to steer her with the Main and Fore-sheets, by
<PB N="18" REF="007859_0050_102DDAA4441C2B78"/>easing off one, and hawling aft the other, as she came to, or fell off. In a short Time after, she struck, bilged, and grounded, be∣tween two small Islands, where Providence directed us to such a Place as we could save our Lives. When the Ship struck it was about Break of Day, and not above a Musket-shot from the Shore. Launch'd the Barge, Cutter, and Yaul over the Gunnel; cut the Main and Fore-Mast by the Board, and the Sheet-Anchor from the Gunnel. The Cap∣tain sent the Barge on Shore, with Mr. <HI>Snow</HI> the Mate, to see if the Place was inhabited, and to return aboard directly; but, without any regard to his Duty, or the Preservation of the Lives of the People, he staid ashore. The Barge not returning as expected, the Lieutenant was sent in the Yawl, with Orders to bring off the Barge. The Lieute∣nant tarried ashore, but sent off the Boat. As soon as the Boat came on Board, the Cap∣tain, being very iil, was persuaded by the Officers to go ashore: With the Captain went the Land Officers, Mate, and Mid∣shipmen; the Officers remaining on Board were the Master, Boatswain, Gunner, and Carpenter: The Boatswain, who was laid up a Month before the Loss of the Ship, became
<PB N="19" REF="007859_0051_102DDAA63229B490"/>of a sudden very vigorous and active. At Night it blow'd very hard at North, with a great tumbling Sea; we expected every Mo∣ment that the Ship would part, fetching such Jirks and Twistings as shock'd every Person aboard, who had the least Care for the Pre∣servation of Life; yet, in the dismal Situa∣tion we were in, we had several in the Ship so thoughtless of their Danger, so stupid, and insensible of their Misery, that upon the principal Officers leaving her, they fell into the most violent Outrage and Disorder: They began with broaching the Wine in the Laza∣retto; then to breaking open Cabbins and Chests, arming themselves with Swords and Pistols, threatning to murder those who should oppose or question them: Being drunk and mad with Liquor, they plunder'd Chests and Cabbins for Money and other Things of Va∣lue, cloathed themselves in the richest Appa∣rel they could find, and imagined themselves Lords, Paramount.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 15th the Ship was bilged in the Mid-ships on a great rock; we took Care to secure some Powder, Ball, and a little Bread. In the Afternoon, the Carpenter and myself went ashore with several of those imaginary Lords in the rich Attire they had
<PB N="20" REF="007859_0052_102DC6FA5369CD88"/>plunder'd Yesterday; but upon the Purser and Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> of Marines present∣ing Pistols to some of their Breasts, those Grandees suffer'd themselves very quietly to be disrob'd of all their Greatness, and in a few Minutes look'd like a Parcel of tran∣sported Felons. On our coming ashore, we found the Captain had taken his Lodging in a little Hut, suppos'd to be built by <HI>Indians;</HI> as for our Parts, we were forced to take Shelter under a great Tree, where we made a large Fire; but it rain'd so hard, that it had almost cost us our Lives; an Invalid died that very Night on the Spot. Before I left the Ship I went to my Cabbin for my Jour∣nal, but could not find it; I believe it is de∣stroy'd with the rest, for there is not one Journal to be produced; we have good rea∣son to apprehend there was a Person employ'd to destroy them; I afterwards found Part of the Master's Journal along shore, tore to Pieces: Whatever is related in this Book, preceeding the Loss of the <HI>Wager,</HI> is extracted from a Journal belonging to a Gentleman lately an Officer on Board the <HI>Pearl.</HI> After we lost sight of the <HI>Pearl,</HI> I was oblig'd to have recourse to my Memory, which I be∣lieve has been very faithful to me. From
<PB N="21" REF="007859_0053_102DDAA7EC2E8818"/>the Time we were Ship-wreck'd, the Car∣penter and myself were exceeding careful in writing each Days Transactions: Had other Persons taken the same Care, there would be no Necessity of imposing upon the Publick a partial and inconsistent Narrative, instead of a faithful relation of Facts.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the Weather very boisterous, and a great Sea, the Boatswain wanted a Boat; but finding no Appearance of any coming aboard, brought a Quarter-deck Gun, a four Pounder, to bear on the Captain's Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and fir'd two Shot, which went just over the Captain's Tent. This Day, being resolv'd to contrive something like a House, to secure us from the Inclemency of the rain, and Severity of the Weather, we hawl'd up the Cutter, and propping her up, we made a tolerable Habitation. As for Food this Island produces none; nor is there any Vegetable upon it but Cellery, which grows here in abundance, and is of great Use to us, the Men being in general very much troubled with the Scurvy.</P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> being <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> got several wild Fowls, and plenty of Mus∣cles, Limpetts, and other Shell-fish, which we find very refreshing, having subsisted a long Time on nothing but Salt-provisions.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="007859_0054_102DDAAAD9163DC0"/>
The 18th went on Board the Ship, to see if it was possible to come to any Provisions; got out of the Lazaretto two Casks of Flouer and some Wine, which were very useful.</P>
<P>On the 19th went aboard again to scuttle the Decks, in order to get some Beef and Pork out of the Hold; we also scuttled the Carpenter's Store-room, for Nails and other Things of Service.</P>
<P>The 20th cut away the Gunnel, to get the Long Boat out; which was done. To-day we found several Men dead, and some drowned, in the Ship; suppos'd to have drank till they were not able to get from the Water, as it flowed into the Ship. While we were aboard working on the Wreck, there came a-long side a Canoe with several <HI>Indians,</HI> bowing and crossing themselves, giving us to understand they were inclinable to the <HI>Romish</HI> religion; we gave 'em out of the Ship two Bales of Cloth, and sent them ashore to the Captain; he gave them Hats, and presented each of them with a Soldier's Coat. They had Abun∣dance of the largest and best Muscles I ever saw, or tasted. This Day was the first Time of the Boatswain's coming ashore; the Cap∣tain called him rogue and Villain, and felled him to the Ground with his Cane, so that he
<PB N="23" REF="007859_0055_102DDAACE4477DA8"/>was motionless, and to Appearance dead; when he had recovered the Blow, and saw a cockt Pistol in the Captain's Hand, he offered his naked Breast; the Captain told him, he deserved to be shot, and said no more to him. The Captain, Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> of Marines, the Surgeon, and Purser, always appear'd in Arms on the Beach, on the coming ashore of every Boat, in order to prevent the People bring∣ing any Thing from the Ship in a clandestine Manner; they were so cautious of any Thing being imbezzled, that they would not suffer the Boats to go off and work by Night, not∣withstanding the Moon, Tides, and Fairness of Weather were more favourable to us by Night than Day; by this we omitted several Opportunities of getting out Provisions, and other useful Things, which we shall shortly stand in great Need of.</P>
<P>The 21st, continued to scuttle between Decks; in getting Necessaries out of the Ship, found several Men dead.</P>
<P>The 22d, the <HI>Indians</HI> brought us three Sheep, and some Muscles. They are a Peo∣ple of a small Stature, well shaped, of an Olive Complexion, with black Hair; in Be∣haviour very civil: they have little Cloaths, except about their Waists, notwithstanding
<PB N="24" REF="007859_0056_102DDAAEB632B1E0"/>the Climate is excessive cold. They stay'd all Night, it being very rainy Weather, and has been ever since we have been here, the Wind blowing from North to N. W.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 23d, the Wind from the E. N. E. to North, fell Abundance of Snow, in∣somuch that the Mountains are cover'd with it. It freezes very hard, and we find it ex∣treamly cold. The next Day, the same Wea∣ther, we went aboard, and scuttled for Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Forehold.</P>
<P>The 25th, little Wind at N. E. and frosty Weather, went aboard again, and got out of the Forehold eight Barrels of Flour, one Cask of Pease, with some Brandy and Wine. This Day went to Allowance, of half a Pound of Flour <HI>per</HI> Man, and one Piece of Pork for three Men, it being the first Time of serving since on Shore.</P>
<P>The 26th, we got out more Casks of Flour, one Cask of Oatmeal, with some Brandy and Wine. In the Evening the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> came with their Wives, we gave the Wo∣men Hats, and the Men Breeches; they made Signs as if they would bring more Sheep.</P>
<P>On the 27th, we scuttled over the Captain's Store-room, got out several Casks of rum and Wine, and brought them ashore. This
<PB N="25" REF="007859_0057_102DDAB0665F8C20"/>was the first Time of the Lieutenant's being between Decks since the Loss of the Ship. The following Day we went aboard, cut down and tost over-board the Ship's Awning, to make a Deck for the Long Boat.</P>
<P>Since the 27th, we have been employ'd in getting up the Long Boat, and repairing the Barge which had been stove ashore; rainy Weather.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the 3d of <HI>June,</HI> hard Gales <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wind at N. N. West, with Abundance of rain; deserted this Day <HI>James Mitchel,</HI> Car∣penter's Mate, <HI>John Russell,</HI> Armourer, <HI>Wil∣liam Oram,</HI> Carpenter's Crew, <HI>Joseph King, John Redwood,</HI> Boatswain's Yeoman, <HI>Dennis O'Lary, John Davis, James Roach, James Stewart,</HI> and <HI>William Thompson,</HI> Seamen. Took up, along Shore, one Hogshead of Bran∣dy, and several Things that drove out of the Ship, as Bales of Cloth, Hats, Shoes, and other Necessaries. An Information was given, this Day, by <HI>David Buckley,</HI> to the Captain, that there was a Design to blow him up, with the Surgeon, and Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> of Marines. The Train was actually found, laid by the Deserters, to blow 'em up the Night before they went off.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007859_0058_102DDAB253D85E38"/>
<HI>Thursday</HI> the 4th, we finished the Boats, and shot several wild Geese. Finding Mur∣murings and Discontents among the People, we secured the Oars, and hawled up the Boats, being apprehensive they would go a∣way with them by Night.</P>
<P>The 5th, we went on Board the Ship, found several Casks of Wine and Brandy be∣tween Decks, most Part of the Planks be∣tween Decks gone, and some Strakes to Wind∣ward started out, Part of the upper Deck blown up, the Stumps of the Masts and Pumps risen five Feet; brought ashore the Cask of Flour, with some Stuff for the Use of the Long Boat; and two Quarter Casks of Wine; the Wind at S. by E.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 6th, the Wind at South and fair Weather, we went aboard, got out of the Hold eight Casks of Flour, two Casks of Wine, a Quarter Cask and three Hogsheads of Brandy. The Lieutenant went to the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> but could not find 'em, being inform'd by the Deserters that they were gone.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the 7th, we went aboard the Ship, got out a Cask of Pork, two Barrels of Flour, started one Pipe of Wine, and brought it ashore, with a Quarter Cask of Pease, some Bales of Cloth, and Carpenter's Stores. This
<PB N="27" REF="007859_0059_102DDAB49848C048"/>Day Mr. <HI>Henry Cozens,</HI> Midshipman, was con∣fin'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Captain; the Fault alledg'd a∣gainst him was Drunkenness. We learn from <HI>Nicholas Griselham,</HI> Seaman, who was present and near the Captain all the Time, that as Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was rowling up a sleep Beach, a Cask of Pease, he found it too heavy for him, and left off rowling; the Captain seeing this, told him, he was drunk, Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> reply'd, With what should I get drunk, unless it be with Water? The Captain then said, You Scoundrel, get more Hands, and rowl the Cask up: <HI>Cozens</HI> called for more Hands, but no People came; with that the Captain struck him with his Cane. <HI>Griselham</HI> likewise says, that <HI>Cozens</HI> talked to the Captain about one Capt. <HI>Shelvock;</HI> but the Words he does not remem∣ber. But the same Night I heard Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> use very unbecoming Language to the Cap∣tain, telling him, That he was come into those Seas to pay <HI>Shelvock</HI>'s Debts; and also insolently added, Tho' <HI>Shelvock</HI> was a rogue, he was not a Fool; and, by G—d, you are both. When he spoke this, he was a Prisoner in the Store Tent, and asked the Captain, If he was to be kept there all Night? On these Provocations, the Captain attempted to strike him again; but the Centinel said,
<PB N="28" REF="007859_0060_102DDAB634CF68C0"/>he should strike no Prisoner of his. But <HI>Co∣zens</HI> endeavouring to stave a Cask of Brandy, was soon after released. This Day got out of the Ship several Chests of Wax Candles of all Sizes, Bales of Cloth, Bales of Stockings, Shoes, with some Clocks, and mercantile Ware, with which this Ship was throng'd.</P>
<P>The 8th, Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and myself went to the Deserters; we find they are determined to go off to the Northward; the reason of their Stay is the Want of Craft to go off in. They now find themselves mistaken, they believed at first they were on the Main, but are convinced they are four or five Leagues from it, therefore they purpose to build a Punt out of the Wreck of the Ship: They live on Sea Weed and Shell Fish; got up one Cask of Beef, which was brought on Shore with a Cask of Brandy, found one Cask of Beef on the rocks.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 9th, I went with the Doc∣tor's Mate to the Deserters, and spoke to <HI>William Oram,</HI> a Carpenter, and a very useful Man, desiring him to return, with a Promise of Pardon from the Captain: In this Affair I was obliged to Act very secretly. To-day, Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> the Midshipman, had a Dis∣pute with the Surgeon; the latter having
<PB N="29" REF="007859_0061_102DDAB7D69B5698"/>some Business in our Tent, which when he had done, on his going away, Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> followed him; they soon fell to Blows, but the Surgeon had so much the Advantage of the Midshipman, that he tied his Hands be∣hind him and left him. In the Evening the Captain sent for me and the Carpenter to his Tent: We found with the Captain, the Lieu∣tenant, Purser, Surgeon, and Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> of Marines. Here we had a Con∣sultation, which was chiefly concerning the Disturbances among the People, as well in our Tent as in the rest. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and I assu∣red the Captain, that the People in our Tent were generally very well affected to him, and that we never would engage in any Mutiny against him, or any other Officer that would act for the publick Good, and his Ma∣jesty's Service: The Captain said, he had no reason to suspect us, for we were the only two in the Ship, that he put any Trust or Confidence in; strict Orders were given the Centinel to keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye on the Provisions; notwith∣standing all this Precaution and Care, there was one third Part of a Barrel of Flour, and half a Barrel of Gunpowder taken away that Night. It is to be observed, that this
<PB N="30" REF="007859_0062_102DDAB9C93D8E08"/>Day's Consultation was the first that Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> ever had with his Officers; had he sometimes consulted them aboard, we might probably have escaped our present unhappy Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 10th, This Day, serving the Provisions, the Boatswain's Servant, a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Boy, talking bad <HI>English,</HI> and bringing in the Allowance of Wine, the Boatswain, Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> Midshipman, and the Cook his Mess-mates, with some Difficulty, understood by the Boy's Talk, that one of the Men had his Allowance stopped; Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> went to know the reason; the Purser and he having some Dispute two or three Days before, the Purser told him, when he asked for his Wine, that he was come to Mutiny, and, without any further Ceremony, dischar∣ged a Pistol at his Head, and would have shot him, had he not been prevented by the Cooper's canting the Pistol with his Elbow, at the Instant of its going off; the Captain, and Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton,</HI> hearing the Dis∣charge of the Pistol, the latter ran out with a Firelock, then called the Captain out of his Tent, telling him that <HI>Cozens</HI> was come to Mutiny; the Captain on this jumped out, ask∣ing where the Villain was, clapped a cock'd
<PB N="31" REF="007859_0063_102DDABC1A5685F0"/>Pistol to Mr, <HI>Cozens</HI>'s Cheek, and precipi∣tately shot him, without asking any Questions; the Noise of the two Pistols going off, reached our Tent; it was rainy Weather, and not fit for Gunning, so that we could not imagine the Meaning of it; soon after we heard Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was shot by the Captain: The Lieu∣tenant came to call all Hands to the Captain; I asked if we must go armed; the Lieute∣nant answered, yes; but, on Consideration, I thought better to go without Arms: When we came to the Captain, he acquainted us with what he had done, and told us he was still our Commander. The Captain, Purser, Surgeon, Lieutenants <HI>Hamilton, Ewers,</HI> and <HI>Fielding</HI> of Marines being all armed, I said to the Captain, Sir, you see we are dis∣armed; on this the Captain dropped his Firelock to the Ground, saying, I see you are, and have only sent for you, to let you all know I am still your Commander, so let eve∣ry Man go to his Tent; accordingly every Man obey'd him. In our Tent we had eigh∣teen of the stoutest Fellows that belonged to the Ship; and I believe the Captain, and the Gentlemen above-mentioned, have some Sus∣picion of Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and myself, believing we can sway most of the Seamen on Shore:
<PB N="32" REF="007859_0064_102DDABDB4989598"/>But I think this Day we have given a Proof of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and our Detestation of Mutiny, by not appearing in Arms at the report of Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> being shot; we walked up with the Captain, where we saw Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> with his Elbow on the Ground resting his right Cheek on the Palm of his Hand, alive, and to Appearance sensible, but speechless; the Captain ordered him to the sick Tent, the Surgeon's Mate dressed his left Cheek where he was shot, and felt a Ball about three Inches under his right Eye; the Surgeon refused dressing him; this we may impute to his having lately a Quarrel with Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> which has been already mentioned. The shooting of Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was a very unhappy Affair: the Person whose Al∣lowance was stopped, made no Complaint to him, he was too officious in the Business, and his preceeding Behaviour, and notorious disrespectful Words to the Captain, might probably make the Captain suspect his De∣sign was Mutiny; tho' this we must aver, that Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> neither on this, or any other Oc∣casion, appeared in Arms since the Loss of the Ship: However, his Fate laid the Foundation of a great deal of Mischief which afterwards followed.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="007859_0065_102DDABFE9C93078"/>
<HI>Thursday</HI> the 11th, moderate Gales at W. N. W. The Carpenter employed in laying the Blocks for the Long-Boat. Dr. <HI>Oakly,</HI> of the Land Forces, was desired to assist the Sur∣geon's Mate, to take the Ball out of Mr. <HI>Co∣zens</HI>'s Cheek, which he then was inclinable to do; but in the Afternoon finding it not a∣greeable to the Captain, refused to go, as we are informed by the Surgeon's Mate, who desired some Surgeon might be present, to be Witness of the Operation; the Ball was taken out, and for some time supposed to be lost, but was afterwards found.</P>
<P>This Day being the 12th, the Carpenter finished the Blocks for lengthening the Long-Boat; in the Morning he went to the Cap∣tain's Tent for some Bolts for the Use of the Long-Boat, where he saw the Surgeon at the Medicine-Chest, who asked him how that unfortunate Creature did, meaning Mr. <HI>Co∣zens;</HI> the Carpenter told him he had not seen him To-day: The Surgeon then said he would have visited him, but the Captain would not give him Leave. This was looked on as an Act of Inhumanity in the Captain, and con∣tributed very much to his losing the Affec∣tions of the People, whose Opinion was, that as Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was very strong and heal∣thy,
<PB N="34" REF="007859_0066_102DDAC239A44190"/>with proper Assistance, he might reco∣ver; the People did not scruple to say that the Captain would act a more honourable Part to discharge another Pistol at him, and dispatch him at once, than to deny him relief, and suffer him to languish in a cold wet Place in Pain and Misery.</P>
<P>On the 13th, Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> being, to all out∣ward Appearance, likely to recover, desired he might be removed to our Tent, which was his Place of residence before this un∣happy Accident: We being unwilling to dis∣oblige the Captain, the Carpenter and my∣self waited on him; we told him, we were come to ask a Favour, hoping that he would have so much Mercy and Compassion on the unhappy Man who was in the sick Tent, as to permit us to remove him to his former Lodging; but the Captain answer'd, No; I am so far from it, that, if he lives, I will carry him a Prisoner to the Commodore, and hang him.</P>
<P>On the 14th, went aboard the Ship, but could do nothing, she working so very much; we brought ashore the Fore-top-sail Yard; the Boat went up the river, brought back Abundance of Geese and Shaggs. Wind at West.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="007859_0067_102DDAC425069F58"/>
<HI>Monday</HI> the 15th, hard Gales of Wind at West, with rain and Hail; drove ashore three Barrels of Flour; and abundance of small Stuff out of the Ship; took up a-long Shore several Pieces of Pork and Beef; <HI>John An∣derson,</HI> a Seaman, walking round the rocks, and reaching after a Piece of Beef, slipping his Footing, was drown'd, but taken up di∣rectly, and that Night bury'd: Turn'd the Boatswain out of our Tent for breeding Quar∣rels; his turbulent Temper was so well known to the Captain, that he express'd himself pleas'd at our turning him out, and said he was surpriz'd we ever admitted him among us.</P>
<P>On the 17th, the Carpenter at Work on the Long Boat: The Surgeon's Mate this Day took out of Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI>'s Cheek a Ball much slatted, and a Piece of Bone, supposed to be Part of the Upper Jaw, which was desired by Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> to be deliver'd to me; I receiv'd it, with the first Ball mention'd to have been lost.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 18th, the Carpenter cut the Long-Boat in two, and lengthen'd her eleven Feet ten Inches and half by the Keel.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 21st, went aboard the Ship; but it being dangerous going about any
<PB N="36" REF="007859_0068_102DDAC64E788760"/>Thing, by reason of her working much, and a great Sea tumbling in, the Boats were employ'd in going about the rocks in Search of Subsistence.</P>
<P>The 22d, the Carpenter went with the Boat up the Bay to seek the <HI>Indians,</HI> but saw nothing of them; at Night the Boat re∣turn'd, the People having shot. Abundance of wild Fowl.</P>
<P>The 23d, the Lieutenant went with the Boat, and found the <HI>Indians</HI> just come from the Place where they catch Seal; their Ca∣noes were loaded with Seal, Sheep, and Oil.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 24th, departed this Life Mr. <HI>Henry Cozens,</HI> Midshipman, after lan∣guishing fourteen Days with the Wound he had receiv'd in his Cheek: We bury'd him in as decent a Manner as Time, Place, and Circumstances would allow. There have died sundry Ways since the Ship first struck, forty-five Men; seven have deserted from us, and still continue away; remain and now victual'd one hundred Men.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 25th, the Wind at W. N. W. and rainy Weather; saw the <HI>Indians</HI> coming towards us in their Canoes; but the Desert∣ers settling where they took their Habitation when first we saw 'em, by their rowing, we
<PB N="37" REF="007859_0069_102DDAC8447C4CD8"/>thought they were design'd to go there; and knowing the Deserters intended to take one of their Canoes to go over to the Main, we therefore launch'd the Yawl and went off to them; there were five Canoes of 'em, laden with Seal, Shell-fish, and four Sheep; they brought with 'em their Wives and Children, so that in all they were about fifty in Num∣ber; they hawl'd their Canoes up, and built four Wigwams, which they cover'd with the Bark of Trees and Seal-skins; we ima∣gin'd by this they had an Intention to settle with us; they are a very simple and inoffen∣sive People, of a low Stature, flat nos'd, with their Eyes sunk very deep in their Heads; they live continually in Smoak, and are never without a Fire, even in their Canoes; they have nothing to cover their Nakedness, but a Piece of an old Blanket, which they throw over their Shoulders: We always see 'em in this Manner, notwithstanding we cloath 'em whenever they come to us. By the Crosses set up in many Parts of the Land, one would think they had some Notion of the <HI>Romish</HI> religion: We can't make 'em understand us by any Speech, nor by our Signs; we show'd 'em a looking Glass; when they saw the re∣presentation of themselves, they seem'd a∣maz'd,
<PB N="38" REF="007859_0070_102DDACA568916B8"/>and show'd a thousand antick Ges∣tures; and when once they beheld themselves in the Looking-Glass, they could hardly be prevail'd on to look off.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the 28th, in the Afternoon, about twelve of the <HI>Indian</HI> Women went off in their Canoes: We thought they were gone to get Muscles, but soon saw 'em diving; which we imagin'd was for Pieces of Beef or Pork that came out of the Wreck; but when they came ashore, we found they had been only diving for Sea-Eggs. The Women among those People seem to take more Pains for the Provisions of Life than the Men; the latter having little to do but to provide Wood, and indulge themselves by the Fire, while the Women go every Tide a Fishing. To-day we kill'd two <HI>Indian</HI> Sheep.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 29th, launch'd the Yawl to go with the <HI>Indians</HI> to shew us where they get the Muscles; but being too late for the Tide, we came away without any: The Captain sent to our Tent two Quarters of Mutton; the Carpenter daily at Work on the Long-Boat. Winds variable.</P>
<P>On the 30th, the <HI>Indian</HI> Women went again for Sea Eggs, and brought a great Quantity, with Abundance of white Mag∣gots
<PB N="39" REF="007859_0071_102DDACC949AB050"/>about three Quarters of an Inch in Length, and in Circumference the Bigness of a Wheat-straw. These Women keep an in∣credible Time under Water, with a small Basket in their Hands, about the Size of the Womens Work-baskets in <HI>England,</HI> into which they put whatever they get in their diving. Among these People the Order of Nature seems inverted; the Males are ex∣empted from Hardships and Labour, and the Women are meer Slaves and Drudges. This Day one of our Seamen died: We observe, the <HI>Indians</HI> are very watchful of the Dead, sitting continually near the above mention'd Corpse, and carefully covering him; every Moment looking on the Face of the Deceas'd with abundance of Gravity: At the Burial their Deportment was grave and solemn; seeing the People with their Hats off during the Service, they were very attentive and observant, and continued so till the Burial was over: They have nothing, as I have said before, but a Blanket to cover 'em, and the Boys and Girls are quite naked, notwith∣standing we felt it as cold here, as in the hardest Frosts in <HI>England,</HI> and almost always rainy.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="007859_0072_102DDACE2F50DE88"/>
<HI>Wednesday, July</HI> the 1st, employ'd in cut∣ting Timbers in the Woods for the Long-Boat; rainy Weather: the Wind at S. W. the <HI>Indian</HI> Women diving for Food as be∣fore.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 2d, last Night the Store-Tent was broke open, and robbed of a great deal of Flour.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 6th, hard Gales of Wind, with Showers of rain and Hail; came ashore from the Ship, one Cask of Beef, with seve∣ral of the Lower Deck Carlings, and Plank of the Upper and Lower Deck Beams; and, what was reckon'd very odd, the Cabbin-Bell came ashore, without its being fasten'd to any Wood, or any one Thing of the Ship near it.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 7th, hard Gales of Wind, with Hail, rain, and Lightning: The <HI>Indian</HI> Wo∣men went out as usual in their Canoes to dive for Sea Eggs, and brought ashore Abun∣dance of 'em; they jump over-board out of their Canoe about a Mile from Shore; they take the Handle of their Baskets, which I have already described, between their Teeth, and dive in five or six Fathom Water; their Agility in Diving, and their Continuance under Water, for so long a Time as they
<PB N="41" REF="007859_0073_102DDAD054DAAB38"/>generally do, will be thought impossible by Persons who have not been Eye-witnesses of it; they seem as amphibious to us as Seals and Allegators, and rarely make use of any Provision but what they get out of the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 8th, launch'd the Yawl and went on Board; saw several Casks, some of Meat, and some of Liquor; the Decks and Sides abaft drove out, and entirely gone; the Larboard Side abaft drove on shore; about two Miles and a half from the Tent a Cask of Liquor was found, and broach'd by the Person who found it, which was allow'd to be a great Fault; he likewise broach'd a Cask of Meat, which should have been pre∣serv'd to carry away with us.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> the 9th, the <HI>Indians</HI> with their Wives and Children launch'd their Canoes, and went away; 'tis believ'd they wanted Provisions, such as Seal; they are indeed never settled long in a Place; it was said some of our People wanted to have to do with their Wives, which was the reason of their going away so soon. To-day we saw several Things drive out of the Ship up the <HI>Lagoon,</HI> as the Stump of the Main-mast, one of the Pumps, with one of the Gun-Carri∣ages. Wind at N. W.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="007859_0074_102DDAD30CEB4428"/>
<HI>Friday</HI> the 10th, went aboard the Ship, sound her broke asunder just at the Gang-Way; saw the Cables out to the Windward, but could not see any Casks of Liquor or Provisions; went to shorter Allowance of Flour, one Pound for three Men <HI>per Diem.</HI> Last Night the Tent was robbed of half a Barrel of Flour: Orders were given by the Captain to watch the Store-Tent by Night; all the Officers, the Marine included, with the Mates and Midshipmen, were oblig'd to watch, the Captain and Carpenter alone ex∣cus'd, the Carpenter being every Day at work on the Long-Boat.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 17th, for this Week past hard Gales of Wind, with rain and Hail as usual. Last <HI>Wednesday</HI> the Ship parted her Upper Works from the Lower Deck: Launch'd the Boat and went off to the Wreck, but could do nothing; went up the Bay; took a Quar∣ter Cask, about three Parts full of Wine; saw the <HI>Indian</HI> Dogs ashore but no People.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 18th, launched the Boat, sent her to the Wreck, and brought ashore one Cask of Beef; it is believed some Guns were heard from the Sea: The Watch reported they have heard them two Nights past. Great
<PB N="43" REF="007859_0075_102DDAD4A4CCF5A0"/>Disturbances among the People. Wind at E. N. E. and frosty Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 19th, launch'd the Boat, sent her to the Wreck, hook'd a Cask supposed to be Beef; but when towed ashore, we found it contained nothing but Hatchets; we took up along Shore, Abundance of Cheque Shirts in Dozens, also Caps, Bales of Cloth, and Pieces of Beef and Pork.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 22d. This Day began to build a House to dwell in, finding our Stay here, will be much longer than we at first expected.</P>
<P>The 23d, took up along Shore several Pieces of Beef and Pork, Shirts, Caps, Frocks, Trowsers, Pieces of Cloth, with other ser∣viceable Things, and Wax Candles of all Sizes.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 25th, hard Showers of rain and Hail; the Wind at North. Shot several Sea-Gulls, Geese, Hawks, and other Birds: The Carpenter had this Day given him by one of the People, a fine large rock-crab, it being the first of the Kind we ever saw here.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 26th, moderate Gales and va∣riable Winds, with rain and Hail: Most Part of our People eat a Weed that grows on
<PB N="44" REF="007859_0076_102DDAD64275E200"/>the rocks; it is a thin Weed of a dark green Colour, and called by the Seamen, <HI>Slaugh.</HI> It is surprising how the black Currant Trees, which are here in great Plenty, have budded within these three Days. Began thatching our new House with Bushes: To-day we caught a fine rock-fish; this is the first Fish we have seen alive since our being here. Ob∣serving our new Town, we find there are no less than eighteen Houses in it.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 27th, launched the Beat, went to the Wreck, but found nothing; close Wea∣ther, the Wind still at North; rais'd the Sheers for erecting a Tent over the Long-Boat to keep the Men from being expos'd to the con∣tinual rains. This Day we finished the Thatching of our new House.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 29th, Fresh Gales at N. W. with rain; sure no Men ever met with such Weather as we have in this Climate: To-day we walked in the Woods to take some notice of the Trees, which we find to be very much like our Beech in <HI>England;</HI> but the Trees and Bushes are in general of a soft free Na∣ture, and with a spicey Bark.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 30th, Wind still at N. W. and rainy Weather. This Day departed this Life <HI>Nathaniel Robinson,</HI> the last private Man
<PB N="45" REF="007859_0077_102DDAD931577070"/>of the Invalids; there are now only two left, <HI>viz.</HI> the Captain and Surgeon. Being at the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI>'s Tent, I found him looking in Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Voyage to these Seas; this Book I desired the Loan of he told me it was Captain <HI>Cheap</HI>'s, and did not doubt but he would lend it me; this, Favour I requested of the Captain, and it was presently granted. Carefully perusing this Book, I conceived an Opinion that our going through the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan</HI> for the Coast of <HI>Brazil,</HI> would be the only Way to prevent our throwing ourselves into the Hands of a cruel, barbarous, and insulting Enemy: Our Long-Boat, when finished, can be fit for no Enter prize, but the Preservation of Life: As we cannot act offensively, we ought to have regard to our Safety and Li∣berty. This Evening Proposals were offered to the Officers concerning our going through the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan;</HI> which at this Time they seem to approve of.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 31st, hard Gales at N. W. with rain: This Day was taken up along Shore an Otter just killed, but by what Ani∣mal we could not tell; it was bleeding fresh when taken up, and proved a dainty re∣past.
<PB N="46" REF="007859_0078_102DDADACF08ADB8"/>Came ashore the Ship's Beams, with several Things of great Value.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, August</HI> the 1st, hard Gales at N. W. with rain and Hail. This Day put to an Allowance of Flour, one Quarter of a Pound a Man <HI>per Diem,</HI> and one Pint of Wine; those who like Brandy, to have half a Pint in Lieu of Wine. We have now in a manner nothing to live on but what we pick up along the Shore: The Ship's Company agree to go through the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 2d, This Morning found the Store Tent robbed of Brandy; filled up all the ullago Casks; picked up about the rocks Abundance of Clams, a Shell-fish not unlike our Cockles: These Fish are at present the Support of our Life. The People are now very quarrelsome and discontented.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 3d, this Day having fine Wea∣ther (which is a Prodigy in the Place) launched the Boat, and went about the rocks and Islands on Discovery. This Day we also moved into our new House, it being a very commodious Habitation, exceeding well thatched; in this Dwelling there are Cabbins for fourteen People, which are covered inside and out with broad Cloath: This is a rich House, and, in some Parts of the World,
<PB N="47" REF="007859_0079_102DDADCB7646F68"/>would purchase a pretty Estate; there are se∣veral hundred Yards of Cloth about it, besides the Curtains and Linings, which are Shalloon and Camblet; in short, considering where we are, we cannot desire a better Habitation. The People fall into Disputes concerning the Boat, where we are to proceed with her, when she is built and ready for going off. It is the Opinion of the Navigators, that going through the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan</HI> is the safest and only Way to preserve Life and Liberty: The Artists, who have worked the Bearings and Distance, are very pressing that it should be moved to the Captain, purposing to have their reasons drawn up, and signed by all who are willing to go that Way, and to be delivered to the Captain for his Opinion: upon this there was a Paper drawn up, and as soon as the People heard it, they came flocking to sign first, crying all aloud for the <HI>Streights,</HI> seeming overjoyed, as if they were going to <HI>England</HI> directly, without any Af∣fliction or Trouble, but there must be a great deal of Hardship to be encountered before we arrive at our native Country: This Paper was signed by all the Officers on the Spot, except the Captain, Lieutenant, Purser, and Surgeon, and by all the Seamen in general, except the Captain's Steward.</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 5th, this Day I went with the Master, Carpenter, Master's Mate, and Midshipmen, to the Captain, to acquaint him with what was done, and resolv'd on; and farther told him, It was a Duty incumbent on us to preserve Life before any other Inte∣rest. He answer'd, Gentlemen, I desire Time to consider of it, and will give you my final Determination; on which we took our Leave, and came away.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 6th, hard Gales at W. S. W. and rainy Weather. At Noon went with Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, to have some farther Conference for our future Deliverance. While we were there, the Captain sent his Service to Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI> for a Pair of Pocket-Pistols, his own Pro∣perty, which had been refused him on his request some Time before. The Servant
<PB N="51" REF="007859_0083_102DDAE4AA122FF8"/>was answer'd by the Captain's Favourite, and Prime Minister, the Steward, The Captain is ill, and I can't let you have 'em. This answer not being satisfactory to Capt. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> he sent a second Time, and insisted on the Delivery of his Pistols; but was answer'd, they could not be come at before the Captain was up; but a little Time after it was judg'd proper to send Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> his Pis∣tols. From Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s we went to the Lieutenant's Tent; while there, the Lieutenant was sent for to Captain <HI>Cheap;</HI> about an Hour after the Carpenter and my∣self were sent for; when we came to him, he said, Gentlemen, I have maturely consi∣der'd the Contents of your Paper, so far as it regards the Preservation of the People on the Spot: This Paper has given me a great deal of Uneasiness, insomuch that I have not clos'd my Eyes till Eight o'Clock this Morn∣ing, for thinking of it; but, I think, you have not weigh'd the Thing rightly; do you know we are above one hundred and sixty Leagues distant S. W. from the <HI>Sreights</HI> of <HI>Ma∣gellan,</HI> with the Wind against us? Then think on the Distance to be run afterwards on the other Side the <HI>Streights,</HI> with the Wind always against us, and where no Water is to be
<PB N="52" REF="007859_0084_102DDAE7474E2DA0"/>had. I answer'd, Sir, you say it is above one hundred and sixty Leagues to the <HI>Streights;</HI> but let the Navigators work it, and they will find it not above ninety Leagues; yourself and Lieutenant are undoubtedly Navigators and Judges, therefore will certainly find it as I say. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> acquainted him, ac∣cording to his Calculation, the Vessel would carry a Month's Water at a Quart a Man <HI>per Diem;</HI> and, Sir, do you consider, after running a-long Shore to the Northward this Side the Land, that we have one hundred Leagues to run right out to Sea to the Island of <HI>Juan Ferdinandez;</HI> and five hundred Chances to one, if we meet the Commodore there, or any of the Squadron; nor do we know but the Commodore may have shared the same Fate with ourselves, or perhaps worse? The Captain answer'd, It's a thousand to one if we see the Commodore at <HI>Juan Ferdinan∣dez;</HI> for, Gentlemen, to let you into a Secret which I never discover'd before, we shall meet him at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> his Orders were from—to go there with the Squadron, it being a Place of little or no Force. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> answer'd, Sir, 'tis agreed, the Com∣modore is at <HI>Baldavia;</HI> but we make it in our Bargain, when we go from hence, that we
<PB N="53" REF="007859_0085_102DDAE8E4414FA0"/>wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> put ashore at every Place when we want Water, whenever the Weather will permit, without any Obstruction. The Captain re∣ply'd, There is no Occasion for that; we will water at the Islands, and take a Vessel going along. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> said, Sir, what shall we do with a Vessel, without Provisions, for ninety Souls? The Captain answer'd, We will take a Vessel loaden with Flour from <HI>Chili,</HI> there being a great many Trading Vessels that Way; and then we will proceed through the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cum∣mins</HI> said, How shall we take a Vessel with∣out Guns not having any but Muskets, and our Enemies know as well as ourselves, that we have a Squadron in these Seas, therefore undoubtedly are well arm'd, and keep a good Look-out. The Captain's Answer to this was, What are our small Arms for, but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> board 'em? The Carpenter said, Sir, if a Shot should take the Beat under Water, it would not be in my Power to stop a Leak of that kind, where the Plank is so thin, that in some Places it is not above three Quarters of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch thick. The Captain then said, Gentlemen, I am agreeable to any Thing, and willing to go any Way, for the Preserva∣tion of the People; but at the same Time
<PB N="54" REF="007859_0086_102DDAEB445A7C98"/>would have you consider of it, the Wind be∣ing always against us on the other Side the Land, and we have above seven hundred Leagues to the river <HI>Plate.</HI> I answer'd the Captain, 'Tis not above five hundred and nine∣ty Leagues from hence to Cape <HI>St. Antonio</HI>'s; and, as I have before said, let the Navigators work it, and reason take Place, which is what we chiefly desire to be govern'd by: Another Inducement we have to go the Way propos'd is, that we may be assur'd of Water and Provision. I allow that, says the Cap∣tain, and we may save our own; but how do you know whether we may not meet Enemies in the <HI>Streights?</HI> I reply'd to the Captain, We can have no Enemies to en∣counter there but <HI>Indians</HI> in their Canoes, and those we can master at our Pleasure. The Captain then seem'd to countenance our Opinion again, and said, When we come to <HI>St. Julian</HI>'s we shall be sure of Salt in Plenty for our Provisions, without which our Fowls will not keep above two or three Days: Besides, when we come to the river <HI>Plate,</HI> we may meet with a Prize, they not being acquainted with any <HI>English</HI> Vessel like ours, with Schooner Sails; by which Means we may run up the river, and take a larger
<PB N="55" REF="007859_0087_102DDAED8C6E8690"/>Vessel: If we fail here, we may go ashore, and get what Cattle we please; but what Business have we at the <HI>Rio Grand?</HI> We must go to the <HI>Rio Janeiro.</HI> I told him, we should be oblig'd to stop at every Place a-long Shore for Supplies; at <HI>St. Catharine</HI>'s the Go∣vernor will give us a Certificate, so that we shall be known to be the People that were there in the Squadron. The Captain said, That's true, and I can get Bills of Credit in any Part of <HI>Brazil;</HI> besides, the People may be separated, some in the <HI>Flota,</HI> and some in other Ships; with less Hands we may go to <HI>Barbados.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> told him, We might venture to <HI>England</HI> with twelve Hands. Yes, you may, says the Captain, with thirty. It is to be observ'd, during all this Debate, the Lieutenant spoke not a Word. The Carpen∣ter asking him the reason of his Silence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the Consulation he; answer'd, I'll give my Opinion hereafter. The Captain said, I knew nothing of his being acquainted with it, till Mr. <HI>Bulkeley</HI> told me Yesterday; but at the same Time, Mr. <HI>Beans,</HI> I expect you will be the first that will sign the Paper. I ima∣gin'd the Captain meant our Paper, and im∣mediately answer'd with some Warmth, As he had refus'd signing at first, and at the
<PB N="56" REF="007859_0088_102DDAEF6F5CD508"/>same Time agreed to the Proposal, that I had sign'd so close, that there was no room left for his Name, and now it was too late for him to sign. The Captain surpriz'd me, by say∣ing, I don't mean your Paper. I told him, Any other, which should be contrary to ours, would never be sign'd by us. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> said to the Captain, Sir, 'tis all owing to you that we are here; if you had consulted your Officers, we might have avoided this Misfor∣tune; considering the Condition the Ship was in, she was not fit to come in with the Land, all our Men being sick, and not above three Seamen in a Watch; suppose the Mast had gone by the Board, as was every Moment expected. The Captain made Answer, Gen∣tlemen, you do not know my Orders, there never were any so strict given to a Com∣mander before; and had I but two Men li∣ving besides myself, I must, and was obliged to go to the first rendezvous, which was the Island of <HI>Nostra Senhora di Socora:</HI> I was obliged to go there at all Events. I made Answer to this, Sir, if that is the Case, it seems plain, the Thing was design'd we should be here; But, Sir, I am of Opinion, notwith∣standing the Commodore had his Orders from —to go with the Squadron to <HI>Baldavia,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="007859_0089_102DDAF157F938E8"/>that at the same Time those Orders were so far discretional, that if the Squadron was dis∣abled, Care was to be taken not to endanger his Majesty's Ships. Yes, that (says the Cap∣tain) was settled at <HI>St. Julian</HI>'s: Notwith∣standing what has been said, Gentlemen, I am agreeable to take any Chance with you, and to go any Way; but would have you consider of it, and defer your Determination till all is ready to go off the Spot. I then told the Captain, You have known, Sir, from the Time you saw the Proposal, that the People are uneasy, and the Work is at a Stand, and in this Situation Things will be until this Affair is settled; therefore the sooner you resolve, the better. The Captain re∣ply'd, I design to have a Consultation among my Officers: Have you any more Objections to make? I answer'd, Yes, Sir, one more; which is, When you go from hence, you are not to weigh, come to an Anchor, or alter Course, without consulting your Officers. The Captain said, Gentlemen, I was your Commander till the Ship parted, or as long as any Stores or Provisions were getting out of her. We told him, we had always taken Care to obey his Orders in the strictest Man∣ner; which he allow'd us to have done; and
<PB N="58" REF="007859_0090_102DDAF43627E828"/>he added, You were the Officers that I placed my whole Dependence in. We answer'd, Sir, we will support you with our Lives, at long as you suffer reason to rule; and then we parted. After this Consultation the Cap∣tain seldom came out of his Tent, which oc∣casion'd great Disturbances among the People.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 7th, the Wind at W. N. W. with rain. This Day the Navigators work'd the Bearings and Distance along Shore, from one Place to another, to know the true Dis∣tance: Hereupon it was agreed to proceed through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> according to Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Directions, which give us great Encouragement to go that Way. Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> draw'd his Men up, and dismiss'd 'em again. Great Uneasiness among the People.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 8th, this Morning went to the Lieutenant, for him to acquaint the Cap∣tain all his Officers were ready to give suffi∣cient reasons for going through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> desiring a Consultation might be held in the Afternoon. At Three o'Clock the Captain sent for me and Mr. <HI>Cummins;</HI> when we came, the Master and Bortswain were sent for, but they were gone in Search of Subsistence, as Limpets, Muscles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="007859_0091_102DDAF5D2FB2950"/>The Captain said, Gentlemen, I don't doubt but you have consider'd upon the Business you are come about; therefore I am determin'd to take my Fate, with you, or where the Spirit of the People leads, and shall use my best Endeavours for their Preservation; but I am afraid of meeting contrary Winds, for after the Sun has cross'd the Line we must expect to meet 'em. I made Answer, By all Accounts, the Wind hangs from N. W. to the S. W. above three Parts of the Year; which is in our Favour. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> told him, There was fresh Water to be got as well on one Coast as the other; and if Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Treatment was so ill in a profound Peace, what must we expect in a Time of open War? The Captain said, I am afraid very bad. Then Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> spoke in this Manner to the Captain: Sir, I always took you for an honourable Gentle∣man, and I believe you to be such; on your Honour, Sir, I beg you will give the true Sentiments of your Mind, whether thro' the <HI>Streights</HI> is not the surest and safest Way to preserve our Lives, notwithstanding we have a Thousand Difficulties to encounter with any Way? The Captain answer'd, I really think going to the Northward is the
<PB N="60" REF="007859_0092_102DDAF76A118418"/>safest Way; for suppose we should be drove off to Sea, when on the other Side the Land, what is to be done then? I said, Sir, it is our Business to keep the Shore, to prevent all Accidents that may happen that Way. Then Lieutenant <HI>Beans</HI> made an Objection, Suppose you have the Wind blowing right in, and a tumbling Sea, so as to endanger the Boat, what are we to do? I made Answer, Sir, If you remember, when we were riding at <HI>St. Juli∣an</HI>'s, it blow'd a very hard Gale of Wind right in from the Sea, yet, even then, the Sea did not run so high as to endanger a Boat riding at Anchor: Another Instance I bring you from <HI>St. Catherine</HI>'s, when we had such hard Gales, that the <HI>Tryal</HI> lost her Masts, and the <HI>Pearl</HI> separated from the Squadron; yet, at that Time, there was no Sea compa∣rable to what we have met with this Side the Land. The Lieutenant allow'd this to be Fact. Then the Captain said, I will allow you to have Water at <HI>Port Desire;</HI> but do you consider the lengthening your Distance, by keeping along Shore, and rounding every Bay, and some of those Bays are very deep. I told him, That undoubtedly there was Wa∣ter all along the Coast, and that we had no Business to round the Bays, but to steer from
<PB N="61" REF="007859_0093_102DC6F66F8CD618"/>one Head-land to the other. Then Lieute∣nant <HI>Beans</HI> made a second Objection, Sup∣pose we are forced into a Bay, and Shoal-Water? I answer'd, We should always have a Boat a-head, and our Draught of Water will not be above four or five Feet at most; and if we should be so unfortunate as to lose our Boat, we must keep the Lead a going. The Lieutenant reply'd, That was true, and there could not be a great deal of Difficulty in it. This was the only Time the Lieutenant ever spoke in Publick on the Affair; he always allow'd, when absent from the Cap∣tain, that going through the <HI>Streights</HI> was the best Way; but in the Captain's Presence he sided with him, and was for going to the Northward.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 9th, at Three this Afternoon, I went with Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> the Master, and Boatswain, as desir'd, to the Captain, to give him our Opinions, believing, going thro' the <HI>Streights</HI> the surest Way to preserve Life: It was therefore agreed, That if the Wind did not set in against us, at the Sun's Crossing the Line, that the Captain would go that Way. The Captain ask'd every Man's Opi∣nion, and found the People unanimous for the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> To-day, being
<PB N="62" REF="007859_0094_102DDAFB9CBB5CA8"/>fair Weather, launch'd the Yawl to go a Fowling; shot several Geese, Ducks, Shaggs, and Sea-pies. Heel'd the Long-Boat for planking.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 10th, Wind at N. and N.N.W. rainy Weather. Eat Slaugh and Sea-weed fry'd with Tallow-Candles, which we pick'd up along Shore; this we reckon at present exceeding good Eating, having nothing to live on but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour a Man <HI>per</HI> Day, and what we can get off the rocks; for many Days the Weather has been so bad, that we have not been able to stir abroad, though almost starv'd for want of Food.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 11th, hard Gales at S. W. with heavy rains. This Afternoon the People came in Arms to acquaint us of the Stores being robbed; they therefore wanted our Consent for moving the Stores to our Tent; on which we desir'd they would desist from offering any Violence; we told 'em of the ill Consequence of Mutiny, which, as we al∣ways abhorr'd, we took all imaginable Care to prevent: The People, on our Persuasions, instantly quitted their Arms. The Captain presently sent for me and Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> to acquaint us with what had happen'd: He
<PB N="63" REF="007859_0095_102DDAFDDE34C5D8"/>told us, the Purser accidentally coming by, saw the Prisoner, <HI>Rowland Crusset,</HI> a Marine, crawling from the Bushes, and from under the Store-Tent, and found on him upwards of a Day's Flour for Ninety Souls, with one Piece of Beef under his Coat, and three Pieces more, which were conceal'd in the Bushes, to carry off when an Opportunity offer'd; and the Centry, <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> his Mess-mate, a Marine, undoubtedly was privy to the robbery. The Captain farther said, We have nothing to do with them; but I shall send to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> to insist on a Court-Martial: I really think, that for rob∣bing the Store-Tent (which, in our present Circumstances, is starving the whole Body of People) the Prisoners deserve Death. This was not only the Captain's Opinion, but in∣deed the Sentiments of every Person present. After we parted from the Captain, we were sent for by Capt. <HI>Pemberton:</HI> He acquainted us, he would go as far as the Martial Law would allow him, and in Conjunction with the Sea-Officers: I look (said he) on the Lieutenant as nothing, and the Captain in the same Light: As for you two (meaning the Gunner and Carpenter) I confide in, and shall have re∣gard to your Opinions. When the Articles
<PB N="64" REF="007859_0096_102DDB0088C21890"/>of War were read, we found their Crime did not touch Life, but that they were to suffer Corporal Punishment. Whilst Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> was laying open the Nature of their Guilt, and the ill Consequence of Lenity in the Cir∣cumstances we were in, I propos'd a Way, next to Death; which was, if judg'd proper by Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> and Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> to carry them off to an Island where the Ship parted, there being Muscles, Limpets, and Clams in Abundance, and no want of Water, and there to be left till we should be ready for sailing; and, to strike a Terror in all for the future, that if any Man should be guilty of the like Offence, without any respect of Person, he should share the same Fate. This Proposal was approved of by both the Cap∣tains. At Night Lieutenant <HI>Beans</HI> surpriz'd us with a new kind of Proposal we little dreamt of, which was, to have a proper Place of Devotion to perform Divine Ser∣vice in every Sabbath-Day: For this Sacred Office our Tent was judg'd the most commo∣dious Place. The Duty of publick Prayer had been entirely neglected on board, though every Seaman pays Four-pence per Month towards the Support of a Minister; yet De∣votion, in so solemn a Manner, is so rarely
<PB N="65" REF="007859_0097_102DDB0276818978"/>perform'd that I know but one Instance of it during the many Years I have belong'd to the Navy. We believe religion to have the least Share in this Proposal of the Lieute∣nant. If our Tent should be turn'd into a a House of Prayer, and this Project takes, we may, perhaps, in the Midst of our Devotion, be surpriz'd, and our Arms taken from us, in order to frustrate our Designs, and pre∣vent our return to <HI>England</HI> through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> or any other Way.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 12th, hard Gales from S.W. to W. with heavy Showers of Hail and rain. Serv'd out Provisions To-day, a Piece of Beef for four Men; some Time past we have had but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour per Man per Day, and three Pieces of Beef; we live chiefly on Mussles, Limpits, and Clams, with Saragraza and Thromba; one is a green broad Weed, common on the rocks in <HI>England;</HI> the other is a round Sea-Weed, so large, that a Man can scarce grasp it; it grows in the Sea, with broad Leaves; this last we boil, the Saragraza we fry in Tallow; in this Manner we support Life: Even those Shell-Fish and Weeds we get with great Difficulty; for the Wind, the rain, and Coldness of the Cli∣mate in this Season, are so extremely severe,
<PB N="66" REF="007859_0098_102DDB04703998A8"/>that a Man will pause some Time whether he shall stay in his Tent and starve, or go out in Quest of Food.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 14th, very hard Gales at W. and N. W. with Showers of rain and Hail, which beat with such Violence against a Man's Face, that he can hardly withstand it; however, one of our Mess-mates To-day shot three Gulls and a Hawk; which gave us a very elegant repast. This Day was held a Court-Martial on the Centry who was believ'd confederated with the Marine that robbed the Store-Tent: Sentence was pass'd on 'em to receive six hundred Lashes each: Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> not thinking the Punish∣ment adequate to the Crime, cut 'em short of their Allowance; so that they have now but half the Provisions they had before: The Day following the Offenders receiv'd Two Hundred Lashes each, as Part of their Punish∣ment. We hawl'd the Long-Boat higher up, for fear the Sea should wash the Blocks from under her. We have found out a new Way of managing the Slaugh; we fry it in thin Batter with Tallow, and use it as Bread.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 16th, Fresh Gales of Wind at S. W. with heavy Showers of Hail: The People generally complain of a Malady in
<PB N="67" REF="007859_0099_102DDB0664727D78"/>their Eyes; they are in great Pain, and can scarce see to walk about. The last Tide flowed nine Feet perpendicular; To-day we picked up Shell-Fish in Abundance, with Pieces of Beef and Pork. The Prisoners re∣ceived two Hundred Lashes more.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 18th, this Day the Carpenter, who has all along been indefatigable in working about the Long-Boat, saw one of the Seamen cutting up an Anchor Stock for Fire-Wood, which had been designed for a particular Use for the Boat; at Sight of the Fellow's Folly be could not contain himself: This Affair, added to the little Concern and intollerable Indifference that appeared in the Generality of the People, for some Time impaired his Understanding, and made him delirious; all possible Methods are used to restore him, as he is the only Man, who, through the Assist∣ance of Providence, can compleat the Means of our Deliverance.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 19th, The Carpenter was so much recovered, that he went to work as usual; at Night, the Lieutenant acquainted us, that the Captain desired to speak with the Carpenter and me To-morrow at Noon, to consult what should be done with the Two Prisoners, having received but Four Hundrrd
<PB N="68" REF="007859_0100_102DDBB8A524AAC0"/>Lashes out of the Six, to which they were sentenced by a Court-Martial, the other Two Hundred being remitted by their own Offi∣cers.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 20th, We waited on the Captain, who acquainted us with what the Lieutenant had mentioned last Night relating to the Prisoners: We told him the People were very uneasy about this Mitigation of the Punishment inflicted on them by a Court Martial; therefore it was agreed they should provide for themselves as well as they could; but to have no Sort of Provisions out of the Store-Tent for the future.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 22d, we begun upon several Contrivances to get Provisions, such as build∣ing Punts, Cask-Boats, Leather-Boats, and the like.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the 23d, The Store-Tent was again robbed, and, on Examination, was found a Deficiency of Twelve Days Brandy for Ninety Men: The Lieutenant, myself, and Carpenter went to the Captain to consult some Way which might effectually prevent those villainous Practices for the future; the Captain desired us to make a nice Enquiry into this robbery, being determined to in∣flict the severest Punishment on the Offen∣ders;
<PB N="69" REF="007859_0101_102DDB08AA01EBE8"/>tho' it would give him the greatest Concern if any innocent Person should suffer. This Day we confined one of the Centinels for being drunk on his Post; the Day follow∣ing the Boatswain gave us Information of the Persons who had robbed the Tent; they were two Centinels, <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Butler;</HI> those very Persons were the first who insisted, that the Seamen, as well as themselves, should watch the Store-Tent; their own Officers, as ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, have brought them to no Examination: We have also Information that the Purser holds frequent Conversation with the rebels, contrary to all the Laws of the Navy, sup∣plying them with Liquors in Abundance, to the great Distress of his Majesty's faithful Subjects, who have but Half a Pint per Day to subsist on. There are now great Distur∣bances among the People concerning going to the Northward; they believe Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> never intended to return to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> by his proposing this Way, in Opposition to the Opinion of all the Navigators, who have given reasons for going thro' the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> There is a Sort of Party-rage among the People, fomented by a kind of Bribery that has more Influence on the Seamen than Money; there are some daily
<PB N="70" REF="007859_0102_102DDB0B90948D78"/>bought off by rum and other strong Liquors. Unless a Stop is put to these Proceedings, we shall never go off the Spot.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 25th, This Day felt Four great Earthquakes, three of which were very ter∣rible; notwithstanding these violent Shocks and Tremblings of the Earth, we find no Ground shifted. Hard Gales of Wind at the North, with heavy Showers of rain.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 27th, The Disturbances in∣crease among the People; we plainly see there is a Party raised to go to the North∣ward; we went to the Lieutenant, and con∣sulted with him what was to be done in the present Exigence; myself being reckoned the Projector of the Scheme for going through the <HI>Streights</HI> was threatened to be shot by <HI>Noble</HI> the Quarter-Master; After having some Dis∣course with the Lieutenant, he told me, If I would draw up a Paper for the Captain to sign, in order to satisfy the People, that he would go the Southward, and every Of∣ficer to have a Copy of it to justify himself in <HI>England,</HI> it would be as proper a Method as we could take. The Paper was immediately drawn up in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="007859_0103_102DDB0DE1FCED80"/>
WHEREAS upon a General Consul∣tation, it has been agreed to go from this Place through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> for the Coast of <HI>Brazil,</HI> in our Way for <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> We do, notwithstanding, find the People separating into Parties, which must consequently end in the Destruction of the whole Body; and as also there have been great robberies committed on the Stores, and every Thing is now at a Stand; therefore, to prevent all future Frauds and Animosities, we are unanimously agreed to proceed as a∣bove-mentioned.</P>
<P>This Paper was delivered to the Lieutenant, who said that he was sure the Captain would sign it; but in case of refusal, he should be confin'd for shooting Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> and he would take the Command on himself: And, to prevent further Disturbances, the Purser, as he much conversed with the rebels, it is agreed by the Body of Officers, to send him off the Island, for acting so contrary to his Duty, in Contempt of the Articles of War, the Laws of his Country, and the known rules of the Navy. It was likewise agreed, that any Person who engaged himself in
<PB N="72" REF="007859_0104_102DDB0FD9F4AB28"/>raising Parties, should be disarm'd. By this Day's Proceedings, we thought the Lieute∣nant a Gentleman of resolution; but the Words and Actions of People do not always concur.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 28th, To-day the Officers and People all appear'd in Arms. The Master, Boatswain, Gunner, and Carpenter, with Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mate, and Mr. <HI>Cambell,</HI> Mid∣shipman, went into the Captain's Tent, the Lieutenant being with him. As soon as the Officers were seated, a Consultation was held concerning <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Butler</HI>'s robbing the Store-Tent; they were sentenced to be tran∣sported to the Main, or some Island. As soon as this Affair was over, we talk'd to the Captain of the Uneasiness among the People; that there had been a long Time a visible In∣quietude among 'em, and that we could not help seeing there were Schemes form'd to ob∣struct our Design in going to the Southward. The Captain answer'd, Gentlemen, it is Time enough to think of this when we are ready to go off: Have not I told you before, that I do not care which Way I go, Southward or Northward? I will take my Fate with you. Every Body now expected the Lieutenant to reply, especially after the Zeal he express'd
<PB N="73" REF="007859_0105_102DDB121C0FC6E0"/>himself with the Day before; but he sat speechless, without any regard to the Wel∣fare of the People, or to his own Proposals. Finding he did not move in the Affair, I took out the Paper which was agreed to by the Lieutenant and the rest of the Officers, and read it to the Captain, and ask'd him to sign it; which he strenuously oppos'd and seem'd very much enrag'd that it should be propos'd to him. Upon this we dropt the Matter, and began to discourse concerning the Provi∣sions: We thought it necessary, that ten Weeks Subsistence should be secur'd to carry with us, and that the Liquor should be buried under Ground; but he gave us no Answer. Finding no relief here, we went to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, to consult with him what we should do in the present Exigence. On our coming out from the Captain, we saw a Flag hoisted on Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, the Captain himself seated in a Chair, surrounded by the People. On seeing this, all the Officers present at the Consultation, except the Lieu∣tenant, went over to Captain <HI>Pemberton.</HI> Here it was agreed, in Case the Captain persisted to refuse signing the Paper, to take the Com∣mand from him, and to give it the Lieutenant, according to the Lieutenant's own Proposal.
<PB N="74" REF="007859_0106_102DDB13B5DAE938"/>At the same Time Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> told the People, he would stand by 'em with his Life, in going through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> the Way propos'd in the Paper. The People gave three Cheers, crying aloud for <HI>England.</HI> The Captain hearing the Noise, got out of Bed to his Tent Door, and call'd the People, enquiring what they wanted; then sent for all the Officers: He was then told, since he refus'd signing the Paper, and had no regard to the Safety of our Provisions, the People unanimously agreed to take the Command from him, and transfer it to the Lieutenant. Hearing this, with an exalted Voice, Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> says, Who is he that will take the Command from me? Addressing himself to the Lieutenant, Is it you, Sir? The Lieute∣nant reply'd, No, Sir. The Terror of the Captain's Aspect intimidated the Lieutenant to that Degree, that he look'd like a Ghost. We left him with the Captain, and return'd to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, to acquaint him of the Lieutenant's refusing the Command. We had not been long here before Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> sent for us. I was the first Person call'd for; at my entering his Tent, I saw him seated on a Chest, with a cock'd Pistol on his right Thigh; observing this, I desir'd
<PB N="75" REF="007859_0107_102DDB15F7E02F18"/>Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was the Mate he always re∣ly'd on for Navigation, to tell the Captain I did not think proper to come before a cock'd Pistol: Notwithstanding I was arm'd, I drew back, altho' I had my Pistol cock'd, and there were several Men near me arm'd with Mus∣kets. The Captain's personal Bravery no Man doubted of; his Courage was excessive, and made him rash and desperate; his shoot∣ing Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was a fatal Proof of it; he was grown more desperate by this unhappy Action, and was observ'd since seldom to be∣have himself with any Composure of Mind. It is a Piece of human Prudence to retreat from a Man in a Phrenzy, because he who does not value his own Life, has another Man's in his Power. I had no Desire of fall∣ing by the Hand of Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> and should be greatly disturb'd to be compell'd, for my own Preservation, to discharge a Pistol at a Gentleman against whom I never had any Spleen, and who was my Command∣er. When Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> acquainted him with what I desired him, the Captain threw his Pistol aside, and came out of his Tent; he told the People, he would go with them to the Southward; he desired to know their Grievances, and he would redress them: They
<PB N="76" REF="007859_0108_102DDB183B1ADFE8"/>all call'd out for their Sea-Store of Provisions to be secur'd, and the rest equally divided. Here the Captain show'd all the Conduct and Courage imaginable; he was a single Man against a Multitude, all of 'em dissatisfy'd with him, and all of 'em in Arms: He told 'em the ill Consequence of sharing the Provi∣sions, that it was living To-day and starving To-morrow; but the People were not to be satisfy'd, the Officers had now no Authority over 'em, and they were some Time deaf to their Persuasions; nay, it was with Difficulty that they could dissuade 'em from pulling down the Store-Tent, and taking away the Provisions by Force; they remov'd the Pro∣visions out of the Store-Tent, then fell to digging a Hole to bury the Brandy; the Sea-Store to be secur'd, the remainder to be im∣mediately shar'd. Had this been comply'd with, the Consequences might have been very terrible: However, to pacify 'em in some Shape, it was agreed, that every Man should have a Pint of Brandy <HI>per</HI> Day, which, by Calculation, would last 'em three Weeks. On this they seem'd very easy, and went to their respective Tents. The Captain told his Officers, that he would act nothing contrary to what was agreed on for the Welfare and
<PB N="77" REF="007859_0109_102DDB19DE90A560"/>Safety of the Community. Finding the Cap∣tain in a Temper of Mind to hearken to reason, I said to him, Sir, I think it my Duty to inform you, that I am not the Per∣son whom you imagine to be the Principal in this Affair. The Captain answer'd, How can I think otherwise? I reply'd, Sir, the Paper I read to you was your Lieutenant's Projec∣tion: There sits the Gentleman, let him dis∣own it, if he can. The Captain turning him∣self to the Lieutenant, says, Mr. <HI>Bulkeley</HI> has honestly clear'd himself. We then drank a Glass of Wine, and took our Leaves. At Night the Captain sent for Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and me to sup with him; we were the only Offi∣cers present with him: When I was seated, I said, Sir, I have my Character at Stake, for drawing back from your cock'd Pistol: Had I advanc'd, one of us must have dropt.</P>
<P>Captain answer'd, <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> I do assure you, the Pistol was not design'd for you, but for another; for I knew the Whole before. We then talk'd of indifferent Things, and spent the Evening in a very affable Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 29th, came here five <HI>Indian</HI> Canoes, loaden with Mussels; Men, Women and Children were about fifty: These <HI>In∣dians</HI> had never been with us before; they
<PB N="78" REF="007859_0110_102DDB1BE3455F88"/>are not so generous and good natur'd as our Friends I have already mention'd; they were so mercenary, that they would not part with a single Mussel without something in Ex∣change; their Stay was but short with us, for the next Morning they launch'd their Ca∣noes and went off.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, September</HI> the 1st, the Carpenter was shot in the Thigh with several large Pewter Sluggs by the Captain's Cook; but he being at a great Distance, the Sluggs did not enter his Skin: Whether this was design'd, or accidental, we don't know; however, we thought it proper to disarm him.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the ad, Wind at N. and N. by W. with rain. This Day we were inform'd that three of the Deserters, <HI>viz. James Mit∣chel,</HI> Carpenter's Mate, <HI>Joseph King,</HI> and <HI>Owen Thomson,</HI> Seamen, were gone over to the Main in a Punt of their own building; the others were here Yesterday, and I believe would be gladly receiv'd again, but am of Opinion there are few Voices in their Fa∣vou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 4th, some Disorders among the People about watching the Provisions, some taking all Opportunities to rob the Stores. Our Living now is very hard; Shell-fish are
<PB N="79" REF="007859_0111_102DDB1E44FFCCE8"/>very scarce, and difficult to be had; the Sea-weeds are our greatest Support; we have found a Sort of Sea-weed, which we call <HI>Dulse;</HI> it is a narrow Weed, growing on rocks in the Sea, which, when boiled about Two Hours, thickens the Water like Flour; this we esteem a good and wholesom Food.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 6th, last Night the Store-Tent was robbed of Brandy and Flour: The People at hearing of this were greatly enraged, and insist on searching the Marines Tents; on Search they found four Bottles of Brandy, and four small Parcels of Flour. The Captain sent for the Lieutenant, Master, Gunner, Carpenter, and Surgeon, with Lieu∣tenants <HI>Hamilton, Ewers,</HI> and <HI>Fielding,</HI> of the Army; Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> was also sent for, but was so ill that he could not be pre∣sent, but desir'd all might pass according to the Judgment of the above-mentioned Offi∣cers. A Consultation was held: Five of the accus'd Marines did not appear, dreading the Punishment due to their Crime; they march'd off to the Deserters: Four more, who staid to be try'd, receiv'd Sentence, on the first Opportunity, to carry them off to the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and there to shift for themselves with the former Deserters. The Seamen insisted on a
<PB N="80" REF="007859_0112_102DDB20B631BBC8"/>Pint of Brandy each Man per Day, which was agreed on. The Provisions being found, were put into the Store.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 7th, I was invited to a Dog-Feast at Mr. <HI>Jones</HI>'s Tent: There were present at this Entertainment, the Lieutenant, the Honourable <HI>John Byron,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> Mr. <HI>Young,</HI> Lieutenants <HI>Ewers</HI> and <HI>Fielding,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Oakley,</HI> of the Army. It was exceeding good Eating; we thought no <HI>English</HI> Mutton preferable to it.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 8th, in the Afternoon, <HI>William Harvey,</HI> Quarter-Gunner, came to our Tent, with a Paper sign'd by seven People; the Contents as follows, viz.</P>

<P>The next Day, the above mention'd added one more to their Number, <HI>viz. Peter Pla∣stow,</HI> Captain's Steward: He came to acquaint us, he was willing to go with them, and hoped we would give our Consent; we told him we had nothing to do with it, therefore he must apply to the Captain.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 10th, hard Gales at W. N. W. with rain and Hail. The Captain sent for the Lieutenant, Master, myself, the Carpen∣ter, and Boatswain: When we were all met, the Captain ask'd us, if <HI>Plastow</HI> had men∣tion'd any Thing to us about going off in the Yawl. We told him he had. <HI>Plastow</HI> being sent for, the Captain said, <HI>Peter!</HI> I hear you are for going in the Boat. He answer'd, Yes, Sir; I will take my Chance, for I want to get to <HI>England.</HI> The Captain bade him be gone for a Villain, and said no more. This <HI>Plastow</HI> was a mighty Favourite with the Captain, and had often been admitted to his Conversation: He above all Men ought to
<PB N="82" REF="007859_0114_102DDB24A409BD10"/>have stood stedfast to him, because the Cap∣tain regarded him above the whole Body of People, and hath been heard to say as much. It was this Day agreed, that the Sentence put off on the 6th should be executed the first Opportunity, without any Delay; and that no Boat should go off from hence before all was ready, believing some have a Design to go to the Northward.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> the 11th, Wind at N. N. W. The People very uneasy: scarce any Work done for this Week past; every Thing is at a Stand; we have now among us no Com∣mand, Order, or Discipline; add to our Un∣easiness, the Uncomfortableness of the Cli∣mate; we have been Inhabitants of this Island sixteen Weeks, and have not seen ten fair Days; the Murmurings of the People, the Scarcity of Provision, and the Severity of the Weather, would really make a Man weary of Life.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 14th, last Night very hard Gales at N. and W. N. W. with large Showers of Hail, with Thunder. The Wind To-day is much abated. As to the Article of Provisions, nothing comes amiss; we eat Dogs, rats, and, in short, every Thing we can come at.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="007859_0115_102DDB2695B7A970"/>
<HI>Friday</HI> the 18th, <HI>Dennis O'Lary</HI> and <HI>John Redwood,</HI> Seamen, with six Marines, were put off to the Main, according to their Sen∣tence; it being a fine Summer's Day. This Day the Lieutenant, bringing a Pair of Pis∣tols to the Carpenter, and complaining they were in bad Order, did not imagine they were loaded, snapping the first it miss'd Fire, the second went off, but providentially did no Harm, tho' the Lieutenant had then a Crowd of People about him.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 20th, little Wind, and clear Weather. Launch'd the Barge, and went off to the Wreck; we took up four Casks of Beef, with a Cask of Pease, which was stav'd; we serv'd out to each Man five Pieces of Beef, and Pease to such as would have 'em, but there were none to take 'em, ha∣ving now Plenty of Meat, our Stomachs are become nice and dainty.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 23d, the People went to the Captain with a Two Gallon Cagg, and ask'd it full of Wine: The Captain refus'd 'em; but apprehending that they would make no Ceremony of filling it without Leave, and carrying it off by Force, he thought proper to order it to be fill'd: They brought it to the Long-Boat, and drank it in her Hold.
<PB N="84" REF="007859_0116_102DDB28DCBBA2F8"/>Stept the Long-Boat's Mast forward. The People very much disorder'd in Liquor, and very quarrelsome.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 24th, I was sent on a Week's Cruize in the Barge; the Officers with me were Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Mate, and the Hon. Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> Midshipman, and Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> the Purser, who was a good Draughtsman; we went in order to discover the Coast to the Southward, for the Safety of the Long-Boat; we were inform'd on our return, that the People in our Absence went to the Captain, and got two Gallons of Wine which they mixed with their half Pints of Brandy; they got all drunk and mad, but no great Mischiefs ensued. Six <HI>Indian</HI> Canoes likewise came in our Absence loaded with Men, Women and Children; they brought with them Clams out of the Shells strung on Lines: The <HI>In∣dian</HI> Women dived for Mussels, and brought them ashore in abundance; the Men went to the fresh Water river, and caught several Fish like our <HI>English</HI> Mullets. The People bought Dogs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they kill'd, and eat, esteeming the Flesh very good Food: The next Day the <HI>Indians</HI> went out and caught a vast Quantity of Fish out of a Pond, where they sent in their Dogs to hunt;
<PB N="85" REF="007859_0117_102DDB2AB478A9B8"/>the Dogs dived, and drove the Fish ashore in great Numbers, to one Part of the Pond, as if they had been drawn in a Seyne: the <HI>In∣dians</HI> sold the Fish to the People. This Me∣thod of catching Fish is, I believe, unknown any where else, and was very surprising; and, what is also very strange, after the <HI>Indians</HI> went away, we hauled the Seyne over the Pond, and could never get a Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 28th, returned with the Barge; the first Evening we were out we had a good Harbour for the Barge, which we put into; the first Animal we saw was a fine large Bitch, big with Puppies; we killed her; we then roasted one Side, and boiled the other, were exceeding well pleased with our Fare, supped heartily, and slept well: The next Morning we got up at Day-breaking, and proceeded on our Cruize, finding all along the Coast to be very dangerous; at Evening put into a Place of very good Shelter for the Barge: Here we found the <HI>Indians</HI> had been very lately, the Shore being covered with the Offals of Seal: In an Hour's Time we killed ten wild Fowl; we roasted three Geese and two Ducks, the rest we put into a Sea Pye, so that we fared most elegantly; got up at Day-light next Morning, but seeing the
<PB N="86" REF="007859_0118_102DDB2C5409BED8"/>Weather hazy and dirty, thought it not pro∣per to put out with the Barge, fearing we should not get a Harbour before Night; we took a Walk five Miles in the Country cross the Land to the Southward, but could not see any Shelter for the Boat, being then twelve Leagues from the Place we came from; so we returned back in the Evening, and got into a fine sandy Bay; I think it as good a Harbour for Shipping as any I ever saw: Coming into this Bay, saw the Southmost Land, which we had seen before, bearing about S. S. W. right over an Inlet of Land, about two Miles. After landing, lived as we did last Night; in the Morning we walked over, where we found a deep Bay, it being eighteen Leagues deep, and twelve Leagues broad; here we had a very good Prospect of the Coast; we found here the green Pease that Sir <HI>John Nar∣borough</HI> mentions in his Book.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> after our re∣turn from the Cruize, the Lieutenant, the Master, myself, the Boatswain, and Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Mate, went to the Captain, to acquaint him how forward the Boat was, and to consult some Measures to be observ'd on board the Boat, to prevent Mutiny; he desir'd a Day or two to consider of it.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="007859_0119_102DDB3001620CB8"/>
On <HI>Monday</HI> the 5th, the Carpenter sent his Case Bottle, as usual, to the Captain, to be filled with Wine; but it was sent back empty, with this Answer, I will give him none: This sudden Change of the Captain's Behaviour to the Carpenter, proceeded from some Words which the latter dropt, and were carried to the Captain; The Words the Car∣penter spoke were to this Purport, That he was not to be led by Favour or Affection, nor to be biassed by a Bottle of Brandy. To-day we heeled the Long-Boat, and caulked the Starboard Side, paid ber Bottom with Wax, Tallow, and Soap, that came out of the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 6th, hard Gales at N. W. and N. with rain: This Morning the Lieutenant acquainted us of the Captain's resolution, which was to be Captain as before, and to be governed by the rules of the Navy, and to stand or fall by them; it was objected in the present Situation, the rules of the Navy are not sufficient to direct us, several rules be∣ing requisite in our Circumstances which are not mention'd there; that the whole Body of Officers and People are determin'd not to be govern'd by those rules at present. This Objection was started, not from a Disrespect
<PB N="88" REF="007859_0120_102DDB31F0293558"/>to those rules; but we imagin'd, if Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> was restor'd to the absolute Com∣mand he had before the Loss of the <HI>Wager,</HI> that he would proceed again upon the same Principles, never on any Exigence consult his Officers, but act arbitrarily, according to his Humour and Confidence of superior Know∣ledge: While he acts with reason, we will support his Command with our Lives; but some restriction is necessary for our own Pre∣servation. We think him a Gentleman worthy to have a limitted Command, but too dange∣rous a Person to be trusted with an absolute one. This Afternoon the People insisted to be serv'd Brandy out of the Casks that were buried Under-ground; accordingly they were serv'd half a Pint each Man. Got the Long-Boat upright.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 8th, this Day the Master went to the Captain concerning ten half Bar∣rels of Powder more than can be carried off, which will make good Water-Casks for the Boats: The Captain told him not to start the Powder, or destroy any Thing without his Orders; and said, he must have Time to consider of it. In the Afternoon, Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> of the Land Forces, came on the Beach, and desired the Assistance of the
<PB N="89" REF="007859_0121_102DDB33983B4EE0"/>Seamen to take Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> a Prisoner, for the Death of Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> the Midship∣man; telling us, he should be call'd to an Account, if he did not. This Evening the Carpenter went up to the Hill-Tent, so cal∣led from its Situation; the People were shooting Balls at Marks; some of 'em were firing in Vollies, without Shot or Sluggs: One of the Men on the Beach fir'd at the Tent while the Carpenter was in it, who was standing with a Book in his Hand; there was a Piece of Beef hung close at his Cheek, the Ball went through the Tent and the Beef, but the Carpenter receiv'd no Damage. To∣day I overhaul'd the Powder, and told the Lieutenant that I had twenty-three half Bar∣rels in Store, and that we could not carry off in the Vessel above six half Barrels; there∣fore purpose to start the Overplus into the Sea, and make Water-Casks of the half Bar∣rels, they being very proper for that Pur∣pose. I desired him to acquaint the Captain with my Intention; that since he had no re∣gard for the Publick Good, or to any Thing that tending to promoting it, the Carpenter and I had determin'd never to go near him again. The Lieutenant declin'd going, fear∣ing the Captain would murder him; but he
<PB N="90" REF="007859_0122_102DDB35A4F2C938"/>sent the Master to him, to let him know the Necessity of starting the Powder: The Cap∣tain's Answer to the Master was, I desire you will not destroy any one Thing without my Orders. We now are convinc'd the Cap∣tain hath no Intention of going to the South∣ward, notwithstanding he had lately given his Word and Honour that he would; there∣fore Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> in order to put an End to all future Obstructions, demanded our Assistance to make him a Prisoner for the shooting Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> intending to carry him as such to <HI>England;</HI> at the same Time to confine Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> with him: which was readily agreed to by the whole Body. It was reckon'd dangerous to suffer the Cap∣tain any longer to enjoy Liberty; therefore the Lieutenant, Gunner, Carpenter, and Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Mate, resolv'd next Morning to surprize him in his Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 9th, this Morning went in a Body and surpriz'd the Captain in Bed, dis∣arm'd him, and took every Thing out of his Tent. The Captain said to the Seamen, what are you about? Where are my Offi∣cers? At which the Master, Gunner, Car∣penter, and Boatswain, went in. The Cap∣tain, said, Gentlemen, do you know what
<PB N="91" REF="007859_0123_102DDB37E4CFFB10"/>you have done, or are about? He was an∣swer'd, Yes, Sir, our Assistance was demanded by Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> to secure you as a Pri∣soner for the Death of Mr. <HI>Cozens;</HI> and as we are Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we are oblig'd to take you as such to <HI>England.</HI> The Captain said, Gentlemen, Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> hath nothing to do with me; I am your Commander still; I will shew you my In∣structions; which he did to the People; on this we came out. He then call'd his Officers a second Time, and said, What is this for? He was answer'd, as before, That Assistance was demanded by Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> to take him Prisoner for the Death of Mr. <HI>Cozens.</HI> He still insisted, Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> has no Bu∣siness with me; I could not think you would serve me so. It was told him, Sir, it is your own Fault: you have given yourself no man∣ner of Concern, for the Publick Good, on our going from hence; but have acted quite the reverse, or else been so careless and indifferent about it, as if we had no Com∣mander; and if other Persons had given them∣selves no more Trouble and Concern than you have, we should not be ready to go from hence as long as Provisions lasted. The Captain said, Very well, Gentlemen, you have
<PB N="92" REF="007859_0124_102DDB3A275D4158"/>caught me Napping; I do not see any of you in Liquor; you are a Parcel of brave Fel∣lows, but my Officers are Scoundrels: Then turning himself to me, he said, Gunner, where's my Lieutenant? Did not he Head You? I told him, No, Sir; but was here to see it executed, and is here now. One of you (says the Captain) call Mr. <HI>Beans.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Beans</HI> came, he said, What is all this for, Sir? Sir, it is Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Order. Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> hath no Business with me, and you will answer for it here∣after; if I do not live to see <HI>England,</HI> I hope some of my Friends will. On this the Lieu∣tenant left him. The Captain then address'd himself to the Seamen, saying, My Lads, I do not blame you; but it is the Villany of my Officers, which they will answer for here∣after. He then call'd Mr. <HI>Beans</HI> again, and said, Well, Sir, what do you design to do by me? The Lieutenant answer'd, Sir, your Officers have design'd the Purser's Tent for you. Hum! I should be obliged to the Gentlemen, if they would let me stay in my own Tent. The Lieutenant came to acquaint the Officers of the Captain's request; but they judg'd it inconvenient; as Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Tent join'd the Purser's, one Guard might serve
<PB N="93" REF="007859_0125_102DDB3BC45413F8"/>'em both; accordingly all his Things were mov'd to the Purser's Tent: As he was com∣ing along, he said, Gentlemen, you must excuse my not pulling my Hat off, my Hands are confin'd. Well, Captain <HI>Beans!</HI> you will be call'd to an Account for this here∣after. The Boatswain, after the Captain's Confinement, most barbarously insulted him, reproaching him with striking him, saying, Then it was your Time; but now, G—d d—n you, it is mine. The Captain made no reply but this, You are a Scoundrel for using a Gentleman ill when he is a Prisoner. When the Captain was a Prisoner, he de∣clared, he never intended to go to the South∣ward, having more Honour than to turn his Back on his Enemies; and farther, he said, Gentlemen, I do not want to go off in any of your Craft; for I never design'd to go for <HI>England,</HI> and would rather chuse to be shot by you; there is not a single Man on the Beach dare engage me; but this is what I fear'd.</P>
<P>It is very odd, that Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI> should now declare he never intended to go to the South∣ward, when he publickly gave his Word and Honour he would go that Way, or any Way where the Spirit of the People led: But he
<PB N="94" REF="007859_0126_102DDB3E08F17978"/>afterwards told his Officers, he knew he had a severe Trial to go through, if ever he came to <HI>England;</HI> and as for those who liv'd to return to their Country, the only Favour he requested from them, was to declare the Truth, without Favour or Prejudice; and this we promis'd faithfully to do: His Words, in this respect, were as much regarded by us as the Words of a dying Man, and have been most punctually observ'd.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 10th, little Wind at N. and N. W. Getting all ready for going off this Afternoon, the Captain sent for the Lieu∣tenant and me, desiring us both to go to Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> to know what he intended to do with him. We accordingly came, and both promis'd to go directly, and bring him his Answer. When we came out, went to the Lieutenant's Tent; from thence I ex∣pected, and made no doubt, but he would go to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s: But when I ask'd him; he refus'd; which very much surpriz'd me. I thought it very ungenerous to triflle with Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> or any Gentleman in his unhappy Situation; therefore went alone to Captain <HI>Pemberton.</HI> When I deliver'd him Captain <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Message, the Answer was, I design, and must carry him Prisoner to
<PB N="95" REF="007859_0127_102DDB4053BCC7B8"/><HI>England.</HI> I return'd, and acquainted Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> with Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Answer: He ask'd me then, if the Lieutenant was with me. I told him, No; and I believe did not design it. He said, Mr. <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> I am very much oblig'd to you, and could not think the Lieutenant would use me thus. In the Evening the Lieutenant and I were sent for again: The Captain said to the Lieutenant, Sir, have you been with Captain <HI>Pemberton?</HI> He answer'd, No, Sir. I thought, Sir, you promis'd me you would: However, I have his Answer from Mr. <HI>Bulkeley;</HI> I am to be carry'd a Prisoner to <HI>England.</HI> Gentlemen, I shall never live to see <HI>England,</HI> but die by Inches in the Voyage; and it is surprizing to me to think, what you can expect by going to the Southward, where there are ten Thou∣sand Difficulties to be encounter'd with: I am sorry so many brave Fellows should be led to go where they are not acquainted, when, by going to the Northward, there is the Island of <HI>Chili,</HI> not above ninety Leagues, where we need not fear taking Prizes, and may have a Chance to see the Commodore. I made Answer, Sir, you have said, that we shall be call'd to an Account for this in <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> I must tell you, for my Part, had I
<PB N="96" REF="007859_0128_102DDB4244146348"/>been guilty of any Crime, and was sure of being hang'd for it in <HI>England,</HI> I would make it my Choice to go there, sooner than to the Northward: Have not you given your Word and Honour to go to the South∣ward? It is true, there is a Chance in going to the Northward, by delivering us from this unhappy Situation of Life to a worse, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Prison. The Captain said no more but this, Gentlemen, I wish you well, and safe to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 11th, this Morning the Cap∣tain sent for me, and told me, he had rather be shot than carried off a Prisoner, and that he would not go off with us; therefore de∣sired me to ask the People to suffer him to remain on the Island: The People readily agreed to his request; and also consented to leave him all Things needful for his Support, as much as could be spar'd. Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> and the Surgeon chose to stay with him. We offer'd him also the Barge and Yawl, if he could procure Men to go with him. The Question was propos'd before the whole Body; but they all cry'd aloud for <HI>England,</HI> and let him stay and be d—n'd; does he want to carry us to Prison? There is not a Man will go. The Captain being
<PB N="97" REF="007859_0129_102DDB43DE9B24E0"/>depriv'd of his Command in the Manner above-mentioned, and for the reasons already given, it was resolv'd to draw some Articles to be sign'd for the Good of the Community, and to give the Lieutenant a limited Com∣mand. The Paper was drawn up in this Manner:</P>
<P>WHereas Captain <HI>David Cheap,</HI> our Commander in his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Wager,</HI> never consulted any of his Officers for the Safety and Preservation of the said Ship, and his Majesty's Subjects thereto be∣longing; but several Times, since the un∣happy Loss of the said Ship, he has been so∣licited in the most dutiful Manner, promi∣sing him at the same Time to support his Command with our Lives, desiring no more than to go off Heart in Hand from this Place to the Southward, which he gave his Word and Honour to do; and being almost ready for sailing, did apply to him, some few Days past, to draw up some proper Articles, in order to suppress Mutiny, and other material Things, which were thought necessary to be agreed to before we went off; but he, in the most scornful Manner, hath rejected every Thing propos'd for the Publick Good; and
<PB N="98" REF="007859_0130_102DDB45CF72AE70"/>as he is now a Prisoner, and the Command given to the Lieutenant, upon his Approba∣tion of the following Articles.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As we have no Conveniency for dressing Provisions on Board the Vessel for a third Part of the Number to be carried off the Spot, therefore this Day serv'd ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to every Man and Boy twelve Days Provision, for them to dress before we go off; and also it is agreed, that whoever is guilty of de∣frauding another of any Part of his Allow∣ance, on sufficient Proof thereof, the Person found guilty (without any respect of Per∣son) shall be put on Shore at the first con∣venient Place, and left there.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In regard to the Boats going off with us, we think proper to allow one Week's Provision for each Man appointed to go in them, in order to prevent Separation from each other, which would be of the worst Consequence of any Thing that can happen to us; to prevent which we do agree, that when under-way they shall not separate, but always keep within Musket-shot, and on no Pretence or Excuse whatsoever go beyond that reach. The Officer, or any other Per∣son, that shall attempt a Separation, or ex∣ceed
<PB N="99" REF="007859_0131_102DDB48333A51A0"/>the above mention'd Bounds, shall, on Proof, be put on shore and left behind.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is agreed, in order to suppress Mutiny, and prevent Broils and Quarrels on Board the Vessel, that no Man shall threaten the Life of another, or offer Violence in any Shape; the Offender, without any respect of Station or Quality, being found guilty, shall be put on Shore, and left behind.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> We do agree, whatever Fowl, Fish, or Necessaries of Life, we shall hap∣pen to meet with in our Passage, the same shall be divided among the whole; and if Captain <HI>David Cheap</HI> shall be put on Board a Prisoner, it shall not be in the Lieutenant's Power to release him.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Articles were agreed to, and sign'd by the under-mentioned.

<P>As soon as the above Things were deli∣ver'd, we got ready for sailing. I went and took my Leave of the Captain: He repeated his Injunction, That at my return to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> I would impartially relate all Proceed∣ings: He spoke to me in the most tender and affectionate Manner; and as a Token of his Friendship and regard for me, desir'd me to accept of a Suit of his best Wearing Appa∣rel: At parting, he gave me his Hand with a great deal of Chearfulness, wishing me well and safe to <HI>England.</HI> This was the last Time I ever saw the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ortunate Captain <HI>Cheap.</HI> However, we hope to see him again in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="007859_0136_102DDB52306E5890"/>that Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and myself may be freed from some heavy Imputations to our Prejudice laid on us by the Gentleman who succeeded him in Command, and who, ha∣ving an Opportunity of arriving before us in <HI>England,</HI> not only in the Places he touch'd at Abroad, but at Home, has blacken'd us with the greatest Calumnies; and by an im∣perfect Narrative, has not only traduc'd us, but made the whole Affair so dark and mysti∣cal, that, till the Captain's Arrival, the Lords of the Admiralty will not decide for or against us. But if that unfortunate Captain never returns to his Country, let us do so much Justice to his Character, to declare, that he was a Gentleman possess'd of many Virtues; he was an excellent Seaman himself, and lov'd a Seaman; as for personal Bravery, no Man had a larger Share of it; even when a Pri∣soner, he preserv'd the Dignity of a Com∣mander; no Misfortunes could dispirit or de∣ject him, and Fear was a Weakness he was intirely a Stranger to; the Loss of the Ship, was the Loss of him; he knew how to go∣vern while he was a Commander on Board, but when Things were brought to Confusion and Disorder, he thought to establish his Command ashore by his Courage, and to
<PB N="105" REF="007859_0137_102DDB5424E8CAA0"/>suppress the least Insult on his Authority on the first Occasion; an Instance of this was seen on the Boatswain's first appearing ashore; shooting Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> and treating him in the Manner he did after his Confinement, was highly resented by the People, who soon got the Power in their own Hands, the Officers only had the Name, and they were often compell'd, for the Preservation of their Lives, to comply sometimes with their most unrea∣sonable Demands; and it is a Miracle, amidst the Wildness and Distraction of the People, that there was no more Bloodshed.</P>
<P>At Eleven in the Forenoon, the whole Body of People embark'd, to the Number of eighty-one Souls; fifty-nine on Board the Vessel, on Board the Cutter twelve, and in the Barge ten: At Noon got under Sail, the Wind at N. W. by W. The Captain, Sur∣geon, and Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> being on the Shore-side, we gave them three Cheers; which they return'd. Coming out of <HI>Wager</HI>'s Bay split the Fore-sail, and very narrowly escap'd the rocks; with the Assistance of the Barge, and our own Oars, tow'd her clear, and bore away, into a large sandy Bay, on the South∣side of the <HI>Lagoon,</HI> which we call'd by the Name of the <HI>Speedwell</HI> Bay. At Four in the
<PB N="106" REF="007859_0138_102DDB561053F650"/>Afternoon anchor'd in ten Fathom, fine Sand; the Barge and Cutter went ashore, there not being room on Board the Boat to lodge the People.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 14th, fresh Gales at S. W. and W. with rain. At three this Afternoon, being fair Weather, weigh'd, and came to Sail; to take a Cruize up the <HI>Lagoon,</HI> to try the Vessel, it being smooth Water, she work'd very well; after three or four Trips return'd, and anchor'd where we came from.</P>

<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 15th, This Morning, it being Calm, made a Signal for the Boats to come off, by firing five Muskets. At Day-light came to Sail, with the Wind at W. by N. It blowing hard, and a great Swell, the Vessel would not work; therefore we were oblig'd to put into a small Bay, lying S. W. of <HI>Harvey</HI>'s Bay, where we had a very good Shelter, there being a large Ledge of rocks without us, which broke the Sea off. At Eleven we sent the Barge to <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Bay for what Canvass could be found serviceable, having left a sufficient Quantity behind, to supply us with Sails, in Case we wanted 'em. Went in the Barge the Hon. <HI>John Byron,</HI> at his own request, <HI>Alexander Campbell</HI> Mid∣shipman, <HI>William Harvey</HI> Quarter-Gunner, <HI>David Buckley</HI> ditto, <HI>William Rose</HI> Quarter-Master, <HI>Richard Noble</HI> ditto, <HI>Peter Plastow</HI> Captain's Steward, <HI>Joseph Clinch</HI> Seaman, and <HI>Rowland Crusset</HI> Marine. This Afternoon the Carpenter want ashore in the Cutter, with
<PB N="109" REF="007859_0141_102DDB5BF08EB1D0"/>several of the People, to look for Proven∣der. Shot several Geese, and other Sea-Fowl; rainy Weather. Wind W. N. W.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 16th, continual rain, and hard Gales all Night at S. W. This Morning the Carpenter came on Board, and acquainted us that he saw an Anchor of seven Feet in the Shank, the Palm of each Arm filed off just above the Crown: This Anchor we suppose to have belong'd to some small Vessel wreck'd on the Coast. The Cutter brought off Abun∣dance of Shell-fish ready dress'd for the People.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 18th, at Noon, the Cutter came off, and brought aboard Plenty of Shell-fish and Greens. The Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> and three of the Barge's Crew, came from where the Barge lay. Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> came aboard, and inform'd us of the Barge's being safe in the Bay, where we left her, and only waited the Opportunity of Weather to come round with her: At the same Time he desired to know, if we would give him, and those who would stay with Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> their Share of Provisions. This Question of Mr. <HI>Byron</HI>'s very much surpriz'd us; and what surpriz'd us more was, that he should be influenc'd by Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> a Person whom he always held in Contempt. As for my
<PB N="110" REF="007859_0142_102DDB5EA5EBC768"/>Part, believe Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> left us because he could not get any Accomodation aboard the Vessel that he lik'd, being oblig'd to lie forward with the Men; as were also the Carpenter and myself, when below: It is very certain, that we are so closely pent up for want of room, that the worst Jail in <HI>England</HI> is a Palace to our present Situation.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 20th, serv'd out to the People eight Days Flour, to be dress'd ashore. I went in the Cutter to Command in my Turn for a Week.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 21st, close Weather; the Wind from W. to N. W. with rain and Hail. Brought aboard Shell-fish in abun∣dance. At Noon the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> came with some of the Crew Over-land; he ask'd me, whether the Boat's Crew were gone off, and if we had serv'd the Provision, for he wanted to return to the Barge. I told him all the People were out a Fishing, and that the first who came in should carry him off. On which he said, I think we will go and get some Fish too, having nothing else to live on. This was the last Time I ever saw his Honour. When the People return'd from fishing, they told me Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> had lost his Hat, the Wind blowing it off his Head,
<PB N="111" REF="007859_0143_102DDB60E8E29D20"/>I said, rather than he should want a Hat, I would give him my own. One of the Sea∣men forced a Hat on his Head; his Name was <HI>John Duck:</HI> But Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> would by no Means wear it; saying, <HI>John!</HI> I thank you; if I accept of your Kindness, you must go bare-headed; and, I think, I can bear Hardships as well as the best of you, and must use myself to them. I took eight Peo∣ple, and went over Land to the Place where the Barge lay, to get the Canvass that we stood so much in Need of; but found she was gone from thence. The People in the Barge told our Men, that they would return to us again; but it is plain they never intended it.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 22d, This Day we saw Sea-Fowl in vast Flocks flying to the Southward, where was a dead Whale. Look'd out all this Day for the Barge, but to no Purpose. The Barge not returning was a very great Misfortune, having no Boat but the Cutter; and if by an unlucky Accident we lose her, we must be reduced to the greatest Extremi∣ties to get Provision. The Persons in the Barge, except the Captain's Steward, always approv'd of going to the Southward; but it seems Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> the Patroon prevail'd on 'em to return to Captain <HI>Cheap.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="007859_0144_102DDB6282B5D900"/>
<HI>Friday</HI> the 23d, Saw Thousands of Sea-Fowl; in the Morning they fly to the North∣ward, and in the Evening come back to the South; they are Birds of a very large Size, but of what Kind we do not know. Since we have been here we saw several <HI>Indian</HI> Graves; they are dug just within the Surface of the Earth, with a Board on each Side, and a Cross stuck up at the Head. The Day following a Gun, a four Pounder, was seen near the Anchor in <HI>Clam</HI> Bay; we call it by this Name, because of the vast Quantities of this Sort of Shell-fish which are found there.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 26th, it being very calm, and fair Weather, I went ashore to bring off the People; weigh'd the Long-Boat, and took her in Tow over a Bar, where was ten Feet Water, but a great Swell; as soon we got over the Bar, there sprung up a Breeze of Wind at N. W. steer'd away S. half E. for the Southmost Part of Land, which bore S. by E. distant fourteen Leagues. The two Points of Land make a large and deep sandy Bay; we sounded, but found no Ground; it is a bold Shore close to. I kept a-head in the Cutter, in order to provide a Harbour for the Long-Boat; Providence directed us to a very good one: It blew so hard, with thick
<PB N="113" REF="007859_0145_102DDB6460DD48C8"/>hazy Weather, that we could not keep the Sea. At Eight at Night we anchor'd in eight Fathom Water a-breast of a fine sandy Bay, and Land lock'd not above three Boats Length from the Shores: At the Entrance of the Harbour, which lies about a League up the <HI>Lagoon,</HI> I set the Land; the Northmost Point bore by the Compass N. by E. distant twelve Leagues, and the Southmost S. by W. distant five Leagues, the Entrance lies E.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 27th, Fresh Gales at W. and cloudy Weather, with a great Swell without, insomuch that we could not put out to Sea; we therefore sent the People ashore to dress their Provisions: each Man is allow'd but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour <HI>per</HI> Day, without any other Subsistence, but what Pro∣vidence brings in our Way.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 29th, Early this Morning, it being calm and thick Weather, with small rain, we rowed out of the <HI>Lagoon;</HI> at Five it cleared up, with a fresh Breeze at S. S. E. steer'd S. W. and S. W. by W. saw a small Island bearing S. by W. the Southmost End S. by E. This Island we call the rock of <HI>Dundee,</HI> it being much like that Island in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> but not so large, it lieth about four Leagues distant from the Southmost
<PB N="114" REF="007859_0146_102DDB675604DF10"/>Point of Land out at Sea. This Day it blow'd so hard, that we were oblig'd to take the Cutter in Tow.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 30th, Hard Gales, and a great Sea; saw some Islands and some sunken rocks; at Six saw the Main in two Points of Land, with a large Opening; on each Side <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sunken rocks are innumerable; the En∣trance is so dangerous, that no Mortal would attempt it, unless his Case was despe∣rate, as ours; we having nothing but Death before our Eyes in keeping the Sea, and the same Prospect in running in with the Land: We ran in before the Wind to the Opening that appear'd between the two Points, the Northmost of which bore N. by E. and the Southmost S. by E. We steer'd in E. and found the Opening to be a large <HI>Lagoon,</HI> on the Southmost Side, running into a very good Harbour; here our small Vessel lay secure in a Cove, which Nature had form'd like a Dock; we had no Occasion to let go an An∣chor, but ran along-side the Land, and made fast our Head and Stern. The People went ashore in Search of Provision; here we found Plenty of Wood and Water, and fine large Mussels in great Quantities. Serv'd to each Man half a Piece of Beef.</P>

<HI>Saturday</HI> the 31st, This Morning cast loose, and row'd towards the Mouth of the <HI>Lagoons,</HI> designing to put out to Sea; but the Wind blew so hard, that we were oblig'd to come to an Anchor. This Afternoon, in weighing the Grapenel, in order to go to the Cove, we found it foul among some rocks; all Hands haul'd, took a turn round the Main-mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and went aft; which weigh'd the Grapenel, but streighten'd one of the Flukes: Here the Land is very high and steep on each Side; the Carpenter and Cooper were on the highest of these Hills, and found deep Ponds of Wa∣ter on the Top of them; these Hills are very rocky, and there are great Falls of Water all along the Coast: The whole Navy of <HI>En∣gland</HI> may lay with Safety in many of those <HI>Lagoons;</HI> but the Coast is too dangerous for any Ship to fall in with the Land. The Peo∣ple To-day were very much afflicted with the Gripes, and Pains in their Side. Here are Abundance of Trees, not unlike our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew Trees: they are not above seven or eight Inches in Diameter, and the Bark is like Ce∣dar. The Land is to Appearance very good; but on digging beneath the Surface, we find it almost an entire Stone. We saw no People here, tho', it is plain, here have been some
<PB N="116" REF="007859_0148_102DDB6A8E085C88"/>lately, by their Wigg-wams or Huts. We are so closely pent up for want of room, that our Lodging is very uncomfortable; the Stench of the Mens wet Cloaths makes the Air we breathe nauseous to that Degree, that one would think it impossible for a Man to live below. We came to sail, and steer'd out of the <HI>Lagoon</HI> West; went into a sandy Bay, one League to the Southward of the <HI>Lagoon, Indian</HI> Huts to be seen, but no Natives.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> the 2d, at Five in the Morning, came to sail with the Wind at S. and S. by E. At Noon the Wind came to the W. and W.N.W. in small Breezes: This Day I had a very good Observation, it being the first since we left <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Island. We found ourselves in the Latitude of 50:00 S. After observing, bore away, and ran into a fine smooth Passage between the Island and the Main. These Islands I believe to be the same that are taken Notice of in <HI>Cook</HI>'s Voy∣age. From the Entrance to the Northward, to the going out of the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> (as we call it) the Distance is about six Leagues, and the Depth of Water is from two Fathom to twelve; the Northmost Land before we came into the Passage bore N. by W.
<PB N="117" REF="007859_0149_102DDB6D49ECFC30"/>and the Southmost, or Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> bore S. by E. In the Evening anchored in a fine sandy Bay: Here we also saw <HI>Indian</HI> Huts, but no People; To-day we shot wild Geese in Abundance, and got of Shell-Fish, as Limpets and Mussels.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 3d, At Four this Morning weighed, and came to sail with the Wind at W. till we got about the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> then at W. N. W. steering S. and a tumbling Sea from the W. The Cutter steer'd S. by E. into a deep Bay; supposing them not to see the Southmost Land, we made the Signal for her, by hoisting an Ensign at the Topping-Lift; as the Cutter was coming up to us, her square Sail splitted; we offered to take them in Tow, but they would not ac∣cept it; we lay with our Sails down some time before they would show any Signal of making Sail; coming before the Wind, and a large Sea, we ordered them to steer away for the Southmost Point of Land after us, and to keep as near as possible: but instead of observ∣ing our Directions, they steered away into the Cod of a deep Bay, supposed to be <HI>King</HI>'s Bay: The Cutter being much to Lee∣ward, and the Weather coming on very thick, we were obliged to steer after her, but soon
<PB N="118" REF="007859_0150_102DDB6EE80E2298"/>lost Sight of her. The Place being exceeding dangerous, we could not venture any farther after the Cutter; therefore we hauled by the Wind to the Southward; it continued blowing hard, with thick Weather, with sunken rocks, and Breakers, so that we were obliged to bear away before the Wind into a large Bay, the Tide running rampant, and in a great Swell, every where surrounded with sunken rocks, that we thought nothing but a Miracle could save us; at last we got safe into the Bay, and came to in two Fathom Water, we steered in E. At four this Morning rowed out between the Islands; after we got out, had a fresh Breeze at N. W. steered out <HI>S. S. W.</HI> then <HI>S.</HI> and <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> the Cutter a-head. At seven in the Morning a-breast of <HI>Cape Good-Hope,</HI> saw a large high rock bearing <HI>S.</HI> steered <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> going within it, and the Main a-breast of the rocks; saw a long Point making into Islands bearing <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> steer'd <HI>S.</HI> until a-breast of them: The same Day saw a very high Land, with a low Point running off, in small Hom∣macoes, bearing from the Northmost Point <HI>S.</HI> by E. about eighteen Leagues; between those two Points, is a large deep Bay, all within surrounded with rocks and small I∣slands; steered <HI>S.</HI> and <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> for the outer∣most
<PB N="119" REF="007859_0151_102DDB70D86D3450"/>Point, the Cutter keeping within, and we considering the ill Consequence of being embay'd, to prevent which we haul'd the Mainsail and Foresail down, and kept the Vessel before the Wind; at Eleven the Cutter came along-side, with her Mainsail split; we called to them to take hold of a Tow-rope, but they refused, telling us that the Boat would not bear towing, by reason of the Swell of the Sea, therefore they would have us nearer the Shore, where we should have smooth Water; we answered them that the Water was smoother without, and nothing nigh the Sea that runs within; besides, we shall be embay'd, therefore we desire you to come on board the Vessel, and we'll take the Boat in Tow: They had no regard to what we said, we at the same Time, for above a Quarter of an Hour, lay in the Trough of the Sea, with a fair Wind: The People in the Cutter would neither make Sail, nor row; at last, finding them obstinate, we hoisted a skirt of the Mainsail, and edged farther off, S. by W. When they found we would not go into that Bay, they hoisted their Mainsail, and went a-head; being some Distance a-head, we made sail, the Cutter still keeping a-head till One o'Clock, then she bore away
<PB N="120" REF="007859_0152_102DDB731A8477A8"/><HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> and <HI>S. S. E.</HI> the reason of which we could not tell, it blowing very hard, with a great Sea, nothing before us but rocks and Breakers, therefore of Consequence the far∣ther in, the Sea must be the greater. At half an Hour past Two, the Cutter being on the Beam, and four Miles within us, we bore away after them; and in a very heavy Squall of Wind and rain we lost sight of her: After the Squall was over, it cleared up, but we saw nothing of the Cutter, nor could we clear the Shore to the Northward, being not above two Miles off the Breakers; therefore we were under a Necessity of hauling to the southward for Self-preservation, and very narrowly e∣scaped clearing the rocks: After running about three Lragues, saw an Opening, where we hoped to find a good Harbour; bore away for the Opening, we were here again sur∣rounded with rocks and Breakers, with a hard Gale of Wind, and a great Sea, the oldest Seaman on board never saw a more dismal Prospect; we ran in before the Wind for about two Leagues, expecting every rise and Fall of the Sea to be a Wreck, but Pro∣vidence at length conducted us to an indiffe∣rent Place of Shelter: We are now in a most wretched Condition, having no Boat to go
<PB N="121" REF="007859_0153_102DDB750AD02870"/>ashore in, to seek for Provender: And the greatest Part of the People on board are so regardless of Life, that they really appear quite indifferent whether they shall live or die; and it is with much Intreaty that any of them can be prevailed on to come upon Deck, to assist for their Preservation.</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 4th, Hard Gales at W. N. W. and a great Sea without; served out Flour and a Piece of Beef to two Men for a Week's Subsistence; the Weather is so bad that there is no other Food to be got.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="007859_0154_102DDB772D672F28"/>
<HI>Thursday</HI> the 5th, Little Wind at S. W. with heavy rains, at six this Morning went under Sail, but could make no hand of it, therefore were obliged to put back again: As soon as we came to an Anchor, the Boat∣swain employed himself in making a raft to get Ashore with; this raft was made with Oars and Water Barrels, when it was made, and over the Side it would carry three Men; but it was no sooner put off from the Vessel's Side but it canted, and obliged the People to swim for their Lives; the Boatswain got hold of the raft, and with some Difficulty, reached the Shore; when he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me off in the Evening, he informed us he had seen a Beef Puncheon, which gave us some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>son to apprehend some other Ship of the Squadron had suffered our Fate.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 6th, This Morning went under Sail, the Wind at W. N. W. with fresh Gales and heavy rain; the Wind came to the Westward, and a great Sea, so that we could not turn out over the Bar: In our putting back we saw the Cutter, a very agreeable Sight, which gave us new Life; in the Even∣ing anchored at the Place sailed from; the Carpenter and others went ashore to get Shell∣fish, which we stood in great Need of; at
<PB N="123" REF="007859_0155_102DDB79D3146640"/>Night the proper Boat's Crew would not go Ashore with the Boat as usual, but made her fast a-stern of the Vessel, with only two Men in her, she never being left without four before; at Eleven at Night one of the Men came out of her into the Vessel, it blowing very hard at N. N. E. in half an Hour shifted to N. W. and rainy Weather, that we could not see a Boat's Length: At Two the next Morning the Cutter broke loose from the Stern of the Vessel; we called from on Board to <HI>James Stewart,</HI> the Man that was in her, but he could not hear us; in a short Time we lost sight of her, believing she must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ove stove among the rocks. The Loss of the Cutter gives the few thinking People aboard a great deal of Uneasiness; we have seventy-two Men in the Vessel, and not above six of that Number that give themselves the least Concern for the Preservation of their Lives, but are rather the reverse, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipe for Mutiny and Destruction; this is a great Affliction to the Lieutenant, myself, and the Carpenter; we know not what to do to bring them under any Command; they have trou∣bled us to that Degree, that we are weary of our Lives; therefore this Day we have told the People, that, unless they alter their
<PB N="124" REF="007859_0156_102DDB7BC0713090"/>Conduct, and subject themselves to Com∣mand, that we will leave them to themselves, and take our Chance in this desolate Part of the Globe, rather than give ourselves any farther Concern about so many thoughtless Wretches: Divided the People into four Watches, to make more room below. The People have promis'd to be under Govern∣ment, and seem much easier.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 8th, This Morning the People requested Provisions to be serv'd; it being four Days before the usual Time, we think the request very unreasonable. We laid the Inconveniencies before them of breaking in upon our Stores, considering the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dness of the Wearher, and the Length of our Passage; that if we are not exceedingly provident in regard of serving our Provisions, we must all inevitably starve. They will not hearken to reason; therefore we are obliged to com∣ply with their Demands, and serve out Pro∣visions accordingly. Several of the People have desired to be put on Shore, desiring us to allow them some few Necessaries: We wanted to know what could induce them to request our putting them ashore in this re∣mote and desolate Part of the World: They answer'd, they did not fear doing well, and
<PB N="124" REF="007859_0157_102DDB7D8DBFA358"/>doubted not but to find the Cutter, which if they did, they would go back to the North∣ward, otherwise they would make a Canoe; therefore insisted on going ashore. On their earnest Intreaties, the Body of People agreed to their request: We haul'd the Boat close in Shore; the People who chose to stay behind were eleven in Number; we supply'd them with proper Necessaries, and they sign'd a Certificate, to inform the Lords of the Admi∣ralty that they were not compell'd to stay, but made it their own Choice, and that they did it for the Preservation of themselves and us.</P>

<P>THESE are to certify the Right Ho∣nourable the Lords Commissioners for Ex∣ecuting the Office of Lord High Admiral of<HI> Great Britain, &amp;c. </HI>That we, whose Names are under mention'd, since the Misfortune of lo∣sing the Cutter, have considered the ill Conveni∣encies and Difficulties to be attended, where so great a Number of People are to be carried off; therefore we have requested, and desired the Officers and Company remaining of the same Vessel to put us on Shore with such Necessaries of Life as can be conveniently spared out of the

<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 9th, at Ten at Night, we weigh'd, and row'd out of the Bay; at Day∣light
<PB N="127" REF="007859_0159_102DDB81C54ECB90"/>got about four Leagues right out, every Way surrounded with rocks and Breakers, with a great Western Swell: We found it a very difficult Matter to get clear of those rocks and Breakers, they reach along shore eighteen Leagues, and without us at Sea eight Leagues, I take it, that from the Land they are fourteen Leagues in the Offing; those sunken rocks appear like a low level Land. This Coast is too dangerous for Shipping, the Wind being three Parts of the Year to the Westward, which blows right on the Shore, with a large Western swell, that seldom or never ceases; it always blows and rains; it is worse here than in the rainy season on the Coast of <HI>Guinea;</HI> nor can we as yet distin∣guish Summer from Winter, only by the Length of the Days. Steer'd out of the Bay <HI>W.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> then <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> then <HI>S.</HI> At Noon I had a good Observation in the the Latitude of 50: 50 South; the Northmost Part of the Bay bore <HI>N.

This Coast, as far as we have come, lies <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> and <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> by the Compass.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 10th, At Four this Morning made all the sail we could, steering <HI>S. E.</HI> in order to make the Land; at six steer'd in
<PB N="128" REF="007859_0160_102DDB83AF829518"/><HI>E. S. E.</HI> at seven made the Land; at Eight saw a Point of Land bearing <HI>S. E.</HI> distant six Leagues, which, when a-breast, seeing no Land to the <HI>S.</HI> I take the Point for Cape <HI>Victory,</HI> and the four Islands we see I believe to be the Islands of <HI>Direction,</HI> which <HI>Sir John Narborough</HI> gives an Account of; excepting the Distance, they exactly answer his De∣scription; therefore, by the Latitude in Ye∣sterday's Observation, and by the Distance we have run since, we are now at the Opening of the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> At Ten in the Morning, hard Gales at <HI>N. W.</HI> steer'd <HI>S. E.</HI> the Cape bearing <HI>E.</HI> distant four Leagues; at Noon bore <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> distant six Leagues; haul'd the Mainsail down, and went under a Foresail. I never in my Life, in any Part of the World, have seen such a Sea as runs here; we expected every Wave to swallow us, and the Boat to founder. This Shore is full of small Islands, rocks and Breakers; so that we can't haul further to the South∣ward, for fear of endangering the Boat; we are oblig'd to keep her right before the Sea. At Five broach'd to, at which we all be∣liev'd she would never rise again. We were surrounded with rocks, and so near that a Man might toss a Bisket on them: We had
<PB N="129" REF="007859_0161_102DDB85A3815330"/>nothing but Death before our Eyes, and every Moment expected our Fate. It blew a Hurricane of Wind, with thick rainy Wea∣ther, that we could not see twice the Boat's Length; we pray'd earnestly for its clearing up, for nothing else could save us from pe∣rishing; we no sooner ask'd for Light, but it was granted us from above. At the Weather's clearing up, we saw the Land on the North-Shore, with Islands, Rocks, and Breakers all around us; we were obliged to put in among 'em for Shelter, finding it impossible to keep the Sea; we were in with the Land amongst them, and compell'd to push thro', looking Death in the Face, and expecting every Sea to bury us; the boldest Men among us were dismay'd, nor can we possibly give an Account in what Manner we have been this Day deliver'd. After sailing amidst Islands, rocks, and Breakers, for above a League, we got safe into a good Harbour, surrounded with small Islands, which kept the Sea off; here the Water was as smooth as in a Mill-pond. We call this Harbour the <HI>Port of God's Mercy,</HI> esteeming our Preser∣vation this Day to be a Miracle. The most abandon'd among us no longer doubt of an
<PB N="130" REF="007859_0162_102DDB87D04EB690"/>Almighty Being, and have promis'd to reform their Lives.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 11th, The Wind much abated, with rain. This Morning weigh'd and ran farther in. In the Evening we saw two <HI>In∣dians</HI> lying on their Bellies on the Top of a steep rock, just over the Vessel, peeping with their Heads over the Hill. As soon as we discover'd them, we made Motions to them to come down; they then rose up, and put on their Heads white feather'd Caps; we then hoisted a white Sheet for an Ensign; at this they made a Noise, pronouncing <HI>Orza, Orza;</HI> which we took for a Signal to come ashore. We would not suffer above two Men to go ashore, and those disarm'd, lest we should put them in Fear. The <HI>Indians</HI> had nothing in their Hands but a Club, like to our Cricket-Batts, with which they kill their Seal. As soon as they saw the two Men come ashore, they walk'd away; and when they perceiv'd our Men follow'd them, and gain'd Ground of them, they took to their Heels, frequently looking back, crying <HI>Orza, Orza,</HI> beckoning the People to follow, which they did for a Mile or two along Shore, out of Sight of the Vessel: Then the <HI>Indians</HI> fled to the Woods, still wanting our
<PB N="131" REF="007859_0163_102DDB89C0EA40C0"/>People to follow them; but being disarm'd, they were apprehensive the <HI>Indians</HI> would Bush-fight them; so they thought proper to give over the Pursuit, and to return to the Boat.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 12th, Hard Gales at W.N.W. with rain. At Six this Morning we again saw the two <HI>Indians;</HI> they made the same Noise and Motions to come ashore; at which I went with four of the People; the <HI>Indians</HI> walk'd and ran as before, looking back, and making Signs to follow, which we did till we got to the Place where the Canoe lay with four <HI>Indians</HI> in her. The two <HI>Indians</HI> got into the Canoe, and put her off the Shore before we could get nigh them; as soon as we got a-breast of the Canoe, they made Signs as if they wanted Cloathing; we en∣deavour'd to make them understand we wanted Fish, and would truck with them; they had none, but signified to us they would go and get some: They had a mangey Dog, which they parted with to one of the People for a Pair of Cloth Trowsers; this Dog was soon kill'd, dress'd, and devour'd. Here we found Plenty of Mussels, which gave us great re∣lief, having scarce any Thing to subsist on for this Week past.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="007859_0164_102DDB8BAB6CAB30"/>
<HI>Friday</HI> the 13th, Very uncertain Weather, and squally; the Wind variable from W.N.W. to S.S.W. This Morning all Hands ashore a fishing. Lieutenant <HI>Ewers</HI> of the Marines kill'd a large Seal or Sea-Dog; it is exceed∣ing good Food, and we judg'd it to have weigh'd seventeen Score.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 14th, Little Wind at W.N.W. and close Weather, with rain. At Five this Morning cast loose, and steer'd South out be∣tween the Islands; the Weather clearing up, we saw the South Shore; it first appear'd like a large Island, stretching away to the Westward, and at the West-End two Hom∣macoes like Sugar-loaves, and to the South∣ward of them a large Point of rocks; steer'd S.E. until the Point bore W. then steer'd S.E. by E. I took the Point for Cape <HI>Pillar,</HI> and was fully assur'd of our being in the <HI>Streights.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 15th, At Three this Morning cast loose, and row'd, but could not get out, so were oblig'd to put back, and make fast, it blowing hard, with thick Wea∣ther all Day: in the Evening it clear'd up. This Day several People drove a Trade with their Allowance, giving Silver Buckles for Flour, valued at twelve Shilling <HI>per</HI> Pound, and before Night it reach'd to a Guinea, the
<PB N="133" REF="007859_0165_102DDB8DF0A73340"/>People crying aloud for Provisions, which are now so scarce, that several on Board are actu∣ally starving through Want.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 16th, At Three this Morning cast loose, being little Wind, and steer'd up the <HI>Streights</HI> S. E. by E. the Wind at N. W. At Eight o'Clock got a-breast of Cape <HI>Mon∣day;</HI> at Nine the Cape bore W. distant four Leagues; at Noon running along Shore, made two Openings, which put the rest of the Officers to a Stand, not knowing which to take for the right Passage. Asking my Opi∣nion, I gave it for keeping on the E. S. E. Passage, the other lying S. E. by S. On which they said, Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> bids us keep the South Shore on Board. I an∣swer'd, That Sir <HI>John</HI> tells us E. S E. is the direct Course from Cape <HI>Pillar;</HI> I'll venture my Life that we are now in the right Pas∣sage; so we kept on E. by S. half S. After running a League or two up, and not seeing Cape <HI>Quod,</HI> nor any Outlet, the Wind blow∣ing hard, we were for running no farther, whereas one League more would have con∣vinc'd every Body; but they all gave it a∣gainst me, that we were not in the right Pas∣sage. The Wind being at W. N. W. we could not turn back again so that we were oblig'd
<PB N="134" REF="007859_0166_102DDB90056FA1D0"/>to put into a Cove lying on the North Shore, where we found good anchoring in four Fa∣thom Water no Provisions to be got here, be∣ing a barren rocky Place, producing not any Thing for the Preservation of Life. This Afternoon died <HI>George Bateman,</HI> a Boy, aged sixteen Years; This poor Creature starv'd, perish'd, and died a Skeleton, for want of Food. There are several more in the same miserable Condition, and who, without a speedy relief, must undergo the same Fate.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 17th, At Five this Morning weigh'd and row'd out, it being calm: at Seven a fresh Breeze right up the Sound; we could not turn to Windward not above a Mile from where we last lay; we made fast along Side the rocks; all Hands ashore a fishing for Mussels, Limpets, and Clams; here we found those Shell-fish in Abundance, which prov'd a very seasonable relief. Just before we got in, one of the Men gave a Guinea for a Pound of Flour, being all the Money he had.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 18th, The Wind W. N. W. in hard Squalls, with Hail and Snow. This Morning cast loose, and stood over to the Southward, believing the Tide to run stronger and more true than on the North-shore, ho∣ping
<PB N="135" REF="007859_0167_102DDB91ED804120"/>shortly to get out of the Sound, which is not above a League in the Wind's Eye. At Two o'Clock got into a Cove on the South∣side; made fast along Side of the rocks; all Hands on Shore getting Mussels, and other Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 19th, Fresh Gales at W. N. W. with Hail and Snow. This Morning cast loose, and sail'd out, but could make no Hand of it; our Boat will not work to Windward; put back from whence we came, and sent the People ashore to get Mussels. This Night departed this Life Mr. <HI>Thomas Caple,</HI> Son of the late Lieutenant <HI>Caple,</HI> aged twelve Years, who perish'd for want of Food. There was a Person on Board who had some of the Youth's Money, upwards of twenty Guineas, with a Watch and Silver Cup. Those last the Boy was willing to sell for Flour; but his Guardian told him, he would buy Cloaths for him in the <HI>Brazil.</HI> The miserable Youth cry'd, Sir, I shall never live to see the <HI>Brazil;</HI> I am starving now, almost starv'd to Death; therefore, for G—d's Sake, give me my Sil∣ver Cup to get me some Victuals, or buy some for me yourself. All his Prayer's and Intreaties to him were vain; but Heaven sent Death to his relief, and put a Period to his
<PB N="136" REF="007859_0168_102DDB948B0BD5C8"/>Miseries in an Instant. Persons who have not experienc'd the Hardships we have met with, will wonder how People can be so inhuman to see their Fellow-Creatures starving before their Faces, and afford 'em no relief: But Hunger is void of all Compassion: every Person was so intent on the Preservation of his own Life, that he was regardless of ano∣ther's, and the Bowels of Commiseration were shut up. We slip no Opportunity, Day or Night, to enter into the supposed right <HI>Streights,</HI> but can get no Ground. This Day we serv'd Flour and a Piece of Beef be∣tween two Men for a Week. Capt. <HI>Pember∣ton,</HI> of his Majesty's Land Forces, gave two Guineas for two Pounds of Flour; this Flour was sold him by the Seamen, who live on Mussels. Many of the People eat their Flour raw as soon as they are serv'd it. The Wind and Weather not per∣mitting us to go out, the Men were employ'd in getting Wood and Water.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 24th, This Morning, it being calm, row'd out; at Eight o'Clock had the supposed right <HI>Streights</HI> open, having a Breeze at W. N. W. S. E. by E. through the first reach, and S. S. E. through the second; then saw three Islands, the largest of which lies
<PB N="137" REF="007859_0169_102DDB96285F24E0"/>on the North-shore; and there is a Passage about two Miles broad between that and the Islands to the Southward; there is also ano∣ther Passage between that Island and the North-shore, of a Mile and a half broad. Before you come to those Islands there is a Sound lying on the South-shore: You can see no Sea-Passage until you come close up with the Island, and then the imaginary <HI>Streights</HI> are not above two Miles broad. Steer'd a∣way for the Island S. E. about two Leagues; then came into a narrow Passage, not a∣bove a Cable's Length over, which put us all to a stand, doubting of any farther Pas∣sage. The Wind took us a-head, and the Tide being spent, we put into a small Cove, and made fast. At Seven in the Evening, being calm, cast loose, being willing to see if there was any Opening; but, to our great Misfortune, found none; which very much surpriz'd us. The Lieutenant is of Opinion, that we are in a <HI>Lagoon</HI> to the Northward of the <HI>Streights.</HI> This I cannot believe; and am positive, if ever there was such a Place in the World as the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> we are now in them and above thirty Leagues up. If he, or any of the Officers, had given themselves the Trouble of coming upon Deck,
<PB N="138" REF="007859_0170_102DDB9831C55D10"/>to have made proper remarks, we had been free from all this Perplexity, and by this Time out of the <HI>Streights</HI> to the Northward. There is not an Officer aboard, except the Carpenter and myself, will keep the Deck a Moment longer than this Watch, or has any regard to a reckoning, or any Thing else. It is agreed to go back again.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 25th, Little Wind, with rain. At Eight this Morning row'd out, and got about a League down; here we could get no Ground, and were oblig'd to put back again.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 26th, Little Wind; row'd out, got about five Leagues down. This Day we were in such want of Provisions, that we were forc'd to cut up the Seal-Skin and boil it, notwithstanding it has lain about the Deck for this Fortnight.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 27th, Little Wind and close Weather. This Morning cast loose, and row'd down; had a fresh Breeze at North; steer'd W. S. W. up into another Opening on the South-Shore, hoping to find a Passage out of the <HI>Lagoon,</HI> as the Lieutenant calls it, into the right <HI>Streights.</HI> After going two Leagues up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw there was no Opening; put back, and made fast, where we came from; being
<PB N="139" REF="007859_0171_102DDB9B250737B0"/>determin'd to go back, and make Cape <HI>Pillar</HI> a second Time; which is the South Entrance of the <HI>Streights.</HI> Got abundance of large Mussels, five or six Inches long; a very great relief to us at present,</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 29th, Hard Gales from N. W. to S. W. with heavy rains. Great Uneasi∣ness among the People, many of them de∣spairing of a Deliverance, and crying aloud to serve Provisions four Days before the Time. Finding no Way to pacify them, we were oblig'd to serve them. We endeavour'd to encourage and comfort them as much as lay in our Power, and at length they seem'd tolerably easy.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 30th, Fresh Gales at W. with continual rain. This Day died three of our People, <HI>viz. Peter Delroy</HI> Barber, <HI>Thomas Thorpe</HI> and <HI>Thomas Woodhead,</HI> Marines; they all perish'd for want of Food: Several more are in the same Way, being not able to go ashore for Provisions; and those who are we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> can't get sufficient for themselves; therefore the Sick are left destitute of all relief. There is one thing to be taken Notice of in the Death of those People, that some Hours be∣fore they die, they are taken light-headed,
<PB N="140" REF="007859_0172_102DDB9CC1212388"/>and fall a joking and laughing; and in this Humour they expire.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, December</HI> the 1st, 1741, Little Wind, and fair Weather; which is a kind of Prodigy in those Parts. In the Morning put out of the Cove, and got four Leagues down; then the Wind took us ahead, and we put into another Cove, where we got Mussels and Limpets. At Four this Afternoon saw an <HI>Indian</HI> Canoe coming over from the North-shore; they landed two of their Men to Lee∣ward of the Cove; they came opposite to us, and view'd us; then went back, and came with the Canoe within a Cable's Length of our Boat, but no nearer; so that we had no Opportunity to truck with them.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 2d, Little Wind, with rain. At Nine this Morning row'd out, and got about a League farther down; the Wind be∣ginning to blow fresh, we put into another Cove, and found Plenty of Shell-fish, which kept up our Spirits greatly; for it is enough to deject any thinking Man, to see that the Boat will not turn to Windward; being of such Length, and swimming so poynant upon the Water, that the Wind, when close haul'd, throws her quite to Leeward: We have been seventeen Days going seven or eight Leagues
<PB N="141" REF="007859_0173_102DDB9E5A778B10"/>to Windward, which must make our Passage very long and uncomfortable.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 4th, Little Wind at S. and fair. This Morning row'd out; at Ten got down, where we saw a Smoak, but no People; we saw a Dog running along Shore, and keeping Company with the Boat for about a Mile: we then put in, with a Design to shoot him; but he soon disappointed us, by taking into the Woods. We put off again with a fine Breeze, steering N. W. by W. down the <HI>Streights.</HI> The Carpenter gave a Guinea this Day for a Pound of Flour, which he made into Cakes, and eat instantly. At Six in the Evening a-breast of Cape <HI>Monday;</HI> at Eight a-breast of Cape <HI>Upright,</HI> being fair Weather. Intend to keep under Sail all Night.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 5th, Little Wind, and fair. At four this Morning, I saw Cape <HI>Pillar,</HI> bearing W. by N. distant eight Leagues; saw a Smoak on the South Shore, and at Noon we saw a smoak on the North Shore, but we did not care to loose Time: At Three o'Clock saw Cape <HI>Desseada,</HI> bearing from Cape <HI>Pillar</HI> S. W. distant four Leagues; at Four o'Clock wore the Boat, and steered E. S. E. The Lieutenant was now fully con∣vinced
<PB N="142" REF="007859_0174_102DDBA0A99FAB90"/>we have been all along in the right <HI>Streights,</HI> and had we run but one League further, on <HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 17, we had escaped all this Trouble and Anxiety: As for my own Part, I was, very well assured, from the first Entrance, that we were right; but the Lieu∣tenant would not believe that it was Cape <HI>Pillar</HI> on the S. Shore coming into the <HI>Streights,</HI> but thought we were in a <HI>Lagoon</HI> to the Northward; so that we have been above a Fortnight coming back to rectify Mistakes, and to look at Cape <HI>Pillar</HI> a second Time: At Eight o'Clock came a-breast of the Smoak seen in the Morning. The People being well assured that we are actually in the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> are all alive. Wind at W. S. W.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> Little Wind at W. with rain: At Three this Morning a-breast of Cape <HI>Monday;</HI> at Six a-breast of Cape <HI>de Quad</HI> opposite to which, on the South-shore, saw a Smoak, on which, we went ashore to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who came out on a Point of Land, at the Entrance of a Cove, holoing, and crying, <HI>Bona! Bona!</HI> endeavouring to make us understand that they were our Friends; when ashore, we traded with them for two Dogs, three Brant Geese, and some Seal; which Supply was very acceptable to us; we supped on the Dogs, and thought them equal
<PB N="143" REF="007859_0175_102DDBA29CF77378"/>in Goodness to the best Mutton in <HI>England:</HI> We took from the <HI>Indians</HI> a Canoe, made of the Bark of Trees, but soon towed her under Water, and were obliged to cut her loose; steer'd N. E. by E. At Eight o'Clock a-a-breast of <HI>St. Jerom's Sound;</HI> at Twelve, a-breast of <HI>Royal Island.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> we saw in the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> are People of a middle Stature, and well-shaped; their Complexion of a tawney Olive Colour, their Hair exceeding black, but not very long; they have round Faces, and small Noses, their Eyes little and black; their Teeth are smooth and even, and close set, of an incomparable Whiteness; they are very active in Body, and run with a surprizing Agility; they wear on their Heads white feathered Caps; their Bodies are co∣vered with the Skins of Seals and Guianacoes: The Women, as soon as they saw us, fled into the Woods, so that we can give no Descrip∣tion of them.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 7th, Fresh Gales at W. N. W. and fine Weather; at Six this Morning a-breast of Cape <HI>Forward,</HI> steered N. by E. At Nine a-breast of <HI>Port Famen,</HI> at Twelve at Noon, put in at <HI>Freshwater-Bay,</HI> and filled one Cask of Water, having none aboard; at
<PB N="144" REF="007859_0176_102DDBA4DBDE6640"/>One o'Clock put out again, steer'd N. by E. expecting Plenty of Wood and Water at <HI>Eli∣zabeth's Island;</HI> at Nine at Night passed by <HI>Sandy Point;</HI> it bore S. S. E. and the Island <HI>St. George</HI> E. N. E. distant three Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 8th, At Four this Morning, being calm, weighed, and rowed towards <HI>Elizabeth's Island,</HI> it bearing W. N. W. At Four in the Afternoon anchor'd off the North∣mostside in eight Fathom Water, fine Sand, a∣bout half a Cable's Length from the Shore, put the Vessel in, and landed some People to see for Wood and Water: In the Evening the People came aboard, having been all over the Island in search of Wood and Water, but found none; here indeed we found Shaggs and Sea-Gulls in great Numbers, it being Breed∣ing Time; we got a vast Quantity of their Eggs, most of them having young ones in the Shell: However, we beat them up all together, with a little Flour, and made a very rich Pudding. <HI>Elizabeth's Island</HI> is a beautiful Spot of Ground to Appearance, with very good Pasture; but it is intirely barren of any thing for the Support of Man. This Day <HI>John Turner,</HI> Marine, perished for want of Food.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="007859_0177_102DDBA6877D6F48"/>
<HI>Wednesday</HI> the 9th, At Four this Morning weighed, and steered E. N. E. for the <HI>Nar∣rows,</HI> with the Wind at S. S. W. when a-breast of the <HI>Sweepstakes-Foreland,</HI> steered S. S. E. on Purpose to look for Water; after going along shore about fix Leagues, into a deep Bay, we saw a fine delightful Country: Here we saw the Guianacoes in great Num∣bers, ten or twelve in a Drove; they are to be seen in such Droves all along the Shore for several Leagues.</P>
<P>The Guianacoe is as large as any <HI>English</HI> Deer, with a long Neck; his Head, Mouth, and Ears, resembling a Sheep; he has very long slender Legs, and is cloven-footed like a Deer, with a short Bushy Tail, of a reddish Colour; his Back is covered with red Wool, pretty long; but down his Sides, and all the Belly Part, is white Wool: Those Guianacoes, though, at a Distance, very much resembling the Female Deer, are probably the Sheep of this Country: They are exceeding nimble, of an exquisite quick Sight, very shy, and difficult to be shot; at Noon, finding neither Wood nor Water, wore to the Northward: At Three got a-breast of the <HI>Foreland,</HI> hauled in for <HI>Fish Cove,</HI> which lieth just round the Eastern Point; here we expected to land, and
<PB N="146" REF="007859_0178_102DDBA835C05870"/>shoot some of those Guianacoes; but when a-breast of the <HI>Cove,</HI> the Wind blew so hard right out, that we were obliged to bear a∣way for the first <HI>Narrow,</HI> it being impossible to get in. At Eight this Evening entered the first <HI>Narrow,</HI> meeting the Flood, which runs here very strong: At Twelve came to an Anchor in five Fathom, about a Mile off Shore: The Tide floweth on the Western Shore seven Hours, and ebbs five. This Day <HI>Robert Vicars</HI> Marine perished with Want.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 10th, At Four this Morning weighed, and came to sail; at six got out of the first <HI>Narrow,</HI> hauled in for a deep Bay on the N. shore to seek for Water: The Boatswain swam ashore, and in half an Hour afterwards came down on the Beach, and brought us the News of finding fresh Water: It being rocky Ground, and ebbing Water, the Vessel struck; we were oblig'd, in this Exigence, to slip the Cable, Time not per∣mitting us to haul up the Anchor; we stood off and on the Shore till half Flood; then went in, and took the Cable on Board: After landing some People with Casks to fill, haul'd the Anchor up, and went about two Miles farther out.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="007859_0179_102DDBAA791ACA28"/>
<HI>Friday</HI> the 11th, At Three this Morning the Boat struck upon the Tide of Ebb; it ebbing so fast, we could not get her off; in a Quarter of an Hour's Time the Boat was dry; we were favour'd with little Wind and smooth Water, otherwise she must have stove to Pieces, the Ground being very foul; it ebbs dry above a League off, and there is Shoal Water a great deal further out; so that it is dangerous for a Ship to haul into this Bay. While the Boat was dry, got all the Water-Casks out of the Hold, and put them ashore to be fill'd. At six haul'd the Boat off, ha∣ving receiv'd no Damage; at Eight, it being four Feet Flood, run the Boat close in Shore, and took off our Water, the whole Quantity being four Tons, out of which we were oblig'd to leave two Puncheons, one Quarter-Cask, with three Muskets, a Funnel, and some other Necessaries; and were very much concern'd, lest we should also leave some of the People ashore. The Wind blowing hard, and the Sea tumbling in, we were under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Necessity of hauling off, and putting to Sea, for fear of losing the Boat. Since we left the Island where the <HI>Wager</HI> was lost, we have several Times very narrowly escap'd being made a Wreck, and some Times have been
<PB N="148" REF="007859_0180_102DDBACE1FE31B8"/>preserv'd when we have seen our Fate before our Eyes, and every Moment expected it, and when all the Conduct and Ability of Men could have avail'd nothing. Any one, who has been a Witness of those Providential Deliverances, and doubts the being of a Su∣preme Power, disqualifies himself from any Title to all future Mercy, and justly deserves the Wrath of an incens'd Deity. This Day, at Noon, being well out of the Bay, and nigh Mid-channel over, steer'd E. N. E. for Cape <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> with a fine Gale at <HI>S. W.</HI> At One we saw the Cape bearing N. E. by E. distant nine Leagues; at seven in the Evening saw a low Point of flat Land, stretching away from the Cape <HI>S. S. E.</HI> two Leagues; at Eight, little or no Wind, steer'd <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> at Twelve at Night doubled the Point, the Wind at <HI>W.</HI> right in the Middle of the Bay, where we fill'd the Water; in Land lie two Peaks, exactly like Asses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. We would advise all Vessels from hauling into this Bay, it be∣ing shoal Water and foul Ground. As for every other Part of the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> from Cape <HI>Victory</HI> to Cape <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> we recommend Sir <HI>John Narborough,</HI> who in his Account is so just and exact, that we think it is impossible for any Man living to mend his
<PB N="149" REF="007859_0181_102DDBAE9936F8A8"/>Works. We have been a Month in those <HI>Streights,</HI> from our first sight of Cape <HI>Pillar</HI> to Cape <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI> The whole Length of the <HI>Streights,</HI> the reaches and turnings included, is reckon'd one hundred and sixteen Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 12th Little Wind, and fair weather. At one this Morning steer'd <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> At Four the Wind came to <HI>N. W.</HI> Tack'd and stood to the Westward; the two Points stretching off from the Cape bore <HI>N. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> distant two Leagues. At Noon, the Wind being at <HI>N. E.</HI> steering along Shore from the Cape, saw on Shore three Men, on Mules or Horses, riding towards us; when they came a-breast of us, they stopp'd, and made Signals, waving their Hats, as tho' they wanted to speak with us; at which we edg'd close to the Shore, where we saw to the Number of twenty; five of them rode a-breast, the others were on Foot, having a large Store of Cattle with them. On Sight of this, we anchor'd within a Mile of the Shore. The Cape bore <HI>W. S. W.</HI> distant seven Leagues; the Swell tumbling in from the Sea, would not permit us to speak with 'em; by their Motions, Actions, Cloathing, and, by their whole Behaviour, we took them for
<PB N="150" REF="007859_0182_102DDBB04A2D25F8"/>Christians: It being a plain level Land, they rode backwards and forwards like racers, waving white Hankerchiefs, and making Signs for us to go into a Bay, which lay about a League to the Northward; which we de∣sign'd to do on the Tide of Ebb. The Flood being very strong against us, they waited on the Shore till the Tide was spent; we weigh'd and stood to Northward; the Wind blowing right in from the Sea, and a great swell, we could not clear the Land; so that we wore and stood to the Southward, and very nar∣rowly escap'd clearing the Breakers off the Pitch of the Cape, which lay about two Leagues out at Sea to the Southward. At Nine at Night the Cape bore W. distant six Leagues; stood out to Sea till Eleven o'Clock, then wore and stood in, the Wind shifting to N. N. E. The next Morning we steer'd in for the Bay, and saw those People again; but the Wind soon afterwards veering to the Westward, and blowing strong, we were oblig'd to bear away: We could not by any Means come to the Knowledge of these Peo∣ple; whether they are unfortunate Creatures that have been cast away, or whether they are Inhabitants about the river <HI>Gallegoes,</HI> we can't tell.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="007859_0183_102DDBB29C735728"/>
<HI>Tuesday</HI> the 15th, Fresh Gales, and fair Weather. This Morning saw the Land; the Southmost Point bore W. S. W. the North∣most Point N. N. E. At Eight saw two Ledges of rocks, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nning two Leagues out from a Point of Land which makes like an old Castle. At Noon the Extreams of the Land bore W. by N. distant three Leagues; had a good Observation, Latitude 49: 10 S. Course made this twenty-four Hours is N. by E. half E. distant 104 Miles, Longitude in 74: 05 W.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 16th, At Noon a-breast of <HI>Penguin</HI> Island, not above half a Mile from Shore. We saw on this Island Seals and Pen∣guins without Number, the Shore being en∣tirely cover'd with them. We find the Pen∣guin exactly to answer Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Description; therefore we beg Leave to give it the reader in that excellent Navigator's own Word. <Q><HI>The Penguin is a Fowl that lives by catching and eating of Fish, which he dives for, and is very nimble in the Water; he is as big as a Brant-Goose, and weighs near about eight Pounds; they have no Wings, but flat Stumps like Fins; their Coat is a downy slumped Feather; they are blackish Grey on the Backs and
<PB N="152" REF="007859_0184_102DDBB532D8C4F8"/>Heads, and White about their Necks and down their Bellies; they are short-legg'd like a Goose, and stand upright like little Children in white Aprons, in Companies to∣gether; they are full-neck'd, and headed and beaked like a Crow, only the Point of their Bill turns down a little; they will bite hard, but they are very tame, and will drive in Herds to your Boat-side like Sheep, and there you may knock 'em on the Head, all one after another; they will not make any great Haste away.</HI></Q> We steer'd N. W. by N. for the Harbour of Port <HI>Desire:</HI> The going into this Harbour is very remarkable; on the South-side lies, one Mile in the Land, an high peak'd-up rock, much like a Tower, looking as tho' it was a Work of Art set up for a Land-mark to steer into this Harbour; this rock is forty Feet high. At Five o'Clock got into the Harbour; run up to <HI>Seal</HI> Island, which lieth about a League up; here we kill'd more Seal in half an Hour, than we could carry off, being oblig'd to leave the greatest Part of what we kill'd behind. The People eating greedily of the Seal, were seiz'd with violent Feavers and Pains in their Heads. While we were at Port <HI>Desire</HI> we had Seal and Fowl in Abundance. The Car∣penter
<PB N="153" REF="007859_0185_102DDBB6D1789090"/>found here a Parcel of Bricks, some of 'em with Letters cut in them; on one of those Bricks these Words were very plain and legible, <HI>viz. Capt. Straiton,</HI> 16 <HI>Cannons,</HI> 1687. Those we imagine have been laid here from a Wreck. The Carpenter with six Men went in Search of Water; a Mile up the Water's Side they found <HI>Peckett's</HI> Well, mention'd in Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Book; the Spring is so small, that it doth not give above thirty Gallons <HI>per</HI> Day; but the Well being full, supplied us. The People grow very turbu∣lent and uneasy, requiring Flour to be serv'd out; which, in our present Circumstances, is a most unreasonable request; we have but one Cask of Flour on Board, and a great Distance to run into the <HI>Brazil,</HI> and no other Provision in the Boat but the Seal we have kill'd here: Nay, they carry their Demands much higher, insisting that the Marine Officers, and such People as cannot be assisting in working the Boat, shall have but half the Allowance of the rest; accordingly they have pitch'd upon twenty to be serv'd half a Pound of Flour each Man, and themselves a Pound. This Distinction the Half-Pounders complain of, and that twenty are selected to be starv'd. While we were at Port <HI>Desire,</HI> one Day dres∣sing
<PB N="154" REF="007859_0186_102DC6FC96A55530"/>our Victuals we set Fire to the Grass; instantly the Flames spread, and immediately we saw the whole Country in a Conflagra∣tion; and the next Day, from the Watering∣place, we saw the Smoak at a Distance; so that then the Fire was not extinguish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 25th, Little Wind, and fair Weather, went up to our Slaughter-House in <HI>Seal</HI> Island, and took on Board our Sea-store, which we compleated in half an Hour's Time; turn'd down the Harbour with the Tide of Ebb; in the Evening, the Wind at N. E. could make no Hand of it; so bore away for the Harbour again, and came to an Anchor.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 26th, at Three in the Morn∣ing sail'd out of Port <HI>Desire</HI> Harbour; steer'd out E. N. E. At six <HI>Penguin</HI> Island bore S. by E. distant six Leagues, and Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> N. W. by N. four Leagues. This Day I took my Departure from Cape <HI>Blanco;</HI> I judge the Cape to lie in the Longitude of 71.00 W. from the Meridian of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 28th, Moderate Gales, and fair. This Day serv'd out all the Flour in the Boat, at three Pound and half each Man. We have nothing now to live on but Seal, and what Providence throws in our Way.</P>

<HI>Friday, January</HI> the 1st, 1741-2. Fresh Gales, and fair Weather, with a great Sea. At Ten last Night shifting the Man at Helm, brought her by the Lee, broke the Boom, and lost a Seaman over-board. The greatest Part of our Seal taken in at Port <HI>Desire,</HI> for want of Salt to cure it there, now stinks very much; but having nothing else, we are oblig'd to eat it. We are now miserable be∣yond Description, having nothing to feed on ourselves, and at the same Time almost eaten up with Vermin.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 6th, Departed this Life Mr. <HI>Thomas Harvey,</HI> the Purser; he died a Skele∣ton for want of Food: This Gentleman pro∣bably was the first Purser belonging to his Majesty's Service, that ever perish'd with Hunger. We see daily a great Number of Whales.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 10th, This Day at Noon, in working the Bearings and Distance to Cape <HI>St. Andrew,</HI> do find myself not above thir∣teen Leagues distant from the Land; there fore haul'd in N.W. to make it before Night. We saw To-day Abundance of Infects, par∣ticularly Butterflies and Horse-stingers. We have nothing to eat but some stinking Seal, and not above twenty out of forty-three which
<PB N="156" REF="007859_0188_102DDBBC934D0A40"/>are now alive have even that; and such hath been our Condition for this Week past; nor are we better off in regard to Water, there not being above eighty Gallons aboard: Never were beheld a Parcel of more miser∣able Objects; there are not above fifteen of us healthy (if People may be call'd healthy that are scarce able to crawl.) I am reckon'd at present one of the strongest Men in the Boat, yet can hardly stand on my Legs ten Minutes together, nor even that short Space of Time without holding: Every Man of us hath had a new Coat of Skin from Head to Foot: We that are in the best State of Health, do all we can to encourage the rest. At Four this Afternoon we were almost transported with Joy at the Sight of Land (having seen no Land for fourteen Days before) the Ex∣treams of which bore <HI>N. W.</HI> about seven Leagues; we ran in with it, and at Eight anchor'd in eight Fathom; fine Sand about a League from the Shore; the Northmost Point bore about <HI>N. E.</HI> the Southmost Point about <HI>S. W.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> This Day perish'd for want of Food Serjeant <HI>Ringall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 11th, At Four this Morning weigh'd, and came to sail, steering along <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hore <HI>N. E.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> This is a pleasant and de∣lightful
<PB N="157" REF="007859_0189_102DDBBF96D09B50"/>Country to sail by; we kept within a Mile of the Shore; we saw Horses and large Dogs in great Numbers, the Shore be∣ing perfectly cover'd with them. At Noon I had a good Observation in the Latitude of 38:40 <HI>S.</HI> At the same Time saw a-head Land which I take for Cape <HI>St. Andrew's;</HI> it is a long sandy Point, very low, where a Shoal runs off <HI>S. E.</HI> about three Leagues. Sounded, and had but two Fathom and half at High-water. When we got clear of this, we steer'd <HI>N. E.</HI> into a sandy Bay, and an∣chor'd there in three Fathom and half, fine Sand; the North Point bore <HI>N. N. W.</HI> the South Point <HI>S. E.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> Here is a great Swell, and shoal-water. This Bay we call <HI>Shoalwater Bay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 12th, Lying in <HI>Shoalwater Bay,</HI> the Wind at <HI>S. E.</HI> and fair Weather. Having nothing on Board the Vessel to eat, and but one Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Water to drink, we put her in as nigh as we could venture; so that any Per∣son, who had the least skill in swimming, might get ashore: Here runs a pretty large Surf, which may endanger our Vessel; this puts us to a Stand: To go from hence with∣out Meat or Drink is certain Death. A few of the healthiest were resolv'd to swim on
<PB N="158" REF="007859_0190_102DDBC12F6F6EC0"/>Shore, to get Water and Provisions; the Of∣ficers, <HI>viz.</HI> the Boatswain, Carpenter and Lieutenant <HI>Ewers,</HI> to animate the rest, first leap'd into the Water; eleven of the People follow'd them; in this Attempt one of the Ma∣rines was unfortunately drown'd: We toss'd over-board four Quarter-Casks to fill with Water: lashing to the Casks two Fire-locks on each Side, with Ammunition for shooting. When the Officers and People got on Shore, they saw Thousands of Horses and Dogs; the Dogs are of a mongrel Breed and very large. They also saw Abundance of Parrots and Seals on the rocks, but not a Bush grow∣ing on the Place; they made a Fire with Horse-dung, and shot a great many Seal, which they cut up in Quarters to bring a∣board. One of the Water-Casks being leaky, they cut it up and converted it into Fuel to dress the Seal. They caught four Armadilloes, they are much larger than our Hedge-Hogs, and very like them; their Bodies are cased all over with Shells, shutting under one ano∣ther like Shells of Armour. In this Country thirteen of his Majesty's <HI>British</HI> Subjects put to Flight a thousand <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse. Horses are more Numerous here than Sheep are on the Plains in <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire.</HI> We on
<PB N="159" REF="007859_0191_102DDBC32384CDD0"/>Board see Abundance of Seal lying on the Shore cut up in Pieces; but the Wind blows so hard we can by no Means get at it. We think ourselves now worse off than ever, for we are actually starving in the Sight of Plenty. We have but two People on board that can swim; to give them all the Assistance we can the Lieutenant and myself with the rest of the People, proposed to haul the Vessel nearer in, and make a raft for one of the two to swim ashore on, and to carry a Line to haul some of the Seal a-board: With much Entreaty these two Swimmers were prevail'd on to cast Lots; the Lot falling on the weakest of 'em, who was a young Lad about fifteen Years of Age, and searce able to stand, we would not suffer him to go. While our Bre∣thren were regaling in the fulness of Plenty ashore, we aboard were oblig'd to strip the Hatches of a Seal-skin, which has been for some Time nail'd on, and made use of for a Tarpawlin; we burnt the Hair off the Skin, and for want of any Thing else fell to chew∣ing the Seal-skin.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 13th, Fine Weather, and calm. At Six this Morning the Boatswain shot a Horse, and the People a wild Dog. The Horse was branded on the Lest Buttock with these Letters AR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> By this we conjec∣ture
<PB N="160" REF="007859_0192_102DDBC56728DF30"/>there are Inhabitants not far off. At Nine veer'd the Boat in, lash'd the Oar's to the Hatches, and made a Stage to haul up the Seal. The People swam off three Casks of Water; sent on Shore one Quarter-Cask more, and two Breakers. Came aboard the Boatswain, Carpenter, and Lieutenant <HI>Ewers;</HI> and four Men more are getting the Seal and the Horse on Board; which was no sooner in the Vessel, than a Sea-Breeze came in, and blow'd so hard, that we were oblig'd to weigh; leaving ashore one Quarter-Cask, two Breakers, and Eight of the People. The Wind at E. S. E. and a tumbling Sea, came to an Anchor about a League off the Shore; we shar'd the Provisions among the Com∣pany; we still see the People ashore, but can't get them off.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 14th, Hard Gales at E. S. E. and fair Weather. Last Night the Sea was so great, that it broke the rudder Head off; we were doubtful every Moment of the Ves∣sel's parting, which if she had, we must have been all of us inevitably lost. We were oblig'd to put to Sea, not being able to get the People off. We sent ashore in a scuttled Puncheon some wearing Apparel, four Muskets, with Balls, Powder, Flints, Candles, and several Necessaries; and also a Letter to acquaint
<PB N="161" REF="007859_0193_102DDBC705DB8EB8"/>them of the Danger we were in, and of the Impossibility of our riding it out till they could get off.</P>

<P>THESE are to certify the Right Ho∣nourable the Lords Commissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of Great-Britain, &amp;c. That we, whose Names are under-mention'd, having nothing left on Board the Vessel but one Quarter-Cask of Wa∣ter, were oblig'd to put into the first Place we could for Subsistence, which was in Fresh∣water Bay; where we came to an Anchor, as near the Shore as we could, without endan∣gering the Vessel, having no Boat aboard, and a large Surf on the Shore; therefore Mr.<HI> King </HI>the Boatswain, Mr.<HI> Cummins </HI>the Carpenter, and Lieutenant<HI> Ewers, </HI>with eleven of the People, jump'd over-board, in order to swin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ashore, with three Casks for Water; in which Attempt<HI> James Greenham </HI>was drown'd in the Surf, off the Shore: The Sea-Breeze coming
<PB N="162" REF="007859_0194_102DDBC8D43C4088"/>on, prevented the People getting on Board the same Night; therefore, on<HI> Wednesday </HI>Morning, it being then calm, they brought to the Beach the Casks fill'd with Water, with Seal and other Provisions in great Quan∣tities, which we haul'd on Board. The Boat∣swain, Carpenter, Lieut.<HI> Ewers, </HI>and three of the People swam off; but the Sea-breeze coming in, and the Surf rising, the rest were discourag'd from coming off; we haul'd a good Birth off the Shore, where we lay the Remainder of the Day, and all the Night. The Greatness of the Sea broke off our Rud∣der-Head, and we expected every Minute the Vessel would founder at her Anchor.<HI> Thursday </HI>Morning we saw no Probability of the People coming aboard, and the Wind coming out of the Sea, and not one Stick of Fire-wood in the Vessel to dress our Victuals, and it being every Man's Opinion that we must put to Sea or perish, we got up a scuttled Cask, and put into it all Manner of Necessaries, with four small Arms lash'd to the Cask, and a Letter to acquaint them of our Danger; which Cask we saw them re∣ceive, as also the Letter that was in it; they then fell on their Knees, and made Sig∣nals wishing us well; at which we got under

<P>Those People had a good Prospect of get∣ing Provisions, and we believe Inhabitants are not far off: they have all Necessaries for
<PB N="164" REF="007859_0196_102DDBCD11F8EFD8"/>shooting; we hope to set them again, but at present we leave 'em to the Care of Provi∣dence and the wide World. At Noon sail'd hence; at Four in the Afternoon could not clear the Land, and were oblig'd to anchor in five Fathom, two Leagues from the Shore; the Northmost Point of Land bore N. E. by N. and the Southmost Point S. by W. Hard Gales at E. N. E. and a great Sea. At Noon Latitude in 38: 00 S.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 15th, Fresh Gales at N. N. W. and a great Sea tumbling into the Bay. We are not able to ride it out; therefore, at Four in the Afternoon, got under sail, and stood off to Sea; the Southmost Land bore S. W. by S. distant five Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 18th, In the Latitude of 36: 29 S. the North Point of <HI>Fresh-water Bay</HI> bearing S. W. distant forty-four Leagues, we went to an Allowance of Water, at a Pint a Man <HI>per</HI> Day, having on Board not above twenty Gallons for thirty-three Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 19th, Little Wind at S. and clear Weather. At Four this Morning saw Breakers right a-head; sounded, and found five Fathom; saw the Land making like an Island, bearing N. E. by E. distant twelve Leagues; steer'd N. for about a Mile or
<PB N="165" REF="007859_0197_102DDBCF02CD9EF0"/>two; shoal'd the Water from two Fathom to nine Feet; then steer'd N. N. E. and deepen'd the Water to five Fathom. By the Appear∣ance of the Land, we are well up the river of <HI>Plate,</HI> and do take the Breakers for the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Bank. Steer'd and sail'd all Day E. N. E. along Shore; in the Evening anchor'd in a fine sandy Bay; saw two Men coming down on Horseback; the Boatswain swam ashore, and got up behind one of them, and rode away to their Caravans. When we made the Land, we had not one Drop of Water on Board: Several People swam ashore to fill Water; one of 'em, when ashore, drank very plentifully of Water; in attempting to come off, was so weak, that he could not reach the Vessel, but was unfortunately drown'd. Got one Cask of Water aboard, which reviv'd us exceedingly.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 20th, Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and my∣self went ashore; four of the Inhabitants came down to us on Horseback. As I could talk <HI>Portugueze,</HI> I fell into Discourse with them. They told me the <HI>English</HI> were still at War with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> that they had two fifty Gun Ships up the river of <HI>Plate,</HI> and one sixty Gun Ship cruizing off Cape <HI>St. Mary's;</HI> and not above six Weeks ago a
<PB N="166" REF="007859_0198_102DDBD0ADCC7108"/>seventy Gun Ship lying at Anchor, parted from her Anchors and drove on shore; that the Ship was lost, and every Man perish'd. They also told me they were <HI>Spaniards, Cas∣tilians,</HI> and Fishermen; that they came here a fishing; the Fish they took they salted and dried, then sold them at <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> The Town they belong'd to they call'd the <HI>Mount de Vidia,</HI> two Days Journey from hence. I ask'd them how they came to live in the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Land. They said there were a great many <HI>Spanish</HI> Settlements on this side, and gave us an Invitation to their Caravan. We got up behind them, and rode about a Mile to it; where they entertain'd us with good Jurk-Beef, roasted and boil'd, with good white Bread. We sought to buy some Provisions of them; but they had none but twenty-six Loaves, about as big <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Two-Penny Loaves in <HI>England;</HI> which they would not part with under four Guinea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. We be∣ing in a weak Condition, sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able to stand on our Legs, and without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ead for a long Time, gave them their Price. Their Patroon told us at the same Time, if it should be known that they had supplied us, they should be all hang'd. He promis'd, if we would give him a Firelock, he would get us some
<PB N="167" REF="007859_0199_102DDBD34AC0F5D0"/>wild Fowl, and as many Ducks in an Hour or two as would serve all the People aboard. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> sent for his Firelock, and gave it him, with some Powder and Sluggs. On our coming away, finding one of their Com∣pany missing with a Horse, we were appre∣hensive of his being gone to betray us; there∣fore immediately went on Board, got our Water in, and made all ready for sailing to the <HI>Rio Grand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 21st, little Wind at N. W. and fair Weather. At four this Morning got under Sail; steer'd E. N. E. At Twelve saw low Land stretch off to the Eastward, which bore E. by S. At Four the Tide of Flood flowing strong in oblig'd us to come to an Anchor in a large Bay, in eight Fathom Water; the South Point bore S. S. W. the East Point E. S. E. at Eight at Night got under Sail, steering E. S. E.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 22d, Little Wind at N. and fair Weather. At Eight this Morning saw Cape <HI>St. Mary's,</HI> bearing N. W. distant ten Leagues; at Noon it bore W. S. W. and the North Land S. E. by E.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 23d, Little Wind, and calm. In the Morning, not seeing the Land, steer'd in N. at Noon saw Cape <HI>St. Mary's,</HI> bear∣ing N. W. distant ten Leagues; Latitude <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="007859_0200_102DDC9899F6A310"/>Observation 34: 53 S. At Seven in the Even∣ing, being in Shore, and calm, anchored in fourteen Fathom Water, sandy Ground; the Cape bearing W. by N. and the Northmost Land N. by E. This Day departed this Life Mr. <HI>Thomas Clark</HI> the Master; as did also his Son the Day following.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 24th, The Wind at S. and hazy Weather. At Two in the Morning weighed and came to sail; steering N. E. within a League of the Shore. At Three in the After∣noon saw three Islands; the Northmost of which is the most remarkable one I ever be∣held, appearing like a Church with a lofty Tower; at Four we saw three Islands more, steer'd N. Quarter W. between those Islands, until we saw the main Land. The most re∣markable of these Islands is about four Miles from the Main: They are all steep. At Eight anchor'd in fourteen Fathom, fine Sand.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 25th, A fresh Gale at E. N. E. a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cloudy Weather. At Nine this Morning got under Sail, in Order to go back to those Islands to get some Seal, there being great Numbers on the rocks, and we in great want of Provision, with the Wind against us. We took the Opportunity of the Wind back to the Islands, but were disappointed, being
<PB N="169" REF="007859_0201_102DC70AC224E3A0"/>not able to get ashore for Provisions, came to an Anchor in fourteen Fathom, sandy Ground. Hard Gales at N. N. E. with Thunder, Lightning and rain all Night.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 26th, This Morning moderate Gales at N. W. and fair Weather, got under Sail; after clear of the Islands, steer'd N.E. by N. keeping along Shore; it is a fine level Land, and regular Soundings fifteen Fa∣thom, five Leagues off the Land. We have no Seal, nor any other kind of Food on Board. We have a fair Wind, and not far from our de∣sir'd Port: so that we are in pretty good Spirits. This Day died the oldest Man belonging to us, <HI>Thomas Maclean,</HI> Cook, aged 82 Years.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 27th, Moderate Gales at W. steer'd N. and sail'd all Day within a Ca∣ble's length of the Shore in three Fathom Water. We have now nothing but a lit∣tle Water to support Nature. At Noon had an Observation, Latitude in 32: 40 South: I reckon myself 18 Leagues from the <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and hope to see it in the Morning.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 28th, Kept she Shore close a-board, and sounded every half Hour, not caring to go within three Fathom, nor keep without five, sailing along by the Lead all Night. At Six in the Morning saw the
<PB N="170" REF="007859_0202_102DC71319BDB4D8"/>Opening of the river <HI>Grand;</HI> kept with∣in the Breakers of the Bar, having at some∣times not above seven Feet Water at half Flood; steer'd N.E. by E. until the river's Mouth was fairly open; then steer'd N. and N. N. W. until a-breast of the Town; an∣chor'd on the East-shore in two Fathom Wa∣ter. There presently came a Boat from the Shore, with a Serjeant of the Army, and one Soldier. The Lieutenant, myself, and Mr. <HI>Gummins,</HI> with Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> of the Land Forces, went on Shore with them. The Commandant, the Officers, and People of the Place, receiv'd us in a most tender and friend∣ly Manner. They instantly sent on Board to the People four Quarters of Beef, and two Bags of <HI>Farine</HI> Bread. We were conducted to the Surgeon's House, the handsomest Ha∣bitation in the Place; where we were most hospitably entertain'd. At Four in the After∣noon the Governor came to Town; after a strict Enquiry into our Misfortunes, and the reasons of our coming into this Port, being somewhat doubtful that we might be Inspec∣tors of their Coast, he began to examine me, the Lieutenant having reported me to him as Pilot. He ask'd me if there was a Chart of the Coast on Board; and, if not, how it was
<PB N="171" REF="007859_0203_102DC7456F9AC098"/>possible we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld hit the Bar, and venture into so hazardous a Place as this is? I told him, as for a Chart, we had none of any kind; but I had a good Observation the Day before, that our Vessel drew but a small Draught of Water; that we kept the Lead always going, and in the Necessity we were in, we were oblig'd, at all Events, to ven∣ture; and if we had not seen the Opening of the river before Night, we must have been compell'd to run the Vessel ashore. He ex∣amin'd me also concerning the Places we stopt at, from Cape <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> to this Port, and more particularly relating to the river <HI>Plate.</HI> He was very nice in his Enquiry of our put∣ting in at Cape St. <HI>Mary's,</HI> and of the Bear∣ings and Distance along Shore from thence to this Port. When he throughly satisfy'd him∣self, he embraced us, and blest himself to think of our Deliverance, which he term'd a Miracle. He offer'd every Thing the Coun∣try could afford to our relief; the Sick were order'd to be taken Care of in the Hospital. He took the Lieutenant and the Land Offi∣cers home with him; and desired the Com∣mandant to see that the rest of the Officers and People wanted for nothing. Before he went he inform'd us, that his Majesty's Ships
<PB N="172" REF="007859_0204_102DDBD5346698B8"/>the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl</HI> were at <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> in great Distress; that they had sent to <HI>England</HI> for Men, and could not sail from thence until the Arrival of the <HI>Flota,</HI> which would be in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June.</HI> He also told us, that we should be dispatch'd in the first Vessel which arriv'd in this Port; for he did not think we could with Safety go any farther in our own; and that there could not be found twelve Seamen in the <HI>Brazils</HI> that would venture over the Bar in her to sail to <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> therefore he order'd our little <HI>Speedwell</HI> ashore; this Wonder the People are continually flocking to see: and it is now about nine Months since we were cast away in the <HI>Wager;</HI> in which Time, I believe, no Mortals have experienc'd more Difficulties and Miseries than we have. This Day may be justly stiled the Day of our Deliverance, and ought to be remember'd ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 31st, Little or nothing remark∣able since the Day we came in, only a won∣derful Change in our Diet; we live on the best the Country can produce, and have Plenty of every Thing. This Afternoon the Governor, Commandant, and Commissary, came on Board, to see our little <HI>Speedwell;</HI> they were surpriz'd that thirty Souls, the
<PB N="173" REF="007859_0205_102DDBD6DDE2AE38"/>Number of People now living, could be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow'd in so small a Vessel; but that she could contain the Number which first embark'd with us, was to them amazing, and beyond all Belief: They could not conceive how the Man at Helm could steer without falling over-board, there not being above four Inches rise from the Deck. I told them he sat down, and clap'd his Feet against the rise; and show'd them in what Manner we secured ourselves. The Governor, after viewing the Vessel over, told us, we were more welcome to him in the miserable Condition we arriv'd, than if we had brought all the Wealth in the World with us. At the same Time he fully assur'd us, we should be supply'd with every Thing that the Country could afford; that he would dispatch us the first Opportunity to <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> and whenever we stood in Need of any Thing, he order'd us to acquaint the Commandant, and our Wants should be in∣stantly supply'd. He then took Leave of us, and wish'd us well. All the Deference and dutiful respect we could show him, to ex∣press a grateful Sense of his Favour, was by manning the Vessel, and giving him three Cheers. The next Day arriv'd at this Place the Brigadier-Governor of the Island St. <HI>Ca∣tharine;</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="007859_0206_102DDBD89AD36A98"/>he came close by our Vessel, we mann'd her, and gave him three Cheers. The Soldiers of the Garrison, having twenty Months Arrears due to them, expected the Brigadier was come to pay them; but when they found themselves disappointed, they made a great Disturbance among themselves. I apply'd to the Commandant for a House, the Vessel, in rainy Weather, not being fit to lie in; he order'd me one joining to his own, and gave me the Key. I took with me Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Snow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Oakley,</HI> and the Cooper; we brought our trifling Necessaries on Shore, and remov'd to our new Habitation: Here we were dry and warm; and tho' we had no Bedding, we lodg'd very comfortably. Since the Loss of the <HI>Wager,</HI> we have been used to lie hard; at present we think ourselves very happily fix'd, and heartily wish that all the Persons who surviv'd the Loss of the Ship were in so good a Situation as ourselves.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, February</HI> the 2d, 1741-2, Great Murmurings among the Soldiers; they de∣tain'd the Brigadier from going back as he intended this Morning, till he promis'd to dispatch the Money, Cloaths, and Provisions, and to see their Grievances adjusted. On
<PB N="175" REF="007859_0207_102DDBDB4F9C8178"/>those Terms they have agreed he shall go; and this Evening he return'd for St. <HI>Catha∣rine</HI>'s. We apprehended, till now, that the right Officers were in Place; but we find ourselves mistaken. Some Time before we arrived here, there was an Insurrection among the Soldiers: Their Design was against the Governor; but by his Address, and fair Pro∣mises of seeing them righted, he diverted the Storm from himself, and got himself conti∣nued in his Station; as were also the Major and Commissary. The Soldiers dismiss'd the rest of the Officers, and supply'd their Places with their own People, tho' they were lately private Men; they appear'd very grand, and were not distinguish'd in Dress from the pro∣per Officers. The Disturbance at <HI>Rio Grand</HI> is of no Service to us, for we feel the Effects of it; our Allowance is now so small that it will hardly support Nature; the People have been without <HI>Farina,</HI> which is their Bread, for some Days past. We apply'd to the Go∣vernor, who promis'd to supply us the next Day; accordingly we went for a Supply, which created fresh Murmurings among the Soldiers; however we got a small Quantity of Bread to supply us for ten Days. The Store-keeper show'd me all the Provisions,
<PB N="176" REF="007859_0208_102DDBDD3A8BA008"/>which, considering there were a thousand to draw their Subsistence from it, was a small Stock indeed, and not above six Weeks at the present Allowance. He told me we were serv'd equally with the Soldiers; and when more Stores came, which they shortly ex∣pected, our Allowance should be encreas'd. I think, in reason, this is as much as we can expect. The Lieutenant not coming nigh us since our first landing, I went with the Peo∣ple up to him at the Governor's, about two Miles from this Port, to endeavour to pre∣vail with him to get us dispatch'd, acquaint∣ing him of the Call and Necessity there was for our Assistance on Board the two distress'd Ships at <HI>Rio Janeiro.</HI> He said he had spoke to the Governor, and could not get us dis∣patch'd till another Vessel came in. I told him, as the Garrison were in want of Pro∣visions, what we were living on here, would carry us off; and if any Misfortune should attend the Vessel expected in with the Provi∣sions, we should be put very hard to it for a Subsistence. He promis'd to acquaint the Governor; on which I took my Leave.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> the 17th, This Evening came into this Garrison three Seamen, giving an Account of their belonging to a Vessel with
<PB N="177" REF="007859_0209_102DDBDF30B60050"/>Provisions and Stores for this Place, from <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> that they had been from thence three Months, and had been off the Bar waiting an Opportunity to come in; that not having any fresh Water aboard, they were oblig'd to come to an Anchor ten Leagues to the Southward of this Port; that a Canoe was sent with those three Men to fill the Water, but the Wind coming in from the Sea, and blowing hard, oblig'd the Vessel to put to Sea, and leave them ashore, from whence they travelled here, and believ'd the Vessel was gone to St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s. The Governor, not satisfy'd with their report, took them for Spies, and kept them as such. However, in a Day or two afterwards, he dispatch'd a Pilot and two Seamen for the Island St. <HI>Ca∣tharine,</HI> to bring the Vessel round, in Case she should be there.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity of sending a Let∣ter by them to the Honourable Capt. <HI>Murray,</HI> Commander of his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Pearl,</HI> at <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> desiring them to order it to be dispatch'd by the first Ship from St. <HI>Ca∣tharine</HI>'s to the <HI>Rio Janeiro.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 20th, Last Night the three Seamen which came here, as mention'd be∣fore, with five more of this Place, attempted to run away with one of the large Boats; but they were pursu'd and taken: Their De∣sign was for the river <HI>Plate,</HI> the Wind then favouring them. This is evident, that the Governor was right in his Conjecture, and did not suspect them wrongfully; they are now Prisoners in the Guard-House. The next Morning I went to the Lieutenant, de∣siring him to apply to the Governor for a Pass and Horses for myself, Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> and <HI>John Young,</HI> to go by Land to St. <HI>Catha∣rine</HI>'s and St. <HI>Francisco;</HI> where we need not doubt of a Passage to his Majesty's distress'd Ships at <HI>Rio Janeiro:</HI> That it was our Duty to hasten to their Assistance: That he, the Lieutenant, ought, the very Day after our Arrival into this Port, without any regard
<PB N="181" REF="007859_0213_102DDBE8E5B38128"/>to Expence and Charges, to have dispatch'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> special Messenger by Land; and then we might have been assured of a Vessel before now. The Lieutenant answer'd, he had a Thought of enquiring at first coming about what I had mention'd, and of going himself, tho' it cost him fifty Pounds; but he was in∣form'd it was impossible to go by Land. I ask'd him, if so, how came the Brigadier from St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s here? And how do Peo∣ple weekly go from hence thither? As for Fatigue or Trouble, whoever undertook to go, he must expect that; but there was no Hardship to be encounter'd comparable to what we had already undergone. We lay here on Expence to the King, without doing any Service, and run the Hazard of not only losing the Opportunity of getting on Board our own Ships, but perhaps of missing the <HI>Flota,</HI> and of wintering here; therefore I beg'd he would entreat the Governor to let us have Horses and Guides; which he pro∣mis'd to mention to the Governor at Dinner, and send me his Answer in the Afternoon without fail. I waited with Impatience for this Answer; but the Lieutenant failing in his Promise, was the Occasion of my sending him this Letter.</P>

<PB N="182" REF="007859_0214_102DDBEACCF3E718"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am sorry you should give me the Liberty of telling you, you have not discharg'd your Promise, by letting us know the Governor's Answer to what we requested: Which was, at our Expence and Charge, to go to the Assistance of his Majesty's Ships at <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> since which Time I am to inform you that we are in want of Provision, having none of any kind allow'd us Yester∣day, and but one small Fish <HI>per</HI> Man for two Days before. The Meaning of which I believe is owing to you, by the endeavour∣ing, through the Persuasions of the Persons you confide in, to blacken us, and in so vile a Manner, that you seem unacquainted with the ill Consequence, which may attend the touching a Man's Character. We know, and are fully convinced, from what has been done already, that nothing will be allow'd or granted us but by your Means: Mr. <HI>Cum∣mins</HI> and myself ask no Favour from you, but to use your Endeavours to get us Dispatches to the Ships at <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> where every Man must give Account of his Actions, and Justice take Place. If I am not mistaken, you told me that what we were supply'd with here, was a Bounty flowing from the
<PB N="183" REF="007859_0215_102DDBED77D1D738"/>generous Spirit of the Governor, and the Gentlemen of the Place. If this be the Case, we ought to be very thankful indeed. I am surprized, Sir, you don't see the Grievances of the Inhabitants here, and hear the Soldiers Murmurings for want of their Arrears. If they should revolt at this Juncture, we shall stand a very bad Chance. I must acquaint you, Sir, the Vessel we came in, is not so much out of repair, but that, if you can get Canvas out of the Store for Sails, we can make 'em, and get ready for sailing in ten Days Time. And if the Vessel expected here with Supplies comes in a shorter Time, our Vessel will be ready fix'd for the Use of the Governor; and if one Vessel should not be large enough to carry us all off, we can go in Company. I imagine you know of the Stores being robb'd, and the Disturbance among the Soldiers, which must occasion Uneasiness enough, without repeating Griev∣ances, where relief is not to be had. I beg, Sir, you'll get us dispatch'd with all Expe∣dition to his Majesty's Service, that we may not lose the Opportunity of joining the two Ships and the <HI>Flota.</HI></P>

The next Morning the Lieutenaut came down on Horse-back, being the first Time of his appearing among us since we have been here, which is above three Weeks; we went with him to the Commandant, who promised we should not want fresh Beef and Fish; but as for Bread, there is none to be got. <HI>William Oram,</HI> one of the Carpenter's Crew, died this Day in the Hospital.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 6th, For several Days the People very uneasy at the Vessel's not arriving, the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having been fair for above three Weeks past, and little or no Provisions in Store, which makes them doubtful of any to be dispatch'd to their relief. This Day we are resolv'd to go by Land, if the Governor will only allow us a Guide; we acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lieutenant with our resolution; he went with me and Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to the Governor; we obtain'd Leave to go, with the Promise of a Guide. Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> being at the Gover∣nor's, desired to go with us; the Governor told him the Journey was so difficult and tedious, it would be impossible for him to encounter with it. The Captain answer'd, that he had a Company on Board his Ma∣jesty's Ship the <HI>Severn,</HI> where his Duty call'd him, and was determin'd, with the Gover∣nor's
<PB N="185" REF="007859_0217_102DDBF173A75F98"/>nor's Leave, to share his Fate with us by Land; which was granted. The Governor told us, notwithstanding the present Scarcity of Provisions in the Place, that he had so great a regard for an <HI>Englishman,</HI> that whilst he had any thing for himself, we should not want; for which we thank'd him heartily. This Governor is certainly a Gen∣tleman of a noble generous Spirit of ex∣ceeding Humanity and Goodness, and I be∣lieve him to have a sincere regard for an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 9th, This Morning Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> went over with me to the North Side, to make an Agreement for six People to go to St. <HI>Ca∣tharine</HI>'s; while we were here, the Governor received Letters from St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s, which gave an Account of four Vessels on their Passage for this Port; on the News of this we put by our Journey: It was very lucky we had not set out on this Journey before we heard the News: For on the nineteenth the Vessels from <HI>Rio Janeiro</HI> arrived, and brought an Account that the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl</HI> were sail'd from thence for the Island of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> Those Vessels not only brought the Soldiers Provisions, but also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="007859_0218_102DDBF402390BC8"/>
On the 20th, The Brigadier arriv'd, and had all the Soldiers drawn up, where their Pardon was read to them: He ac∣quainted them with what Money was come, which was not above a third Part of their Arrears, but the remainder was on the Passage. The Money he had for them should be paid directly as far as it would go, if they would take it; but they cry'd out with one Voice, The Whole or none; and a great Disturbance there was, some were for revolting to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> some began to change their Notes, and were for taking Part of the Money, and the rest insisted upon the Whole. To quell this Disturbance, the Commandant, whom they look'd upon more than the Brigadier, or the Governor, used his utmost Endeavours. They told the Commandant they were no longer Soldiers than while they were in the King's Pay, and let those who are for the King, draw off one Way by themselves; you are our Commander, we trust in you to answer for us, what you do we will stand by with our Lives: On which the Commandant deliver'd his Command up, shouldering his Firelock, and took the Place of a common Soldier, telling
<PB N="187" REF="007859_0219_102DDBF62C2452D0"/>them, since the King was so good as to pardon them, he thought it his Duty to accept it; the Brigadier was so well pleased with the Behaviour of the Commandant, that he ran to him, took him in his Arms, and embraced him; the rest of the Soldiers follow'd the Example of their late Com∣mandant, delivering their respective Com∣mands up to their proper Officers. This Day put an End to the Disturbance and Confusion which had been some Time among them, and restor'd them to Tranquility, good Discipline, and Order.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 22d, This Morning went to the Lieutenant for Leave to go in the first Vessel, which was expected to sail in four Days time; he told me he expected to go in her himself, and that we could not go off all in one Vessel; there might be room for the Officers, but the People must wait another Opportunity. I told him that it was a Duty incumbent on the Officers that were in Pay, particularly, to take Care of the People; you, Sir, have been sure of half Pay ever since the Ship was lost; we are not, but I will tarry myself behind with the People, and be answerable for them, if you'll give me a Not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under your Hand to secure me the Value of my
<PB N="188" REF="007859_0220_102DDBF90B6A8BE0"/>Pay, from the Loss of the Ship; otherwise I don't know any Business I have but to en∣deavour to get to <HI>England</HI> as soon as I can, and will put it out of your Power to prevent my going off in the first Vessel. I left the Lieutenant, and went with Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Snow,</HI> Mr. <HI>King,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Oakley</HI> to the Governor, to obtain leave for our going; the Lieutenant follow'd us, and said, but one half could go at a time. The Governor told us it was order'd that the Land Officers, myself and the rest that apply'd to go by Land, should be the first dispatch'd, and might go on board when we would; but as the Vessel did not belong to the King, we must buy Provisions, and pay for our Passage. I said, Sir, we have not Money to answer the Expence: He then ask'd me whether I had not several Times apply'd to him for Leave to go by Land at my own Charges? I answer'd, we were oblig'd to dispose of our Watches to raise that Money, which will barely be suf∣ficient to carry us six off that intended to go by Land, therefore what must become of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est who have not a single Penny? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, Sir, that you are not unacquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> allows to all
<PB N="189" REF="007859_0221_102DDBFB9D2A56D0"/>his Subjects, distress'd in this Manner, five Vintins <HI>per</HI> Day to each Man for Subsistence. On my saying this, the Governor call'd the Commissary and Major; he walk'd and talk'd with them aside; then came back again, and told us the Account was so small, that it was not worth charging the King of <HI>England</HI> with it; therefore we must buy our own Provi∣sions, and pay our Passage; and as to what we had receiv'd from them, we were wel∣come; upon which we thank'd them, and came away. We then consulted with the Lieutenant, to know what could be done with the People; and that as the Vessel we came in was not fit to proceed in any farther, it was to no Purpose to leave her there; therefore we desired his consent to sell her, believing the Money she would bring, would be sufficient to carry us all off. To this Pro∣posal the Lieutenant consented. We then apply'd to the Master of the Vessel, to know what he would have for our Passage; his De∣mand was forty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Man; of which we acquainted the Lieutenant, who told us he could not see what we could do, and, on second Consideration, would not give his Consent to sell the Boat; for, when sold, he did not think she would fetch the Money.
<PB N="190" REF="007859_0222_102DDBFEB3B70380"/>Those Words of the Lieutenant put us all to a Stand, especially after he had but now given his Consent to sell her; and in so short Time to declare the reverse, was very odd; tho' indeed it did not much surprize us, be∣cause this Gentleman was never known to be over stedfast to his Word. Seeing no Possi∣bility of carrying he People off without sel∣ling the Boat, I told the Lieutenant, if he left them behind, I could not think but so many of his Majesty's Subjects were sold; and believ'd he had made a Present of the Vessel to the Governor. At this the Lieute∣nant paus'd for a while; and then said, he had not Money to carry himself off without selling his Coat. I reply'd, there was no Occasion for that, when he had a Gold Watch. The next Morning went to the Lieutenant again about our going off; he acquainted us, that the Brigadier had order'd Things in ano∣ther Manner; that myfelf, and nine more, being the Persons disirous of going, should be dispatch'd in the first Vessel, and every Thing found us; that he, the Lieutenant, was to tarry behind with the rest of the Peo∣ple, and to come in the next Vessel, an Esti∣mate of the Charges being made out; and also he told us, he had a severe Check for
<PB N="191" REF="007859_0223_102DDC006D3F5BD8"/>requesting to go first himself, and offering to leave the People behind.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 28, I embark'd on Board the St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Brigantine, with the Car∣penter, Boatswain, the two Mates, the Sur∣geon of Marines, the Cooper, and six of the People; the Provisions laid in for us were two Casks of Salt Beef, and ten Alcadoes of <HI>Farina.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 31st, we sail'd for <HI>Rio Ja∣neiro,</HI> with the Wind at W. steer'd S. E. and S. E. by E. until over the Bar; then E. by N. and E. N. E. with a fine Gale and clear Wea∣ther; there is not above two Fathom and half Water on the Bar at High-Water; when you are in, it is a fine commodious Harbour for small Vessels; it is a low Land of a sandy Soil: Here is Abundance of fine Cattle; with Fresh-water Fish, Melon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exceeding good, Plenty of Water, and the best Milk I ever tasted.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, April</HI> the 8th, Little Wind at S. W. and fair Weather. At ten this Morn∣ing anchor'd before the Town of St. <HI>Sebastians.</HI> The <HI>Portugueze</HI> Pilots, who have been in <HI>England,</HI> call the Land here the <HI>Isle of Wight;</HI> and indeed it is very like it, tho' not so large, being only eight Miles in Length. This is a
<PB N="192" REF="007859_0224_102DDC034E2EC878"/>very secure Harbour for Shipping; a Stranger may go in or out without any Difficulty. At this Place I was ashore, and think it as de∣lightful and pleasant a Place as ever I saw in <HI>America;</HI> abounding with Fruit, as Oranges, Lemons, Bonano's; also with Yams, Pota∣toes, Fish and Fowl.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 10th, Sail'd from St. <HI>Sebasti∣ans;</HI> little Wind at S. W. steer'd out S. E. between the Island and the Main; and at Eight in the Morning, on the <HI>Monday</HI> follow∣ing, we anchor'd before the City of <HI>Rio Ja∣neiro.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the 13th, This Morning we were all order'd before the Governor. A <HI>Dutch</HI> Surgeon was sent for, who spoke very good <HI>English.</HI> After an Enquiry into our Misfor∣tunes, the Governor order'd him to be our Consul; telling us, that we should have a convenient House, with Firing, and eight Vintins a Man <HI>per</HI> Day Subsistence-Money: He also desir'd we might make no Disturbance among ourselves; which we promis'd to avoid. A Nobleman went with the Consul to look out for our Habitation; they fix'd on a large magnificent House, fit for a Person of Qua∣lity. This being the first Day of our coming ashore, they were pleas'd to order a Dinner,
<PB N="193" REF="007859_0225_102DDC0543A33A88"/>and Supper out of Doors, and sent us where we were to eat all together. This was the first Time of the Boatswain's eating with the rest of the Officers since we left <HI>Cheap</HI> Island. The Consul was so kind as to send us a Ta∣ble, Benches, Water Pots, and several useful Things, from his own House; we thought ourselves very happily seated.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 14th, This Morning the Consul went with the Officers and People to the Treasury for our Money. Mr. <HI>Oakley,</HI> Surgeon of his Majesty's Land Forces, was desired by the Consul to sign for it. The Boatswain, who now look'd upon himself as our Captain, was not a little displeas'd at this. When the Money was received, the Consul would have given it the Surgeon to pay us; but he excus'd himself, telling the Consul the Boatswain was a troublesome Man, and it might occasion a Disturbance; on which the Consul was so good as to come and pay it himself. Being all together, he told us the Governor had order'd us eight Vintins a Man <HI>per</HI> Day; but at the same Time had made a Distinction between the Officers and Seamen; that the Money re∣ceived was to be paid in the Manner follow∣ing, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Seamen six Vintins <HI>per</HI> Man,
<PB N="194" REF="007859_0226_102DDC0742193370"/>and the Officers ten. The reason of this Distinction was, that the Seamen could go to work, and get Money by their Labour; when the Officers could not, but must be obliged to live entirely on their Allowance. This Distinction caused great Uneasiness, the Boatswain insisting that the People had a right to an equal Share with us. The Offi∣cers, willing to make all Things easy, desir'd the Consul it might be so. The Consul re∣ply'd, the Money should be dispos'd of ac∣cording to the Governor's Direction, or not at all. The Boatswain then objected against the Cooper, because he was no Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The Consul said, Master! I believe the Cooper to be a very good quiet Man, and I dare say will take it as the Men do; but sooner than this be an Objection, I will pay the Money out of my own Pocket. The Boatswain then began at me, abusing me in a very scanda∣lous and abominable Manner; saying, among other Things; that the Cooper was got among the rest of the Pirates, for so he term'd me and the rest of the Officers. When the Mo∣ney was paid, we acquainted the Consul, that we had, till now, been separated from the Boatswain; that he was of so perverse and turbulent a Temper, and so abusive in Speech,
<PB N="195" REF="007859_0227_102DDC09B35382D8"/>that we could not bear with him. The Boatswain then chose to be with the People, and gave us the Preference of the Fore∣room, where we desired to be by ourselves. There were two Doors to our room; we look'd both of them, and went to take a Walk in the Country: At our return in the Evening, we found the Doors broke open, and a small Sword belonging to me was bro∣ken an Inch off the Point, and the Scabbard all in Pieces. The Boatswain had in his room an <HI>Irishman,</HI> whom he sent in on Pur∣pose to quarrel with us. This <HI>Irishman</HI> and <HI>Richard East,</HI> one of our own People, fell upon the Cooper and me: <HI>East</HI> chose to en∣gage with me; he struck me several Times; he compell'd me to stand in my own Defence, and I soon master'd him. During this Quar∣rel the Carpenter call'd the Guards; at Sight of whom the <HI>Irishman</HI> made his Escape. I desir'd the Guards to secure <HI>East</HI> a Prisoner, but the Officer told me he could not, unless I would go to Prison with him. I told him it was my desire, and accordingly I went. The Prison was in the Governor's House. I had not been there but a few Minutes before the Governor sent for me; he enquired of the Officer concerning the Disturbance, and or∣der'd
<PB N="196" REF="007859_0228_102DDC0C00FB4438"/>me to my Habitation; but detain'd <HI>East</HI> a Prisoner. When I came Home I found the Boatswain, and two renegadoes with him, all about the Cooper. On seeing me, he repeated his former abusive Words. He made us so uneasy in our Lodging, that, to prevent Murder, we were oblig'd to lie out of the House. Next Morning Mr. <HI>Oakley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> went to the Consul; he came with them to the House, where we were all sent for; he told us it was very strange, that People who had undergone so many Hardships and Difficulties, could not agree lovingly together. We answer'd, we never us'd to mess together; and sooner than we would be with the Boatswain, we would make it our Choice to take a House in the Country at our own Expence. The Boat∣swain, on hearing this, fell again into his usual Strain of Slander and abusive Language, cal∣ing us rogues, Villains, and Pirates. It was the Governor's first request, that we might have no Disturbance among us; yet the Boat∣swain hath not suffer'd us to have a quiet Minute since we have been here. The Con∣sul went with us two Miles out of the City, at a sishing Village; where we took a House, at our own Expence, to pay at the rate of
<PB N="197" REF="007859_0229_102DDC0DCB752AA0"/>ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month, there being seven of us in all, <HI>viz.</HI> myself, the Carpenter, Sur∣geon, the two Mates, the Cooper, and a Seaman. Here we thought ourselves safe and secure. The next Day, in the After∣noon, two of the Boatswain's Friends, which had lately deserted from his Majesty's Service, and an <HI>Irish</HI> Clerk with them, came to pay us a Visit. They were so impertinent, as not only to enquire into the reasons of the Disturbance among ourselves, but they also instructed us in our Duty, telling us, they came from our Commander the Boatswain, with Orders to see our Journal. I told them the Journal should not be a Secret to any Person who could read; but at the same Time I would never part with it to be copied out: They then drank a Glass of Punch with us and left us. This is a Place that a Man is oblig'd sometimes to suffer himself to be used ill; if he resents all Affronts, he runs a great Hazard of losing his Life; for here ruf∣fians are to be hired at a small Expence; and there is no Place in the World where People will commit Murder at so cheap a rate. Be∣tween Nine and Ten at Night, three People, came to our Door; one of which knock'd, telling us that he was the Person that was
<PB N="198" REF="007859_0230_102DDC10314B3F58"/>with me and the Cooper in the Afternoon. Being apprehensive that they came with no good Intent, we refus'd opening the Door; telling them, that it was an improper Season of the Night, and that we did not know they had any Business with us; if they had, we told them to come in the Morning: But they still insisted upon the Door being open'd; saying, it would be better to do so, than to be taken away in three Hours Time. When they had said this, they went away. We did not know the Meaning of their Words, but imagin'd they were gone to bring some Asso∣ciates to beset the House; having nothing to defend ourselves with, we got over the Back-Wall of the House, and took to the Country for Safety: In the Morning apply'd to the Consul, who remov'd us to a House in the Midst of the Village; he gave an Account to the Inhabitants of the Design the Boatswain had form'd against us, either to compel us to deliver up the Journal, or to take our Lives; he therefore desired that the Journal and Pa∣pers might be deposited in the Hands of a Neighbour there, till the Time of our going off. The People of the Place offer'd to stand by us with their Lives, in Opposition to any
<PB N="199" REF="007859_0231_102DDC12C65B4DD8"/>Persons who should attempt to do us an In∣jury.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 18th, Early this Morning we were sent for to the Consul. He said to us, Gentlemen, as the Lives of three of you are in Danger, and I don't know what Villany your Boatswain may be capable of acting, in regard to your Peace and Safety; I'll endea∣vour to get you three on Board a Ship bound for <HI>Bahia</HI> and <HI>Lisbon;</HI> accordingly he went to the Captain of the Ship, who consented that we should go with him, on these Con∣ditions, that the Governor would give us a Pass, and that we would work for our Pas∣sage; this we agreed to: After this we re∣quested the Governor for a Pass, which he was so good as to grant, and is as follows.</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 21st, Early this Morning the Captain came on Board; on seeing us, he ask'd us, How we came on Board without his Leave? Notwithstanding he gave Leave to the Consul for our Passage, we ought to have waited on him ashore. There was on Board the Ship a <HI>Spanish</HI> Don, a Passenger, who told the Captain no <HI>Englishman</HI> should go in the same Ship with him; therefore de∣sired we might be turn'd ashore; but the Captain insisted upon doing what he pleas'd aboard his own Ship, and would not comply with his request. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Don, when we came to converse with him, was very much mov'd with the relation of our Mis∣fortunes; and said to us, though our royal Masters, the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> are at War, it was not our Fault; that we were now on Board a Neutral Ship belonging to a King who was a Friend to both Nations;
<PB N="206" REF="007859_0238_102DDC21AEAE7468"/>that he would not look upon us as Enemies, but do us all the Service he could. He ex∣toll'd the Conduct and Bravery of Admiral <HI>Vernon</HI> at <HI>Porto-Bello;</HI> but, above all, ap∣plauded him for his Humanity and generous Treatment of his Enemies. He made great Encomiums on the Magnificence of the <HI>British</HI> Fleet, and the Boldness and Imtrepidity of the Sailors, stiling the <HI>English</HI> the <HI>Soldiers of the Sea.</HI> He supplied us in our Passage not only with Provisions from his Table, but also with Wine and Brandy; and during the whole Voyage appear'd so different from an Enemy, that he took all Opportunities of giving us Proofs of his Generosity and Goodness.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 7th of <HI>May</HI> 1742, This Morn∣ing anchor'd before the City of <HI>Bahia,</HI> went on Shore to the Vice-roy, shew'd him the Pass we had from the Governor of <HI>Rio Janeiro:</HI> He told us the Pass was to dispatch us to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and that the first Ship which sail'd from hence would be the Ship we came in; we petition'd him for Provisions, acquainting him of our reception at <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> that we had hitherto been supply'd at the rate of eight Vintins each Man <HI>per</HI> Day. He refused supplying us with any Thing; upon which I told him,
<PB N="207" REF="007859_0239_102DDC2453C2CEB0"/>we had better been Prisoners to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who would allow us Bread and Water, than in a Friend's Country to be starv'd. The Captain of the Ship we came in, hearing the Vice-roy would not supply us, was so kind as to go with us to him, acquainting him how we were provided for at <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> and that he would supply us himself, if he would sign an Account to satisfy the Consul General at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> so that he might be reimburs'd. The Vice-roy answer'd, he had no Orders concerning the <HI>English,</HI> that he had Letters from the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> his Master to supply the <HI>French,</HI> but had no Orders about any other Nation, and if he gave us any thing, it must be out of his own Pocket, therefore he would not supply us; The Captain then told him that we were Officers and Subjects to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and in Distress; that we did not want great Matters, only barely enough to support Life, and begg'd that he would allow but four Vintins <HI>per</HI> Day, being but half the Sum hitherto allow'd us. The Cap∣tain's Intreaties avail'd nothing, the Vice-roy continuing as fix'd in his resolution of giving us no relief; I don't believe there
<PB N="208" REF="007859_0240_102DDC25EBC05CF8"/>ever was a worse representative of royalty upon the Face of the Earth, than this Vice-roy; His royal Master the King of <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> is very well known to have a grateful Affection for the <HI>British</HI> Nation (nor can we believe he is so Frenchify'd as this Vice-roy makes him) his Deputy differs greatly from him, he has given a Proof of his Aver∣sion to the <HI>English.</HI> We think Persons in the Distress we were represented in to him, could in no Part of the World, nay in an Enemy's Country, be treated with more Barbarity than we were here; We work'd here for our Victuals, and then could get but one Meal <HI>per</HI> Day, which was Farina and Caravances. At this Place we must have starv'd, if I had not by me some Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and a Silver Watch of my own, which I was oblig'd to turn into Money to support us. I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Money fourteen Guineas, which I exchang'd with the Captain who brought us here for <HI>Portugueze</HI> Money; He at the same time told me it would be hard upon me to be so much out of Pocket, and said if I would draw a Bill on the Con∣sul General at <HI>Lisbon</HI> for the Sum, as if sup∣ply'd from him, upon the Payment of that
<PB N="209" REF="007859_0241_102DDC278C0AAFF8"/>Bill, he would return me my fourteen Gui∣neas, accordingly a Bill was drawn up by an <HI>English</HI> Merchant at <HI>Bahia,</HI> and sign'd by us, being as follows:</P>

<P>Since our being here, we have been in∣form'd of one of his Majesty's Ships with three Store-Ships being arriv'd at <HI>Rio Ja∣neiro,</HI> supply'd with Stores and Men for the relief and Assistance of the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl</HI> (which were sail'd before in <HI>January</HI> last for <HI>Barbadoes)</HI> and that our People were
<PB N="212" REF="007859_0244_102DDC2E23184C78"/>gone on board of them, and bound for the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a very good Bay for Ships to ride in, with the Wind from the E. S. E. to the Northward and Westward back to the S. W. and Wind to the Southward, which blows in, and makes a very great Sea. At the East Side coming in, standeth <HI>Point de Gloria,</HI> where is a very large Forti∣fication, with a Tower in the midst; from this Point the Land rises gradually; about a League from hence is the City of <HI>Bahia;</HI> it is surrounded with Fortifications and equally capable of defending it against any Attempts from the Sea or Lands.</P>
<P>Provisions her of all kinds are excessive dear, especially Fish, this we impute to the great Number of Whales that come into this Bay, even where the Ships lie at Anchor; the Whale Boats go off and kill sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>even or eight Whales in a Day. The Flesh of which is out up in small Pieces, then brought to the Market Place, and sold at the rate of a Vintin <HI>per</HI> Pound; it looks very much like coarse Beef, but inferior to it in Taste. The Whales here are not at all equal in Size to the Whales in <HI>Green∣land,</HI> being not larger than the Grampus.
<PB N="213" REF="007859_0245_102DDC2FCDE7F3A8"/>After living here above four Months with∣out any relief from the Governor or the Inhabitants, who behaved to us as if they were under a Combination to starve us, we embark'd on board the St. <HI>Tubes</HI> with our good Friend the Captain who brought us from <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> we sail'd from <HI>Bahia</HI> the 11th of <HI>September</HI> for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in Company with one of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Ships of War, and two <HI>East-India</HI> Ships; but the St. <HI>Tubas</HI> not being able to sail so well as the other Ships, lost sight of them the first Night. About 70 Leagues from the Westward of <HI>Madeira,</HI> we bent a new Foresail; within two or three Days afterwards, we had a very hard Gale of Wind, scudding under the Foresail, and no Danger happening to the Ship during this Gale. When the Wind had ceas'd, and we had fair Weather, the Captain, after the Evening Mass, made an Oration to the People, telling them that their Deli∣verance from Danger in the last Gale of Wind, and that the Ship though leaky mak∣ing no more Water than before, was owing to their Prayers to <HI>Nuestra Senhora Boa Mortua</HI> and her Intercession. That in Gra∣titude they ought to make an Acknowledg∣ment to that Saint for standing their Friend
<PB N="214" REF="007859_0246_102DDC31E14DF0A0"/>in time of Need. That he himself would shew the Example by giving the new Fore∣sail, which was bent to the Yard, to the Saint their Deliverer; accordingly one of the Seamen went forward and mark'd out these Words on the Sail, <HI>Deal esta Trinckado pour nostra Senhora Boa mortua</HI> (which is as much as to say) <HI>I give this Foresail to our Saint the Deliverer from Death.</HI> The Sail and Money collected on this Occasion amount∣ed to upwards of twenty Moidores.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 23d of <HI>November,</HI> in the Latitude 39: 17 North, and Longitude 6: 00 W. that Day at Noon the <HI>Rock</HI> of <HI>Lisbon</HI> bearing S. by W. distant sixteen Leagues; we steer'd E. S. E. to make the <HI>Rock</HI> before Night. At Four o'Clock it blew a very hard Gale, and right on the Shore; the Ship lay to under a Foresail with her Head to the Southward; at Six it blew a Storm, the Foresail splitting, oblig'd us to keep her before the Wind, which was running her right on the Shore. The Ship was now given over for lost, the People all fell to Prayers, and cry'd out to their Saints for Deliverance, offering all they had in the World for their Lives; and yet at the same time neglected all Means to save themselves;
<PB N="215" REF="007859_0247_102DDC34A34480E0"/>they left off pumping the Ship, though she was exceeding leaky. This Sort of Proceed∣ing in time of Extremity is a thing unknown to our <HI>English</HI> Seamen; in those Emergencies all Hands are employ'd for the Preservation of the Ship and People, and, if any of them fall upon their Knees, 'tis after the Danger is over. The Carpenter and myself could by no Means relish this Behaviour, we begg'd the People for God's sake to go to the Pumps, telling them we had a Chance of saving our Lives, while we kept the Ship above Water, that we ought not to suffer the Ship to sink, while we could keep her free. The Captain and Officers hearing us pressing them so earnestly, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t off Prayers, and intreated the Men to keep the Pumps going, accordingly we went to pumping, and preserv'd our∣selves and the Ship: In half an Hour after∣wards the Wind shifted to the W. N. W. then the Ship lay South, which would clear the Course along Shore had the Wind not shifted; we must in an Hour's time have run the Ship a-shore. This Deliverance, as well as the Former, was owing to the Intercession of <HI>Nuestra Senhora Boa Mortua:</HI> On this Oc∣casion they collected Fifty Moidores more, and made this pious resolution, that, when
<PB N="216" REF="007859_0248_102DDC3694BA9078"/>the Ship arriv'd safe at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> the Fore∣sail, which was split in the last Gale of Wind, should be carried in Procession to the Church of this grand Saint, and the Captain should there make an Offering equal in Value to the Foresail, which was reckon'd worth eighteen Moidores.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 28th of <HI>November,</HI> we ar∣rived at <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and on the next Morning every Person who came in the Ship, (except∣ing the Carpenter, myself; and the Cooper) Officers, Passengers, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Don himself, and all the People, Men and Boys, walk'd bare-footed, with the Fore-sail in Procession, to the Church of <HI>Nuestra Senhora Boa Mor∣tua;</HI> the Weather at that Time being very cold, and the Church a good Mile distant from the Landing-Place. We <HI>Englishmen,</HI> when we came ashore, went immediately on the <HI>Change.</HI> I was pretty well known to some Gentlemen of the <HI>English</HI> Factory. When I inform'd them that we were three of the un∣fortunate People that were cast away in the <HI>Wager,</HI> and that we came here in one of the <HI>Brazil</HI> Ships, and wanted to embrace the first Opportunity of going to <HI>England;</HI> they told me, that the Lieutenant had been before us; that he was gone home in the Packet Boat,
<PB N="217" REF="007859_0249_102DDC388BD93FB8"/>and left us a very indifferent Character. I answer'd, I believ'd the Lieutenant could give but a very bad Account of himself, having kept no Journal, nor made any remarks since the Loss of the Ship, nor perhaps be∣fore; that we doubted not but to acquit our∣selves of any false Accusations, having with us a Journal, which gave an impartial re∣lation of all our Proceedings. The Journal was read by several Gentlemen of the Facto∣ry, who treated us, during our Stay at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with exceeding Kindness and Benevolence.</P>
<P>On the 20th of <HI>December,</HI> we embark'd on Board his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Stirling-Castle</HI> for <HI>England:</HI> Here we had again the Happi∣ness of experiencing the Difference between a <HI>British</HI> and a Foreign Ship, particularly in regard to Cleanliness, Accomodation, Diet and Discipline. We met with nothing ma∣terial in our Passage, and arrived at <HI>Spithead</HI> on the 1st of <HI>January,</HI> 1742-3. Here we thought of nothing but going ashore im∣mediately to our Families; but were told by the Captain, we must not stir out of the Ship till he knew the Pleasure of the Lords of the Admiralty, having already wrote to them con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rning us. This was a very great Affliction to us; and the more so because
<PB N="218" REF="007859_0250_102DDC3AA7EC42B8"/>we thought our Troubles at an End. The Carpenter and myself were in View of our Habitations; our Families had long given us over for lost; and, on the News of our Safety, our relatives look'd upon us as Sons, Hus∣bands, and Fathers, restor'd to them in a mi∣raculous Manner. Our being detain'd on Board gave them great Anxiety; we endea∣vour'd to console 'em as well as we could; being assured, that we had done nothing to offend their Lordships; that, if Things were not carried on with that Order and regula∣rity which is strictly observ'd in the Navy, Necessity drove us out of the common road. Our Case was singular: Since the loss of the Ship, our chiefest Concern was for the Pre∣servation of our Lives and Liberties; to ac∣complish which we acted according to the Dictates of Nature, and the best of our Un∣derstanding.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I received for Answer by one of the Mes∣sengers, <Q>That the Journal was our own, and that their Lordships would have nothing to do with it, so you may do as you will with it.</Q> I thought this Answer was Leave sufficient, on which I went to publish∣ing the Journal, which some People in the World have condemned me for; had I not wrote to their Lordships for Leave, they might have blamed me. After publishing the Work, we were told by many, that we were to be hang'd for Piracy in coming away with the King's Long-boat without the Capt. and also for mutinying, and not bringing him home with us. There was one great good Man that gave his Judgment in our Favour, so far as to say, She was not the King's Long-boat; giving these reasons: At the first
<PB N="223" REF="007859_0255_102DDC46438682F8"/>wrecking of the <HI>Wager,</HI> they cut their Masts away, which rendered them incapable of hoist∣ing her out; but some Time after the Cap∣tain gave Orders to his Officers and People to go off to the Wreck and bring the Long-boat on Shore. They obey his Orders, go off to the Wreck, saw the Gunnel down, launch the Boat, and bring her on Shore; when there, the Captain orders her to be haul'd up at a proper Place for lengthning; his Or∣ders are obey'd; after which he orders the Carpenter to saw her asunder; the Carpen∣ter goes to work, obeys the Captain's Orders; now, it is to be observed, that the Long-boat is in two Parts, and by Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Orders; by which Orders, he has not only made her useless to the whole Body of the People on the Island, but as useless to himself as the Wreck in the Sea, and by his own Orders: But the Carpenter, with the Assistance of the People, have gone into the Woods, out their own Timber, saw'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own Plank, and brought her into a Position of 23 Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I am farther to observe, that at that Time, when the King's Ship was lost, that the Pay ceased, and it might as well have been told them that they had no right to take up any Part of the Wreck of his Majesty's Ship that float∣ed
<PB N="224" REF="007859_0256_102DDC4837641590"/>a long the Shore, in Order to be delivered from this Island, because it is the Wreck of the King's, Ship; and, if so, the Subject has not a right to save his life by it: In regard to Mutiny, it was desired to be known, whether the Officers and Seamen belonging to his Majesty's Ship <HI>Ruby,</HI> who seized their Captain on Board the Ship for the Murther of <HI>Sir John Dindly Goodyer,</HI> his Brother, and deli∣vered him up to the Mayor of <HI>Bristol,</HI> where Mutineers? these People were in Pay to the Government; and whether the Officers and Sea∣men of the <HI>Wager</HI> on that desolate Island, out of Pay of the Government, had not as much reason to confine Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> for the Death of Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> and deliver him up to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> of His Majesty's Land-forces? This I leave to the Candid to judge, which were the greatest Mutineers of the two?</P>
<P>About two Years after the Journal was pub∣lished, I had an Offer made me by some Gen∣tlemen of the City of <HI>London,</HI> to go down to <HI>Plymouth</HI> in Order to bring up to <HI>London</HI> the old <HI>Saphire</HI> man of War, a forty Gun Ship, purchas∣sed by those Gentlemen for a privateer: This was the first offer made of getting into Bread since my Arrival in <HI>England</HI> which I thought it my Duty to accept; the same Duty bound me

After receiving the above, I proceeded for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> there took charge and fix'd the Ship with Jury Masts, muster'd forty Men, and ten Guns. In the middle of July sail'd in Com∣pany with three Sail bound for <HI>London,</HI> the Masters whereof engaged with me not to Part Company, being doubtful of falling in with two French Dogger Privateers, which had done a great Deal of Mischief in the Channel. The next Morning about Six o'Clock, it being little Wind, the <HI>Starts</HI> bearing N.N.W. saw the two Privateers in chase of three Ships to the S. in about two Hours after they left off their Chace, and haul'd their Wind, in order to speak with us; at which the three Sail be∣ing within me, haul'd their Wind in order to run their Vessels on shore: on this I bore down to the Privateers, run the ten Guns out of the starboard Side, and as soon as with∣in Gun shot hoisted the King's Colours and fired a Shot, which they did not regard, by not hoisting any Colours; at which I ordered the Men below to get all ready at once to haul all the lower Deck Ports up, by doing which we'll give them to believe we are in a Man of War, and by having Jury Masts, will think that we lost them in an Engagement or bad Weather; as soon as they acquainted me
<PB N="228" REF="007859_0260_102DDC510EB6FF90"/>they were ready, I order'd them to haul up, and fired another Shot, which had the desired Effect, for they instantly hoisted <HI>Swedish</HI> Colours, and tack'd from us; by which Scheme six Sail of Merchant Vessels were saved from being taken; the Privateers had each a Hundred and Seventeen Men on Board. To the Fact of this I refer to the St. James's Evening Post, it being published there. In about ten Months after this Captain Cheap arrived in <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France:</HI> The Account he gave of his Proceed∣ings, and the Perils and Dangers he went thro' after he was left by us, is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Long-boat and Cutter were gone, the Captain, and those who were left with him, proposed to pass to the North∣ward in the Barge and Yawl; But the Wea∣ther was so bad, and the Difficulty of sub∣sisting so great, that it was two Months af∣ter the Departure of the Long-boat before he was able to put to Sea. But as it has been already said, the Place where the <HI>Wager</HI> was cast away, was not a Part of the Conti∣nent, but an Island at some some distance from the Main, which afforded no other Sorts of Provision but Shell-fish, and a few Herbs; and as the greatest Part of what they had
<PB N="229" REF="007859_0261_102DDC52FAE30320"/>gotten from the Ship was carried off in the Long-boat, the Captain and his People were often in great Necessity, especially as they chose to preserve what little Sea-provisions remained, for their Store when they should go to the Northward. During their resi∣dence at this Island, which was by the Sea∣men denominated <HI>Wager's Island,</HI> they had now and then a straggtling Canoe or two of <HI>Indians,</HI> which came and bartered their Fish and other Provisions with our People. This was indeed some little Succour, and at ano∣ther Season might perhaps have been great∣er; for as there were several <HI>Indian</HI> Huts on the Shore, it was supposed that in some Years, during the height of Summer, ma∣ny of these Savages might resort thither to fish.</P>
<P>Upon the 14th of <HI>December,</HI> the Captain and his People embarked in the Barge and the Yawl, in order to proceed to the North∣ward, taking on board with them all the Provisions they could amass from the Wreck of the Ship; but they had scarcely been an Hour at Sea, when the Wind began to blow hard, and the Sea ran so high, that they were obliged to throw the greatest Part of their Provisions over-board, to avoid im∣mediate
<PB N="230" REF="007859_0262_102DDC54E22CE2D8"/>Destruction. This was a terrible Mis∣fortune, in a Part of the World where Food is so hard to be got: However, they still persisted in their Design, putting on Shore as often as they could to seek Subsistance. But about a Fortnight after, another dreadful Ac∣cident befel them, for the Yawl sunk at an Anchor, and one of the Men in her was drown∣ed; and as the Barge was incapable of car∣rying the whole Company, they were now re∣duced to the hard Necessity of leaving four Marines behind them on that desolate Shore. But they still kept on their Course to the Northward, struggling with their Disasters, and greatly delayed by the Perverseness of the Winds, and the frequent Interruptions which their Search after Food occasioned; Till at last, about the End of <HI>January,</HI> having made three unsuccessful Attempts to double a Head-land, which they supposed to be what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called Cape <HI>Tres Montes,</HI> it was unanimously resolved to give over this Expe∣dition, the Difficulties of which appeared in∣superable, and to return again to <HI>Wager Island,</HI> where they got back about the Middle of <HI>February,</HI> quite disheartned and dejected with their reiterated Disappointments, and almost perishing with Hunger and Fatigue.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="007859_0263_102DDC56C3967500"/>
However, on their return they had the good Luck to meet with several Pieces of Beef, which had been washed out of the Ship, and were swimming in the Sea. This was a most seasonable relief to them, after the Hardships they had endured: And to compleat their good Fortune, there came, in a short Time, two Canoes of <HI>Indians,</HI> a∣mongst which was a Native of <HI>Chiloe,</HI> who spoke a little <HI>Spanish;</HI> and the Surgeon, who was with Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> understanding that Language, he made a Bargain with the <HI>Indi∣an,</HI> that if he would carry the Captain and his People to <HI>Chiloe</HI> in the Barge, he should have her, and all that belonged to her for his Pains. Accordingly, on the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> the eleven Persons to which the Company was now reduced, embark'd in the Barge on this new Expedition; but after having proceeded for a few Days, the Captain and four of his principal Officers being on Shore, the Six, who together with an <HI>Indian</HI> remain∣ed in the Barge, put off with her to Sea, and did not return.</P>
<P>By this Means there were left on Shore Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Lieutenant of Marines, the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> Midshipmen, and Mr. <HI>Elliot,</HI> the Sur∣geon.
<PB N="232" REF="007859_0264_102DDC590C4BE748"/>One would have thought their Dis∣tresses had long before this Time been inca∣pable of Augmentation; but they found, on reflection, that their present Situation was much more dismaying than any Thing they had yet gone through, being left on a deso∣late Coast, without any Provision, or the Means of procuring any; for their Arms, Ammunition, and every Conveniency they were Masters of, except the tattered Habits they had on, were all carried away in the Barge.</P>
<P>But when they had sufficiently revolved in their own Minds the various Circumstances of this unexpected Calamity, and were per∣swaded that they had no relief to hope for, they perceived a Canoe at a Distance, which proved to be that of the <HI>Indian,</HI> who had un∣dertaken to carry them to <HI>Chiloe,</HI> he and his Family being then on Board it. He made no Difficulty of coming to them; for it seems he had left Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> and his People a little before to go a fishing, and had in the mean Time committed them to the Care of the other <HI>Indian,</HI> whom the Sail∣ors had carried to Sea in the Barge. But when he found the Barge gone and his Com∣panion missing, he was extreamly concerned,
<PB N="233" REF="007859_0265_102DDC5B2BFFCB40"/>and could with Difficulty be perswaded that the other <HI>Indian</HI> was not murdered; but, being at last satisfied with the Account that was given him, he still undertook to carry them to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Settlements, and (as the <HI>Indians</HI> are well skilled in fishing and fowl∣ing) to procure them Provisions by the Way.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>March</HI> Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> and the Four that were left with him, set out for <HI>Chiloe,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> having procured a Number of Canoes, and gotten many of his Neighbours together for that Purpose. Soon after they embarked, Mr <HI>Elliot</HI> the Surgeon died, so that there now remained only Four of the whole Company. At last, after a very complicated Passage by Land and Water, Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> arrived in the Beginning of <HI>June</HI> at the Island of <HI>Chiloe,</HI> where they were received by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with great Humanity; but, on Ac∣count of some Quarrel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> did not get there till two Months after. Thus, above a Twelvemonth after the Loss of the <HI>Wager</HI> ended this fatiguing Peregrination, which by a Variety of Misfor∣tunes diminished the Company from Twen∣ty to no more than Four, and those too brought so low, that, had their Distresses con∣tinued
<PB N="334" REF="007859_0266_102DDC5D35DA9348"/>but a few Days longer, in all Proba∣bility none of them would have survive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. For the Captain himself was with Difficulty recovered; and the rest were so reduced by the Severity of the Weather, their Labour, and their Want of all kinds of Necessaries, that it was wonderful how they supported themselves so long. After some Stay at <HI>Chiloe,</HI> the Captain and the Three who were sent to <HI>Valparaiso,</HI> and thence to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Chili,</HI> where they conti∣nued above a Year: But on the Advice of a Cartel being settled betwixt <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> were permitted to return to <HI>Europe</HI> on board a <HI>French</HI> Ship. The other Midshipman, Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> having changed his religion, whilst at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> chose to go back to <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> with <HI>Pizarro</HI> and his Offi∣cers, with whom he went afterwards to <HI>Spain</HI> on board the <HI>Asia;</HI> and there having failed in his Endeavours to procure a Commission from the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> he returned to <HI>En∣gland,</HI> and attempted to get reinstated in the <HI>British</HI> Navy; and has since published a Narration of his Adventures, in which he complains of the Injustice that had been done him, and strongly disavows his ever being in
<PB N="235" REF="007859_0267_102DDC5EF29DB3E0"/>the <HI>Spanish</HI> Service: But as the Change of his religion, and his offering himself to the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> (though not accepted) are Matters which, he is conscious, are capable of being incontestably proved; on these two Heads, he has been entirely silent."</P>
<P>After Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Arrival as above re∣lated, on reading an Advertisement in the News-Paper, I found there was an Order for all the Officers and People of the <HI>Wa∣ger</HI> that were in <HI>England</HI> to repair on board Admiral <HI>Steward,</HI> in order to give their De∣positions in for a Court-Martial, to be held concerning the Loss of his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Wager.</HI> I being then in <HI>London,</HI> sent into their Lordships to acquaint them that on reading the Advertisement, I was going to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in order to comply with their Directions. I was answer'd by one of the Messengers, it was very well. The next Day being on the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> a Gentleman which was one of the Procters of <HI>Doctors-Commons,</HI> ask'd me what News now our Captain was come home? I told him I was going to <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to the Court-Martial: He then ask'd me if I knew nothing more than the Advertisement for the Court-Mar∣tial? I told him no; at which he told me,
<PB N="236" REF="007859_0268_102DDC61B24F41D8"/>that the <HI>Monday</HI> before the Advertisement was published, there were four Messengers dispatch'd from the Marshal of the Admiralty, in order to take up the Lieutenant, Boat∣swain, Myself and Carpenter. On this I re∣ply'd, if that is Fact, I will go and deliver my self up to the Marshal here in Town; finding me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix'd in my resolution, he desi∣red me to go and dine at the <HI>Paul's-Head</HI> Tavern in <HI>St. Paul's Church-Yard,</HI> where the Deputy Marshal was to dine that Day, ac∣cordingly I went, and after Dinner apply'd to him, desiring to know his Opinion in regard to the Officers of the <HI>Wager,</HI> as their Cap∣tain was come home; for that I had a near relation which was an Officer that came in that Long-boat to the <HI>Brazil,</HI> and it would give me Concern if he should suffer: His Answer was, that he believ'd we should be hang'd; to which I replied, for God's Sake for what, for not being drown'd? And is a Murderer at last come Home to be their Ac∣cuser? I have carefully perused the Journal, and can't conceive that they have been guilty of Piracy, Mutiny, not any Thing else to de∣serve it. It looks to me, if so, that their Adversaries have taken up Arms against the Power of the Almighty, for deli∣vering them. At which he said, Sir, they
<PB N="237" REF="007859_0269_102DDC6363782B70"/>have been guilty of such Things to Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> whilst a Prisoner, that I believe the Gunner and Carpenter will be hang'd, if no Body else. As I was not known to him, on these Words, I told him, then I was one of the Men that must suffer, for that I was the unfortunate Gunner of the <HI>Wager:</HI> After he was convinced, he told me, I was then be∣come his Prisoner; he had me to his House, where I was confined until the rest of the Officers were brought up to Town, which, as soon as they came up, he wrote to their Lord∣ships to inform them, that he had us all in Custody; but that I had delivered my self up to him here in Town; desiring their Lord∣ships farther Directions concerning us. The Answer received was, to send us to <HI>Portsmouth</HI> and there to deliver us up on Board Admiral <HI>Steward,</HI> to take a receipt, and to take parti∣cular Care that the Gunner and Carpenter did not make their escape. After on Board of Admiral <HI>Steward,</HI> we were told we were to be hang'd, nay, not a Letter came from any of our Friends, but there were these Words mentioned, <HI>you are to be hang'd!</HI> When the Captain came down to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> some of my Friends waited on him, desiring to know what he had to alledge against us? His Answer was, <HI>Gentlemen, I have nothing to say for nor
<PB N="238" REF="007859_0270_102DC70920A1B2E0"/>against the Villains, until the Day of Tryal, and then it is not in my Power to be off from hang∣ing them.</HI> This Expression occasioned the whole Place to believe it would be so. On the <HI>Sunday</HI> following we were had up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Pray∣ers, where there was a great Congregation, the Text was taken out of the Psalms, <HI>Them that go down to the Deep, and occupy their Business in great Waters,</HI> see the Works of the Lord.</P>
<P>In the Latter Part of this Sermon, these Words were apply'd; <Q>Men should not feed themselves up in vain Notions or Expecta∣tions of a reprieve or Pardon, for how of∣ten are Men deceived even at their last Mo∣ments? And Men that have seen so many Providences of the Divine Being, it's not to be doubted but they are prepared, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Hearing this Sermon gave us some reason to think, that we were to fall by the Violence of Power, contrary to the Laws of our Country. In the Evening of the same Day we were in∣formed by the Master and Gunner of the said Ship, that a certain Gentleman had sent Word that we might have the Privilege of Pen, Ink and Paper until the Day of Tryal, which was to be on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> following, and that he had made a resolution, that no Man after Sen∣tence
<PB N="239" REF="007859_0271_102DDC65ED79FBA8"/>of Death should be indulged with it on any Account.</P>
<P>All this we imagined was done on purpose to intimidate us, to retract from the Truth which was published to the World: But our great, good and just God supported and strengthened our Faith to bear with these In∣sults from Men. The next Day in the Morn∣ing came on Board the Judge Advocate, in order to take our Depositions for Trayl. When I was sent for, I was asked for a Deposition concerning the Loss, of His Majesty's Ship the <HI>Wager;</HI> I made Answer, Sir, I am surprised that you should offer to ask me for a Depo∣sition whilst a Prisoner. Sir, this is not the first, but the second Time to your Knowledge, that I have been confined on this very Occasi∣on; I always thought, or at least the Laws of my Country tell me, that when a Man is a Prisoner, he must be accused; and I take my Accuser to be Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> expecting you was come here on purpose to have given me his Charge, to prepare myself for Tryal against him. The Marshal's Answer was, <HI>Sir, this Court-Martial is only to know how the Ship was lost, therefore you must give me your Deposition in Regard to it.</HI> I answered, Sir, that is made mention of in a very particular Manner in the
<PB N="240" REF="007859_0272_102DDC686954FE60"/>Journal that is published, and by the Truth of which Book I stand or fall. He made Answer, <HI>Sir, that does not avail, you must give it us from under your own Hand Writing,</HI> I reply'd, if I do, Sir, I must take it from the Journal; which I did. The next Day came on the Tryal, where Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> alledged the Loss of the Ship on Lieutenant <HI>Robert Beans</HI> by not setting the Main-top-sail, and letting go the Anchor, according to his Orders. However it was proved by some of the Offi∣cers there, the Impossibility of it. After being examined about the Loss of the Ship, was or∣der'd by the Court to withdraw; some time af∣ter was order'd into Court again, where was read, <HI>We do Honourably acquit Captain</HI> David Cheap, <HI>with the Rest of his Officers, from the Loss of His Majesty's Ship the</HI> Wager, <HI>excepting Lieu∣tenant</HI> Robert Beans, <HI>who has disobey'd his Cap∣tain's Orders, by not setting the Main-top-sail, and letting go the Anchor, as ordered; however, in Regard to his Hardships and Misfortunes, do also acquit him with a Reprimand from the Court.</HI></P>
<P>In this Day's Proceedings we beheld the great and glorious Power of the Almighty, in plead-our Cause, and defending us from falling by the Violence of Men. In about a Week's time after, I went to <HI>London,</HI> and writ unto their
<PB N="241" REF="007859_0273_102DDC6B050C1570"/>Lordships for Wages, receiving no Answer, apply'd to some of their Lordships in Per∣son, one of which was pleased to ask me if I was not one of the Men that published the Book? I made Answer, I was; to this he replyed, <Q>How dare you presume to touch a Gentleman's Character in so publick a Manner as you have done? Do you think that Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> has nothing to say in Vindication of his Character? He will no doubt call you to an Account for it: We have not heard as yet, what he has to Charge you with, therefore no Wages, nor any Thing else can be done for you, unless a Hearing from him.</Q> I made Answer, My Lord, I was honourably acquitted with him, and the Book that is published has put it out of the Power of Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> to al∣ledge any Thing against us. His Lordship answer'd, <HI>I wish you may clear your Point in it.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning I delivered a Letter to his Lordship, as follows,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>On this Letter their Lordships were pleas∣ed to order the Wages to be paid to the Time the Ship was lost.</P>
<P>I take this Opportunity, to recommend to the candid reader, the perusal of that ex∣cellent Book, entitled, <HI>The Christian Patern, or, The Imitation of Jesus Christ, by Thomas a Kempis;</HI> which Book I brought with me through the various Scenes, Changes, and Chances of the Voyage, and Providence made it, the Means of comforting me. One Thing more, I pray to recommend to the Natives of <HI>N.

<P>Shortly after receiving the Wages for the <HI>Wager,</HI> I was made Master of the <HI>Royal George</HI> Cutter, employed in his Majesty's Ser∣vice. I think it my Duty to make publick the following Order, in order to convince some People in the World, that I was not thought altogether unworthy to serve, giving full Satisfaction to the Gentlemen my Employers. This Cutter was about seventy Tuns, had 60 Men, 10 Carriage Guns, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Swivels, and rowed with 18 Oars.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding my thus being appoint∣ed to the Command of the said Cutter, yet, I afterwards, upon maturely considering it, declined the Service; she being too small to bear the Sea; which was verify'd in her Cruise, for she founder'd in the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> and every Man in her was drowned.</P>
<P>About this Time arrived in <HI>England Sa∣muel Cooper, John Andrews,</HI> and <HI>Isaac Morris,</HI> three of the Men left on the Coast of <HI>Pata∣gonia,</HI> as mentioned <HI>Page</HI> 160 the Narrative they gave of their Sufferings, is as follows:</P>
<Q>A <HI>NARRATIVE</HI> of the Distresses, &amp;c. of Eight of the Crew of the Long Boat, who were left on Shore by the Lieutenant of the <HI>Wager</HI> on an uninhabited Part of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> mentioned in this Book, <HI>Page 160,</HI> and taken from the Ac∣count of <HI>Isaac Morris</HI> (one of the Men) who arrived in <HI>England,</HI> July, <HI>1746.</HI></Q>
<P>ON the 14th of <HI>January,</HI> 1741-2, the Wind blew hard at E. S. E. and we saw our Vessel stretching further off, and soon after we received, in a scuttled Cask, a few Ne∣cessaries,
<PB N="245" REF="007859_0277_102DDC75AF29DE28"/>with Ammunition, and a Letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>p. 162,</HI> for the Reasons for leaving these unhappy Men ashore.</NOTE>to acquaint us of the risque they should run in lying near the Shore, and that they were obliged to stand farther off for their own Safety till the Weather should be more fa∣vourable. Next Morning we expected they would have stretch'd in for the Land; but, to our great Surprize, we saw the Schooner with her Ensign hoisted at the Topping-lift, and under Sail from us.</P>
<P>The dismal Apprehension we were under at such an unexpected Stroke, appeared plain∣ly in our Countenances, and are much ea∣sier to be imagin'd than described. We found ourselves on a wild desolate Part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World, fatigued, sickly, and destitute of Pro∣visions. 'Tis true we had Arms and Ammu∣nition, and, whilst that lasted, made a toler∣able Shift for a Livelihood. The nearest in∣habited Place we knew of was <HI>Buenos-Ayres,</HI> about three hundred Miles to the N. W. but at present we were in a very poor Condi∣tion to undertake such an hazardous Journey, being so miserably reduced by our tedious Passage thro' the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> No∣thing remained but to commit ourselves to
<PB N="246" REF="007859_0278_102DDC77B3CB9908"/>kind Providence, and make the best of our melancholy Situation, till we had recruited ourselves.</P>
<P>We were in Number eight who were thus abandoned by our Crew, for whose Preserva∣tion we risqued our Lives, in swimming ashore for Provisions. Our Names were <HI>Guy Broad∣water, Samuel Cooper, Benjamin Smith, John Duck, Jos. Clinch, John Andrews, John Allen,</HI> and myself. After deliberating upon our un∣happy Circumstances, and comforting each other with imaginary Hopes, we came to a resolution of taking up our Quarters on the Beach where we landed, till we should grow strong enough to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey to <HI>Buenos-Ayres.</HI> The Weather being very favourable, we took up our Lodg∣ing in a Trench near the Sea-side, quite ex∣posed, without any Covering but the Hea∣vens. Here we stay'd about a Month, du∣ring which Time we lived upon Seal, which were very plenty, and which we knocked down with Stones after we had cut off their retreat, by getting between them and the Sea. Here was likewise plenty of fresh Water, from a small Spring which rose out of the Trench; so that, at the Month's End, we had pretty well recover'd ourselves, and
<PB N="247" REF="007859_0279_102DDC798E579D98"/>concluded upon laying in a Stock of Provi∣sions for our Journey to <HI>Buenos-Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>Having provided ourselves each with a Knapsack, which we made of Seal-skin, in the best Manner we could, we put into it as much dried Seal as we could carry, and their Bladders we filled with Fresh Water, which served us for Bottles. We took our Muskets and Ammunition with us, and, thus accoutred, we set out on our Journey about the Middle of <HI>February;</HI> and, that we might proceed with the more Certainty, we were determined to keep close to the Sea-side till we should come to the Mouth of the <HI>River Plate.</HI> The first two Days we travelled about sixty Miles, but could meet with no fresh Water, besides what we brought with us, the Country being scorch'd with Drought, and the rains not yet set in. Our Water be∣ing near expended, we were afraid to proceed, lest we should perish for want of more; so, after a few Debates, we agreed to return back to our old Quarters, and wait till the rainy Season. We were two Days and a half on our return, after which we employ'd ourselves in building a Sort of Hut under a Cliff adjoining the Sea-side, to secure us from the Inclemencies of the Weather. Here we tarried three Months, during which Time
<PB N="248" REF="007859_0280_102DDC7BCF1F9500"/>our Food was Seals and Armadillos, which was the only Provision to be met with here, except Sea-weed, which we sometimes made use of with our Meat instead of Bread. The Seal here differ from those which I have seen in other Parts, both in Size and Make. The Males are the Bigness of a good Calf; their Neck is shaggy; their Head and Face is somewhat like a Lion's. The Females are like Lionesses before, but their Hair is smooth all over like an Horse's, whereas the Male is smooth only on his hinder Parts. From the hinder Part grow two large Fins like Feet, and two more out of the Breast, by Means of which they can climb rocks and Precipices, tho' they delight chiefly to lie asleep near the Shore. Some are fourteen Feet long, and very fat; but in general they are about eight Feet: The Flesh of the young ones is almost as white as Lamb, and tolerable good Eating. From the Shoulders to the Tail they grow tapering like Fish; and when the Females give suck to their Young they sit upon their Fins, which grow out of their hinder Part. Their Hair is of different Colours, looking very sleek when they come first out of the Sea.</P>
<P>The Armadillo is as big nearly as a small Sucking-Pig, the Body of it pretty large.
<PB N="249" REF="007859_0281_102DDC7DB975B780"/>It is inclosed in a thick Shell, which guards all its Back, and comes down on both Sides, meeting under the Belly, leaving room for the four Legs; the Head is small, with a Nose like a Hedgehog, and a pretty long Neck, which it thrusts out before its Body when it walks, but on any Danger she draws it in under the Shell, and, thrusting in her Feet, she lies stock-still like a Land Turtle, and tho' you kick her about she will not move herself. The Shell is jointed in the Middle of the Back, so that she can turn the fore Part of her Body which Way she pleases; the Feet are like those of a Land Turtle, and it has strong Claws, with which it digs Holes in the Ground, and burrows in them like a rabbit. Its Flesh is very good Eating, and tastes much like a Turtle.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happen'd to us in these three Months. Our Provisions, such as they were, were not very difficult to be pro∣cured, and we were supplied with Fire-wood enough from a small Wood or Coppice a∣bout seven Miles from us. We seldom fail∣ed of bringing home something every Night, and generally had a hot Supper. We pas∣sed our Time as chearful as poor Fellows in our Circumstances could. But we knew we could not take up this Place for our set∣tled
<PB N="250" REF="007859_0282_102DDC7FADE26DF0"/>Abode; and there was no Likelihood of any Inhabitants near us, nor for many Miles round could we perceive the least Traces of any ever having been there; and 'twas to no Purpose to expect the Sight of any Vessel off at Sea; for, it being a deep Bay, and shoal Water, no Ships ever put in there, unless forced by Stress of Weather, and then they must be wrecked. Nothing remain'd for us but to make a second Attempt for the river <HI>Plate;</HI> for, if we should march to the Inland Country in quest of Inhabitants, possibly we should meet with insuperable Difficulties in finding the Way back again to what I may call our Home; whereas if we kept our Course along the Sea-shore we could not err. For which reasons we resolved upon another Attempt by the same rout, and, having laid in our Stock of Seal, Armadillos, and fresh Water, towards the latter End of <HI>May,</HI> we set forward once more.</P>
<P>In three Days we travelled about seventy Miles; when towards Night, there came on a violent Storm of rain, Thunder and Light∣ning, which continued the whole Night: We had a plain open Country, and no Place of Shelter could be found; we had nothing to cover us but a Seal-skin Jacket, were half dead with Cold, and afraid how our Provi∣sions
<PB N="251" REF="007859_0283_102DDC81EFDD1510"/>would hold out; for we met with no Supplies of any Kind by the Way. To proceed farther was only lengthening our Journey back again, which we feared, would be the Consequence at last, even tho' we should still push on. There had been the strictest Harmony and Good-nature between us till now; but now we were like to have disagreed even to parting. Some were for pushing forward, be the Event what it might; and 'twas with Difficulty they were perswaded not to divide. However, upon a representation of the great Distance we were as yet from the Mouth of the river, and the Improbability of meeting with Supplies of Provision by the Way, our Debates ended, and we jointly concluded on making the best of our Way back to our Hut, having been a second Time disappointed in our At∣tempt.</P>
<P>After being arrived at our old Quarters, we began to consult what Measures to take for our Security from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and to provide for our Subsistence, till it should please God, one Way or other, to deliver us out of this Melancholy Situa∣tion. In order to avoid Disputes about the laborious Part of getting Provisions, we a∣greed to divide ourselves into two Parties,
<PB N="252" REF="007859_0284_102DDC83B61EC838"/>who were, alternately, to provide for the Whole: Four were appointed to scour the Country one Day, and the other four the next. And we had bound ourselves by an Oath never to quit each other, unless obli∣ged by a superior Force; for tho' we had as yet seen no Footsteps of Inhabitants, we could not be certain there were none on this Part of the Globe. We had killed such a Number of Seal, that they now became ve∣ry shy of us, and had lived upon them so long that we were almost surfeited; yet there was hardly any thing else to be met with. We saw a great Number of wild Dogs, but could never come near enough to kill any; tho' now and then we chanced to shoot a Puppy, which, as it was change of Diet, we thought delicious Fare. We saw also some Deer, but could contrive no Method to take them. One Day in our rambles, we met with a Litter of young Puppies: they were but three, and seemed to be about two Months old, and taken Shelter in a Hole of one of the Sand-hills. We took 'em out, and brought 'em home to our Hut. Having dis∣cover'd that these Puppies were whelped in Holes like those of rabbits but larger, we went all out the next Day in quest of more, and had the good Luck to find three Litters, in
<PB N="253" REF="007859_0285_102DDC86141FAC20"/>Number thirteen, which we carried home with us, designing if possible, to bring them up tame. We fed them with Broth made of Seals, and sometimes with the Flesh minced small; and they afterwards became very ser∣viceable to us. Each of us had his Brace of Dogs, which were brought up under as much Command as an <HI>English</HI> Spaniel, nor would they leave us to associate with the wild Ones; they often supplied us with Ar∣madillos, and once they killed us a Deer. Be∣ing one Day hunting, we saw some wild Hogs, with their Young; our Dogs pursued them, and took two of the Young, which we saved alive; and we shot one of the old Ones, which afforded us many dainty Sup∣pers. The young ones proved to be a Boar and a Sow, which was very fortunate, and we designed to rear them for Breeding, lest we should be obliged to a long residence in this desolate Country. We brought them up very tame, insomuch that they followed our Dogs when ever we went a hunting; and at Night both Dogs and Pigs, took up their Lodging with us in our Hut.</P>
<P>For the present our Condition seemed to∣lerable; nay, we thought ourselves in very comfortable Circumstances: We wanted for nothing, and, if we could have confined our
<PB N="254" REF="007859_0286_102DDC88158DE9F0"/>Thoughts to present Enjoyments, our Situa∣tion was very agreeable. But our Views were farther, and the Fears of what might happen frequently struck a Damp on our Pleasures. Winter was now approaching; we had the Inclemencies of the Season to guard against, and if possible, a Stock of Pro∣visions to be laid up against future Emergen∣cies. but we could not be much before∣hand with Provisions, having no Salt to cure them, and at present not Sun enough to dry them; for with Winter came on continual Storms, with rains, insomuch that some Days we could not stir out of our Hut.</P>
<P>'Twas now more than seven Months since the Long-boat left us. Winter came on very fast, and we were but badly secured from the Severity of the Weather. We resolved im∣mediatety to put our Habitation in Order, and to secure our Hut in the best Manner we could. Accordingly it was agreed that six should stay at home next Day to prepare Ma∣terials, and two only to go out after Pro∣visions, the Lot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon myself and <HI>John Duck,</HI> to go ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d: All the Game we could meet with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e three Armadillos, tho's we travelled many Miles. 'Twas so dark before we returned, that we despaired of finding our Hut, and were like to have taken up our
<PB N="255" REF="007859_0287_102DDC8A617A7EE0"/>Lodging in the open Plain, if our Comrades had not come out in quest of us, and, by making a Fire, directed us towards them. After we had broiled our Game, and fed heartily, about Twelve we went to sleep. But, about Two in the Morning, a violent Storm, with rain, Thunder, and Lightning, threw down Part of the Cliff upon us, under which we had built our Hut, and was very near proving fatal to us all; but, thro' Pro∣vidence, none were hurt. With Day-light came on tolerable Weather; and now the first Thing we had to do was to rebuild our Hut. We immediately went to the Coppice where we used to seek our Fire-wood, in order to fell some Poles. As we had but one Hatchet betwixt us, one only could fell them, and the rest of us brought them out and bundled 'em. We had cut several, and were bundling them, when we saw <HI>Jos. Clinch</HI> running out of the Wood, and crying, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us, here's a great Tyger.</HI> We were in the utmost Consternation; for having been frequently there before, and never once seeing any Foot∣steps of Wild Beasts, we came without our Arms, suspecting no Danger from that Quar∣ter. We all took to our Heels, and soon saw him running out of the Wood in Pursuit of us. When he was come within twenty
<PB N="256" REF="007859_0288_102DDC8D2DE367F0"/>Yards of us, finding it impossible to escape him, we all turned towards him, clapping our Hands, and making a loud Holo, in order to frighten him, which had the desired Ef∣fect; for he immediately sat back on his Tail, gazing at us. What to do we knew not, whe∣ther 'twas best to fly, or wait for his turning; but Fear prevailed, and we walked gently off, without his pursuing us. Next Day we all went with our Muskets in Chace of him, but could not meet with him. We brought home our Poles, and fitted up our Hut in the best Manner we could, sufficient to guard us from the rain.</P>
<P>About three Weeks after, when we were hunting on the Plain, about four Miles from home, we saw a Lion couched on the Ground, watching his Prey, as we imagin'd, it being close by a wild Cat's Hole. We joined close together in a Body, with our Muskets ready; and <HI>Jos. Clinch</HI> fired a Ball at him at twenty Yards Distance, resting his Piece on my Shoul∣der, but miss'd him: The Lion took no No∣tice of the report of the Gun, nor stirred from his Posture. He charged a second Time, ours being kept in readiness in Case he should advance towards us; he fired, and shot him in the right Shoulder; he fell on his Back, and we ran to him, and knock'd him in the
<PB N="267" REF="007859_0289_102DDC8F70878DB0"/>Head with the Bones of a dead Horse which lay near him. We carried him to our Hut, dress'd his Heart and Part of his ribs; but 'twas very indifferent Eating.</P>
<P>Finding ourselves beginning to be surround∣ed with wild Beasts, and every Day and Night in continual Danger (for we now seldom went abroad without meeting some Beast of Prey; this being, I suppose, the Time of Year when they take their Haunts towards the Sea-coast), we determin'd to make another Push for our Deliverance, and try our Fortune once more in an Expedition to <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> In order hereto we provided ourselves Shoes and Jack∣ets of Seal-skins, and made ourselves Knap∣sacks of the same to carry our Provender. The Weather was set in fair, and we were fully determin'd to lay in such a Stock of Pro∣visions as should last us to the End of our Journey, if we should be a Month in per∣forming it. To this End we divided ourselves into two Parties; four of us were to go to the rocks for Seal, and the other four to hunt on the Plain. Accordingly we set out early in the Morning: 'twas my Lot, with <HI>Sam. Coop∣er, John Andrews,</HI> and <HI>John Duck,</HI> to go to the rocks. Our usual Way in killing Seal being with Stones or Clubs, we never carried our Muskets with us, we had been out all Day,
<PB N="268" REF="007859_0290_102DDC91C8AC8CF0"/>and killed three; and in the Dusk of the Even∣ing, when we were got within a Stone's Cast of our Hut, I perceiv'd our Dogs very busy at a small Distance, wagging their Tails in a very fondling Manner. Being a-head of my Companions, I passed on without much regard∣ing it, thinking they had lighted on a dead Colt. But when I came to the Hut, I was quite confounded: The Hut was rifled, and all our Necessaries taken away. In the ut∣most Consternation I ran back to my Com∣rades, whom I saw standing where I had left the Dogs: Seeing me running eagerly towards them, they cry'd out, <HI>What's the Matter,</HI> Isaac? I told them our Hut was pull'd down, and e∣very thing taken away. <HI>Ay,</HI> said they, <HI>and something worse has happened; for yonder lie poor</HI> Guy Broad-water <HI>and</HI> Ben. Smith <HI>murder'd.</HI> 'Twas a most shocking Sight: One had his Throat cut and the other was stabb'd in the Breast; they were hardly cold, so we thought the Murderers could not be far off. And we were under no small Apprehension of sharing a like Fate. We went to the Hut to inspect more narrowly, and found every thing taken away; our Powder, Ball, and Muskets gone, the Fire extinguish'd, and not the least Uten∣sil left. Where to go or what to do we knew not. We durst not trust ourselves another
<PB N="269" REF="007859_0291_102DDC93FA8CC8E8"/>Night on this fatal Spot, and yet were afraid to venture farther. At last we came to a re∣solution of going to the next sandy Bay, about a Mile off, and take up our Quarters there for that Night: But, when there, we could find no Shelter, not so much as a Cliff to lie under; so were obliged to return to our old Place, and pass the Night there, happen what would. Next Morning the Dogs which belonged to our Comrades stood on the Top of the Cliff barking at us, and would not come down, tho' we called them by their Names; and 'twas with Difficulty we enticed them down in the Evening. What became of <HI>Jos. Clinch</HI> and <HI>John Allen</HI> we knew not, nor could we after∣wards learn any Account of them: What seem'd most probable to us was, that the <HI>In∣dians</HI> had carried them off, and murder'd the other two, who possibly might make some re∣sistance, as we had all agreed to do, in Case we should be attack'd; but, if so, we might probably have expected to have found some or other of their Enemies killed, as our People had Fire-Arms with them. And it was im∣possible it could be the result of a Quarrel a∣mongst themselves, from the Manner of their Death; for one was stabb'd, and the other had his Throat cut, both very plainly done with a Knife, an Instrument which none of
<PB N="270" REF="007859_0292_102DDC964CD942C8"/>us had the Possession of. We buried 'em in the the best Manner we could, by scraping a∣way the light Sand with our Hands two Feet deep, and raising a Bed of Sand over the Corpses.</P>
<P>This was the most afflicting Stroke of any we received since our residence in this unhap∣py Country. I won't pretend to describe the Horrors we felt; the compassionate reader will paint our Distress in his Imagination in stronger Colours than can be described by Words. To see four of our Companions snatched from us suddenly we knew not how, ourselves deprived of our Arms and Utensils, left without Fire, or any Method of procur∣ing it, expecting every Moment to share their Fate, or to be starved to Death, filled us with unspeakable Terrors.</P>
<P>In this melancholy State the only thing that remain'd to be done was immediately to quit this unhappy Place, and make one Attempt more for <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> We had no Time to lose, but instantly set about tearing up the Seal in small Pieces, raw as it was, with which we filled our Knapsacks, and their Bladders we filled with Water, lest we should find none on our Journey. Having furnish'd our∣selves with as much Provision as we could carry, we set forward on our Journey, with
<PB N="271" REF="007859_0293_102DC7076EA400A0"/>our sixteen Dogs and two Pigs; praying the Almighty to be our Guide. We kept close along the Sea Coast, as we had done be∣fore, by which Means we could not miss the <HI>River Plate;</HI> where when we should arrive our Design was to travel along the Side of that river till we should come to some inhabi∣ted Place: A Scheme easy enough in Ima∣gination, but in Practice attended, as we found, with insuperable Difficulties.</P>
<P>The Sea Coast all along is a plain sandy Beach; on the Land Side are here and there very high Sand-hills: In the Valleys of those Hills we reposed ourselves at Night. On the Beach we sometimes found some Cockles, which the Sea had wash'd in; these were a great Dainty to us. We met with Part of the Wreck of a large Ship which was drove upon the Beach, particularly a Man of War's Gang∣board, and a Piece of Plank mark'd fifteen Foot. In the Valleys of the Sand-hills was Plenty of Water, which had been ponded up after the rains; and we frequently met with dead Fish thrown in upon the Beach; so that we had a Variety of raw Meat to feed upon. We also found by the Sea-side a very large dead Whale which was a Feast for our Dogs and Pigs, and at a little Distance a Parcel of fine Whale-bone.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="007859_0294_102DDC9A32B9EE70"/>
At the End of ten Days we made the Cape of the river, having travelled very hard every Day, and met with tolerable Weather, but when we got there we found a Multitude of small rivers and muddy Swamps to obstruct us. We swam over several of them, with our Knapsacks across our Shoulders; and when Night came on we cover'd ourselves with the rushes, but were almost devour'd by Muske∣toes. Next Day we made several Attempts to proceed farther, but found it impossible to accomplish our Journey; the farther we went the greater Difficulties we met with. We were several times in Danger of being suffo∣cated, the Bog often sinking us to the Shoul∣ders; so that, after many fruitless Attempts to proceed, we found we had no remedy left but to tread back the melancholy Path, and return to our old Place of rendezvous; which we performed in less than ten Days.</P>
<P>At our return we were afraid to ramble far abroad, having neither Arms nor Ammunition to defend ourselves from the Wild Beasts. Our two Pigs maintained us near a Fortnight, and afterwards we were obliged to live upon some of our trusty Dogs; but this raw Way of feeding, which continued three Months long∣er, brought us into an ill State of Health. About a Quarter of a Mile from our Hut we
<PB N="273" REF="007859_0295_102DDC9CECADA328"/>found a dead Horse, of which now and then we took a Morsel, by Way of Change; and could we have got Fire to dress it, the Vari∣ety would have been agreeable enough. Not∣withstanding our Fears, Necessity compell'd us to go abroad in Search of other kind of Provisions, and sometimes we had the good Fortune to bring home an Armadillo.</P>
<P>One Morning we found the Trunk of a large Tree, and imagined 'twas not impossi∣ble, with the Help of the Skins of Seal and Horses, to make a Sort of a Boat with it, which might serve to convey us along Shore to the river <HI>Plate.</HI> But we had no kind of Tool to use. <HI>J. Duck</HI> recollected that about eleven Months before, at the End of our first Attempt for <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> he threw away his Musket, it being a very indifferent one, and not worth the trouble of bringing home, ha∣ving enough besides for our Use. We pro∣posed to go in Search of it, which if we could find might serve to make a Hatchet, Acoord∣ingly we furnish'd ourselves with some ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seal and Water, went, and found the Musket, tho' above sixty Miles. On our return home we found several Ostriches Eggs, about half buried in the Sand, which was a refreshing Meal to us (tho' we never met with any of the Birds.) When we brought it home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="274" REF="007859_0296_102DDC9F373C07A8"/>beat half the length of the Barrel flat with Stones, and whetted an Edge to it against a rock, the other Half served for the Handle, and it made a tolerable Hatchet; at least what would have served instead of one, if Provi∣dence had not put an End to our Design in the following Manner.</P>
<P>Two Days after we had finished our Hatch∣et, it being my Turn to stay in the Hut, my three Comrades went to a Place which we called the <HI>Long Point</HI> in Search of Provisions. Towards Evening I walked out to see if they were returning; when, to my Astonishment, I discover'd about a Dozen of Horses gallop∣ing down the sandy Bay towards our Hut, and, as they came nearer, I plainly saw Men on their Backs, and that they were <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Twas in vain to fly; I imagined nothing but Death approaching, and prepared to meet it with all the resolution I could muster up. I ran towards them, and fell on my Knees, begging my Life with all the Signs of Hu∣mility I could make; when I heard a Voice saying, <HI>Don't be afraid</HI> Isaac! <HI>we are all here.</HI> This revived me. The <HI>Indians</HI> alighted, and whilst some were intent on examining the Hut, others stood with drawn Knives, ready to dispatch us in case we made any resistance. When they had satisfied ther Curiosity they
<PB N="275" REF="007859_0297_102DDCA189963558"/>gave three confused Shouts, and immediately made us get up behind them, and carried us away a few Miles in from the Sea-shore to the S. W. where were about a Dozen more of their Companions, with upwards of four hundred Horses which they had taken in Hunt∣ing. They treated us with great Huma∣nity, killed a Horse for us, kindled a Fire, and roasted a Part of it, which to us, who had been three Months eating raw Flesh, was a most delicious Entertainment. They also gave each of us a Piece of an old Blanket to co∣ver our Nakedness. I was in great Danger, it seems, of being left alone; for when the <HI>Indians</HI> met with my three Comrades, they were immediately for hurrying them away to their Place of rendezvous, till, with Difficul∣ty they were brought to understand, by Signs, that there was one more belonging to them a little Way off; and then guided them to the Hut, where I had the Happiness of being ta∣ken Prisoner with them.</P>
<P>Next Morning we decamped from this Place, driving our Troop of Horse before us. We travelled nineteen Days before we arri∣ved at their next Place of rendezvous, which. I imagine, was about two hundred Miles from our Hut to the S. W. in a Valley be∣tween two very high Mountains, where was
<PB N="276" REF="007859_0298_102DDCA3268CCA28"/>fine Pasture for their Horses, and several small rivers of fresh Water, but very little Wood to be seen for many Miles round. In this Val∣ley were about a Dozen <HI>Indian</HI> Huts, built with Poles and the Skins of Horses, inhabi∣ted by another Party of <HI>Indians,</HI> with their Wives and Children, who gazed very earnest∣ly on us, as tho' they had never seen any White People before. Here we were bought and sold four different Times for a Pair of Spurs, a Brass Pan, Ostriches Feathers, and such like Trifles, which was the low Price generally set on each of us; and sometimes we were played away at Dice; so that we chan∣ged Masters several Times in a Day. In this Place we remained near a Month, by which Time the several Parties of <HI>Indians</HI> had re∣turned from their Hunting, and joined us, each Party bringing the Horses they had ta∣ken in hunting, and mixing them all in the common Stock; which were examin'd and told over by one of the <HI>Indians</HI> who seemed to be a sort of a Captain over the rest, and they amounted to the Number of fifteen Hundred and upwards, some of which were no way inferior to the best of our <HI>European</HI> Breed.</P>
<P>After one Day's grand Feasting, we set out in a Body for their Chief Town, where the
<PB N="277" REF="007859_0299_102DDCA5D94E6C90"/>King, or Captain, lived, with fifteen hundred String of Horses in our Cavalcade. We were four Months in performing our Jour∣ney, and, by the Method of our traveling, I believe it must be a thousand Miles from the Sea-Coast where our Hut stood. In the Day-time we travelled, and at Night reposed ourselves in their moveable Huts, which shelter'd us from the Weather. Our con∣stant Food was Horse-flesh, which some chose to eat raw, and others broiled or roasted; and, as for Drink, we never fail'd of Water; for I found they were well acquainted with every small rivulet, of which there are Num∣bers in the rout they took, tho' a Stranger would hardly have found them.</P>
<P>At length we arrived to the End of our Journey, the Chief Town, where the King lives; but our Masters who had made the last Purchase of us were carrying us with them to their own Home (which we learnt after∣wards was about two hundred Miles beyond the Town where the King resided) and had carried us some Miles; when a Party of Horse came after us, and brought us back to the Capital, the King claiming us as his Proper∣ty. This Town consists of about 30 Huts, built, in a low irregular Manner, with Poles and Horses Skins, surrounded with Palisadoes,
<PB N="278" REF="007859_0300_102DE9254F597D38"/>about three Foot Distance from each other. The Inhabitants, Men, Women, and Chil∣dren, were about fourscore. We were soon summoned to appear before his Majesty, who received us in his Hut, sitting on the Ground, with a Javelin on one Side of him, and a Bow and Arrows on the other, a loose Man∣tle round his Waist, and a sort of Turret of Ostriches Feathers on his Head, and a long reed Pipe in his Mouth, smoaking. After paying our Obedience to him, he began to ask us several Questions in <HI>Spanish,</HI> of which they all can speak a little, which we soon let him know we understood a little of; en∣quired what Countrymen we were, and how we came to this Country. We told him we were <HI>Englishmen,</HI> lost in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> in an <HI>English</HI> Man of War, as we were going to fight against our Enemies the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> that we were eight in Number who were left on a desolate Part of the Continent; that one Evening, on our return from getting Provi∣sion, we found two of our Companions mur∣dered, and two more carried off, on the Spot of Ground where we were taken, our Hut pull'd down, and every thing taken from us; which we supposed must be done by some of his Countrymen. He then called three or four of his Men, and talked very
<PB N="279" REF="007859_0301_102DC71041874410"/>earnestly to them in their own Language. But it seems they knew nothing of the Af∣fair, as he told us; tho' he was pleased to assure us strict Enquiry should be made of the other Parties which were out at the same Time. For I found by him, that he sends out several different Parties every Spring from every different Town under his Govern∣ment, who take different routs, and some∣times join one another accidentally on their return. But of this more hereafter. When he found we were at War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he express'd a great deal of Joy, and ask'd if we were Great Men in our Country. We told him yes. He said the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were great Enemies to them, had took away their Country from them, and drove them to the Mountains. When he had done examining us, he ordered a Horse to be killed immedi∣ately and dress'd for us; and lodged us in his own Hut for that Night, till we had one built for us, which was the next Day. Here we staid eight Months, and winter'd, during which Time we had frequently Snow five or six Feet deep. Our Work was chief∣ly to fetch Wood and Water, and skin all the Horses which they killed; and tho' we were their Slaves, we were treated very humanely, and they would suffer no one to use us ill.
<PB N="280" REF="007859_0302_102DDCA7F6EAF1D8"/>There were four <HI>Spanish</HI> Women in the Town, whom they had taken captive in a Skirmish near <HI>Buenos-Ayres;</HI> and the King told us, with a Smile, he would give us each a Wife.</P>
<P>The Country where these <HI>Indians</HI> resided, as indeed the whole Coast of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> is ve∣ry fruitful in Pasture, and abounds with great Plenty of wild Horses, and a few black Cat∣tle, which are entirely neglected by the <HI>In∣dians;</HI> Horse-flesh being preferr'd by them for eating, before any other Kind of Flesh, and what they constantly feed upon. 'Tis situated in a very healthy Climate, and, if the Soil was cultivated, would certainly pro∣duce Plenty of all Kind of Crain. They have likewise Plenty of Wood, tho' few or no Timber Trees, several large Coppices grow∣ing all round the Country, tho' near the Sea-side we see nothing but a plain open sand∣dy Coast.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patagonian Indians,</HI> at least those in that Part of the Country where we resided, were tall and well-made, being in general, from five to six Feet high, good-natur'd and obliging to one another, and never see each other Want. Tho' they have what they call a King, yet he seems to be only a Chief or Captain of a Party; for, as they have no set∣led Abode, but live scattered throughout that
<PB N="281" REF="007859_0303_102DDCAA976CEED8"/>Part of the World in little Towns or Parties, each Party seems to have a Chief, who pro∣fides over them like a Petty King. I never could observe any rules of Government a∣mong 'em; but in a Drinking-bout King and Subjects are all alike. Their King is distin∣guish'd from the rest by his being the big∣gest Man, and by wearing a kind of Sash round his Waist. 'Tis true he has a Defe∣rence paid him by his Subjects, and whatever he orders to be done is immediately per∣formed, being himself exempted from any kind of Work; but I never saw any Punish∣ments inflicted by him, nor any Quarrels a∣mong themselves, except when they get at a Drinking-Feast, and then their Wives always took Care no ill Consequence should follow, by putting every Weapon out of their Way, and especially taking Care of their Knives. For which reason I imagine that in Liquor they are always quarrelsome. One or two Instances of that Kind happen'd whilst we were among them. Their Method of Feast∣ing is this: They have in the Summer a Plen∣ty of small sweet Berries growing like our Whortle Berries, and when they have pro∣cured a sufficient Quantity of them, they dig a Pit in the Ground, about four Feet square, the Bottom and Sides of which they line
<PB N="282" REF="007859_0304_102DDCAC399420A8"/>with Horse Hides. This Cask (if I may so call it) they half fill with these Berries, and then fill it up with Water, which they stir well with Sticks, and afterwards leave it to ferment about forty eight Hours. They all sit round, smoaking and drinking, for a whole Night together, Women as well as Men, sing∣ing in their Way, but more like shrieking Cries; and when drunk frequently proceed to Blows.</P>
<P>They seldom live long in one Place; for when their Horses have eat up the Pasture in one Place, they remove their Town and all their Goods, which is soon done, a few Miles from the Former; and this several Times in the Year; so that they have no settled Place of Abode. They have scatter'd Habitations all over the Country, and but few Huts together: The Town where their Chief resides has three times the Number of Dwellings to any of the rest which I saw.</P>
<P>They seem to have some Notion of a Deity, and pay a sort of Worship to the Sun and Moon; especially at every New Moon, they collect themselves in a Body, and make a so∣lemn Procession round the Town, one going before with a kind of Hoop in his Hand, round which are tied little Brass Bells a∣dorn'd with Ostriches Feathers, which he
<PB N="283" REF="007859_0305_102DE8FBD8806660"/>would frequently swing round in his Hand; and then the whole Company would make a most hideous Noise, which, I suppose, they designed for Singing. This Ceremony usual∣ly lasted about half an Hour. This Method with their Hoop and Bells is likewise used when any of them are sick or dying. A white Flannel Cloth is hung up before the sick Person, and the Man with his Hoops and Bells, who is generally one of his relati∣ons, comes to visit him; and after a few Mi∣nutes Conversation, he leaves him, and walks several times round the Hut, jingling his Bells, and talking aloud in a variety of Ac∣cents which we could understand nothing of, but imagined he designed it for Prayers for his sick Friend. When any of 'em dies, they soon bury him, generally the next Morning. They roll the Dead Body in a Hide, with eve∣ry Thing that belongs to him, as Bows, Ar∣rows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and carry it, without any Ceremony, at some Distance from the Town; where they throw it into a large round Pit, dug on pur∣pose, which they afterwards fill up with Earth. Yet notwithstandind they have no Ceremony at their Funeral, their Mourning for the Dead is very strict, which the Friends of the Deceased observe for three Months; during which Time they remove themselves
<PB N="284" REF="007859_0306_102DE8FE65A106B0"/>at a Distance from any of the rest of the Hou∣ses, and converse with nobody; but are sup∣plied with Provisions from the whole Town, by the King's Order, 'till the Time of Mourn∣ing is over. They seem to have some Notion of the Devil, at least are afraid of Apparitions; for none of 'em will stir out of his Hut, when dark, without Company. And one Night in particular we heard a great Noise in the Town, like several Drums beating, which, the next Day, we found to be some of the <HI>Indians</HI> beating the Sides of their Houses, which were made of Horse-Skins, with large Sticks, in or∣der to frighten away the Devil.</P>
<P>Each <HI>Indian</HI> has but one Wife, and they live together in a very loving Manner. When any of 'em lye-in, there's a Provision made for them different from what they are acco∣modated with at another Time; for the En∣trance of the Hut, which at other Times is al∣ways open, is shut up with Horses-Skins as soon as the Woman begins to be in Tra∣vail; and no one goes in till she comes out with the Child in her Arms, which is pre∣sently wrapt up in a Sheep's Skin, and, instead of a Bed or Cradle, is lain an a Machine some∣what like our Hand-barrow, the Bottom of which is likewise covered with a Sheep's Skin. This is hung up by the four Corners,
<PB N="285" REF="007859_0307_102DE900C6CF58E0"/>and the Child swings forwards and back∣wards, instead of being rock'd in a Cradle, its Arms and Legs being fasten'd to this En∣gine by a Lash of Horse-skin, to prevent its falling over. By this Method of Treatment, when Children, the back Part of all the <HI>Indians</HI> Heads are very flat; for they never lay them but on their Backs. Perhaps it may be ow∣ing to this likewise that there is not a crooked Person amongst them. In two or three Hours after they have lain-in they go about their usual Work. Every Morning they take all their Children, young and old, and carry them to the next Brook or rivulet adjoin∣ing, and plunge them naked under Water, even when the ground is covered with Snow; by which Means they are harden'd to run a∣bout naked, even in the Midst of Winter. The Men wear Beads and little Bells round their Neck, Wrist, and small of their Legs; and the Women adorn their long Hair with the same. For such Trifles as these, toge∣ther with Knives, Brass Pans, and such like, they traffick their Hides with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when at Peace with them.</P>
<P>And now their Time for making the Hunt∣ing Voyage approaching, which they conti∣nually do every Spring, and generally spend a whole Summer in taking their wild Horses,
<PB N="286" REF="007859_0308_102DE903EB9C0830"/>we made great Intercession to go with them; but were given to understand, that we must be sent farther into the Country, to remain with other <HI>Indians</HI> till their return. But at last we prevailed, by assuring the Chief that the <HI>English</HI> had Friends at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> who would make him very handsome Satisfaction for us, and would redeem us at any Price he should put upon us. This seemed to please him, and he then consented. We were at present about 1000 Miles from <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI> and their rout extends to the Eastern Coast of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> home to the Sea, about an hun∣dred Miles to the Southward of <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> When they set out, they carry with them e∣very Thing belonging to them, Women, Chil∣dren, Houses, and all. These last are slung across the Horses, and at Night taken down for sheltering themselves from the Weather. They take with them a few Horses more than they ride, which serve for maintaining them till their Hunting begins, which sel∣dom happens till they have travelled seven or eight Days.</P>
<P>And now the wish'd for Time was come, when we all set out in a Body, except <HI>John Duck,</HI> whose Misfortune it was to be too near of a Complexion with those <HI>Indians</HI> (for he was a <HI>Molat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> born in <HI>London</HI>) for which
<PB N="287" REF="007859_0309_102DE9059364F358"/>reason he was sold by the Chief to a Master farther up in the Country; where, I believe, he will end his Days, there being no Prospect of his ever returning to <HI>England.</HI> We had travell'd ten or twelve Days before we had a∣ny wild Horses; but soon after several Strag∣glers sell Victims to their Ingenuity. Their Method of taking them is really astonishing, and worthy of a very particular Description. As they are excellent Horsemen, and their Hor∣ses as fleet as the wild Ones, 'tis very seldom they miss, tho' now and then an Accident of that Kind happens; but the rider is look'd upon with Contempt. They have two different Me∣thods of taking them, each of which I have seen them perform with incredible Dexteri∣ty. The first is with a Lash of Horse Skins, about two Inches Broad, and fifty Feet long, with a running Noose at one End of it. This Noose they hold in their right Hand, and the other End in the Left, till they come within a few Yards of the Beast, when they throw the Noose over his Head, even on full Speed, and hold the other End fast in their Left Hand. The Beast is soon stopt and taken. The other Method is with a narrow Strap of Horse-skin, about twelve Feet long, to each End of which is fastened a round Ball of Iron, about two Pounds Weight. When within
<PB N="288" REF="007859_0310_102DE9087757A9E0"/>Distance of their Game, they hurl one of the Balls several Times round their Head, till they have got the proper Swing, and then throw it at the Horse's Legs, parting with the Ball in their Left Hand at the same Time; which seldom fails of entangling their Legs, and throwing them to the Ground. The Horses thus taken are secured by some of the Company, whose Business is chiefly to tie these Horses together in a String, and guard them. In a few Days they become very tame. They are likewise very dextrous in killing Birds with these Balls, and will throw them to a prodigious Height in the Air. This is what they are trained up to from their Infan∣cy, and are very expert at, even in their Youth. These Iron Balls, fasten'd in the above Man∣ner, are likewise their chief warlike Wea∣pons, next to their Bows and Arrows.</P>
<P>Being now arrived within an hundred Miles of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> we begged of him to dispatch one of his Men to the Governor, to acquaint him of three <HI>English</HI> Prisoners he had with him at such a Distance, and to ask if he would redeem us; which he did. And the Messen∣ger, on his return, brought him a certain Pledge for fulfilling his Promise, which was a Gold-laced Waistcoat. Next Day we were told to get ourselves ready to go to <HI>Buenos
<PB N="289" REF="007859_0311_102DE90B0E7ED890"/>Ayres,</HI> and that he and some of his Men would go with us.</P>
<P>The Hopes of once more seeing our Fel∣low Christians filled us with Joy. We were brought immediately before the Governor, who satisfy'd our <HI>Indian</HI> Prince, and paid him his ransom, which was ninety Dollars, and a few Trifles, and then dismiss'd him. We return'd him our hearty Thanks for his Kindness towards us during our abode with him; in which Time we were treated with greater Humanity, than we afterwards met with in our long Confinement on board the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral <HI>Pizarro.</HI></P>
<P>After we had pass'd Examination by the Governor, and had given him a full Account of our past Misfortunes, we were for a short Time dismiss'd upon Parole. And here I should be very ungrateful if I did not do Jus∣tice to the President of the <HI>English</HI> Assiento House, Mr. <HI>Grey,</HI> by acknowledging that 'twas entirely owing to his Compassion and kind In∣tercession with the Governor, that we were thus redeemed from the Hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> he offering to do it at his own Charge. We were sent for several Times before the Go∣vernor, and earnestly prest to turn Catholicks, and serve the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but our An∣swer was, we were Protestants, and true <HI>En∣glishmen,</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="007859_0312_102DE90CD246D928"/>and hoped to die so. Many tempt∣ing Offers were made to seduce us; but, thank God, we resisted them all. When he found all his Efforts were of no Effect, we were sent as Prisoners of War on board the <HI>Asia,</HI> which lay then at <HI>Monte Vedio,</HI> about thirty Leagues down the river, waiting for Orders, and had lain there upwards of two Years. This was the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s Ship, which, after an unsuccessful Attempt to pass <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> in order to be in the <HI>South Seas</HI> with his Squadron before ours, was, by tem∣pestuous Weather, drove back, and obliged to put into the river <HI>Plate,</HI> having lost near half her Crew; the Admiral having quitted her, and gone over Land to <HI>Chili.</HI></P>
<P>We were confin'd on board the <HI>Asia</HI> above a Year, with 16 other <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, in which Time we were treated more like Slaves than Prisoners of War. Our Business was to do all their nasty Work; to swa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and clean the Decks, fore and aft, every Morning; and, after the Work was done, were confin'd be∣tween Decks, with a Centin over us, as tho' we had been Criminals, with a poor Allow∣ance of Victuals. In short, our Usage was so bad that we agreed with the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners to attempt our Liberty, tho' at the risque of our Lives. Accordingly one
<PB N="291" REF="007859_0313_102DE90F6A3B0CE8"/>Night we escaped from our Guard, intend∣ing to swim ashore, and travel to a <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Settlement on the North Side of the ri∣ver, the Ship lying within a Quarter of a Mile of the Shore. Myself and one more got safe to Land; the others were discovered before they got into Water. I was quite naked; the other had a Shirt wrapped round his Head. Before we got halfway to the Shore, a Gun was fir'd from the Ship to alarm the Town. We travelled till Two in the Morn∣ing, and then lay down among the rushes. The Weather being very frosty, our Feet swell'd and full of Thorns, we could travel no farther. Soon after Day-light we met with some Men on Horseback, belonging to the Plantations, to whom we surrendered our∣selves; and they took us behind them to their House. The next Day we were carried from thence by some Soldiers, who were sent in Pursuit of us, and were carried on board the Ship; where we were put in the Stocks, Neck and Heels, Four Hours every Day for a Fortnight.</P>
<P>At length we were inform'd of the Admi∣ral's Arrival at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> who soon after came on board, and gave Orders for refitting the Ship in the best Manner they could, being determin'd to carry her to <HI>Old Spain.</HI> But
<PB N="292" REF="007859_0314_102DE9126375E950"/>there was a geat Deficiency of Hands, for which reason Orders were given to impress what Men they could at <HI>Monte Vedio.</HI> These, with the 11 <HI>Indians</HI> whom they had four Months before taken Prisoners in a Skirmish at a Distance from <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> whom they design'd for their Row Gallies, were sent on board; and soon after I had the Pleasure of seeing my Brother Midshipman Mr <HI>Campbell,</HI> who was lost in the <HI>Wager</HI> with us, but chu∣sing to follow the Fortune of Capt. <HI>Cheap,</HI> ar∣rived with him at <HI>Chili.</HI> He came by Land from <HI>Chili</HI> with some Officers belonging to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral, and arrived in <HI>March</HI> at <HI>Bu∣enos Ayres.</HI> The latter End of <HI>October</HI> fol∣lowing, 1745, we set sail from <HI>Monte Vedio</HI> in the <HI>Asia</HI> bound for <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Three Days after we sailed, an Affair hap∣pened on board, which was like to have pro∣ved fatal to the whole Crew; for about Nine at Night, we were alarmed with the Cry of a Mutiny; and so indeed it proved: But such a one as would never have been suspected by any of the Ship's Crew, or per∣haps credited by Posterity, if such a Number of Persons were not still living to attest the Fact. But, lest I should do Injustice to the Memory of such a surprising Event, I shall beg Leave to relate it in the Language of Mr.
<PB N="293" REF="007859_0315_102DE914700716F8"/><HI>Walters,</HI> assuring the reader that I was a Wit∣ness to the whole Affair.</P>
<P>"<HI>Pizarro</HI> had not yet compleated the Se∣ries of his Adventures; for when he and <HI>Mendinuetta</HI> came back by Land from <HI>Chili</HI> to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in the Year 1745, they found at <HI>Monte Vedio</HI> the <HI>Asia,</HI> which near three Years before they had left there. This Ship they resolved, if possible, to carry to <HI>Europe;</HI> and with this View they refitted her in the best manner they could. But their great Dif∣ficulty was to procure a sufficient Number of Hands to navigate her; for all the remaining Sailors of the Squadron to be met with in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> did not a∣mount to an hundred Men. They endeavour∣ed to supply this Defect by pressing and put∣ting on board many of the Inhabitants of <HI>Bu∣enos Ayres,</HI> besides all the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners then in their Custody, together with a Num∣ber of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Smugglers, whom they had taken at different Times, and some of the <HI>In∣dians</HI> of the Country. Among these last was a Chief and ten of his Followers, who had been surprized by a Party of <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers about three Months before. The Name of this Chief was <HI>Orellana.</HI> He belonged to a very powerful Tribe which had committed great ravages in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="007859_0316_102DE91619095CE0"/>With this motley Crew (all of them, except the <HI>European Spaniards,</HI> extremely averse to the Voyage) <HI>Pizarro</HI> set sail from <HI>Monte Ve∣dio,</HI> in the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Plate,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> 1745. And the native <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being no Strangers to the Dissatisfaction of their forced Men, treated both these, the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, and the <HI>Indians,</HI> with great Inso∣lence and Barbarity; but more particularly the <HI>Indians:</HI> For it was common for the meanest Officers in the Ship to beat them most cruel∣ly, on the slightest Pretences, and oftentimes only to exert their Superiority. <HI>Orellana</HI> and his Followers, tho' in Appearance sufficiently patient and submissive, meditated a severe re∣venge for all these Inhumanities. As he con∣versed very well in <HI>Spanish</HI> (these <HI>Indians</HI> ha∣ving in Times of Peace, a good Intercourse with <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>) he affected to talk with such of the <HI>English</HI> as understood that Lan∣guage, and seemed very desirous of being in∣formed how many <HI>Englishmen</HI> there were on board, and which they were. As he knew that the <HI>English</HI> were as much Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as himself, he had doubtless an Intention of disclosing his Purpose to them, and making them Partners in the Scheme he had projected for revenging his Wrongs and recovering his Liberty. But having sounded
<PB N="295" REF="007859_0317_102DE919ED1E9920"/>them at a Distance, and not finding them so precipitate and vindictive as he expected, he proceeded no further with them; but resolved to trust alone to the resolution of his ten faith∣ful Followers. These, it should seem, readi∣ly engaged to observe his Directions, and to execute whatever Commands he gave them. And, having agreed on the Measures necessa∣ry to be taken, they first furnished themselves with <HI>Dutch</HI> Knives, sharp at the Point, which being the common Knives used in the Ship, they found no Difficulty in procuring. Be∣sides this, they employed their Leisure in se∣cretly cutting out Thongs from raw Hides, of which there were great Numbers on board, and in fiting to each End of these Thongs the double headed Shot of the small Quarter-Deck Guns. This, when swung round their Heads, according to the Practice of their Country, was a most mischievous Weapon, in the Use of which the <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> are train'd from their Infancy, and consequently are extremely expert. These Particulars be∣ing in good Forwardness, the Execution of their Scheme was perhaps precipitated by a particular Outrage committed on <HI>Orellana</HI> himself. For one of the Officers, who was a very brutal Fellow, ordered <HI>Orellana</HI> aloft, which being what he was incapable of per∣forming,
<PB N="296" REF="007859_0318_102DE91B9673D938"/>the Officer, under Pretence of his Disobedience, beat him with such Violence that he left him bleeding on the Deck, and stupified for some Time with his Bruises and Wounds. This Usage undoubtedly heighten∣ed his Thirst for revenge, and made him eager and impatient till the Means of executing it were in his Power; so that, within a Day or two after this Incident, he and his Fol∣lowers opened their desperate resolves in the ensuing Manner.</P>
<P>"It was about Nine in the Evening, when many of the principal Officers were on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Quarter-Deck, indulging in the Freshness of the Night Air; the Waist of the Ship was filled with live Cattle; and the Forecastle was manned with its customary Watch. <HI>Orellana</HI> and his Companions under Cover of the Night, having prepared their Weapons, and thrown off their Trowsers and the more cum∣berous Part of their Dress, came altogether on the Quarter-Deck, and drew towards the Door of the Great Cabbin. The Boatswain immediately reprimanded them, and order'd them to be gone. On this <HI>Orellana</HI> spoke to his Followers in his Native Language; when four of them drew off, two towards each Gang-way, and the Chief and the six remain∣ing <HI>Indians</HI> seemed to be slowly quitting the
<PB N="297" REF="007859_0319_102DE91D41643768"/>Quarter Deck. When the detached <HI>Indians</HI> had taken Possession of the Gang-way, <HI>Orella∣na</HI> placed his Hands hollow to his Mouth, and bellowed out the War-Cry used by these Sa∣vages, which is the harshest and most terri∣fying Sound known in Nature. This hideous Yell was the Signal for beginning the Mas∣sacre: For on this they all drew their Knives, and brandish'd their prepared double Head∣ed Shot; and the six, with their Chief, which remained on the Quarter-Deck, immediately fell on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were intermingled with them, and laid near forty of them at their Feet; of which about twenty were kill∣ed on the Spot, and the rest disabled. Ma∣ny of the Officers in the Beginning of the Tumult, pushed into the great Cabin; where they put out the Lights, and barricadoed the Door; and of the others, who had avoided the first Fury of the <HI>Indians,</HI> some endeavour∣ed to escape along the Gangways into the Forecastle; but the <HI>Indians,</HI> placed there on Purpose, stabbed the greatest Part of them as they attempted to pass by, or forced them off the Gangways into the Waist: Others threw themselves voluntarily over the Barrica∣does into the Waist, and thought themselves happy to lie concealed among the Cattle: But the greatest Part escaped up the Main Shrowds,
<PB N="298" REF="007859_0320_102DE9202D6DF970"/>and sheltered themselves either in the Tops or rigging. And tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> attack∣ed only the Quarter-Deck, yet the Watch in the Forecastle, finding the Communication cut off, and being terrified by the Wounds of the few who, not being killed on the Spot, had Strength sufficient to force their Passage along the Gangways, and not knowing either who their Enemies were, or what were their Numbers, they likewise gave all over for lost, and, in great Confusion, ran up into the rig∣ging of the Foremast and Bowsprit.</P>
<P>"Thus, these eleven <HI>Indians,</HI> with a reso∣lution perhaps without Example, possessed themselves, almost in an Instant, of the Quar∣ter-Deck of a Ship mounting sixty six Guns, with a Crew of near five hundred Men, and continued in peaceable Possession of this Post a considerable Time: For the Officers in the Great Cabin (among whom were <HI>Pizarro</HI> and <HI>Mindinuetta</HI>) the Crew between Decks, and those who had escaped into the Tops and rigging, were only anxious for their own Safe∣ty, and were for a long Time incapable of forming any Project for suppressing the Insur∣rection, and recovering the Possession of the Ship. It is true, the Yells of the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Groans of the Wounded, and the confused Clamours of the Crew, all heighten'd by the
<PB N="299" REF="007859_0321_102DE922CBE55D48"/>Obscurity of the Night, had at first greatly magnify'd their Danger, and had filled them with the imaginary Terrors which Darkness, Disorder, and an Ignorance of the real Strength of an Enemy, never fail to produce. For as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were sensible of the Disaffection of their prest Hands, and were also conscious of their Barbarity to their Prisoners, they ima∣gined the Conspiracy was general, and con∣sider'd their own Destruction as infallible; so that, it is said, some of them had once ta∣ken the resolution of leaping into the Sea, but were prevented by their Companions.</P>
<P>"However, when the <HI>Indians</HI> had entirely clear'd the Quarter-Deck, the Tumult in a great measure subsided; for those who had escaped were kept silent by their Fears, and the <HI>Indians</HI> were incapable of pursuing them, to renew the Disorder. <HI>Orellana,</HI> when he saw himself Master of the Quarter-Deck, broke open the Arm-Chest, which, on a slight Suspicion of Mutiny, had been ordered there a few Days before, as to a Place of the greatest Security. Here he took it for grant∣ed he should find Cutlasses sufficient for him∣self and his Companions, in the Use of which they were all extremely skilful; and with these, it was imagined, they purposed to force the Great Cabin. But on opening the Chest,
<PB N="300" REF="007859_0322_102DC70DA18AC2F0"/>there appeared nothing but Fire-Arms, which to them were of no Use. There were indeed Cutlasses in the Chest, but they were hid by the Fire Arms being laid over them. This was a sensible Disappointment to them; and by this Tme <HI>Pizarro</HI> and his Companions in the Great Cabin were capable of conversing aloud, thro' the Cabin Windows and Port∣holes, with those in the Gun-room and be¦tween Decks; and from hence they learnt that the <HI>English</HI> (whom they principally suspected) were all safe below, and had not intermeddled in this Mutiny; and by other Particulars they at last discover'd, that none were concern'd in it but <HI>Orellana</HI> and his People. On this <HI>Pi∣zarro</HI> and the Officers resolved to atta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> them on the Quarter Deck, before any of the Dis∣contented on board should so far recover their first Surprize as to reflect on the Facility and Certainty of seizing the Ship, by a Junction with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the present Emergency. With this View <HI>Pizarro</HI> got together what Arms were in the Cabin, and distributed them to those who were with him; but there were no other Fire-Arms to be met with but Pis∣tols, and for these they had neither Powder nor Ball. However, having now settled a Cor∣respondence with the Gun-room, they lower∣ed down a Bucket out of the Cabin Window,
<PB N="301" REF="007859_0323_102DE927667C3028"/>into which the Gunner, out of one of the Gun-room Ports, put a Quantity of Pistol Cartriges. When they had thus procured Ammunition, and had loaded their Pistols, they set the Cabin Door partly open, and fired some Shot among the <HI>Indians</HI> on the Quarter-Deck, at first without Effect; but at last <HI>Mendinuetta,</HI> whom we have often menti∣oned, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the good Fortune to shoot <HI>Orellana</HI> dead on the Spot. On which his faithful Companions, abandoning all Thoughts of farther resistance, instantly leaped into the Sea; where they every Man perished. Thus was the Insurrection quelled, and the Possession of the Quarter-Deck regained, after it had been full two Hours in the Power of this Great and daring Chief, and his gallant and unhap∣py Countrymen."</P>
<P>After this all was quiet; and the Admiral, finding that none of the <HI>English</HI> were engaged in this Insurrection, for a few Days treated us with a little Humanity, endeavouring to en∣gage us, by large Promises of Preferment, to enter into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Service. But finding nothing would work on us, we afterwards felt the Smart of his resentment by a severe Usage.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened afterwards, more than what commonly happens at Sea, till
<PB N="302" REF="007859_0324_102DE9290E7026D8"/>we arrived at <HI>Concubene,</HI> a Harbour about Five Leagues to the South of Cape <HI>Finisterre;</HI> which was the latter End of <HI>February,</HI> 1745-6.</P>
<P>We begged to be sent ashore as Prisoners of War, but were told we must go in the Ship to the <HI>Groyne.</HI> Whereupon we all went in a Body on the Quarter Deck, and told the Admi∣ral, if he would not send us ashore, we would be no longer Slaves on board. Next Day we were sent ashore, and confined fifteen Days in a Prison, with an Allowance only of Bread and Water, and chained together as Criminals, till the Ship sail'd for the <HI>Groyne;</HI> when we were released from our Dungeon, and guard∣ed to the <HI>Groyne</HI> by Land with a File of Mus∣queteers. Where, as soon as we arrived, we were put into the Guard-Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for two Days; from whence we were sent to the Castle of <HI>St. Antonio,</HI> which is on an Island at the Entrance of the Harbour; a Prison for Thieves and Fe∣lons. In this dismal Place we were kept Four∣teen Weeks, among the worst of Malefac∣tors, till an Order came from the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> to send us to <HI>Portugal;</HI> allowing us a Guide, and a Real <HI>per</HI> Day.</P>
<P>In Eight Days we got to <HI>Oporto,</HI> and made Application to the <HI>English</HI> Consul, who, after hearing the Hardships we had gone
<PB N="303" REF="007859_0325_102DE92C1120DB70"/>through, gave us each Three Days Mainte∣nance and a Quarter of a Moidore.</P>
<P>On <HI>April</HI> 28, 1746, we embarked on board the <HI>Charlotta</HI> Snow, Capt. <HI>Henry Miller,</HI> bound for <HI>London,</HI> under Convoy of the <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Folkstone</HI> Men of War, and arrived at <HI>London</HI> on the 8th of <HI>July</HI> following: Three only of the Eight left on the <HI>Patagonian</HI> Coast being so happy as to see once more their native Country, viz. <HI>Samuel Cooper, John An∣drews,</HI> and Myself." [<HI>Here ends</HI> Morris<HI>'s Re∣lation.</HI>]</P>
<P>Two Years after this having some Incli∣nation to settle in <HI>London,</HI> I sent a Petition to the Lords of the Admiralty as follows.</P>
