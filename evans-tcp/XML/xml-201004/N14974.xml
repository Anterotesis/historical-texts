<P>ORATIONS DELIVERED AT THE REQUEST OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON, TO COMMEMORATE THE EVENING OF THE FIFTH OF MARCH, 1770; WHEN A NUMBER OF CITIZENS WERE KILLED BY A PARTY OF BRITISH TROOPS, QUARTERED AMONG THEM, IN A TIME OF PEACE.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON.</HEAD>
<P>I Hope my collecting in one volume, the following Orations, which were first seve∣rally printed at your request, but many of which have been long since not to be purchased, will be considered in the mild light of an at∣tempt to please the Public.</P>
<P>Americans have been reprehended for not preserving, with sufficient care, the various pamphlets and political tracts which this coun∣try has afforded during the late war.</P>
<P>Many of those productions which appear trite to us who live on the spet where they grew, may, however, be considered as sources of curi∣osity to strangers. Many of these Orations have been considered as the sentiments of this me∣tropolis, from time to time, touching the re∣volution,
<PB REF="018997_0004_0FA9127DC20ACFD8"/>and as our earliest public invectives against oppression.</P>
<P>As the institution of an Oration upon the Eifth of March is now superseded by the celebration of the anniversary of Independence upon the Fourth of July, I have given to this volume a general title, which will apply to both institutions: so that if hereafter there shall be a like volume, containing the Orations of that anniversary, this may be considered the first and that the second volume of Boston Orations.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOUR design in the appointment of this ceremony, <HI>my Friends and Fellow-Townsmen,</HI> cannot fail to be examined in quite different lights at this season of political dissention. From the principles I profess, and in the ex∣ercise of my common right to judge with others, I con∣clude it was <HI>decent, wise, and honorable.</HI></P>
<P>THE certainty of being favoured with your kindest partiality and candor, in a poor attempt to execute the part to which you have invited me, has overcome the ob∣jection of my inability to perform it in a proper manner; and I now beg the favour of your animating countenance.</P>
<P>THE horrid bloody scene we here commemorate, what∣ever were the causes which concurred to bring it on that dreadful night, must lead the pious and humane, of every order, to some suitable reflections. The pious will adore
<PB N="8" REF="018997_0006_0FA9127F0DCA0398"/>the conduct of that BEING who is unsearchable in all his ways, and without whose knowledge not a single sparrow falls, in permitting an immortal soul to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rried by the flying ball, the messenger of death, in the twinkling of an eye, to meet the awful Judge of all its secret actions. The humane, from having often thought, with pleasing rapture, on the endearing scenes of social life, in all its amiable relations, will lament, with heart-felt pangs, their sudden dissolution, by indiscretion, rage and vengeance.</P>
<P>BUT let us leave that shocking close of one continued course of rancor and dispute, from the first moment that the troops arrived in town: that course will now be re∣presented by your own reflections to much more solid, use∣ful purpose, than by any artful language. I hope, how∣ever, that heaven has yet in store such happiness for this afflicted town and province, as will in time wear out the memory of all your former troubles.</P>
<P>I sincerely rejoice with you in the happy event of your steady and united effort to prevent a second tragedy.</P>
<P>OUR fathers left their native land, risqued all the dan∣gers of the sea, and came to this then-savage desart, with that true undaunted courage which is excited by a con∣fidence in GOD. They came that they might here enjoy themselves, and leave to their posterity the best of earthly portions, full <HI>English Liberty.</HI> You showed upon the alarming cause for tryal, that their brave spirit still exists in vigor, though their legacy of right is much impaired. The sympathy and active friendship of some neighbour∣ing towns, upon that sad occasion, commands the highest gratitude of this.</P>
<P>WE have seen and felt the ill effects of placing stand∣ing forces in the midst of <HI>populous</HI> communities; but those are only what individuals suffer. Your vote directs me to
<PB N="9" REF="018997_0007_0FA9127FCC637A70"/>point out the fatal tendency of placing such an order in <HI>free</HI> cities—fatal indeed! <HI>Athens</HI> once was free; a citizen, a favorite of the people, by an artful story, gained a tri∣fling guard of fifty men; ambition taught him ways to enlarge that number; he destroyed the commonwealth and made himself the tyrant of the <HI>Athenians. Caesar,</HI> by the length of his command in <HI>Gaul,</HI> got the affections of his army, marched to <HI>Rome,</HI> overthrew the state, and made himself perpetual dictator. By the same instruments, many less republics have been made to fall a prey to the devouring jaws of tyrants.—But this is a subject which should never be disguised with figures; it chuses the plain stile of dissertation.</P>
<P>THE true strength and safety of every commonwealth or limited monarchy, is the bravery of its freeholders, its militia. By brave militias they rise to grandeur, and they come to ruin by a mercenary army. This is founded on historical facts, and the same causes will, in similar circumstances, forever produce the same effects. Justice <HI>Blackstone,</HI> in his inimitably clear commentaries, tells us, that "it is extremely dangerous in a land of liberty, to make a distinct order of the profession of arms; that such an order is an object of jealousy; and that <HI>the lows and constitution of England are strangers to it.</HI>" One article of the Bill of Rights is, that the raising or keeping a stand∣ing army within the kingdom in a time of peace, unless it be with consent of parliament, is against law. The present army, therefore, though called the peace <HI>establish∣ment,</HI> is kept up by one act, and governed by another; both of which expire <HI>annually.</HI> This circumstance is va∣lued as a sufficient <HI>check</HI> upon the army. A less body of troops than is now maintained has, on a time, destroyed a King, and fought under a parliament with great success and glory; but, upon a motion to disband them, they turned their masters out of doors, and fixed others in their stead. Such wild things are not again to happen,
<PB N="10" REF="018997_0008_0FA91280C0A60018"/>because the parliament have power to stop payment once a year: but <HI>arma tenenti quis neget?</HI> which may be easily interpreted, "who will bind <HI>Sampson</HI> with his locks on
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trenchard.</NOTE>?"</P>
<P>THE bill which regulates the army, the same fine au∣thor I have mentioned, says, "is, <HI>in many respects, hastily penned,</HI> and reduces the soldier to a state of slavery in the midst of a free nation. This is impolitic: for slaves envy the freedom of others, and take a malicious pleasure in contributing to destroy it."</P>
<P>BY this scandalous bill a justice of peace is empowered to grant, <HI>without a previous oath</HI> from the military officer, a warrant to break open any (freeman's) house, upon <HI>pretence</HI> of searching for deserters.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit to mention one more bad tendency: 'tis this,—a standing force leads to a total neglect of militias, or tends greatly to discourage them.</P>
<P>YOU see the danger of a standing army to the cause of freedom. If the <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tish</HI> parliament consents from year to year to be exposed, it doubtless has good reasons. But when did <HI>our</HI> assembly pass an act to hazard all the property, the liberty and lives of their constituents? what check have <HI>we</HI> upon a <HI>British</HI> army? can <HI>we</HI> disband it? can <HI>we</HI> stop its pay?</P>
<P>OUR own assemblies in <HI>America</HI> can raise an army; and <HI>our</HI> Monarch, George the 3d, by our constitution, take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediate command. This army can <HI>consent</HI> to leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their native provinces. Will the royal chief commande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> send them to find barracks at <HI>Brunswick</HI> or <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> at <HI>Hanover,</HI> or <HI>the commodious hall of Westminster?</HI> suppose the last—suppose this army was informed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="11" REF="018997_0009_0FA912816BF111B8"/>nay <HI>thought</HI> the parliament in actual rebellion, or only on the <HI>eve</HI> of one, against their King, or against <HI>those who paid and cloathed them</HI>—for there it pinches.—we are <HI>rebels against parliament;</HI>—we adore the King.</P>
<P>WHERE, in the case I have stated, would be the value of the boasted <HI>English</HI> constitution?</P>
<P>WHO are a free people? not those who do not suffer actual oppression; but those who have a <HI>constitutional check upon the power</HI> to oppress.</P>
<P>WE are slaves or freemen: if, as we are called, the last, where is our check upon the following powers, <HI>France, Spain,</HI> the <HI>States of Holland,</HI> or <HI>the British Parliaments?</HI> now if any one of these (and it is quite immaterial which) has right to make the two acts in question operate with∣in this province, they have right to give us up to an unlimited army, under the sole direction of one <HI>Saracen</HI> commander.</P>
<P>THUS I have led your thoughts to <HI>that</HI> upon which I formed my conclusion, that the design of this ceremony was <HI>decent, wise</HI> and <HI>honorable.</HI> Make the bloody 5th of <HI>March</HI> the Aera of the resurrection of your birthrights, which have been murdered by the very strength that nursed them in their infancy. I had an eye <HI>solely</HI> to par∣liamentary supremacy; and I hope you will think every other view beneath your notice, in our present most alarm∣ing situation.</P>
<P><HI>Chatham, Camden,</HI> and others, Gods among men, and the <HI>Farmer,</HI> whom you have addres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed as the friend of mankind; all these have owned that <HI>England</HI> has right to exercise every power over us, but that of taking money
<PB N="12" REF="018997_0010_0FA91282155B50D0"/>out of our pockets, without our consent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Taxation and representation are inseparable.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Chath. Cambd.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>From what in our constitution is representation</HI> not <HI>inseparable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> —multa a</HI> CRASSO divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us <HI>dicta esserebantur, cùm sibi illum consu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m esse negaret cui senator ipse non esset.</HI></P>
<BIBL>CIC.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Though it seems almost too bold therefore in us to say "we doubt in every single instance her <HI>legal</HI> right over this province
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I confine mys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf to this province, partly from ignorance of other charters; but more from a desire even to <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> some abler pen to purs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the idea of <HI>CHLCK;</HI> which an unchartered <HI>FREEMAN</HI> may do, as well as any other in America.</NOTE>", yet <HI>we must assert it.</HI> Those I have named are mighty characters, but <HI>they</HI> wanted one advantage Providence has given <HI>us.</HI> The <HI>beam</HI> is carried off from our eyes, by the flowing blood of our fellow-citizens, and now we may be allowed to attempt to remove the <HI>mote</HI> from the eyes of our exalted patrons. That mote, we think, is nothing but <HI>our obligation to England first, and afterwards Great-Britain, for constant kind protection of our lives and birthrights against foreign danger.</HI> We all acknowledge that protection.</P>
<P>LET us once more look into the early history of this province. We find that our <HI>English</HI> ancestors, disg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted in their native country at a <HI>Legislation,</HI> which they saw was sacrificing all their rights, <HI>left its Jurisdiction</HI>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q><P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ec sunt enim sundamenta firmissima no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> libertatis, sui quem∣que juris et retinendi et dimittendi esse dominum.</HI></P>
<BIBL>CIC.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, and sought, like wandering birds of passage, some happier cli∣mate. Here at length they settled down. The King of <HI>England</HI> was said to be the royal
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">I chuse to bury a fruitful subject for any satyrical genius of the family of <HI>PENN.</HI></NOTE> landford of this terri∣tory; with HIM they entered into mutual, sacred com∣pect,
<PB N="13" REF="018997_0011_0FA91282CD18C0B0"/>by which the price of tenure, and the <HI>rules of ma∣nagement,</HI> were fairly stated. It is in this compact that we find OUR ONLY TRUE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.</P>
<P>I MIGHT here enlarge upon the character of those first settlers, men of whom the world was little worthy; who, for a long course of years, assisted by no earthly power, defended their liberty, their religion, and their lives, against the greatest inland danger of the savage natives: but this falls not within my present purpose. They were secure by sea.</P>
<P>IN our infancy, when not an over-tempting jewel for the <HI>Bourbon</HI> Crown, the very <HI>name</HI> of England saved us; afterwards her <HI>fleets and armies.</HI> We wish not to depre∣ciate the worth of that protection. Of our gold, yea of our most fine gold, we will freely <HI>give</HI> a part. Our fa∣thers would have done the same. But must we fall down and cry "let not a stranger rob and kill me, O my father! let me rather die by the hand of my brother, and let him <HI>ravish</HI> all my portion
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a vitam corpusque servato, ita fortunas, ita rem famil arem, ut haec posteriora <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertati ducas,—nec pro his libertatem, sed pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> libertati haec projicias, tanquam pignora injuriae.</NOTE>!"</P>
<P>IT is said that disunited from <HI>Britain</HI> "we should bleed at every vein." I cannot see the consequence. The <HI>States of Holland</HI> do not suffer thus. But grant it true, SENECA, would prefer the LAUNCETS of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or any other power, to the Bow-STRING, though ap∣plied by the fair hand of <HI>Britannia.</HI></P>
<P>THE declarative vote of the <HI>British Parliament</HI> is the death-warrant of <HI>our</HI> birthrights, and wants only a Czar∣ish King to put it into execution. <HI>Here</HI> then a door of sal∣vation is open. <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may raise <HI>her</HI> fleets and
<PB N="14" REF="018997_0012_0FA912839CBA4750"/>armies, but it is only <HI>our own King</HI> that can direct their fire down upon our heads. He is gracious, but not om∣niscient. He is ready to hear our APPEALS in their proper course; and knowing himself, though the most powerful prince on earth, yet, a subject under a divine constitution of LAW; that law he <HI>will</HI> ask and receive from the twelve Judges of <HI>England.</HI> These will prove that the claim of the <HI>British Parliament</HI> over <HI>us</HI> is not only ILLE∣GAL IN ITSELF, but A DOWN-RIGHT USURPATION OF HIS PREROGATIVE as King of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>A BRAVE nation is always generous. Let us appeal, therefore, at the same time, to the generosity of the PEO∣PLE of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> before the tribunal
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not think the <HI>QUO WARRANTO</HI> against our first charter, was tried in a proper court.</NOTE> of <HI>Europe,</HI> not to envy <HI>us</HI> the full enjoyment of the RIGHTS OF BRE∣THREN.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>my Friends and Fellow-Townsmen,</HI> having declared myself an <HI>American</HI> Son of Liberty of true char∣ter principles: having shewn the critical and dangerous situation of our birthrights, and the true course for speedy redress; I shall take the freedom to recommend, with boldness, one previous step.—Let us show we understand the true value of what we are claiming.</P>
<P>THE patriotic <HI>Farmer</HI> tells us, "the cause of Liberty is a cause of too much dignity to be sullied by turbulence and tumult.—Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and respectful be∣haviour, may, by imprudence, be enlarged to an incu∣rable rage. In quarrels—risen to a certain height, the first cause of dissention is no longer remembered, the minds
<PB N="15" REF="018997_0013_0FA912846E06CE70"/>of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting and resenting the mutual expressions of their dislike. When feuds have reached that fatal point, considerations of rea∣son and equity vanish; and a blind fury governs, or ra∣ther confounds all things. A people no longer regard their interest, but a gratification of their wrath."</P>
<P>WE know ourselves subjects of common LAW: to <HI>that</HI> and the worthy <HI>executors</HI> of it, let us pay a steady and conscientious regard. Past errors in this point have been written with gall, by the pen of MALICE. May our future conduct be such as to make even that vile IMP lay her pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aside.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Right</HI> which imposes <HI>duties</HI> upon us, is in dispute: but whether they are managed by a <HI>Surveyor-General,</HI> a <HI>Board of Commissioners, Turkish Janizaries,</HI> or <HI>Russian Cos∣sacks,</HI> let them enjoy, during our time of fair tryal, the common personal protection of the laws of our constitution. Let us shut our eyes, for the present, to their being <HI>ex∣ecutors of claims subversive of our rights.</HI></P>
<P>WATCHFUL, hawk-eyed JEALOUSY, ever guards the portal of the temple of the GODDESS LIBERTY. This is known to those who frequent her altars. Our whole conduct therefore, I am sure, will meet with the utmost candor of her VOTARIES: but I am wishing we may be able to convert even her basest APOSTATES.</P>
<P>WE are SLAVES until we obtain such <HI>redress,</HI> through the justice of our King, as our happy <HI>constitution leads us to expect.</HI> In that condition, let us behave with the pro∣priety and dignity of FREEMEN; and <HI>thus</HI> exhibit to the world, a new character of a people, which no history de∣scribes.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018997_0014_0FA91285083DE4D0"/>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we turn over the historic page, and trace the rise and fall of states and empires; the mighty revolutions which have so often varied the face of the world strike our minds with solemn surprize, and we are naturally led to endeavour to search out the causes of such astonish∣ing changes.</P>
<P>THAT man is formed for <HI>social life,</HI> is an observation which, upon our first enquiry, presents itself immediately to our view, and our reason approves that wise and generous principle which actuated the first founders of civil govern∣ment; an institution which hath its origin in the <HI>weakness</HI> of individuals, and hath for its end, the <HI>strength and secu∣rity</HI> of all: and so long as the means of effecting this im∣portant end are thoroughly known, and religiously attended to, government is one of the richest blessings to mankind, and ought to be held in the highest veneration.</P>
<P>IN young and new-formed communities, the grand de∣sign of this institution, is most generally understood, and
<PB N="18" REF="018997_0016_0FA912889813ECD8"/>most strictly regarded; the motives which urged to the social compact, cannot be at once forgotten, and <HI>that</HI> equality which is remembered to have subsisted so lately among them, prevents those who are cloathed with autho∣rity from attempting to invade the freedom of their bre∣thren; or if such an attempt is made, it prevents the community from suffering the offender to go unpunished: every member feels it to be his interest, and knows it to be his duty, to preserve inviolate the constitution on which the public safety depends
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnes ordines ad conservamdam rempublicam, mente, voluntate, studio, virtute, voce, consentiunt.</NOTE>, and is equally ready to assist the <HI>Magistrate</HI> in the execution of the laws, and the <HI>subject</HI> in defence of his right; and so long as this noble attachment to a constitution, founded on free and bene∣volent principles, exists in full vigor, in any state, <HI>that</HI> state must be flourishing and happy.</P>
<P>IT was <HI>this</HI> noble attachment to a free constitution, which raised ancient Rome from the smallest beginnings, to that bright summit of happiness and glory to which she arrived; and it was the loss of <HI>this</HI> which plunged her from <HI>that</HI> summit, into the black gulph of infamy and sla∣very. It was <HI>this</HI> attachment which inspired her senators with wisdom; it was <HI>this</HI> which glowed in the breasts of her heroes; it was <HI>this</HI> which guarded her liberties, and extended her dominions, gave peace at home, and com∣manded respect abroad: and when <HI>this</HI> decayed, her ma∣gistrates lost their reverence for justice and the laws, and degenerated into tyrants and oppressors—her senators, forgetful of their dignity, and seduced by base corruption, betrayed their country—her soldiers, regardless of their re∣lation to the community, and urged <HI>only</HI> by the hopes of plunder and rapine, unfeelingly committed the most fla∣grant enormities; and hired to the trade of death, with relentless fury they perpetrated the most cruel murders,
<PB N="19" REF="018997_0017_0FA91288C2BC0708"/>whereby the streets of imperial Rome were drenched with her <HI>noblest</HI> blood. Thus <HI>this empress</HI> of the world lost her dominions abroad, and her inhabitants, dissolute in their manners, at length became contented <HI>slaves;</HI> and she stands to this day, the scorn and derision of nations, and a monument of this eternal truth, that PUBLIC HAP∣PINESS DEPENDS ON A VIRTUOUS AND UNSHAKEN ATTACHMENT TO A FREE CONSTITUTION.</P>
<P>IT was <HI>this</HI> attachment to a constitution, founded on free and benevolent principles, which inspired the first settlers of this country:—they saw with grief the daring outrages committed on the free constitution of their native land—they knew that nothing but a civil war could at that time restore its pristine purity. So hard was it to resolve to embrue their hands in the <HI>blood</HI> of their brethren, that they chose rather to quit their fair possessions, and seek another habitation in a distant clime. When they came to this new world, which they fairly purchased of the Indian natives, the only rightful proprietors, they cul∣tivated the then barren soil, by their incessant labour, and defended their dear-bought possessions with the forti∣tude of the christian, and the bravery of the hero.</P>
<P>AFTER various struggles, which, during the tyrannic reigns of the house of STUART, were constantly kept up between right and wrong, between liberty and slavery, the connection between Great-Britain and this Colony, was settled in the reign of King William and Queen Ma∣ry, by a compact, the conditions of which were expressed in a Charter; by which all the liberties and immunities of British Subjects, were confined to this province, as fully and as absolutely as they possibly could be by any human instrument which can be devised. And it is un∣deniably true, that the greatest and most important right of a British subject is, that <HI>he shall be governed by no laws but those to which he either in person or by his representative
<PB N="20" REF="018997_0018_0FA9128999BBB908"/>hath given his consent:</HI> and this I will venture to assert, is the grand basis of British freedom; it is interwoven with the constitution; and whenever this is lost, the constitu∣tion must be destroyed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>British constitution</HI> (of which ours is a copy) is a happy compound of the three forms (under some of which all governments may be ranged) viz. monarchy, aristo∣cracy, and democracy: of these three the <HI>British Legis∣lature</HI> is composed, and without the consent of each branch, nothing can carry with it the force of a law; but when a law is to be passed for rasing a tax, that law can origi∣nate only in the democratic branch, which is the House of Commons in Britain, and the House of Representatives here—The reason is obvious: they and their consti∣tuants are to pay much the largest part of it; but as the aristrocratic branch, which in Britain, is the house of lords, and in this province, the council, are also to pay some part, THEIR consent is necessary; and as the mo∣narchic branch, which in Britain is the King, and with us, either the King in person, or the Governor whom he shall be pleased to appoint to act in his stead, is supposed to have a just sense of his own interest, which is <HI>that</HI> of all the subjects in general, HIS consent is also necessary, and when the consent of these three branches is obtained, the taxation is most certainly legal.</P>
<P>LET us now allow ourselves a few moments to examine the <HI>late acts of the British parliament for taxing America</HI>— Let us with candor judge whether they are constitution∣ally binding upon us:—if they are, IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE let us submit to them, without one murmuring word.</P>
<P>FIRST, I would ask whether the members of the British House of Commons are the democracy of this province? if they are, they are either the people of this province,
<PB N="21" REF="018997_0019_0FA9128A58999798"/>or are elected by the people of this province, to represent them, and have therefore a constitutional right to origi∣nate a bill for taxing them: it is most certain they are neither; and therefore nothing done by <HI>them</HI> can be said to be done by the democratic branch of our constitution. I would next ask, whether the Lords, who compose the aristocratic branch of the legislature, are Peers of Ameri∣ca? I never heard it was (even in these extraordinary times) so much as pretended, and if they are not, certain∣ly no act of <HI>theirs</HI> can be said to be the act of the aristocratic branch of our constitution. The power of the monarchic branch we with pleasure acknowledge, resides in the King, who may act either in person or by his representative; and I freely confess that I can see no reason why a PRO∣CLAMATION <HI>for raising money in America,</HI> issued by the King's <HI>sole</HI> authority, would not be equally consistent with our own constitution, and therefore equally binding upon us with the <HI>late acts of the British parliament for tax∣ing us;</HI> for it is plain, that if there is any validity in <HI>those acts,</HI> it must arise altogether from the monarchical branch of the legislature: and I further think that it would be at least as equitable; for I do not conceive it to be of the least importance to us by <HI>whom</HI> our property is taken away, so long as it is taken without our consent; and I am very much at a loss to know by what figure of rhetoric, the inhabitants of this province can be called FREE SUBJECTS, when they are obliged to obey implicit∣ly, such laws as are made for them by men three thousand miles off, whom they know not, and whom they never have empowered to act for them; or how they can be said to have PROPERTY, when a body of men, over whom they have not the least controul, and who are not in any way accountable to them, shall oblige them to deliver up any part, or the whole of their substance, without even asking their consent: and yet, whoever pretends that the late acts of the British parliament for taxing America ought to be deemed binding upon us, must admit at once that
<PB N="22" REF="018997_0020_0FA9128C6B9F28F8"/>we are absolute SLAVES, and have no property of our own; or else that we may be FREEMEN, and at the same time under a necessity of obeying the <HI>arbitrary commands of those</HI> over whom we have no controul or influence; and that we may HAVE PROPERTY OF OUR OWN, which is entirely at the disposal of another. Such gross absurdi∣ties, I believe will not be relished in this enlightened age: and it can be no matter of wonder that the people quickly perceived, and seriously complained of the inroads which these acts must unavoidably make upon their <HI>liberty,</HI> and of the hazard to which their <HI>whole property</HI> is by <HI>them</HI> exposed; for, if they may be taxed without their consent, even in the smallest trifle, they may also, without their consent, be deprived of every thing they possess, although never so valuable, never so dear. Certainly it never en∣tered the hearts of our ancestors, that after so many dangers in this then desolate wilderness, their hard-earned proper∣ty should be at the disposal of the British parliament; and as it was soon foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at this taxation could not be sup∣ported by reason and argument, it seemed necessary that one act of oppression should be enforced by another, and therefore, contrary to our just rights as possessing, or at least having a just title to possess, all the <HI>liberties</HI> and IMMUNITIES of British subjects, a standing army was established among us in a time of peace; and evidently for the purpose of effecting <HI>that,</HI> which it was one prin∣cipal design of the founders of the constitution to prevent (when they declared a standing army in a time of peace to be AGAINST LAW) namely, for the enforce∣ment of obedience to acts which, upon fair examination, appeared to be unjust and unconstitutional.</P>
<P>THE ruinous consequences of standing armies to free communities, may be seen in the histories of SYRACUSE, ROME, and many other once flourishing STATES; some of which have now scarce a name! their baneful influence is most suddenly felt, when they are placed in populous
<PB N="23" REF="018997_0021_0FA9128F209DFDA8"/>for, by a corruption of morals, the public hap∣piness is immediately affected? and that this is one of the effects of quartering troops in a populous city, is a truth, to which many a mourning parent, many a lost, despairing child in this metropolis, must bear a very me∣lancholy testimony.—Soldiers are also taught to consider arms as the only arbiters by which every dispute is to be decided between contending states;—they are instructed <HI>implicitly</HI> to obey their commanders, without enquiring into the justice of the cause they are engaged to support: hence it is, that they are ever to be dreaded as the ready engines of tyranny and oppression.—And it is too observ∣able that they are prone to introduce the same mode of decision in the disputes of individuals, and from thence have often arisen great animosities between <HI>them</HI> and <HI>the inhabitants,</HI> who, whilst in a naked defenceless state, are frequently insulted and abused by an armed soldiery. And this will be more especially the cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when the troops are informed that the intention of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing stationed in any city, is to OVERAWE THE INHABITANTS. That this was the avowed design of stationing an armed force in this town, is sufficiently known; and we, my fellow-citizens, have seen, WE have felt the tragical effects!—THE FATAL FIFTH OF MARCH, 1770, CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN—The horrors of THAT DREADFUL NIGHT are but too deeply impressed on our hearts— Language is too feeble to paint the emotions of our souls, when our streets were stained with the BLOOD OF OUR BRETHREN,—when our ears were wounded by the groans of the <HI>dying,</HI> and our eyes were tormented with the sight of the mangled bodies of the <HI>dead.</HI>—When our alarmed imagination presented to our view our houses wrapt in flames,—our children subjected to the barbarous caprice of the raging soldiery,—our beauteous virgins exposed to all the insolence of unbridled passion,—our virtuous wives, endeared to us by every tender tie, falling a sacrifice to worse than brutal violence, and perhaps, like the famed
<PB N="24" REF="018997_0022_0FA9129032ABE4B0"/>LUCRETIA, distracted with anguish and despait, ending their wretched lives by their own fair hands.—When we beheld the authors of our distress parading in our streets, or drawn up in a regular <HI>battalia,</HI> as though in a hostile city, our hearts beat to arms; we snatched our weapons, almost resolved, by one decisive stroke, to avenge the death of our SLAUGHTERED BRETHREN, and to secure from future danger, all that we held most dear: but propitious heaven forbad the bloody carnage, and saved the threatned victims of our too keen resentment, not by their discipline, not by their regular array,—no, it was royal GEORGE's livery that proved their shield—it was that which turned the pointed engines of destruction from, their breasts
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have the strongest reason to believe that I have mentioned the only circumstance which saved the troops from destruction. It was then, and now is, the opinion of those who were best ac∣quainted with the state of affairs at that time, that had thrice that number of troops, belonging to any power at open war with us, been in this town, in the same exposed condition, scarce a man would have lived to have seen the morning light.</NOTE>. The thoughts of vengeance were soon buried in our in∣bred affection to Great-Britain, and calm reason dictated a method of removing the troops more mild than an immediate recourse to the sword. With united efforts you urged the immediate departure of the troops from the town—you urged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a resolution which ensured success—you obtained your wishes, and the removal of the troops was effected, without one drop of <HI>their blood</HI> being shed by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE immediate actors in the tragedy of THAT NIGHT were surrendered to justice.—It is not mine to say how far they were guilty! they have been tried by the coun∣try and ACQUITTED of murder! and they are not to be again arraigned at an earthly bar: but, surely the men who have promiscuously scattered <HI>death</HI> amidst the <HI>innocent</HI> inhabitants of a populous city, ought to see well
<PB N="25" REF="018997_0023_0FA9129053F95F70"/>to it, that they be prepared to stand at the bar of an omni∣scient Judge! and all who contrived or encouraged the stationing troops in this place, have reasons of eternal im∣portance, to reflect with deep contrition, on their base designs, and humbly to repent of their impious machi∣nations.</P>
<P>THE infatuation which hath seemed, for a number of years, to prevail in the British councils, with regard to us, is truly astonishing! what can be proposed by the repeated attacks made upon our freedom, I really cannot surmise; even leaving justice and humanity out of the question, I do not know one single advantage which can arise to the British nation, from our being enslaved:—I know not of any gains, which can be wrung from us by oppression, which they may not obtain from us by our own consent, in the smooth channel of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merce: we wish the wealth and prosperity of Britain; we contribute largely to both. Doth what we contribute lose all its value, be∣cause it is done voluntarily? the amazing increase of riches to Britain, the great rise of the value of her lands the flourishing state of her navy are striking proofs of the advantages derived to her from her commerce with the colonies; and it is our earnest desire that she may still continue to enjoy the same emoluments, until her streets are paved with AMERICAN GOLD; only, let us have the pleasure of calling it our own, whilst it is in our hands; but this it seems is too great a favor—we are to governed by the <HI>absolute commands of others; our property is to be ta∣ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away without our consent</HI>—if we complain, our com∣plaints are treated with contempt; if we assert our rights, that assertion is deemed insolence; if we humbly offer to submit the matter to the impartial decision of reason, the SWORD is judged the most proper argument to silence our murmurs! but this cannot long be the case—surely the <HI>British</HI> nation will not suffer the reputation of their justice and their honor, to be thus sported away by a capricious
<PB N="26" REF="018997_0024_0FA9129140ABCC78"/>ministry; no, they will in a short time open their eyes to their true interest: they nourish in their own breasts, a noble love of liberty; they hold her dear, and they know that all who have once possessed her charms, had rather die than suffer her to be torn from their embraces—they are also sensible that <HI>Britain</HI> is so deeply interested in the prosperity of the colonies, that she must eventually feel every wound given to their freedom; they cannot be ig∣norant that more dependence may be placed on the af∣fections of a brother, than on the forced service of a slave; they must approve your efforts for the preservation of your rights; from a sympathy of soul they must pray for your success: and I doubt not but they will, e'er long, exert themselves effectually, to redress your grievances. Even in the dissolute reign of King CHARLES II. when the House of Commons impeached the earl of Clarendon of high treason, the first article on which they founded their accusation was, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>he had designed a standing army to be raised, and to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the kingdom thereby.</HI>" And the eighth article was, that <HI>"he had introduced an arbitrary government into his majesty's plantation."</HI> A terrifying ex∣ample to those who are now forging <HI>chains</HI> for this COUNTRY.</P>
<P>YOU have, my friends and countrymen, frustrated the designs of your enemies, by your unanimity and fortitude: it was your union and determined spirit which expelled those troops, who polluted your streets with INNOCENT BLOOD. You have appointed this anniversay as a stand∣ing memorial of the BLOODY CONSEQUENCES OF PLACING AN ARMED FORCE IN A POPULOUS CITY, and of your deliverance from the dangers which then seemed to hang over your heads; and I am confident that you never will betray the least want of spirit when called upon to guard your freedom.—None but they who set a just value upon the blessings of Liberty are worthy to en∣joy her—your illustrious fathers were her zealous vota∣ries—when
<PB N="27" REF="018997_0025_0FA91293F2A13650"/>the blasting frowns of tyranny drove her from public view, they clasped her in their arms, they cherished her in their generous bosoms, they brought her safe over the rough ocean, and fixed her seat in this then dreary wilderness; they nursed her infant age with the most ten∣der care; for her sake, they patiently bore the severest hardships; for her support, they underwent the most rug∣ged toils: in her defence, they boldly encountered the most alarming dangers; neither the ravenous beasts that ranged the woods for prey, nor the more furious savages of the wilderness, could damp their ardor!—Whilst with one hand they broke the stubborn glebe, with the other they grasped their weapons, ever ready to protect her from dan∣ger.—No sacrifice, not even their own blood, was esteem∣ed too rich a libation for her altar! GOD prospered their valor; they preserved her brilliancy unsullied; they en∣joyed her whilst they lived, and dying, bequeathed the dear inheritance to your care. And as they left you this glorious legacy, they have undoubtedly transmitted to you some portion of their noble spirit, to inspire you with vir∣tue to merit her, and courage to preserve her: you surely cannot, with such examples before your eyes, as every page of the history of this country affords

<P>THE voice of your fathers blood cries to you from the ground; MY SONS SCORN TO BE SLAVES! in vain we met the frowns of tyrants—in vain, we crossed the boisterous ocean, found a new world, and prepared it for the happy residence of LIBERTY—in vain, we toiled— in vain, we fought—we bled in vain, if you, our offspring want valor to repel the assaults of her invaders!— Stain not the glory of your worthy ancestors, but like

<P>IF you, with united zeal and fortitude, oppose the tor∣rent of oppression; if you feel the true fire of patriotism burning in your breasts; if you, from your souls, despise the most gaudy dress that slavery can wear; if you real∣ly prefer the lonely cottage (whilst blest with liberty) to gilded palaces, surrounded with the ensigns of slavery, you may have the fullest assurance that tyranny, with her whole accursed train, will hide their hideous heads in con∣fusion, shame and despair—if you perform your part, you must have the strongest confidence, that THE SAME AL∣MIGHTY BEING who protected your pious and venerable forefathers—who enabled them to turn a barren wilderness into a fruitful field, who so often <HI>made bare his arm</HI> for their salvation, will still be mindful of you their off∣spring.</P>

<P>WHEN man was unconnected by social obligations; abhorrent to every idea of dependence; actuated by a sa∣vage
<PB N="30" REF="018997_0028_0FA912958E3E87B8"/>ferocity of mind, displayed in the brutality of his manners, the necessary exigences of each individual, na∣turally impelled him to acts of treachery, violence and murder.</P>
<P>THE miseries of mankind thus proclaiming eternal war with their species, led them, probably, to consult certain measures to arrest the current of such outrageous enormities.</P>
<P>A SENSE of their wants and weakness, in a state of na∣ture, doubtless inclined them to such reciprocal aids and support, as eventually established society.</P>
<P>MEN then began to incorporate; subordination suc∣ceeded to independence; order to anarchy; and passions were disarmed by civilization: society lent its aid to se∣cure the weak from oppression, who wisely took shelter within the sanctuary of law.</P>
<P>ENCREASING society afterwards exacted, that the tacit contract made with her by each individual, at the time of his being incorporated, should receive a more solemn form to become authentic and irrefragable; the main object being to add force to the laws, proportionate to the power and extent of the body corporate, whose energy they were to direct.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>society</HI> availed herself of the sacrifice of that <HI>li∣berty</HI> and that <HI>natural equality</HI> of which we are all con∣scious: superiors and magistrates were appointed, and mankind submitted to a civil and political subordination. This is truly a glorious inspiration of reason, by whose in∣fluence, notwithstanding the inclination we have for inde∣pendence, we accept controul, for the establishment of order.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="018997_0029_0FA9129648728D48"/>
ALTHOUGH unrestrained power in one person, may have been the first and most natural recourse of mankind, from rapine and disorder; yet all restrictions of power, made by laws, or participation of sovereignty, are ap∣parent improvements upon what began in unlimited power.</P>
<P>IT would shock humanity, should I attempt to describe those barbarous and tragic scenes, which crimson the hi∣storic page of this wretched and detestable constitution, where absolute dominion is lodged in one person: where <HI>one</HI> makes the <HI>whole,</HI> and the <HI>whole</HI> is <HI>nothing.</HI> What motives, what events, could have been able to subdue men, endowed with reason, to render themselves the mute in∣struments, and passive objects of the caprice of an in∣dividual.</P>
<P>MANKIND apprized of their privileges, in being ra∣tional and free, in prescribing civil laws to themselves, had surely no intention of being enchained by any of their equals; and although they submitted voluntary adherents to certain laws, for the sake of mutual security and hap∣piness, they, no doubt, intended by the original compact, a permanent exemption of the subject body from any claims, which were not expresly surrendered, for the par∣pose of obtaining the security and defence of the whole. Can it possibly be conceived, that they would voluntarily be enslaved by a power of their own creation?</P>
<P>THE constitution of a magistrate, does not therefore take away that lawful defence against force and injury, allowed by the law of nature; we are not to obey a prince, ruling above the limits of the power entrusted to him; for the commonwealth, by constituting a head, does not deprive itself of the power of its own preservation

<P>THE question in short turns upon this single point, respecting the power of the civil magistrate: is it the end of that office that one particular person may do what he will without restraint? or rather that society should be made happy and secure? the answer is very obvious— And it is my firm opinion that the <HI>equal justice</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>natural freedom of mankind,</HI> must stand or fall together.</P>
<P>WHEN rulers become tyrants, they cease to be kings: they can no longer be respected as GOD's <HI>vicegerents,</HI> who violate the laws they were sworn to protect. The <HI>preacher</HI> may tell us of <HI>passive obedience,</HI> that tyrants are scourges in the hands of a righteous GOD to chastise a sinful na∣tion, and are to be submitted to like plagues, famine

WITHOUT this, the distinctions among mankind are but different degrees of misery; for as the true estimate of a man's life consists in conducting it according to his own just senti∣ment and innocent inclinations, his being is degraded below that of a free agent, which heaven has made him, when his affections and passions are no longer governed by the dictates of his own mind, and the interests of human society, but by the arbitrary, unrestrained will of another.</P>
<P>I THANK GOD we live in an age of rational inquisition, when the unfettered mind dares to expatiate freely on every object worthy its attention, when the privileges of mankind are thoroughly comprehended, and the rights of distinct societies are objects of liberal enquiry.

THAT the members of the British parliament are the representatives of the whole British empire, expresly mi∣litates with their avowed principles: property and resi∣dence within the island, alone constituting the right of election; and surely he is not my delegate in whose no∣mination or appointment I have no choice: but however the futile and absurd claim of a virtual representation, may comport with the idea of a political visionary; he must (if possible) heighten the indignation, or excite the ridicule of a freeborn American, who by such a fallacious pretext would despoil him of his property.</P>
<P>AN American freeholder, according to the just and judi∣cious conduct of the present ministry, has no possible right to be consulted, in the disposal of his property: when a lordly, though <HI>unlettered British elector,</HI> possessed of a tur∣nip garden, with great propriety may appoint a legisla∣ture, to assess the ample domains of the most sensible, opu∣lent American planter.</P>
<P>BUT remember, my brethren, when a people have once sold their liberties, it is no act of extraordinary generosity, to throw their lives and properties into the bargain, for they are poor indeed when enjoyed at the mercy of a master.</P>
<P>THE late conduct of Great-Britain, so inconsistent with the practice of former times, so subversive of the first principles of government, is sufficient to excite the dis∣content of the subject: the Americans justly and decently urged an exclusive right of taxing themselves; was it in∣dulgent, conciliating, or parental conduct in that state, to exaggerate such a claim, as a concerted plan of rebellion in the wanton Americans? and by a rigorous and cruel exercise of power to enforce submission, excite such ani∣mosities, as at some future period, may produce a bitter repentance?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="018997_0036_0FA9129BEBE1A098"/>
CAN such be called a legal tax or free gift? it is ra∣ther levying contributions on grudging enslaved Ameri∣cans, by virtue of an act framed and enforced, not only without, but against their consent; thereby rendering the provincial assemblies a useless part of the constitution.</P>
<P>WHERE laws are framed and assessments laid without a legal representation, and obedience to such acts urged by force, the despairing people robbed of every constitutional means of redress, and that people, brave and virtuous, must become the admiration of ages, should they not ap∣peal to those powers, which the immutable laws of nature have lent to all mankind. <HI>Fear</HI> is a slender tie of sub∣jection; we detest those whom we fear, and wish destruction to those we detest; but humanity, uprightness, and good faith, with an apparant watchfulness for the welfare of the people, constitute the permanency, and are the firmest support of the <HI>sovereign</HI>'s authority; for when violence is opposed to reason and justice, courage never wants an arm for its defence.</P>
<P>WHAT dignity, what respect, what authority, can <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> derive from her obstinate adherence to error? she stands convicted of violating her own principles, but per∣soeveres with unrelenting severity; we implore for <HI>rights</HI> as a grace, she aggravates our distress, by lopping away another and another darling privilege; we ask for <HI>freedom</HI> and she sends the <HI>sword!</HI></P>

<P>THE attentive gravity; the venerable appearance of this crouded audience; the dignity which I behold in the countenances of so many in this great assembly; the solemnity of the occasion upon which we have met together, joined to a consideration of the part I am to take in the important business of this day, fill me with an awe hitherto unknown; and heighten the sense which I have ever had, of my unworthiness to fill this sacred desk; but, allured by the call of some of my respected fellow-citizens, with whose request it is always my greatest plea∣sure to comply, I almost forgot my want of ability to per∣form what they required. In this situation I find my only support, in assuring myself that a generous people will not severely censure what they know was well in∣tended, though its want of merit, should prevent their
<PB N="44" REF="018997_0041_0FA912A3EBB70A40"/>being able to applaud it. And I pray, that my sincere at∣tachment to the interest of my country, and hearty detesta∣tion of every design formed against her liberties, may be ad∣mitted as some apology for my appearance in this place.</P>
<P>I HAVE always, from my earliest youth, rejoiced in the felicity of my fellow-men; and have ever considered it as the indispensable duty of every member of society to pro∣mote, as far as in him lies, the prosperity of every in∣dividual, but more especially of the community to which he belongs; and also, as a faithful subject of the state, to use his utmost endeavours to detect, and having detected, strenuously to oppose every traitorous plot which its ene∣mies may devise for its destruction. Security to the per∣sons and properties of the governed, is so obviously the design and end of civil government, that to attempt a logical proof of it, would be like burning tapers at noon-day, to assist the sun in enlightening the world; and it cannot be either virtuous or honorable, to attempt to support a government, of which this is not the great and principal basis; and it is to the last degree vicious and infamous to attempt to support a government, which manifestly tends to render the persons and properties of the governed insecure. Some boast of being <HI>friends to government;</HI> I am a friend to <HI>righteous</HI> government, to a government founded upon the principles of reason and justice; but I glory in publicly avowing my eternal enmity to tyran∣ny. Is the present system which the British administra∣tion have adopted for the government of the colonies, a righteous government? or is it tyranny?—Here suf∣fer me to ask (and would to heaven there could be an answer) what tenderness, what regard, respect or consideration has <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shewn, in their late trans∣actions, for the security of the persons or properties of the inhabitants of the colonies? or rather, what have they omitted doing to destroy that security? they have dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared that they have, ever had, and of right ought ever
<PB N="45" REF="018997_0042_0FA912A49A877D18"/>to have, full power to make laws of sufficient validity to bind the colonies in all cases whatever: they have exer∣cised this pretended right by imposing a tax upon us without our consent; and lest we should shew some re∣luctance at parting with our property, her fleets and ar∣mies are sent to enforce their mad pretensions. The town of Boston, ever faithful to the British crown, has been invested by a British fleet: the troops of George the III. have cross'd the wide atlantick, not to engage an enemy, but to assist a band of TRAITORS in trampling on the rights and liberties of his most loyal subjects in Ame∣rica,—those rights and liberties which, as a father, he ought ever to regard, and as a king, he is bound, in honor, to defend from violations, even at the risque of his own life.</P>
<P>LET not the history of the illustrious house of Brunswick inform posterity, that a king, descended from that glorious monarch George the II. once sent his British subjects to conquer and enslave his subjects in America; but be perpetual infamy entail'd upon that villain who dared to advise his master to such execrable measures; for it was easy to foresee the consequences which so naturally follow∣ed upon sending troops into America, to enforce obedience to acts of the British parliament, which neither GOD nor man ever empowered them to make. It was reasonable to expect that troops, who knew the errand they were sent upon, would treat the people whom they were to subjugate, with a cruelty and haughtiness, which too often buries the honorable character of a <HI>soldier,</HI> in the disgraceful name of an <HI>unfeeling ruffian.</HI> The troops, upon their first ar∣rival, took possession of our senate-house, and pointed their cannon against the judgment-hall, and even continued them there whilst the supreme court of judicature for this province was actually sitting to decide upon the lives and fortunes of the king's subjects. Our streets nightly refounded with the noise of riot and debauchery; our peaceful citizens were hourly exposed to shameful insults,
<PB N="46" REF="018997_0043_0FA912A53B176160"/>and often felt the effects of their violence and outrage.— But this was not all: as though they thought it not enough to violate our civil rights, they endeavoured to deprive us of the enjoyment of our religious privileges; to viciate our morals, and thereby render us deserving of destruction. Hence the rude din of arms which broke in upon your so∣lemn devotions in your temples, on that day hallowed by heaven, and set apart by GOD himself for his peculiar worship. Hence, impious oaths and blasphemies so often tortur'd your unaccustomed ear. Hence, all the arts which idleness and luxury could invent, were used, to betray our youth of one sex into extravagance and effeminacy, and of the other to infamy and ruin; and did they not succeed but too well? did not a reverence for religion sensibly de∣cay? did not our infants almost learn to lisp out curses before they knew their horrid import? did not our youth forget they were Americans, and regardless of the admo∣nitions of the wise and aged, servilely copy from their tyrants those vices which finally must overthrow the empire of Great-Britain? and must I be compelled to acknow∣ledge, that even the noblest, fairest part of all the lower creation did not entirely escape the cursed snare? when virtue has once erected her throne within the female breast, it is upon so solid a basis that nothing is able to expel the heavenly inhabitant. But have there not been some, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w indeed, I hope, whose youth and inexperience have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nder'd them a prey to wretches, whom, upon the least reflection, they would have despised and hated as foes to GOD and their country? I fear there have been some such unhappy instances; or why have I seen an honest father cloathed with shame; or why a virtuous mother drowned in tears?</P>
<P>BUT I forbear, and come reluctantly to the transactions of that dismal night, when in such quick succession we felt the extremes of grief, astonishment and rage; when heaven in anger, for a dreadful moment, suffer'd hell to take the
<PB N="47" REF="018997_0044_0FA912A6DA8F3D78"/>reins; when satan with his chosen band open'd the sluices of New-England's blood, and sacrilegiously polluted our land with the dead bodies of her guiltless sons. Let this sad tale of death never be told without a tear: let not the heaving bosom cease to burn with a manly indignation at the barbarous story, through the long tracts of future time: let every parent tell the shameful story to his listening children 'til tears of pity glisten in their eyes, and boiling passion shakes their tender frames; and whilst the anni∣versary of that ill-fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandaemonium, let all America join in one com∣mon prayer to heaven, that the inhuman, unprovoked mur∣ders of the fifth of March, 1770, planned by Hillsbo∣rough, and a knot of treacherous knaves in Boston, and executed by the cruel hand of Preston and his sanguinary coadjutors, may ever stand on history without a parallel. But what, my countrymen, witheld the ready arm of ven∣geance from executing instant justice on the vile assassins? perhaps you fear'd promiscuous carnage might ensue, and that the innocent might share the fate of those who had performed the infernal deed. But were not all guilty? were you not too tender of the lives of those who came to fix a yoke on your necks? but I must not too severely blame a fault, which great souls only can commit. May that magnificence of spirit which scorns the low pursuits of malice; may that generous compassion which often pre∣serves from ruin, even a guilty villian, forever actuate the noble bosoms of Americans!—But let not the miscreant host vainly imagine that we fear'd their arms. No; them we despis'd; we dread nothing but slavery. Death is the creature of a poltroon's brains; 'tis immortality to sacri∣fice ourselves for the salvation of our country. We fear not death. That gloomy night, the pale-faced moon, and the affrighted stars that hurried through the sky, can wit∣ness that we fear not death. Our hearts, which at the re∣collection, glow with a rage that four revolving years have scarcely taught us to restrain, can witness that we fear not
<PB N="48" REF="018997_0045_0FA912A9C1E25878"/>death; and happy 'tis for those who dared to insult us, that their naked bones are not now piled up an everlasting monu∣ment of Massachuset<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s' bravery. But they retir'd, they fled, and in that flight they found their only safety. We then expected that the hand of public justice would soon inflict that punishment upon the murderers, which, by the laws of GOD and man, they had incurred. But let the unbiass'd pen of a Robertson, or perhaps of some equally fam'd Ame∣rican, conduct this trial before the great tribunal of suc∣ceeding generations. And though the murderers may escape the just resentment of an enraged people; though drowsy justice, intoxicated by the poisonous draught pre∣pared for her cup, still nods upon her rotten seat, yet be assured, such complicated crimes will meet their due re∣ward. Tell me, ye bloody butchers! ye villains high and low! ye wretches who contrived, as well as you who executed the inhuman deed! do you not feel the goads and stings of conscious guilt pierce through your savage bosoms? though some of you may think yourselves exalted to a height that bids defiance to the arms of hu∣man justice, and others shroud yourselves beneath the mask of hypocracy, and build your hopes of safety on the low arts of cunning, chicanery and falshood; yet, do you not sometimes feel the knawings of that worm which never dies? do not the injured shades of Maverick, Gray, Caldwell, Attucks and Carr, attend you in your solitary walks, arrest you even in the midst of your debaucheries, and fill even your dreams with terror? but if the unap∣peased manes of the dead should not disturb their mur∣derers, yet surely even your obdurate hearts must shrink, and your guilty blood must chill within your rigid veins, when you behold the miserable Monk, the wretched victim of your savage cruelty. Observe his tottering knees which scarce sustain his wasted body; look on his hagga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d eyes; mark well the death-like paleness on his fallen cheek, and tell me, does not the sight plant daggers in your souls?
<PB N="49" REF="018997_0046_0FA912A9D64B8118"/>unhappy Monk! cut off in the gay morn of manhood, from all the joys which sweeten life, doom'd to drag on a piti∣ful existence, without even a hope to taste the pleasures of returning health! yet Monk, thou livest not in vain; thou livest a warning to thy country, which sympathizes with thee in thy sufferings; thou livest an affecting, an alarm∣ing instance of the unbounded violence which lust of power, assisted by a standing army, can lead a traitor to commit.</P>
<P>FOR us he bled, and now languishes. The wounds by which he is tortur'd to a lingering death, were aimed at our country! surely the meek-eyed charity can never be∣hold such sufferings with indifference. Nor can her leni∣ent hand forbear to pour oil and wine into these wounds; and to assuage at least, what it cannot heal.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM is ever united with humanity and com∣passion. This noble affection which impels us to sacrifice every thing dear, even life itself, to our country, involves in it a common sympathy and tenderness for every citi∣zen, and must ever have a <HI>particular feeling</HI> for one who suffers in a public cause. Thoroughly persuaded of this, I need not add a word to engage your compassion and bounty towards a fellow-citizen, who, with long protracted anguish, falls a victim to the relentless rage of our com∣mon enemies.</P>
<P>YE dark designing knaves, ye murderers, par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icides! how dare you tread upon the earth, which has drank in the blood of slaughtered innocents shed by your wicked hands? how dare you breathe that air which wafted to the ear of heaven, the groa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of those who fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sacrifice to your ac∣cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed ambition? but if the labouring earth doth not ex∣pand her jaws; if the air you breathe is not commissioned to be the minister of death; yet, hear it, and tremble! the eye of heaven penetrates the darkest chambers of the
<PB N="50" REF="018997_0047_0FA912AA858AAF98"/>soul, traces the leading clue through all the labyrinths which your industrious felly has devised; and you, how∣ever you may have screen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d yourselves from human eyes, must be arraigned, must lift your hands, red with the blood of those whose death you have procur'd, at the tre∣mendous bar of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT I gladly quit the gloomy theme of death, and leave you to improve the thought of that important day, when our naked souls must stand before that Being, from whom nothing can be hid. I would not dwell too long upon the horrid effects which have already followed from quartering reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar troops in this town: let our misfor∣tunes teach posterity to guard against such evils for the future. Standing armies are sometimes (I would by no means say generally, much less universally) composed of persons who have rendered themselves unfit to live in ci∣vil society; who have no other motives of conduct than those which a desire of the present gratification of their passions suggests; who have no property in any country; men who have lost or given up their own liberties, and envy those who enjoy liberty; who are equally indifferent to the glory of a George or a Lewis; who for the addition of one penny a day to their wages, would desert from the christian cross, and fight under the crescent of the Turk∣ish Sultan; from such men as these, what has not a state to fear? with such as these, usurping Caesar passed the Rubicon; with such as these he humbled mighty Rome, and forced the mistress of the world to own a master in a traitor. These are the men whom sceptered robbers now employ to frustrate the designs of GOD, and render vain the bounties which his gracious hand pours indiscrimi∣nately upon his creatures. By these the miserable slaves in Turkey, Persia, and many other extensive countries, are rendered truly wretched, though their air is salubri∣ous, and their soil l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>riously fertile. By these France and Spain, though blessed by nature with all that admi∣nisters
<PB N="51" REF="018997_0048_0FA912AB44493AA0"/>to the convenience of life, have been reduced to that contemptible state in which they now appear; and by these Britain — but if I was possessed of the gift of prophecy, I dare not, except by divine com∣mand, unfold the leaves on which the destiny of that once powerful kingdom is inscribed.</P>
<P>BUT since standing armies are so hurtful to a state, perhaps, my countrymen may demand some substitute, some other means of rendering us secure against the incur∣sions of a foreign enemy. But can you be one moment at a loss? will not a <HI>well disciplined militia</HI> afford you ample security against foreign soes? we want not courage; it is discipline alone in which we are exceeded by the most formidable troops that ever trod the earth. Surely our hearts flutter no more at the sound of war, than did those of the immortal band of Persia, the Macedonian phalanx, the invincible Roman legions, the Turkish Jamssaries, the Gens des Armes of France, or the <HI>well known Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adiers of Britain.</HI> A well disciplined mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tia is a safe, an honor∣able guard to a community like this, whose inhabitants are by nature brave, and are laudably tenacious of that freedom in which they were born. From a well regulated militia we have nothing to fear; their interest is the same with that of the state. When a country is invaded, the militia are ready to appear in its defence; they march into the field with that sortitude which a consciousness of the justice of their cause inspires; they do not jeopard their lives for a master who considers them only as the instruments of his ambition, and whom they regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the daily dispenser of the scanty pittance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> water. No, they fight for their houses, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their wives, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldren, for all who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> est names, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dearest in their heart, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght <HI>proaris &amp; focis,</HI> for their liberty, and for themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for their GOD.

<PB N="52" REF="018997_0049_0FA912AEACE11ED8"/>that of this province now doth; and pardon me if I say,— of this town in particular.—I mean not to boast; I would not excite envy, but manly emulation. We have all one common cause; let it therefore be our only contest, who shall most contribute to the security of the liberties of America. And may the same kind providence which has watched over this country from her infant state, still ena∣ble us to defeat our enemies. I cannot here forbear noti∣cing the signal manner in which the designs of those who wish not well to us have been discovered. The dark deeds of a treacherous cabal, have been brought to public view. You now know the serpents who, whilst cherished in your bosoms, were darting their invenom'd stings into the vitals of the constitution. But the representatives of the people have fixed a mark on those ungrateful monsters, which, though it may not make them so secure as Cain of old, yet renders them at least as infamous. Indeed it would be affrontive to the tutelar deity of this country even to des∣pair of saving it from all the snares which human policy can lay.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, that the British ministry have annexed a salary to the office of the governor of this province, to be paid out of a revenue, raised in America, without our consent. They have attempted to render our courts of justice the instruments of extending the autho∣rity of acts of the British parliament over this colony, by making the judges dependent on the British administrati∣on, for their support. But this people will never be ensla∣ved with their eyes open. The moment they knew that the governor was not such a governor as the charter of the province points out, he lost his power of hurting them. They were al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmed; they suspected him, have guarded a∣gainst him, and he has found that a wife and a brave peo∣ple, when they know their danger, are fruitful in expedi∣ents to escape it.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="018997_0050_0FA912AEFB609B78"/>
THE courts of judicature also so far lost their dignity, by being supposed to be under an undue influence, that our representatives thought it absolutely necessary to resolve that they were bound to declare that they would not re∣ceive any other salary besides that which the general court should grant them; and if they did not make this de∣claration, that it would be the duty of the house to im∣peach them.</P>
<P>GREAT expectations were also formed from the artful scheme of allowing the East-India company to export tea to America, upon their own account. This certainly, had it succeeded, would have effected the purpose of the con∣trivers, and gratified the most sanguine wishes of our ad∣versaries. We soon should have found our trade in the hands of foreigners, and taxes imposed on every thing which we consumed; nor would it have been strange, if, in a few years, a company in London should have purchased an exclusive right of trading to America.—But their plot was soon discovered. The people soon were aware of the poison which with so much craft and subtility had been concealed: loss and disgrace ensued: and, perhaps, this long-concerted master-piece of policy, may issue in the toral disuse of tea, in this country, which will eventually be the saving of the lives and the estates of thousands— yet while we rejoice that the adversary has not hitherto prevailed against us, let us by no means put off the har∣ness. Restless malice, and disappointed ambition, will still suggest new measures to our inveterate <HI>enemies.</HI> There∣fore let <HI>us</HI> also be ready to take the field whenever danger calls; let us be united and strengthen the hands of each other, by promoting a general union among us. Much has been done by the committees of correspondence for this and the other towns of this province, towards uniting the inhabitants; let them still go on and prosper. Much has been done by the committees of correspondence, for the houses of assembly: in this and our sister colonies, for
<PB N="54" REF="018997_0051_0FA912B2C67A9990"/>uniting the inhabitants of the whole continent, for the security of their common interest. May success ever at∣tend their generous endeavours. But permit me here to suggest a general congress of deputies, from the several houses of assembly, on the continent, as the most effectual prethod of establishing such an union, as the present posture of our affairs requires. At such a congress, a firm foun∣dation may be laid for the security of our rights and li∣berties; a system may be formed for our common safety, by a strict adherence to which, we shall be able to frustrate any attempts to overthrow our constitution; restore peace and harmony to America, and secure honor and wealth to Great-Britain, even against the inclinations of her mini∣sters, whose duty it is to study her welfare; and we shall also free ourselves from those unmannerly pillagers who impudently tell us, that they are licenced by an act of the British parliament, to thrust their dirty hands into the poc∣kets of every American. But, I trust, the happy time will come, when, with the besom of destruction, those noxious vermin will be swept forever from the streets of Boston.</P>
<P>SURELY you never will tamely suffer this country to be a den of thieves. Remember, my friends, from whom you sprang —Let not a meanness of spirit, unknown to those whom you boast of as your fathers, excite a thought to the dishonor of your mothers. I conjure you by all that is dear, by all that is honorable, by all that is sacred, not only that ye pray, but that you act; that, if necessa∣ry, ye fight, and even die, for the prosperity of our Jeru∣salem. Break in sunder, with noble disdain, the bonds with which the Philistines have bound you. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed by the soft arts of luxury and offeminacy, into the pit digged for your destruction. De∣spise the glare of wealth. That people who pay greater respect to a wealthy villain, than to an honest upright man in poverty, almost deserve to be enslaved; they plainly shew that wealth, however it may be acquired, is, in their esteem, to be preferred to virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="018997_0052_0FA912B3847C9AF8"/>
BUT I thank GOD, that America abounds in men who are superior to all temptation, whom nothing can divert from a steady pursuit of the interest of their country; who are at once its ornament and safe-guard. And sure I am, I should not incur your displeasure, if I paid a respect so justly due to their much-honoured characters, in this place; but when I name an ADAMS, such a numerous host of fellow-patriots rush upon my mind, that I fear it would take up too much of your time, should I attempt to call over the illustrious roll: but your grateful hearts will point you to the men; and their revered names, in all succeeding times, shall grace the annals of America.— From them, let us, my friends, take example; from them let us catch the divine enthusiasm; and feel, each for himself, the GOD-like pleasure of diffusing happiness on all around us; of delivering the oppressed from the iron grasp of tyranny; of changing the hoarse complaints and bitter moans of wretched slaves, into those cheerful songs, which freedom and contentment must inspire. There is a heart-felt satisfaction in reflecting on our exertions for the public weal, which all the sufferings an enraged ty∣rant can inflict, will never take away; which the in∣gratitude and reproaches of those whom we have saved from ruin, cannot rob us of. The virtuous assertor of the rights of mankind, merits a reward, which even a want of success in his endeavours to save his country, the heaviest misfortune which can befal a genuine patriot, cannot en∣tirely prevent him from receiving.</P>
<P>I HAVE the most animating confidence that the present noble struggle for liberty, will terminate gloriously for America. And let us play the man for our GOD, and for the cities of our GOD; while we are using the means in our power, let us humbly commit our righteous cause to the great LORD of the universe, who loveth righteousness and hateth iniquity.—And having secured the approbation of our hearts, by a faithful and unwearied discharge of
<PB N="56" REF="018997_0053_0FA912B5D31F2C10"/>our duty to our country, let us joyfully leave her im∣portant concerns in the hands of HIM who raiseth up and putteth down the empires and kingdoms of the world as HE pleases; and with cheerful submission to HIS sovereign will, devoutly say,</P>
<P><HI>"Although the fig-tree shall not blessom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet we will re∣joice in the LORD, we will joy in the GOD of our sal∣vation."</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY EVER-HONORED FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not without the most humiliating conviction of my want of ability that I now appear before you: but the sense I have of the obligation I am under to obey the calls of my country at all times, together with an ani∣mating recollection of your indulgence, exhibited upon so many occasions, has induced me, once more, undeserving as I am, to throw myself upon that candor which looks with kindness on the feeblest efforts of an honest mind.</P>
<P>YOU will not now expect the elegance, the learning, the fire, the enrapturing strains of eloquence which charm∣ed you when a LOVELL, a CHURCH, or a HANCOCK spake; but you will permit me to say that with a sincerity, equal to theirs, I mourn over my bleeding country: With them I weep at her distress, and with them deeply resent the many injuries she has received from the hands of cruel and unreasonable men.</P>

THAT personal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property, or an exclusive right to dispose of what he has honestly acquired by his own labour, neces∣sarily arises therefrom, are truths which common sense has placed beyond the reach of contradiction. And no man, or body of men, can, without being guilty of flagrant injustice, claim a right to dispose of the persons of acquisitions of any other man or body of men, unless it can be proved that such a right has arisen from some compact between the parties in which it has been explicitly and freely granted.</P>
<P>IF I may be indulged in taking a retrospective view of the first settlement of our country, it will be easy to de∣termine with what degree of justice the late parliament of Great-Britain have assumed the power of giving away <HI>that property</HI> which the Americans have earned by their labour.</P>
<P>OUR fathers having nobly resolved never to wear the yoke of despotism, and seeing the European world, at that time, through indolence and cowardice, falling a prey to tyranny, bravely threw themselves upon the bosom of the ocean; determined to find a place in which they might enjoy their freedom, or perish in the glorious attempt. Approving heaven beheld the favourite ark dancing upon the waves, and graciously preserved it until the chosen families were brought in safety to these western regions. They found the land swarming with savages, who threat∣ened death with every kind of torture. But savages, and death with torture, were far less terrible than slavery: nothing was so much the object of their abhorrence as a tyrant's power: they knew that it was more safe to dwell with man in his most unpolished state, than in a country where arbitrary power prevails. Even <HI>anarchy itself,</HI> that bugbear held up by the tools of power (though truly to be deprecated) is infinitely less dangerous to mankind than <HI>arbitrary government. Anarchy</HI> can be but of short dura∣tion;
<PB N="59" REF="018997_0056_0FA912BC8BA91F68"/>for when men are at liberty to pursue that course which is most conducive to their own happiness, they will soon come into i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and from the rudest state of nature, order and good government must soon arise. But <HI>tyranny,</HI> when once established, entails its curses on a nation to the latest period of time; unless some daring genius, inspired by heaven, shall, unappalled by danger, bravely form and execute the arduous design of restoring liberty and life to his enslaved, murdered country.</P>
<P>THE tools of power, in every age, have racked their in∣ventions to justify the <HI>few</HI> in sporting with the happiness of the <HI>many;</HI> and, having found their sophistry too weak to hold mankind in bondage, have impiously dared to force religion, the daughter of the king of heaven, to be∣come a prostitute in the service of hell. They taught that princes, honored with the name of christian, might bid defiance to the founder of their faith, might pillage Pagan countries and deluge them with blood, only because they boasted themselves to be the disciples of that teacher who strictly charged his followers to <HI>do to others as they would that others should do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS country, having been discovered by an English subject, in the year 1630, was (according to the system which the blind superstition of those time supported) deem∣ed the property of the crown of England. Our ancestors, when they resolved to quit their native soil, obtained from King James, a grant of certain lands in North-America. This they probably did to silence the cavils of their ene∣mies, for it cannot be doubted, but they despised the pre∣tended right which he claimed thereto. Certain it is, that he might, with equal propriety and justice, have made them a grant of the pran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Jupiter. And their subsequent con∣duct plainly shew that they were two well acquainted with humanity, and the principles of natural equity, to suppose that the grant gave them any right to take p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esession;
<PB N="60" REF="018997_0057_0FA912BD3B595430"/>they therefore entered into a treaty with the natives, and bought from them the lands: nor have I ever yet obtained any information that our ancestors ever pleaded, or that the natives ever regarded the grant from the English crown: the business was transacted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties in the same independent manner that it would have been, had neither of them ever known or heard of the island of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>HAVING become the honest proprietors of the soil, they immediately applied themselves to the cultivation of it; and they soon beheld the virgin earth teeming with richest fruits, a grateful recompence for their unwearied toil. The fields began to wave with repining harvests, and the late barren wilderness was seen to blossom like the rose. The savage natives saw with wonder the delightful change, and quickly formed a scheme to obtain <HI>that</HI> by fraud or force, <HI>which</HI> nature meant as the reward of industry alone. But the illustrious emigrants soon convinced the rude invaders, that they were not less ready to take the field for battle than for labor; and the insidious foe was driven from their borders as often as he ventured to disturb them. The crown of England looked with indifference on the contest; our ancestors were left alone to combat with the natives. Nor is there any reason to believe, that it ever was intended by the one party, or expected by the other, that the <HI>grantor</HI> should defend and maintain the <HI>grantees</HI> in the peaceable possession of the lands named in the patents. And it ap∣pears plainly, from the history of those times, that neither the prince, nor the people of England, thought themselves much interested in the matter. They had not then any idea of a thousandth part of those advantages which they since <HI>have,</HI> and we are most heartily willing they should <HI>still continue</HI> to reap from us.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>when,</HI> at an infinite expence of toil and blood, this widely extended continent had been cultivated and defend∣ed:
<PB N="61" REF="018997_0058_0FA912BDF776A390"/><HI>when</HI> the hardy adventurers justly expected that they and their descendants should peaceably have enjoyed the harvest of those fields which they had sown, and the fruit of those vineyards which they had planted; this country was <HI>then</HI> thought worthy the attention of the British mini∣stry; and the only justifiable and only successful means of rendering the colonies serviceable to Britain were adopted. By an intercourse of friendly offices, the two countries be∣came so united in affection, that they thought not of any distinct or separate interests, they found both countries flourishing and happy. Britain saw her commerce extend∣ed, and her wealth increased; her lands raised to an im∣mense value; her fleets riding triumphant on the ocean; the terror of her arms spreading to every quarter of the globe. The colonist found himself free, and thought himself se∣cure: he dwelt <HI>under his own vine, and under his own fig∣tree, and had none to make him afraid:</HI> he knew indeed that by purchasing the manufactures of Great-Britain, he contributed to its greatness: he knew that all the wealth that his labor produced centered in Great-Britain: But <HI>that,</HI> far from exciting his envy, filled him with the highest pleasure; <HI>that thought</HI> supported him in all his toils.— When the business of the day was past, he solaced himself with the <HI>contemplation,</HI> or perhaps entertained his listening family with the <HI>recital</HI> of some great, some glorious trans∣action which shines conspicuous in the history of Britain: or, perhaps, his elevated fancy led him to foretel, with a kind of enthusiastic confidence, the glory, power, and du∣ration of an empire which should extend from one end of the earth to the other: he saw, or thought he saw, the British nation risen to a pitch of grandeur which cast a veil over the Roman glory, and, ravished with the praeview, boasted a race of British kings, whose names should echo through those realms where Cyras, Alexander, and the Caesars were unknown; <HI>princes</HI> for whom millions of grate∣ful subjects redeemed from slavery and Pagan ignorance, should, with thankful tongues, offer up their prayers and
<PB N="62" REF="018997_0059_0FA912BEEAF9C908"/>praises to that transcendently great and beneficent being, <HI>by whom Kings reign and Princes decree justice.</HI></P>
<P>THESE pleasing connections might have continued; these delightsome prospects might have been every day extended; and even the reveries of the most warm imagination might have been realized; but unhappily for us, unhappily for Britain, the madness of an avaricious minister of state, has drawn a sable curtain over the charming scene, and in its stead has brought upon the stage, discord, envy, hatred, and revenge, with civil war close in their rear.</P>
<P>SOME demon, in an evil hour, suggested to a short-sighted financier, the hateful project of transfering the whole pro∣perty of the King's subjects in America, to his subjects in Britain. The claim of the British parliament to tax the colonies, can never be supported but by such a TRANSFER; for the right of the house of commons of Great-Britain, to originate any tax, or grant money, is altogether derived from their being elected by the people of Great-Britain to act for them; and the people of Great-Britain cannot confer on their <HI>representatives</HI> a right to give or grant any thing which <HI>they themselves</HI> have not a right to give or grant <HI>personally.</HI> Therefore it follows, that if the members chosen by the people of Great-Britain, to represent them in par∣liament, have, by virtue of their being so chosen, any right to give or grant American property, or to lay any tax upon the lands or persons of the colonists, it is because the lands and people in the colonies are bona fide, owned by, and justly belonging to the people of Great-Britain. But (as has been before observed) every man has a right to personal freedom, consequently a right to enjoy what is ac∣quired by his own labor. And as it is evident that the property in this country has been acquired by our own labor; it is the duty of the people of Great-Britain, to produce some compact in which we have explicitly given up to them a right to dispose of our <HI>persons</HI> or <HI>property.</HI>—
<PB N="63" REF="018997_0060_0FA912C2689D9928"/>Until this is done, every attempt of theirs, or of those whom they have deputed to act for them, to give or grant any part of our property, is directly repugnant to every principle of reason and natural justice. But I may boldly say, that such a compact never existed, no, not even in imagination. Nevertheless, the representatives of a nation, long famed for justice and the exercise of every noble vir∣tue, have been prevailed on to adopt the fatal scheme; and although the dreadful consequences of this wicked po∣licy have already shaken the empire to its centre; yet still it is persisted in. Regardless of the voice of reason— deaf to the prayers and supplications—and unaffected with the flowing tears of suffering millions, the British mini∣stry still hug the darling idol; and every rolling year af∣fords fresh instances of the absurd devotion with which they worship it. Alas! how has the folly, the distraction of the British councils, blasted our swelling hopes, and spread a gloom over this western hemisphere.</P>
<P>THE hearts of Britons and Americans, which lately felt the generous glow of mutual confidence and love, now burn with jealously and rage. Though, but of yesterday, I recollect (deeply affected at the ill-boding change) the happy hours that past whilst Britain and America rejoiced in the prosperity and greatness of each other (heaven grant those halcyon days may soon return.) But now the Bri∣ton too often looks on the American with an envious eye, taught to consider his just plea for the enjoyment of his earnings, as the effect of pride and stubborn opposition to the parent country. Whilst the American beholds the Bri∣ton as the ruffian, ready <HI>first</HI> to take away his property, and <HI>next,</HI> what is still dearer to every virtuous man, the liberty of his country.</P>
<P>WHEN the measures of administration had disgusted the colonies to the highest degree, and the people of Great Britain had, by artifice and falshood, been irritated against
<PB N="64" REF="018997_0061_0FA912C282374E78"/>America, an army was sent over to enforce submission to certain acts of the British parliament, which reason scorned to countenance, and which placemen and pensioners were found unable to support.</P>
<P>MARTIAL law and the government of a well regu∣lated city, are so entirely different, that it has always been considered as improper to quarter troops in populous cities; frequent disputes must necessarily arise between the citizen and the soldier, even if no previous animosities subsist. And it is further certain, from a consideration of the nature of mankind, as well as from constant experience, that standing armies always endanger the liberty of the subject. But when the people on the one part, considered the army as sent to enslave them, and the army on the other, were taught to look on the people as in a state of rebellion, it was but just to fear the most disagreeable consequences. Our fears, we have seen, were but too well grounded.</P>
<P>THE many injuries offered to the town I pass over in silence. I cannot now mark out the path which led to that unequalled scene of horror, the sad rememberance of which, takes the full possession of my soul. The sangui∣nary theatre again opens itself to view. The baleful im∣ages of terror croud around me—and discontented ghosts, with hollow groans, appear to solemnize the anniversary of the FIFTH of MARCH.</P>
<P>APPROACH we then the melancholy walk of death. Hither let me call the gay companion; here let him drop a farewel tear upon that body which so late he saw vigor∣ous and warm with social mirth—hither let me lead the tender mother to weep over her beloved son—come widow∣ed mourner, here satiate thy grief; behold thy murdered husband gasping on the ground, and to complete the pom∣pous show of wretchedness, bring in each hand thy infant
<PB N="65" REF="018997_0062_0FA912C337E4D680"/>children to bewail their father's fate—take heed, ye orphan babes, lest, whilst your streaming eyes are fixed upon the ghastly corpse, <HI>your feet slide on the stones bespattered with your father's brains</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> had been shot through the body, and had fal∣len dead on the ground, a bayonet was pushed through his skull; part of the bone being broken, his brains fell out upon the pavement.</NOTE>. Enough! this tragedy need not be heightened by an infant weltering in the blood of him that gave it birth. Nature, reluctant, shrinks already from the view, and the chilled blood rolls slowly backward to its fountain. We wildly stare about, and with amazement, ask, who spread this ruin round us? what wretch has dared deface the image of his GOD? has haughty France, or cruel Spain, sent forth her myrmidons? has the grim sa∣vage rushed again from the far distant wilderness? or does some fiend, fierce from the depth of hell, with all the ran∣corous malice, which the apostate damned can feel, twang her destructive bow, and hurl her deadly arrows at our breast? no; none of these—but, how astonishing! it is the hand of Britain that inflicts the wound. The arms of George, our rightful king, have been employed to shed that blood, when justice, or the honor of his crown, had called his subjects to the field.</P>
<P>BUT pity, grief, astonishment, with all the softer movements of the soul, must now give way to stronger passions. Say, fellow-citizens, what dreadful thought now swells your heaving bosoms—you fly to arms—sharp indignation flashes from each eye—revenge gnashes her iron teeth—death grins an hideous smile, secure to drench his greedy jaws in human gore—whilst hovering furies darken all the air.</P>
<P>BUT stop, my bold adventurous countrymen, stain not your weapons with the blood of Britons. Attend to reason's voice—humanity puts in her claim—and sues to be again
<PB N="66" REF="018997_0063_0FA912C727D134F0"/>admitted to her wonted seat, the bosom of the brave. Re∣venge is far beneath the noble mind. Many perhaps, com∣pelled to rank among the vile assassins, do, from their in most souls, detest the barbarous action. The winged death, shot from your arms, may chance to pierce some breast that bleeds already for your injured country.</P>
<P>THE storm subsides—a solemn pause ensues—you spare, upon condition they depart. They go—they quit your city—they no more shall give offence.—Thus closes the important drama.</P>
<P>And could it have been conceived that we again should have seen a British army in our land, sent to enforce obedi∣ence to acts of parliament destructive of our liberty. But the royal ear, far distant from this western world, has been assaulted by the tongue of slander; and villains, traitorous alike to king and country, have prevail'd upon a gracious prince to cloath his countenance with wrath, and to erect the hostile banner against a people ever affectionate and loyal to him and his illustrious predecessors of the house of Hanover. Our streets are again filled with armed men: our harbour is crouded with ships of war; but these cannot intimidate us; our liberty must be preserved; it is far dearer than <HI>life,</HI> we hold it even dear as our <HI>allegiance;</HI> we must defend it against the attacks of <HI>friends</HI> as well as <HI>ene∣mies;</HI> we cannot suffer even BRITONS to ravish it from us.</P>
<P>No longer could we reflect, with generous pride, on the heroic actions of our American fore fathers,—no longer boast our origin from that far-famed island, whose warlike sons have so often drawn their well-tried swords to save her from the ravages of tyranny; could we, but for a moment, entertain the thought of giving up our liberty. The man who meanly will submit to wear a <HI>shackle,</HI> contemns the noblest gift of heaven, and impiously affronts the GOD that made him free.</P>

IT was a maxim of the Roman people, which eminently conduced to the greatness of that state, never to despair of the commonwealth. The maxim may prove as salutary to us now, as it did to them. Short-sighted mortals see not the numerous links of small and great events, which form the chain on which the fate of kings and nations is sus∣pended. Ease and prosperity (tho' pleasing for a day) have often sunk a people into effeminacy and sloth. Hard∣ships and dangers (tho' we forever strive to shun them) have frequently called forth such virtues, as have com∣manded the applause and reverence of an admiring world. Our country loudly calls you to be circumspect, vigilant, active and brave. Perhaps (all gracious Heaven avert it) perhaps, the power of Britain, a nation great in war, by some malignant influence, may be employed to enslave you: but let not even this discourage you. Her arms, 'tis true, have fill'd the world with terror: her troops have reap'd the laurels of the field: her fleets have rode triumphant on the sea,—and <HI>when,</HI> or <HI>where,</HI> did <HI>you,</HI> my countrymen, depart inglorious from the field of fight
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patience with which this people have borne the repeated injuries which have been heaped upon them, and their unwilling∣ness to take any sanguinary measures, has, very injudiciously, been ascribed to cowardice, by persons both here and in Great-Britain. I most heartily wish, that an opinion, so erroneous in itself, and so fatal in its consequences, might be utterly removed before it be too late: and I think nothing <HI>further</HI> necessary to convince every in∣telligent man, that the conduct of this people is owing to the <HI>tender regard</HI> which they have for their fellow-men, and an <HI>utter abhor∣rence to the shedding of human blood, than</HI> a little attention to their general temper and disposition, discovered when they cannot be supposed to be under any apprehension of danger to themselves.— I will only mention the universal detestation which they shew to every act of cruelty, by whom and upon whomsoever committed; the mild spirit of their laws; the very sew crimes to which capi∣tal penalties are annexed; and the very great backwardness which both courts and juries discover, in condemning persons charged with <HI>capital crimes.—</HI> But if any should think this observation not to the purpose, I readily appeal to those gentlemen of the army who have been in the camp, or in the field, with the Americans.</NOTE>? <HI>you</HI> too can shew the trophies of your <HI>forefather</HI>'s victories and your <HI>own;</HI> can name the fortresses and battles you have won; and many of you count the honorable scars of wounds received, whilst fighting for your king and country.</P>
<P>WHERE justice is the standard, heaven is the warrior's
<PB N="68" REF="018997_0065_0FA912C8787D7CA0"/>shield: but conscious guilt unnerves the arm that lifts the sword against the innocent. Britain, united with these colonies, by commerce and affection, by interest and blood, may mock the threats of France and Spain: may be the seat of universal empire. But should America, either by <HI>force,</HI> or those more dangerous engines, <HI>luxury</HI> and <HI>cor∣ruption,</HI> ever be brought into a state of vassalage, Britain must lose <HI>her</HI> freedom also. No longer shall she sit the <HI>empress</HI> of the sea: her ships no more shall waft her thun∣ders over the wide ocean: the <HI>wreath</HI> shall wither on her temples: her weakened arm shall be unable to defend her coasts: and she, at last, must bow her venerable head to some proud foreigner's despotic rule.</P>
<P>BUT if, from past events, we may venture to form a judgment of the future, we justly may expect that the de∣vices of our enemies will but increase the triumphs of our country. I <HI>must</HI> indulge a hope that <HI>Britain</HI>'s liberty, as well as <HI>ours,</HI> will eventually be preserved by the virtue of America.</P>
<P>THE attempt of the British parliament to raise a reve∣nue from America, and our denial of their right to do it, have excited an almost universal inquiry into the rights of mankind in general, and of British subjects in particular; the necessary result of which must be such a liberality of sentiment, and such a jealousy of those in power, as will,
<PB N="69" REF="018997_0066_0FA912C9343D3310"/>better than an adamantine wall, secure us against the future approaches of despotism.</P>
<P>THE malice of the <HI>Boston</HI> port-bill has been defeated in a very considerable degree, by giving <HI>you</HI> an opportunity of <HI>deserving,</HI> and <HI>our brethren</HI> in this and our sister-colonies an opportunity of <HI>bestowing,</HI> those benefactions which have de∣lighted your friends and astonished your enemies, not only in America, but in Europe also. And what is more valu∣able still, the sympathetic feelings for a brother in distress, and the grateful emotions excited in the breast of him who finds relief, must forever endear each to the other, and form those indissoluble bonds of friendship and affection, on which the preservation of our rights so evidently de∣pend.</P>
<P>THE mutilation of our charter, has made every other colony jealous for its own; for <HI>this,</HI> if once submitted to by us, would set on float the property and government of every British settlement upon the continent. If charters are not deemed sacred, how miserably precarious is every thing founded upon them.</P>
<P>EVEN the sending troops to put these acts in execution, is not without advantages to us. The exactness and beau∣ty of their discipline inspire our youth with ardor in the pursuit of military knowledge. Charles the <HI>invincible,</HI> taught Peter the <HI>great,</HI> the art of war. The battle of Pultowa convinced Charles of the proficiency Peter had made.</P>
<P>OUR country is in danger, but not to be despaired of. Our enemies are numerous and powerful—but we have many friends, determining to BE FREE, and heaven and earth will aid the RESOLUTION. On <HI>you</HI> depend the for∣tunes of America. <HI>You</HI> are to decide the important ques∣tion, on which rest the happiness and liberty of millions
<PB N="70" REF="018997_0067_0FA912CBC2D207D8"/>yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves. The faltering tongue of hoary age calls on you to support your country. The lisping infant raises its suppliant hands, imploring de∣fence against the monster slavery. Your fathers look from their celestial seats with smiling approbation on their sons, who boldly stand forth in the cause of virtue; but sternly frown upon the inhuman miscreant, who, to secure the loaves and fishes to himself, would breed a serpent to de∣stroy his children.</P>
<P>BUT, pardon me, my fellow-citizens, I know you want not zeal or fortitude. You will maintain your rights or perish in the generous struggle. However difficult the combat, you never will decline it when freedom is the prize. An independence on Great-Britain is not our aim. No, our wish is, that Britain and the colonies may, like the oak and ivy, grow and increase in strength together. But whilst the infatuated plan of making one part of the empire slaves to the other, is persisted in; the interest and safety of <HI>Britain,</HI> as well as the <HI>colonies,</HI> require that the wise measures, recommended by the honourable the conti∣nental congress, be steadily pursued; whereby the unna∣tural contest between a parent honoured, and a child be∣loved, may probably be brought to such an issue, as that the peace and happiness of both may be established upon a lasting basis. But if these pacific measures are ineffectual, and it appears that the only way to safety, is through fields of blood, I know you will not turn your faces from your foes, but will, undauntedly, press forward, until tyranny is trodden under foot, and you have fixed your adored goddess LIBERTY, fast by a BRUNSWICK's side, on the Ameri∣rican throne.</P>
<P>YOU <HI>then,</HI> who nobly have espoused your country's cause, who generously have sacrificed wealth and ease—<HI>who</HI> have despised the pomp and shew of tinseled greatness—refused the summons to the festive board—been deaf to the alluring
<PB N="71" REF="018997_0068_0FA912CFDA95EC68"/>calls of luxury and mirth—<HI>who</HI> have forsaken the downy pillow, to keep your vigils by the midnight lamp, for the salvation of your invaded country, that you might break the fowler's snare, and disappoint the vulture of his prey; <HI>you</HI> then will reap that harvest of renown which you so justly have deserved. Your country shall pay her grateful tribute of applause. Even the children of your most inveterate enemies, ashamed to tell from whom they sprang, while they, in secret, curse their stupid, cruel parents, shall join the general voice of gratitude to those who broke the fetters which their father's forged.</P>
<P>HAVING redeemed your country, and secured the bles∣sing to future generations, <HI>who,</HI> fired by your example, shall emulate your virtues, and learn from <HI>you</HI> the heavenly art of making millions happy; with heart-felt joy—with tran∣sports all your own, YOU CRY, the GLORIOUS WORK IS DONE. Then drop the mantle to some young ELISHA, and take your seats with kindred spirits in your native skies.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the ambition of princes induces them to break over the sacred barriers of social compact, and to violate those rights, which it is their duty to defend, they will leave no methods unessayed to bring the people to acquiesce in their unjustifiable encroachments.</P>
<P>IN this cause, the pens of venal authors have, in every age, been drawn: with Machiavelian subtilty, they have laboured to persuade mankind, that their public happiness consisted in being subject to uncontrouled power; that they were incapable of judging concerning the mysteries of go∣vernment; and that it was their interest to deliver their estates, their liberties, and their lives, into the hands of an absolute monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="018997_0070_0FA912D0BB5A1B68"/>
MITRED hypocrites, and cringing, base-fouled priests, have impiously dared to enlist the oracles of GOD into the service of despotism; to assert that, by the command of the supreme law-giver, we are bound to surrender our rights into the hands of the first bold tyrant who dares to seize them; and that when they are so seized, it is rebel∣lion against GOD, and treason against the prince, for us to attempt to resume them.</P>
<P>DEPRAVED as is the human understanding, it hath yet strength enough to discern the ridiculous fallacy of these assertions: the votaries of ignorance and superstition may, indeed, be imposed upon by them. When we place un∣limited confidence in our civil or spiritual fathers, we can swallow, with ease, the most improbable dogmas: but there are feelings in the human heart, which compel men to recognize their own rights—to venerate the majesty of the people—and to despise the insult which is offered to their understandings, by these doating absurdities. Had princes no other methods to accomplish their purposes, could they not establish their usurpation, without convin∣cing mens judgments of their utility? they would be more harmless to mankind than they have ever yet been. They might be surrounded with the fascinating gewgaws of re∣gal pomp; a few parasites might bow the knee before these idols of their own creating; the weak and the wick∣ed might obey their mandates; but the baneful influence which they now have upon the interests of individuals, and of society, would come to a period: they would not revel in the spoils of nations, nor trample upon the ruins of public liberty.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS of this, they have used arguments, and pursued methods, entirely different from these, to effect their designs; instead of convincing the understandings, they have addressed themselves to the passions of men: the arts of bribery and corruption have been tried with a fatal
<PB N="75" REF="018997_0071_0FA912D182EBB610"/>success: men, <HI>we</HI> know, have sold their children, their country, and their GOD, for a small quantity of painted dirt, <HI>which will perish with the using.</HI></P>
<P>EXTENSIVE as are the revenues of princes, they are still inadequate to the purpose of bribing large communi∣ties to submit to their pleasure; corrupting therefore a few, they have overawed the rest; from small beginnings, and under specious pretenses, they will raise a standing military force, the most successful engine ever yet weilded by the hand of lawless domination.</P>
<P>WITH such a force, it is easy for an ambitious prince, possessed by nature of very slender abilities, to subvert every principle of liberty in the constitution of his govern∣ment, and to render his people the most abject of slaves: if any individual feels the injury done to his country, and wishes to restore it to a state of happiness, with a bayonet at his breast, a dragoon will compel him to silence: if the people, awakened to see their interest and their duty, as∣semble for the same purpose, a military force is at hand to subdue them, and by leaden arguments, to convince them of their error.</P>
<P>AN easy task would it be to enlarge upon the fatal con∣sequences of keeping up such a standing army in time of peace, and of quartering a lawless body of men, who de∣spise the just restraints of civil authority, in free and po∣pulous cities: that no vestige of freedom can remain in a state where such a force existed: that the morals of the peo∣ple will be gradually corrupted: that they will contract such an habit of tame submission, as to become an easy prey to the brutal tyrant who rules them, hath been here∣tofore largely and plainly demonstrated, by persons so much more capable of doing it, than he who is speaking, that it would be presumption in him to attempt it now.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="018997_0072_0FA912D24113ECB8"/>
THERE is no need of recurring to the ancient histories of Greece and Rome, for instances of these truths. The British nation, once famous for its attachment to freedom, and enthusiastically jealous of its rights, is now become a great tame beast, which fetches and carries for any mini∣ster who pleases to employ it.</P>
<P>ENGLISHMEN have been wont to boast of the excel∣lence of their constitution; to boast that it contained whatever was excellent in every form of government hi∣therto, by the wit of man, devised: in their king, whose power was limited, they have asserted that they enjoyed the advantages of monarchy, without fear of its evils: while their house of commons, chosen by the suffrages of the people, and dependant upon them, represented a re∣public, their house of peers, forming a balance of power between the king and the people, gave them the benefit of an aristocracy. In theory, the British constitution is, on many accounts, excellent; but when we observe it re∣duced to practice, when we observe the British government, as it has been, for a long course of years, administered, we must be convinced that its boasted advantages are not real: the management of the public revenue, the appointment of civil and military officers, are vested in the king: improving these advantages which these powers give him, he hath found means to corrupt the other branches of the legislature; Bri∣tons please themselves with the thought of being free; their tyrant suffers them to enjoy the shadow, whilst he himself grasps the substance of power. Impossible would it have been for the kings of England to have acquired such an exorbitant power, had they not had a standing army under their command: with the officers of this army, they have bribed men to sacrifice the rights of their country: having artfully got their arms out of the hands of the people, with their mercenary forces they have awed them into submission. When they have appeared, at any time, dis∣posed to assert their freedom, these troops have been ready
<PB N="77" REF="018997_0073_0FA912D30546FF78"/>to obey the mandates of their sovereign, to imbrue their hands in the blood of their brethren.</P>
<P>HAVING found the efficacy of this method to quell a spirit of liberty in the people of Great-Britain, the <HI>righ∣teous</HI> administration of the <HI>righteous</HI> king George the third, determined to try the experiment upon the people of Ame∣rica. To fright us into submission to their unjustifiable claims, they sent a military force to the town of Boston. This day leads us to reflect upon the fatal effects of the measure! by their intercourse with troops, made up in general of the most abandoned of men, the morals of our youth were corrupted: the temples and the day of our GOD were scandalously prophaned: we experienced the most provoking insults; and at length saw the streets of Boston strewed with the corpses of five of its inhabitants, murdered in cool blood, by the British mercenaries.</P>
<P>THE indignant rage which swelled your bosoms upon this occasion—the fortitude and humanity which you dis∣covered—the anguish of the friends and relatives of the dead and wounded, with all the horrors of that memo∣rable night, have been painted in vivid colours by an HANCOCK and a WARREN: they have shewn the necessity of those exertions made by the town, which defeated, at that time, the designs of the enemies to Ame∣rican liberty, and preserved us, for the present, from the calamities of war.</P>
<P>BUT the past year hath presented us with a tragedy more striking, because more extensive, than this: a tragedy, which more plainly proves the fatal effects of keeping up standing armies in time of peace, than any arguments whatsoever: we have seen the ground crimsoned with the gore of hundreds of our fellow-citizens;—we have seen the first city in America, for wealth and extent, depopulated—
<PB N="78" REF="018997_0074_0FA912D510123E18"/>—we have seen others destroyed, and heard our savage enemies breathing out thirstings for our blood.</P>
<P>FINDING their arts insufficient to flatter, or their trea∣sures to bribe, the people of America out of their freedom, the British government determined, by force, to subjugate them to their arbitrary will; in consequence of this de∣termination, a large party of their troops marched from Boston, on the morning of the ever-memorable nineteenth of April last: flushed with the hopes of certain victory, and defying the armies of the living GOD, they broke through every divine and political obligation; they wantoned in cruelty; they shed again American blood.</P>
<P>AROUSED by the unprovoked injury, like a lion awak∣ing from his slumber, we sprang to arms! we felt ourselves inspired with the spirit of our ancestors; we heard our bre∣thren's blood crying to us for vengeance; we rushed into the midst of battle: we compelled our enemies to betake them∣selves to disgraceful flight; we pursued them with avidity, and desisted not till they took refuge in that city, of which, by fraud and treachery, they had possessed themselves.</P>
<P>TRUSTING to the divine protection, from that hour we determined never to sheathe the sword, till we had re∣paration for our injuries; till we had secured our own free∣dom and the freedom of our posterity: from that hour the den of enemies hath been surrounded by an American army, <HI>brave and determined:</HI> although they had before boasted of their superiority to all the troops in the world, they have scarcely dared to set their feet out of their strong holds since that time; and instead of ravaging the American continent in a single compaign, with a single regiment, they have proceeded—<HI>one mile and an half</HI> in the conquest of it.</P>
<P>THE heights of Charlestown witnessed to the world, that Americans, fighting in the cause of freedom, were a
<PB N="79" REF="018997_0075_0FA912D59DA45548"/>formidable foe: although they were surrounded by troops hitherto deemed invincible; although they saw the ha∣bitations of their countrymen inveloped with flames; al∣though cannon roared on every quarter, and they beheld scenes of desolation and bloodshed, to which they were entirely unused, yet they retired not till they had com∣pelled their enemy twice to retreat, and had expended the whole of their ammunition: the British forces gained the ground, but they lost the flower of their army.</P>
<P>FROM one end of the continent to the other, a series of successes hath attended the American arms; instead of having troops of savages poured down to our frontiers (which the murderous policy of the tyrant of Britain induced him to attempt) we have, through the favour of heaven, carried our victorious arms into the very bowels of Canada; instead of having our stores and provisions cut off by the enemy, we have made important captures from them: success hath crowned our enterprizes, while disappointment hath fol∣lowed those who oppose us.</P>
<P>THAT elation of spirit, which is excited by our victories, is damped by our feeling the calamities of war. To hear the expiring groans of our beloved countrymen; to behold the flames of our habitations, once the abodes of peace and plenty, ascending to heaven; to see ruin and desolation spread over our fruitful villages, must occasion sensations in the high<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egree painful.</P>
<P>THIS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, upon which the gloomy scene was first opened, calls upon us to mourn for the heroes who have already died in the bed of honour, fighting for GOD and their country. Especially, does it lead us to recollect the name and the virtues of General WARREN! the kind, the humane, the benevolent friend, in the private walks of life; the inflexible patriot, the undaunted commander in his public sphere, deserves to be recollected with gra∣titude
<PB N="80" REF="018997_0076_0FA912D5F8241DB8"/>and esteem! this audience, acquainted, in the most intimate manner, with his numberless virtues, must feel his loss, and bemoan their beloved, their entrusted fellow∣citizen! ah! my countrymen, what tender, what excru∣tiating sensations rush at once upon our burdened minds, when we recall his lov'd idea! when we reflect upon the manner of his death; when we fancy that we see his fa∣vage enemies exulting o'er his corps, beautiful even in death; when we remember that, destitute of the rites of sepulture, he was cast into the ground, without the dis∣tinction due to his rank and merit; we cannot restrain the starting tear, we cannot repress the bursting sigh! we mourn thine exit, illustrious shade, with undissembled grief; we venerate thine exalted character; we will erect a mo∣nument to thy memory in each of our grateful breasts, and to the latest ages, will teach our tender infants to lisp the name of WARREN, with veneration and applause!</P>
<P>WHEN we traverse the Canadian wilds, and come to the plains of Abraham, where WOLFE once fell, we are there again compelled to pay a tribute to exalted me∣rit, and to lament the fall of the great MONTGOMERY! warmed with a spirit of patriotism, too little felt by his venal countrymen, he espoused the cause of American free∣dom: he left domestic ease and affluence: he girded on the sword which he had long laid aside, and <HI>jeoparded his life in the high places of the field:</HI> victory followed his standard; she hovered over his head, and crowned it with the laurel wreath: she was just ready to hail him the con∣queror of <HI>Canada,</HI> when the fatal sisters snapped, in a mo∣ment, the thread of life, and seized, from his eager grasp, the untasted conquest! Americans, bear witness to his hu∣manity and his valour, for he died fighting in your cause, and the cause of mankind! let his memory live in your breasts; let it be handed down to your posterity, that millions yet unborn may <HI>rise up and call him blessed!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="018997_0077_0FA912D6CC0D9A10"/>
THE tender feelings of the human heart are deeply af∣fected with the fate of these and the other heroes who have bled and died, that their country may be free: but at the same time, sensations of indignant wrath, are excited in the breast of every friend to freedom: he will listen to the voice of their blood, which cries aloud to heaven, and to him for vengeance! he will feel himself animated with new vigor in the glorious cause: nothing daunted by their untimely fate, he will rush into the midst of danger, that he may share their glory, and avenge their death! every idea which can warm and animate him to glorious deeds, will rush at once upon his mind; and, when engaged in the warmest battle, he will hear them, from their heaven, urging him to action; he will feel their spirits transfused into his breast; he will sacrifice whole hecatombs of their murderers to their illustrious <HI>manes!</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, my countrymen, the people of America have every thing to animate and encourage them in the present contest. Formidable as was once the power of the British lion, he hath now lost his teeth; universal dissipation hath taken place of that simplicity of manners, and hardiness of integrity, for which the nation was once remarkable: the officers of the British army, instead of inuring them∣selves to discipline, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eking for glory in the blood∣stained field, wish alone to captivate the softer sex, and triumph over their virtue. The legislature of Great-Bri∣tain is totally corrupt; her administration is arbitrary and tyrannical; the people have lost their spirit of resentment; and, like the most contemptible of animals, <HI>how the shoulder to bear and become servants unto tribute.</HI> The national resources are cut off; she is loaded with an intolerable public dept; she is become the scorn of those foreigners, to whom she was once terrible; and it is easy to see that her glory is in the wane.</P>
<P>How different from this is the present state of our
<PB N="82" REF="018997_0078_0FA912D7781D4F88"/>country; descended from a race of hardy ancestors, who loved their freedom better than they loved their lives; the Americans are jealous of the least infringement of their rights; strangers to that luxury, which effeminates the mind and body, they are capable of enduring incredible hardships; with eagerness they rush into the field of battle, and brave, with coolness, every danger: they possess a rich and a fruitful country, sufficient to supply them with every necessary and convenience of life; they have inex∣haustible resources for carrying on war, and bid fair soon to be courted for their alliance, by the proudest monarchs of the earth. Their statesmen are equal to the task of for∣ming and defending a free and extensive empire: their generals are brave and humane, intrepid and prudent. When I name a WASHINGTON, my audience will feel the justice of the remark, and acquit me of the charge of flattery.</P>
<P>POSSESSED of these advantages, we should be inex∣cusable to GOD, to our posterity, to the whole world, if we hefitated, a single moment, in asserting our rights and repelling the attacks of lawless power. Freedom is offered to us; she invites us to accept her blessings; driven from the other regions of the globe, she wishes to find an asylum in the wilds of America; with open arms let us receive the persecuted fair; let us imitate the example of our venerable ancestors, who loved and courted her into these desert climes. With determined bravery, let us resist the attacks of her impudent ravishers; by resolution and firmness we may defend her from their power, and transmit her blessings to millions upon millions of our posterity. Let us then arouse to arms; for, upon our exertions, under GOD, de∣pends their freedom; upon our exertions depends the im∣portant question, whether the rising empire of America, shall be an empire of slaves or of freemen.</P>
<P>ANIMATED by these considerations, my friends and fellow-citizens, let us strain every nerve in the service of
<PB N="83" REF="018997_0079_0FA912DAB9771328"/>our country! what are our lives, when viewed in com∣petition with the happiness of such an empire! what is our private interest when opposed to that of three millions of men! let our bosoms glow with the warmth of patriotism; let us sacrifice our ease, our fortunes, and our lives, that we may save our country.</P>
<P>THAT a spirit of public virtue may transcend every private consideration, you, the respected inhabitants of the town of Boston, have plainly manifested: with pleasure you have sacrificed what selfish men hold most dear, to save this oppressed land! with firmness you have resisted every attack of arbitrary power! like the sturdy oak, you have stood unmoved, and to you, under GOD, will be owing the salvation of this extensive continent.</P>
<P>WE feel, my beloved friends, our obligations to you! our hearts confess them; we cordially wish it were in our power to reward you for your patriotism; to restore you to that ease and affluence, of which, for our sakes, you have deprived yourselves; it is not. But our morning and evening petitions to the guardian GOD of America shall be, that he will bless and reward you.</P>
<P>WITH transport, my countrymen, let us look forward to the bright day, which shall hail us a free and indepen∣dent state. With earnestness let us implore the forgive∣ness and the patronage of the Being of all beings, who holds the fate of empires in his hands! with zeal let us exert ourselves in the service of our country, in life: and when the earthly scene shall be closing with us, let us ex∣pire with this prayer upon our quivering lips, O GOD LET AMERICA BE FREE!</P>

<P>LEAVING apologies for my inability to act the part I am to take, in this day's solemnity, to those who might have remedied the evil, by a more suitable appoint∣ment, I shall offer my sentiments upon the subject with the same freedom that I conceived them.</P>
<P>THE advantages of social life, are the result of such evident necessity, so extensively diffusive and universally felt, that all mankind will readily acknowledge their ex∣istence without the aid of metaphysics or history.</P>
<P>THE right that every individual has to reason freely up∣on the nature of that government he is called to submit to, having nature for its source, is no less obvious and per∣ceptable—and hence, as a necessary foundation for the ex∣ercise of this right, I define civil liberty to be, not "a government by laws," made agreeable to charters, bills of rights or compacts, but a power existing in the people at
<PB N="86" REF="018997_0081_0FA912DDEF7BFD98"/>large, at any time, for any cause, or for no cause, but their own sovereign pleasure, to alter or annihilate both the mode and essence of any sormer government, and adopt a new one in its stead.</P>

<P>EVERY military force must necessarily imply a right of exercising an arbitrary power, so far as respects the objects against which it is to be directed; and what will be the objects, against which it will be in constant exercise, in pro∣portion to its extent, we may collect from the experience of ages, and the well-known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce of human actions.</P>
<P>THE page of history seldom groans with the calamities of mankind; but we may trace the source of their unhap∣piness to this engine of oppression.</P>
<P>PROJECTED in the blackest principles of the human mind, and supported by ambition and a lust of unbounded sway, this <HI>armed monster</HI> hath spread havoc and misery throughout the world. We find the bloody traces of its footsteps through all the ruins of greatness and freedom, either in antient or modern times: the most free and op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lent cities of the world, by conniving at its birth, have, at last, fallen a prey to its relentless f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry

<P><PB N="87" REF="018997_0082_0FA912DE4934E348"/>
WHILE we are ravished with the politeness, wisdom, and greatness of the <HI>Grecian</HI> states, we can scarce believe that the productions of such art, refinement, and learning, should ever be subdued by a power that never could have crept into life, but through the channel of <HI>their</HI> indulgence.</P>
<P>BUT alas! their fate remains a standing MONUMENT of this truth, that freedom, at fufference, is a sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cism in politi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>To avoid the pain that humanity must suffer, upon find∣ing so few instances of virtue that have been proof against the temptations to prostitute a delegated power, I am in∣inclined to think, that the great FOUNDER of societies has caused the CURSE of infatuating ambition, and relent∣less cruelty to be entailed on those whose vanity may lead them to assume <HI>his</HI> prerogative among any of his people as they are cantoned about in the world, and to prevent man∣kind from paying that adoration and respect to the most dignified mortal, which is due only to <HI>infinite wisdom and goodness</HI> in the direction of <HI>almighty power,</HI> and therefore that he alone is fit to be a MONARCH.</P>
<P>WERE we to traverse the whole field of human trans∣actions, and expect any where to find an exemption from this general charge, we should most naturally fix our eyes upon the Romans—but how mortified do we find ourselves by the survey?</P>
<P>AT the very time this people were most famed for their virtue and greatness,—while they were regaling themselves with luxurious case in the lap of freedom—the provinces they obtained by fraud and violence, were suffering under every species of the vilest survitude, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o contri∣bute to that very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and lunury at the discretion of the most merciless unfeeling task-masters.</P>

BUT they themselves, by the same tools they had arm∣ed to execute their bloody purposes, in their turn, because the subjects of the same kind of oppression they so liberally dealt out to others, and stand recorded in history equal mo∣numents of the greatness and depravity of human nature.</P>
<P>TAUGHT by the experience of former ages, that a ge∣neral, at the head of an armed force, would ever make him∣self superior to the laws.

<P>STRANGE metamorphosis! but is it not much stranger still, to see these pitiable wretches stript of every enjoyment that can render life a blessing, meanly courting favour and protection from the tyrants who enslaved them, and easily mistaking the <HI>chains of servitude</HI> for the <HI>garb of nature?</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>formalities</HI> of a <HI>free,</HI> and the ends of a <HI>despotic</HI> state (says a modern writer) have often subsisted together. Britain furnishes a most unhappy example of this shocking truth: as if the relish of liberty was pampered to make
<PB N="89" REF="018997_0084_0FA912DFBB966CD0"/>slavery itself more intolerably loathsome, they feel all the mortifying consequences of the basest servitude, and are left to console themselves with this consideration, that the weight of their grievances can never be encreased, while they are <HI>complimented,</HI> or rather <HI>tantalized</HI> with the name of <HI>freemen.</HI> These are some of the glorious effects of stand∣ing armies among <HI>foreign nations.</HI> Let us now consider their consequences in that part of the world, in whose af∣fairs we take a more interesting part.</P>
<P>IT is easy to conceive that those men who would not scruple to make use of every artifice and violence to reduce the very people to whose generosity they were indebted for their splendor, wealth, and greatness, to a state of vassal∣age, would never hesitate to make their conquests as exten∣sive as their power;—they can feel the influence of no <HI>law</HI> but that of the <HI>sword,</HI> and therefore (whatever may be their pretensions) you will, in every case, find them ultimately make an appeal to its decisions.</P>

<P>How can we expect that they who know nothing of the happiness of freedom themselves, should feel any reluctance at reducing all mankind to their own disgraceful situation? indeed the reverse is true, for we generally find them taking an unnatural pleasure, in stripping others of the noblest ornaments and gifts of nature, to countenance their own deformity and wretchedness.</P>

<P>THE eye of pity is yet called to drop a tear at the suf∣ferings, and patriotism to pour the balm of charity over the wounds of half-murdered citizens, draging out a mi∣serable
<PB N="91" REF="018997_0086_0FA912E134F720B8"/>life, and fresh bleeding with the blows aimed at our country.</P>
<P>WE could dwell, with a melancholy pleasure, on this sad catastrophe, did not a more ample field of violence, bloodshed, and cruelty, demand our attention.</P>
<P>THE palpable absurdity of making use of the <HI>name of a king,</HI> to give a sanction to those very operations which were carrying on <HI>against him,</HI> has been so sensibly felt, through all ranks of men, that we have not yet altogether got rid of its disagreeable effects.</P>
<P>AND I must confess I should blush at the ludicrous fi∣gure in which this part of our history must exhibit to view, in future time, were we not countenanced by the same, or more striking inconsistencies which are to be found attendant (and perhaps necessarily so) upon all important revolutions.</P>
<P>WE can easily conceive a mixture of prejudice and fear, that will excite such awful ideas of the person, to whom we have been taught from our cradles, to annex the pro∣perties of <HI>a most gracious sovereign, most sacred majesty,</HI> and a train of such GOD-like attributes, as would make us feel conscious of a degree of <HI>impiety,</HI> in calling a <HI>villain</HI> by his proper name, while shrouded under this garb of <HI>sanctity.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is exeedingly diverting to view the influence of this chimerical divinity in those who are made the imme∣diate tools of supporting it—they will tell you it is a task most ungrateful to men of their sensibility and refinement, to be made the instruments of sending fire and death in∣discriminately among the innocent, the helpless, and the fair—but they have sworn to be faithful to their sovereign, and were they ordered to scale the walls of the new Jerusa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, they should not dare to decline the impious attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="018997_0087_0FA912E43643FBA8"/>
WERE it not for this ridiculous faith in the omnipotence of the tyrant whom they serve, we must suppose them fools or madmen:—Indeed that very faith would justify the charge of extreme madness and folly against all man∣kind, who had not been nurtured in this cradle of infatu∣ation.</P>
<P>WERE it not for the indulgence that a generous mind will always shew to the weakness and prejudices of the worst of men, many whom the chance of war has thrown into our hands, must have felt the severity and contempt of a justly enraged people, while they, with all their vanity and ostentation, remain the <HI>unhurt objects of our pity.</HI></P>
<P>IT is surely rather a subject of merry ridicule, than de∣serving of serious resentment, to see many of this kind of gentry affecting to deny the character of prisoners, and at∣tributing that indulgence which is the effect of unparalleled generosity, to the mean motive of fear; but we will let them know, that they cannot provoke us even to <HI>justice</HI> in the line of <HI>punishment,</HI> and we leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them to their own consciences and the impartial censures of surrounding na∣tions, to make some returns for the unexampled cruelties that many of our friends have suffered from their bar∣barous hands

<PB N="93" REF="018997_0088_0FA912E44E8C4228"/>just, humanity shudders to inflict. But we cannot think it strange to find people in the subordinate departments of life, influenced by such ridiculous notions, while their haughty masters seem to labour under the misfortune of the same infatuation.</P>
<P>SLAVES always rate the consequence of those they serve, by the treatment they receive from them, and wonder that others do not feel the weight of the same importance.</P>
<P>To call men of distinguished rank, in any government, knaves, fools, and scoundrels, however they may deserve it, is esteemed neither polite or decent: I am therefore, at a loss for names while I am describing the oppressors of my country. Who, without deserving these reproachful ap∣pellations, could have conceived the horrid wish of decking his crown, with the idle plume of foreign empire, at the expence of the peace, wealth, and very being of a <HI>nation?</HI> and who but a <HI>pompous blockhead,</HI> in the execution of this impious design, could expect to conquer a hardy, virtuous set of men, by ineffectual threats and empty promises, contained in a set of <HI>proclamations,</HI> he wanted either cou∣rage or power to disperse among the people they were de∣signed to subdue

<P>POSSIBLY they may conceive the length of their master's purse, at the rate of thirty crowns a man, to be equal to all the armed force of Europe, and therefore they should be able ultimately to effect that by the point of the bayonet, which they rather wished, than <HI>expected,</HI> to obtain on any other terms.</P>
<P>HERE let us pause, and for the honour of our species, give a moment to reflection upon this shocking idea! is
<PB N="94" REF="018997_0089_0FA912E50B666560"/>it possible that any of the race of man, should be so lost to a sense of the rights of nature, and the dignity of their rank in the chain of beings, as to suffer themselves (like the horses which they ride) to be tutored to the field of war, to have a price set upon their lives, which their masters will receive, and then be sold into the service of <HI>lust, am∣bition and avarice,</HI> and become the tools of eternal war against the lives, the properties, and freedom of the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>BUT thanks to heaven! this black combination of passions, supported by the unmasked tyrant of Britain, with all the mercenary forces of his powerful and extensive allies, have hitherto proved unsuccessful (and I trust in GOD they ever will) in every effort to contaminate the only column of free air in <HI>both hemispheres;</HI> however, one advantage we derive from their open attempts, which is to expect no security for ourselves, but in their ruin; deliberate mur∣ders, indiscriminate plunder, and the most barbarous vio∣lence upon the delicacy and virtue of the fair, have marked the few paces of <HI>imaginary conquest</HI> they have trod

<P>METHINKS I see the tender parent, frantic with rage, defying hosts of ruffians armed, and courting death in every dismal form, rather than live the witness of his daughter's shame;—ah! hear the shrieks of virgin innocence calling in vain for succour from that arm which oft defended her! but see the helpless victim of their brutish lust, in wild de∣spair, wringing her <HI>guiltless hands,</HI> with looks to heaven, as if, without a crime, she had lost her only title to those pure abodes! where is the <HI>coward heart</HI> that does not beat to arms, and glow with unusual ardour for revenge?</P>

<P>DOES courage want a stimulus in the defence of virtue? let us cast our eyes on the example of our illustrious gene∣ral; equally beyond the reach of calumny and encomium, the tongue of slander has never dared to attack him, while the ablest panegyrist must blush when he is attempting to give him <HI>half</HI> the eulogiums which are his due.</P>
<P>THE generous sacrifice he has made of private interest, domestic felicity, and all the consequent refined enjoyments of social life, to the exigencies of his country in the field of war:—the cheerfulness with which he has sustained all the hardships, anxieties, and disappointments of two im∣portant campaigns, against a formidable body of well-dis∣ciplined veterans, with an army composed of men different in their manners, and unused to the discipline of a camp, without exciting the smallest jealousies in the CIVIL POWER on the one hand, or giving occasion for the faintest mur∣murs among his <HI>soldiers,</HI> on the other.—And finally, when his enemies were at the zenith of their glory, and in ima∣gination, already in possession of a conquered world;— <HI>with the remnant of his expiring army,</HI> to resume the field, and with <HI>this handful</HI> of his chosen followers, disperse, de∣story, or captivate whole hosts of foes, must excite sentiments of affection, gratitude, and esteem, that border upon <HI>adoration.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO weep over the tomb of the patriot—to drop a tear to the memory of those unfortunate citizens, who fell the first sacrifices to tyranny and usurpation, is noble, generous, and humane. Such are the sentiments that in∣fluence you, my countrymen, or why, through successive periods, with heart-felt sensations, have you attended this solemn anniversary, and paid this sad tribute to the me∣mory of your slaughtered brethren. Nor is the circle con∣tracted—the most amiable part of the creation share the grief, and, soft pity beaming in their countenances, like <HI>the daughters of Israel,</HI> annually lament the fate of others,
<PB N="100" REF="018997_0094_0FA9118783AB7400"/>and weep over the miseries of their country
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges <HI>xi. 39, 40.</HI></NOTE>. Come then, my friends, let us enter the solitary courts of death, and, perhaps, an hour spent in such reflection, may afford as so∣lid improvement as nature <HI>in her gayest scenes.</HI></P>
<P>To commemorate the deaths of those men who fell un∣happy victims to brutal violence—to show the dangerous tendency of standing armies in populous cities in time of peace, the origin of this fatal catastrophe—to trace its connexion and effects, as they have been, and are now dis∣played, in different parts of America, I take to be the de∣sign of this day's solemnity.</P>
<P>IT appears to me needless to enter into the nature and ends of civil government, and to evince that standing ar∣mies are a solecism in such a constitution. Such sentiments are founded in nature, and have, for ages, under different forms, and different meridians, been sully display'd by men who knew the rights of nature and mankind. The names of LO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>K, SYDN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Y, and HAM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>DEN, have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng been illustrious, and my country men are too well acquaint∣ed with their writings, not to venerate their memories. Nor can I forget the same sentiments which have charmed you from the lips of men, who have spoke before me, on the same occasion, whose charact <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs will be ever dear, and the exertions of whose patriotism and virtue, exhibited, in the most critical situations, posterity will ever wonder at and revere.</P>
<P>IN short, to confirm this point by logical conclusions, must be an useless mispense of time. Even a crown lawyer, whose sentiments are not always friendly to the rights of mankind, will tell us, "in a land of liberty, it is ex∣tremely dangerous to make a distinct order of the profession of arms. In absolute mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chies this is indeed necessary
<PB N="101" REF="018997_0095_0FA91188419AF708"/>for the <HI>safety of the prince,</HI> and arises from the <HI>main prin∣ciple</HI> of their constitution, which is governing <HI>by fear:</HI> but in free states, the profession of a soldier, taken <HI>singly</HI> and <HI>merely</HI> as a profession, is justly an object of jealousy. The laws, therefore, and constitution of these kingdoms, know no such thing as a <HI>perpetual, standing</HI> soldier

<P>ARGUMENTS existing in theory, however the mind may be captivated, do not always convince; and conse∣quences, traced from the same source, are seldom interest∣ing. But when we find the apprehensions of the greatest and best of mankind, who actuated by a principle of bene∣volence, felt for the common interests, fully displayed in awful and tremendous effects, we then start from our le∣thargy, and like the sensitive plant, shrink from approach∣ing danger! such is the case with respect to the subject be∣fore us. Philosophers and statesmen have shewn how dange∣rous standing armies <HI>must</HI> be in a free state, and every page in the volume of mankind consirms the melancholy ac∣count.</P>
<P>SPECULATIVE writers may indeed tell us, that the seeds of dissolution evist in every body politic—that like the bo∣dy natural, it must decay and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—and that the same causes which brought the empires of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> and <HI>Cyrus</HI> to destructi∣on, will sap every other government on earth
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Bellizarus by M. Marmontell.</NOTE>. For my own part, I am no fatalist, and <HI>nil desp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>randum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> republi∣ca,</HI> is to me a much pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re generous motto. And instead of enumerating their many vices and corrup∣tions, as the <HI>original cause,</HI> I think a little acquaintance with history will insorm us, that they are not merely the original cause, but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> resulting from the satal measure we are considering. In absolure monarchies,
<PB N="102" REF="018997_0096_0FA91189054142B8"/>where the military is the principal engine of government, we are not to look for a confirmation of this argument. But in republics; 'till the introduction of a soldiery, distinct from the citizens, we find them as remote from corruption, luxury, and the other black catalogue of vices as any hu∣man system can attain to: but when standing troops were introduced, they immediately followed. Depravity of manners—a dislike to virtue and manly sentiment—effe∣minacy, and those grosser vices, too indelicate to be men∣tioned in this place, stalk'd like daemons through their ci∣ties. Witness, ye republics, that were once great and illustrious, but are now no more! witness, O Boston! for ye were too well acquainted with the melancholy truth!</P>
<P>WE will now confirm the sentiment by a brief inspecti∣on into some parts of history.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> were a republic, that, in a short flight of years, exhibited the most glorious spectacle that ever ap∣peared to mankind; and, as one observes, the age they lived in, seemed to be the golden period of human nature
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harris Hermes.</NOTE>. In every branch of war or peace, in every species of sci∣ence they excelled, and were at once feared, admired, and venerated by the other nations of the world: yet this he∣roic confederacy was originally reduced from this glorious superiority, by the arts of <HI>one</HI> man
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pisistratus.</NOTE> under the idea of a guard, from an inconsiderable number of attendants, he increased to that stretch of power as proved the fatal stab to the vitals of his country. The bank thus broken down, the tide swelled too rapid to be stemm'd, and virtue, free∣dom and the laws, all fell a sacrifice.</P>
<P>SIMILAR was the situation of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Although not so universally distinguished as the <HI>Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> yet from the expulsion of their kings, to the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> they evin∣ced
<PB N="103" REF="018997_0097_0FA9118A0D5CE600"/>to what a prodigious greatness mankind may arrive when actuated by the principles of liberty, virtue and ho∣nor. Influenced by such motives, no wonder their actions were conformable; and while the most rigid inflexibility presided at home, the Roman eagle flew to the remotest corner of the globe.</P>
<P>CAN we then suppose, when we view the characters which appeared on the stage at this period—when we con∣sider how remote they were from those vices which have been prevalent in powerful monarchies, and how carefully they watch'd the sacred alter of freedom, that they them∣selves must remain a standing monument of the conse∣quences of this fatal measure. Such is the case. Marius, in new modelling the legions, and replacing the citizens who served in them with foreign mercenaries, laid the horrid foundation.—The door was now open for one <HI>too powerful citizen</HI> after another, until <HI>Caesar,</HI> losing every check, and laughing at the impotent anathemas of the senate, with the distant legious march'd to Rome, and formed a new aera in their history. From this period we are charmed no more with illustrious actions, and the last remains of dignity, sunk in the Roman world. So true is it, that when a people lose their liberty, they at once be∣come fit subjects of every thing base and infamous.</P>
<P>WE have thus far produced instances of the fatal effects of armies thus kept up, which have ended in the utter subversion of the laws and government of two of the most memorable republics in antient story. We will now shift the scene, and while we show their dangerous tendency in states of a more modern date, we will exhibit an illustri∣ous example through what scenes of danger, hardships and blood, the determined spirit of honor, and attachment to freedom, will carry a people.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to mentioning the situation <HI>of</HI> the <HI>United
<PB N="104" REF="018997_0098_0FA9118A979B0F70"/>Provintes,</HI> I must remark how very similar their circum∣stances were to our's. We shall ever find it an unalterable maxim of princes, who in time of peace kept up a stand∣ing force, however they may call them the <HI>protectors of law,</HI> the end is <HI>to subvert</HI> those laws and render the constitution useless. Such was the mode of conduct of <HI>Philip the second,</HI> of Spain, to the low countries, and such the procedure of a similar character, <HI>George the third,</HI> of Britain, influen∣ced by as despicable a ministry. The former, as sir Wil∣liam Temple observes, "thinking it not agreeing with his greatness," (an army being now in the bowels of their country) "to consider their discontents, or be limited by their antient forms of government," proceeds to despise the one and overturn the other. New courts judicatory were appointed, new offices established, <HI>depending absolutely on the king.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William Temple's observations on the United Provinces, Page <HI>21, 23.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WHAT was the consequence?—could it be supposed a generous people would sit down tamely, and kiss the rod that lash'd them? a different mode of conduct ensued.— The duke of <HI>Alva</HI> was sent with a powerful army, the very forcible plea of tyrants, and the most shocking cruelties were committed. Here let humanity spread her veil, nor let the tender breast heave with anguish at such scenes. But shocking as they are, they flow as naturally from this cursed engine of oppression, as beams of light from the sun. For as the same sensible writer observes, "So great antipathy ever appears between citizens and soldiers; while one <HI>pretends to be safe</HI> under law, which the other pretends <HI>shall be subject</HI> to his sword and his will."</P>
<P>But terrible as the many executions of their most illus∣trious patriots appeared to them, while the land was dreach∣ed in its richest blood—however affecting the sight of con∣fiscations,
<PB N="105" REF="018997_0099_0FA9118F72028550"/>imprisonments, and the numberless cruelties that attended them, they were not daunted. That GOD who hateth oppression, and delighteth in the happiness of his creation, inspired them with sentiments, that carried them through innumerable hardships, 'till after having expended immense treasures and blood for better than threescore years, they laid the foundation of a rich, free, and flou∣rishing people: Providence hereby giving an instructive lesson to posterity in every age, who are contending for all that is dear and sacred, to pursue the glorious object un∣daunted; knowing that, as liberty is a plant transplanted from the gardens of heavens, its divine parent will still che∣rish it, and, in spite of opposition, it will flourish, it will live forever.</P>
<P>SUCH, my friends, have been the methods used by en∣terprising men, in former ages, to carry into effect their ambitious designs, and found their greatness on the ruins of their country. But in our day, these measures have be∣come systematical. They are in fact part of the constitu∣tion. To take a view of the different powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> and compare them with the state of antient republics, un∣der great and wise legislators, who seem'd to be raised up for the benefit of the age they lived in, and the admiration of posterity, we must drop the tear of sensibility at the con∣trast. Where is the kingdom that does not groan under the calamities of military tyranny? let us pause a while on the most eminent of them.</P>
<P>IN the large empire of <HI>Russia,</HI> the effects are glaring. Even the shadow of liberty has vanished. Of so great im∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtance is the military, that a recruiting officer can go through their villages, and pitch upon the ablest of the inhabitants, as he would chuse his cattle. And eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a fa∣ther has been imprisoned in his own house, for the escape
<PB N="106" REF="018997_0100_0FA911921AA9ED80"/>of a child, while by order of the officer, his own sons have been his goalers
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid Guth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie's Grammar.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PERHAPS there is no nation in any part of the world, more happy than <HI>France,</HI> in every luxury of life. But amid this profusion of plenty, the farmer exhibits the most wretched spectacle in nature. Supported by the gleanings of the field, the fruits of his labor go to the subsistance of the soldiery. Thus dispirited and depressed, he contents himself with the refuge of his ground, while, after his greatest exertions, another will reap the fruits of his ho∣nest industry. The most obdurate breast must melt at such scenes, and execrate the effects of standing armies.</P>
<P>LOOK into the fituation of <HI>Poland.</HI> Under the direction of that great man
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John Subjeski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>, famous for his victories against the <HI>Turks;</HI> they were brave and virtuous, and proved the bulwark of Christendom. But under the <HI>Saxon</HI> line, this spirit not suiting their plan of government, was awed by Electoral troops, and totally decayed. The consequences are now severely experienced by them; and while in this depressed state they are an object of desire to <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Rus∣sians,</HI> their country is a scene of bloodshed and misery.</P>
<P>IT is needless to mention <HI>England,</HI> or the idle farce of an annual act of parliament, for the support of standing troops, which is nothing but an insult on the sense of that nation. The more virtuous among them, if the flame of liberty has not entirely expired, easily see through the guise, and in the death of <HI>Allen</HI> and others, wantonly butchered by a mercenary soldiery, can too clearly read the fate of themselves and posterity.</P>
<P>THE melancholy part of this subject must give pain to every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mane breast. This is natural. But these scenes
<PB N="107" REF="018997_0101_0FA9119439500EE0"/>more directly affect other nations; and however we may pity the unhappy sufferer, there is a kind of pleasure we feel that we ourselves are not immediately interested. And would to GOD, it had ever remained so. O my country! with what heart-felt satisfaction, should I rejoice, if op∣pression had never stretched her baleful wings to this once happy clime! that that liberty which an illustrious set of men, of whom the world was not worthy, purchased at so dear a rate, might have descended unimpaired to latest posterity. But is this the case? has this scourge of mankind, standing armies, never interrupted our prosperity? if so, why is this desk hung with the sable covering of death! why am I surrounded by so many of my fellow-citizens, who listen to the tale of woe! yes, my countrymen, we ourselves are deeply interested; and this same engine of oppression, which has thrown mighty republics from their foundations, has attempted and still continues to spread the same horrid consequences in America: and in its usual mode of conduct, has been attended with every species of cruelty, some of them unheard of before; but which your firmness, under GOD, has hitherto, and I pray ever may, surmount.</P>
<P>THE shocking scene of that dreadful night, the fatal effects of which we are now still weeping over, is beyond description. No one, perhaps, if it is taken in every view, that was not a spectator, can conceive it. When I con∣sider the many insults, abuses and violences, this unhappy town was exposed to for months previous to this melancholy tragedy, and when the tumult of contrary passions was thus naturally excited, to see a brutal soldiery, scattering pro∣miscuous death through a defenceless, unarmed multitude, till yonder street was crimsoned with the blood of its ci∣tizens, while a tender mother, frantic with grief, pours forth the anguish of her heart over a beloved son, now in∣capable of any returns of gratitude; all this exhibits a scene which the distressed heart may painfully feel, but
<PB N="108" REF="018997_0102_0FA91194595E4340"/>which the tongue cannot express. Let the breast, then, still continue to beat. These, my friends, are virtuous, gene∣rous feelings, and do honor to humanity. May we ever re∣tain them. May this institution, sacred to the memory of our murdered brethren, be ever carefully preserved. Yes, ye injured shades! we will still weep over you, and if any thing can be more soothing, WE WILL REVENGE YOU.</P>
<P>THIS glaring specimen of cruelty roused the citizens, and in convincing colors displayed the effects of standing armies in time of peace. But however our exertions were then successful, however the storm subsided, it was but temporary. While the scales of justice were held in palsied hands, and the most shocking barbarities were the highest merit, an additional force only was necessary. That ar∣riving, the mask was thrown off, and a still greater scene of carnage and destruction, opened in our adjacent villages.</P>
<P>BUT such proceedings, however alarming at that pe∣riod, were soon lost in more dreadful and distressing ope∣rations. The heights of Charlestown too awfully con∣vinced us of the melancholy truth, and posterity, while with tears of compassion, they ponder the transactions of that day, must execrate the causes which produced them. In any situation, the relics of slaughtered citizens are objects of pity, and the sympathizing spectator will ever drop a tear over them. But there may be instances, when the lesser streams of affection are abforbed in a still greater sea of woe. Such are the sentiments that must strike every breast, when we reflect, illustrious WARREN! on thy death—a death, which whole hecatombs of slaughtered enemies, strowed around thy corpse, can never repay. Here, ye minions of power! ye who are dead to the calls of honor and public virtue, are willing to wade to station, through the blood of your brethren, here behold a spectacle that must harrow your inmost soul. You, my countrymen, with the most pleasing sensations, have attentively listened, while, like us,
<PB N="109" REF="018997_0103_0FA9119503D1B4F8"/>he was weeping over the unhappy fate of others. You have kindled into rage, while he has set before you the dangerous nature and consequences of standing armies, and prophetically pointed out to you still greater events. How affecting! that he who could lament the fate of others, must be himself deplored; and that he who could so feel∣ingly paint the effects of this horrid measure, must himself fall one of the first sacrifices to it.</P>
<P>BUT it is not sufficient to drop a transient tear to the me∣mory of departed heroes, or to pay an eulogy to their cha∣racters. The happiness of such men, who, after having expired in the arms of liberty and virtue, are now sharing the highest degree of felicity, cannot be increased by our praises: no, my friends, the best way to express our affec∣tion for such great and good men, is to rouse and revenge them. To hurl still fiercer bolts of vengeance on an in∣human soldiery, who, instead of affording the last honors, sacred to the dead, and which a generous enemy will ever regard.—after grinning with heilish pleasure on the mangled corpse, which alive could strike terror into their bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dest heart, lodged it in a promiscuous grave; that since they could not prevent his name and reputation being im∣mortal, his remains might be hid forever.—O Britain! thou hast, and shall still weep tears of blood for this!</P>
<P>ARE not such instances, my countrymen, very convin∣cing proofs of the fatal effects of standing armies, in time of peace. In such a period they originated, and from the fifth of March 1770, through every degree of violence and barbarity, to the present day, it is but one connected scene.</P>
<P>AFTER such exhibitions of cruelty and carnage, what can we suppose too brutal, too infamous for such an army? can we wonder to see our houses in flames? our altars rased to the ground, or converted to a much more horrid use,
<PB N="110" REF="018997_0104_0FA91195CD925998"/>than the Jewish temple? if possible they have even ex∣ceeded; and the armies of Britain seem to be held up as a standing evidence, how far the spirit of tyranny and op∣pression can operate.</P>
<P>WE shudder when the faithful page of history opens to our view the conduct of armies, flushed with victory, sack∣ing towns, burning villages, and perpetrating murders, with all the other dreadful concomitants. But if we look into the conduct of the British army in the <HI>Jersies,</HI> and some part of the state of <HI>New-York,</HI> we shall find instances of all these crimes, and, perhaps, in some places, instances beyond them. To see the third city in a neighbouring state, wantonly consumed by an enemy, who not having spirit or ability, to meet us in the field, descend to these little mean methods of exciting terror—to see the ravages in the <HI>Jersies,</HI> and the garden of America thus wantonly defaced—does not the blood beat high!—do we not press forward to exterminate such barbarians from the face of the earth! but to mention still greater scenes of cruelty—does not the ear tingle when it hears the shrieks of helpless vir∣gins, dreadful victims to lust and barbarity; while the grey hairs and expressive groans of an aged parent, witness to his daughter's shame, plead in vain. Can any thing swell this complicated scene of woe? it <HI>can</HI> receive addition. These monsters exceed even the most barbarous nations. With them the ashes of the dead have ever been sacred. But under the patronage of a British tyrant and his general, snussing the tainted gale, they have ransacked the silent repositories, and the remains of one that was once amiable and captivating, flung about as food for the birds of the air
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Delauncy's farm.</NOTE>. O GOD, where is thy vengeance! O virtue, honor, religion, humanity, where, where are ye fled!</P>
<P>THESE, my countrymen, are not the flights of fancy, not the dictates of imagination: they are solid, though
<PB N="111" REF="018997_0105_0FA9119687FC4BD8"/>very affecting realities. Can we then wish a re-union with such a people? can we ever familiarly shake hands with a nation, who, leaping every barrier, are thus wantonly sporting with our distresses, and bathing themselves in the blood of our countrymen? may America never retain such mean, dastardly sentiments! for my own part, if I may be in∣dulged, I would entreat, I would conjure every one, who as a parent feels for the welfare of his posterity, to imitate the ex∣ample of the renowned Carthagenian
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>As Hannibal, then about nine years old, was soothing with childish caresses his father Hamilear, to take him along with him to Spain, whither, after finishing the war in Africa, he was now about to transport his troops, and was sacrificing for success in that expedition, he was led by his father to the altar, and with his hand on the victim, was bound by this solemn oath, "that as soon as he should have it in his power he would declare himself an enemy to the Roman people."</P>
<BIBL><HI>Livey, b. 21, ch. 1.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Lead your sons, ye fathers, not to the altar of Paganism, and under the tutelage of some unknown deity, but to the sacred altar of freedom; and while the guardian GOD of America is wit∣ness to the solemn obligation, MAKE THEM SWEAR that they never will be friends to a power, who are thus sa∣crificing their dearest privileges. Ring in their young ears the dreadful tale of murders, rapes, and massacres. Paint to them the conduct of Britain, as displayed in her arms in different parts of America, till their young breasts glow with ardor, and thus early catching the flame of patriotism, they may, through life, pursue un∣daunted so glorious an object. Pleased with such an in∣vocation, the shades of our fathers will rejoice over their posterity, and the angels of love and purity will look down delighted.</P>
<P>No one, I think, can suppose these thoughts proceed from rage or passion. They are the cool dictates of my heart. I love my country; her distresses affect me; nor, from this moment, do I ever wish a reconciliation with a
<PB N="112" REF="018997_0106_0FA9119745611EF8"/>power, whose prosperity must be founded on my utter destruction.</P>
<P>I HAVE now, my countrymen, endeavored to exhibit the fatal effects of standing armies in time of peace; not from abstract reasoning, but as they exist in fact, and now prevail in our distressed land. Here I would remark, that it is standing armies in <HI>time of peace,</HI> and the <HI>consequences</HI> thence resulting, that we are now deprecating. Armies, in defence of our country, unjustly invaded, are necessary, and in the highest sense justifiable. We, my friends, attacked by an arbitrary tyrant, under the sanction of a force, the effects of which, we have attempted to illustrate, have been obliged to make the last solemn appeal. And I cannot but feel a pleasing kind of transport, when I see America, undaunted by the many trying scenes that have attended her, still baffling the efforts of the most formidable power in Europe, and exhibiting an instance, unknown in history. To see an army of veterans, who had fought and conquer∣ed in different quarters of the globe—headed by a ge∣neral tutored in the field of war, illustrious by former victories, and flushed with repeated successes, threatning, with all the pomp of expression, to spread havock, desolati∣on, and ruin around him; to see such a soldiery and such a general, yielding to an hardy race of men, new to the field of war; while on the one hand it exalts the character of the latter, convincingly proves the folly of those, who, under pretence of having a body of troops, bred to war, and ever ready for action, adopt this dangerous system, in subversion of every principle of lawful government. Here, if after having depictured scenes of so distressing a nature, it may not appear too descending, I could not forbear smiling at the British general and his troops, who not willing to reflect on their present humiliating condition, affect the air of arrogant superiority. But Americans have learnt them, that men, fighting on the principles of free∣dom and honor, despise the examples that have been set
<PB N="113" REF="018997_0107_0FA9119868F3F2A0"/>them by an enemy; and though, in the field, they can brave every danger in defence of those principles, to a vanquished enemy they know how to be generous; but that this is a generosity not weak and unmeaning, but founded on just sentiments, and if wantonly presumed upon, will never interfere with that national justice, which ever ought, and lately has been properly exerted.</P>
<P>BUT while, with the warmest gratitude to heaven, we view our late successes, and are at a loss to express our ac∣knowledgment to the illustrious hero, who was the in∣stument, and whose name, to remotest ages, will be ever dear to these New-England states, let us not forget our situation. There is an army, and a very powerful one, still existing in the heart of America. Methinks the reputation of past successes should animate every inhabitant of Ame∣rica to fly to arms; and by one general exertion utterly expel this last, this only remaining power of Great-Britain on the continent. Ye, to whom the sacred, the important system of government is committed—ye men of sense and virtue—ye patriots, who feel an affection for your country and posterity, let me conjure you to seize the present op∣portunity, happier than we could ever have expected, and which once omitted may never be again in our power.</P>
<P>I WOULD not pretend to insinuate, that this is the <HI>only</HI> point which ought to be under <HI>immediate</HI> consideration, by a wise people or their <HI>delegates.</HI> But this I will venture to affirm, that unless this is the <HI>governing sentiment,</HI> in every deliberation, every other thing is superfluous. Let us then rise superior to every private local attachment. As we are embarked on one broad bottom of universal freedom, let us attend to this most pressing occasion; an occasion pro∣videntially offered for future security and happiness. If a royal army, tho' weak in its number, can thus insult us unpunished, the most slender imagination can easily foresee what must be the effects of a still greater force. I wish that
<PB N="114" REF="018997_0108_0FA9119DA57D3E88"/>the present generation, I wish that posterity may not feel∣ingly reproach our inactivity.</P>
<P>SHALL the frequent calls of our EXALTED GENERAL, who seems to have been raised up by heaven, to show to what an height humanity may soar; who generously sa∣crificing affluence and domestic ease, wishes to share with you in every danger and distress, shall his frequent calls be in vain? remember, my countrymen, the eyes of the good and great, in every clime, are upon the present contest. Liberty, disgusted at scenes of cruelty and oppression, has left her ancient altars, and is now hovering to fix her last residence in America. Our exertions have hitherto been great and successful. Let not the ashes of WARREN, MONTGOMERY, and the illustrious roll of heroes, who died for freedom, reproach our inactivity and want of spirit, in not <HI>compleating</HI> this grand superstructure; the pillars of which have been cemented with the richest blood of America. May that same ardor, which has rendered America famous, still continue, and looking forward to those happy days of liberty and peace, which our posterity shall enjoy, let us exalt at the thought, that future generations, while they reap the glorious fruits of our struggles, will rise up and call us blessed.</P>

<P>"THAT man was born to delude and be deluded; to believe whatever is taught, and bear whatso∣ever is imposed;" are political dogmas which have long afforded matter for exultation and security to dignified villains, from the sceptered tyrant, to the meanest minion of power. But however confirmed they may have been, by the passive conduct of the greatest part of mankind, you, my fellow-citizens, thank GOD, you are an exception to their truth. The numerous, the respecta∣ble assembly which now croud this hallowed temple, are an exalted exception to maxims as disgraceful as they are general. Ever vigilantly attentive to the sacred, unalien∣able rights of man; equally studious in the glorious prin∣ciples of liberty as intrepidly determined to preserve in∣violate
<PB N="116" REF="018997_0110_0FA911A29E50B248"/>the inestimable previleges she bestows; you are now convened, not merely to commemorate this anniver∣versary, but solemnly to renew the resolves, which free∣dom, wisdom, virtue, honor inspire: and not barely to resolve, but I trust, steadily to pursue the execution of re∣solutions which have resulted from deliberate investigation and full conviction.</P>
<P>To so intelligent, so well informed an auditory, it must be unnecessary to deduce the origin of civil society, which founded in reciprocal advantage, and springing from so∣cial virtue, on the combined necessities and assistance of individuals built the general happiness—a happiness thus instituted, nothing but public spirit, and a union of force and of council can preserve: I must therefore request your indulgence whilst I rather point out those evils which the concurrent experience of ages and nations prove to be sub∣versive of every good proposed from civil compact. Little solicitous of rhetorical applause, I shall offer you my senti∣ments as they arise warm from a heart devoted to the inte∣rests of this my parent country, in language that becomes a freeman to use when addressing a free assembly.</P>
<P>SIMILAR causes will forever operate like effects in the political, moral, and physical world: those vices which ru∣ined the illustrious republics of Greece, and the mighty commonwealth of Rome, and which are now ruining Great-Britain, so late the first kingdom of Europe, must eventu∣ally overturn every State, where their deleterious influence is suffered to prevail. Need I add that luxury, corruption, and standing armies are those destructive efficients?</P>
<P>LUXURY, no sooner finds admittance into a state than she becomes the parent of innumerable evils, public and domestic; her contagious influence is soon felt in society, and her baneful effects discovered by a general dissipation of manners and a declension of private virtue, which be∣gets
<PB N="117" REF="018997_0111_0FA911A34DBB6D38"/>effeminate habits, and by a natural gradation a base pliability of spirit.</P>
<P>LUXURY is ever the foe of independence, for at the same time that it creates artificial wants it precludes the means of satisfying them. It first makes men necessitous, and then dependant. It first unfits men for patriotic ener∣gies, and soon teaches them to consider <HI>public virtue as a public jest.</HI></P>
<P>AT such a period, corruption finds an easy access to mens' hearts. To the promotion of interested pursuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wishes, a ready sacri∣fice is made of the general good at the shrine of power. Then slumbers that virtuous jealousy of public men and public measures, which was wont to scrutinize not only actions but motives: then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the constitution. Every day new inroads are made upon pub∣lic liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of resistance decreases. Thus before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, she must be fitted for slavery by her vices.</P>
<P>GENERALLY, but not always, for we have known a people ruled by a despot, who, from a private station, rose to uncontroled dominion, at a time when they were sternly virtuous. And this mode of introducing bondage is ever to be apprehended at the close of a successful struggle for liberty, when a triumphant army, elated with victories, and headed by a popular General, may become more for∣midable than the tyrant that has been expelled. Witness the last century in the English history! witness the as∣piring CROMWELL!</P>
<P>THIS audacious citizen, intrusted by his country with
<PB N="118" REF="018997_0112_0FA911A4066CE9A8"/>the command of her armies, to chastize the man whom pre∣vious folly
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If a man in private life, finds his oldest son an ideot or a rascal, he may dispose of his estate among his other children: but if the heir apparent (in hereditary monarchies) to a crown, an in∣heritance in which millions are interested, turns out to be a block∣head or a villain, still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must be the king, because such is the line of succession established by law.—Hence the few prince; who have not been either the scourge or disgrace of the kingdoms they have ruled.</NOTE> had enthroned, and who soon presumed to treat his subject, as all kings are wont to do, with contempt and inju∣ry, had no sooner dispatched the foolish, imperious monarch, than he attempted to succeed him: with a little manage∣ment, he soon found his army as disposed to <HI>regisy</HI> him, as they had been to depose Charles. With these mercenary associates at his heels, he appeared in the synod of the State, and dared with force displace the most glorious band of patriots that ever led a tyrant from his throne to a scaffold. Not content with this enormous outrage upon the constitution, this annihilating stroke upon the tottering liberties of his country, for a time, to keep up the form of a popular government and to bring parliament into contempt, he convened an house of commons, constituted entirely of his own creatures. They met, and in a few months discovered that they were utterly unequal to the posts they were raised to, they therefore petitioned their master to dissolve them. Cromwell granted their re∣quest, and became sole tyrant of three kingdoms. Tyrant —for of what consequence is it by what style or under what modification despotism operates to the public wrong— dictator, king, protector, it is not the appellation we re∣probate, though even that we should guard against, but the thing. Who but must own that Cromwell, under the name of protector, was as absolute a despot as he could have been with any other title?</P>
<P>THE first Caesar affords us another instance among the
<PB N="119" REF="018997_0113_0FA911A4C51FEB90"/>thousands which history holds up to our view, to teach us what bold and unprincipled spirits have effected by the aid of armies. This ambitious subject having been for several years engaged in the <HI>humane,</HI> the <HI>soldierly</HI> employment of slaughtering his fellow men, and in extending his conquests over countries which he had not even a pretence to invade; this Caesar, who boasted that he had slain a million of men
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Plutarch says that Casur could boast, that he had slain a million of men, gave a million their liberty, and made a million prisoners.</P>
<BIBL>Vid. Plut. in vit. Caes.</BIBL></NOTE>, was at length ordered home by the senate to answer to some charges against his conduct. He knew that at such an interview his sword would be his ablest advocate. He therefore led his veteran legions, <HI>"nothing loth,"</HI> against his country; passed the rubicon; fought his way to Rome; plunged a dagger in her vitals; impiously trampled on her dearest rights; and seized on empire crimsoned, exe∣crable paricide! crimsoned with the richest blood of Rome's best citizens!</P>
<P>Too late the patriot poniard reach'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itor's heart: Caesar fell—alas! the republic had fallen before. Rome changed her governors, but the tyranny remained. The same army that had enabled Julius to triumph over the liberties of his country, led the cars of OCTAVIUS, AN∣THONY and LEPIDUS, through se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Roman blood, and bad the cursed triumvirate divide an enslaved world!</P>
<P>IF Rome could have been saved, BRUTUS and his vir∣tuous associates would have saved her; but a standing ar∣my, and a perpetual dictator, were, and ever will, prove too hard for the patriotic few. Learn hence, my country∣men, that a state may sink so low in slavery that even vir∣tue itself cannot retrieve her. From these examples, pru∣dence dictates—<HI>resist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eginnings.</HI> A free and wise people will never suffer any citizen to become too popular—much

<P>BUT why do I keep your attention fixed on remote trans∣actions? our own times furnish additional and convincing proofs of the destructive consequences of political cor∣ruption and mercenary armies.</P>
<P>SWEDEN, the bravest, hardiest, freest nation of the north—Sweden, in one hour, was plunged from the dis∣tinguished heights of liberty into abject vassalage. What ties can bind a king? scarce had GUSTAVUS the third as∣cended the throne of limited monarchy; scarce had the roofs of the senate house ceased to reverberate the insidious ac∣cents of his inauguration speech

<P>The king of Sweden's speech to the States on the <HI>1st</HI> of June, <HI>1772.</HI></P>
<P>You are this day assembled, in order to confirm in the manner of your ancestors, the band of union which ties you to me, and me to you, and both to the whole commonwealth; we must therefore remember, with the most sensible gratitude, the benevolence of the Almighty, who has ordered things so, that this very ancient kingdom of the Swedes and Goths is still existing, after so many foreign, as well as national shocks, and that I, in the throne of my ancestors, can yet address free and independent States.</P>
<P>Assured of your hearts, most sincerely proposing to merit them, and to six my throne upon your love and felicity, the public engagement which you are going to enter into, would, in my opinion, be needless, if ancient custom and the law of Sweden did not require it of you. Unhappy the king who wants the tie of oaths to secure himself on the throne, and who, not assured of the hearts of his subjects, is con∣strained to reign only by the force of laws, when he cannot by the love of his subjects!</P>
<P>I need not put you in mind of the weightiness of the engagement you are going to take; the States of Sweden know best the extent of their duty to themselves and the commonwealth; may concord and harmony ever unite your hearts; may foreign views and private gain ever be sacrificed to public interest; may this alone be a per∣petual bond of union amongst you; and may the ambition of any part of you, never raise any such disturbances as may endanger the free∣dom and independency of the whole commonwealth!</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the house of nobles,</P>
<P>Preserve always the honor and intrepidity of your ancestors; be an example to your fellow-citizens; and, as you are the first order of the kingdom, be also the first in virtue and love of your country.</P>
<P>Good men of the reverend order of clergy,</P>
<P>May mutual friendship and peace, obedience to the laws, re∣verence to God and the king, bear witness to me and the country, of your zeal in the execution of the sacred office with which you are intrusted!</P>
<P>Good men of the respectable order of burghers,</P>
<P>Strive always with your fellow-subjects who shall contribute the most to the public good; may the fruits of the extensive share which belongs to you, be general credit and confidence, useful institutions, frugal living, and moderate gain, which lead to sure and certain wealth.</P>
<P>Good men of the worthy order of peasants,</P>
<P>May piety, diligence, temperance, and old Swedish faith and mo∣desty, be the strongest confirmation of the honor always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue to that order which gives subsistance to all the others; an honor which the Swedish peasants have at all times attained.</P>
<P>This is all I ask of you, when you observe this, you perform in the best manner, that duty to me, and your country, which, according to the Swedish laws, I now call upon you to confirm by oath.</P>

Gustavus, knowing that the army were ready to assist his iniquitous designs (as all standing armies are to promote despotism, because under such a system of rule, soldiers must be ne∣cessary and consequently favored) the barriers raised by justice and his plighted faith to Sweden, became slight indeed. Force backed inclination, and Gustavus changed circumscribed authority, for unconfined sovereignty

<P>LET us now turn our eyes to that nation whom we once did love, and with whom we had yet been friends had not an unparalleled series of folly and cruelty compelled us to renounce the pleasing relationship. A short retrospect of whose public conduct, subsequent to the last war, will afford many and important instructions.</P>
<P>IN 1763 peace was restored after a war of seven years, successfully waged in every quarter of the globe. At that period what an unrivalled figure did Great-Britain stand amongst the nations! great beyond all former example, in arms, in commerce and in wealth. Not a corner of the earth but had witnessed her atchievements. Wheresoever she directed her armies, victory and conquest attended; whilst her irresistable navy, thundering over every ocean, not only subdued, but annihilated the fleets of her ene∣mies.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="018997_0117_0FA911A7D2A2DBD8"/>
TRIUMPHANT in war, nor less distinguished in peace. In many of the polite, in most of the useful arts and sciences, superior to her neighbours. In commerce unequalled; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sea but bore, not a wind but wasted her countless ships, laden with the riches of the earth, and made her crouded ports the marts of the world. Late glorious nation, how are thou fallen, how lost! from so envied, so stupendous an height, by the perverted will of thy infatuated monarch, and the pernicious counsels of his nefarious ministers. Driven to the fearful edge of ruin, we now behold thee tottering o'er the gulph of annihilation, whilst France and her allies urge thee over the irremeable steep!</P>
<P>WHEN we consider the capital desects in the English constitution—the character of her present weak and ambi∣tious monarch—the luxury, dissipation and venality of her influential men, we shall cease to wonder at her declension and present circumstances.</P>
<P>IN a limited monarchy, where the prince as supreme ex∣ecutive magistrate, and first branch of the legislature, is invested with the important prerogative of making peace and war; is constituted the sole fountain of honor, and be∣comes the exclusive disposer of every lucrative and ho∣norable appointment, civil, ecclesiastic, and military; his influence becomes too enormous to be compatible with the public liberty: but if to such extravagant powers (by a fatal error in the constitution, placed in the hands of the prince) he should superadd a detestable system of corruption to bribe the representatives of the people (a system which, during the reign of his present Britannic majesty, hath been urged to its utmost possible extent) the worst species of vassalage must ensue. That equipoise between the re∣spective branches of the legislature (in which the seeming, the theoretic excellence of the English constitution consists) will be totally destroyed; the executive will involve the powers of the legislative, and whilst the letter and for∣malities
<PB N="124" REF="018997_0118_0FA911AD26B5CE28"/>of the constitution are retained, its spirit and in∣tendment will be totally lost. An <HI>absolutely arbitrary,</HI> with the forms of a <HI>free</HI> government (that worst and surest of all tyrannies) will gradually succeed and be finally established, unless a total revolution is happily effected by the timely exertions of the people, before the despot has strengthened himself with a mercenary army, and forever closed their chains.</P>
<P>BUT this tyranny is already established in Great-Britain, for what hopes can Britons entertain of effecting a revo∣lution, whilst the crown, by the multiplicity of gifts in its power, can maintain an infamous majority in each house of parliament, to legalize, and a standing army to enforce its projects, however imperious, inhuman or unjust. In vain, a few wise and virtuous men see and lament their dishonorable situation—an army of forty thousand soldiers, in time of peace, and a still more numerous band of place∣men and pensioners, properly disposed throughout the kingdom, effectually stifle in their birth every effort of patriotism to restore the constitution to its primaeval prin∣ciples.</P>
<P>SUCH is the boasted constitution, such the prince, and such the present condition of the people of Britain. Un∣happy nation, thus constitutionally enslaved—thus legally und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e! unworthy descendants of illustrious ancestors— thus to suffer your most essential rights to be bartered away, your government not only corrupted, but perverted to pur∣poses diametrically opposite to its original intention. An house of commons at first constituted to watch over and preserve your rights and immunities from the enchroaching steps of ambitious princes, you have permitted to become an engine in the hands of royalty, the more effectually to abridge or nullify those rights. A parliament constituted the stewards of your property, who, instead of guarding it from the insatiable grasp of royal avidity, you patiently see lavishingly indulging the utmost extravagance of regal
<PB N="125" REF="018997_0119_0FA911B0169C3540"/>profusion; granting enormous sums for effecting the most pernicious purposes; traitorously leaguing with the servants of the crown in loading you with intolerable taxes, and, sharers in the spoil, prodigally complying with the most unbounded demands of ministerial rapacity, while they, at the same time, treacherously unite to screen the most in∣famous defaulters of the public money. Instead of bravely drawing your swords in defence of your freedom and na∣tional honor, you first tamely acquiesced in an insidious and ignominious

<P>DEGENERATE sons of mighty fathers! how poor is the consolation for the loss of essential rights, that you still retain the empty privilege of pasquinading your king and his ministers, whilst you are destitute of that public spirit and solid virtue which should purge your corrupted govern∣ment and reform your wretched constitution!</P>
<P>FROM subjection to a government, thus defective and corrupt, and thus vilely administered, what freeman would not struggle for an emancipation? but if there is an American present who can yet secretly wish for a reunion with this nation, and a share in her ideal privileges, let
<PB N="126" REF="018997_0120_0FA911B21E5AB8B0"/>him for a moment consider the innumerable indignities, which, for fifteen years back, have been offered us by this haughty power, added to the savage barbarities which they have exercised in every part of America where their army have made any progress, and he must blush at the spiritless, the ignoble sentiment.</P>
<P>IN 1764 the plan for raising a revenue from this coun∣try was resolved on by the British ministry, and THEIR ob∣sequious parliament were instructed to pass an act for that purpose. Not content with having for a century directed the entire commerce of America, and centered its profits in their own island; thereby deriving from the colonies every substantial advantage which the situation and transmarine distance of the country could afford them: not content with appointing the principal officers in the different go∣vernments, while the king had a negative upon every law that was enacted: not content with our supporting the whole charge of our municipal establishments, although their own creatures held the chief posts therein: not con∣tent with laying external duties upon our mutilated and shackled commerce, they, by this statute, attempted to rob us of even the curtailed property, the hard-earned peculium which still remained to us—to create a revenue for the sup∣port of a fleet and army, in reality to overawe and secure our subjection, not (as they insidiously pretended) to pro∣tect our trade, or defend our frontiers; the first of which they annoyed, and the latter deserted.</P>
<P>AFTER repealing this imperious edict, <HI>not</HI> because it was unjust in principle, <HI>but</HI> inexpedient in exercise, they proceeded to declare, by a public act of the whole legisla∣ture, that we had no property but what was at their dispo∣sal, and that Americans, in future, were to hold their privi∣leges and lives solely on the tenure of the good will and pleasure of a British parliament. Acts soon followed cor∣respondent to this righteous determination, which, not
<PB N="127" REF="018997_0121_0FA911B2454B9F10"/>quadrating with American ideas of right, justice and rea∣son, a fleet and army were sent to give them that force, which laws receive when promulgated from the mouths of cannon, or at the points of bayonets.</P>
<P>WE then first saw our harbour crowded with hostile ships, our streets with soldiers—soldiers accustomed to consider military prowess as the standard of excellence, and vain of the splended pomp attendant on regular armies, they contemptuously looked down on our peaceful orders of citizens. Conceiving themselves more powerful, they as∣sumed a superiority which they did not feel; and whom they could not but envy, they effected to despise. Perhaps, knowing they were sent, and believing they were able to subdue us, they thought it was not longer necessary to ob∣serve any measures with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aves—hence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that arrogance in the carriage of the officers—hence that licentiousness and brutality in the common soldiers, which at length broke out with insufferable violence, and proceeding to personal insults and outragious assa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts on the inhabitants, soon rou∣sed them to resentment, and produced the catastrophe which we now commemorate.

MAN is formed with a constitution wonderfully adapted for social converse and connection. Scarcely ushered into the world, but his wants teach him his inability, of him∣self, to provide for them. Wrapt in astonishment, with an anxiety inexpressible, the solitary existant looks around for the aid of some friendly neighbour, and should he per∣chance meet the desired object; should he find one, endow∣ed with intellectual faculties, beset with the same wants and weaknesses, and in all respects the very image of him∣self; should he find him with a heart open to mutual kind offices, and a hand stretched out to bestow a proportion of his labor, with a bosom glowing with gratitude, his soul is on the wing to express the sense he entertains of the generous obligation.</P>
<P>A CONFIDENCE is established between him and his benefactor, they fwear perpetual friendship, and a com∣pact for mutual protection and assistance becomes imper∣ceptably consented to. Thus doubly armed, together they pursue their morning route to satisfy those demands only which nature reminds them of, and while the ingenuity of the one is exercised to ensnare, the strength of the other is, perhaps, employed to subdue their vigorous opponent.</P>
<P>THEIR little family soon encreases, and as their social ring becomes gradually enlarged, their obligations to each other are equally circular. Honest industry early teaches them that a part only is sufficient to provide for the whole, and that a portion of their time may be spared to cull the conveniences as well as appease the wants of nature. Property and personal security appear to be among the first objects of their attention, and acknowledged merit receives the unanimous suffrage to preside guardian over the rights and privileges of their infant society. The advantages derived are in a moment experienced. Their little policy, erected upon the broad basis of equality, they know of no superiority but that which virtue and the love of the whole
<PB N="131" REF="018997_0125_0FA911B548081B48"/>demands; and while, with chearfulness, they entrust to his care a certain part of their natural rights, to secure the remainder, the agreement is mutual, and the obligation upon his part equally solemn and binding to resign them back, either at the instance and request of their sovereign pleasure, or whensoever the end should be perverted for which he received them.</P>
<P>INTEGRITY of heart, benevolence of disposition, the love of freedom and public spirit, are conspicuous excellencies in this select neighbourhood. Lawless ambition is without a friend, and the insinuating professional pleas of tyrants, ever accompanied by the magnificence and splendor of luxury
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A mode of living above a man's annual income, weakens the state, by reducing to poverty not only the squanderers themselves, but many innocent and industrious persons connected with them.

PATRIOTISM is essential to the preservation and well-being of every free government. To love one's country
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>The amor patriae or patriotism stands at the head of social af∣fections, and so high in our esteem, that no actions but what proceed from it, are termined grand or heroic. It triumphs over every selfish motive, is a firm support to every virtue, and wherever it prevails the morals of the people are found to be pure and correct.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Elements of Criticism.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> has ever been esteemed honorable; and under the influence of this noble passion, every social virtue is cultivated, free∣dom prevails through the whole, and the public good is the object of every one's concern. A constitution built up∣on such principles, and put in execution by men possessed with the love of virtue and their fellow-men, must always ensure happiness to its members. The industry of the citi∣zen will receive encouragement and magnanimity; hero∣ism and benevolence will be esteemed the admired qualifi∣cations of the age. Every the least invasion on the public liberty, is considered as an infringement on that of the subject; and feeling himself roused at the appearance of oppression, with a divine enthusiasm he flies to obey the summons of his country, and does she but request, with zeal he resigns the life of the individual for the perservation of the whole.</P>
<P>WITHOUT some portion of this generous principle, anar∣chy and confusion would immediately ensue, the jarring in∣terests of individuals, regarding themselves only, and indif∣ferent to the welfare of others, would still further heighten the distressing scene, and with the assistance of the selfish passions, it would end in the ruin and subversion of the state. But where patriotism is the leading principle, una∣nimity is conspicuous in public and private councils. The constitution receives for its stability the united efforts of every individual, and revered for its justice, admired for its principle, and formidable for its strength, its fame reaches to the skies.</P>

Check not such generous feelings. They are the fruits of virtue and humanity, and while the obligations you remain under to those unhappy men, lead you to shed the sympathetic tear, to dwell with pleasure upon their memories, and execrate the causes of their death, remember that you can never repay them. Ever bear it in your minds, that so implicit was the confidence you willingly placed in that country, that owed to you her affection, that notwithstanding the introduction of that in∣human weapon of tyrants into the very heart of your peace∣ful villages, you still would fain rely on their deceitful assertions, and paint the deformed monster to your ima∣ginations as the minister of peace and protection. Men born in the bosom of liberty, living in the exercise of the social affections in their full vigor, having once fixed them upon particular objects, they are not hastily eradicated. Unaccustomed to sport with, and wantonly sacrifice these sensible overflowings of the heart, to run the career of pas∣sion and blinded lust, to be familiar with vice, and sneer at virtue; to surprise innocence by deceitful cunning, and assume the shade of friendship to conceal the greater en∣mity, you could not at once realize the fixed, the deli∣berate intention of those from whom you expected freedom, to load you with slavery and chains, and not till insult re∣peated upon insult: not till oppression stalked at noon-day through every avenue in your cities: nay, not till the blood of your peaceful brethren flowed through your streets, was the invenvomed serpent to be discovered in the bushes: not
<PB N="136" REF="018997_0130_0FA911C149097230"/>till a general trespass had been made upon the keenest feelings of human nature, and the widowed mother was summoned to entomb the cold remains of her affectionate son; the virtuous bosom to resign its tender partner, and social circles their nearest friends; could you possibly con∣vince yourselves that you and <HI>Britain</HI> were to be friends no more. Thrice happy day! the consequences of which have taught the sons of <HI>America</HI> that a proper exercise of public spirit and the love of virtue hath been able to surprise and baffle the most formidable and most powerful tyranny on earth.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM is a virtue which will ever be universally admired, even by those incapable of possessing it. Its hap∣py effects are equally visible in individuals as in states, and if we bestow a moment's reflection upon the heroes of antiquity, who have been deservedly celebrated by suc∣ceeding generations, both for their abilities and conduct, we shall find that the true source of their greatness was this spirit of freedom, and their inviolable attachment to the interest of their country.</P>
<P>WITH an attentive silence we listen to the historian while he relates to us the integrity of conduct, the in∣vincible courage, the earnest glow of soul, and the ardent love of liberty which was exhibited in the lives of those illustrious men, and so great were their virtues that we are scarce able to credit them, but as the dreams of fancy, or the fictions of the ingenious.</P>
<P>IT is recorded of the celebrated Timoleon
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin.</NOTE>, general of Corinth, that notwithstanding he was blest with a temper singularly humane, and with feelings that were ever rou∣sed at the miseries of his fellow-men, he loved his coun∣try so passionately, that after making use of every argu∣ment
<PB N="137" REF="018997_0131_0FA911C20899B8A0"/>in his power to convince an elder brother of his er∣ror, for attempting to become the tyrant of it, he devoted him to death; a brother on whom he had previously pla∣ced his affection, and whose life being exposed to the fire of an enemy in a severe battle, he had before saved at the great risque of his own. Even in old age, after a period of rigid retirement for twenty years, we are attracted by the disinterested conduct of this exalted patriot.</P>
<P>WHEN the Syracusians, groaning under every species of cruelty, which lust, avarice and ambition could inflict, supplicated their generous neighbours for assistance, to alleviate those miseries they themselves had been exposed to. Timoleon, urged to accept the command of the Corinthian auxiliaries, at first hesitated, his age, his manners, his private happiness and the endearments of his family forbid it; but sensible that he was but a mem∣ber of the community, and stung by the cries of innocence, his inclinations were but of trivial moment in competition with his duty.</P>
<P>VIEW him at the head of his chosen army, assembled to plead the cause of suffering virtue. In possession of arms and of power, if inclined to pervert them, are his princi∣ples changed with his station? are his thoughts bept on conquest or on death? or does he entertain a secret wish to seize the moment of confidence, and build his greatness upon the ruin of the distressed, to remove one tyrant to reinstate another? no, but fired with a generous glow of foul, fired with the manly sentiments of freedom, with an implacable hatred to oppression of all kinds, he marches his troops to the deliverance of his afflicted people, and with a firmness becoming soldiers, fighting under the standard of liberty, after a series of fatigue and toil, har∣rassing marches and fierce conflicts, he dethrones the tyrant, and is proclaimed the deliverer of Syracuse.—Having re∣stored tranquility to this unhappy country, repeopled their
<PB N="138" REF="018997_0132_0FA911C2C7B52118"/>cities, revived their laws, and dispensed justice to all ranks and classes, he resigned his command, and retreated once again to the private walks of life, accompanied with the grateful acknowledgments of millions as the patron of their liberty and the saviour of their country.—Happy man! endowed with such a noble soul, prone to feel for the mis∣fortunes, and rejoice in the happiness of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>BUT why need we resort to distant ages to furnish us with istances of the effects of patriotism upon individuals? will not the present day afford at least one illustrious ex∣ample to our purpose? yes, my fellow-countrymen, AME∣RICA, young AMERICA too, can boast her patriots and heroes, men who have saved their country by their virtues, whose characters posterity will admire, and with a pleased attention, listen on tiptoe to the story of their glorious ex∣ertions. Let us pause a moment only upon the select cata∣logue, and take the first upon the list.—</P>
<P>VIEW him in his private station, and here, as though Providence, for his excellencies, had selected him for her own; from the extensive circle of humanity, we perceive him enjoying her richest dispensations. By an affluent fortune, placed beyond the reach of poverty or dependance, bless'd with the social circle of friends, and happily con∣nected by yet more endearing ties; peaceful reflections are his companions through the day, and the soothing slum∣bers of innocence hover over his couch: charity presides steward of his houshold, and the distressed are ever sure to receive from his bosom that sigh which never fails to console, and from his cheek the alleviating tear of sym∣pathy. Having reached the summit of human felicity, be∣yond even the picture of his most sanguine expectations, it is indifferent to him, as an individual, whether prince or people rule the state, but nurtured in the bosom of freedom, endowed with a greatness of soul, swallowed up with public spirit and the love of mankind, does oppression

<P>AND shall we, my countrymen, stop the current of gratitude? and can we forbear testifying our joy upon the success of such singular exertions? shall we seal his death before we thank him for his services? by no means.—Our acknowledgement will irresistably flow from us to this de∣served object of admiration, and his very actions will sting the soul of the ungrateful wretch, until he is forced to ad∣mire their lustre, and confess his inability to equal them.</P>
<P>SOME there are, who, Roman-like, would banish him for his good conduct; but while we copy the spirit of this great people, let us not be as diligent to catch their vices. Such conduct is inconsistent with the sentiments of freemen, and surely we cannot forget that he has saved our country.</P>

<P>SUCH is the progress of public spirit and the love of virtue, and it is the only pillar, upon which can safely be erected the happiness of mankind. Without some play of the locial affections in every society, without some barrier to oppose the stormy passions of individuals, without some
<PB N="141" REF="018997_0135_0FA911C9D4FB79A8"/>general attachment to the public welfare, a door is open to ambition and political corruption,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Assyrian, the Persian and Craesian, the three first univer∣sal monarchies, finally sunk under luxury and corruption; and it is well known that the Romans did not preserve their liberties for half a century after being debauched by the luxury of Asia, but fell a prey to its vices, and was at length divided by the Goths and Vandals.</NOTE> luxury and selfishness become fashionable vices, and the spirit of the government is perverted; the public good is neglected, the riches of the state insecure, the liberty of the subject slighted, and the attempts of the tyrant made successful by the follies of the people.</P>
<P>WHAT but the want of patriotism that hath buried in ruins the mighty empires of Greece and Rome; that standing armies, the scourge of the innocent, prevail throughout all Europe; that the pages of history present to our view so melancholly a picture of the human species, and that America and Britain are not at this day, running the road to greatness and glory in concert; and what is it but the want of patriotism that could induce this haughty nation, divested of every public virtue, of every bosom feeling, of every pretension to humanity, without apology or pretext to usher a standing army, composed of vagrants, criminals, and mercenaries, into our peaceful country.</P>
<P>O MY countrymen, it is the want of patriotism, that we are at this time called to weep over the wanton massacre of innocent men; that this is not the only house of mourning; that the fields of America have become devoted to war, and scenes of slaughter familiar to her sons; that our op∣pressors yet persist in their destructive system of tyranny, and if their power was equal to their thirst of blood, with the spirit of ambition, by which they are now directed, would lead them to destroy and extirpate the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> human race. But thanks be to heaven, that by the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of those
<PB N="142" REF="018997_0136_0FA911CCEF8C2E20"/>virtues which they have discarded, we have nobly resisted the attempts of these cruel men, and the miseries they have so profusely dealt out to us, are returning, with additional vengeance, upon their own heads. The danger of the issue is now past, and if we but retain the same patriotic ardor, with which we first defended our rights from the grasp of our enemies, they are every day in our power. We have every thing to hope; they on the other hand have every thing to fear. Youth, vigor, and the invincible arm of justice, are on our side:—The genius of liberty also is our advocate, who, though persecuted, hath never been con∣quered.</P>
<P>IN our day we are called to see a happy country laid waste at the shrine of ambition; to experience those seenes of distress which history is filled with, but experience ri∣vets its lessons upon the mind, and if we resolve with de∣liberation, and execute with vigor, we may yet be a free and flourishing people. Repine not too much at the ra∣vages of war, nor murmur at the dispensations of Providence. We oftentimes rate our blessings in proportion to the dif∣ficulty of attaining them, and if, without a struggle, we had secured our liberties, perhaps we should have been less sensible of their value. Chastisements in youth are not without their advantages; blessings most commonly spring from them in old age. They lead us to reflect seriously in the hour of retirement, and to cherish those qualifications, which are frequently lost in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he glare of prosperity.</P>
<P>THE important prophecy is nearly accomplished. The rising glory of this western hemisphere is already announ∣ced, and she is summoned to her seat among the nations. We have publicly declared ourselves convinced of the de∣structive tendency of standing armies: we have acknow∣ledged the necessity of public spirit and the love of virtue, to the happiness of any people, and we profess to be semi∣ble of the great blessings that slow from them. Let us not
<PB N="143" REF="018997_0137_0FA911CF0B54A668"/>then act unworthy of the reputable character we now sus∣tain: like the nation we have abandoned, be content with freedom in form and tyranny in substance, profess virtue and practice vice, and convince an attentive world that in this glorious struggle for our lives and properties, the only men capable of prizing such exalted privileges, were an illustrious set of heroes, who have seal'd their prin∣ciples with their blood. Dwell, my fellow-citizens, upon the present situation of your country. Remember that though our enemies have dispensed with the hopes of conquering, our land is not entirely freed of them, and should our resistance prove unsuccessful by our own inat∣tention and inactivity, death will be far preferable to the voke of bondage.</P>
<P>LET us therefore be still vigilant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver our enemies.— instil into our armies the righteous cause they protect and support, and let not the soldier and citizen be distinct cha∣racters among us. By our conduct let us convince them

Let integrity of heart, the spirit of freedom and rigid vir∣tue be seen to actuate every member of the commonwealth. Let not party rage, private animosities, or self interested motives, succeed that religious attachment to the public weal which has brought us successfully thus far; for vain are all the boasted charms of liberty if her greatest votaries are guided by such base passions. The tryal of our patri∣otism is yet before us, and we have reason to thank heaven, that its principles are so well known and diffused. Ex∣ercise towards each other the benevolent feelings of friend∣ship, and let that unity of sentiment, which has shone in the field, be equally animating in our councils.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that prosperity is dangerous; that though successful, we are not infallible, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at like the rest of man∣kind we are capable of erring. The line of our happiness may be traced with exactness, and still there may be a dif∣ficulty in persuing it. Let us not forget that our enemies have other arts in store for our destruction; that they are tempting us into those snares, which, after successful strug∣gles, proved the ruin of the empires of the East, and let this sacred maxim receive the deepest impression upon our minds, that if avarice, if extortion, if luxury and political corruption, are suffered to become popular among us, civil discord and the ruin of our country will be the speedy consequence of such fatal vices; but while patri∣otism is the leading principle, and our laws are contrived with wisdom, and executed with vigor, while industry, fru∣gality and temperance, are held in estimation, and we de∣pend upon public spirit and the love of virtue for our soci∣al happiness, peace and affluence will throw their smiles upon the brow of the individual, our commonwealth will flourish, our land become the land of liberty, and AMERICA an asylum for the oppressed.</P>

<P>AVOIDING apology, even at a time when un∣common propriety might justify it; and trusting ra∣ther to a continuance of the same liberality which has ever noted my countrymen, I <HI>attempt</HI> the duties of this solemn anniversary.</P>
<P>AND it is <HI>conceived</HI> that we shall, in some measure, perform those duties, if we sketch out some general traits of liberty, and mark the lines of her progress in particular nations; if we paint the wounds she has suffered from cor∣ruption and despotic force, and from the whole educe such sentiments as become a brave and free, though injured peo∣ple.</P>

Nimrod commenced his prelude to tyran∣ny, and Fame was clamorous with the deeds of death.— Liberty heared and trembled—considered herself an out∣cast, and has, on many times since, travelled up and down the world, forlorn, forsaken, majesty in rags. Nor will she, <HI>perhaps,</HI> until the millenium comes, if America does not now retain her, ever command that complete and <HI>permanent</HI> homage which is suitable to her nature. The old repub∣lics may have been the most perfect seats of her residence while they lasted, and are often mustered up from the tomb of empire to witness the adoration which they paid her. But even there she received so frequent violence that the continuance of her reign was for the most part precarious; and when even at the summit of her glory, she was only elevated that her fall might be more astonishing. Having passed all the degrees of fortune, thank GOD she has found her way to these remote shores: and, if from effects we may judge, she is well pleased with her new abode. O cherish the divine inhabitant! O let her not return to the courts above with a story that shall fire the heavens against us—that <HI>she</HI> had blessings for us, but that <HI>we</HI> were not pre∣pared to receive them—that she could find among us no lasting habitation; but that, like the dove after the de∣luge, she was scarce favoured with the top of some friendly mountain for a melancholy moment.</P>
<P>LIBERTY, my friends, is a palladium to the place of her dwelling, a rock and a sure defence. Wherever she is, every man has something to protect. He knows what are his riches, and that while he liveth himself shall gather them. He views, with conscious joy, his circumstances. His social affections shoot out and flourish. Even his pre∣judices are a source of satisfaction, and among them local attachment, a fault which leads to the side of patriotism.</P>
<P>SUPPORTED by and tenacious of these fruits of liberty,
<PB N="148" REF="018997_0142_0FA911D28C599730"/>some little free states, which the geographer in his map had <HI>otherways</HI> never noticed, have long stood uninjured by change, and some of them inaccessible by the greatest ef∣forts of power. There is now, in a distant quarter of the globe, a living illustration of this remark. Situate upon a venerable pile of rocks, in Italy, stands the common∣wealth of St. Marino. It was founded by a holy man whose name it bears, and who fled to this romantic fairy∣land to enjoy religion and free air, unpursued by power and the restless spirit of the world. His example was fol∣lowed by the pious, the humane, and the lovers of freedom. And these, a favourite few, who were before scattered up and down through other parts of Italy; who had lived all their days under arbitrary rule, and whom nature had secretly taught that there was somewhere a happier insti∣tution for man—these hurried away to the snowy top of St. Marino: and having there first tasted those rights which come down from GOD, made it their <HI>life</HI>'s <HI>labor</HI> to support and hand them down in purity. There every man finds his prosperity in submitting to those laws which dif∣fuse equality. There every man fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s himself happily liable to be called to the senate or the field: every man divides his day between alternate labor and the use of arms —on tip-toe, ready to start for the prize, the mark of universal emulation—the commonweal; officious to promote that interest which is at once the public's and his own. So stands a constitution informed with the very es∣sence of liberty. It has so stood, while other neighbour∣ing states have been blackened and defaced with frequent revolution. And we prophesy that 'till the approach of some unforeseen vice—till some degeneracy unknown to the fires creep upon the sons, St. Marino must stand admired: as, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present circumstance, no prince or potentate, af∣ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing down and counting the cost, will ever attempt the impenetrable union of much so prudence and virtue

<P>I HAD cherished some aversion to names grown trite by repetition, and had, on that account, evaded the antient republics. But I find the observation just, that "half our learning is their epitaph." I conceive that the "moss∣grown" columns and broken arches of those once-renowned empires are full with instruction as were the groves of Lyceum or the school of Plato. Let Greece then be the subject of a moment's reflection. When liberty fled from the gloom of Egypt, she sought out and settled at infant Greece—there disseminated the seeds of greatness—there laid the ground-work of republican glory.

Her maxims were drawn from nature, and one was "that nothing which bore the name of Greek was born for slavery." From this idea flowed an assistance to her sister states. From a like idea in her sister states that friendship was returned in grateful measure. This, had it continued, would have formed the link of empire, the charm that would have united and made Greece invulnerable. While it lasted, the joint efforts of her states rendered her a name and a praise through the whole earth. And here, was it not for the sake of a lesson to my country, I would not only drop my elogium of Greece, but draw an impervious veil over her remaining history. Her tenfold lustre might at this day have blazed to heaven, had the union
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Accuracy has been offended that this example is employed for the American States—which resemble each other in constitution and are united in their last resort; whereas the Greecian were unlike among themselves and professedly separate. But attention to the history of Greece will discover in the causes of her fall a lesson suf∣ficiently apposite to our purpose. The anonimous translator of Tour∣reil writes as follows: "when Persia, so often vanquished by the Greecians, despaired of subduing them, her last shift was to divide them; to which their prosperity opened her a means. Spirits na∣turally quick and too licentious, blown up with their frequent victories, could not contain themselves or govern their good fortune; they abandoned themselves to jealousies and ambition.—These divisions en∣ded, at last, in a general slavery."—

The banners <HI>late</HI> of conquering freedom now adorn the triumphs of oppression. Those states which lately stood in mighty concert, invincible, now breathe mutual jealousy and fall piece-meal a prey to the common enemy. Attic wisdom, Theban hardihood, Spartan valor, would not combine to save her. That very army, which Greece had bred and nourished to reduce the oriental pride, is turned vulture upon her own vitals—a damnable parricide, the faction of a tyrant. Behold the great and GOD-like Greece, with all her battlements and towers about her, borne head∣long from her giddy height—the shame, the pity of the world.</P>
<P>HAVING attempted some general sketches of liberty, from the dawn of social life to the fall of national glory, I would be somewhat more particular upon those qualities to which her triumphs are chiefly indebted.</P>
<P>IN the vile oeconomy of depraved man, there appears an inclination to bestow upon one part power and affluence, and to impose upon the other debility and woe. When that inclination is gratified, the majority being slaves, the remains of freedom are shared among the great; like the triumphal bridge at the Archipelago, so strangely dignifi∣ed, that, by a decree of senate, none of the vulgar were suffered to enjoy it. When that inclination is counter∣balanced by the laws; when the true interests of both those parts are reconciled; when society is considered as "a public combination for private protection
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earlo Abingdon.</NOTE>,"—and the governed find their happiness in their submission— there is the essence of all-powerful liberty. Not to wire-draw a sentiment already graven upon the hearts of this audience, it is such a liberty, as that every man who has once tasted it, becomes a temporary soldier,
<PB N="153" REF="018997_0147_0FA911DE2D133AF8"/>as soon as it is invaded and resents any violence offered it, as an attack upon his life—hence it is that, in free states, <HI>as such,</HI> there is no such thing as a perpetual standing army. For the whole body of the people, ever ready, flock to the general standard upon emergency, and so preclude the use of that infernal engine. I say <HI>infernal</HI> engine, for the tongue "<HI>labors,</HI> and is at a loss to express," the hideous and frightful consequences that flow wherever the powers of hell have procured its introduction. Turkey and Al∣giers are the delight of its vengeance. Denmark, once over-swarmed with the brave inhabitants of the north, has suffered depopulation, poverty, and the heaviest bondage, from the quartering troops amongst their peasants in time of peace: <HI>if it can be called peace,</HI> when robbery, con∣flagration, and murder are let loose upon the sons of men. Indeed, it is said that no nation ever kept up an army in time of peace that did not lose its liberties. I believe it. Athens, Corinth, Syracuse, and Greece in general were all overturned by that tremendous power: and the same power has been long operating with other causes to hum∣ble the crest of Britain. Let us hear a passage from Da∣venant! "If (says he, speaking of standing armies) if they who believed this eagle in the air frighted all mo∣tions towards liberty; if they who heretofore thought ar∣mies in time of peace, and our freedom inconsistent; if the same men should throw off a whig principle so funda∣mental, and thus come to clothe themselves with the de∣tested garments of the tories, and if all that has been here discoursed on should happen, then will the constitution of this country be utterly subverted

<P>THAT standing mercenary troops must sooner or later entail servitude and misery upon their employers, is an eter∣nal truth that appears from the nature of things.

Such were the troops who, led on by the patriot Warren, gave the first home-blow to our oppressors. Such were the troops who, fired by Gates in the northern woods, almost decided the fate of nations. Such were the troops who, under the great and amiable Lincoln, sustained a siege in circumstances that rank him and them with the captains and soldiers of antiquity. Such, we trust, are the troops, who, inferior number, though headed indeed by the gallant and judicious Morgan, lately vanquished a chosen veteran band long dedicated to Mars and disciplined in blood. And such, we doubt not, are
<PB N="155" REF="018997_0149_0FA911DF4B420CB0"/>the troops who beat the British legions from the Jersies, and have ever since preserved their country, under the con∣duct of that superior man who combines in quality the un∣shaken constancy of Cato, the triumphant delay of Fabius, and, <HI>upon proper occasions,</HI> the enterprising spirit of Hanni∣bal.</P>

This is a hard saying.

Hark! even now in the hollow wind I hear the voice of the departed. <HI>O ye, who listen to wisdom and aspire to immortality, as ye have avenged our blood, thrice blessed! as ye still war against the mighty hun∣ters of the earth, your names are recorded in heaven!</HI></P>

SUCH are the suggestions of fancy: and having given them their due scope; having described the memorable Fifth of March as a season of disaster, it would be an im∣piety not to consider it in its other relation. For the ri∣sing honors of these states are distant issues, as it were, from the intricate

Strike that night out of time, and we quench the first ardor of a resentment which has been ever since increasing, and now accelerates the fall of ty∣ranny. The provocations of that night must be numbered among the master-springs which gave the first motion to a vast machinery, a noble and comprehensive system of na∣tional independence. "The independence of America," says the writer under the signature of common sense, "should have been considered as dating its aera from the first musquet that was fired against her." Be it so! but Massachusetts may certainly date many of its blessings from the Boston massacre—a dark hour in itself, but from which a marvellous light has arisen. From that night revolution became inevitable, and the occasion commenced of the present most beautiful form of government. We often read of the original contract, and of mankind, in the early ages, passing from a state of nature to immediate civilization. But <HI>what eye</HI> could penetrate through gothic night and barbarous fable to that remote period. Such an eye, perhaps, was present, when the Deity conceived the universe and fixed his compass upon the great deep

AND yet the people of Massachusetts have reduced to practice the wonderful theory. A numerous people have convened in a state of nature, and, like <HI>our ideas</HI> of the patriarchs, have deputed a few fathers of the land to draw up for them a glorious covenant. It has been drawn. The people have signed it with rapture, and have, thereby, bat∣tered, among themselves, an easy degree of obedience for the highest possible civil happiness. To render that covenant eternal, patriotism and political virtue must forever blaze— must blaze at the <HI>present day</HI> with superlative lustre; being watched, from <HI>different motives,</HI> by the eyes of all mankind. Nor must that patriotism be contracted to a single com∣monwealth. A combination of the states is requisite to support them individually. "Unite or die" is our indis∣pensable motto. Every step from it is a step nearer to the region of death. This idea was never more occasional than at the present crisis—a crisis pregnant with fate and ready to burst with calamity. I allude to that languor which, like a low hung cloud, overshadows a great part of the thirteen states. That the young, enterprising America, who stepped out in the cause of humankind, and, no other arm daring, lopped the branches of wide despotic empire—that the same America should now suffer a few insolent bands to ravage her borders with impunity—that her <HI>now tardy</HI> hand should suspend the finishing stroke of resentment, and leave to her <HI>generous allies</HI> a labor which her own vigor ought to ef∣fect; this must disturb those, illestrious, who sell in her infant exertions; this must stab the peace of the dead, however it may affect the hearts of the living. Oh could I bear a part among the means of awakening virtue—oh could I call strength to these feeble lungs and borrow that note which shook the throne of Julius! vain wish! if the silent sug∣gestions of truth—if the secret whispers of reason are not sufficient—the efforts of human eloquence might be <HI>futile,</HI> her loudest bolt might roll <HI>unhee led!</HI></P>

THIS is not intended to inspire gloom; but only to persuade to those exertions which are necessary to life and independence. Let justice then be done to our country— let justice be done to our great Leader; and, the only means under heaven of our salvation, let his army be replenished. That grand duty over, we will once more adopt an en∣thusiasm sublime in itself, but still more so as coming from the lips of a first patriot—the chief magistrate of this commonwealth.

<P>WHEN I consider the important occasion from which this anniversary derives its origin, and the respect∣able characters that have exerted themselves to perpetuate its history, I confess there is an unusual security in my feelings; since no mistaken effort of mine can injure an institution, founded on so memorable an event, and sup∣ported by names so justly claiming the applause of posteri∣ty.</P>
<P>WHILE I rely, then, upon that honesty of intention, which is itself the best apology for its errors, permit me to employ the present hour, which your united voices have annually made sacred to the commemoration of our coun∣try's wrong, in recapitulating the most injurious of her
<PB N="162" REF="018997_0155_0FA911E94701C320"/>sufferings, among which that on the tragical fifth of <HI>March</HI> is by no means the least, and in recounting the blessings which have followed from measures as really disgraceful to those who adopted them, as they were intentionally de∣structive to those against whom they were levelled.</P>
<P>A NATION falling from those great principles of justice and virtue which had made her respectable; subverting the boasted improvements of her arts to the savage purpo∣ses of revenge; with venality and corruption entrenched on her cabinet, affords a spectacle too serious for the amuse∣ment of the beholder. He turns for relief to the annals of those people whose masculine virtues have obstinately, will he not say wifely, resisted the refinement of a civilized world. But from the misfortunes of such a nation, much is to be learned. As she is hurried onwards by the vortex of that immeasurable gulph, in which empires sink to rise no more, let her serve us as a signal to avoid the first impulse of its resistless tide.</P>
<P>TO trace Great-Britain through the whole progress of her ambition in this country, would be to step back to a very early period: for, long before she avowed her system of colonial slavery in the stamp-act, the liberties of our an∣cestors had endured the most alarming innovations from her throne. Without cause, and without notice, she had invalidated their charters; laid impositions upon their trade; attempted a most dangerous influence over their in∣ternal government, by endeavouring to make it indepen∣dent of the people;—and all this with the same confidence, as though her policy and foresight, and not her persecu∣tions, had settled them on this side the atlantic.</P>
<P>BUT the full display of her despotic policy was reserved to add accumulated disgrace to the inglorious reign of the third George. Then, intoxicated with <HI>America,</HI> she slum∣bered upon the tottering pillars of her own constitution;
<PB N="163" REF="018997_0156_0FA911EC5D39A4C8"/>the hand of slavery rocked her as she lay on the giddy height; falshood gilded her visions and bound her senses with the enchantment of success; while her blind ambition alone remained awake, to misdirect the ordinary assistance of fortune, and to make her fall equally certain and com∣plete.</P>
<P>THE genius of Britain once interred, the first spectre which shot from its tomb was the stamp-act. This promul∣gation of a scheme so repugnant to the fundamental princi∣ples of the late English constitution, announced the fall, but did not obliterate the memory of that much respected system, in this country. <HI>America</HI> saw that the act bore not a single feature of its reputed parent, and having de∣tected its illegitimacy, effectually resisted its operation. But, as though conviction must ever be productive of ob∣stinacy, Britain desisted not to rend in pieces the charters of her colonies, which served to remind her of the violence she committed on her own. Her administration affecting to realize the fables

<P>WHERE was the citizen whose indignation did not flash at this undisguised attack on his liberties? the soldiers pride too grew sanguinary at the idea of contempt from the people he himself had been taught to despise; and, as though heaven designed to effect its greatest purposes by the sacrifice of what men conceive to be the dearest objects
<PB N="164" REF="018997_0157_0FA911EE6A9C66C8"/>of its guardianship, the lives and rights of citizens were delivered over to the scourge of military rancour.</P>

"These are indeed my country's wounds,

<P>BRITAIN having thus violated the greatest law nations or individuals can be held by, to use the language of the an∣cients, threw a veil over the alters of her gods whom she was too haughty to appease. Would to heaven, for her sake, we too had a veil to hide from the eye of justice, the ashes of our desolated towns, and the tracts which her ravages have imprinted through every quarter of our once peaceful land.</P>
<P>IF
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Becaetia on crimes and punishments, p. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> "every act of authority of one person over another, for which there is not an absolute necessity, is tyrannical," and if tyranny justifies resistance, to have remained inactive, under these injures, had been a kind of political stoicism, equally inconsistent with the laws of nature and of society. On such principles arose the memorable declaration of <HI>July</HI> 1776.—A declaration which at once gave life and freedom to a nation; dissolved a monopoly unnatural as unjust; and extended the embraces of our country to the universe.—A declaration which heaven has since ratified by the successful event of her arms. For, when we consider the number of her victories; the disadvantages under which they were obtained; with the chain of important consequences which depended upon the very moment of their decision, who but must acknowledge, after allowing to our military actors every thing heroism can claim, that there appeared pecu∣liar marks of more than human assistance? the surrender of entire armies to a power which they affected to look up∣on
<PB N="166" REF="018997_0159_0FA911EFD813CD98"/>on rather as an object of their chains than of their swords, was a degree of glory which no enemy that ever passed the Roman yoke afforded to that republic.

<P>AMERICA once unfettered, nobly relied upon the up∣rightness of her cause and the bravery of her sons. But, as though the virtues of one crown were to apologize for the merciless cruelty of another, a monarch, equally wise in council as brilliant and powerful in arms, met her in an alliance which must ever enliven her gratitude; exalt the honor of France; and, we trust too, promote the in∣terest of both.</P>
<P>AMONG the advantages which have arisen from these great events to the people of <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> that of securing their lives, their liberties, and property, the great object of all civil government, by a constitution of their own framing, is not to be accounted the least. Dismembered from a government, which had long stood by the exactest balance of its powers, even against the corruption of its ministers, they found themselves accustomed to principles, which age had stamped with authority, and patriots sealed with their blood. The cause of their separation had taught them the avenues through which despotism insinuates itself into the community, and pointed out the means of excluding it. Under these circumstances they produced a system which, we trust, experience will evince to be an improve∣ment

They are remedies which at best always disclose and confess our evils. The body politic, once distempered, they may indeed be used as a crutch to support it a-while, but they can never heal it. <HI>Rome,</HI> when her bravery conquered the neighbouring nations, and united them to her own empire, was free from all danger within, because her armies, being urged on by a love for their country, would as readily suppress an internal as an external enemy. In those times she made no scruple to throw out her kings who had abused their power. But when her subjects fought not for the advantage of the commonwealth; when they thronged to the Asiatic wars for the spoils they produced, and preferred prostituting the rights of citizenship upon any barbarian that demanded them, to meeting him in the field for their support; then <HI>Rome</HI> grew too modest to accept from the hands of a dic∣tator those rights, which she ought to have impaled him for daring to invade. No alteration in her laws merely, could have effected this. Had she remained virtuous, she might as well have expelled her dictators as her kings. But what laws can save a people who, for the very purpose of enslaving themselves, chuse to consider them rather as councils which they may accept or refuse, than as precepts which they are bound to obey?

<P>INVITED to this place by your choice, and re∣collecting your well-known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndulgence, I feel myself already possessed of your candor, while I "impress upon your minds, the ruinous tendency of standing armies being placed in free and populous cities in a time of peace."</P>
<P>A FIELD here presents annually traversed by those, who, by their sagacity, have discovered, and by their voices de∣clared, in strains of manly eloquence, the source from whence those fatal streams originate, which, like the des∣troying pestilence, have depopulated kingdoms and laid waste the fairest empires.</P>

<P>WHEN the daring spirit of ambition, or the boundless lust of domination, has prompted men to invade the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The natural state of nations with respect to each other, is certainly that of society and peace. Such is the natural and primi∣tive state of one man with respect to another; and whatever al∣teration mankind may have made in regard to their original state, they cannot, without violating their duty, break in upon that state of peace and society, in which nature has placed them, and which, by her laws, she has strongly recommended to their observance.</P>

Men, as∣sembled from such motives, having expelled the enemy from their borders, re-assuming the pruning-hook and the spade, for the sword and the spear, have, in all ages, been called the saviours of their country.</P>
<P>A MILITIA is the most natural defence of a free state, from invasion and tyranny: they who compose the mi∣litia, are the proprietors of the soil; and who are so likely to defend it, as they who have received it from their ancestors—acquired it by their labor—or obtained it by their valor? every free man has within his breast the great essentials of a soldier, and having made the use of arms familiar, is ever ready for the field. And where is the tyrant who has not reason to dread an army of free∣men?</P>
<P>IN the battle of Naseby
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vict. Political Disquisitions.</NOTE>, in the days of Cromwell, the number of forces was equal on both sides; and all circum∣stances
<PB N="173" REF="018997_0166_0FA911F996AC5628"/>equal. In the parliament's army only nine offi∣cers had ever seen actual service, and most of the soldiers were London apprentices, drawn out of the city two months before. In the king's army there were about a thousand officers who had served abroad, yet the vete∣rans were routed by the apprentices.</P>
<P>ROME advanced on the zenith of glory and greatness, and conquered all nations in the times of the republic, while her army was an unpaid militia.</P>
<P>THE Greecians carried on their wars against Persia by means of their militia; and at last beat the numerous mercenary armies, and subdued the vast empire of Persia.</P>
<P>THE deeds of valor performed by my own countrymen, and in our day, are numerous and recent, and point out, as with a sun-beam, that the militia is to a free country a lasting security.</P>
<P>YOU will now permit me to consider the condition and consequences of a standing army.</P>
<P>MEN who inlist themselves for life soon lose the feelings of citizens. To command and be commanded, excites an idea of servitude and dependance, which degrades the mind, and in a social view destroys the character of a free agent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moore in his view of society and manners in Europe, observes —"As to the common soldiers, the leading idea of the discipline is, to reduce them, in many respects, to the nature of machines; that they may have no volition of their own, but be actuated solely by that of their officers; that they may have such a superlative dread of their officers, as annihilates all fear of the enemy; that they may move forward when ordered, without deeper reasoning or more concern than the firelocks they carry along with them."</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="018997_0167_0FA911FC81285F18"/>
THEY who follow the profession of arms conceive them∣selves exempted from the useful occupations of life, and thence contract a habit of dissipation; soldiers inured to exercise and labor in their duty, at leisure to roam, will not be wholly inactive in a city, where the means of gra∣tification abound; pursuing the objects of pleasure, with the same zeal with which they engaged in the toils and enterprises of the field, whole armies have, too late, found themselves destroyed by the dissolving power of luxury.</P>
<P>WE have a remarkable instance of this, my fellow-ci∣tizens, in the army of Hanibal, which, having withstood the greatest hardships, and which the most dreadful dangers had never been able to discourage, in winter quarters, at Capua, was entirely conquered by plenty and pleasures
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Livy's Roman history for an account of the battles, sus∣serings, and almost incredible march and destruction of the renown∣ed Carthaginian general and his army.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE effects of luxury, though productive of the greatest misfortunes to an army stationed in a city, are by no means confined to that class of men. The great body of the peo∣ple, smote by the charms and blandishments of a life of ease and pleasure, fall easy victims to its fascinations. The city, reared by the forming hand of industry, soon feels the symptons of dissolutions—the busy merchant now no more extends his commerce! the mechanic throws aside his chissel; the voice of riot succeeds to the sound of the hammer, and the midnight revel to the vigils of labour.</P>
<P>WHEN a large respectable standing army has been sta∣tioned in a city, commanded by officers of known patri∣otism, who have taught those under their orders, to inter∣change the kind and friendly offices of life; citizens, con∣ceiving themselves secured from domestic broils and the danger of invasion from abroad, imperceptibly relax in their attention to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itary exercises, and may thus be ex∣posed
<PB N="175" REF="018997_0168_0FA911FC96ED3B70"/>as a tempting bait to an aspiring despot; besides, a people who have made themselves respectable by their per∣sonal attention to their own defence, neglecting their mili∣tia, may be insulted by those neighbours who had formerly been accustomed to revere their power.</P>
<P>WHEN communities have so far mistaken their interest as to commit the defence of every thing valuable in life to a standing army, the love of ease will scarcely permit them to re-assume the unpleasing task of defending themselves.</P>
<P>AT the conclusion of a long and bloody war, the liber∣berties of a people are in real danger from the admission of troops into a free city. When an army has suffered eve∣ry hardship to which the life of a soldier is peculiarly inci∣dent, and has returned crowned with the well-carned lau∣rels of the field, they justly expect to be received into the open arms, and with the applauses of those for whom they have fought, and in whose cause they have bled; in a situ∣ation like this, whole communities, in transport of grati∣tude, have weakly sacrificed at the shrine of a deliverer, every thing for which their armies have fought, or their heroes of bled.</P>
<P>NATIONS the most renowned among the ancients for their wisdom and their policy, have viewed the army with an eye of attentive jealousy; the Romans characterized for <HI>personal bravery</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>In the battles fought in our age, every single soldier has very little security and confidence except in the multitude; but among the Romans, every individual, more robust and of greater experience in war, as well as more inured to the fatigues of it, than the enemy, relied upon himself only.

These politic people knew the prevailing propeusity in all mankind to pow∣er. The history of later times has abundantly justified the wisdom of their jealousies. All parts of Europe which have been enslaved, have been enslaved by armies. No nation can be said to enjoy internal liberty which admits them in a time of peace. When a government has a body of standing troops at command, it is easy to form preten∣sions for the distribution of them, so as to effect their own purposes; when a favourite point is to be carried, a thou∣sand soldiers may convey irresistable argument, and compel men to act against their feelings, interest, and country.</P>
<P>SUCH were the arguments employed by Philip the se∣cond, of Spain, to persuade the inhabitants of the Nether∣lands to relinquish their liberties, their property, and their religion; the progress of these dreadful measures produced scenes of massacre and devastation, the recital of which must excite exquisite horror in the most savage breast.</P>
<P>ONE of the commanders of the army under the duke of Alva, demanding a pass a pass through the city of Rotterdam
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole affair is related at length <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Watson's hist, of the Low Countries, to which the reader is referred.</NOTE>, was at first refused, but assuring the magistrates that he meant only to lead his troops through the town, and not to lodge them in it, they consented to suffer the companies to pass through one by one: no sooner had the first com∣pany entered the city, than the officer, without regard to his engagements, ordered them to keep the gates open until the other companies should arrive: one of the citi∣zens, endeavouring to shut the gate, was killed by his own hand; his troops, eager to follow his example, drew their swords, and, giving a loose to their fury, spread them∣selves over the town, and butchered more than three hun∣dred of the inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="018997_0170_0FA911FEC46E9138"/>
THIS was among the first events of that war which ren∣dered the Netherlands a scene of horror and devastation for more than thirty years; but which, whilst it proved the source, on many occasions, of extreme distress to the people, called forth an exertion of virtue, spirit, and in∣trepidity, which seldom occurs in the annals of history. Never was there a more unequal contest than between the inhabitants of the Low-Countries and the Spanish m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣narch; and never was the issue of any dispute more con∣trary to what the parties had reason to expect.</P>
<P>UNDER similar circumstances, my fellow-citizens, a standing army was introduced and stationed in this city; which produced the scene we now commemorate; and which I know you cannot all remember; but let the stran∣ger hear and let the listening youth be told,—<HI>that on the evening of the fifth of March, seventeen hundred and seventy, under the orders of a mercenary officer, murder, with her pol∣luted weapons, stood trampling in the blood of our slaughtered countrymen;</HI> imagination cannot well conceive what min∣gling passions then convulsed the soul and agonized the heart!—those pangs were sharp indeed which ushered into life, a <HI>naetion!</HI>—like <HI>Hercules</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hercules is represented when very young, engaged in the most courageous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angerous enterprizes—such as encountering lions, squeezing them to death against his own breast, or tearing their jaws asunder; sometimes when an infant, grasping serpents with a little smile upon his cheek, as if he was pleased with their fine colours and their motions, and killing them by his strong gripe with so much case that he scarce deigns to look upon them.</NOTE> she rose brawny from the cradle, the snakes of <HI>Britain</HI> yet hung hissing round her horrible, and fell!—at her infant voice they hasted—at the dread of her rising arm they fled away.</P>

<P>IT has become fashionable in Europe, to keep a large standing army in times of peace. The people of Great-Britain have professed their aversion to the establishment, yet have suffered it to gain ground upon the idea of pre∣serving the balance of power. This custom is so deeply rooted and so firmly established, that nothing short of an∣nihilation of the governments where they have been so long tolerated can abolish the institution.</P>
<P>FROM the situation and vicinity of the nations of Eu∣rope with respect to each other, the different extent of ter∣ritory rendering it more difficult to repel an invasion from some countries than others, for the celerity of defence and the more compleat security of extensive countries; from these and similar considerations, even wise politicians have defended the propriety of the establishment; but let their motives be ever so pure, the <HI>ambitious</HI> and the <HI>aspiring</HI> have views extensive and ruinous; they have felt the charms and experienced the utility of this engine, and are not wanting in their exertions to support its existence.</P>
<P>OUR fortunate alliances in Europe have secured us from any danger of invasion from thence; this security is der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved from considerations of the best policy and true in∣tered of the allied powers.</P>
<P>THE new and <HI>glorious treaty,</HI> concluded, since the last an∣niversary, with the <HI>States of Holland,</HI> whose <HI>manners, laws religion,</HI> and <HI>bloody contes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for freedom,</HI> so nearly resemble our

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If there was ever among nations a natural alliance, one may be formed between the two republics. The first planters of the four northern states found in this country an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ylum from persecution, and resided here from the year one thousand six hundred and eight, to the year one thousand six hundred and twent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, twelve years preceeding their migration. They ever entertained and have transmitted to posterity, a grateful remembrance of that protection and hospitality, and especially of that religious liberty they found here, having sought it in vain in England.</P>
<P>"The first inhabitants of two other states, New-York and New-Jersey, were immediate emigrants from this nation, and have trans∣mitted their religion, language, customs, manners and character: and America in general, until her connexions with the house of Bourbon, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> considered this nation as her first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end in Eu∣rope, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and the great characters it exhibits, in the va∣rious arts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, as well as atchievements of war by sea a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d land, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en particularly, studied, admired, and imita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in every state.</P>
<P>"A similitude of religion, although it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not deemed so essential in this as in former ages, to the alliance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is still, as it over will be thought, a desirable circumstance. Now it may be said with truth, that there are no two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, whose worship, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣trine and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scipline, are more alike than those of the two republics. In this particular therefore, as far as it is of weight, an alliance would be perfectly natural.</P>
<P>"A similarity in the forms of government, is usually considered as another circumstance which renders alliances natural: and al∣though the constitutions of the two republics are not perfectly alike, there is yet analogy enough between them, to make a connexion easy in this respect.</P>
<P>"The originals of the two republics are so much alike, that the history of one seems but a transcript from that of the other: so that every Dutchman instructed in the subject, must pronounce the Ame∣rican revolution just and necessary, or pass a censure upon the great∣est actions of his immortal ancestors: actions which have been ap∣proved and applauded by mankind, and justified by the decision of heaven.</P>
<P>"If therefore an analogy of religion, government, original man∣ners, and the most extensive and lasting commercial interests, can form a ground and an invitation to political connexions, the sub∣scriber flatters himself, that in all these particulars, the union is so obviously natural, that there has seldom been a more distinct desig∣nation of Providence to any two distant nations to unite themselves together."</P>

WHEN we consider our own prosperous condition, and view of the state of that nation, of which we were once a part, we even weep over our enemy, when we reflect that she was once great; that her navies rode formidable upon the ocean; that her commerce was extended to every har∣bour of the globe; that her name was revered wherever it was known; that the wealth of nations was deposited in her island; and that America was her friend, but by means of her standing armies, an immense continent is separated from her kingdom
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A doubt may be entertained of the truth of this assertion; but we can hardly believe that it would have entered into the head of a minister or parliament, to collect a militia in Great-Britain to enforce their acts in America; so that in our view, had the army been disbanded at the end of the last war, America and Britain a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this moment would have been parts of the same kingdom.</NOTE>, and that once-mighty em∣pire, ready to fall an untimely victim, to her own mad policy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>ILLUSTRIOUS RELICKS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT tidings from the grave? why hast thou left the peaceful mansions of the tomb, to visit again this troubled earth! art thou the welcome messenger of peace! art thou risen again to exhibit thy glorious wounds, and thro' them proclaim salvation to thy country! or art thou come to demand that last debt of humanity, to which your rank and merit have so justly entitled you—but which has been so long ungenerously withheld! and art thou angry at the barbarous usage? be appeased, sweet ghost! for though thy body has long laid undistinguished among the vulgar dead, scarce privileged with earth enough to hide it from the birds of prey; though not a kindred tear was dropt, though not a friendly sigh was uttered, o'er thy grave; and though the execration of an impious foe, were all thy funeral knells; yet matchless patriot! thy memory has been embalmed in the affections of thy grateful countrymen; who, in their breast, have raised eternal monuments to thy bravery!</P>
<P>BUT let us leave the beloved remains, and contemplate for a moment, those virtues of the man, the exercise of which have so deservedly endeared him to the honest among the great, and the good among the humble.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="018997_0178_0FA91209AD7F8D70"/>
IN the <HI>private</HI> walks of life, he was a pattern for man∣kind.—The tears of her, to whom the world is indebted for so much virtue, are silent heralds of his <HI>filial piety;</HI> while his tender offspring, in lisping out their father's care, proclaim his <HI>parential affection:</HI> and an ADAMS can witness with how much zeal he loved where he had formed the sacred connexion of a <HI>friend:</HI>—their kindred souls were so closely twined, that both felt one joy, both one affliction. In conversation he had the happy talent of addressing his subject both to the understanding and the passions; from the one he forced conviction, from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other he stole assent.</P>
<P>HE was blessed with a complacency of disposition, and equanimity of temper, which peculiarly endeared him to his friends; and which, added to the deportment of the gentleman, commanded reverence and esteem even from his enemies.</P>
<P>SUCH was the tender sensibility of his soul, that he need but see distress to feel it, and contribute to its relief. He was deaf to the calls of interest even in the course of his profession: and wherever he beheld an indigent object, which claimed his healing skill, he administered it, without even the hope of any other reward than that which resulted from the reflection of having so far promoted the happiness of his fellow-men.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>social</HI> departments of life, practising upon the strength of that doctrine, he used so earnestly to inculcate himself, that nothing so much conduced to enlighten man∣kind, and advance the great end of society at large, as the frequent interchange of sentiments, in friendly meetings; we find him constantly engaged in this eligible labor; but on none did he place so high a value, as on that <HI>most ho∣norable</HI> of all detached societies, THE FREE AND AC∣CEPTED MASONS: into this fraternity he was early ini∣tiated; and after having given repeated proofs of a rapid
<PB N="189" REF="018997_0179_0FA9120B27059BD8"/>proficiency in the arts, and after evidencing by his life, the professions of his lips—finally, as the reward of his merit, he was commissioned <HI>the most worshipful</HI> GRAND∣MASTER of all the antient Masons, through <HI>North-Ame∣rica.</HI>—And you brethren, are living testimonies, with how much honor to himself, and benefit to the craft uni∣versal, he discharged the duties of his elevated trust; with what sweetened accents he courted your attention, while, with <HI>wisdom, strength, and beauty,</HI> he instructed his lodges in the secret arts of <HI>Freemasonry;</HI> what perfect order and decorum he preserved in the government of them; and in all his conduct, what a bright example he set us, <HI>to live within compass, and act upon the square.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what pleasure did he silence the wants of poor and pennyless brethren; yea, the necessitous every where, though ignorant of the mysteries of the craft, from his benefactions, felt the happy effects of that institution which is founded on <HI>faith, hope, and charity.</HI> And the world may cease to wonder, that he so readily offered up his life, on the altar of his country, when they are told, that the main pillar of <HI>masonry,</HI> is the LOVE OF MANKIND.</P>
<P>THE fates, as though they would reveal, in the person of our GRAND-MASTER, those mysteries, which have so long lain hid from the world, have suffered him, like the great master-builder in the temple of old, to fall by the hands of Ruffians, and be again raised in honor and authority: we searched in the field for the murdered son of a widow, and we four him, <HI>by the turf and the twig,</HI> buried on the brow of a hill, though not in a decent grave.—And tho' we must again commit his body to the tomb, yet out breasts shall be the burying spot of his <HI>masonic virtues,</HI> and there—
<Q><L><HI>"An adamantine monument we'll rear,"</HI></L>
<L><HI>"With this inscription,"</HI> Masonry <HI>"lies here."</HI>—</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="018997_0180_0FA9120B852152F0"/>
IN <HI>public</HI> life, the sole object of his ambition was, to ac∣quire the conscience of virtuous enterprizes; <HI>amor patriae</HI> was the spring of his actions, and <HI>mens conscia recti</HI> was his guide.—And on this security he was, on every occasion, ready to sacrifice his health, his interest, and his ease, to the sacred calls of his country. When the liberties of America were attacked, he appeared an early champion in the contest; and though his knowledge and abilities would have insured riches and preferment (could he have stoop'd to prostitution) yet he nobly withstood the fascinating charm, tossed Fortune back her plume, and pursued the in∣flexible purpose of his soul, in guiltless competence.</P>
<P>HE sought not the airy honors of a name, else, many of those publications, which in the early period of our con∣troversy served to open the minds of the people, had not appeared anonymous. In every time of eminent danger, his fellow-citizens flew to him for advice; like the orator of Athens, he gave it, and dispelled their fears:—twice did they call him to the rostrum, to commemorate the massacre of their brethren; and from that instance, in persuasive language, he taught them, not only the dange∣rous tendency, but the actual mischief, of stationing a mili∣tary force, in a free city, in a time of peace.—They learnt the profitable lesson, and pen'd it among their grievan∣ces.</P>
<P>BUT his abilities were too great, his deliberations too much wanted, to be confined to the limits of a single city, and at a time when our liberties were most critically in danger from the secret machinations and open assaults of our enemies, this town, to their lasting honor, elected him to take a part in the councils of the state.—And with what faithfulness he discharged the important delegation, the neglect of his private concerns, and his unwearied atten∣dance on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etrustment, will sufficiently testify: and the records of that virtuous assembly will remain the testi∣monials
<PB N="191" REF="018997_0181_0FA9120C41F586A0"/>of his accomplishments as a statesman, and his in∣tegrity and services as a patriot, through all posterity.</P>
<P>THE Congress of our colony could not observe so much virtue and greatness without honoring it with the highest mark of their favor; and by the free suffrages of that un∣corrupted body of freemen, he was soon called to preside in the senate—where by his daily counsels and exertions, he was constantly promoting the great cause of <HI>general liberty.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when he found the tools of oppression were ob∣stinately bent on violence; when he found the vengeance of the British court must be glutted with blood; he deter∣mined, that what he could not effect by his eloquence or his pen, he would bring to purpose by his sword. And on the memorable 19th of April, he appeared in the field, under the united characters of the general, the soldier, and the physician. Here he was seen animating his countrymen to battle, and fighting by their side, and there he was found administering healing comforts to the wounded. And when he had repelled the unprovoked assaults of the enemy, and had driven them back into their strong-holds, like the virtuous chief of Rome, he returned to the senate, and presided again at the councils of the fathers.</P>
<P>WHEN the vanquished foe had rallied their disordered army, and by the acquisition of fresh strength, again pre∣sumed to fight against freemen: our patriot, ever anxious to be where he could do the most good, again put off the senator, and, in contempt of danger, flew to the field of battle, where, after a stern, and <HI>almost</HI> victorious resistance, ah! too soon for his country! he sealed his principles with his blood—then—
<Q><L>"<HI>Freedom wept, that</HI> MERIT <HI>could not save,</HI>"</L>
<L><HI>But</HI> WARREN's manes <HI>"must enrich the grave."</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="192" REF="018997_0182_0FA9120D072C78B8"/>Enrished indeed! and the heights of <HI>Charlestown</HI> shall be more memorable for thy fall, than the <HI>Plains of Abraham</HI> are for that of the hero of <HI>Britain.</HI> For while <HI>he</HI> died con∣tending for a single country, <HI>you</HI> fell in the cause of virtue and mankind.</P>
<P>THE greatness of his soul shone even in the moment of death; for, if fame speaks true, in his last agonies he met the insults of his barbarous foe with his wonted magnini∣mity, and with the true spirit of a soldier, frowned at their impotence.</P>
<P>IN fine, to complete the great character—like HAR∣RINGTON he wrote—like CICERO he spoke—like HAMPDEN he lived—and like WOLFE he died.</P>
<P>AND can we, my countrymen, with indifference behold so much valour laid prostrate by the hand of <HI>British tyranny!</HI> and can we ever grasp that hand in affection again? are we not yet convinced "that he who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored indian, is less a sa∣vage than the <HI>king of Britain"!</HI> have we not proofs, wrote in blood, that the corrupted nation, from whence we sprang, (though there may be some traces of their ancient virtue left) are stubbornly fixed on our destruction! and shall we still court a <HI>dependance</HI> on such a state? still contend for a connexion with those who have forfeited not only every kindred claim, but even their title to humanity! forbid it the spirit of the brave MONTGOMERY! forbid it the spirit of immortal WARREN! forbid it the spirits of all our va∣liant countrymen! who fought, bled, and died for far dif∣ferent purposes: and who would have thought the purchase <HI>dear indeed!</HI> to have paid their lives for the paltry boon of displacing one set of villains in power, to make way for another. No. They contended for the establishment of peace, liberty, and safety to their country; and we are unworthy to be called their countrymen, if we stop at any acquisition short of this.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="018997_0183_0FA9120DC1EFE538"/>
Now is the happy season, to seize again those rights, which, as men, we are by nature entitled to, and which, by contract, we never have and never could have surrendered:— but which have been repeatedly and violently attacked by the <HI>king, lords and commons of Britain.</HI> Ought we not then to disclaim forever, the forfeited affinity; and by a timely amputation of that rotten limb of the empire, prevent the mortification of the whole? ought we not to listen to the voice of our slaughtered brethren, who are now proclaim∣ing aloud to their country—
<Q><L><HI>Go tell the king, and tell him from our spirits,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That you and Britons can be friends no more;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tell him to you all tyrants are the same:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or if in bonds, the never conquer'd soul</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can feel a pang, more keen than slavery's self,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis where the chains that crush you into dust,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are forg'd by hands, from which you hop'd for freedom.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>YES, we ought, and will,—we will assert the blood of our murdered hero against thy hostile oppressions, O shame∣less Britain! and when "thy cloud-cap'd towers, thy gor∣geous palaces" shall by the teeth of pride and folly, be levelled with the dust—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d when thy glory shall have fa∣ded like the western sunbeam—the <HI>name and the virtues of</HI> WARREN shall remain immortal.</P>

<HEAD>A POEM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following masterly piece of</HI> original composition <HI>is from the pen of</HI> JAMES ALLEN, <HI>of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and was writen when his feelings, like those of every other</HI> free-born American, <HI>were all alive at the inhuman murders of our countrymen, in the streets of that town, on the evening of the fifth of March,</HI> 1770, <HI>and which gave birth to several of the preceeding orations, in which that act of</HI> British <HI>violence and brutality is, in strong colours▪ depicted. Although this poem is now re-published without the previous knowledge or consent of the author, the printer hopes he shall not incur the author's displeasure hereby, especially when it is made known to him, that the present re-publication is at the request of several of the printer's customers, who are desirous to convince the</HI> British <HI>that true</HI> classical English po∣etry, <HI>may be produced in other parts of the world, as well as in their own little island.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>FROM realms of bondage and a tyrant's reign,</L>
<L>Our GOD-like father's bore no slavish chain,</L>
<L>To <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s face th' inspired <HI>Patriarchs</HI> stood,</L>
<L>To seal their virtue, with a martyr's blood:</L>
<L>But lives so precious, such a sacred seed,</L>
<L>The source of empires, heav'n's high will decreed;</L>
<L>He snatch'd the SAIN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s impious hand,</L>
<L><PB N="196" REF="018997_0185_0FA91210DCA08D60"/>
And bade his chosen seek this distant land:</L>
<L>Then to these climes th' illustrious exiles sped,</L>
<L>'Twas freedom prompted, and the Godhead led.</L>
<L>Eternal woods the virgin soil defac'd,</L>
<L>A dreary desart, and an howling waste;</L>
<L>The haunt of tribes no pity taught to spare,</L>
<L>And they oppos'd them with remorseless war,</L>
<L>But heav'n's right arm led forth the faithful train,</L>
<L>The guardian Godhead swept the insidious plain,</L>
<L>'Till the scour'd thicket amicable stood,</L>
<L>Nor dastard ambush, trench'd the dusky wood:</L>
<L>Our sires then earn'd no more, precarious bread,</L>
<L>Nor midst alarms their frugal meals were spread,</L>
<L>Fair boding hopes inur'd their hands to toil,</L>
<L>And patriot virtue nurs'd the thriving soil,</L>
<L>Nor scarce two ages have their periods run,</L>
<L>Since o'er their culture smil'd the genial sun;</L>
<L>And now what states extend their fair domains,</L>
<L>O'er fleecy mountains and luxuriant plains;</L>
<L>Where happy millions their own fields possess,</L>
<L>No <HI>tyrant</HI> awes them, and no <HI>lords</HI> oppress;</L>
<L>The hand of rule divine discretion guides,</L>
<L>And white-rob'd virtue o'er her paths presides,</L>
<L>Each polic'd order venerates the laws,</L>
<L>And each ingenuous speaks in freedom's cause;</L>
<L>The <HI>Spartan</HI> spirit, nor the <HI>Roman</HI> name,</L>
<L>The patriot's pride, shall rival these in same;</L>
<L>Here all the sweets that social life can know,</L>
<L>From the full font of civil sapience flow;</L>
<L>Here golden <HI>Ceres</HI> cloaths th' autumual plain,</L>
<L>And art's <HI>fair Empress</HI> holds her new domain;</L>
<L>Here angel <HI>Science</HI> spreads her lucid wing,</L>
<L>And hark, how sweet the new-born <HI>Muses</HI> sing;</L>
<L>Here generous <HI>Commerce</HI> spreads her liberal hand,</L>
<L>And scatters foreign blessings tound the land.</L>
<L>Shall meagre <HI>Mammon,</HI> or proud lust of sway,</L>
<L>Reverse these scenes—will heav'n permit the day:</L>
<L><PB N="197" REF="018997_0186_0FA912118BA1C0B0"/>
Shall in this <HI>aera</HI> all our hopes expire,</L>
<L>And weeping freedom from her fanes retire?</L>
<L>Here shall the tyrant still our peace pursue,</L>
<L>From the pain'd eye-brow drink the vital dew;</L>
<L>Not nature's barrier wards our FATHER's foe,</L>
