<LG>
<L>AT summer eve, when Heav'n's aerial bow</L>
<L>Spans with bright arch the glittering hills below,</L>
<L>Why to yon mountain turns the musing eye,</L>
<L>Whose sunbright summit mingles with the sky?</L>
<L>Why do these cliffs of shadowy tint appear</L>
<L>More sweet than all the landscape smiling near?</L>
<L>'Tis Distance lends enchantment to the view,</L>
<L>And robes the mountain in its azure hue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="037087_0006_100C48A123DC82F0"/>
<L>Thus, with delight, we linger to survey</L>
<L N="10">The promis'd joys of life's unmeasur'd way;</L>
<L>Thus, from afar, each dim-discover'd scene</L>
<L>More pleasing seems than all the past hath been;</L>
<L>And every form that fancy can repair</L>
<L>From dark oblivion, glows divinely there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="15">What potent spirit guides the raptur'd eye</L>
<L>To peirce the shades of dim futurity?</L>
<L>Can Wisdom lend, with all her heav'nly pow'r,</L>
<L>The pledge of Joy's anticipated hour?</L>
<L>Ah, no! she darkly sees the fate of man—</L>
<L N="20">Her dim horizon bounded to a span;</L>
<L>Or, if she hold an image to the view,</L>
<L>'Tis Nature pictur'd too severely true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With thee, sweet Hope! resides the heav'nly light,</L>
<L>That pours remotest rapture on the sight;</L>
<L N="25"><PB N="11" REF="037087_0007_100C48A325213408"/>Thine is the charm of life's bewilder'd way,</L>
<L>That calls each slumb'ring passion into play.</L>
<L>Wak'd by thy touch, I see the sister band,</L>
<L>On tiptoe watching, start at thy command,</L>
<L>And fly where'er thy mandate bids them steer,</L>
<L N="30">To Pleasure's path, or glory's bright career.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Primeval Hope, the Aonian Muses say,</L>
<L>When Man and Nature mourn'd their first decay;</L>
<L>When every form of death, and every woe,</L>
<L>Shot from malignant stars to earth below;</L>
<L N="35">When Murder bared his arm, and rampant War</L>
<L>Yok'd the red dragons of her iron car;</L>
<L>When Peace and Mercy, banish'd from the plain,</L>
<L>Sprung on the viewless winds to Heav'n again;</L>
<L>All all forsook the friendless guilty mind,</L>
<L N="40">But Hope, the charmer, linger'd still behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="037087_0008_100C48A4AB11ECB8"/>
<L>Thus, while Elijah's burning wheels prepare,</L>
<L>From Carmel's height to sweep the fields of air,</L>
<L>The prophet's mantle, ere his flight began,</L>
<L>Dropt on the world—a sacred gift to man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="45">Auspicious Hope! in thy sweet garden grow</L>
<L>Wreaths for each toil, a charm for every woe:</L>
<L>Won by their sweets, in Nature's languid hour,</L>
<L>The way-worn pilgrim seeks thy summer bower;</L>
<L>There, as the wild bee murmurs on the wing,</L>
<L N="50">What peaceful dreams thy handmaid spirits bring;</L>
<L>What viewless forms th' Aeolian organ play,</L>
<L>And sweep the furrowed lines of anxious thought away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Angel of life! thy glittering wings explore</L>
<L>Earth's loneliest bounds, and Ocean's wildest shore.</L>
<L N="55"><PB N="13" REF="037087_0009_100C48A7D0DC0658"/>Lo! to the wint'ry winds the pilot yields</L>
<L>His bark careering o'er unfathom'd fields;</L>
<L>Now on Atlantic waves he rides afar,</L>
<L>Where Andes, giant of the western star,</L>
<L>With meteor-standard to the winds unfurl'd,</L>
<L N="60">Looks from his throne of clouds o'er half the world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now far he sweeps, where scarce a summer smiles,</L>
<L>On Behrring's rocks, or Greenland's naked isles;</L>
<L>Cold on his midnight watch the breezes blow,</L>
<L>From wastes that slumber in eternal snow;</L>
<L N="65">And waft, across the wave's tumultuous roar,</L>
<L>The wolf's long howl from Oonalaska's shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor child of danger, nursling of the storm,</L>
<L>Sad are the woes that wreck thy manly form!</L>
<L>Rocks, waves, and winds, the shatter'd bark delay;</L>
<L N="70">Thy heart is sad, thy home is far away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="037087_0010_100C326E662DC208"/>
<L>But Hope can here her moonlight vigils keep,</L>
<L>And sing to charm the spirit of the deep:</L>
<L>Swift as yon streamer lights the starry pole,</L>
<L>Her visions warm the watchman's pensive soul.</L>
<L N="75">His native hills that rise in happier climes,</L>
<L>The grot that heard his song of other times,</L>
<L>His cottage home, his bark of slender sail,</L>
<L>His glassy lake, and broomwood blossom'd vale,</L>
<L>Rush on his thought; he sweeps before the wind,</L>
<L N="80">Treads the lov'd shore he sigh'd to leave behind;</L>
<L>Meets at each step a friend's familiar face,</L>
<L>And flies at last to Helen's long embrace;</L>
<L>Wipes from her cheek the rapture-speaking tear,</L>
<L>And clasps, with many a sigh, his children dear!</L>
<L N="85">While, long neglected, but at length caress'd,</L>
<L>His faithful dog salutes the smiling guest,</L>
<L>Points to the master's eyes (where'er they roam)</L>
<L>His wistful face, and whines a welcome home.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="037087_0011_100C48ABE5090C70"/>Friend of the brave! in peril's darkest hour,</L>
<L N="90">Intrepid Virtue looks to thee for power;</L>
<L>To thee the heart its trembling homage yields,</L>
<L>On stormy floods, and carnage-cover'd fields,</L>
<L>When front to front the banner'd hosts combine,</L>
<L>Halt ere they close, and form the dreadful line.</L>
<L N="95">When all is still on Death's devoted soil,</L>
<L>The march-worn soldier mingles for the toil;</L>
<L>As rings his glittering tube, he lifts on high</L>
<L>The dauntless brow, and spirit-speaking eye.</L>
<L>Hails in his heart the triumph yet to come,</L>
<L N="100">And hears thy stormy music in the drum!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And such thy strength-inspiring aid that bore</L>
<L>The hardy Byron to his native shore—<SUP>1</SUP></L>
<L>In horrid climes, where Chiloe's tempests sweep</L>
<L>Tumultuous murmurs o'er the troubled deep,</L>
<L N="105"><PB N="16" REF="037087_0012_100C48AD6A29B768"/>'Twas his to mourn misfortune's rudest shock,</L>
<L>Scourg'd by the winds, and cradled on the rock,</L>
<L>To wake each joyless morn, and search again</L>
<L>The famish'd haunts of solitary men;</L>
<L>Whose race, unyielding as their native storm,</L>
<L N="110">Knows not a trace of Nature but the form;</L>
<L>Yet, at thy call, the hardy tar pursued,</L>
<L>Pale but intrepid, sad but unsubdued,</L>
<L>Pierc'd the deep woods, and, hailing from afar,</L>
<L>The moon's pale planet, and the northern star;</L>
<L N="115">Paus'd at each dreary cry, unheard before,</L>
<L>Hyaenas in the wild, and mermaids on the shore;</L>
<L>Till, led by thee o'er many a cliff sublime,</L>
<L>He found a warmer world, a milder clime,</L>
<L>A home to rest, a shelter to defend,</L>

<L>Congenial Hope! thy passion-kindling power</L>
<L>How bright, how strong, in youth's untroubled hour!</L>
<L>On yon proud height, with Genius hand in hand,</L>

<L>Lo! Newton, Priest of Nature, shines afar,</L>
<L>Scans the wide world, and numbers ev'ry star!</L>
<L>Wilt thou, with him, mysterious rites apply,</L>
<L N="130">And watch the shrine with wonder-beaming eye?</L>
<L>Yes, thou shalt mark, with magic art profound,</L>
<L>The speed of light, the circling march of sound;</L>

<HEAD>NOTES ON PART I.</HEAD>
<P>Note 1. And such thy strength-inspiring aid that bore The hardy Byron to his native shore.</P>
<P>The following picture of his own distress, given by Byron in his simple and interesting Narrative, justifies the description in p. 10. After relating the barbarity of the Indian Cacique to his child, he proceeds thus:—"A day or two after, we put to sea again, and crossed the great bay I mentioned we had been at the bottom of, when we first hawled away to the westward. The land here was very low and sandy, and something like the mouth of a river which discharged itself into the sea, and which had
<PB N="72" REF="037087_0066_100C4922291F0210"/>
been taken no notice of by us before, as it was so shallow that the Indians were obliged to take every thing out of their canoes and carry it over land. We rowed up the river four or five leagues, and then took into a branch of it that ran first to the eastward and then to the northward: here it became much narrower, and the stream excessively rapid, so that we gained but little way, though we wrought very hard. At night we landed upon its banks, and had a most uncomfortable lodging, it being a perfect swamp; and we had nothing to cover us, though it rained excessively. The Indians were little better off than we, as there was no wood here to make their wigwams; so that all they could do was to prop up the bark, which they carry in the bottom of their canoes, and shelter themselves as well as they could to the leeward of it. Knowing the difficulties they had to encounter here, they had provided themselves with some seal; but we had not a morsel to eat, after the heavy fatigues of the day, excepting a sort of root we saw the Indians make use of, which was very disagreeable to the taste. We laboured all next day against the stream, and fared as we had done the day before. The next day brought us to the carrying place. Here was plenty of wood, but nothing to be got
<PB N="73" REF="037087_0067_100C492457879EE0"/>
for sustenance. We passed this night as we had frequently done under a tree; but what we suffered at this time is not easy to be expressed. I had been three days at the oar without any kind of nourishment except the wretched root above mentioned. I had no shirt, for it had rotted off by bits. All my clothes consisted, of a short grieko (something like a bear-skin), a piece of red cloth which had once been a waistcoat, and a ragged pair of trowsers, without shoes or stockings."</P>
<P>Note 2. A Briton and a friend.] Don Patricio Gedd, a Scotch physician in one of the Spanish settlements, hospitably relieved Byron and his wretched associates, of which the Commodore speaks in the warmest terms of gratitude.</P>
<P>Note 3. Or yield the Lyre of Heav'n another string.</P>

<P>Note 7. Wild Obi flies.] Among the negroes of the West Indies, Obi, or Obiah, is the name of a magical power, which is believed by them to affect the object of its malignity with dismal calamities Such a belief must undoubtedly have been deduced from the superstitious mythology of their kinsmen on the coast of Africa. I have therefore personified Obi as the evil spirit of the African, although the history of the African tribes mentions the evil spirit of their religious creed by a different appellation.</P>

<P>Note 9.—Presaging wrath to Poland—and to man!</P>
<P>"On the 10th of October 1794, a dreadful engagement took place between the Russians under General Fersen and the troops under Kosciusko. The Russians advanced twice to the attack, but were repulsed by the Poles, who however, unfortunately, not contented with the advantages they had gained, abandoned their favourable position on the heights, and pressed on to the attack in their turn. This movement threw the troops into some confusion; and the Russians, forming themselves anew, the route soon became general. The battle, which began at seven in the morning, did not end till noon. Kosciusko flew from rank to rank, and was continually in the hottest part of the engagement, in the course of which he had three horses killed under him. At length he fell; and a Cossack, who did not know him in the peasants dress, which he constantly wore, wounded him from behind with a lance. He recovered, and advanced a few steps,
<PB N="76" REF="037087_0070_100C492B1D547BE0"/>
but was again knocked down by another Cossack, who was preparing to give him a mortal blow, when his arm was stopped by a Russian officer, who is said to have been General Chronzazow, to whose wife Kosciusko had a short time before politely given leave of departure from Warsaw to join her husband. The unfortunate Kosciusko implored the officer, if he wished to render him a service, to allow the soldier to put an end to his existence; but the latter chose rather to make him a prisoner. The Polish infantry defended themselves with bravery proportioned to that of their general, and fought with a degree of valour almost approaching to fury.</P>
<P>The Russians under General Fersen soon afterwards summoned Warsaw to surrender; and on being refused, after the junction of the different corps under Fersen, Dernfeld, Denisow, and Suwarrow, they proceeded, on the 4th of November, to attack the suburb of Prague. In the mean time the generals Madalinski and Dambrowski threw themselves into Warsaw, and prepared for resistance. The suburb of Prague, separated from Warsaw by the Vistula, was defended by more than a hundred pieces of cannon, disposed upon thirty-three batteries. Little intimidated,
<PB N="77" REF="037087_0071_100C492D2843A9B8"/>
however, by so formidable a force, the ferocious Suwarrow commanded his soldiers to mount to the assault in the same manner they had done at Ismael, where the Russians entered by climbing over the dead and wounded bodies of their comrades, as well as of their enemies. His further orders were, that they should fight only with the sabre and bayonet. The Russians sprung to the charge with almost inconceivable impetuosity. They eagerly began to climb the works, and the six Russian columns, by singular good fortune, presented themselves at the same moment before the lines at Prague. Thus surrounded, the Polish generals found themselves unable to oppose, with 10,000 soldiers, which was the whole of their force, the united attack of 50,000 men; and, to add to their distress, the fire which they immediately commenced, from the darkness of the night, was so ill directed as to pass over the heads of the assailants. The cry raised by the successful columns penetrated to the entrenchments on the other side the Vistula, and added to the consternation of the Poles engaged with the other part of the Russian force; and they endeavoured to find safety by retiring into Warsaw, over a bridge. In their retreat they were met by another body of Russians, and a dreadful carnage ensued, in which a great part of the garrison of
<PB N="78" REF="037087_0072_100C492EACD71488"/>
Prague was miserably slaughtered. After a severe conflict of eight hours, the resistance on the part of the Poles ceased; but the massacre by the detestable Suwarrow, who, from his habitual cruelty, was selected for this service, continued for two hours longer; and the pillage lasted till noon on the following day. Five thousand Poles were computed to have been slain in the assault; the remainder were either imprisoned or dispersed. The citizens were compelled to lay down their arms, and their houses were plundered by the merciless Russians, who, after the battle had ceased nearly ten hours, about nine o'clock at night set fire to the town, and again began to massacre the inhabitants; nine thousand persons, unarmed men, defenceles women, and harmless infants, perished either in the flames or by the sword, and nearly the whole of the suburb was reduced to ashes. In the whole of this siege it is computed that not less than 30,000 of the Poles were inhumanly put to death. In this exigence, Count Potocki, the chief of the insurrection, proposed to treat with the Russians, and repaired to their head quarters with propositions of peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> name of the republic. He was received with extreme haughtiness by the infamous Suwarrow, who observed that the Empress was not at war with the republic; that his only object in coming

to Warsaw was to reduce the refractory subjects of Poland to obedience; and he intimated that he should not treat with any insurgent, but only with such as, invested with legitimate authority, should come to speak in the name, and on the part of his Polish majesty: Deputies were dispatched from the magistracy of Warsaw to the Russian commander, who returned, after having been constrained to surrender the city at discretion, under the single condition of securing to the citizens their lives and property. The general insolently observed, that there was another article which, without doubt, they had forgotten to ask, but which he would accede to them, which was <HI>pardon for the past.</HI></P>
<P>In consequence of this arrangement, the firing which had been kept up in the suburb of Prague ceased, and all the inhabitants were requested to surrender their arms. This was refused by the soldiers in the city, and their chief Wawrzecki, with many others of the supreme council, refused to take part in the capitulation. This impeded the close of the negociation; but the military, who refused to lay down their arms, were allowed to leave Warsaw, not however without a declaration from Suwarrow that they might be sure of not escaping, and that, when taken, no quarter would be granted. On the morning of the 7th, the supreme council,
<PB N="80" REF="037087_0074_100C4933467FF4A8"/>
with the generalissimo Wawrzecki, remitted into the hands of the king the authority they had exercised. On the 9th the Russian general made his triumphal entry into Warsaw, in which the streets were lined with his troops, and the inhabitants, shut up in their houses, observed a melancholy silence. The chief magistrate delivered him the keys at the bridge of Prague; after which he received the compliments of the king; and on the 10th, went with much pomp to the castle to pay his respects to his majesty. To complete the whole of this execrable scene, ostentatious and solemn blasphemy was called in; and the 1st of December was set apart for a day of solemn thanksgiving, and <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung for the triumph of powerful oppression over persecuted virtue, to the God of all mercies, whose altars had been stained by the blood of the innocent and helpless; and <Q>whose praises were chanted by the voice of murderers, amidst the shrieks and groans of the victims.</Q></P>

<P>"The impostor of Mecca had established, as one of the principles of his doctrine, the merit of extending it, either by persuasion, or the sword, to all parts of the earth. How steadily this injunction was adhered to by his followers, and with what success it was pursued, is well known to all who are in the least conversant in history.</P>
<P>"The same overwhelming torrent, which had inundated the greater part of Africa, burst its way into the very heart of Europe, and covered many kingdoms of Asia with unbounded desolation; directed its baleful course to the flourishing provinces of Hindostan. Here these fierce and hardy adventurers, whose only improvement had been in the science of destruction, who added the fury of fanaticism to the ravages of war, found the great end of their conquests opposed, by objects which neither the ardour of their persevering zeal, nor savage barbarity, could surmount. Multitudes were sacrificed by the cruel hand of religious persecution, and whole countries were deluged in blood, in the vain hope, that
<PB N="82" REF="037087_0076_100C4936E1159EA8"/>
by the destruction of a part, the remainder might be persuaded, or terrified into the profession of Mahomedism: but all these sanguinary efforts were ineffectual; and at length being fully convinced, that though they might extirpate, they could never hope to convert any number of the Hindoos, they relinquished the impracticable idea, with which they had entered upon their career of conquest, and contented themselves with the acquirement of the civil dominion and almost universal empire of Hindostan."</P>

<P>Note 13. While famish'd nations died along the shore.</P>
<P>The following account of British conduct, and its consequences in Bengal, will afford a sufficient idea of the fact alluded to in this passage. After describing the monopoly of salt, betel nut, and tobacco, the historian proceeds thus: "Money in this current came but by drops; it could not quench the thirst of those who
<PB N="83" REF="037087_0077_100C4938EDF4D8C8"/>
waited in India to receive it. An expedient, such as it was remained to quicken its pace. The natives could live with little salt, but could not want food. Some of the agents saw themselves well situated for collecting the rice into stores; they did so. They knew the Gentoos would rather die than violate the principles of their religion by eating flesh. The alternative would therefore be between giving what they had, or dying. The inhabitants sunk;— they that cultivated the land, and saw the harvest at the disposal of others, planted in doubt, scarcity ensued. Then the monopoly was easier managed—sickness ensued. In some districts the languid living left the bodies of their numerous dead unburied.</P>

<L>Cold on my heart the hand of terror lies;</L>
<L>And shades of horror close my languid eyes!—</L>

<L>Could B—k's soul so true to wrath remain?</L>

<L>Thy sleepless spirit, breathing from the tomb,</L>

<HEAD>THE WOUNDED HUSSAR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ALONE to the banks of the dark-rolling Danube</L>
<L>Fair Adelaide hied when the battle was o'er:</L>
<L>Oh whither, she cried, hast thou wander'd, my lover;</L>
<L>Or here dost thou welter, and bleed on the shore?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What voice have I heard? 'twas my Henry that sigh'd;</L>
<L N="6">All mournful she hasten'd, nor wander'd she far,</L>
<L>When bleeding, and low, on the heath she descried,</L>
<L>By the light of the moon, her poor wounded Hussar!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From his bosom that heav'd, the last torrent was streaming,</L>
<L N="10">And pale was his visage, deep mark'd with a scar;</L>
<L>And dim was that eye, once expressively beaming,</L>
<L>That melted in love, and that kindled in war!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="114" REF="037087_0103_100C496913675C88"/>
<L>How smit was fair Adelaide's heart at the sight!</L>
<L>How bitter she wept o'er the victim of war?</L>
<L>Hast thou come, my fond Love, this last sorrowful night,</L>
<L N="16">To cheer the lone heart of your wounded Hussar?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou shalt live, she replied, Heav'n's mercy relieving,</L>
<L>Each anguishing wound shall forbid me to mourn!</L>
<L>Ah, no! the last pang in my bosom is heaving;</L>
<L N="20">No light of the morn shall to Henry return!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou charmer of life, ever tender and true!</L>
<L>Ye babes of my love that await me afar!</L>
<L>His faultering tongue scarce could murmur adieu,</L>
<L>When he sunk in her arms—the poor wounded Hussar?</L>

<HEAD>GILDEROY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE last, the fatal hour is come</L>
<L>That bears my love from me;</L>
<L>I bear the dead note of the drum,</L>
<L>I mark the gallows tree!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bell has toll'd; it shakes my heart;</L>
<L>The trumpet speaks thy name;</L>
<L>And must my Gilderoy depart</L>
<L>To bear a death of shame!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No bosom trembles for thy doom;</L>
<L>No mourner wipes a tear;</L>
<L>The gallows' foot is all thy tomb,</L>
<L>The sledge is all thy bier!</L>

<L>Oh, Gilderoy! bethought we then</L>
<L>So soon, so sad, to part,</L>
<L N="15">When first in Roslin's lovely glen</L>
<L>You triumph'd o'er my heart!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your locks they glitter'd to the sheen,</L>
<L>Your hunter garb was trim;</L>
<L>And graceful was the ribbon green</L>
<L>That bound your manly limb!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! little thought I to deplore</L>
<L>These limbs in fetters bound;</L>
<L>Or hear, upon thy scaffold floor,</L>
<L>The midnight hammer sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="25">Ye cruel, cruel, that combin'd</L>
<L>The guiltless to pursue;</L>
<L>My Guilderoy was ever kind,</L>
<L>He could not injure you!</L>

<L>A long adieu! but where shall fly</L>

<LG>
<L>Yes! they will mock thy widow's tears,</L>
<L>And hate thine orphan boy:</L>
<L N="35">Alas! his infant beauty wears</L>
<L>The form of Gilderoy!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then will I seek the dreary mound,</L>
<L>Where sleeps thy mouldering clay;</L>
<L>And weep and linger on the ground,</L>
<L N="40">And sigh my heart away!</L>

<HEAD>THE HARPER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ON the green banks of Shannon, when Sheelah was nigh,</L>
<L>No blithe Irish lad was so happy as I;</L>
<L>No harp like my own could so cheerily play,</L>
<L>And wherever I went, was my poor dog Tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="5">When at last I was forc'd from my Sheelah to part,</L>
<L>She said (while the sorrow was big at her heart),</L>
<L>Oh! remember your Sheelah when far far away;</L>
<L>And be kind, my dear Pat, to our poor dog Tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor dog! he was faithful and kind to be sure,</L>
<L N="10">And he constantly lov'd me although I was poor;</L>
<L>When the sour-looking folks sent me heartless away,</L>
<L>I had always a friend in my poor dog Tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="120" REF="037087_0108_100C497355DA7F68"/>
<L>When the road was so dark, and the night was so cold,</L>
<L>And Pat and his dog were grown weary and old,</L>
<L N="15">How snugly we slept in my old coat of grey,</L>
<L>And he lick'd me for kindness—my poor dog Tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though my wallet was scant, I remember'd his case,</L>
<L>Nor refus'd my last crust to his pitiful face;</L>
<L>But he died at my feet on a cold winter day,</L>
<L N="20">And I play'd a sad lament for my poor dog Tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where now shall I go, poor, forsaken and blind?</L>
<L>Can I find one to guide me, so faithful and kind,</L>
<L>To my sweet native village, so far, far away?</L>
<L>I can never more return with my poor dog Tray.</L>
