<P>THIS fatal, Soul-destroying, GOD-dishonouring disease, first made its appearance in the garden of Eden. It was introduced by that infernal foe to GOD and man, called the devil, the means by which the first man came by his death, and that monster sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God and the destruction of man. Satan succeeding so well by means of this disease in the garden of Eden, has, from time to time, attempted to spread the dis∣order in various parts of our earth, by sending his emissaries with the infection, bound up in a bundle of articles called by them Gospel Truths: but the truth is, they are Antinomian heresies, poisonous in their nature, and pernicious to the souls of men. The enemy having lately sent from the east a bundle of his wares to this city, I thought it my duty to alarm my fellow-citizens of the danger they are in—the plague having actually broken out,—some are already dead, and others in im∣minent danger. In order, therefore, to preserve the sound from the infection, I shall shew some causes of the disorder, with the means of preventing it from becoming fatal; secondly, the symptoms attending the disorder, and lastly, prescribe the remedy for such in
<PB N="2" REF="045169_0002_101FC1A7C36147B8"/>whom the disorder is not rooted—I say in whom the disorder is not rooted; for in all others, it is probable, means will prove ineffectual, as the Scriptures say, God shall send them strong delusion, that they should be∣lieve a lie, &amp;c. 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> ii. 11.</P>
<P>First, the Causes. This disorder is generally pro∣duced by an unwholesome stagnated, putrid air, pro∣ceeding from the mouth of the deceivers, foretold by that most eminent physician of infinite value, JEHO∣VAH JESUS, (who told his disciples there should arise false prophets, who, if it were possible, would deceive even the elect.) Hence it prevails in a furnace, situate in Second between Walnut and Chesnut-streets, Phila∣delphia, also in the north eastern parts of these states.</P>
<P N="2">2d Cause. The perversion of the word of God by men, or rather preachers, of corrupt minds, whose god is their belly, whose glory is their shame, and whose damnnation slumbereth not.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The dead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unsound professors taint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>Self-confident persons are much in danger of being infected, and those of an effeminate weakly habit, in a spiritual sense; but especially those good sort of peo∣ple who pretend to more charity than is commanded in the Scriptures, are in imminent danger.</P>
<P>Advice to the sound—Come not within scent of the smoke of the furnace. Keep no company with infected persons except duty calls. Endeavor to keep your minds clean and clear of Antinomian notions; for cleanliness is greatly conducive to health, and to prevent disorders. Exercise also is an excellent antidote; therefore, be much in prayer, and reading your Bible, walking in the good old way of JEHOVAH'S commandments daily and hourly.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS. The Murrinitish plague is generally preceded by a remarkable weakness in the understand∣ing, respecting the plain, simple truths of the Scrip∣tures;
<PB N="3" REF="045169_0003_101FC1AAAFB8B490"/>as appeared evidently in the case of Eve, when, for SURELY, she takes LEST.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Dimness of sight precedes this fatal disorder. The infected cannot see, throughout the sacred volume, one text (among the many hundreds) that speaks against their beloved system.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The head of the infected swells amazingly; yea to an enormous size, so that with truth it may be said, (according to their conceit of their knowledge) that a boy of three days old has a bigger head than either that of Gog or Magog, which stands in Guildhall, London, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The tongue also of the infected appears as if it was tipt with silver; and, being smooth as oil, runs at an amazing rate, but presently grows prodigious thick, and speaks great swelling words of vanity, crying,— Peace, Peace, where there is no peace; rejoicing that they are sufficiently wise to prove, that the primeval cause of sin will at last be found to lay at the threshold of Heaven; and consequently, that the whole race of fallen men must be redeemed upon the principles of unsullied goodness. This is a fatal symptom, and is a certain sign, that the person is given up to strong delusion.</P>
<P N="5">5th. A delirium comes on, which ends in mad∣ness, and operates in the following manner—The in∣fected, like another mad dog, runs howling about, trying to bite every one he comes across, foaming at the mouth amazingly; they don't act like the prophets dumb dogs, that cannot bark. No—quite the reverse: they yelp and howl in a tremendous manner, disturbing whole neighbourhoods, and grieving the favorites of Heaven—As saith the Lord, With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life, <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> xiii. 22. Frequent vomitings suc∣ceed their madness. I am not physician enough to say it is the bile; but it is certainly bitterness that they throw up in abundance: yet they have so far lost their
<PB N="4" REF="045169_0004_101FC1B0AC78DB70"/>taste, as to conceit that this gall of theirs is sweet gos∣pel truth. They roll the diabolic preparation as a sweet morsel under their tongue. Woe unto their souls, for they have sinned; they call evil good, and good evil; bitter sweet, and sweet bitter. Horrid madness! At length they become gospel proof, as ap∣pears: for if in pity to their souls, the servant of Ema∣nuel, "knowing the terror of the Lord, persuade" them of the necessity of a new or second birth, (like poor mad things indeed) they cry Christ was born again. Or if we preach and teach the necessity of re∣pentance and faith, they madly answer, Christ repented, Christ believed, &amp;c. "O foolish people, and unwise! thus to wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction;" but the Scriptures must be fulfilled. For saith the com∣passionate Saviour, Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. No wonder that modern orators and rhetoricians are puz∣zled at plain gospel truths, when of old they were to the learned Jews a stumbling block, and to the wise Greeks foolishness. But as the elect cannot be de∣ceived, seeing the foundation standeth sure, we will rejoice, though the world be moved out of its place.</P>
<P>The Murrinitish plague may be distinguished from the Winchestrian: inasmuch as the Murrinites falla∣ciously profess Calvinism, and the Winchestrians Arme∣nianism: again, the Murrinites profess enmity to the devil, the Winchestrians great friendship—though it is a query, whether he (the devil) used them one bit the better for that.</P>
<P>Winchestrian plagues may be converted into Murri∣nitish, by the party coming too nigh the smoke of the furnace, when well heated. The duration of the Mur∣rinitish plague is extremely uncertain. I have heard of one of the infected being extremely ill for several years, and in his mad fit bit several, and grievously infected them; but toward the close of his life, 'tis said he was
<PB N="5" REF="045169_0005_101FC1B244A88910"/>perfectly cured. Some, it is to be feared, remain confirmed maniacs, 'till such time as the flames of the tremendous volcano feelingly convince them, and bring them to their senses to their eternal sorrow. The most favourable symptom is a mild sweat, coming on in a few days, occasioned by fears arising in the mind, lest the whole system should be fallacious, and they fall with their bottomless superstructure into that place, where <HI>hope</HI> never comes; this, I say, is a symptom that the disorder is not rooted. In such case there is ground to hope, and it is rational to use proper means for their recovery; but if they foam at the mouth, and endea∣vour to bite, and infect others, or if they rave exceed∣ingly, when the water of that stream, that makes glad the city of God, is offered to them—I say, if they maliciously try to spill the water, and endeavour to bite the person offering it to them, 'tis a fatal symptom that death is approaching. In such cases there is no phy∣sician in this country can do them good, though there are several very eminent, as Mr. Baptist, Mr. Presby∣terian, Mr. Episcopalian, Mr. Independent, Mr. White∣fieldian, &amp;c. &amp;c. These are very skilful men, and have all studied, and practised with great success under the physician of infinite value. But I say, though they may be able to prescribe the antidote, yet it will not avail, unless applied by the skilful hand of the famous, divinely glorious, ineffable physician, JESUS CHRIST; and consequently can do them no good. But, as in some cases, good may be done, I proceed.</P>
<P>Regimen. In the management of this disorder we ought to endeavour to counteract the putrid tendency of the humours, by geatly promoting perspiration, that is, if possible, to bring on a warm sweat, produced from the consideration afore-mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It has been observed, that the Murrinitish plague is generally occasioned by unwholesome air, and of course it must be greatly aggrevated by it; care must
<PB N="6" REF="045169_0006_101FC1B6D36681C8"/>therefore be taken, that no Murrinitish bellows be al∣lowed in the mad person's chamber; also I advise, that no infected person be left alone with the diseased, lest in his mad fits he shut to the door, and blow the Mur∣rinitish bellows, and the putrid air stagnate, which will greatly increase the malady; but rather let there be a frequent admission of fresh and wholesome air conveyed by the means of a servant of the <HI>sanctuary, blowing through the genuine silver trumpet of uncorrupted truth.</HI> The pa∣tient's head ought to be frequently sprinkled with the ashes of Sodom and Gomorrah, if they can be obtained, and his mind with ideas of everlasting fire; also pictures of the damned ought to be placed round the room, and every strong scented herb that can be got from Sinai's mount, laid in different parts of the house, and smelled to by those that go near the patient. A small quantity of Jeremiah's wormwood and gall ought frequently to be injected into his mind: this is a great astringent, and should be mixed in all his food as well as drink. The patient must have his head kept moderately cool, and as free as possible from Antinomian notions. His food must be light, such as the milk of the word, and not strong meat, for he will not be able to bear it: he may eat roasted apples, provided they be taken from the apple tree of the gospel; and as to his drink, I would recommend the juice of this excellent fruit above all others.</P>
<P>Lastly, Medicine. A vomit is absolutely necessary in the beginning of the disorder; however, I would not recommend a dose of Tartar emetic, but rather take three scruples of right reason, one grain of consideration, and a quarter of an ounce of common sense, make them into a bolus, and force him to swallow it, if pos∣sible, (though depend upon it, it will go much against him; and I dare venture to say, if it can be got down, it will presently make him cast the bile, or rather the diabolic bitterness from his stomach. As to blistering, I would by no means recommend it; for if the patient
<PB N="7" REF="045169_0007_101FC1B85A684100"/>comes to his senses, he will be sufficiently sore, espe∣cially when he reflects on the great dishonour he has done to religion. But the only sovereign remedy is in the chief physician's hands, and solely at his disposal; the least grain of which, yea, if divided into ten thou∣sand parts, and one of those parts divided into ten thousand more, ad infinitum,—I say, if the smallest of these parts be received into the patient's heart, it will not fail of making a perfect cure. This medi∣cine is given gratis to all who ask for it, by the propri∣etor, at the sign of the Fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness. But as it is likely the patient will be deterred from making application, by reason of a vain conceit, that he already possesses a sufficient quantity, which the disease naturally inclines him to)—It will therefore evidence a generous mind in those, who are still preserved from the pernicious infection, to make application to the good physician on his behalf; and who knows but he may send by their hand, and make them instrumental in delivering their perishing fellow∣mortal from that which is infinitely worse than the plagues of Egypt,—the Murrinitish system of satanical divinity.</P>
<P>Perhaps some may ask, why so satirical? I answer, because Solomon hath said, Answer a fool according to his folly; and as it is evident these unhappy people have done with both scripture and reason, as appears by their treating, with the greatest contempt, the most solid, convincing arguments made use of by very able ministers of the New Testament,—I therefore thought it best for me to follow Elijah's example; and, in this mode, bear testimony against this pernicious <HI>error</HI> of the day. I expect to be censured by the Universal Antinomians, as they are a people possessed of a more than ordinary degree of charity, and sometimes take an odd way to shew their love; but I defy them to use me worse than their system doth my master <HI>Jesus.</HI> For, brethren, be not deceived; God is not mocked: what
<PB N="8" REF="045169_0008_101FC1BB35A9B390"/>a man sows, that shall he also reap. There is a day—a dreadful day—coming, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud <HI>(boasters)</HI> and all they that wickedly depart from the truth, shall be as stubble, yea as fuel, on which that eternal fire will most surely kindle, and which will <HI>never, never, never</HI> be extinguished.</P>
<P>It is, then, the infinitely blessed, the greatly injured, the awfully belied majesty of Heaven, will prove to the overlasting shame of every enemy of truth, that his throne is established in justice and judgment—Then the besotted <HI>Antinomian</HI> will be feelingly convinced, that his damnation lies at his own door, and that the <HI>Lord</HI> tempteth no man to sin, much less forceth angels nor man, by an irrevocable decree, to do that which his holy foul hateth. <HI>James</HI> i. xiii, xiv. Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Horrid thought! to think or say, that God is the author of sin!</P>
<P>Oh! my soul come not near their dwelling! Lord; what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; half <HI>beast,</HI> half <HI>devil;</HI> but he might with propriety have said, that the <HI>natural</HI> man is <HI>whole devil,</HI> and spoke within the bounds of charity too. But I forbear.—<HI>God is judge</HI> himself, and will take <HI>vengeance</HI> on his enemies, and cut off those in due time, that trouble his church. <HI>But the ransomed of the Lord shall he saved with an everlasting salvation, to the praiso of his glorious grace, world without end.</HI> Amen.</P>
