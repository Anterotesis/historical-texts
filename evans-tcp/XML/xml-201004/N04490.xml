<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid and Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Here present you with a little Treatise, which I must expect will make the World angry with me, because it is contrary to the World's Religion</P>
<P>I am sensible I ought rather to die, than, for my <HI>own Will,</HI> to get the Displeasure of the meanest Person in the World: And Satan sometimes tells me, <HI>he</HI> can put me in to a fine Way, whereby I may do God much Service, and yet keep in with the World, sleep in a whole Skin, and go to Heaven in a Feather-bed. His Way which he would have me take, is to keep a <HI>Medium</HI> between those who have <HI>no Zeal,</HI> and those who are <HI>zealous:</HI> And when he hath flatter'd away my <HI>Zeal for the Lord of Hosts,</HI> he persuades me, (as he doth <HI>some</HI> others) that I have made a <HI>great Progress</HI> in Religion, and have <HI>now</HI> the <HI>Meekness and Gentleness of Christ:</HI> As if the <HI>Lion</HI> and the <HI>Lamb,</HI> could not <HI>lie down together</HI> in the same Soul.</P>
<P>But no sooner doth God give me to look into Eternity, and to realize, that the Things of this little World are not to be desired to make one happy; but I see that this <HI>sweet</HI> Reli∣gion (as the World calls it, and which never <HI>poysons</HI> a Man's Soul, but when the World is <HI>sweet</HI> to him) is only <HI>Satan trans∣form'd into an Angel of Light;</HI> the <HI>cloven Foot</HI> appears quite plain: And I can say, from the Bottom of my Heart, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan; thou art an Offence unto me;</HI> thou <HI>sa∣vourest not the Things that be of God,</HI> but the Things that be <HI>of Men.</HI> Nay, I had rather be exercis'd with Pain, Sickness, Poverty, Reproach, and all other Evils God sees to be <HI>wholesom</HI> for me, than have my Soul languish under that <HI>fashionable</HI> Distemper.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005568_0003_10186A5DC5601170"/>
For then, the worldly Mist being remov'd, I see plainly that the World hates Christ's Religion <HI>now,</HI> as mortally, as it ever hated <HI>him;</HI> that (as <HI>Luther</HI> saith) <Q>'tis not the Gospel Men preach, if it is preach'd in Peace; and that whosoever will be a faithful Preacher of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, <HI>must</HI> (as <HI>he</HI> hath foretold) have the World for an Enemy, and live in the Wars all the Days of his Life.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, did I call that preaching the Gospel, which com∣monly passeth for it, viz. Ministers telling poor Sinners they must believe Jesus Christ to <HI>be an all sufficient Saviour of Sinners in general, but not their Saviour in particular;</HI> I should be of another Sentiment: For the World doth not <HI>hate,</HI> but <HI>love</HI> this Religion; 'tis the Religion of <HI>Nature;</HI> at least <HI>Nature</HI> is not puzzled with it; all the Ministers Hearers have got <HI>something</HI> of it already; or, however it appears an easy Thing to get <HI>dark</HI> Religion at any Time: So that Ministers will be more likely to be <HI>deify'd</HI> than <HI>persecuted</HI> by the World for preached <HI>this</HI> Gospel.</P>
<P>But inasmuch as <HI>I have not so learned Christ;</HI> inasmuch as I believe <HI>this</HI> to be <HI>another Gospel;</HI> it is most clear to me that those who <HI>plainly</HI> and <HI>powerfully</HI> preach down <HI>this</HI> Faith, so agreeable to Nature, and in lieu of it preach that (as holy <HI>Tin∣dall</HI> expresseth it) "every Sinner must believe Jesus Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour and <HI>his</HI> Redeemer, will meet with Persecution, in some Degree, and that not only from the prophane and de∣bauch'd Part of the World, but also and especially from many moral Persons without Grace: (For the <HI>Pharisees</HI> were the worst Enemies Christ had) and it may be, sometimes from tru∣ly gracious Persons, who have been enticed over into the En∣emy's Camp. The World's Enmity against <HI>this</HI> Gospel, a∣gainst <HI>this</HI> Faith, springs directly from its Enmity against the Lord Jesus Christ: For the World hath such an <HI>high</HI> Opinion of its <HI>own</HI> Righteousness, and such a <HI>mean</HI> Opinion of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Righteousness, that it will not bear <HI>Man</HI> to be so much <HI>deba∣sed,</HI> and Christ to be so much <HI>exalted,</HI> as that a poor Sinner, who knows he deserves to be sent to Hell, should <HI>this Moment</HI> believe that God for Christ's Sake <HI>doth</HI> forgive <HI>his</HI> Sins, and that Christ and all his Benefits belong to <HI>him</HI> notwithstanding all his Vileness. This is the <HI>Root of Bitterness;</HI> Hence it is that the Doctrine of a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith is so <HI>run down,</HI> because it <HI>exalts</HI> the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> because it makes
<PB N="5" REF="005568_0004_10186A60251CA028"/><HI>Man</HI> and <HI>his</HI> Righteousness to be <HI>nothing,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>his</HI> Righteousness to be <HI>all in all;</HI> it not being such Divinity as can be well digested, by those who have never seen the <HI>Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ,</HI> or, if they have seen it, are <HI>now</HI> groping <HI>in the Dark,</HI> and <HI>seeking to be justified as it were, by the Works of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>This is the View in which the Thing appears to me: In Proportion therefore, as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> appears to me to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, my <HI>Heart always burns within me,</HI> with Zeal against <HI>that</HI> Religion which makes him a <HI>little</HI> Saviour. Nay, some∣times when I ascribe <HI>Glory to the Lamb</HI> in my Heart, and <HI>lift him up</HI> in my very Soul, it seems that if I had as many Lives as Hairs on my Head, I could willingly and chearfully part with them all, rather than <HI>come into their Secret,</HI> who are for banishing a <HI>particular</HI> Faith out of the World, and thereby <HI>pulling down</HI> the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>trampling</HI> him under their Feet.</P>
<P>And, 'tis because <HI>God who is rich in Mercy, for the great Love wherewith he loved me, when I was dead in Trespasses and in Sins,</HI> hath <HI>quickned</HI> me by making me to know that Christ is <HI>mighty to save,</HI> that I have undertaken, and, at Length fi∣nished the ensuing Treatise; the great Design of which (<HI>he</HI> knows) is to speak a good Word for the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and to set the Crown upon <HI>his</HI> Head, when so many are going Traiterously to rob him of it, and to place it upon the Head of <HI>Rebellious Man.</HI></P>
<P>And as I know that <HI>Jealousy</HI> for the Honour of <HI>Zion's King,</HI> hath made me <HI>bold in my God,</HI> to draw my Pen in <HI>his</HI> Cause, and to maintain <HI>his</HI> Right, notwithstanding a great <HI>Host</HI> of <HI>Terrors</HI> that were set <HI>in Array</HI> against me; so I am persuaded, <HI>my God who stood by me, and strengthened me</HI> to go through the Work, will bless it now it is done, to the <HI>praise of the Glory of his Grace:</HI> Nay, I <HI>can't</HI> doubt but it will redound more to his Glory than any Work I have been enabled to do <HI>by</HI> him, and <HI>for</HI> him, ever since I <HI>knew the Grace of God in Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Here, I expect it will be said by <HI>some,</HI> <Q>For <HI>their</HI> parts, <HI>they</HI> think I have been writing a Book that confutes <HI>no body;</HI> since all the Ministers they can find agree with me, that a <HI>meer General</HI> Faith is good for <HI>nothing,</HI> and that Believers should have a particular Application of the Blood of Christ to their <HI>own</HI> Souls.</Q> I answer; Ministers may agree to∣gether
<PB N="6" REF="005568_0005_10186A61F505CE88"/>in saying <HI>all this,</HI> and yet be no nearer together in the Matter of <HI>Justifying</HI> Faith than <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, Dr. <HI>Perkins</HI> observes, that both <Q><HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> agree together in holding that Believers should have a <HI>particular</HI> Application of the Blood of Christ unto their <HI>own</HI> Souls: and yet, (saith he) the Agreement is only <HI>in Words:</HI> For <HI>we</HI> hold a <HI>particular</HI> Application <HI>by Faith; they</HI> only <HI>by Hope</HI> and <HI>Conjecture.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Just so it is with many Ministers at this Day: all the Ap∣plication <HI>they</HI> hold is only <HI>by Hope</HI> and <HI>Conjecture:</HI> they teach that when Men see the Fruits of Faith in themselves, good Frames, and good Duties, <HI>they</HI> should thereby <HI>humbly hope</HI> and <HI>conjecture</HI> they have an Interest in the Blood of Christ; but they will not allow that one who is now an Hell-deserving Sin∣ner, should <HI>directly, immediately, before</HI> he sees any good Thing in himself, believe that the <HI>Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth him from all his Sins.</HI> In order to satisfy my self, whether these Men really held a <HI>particular Faith,</HI> notwithstanding all their Talk <HI>for a particular Application,</HI> I have often asked them, what was the first Thing a Man believes about Christ, when he be∣lieves <HI>to Salvation?</HI> Whether he believes that <HI>he himself hath</HI> (not <HI>may</HI> have <HI>for</HI> accepting, or, <HI>if</HI> he will accept upon Gos∣pel-Terms, as the Phrase is, but actually <HI>hath now) Redemp∣tion through his Blood,</HI> even <HI>the Forgiveness of Sins, according to the Riches of God's Grace?</HI> And whether he will not have <HI>as much</HI> Assurance of the Forgiveness of <HI>his</HI> Sins, as he hath Faith? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It having been reported that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> held a <HI>general</HI> Faith, inas∣much as he had said, in a Sermon, that <HI>Assurance was not of the Essence of saving Faith;</HI> after I had found, that all he meant was, that <HI>Assu∣rance</HI> was not <HI>so necessary,</HI> but that a Man might be a <HI>true Believer,</HI> tho' he should be <HI>now</HI> in <HI>the dark,</HI> or even <HI>die in the dark</HI> about his State: (which Thing I also held) I ask'd him whether a Man hath not <HI>as much Assurance</HI> as he hath <HI>Faith:</HI> To which he reply'd, Yes, Yes. I heard him preach <HI>eight</HI> Sermons, and discours'd with him I believe more than <HI>eight</HI> Times upon the Subject; and by all he appear'd to me, to speak out <HI>Shibbo∣leth</HI> without any Hesitation. I could never believe that <HI>he</HI> denied a <HI>parti∣cular</HI> Faith, were it only for <HI>this;</HI> that <HI>he knows</HI> that <HI>he is of God;</HI> there being an <HI>heavenly Necessity</HI> laid upon all such Persons to be Friends to <HI>that</HI> Faith. Accordingly, it may be observed to the Honour of a <HI>parti∣cular</HI> Faith, that of all the Men in the World who are Enemies to it, whether <HI>Protestants,</HI> or <HI>Papists</HI> (for the great <HI>embattell'd</HI> Army who are now against it, is a <HI>confederate</HI> Army made up of <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Papists,</HI> especially the <HI>latter;</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> himself being <HI>Generalissimo</HI> of the Host) there is not one single Person who knows that <HI>he is of God.</HI> For, who∣ever <HI>knows</HI> that <HI>he</HI> is of God, <HI>can know</HI> it only by a <HI>particular</HI> Faith: And such an one had rather be burnt to Ashes, than be against <HI>that</HI> Faith <HI>by which</HI> he <HI>knows</HI> himself to be <HI>of God.</HI></NOTE> And being try'd <HI>this Way,</HI> they are found <HI>wanting,</HI> and can say nothing but <HI>Sibboleth, Sibboleth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005568_0006_10186A65369484D8"/>
I freely own I have had great Fears, lest <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Libertines</HI> who are always too plenty, and who shew them∣selves after a Day of <HI>great Grace,</HI> should like <HI>vile Spiders</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Erskine</HI> calls them) suck Poison out of the <HI>Flower of the Gospel,</HI> and pervert what I have written to their <HI>own Destructi∣on.</HI> But this I know, the Doctrine I advance is <HI>essentially</HI> dif∣ferent from <HI>their's:</HI> (Tho' <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> were tho't <HI>Antinomians</HI> for holding it: perhaps never any one preached <HI>pure Gospel</HI> without being <HI>honour'd</HI> with the <HI>re∣proachful</HI> Name of an <HI>Antinomian:</HI>) For <HI>their</HI> Faith is a Man's believing that he <HI>hath been</HI> forgiven, and <HI>was actually</HI> in a <HI>State</HI> of Favour with God, <HI>before</HI> Faith; whereas according to <HI>our</HI> Faith, a Man doth not (to use <HI>Wendeline</HI>'s Words) <Q>believe that his Sins <HI>are</HI> forgiven him already, before the Act of be∣lieving; but that he shall have <HI>Forgiveness of Sins:</HI> In the <HI>very Act</HI> of Justification he believes his Sins <HI>are</HI> forgiven him, and <HI>so</HI> receives <HI>Forgiveness.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Besides, The <HI>Antinomians</HI> don't hold it material, that there should be a Work of <HI>Conviction before,</HI> and a Work of <HI>Sanc∣tification</HI> after Faith; whereas <HI>we</HI> maintain that no Man can <HI>truly</HI> believe <HI>his</HI> Sins are <HI>freely</HI> forgiven, till he sees himself <HI>slain by the Law;</HI> and that whosoever believes that he is <HI>clean∣sed</HI> in the <HI>Blood of Christ,</HI> will be <HI>constrained</HI> by the <HI>Love of Christ</HI> to <HI>cleanse himself from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and to perfect Holiness in the Fear of God:</HI> So that if <HI>our</HI> Faith is guarded (as it <HI>always</HI> should be) with a Work of <HI>Convicti∣on before,</HI> and Work of <HI>Sanctification behind, Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Libertines</HI> have nothing to do with it; instead of speaking Comfort to <HI>such,</HI> it condemns them all to the Flames of Hell.</P>
<P>There is also one Thing more, which hath been Matter of much Concern to me, viz. An Apprehension lest those who are <HI>Antiministerial,</HI> and of a <HI>separating Spirit,</HI> should get any Advantage by my Writings, and strengthen themselves in a <HI>Way that is not good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005568_0007_10186A67E6126A08"/>
For my Part, thro' Grace, I have an universal Love towards Ministers; (more especially those who appear to have been inflamed with the Love of Christ, <HI>whoever</HI> they be, <HI>wherever</HI> they be, and <HI>however,</HI> in lesser Matters, opposite to me) and have felt my Heart wishing them well, and praying for them, even those who are <HI>most</HI> against me, a great Part of the Time that I have been writing this Book. But though I <HI>wish well to</HI> all, I don't <HI>think well of</HI> all: On the contrary, I make no Doubt but the Colleges pour forth Swarms of young Men, who have spent their Days in divers Lusts and Vanities, and have never had an <HI>effectual Law-work,</HI> so that the <HI>Light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ</HI> hath <HI>shined</HI> into their Souls: And these unhappy Men (God pity them; my Heart almost bleeds for them; such an one was I) come forth to <HI>serve</HI> the Churches (but really to <HI>serve themselves</HI>) and after a Life spent in Pleasure, Pomp, and Worldlimindedness, they <HI>go down to the Dead,</HI> and to the <HI>Damned,</HI> and their People with them.— And 'tis observing too many of this Sort of Ministers (for one must be <HI>spiritually blind,</HI> and very much <HI>like</HI> them, not to find a Plenty of them in Town and Country) which Satan makes Use of, to prejudice some Persons against a learned Mi∣nistry, causing them to separate from them, and to be Ministers themselves, or at least to <HI>heap up Teachers to themselves,</HI> some of whom had <HI>need be taught what are the first Principles of the Oracles of God: esteeming them highly for their Ignorance Sake,</HI> as if what came from the Mouths of <HI>such</HI> Men, must needs come <HI>immediately</HI> from the <HI>Spirit of God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would not be understood by this Paragraph, to speak against the preaching of <HI>all</HI> those who are without <HI>Academical</HI> Learning; nor yet as if I was against <HI>all</HI> Separations. As for those who appear to be no Enemies to Learning, but Men of Knowledge, and of a sound Mind, and especially to be <HI>full of Faith and of the Holy Ghost!</HI> I would as soon encourage their Preaching, as if they had commene'd <HI>Doctors</HI> in <HI>Divinity.</HI>— Nor dare I be against <HI>all Separations:</HI> For to be against <HI>all Separations</HI> is to be <HI>against all Reformations;</HI> and yet I make no Question but a <HI>separating Spirit</HI> is an <HI>Antichristian Spirit.</HI> 'Tis this, which hath made little <HI>Brotherhoods</HI> and <HI>Sisterhoods</HI> of about five or six in Number: And the same Principle will probably make their Numbers <HI>still less.</HI> For my Part I would bear with a great Deal in a Church, and in a Minister before I would separate: a little of the <HI>Lan∣guage of Ashdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which good Ministers sometimes speak, join'd with a great Deal of the <HI>Language of Canaan,</HI> would not drive me away. And inasmuch as the World calls me a Promoter of Separations (as well as thinks me to be a Friend to many Errors, which I have always been against. I shall take this Opportunity to <HI>answer for my self,</HI> and to plead <HI>not guil∣ty.</HI> I don't <HI>preach</HI> one Word about <HI>Separations,</HI> nor advise any to sepa∣rate <HI>in private:</HI> But this one Thing I do; I preach the <HI>glorious Gospel</HI> at <HI>home</HI> and <HI>abroad</HI> to as many as are dispos'd to hear me; though not before the Consent of the Ministers is asked. If they will allow me to preach to those People who desire to hear me; then, (to my rejoycing) the Gospel is preached <HI>without Strife,</HI> or Appearance of <HI>Contention:</HI> But if they forbid my Preaching because I preach that a poor Sinner in Order to his being justified, must believe that God for Christ's Sake <HI>doth</HI> forgive all his Sins (which is sometimes the Case) I preach <HI>notwithstanding.</HI> All Men of Reading, know this to <HI>be</HI> the <HI>Protestant</HI> Faith: And preaching the <HI>true Protestant</HI> Faith, will be likely to strengthen the Hands of <HI>true Pro∣testants.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005568_0008_10186A6A787CC8F0"/>
I can <HI>truly</HI> say (my Conscience bearing me witness) I have been so far from aiming to do those Men a Pleasure, and to nourish in them a Prejudice against a <HI>standing learned</HI> Ministry, which is always joyned with a <HI>separating Spirit;</HI> that <HI>for their Sakes,</HI> I have sometimes trembled at the Thoughts of letting this Performance ever see the Light.</P>
<P>However, though in a discouraged Frame, I have been a∣fraid of making it publick; so Satan sometimes makes me al∣most afraid to sound forth <HI>free Grace,</HI> and the <HI>Glad Tidings of Salvation,</HI> lest some should turn the Grace of God into Wan∣tonness) yet when I have truly considered the Matter, I have been fully convinced, that <HI>Light</HI> never did any Harm to the World, and that there could be <HI>no Danger</HI> in leaving <HI>God's Truth with God.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly I now leave the Work with him, praying that it may be his Blessing, accomplish the Good Design which <HI>he knows</HI> I had in undertaking it, and now have in sending it abroad into the World, viz. the exalting of Jesus Christ in the Hearts and Souls of Men.</P>
<P>Oh that what I have written upon free Grace, may cause the Reader's <HI>Heart to burn within him,</HI> and <HI>constrain</HI> him to sing <HI>Glory to the Lamb that was slain!</HI> Amen and Amen!</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I Have oftentimes wonder'd, and believe I shall continue wondring as long as I live, how it should come to pass, that in <HI>so Protestant</HI> a Country as <HI>this,</HI> it should be a Dis∣grace to any Man to be a <HI>true Protestant.</HI></P>
<P>One must be a Stranger to the State of Religion in <HI>New-England,</HI> not to know that a <HI>general</HI> Faith is in Vogue, not only among <HI>Arminians,</HI> but among <HI>Calvinists</HI> also, especially of the Clergy; and that those who maintain a <HI>particular</HI> Faith, are look'd upon to be <HI>Enthasiasts</HI> and <HI>Antinomians</HI> &amp;c. And yet these few <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasts falsly so called,</HI> are the only <HI>thorough Protestants</HI> in the Land: All the rest, whosoever they be, do <HI>so far</HI> turn their Backs upon the <HI>Pro∣testants,</HI> and <HI>say a Confederacy</HI> with the <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Erskine</HI> in a Sermon lately come among us, warns his Hearers against a <HI>general</HI> Faith, as what was renounced by their Forefathers as a <HI>BRANCH</HI> of <HI>POPERY.</HI> He refers to these Words in their <HI>national Covenant;</HI> <Q>We detest and refuse the usurped Authority of that <HI>Roman Antichrist</HI>—His <HI>general</HI> and <HI>doubtsome</HI> Faith.</Q></P>
<P>Nay, the Meridian Sun never was plainer to one tolerably acquainted with ecclesiastical History, than that <HI>this</HI> Faith is the Faith of <HI>Papists,</HI> and that a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith is the Faith of <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>That sanguine and undaunted Christian Hero, <HI>Luther,</HI> is well known to have been the first in the Reformation, who gave a Blow to that <HI>Man of Sin</HI> the Pope of <HI>Rome:</HI> And 'tis as well known to those who have read his Works, that the chief Blow which is gave him, and which set him a reeling, was by preaching down that <HI>general dark</HI> Faith, which <HI>then</HI> was, and <HI>now</HI> is held <HI>so sacred,</HI> and by preaching up a <HI>parti∣cular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith in the Room of it.</P>
<P><HI>Calvin</HI> also his Brother in the Reformation <HI>(par nobile fra∣trum!)</HI> might be supposed to be <HI>like-minded</HI> meerly from his being a Reformer; for otherwise, instead of preaching People <HI>from Rome,</HI> he would have preach'd them to <HI>Rome</HI> again;
<PB N="11" REF="005568_0010_10186A6E29B34B00"/>but, besides he hath expresly over and over declared his Mind in his <HI>Institutions.</HI> <Q>We shall have a perfect Definition of Faith (saith he) if we say that it is a stedfast and <HI>assured Knowledge</HI> of God's Kindness towards <HI>US,</HI> which being grounded upon the Truth of the Promise in Christ, is both revealed to our Minds, and sealed in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>III.</HI> Vol. Chap. <HI>2. §. 7.</HI> Pag. <HI>175.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>So also in his <HI>Catechism,</HI> he saith, it is not enough that we have an <HI>assured Knowledge</HI> that God is Almighty and perfect∣ly good, but that every one of us must be <HI>fully assured</HI> in his Conscience that <HI>he is beloved of God, and that he will be both his Father and Saviour.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calvin</HI>'s Catechism, Question <HI>8, 9, 10, 12.</HI></NOTE> And afterwards speaking of the <HI>right</HI> Faith; he saith <Q>it is a <HI>sure Perswasion,</HI> and <HI>stedfast Knowledge</HI> of God's tender Love towards <HI>US</HI> according as he hath plainly uttered in his Gospel, that he will be both a Father and a Saviour unto US, through the Means of Jesus Christ.<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Question <HI>111.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Palatine Catechism</HI> also printed by public Authority for the Use of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which is famous in most of the re∣formed Churches, and used in public Schools, gives us the same Idea of <HI>justifying</HI> Faith; telling us, <Q>that it is not only a Knowledge by which I do stedfastly assent to all Things, which God hath revealed to us in his Word, but also an <HI>as∣sured Affiance</HI> kindled in my Heart by the Holy Ghost, by which I REST upon God, making SURE ACCOUNT that Forgiveness of Sins, everlasting Righteousness and Life is bestowed, not only upon others, but upon ME, and that freely by the Mercy of God, for the Merit and Desert of Christ alone.</Q></P>
<P>The Description of justifying Faith given by the Church of <HI>Holland</HI> is worthy also of particular Observation: It is, (say they) a <HI>sure Knowledge</HI> of God and his Promises revealed to us in the Gospel, and a <HI>hearty Confidence,</HI> that <HI>all my Sins are forgiven me.</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Dutch brief Compend of Christian Religion. <HI>Vis.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Nay, Dr. <HI>William Perkins,</HI> who maintain'd this same Cause against the <HI>Papists,</HI> between one and two hundred Years ago, which I am now maintaining against <HI>Protestants,</HI> gives us the Definition of the Faith of <HI>Protestants</HI> in these Words,—
<PB N="12" REF="005568_0011_10186A7308027210"/><Q>A justifying Faith is not only a general Belief of the Articles of Faith, that Christ was dead and rose again for them that believe; but it is an <HI>assured</HI> stedfast <HI>Confidence,</HI> whereby e∣very Man <HI>particularly</HI> doth apply <HI>to himself</HI> the general Promises of God, for the Hope of Remission of his Sins in Christ, that Christ died, rose again, and did all the rest for <HI>him.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Willet</HI>'s <HI>Synopsis Papismi 976.</HI> Which he cites from Dr. <HI>Per∣kin</HI>'s <HI>Reformed Catholick,</HI> where, as well as in Dr. <HI>Abbot</HI> against Dr. <HI>Bishop</HI> this Matter is largely treated of.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> the <HI>Martyrologist</HI> is so zealous that he thinks it Blasphemy to deny this Definition.</P>
<P><Q>The Papists (saith he) <HI>blasphemously</HI> say, that Faith where∣with a Man firmly believeth, and certainly <HI>assureth</HI> himself that for Christ's Sake <HI>his</HI> Sins are forgiven, and that he shall possess eternal Life, is not Faith, but Rashness, not the Perswasion of the Holy Ghost, but Presumption of a Man's Boldness.</Q></P>
<P>And that the Matter in Dispute between the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> was fairly represented, we are abundantly confirmed by the Papists themselves, who glory in their being Enemies to a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Bellarmine,</HI> the <HI>Rhemists,</HI> and the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> all determine that there is no <HI>Confidence</HI> or <HI>Assurance</HI> in saving Faith.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Bellarmine</HI> saith it is not the Property of Faith to apply to every Believer, the Promises of God in Christ: This he saith is <HI>Presumption.</HI> (The common Objection at this Day!)</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Rhemists</HI> say, <Q>That Faith by which we are justified, is a general or universal believing of the Articles of Christ's Death and Resurrection, not any <HI>fond special</HI> Faith, or Confidence of <HI>each Man's own Salvation.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhemist Annot. Rom. <HI>4.</HI> Sect. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE></Q> And in another Place they stick not to affirm, <Q>That the Apostles never knew that <HI>forged special</HI> Faith of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> whereby every one believes that <HI>their</HI> Sins are remitted, and that <HI>themselves</HI> shall be saved. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. XI. Ver. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE></Q> Indeed, throughout the whole Performance, those <HI>Jesuits</HI> take every Opportunity to twit the Protestants for holding such a Faith, and spare no
<PB N="13" REF="005568_0012_10186A75A21C1228"/>Pains to twist and turn all these Texts which support the <HI>Protestant Cause.</HI></P>
<P>The Council of <HI>Trent</HI> declared, That justifying Faith is not that <HI>assured</HI> Belief, and <HI>Confidence of the Heart,</HI> whereby we are persuaded that <HI>our</HI> Sins are forgiven in Christ. <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Sess. Can. <HI>6.13.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And they have thunder'd out their <HI>Anathema's</HI> against all those who hold <HI>this</HI> in Opposition to their <HI>general</HI> and <HI>doubtsome</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>Saith the Council; If any shall say, that justifying Faith is nothing else but a <HI>Confidence</HI> of the Mercy of God, pardoning Sins for Christ's Sake: Or, that, that <HI>Confidence</HI> is it alone, by which they are justified, <HI>let him be accursed.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. <HI>13.</HI> Can. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> And again; If any shall say, that a Man is absolved from Sin, and justified by that, he <HI>assuredly believes himself</HI> to be absolved and justified, <HI>let him be accursed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Can. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>These Curses are to this Day in <HI>full Force and Virtue;</HI> so that we are all <HI>cursed</HI> and <HI>cursed</HI> again by the <HI>Papists,</HI> as well as reproach'd by <HI>Protestants,</HI> for the same Cause, even for our maintaining this heavenly Doctrine, viz. That a poor Sinner, in order to his being justified, must believe Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour, and <HI>his</HI> Redeemer. But the <HI>Curse causeless shall not come;</HI> there is no <HI>cursing them</HI> whom the <HI>Lord blesseth:</HI> I desire to take <HI>these Curses,</HI> and <HI>these Reproaches,</HI> and <HI>bind them as a Crown to my Head,</HI> esteeming it the greatest Glory of my Life, that I have been counted worthy to suffer Shame in this glorious Cause.</P>
<P>That which stirs up the Enmity of the Papists, and causes them to <HI>oppose, curse</HI> and <HI>burn</HI> the Maintainers of this Doc∣trine, is a Jealousie they have, lest it should one Day destroy Popery from the Face of the Earth: for they can foresee, without any Spirit of Prophesy, that if a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith should once gain Ground in the World, <HI>their</HI> Kingdom which is founded upon <HI>Darkness, Doubting</HI> and <HI>Uncertainty,</HI> must inevitably tumble to the Ground: they could no longer keep up a Market of <HI>Indulgences, Masses,</HI> and <HI>Pilgrimages,</HI> &amp;c. and the Fire of <HI>Purgatory</HI> would be quite <HI>put out.</HI></P>
<P>For which Reason it is astonishing to me, that the Doctrine of a <HI>general</HI> Faith, which as the <HI>Smoke of the bottomless Pit,
<PB N="14" REF="005568_0013_10186A7738F851F0"/>darkens the Air and the Sun,</HI> should be so caress'd in a Coun∣try as zealous for the general Protestant Cause as any in <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, I make no Doubt but there are many People in the Land, and some Ministers, who have fallen in Love with this Antichristian Doctrine, who yet out of Allegience to King GEORGE, or rather to King JESUS, would <HI>die the Death,</HI> and be burnt to Ashes, rather than be reconciled to that <HI>Mother of Abominations,</HI> the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Why then have they gone so far <HI>backwards,</HI> as to symbolize with her, in this great Article of Christian Religion? All I can learn they have to say for themselves, is only this; viz. <Q>That the Divines who came after, found out that <HI>Luther</HI> and the other Reformers had not rightly defin'd Faith by putting <HI>Assurance</HI> into the Nature of it.</Q></P>
<P>This Solution, if weigh'd in the Balance, will be found <HI>ligh∣ter than nothing and Vanity:</HI> For, <HI>Luther</HI> and the other Refor∣mers, were either <HI>quite right,</HI> or else quite <HI>wrong</HI> in putting As∣surance into the Nature of Faith. If <HI>they</HI> were <HI>quite right</HI> then these Men are <HI>quite wrong</HI> in finding Fault with their Defi∣nition of Faith: But if the Reformers were <HI>quite wrong</HI> (as <HI>these</HI> Men suppose) then these Things will follow, and <HI>must</HI> be maintained by them; viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Papists were in the Right, in condemning this Doctrine as Heresy, and warning against, and opposing <HI>the Protestants</HI> for preaching it up, provided they had kept within the Bounds of Moderation, and had not proceeded to <HI>cursing</HI> and <HI>burning.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That every one who died for a <HI>particular,</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith, (for, as a certain learned Author observes, <Q>it was seal∣ed with the Blood of <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Popish</HI> Flames:</Q> there is no Doubt but <HI>Tindal</HI> and <HI>Hamilton,</HI> were hurried to the Stake, and burnt, in a great Measure for their Zeal for this Doctrine) I say it follows that every one of these died <HI>as a Fool dieth,</HI> not as Witnesses to the Truth, but as Witnesses to a Falshood, of which the Devil was the Author; for he is the Author of all false Religion; so that they were all the Devil's Martyrs, and not Christ's.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Preaching of this false Divinity of which Sa∣tan, the false Spirit was the Author, was the Means of carry∣ing on that wonderful Work of Reformation which we have
<PB N="15" REF="005568_0014_10186A7A17217A70"/>heard and read so much of, when Thousands and Thousands were suppos'd to <HI>flock unto</HI> Jesus Christ as a Cloud, and as <HI>Doves unto their Windows,</HI> and <HI>Nations</HI> were <HI>born in a Day.</HI> For, one must be very ignorant of those Times, not to know that People were taught <HI>no other</HI> Way to the Favour of God, than by a <HI>particular,</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith, and that this Doctrine was forever sounding in their Ears. And Oh, how sweetly would such Talk as this <HI>for</HI> the <HI>Papists,</HI> and <HI>against</HI> the <HI>Pro∣testants,</HI> sound in the Ears of the <HI>Pope, Cardinals, Friers, Monks,</HI> and the Rest of their religious Rabble, causing their very Hearts within them to <HI>leap for Joy!</HI> And did they think this was the <HI>common</HI> Talk; would they not together with their Thank-offerings to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and other Saints, both good and bad for the hopeful Prospect, think it almost Time to send over another <HI>Reginald Poole,</HI> to forgive us in the Pope's Name, for what was past, and to reconcile us <HI>more perfectly</HI> to Holy Mother Church? And yet really this, is in Effect the Talk of every one who saith <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> and those who first broke away from the Pope, <Q>did not define Faith right by putting <HI>Assurance</HI> into the Nature of it.</Q> All <HI>that Popish</HI> Talk is wrapt up in this one Saying: So that <HI>hereby,</HI> they <HI>crock</HI> and <HI>besmear</HI> themselves so, that all the Water in the Sea will not wash off the <HI>Popish Smutt.</HI></P>
<P>That some who came after those Christian Heroes, did see, or pretend to see that the Reformers ought not to have put any <HI>Assurance</HI> into the Definition of justifying Faith, I make no Doubt: But then it is clear from what hath been said, that their Eyes were anointed with <HI>Popish Eye-Salve</HI> which made them so quick-sighted.</P>
<P>And accordingly, when a Number of them in <HI>Scotland</HI> of Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI>'s Faction, pretended to see the Falshood of that Faith, <Q>declaring that there was no <HI>personal Confidence</HI> in it, and that <HI>personal Application</HI> was meer Presumption, and the <HI>Fiction of a crasy Brain.</HI></Q> Mr. <HI>Robert Bailey,</HI> then Minister of <HI>Kilwinning,</HI> afterwards one of the <HI>Commissioners</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>Westminster Assembly,</HI> wrote against them, charg∣ing them with <HI>Popery</HI> for that very Assertion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historla motuum in Regno Scotice, Pag. <HI>517.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And if there was that Zeal for <HI>Protestantism</HI> in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> which there was then (An. Dom. 1640) in the Churches
<PB N="16" REF="005568_0015_10186A7F0FEEF6D8"/>of <HI>Scotland</HI> such <HI>Popish</HI> Talk would be born Testimony against, and not be <HI>countenanc'd</HI> by whole Assemblies of Ministers.</P>
<P>But to return, How shall we account for this Thing which seems so unaccountable; viz. That there should be such a <HI>warping</HI> towards <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>so Protestant</HI> a Country as <HI>this?</HI></P>
<P>In general; this <HI>Phenomenon</HI> must be resolved into <HI>Darkness:</HI> 'Tis <HI>because Darkness covers the Earth, and gross Darkness the People.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>general</HI> Faith is a Doctrine of <HI>Darkness:</HI> It is a Weed that grows only in the <HI>Shade,</HI> and <HI>withers</HI> when the Sun looks upon it.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the Time of that glorious Reformation, of which I have been speaking, when God <HI>sent forth his Light,</HI> and his <HI>Truth,</HI> it <HI>shrunk up</HI> before the <HI>Sun of Righteousness:</HI> but when the heavenly Light was withdrawn, it <HI>flourished again,</HI> poor People <HI>grop'd in the dark,</HI> and blunder'd backwards to∣wards <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>So it hath also been in this second Reformation; while the <HI>glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, shined</HI> into the Hearts of Mi∣nisters, the Meeting Houses rang, and the Fields eccho'd with a particular Faith; (no Minister <HI>can</HI> feel <HI>Assurance</HI> of the Love of Christ in his own Soul, without preaching it) but now since the <HI>Lord hath departed,</HI> even the <HI>Glory of the Lord that was risen</HI> upon them; alas, how seldom do we <HI>hear the joyful Sound!</HI> When Ministers don't <HI>know</HI> that <HI>they</HI> have Christ <HI>for nothing,</HI> they can't find in their Hearts to believe that others may have him <HI>for nothing:</HI> and then <HI>buying</HI> and <HI>selling</HI> Christ comes in the Room of <HI>free Grace:</HI> their <HI>benighted</HI> Hearers also, <HI>love to have it so;</HI> a <HI>general</HI> Faith is what alone will go down with <HI>them;</HI> like <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> before mentioned, they think it Presumption for a poor Sinner to apply Christ and his Benefits <HI>to Himself,</HI> before he hath something to pay, i.e. before he finds in himself a <HI>Willingness</HI> to <HI>make him welcome.</HI></P>
<P>By what hath been said, I trust it is evident what is the Faith of <HI>Protestants,</HI> and what is the Faith of <HI>Papists,</HI> and withal that 'tis <HI>seasonable</HI> to oppose the <HI>latter,</HI> and defend the <HI>former;</HI> which I shall endeavour to do by the following Arguments.</P>

<HEAD>PART I. Containing various Arguments <HI>against</HI> a <HI>general,</HI> and for a <HI>particular</HI> FAITH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>First</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Devils believe Christ to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, <HI>Mark</HI> i. 24. And if Men at Conversion only believe him to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, <HI>wherein</HI> doth the Faith of <HI>Devils</HI> differ from the <HI>Faith of God's Elect?</HI></P>
<P>I know it will be said, the <HI>Effects</HI> of their Faith are <HI>different:</HI> To which I answer, <HI>qualis causa, talis effectus;</HI> If the <HI>Effects</HI> are <HI>different,</HI> so are the <HI>Causes</HI> which produce them; and consequently Faith in those accursed Spirits must have <HI>another Difference</HI> than what lies in the <HI>Effects:</HI> which Difference can lie <HI>no where,</HI> but where I have plac'd it; viz. That the <HI>former</HI> only believe Christ to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, while the <HI>latter</HI> believe him to be <HI>their</HI> Saviour.</P>
<P>For, as 'tis Men's <HI>taking God at his Word,</HI> that Jesus Christ is <HI>their</HI> Saviour, which makes them <HI>new Creatures;</HI> so, did God by his Spirit convince the Devils that there was in Christ Salvation <HI>for them</HI> (which he never will do) they could be Devils no more. The same Discovery from the Spirit of God, which makes the former cease to be <HI>wicked Men,</HI> would make the latter cease to be <HI>evil Angels.</HI></P>
<P>However, if any one should think that the essential Dif∣ference between the Faith of Devils, and of <HI>good Men</HI> lies here; that the <HI>former</HI> only believe him to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, but not of any of their Race, while the latter believe him to be a Saviour of the humane Race. I answer, this Solution ra∣ther hurts than helps their Cause: For if a little <HI>general Pro∣bality</HI> of Salvation by Christ, is supposed the Means of ma∣king a Man a new Creature, while the Devils who have <HI>no Hope</HI> remain Devils still notwithstanding their Faith; how much <HI>more likely</HI> is it that Men would be <HI>renewed in the Spirit
<PB N="18" REF="005568_0017_10186A84A75CF338"/>of their Minds</HI> by a <HI>sure</HI> Persuasion that Christ and all his Benefits belonged <HI>to them in particular?</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, since the <HI>general</HI> Faith I am now opposing, can't be made out <HI>any Way</HI> to be <HI>essentially</HI> different from the <HI>Faith of Devils;</HI> the <HI>Faith of God's Elect</HI> must be a <HI>particular</HI> Faith, whereby a Man not only believes Jesus Christ to be the Saviour of <HI>Sinners in general,</HI> but the Saviour of <HI>himself,</HI> a most vile and miserable Sinner.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Second</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Faith in Christ is in Scripture set forth by a Marriage. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. <HI>7.4.</HI> Rev. <HI>19.7.</HI> Eph. <HI>5.32.2</HI> Cor. <HI>11.2.</HI></NOTE> But what Woman ever gives her self in Marriage to a Man, without looking upon him as <HI>her</HI> Friend, as one that loves <HI>her,</HI> and gives himself to <HI>her?</HI> If all this were wanting, that which is essential to a Marriage would be wanting: And yet this is all wanting in the spiritual Marriage be∣tween Christ and the Believer according to a <HI>general</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>The Soul gives her self to Christ, without looking upon him as <HI>her</HI> Friend, as one who loves <HI>her,</HI> or so much as ever intended Marriage with <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed if a Woman should marry a Man <HI>in the Dark,</HI> and give her self to him to be his lawful Wife, only because she thought him a likely Man, and had heard that he wanted a Wife; such a Marriage as this, would be well represented by a <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>general</HI> Faith. But was there ever such a Mar∣riage as <HI>this?</HI> Or, if ever any Woman should be so much <HI>out of her Wits,</HI> as to marry her self to a Man in this Man∣ner; all wise Men would look upon the Marriage to be a Nullity.</P>
<P>Wherefore, since the Holy Ghost represents Faith to us by a Marriage; and since a <HI>general</HI> Faith will admit of no∣thing between Christ and the Soul like a Marriage; it <HI>must</HI> be in the Way of a particular Faith, that poor Sinners are married to the <HI>Lamb of God.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Third</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Another Argument against a <HI>general</HI> Faith, is that it sup∣poses Men to make <HI>God a Liar,</HI> at the very Time of their Conversion. Who is he that <HI>maketh God a Liar,</HI> but he that believeth not the <HI>Record</HI> which he hath given of his Son? And this is the <HI>Record</HI> (O glorious <HI>Record!</HI>) that <HI>God hath given to US eternal Life in his Son.</HI> 1 Joh. 5.10, 11.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005568_0018_10186A880F944030"/>
If therefore at Conversion, we don't believe that <HI>God gives eternal Life to</HI> US, we make <HI>him a Liar.</HI></P>
<P>It don't excuse us, let us believe never so firmly that God <HI>gives eternal Life</HI> to <HI>Sinners in general:</HI> No, we must put <HI>OUR SELVES</HI> into the Number, and believe that <HI>God gives eternal Life</HI> to <HI>US,</HI> or else we make <HI>him a Liar</HI> according to the very Words of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Some may think the Difficulty solv'd by saying that the <HI>Record</HI> means that God gives eternal Life to us Sinners, <HI>if</HI> we will believe. <HI>If</HI> we will believe! That is, if we will <HI>pay</HI> for it: for <HI>here</HI> believing stands for <HI>working;</HI> and <HI>working</HI> is the <HI>same Thing</HI> with <HI>paying.</HI> There must be <HI>no legal ifs; one if</HI> spoils all: For this only is <HI>properly</HI> and <HI>strictly</HI> Gospel, viz. That God <HI>gives Eternal Life</HI> to Sinners <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> not <HI>if</HI> they will believe, but <HI>whether they believe or no:</HI> tho' without their believing, or <HI>taking</HI> the <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> will <HI>profit them nothing,</HI> but only be a Means of their receiving the <HI>greater Damnation.</HI> Nor is this a Doctrine of <HI>Licentious∣ness,</HI> as <HI>Satan</HI> would perswade the World: On the contrary 'tis the <HI>only Cure</HI> for a <HI>licentious Life.</HI> Convictions will not do; though the <HI>Pains of Hell get hold</HI> of Sinners, yet they are liable afterwards to return like <HI>the Dog to his Vomit, and like the Sow that was washed to her wallowing in the Mire.</HI> But can a Man sin against a God giving <HI>eternal Life</HI> to him?— No verily, when once the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> of God <HI>his</HI> Saviour hath appeared to <HI>him,</HI> all the Devils in Hell can't make him in Love with a wicked Life any longer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Fourth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>As the Doctrine of a general Faith reflects upon the ever-blessed God, so doth it upon Man too, by supposing him to be stupid and irrational at Conversion; <HI>when</HI> all Men accor∣ding to the Scripture, <HI>come to themselves,</HI> though they were <HI>besides themselves</HI> before. Luke 15.17. It will be granted that what a convinced Sinner wants, is to see that <HI>he</HI> hath a Right to <HI>Christ:</HI> Well, by a divine and supernatural Light, he comes to see that <HI>whosoever will,</HI> hath a <HI>Right</HI> to Christ, and yet he don't see that <HI>he</HI> hath a <HI>Right</HI> to him! Was ever any Thing more absurd! Suppose one among a Com∣pany of condemned Malefactors in Prison, expecting Exe∣cution, should verily believe that the King hath sent Orders that <HI>whosoever will</HI> shall have his Liberty, and yet at the same Time should not see that <HI>he</HI> had his Liberty; would
<PB N="20" REF="005568_0019_10186A8A8DB75E28"/>not every one sap that herein he was more like a <HI>Stock</HI> or a <HI>Stone,</HI> than a reasonable Man?</P>
<P>Thus doth this Doctrine suppose Men to exercise no more Reason at Conversion, I won't say than Brutes, (for Brutes are wiser: when they want Liberty, no sooner are the Bars let down, but <HI>every one</HI> sees Liberty <HI>for himself:</HI>) but than Stones and <HI>Stumps;</HI> and yet <HI>them</HI> all Men, however it was with them <HI>before,</HI> or may be <HI>afterwards,</HI> have the clearest Exercise of their Reason.</P>
<P>But where would be the Harm, if they should allow a ra∣tional Creature transacting for Eternity, to be as wise as the <HI>Beasts that perish?</HI> When these see a <HI>general</HI> Privilege, they always see a <HI>particular</HI> Privilege <HI>for themselves.</HI> And why will they not allow that when a poor condemned Sinner sees Salvation for Sinners in <HI>general</HI> in Christ, he should <HI>at the same Time,</HI> see Salvation <HI>for himself in particular?</HI> Why, this would be to suppose too much <HI>Light</HI> in Conversion, and <HI>that</HI> they are dreadfully afraid of: If Conversion is <HI>all Darkness,</HI> (as to a Man's <HI>own</HI> Case) <HI>it is all good:</HI> there can't be <HI>too much Darkness;</HI> but the least <HI>Glimmering</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> would <HI>spoil all.</HI></P>

Now a Man cannot honestly <HI>re∣ceive</HI> a Gift, without seeing the <HI>Gift</HI> was made to <HI>him:</HI> If he doth, 'tis not properly <HI>receiving</HI> (for <HI>Giving</HI> and <HI>Receiving</HI> are <HI>Correlates;</HI> but only <HI>taking without Leave,</HI> or <HI>Stealing:</HI> And the Thing thus <HI>fraudulently</HI> taken is what he hath <HI>no Right</HI> to. If I should give a Crown to a poor Man, and he should take it, without seeing that I did really intend to give it to <HI>him,</HI> he would be a <HI>Thief</HI> and a <HI>Robber,</HI> and remain without <HI>any Right</HI> to the Money, which would have been <HI>his own,</HI> had he been convinced that I gave it to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Now the great and good God, hath given <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to a poor perishing World; If any Man <HI>believes the Record,</HI> and takes Jesus Christ as <HI>given</HI> of God to <HI>him,</HI> Christ and all his Benefits, are <HI>his immediately:</HI> But whoever pretends to take Christ, without being perswaded that God gives Christ to
<PB N="21" REF="005568_0020_10186A8C664EEA50"/><HI>him,</HI> only steals <HI>him,</HI> and hath <HI>no Lot,</HI> nor <HI>Inheritance</HI> in him: The old Proverb, <HI>no Good comes by stealing,</HI> must hold good in Things of a spiritual, as well as in Things of a temporal Nature.</P>
<P>This is certainly a parallel Case: The <HI>former</HI> is not more properly <HI>temporal,</HI> than the <HI>latter</HI> is <HI>spiritual</HI> thieving. — Wherefore, since a <HI>general</HI> Faith puts the whole World upon <HI>stealing Christ;</HI> since it teaches every Man to <HI>snatch at him in the dark,</HI> and to <HI>take</HI> him without seeing that Christ belongs to <HI>him,</HI> and consequently to dream that he <HI>possesses</HI> a Saviour when he doth not, to the infinite Hazzard of his Soul; it follows plainly that a <HI>general</HI> Faith, is not the <HI>Faith of God's Elect.</HI></P>

<P>What an <HI>absurd,</HI> and <HI>ineffectual</HI> Thing doth a <HI>general</HI> Faith make of the <HI>glorious</HI> and <HI>everlasting Gospel!</HI> The Gospel, like the Author of it, is not only the <HI>Wisdom of God,</HI> but it is also the <HI>Power of God</HI> unto <HI>Salvation:</HI> But <HI>that Gospel</HI> which is preached by the <HI>Generalists,</HI> is a mean <HI>absurd</HI> Thing, and of none <HI>Effect</HI> to the <HI>saving</HI> of Souls.</P>
<P>Suppose a King should publish an <HI>Act of Grace</HI> in Favour of Pirates, declaring that <HI>whosoever will,</HI> shall have the Be∣nefit of it, and yet at the same Time <HI>embarass</HI> it with this Clause, viz. That he would have every Pirate understand it so that <HI>Pirates in general</HI> should be benefited by it, but that no Pirate should conclude that <HI>he in particular</HI> should ever be the better for it; what would every Man of Sense, say of <HI>such an Act of Grace!</HI> And what would be the Effect of it? Would the Pirates come <HI>sailing in?</HI> No, not one: they would choose to keep at a safe Distance: For no one could tell but that notwithstanding the King's Clemency to Pirates <HI>in general, he in particular</HI> might be <HI>hang'd.</HI></P>
<P>And yet <HI>such</HI> an <HI>Act of Grace</HI> hath the King of Heaven made in Favour of us Sinners and Rebels of the humane Race, as 'tis explained by the Friends of a <HI>general</HI> Faith.— For, though it runs with an <HI>Ho every one that thirsteth,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. <HI>55.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> and a <HI>whosoever will, let him come and take of the Waters of Life freely;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 22.17.</NOTE> yet, say <HI>they,</HI> God would have every Sinner, when he comes, believe only that there is Pardon and Happiness through Christ for Sinners in <HI>general,</HI> but that no one should
<PB N="22" REF="005568_0021_10186A8E2A746498"/>believe that he shall ever be the better for Christ. But what Effect would <HI>such</HI> an <HI>Act of Grace</HI> have? Why, surely, it must be as unsuccessful as the <HI>other:</HI> Sinners would be afraid to <HI>come in:</HI> For no one could tell but that notwithstanding God's good Will to Sinners in general, <HI>he</HI> in <HI>particular</HI> might be <HI>damn'd.</HI> The Truth is, there must be a <HI>particular</HI> Appli∣cation in <HI>both</HI> Cases: The <HI>Pirate</HI> grown sick of <HI>that Sort of Life,</HI> must see that the King meant <HI>him,</HI> as much as if his name had been mention'd <HI>in particular;</HI> and when he sees there is Safety for <HI>him,</HI> then he comes in immediately <HI>in his Heart.</HI> The Sinner also grown weary and <HI>heavy laden</HI> with his Sins, must see that God means <HI>him</HI> in the Call of the Gospel, as much as if he was call'd <HI>by Name;</HI> and when he sees the Love and Kindness of God <HI>his</HI> Saviour towards <HI>him,</HI> and that <HI>he</HI> is in no Danger, he returns <HI>in his Heart</HI> immedi∣ately, with a <HI>Behold I come unto thee, for thou art the Lord my God.</HI></P>
<P>The right Way of returning, for <HI>Prodigals</HI> and Pirates both, is for them to be melted down and overcome with the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> of their God and Prince, towards <HI>them,</HI> such Rebels, and such Traitors as <HI>they</HI> have been! And if any pretend to return without being conquer'd by Goodness, <HI>meerly</HI> to <HI>save themselves,</HI> and for <HI>what they can get;</HI> they are meer Mercenaries, disloyal Subjects, <HI>Pirates</HI> and <HI>Prodigals</HI> in <HI>their Hearts</HI> as much as ever.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Seventh</HI> ARGUMENT</HEAD>
<P>Believing in Christ, is explained to be <HI>trusting</HI> in him: but a Man can't <HI>trust</HI> in Christ, without a <HI>particular</HI> Faith that Christ is his Saviour. What saith <HI>David? I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said, thou art my God.</HI> Ps. 31.14. Vid. Isa. 12.2. If a Man don't see Christ to be his Saviour, he cannot see enough in him to <HI>trust his</HI> Soul with him. 'Tis of the <HI>Es∣sence</HI> of <HI>trusting</HI> to be perswaded that the Person whom we <HI>trust,</HI> is a <HI>Friend</HI> and will do that for us which we <HI>trust</HI> him for. If one should try to trust another with an Affair of Importance, without being perswaded of his <HI>Friend∣ship</HI> and <HI>Fidelity,</HI> he would find it an <HI>impossible</HI> Thing.

<P><HI>True</HI> Faith brings <HI>true</HI> Peace into the Soul. Rom. 5.1.

<P>A <HI>general</HI> Faith cannot be <HI>right,</HI> because it don't <HI>work by love.</HI> We are told, that in <HI>Christ Jesus nothing avails, but Faith that worketh by Love.</HI> Gal. 5.6.

<P><PB N="24" REF="005568_0023_10186A9498AD65E8"/>
Whoever considers the Matter attentively, will find it to be of the <HI>Nature of Love,</HI> to consider the Person beloved, as one who <HI>loves us.</HI> We <HI>can't</HI> love any one with a Love of <HI>Complacence,</HI> without apprehending him to be one who <HI>loves us,</HI> or at least, <HI>would love us</HI> upon sufficient Acquaintance with us, which amounts to the same. Wherefore, when we exercise Love towards God, we <HI>do,</HI> and <HI>must,</HI> in Proportion to our <HI>loving him,</HI> look upon him to be <HI>a God loving us.</HI> Not that we love him only <HI>for</HI> loving <HI>us</HI> (<HI>such Lovers</HI> are <HI>Haters of God</HI>) but yet the Idea of his <HI>loving us,</HI> is not <HI>excluded</HI> Nay, as the Apostle saith, <HI>We love Him because He loved us first.</HI> 1 Joh. 4.19.

<P>And as a <HI>general</HI> Faith don't bring any Love into the Soul, so it is an <HI>utter</HI> and <HI>irreconcileable</HI> Enemy to <HI>true</HI> Humility. Indeed, a Man who hath only a <HI>general</HI> Faith, may <HI>hang down his Head like a Bulrush,</HI> and be very dejected, as if he had <HI>no Peace;</HI> (and indeed he could have none were it not for the <HI>Hardness</HI> of his <HI>Heart:</HI>) but this is only that <HI>legal</HI> Humility, which the <HI>legal</HI> World is <HI>in Love</HI> with. <HI>True</HI> Humility is <HI>loathing</HI> our selves before God: but we never <HI>loathe ourselves,</HI> but when we see <HI>God pacisied.</HI> When a Man <HI>sees God</HI> as he is, he always <HI>abhors himself:</HI> Job 42.5,6. but no Man can <HI>see God</HI> as he is, unless he sees him to be a <HI>God in Christ;</HI> i. e. a <HI>forgiving</HI> God, with a <HI>Pardon in his Hand</HI> for <HI>him,</HI> and the very <HI>chief of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So far</HI> is the <HI>common</HI> Divinity from being true, viz.

<HEAD><HI>Eleventh</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>If a <HI>general</HI> Faith is <HI>true</HI> Faith, then it is a Sin for <HI>unconvert∣ed Persons to pray;</HI> and Ministers should warn their Hearers, <HI>never to pretend to pray 'till they are converted.</HI></P>
<P>I know that some of the Friends of a <HI>general</HI> Faith, are very zealous against <HI>this</HI> Error: but, let them <HI>look at home:</HI> 'tis certain that none <HI>need</HI> to hold it, but those who hold a <HI>general</HI> Faith; and there is a Necessity laid upon <HI>them:</HI> for <HI>this</HI> Faith and <HI>that</HI> Error, are so <HI>joined together,</HI> that <HI>no Man</HI> can <HI>put them asunder.</HI></P>
<P>If any one thinks I bear too hard upon <HI>his</HI> Faith, I would clear my self by asking him a few Questions.—In the first Place, I would ask him, Whether an unconverted Man may not use the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> and pray God, for Instance, to <HI>forgive his Trespasses?</HI> To this, he must say, <HI>Yes.</HI> I would also ask him, Whether he should not <HI>ask in Faith:</HI> Jam. 1.6. and 1 Tim. 2.8. To this also he <HI>must</HI> say, <HI>Yes.</HI> I would then ask him, Whether <HI>asking in Faith,</HI> is not <HI>believing</HI> that we <HI>receive</HI> what we ask for? Mark 11.24. This also must be answered in the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> And from these Concessions, it will follow, as from his own Mouth, that when an un∣converted Man prays God to forgive <HI>his Trespasses,</HI> he should have a <HI>particular</HI> Faith <HI>that</HI> God for Christ's <HI>Sake doth forgive his Trespasses.</HI> So that <HI>be</HI> himself, by owning the Scriptures to be <HI>true,</HI> bears <HI>so hard</HI> upon <HI>his own</HI> Faith, as to make it <HI>tumble</HI> to the Ground. Nor can he possibly <HI>hold it up,</HI> and be <HI>self-consistent,</HI> without telling his Hearers (if a Minister) that <HI>they must all wait 'till they are converted before they pre∣sume to make one Prayer;</HI> or, at least, that whatever Prayers poor Sinners make, they must <HI>see to it, that they never pray in Faith;</HI> which Advice is full bad enough for the Devil him∣self
<PB N="26" REF="005568_0025_10186A98EC70D0D8"/>to give; and yet every one <HI>may</HI> and <HI>must</HI> give this Advice, who would be an hearty Friend to a general Faith, and <HI>stand by it</HI> at all Adventures. I say he both <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>must:</HI> for letting People <HI>pray in Faith,</HI> is letting them have a <HI>particular</HI> Faith; and letting them have a <HI>particular</HI> Faith, is letting them, <HI>with his Consent</HI> commit <HI>Murder</HI> upon a <HI>ge∣neral</HI> Faith: So that if he is tender of the Life of it, he <HI>must</HI> solemnly warn against that <HI>Sort of praying,</HI> which will be the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>his</HI> Faith, and never fails to <HI>murder</HI> it wherever it comes.</P>
<P>'Tis possible some one may think that <HI>he</HI> can <HI>save the Life</HI> of a <HI>general</HI> Faith, and yet permit unconverted Persons <HI>to pray,</HI> and to <HI>pray in Faith</HI> too.— He may insist; <Q>a Man may <HI>ask in Faith</HI> according to the forecited Passage of St. <HI>James,</HI> though he hath <HI>no Assurance</HI> that he shall receive what he asks for; and that 'tis enough if he doth not doubt of God's Power and Goodness, but only doubts whe∣ther <HI>he</HI> is a fit Object of God's Mercy.</Q> There can be nothing said but this to <HI>keep Life</HI> in their Faith: And if there is <HI>no Virtue</HI> in <HI>this,</HI> it must <HI>die the Death.</HI> And really there is <HI>no Virtue</HI> in it; it is a <HI>miserable Invention,</HI> a <HI>poor Shift</HI> which the Papists made Use of, near two hundred Years ago, to <HI>keep alive</HI> the <HI>same dying Cause.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> call'd <HI>Rhemists,</HI> say in their Exposition upon <HI>this</HI> Passage, to this Effect, <Q>That the <HI>Protestants</HI> would prove by this Text, that a Man ought to pray with <HI>Assurance,</HI> that he shall receive the good Things he prays for.</Q> And they would ward off the deadly Blow which St. <HI>James</HI> strikes at a <HI>general</HI> Faith by this very <HI>Shift,</HI> viz. by saying <Q>that a Man <HI>may ask in Faith,</HI> &amp;c. when he don't doubt of God's Power and Goodness, but all his Doubt is in his own Fit∣ness.</Q> The very godly, and very learned Mr. <HI>Cartwright's</HI> Answer to those <HI>Papists then,</HI> will do for our <HI>Protestants now</HI> who are engag'd in the same Cause. 'Tis in Substance as follows, viz. <Q>That if <HI>Protestants</HI> do prove by this Text that every one should ask with Assurance of receiving the good Things they ask for; they do it by the plain and express Words of Scripture: And that if they don't <HI>herein</HI> understand the Text right, St. <HI>James</HI> must be supposed to speak <HI>one</HI> Thing and to mean <HI>another.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And as to our doubting, not of God's Power and Good∣ness, but of our own <HI>Fitness</HI> to receive what we ask of God;
<PB N="27" REF="005568_0026_10186A9D77DEBFE8"/>he saith, <Q>We should not <HI>doubt</HI> of our <HI>Fitness,</HI> but that it should be <HI>out of all Doubt,</HI> that we are utterly <HI>unfit,</HI> and worthy of all those Evils, which are contrary to the good Things we ask: And yet that notwithstanding, we should <HI>assuredly</HI> believe that God will bestow them upon us because he hath promised them to us in Christ Jesus.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed, whoever believes <HI>in his Heart</HI> that Christ is <HI>worthy</HI> (which we should <HI>all</HI> do) sees that the <HI>Dogs</HI> are <HI>welcome,</HI> and <HI>can't</HI> be so <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">If any one thinks I am <HI>vile</HI> in calling this <HI>Popish</HI> Religion, I must be <HI>more vile</HI> yet, and call it <HI>downright Heathenism.</HI> Whoever is acquainted with the ancient Poets, knows that the Heathens never pray'd with Courage, but when they saw themselves worthy of what they pray'd for.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Twelfth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>That it makes Christ but a <HI>little</HI> Saviour. Every one who hath only a <HI>general</HI> Faith, believes Christ to be only a <HI>little</HI> Saviour; and the Preachers of this <HI>new Gospel,</HI> do in Effect, what in them lies, to make their Hearers believe that Jesus Christ is not a <HI>great</HI> but a <HI>little</HI> Saviour.</P>
<P>I don't say that in Words, they affirm Christ to be a <HI>little</HI> Saviour; this would be <HI>open Blasphemy:</HI> They may, both Ministers and others, <HI>in their Talk,</HI> set forth the Perfections of Christ, and declare that he is <HI>mighty to save, able to save even to the very uttermost.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever any of us may say <HI>about Christ,</HI> every one regards him <HI>just so much</HI> (and no more) as he <HI>regards</HI> him in <HI>his Heart.</HI> And he that don't <HI>in his Heart</HI> believe him to be
<PB N="28" REF="005568_0027_10186AA1461B52F0"/><HI>his</HI> Saviour, let him say what he will, don't believe him to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour; and consequently the Ministers who tell poor Sinners that they must not believe Christ to be <HI>their</HI> Sa∣viour in <HI>particular,</HI> do, in Effect, tell them they must not be∣lieve Christ to be a <HI>great,</HI> but only a <HI>little</HI> Saviour. But it will be said, it is no Consequence, that if a Man don't be∣lieve Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour, he don't believe him to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour.—I reply; a Man can't see Christ to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, without seeing him to be a <HI>Saviour</HI> great enough to save <HI>him:</HI> He therefore that never saw Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour, never yet saw him to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour. Here it will be said; Every one who sees Christ to be a <HI>great</HI> Sa∣viour, sees him to be a Saviour <HI>great</HI> enough to save <HI>him, if</HI> he was but <HI>qualified</HI> to be sav'd by this <HI>great</HI> Saviour. If he was qualified! Away with these <HI>legal ifs</HI> to Rome! When a Man sees Christ to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, the <HI>Wall of Parti∣tion is broken down,</HI> and he sees Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour, bad as he is, without one <HI>if</HI> in the Way. 'Tis <HI>Qualification</HI> en∣ough to see <HI>Christ qualified:</HI> When therefore he sees <HI>Christ qualified</HI> he <HI>can't help</HI> seeing <HI>himself qualified.</HI> How is it possi∣ble that any one should by Faith realize that Christ is quali∣fied to save the <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI> in all their <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Filth,</HI> as <HI>black</HI> as <HI>Hell</HI> with Sin and Lust and <HI>Unbelief,</HI> and yet have any Scruple, whether <HI>he</HI> is <HI>qualified</HI> to be <HI>sav'd</HI> by <HI>such</HI> a Saviour?</P>
<P>'Tis the greatest Absurdity in the World to suppose this: And if it is an Absurdity; then it is plain, that all I have said against a general Faith in this Argument, is <HI>sound Speech that cannot be condemned;</HI> viz. That it makes Christ to be a <HI>little</HI> Saviour; that those who have only a <HI>general</HI> Faith, ne∣ver yet saw him to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour; and that the Preach∣ers of this <HI>new Gospel</HI> teach People only, in Effect, that they must believe Christ to be a <HI>little,</HI> and not a <HI>great</HI> Saviour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Thirteenth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Another Argument against this <HI>general</HI> Faith is, That it is an Enemy, i. e. it makes Men Enemies to that glorious and Soul-ravishing Doctrine of <HI>Assurance,</HI> of which we read <HI>so much</HI> in the Scriptures of Truth.</P>
<P>Time would fail to enumerate all those Passages which ei∣ther <HI>assert,</HI> or else plainly <HI>suppose,</HI> the <HI>Assurance</HI> of Faith to be what Believers <HI>commonly</HI> attain to. Very many to this Purpose may be seen in St. <HI>John</HI>'s I. Epistle: Nay, St. <HI>Peter</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="005568_0028_10186AA426A60330"/>in his I. Epist. 1. Chap. Ver. 1, 8. takes it for granted, that all the Believers who were scattered throughout <HI>Pontus, Ga∣latia, Cappadocia, Asia</HI> and <HI>Bythinia,</HI> knew something of <HI>As∣surance</HI> by their own Experience. For which Reason, I have often thought with my self, what dreadful <HI>Antinomians Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and other Apostles would be looked upon were they to live at this Day; and how fast most Pulpit-doors in Town and Country would be shut against them! For the Generali∣ty of Ministers are so far from being of the same Mind with <HI>them,</HI> that they don't seem to think that scarce one in a thou∣sand ever arrives to <HI>Assurance;</HI> when they speak of it, they <HI>run it down</HI> as a Thing that People are better <HI>without</HI> than with. 'Tis represented by them as a Thing that would make Persons <HI>lazy</HI> and <HI>proud;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Pope saith Men could not be humble, if they had <HI>Assurance,</HI></NOTE> Nay, one of Note declared it to be so dangerous a Thing, that he said <Q>an <HI>assured Believer,</HI> would be in great Danger of murdering himself, that he might go to Heaven the sooner.</Q></P>
<P>Now, to what can it be owing that the Apostles and these Ministers agree no better in the Article of <HI>Assurance?</HI> The <HI>Root of Bitterness</HI> is the above-mention'd <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>general</HI> Faith: Take away <HI>that</HI> and the <HI>Contention ceases:</HI> Whereas that being <HI>held fast</HI> there <HI>can</HI> be <HI>no Reconciliation.</HI> Nay, I have sometimes wonder'd how it comes to pass, that the <HI>Men of this Device,</HI> agree with the Apostles as far as they do, in owning Assurance to be so much as a <HI>possible Attain∣ment:</HI> For even <HI>this</HI> is more than their Principle will admit of. Let us make the Trial—Suppose some one hath actual∣ly attain'd to <HI>Assurance;</HI> I would ask, How did he come <HI>by it?</HI></P>
<P>Now, if the Faith by which he was justified, was, as <HI>they</HI> say, only a Belief of <HI>Jesus Christ's</HI> being a sufficient Saviour for Sinners <HI>in general;</HI> every one may see that <HI>this</HI> Faith, though strain'd to the <HI>highest Pitch,</HI> will not <HI>come up</HI> to <HI>Assu∣rance.</HI> For there can be nothing in the <HI>Superlative,</HI> of which there was not <HI>something</HI> in the <HI>Positive.</HI> If therefore there was no <HI>Assurance</HI> in the <HI>positive</HI> Degree, 'tis <HI>impossible</HI> there should be <HI>any</HI> in the <HI>Superlative.</HI> Since therefore the Man's Faith (let him be never so <HI>strong in the Faith</HI>) don't help him <HI>at all</HI> to <HI>Assurance,</HI> it follows that his <HI>Assurance</HI> if he hath <HI>any,</HI> can be only the <HI>Assurance of Works.</HI> Now that there can be no such Thing as the <HI>Assurance of Works,</HI> or <HI>Assurance</HI> ri∣sing <HI>only</HI> from the Observation of our good Frames, and
<PB N="30" REF="005568_0029_10186AA5F11D0B38"/>good Duties, is evident enough from this single Considera∣tion, viz. That every Believer knows how <HI>unlike</HI> a Child of God he is <HI>sometimes:</HI> And if he asks himself whether he who is <HI>sometimes like</HI> a Child of God, and <HI>oftentimes unlike</HI> one, be really a true Child of God, or else only a reformed Hy∣pocrite; the most he can arrive to <HI>this Way</HI> will be a <HI>Pro∣bability</HI> that his State <HI>may</HI> be good. This Thing must needs be so: And if it is so, then it will follow, that though a Man hath never so much of <HI>their</HI> Faith, and withal <HI>abounds</HI> in good Works, he can't hereby come to any <HI>Assurance:</HI> And if Faith and Works together will not bring <HI>Assurance,</HI> I know not what will; all Men must live and die <HI>without</HI> it. The <HI>small</HI> Agreement therefore which there is between these Men and the Apostles, is <HI>too much</HI> for <HI>their</HI> Principles to bear: to be consistent with themselves, they must deny even the <HI>Possibility of Assurance.</HI> The <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>PERKINS</HI> (in his <HI>Treatise of Conscience</HI>) saith, <Q>That the Question between the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> is, Whether a Man in this Life, may ordinarily, without Revelation, be infallibly certain of his own Salvation? — <HI>We,</HI> saith he, hold this for a clear and evident Truth, but the <HI>Papists</HI> deny it wholly.</Q> Hear what <HI>LUTHER</HI> saith. <Q>I have used, saith he, many Words to declare that a Christian must assure himself that <HI>HE</HI> is in the Favour of God—that we may learn to reject and utterly abandon that Devilish Opi∣nion of the whole Kingdom of the <HI>Pope,</HI> which taught, that a Man ought to be uncertain, and to stand in Doubt of the Favour of God towards <HI>HIM</HI> —<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: It was not only an extream Madness, but an horrible Impiety that the Monks did so earnestly entice the Youth, both Men and Women to their Monasteries, and to their Holy Orders, (as <HI>they</HI> called them) as to a most certain State of Salvation: and yet when they had done, they had their doubt of the Grace and Favour of God towards <HI>them.</HI></Q>—He adds, <Q>The <HI>Pope</HI> called the whole World to the Obedience of the holy Church <HI>Rome,</HI> as to an holy State, in the which they might undoubtedly attain Salvation; and yet after he had brought them under the Obedience of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Laws, he commanded them to <HI>DOUBT</HI> of their Salvation. <HI>Comment Gal.</HI> W. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></Q> If any one should fear the Papists have not Justice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, the <HI>Papists</HI> shall speak for themselves. <Q>Christian Men, (say the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>) do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves of the Certainty of their Salvation, but glory in the Hope thereof only. <HI>Rhem.

<P>A certain Minister who hath been persuading, <NOTE PLACE="marg">N B</NOTE> and hath actually per∣suaded many of his Hearers; that the Doctrine of <HI>Assurance</HI> is a <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine, a desired to consider what these <HI>Jesuite</HI> says and to blush.</P></NOTE> Papists have gone this length:
<PB N="31" REF="005568_0030_10186AA79D964B88"/>They were <HI>resolved</HI> to follow <HI>their general</HI> Faith as far as it would carry them; and since it led them to contradict the Apostles entirely, and to deny all <HI>genuine Assurance,</HI> they have done it with <HI>great Boldness.</HI> Nor, can I see how <HI>these Calvinists,</HI> (for <HI>Calvinists</HI> they will be called, though against <HI>Calvin</HI> in the main Point of a justifying Faith, as well as in other important Articles, as may be shewn in the Sequel) can <HI>rationally</HI> stop 'till they come to the same Conclusion.</P>
<P>Is not <HI>this</HI> therefore enough to spoil the Credit of a ge∣neral Faith (if only <HI>this</HI> could be said against it) that it con∣strains Men by necessary Consequence to deny the Doctrine of Assurance, which the Bible is every where bespangled with? And, is it not clear from hence, that <HI>true</HI> Faith is of a <HI>particular</HI> Nature, whereby every one believes Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour, and hath just so much <HI>Assurance</HI> as he hath Faith?</P>
<P>Nor, doth this Account of justifying Faith at all derogate from the Honour which the Scriptures put upon good Works, in making them <HI>evidential</HI> of a Man's good Estate. Indeed when a poor Sinner believes to Salvation, he looks upon God in Christ to be his Friend (according to his Word) without seeing any good Thing in himself; for before Faith there can be none: But a Man can never determine that he <HI>hath</HI> believ'd, and is <HI>passed from Death to Life,</HI> without seeing the <HI>Fruits</HI> of Faith in himself; because <HI>if any Man is in Christ Jesus, he is a new Creature.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.17. Observing this Change in our selves, is what the Apostle, in Rom. 8.16, calls the <HI>Witness</HI> of our <HI>own Spirits;</HI> and our looking upon God in Christ, to be our <HI>Friend,</HI> which we are enabled to by his Spirit, is in the same Verse, called the <HI>Witness</HI> of <HI>his Spirit:</HI> So that in Order to our being <HI>quite sure,</HI> that our <HI>State</HI> is good, there must be <HI>two Witnesses,</HI> and God must be <HI>one</HI> of them: By <HI>his Spirit witnessing with our Spirits, that we are his Children,</HI> we can be sure, but <HI>no other Way.</HI> And this Assurance, is what I suppose all the Children of God expe∣rience more, or less of: Besides the Alteration they see in themselves, and all rational Arguments they can bring to prove their Adoption, God sometimes more especially, <HI>shines</HI> into their Hearts, by the <HI>Spirit of Adoption;</HI> they see God as a reconciled God and Father, and hear him saying to them, Son, Daughter, be of good <HI>Cheer, your Sins are forgiven you,</HI> I have <HI>loved you with an everlasting Lovingkindness;</HI> I will
<PB N="32" REF="005568_0031_10186AAA33053FB0"/>never <HI>leave you,</HI> nor <HI>forsake you.</HI> Nor can I think all those who are against me in this Argument, are utter Strangers to these heavenly Irradiations. O blessed God, pour out the <HI>Spirit of Adoption</HI> upon them! Oh that all my Antagonists may have the <HI>full Assurance of Faith!</HI> Dispute out <HI>thy</HI> Cause with them, by filling their Hearts brim-full of the Love of Christ: Let Assurance of thy Love quite spoil them for dis∣puting any more against <HI>Assurance.</HI>— But to return—This Witness of the Spirit, of which I have been speaking, or Knowledge of our good Estate, <HI>partly,</HI> and <HI>principally</HI> by the <HI>Spirit of Adoption</HI> shining immediately into our Hearts, is what is called <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> by almost all the Friends of a <HI>ge∣neral</HI> Faith: And all these, whosoever they be, are with the <HI>Papists</HI> utter Enemies to any <HI>genuine Assurance:</HI> If they talk <HI>for</HI> it, it must be, because they don't understand their own Principles, or, which is worse, because <HI>by this Craft</HI> they <HI>have their Wealth,</HI> and keep up their Reputation among the People.</P>
<P>And as for here and there one of the <HI>Generalists,</HI> who suppose one in a Thousand are favour'd with the <HI>Witness of God's Spirit;</HI> if they are right in owning there is such a Thing, they <HI>must</HI> be <HI>wrong</HI> in supposing it to be <HI>so rare a Thing:</HI> Or, in other Words, they <HI>must</HI> deny entirely the <HI>Wit∣ness of God's Spirit,</HI> (as the Bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry</HI> with his Clergy, have lately done) or else own that every one hath this <HI>Witness of the Spirit</HI> in some Measure, when he ex∣ercises saving Faith, and consequently bid <HI>Adieu</HI> to that <HI>ge∣neral</HI> and <HI>dark</HI> Faith which is so dear to them. For, not to insist upon the Apostle's making it the <HI>common</HI> Privilege of Believers, to have <HI>the Spirit of God witnessing with their Spi∣rits, that they are the Children of God:</HI> (Though this is an Argument which I think it impossible for them to get over) Nor yet to <HI>dwell</HI> upon <HI>this,</HI> that <HI>otherwise</HI> Christ would <HI>leave</HI> Believers <HI>comfortless,</HI> it having been shewn that there is no <HI>rational</HI> Comfort without it: (which also is a Difficulty on <HI>their</HI> Side insuperable:) I say, waving these Arguments; this Consideration is of great Weight, viz. That by owning that <HI>any</HI> have <HI>this Witness</HI> assuring them of their Adoption, they are forced to invent <HI>two Sorts</HI> of true Faith, <HI>essentially</HI> dif∣ferent from each other; for which they have no Ground in Scripture. Indeed the Scripture speaks of a Faith <HI>unfeigned,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tim. 1. 5. and supposes there is a Faith that is only <HI>feign∣ed:</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="005568_0032_10186AACEC919B60"/>But as to there being <HI>two Sorts</HI> of <HI>unfeigned</HI> Faith, <HI>essen∣tially</HI> different, as they <HI>must</HI> be, if the one hath <HI>Assurance</HI> in it, and the other hath <HI>no Degree</HI> of <HI>Assurance:</HI> This, I say looks like Man's Invention to support a Cause; and if <HI>other∣wise</HI> their Cause must <HI>drop,</HI> they ought rather to let it <HI>drop,</HI> than to shore it up by any Divinity not found in the Bible.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Fourteenth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A general Faith is an Enemy to <HI>true</HI> Repentance. That true Faith always produceth <HI>true</HI> Repentance, will be grant∣ed by all. Now <HI>true</HI> Repentance is Men's <HI>returning</HI> to God, as <HI>their God.</HI> Jer. 3.22. <HI>Behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord</HI> OUR GOD. And if this is <HI>true</HI> Repentance, a <HI>ge∣neral</HI> Faith cannot be <HI>true</HI> Faith, for it will never <HI>produce</HI> this Repentance; because when a Man hath only a <HI>general</HI> Faith, he never sees God to be HIS GOD.</P>
<P>What will a Generalist say here? He can't deny this to be <HI>true</HI> Repentance; and by owning this to be <HI>true</HI> Repen∣tance, he doth really own <HI>his</HI> Faith to be <HI>false</HI> Faith. To save it, he must be forced to <HI>create a new Thing</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A general Faith puts Men upon inventing <HI>new</HI> Articles in Religion, a <HI>new</HI> Faith, a <HI>new</HI> Repentance, and indeed a <HI>new</HI> Bible, no more agreeable to the <HI>Word of God</HI> than the <HI>Alcoran</HI> of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE>; He must say <Q>there are <HI>two Sorts of true</HI> Repentance; and that tho' a Man <HI>truly</HI> repents when he sees God to be <HI>his God,</HI> yet he <HI>may</HI> repent <HI>truly</HI> without <HI>any such Discovery,</HI> and <HI>always doth so at first.</HI></Q></P>
<P>My Bible don't teach me this Divinity; it asserts, there is a <HI>Repentance unto Life,</HI> and supposeth there is a Repentance <HI>not</HI> unto Life: But as to there being <HI>two Sorts</HI> of <HI>Repentance unto Life, essentially</HI> different, as they <HI>must</HI> be, if the <HI>one</HI> is produced by a Man's seeing God to be <HI>his</HI> God, and the <HI>other</HI> without <HI>any such Discovery:</HI> This Divinity, I say, is what I never could find in <HI>my</HI> Bible; nor could they find it in <HI>theirs</HI> were it not that <HI>they want</HI> it, and <HI>can't possibly do without it.</HI></P>
<P>But if they will insist upon it that it is in <HI>their</HI> Bibles: I would ask them what becomes of their <HI>Calvinism</HI> all the while? <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Bible was the same with mine: He never was quick-sighted enough to find any <HI>such</HI> Repentance in <HI>his</HI> Bible: On the contrary, he saith boldly, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See here <HI>Calvinists</HI> against <HI>Calvin</HI> in the Doctrine of Repentance, as well as in the Doctrine of Faith! <HI>Institute Book 3.

If, as they say (and are forc'd to say, or else to let a <HI>general</HI> Faith <HI>breath its last</HI>) a Man may repent <HI>evangelically</HI> without being <HI>led</HI> to it by the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God to <HI>him,</HI> or, which is the same Thing, without seeing God to be <HI>his God;</HI> I would fain know of them what is <HI>legal,</HI> and wherein lies the <HI>essential</HI> Difference between <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>evangelical</HI> Repentance.</P>
<P>Those I have discours'd with, make no tolerable Answer to the Question.—The Task must needs be hard: For they first, in Effect, say there is <HI>no such Thing,</HI> and then undertake to account for the <HI>Existence</HI> of it upon <HI>that Principle.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Fifteenth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A general Faith makes a Man an Opposer of the <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> and <HI>experimental</HI> Religion in the Place where he lives, and as far as he hath any Influence.</P>
<P>If a Man preacheth this Faith, his People are likely to re∣main easy and unmov'd; for almost every one hath gotten this Faith; Or however it appears so easy a Thing to get it, that no one is likely to be much concern'd about it.</P>
<P>Or, if People should by <HI>any</HI> Means be under strong Con∣victions; let them but believe what the Minister preaches to be true, and their Convictions will soon die away.</P>
<P>For, when a Man is under strong Convictions, he don't doubt but Christ is a <HI>general</HI> Saviour: what he wants is, to see Christ to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour: And if the Minister can per∣swade him there is no Need of <HI>this,</HI> the Man grows easy and hath <HI>Peace,</HI> though God hath no Peace for him.</P>
<P>Or, if any of a Minister's Hearers should get a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith, notwithstanding all the Warnings they had heard against it; If in the Midst of their Distress and Despair of helping themselves, the All-sufficiency of Jesus Christ should be discover'd to them by the Spirit of God, making them cry out, at least in their Hearts, <HI>My Lord, and my God!</HI> the Minister must tell them (and others too) that they are deluded. And accordingly, it is observable, that in a late <HI>Declaration</HI> of Ministers, <HI>such</HI> Converts are supposed to be deluded; they give Thanks only for the Conversions of those who had no <HI>such particular</HI> Faith, i. e. in my real Judgment, <HI>only for the Conversions of those who never were converted.</HI></P>

<P>This is what leads the <HI>Van</HI> in Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s invincible <HI>Ar∣mada,</HI> and in which those who are <HI>likeminded</HI> seem most to glory: but to glory in this, is to glory in a <HI>Thing of nought;</HI> for it only confutes an Opinion which <HI>we</HI> hold not, but ab∣hor, <HI>viz.</HI> that all Men should be pressed to believe Christ and Forgiveness are <HI>theirs,</HI> i. e. <HI>in Possession:</HI> What <HI>we</HI> hold is that all Men should be <HI>pressed to believe</HI> that Christ and For∣giveness are <HI>theirs,</HI> not <HI>in Possession</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">'Tis <HI>this Way,</HI> the learned <HI>WENDELIN</HI> evades the Force of the <HI>same Sort</HI> of <HI>Popish</HI> Objection which Mr. <HI>FIRMIN</HI> here brings against a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>Protestant</HI> Faith.

<PB N="36" REF="005568_0035_10186AB395963AD8"/>'tis the not attending to this just Distinction, which gives Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s Argument all the Credit it hath in the World.</P>
<P>To press all Men to believe that Christ and Forgiveness are <HI>theirs,</HI> i. e. <HI>in Right</HI> and by God's <HI>Grant,</HI> is so far from pressing them to <HI>believe a Lie,</HI> that it is pressing them to <HI>be∣lieve a great Gospel-Truth,</HI> or rather the <HI>Truth of the Gospel.</HI> For, <HI>What saith the Scripture?</HI> Why, <HI>that God sent his Son to be the Saviour of the World;</HI> (Joh. 4.14.) that <HI>he gave him for a Covenant of the People, and for a Light to the Gentiles;</HI> (Isa.42.6.) that <HI>whosoever will may come, and take of the Waters of Life freely,</HI> (Rev. 22.17.) Nay, Christ saith, <HI>Look unto me, and be ye saved all the Ends of the Earth,</HI> Isai. 45.22.</P>
<P>Now all these and such like Declarations shew us that Christ is <HI>by Office,</HI> whatever he is <HI>in the Event, the Saviour of every Man:</HI> that one Man hath as much <HI>Right</HI> as another to <HI>lay hold on eternal Life,</HI> and that <HI>all</HI> Men are <HI>warranted</HI> and <HI>commanded</HI> so to do in the Word of God. The Matter may be illustrated in the following Manner. — Suppose a King, in Consideration of his Son's <HI>Mediation</HI> in behalf of certain condemned Traitors, obliges himself to bestow his Pardon and Favour upon those who will come to him, and receive such Kindness at his Hands, — Have not all those Traitors a <HI>Right,</HI> and one just as good a <HI>Right</HI> as another to the King's Pardon and Favour? And would it be absurd in any one to press them to believe they had such a <HI>Right,</HI> and to make use of it? And if any stood out, while it was too late and miss'd of it, would not their <HI>Blood be upon their own Heads?</HI> most cer∣tainly. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life,</HI> saith our Saviour, John 5.40. i. e. Eternal Life is <HI>yours,</HI> by God's Grant, but ye will not accept of it, and so <HI>must</HI> perish!</P>
<P>Tho' there is a secret <HI>Decree</HI> of God, yet this Matter should be consider'd <HI>abstractly,</HI> as if there were none at all: I mean, we should not <HI>limit</HI> God's <HI>Grant</HI> by any <HI>Decree.</HI> Accordingly it is observable, that tho' the Apostle fully believed the De∣crees of God, yet they preached Christ and Salvation by him as <HI>freely</HI> as if they knew every one of their Hearers to be e∣lected. Thus have I fairly dismiss'd this Argument by shew∣ing that it confutes not what we maintain, but only what we abhor as well as they.</P>
<P>However, if the Objecters are not quite weaned from it, I would mention one thing more which will spoil it forever for <HI>their Use;</HI> and that is, it concludes as strongly against <HI>their</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="005568_0036_10186AB780ECE870"/>Faith as it doth against <HI>ours:</HI> Nay, it concludes against all Faith but the Faith of <HI>Devils</HI> and those who are in <HI>Despair,</HI> whose Faith is that Jesus Christ <HI>is really the Saviour of Sinners, but they have no Lot nor Inheritance in him.</HI> I say this <HI>Dreadful</HI> Faith, is what alone can stand the Force of this Argument: for, as <HI>we</HI> press all Men to a <HI>particular</HI> Faith that Christ and his Be∣nefits are <HI>theirs,</HI> they press all Men to a <HI>general</HI> Belief of the same Thing: Neither <HI>we</HI> nor <HI>they</HI> are free from pressing them to expect <HI>some</HI> Benefit by Christ, whereas <HI>most</HI> Men not being elected will receive <HI>no</HI> Benefit by him: So that even they themselves, by their own Argument, <HI>press most Men to believe a Lie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s II. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"That which makes the Essence of saving Faith, to lye, or subsist only in an Act of the Understanding, that is not the Essence of saving Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But to make the Essence of saving Faith to lye in a particu∣lar Persuasion, or Assurance that Christ is mine, Forgiveness mine, is to make the Essence of saving Faith to lye, or sub∣sist only in an Act of the Understanding.</HI></P>
<P>Ergo,— <HI>The particular Persuasion or Assurance Christ is mine,</HI> &amp;c.— <HI>is not the Essence of saving Faith.</HI></P>
<P>It would be worth while for those who think there is any Force in this Argument, against <HI>our particular</HI> Faith, to try the Force of it against that <HI>general</HI> Faith which is maintain∣ed by <HI>them. They</HI> make a <HI>general</HI> Persuasion of For∣giveness of Sins thro' Christ, to be of the <HI>Essence</HI> of saving Faith, just as much as <HI>we</HI> do a <HI>particular</HI> Persuasion; and therefore if we are <HI>hereby</HI> guilty of making the Essence of sa∣ving Faith to <HI>lie,</HI> or <HI>subsist only in an Act of the Understand∣ing,</HI> they themselves are <HI>verily guilty in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>they</HI> say in <HI>their</HI> Defence, that tho' they make a <HI>general</HI> Persuasion of Forgiveness of Sins thro' Christ to be of the <HI>Essence</HI> of saving Faith, <HI>they</HI> don't mean that <HI>this</HI> is <HI>all</HI> that is <HI>essential</HI> to it, it being essential to <HI>true</HI> Faith to <HI>purify the Heart,</HI> and reform the Life: This is the very same Thing <HI>we</HI> have to say in <HI>our</HI> Defence; so that the same sort of Rea∣soning which will clear <HI>them</HI> from the Force of their <HI>own</HI> Argument, will clear us too.</P>
<P>The Truth is, Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s second Argument, (like his first) is a <HI>meer Sophism;</HI> it confutes only this Opinion, <HI>viz. That all that is essential to saving Faith is to believe Christ and
<PB N="38" REF="005568_0037_10186AB973346218"/>Forgiveness to be ours.</HI> But did Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Perkins,</HI> and other holy Men he is disputing against, maintain this? Those Divines would have owned this a <HI>Damnable Error,</HI> instead of saying one Word <HI>for</HI> it. 'Tis <HI>one</HI> Thing to say that 'tis <HI>essential</HI> to saving Faith for a Man to believe <HI>Christ and Forgiveness to be his; Another</HI> to say that <HI>this</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is <HI>essential</HI> to saving Faith: Tho' the Propositions don't differ so much <HI>in Sound,</HI> they differ <HI>in Sense,</HI> as far as the <HI>East</HI> is from the <HI>West:</HI> And had Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> observed this, he would never have troubled himself to have written <HI>down his</HI> second Argument.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s III. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"That which is not cross to the corrupt Heart of Man; nor doth directly empty a Man of himself, that cannot be the Essence of saving Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the particular Perswasion that Christ is mine, the Assurance my Sins are forgiven, is not cross to the corrupt Heart of Man, nor doth directly empty a Man of himself.</HI> Ergo, <HI>the particular Perswasion and Assurance that Christ is mine, is not the Essence of saving Faith."</HI></P>
<P>What did Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> mean by this Argument? His minor Proposition, the Support of all, is so far from being <HI>true,</HI> that the <HI>contrary</HI> Proposition is an infallible Truth, viz. That the only Reason why all that have heard the <HI>joyful Sound,</HI> don't believe assuredly that Christ and Forgiveness are <HI>theirs,</HI> is because this is <HI>contrary</HI> to their <HI>corrupt Hearts,</HI> and they are not <HI>emptied of themselves.</HI> God gives Christ, and all his Benefits to <HI>every</HI> Sinner, to whom the Gospel comes, <HI>for nothing at all;</HI> he <HI>justifies the Ungodly;</HI> the very <HI>Chief of Sinners</HI> are welcome to the <HI>Waters of Life:</HI> Why then don't they believe Christ and his Benefits are really <HI>theirs,</HI> according to God's <HI>Grant</HI> made to <HI>them?</HI> This <HI>must</HI> be re∣solved into their <HI>Carnality</HI> and <HI>Selfishness;</HI> or, as Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> expresseth it, the <HI>evil Self,</HI> and <HI>good Self</HI> which reign in them. Were it not for <HI>these</HI> all <HI>Christendom</HI> would <HI>fly</HI> to Christ <HI>in A Moment,</HI> in the <HI>twinkling of an Eye,</HI> with a <HI>MY LORD AND MY GOD.</HI> But alas! far the greater Part are <HI>carnal,</HI> and <HI>sold under Sin;</HI> they are <HI>whole,</HI> and don't <HI>need the Phy∣sician;</HI> let who will take Christ and his Benefits <HI>for them;</HI> especially since one main Benefit is to save People from those very Sins they are resolved not to part with.</P>
<P>And as for those who are <HI>pricked at the Heart,</HI> and enquiring
<PB N="39" REF="005568_0038_10186ABB6D205288"/><HI>what they shall do to be saved; they</HI> stumble at this <HI>Stumbling-Stone,</HI> that <HI>Salvation</HI> should be <HI>quite free,</HI> that Christ and his Benefits should be <HI>theirs</HI> without any <HI>Money,</HI> and without any <HI>Price.</HI> The Law being written on our Hearts, we <HI>naturally</HI> think this is good Divinity that God will not <HI>clear the Guilty,</HI> nor <HI>justify</HI> any but <HI>the Godly:</HI> (here is the Foundation of <HI>Arminianism!</HI>) Wherefore when such Persons are told from the Word of God, that he doth <HI>clear the Guilty</HI> for the Sake of <HI>another</HI> only, and that those who <HI>now</HI> are <HI>Ungodly,</HI> may be received <HI>immediately</HI> into God's everlasting Embraces; it seems to them a <HI>Thing incredible,</HI> and they <HI>make God a Liar</HI> by not <HI>believing the Report:</HI> Nor, can they believe this <HI>Pa∣radox</HI> to be a <HI>real</HI> Truth, any more than they can believe that <HI>two and two make five,</HI> 'till God by his Spirit shews them that their <HI>own Righteousness,</HI> is but as <HI>filthy Rags</HI> in his Sight.</P>
<P>But, being convinc'd of <HI>this,</HI> the Scales fall from their Eyes, the <HI>glorious Gospel</HI> shines into their Souls, and they see the Truth of <HI>such</HI> Declarations of <HI>free Grace,</HI> and conse∣quently, that though they are <HI>so bad,</HI> Christ is <HI>nevertheless theirs,</HI> and Forgiveness <HI>theirs.</HI> I say, <HI>Consequently:</HI> For 'tis impossible any one should receive the <HI>free</HI> Declarations of the Gospel <HI>as the Word of God,</HI> and yet be <HI>in the Dark</HI> about his <HI>own Soul:</HI> For he that believes the <HI>Chief of Sinners</HI> are welcome, <HI>can't help</HI> seeing that <HI>he</HI> is welcome: He that hear∣tily believes God <HI>justifieth</HI> the <HI>Ungodly,</HI> can't question God's Favour to <HI>him</HI> though <HI>ungodly:</HI> In a Word, Sin being the only Thing which makes any jealous of the Love of God; when they see this <HI>Wall of Partition broken down,</HI> so that Sin is <HI>no Impediment at all,</HI> but Sinners are in as good a Case as if they had never sin'd, having <HI>such an High Priest;</HI> I say, when Men see <HI>this</HI> (and they always see this, only when the <HI>Gospel</HI> is <HI>hid</HI> from them) they can't be jealous of the Love of God towards <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>This, I think is <HI>fair, evangelical</HI> Reasoning: And if it is, then Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s third Argument may be made Use of to <HI>establish</HI> that very Faith, which he intended to overthrow by it: And we may conclude it to be <HI>true, saving</HI> Faith, because it is so contrary to <HI>Carnality</HI> and <HI>Self-Righteousness,</HI> that it <HI>can't be,</HI> where <HI>these prevail,</HI> and <HI>can't but be,</HI> where <HI>these</HI> are <HI>subdu'd.</HI></P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> proves nothing by this Argument, because he doth not prove his minor Proposition. Indeed, 'tis <HI>incapable of Proof,</HI> unless Men had, (which they have not) an infalli∣ble Knowledge of the Hearts of others.</P>
<P>As to the Case of <HI>Infants,</HI> which he mentions, any one may see that they may as easily be supposed to have a <HI>par∣ticular</HI> Faith in Christ as a <HI>general</HI> one: So that this Objec∣tion is no stronger against <HI>our</HI> Faith, than it is against <HI>his</HI> And as to <HI>adult</HI> Persons; tho' there be but few, that have a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith, that Christ is <HI>their</HI> Saviour; we know there are but <HI>few that shall be saved.</HI> However, there is no Doubt but there are thousands and thousands of Persons, who, tho' they have not a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>unshaken Assu∣rance,</HI> do yet more <HI>weakly</HI> and <HI>interruptedly,</HI> believe Christ to be <HI>their</HI> Saviour, and that all his Benefits <HI>belong</HI> to them.

<P>If Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> meant that that cannot be the Essence of <HI>saving Faith,</HI> which is not always constant and abiding so long as a Man is a Believer, at least, <HI>in Habit;</HI> his <HI>major</HI> Proposition is an undoubted Truth: To suppose orherwise, would be to suppose a Man might be a <HI>true Believer,</HI> and an Unbeliever too at the same Time. But then, what will become of his minor? viz. That <HI>the particular Perswasion and Assurance that Christ is mine, is not always abiding so much as in Habit as long as I am a Believer.</HI> For a Cessation of <HI>Acts</HI> will by no Means prove there is <HI>no Habit</HI> remaining.</P>
<P>The Men with whom I have to do, will grant that a Man may be said to have been a <HI>true</HI> Lover of God for many Years together, tho' a great Part of his Time God was not <HI>in his Thoughts,</HI> and when he did think of him, he generally look'd upon, and fear'd him as an Enemy; be∣cause <HI>all that Time,</HI> there was the <HI>Habit</HI> of Love which would have been drawn forth into delightful <HI>Acts,</HI> had the Lets and Hindrances been taken away. I say those who are for a <HI>general</HI> Faith, and yet are any Thing like <HI>Cal∣vinists</HI> will grant this: And <HI>this</HI> is, in Effect, to grant there may be the <HI>Habit</HI> of <HI>Assurance</HI> in a Man, tho' by Reason of <HI>Lets</HI> and Hindrances from the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> this <HI>Habit</HI> may be very seldom drawn forth into <HI>Acts,</HI> especially <HI>continued</HI> and <HI>strong</HI> Acts from which all doubting is remov'd.</P>
<P>But, if Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> should be understood as asserting that the Essence of saving Faith is always lasting and abiding as long as a Man is a Believer, not <HI>in Habit</HI> only, but <HI>in Act</HI> and Exercise; then he destroys his <HI>own</HI> Faith, as well as that he intended to destroy: Nay, <HI>all</HI> saving Faith is at <HI>this Rate</HI> a meer <HI>Nonentity,</HI> and <HI>Chimera,</HI> since there is none which will agree to his Definition. For, let the Essence of saving Faith, lie in what it will; in believing Christ to be a <HI>general,</HI> or a <HI>particular</HI> Saviour, good Men when exer∣cised with Atheistical Thoughts (not to mention other Impediments) don't believe him to be any Saviour at all. This Thing is either so, or not: At such Times the <HI>Ex∣ercise</HI> of Faith is interrupted, or it is not: It belongs to those who value this Argument to own, or deny. If they own it is interrupted, they give up their Cause: If they
<PB N="42" REF="005568_0041_10186AC47545DCF8"/>deny it, they join with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and run headlong into the Doctrine of <HI>Perfection.</HI></P>

<P>This is one of Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s most plausible Arguments.

<P>"That cannot <HI>be the Essence of saving Faith, which lea∣veth a true Believer sinking under the Sense of his Sin, and Misery, without Support.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this particular Perswasion and Assurance, Christ is mine (affirmed to be saving Faith) leaves a true Believer under the Sense of his Sin and Misery, without Support.</HI> Ergo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P>
<P>We own the Charge Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> brings against a <HI>parti∣cular</HI> Faith, and <HI>glory</HI> in it too: Nay we should not think it worth having, if we could not say the same Thing in <HI>Favour</HI> of it, which he saith against it, viz. <HI>That it leaves all Sorts of Persons, sinking under a Sense of their Sin and Misery, without any Support,</HI> i. e. without any Support of
<PB N="43" REF="005568_0042_10186AC647592A20"/>their <HI>own Righteousness</HI> to lean upon. Nor do we fear their <HI>sinking,</HI> since they will only <HI>sink</HI> into the Arms of Christ, into which if they are kept from <HI>sinking</HI> by <HI>such Supports,</HI> they must one Day <HI>sink</HI> into Hell.</P>
<P>That <HI>all</HI> convinced Sinners would <HI>immediately</HI> be <HI>sure</HI> that Christ and Forgiveness are <HI>theirs,</HI> were it not for their <HI>own Righteousness,</HI> which they lean upon, I think is evi∣dent from what hath been said upon the IIId Argument. However, if any are not satisfied with what is written there; I would ask them whether every Man who be∣lieves there is a God, doth not always believe there is <HI>some</HI> Way into his Favour, either <HI>by Works,</HI> or <HI>without Works:</HI> To this they must say <HI>Yes;</HI> and this is, in Ef∣fect, giving up the Point: For when a Sinner is hear∣tily convinc'd that the Way into God's Favour is not <HI>by Works,</HI> then he sees it is <HI>without Works;</HI> and when he sees it is without Works, he <HI>cannot help</HI> seeing that <HI>he</HI> is welcome to the Favour of God, <HI>just as he is,</HI> without any <HI>Alteration</HI> in him. This must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be fair Reasoning: And if it is, then it is plain that all the Support which any have without seeing Christ to be <HI>their</HI> Saviour, and <HI>Forgiveness theirs,</HI> is only a Support of their <HI>own Righteousness;</HI> and consequently that this Argument of Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s also, establishes the Faith he in∣tended to destroy by it; and we may conclude it to be <HI>true</HI> Faith, because it doth not, like <HI>theirs,</HI> speak any Comfort to Men while they lean upon their <HI>own Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Before I dismiss this Argument, I would observe that 'tis calculated, as much against <HI>Calvin,</HI> as if Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> had had <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Eye, and intended a Confutation of him.—<HI>Calvin</HI> saith, that <Q>the Consciences of the faithful when the <HI>Affiance</HI> of their Justification before God is to be sought, should raise themselves above the Law, and forget the whole Righteousness of the Law, and lay aside all thinking upon Works. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inst. Pag. <HI>403.</HI></NOTE></Q> But <HI>this</HI> Divinity Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Argument, and what he saith <HI>upon it,</HI> makes to be Heresy: <HI>He</HI> would have distressed Souls <HI>keep close to the Law,</HI> and not forget the Righteousness of it: He would have others comfort them with Marks and Signs (by which Means they are often comforted into Hell) though the poor Souls don't see that Jesus Christ is <HI>their</HI> Saviour, and that all his Benefits belong to <HI>them.</HI> And yet Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> was a <HI>Calvinist!</HI> Nay, the <HI>Generality</HI> so

<P>Thus have we fairly try'd a general Faith at the Bar of Scripture and Reason, having examin'd many Evidences <HI>for</HI> it, and <HI>against</HI> it; and upon the whole, it appears, that it is so far from <HI>justifying,</HI> that 'tis only <HI>Christ-despi∣sing, Man-exalting,</HI> and <HI>Soul-condemning</HI> Faith; for which Reason it ought itself to be <HI>condemned,</HI> and <HI>sentenced to die the Death.</HI> And would to God that the <HI>Sentence</HI> might <HI>speedily be executed!</HI> O that Believers would join their Forces together, and <HI>pray it to Death:</HI> May we all with one Heart, and one Soul, besiege the Throne of Grace, and give God <HI>no Rest,</HI> 'till he <HI>destroy.</HI> it out of the World, by the <HI>Breath of his Mouth, and the Brightness of his Appearing.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Conclusion of the whole Matter,</HI> shall be to exhort every one into whose Hands this little Book may come, not to be so cruel to his own Soul, as to venture it any longer upon a <HI>general</HI> Faith; But to see to it, that he hath a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>assured</HI> Faith, that Christ is <HI>his</HI> Saviour, and that all his Benefits do really belong to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I know the World hates the Doctrine of <HI>Assurance</HI> (per∣haps all the Errors and Imprudences that have been in the Land these few Years past, have not vext the World so much as this one <HI>glorious</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Assurance,</HI> which they have heard so often ringing in their Ears:) Because it <HI>con∣demns</HI> the World; because this <HI>Light</HI> being held up against their Religion, discovers it to be <HI>Darkness:</HI> And hence it is that many who love the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>Protestant</HI> Ministers, are full as bad as the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Jesuits</HI> themselves, in prejudi∣cing their Hearers against the <HI>full Assurance of Faith.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Jesuits</HI> say, that the Apostles themselves, were not quite sure of their own Salvation; and that Christians now a days, must not think of having <HI>full Assurance;</HI> for this would be to go beyond the Apostles. <HI>Rhem.

<P>Methinks I hear some poor Souls saying: <Q>If we had a Thousand Worlds, we would part with them all, for this <HI>Assurance</HI> of which you are speaking.</Q> I answer; I wish you were willing to have it <HI>for Nothing:</HI> Do but let go your own Righteousness, and I dare pawn my Soul, that you shall have it before I have done speaking with you. <HI>Come now, let us reason together:</HI> What is the Difficulty, what is the <HI>Wall of Partition</HI> that lies in the Way to your having <HI>Assurance?</HI> Is it that you are old Sinners, great Sinners, <HI>Sinners against God exceedingly?</HI> Why, my dear Friends, Sin is <HI>no Impediment</HI> at all; you have no more Reason to doubt of God's good Will towards you, than if you had never sinn'd, you are in as good a Case as if you had never offended him, in Thought, in Word, or in Deed, <HI>having such an High-Priest:</HI> Though your Sins <HI>have abounded,</HI> the Grace of God hath <HI>a∣bounded much more;</HI> though your Sins have reached unto the very Heavens, the Mercy of God in Christ is <HI>above the Hea∣vens.</HI> Indeed, was <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> but a <HI>little</HI> Saviour, there would be good Reason for <HI>great</HI> Sinners to be afraid; nay, I my self should not have one Thought of being saved by him.

<P>And every Doubt you have of Christ's Willingness, is only doubting whether he is a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, and whether the <HI>Re∣cord</HI>

So that hereby, you make God a Liar and Jesus Christ but a <HI>little</HI> Saviour, and conse∣quently deserve to be sent to Hell for every Doubt you have. <Q>Don't think to excuse your selves, by saying you don't doubt of <HI>God's Faithfulness,</HI> nor of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Ability</HI> to save Sinners, but that all the Difficulty lies in believing that such Sinners as you, are really <HI>qualified</HI> to be sav'd by him.</Q> This is only deceiving your own Hearts, or rather, not ob∣serving the <HI>Deceitfulness</HI> of your own Hearts: For instead of doubting whether <HI>you</HI> are <HI>qualified</HI> to be sav'd by Christ, you are only doubting whether <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>qualified</HI> to save <HI>you:</HI> Did you but <HI>see him qualified,</HI> you could not help seeing <HI>yourselves qualified;</HI> it being impossible that any one should question whether <HI>he</HI> is <HI>qualified</HI> to be sav'd by a Saviour who is <HI>willing</HI> as well as <HI>able,</HI> to save the very <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI> just as they are, before there is any <HI>Alteration</HI> in them. Your Want of <HI>Assurance</HI> therefore is founded upon this very Thing, viz. Your having a mean Opinion of him whom <HI>Man despiseth, and the Nations abhor;</HI> you dare not stand before God, in his Name <HI>as Sinners,</HI> but only as Saints: Whereas did you be∣lieve in your Hearts, that he was able to save to the <HI>utter∣most,</HI> you could not help seeing <HI>in him</HI> a Saviour for <HI>your∣selves:</HI> And though you knew you deserved to be sent to Hell, you could not have one Doubt, of the Mercy and Lovingkindness of God towards <HI>you.</HI> And O that God would anoint your Eyes <HI>with Eye-salve,</HI> that the <HI>glorious Go∣spel</HI> which <HI>shines</HI> round about you; might <HI>shine</HI> into your Souls: That you might see <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be your Saviour, and by the <HI>Sight</HI> be transformed into his Likeness. I say <HI>transformed into his Likeness:</HI> For one can't see the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ, without being <HI>like</HI> him, when the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> of God our Saviour appears to <HI>us,</HI> it <HI>always renews us in the Spirit of our Minds,</HI> making us as Jesus Christ was <HI>holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from Sinners:</HI> Which <HI>precious Faith,</HI> God of his infinite Mercy, grant may be vouchsafed to every one of my Readers for Jesus Christ his Sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
