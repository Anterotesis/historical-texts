<HEAD>A brief and sorrowful Account of the present State of the Churches in NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Beauty and Strength of a Community (especially Ecclesiastical) consists in nothing more, than in the Harmony of it's Members. This has been the dis∣tinguishing Glory of the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches in general, from the Days of our Fore-fathers, who, under GOD, planted the Gospel at the Peril of their Lives, in this <HI>American</HI> Wilderness.</P>
<P>But now, alas too soon! Strife and Contention is come upon us like a Flood, which threatens the overthrow of all Order, and the utter subver∣sion of our Gospel Constitution. This gives us Occasion to take up the Lamen∣tation as of old and say, <HI>How is the Gold become dim, and the fine Gold changed? How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of Zion with a Cloud in his Anger, and cast down from Heaven to the Earth the Beauty of Israel? The Crown is fallen from our Head, wo to us that we have sinned!</HI> But is our Con∣dition now indeed such, that there are none of the Sons which we have brought up, found worthy to lead us by the Hand and give Conduct to these Churches in this gloomy Day? Or shall we resign them up to Stran∣gers, and set <HI>them</HI> at the Head of the Ministry and our religious Affairs? Shall we imitate the Jewish Church in her Times of Degeneracy, and abundantly replenish our selves from the East and other Quarters (tho' not with profess'd Soothsayers, yet) with enthusiastick and erroneous Itinerant Preachers, and Tribes of publick Exhorters? It is an Error easily imbib'd and practis'd upon, for Persons to value themselves and others on Account of sudden Impressions and Impulses on the Mind, placing these in the room of the immediate Dictates and Influences of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> tho' they have no Foundation in the Word of God to support them; but are the Effect of their own over-heated Imaginations, and vain Conceit of their superiour
<PB N="4" REF="005667_0003_1026B9B1DD844A28"/>Attainments in Knowledge and Experience of the Spirit's Operation. And this self exalting Opinion leads Men to censure and condemn those as carnal and unconverted, who don't gratify their Ambition, and give them the Pre eminence above all that are not in their Way of thinking, how∣ever otherwise distinguish'd in Station, Piety and Accomplishments. How applicable to such Men is the Parable, which our Saviour spake <HI>concerning those who trusted in themselves that they were Righteous, and despis'd others?</HI></P>
<P>And how lamentable are the Wounds and bitter Effects which this Spirit has already produc'd among Us! And what a formidable Appearance of still greater Misery! Whilst Party is engag'd against Party, Ministers against Ministers, Churches against Churches; open Violations of solemn Church-Covenants are become common, and , with some, commendable; Church-Members censuring, judging and walking with Slanders against one another; Party Councils are call'd to oppose each other, according to the different Denominations and Sentiments of the Parties inviting them: There have been some Instances in these Times of Husbands who have forsaken their own lawful Wives, with whom they have liv'd in Love and Peace, alledging that such indeed are their carnal Wives, but as they think them unconverted, they reject them, supposing it to be warrantable and expedient to frequent the Company of other Women of the like pretended extraordinary Illumination.</P>
<P>Thus Communion of Churches is in a great degree lost, the beautiful Harmony of Ministers, as Fellow-helpers in their Work, turn'd too much into party Views and Strangeness one towards another; the religious Order of Families turn'd out of Doors, the Honour and Duty of Children to Parents, Servants to Masters is neglected, and Reverence due to the Aged and Honourable is cast behind our Backs. <HI>For these Things fearful∣ness and trembling is come upon us; the Ways of Zion do mourn, her Priests sigh, her Virgins are afflicted and she is in bitterness, for her Beauty is de∣parted, and Shame hath covered her Face.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis easy to point out the Troublers of our Peace and former happy Union. Every Man that will judge impartially and free from design, knows that the Rev. Messirs. <HI>Whitefield, Tennant, Davenport,</HI> and other Itinerants, with the many Exhorters under their Influence, have thrown us into this Convulsion and heat of Contention. Which plainly appears, in the first Place, from Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Conduct.</P>
<P>As soon as this Gentleman mounted the Stage here, he liberally threw out his Censures upon the Ministers, Colleges and Churches. The gene∣rality <HI>of the Ministers preaching an unknown, unfelt Christ; that they were dead Men, which was the Reason of the deadness of their Congregations in
<PB N="5" REF="005667_0004_1026B9B460078620"/>Matters of Religion.</HI> vid. <HI>N. E.</HI> Journ. p. 70, 71. Thus assuming to him∣self GOD's Prerogative, who claims it as his peculiar to know the Heart. The Disciples of CHRIST, tho' conversant with <HI>Judas</HI> the whole Term of our Saviour's publick Ministry on Earth, did not know <HI>Judas</HI> to be an un∣converted Man and a Traytor, 'till he discovered it; but were all ready to suspect themselves rather than him: They received <HI>Simon Magus</HI> into their Number as a true Believer, till he offer'd Money to purchase the Gifts of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> Now can it be suppos'd on any rational Grounds that Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or any others of like Pretences at this Day, are en∣dowed with greater Gifts of the Spirit, so as to be able to know what others feel of the Spirit of <HI>CHRIST</HI> in their Souls, and venture to publish it to the World, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has done? This is the Man that brought this Spirit of pretended Penetration into this Land. And with what an amazing Spread has it gained Proselytes in every Quarter? Some of whom pretend to determine the State of every Person they meet at first Sight: Others more cautious judge by comparing Experiences, still making their own Experiences the Standard by which others must be tried. This Officiousness of Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> we have paid dear for, but what it may yet cost us none can foresee.</P>
<P>What can we think this Gentleman means? Would he have us be∣lieve that in this he acted the Part of a Minister of CHRIST, or a Christian? Was it from the Dictates and Direction of the Spirit of GOD he spake thus? <HI>That</HI> could not be, for the Spirit of Truth can't contradict it self; and the Spirit expresly tells us that <HI>him that soweth Discord among Brethren, God hates,</HI> Prov. 6.19. And we are strictly forbidden <HI>to receive an Accusation, against an Elder, but before two or three Witnesses,</HI> 1 Tim 5.19. If we are <HI>not to take up</HI> an Accusation against a Minister, but with a Proviso, much less may we <HI>publish</HI> it. Was it possible for Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> to produce authentick Vouchers to support his Charges against our Ministers, Colleges and Churches? No, verily. Nay, if all the invidious and disaffected Per∣sons in the Land, had come from all Parts with their united Complaints against their Ministers, yet it was impossible for him (a perfect Stranger in the Country, and but a little while with us) to form an adequate Judge∣ment on the State of Persons and Things, so as to justify the Accusations he has brought against them. Will Scripture, Reason or civil Justice countenance such Conduct in <HI>any Man</HI> however otherwise fam'd? Does not this Gentleman arrogate to himself a super-intendancy, the Authority of Dictator-general, and a Power so absolute that <HI>whom he will be sets up, and whom he will be pulls down.</HI> What an unbecoming Slight does he
<PB N="6" REF="005667_0005_1026B9B5E88FC618"/>put on the Ministers in general, however deserving, except some few who are in a sort canonized in his Journal? But his Authority in this and his Itinerancy (as by him manag'd) we deny, because not commanded: For what is not appointed in the Word of GOD, in Matter, of Religion and Order, is a Degree of Idolatry, and forbidden in the second Com∣mandment.</P>
<P>Did Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> intend thus to <HI>smite the Shepherds, that the Sheep might be scattered?</HI> If so, he may behold with Satisfaction (if any can be had in it) that his Designs are wonderfully succeeded in the present scattered State of our Churches, from the Prejudices which he has instilled into the Minds of many against their own Pastors and Brethren.</P>
<P>Moreover, This Gentleman's Conduct is the more exceptionable, for that many of those Ministers whom he has so liberally loaded with Infamy and Contempt, are Gentlemen whose Characters have been established in the Consciences of all that knew them, for their Soundness in the Faith, and good Example of Life, and that for more Years than he has liv'd in the World, their Enemies themselves being Judges, 'till he had prejudic'd their Minds by his evil Insinuations. Yet these good Men are now loaded with manifold Calumny, under which they go heavily and hardly bestead, in an advanced Age, <HI>because Reproach has broken their Bones;</HI> the Re∣proaches not of Strangers only, but their Brethren in the Ministry, and in their Communion also: And now they have but little prospect of healing, and expect to live in a great Measure useless, and then go to their Graves with the bleeding Wounds of this Gentleman's censorious Pen, and the Reproaches of Exhorters and others which have fallen upon them.</P>
<P>What an assuming Temper does Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> also shew in condemning our College? vid. Journ. p. 96. When he says, <HI>"their Light is become Darkness, Darkness that may be felt."</HI> This is a sad Reproach upon a Society which GOD has remarkably smil'd on, and made a rich Blessing; from whence has issued a Succession of able and faithful Ministers, for the Sup∣ply of these Churches for a Century of Years, without Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Assistance: But we trust GOD will appear in the Behalf of our Colleges, and wipe off the Aspersions cast upon them, and still continue them rich Seminaries of Piety and Learning. What can be the Design of this Gentleman in publishing such Representations of our Colleges, unless it be to induce us to content ourselves with illiterate and enthusiastick Exhor∣ters, whom he or his Friends have set up, 'till we can be supplied from <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, the Orphan-House in Georgia,</HI> or <HI>the Shepherd's Tent?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005667_0006_1026B9B7B75B91E0"/>
But as pressing Representations and just Complaints have been published on these Heads, by the Governours of our Colleges, united Associations of Ministers, and several of our Rev. and aged Fathers separately: I shall only Remark at present, that it is the Opinion of many, that since Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> has not manifested his Repentance for the Offences he stands charged with, tho' call'd to it from all Quarters, he therefore stands indited, <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro Ecclesiae,</HI> and in the Memory and just Resentment of all that act up to the Rules of Gospel-Discipline, for rash Judging and Slander. They think he has been guilty of a Breach of the ninth Commandment, or in other Words, <HI>has born false Witness</HI> (as is sometimes said) <HI>with a witness.</HI></P>
<P>And then as tho' Mr. <HI>W.</HI> had not sufficiently broken our Churches, we were soon visited by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent;</HI> who was sent by him, and redoubled his Aspersions on the Ministry; yet not with so much Openess in these Parts, as he has done in his <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon, wherein he declares <HI>the Body of the Clergy of this Generation to be un∣converted.</HI> And that he might the more effectually promote Divisions among us, did, in his publick Exercises at <HI>Boston,</HI> thank GOD for the Divisions which began to appear there, and pray'd they might be increas'd as an hopeful Omen of an happy Reformation. As if the People were <HI>Barbarians</HI> or <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and needed now by him to be taught the first Principles of the Oracles of GOD. That he was of such a divisive Tem∣per, his Sermon on unconverted Ministers is a sufficient Proof. His Words are these, <HI>Pag.</HI> 12, 13, <Q>GOD's People have a Right to all GOD's Ministers; why mayn't they use them as they have Opportu∣nity? And if they should go a few Miles further than ordinary to enjoy those they Profit most by, whom do they wrong?</Q> This was a Lesson of Indulgence so pleasing to the Disaffected, that they soon put it in Practice, and thereupon separated themselves from their Pastors and Brethren in greater Numbers than before, persisting in it as laudable and a Duty from this Act of Toleration and Advice.</P>
<P>He then draws a Comparison from the less to the greater, <HI>viz.</HI> From the irrational Creatures, the Beasts, Birds and Fishes, which are led by an instinct in Nature, to seek the Food which they like best▪ A weak Way of arguing indeed! (however plausible it may appear to some) to make Men as disorderly and voracious as the wild Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, who bite and prey upon one another. This indeed is too much our Manner at present, and is encouraged by many who take Sanctuary under the Sentiments of those Gentlemen I have mention'd and others of the like divisive Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005667_0007_1026B9BAC593B048"/>
The Rev Mr. <HI>James Davenport,</HI> in Succession, made a Visit also to these Parts of the Country, deem'd to be a Man full of the Spirit, as indeed he was of the like censorious, judging and uncharitable Spirit: But he did not care to take Things meerly upon trust and evil Suspicion, as others had done before him; and therefore proceeded to a formal Examination into the Experiences of Ministers, in order to form a right Judgment of their State, and whether they preach'd an unknown unfelt CHRIST, or not. But because of this and other such like Steps, and being apprehended to be under a deep Tincture of Enthusiasm, he had not Admission into the Gentlemen's Pulpits at <HI>Boston,</HI> which 'tis probable he and others expected. And 'tis thought by many that if there had been the like Caution with Respect to the former Gentlemen, the Prospect of Peace in our Churches would have been more hopeful than now it is like to be. When Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> first came among us the Expectations of many were rais'd to an high Degree; but by reason of his enthusiastick Conduct here, and his burning the Books at <HI>New-London,</HI> and his partial Retractations, most of his Admirers have chang'd their Minds, and call him delirious, or an Apostate, or both.</P>
<P>If these Gentlemen had supported their Conduct by divine Revelation, it would not have been wonder'd at, that they had so many Admirers: But as they bring no stronger Testimony than their own bare Word, and the Measures which they have taken are so contrary to the known Rules of the Gospel,—we say, — <HI>Let God be true, but every Man a Liar. To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.</HI></P>
<P>But as these two Gentlemen Messirs. <HI>Tennent</HI> and <HI>Davenport</HI> have pub∣lished some Retractations on these Heads, I shall leave them at present, more seriously and penitently to reflect on the Hurt they have done to Religion, the Ministry and the Order of our Churches, wishing that they and all other Itinerants and publick Exhorters which they have dextrously promoted may be prevailed with to be equally sollicitous, to restore our Peace as they have been instrumental to destroy it.</P>
<P>We have also had the the Rev. Messirs. <HI>Crosswell, Wheelock, Parsons, Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Moorehead,</HI> &amp;c. in their successive Excursions, not as Healers of our Hurt, but Augmentors of Strife in our Societies.</P>
<P>To return to Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI> He is now making a second Visit to us, in pompous Progress from Town to Town follow'd with the loud Accla∣mations of many People, while some, from whom more manly Things
<PB N="9" REF="005667_0008_1026B9BF1CD79B20"/>might be expected, seem to lay their Necks at his Feet to trample on at Pleasure, as if his Word was not only <HI>his own</HI> but <HI>their</HI> Law also,—accor∣ding to that—<HI>Stat pro ratione Voluntas.</HI></P>
<P>I suppose this Gentleman would be thought to act in the Capacity of an <HI>Evangelist;</HI> but I think his Methods no ways answer this Character; for according to the generally receiv'd Notion, he must then Preach chiefly where Ministers are not settled, and the pure Gospel and the Ordinances thereof establish'd, which is the unhappy Case of some Towns in this and the neighbouring Government: Whereas he shuns these<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the Writing of this Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has taken a Tour into some of the Towns which are without settled Ministers, and the Ordinances of the Gospel.</NOTE>, and preaches chiefly in our great Towns where there are settled Ministers, as able and perhaps more so than himself; and so instead of healing our Divisions, in∣creases them, as is the evident Effect in most of the Towns where he has preach'd both now and when he was here before.—What Constructions can be put on these Things, but either that he acts too much on Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s Principle, <HI>viz.</HI> The more we are divided, so much the more hopeful Pro∣spect of the revival of Religion; or else that he retains his declar'd Opini∣on of the Ministers in general, that they are dead Men, &amp;c. —And agree∣ing with Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> that it is as dangerous to the Souls of Men to hear such Ministers preach as a Potion of Ratsbane would be to their Bodies; perhaps Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> tarries among us to deliver our People from this mortal Poison.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the Designs of this Gentlemen, I think the melan∣choly Condition of our Churches calls upon all <HI>that love Zion and pray for her Peace and Prosperity, to consider, take Advice, and speak their Minds.</HI> I am thus free to offer my Opinion, under affecting Apprehensions of the Evils come and coming on our Constitution. And as I have no Design to offend any Person, but only desire that Things may be <HI>weigh'd in the Bal∣lance of the Sanctuary,</HI> and that our lost Love and Unity and Order may be restor'd, therefore crave Leave, to offer the following Queries to the Publick, and especially to those Reverend Ministers who have given Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> such free Admission into their Pulpits.</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 1. Whether there is not at least an Appearance of Inconsistency in those Gentlemen's Conduct who had subscrib'd in their publick Testimo∣ny against Itinerant Preachers? Unless the Proviso of <HI>Substance, Scope and End,</HI> annex'd to some of their Names was design'd to preserve a Liberty in that Case to act as Occasion might call for: Or must the Subscription be
<PB N="10" REF="005667_0009_1026B9C0A488B4F8"/>understood to mean all Itinerant Preachers <HI>except</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield?</HI> Or was in then thought that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> would not come among us again? Or must we say that it is allowable after Vows to make Enquiry?—</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 2. Whether these Gentlemen have exercised due Love and af∣fectionate Regard to their Brethren in the Ministry, in inviting Mr <HI>White∣field</HI> to preach when they might at the first Glance foresee, that it had a direct Tendency to revive Suspicions in the Minds of their disaffected Bre∣thren, and to open the Wound which was then under hopeful Symptoms of Healing?—</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 3. Whether these Gentlemen have discover'd a just Regard to our Colleges, which have so long been the Glory and Strength of our Ci∣vil and Ecclesiastical Polity? Have they been fir'd with a becoming Re∣sentment at these Aspersions cast upon these Societies, by that Gentleman whom they so much caress? Where is the Honour and Gratitude due to their venerable Mother in whose Bosom, these very Gentlemen have been nourished and tenderly brought up, and to whom under GOD they owe their Academical Acquirements and publick useful Improvements?</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 4. Whether it has not a manifest Tendency to weaken our Con∣stitution, if not destroy the Order and Discipline of these Churches, for publick Offenders to be admitted to Communion, or special publick Acts of Religion, such as Preaching and Administring the Sacraments, until they evidence true Repentance and give Satisfaction to the Party offended, as the Gospel requires? This Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has not attempted to do (as we hear of) tho' call'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a publick Manner. Don't we hereby lay our-selves, and these Churches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to the just Insults of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> it self, which <HI>does not admit of Absolutions without antecedent Pen∣nance?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 5 Will it not throw the Ministry under farther Contempt, and dispose all that please to call in Question the Validity of our Ordination, for a Gentleman by the Consent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o many Ministers and others, to ar∣rogate a Super-intendency over our Churches, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has done and is doing <HI>in Fact,</HI> tho' not as yet <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> when at the same Time he professes himself a Minister of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> And has it not a direct Tendency also to lead many People, if not Ministers, to renounce the Order and Discipline of these Churches, and turn back to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> from whence our Fathers first came?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005667_0010_1026B9C283B50538"/>
<HI>Quer.</HI> 6. Can it be rationally suppos'd, that a Gospel Reformation and Revival of Religion, must be built upon Separations and Contentions as many now pretend? drawing it as an Inference from CHRIST'S saying <HI>I came not to send Peace but a Sword,</HI> Mat. 10.34. As tho' CHRIST had constituted his own Members for whom he died, to be the common Exe∣cutioners one of another; which must lead directly to the Desolation of his Church and Kingdom, as he proves Ch. 12.25. <HI>Every Kingdom divided against it self is brought to Desolation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> 7. Is it not highly probable, that the <HI>Moravians,</HI> a People wild in their Principles, and big with Euthusiasm and vain Glory, should make a Descent upon us in their Turn, when they hear what success this Gen∣tleman has had in working over so many into his own Way of thinking and to such an Admiration of his Person? especially when they have such Numbers of their Brethren the Exhorters actually engag'd in their Cause; and many others under rais'd Apprehensions of their own superiour Abi∣lities, already settled among us; waiting the first Opportunity to exercise their Gifts, so pleasing to the People, and in their Apprehensions vastly ex∣ceeding their own Ministers, by whom they think themselves unreasonably restrain'd.—</P>
<P>These Queries I submit to the serious Perusal and Consideration of all my Brethren in the Ministry, especially those whom they do more imme∣diately concern.</P>
<P>But if these Reverend Gentlemen can not only free themselves from Inconsistency, but also answer all the other Objections contained in these Queries, yet one would think, that only the Sight of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Life and Journals must have made <HI>Them,</HI> as well as all others, very cautious of in∣viting into their Pulplts, a Gentleman of such a Temper and cast of Mind as he appears to be.</P>
<P>In these Writings how much does he discover of Enthusiasm, Ostentation and vain Boasting of the Spirit's Influence and immediate Conduct to a superlative Degree, as tho' he had arrived to the highest Familiarities with the divine Being. As a Specimen of which, I shall insert a few Instances extracted from his Journals.— <Q>GOD has given me a double Portion of his Spirit indeed.— I should quench the Spirit, did I not go on to speak as He gives me Utterance.—The Eternal Almighty I AM hath sent me.—This I know, what I have spoken, GOD will bring to pass; lo! It will come, then shall Scoffers and Despisers know that a Minister of CHRIST has been among them.—Wherever I go People will follow
<PB N="12" REF="005667_0011_1026B9C59E2AC358"/>me—When I said, Finally Brethren, Farewell; Thousands imme∣diately burst out into strong Cryings and Tears.—In the Morning I talk'd with the LORD in the Garden, as a Man talketh with his Friend.—It was <HI>revealed</HI> to me that nothing griev'd Satan so much as the private Societies.— The Power is such among the Societies that some∣times when they go to say Grace before Meat, the Spirit of Prayer falls on them one after another, that they are kept in Prayer near 3 Hours.—Such of the Exhorters as had publick Gifts were settled as Super∣intendants over the rest.—Nothing confirms me more in my Opinion that GOD intends to work a great Work upon Earth, than to find how his Children of all Denominations every where wrestle in Prayer for me.</Q>—</P>
<P>Such super-intendant Exhorters as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> speaks of, we may expect, when he becomes Super-intendant here, as many appear to give him the Power.—</P>
<P>These high Pretensions to the extraordinary Guidance of the Spirit brings to my Mind a Man whom I once knew, <HI>Thomas Case</HI> by Name, of whom Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> writes in his <HI>Mag. Amer.</HI> He pretended as much to the ex∣traordinary Guidance of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as any in these Days; even to <HI>Prophecy and special Revelation,</HI> but finally prov'd a grand Impostor. It was credibly reported by Eye-witnesses, that at his Meetings (for he had gain'd a great Number of Followers) the People us'd to fall down as with strong convul∣sive-like Fits, with Foamings at their Mouths, remaining for a Time speech∣less and without Sense. Then <HI>Case</HI> and his Company were wont greatly to rejoice, looking on it as a sure Sign of their Conversion; and therefore sang and danc'd round them, saying, <HI>the Joy! the Joy, Joy, Joy!</HI> — with extatick Appearance and Gestures. These Persons us'd to sing in the Streets and high-Ways as they pass'd along, and so were distinguish'd from other Sectaries by the Name of <HI>singing Quakers</HI> or <HI>Hie-hoes.</HI> It was usual with him also as he pass'd the Streets at the Head of his Company, and when alone, to cry out (under the Pretence of an extraordinary Mission, like that of the Disciples) <HI>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> Thus he proceeded from <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> to <HI>Block-Island</HI> and <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and to the new Country (then call'd) <HI>viz. the Jerseys,</HI> to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and then back again with several of his Admirers, who soon after his Death, finding themselves deceiv'd of the great Things, which his pretended Predictions had made them expect, they soon dispers'd with shame, that they had been led away with such strong Delusions. And now for many Years the very Name of this Man, and his Company as such, is remember∣ed only with Reproach and Contempt, as a deluded Company of People
<PB N="13" REF="005667_0012_1026B9C9D09E2A68"/>who were made to believe a Lie. I offer this Instance not as a Parallel, but by way of Caution; lest any should in like Manner be led away with too high an Opinion of the Sanctity, Zeal and Presence of GOD'S Spirit with <HI>any Man,</HI> and thereby fall into the like Delusion in this perilous Age.</P>
<P>—But to return,—</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had, at this his second coming, seen Cause publickly to declare, that on better Light receiv'd he thought proper to recede from his solemn Oaths and Subscriptions to practice according to the Rites and Forms of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and had also evidenc'd his sincere Repentance by retracting his rash and groundless Charges thrown on the Ministry in general, Colleges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — And had at the same Time us'd his Endeavours to sweeten the Tempers of those whom he had disaffected to∣wards their Pastors and Brethren, and to recover from their unscriptural Separations, and to return them to their Duty, as one under superiour Advantages for that Purpose above all Mankind, considering his Influence on them; and had he likewise put himself under the Quality of a Candi∣date for the Ministry in order to a settled Improvement in any of these Churches, or else had better answer'd the Character of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> by preaching in un gospeliz'd Places: I say had he done thus, then his Con∣duct in general would not have lain open to the same Censure in these Churches as now it does. But it is the Opinion of many (and as they think founded on Scripture and Reason) that unless Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had come into such Steps as these, he ought not to have Admission, much less Invitation, to any Gentleman's Desk in the Country, but to be rejected as a <HI>disorderly walker.</HI></P>
<P>It is also Matter of Grief and Surprize to many in the Country to hear that a Reverend Father, (whose Praise has been in all these Churches, and whose Character has been bright in this and remote Countries) should now be the first of his Order in these Parts, to introduce Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> to preach in his Pulpit, and to administer the Sacrament of the LORD'S-Supper in his Church: But 'tis hop'd that for the future, this Instance will be improv'd as a Caution rather than an Encouragement to others, in this Day of mighty Expectation, when Example goes beyond Precept. How∣ever, Honour and Respect command us to form a Construction in this Case according to constant Experience; <HI>viz. That the most pious, wise and singularly accomplish'd Men are but Men, and evidence themselves such in more or less obvious Instances.</HI> Many are as much and some more stumbled at Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Conduct in this Matter, and think him chargeable with Arrogance and Usurpation as well Breach of solemn Vows and Promises. Let that be as it will. — It was certainly a very strange thing
<PB N="14" REF="005667_0013_1026B9CB72B4AEB0"/>that a Gentleman under his Circumstances, and doubtless acquainted with the Order of these Churches, should make such a Push at our Constitution, unless it was with a Design to overthrow it, and with this View, — The sooner the better.—</P>
<P>It is needless to enquire here, whether the Brethren of that Communi∣on were led into this step of Innovation, as free Agents, or thro' surprize? We charitably hope they have seen their Error and are feelingly qualifyed to become Monitors to themselves and others for the future.</P>
<P>Who can Account for the like Measures come into, in some other Churches? Unless the high Esteem of this Gentleman has led them super∣stitiously to imagine, that the Elements in that Holy Ordinance are so much the more sacred and efficacious, when receiv'd from his Hands. Have they forgotten their Catechism which tells them, that <HI>The Sacraments be∣come effectual Means of Salvation, not from any Virtue in them, or in him that doth administer them; but only be the Blessing of CHRIST, and the working of his SPIRIT in them, that by Faith receive them.</HI></P>
<P>What a criminal silence would it be, after all the formentioned Evils which are come upon us, <HI>when our Breach is great as the Sea,</HI> if the Mi∣nisters of CHRIST (who are <HI>sit as Watchmen on the Walls of Jerusalem</HI>) don't open their Mouths like a Trumpet and warn the People whether they will hear or whether they will forbear. Shall we stand as idle unconcern'd Spectators, and as treacherous Dealers, dealing treacherously, betray our invaluable Church Privileges into the Hands of our Enemies, and become a willing Prey to them that oppress us? <HI>Let the Priests then, the Ministers of the Lord, cry with one consent, saying, spare thy People, Oh Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach.</HI></P>
<P>Were it possible for our <HI>venerable Fathers,</HI> whose renown'd Heads are laid in the Dust, to behold such Multitudes, and perhaps not a few of their own dear Offspring, following and applauding enthusiastick Strangers and ignorant Exhorters, whilst their dear and beloved Brethren stand neglect∣ed and despised, wounded not only by Enemies, but in the House and by the Hands of their Friends, as not worthy to be compar'd with those of the new make; (I say could our Fathers see this) with what Indignation would they reprove the early Apostacy of their Children, who are turned out of the Way so quickly after their Fathers have fallen asleep? As a Confirmation of this we may consult many of the Discourses of these excellent Worthies, wherein they gave their dying Testimonies to the Order of these Churches, and charge their Posterity to endeavour to preserve it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="005667_0014_1026B9CE764D7D40"/>
Nay even a Stranger that had been kindly receiv'd, and liv'd and died among us in the Work of the Ministry, has left us these Words as his dying Advice. <Q>It was one of the Glories of <HI>New-England,</HI> that they had shewn so much Respect to Ministers educated abroad;</Q> but then re∣flecting on some late Occurences, he added,—<Q>That for the future it was adviseable for us to make a more due Enquiry into the Principles of Strangers that come among us, lest instead of moderate Presbyterians, which the Churches honour &amp; embrace without any disagreement or diffi∣culty; they should commit themselves into the Hands of <HI>rash Incendiaries.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole. If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Measures have the most direct Tendency to strengthen the Discipline of these Churches, to promote Love and good Agreement among Ministers and Brethren, to establish the Reputation of our Colleges, and are the only hopeful Means to bring about a thorough Reformation,—Then let this Gentleman and his Friends rejoice in the Fire which he has kindled, tho' it has already burnt many ex∣cellent <HI>Cedars in</HI> our <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and yet continues to flame in these Churches with Rage and Violence: But if not,—Then let us all come to a stand and consider, whether the Good suppos'd to be done in some Places, <HI>can coun∣tervail the King's Damage, who is the Head of his Church, and the Glory of it where he walks.</HI></P>
<P>I am now to proceed in the next Place,</P>
<P>To offer some <HI>Healing Measures</HI> in order to recover us out of our broken State, and to restore Peace and Love.</P>
<P>They will greatly mistake my Design, who suppose it to be any other than this, in all that I have offer'd in the former Part of my Letter. It exceedingly grieves me for the Occasion of it, and I hope it may affect the Hearts of some in <HI>reading,</HI> as it does mine in <HI>writing.</HI></P>
<P>We find by sorrowful Experience that wise and good Men have fallen into very different Ways of thinking, speaking and acting in Matters of Religion. In pursuing my Purpose therefore it may be proper to enquire into the Grounds of our present Difference. If I have a true Idea of Things, our present Controversy is not about the fundamental Points of Religion. All agree in the Doctrine of Original Sin, the Necessity of Conversion or the New-Birth, of Justification by Faith in the Merits of CHRIST▪ the Imputation of CHRIST'S Righteousness received by Faith, and good Works or an holy Obedience as a Fruit and Evidence of true Faith. All my Brethren in the Ministry, that I am acquainted with, assent to these Doctrines, and preach them to their Hearers. They can't there∣fore
<PB N="16" REF="005667_0015_1026B9D0E0FC84E0"/>on this Account with any Propriety be term'd Opposers of the Work of GOD. Moreover, if at any Time it has been prov'd against any Mini∣nister, that his Doctrine or Life is not according to the Gospel, he has by our Constitution been removed from his Ministry. For what is it then that so many of the well-principl'd Servants of CHRIST are at this Day call'd Opposers of the Work of GOD? Certainly they have not deserv'd this odious Character: And it will appear unreasonable that their separating Brethren have branded them with this Name, if we consider, What it is they oppose▪</P>
<P>In the first Place, they oppose the so much applauded Method of Itine∣rant Preaching; because they don't know of any Scripture Warrant to support it: Nor can the Itinerants prove their Mission by their miraculous Healing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Evangelists of old did,—and it breaks in upon Order which is absolutely necessary to the Support of Religion: For tho' some∣times there may be external Order without true Religion, yet true Reli∣gion can never subsist long in a Country without Order.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>They oppose publick Exhorters; because they are neither that Order of Men to whom CHRIST has promised his Presence to the End of the World, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. <HI>ult.</HI> Nor are they of the Number of the <HI>Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pasors or Teachers, which Christ has given for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying the Body of Christ,</HI> Eph. 4 11. Nor are they of the Eldership spoken of, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. Nor those mentioned, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. They are therefore to be opposed as a spurious Offspring, not legitimated in Scripture, but of the Number of false Teachers whom the Apostle mentions, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.17. which seems to be exemplified in the Itinerants and publick Exhorters of this Day, <HI>They zealously affect you, but not well; yea they would exclude us</HI> (as 'tis render'd in the Margin the true Ministers of Christ) <HI>that you may affect them</HI> In∣asmuch therefore as these Men take this Honour to themselves, when they are neither called of GOD, nor can they produce any Testimony or Example from Scripture to support their Pretences, Duty and Interest calls upon both Ministers and Churches to oppose them, and the Errors and Disorders they have introduced. It is good to be zealously affected in a good Thing, for which some are to be commended at this Day: But when Zeal for Reformation is beclouded with uncharitable Judgings of Fellow-Christians, it is not according to Knowledge, and therefore should be watch'd with Caution. One says, <Q>Take heed that when Zeal for Refor∣mation knocks at the Door, some new Error steps not in with it, which will as much need an after-Reformation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005667_0016_1026B9D42C9E4D60"/>
Moreover, They oppose (not the regular Conduct of those who have appear'd to be wrought on in a genuine evangelical Manner, but) that unlimited Liberty which many have given themselves, to judge and con∣demn the State of others; even those who are of known Orthodox Prin∣ciples and unblemished Lives. This is not warranted, but strictly forbid∣den in Scripture, as might be abundantly prov'd.</P>
<P>They oppose Dreams, Visions, Revelations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and bodily Appearances of CHRIST to the natural Sight of the Eye, which many have lately pre∣tended to: As tho' the holy Scriptures were not a compleat System of Divine Revelation, and sufficient Rule of Life, but that we still stood in need of something farther to direct us in point of our Faith and Practice: Which must be denied, and consequently opposed, as that which leads into manifold dangerous Errors and Delusions.</P>
<P>The extraordinary Out-cries and bodily Agitations in Time of divine Worship, so common in Assemblies, and applauded by many as Signs of the Spirit's powerful Operation, is objected against, as no ways profitable to Souls, but an hindrance of the true Ends of Worship. Preaching is a rational as well as a religious Act, both in the Preacher and Hearer of the Word; but these Out-cries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> destroy both. It would be strange to conceive, that there were cryings-out in the Congregation when <HI>Samuel</HI> reasoned with the People to convince them of their Sin, in asking a King; and what can he mean when he saith, <HI>Now therefore stand still that I may reason with you before the Lord,—1 Sam.</HI> 12.7. But that they should give their united Attention to his Reasonings with them? Or how was it possible their Reason should be duely exercised, or the true Ends of his Preaching answered, which as I said was for their Conviction? And it prov'd effectual as we may see in the following part of the Chapter; and why did it so? because they stood still, i. e. they were not noisy and tumultuous.—The like Instance we have in <HI>Paul,</HI> when he reasoned of <HI>Righteousness, Tem∣perance, and Judgment to come,</HI> Acts 24.25. it is said, <HI>Felix trembled.</HI> He reasoned,—but what Effect could his Reasoning have had on <HI>Felix</HI> if it were obstructed by Out cries? Or on <HI>Agrippa,</HI> when he was <HI>almost per∣suaded to be a Christian,</HI> Acts 26.28.</P>
<P>Furthermore, That quick and instantaneous Assurance many now boast of, is justly objected against. As they pretend, it follows immedi∣ately upon their recovery out of strong Convictions for Sin, and when the Mind is calm'd, and Terrors of the Law worn off, they presently arrive at Assurance, which is dangerous to the Souls of Men; for such an Assurance Hypocrites themselves rest upon. That Assurance, in its true meaning, is attainable in this Life, none of the Orthodox deny; but hold
<PB N="18" REF="005667_0017_1026B9D6E8857D48"/>that according to the ordinary Method of Grace, GOD leads true Believers to rest in a well-grounded scriptural Hope of Justification thro' the Merits of CHRIST, evidenc'd by the Mortification of Sin in them, and lively Actings of Grace, in a Life of sweet and holy Communion with GOD: Such an Assurance is to be depended upon; and not such an one as rises like a Mushroom, or as <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Gourd, that grows in a Night and perishes as in a Night.</P>
<P>That prevailing Opinion also, That all true Converts must know the Time and Circumstances of their Conversion, is justly to be objected to; for as CHRIST is Lord of his own Grace, he bestows when, to whom, in what Manner and Measure he pleases. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was sanctified in the Womb; and <HI>Samuel</HI> we may conceive was sanctified then, or soon after in his Childhood: <HI>Timothy</HI> knew the Scriptures from a Child. Some GOD reveals himself to in a gradual Way, under the Means of Grace and the Spirit's Operation, that are made effectual by his Blessing for their Conver∣sion; and others in a more apparent, sensible Manner, as he did to <HI>Paul:</HI> Which different Method of Grace CHRIST shews by the Comparison he uses, <HI>John</HI> 3.8. CHRIST as much prov'd the Sovereignty of his Grace in opening the Eyes of the blind Man by weak and gradual Means, <HI>John</HI> 9.6.7. as he did by unstoping the deaf Man's Ears with a Word speaking <HI>Mark</HI> 7.34.</P>
<P>The last Thing I shall offer here by way of Objection in the present Case, is that prevailing Practice of having some Ministers Persons in such high Admiration, as in a sort to Deify them. GOD has given different Gifts to Ministers as well as others; and as those of superiour Qualifications are not to be overvalued, neither should those of lower Gifts and Attain∣ments be despised: In these Cases its often that People are acted more by Fancy than Judgment, which seems too much our present Case. This was what the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> faulted the Churches of <HI>Corinth</HI> for, as they listed themselves, some under one Minister, and some under another, and tells them they were carnal and walk'd as Men, not as Christians, and he gives the Reasons, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.3, 4. This too high Esteem of one Minister, and too low Estimation of another, led them into Envying, Strife, and Divisi∣ons, as the necessary Consequence of such a Conduct▪ He had before re∣proved this Practice of theirs, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 11, 12, 13. And complains of their Contentions, <HI>One saith, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>another I am of</HI> Apollos, <HI>ano∣ther I am of</HI> Cephas, <HI>or</HI> Peter, <HI>another I am of</HI> Christ. Then <HI>v.</HI> 13. he proceeds farther to detect this Corruption by <HI>saying, is Christ divided? was</HI> Paul <HI>crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the Name of</HI> Paul? Now as this Case is become so remarkably ours at this Day, I suppose it not amiss to gloss a little on the Text above cited and say.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="19" REF="005667_0018_1026B9D882B20C58"/>
1. That nothing (ordinarily) has a more direct Tendency to break the Peace of fellow-Christians and Churches, and throw them into Envyings, Strife, Divisions and Contentions, than when they fall into Parties, from a different and too high esteem of one Minister above all others.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true Ministers of CHRIST will aim more at the Glory of GOD the Peace, Unity and good Order of his Church and Churches, than at the highest popular Applause and partisan Acclamations of Praise. This we find in <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' first in order, and perhaps the Number of his Ad∣mirers and Followers exceeded the rest of the Ministers, yet, his faithful∣ness to CHRIST, and his Zeal to restore Peace in this Church, led him in so sharp a Manner to reprove their Sin and separating Dispositions. Which is left as an Example for all CHRIST'S Ministers, and for the warn∣ing and Instruction of his Churches and People in every after-Age and Generation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Thing I shall note from the Apostle's Words above, is, that when Churches, or the professed Followers of JESUS CHRIST fall in∣to Parties from their different Esteem of Ministers, it is then most probable CHRIST will have the smallest Numbers of sincere Followers on his Side—For we find some were for <HI>Paul</HI> others for <HI>Apollos,</HI> others were for <HI>Cephas,</HI> here were three Parts of the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> some for one, and others for another Minister, CHRIST could therefore have but a very small Part among them: It is therefore observable, he saith, is CHRIST divided, or do you expect to find CHTIST dividing himself into these Ministers; and to prove the contrary, he saith, was <HI>Paul,</HI> or any of these Ministers you so much admire, crucified for you? Or were you baptized in his or any other of their Names? As the Words and Sense of the Thing Import.</P>
<P>Inasmuch then as these several Heads of Particulars, mentioned above, are what make and foment our Divisions, and are not supported either by Scripture or Reason, Can the Conduct of those be justified who brand the Characters of their Pastors and Brethren as Opposers of the Work of GOD, and under that received Notion, unwarrantably separate from them?—It was with great Satisfaction indeed, that the pious and well-meaning People in general, in the several Governments here, at first receiv'd the Tydings of those remarkable Awakenings that many, and especially those of the younger Sort, seem'd to be brought under; and it is Matter of great Thankfulness to GOD, that their Hopes have been so far answer'd, as that there are Evidences of some Persons who have been savingly wrought on, and brought home to CHRIST in these Times of Commotion, in one Place and another, as in Charity we are oblig'd to believe: Yet nothing is more evident than that the State of Religion is in a more languishing Condition
<PB N="20" REF="005667_0019_1026B9DC324333E8"/>in our Churches in general, than ever before has been known in the Memory of Man. Where is the Reformation, so much talk'd of, to be found, except in a few Places? Nor can it in Reason be suppos'd that a noble Structure can be built without a solid and proper Foundation; nor when the principal Artificers pull down with one Hand what they build up with the other; which appears too much our unhappiness, and is Mat∣ter of Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation; and the more so, if after all the Means of Conviction and Healing that can be offered, the Language and Resolutions of the Times remain as of old, saying, there <HI>is no hope, no, for we have chosen Strangers, and after them we will go;</HI> which GOD forbid: For without a wonderful Interposition of Providence to restore our lost and long banished Peace, what can be expected, as an Event of the prevailing Contentions and Separations, but the utter Demolition of these Churches, and the Constitution on which they are so happily found∣ed: The prudent Man foreseeth the Evil and hideth himself; it highly behoves us to hide our selves in this evil Day under the Covert of CHRIST'S Wing, and pray for that Wisdom which is from above, and is profitable to direct us in this critical Juncture, to throw off the different Denomina∣tions, and disband the contending Parties, Uniting in Love as CHRIST'S mystical Body and Members in particular, and as such conforming our∣selves as much as in us lies to Gospel Commands, which in no Part of it that (I know of) will justify, but contrary-wise condemn our subsisting Heats and Animosities and Methods, in which they are carried on in the general, on the one side, and on the other. I therefore humbly recommend that Text of many others that might be offered, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>If there be therefore any Consolation in Christ, if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellowship of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fullfil ye my Joy. — That ye be like-minded, having the same Love, being of one Accord, of one Mind; let no∣thing be done through Strife, or vain Glory; but in lowliness of Mind, let each Esteem other better than themselves.</HI> Now then as the <HI>End of the Com∣mandment is Charity,</HI> out of a pure Heart, — which we are commanded above all Things to put on, and as Chrstians to arm our selves with, as by it we are led to hope and believe the best Things one of another, and to cover a Multitude of Faults and Imperfections we see one in another; and as vital Piety and practical Christianity consists so much in the right Exercise of this Grace of Charity, and by the want of it so much the more in Proportion, will Contentions be strengthned and abound among Christian Professors, as our present and very sorrowful Experience does Evidence, let us all throw off an uncharitable censorious judging, divisive Disposition, and be deeply humbled before GOD has who suffered Satan that Accuser of the Brethren to sow the Seeds of Discord among us, and
<PB N="21" REF="005667_0020_1026B9DFB97D8F50"/>animated them, thro' his subtle Insinuations, to become Accusers one of another in this Day of Temptation, too much whereof is to be found on one Side, and the other.</P>
<P>It was once a wise and very seasonable Enquiry made by a Captain and Leader in <HI>Israel, — Shall the Sword devour for ever?</HI> An Enquiry highly applicable, and with great Propriety to be impressed on the Minds of all, in these Times, especially those that appear foremost in promoting the present Controversy: Then it follows, <HI>Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?</HI> An Admonition, truly worthy to be writ in Capital Letters of the largest Size, and fixt in all Places of publick Resort, that <HI>they who run may read and learn to leave off Contention, before it be further meddled with.</HI></P>
<P>As I am free from an Attachment to a Party, but if I know my own Heart sincerely desirous, that <HI>that</HI> Peace and <HI>that</HI> Charity, without which our Religion is vain, and that Truth and Holiness may be restored, strength∣ened, established, and more and more abound among us, I shall address my Brethren, those Churches, and my Country, in the Words of a late<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Flavel.</NOTE> excellent and approved Writer in a like Time of growing Dis∣sention. — <Q>For my own Part, It is my fixed Resolution to provoke no good Man, if I can help it; but if their own inveterate Zeal shall pro∣voke them in pursuit of their Errors or Misconduct, — I will ear∣nestly contend in the Cause of Truth: — I have sincerely aimed at the Purity and Peace of the Church of GOD; and he greatly mistakes that takes me for a Man of Contention, — But an hearty Desire and seri∣ous Motion for Peace among all the profess'd Members of CHRIST.—Let all Letigations of this Nature (at least in this critical Juncture) be suspended by common Consent, since they waste our Time, hinder our Communion, imbitter our Spirits, impoverish practical Godliness, grieve the Spirit of GOD and good Men, make Sport for our common Enemies, who warm their own Fingers at the Fire of our Contentions, and place more Trust in our dividing Lusts, than they do in their own feeble Ar∣guments.</Q>—</P>
<P>To conclude, My Heart's Desire and Prayer to God, is, that all who love these Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that pray for their Peace &amp; Pros∣perity, would labour to their utmost to allay Animosities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and eminently the Ministers of CHRIST thro' the Land; by their Doctrine, Example, and Influence, endeavouring to turn the Hearts of this People to CHRIST, and one towards another, in the strongest Ties of Charity and united Gospel-Or∣der. Then, and not till then, may we hope to <HI>see Jerusalem a quiet Ha∣bitation and a Praise in the Earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER impartially consults the Antiquities of <HI>New-England,</HI> will find that many of these Churches in their infant State, were infested with <HI>Antinomian, Enthusiastick</HI> and many other Errors, which gave them and the People of GOD here much trouble: As a direct and necessary Effect of such Errors, nothing less can be expected but Factions and Parties, evil Surmisings and open Reflections, on such especially as adhere to the Truth, and labour to stem the Torrent of Corruption flowing in upon them: Thus it was in that Day, and thus it is with us in this Day of our <HI>Zion</HI>'s Trouble, as sorrowful Experience teaches us.</P>
<P>The faithful Ministers of CHRIST were then loaded with Obloquy and open Contempt, termed, <Q>No better than legal Preachers, <HI>Baal</HI>'s Priests, Popish Factors, Scribes, Pharisees, and opposers of CHRIST himself — Such a Church-Officer is an ignorant Man, and knows not CHRIST: Such an one is under a <HI>Covenant of Works:</HI> Such a Pastor is a proud Man, and would make a good <HI>Persecutor:</HI> Such a Teacher is grosly Popish.—That they did not preach the <HI>Covenant of free Grace,</HI> and that they themselves had not the Seal of the Spirit, <HI>&amp;c</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in these Times (as the same Author observes) <Q>You might see many of the Opinionists rising up and contemptuously turning their Backs upon the <HI>faithful Pastor</HI> of that <HI>Church,</HI> and going forth from the Assembly when he began to Pray or Preach.</Q>—</P>
<P>Then also, <Q>You might have seen open Contempt cast upon the Face of the whole General-Court in subtle Words, to this very Effect, that the Magistrates were <HI>Ahab</HI>'s, <HI>Amaziab</HI>'s, Scribes and Pharisees, Enemies to CHRIST, led by Satan, that old Enemy of free Grace; and that it were <HI>better that a Mill-stone were hung about their Necks,</HI> and they <HI>were drowned in the Sea,</HI> than they should censure one of their Judge∣ment.</Q>—</P>
<P>The worthy Author proceeds to say, <Q>By a little taste of a few Passages (instead of Multitudes) here presented, you may see what a Height they were grown to in a short Time; and what a Spirit of Pride, Insolency,
<PB N="2" REF="005667_0022_1026B9E400566D00"/>Contempt of Authority, Division, Sedition, they were acted by. It was a wonder of Mercy that they had not set our Common wealth and Churches on fire, and consumed us all therein.</Q>—</P>
<P>These are a few Hints taken from the Rev. Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Preface to his Book, entitled, — <HI>Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in</HI> NEW-ENGLAND. — A Performance aptly calculated to obviate the Objections of the present Day, raised in our Churches against Ministers and others, by Persons of the like censorious corrupt Dispositions, with those refer'd to above. Would to GOD, there were more found among us of the like Zeal and Concern for these Churches of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, with the renowned Patriots of the first Times, who have endeared their Memory to after-Posterities, by bearing down those Errors than then did so sadly assault them, like these which we now feel the miserable Effects of.</P>
<P>It may also serve for our Caution to take a short View of some later Occurences of the like kind, which fall within the Compass of the Memo∣ries of many of us, as we find them transmitted from a Number of our venerable Fathers (two of whom are yet surviving<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The venerable Mr. <HI>Nehemiah Walter</HI> and Dr. <HI>Colman.</HI></NOTE>) bearing the Title of <HI>A faithful Advice from several Ministers of the Gospel, in and near</HI> Boston, <HI>unto the Churches of</HI> New England; <HI>Relating to the Dangers that may arise from Impostors, pretending to be Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>The manifest Reasons leading to the Publication of this faithful Advice was partly from a Number of illiterate and unqualified Persons in Succession, who appeared <HI>in their Day,</HI> to set up for Preachers; who were of the like make with the numerous Exhorters of these Times, and partly from the over-fondness of the People (especially the weaker sort) to hear them, which is also remarkably exemplified among us in this our Day—As a Proof whereof we have the Testimony of the Rev. Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> in his <HI>History of some Imposters,</HI> — annexed to the above Advice, and written to maintain it, as he there <HI>tells us.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor gives a Relation in that short History of several of these Impo∣sters appearing on the Stage; and also the Manner of their Exit, within the Compass of Time, between 1624 and 1699. I shall for brevity sake take Notice here only of one <HI>Samuel May,</HI> (who appeared the last men∣tioned in that Account) as the most remarkable in the Influence he had on many of the People in <HI>Boston.</HI> Of this <HI>Samuel May</HI> the Dr. writes thus,—<Q><HI>Fascination</HI> is a Thing whereof Mankind has more <HI>Experience</HI> than <HI>Comprehension;</HI> and <HI>Facination</HI> is never more notoriously sensible, than in Men's running after False Teachers of Religion. — One cannot
<PB N="3" REF="005667_0023_1026B9E6774C6710"/>easily ascribe unto a truer Cause than a <HI>satanick Energy,</HI> the strange <HI>Biass</HI> upon the Minds of a Multitude, forcibly, and furiously; sometimes carrying them into Follies, from whence the plainest Reason in the World will not reclaim them: What but such an <HI>Energy</HI> could be upon the Minds of many People in <HI>Boston,</HI> after the arrival of one that went by Name of <HI>Samuel May,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> 1699? The won∣derful Success of <HI>Mahomet</HI> upon a World where Christianity was to another Degree lost, than it is yet in <HI>Boston,</HI> was no longer a wonder to us, when we saw the Success of <HI>May,</HI> in a Place of so Christian a Cha∣racter as <HI>Boston.</HI>—It was all over pure <HI>Enchantment.</HI> — So silly and shallow a Person he was, that it was impossible for any but <HI>such,</HI> to be many Minutes in his Company without being sensible of it. The first Thing that made some to suspect him was, his using to lift up his Eyes and Hands, with Strains of Devotion, used by none others in the Assembly. He was able to imitate a plausible Utterance and Action, and seem'd so zealously set upon <HI>inviting Men to CHRIST,</HI> that after Sermon was over he would make another Speech to put them in Mind on't. Abundance of the People became so fiercely set for him, that they pour'd out a Thousand Expressions of Rage, upon the Faithful Pastors of the Town.</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to say—</P>
<Q><P>The Disciples of this <HI>Money-Catcher,</HI> became so exceeding fierce many of them, that some sober Men, became afraid of <HI>passing by that Way,</HI> where one must encounter them; tho' he were detected in several Crimes, — yet his Followers would go on, making <HI>Ridi∣culous Apologies</HI> for him, and <HI>malicious Invectives</HI> against any that would not believe him an <HI>Eminent Saint.</HI> Yea, they began to throw Libels into the Houses of the Ministers, the most Insolent that ever I saw.</P></Q>
<P>He proceeds to shew the <HI>Reflections</HI> the Ministers made on the Car∣riage of the People, that were <HI>May</HI>'s Admirers, which was to this pur∣pose, — That however long and indefatigably, they had endeavour'd to serve them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>yet if any <HI>Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</HI> do come with a few good Words among them; the simple Souls of many, will not only follow the Wolf, but on his Account bark at the Shepherds.</Q>— Applicable to what we now see and feel tragically acted among us.</P>
<P>The Invasions these Impostors made on the Churches, as has been noted, moved our Fathers (above hinted at) to offer their Opinions on these Things, apprehensive of Danger in Time to come, and have left this their <HI>Faithful Advice</HI> as a lasting Testimony and Caution to these Churches for the future. A few Paragraphs whereof, I shall Transcribe, with their Names, for the Benefit of the Publick.—</P>

They say thus,—</P>
<P><Q>It is not without some Concern on our Minds, that in the late Writings of our <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> we find awful Complaints about <HI>bold Intruders</HI> into the Work of the Ministry,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — And then they go on, and express their <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in the Care that had been taken by their Brethren at Home, to prevent those <HI>Confusions.</HI> Pag. 3. by a <HI>Vote</HI> of this Importance, <Q>That they would employ none to <HI>Preach</HI> in any of their Pulpits, but such as either arrived unto them with credible <HI>Testimonials,</HI> or submitted themselves unto a solemn <HI>Trial</HI> of their Qua∣lifications for the evangelical Ministry.</Q> <HI>P.</HI> 4. And in <HI>Pag.</HI> 5. they say, <Q>In Conformity to this <HI>Watchfulness</HI> of our <HI>united Brethren,</HI> we cannot but in the most Publick Manner, call upon our Churches, that they beware of all undue <HI>Precipitancy,</HI> in their admitting <HI>unquallified Persons,</HI> to be received and employed, in the Character of <HI>Preachers</HI> unto them.</Q>—See, Page 6. — <Q>We do also solemnly advise all our People to beware of running after <HI>new Preachers</HI> of whose Endowments and Principles they have not had a reasonable Attestation, lest they unawares run themselves into shameful and woful Reflections. —</Q> And in Page 8, they say, <Q>We are not unsensible, that one Thing which has much exposed some <HI>injudicious People</HI> among us is, an Opinion that <HI>illiterate Men</HI> may be serviceable and admirable <HI>Preachers.</HI> Now inasmuch as the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have given this among their Instructions to their Emissaries to teach, <HI>that Learning is needless in a Minister; and if they understand the Gospel, it is sufficient.</HI> We are sorry that any of our People should be so <HI>besotted</HI> not to say so <HI>be-jesuited.</HI> When the Knowledge of the Tongues and Arts revived, Religion had a Revival with it: And tho' some unlearned Men have been useful to the Interests of <HI>Religion;</HI> yet no Man ever decried <HI>Learning</HI> but what was an Enemy to Religion, whether he knew it or no.</Q>—And then to conclude, they say Page 9, 10. </P>

<P>Upon the whole, as <HI>Luther</HI> observed, That GOD punished the primitive Churches with <HI>false Teachers,</HI> for their starving and slighting of their <HI>faithful Ministers;</HI> thus we fear the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> may suffer Mis∣chiefs in Time to come from <HI>false</HI> Teachers: And we see cause to ad∣mire the Compassion of Heaven unto this Land, that such dangerous Things have all this Time done so little Damage unto any of our Churches. But as the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> having been warned by the Apostles, <HI>That grievous Wolves would enter in among them,</HI> was after∣ward commended by our Saviour for so taking the Warning, that they <HI>tried them who said they were Apostles when they were not so, and found them Liars:</HI> Even so we would hope, that after this Day, no <HI>untried Persons</HI> will be entertained for <HI>Preachers</HI> in any of our Colonies.</P>

<P>There are also in this Province above an Hundred Reverend Ministers, who have appeared as a <HI>Cloud of Witnesses</HI> at this Day in the Cause of CHRIST, for these Churches, and our Gospel Constitution, who by their subscribed publick Testimonies, either as <HI>associated Bodies of Pastors,</HI> or by single Letters, shewing their Concurrence with the renowned Subscribers above, in Testifying against Intruders into the Ministry, and all enthusi∣astick, erroneous Itinerant Preachers, and illiterate irregular Exhorters.</P>
