<BIBL><HI>DEUTERONOMY, IV. 7, 8, 9.</HI></BIBL>
<Q>For what nation is there so great, who hath <HI>GOD</HI> so nigh unto them, as the <HI>LORD</HI> cur <HI>GOD</HI> is in all things that we call upon him for? And what na∣tion is there so great, that hath statutes and judg∣ments so righteous, as all this law which I set be∣fore you this day? Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY Christian Brethren, we are now assembled into the Divine Presence, on one of those anniversary days, in which every grateful heart must feel highly interested, and in which every soul is most devoutly called to express a sense of his dependence on Divine Providence, and thankful ac∣knowledgments to the FATHER of the universe. The duty which we are now solemnising, is most highly becoming a Christian people, and is of that kind which constitutes the sublimest part of worship, which intelligences can ren∣der to their CREATOR. In our usual addresses of the throne of grace we are looking for benefits; and the end of petition centres on self. In adoration, which is the most <HI>disinterested</HI> as well as most <HI>delightful</HI> of human duties, the mind is drawn forth from itself, by the view of Supreme Excellence; and the DEITY <HI>alone</HI> absorbs every attention.</P>
<P>Had man never sinned, there had been no bleeding vic∣tim, nor need of an Intercessor. And in the future state, when perfect holiness shall be restored, <HI>prayer</HI> shall cease, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope</HI> will cease; but <HI>adoration, praise, charity</HI> and <HI>love</HI> shall exist forever.</P>
<P>When the duty of praising GOD is rightly performed, there ever accompanies it a <HI>lively dispesition</HI> of mind. The heart is soothed and elevated, a divine pleasure <HI>expands</HI> the soul, and, being <HI>irradiated</HI> by the splendor of the <HI>Su∣preme Good,</HI> is <HI>absorbed</HI> in GOD, and raised above <HI>all</HI> world∣ly cares, allurements and amusements, to a <HI>peace and joy which the world cannot give or take away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025638_0005_0FCEAD331634D080"/>
The human mind, its principles, habits, modes of think∣ing and conduct will ever be greatly affected by the objects of its most frequent contemplation. This originates the different manners of the prince and the peasant But <HI>where</HI> is an object so calculated to enlarge and aggrandize the soul, and all its powers, and to lift it above all low and sor∣did motives, as the Divine Being when adored by us, in that amiable view in which the whole biblical volume pre∣sents HIM. But while the mind is elevated with joy rais∣ed by the act of praise above worldly concerns, and greatly enlarged by contemplating upon a Being so filled with per∣fection, it is also humbled as to the dust by the unavoida∣ble view of its own insignificance. <HI>The heavens are not clean in his sight, and the angels He chargeth with folly; what then is man!</HI></P>
<P>Such being the advantages of that religious service, which we are this day to offer to the Great Benefactor of the world, let us enter upon it with <HI>all</HI> those <HI>devout</HI> and <HI>enlarged</HI> principles, which the <HI>high objects</HI> of gratitude now demand.</P>
<P>To inspire us with these elevated sentiments, few porti∣ons of the sacred scriptures are better adapted than the text which I have read to you. In this you see the <HI>holy prophet,</HI> in whom the legislator and the father of his peo∣ple are most admirably united, and beautifully illustrated, leading the chosen tribes to realize, that the favor of GOD and the smiles of heaven, are not only the greatest bless∣ings, but the highest aggrandisement of any nation. At the close of a life filled with the most unremitting labors, disinterested exertions, and unceasing vigilance and prayer for their prosperity, he had now been recounting the in∣stances of Divine goodness, which they had experienced, that by impressing their minds with the beneficence of GOD, he might persuade them to feel the greatness of their obli∣gations, and "<HI>not suffer them to depart from their hearts all the days of their lives, but</HI> to <HI>teach them</HI> to <HI>their sons, and their sons' sons.</HI>"</P>
<P>"<HI>For what nation is there so great, who hath</HI> GOD <HI>so nigh unto them, as the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>is, in all things that we call upon him for!</HI>"—We are peculiarly happy in having an in∣spired prophet to assure us, <HI>in the name of</HI> GOD, of what the history of ages and the experience of the world have united to convince us, that no people is so truly great, as that which hath the LORD their GOD <HI>nigh unto them.</HI> In this respect the nation of Israel appeared highly illustrious. Their GOD, in whom they trusted, going before them in a pillar of cloud by day and of sire by night, and <HI>being a very present help in time of trouble.</HI> To all their greatness were they raised by the hand of GOD. Divine Sovereignty, whose <HI>power</HI> is ever connected with <HI>benevelence,</HI> beheld a
<PB N="7" REF="025638_0006_0FCEAD34C8E5B9A8"/>people whom HE <HI>loved,</HI> clanking the chains of slavery under Egypt's lords; HE <HI>beheld the oppressor and the oppressed;</HI> HE <HI>saw the tears of the oppressed, and there was none to comfort them; and on the side of the oppressor there was power, but they had no comforter:</HI> HE saw this, with that <HI>frown</HI> of indigna∣tion which commands empires to their original <HI>nothingness,</HI> and raised the Son of Amram to emancipate Israel from slavery, and to lead them to a land of liberty, to the confu∣sion of their enemies, and the destruction of their tyrants. The father of that people was chosen by Heaven, on account of his faith and piety, to be one, in whom not only his children, but all the families of the earth should be blessed: blessed with a Prince to arise and sway the sceptre of righteousness, and to erect, on the ruins of all unjust do∣minions, a kingdom of the most perfect government, of the wisest laws, and filled with the most virtuous and happy subjects, enjoying peace, liberty and bliss. To what <HI>high prosperity</HI> was that nation afterwards raised, <HI>entirely</HI> by the <HI>sovereign</HI> favor of HEAVEN! In an age of great darkness. when the governments of the world were systems of oppres∣sion, and their subjects educated to believe that they were born to be slaves to the will of tyrants, this people were illuminated in the knowledge of the principles of the <HI>noblest</HI> truths; <HI>truths</HI> to which the superior improvements of mo∣dern times bear the most honorable testimony, and acknow∣ledge that they are incapable of greater perfection, and that truly there was the finger of GOD. While other nati∣ons were ruled by oppressors, <HI>neither fearing</HI> GOD <HI>nor re∣garding man, they</HI> were blessed with one, whose ruling prin∣ciple was the most disinterested love to his people, as was most amply evinced in that most benevolent prayer of his, that they might be saved, to which he added, "<HI>if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of the book which</HI> THOU <HI>hast written.</HI>" In him we behold a prophet, a legislator, and the father of his people, united to which we might add one who could say. "I fear my GOD and HIM alone." By him designated and raised up for that people, they were blessed with such a system of religious and civil polity, blended with each o∣ther—a system so calculated to answer many grand and no∣ble designs in Divine providence; a system so calculated to produce patriotism, mutual love and the closest political union, as witness their laws for triennial assemblies, those for the prevention of perpetual slavery, those for the relief of every species of distress, that, to this day, Moses is ve∣nerable as a legislator; but in former days, their laws, their government, and their enlightened policy were the admiration and envy of the world.</P>
<P>Thus were they aggrandised by the goodness of the Di∣vine Sovereign. <HI>By this alone;</HI> for in the history of six thousand years, not a single instance, deserving a parrallel,
<PB N="8" REF="025638_0007_0FCEAD35FAEB8AB8"/>is to be found, in which a nation has arisen from obscurity, slavery, wretchedness, or the ignorance attending despotick governments, to be blessed with a system of religious and civil polity, inducing liberty and happiness, <HI>unless favored by a Divine revelation,</HI> or <HI>the immediate hand of</HI> HEAVEN. As Israel rose to liberty and glory by the sovereign goodness of GOD, as their safety and prosperity depended entirely on having <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>their</HI> GOD <HI>near unto them in all that they called upon</HI> HIM for, how soon did they sink into infamy and contempt, when, because of their high and long repeated ingratitude, they were rejected of their Divine Protector.</P>
<P>To apply these remarks to our own nation—To what glo∣ry have <HI>we</HI> risen <HI>by the smiles of</HI> HEAVEN? To what else can we impute that lustre, independence and glory, which have rendered us the admiration of astonished Europe? Many have been the times, in which we have been reduced to say, <HI>We can only stand still and see the salvation of our</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Few of us but may recollect those seasons of national dis∣tress, in which our tribes mournfully repaired to the house of the LORD, <HI>feelingly</HI> impressed with the belief, that if we were <HI>ever</HI> saved, it must be by the ROCK that is higher than man. Then we fully believed the infinitely interesting truths, which we are now contemplating: then we needed no prophet to inculcate them, as the immediate message of GOD. We were ready to receive them. And when the GREAT SOVEREIGN, who disposeth of empires according to His will, looked down from the throne of his Glory on our distress, we gladly reassumed "the harp that had been hanging on the willows," and unitedly acknowledged, <HI>Had not the</HI> LORD <HI>been on our side, when our enemies rose up against us, the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our souls.</HI> How important is it that these sentiments be indelibly impressed upon our minds, and that we ac∣knowledge, with an eastern prince, "Thou Most High, rul∣est in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth." Never was there a people more truly origina∣ted and protected by Divine Providence than this; and ne∣ver was the hand of GOD more evidently and signally lift∣ed up on behalf of any people, in a season of the most trying emergency, than we ourselves have seen. How signal the blessing of a temporal savior, designated by Divine Provi∣dence, in the day of our distress, most inimitably qualified with abilities and patriotism for the arduous work of giv∣ing empire to the nation; a character so renowned among the nations for great and different talents, so happily blen∣ded and concentrating in the same mind, that the sons of Israel had not more real cause to believe that their deliver∣er, from the house of bondage, was sent to them by the 'I AM,' who appeared on the mount, than we have, to be assur∣ed that ours was purposely raised by HEAVEN, for the day
<PB N="9" REF="025638_0008_0FCEAD384EE42240"/>when his country called for his important services. If we consider that system of government under which we live, and that happiness which it has diffused thro all ranks; if we recollect that this land is become known thro' the world, a land of liberty, political, civil and religious, where all those vain distinctions, on which numbers have thought themselves entitled to almost every homage, and secured from the just consequences of their crimes and guilt, are here not to be found; a land where obscurity of birth or fortune does not prevent the honors due to real merit; a land where the Jew and the Greek have equal reception, and where liberal sentiments, on the rights of human na∣ture, have so far prevailed, that there have been the most noble exertions, that the prophecy of Noah, concerning a very unhappy branch of his family, which for ages has been most astonishingly verified, might come to a conclusion, and hereafter the desendants of Shem and Ham and Japhet might stand on a level, and acknowledge each other as brethren. <HI>What nation is there so great, who hath</HI> GOD <HI>so nigh unto them, as the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>is, in all things that we call upon Him for? and what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous</HI> as has been given to this favored land? But upon a day like this, it becomes us more particularly to enumerate the instances of that real great∣ness, to which this nation has been raised by the smiles of HEAVEN. If any degree of it consists in the too customary, but now exploded, method of measuring the greatness of a kingdom by the extent of territory, we might boast of greater glory than some of the most famous and potent na∣tions, which have figured in the page of history. But Ju∣dea, Greece and other states have become renowned, not by extensive territory, but by their noble and liberal policy, their wise laws, their general liberty, their high patriot∣ism, and the great encouragement to every thing which might conduce to heighten, aggrandize and bless the sub∣jects of government. Let us then endeavour to find that real greatness to which we have been raised, in those cir∣cumstances in which we have justly become the admiration of the world. And here we might observe, that it is a na∣tion in which, from the earliest settlement of it, there have existed the most noble and valuable institutions, sacred and civil, which have been transmitted from the fathers to the children, and have been preserved hitherto to descend to rising generations. However true it may be, that the first inhabitants of this country, may have imbibed and possessed many prejudices peculiar to those days, and to which scarce any people have been known to rise wholly superior, still we must venerate them for their pious regard to pos∣terity, and for their noble institutions, sacred and civil, the benefit of which we now enjoy, and by which we have aris∣en
<PB N="10" REF="025638_0009_0FCEAD39BB0D4388"/>to a most eminent distinction, and enviable glory to the surrounding world.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that it is a nation in which the government is truly representative. This can be said of no one so truly, as of that in which we live. In the system of the Jewish legislator, the high civil and sacred offices, tho' for Divine reasons, were limited to a tribe or a fami∣ly. There is an European nation, to which we were once most nearly allied, that boasts of a representative govern∣ment, but where the first legislative offices are compleatly hereditary, and in the others but a very inconsiderable proportion of the people are represented. If we survey the European states, called republican, they are far from being strictly representative. Privileged orders are found in every civilized country of Europe, possessing powers incompatible with a just representation. This favored people only, to whom <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>has been nigh in all that they have called upon Him for,</HI> has been chosen by HEA∣VEN, to realize the fullness of a blessing resulting from this circumstance of civil government. Here any one possessed of property sufficient to make him feel himself interested in the prosperity of the nation, and small indeed is the ex∣ception, has a voice in the election to the first offices of state. This is a circumstance that constitutes no little part of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greatness to which we have been raised.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that this people have had the sin∣gular felicity of living under a government, in which there has been a very high enjoyment of all the rights of nature. Nature gives no one a right to oppress his fellow creatures, nor to hold in servitude his body or mind, his faith or ac∣tions. Accordingly no one is here permitted to assume ar∣bitrary distinctions, and unjust superiority; none possesses ci∣vil or religious powers, but what are voluntarily conferred; and the Savior's command, to call no man Rabbi or Father, seems to have been received, and in a great measure ac∣complished. Those high founding titles, many of which should be appropriate to JEHOVAH alone, under which villainy was sheltered from justice, made sacred and vene∣rated by deluded ignorance, and by which, for too many ages, the <HI>greatest scourges</HI> of the human race have, in the <HI>name of</HI> GOD, carried on the most ambitious and tyrannick designs, both in political and religious matters, and by which they have made nations, kept by their policy in the most consummate ignorance, tamely to submit to the most cruel impositions, sanctified by the name of a BEING whom they justly adored, are in this nation not to be found. This people by means of the valuable institutions transmitted to us from the rathers, for promoting useful knowledge, have become too enlightened for the impositions of any, who should come to us like the prophet of Mecca, with the sword in
<PB N="11" REF="025638_0010_0FCEAD3B488BF918"/>one hand and the Koran in his other. The rights of nature have at length found an assylum in this favored land. Here we make the laws by which we choose to be bound, and profess and peaceably practise that mode of religion, by which we are inclined to worship the GOD of our fathers.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that we live under a government, in which every kind of useful industry is most liberally en∣couraged. Separate from the incitement arising from se∣veral legislative acts, there have numerous societies origi∣nated from the patriotism and publick spirit of influential persons, which have excited general emulation for excel∣lence and perfection, in the various arts of useful industry. Industry has ever been found successful in raising states and empires, even of the most unpromising beginning, to ranks of the first eminence. An industrious people will ever be a flourishing and happy people. Under despotick govern∣ments there is but little encouragement for the useful arts; in republics they have ever found the highest patrouage, and the greatest perfection. In a nation as this, where in∣dustry <HI>finds</HI> the most flattering wishes of individuals emu∣lous of improvement so fully gratified; where our labors are not only rewarded by the honors of the great, but where they are secured in the profits arising from them, without the danger of their being subjected to the never ceasing demands of tyranny, what a prospect of rising greatness presents itself to every view. Whoever labors in this country enjoys the good of his labor; and is secured in his possessions, while his children arise and are benefited by the industry of a parent. And this, you will easily per∣ceive is a much greater blessing, than if it were possible that every want of the individual were supplied by the publick. Necessity brings action, and action is the life and beauty of the world. If the Almighty were to supply us with the gratification of every desire without our labor and exertion, what would the world be, but a scene of idle∣ness and in inactivity. More than half the beauty of creati∣on would be lost. It is an happy law of nature therefore, that blessings are offered to our acquisition, not to our in∣ert reception. And the necessity of this labor originates all those arts and improvements, which adorn society, and call forth that beautiful variety of talents, which would otherwise lie concealed from human views. It is kind in Providence, that we should be obliged to labour, and it is the happy privilege of this nation, that industry receives every encouragement. It is a greater act of charity in the publick, both to the morals and enjoyment of individuals, to enable them to acquire possessions, than if it gave to their inactive wishes. And the same observation may ap∣ply to acts of private charity; for an individual to enable another to acquire wealth for himself, rather than to give
<PB N="12" REF="025638_0011_0FCEAD3CBAA45058"/>without inciting him to personal activity, is more favorable for his morals and felicity. In addition to those wise laws, and statutary institutions for promoting industry in gener∣al, we may consider the provisions that are made, and the funds that exist, for the general diffusion of science. These originated, in several of the states, with the fathers of this country, to whose provident wisdom for the welfare of their descendants we are indeed greatly indebted. Their literary institutions we have preserved; the happy effect of them has been, a great degree of intelligence through all ranks, most highly favorable to the existence of that li∣berty which is found in republicks. While our higher seats of literature prepare the rising generation for the more important departments of community, the subordi∣nate schools of learning diffuse such a portion of know∣ledge, as serves the purpose of enabling the people to study, and value their privileges; and <HI>both united</HI> form one of the <HI>greatest bulwarks</HI> of rational, civil, political, social and religious liberty. And we ought not to be unmindful, that these institutions for the general diffusion of know∣ledge among the lower ranks of the people, is a very sin∣gular blessing, in which we are privileged above all the na∣tions of the world. While these continue to exist, despot∣ism and tyranny can never find support. These therefore, constitute <HI>no little part</HI> of that greatness, to which we have been raised by the smiles of HEAVEN.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that we live in a nation, in which we are taught to seek for our highest glory in the prosperi∣ty of all nations. The period has at length arrived, in which superior improvements in all liberal science has ve∣rified what has been formerly taught <HI>only in the Christian religion,</HI> that the truest happiness of the individual, or of the part, lieth in the prosperity of the whole. Enlighten∣ed policy and true Christianity concentrate in the same ob∣ject, and inculcate the desired felicity of the world: Per∣haps, for this enlightened policy, we are originally indebt∣ed to <HI>christianity,</HI> though infidelity and deism are not wi∣ling to acknowledge it. But that the fact exists, witness the disinterested exertions for general liberty, and socie∣ties that are formed to patronise the abolition of general slavery. How different this from the spirit and disposition of former ages and nations? Patriotism indeed has been anciently carried to a surprising height: but how illiberal the principle! A kind of love, which justified the most en∣venomed hatred to foreign nations, a love as far removed from the enlarged principles of true benevolence, as the af∣fection of selfishness towards those who are its friends, from the philanthropy of a christian, <HI>who loves his enemies, and prays for them that curse him.</HI> How great were the preju∣dices of the Jew and the Greek? and among Christian nati∣ons,
<PB N="13" REF="025638_0012_0FCEAD3E6611F8C0"/>how common to find one people seeking for national aggrandisement, on the reproach or ruin of another? The christian system has taught its disciples to view the world as a large brotherhood, and to exercise a benevolence as <HI>extensive as the creation of</HI> GOD. Late improvements in knowledge, whether acquired by study, experience, or com∣merce, have in a great measure removed those prejudices, which formerly existed: and have taught us that christian benevolence and enlightened policy are closely united.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that we live under a government in which there is existing a great degree of equality among the people. In despotick governments this would be very unfavorable to their <HI>existence.</HI> Laws are therefore made, which will ever produce great inequalities among the peo∣ple, in all nations which are not republican. By reason of these inequalities, it is very evident, that the enormous powers of a part of the community over the other, who are in many instances the most meritorious, have been so long supported. In governments where these inequalities are maintained by law, it is not uncommon to find in the same family, one a nobleman, and another but a few de∣grees above beggary; and all this for no other reason, but that the former happened to be the eldest son, and conse∣quently the heir of all the family honor, and wealth, and titles, and dignities. This law for the maintenance of in∣equalities, so necessary in monarchial governments, is a remnant of the ancient fendal system, but most unjust, and highly disgraceful to an enlightened age. A law somewhat similar existed in this state, which admitted the eldest male to an equality with any two of his brethren, and that fre∣quently to the manifest injury of the family. But we are happy to find that law exists no more. Inequalities, and extreme ignorance in the lower ranks, constitute no little part of the policy of all despotick governments, in which they originated, and which <HI>they only</HI> are interested to sup∣port, as the <HI>grand secret</HI> of monarchial existence. In repub∣lics, different principles are necessary, and all that equali∣ty that nature has made, except what may arise by superi∣or industry, or the spontaneous bestowments of a grateful people may render a propriety to exist, ought to be sup∣ported.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that we live in a land where the people are contented and happy. This is evident in the ge∣neral emulation to excel in all those useful arts by which their country may be benefitted, in their peaceable and quiet attention to their own and family interests, by their veneration of the laws of the land, the few complaints of oppression and the scarcity of any event that has the ap∣pearance of insurrection. In the class of the unhappy, we find but few, except those reduced to misery and wretched∣ness,
<PB N="14" REF="025638_0013_0FCEAD40252FE5C0"/>by utter privation of all sober principles, and a course of licentious conduct. And no form of government can bless unprincipled minds. As to the sober and worthy part of community, they eat the bread of industry, they la∣bour, enjoy the benefit of their labor, and are happy. <HI>Few</HI> are there who know the wants of extreme poverty; <HI>few</HI> so straitened in their circumstances, but can allow themselves the proper seasons of rejoicing with their friends, and cultivating the social virtues; <HI>few</HI> but can obey the calls of humanity, and contribute for the relief of the distressed. The poor of our land, and such the Savior says ye shall al∣ways have with you, will unite with us to venerate those laws, by which provision is made to prevent their extreme sufferings, and the class of those who are in needy circum∣stances, will <HI>love</HI> a country, in which private charity is not a <HI>stranger,</HI> and in which the poor of our land are fed with bread.</P>
<P N="2">2. The text inculcates a duty in consequence of being thus highly favored by the smiles of HEAVEN. <HI>Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart, all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons.</HI> Our duty is first, to be sensible that because the LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>has been nigh unto us,</HI> we have been raised to all that greatness, which our eyes have seen; and we are grateful∣ly to remember from whom we have received all our privi∣leges and blessings. What the same prophet spake to Is∣rael, may be applied to us, <HI>Not because ye are more righteous than any other people, but because the</HI> LORD <HI>had a delight in your fathers,</HI> that this land has been given unto you, and that ye have had the LORD <HI>your</HI> GOD <HI>so nigh unto you, in all that ye have called upon</HI> HIM <HI>for.</HI> Whence is it, that we have de∣rived all this greatness, that we enjoy the greatest liberty, and live under the most righteous government, that we have the best laws in the world, and are free from every species of oppression? Is it because we have more wisdom and power, and our princes, men who sear GOD, been more highly illuminated, and possessed of greater benevolence to the publick? The enquiry still meets us, whence is all this? Surely "because the LORD our GOD has been nigh unto us in all that we have called upon him for." What ingrati∣tude, if our minds are not deeply impressed with a realizing sense of the greatness of our obligations? But, my christian auditors, there is one debt that we owe to GOD, compared to which all others are greatly lessened. This is the debt of gratitude for the gift of His SON, to bless the world with the light of the gospel, by which we have received the most pure and sublime religion, and which, by giving more en∣lightened sentiments of GOD, of human nature, and of the most interesting truths, hath not only elevated the hopes of
<PB N="15" REF="025638_0014_0FCE9E5A13E95210"/>individuals, but hath greatly meliorated the governments of the christian nations, diffused a grater mildness and leni∣ty in the complexion of the laws, the administration of jus∣tice, and the manners of the people at large. The refine∣ments of ancient Greece and Rome, though the boast of the enemies of our religion, were barbarism compared to the civilization to which some christian nations have attained. Witness the publick feasts in honor of the gods in the for∣mer, and the <HI>unrobed</HI> combats and cruel sports of the gladi∣ators, putting each other to death merely for the entertain∣ment of the people called <HI>refined,</HI> in the latter. When we recollect the great amelioration existing in nations favored with the light of the gospel, and the just ideas it has given of GOD and man, of the world, its origin, design and end, of the fall and recovery of the human race, of the great de∣signs of love reserved for the virtuous, of a future king∣dom to be realized in this world, before the consummation of all things, in which there is to be exhibited a perfect go∣vernment, the most righteous and benevolent laws, and a numerous people all happy in their obedience, we must ac∣knowledge this a blessing that might with propriety draw from us the language of an apostle, who was enraptured with its greatness, <HI>"The length and breadth, and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge!" Here is love indeed. "Oh the depth both of the wisdom and know∣ledge of</HI> GOD!"</P>
<P>But while we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to the LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, for that greatness to which we have been raised, it is our duty to transmit these sentiments of gratitude and sense of obligation to posterity. <HI>Teach them to thy sons and thy sons' sons.</HI> While the untutored savage "under the shade of his plantain" teaches his children, who are hanging upon his lips for instruction, the wondrous deeds of the fathers, surely christians ought with more pro∣priety, to impress upon the minds of their descendants, those more interesting truths which they have received, and the astonishing events which have taken place in former days, because <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD was nigh unto the fathers <HI>in all that</HI> they <HI>called upon him for.</HI> Thus spake the prophet of GOD to Israel. <HI>"And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart. And thou shalt teach them dili∣gently to thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou rifest up.</HI> Thus would the rising gene∣ration value the privileges which we shall have transmitted them, and realizing the greatness of their obligations, will unite piety with their virtue and industry, in rearing to perfection the great temple of liberty, which was founded in the days of their fathers.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that it is our duty to exert ourselves
<PB N="16" REF="025638_0015_0FCEAD42D50D8E90"/>for the continuance of those blessings which we have received. The time has been, when we thought the work finished, and our happiness as a nation perfected. We were careless, we were luxurious and idle. We were in debt to our friends, who had assisted us in the day of trouble and the hour of blood, with their treasures; and to our breth∣ren who had fought for us, who had bled, and many of whom had died, in their country's cause; we were at that time without any energetick system of national go∣vernment, and the political affairs of this country had a very dark aspect indeed: Yet for a time, the people were utterly regardless of the consequences of their inactivity; industry had greatly failed, vice and indolence made rapid incursions, and we were inattentive to the first and necessary step for remedying greater evils, than we had ever before experienced. Necessity and want at last reduced us to at∣tention, and the provident wisdom of the sober and prudent part of the nation animated the people to industry, led them to see the necessity of greater energy in the seat of government, and we became united in establishing such a system, which promises the continuance of those high privi∣leges, which we now possess. Still much is depending on our continued exertions. Look for a moment among nations, societies and individuals, and we find this invaria∣ble truth, that none flourish without diligence; that bles∣sings acquired are not continued without industry, and that they, whose circumstances require unremitting exertion, are the happiest people. It is not only true that diligence is necessary for the continuance of our privileges, but it is a happy circumstance, that thus it should be, for active en∣joyments are the only real ones. Whatever blessings are the fruit of constant industry, are the truest riches. None are permitted to sit down idly at the feast of life, and long be happy</P>
<P>We may in many respects be said to contribute, accord∣ing to our abilities, for the security of the blessings we en∣joy, and no one is to be excused from casting in his mite, to the great treasury of the national welfare.</P>
<P>Every honest and industrious man, who faithfully employs the talents committed to him by the Great Master of the world, and attends to that calling in life which is assigned him by Divine Providence, contributes a valuable portion to the publick good, serves his GOD and his country, and will at last receive the reward of <HI>a faithful servant.</HI> All are not formed to act in the higher departments of life, neither could all be useful there. Infinitely various are the de∣mands of the publick good, and the great variety of stati∣ons and employments in a civilized community are happi∣ly adapted to call forth that amazing variety of talents, which GOD hath, in such wisdom, distributed to his ration∣al
<PB N="17" REF="025638_0016_0FCEAD45A3783B10"/>creatures, for all that beautiful subordination, which constitutes no little part of the glory of this and the upper worlds. Here is then a large field, in which not only mul∣titudes, but every talent is called forth for action. While the Great LORD and Master is walking forth, and behold∣ing the inactive, his language is, "<HI>Why stand ye here idle all the day.</HI>" The industrious man, while pursuing that em∣ployment to which he has been called, is not only benefit∣ing himself and his family, but society and the publick: but the idle or inactive, while injuring himself, his morals and his family, is robbing society of its just demands. He is placed as a man among men, endued with abilities to do good to his fellow creatures, and society justly re∣quires him to be active and useful. What account can such render to their GOD or country? What self condemnation, in that awful crisis of human existence, when called by that VOICE, which none can refuse to hear, and summoned to render an account for the improvement of that reason, and those talents, with which they were invested, in the day that they were sent forth into society, with this command to be active and useful? To benefit the Almighty we can∣not; for if thou art righteous, what dost thou give him? But we may do good, and merit from our fellow creatures; and the Savior has informed us, that in the great day of retribution, he will accept our sincere and well meant ser∣vices to others, as if to Him. <HI>Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></P>
<P>We may again observe, that all wise institutions for the improvement of the human mind, for the education of the rising youth, for the encouragement of the various arts, and the incitement of industry in general, are contributions to the publick good.</P>
<P>Every parent and head of a family may render impor∣tant services to his country. In an ancient country, such were taught to consider their children as rather belonging to their country, than to themselves. In <HI>families</HI> it is that those pious maxims, virtuous principles, and useful precepts are taught and inculcated, by which the rising youth may fill their future stations in life with dignity and every pro∣priety. Here by the fostering care of a parent they are trained up for those employments, by which they may serve their country, and preserve and extend those privileges, which have been transmitted to them by their ancestors, as the most valuable of earthly legacies. How important then is the charge committed to every head of a family? How <HI>vast</HI> is the benefit which <HI>such</HI> may render their country, by forming their young and tender minds to usefulness and vir∣tue, and hereby rendering them blessings to the world? But farther, <HI>here it is,</HI> that those religious principles are last∣ingly impressed, by which infidelity and vice may receive
<PB N="18" REF="025638_0017_0FCEAD467B135638"/>an early check, and the rising youth may learn by the ex∣amples of their fathers whom they venerate, to revere the gospel of the Savior, and by which they may finally take an active part with their ancestors in the sublime and bea∣tific employments and entertainments of the world of glo∣ry. <HI>Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI> And never was there a pious and virtuous maxim more invariably accomplished and realized.</P>
<P>We may farther observe, that all endeavours to promote the prosperity of others is a contribution to the publick good. <HI>If one member be honored, the whole rejoice with it.</HI> It ought to be in society as in a family or a friendly circle, in which the whole body feel the prosperity of the individual as their own. And it is as really a fact, that every happi∣ness of an individual is, in its measure, the felicity of the whole, as in the natural body that the whole sympathize with the member. The virtuous man considers himself as a part of the community, and when he beholds the prosperi∣ty of others, or of his country, he lifts his eye to heaven, and thanks his GOD. The Divine Being has so connected us with each other, that none can live or act without inter∣esting community. The sin of the first parent has trans∣mitted misery through ages, and that not by the positive will of GOD only, but by the same law of connexion, which we now see existing between the head of a family or com∣munity and its members. On the contrary the virtue and usefulness of individuals will be diffused through the whole, and be transmitted to rising generations.</P>
<P>We may next observe, that the support of religion is a contribution to the publick good. By religion we do not intend to include any particular mode or form; for as the Savior said, <HI>The time cometh, yea is already come, that neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem, shall men worship the Father: GOD is a spirit; and they that worship him, must wor∣ship in spirit and truth.</HI> Different modes will ever be most edifying to men of different prejudices and educations. It seems as if the Savior had designedly omitted any particu∣lar directions in this respect. Great were the prejudices he had to encounter in his disciples. But instead of using force, he once observed, <HI>Many things have I to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</HI> But as to religion itself, the wisdom and experience of ages have sufficiently proved its near connection with the civil good. The ruler who fears GOD, must have the confidence of his subjects; and the same religion, which teaches the subjects to revere their Creator, commands them to be good subjects of civil go∣vernment, and to look upon the <HI>powers that be, to be ordain∣ed of</HI> GOD; to be good members of society, good neighbors, friends, parents, sons, masters, servants, and that <HI>every man,
<PB N="19" REF="025638_0018_0FCEAD4800677C30"/>wherein he is called, should therein abide with</HI> GOD. Religion alone, by giving solemnity to an oath, is the very bond of civil society. What would a society be, in which the members had no fear of GOD before their eyes? How would the culprit laugh at the executioner, and all the so∣lemn pomp and instruments of death, were it not for that fear of an unknown futurity, a Divine Legislator and Judge, which has not only more influence upon the human mind, than is frequently supposed, but is of <HI>more weight,</HI> in deterring from the greatest of human crimes, than <HI>all the solemn sanctions</HI> that were ever affixed to the laws of man. Hence the most celebrated legislators have found it neces∣sary to establish systems of religion. But if those religions, though filled with error, were necessary for the stability of empire, how much more the religion which came down from GOD, which exhibits the noblest virtues, all exemplified by its Divine Author, and in which we are called to practise <HI>whatsoever things are true, and honest, and just, and lovely, and commendable, and ever to study those things that make for peace</HI> and love. How important is religion then, and that it be countenanced by all ranks, while the fathers set the exam∣ple, by leading their children to the temple of JEHO∣VAH, to be early taught to adore the Great Benefactor of the world? The religion of the gospel formerly gave us this land; the same religion still preserves it for their chil∣dren; and our elders and princes are still venerable for their piety, while on the weekly solemnities they are leading forward the tribes of Israel to the mount of worship, the solemn assemblies, the temple of GOD. May this spirit be cherished by the rising age. and may the temple and the priest, the altar and the victim, which have existed for ages among unenlightened nations, never reproach a people, who may justly glory in superior light and growing advan∣tages. Let us never forget the religion of our fathers, the religion of Jesus, the bread of life, and the waters of life.</P>
<P>The whole plan of duty, and of our national prosperity, greatness and happiness in connection with it, are given us by JEHOVAN himself, and addressed, by his prophet, to a rising, flourishing commonwealth, like ours, in the same book from whence I have chosen my text; and they are summed up in piety and obedience, in religion and virtue. The superstructure of national happiness and glory is sure to rise upon such a foundation, and no other foundation can be laid, on which it can arise and find a permanent stability. To support it in the way of impiety, unrighteousness, pro∣fligacy, political arts, cunning and wickedness, is absurd and self-subversive. It is an inconsistency in nature, repug∣nant to the wise, holy, great and good plan of providence, and therefore the Almighty will frown with indignation
<PB N="20" REF="025638_0019_0FCEAD498016FEB8"/>upon it. In this divine plan, the duties of piety are of the highest order, and take place of all others. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>a∣lone must be exalted</HI> by us, as the object of our supreme wor∣ship, and of our best affections. We must cultivate the love &amp; fear of the LORD our GOD, who has been nigh unto our fa∣thers, and unto us their children, with the highest venera∣tion of his being and perfections, providences, word and works. The atheist is unfit for human society, and to be a member of civil community; for he disbelieves the being, omniscience and power of GOD, to whom the appeal is made as THE WITNESS OF TRUTH, AND THE AVENGER OF PERJURY. Neither is the deist greatly superior, who de∣nies a revelation attested by miracles, which none can dis∣prove, and one of which extorted from the lips of a centu∣rion, presiding at the execution of Jesus, this confession— "Surely this was a righteous man."—MIRACLES ALONE PROVE A REVELATION.</P>
<P>We may farther observe, that another important duty which we owe to GOD, our country and ourselves, is fer∣vent prayer for the peace and prosperity of our Jerusalem. <HI>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions sake, I will now say, peace be within thee.</HI> By this we shew a realizing sense of our obliga∣tions and dependence on that GOD from whom we have re∣ceived our blessings; and in this way we may hope to se∣cure the great love which HE hath exhibited to a highly favored land.</P>
<P>My christian brethren, let a view of the divine goodness excite us to rejoice in existence; but particularly that we had our existence in a land of light and liberty, political and religious. Existence itself is a blessing; but how much greater, to be assured that there is a divine government, and that goodness and benevolence preside over the uni∣verse? If this be so great a blessing, how much greater to be yourselves a part of that highly favoured people, who have had the LORD their GOD near unto them in all that they call upon HIM for? But if this be a blessing that adds to the happiness of our existence, how much more is it heightened by the consideration, that our existence will ne∣ver cease, and that the wise and virtuous, who improve their privileges, their reason talents, and opportunities for do∣ing good to their fellow creatures, and their country, shall not only forever live, but be forever advancing in beatific knowledge and happiness, in the contemplation of divine objects, and a vast and infinite plan of the most pleasing and astonishing wisdom and benevolence, till the whole soul be wrapped up in GOD; and the radiant glory of the SUPREME GOOD shall so entirely <HI>absorb</HI> the universe of virtuous semis, that there will be but <HI>one</HI> great object, <HI>one</HI> will, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> desire,
<PB N="21" REF="025638_0020_0FCEAD4B24381C28"/>and <HI>one</HI> end of <HI>every</HI> mind through the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> With this view <HI>what a blessing indeed is our existence!</HI></P>
<P>Let this view of the Divine Goodness lead us to imitate what we so much love and admire in GOD. His omnipo∣tence, his universal presence, and those great and astonish∣ing events which have surprised the world, and been ac∣knowledged the effect of Power Divine, can only be admir∣ed and praised; but we may be Godlike in goodness; and <HI>this</HI> is that attribute in GOD, which, among all his perfecti∣ons, <HI>crowns</HI> the whole with superior glory. If we are ca∣pable, this is a sufficient indication that thus GOD willeth.</P>
<P>Let a view of the Divine Goodness to ourselves, and our country, lead us to adore and praise the LORD our GOD, <HI>who has been so nigh to us in all that we have called upon Him for.</HI> There is scarce any power or faculty in human nature, but what may find a resemblance, though in a lower degree, in the animal world. But do we differ from them only in de∣gree? No, there is one faculty in which we differ in kind, and are essentially superior. This is our capability of knowing and resembling the Creator, and adoring his be∣nevolence. This is the superior glory of man. At the close of the fifth day's work of creation, GOD beheld his works, and pronounced them good; but lo! there was none found capable of knowing and adoring their Creator. Then JE∣HOVAH spake, <HI>LET US make man.</HI>—Man alone he beheld among all his works capable of knowing his goodness, and on behalf of all creation, animate and inanimate, as their common priest, capable of rendering thanksgiving and praise; and <HI>He said, Let them have dominion.</HI></P>
<P>But while the Divine Goodness to our favored land leads us to adore Him as on this day, let it also serve to shew us the nature of national vice and disobedience to that GOD <HI>who has been so nigh unto us.</HI> What are our sins, but a vio∣lation of those laws, by which alone as a people, or as in∣dividuals, we can arise to real greatness? The law is good as well as holy. Never did an individual, much less a peo∣ple, attain to true and permanent prosperity by vice and want of allegiance to the government of the Supreme Le∣gislator. Thus a prophet, in the name of GOD, addressed a once chosen people; <HI>Oh! that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments; then had thy peace been like a river, and thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as the waves of the sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My brethren,</HI> We are this day called to rejoice in the Divine goodness: to rejoice in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of HEAVEN on our country, on the labors of our hands, and for the nume∣rous comforts of family, of social and private life. As a testimony of our rejoicing, we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> day bringing our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, for a grate∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> acknowledgment of His bountiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Let the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of this day be a rational, manly, grateful and re∣ligious
<PB N="22" REF="025638_0021_0FCEAD4C98FF9110"/>joy—a joy that elevates and improves the mind, while it gladdens the heart.</P>
<P>What a suitable season is this to make the hearts of our fellow-creatures around us, particularly of the industrious and virtuous poor, to rejoice with us, and that as far as lieth in our power, there be no sorrowing foul; but that <HI>sighing and tears he wiped away,</HI> by our exercise of that chris∣tian charity and benevolence, which our holy religion re∣quires. Thus your prayers and your alms, your thanks∣giving and your good works, your joy and your labors of love would <HI>ascend up for a memorial before</HI> GOD. This would be the rejoicing of benevolence, a Godlike affection! a joy that would make us better, as it makes us happier. Thus <HI>would our light break forth as the morning, our righteous∣ness go before us, and the glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>would he our re∣ward.</HI></P>
<P>But in the midst of our rejoicing this day, as is natural to every grateful mind, remember our brethren or friends who as a nation or society may be filled with fore distress, are contending for the privileges we enjoy, or are exposed in property, liberty and life to the most imminent dangers. Such is the situation of an allied European people, who, in the days of our distress, generously assisted us, and openly be∣friended the cause of this country against our enemies. They are now emerging from darkness far greater than ours, to behold the light of general liberty. The true re∣ligion, accompanied with the knowledge of it, which hath for ages been concealed from the commonality, and which, when known, has ever been found favorable to universal li∣berty, is now beginning to break forth, its principles to he diffused, particularly those which respect the rights of hu∣man nature, and bids fair to emblazon speedily the whole European nations. But they are only arising as yet. Great and distressing will probably be their conflict with the wrath of united tyrants, who look forward with terror and dismay to the approaching fall of despotism, before those liberties and privileges that we enjoy will be established in that nation. Through what seas of blood have they been already obliged to wade in pursuit of this high object! but the price is not esteemed too great for a blessing dearer than life. While we sympathize with them in their dis∣tress, we ought particularly to lament, that it should be, or be thought, necessary to exile or sacrifice any, who were once highly valued by them, at the shrine of liberty; any who have been holden in the highest estimation in this country, and whose names are yet dear to almost every American. This however ought not to prevent our benevolent wishes for the prosperity of that cause, which, as it is the <HI>cause of human nature,</HI> a cause which the more it is investigated by every nation, the more it <HI>must</HI> be befriended; a cause which
<PB N="23" REF="025638_0022_0FCEAD4EB3B57CE0"/>as it involves in its consequences the liberty and happiness, not of a nation, or an age, but <HI>of ages and nations to come,</HI> we have every reason to believe that GOD will espouse it as <HI>His cause</HI> and crown it with success. The sun of liberty a∣rose in the west, and its light is rapidly diffusing to the east; and saith the holy prophet, "wrapp'd into future times," <HI>They shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory</HI> shall extend to <HI>the rising of the sun.</HI></P>
<P>But there are brethren and friends still nearer to us; al∣lied not by treaty, but by nature; bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, whom we should remember this day, in the midst of grateful rejoicing under the smiles of HEAVEN. They lived with us, but they have gone from us, to take their future residence in the distant parts of this land, where they are now exposed to the depredations of a mer∣ciless enemy. While we are rejoicing, they are perhaps this moment trembling under momentary uncertainty and perpetual danger. How insecure their lives and property! how often are their houses <HI>wrapp'd in flames,</HI> their wives and children taken by brutal violence, without regard or pity to age or sex, and led to long captivity, or put to a cruel death? The father leaves his family in the morning in peace, goes forth to his labors in the field, returns in the evening to gladden a dependent family; but alas, the sad reverse of fortune! Let imagination paint the scene which has been often realized.</P>
<P>That grateful joy in the bounties which we receive, and which we are this day enjoying, in the pleasant society of our families and friends, without any enemy to molest or make us afraid, should remind us of our brethren who once sat with us. This is but natural to a grateful and a gene∣rous heart. Thus, while we are sitting around the table, and partaking of the gifts of Providence, how common is it, to remember some absent friend or relation, who filled a now vacant seat on the former anniversary day? With the same propriety we ought this day to remember our breth∣ren in distress, and to raise a sympathizing heart and eye to the throne of grace, that the <HI>Father of love</HI> would protect them, and soon enable them to sit under the <HI>peaceful vine.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, let us this day remember our fellow creatures here and elsewhere, who may be in affliction. Let our hearts be filled with benevolence equal to our joy. <HI>Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> break every yoke asunder,</HI> and do our endeavours for the peace, liberty and happiness of all our fellow creatures. Then <HI>while the</HI> ALMIGHTY <HI>looketh down with a frown</HI> on the remaining iniquity of an highly favored land, HE <HI>may turn an eye</HI> to our deeds of charity and benevolence, with a countenance beaming with designs of infinite love.</P>
