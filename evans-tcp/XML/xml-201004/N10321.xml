<HEAD>A <HI>NARRATIVE,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>IEUTENANT Governor <HI>Colden</HI> re∣presented to his Majesty and Privy Council, that it would be greatly to the Advantage of the Inhabitants of the District of Land to the West∣ward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which had been granted by the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> to be under the Jurisdiction of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and that <HI>Connecticut</HI> River was a good and certain Boundary line to divide the respective Provinces; and furthermore, that <HI>Hudson's</HI> River was naviga∣ble a great Way into the Country; and that the Situation of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants was such as would naturally constitute that River the Centre of Trade and Commerce, for the Inhabitants of those Grants; by the Navigation of which they could easily send Exports to the City of <HI>New-York,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="013102_0003_0F8EBBDE797C0C98"/>and receive and return such Articles as they need∣ed: And that it would therefore be much more convenient and happy for them to be under the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WITH Respect to the Southwest Part of the Dis∣trict of Land aforesaid it must be confessed that <HI>Hudson's</HI> River must <Q>constitute the Centre of Trade,</Q> &amp;c. to the Inhabitants thereof. But Three Qurters or more of that District of disputed Lands, from the Contiguousness thereof to Lake Champlain, and remote Situation from <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, equally constitute Lake Champlain, Mon∣treal, &amp;c. the Centre of Trade for its Inhabitants.—Furthermore, it is no Way incompatable, pro∣vided the Inhabitants of the Southwest Quarter of the District aforesaid should Trade at <HI>New-York,</HI> although they may be supposed to be under the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> The following Exhibitions, will undoubtedly convince the impar∣tial Reader that the said Inhabitants would be under vastly greater Advantage, to trade at <HI>New-York,</HI> or any where else, on Proviso they should be re-annexed to the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> for then they would peaceably enjoy the Right of soil of Lands they possess, which, under the Juris∣diction of <HI>New-York</HI> they cannot. A Number of Families that have spent their Substance in pur∣chasing Lands of the Government of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> and in removing from a great Distance to the Premises, and in making Improvements thereon; provided they should be disinherited, would make a very indifferent Figure trading at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013102_0004_0F8EBBDF4511CE48"/>
HIS Majesty, ever graciously disposed to pro∣mote the Interest and Good of his Subjects, and viewing the Establishment of the jurisdictional Line between the respective Governments, as not interfering with the private Property of his Sub∣jects, and in this View of the Case, perceiving a manifest Convenience, at least for a Part of that District, to be annexed to the Province of <HI>New-York;</HI> and the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> not being notified of Tryal (which is supposed to be owing to the Neglect of their Agent) by which Means his Majesty and Council could have no In∣formation but from the Representations from <HI>New-York;</HI> came to a Determination of the jurisdicti∣onal Line <HI>Exparte;</HI> which is probably the Cause why it extended so far East as the west Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. This Event proved exceeding unfortunate to the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers: From which they may compute the Date of their Oppres∣sion from the Government of <HI>New-York;</HI> this put it in the Power of that crafty, desinging, &amp; monopo∣lizing Government, to exercise that Usurpation towards the Inhabitants aforesaid, exhibited in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>No sooner had <HI>New-York</HI> obtained the Jurisdic∣tion, than Governor <HI>Colden</HI> began to Patent, to cer∣tain celebrated Attornies and principal Gentleman in the Province, the very Lands on which the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers dwelt; and it is a more inex∣cusable and complicated Wickedness in Governor <HI>Colden;</HI> inasmuch as but a little before he perswaded his graciously disposed Majesty into an Opinion
<PB N="6" REF="013102_0005_0F8EBBE019535278"/>that it would be for the Advantage and Happiness of the Settlers aforesaid to be under the Jurisdicti∣on of <HI>New-York.</HI> A complaint of the Conduct of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> relative to their lay∣ing Patent upon Patent, as aforesaid, being laid be∣fore his Majesty, who with the Advice of his Privy Council was graciously pleased to prohibit the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> from Patenting any of the said District of Land patented by the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> as aforesaid, on Pain of his Majes∣ty's highest Displeasure. Notwithstanding, the same Lieutenant Governor <HI>Colden,</HI> Governor <HI>Dun∣more,</HI> and Governor <HI>Tryon,</HI> have, each and every of them, in their respective Turns in the Administra∣tion, presumed to violate the said Royal Command, by Patenting to certain of their own Favourites and Gentlemen of Influence, sundry valuable Tracts of Land contained in, and belonging to the prohi∣bited Premises; the most of which Land being at the Time of patenting in actual Possession and Oc∣cupancy by People claiming the same Lands by Virtue of prior Patents from the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI></P>
<P>NEXTLY, in the Course of this Narrative it is necessary to take a retrospective View to July Term, in the Year 1769, at which the Claimants under <HI>New-York,</HI> being Non-residents, brought Actions of Ejectment in the Supreme Court against sundry of the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> who were in actual Possession of the contested Pre∣mises: but part if not all of the Judges and At∣tornies being interested in the said subsequent Pa∣tents
<PB N="7" REF="013102_0006_0F8EBBE4505B58F0"/>from the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and some of the principal Attornies, Patentees of the iden∣tical Patents then on Tryal. And the Plaintiffs ap∣pearing in great Fashion and State, which, toge∣ther with their Fraternity of Land-monopolizers, made a briliant Appearance. But the Defendants appearing in but ordinary Fashion, having been greatly fatigued by hard Labour, wrought on the disputed Premises, made a very disproportionable Figure at Court; and, in fine, Interest, Connection, and Grandeur, easily turned the Case against the forlorn Defendants: The whole District of Inha∣bitants were greatly alarm'd at the Event that had begun to take Place, were in great Consternation, each Individual reading his own intolerable Dis∣truction from that which had already began.</P>
<P>STILL there was more Actions of Ejectment commenced against sundry of the Inhabitants, and the Sheriff of Albany County, by special Order from the Governor, was raising the Militia of the County to dispossess the Defendants aforesaid, of their Tenements. This was a most melancholy Scene—Women lamenting over their Children, and they crying; and Men pierced to the Heart with the most pungent Grief and Affection for them, and bitter Indignation at the approaching Tyranny of <HI>New-York.</HI> And what renders the Reflection of the Conflict more doleful, is the Con∣sideration of the extreme Fatigue, Hunger, and infinite Hardships the Inhabitants had undergone in the Settlement and Cultivation of a Wilderness Country: It still adds a twinge to the Smart to
<PB N="8" REF="013102_0007_0F8EBBE5EF97B740"/>take a retrospect on the Interim; and view the At∣tornies and wealthy Gentlemen in the Province (and most of them in the City) of <HI>New-York</HI> "which fared sumptuously every Day" perusing the old obsolete and abdicated Charter from King Charles to the Duke of York, and inspecting into the <HI>Ca∣bots</HI> and <HI>Hudson's</HI> exploring this Continent; and withal, inspecting closely, whether in ancient Time some Dutchman had not Possession of some part of the abdicated Premises; and by such round-about and salacious Pretences of deducing a Title, plan∣ing the Ruin of the Inhabitants aforesaid.—But to return to the Sheriff and the Posse of <HI>Albany</HI> County, who were in motion to dispossess the In∣habitants, Defendants aforesaid, and deliver their Tenements to the Claimants under <HI>New-York.</HI> The Inhabitants being thus drove to the Extremity of either quiting their Country and Possessions, or make forceable Opposition to the Sheriff and Posse. In this State of Desperacy they put on Fortitude, and chose the latter Expedient, and managed with that Oeconomy that they defeated the Sheriff in dispossessing them, without Bloodshed: Though it should be confessed that this Event was but partly owing to the Fortitude of the Inhabitants; the greatest Reason was this, the People of the Go∣vernment in general (but particularly those that compose the Posse of the said County of <HI>Albany</HI>) were fully perswaded and conscious, that the Cause of the Inhabitants was just; and that the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees was Oppressive and unjust: And there∣fore they would not hazard their lives to defend
<PB N="9" REF="013102_0008_0F8EBACD48F096E8"/>them in such an Usurpation of the Rights of their fellow Men.</P>
<P>THERE had before this time been several lesser Combinations of the People of those Grants to defend their Persons and Properties from the En∣croachments of <HI>New-York,</HI> which by them are call∣ed by the opprobrious Names of Riots, Mobs, Re∣bellion, Felony, &amp;c—After the ineffectual Mus∣ter of the Posse, the Land-Monopolizers in the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> adopted different Measures to accomplish their Designs; perceiving they could not raise a Militia, that would Fight for the Title of their Subsequent Patents, and they being a cringing, fawnig, deceitful Fraternity; not enured to the Horrors of War, or any thing Heroic, durst not Fight for their own Claims: Their accustom∣ed Way, to carry Paints, being to deceive, cheat and over reach the Commonality of their Species, under a Pretence of Law, Justice, good Govern∣ment, and a great pretended Zeal of Loyalty, &amp;c. They were therefore obliged to follow their old beaten Road of Politics, and by their Influence, caused to be indicted as Rioters, every of the most bold, spirited and leading Men, who were active in defending either their Country or themselves, against their most egregious and intreiguing Wiles; hopeing to make such an Example of them there∣by as to frighten the Rest into their despotic Mea∣sures.—The Inhabitants in general viewing this to be their Policy, guarded against it, and were active in defending themselves, their Friends and Neigh∣bours so indicted, being fully perswaded that the
<PB N="10" REF="013102_0009_0F8EBBE85EF811F0"/>Fraternity of <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees were the Fomen∣ters and Planers of those Indictments; and that they eventually, by such Stratagems, designed to avail themselves of the Fee-simple of the Lands which they, the aforesaid Inhabitants possessed. And as for the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees, and such part of the Authority and People as they could Influ∣ence, they were active, endeavouring by all and every Method to apprehend the Rioters (so called) and punish them as Criminals: The Struggles that ensued between the Parties relative to taking and defending Rioters, terminated in Wrath, Strife, and Ill-Will: The Consequences arising therefrom, (which are too prolix to be inserted) are very ingeniously summed up in these Words, "Where Envying and Strife is, there is Confu∣sion and every Evil Work." Tho' it is common (and almost without Exception) for both Parties to be more or less blameable in so long and spirited a Controversy; yet in the Instances before us, it is beyond Dispute certain, that the Yorkers act offensively, and the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers de∣fensively, which will more fully appear.</P>
<P>BUT to shorten this Narration, and yet make it intelligible, and exhibit to View, that those Gentlemen interested in the Lands contained in the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, by subsequent Pa∣tents from the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> have extended their Influence into the General Assem∣bly of the Government, and sway that whole Le∣gislative Body; the following Votes and Pro∣ceedings of that Assembly are here transcribed;
<PB N="11" REF="013102_0010_0F8EBBE97AD088A8"/>and also, the Votes and Proceedings of the Ge∣neral Committee for the Inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants in Answer thereto: And like∣wise, the Acts passed by the Legislative Body aforesaid, the 9th of March Ultimo, and Remarks on the same; which here follow in their order, as they were published in sundry public News-Pa∣pers in <HI>America.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>"DIE SABATI, 10 Ho. A. D. 5th February, 1774.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"MR. <HI>Brush,</HI> (in behalf of Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> Chair∣man) from the Grand Committee, reported, that he was directed by the said Committee, to make the following Report to the House, viz. That the said Committee having taken into Consideration, the Petition of <HI>Benjamin Hough,</HI> in behalf of him∣self,
<PB N="12" REF="013102_0011_0F8EBBE9C259F1A8"/>and many of his Majesty's Subjects, inha∣biting the County of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and the North-Eastern District of the County of <HI>Albany;</HI> com∣plaining of many Acts of Outrage, Cruelty, and Oppression, committed against their Persons and Properties by the <HI>Bennington</HI> MOB, and the Dan∣gers and Injuries to which they are Daily exposed, and imploring that this House will take them under their Protection, and secure them against future Violence; and the said Committee, having also duly considered the several Proofs and De∣positions presented in support of the Truth of the said Petition, do therefore Resolve,</P>
<P N="1">"1, THAT it appears to this Committee, that there at present prevails in part of the County of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and in the North-Eastern District of the County of <HI>Albany,</HI> a dangerous and destructive Spirit of Riot and Licentiousness, subversive of all Order and good Government; and that it is be∣come an intolerable Grievance, which requires im∣mediate Redress.—</P>
<P N="2">"2, RESOLVED, That it appears to this Com∣mittee, that many Acts of Outrage, Cruelty, and Oppression have been there perpetrated by a Num∣ber of lawless Persons, calling themselves the <HI>Bennington</HI> MOB, who have seized, insulted, and terrified several Magistrates and other civil Offi∣cers, so that they dare not exercise their respec∣tive Functions, risqued Prisoners for Debt, as∣sumed to themselves military Commands, and ju∣dicial Power, burned and demolished the Houses
<PB N="13" REF="013102_0012_0F8EBBEA76194610"/>and Property, and beat and abused the Persons of many of his Majesty's Subjects, expelled them from their Possessions, and put a Period to the Administration of Justice, and spread Terror and Destruction through that Part of the Country which is exposed to their Oppression.</P>
<P N="3">"3, RESOLVED, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that the Complainants before this House and others, who inhabit Part of that Colo∣ny, and from Respect to Government, will not countenance or be concerned in the said riotous Proceedings, are exposed from the Violence of the Rioters to eminent Danger, both in Persons, and Properties, and that they stand in Need of imme∣diate Protection and Succour.</P>
<P N="4">"4, RESOLVED, That it appears to this Com∣mittee, that <HI>Ethan Allen, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, Robert Cochran, Peleg Sunderland, Silvanus Brown, James Breakenridge, and John Smith,</HI> are principal Ring-Leaders of, and Actors in the Ri∣ots and Disturbances aforesaid, and that it is there∣fore the Opinion of this Committee, that an hum∣ble Address be presented to his Excellency, de∣siring that He would be pleased to issue a Procla∣mation, offering a Reward of Fifty Pounds for apprehending and securing any or either of the Persons above named, in his Majesty's Goal in <HI>Albany;</HI> and commanding the Magistrates, and other Civil Officers of the Counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> to be active and vigilent in suppressing the said Riots, and preserving the Public Peace
<PB N="14" REF="013102_0013_0F8EBBEB3B5B2CD8"/>and good Order, as well as for bringing to Justice the Perpetrators and Authors of said Riots.</P>
<P N="5">"5, RESOLVED, That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that a Bill be brought in, more ef∣fectually to suppress the said riotous and disor∣derly Proceedings, maintain the free Course of Jus∣tice, and for bringing the Offenders to condign Punishment; which Report he read in his Place, and afterward delivered it in at the Table, where the said Resolutions were severally read a Second Time, Resolved that this House doth agree with the Committee in their said Resolutions.</P>
<P>"ORDERED, That a Bill be brought in, pur∣suant to the last Resolution, and that Mr. <HI>Brush,</HI> and Col. <HI>Ten Broeck,</HI> prepare and bring in the same. Ordered, That Capt. <HI>Delancey</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> wait on his Excellency the Governor with the fore∣going Address and Resolutions of the House."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nathan Clark,</HI> Chairman of the Committee of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers aforesaid, ordered the Clerk to read the Resolves and Votes aforesaid, to the general Committee, which was accordingly read sundry Times, and the following Draught being presented in Answer thereto, to the Publick Meeting; Seven Persons were selected and chosen out of the said general Committee, to examine the same, and report their Opinion thereon, which here follows.</P>
<P>"WHEN we consider the numberless Troubles,
<PB N="15" REF="013102_0014_0F8EBBEBFB7E1A40"/>and almost insurmountable Difficulties which our infant Settlements have been forced to struggle with, since its first Beginning, which have been occasioned by an unequal and biassed Administra∣tion of Law, ever since our unhappy Misfortune of being annexed to a Government in which the Interest of the greater Part of the leading Gen∣tlemen thereof are in direct Opposition to our's. The tyrannical Measures they take to enslave us, (we hope) will not fail to justify us in the follow∣ing Arguments and Resolves thereon; for we think it an intolerable Hardship, and Piece of inhuman Cruelty, that we cannot be said to give sufficient Proof of our Loyalty and Obedience to Govern∣ment but at the Resignation of our whole Fortunes, in the Purchase and Improvement of which, we have suffered an Infinity of Hardships. Yet, at the same Time, impressed with a Sense of Grati∣tude, we return our thankful Acknowledgment to these worthy Gentlemen, Governor <HI>Tryon,</HI> and sundry of His Majesty's honorable Council, for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> for their signal Fa∣vours to us in some Time past; which has, in some Degree, alleviated and supported us, under our heavy Troubles and Oppressions. But when we consider that his Excellency is about to em∣bark for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and while we view the Spirit of the General Assembly, in their Resolves; we cannot but reflect with some Regret, on what may of Consequence prove the Result (without an Alteration) of their present Opinion; but there
<PB N="16" REF="013102_0015_0F8EBBECDA97D0C8"/>are scarce any Circumstances that entirely exclude Hope; therefore we are not yet in total Dispair: For this Moment we happily call to Mind, that the General Assembly of the same Province, about two Years ago, did annex all that Part of the <HI>Bay</HI> Province, West of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, to that UN∣LIMITED County of <HI>Albany;</HI> but their avarici∣ous Grappling not being of a sufficient Strength for such an unreasonable Burthen, it failed, by which they lost their ideal Booty.</P>
<P>"THE candid Reader will doubtless observe, that in the Resolves of the Assembly afore∣said, there is not a single Word mentioned in Re∣gard to the Title of the Land contested for, but that they level all their Spleen, and point all their Malice at notorious Rioters, as they call them, and make a pretended Shew and Figure, as though they were great Sticklers for good Order and Government; although at the same Time every Person of common Sense, who has had any Ac∣quaintance and Knowledge of the Controversy, absolutely knows, that our goodly Land, with the Labour thereon, is the only subject Matter, and grand Object of the whole Controversy; and give the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> but that, and the Matter would be accomplished to their eternal Satisfaction; and it is presumed the Words Riotous, Disorderly, Licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees and pre∣sent Occupants, for the whole Course of the suc∣ceeding Century.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013102_0016_0F8EBBED965F6EA8"/>
"FOR the Truth of the Case is, the Executors of the Law, are most (if not all) of them the pre∣tended Claimants to the Lands whereon the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees and Occupants dwell, and their Judgments on Writs of Ejectment, brought by the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees, have not hitherto failed to correspond with their imaginary Inter∣ests; but were they honest Men they would not undertake to be Judges in their own Case, or in any other wherein the Resolution thereof would make a President, for their own, especially in Title of Land wherein Judge and Plaintiff are connected in one common Interest: such a Distribution of Law is contrary to the Law of Reason and Nati∣ons.—</P>
<P>"Therefore our Case stands thus, if we submit to their Execution of Law, and become obedient and submissive Subjects of their designing Govern∣ment, we must soon yield to be their Tenants and Slaves; and we cannot see Reason to conform to any Law, or such Branches of it, as will apparent∣ly bring us and our Posterity into Bondage, or manifestly deprive us of our Property; but inas∣much as we boldly adhere to the Maintenance of our Property, which to us is very precious, as it would be to the <HI>New-Yorkers,</HI> was it in their hands; we find it is immediately recommended to the Go∣vernor of the Province by the General Assembly, to issue his Proclamation, Offering therein large Sums of Money to apprehend those notorious
<PB N="18" REF="013102_0017_0F8EBBEE4ADB1550"/>Rioters (as they are pleased to stile them) but any one who has had Opportunity to read the Stipula∣tion and particular Articles of the public Faith, pledged by the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> to the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees and Settlers, dated in July Anno Domini 1772, will immediately find a suf∣ficient Reason for the Governor's not signing such a Proclamation; for it must indeed be shocking to common Sense when the Reader comes to ob∣serve what notorious Complaints, and most horrid Accusations are set forth in the Resolves of the General Assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> mentioned in the fore Part of this Paper, against Thousands of hard labouring, industrious, honest Peasants, who are in Truth loyal Subjects of the Crown of Great-Britain, for their Violations of Law and Govern∣ment; when at the same Time the following ex∣press Orders from his Most Sacred Majesty, to that litigious Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> will plainly show that they do not make the least Hesitation, to rebel and act in direct Opposition to the Autho∣rity of the Crown, when (as in the present Case) they show a Disposition to take Advantage of the minor Part of those under their Government; and throw them into Contention and Disorder; and thereby build their Fortunes on the Ruin of the pretended Aggressors; and all under the specious Pretence of good Order and Government which is in Fact what they eventually aim at, as will appear by the following Order.</P>

<P>"NOTWITHSTANDING this Prohibition, and one or two more of the same general Import, and from the same Authority, the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> have lapped their Patents on the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> Charters, and in Consequence thereof demand at Common Law, the Lands on which the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees and Occupants dwell; and from hence has arisen the numerous Troubles and Disturbances, between the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and its discontented Subjects, the Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> This has also been the Source of all Licentiousness and Confusion, Riot∣ousness, &amp;c. complained of by that Government, against the Settlers aforesaid.</P>
<P>"AND whereas the true State of our Grants hath been already laid before the worthy Lords of the Board of Trade and Plantation, and they hav∣ing considered, and wisely deliberated upon its several Circumstances, did on the Third Day of December, A. D. 1772, make their Report in Fa∣vour of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees, to his most Gracious Majesty, whose Royal Confirmation we daily expect, and on the Credit and good Faith of this Report, many Hundreds of industrious (and many of them wealthy) Families, have purchased and moved upon the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, nothing doubting of that Title.</P>
<P>"We therefore humbly report to the said General Committee of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, as our Opinion, 1. That as we ever have, so for the future we will remain loyal and dutiful Subjects,
<PB N="21" REF="013102_0020_0F8EBBF10C082B70"/>to our most rightful Sovereign <HI>GEORGE</HI> the Third, and demean Ourselves agreeable to the good and wholesome Laws of the Realm, and sight for the Honour and Dignity of his Majesty's Crown and Government, at all Times when there may be a Call for it, viewing him as our political Father, and relying on him to be protected in our Property.</P>
<P N="2">"2, THAT as we purchased our Lands of One of his Majesty's Governors, and on the good Faith of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we are determin∣ed to maintain those Grants, against all Oppo∣sition, until his Majesty's Royal Pleasure shall be known on the Premises.</P>
<P>"AND whereas we have never made any fur∣ther Resistance to Government, than the Law of Self-Preservation, which the Law of GOD and Na∣ture enjoyns on every intelligent, wise and under∣standing Being; we therefore are fully of the Opinion to resolve,</P>
<P N="3">3, THAT such of the Magistrates, and govern∣mental Authority of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> as have pursued, and have been accessary in the Scheme of indicting our Friends and Neighbours as Rioters; and have by Intrigue and Stratagem, of various Sorts, endeavoured to take them, and punish them as Criminals; thereby to dishearten and terrify the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers to that De∣gree, that they may tamely be disinherited; have acted contrary to the Spirit and Design of the good
<PB N="22" REF="013102_0021_0F8EBBF1E0FE9438"/>and righteous Laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which, un∣der a just Administration, never fail to secure the Liberty and Property of the Subject; are thereby guilty of great Inhumanity to its respective Sub∣jects. We therefore resolve, That as a Country, we will stand by, and defend our Friends and Neighbours, so indicted, at the Expence of our Lives and Fortunes. And we would recommend it to the General Assembly of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to wait the Determination of his Majesty, relative to the Title of those Lands, and desist from taking us as Rioters, to prevent the unhap∣py Consequences that may result from such an At∣tempt.</P>
<P>"AND Fourthly, and lastly, Resolved, That for the future, every necessary Preparation be made, and that our Inhabitants hold themselves in Rea∣diness, at a Minute's Warning, to aid and defend such Friends of our's, who, for their Merit to the great and general Cause, are falsely denominated Rioters; but that we will not act any Thing, more or less, but on the Defensive, and always encour∣age due Execution of Law, in civil Cases, and also in criminal Prosecutions, that are so indeed; and that we will assist, to the utmost of our Power, the Officers appointed for that Purpose.</P>
<P>"THE foregoing Arguments, Narrations and Resolves, being laid before the General Commit∣tee of the <HI>New-Hamshire</HI> Grants, and was read sundry Times, and carefully examined. And after mature Deliberation, Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> Chairman, put
<PB N="23" REF="013102_0022_0F8EBBF1F76D2DB0"/>the Votes to Tryal, whether the foregoing was ap∣proved of, as an Answer to the Resolves of the General Assembly of the Province of <HI>New-York?</HI> And it was passed in the Affirmative. And it was furthermore the Advice of this Committee, that the foregoing be forthwith exhibited in the public Papers, to the Intent that all Officers, Ma∣gistrates and Persons whatsoever may know that if they presume to take the Rioters aforesaid, they do it on their Peril.</P>

<P>"An ACT for preventing tumultuous and riot∣ous Assemblies in the Places therein mentioned, and for the more speedy and effectual punishing the Rioters.</P>
<P>"<HI>WHEREAS a Spirit of Riot and Licentiousness has of late prevailed in some Parts of the Counties of</HI> Charlotte <HI>and</HI> Albany, <HI>and many Acts of Outrage and Cruelty have been perpetrated by a Number of turbu∣lent Men, who, assembling from Time to Time in Arms, have seized, insulted and menaced several Magistrates, and other Civil Officers, so that they dare not execute their Functions—rescued Prisoners for Debt—assumed to themselves military Commands, and judicial Powers—burned and demolished the Houses and Property, and
<PB N="24" REF="013102_0023_0F8EBBF2BA3B8FF0"/>beat and abused the Persons of many of His Majesty's Subjects—expelled others from their Possessions—and finally, have put a Period to the Administration of Jus∣tice within, and spread Terror and Destruction through∣out that Part of the Country which is exposed to their Oppression: Therefore, for the preventing and suppres∣sing such Riots and Tumults, and for the more speedy and effectual punishing the Offenders therein,</HI></P>

<P N="6">"6.

<P>"<HI>Be it therefore enacted,</HI> by the Authority a∣foresaid, That it shall and may be lawful to and for his Excellency the Governor, or the Governor and Commander in Chief, for the Time being, by and with the Advice of the Council, as often as either of the above named Persons, or any other Person, shall be indicted in either of the Counties aforesaid, for any Offence perpetrated after the

<HEAD>From the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Gazette, No. 915. REMARKS, &amp;c. on some late Laws, passed in <HI>New-York.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS Excellency Governor <HI>Tryon</HI> in Conformity to the Addresses of the General Assembly of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> having on the 9th Day of March 1774, with the Advice of his Council, is∣sued his Proclamation, offering therein large Sums of Money, for the Purpose of apprehending and
<PB N="37" REF="013102_0036_0F8EBC00C4FAC7C0"/>imprisoning the following Persons, viz. <HI>Ethan Alten, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, Robert Coch∣ran, Peleg Sunderland, Silvanus Brown, James Break∣enridge,</HI> and <HI>John Smith.</HI></P>
<P>AND whereas, his Excellency the Governor, by the same Proclamation, hath strictly enjoined and commanded all Magistrates, Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and other civil Officers of the Counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> to be active and vigilant in apprehending, and imprisoning the Persons above named; and we the aforesaid Persons, who have hereunto subscribed, being conscious that our Cause is good and equitable, in the Sight of GOD, and all unprejudiced and honest Men, are determined at all Events, to maintain, and defend the same, 'till his Majesty's Pleasure shall be known, concerning the Validity of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> Grants.—And we now proclaim to the Public, not only for Ourselves, but for the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees, and Occupants in general; that the Spring and moving Cause of our Oppo∣sition to the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> was Self-Preservation, viz. Firstly, the Preservation and maintaining of our Property: And Secondly, since that Government is so incensed against us, there∣fore it stands us in Hand to defend our Lives; for it appears, by a late Set of Laws passed by the Legislature thereof, that the Lives, and Pro∣perty of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers are manifestly struck at; but, that the Public may rightly un∣derstand the Essence of the Controversy, we now proclaim to those Law-Givers, and to the World,
<PB N="38" REF="013102_0037_0F8EBC00F9681B20"/>that if the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees will remove their Patents that have been subsequently lapped and laid on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Charters, and quiet us in our Possessions, agreeable to his Majesty's di∣rections, and suspend those criminal Prosecuti∣ons against us, for being Rioters (as we are un∣justly denominated) then will our Settlers be or∣derly and submissive Subjects to Government; but be it known to that despotic Fraternity of Law-Makers, and Law-Breakers, that we will not be fooled or frighted out of our Property; they have broke over his Majesty's express Pro∣hibitions, in patenting those Lands, and when they act in Conformity to the regal Authority of Great-Britain, it will be soon enough for us to o∣bey them. It is well known by all wise and sen∣sible Persons in the neighbouring Governments, (that have animadverted on the Controversy) that their pretended Zeal for good Order and Govern∣ment, is fallacious, and that they aim at the Lands and Labours of the Grantees and Settlers afore∣said: and that they subvert the good and wholesome Laws of the Realm, to corroborate with, and bring about their vile and mercenary Purposes.</P>
<P>AND, inasmuch as the Malignity of their Dis∣position towards us, hath flamed to an immea∣surable and murtherous Degree, they have in their new-fangled Laws, calculated for the meri∣dian of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, passed the 9th of March, 1774; so calculated them, as to cor∣respond with the depravedness of their Minds and Morals; in them Laws, they have exhibited their
<PB N="39" REF="013102_0038_0F8EBC055FB8E538"/>genuine Pictures. The Emblems of their insa∣tiable, avaricious, overbearing, inhuman, barba∣rous, and blood-guiltiness of Disposition and In∣tention is therein portraited in that transparent Image of themselves, which cannot fail to be a Blot, and an infamous Reproach to them, to Posterity.—We cannot suppose that every of his Majesty's Council, or that all the Members of the General Assembly were active in passing so bloody and unconstitutional a Set of Laws; un∣doubtedly, some of them disapproved thereof; and it is altogether possible, that many that were active in making the Law, were imposed upon by false Representations, and acted under mistaken Views of doing Honour to Government; but be this as it will, it appears that there was a Majority. And it has been too much the Case with that Go∣vernment, for a Number of designing Schemers, and Land-Jockeys, to rule the same. Let us take a View of their former narrow and circumscrib∣ed Boundaries, and how, by Legerdemain, Bri∣bery and Deceptions of one Sort or other, they have extended their Domain far and wide; they have wrangled with, and encroached on all their neighbouring Governments, and have used all Manner of Deceit and Fraud to accomplish their Designs: Their Tenants groan under their Usu∣ry and Oppression; and they have gained, as well as merited the Disapprobation and Abhorrence of their Neighbours, and the innocent Blood they have already shed, calls for Heaven's Vengeance on their guilty Heads; and if they should come forth in arms against us, thousands of their injur∣ed
<PB N="40" REF="013102_0039_0F8EBC0634C62D78"/>and dissatisfied Neighbours in the several Go∣vernments, will join with us, to cut off, and ex∣tirpate such an execrable Race from the Face of the Earth!</P>
<P>THIS Piece is not supposed to contain a full An∣swer to the new constructed Set of Laws aforesaid; for such a large TWO-YEAR OLD, hath never be∣fore been seen in America, it being of an enor∣mous and monstrous Birth; nor is it supposed to give the Legislators their full Characters: But so much, and a little more may suffice for the present. To quote the Laws, and make Remarks thereon, would be Matter sufficient for a Volume: Howe∣ver, we will yet make some few short Observations.</P>
<P N="1">1st, NEGATIVELY, it is not a Law for the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York</HI> in general, but,</P>
<P N="2">2d, POSITIVELY, it is a Law but for Part of the Counties of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and <HI>Albany;</HI> viz. Such Parts thereof, as are covered with the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> CHARTERS, and it is well known those Grants com∣pose but a minor Part of the Inhabitants of the said Province; and we have no Representative in that As∣sembly: The first Knowledge we had of said Laws, was the Completion of them; which informed us, that if we assembled, Three or more of us together, to oppose (that which they call legal) Authority, we shall be adjudged Felons, and suffer the Pains of Death; and that same Fraternity of Plotters knew, as well as we, and the generality of the People in the adjacent Colonies, that they have for a Num∣ber
<PB N="41" REF="013102_0040_0F8EBC0852A233E0"/>of Years last past, endeavoured to exercise such a Course of what they call Law, that had they not been opposed by the People of these Grants (called the MOB) in the executing the same, they would before this Time, have been in Possession of that Territory, for which the Laws aforesaid are calculated. Therefore the Case stands thus: If we oppose civil Officers, in taking Possession of our Farms, we are, by these Laws, denominated Fe∣lons; or if we defend our Neighbours, who have been indicted Rioters, only for defending our Pro∣perty; we are likewise adjudged Felons. In fine, every Opposition to their monarchial Government is deemed Felony, and at the End of every such Sen∣tence there is the Word DEATH! And the same Laws further impower the respective Judges, pro∣vided any Persons, to the Number of Three, or more, that shall oppose any Magistrate, or other civil Officer, and be not taken, that after a legal Warning of Seventy Days, if they do not come and yield themselves up to certain Officers ap∣pointed for the Purpose of securing them; then it shall be lawful for the Judges aforesaid, to award Execution of DEATH, the same as tho' he or they had been convicted or attainted before a proper Court of Judicature, &amp;c. The candid Reader will doubtless observe, that the diabolical Design of this Law, is to obtain Possession of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, or to make the People that de∣fend them Out-Laws, and so kill them whenever they can catch them.</P>
<P>THOSE bloody Law-Givers know we are necessi∣tated
<PB N="42" REF="013102_0041_0F8EBC093A921460"/>to oppose their Execution of Law, where it points directly at our Property, or give up the same: But there is one Thing is Matter of Consolation to us, viz. that printed Sentences of Death will not kill us when we are at a Distance; and if the Exe∣cutioners approach us, they will be as likely to fall Victims to Death as we: And that Person, or Country of Persons, are Cowards indeed, if they cannot as manfully fight for their Liberty, Pro∣perty and Life, as Villains can to deprive them thereof.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New-York</HI> Schemers accuse us with many Things, Part of which are true, and Part not.—With Respect to rescuing Prisoners for Debt, it is <HI>false.</HI> As to assuming judicial Powers, we <HI>have not,</HI> except a well-regulated Combination of the People to defend their just Rights, may be called so. As to forming ourselves into Military Order, and assuming Military Commands, the <HI>New-York</HI> Possies, and Military Preparations, Oppressions, &amp;c. <HI>obliged us to it.</HI> Probably Mess. <HI>Duane, Kemp,</HI> and <HI>Banyer,</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> will not discommend us for so expedient a Preparation; more especially since the Decrees of the 9th of March, are yet to be put in Execution: And we flatter ourselves, upon Occasion, we can muster as good a Regiment of Mark's-men and Scalpers, as <HI>America</HI> can afford; and we now give the Gentlemen above-named, to∣gether with Mr. <HI>Brush,</HI> and Col. <HI>Ten Broeck,</HI> and, in fine, all the Land-Jobbers of <HI>New-York,</HI> an In∣vitation to come and view the Dexterity of our Regiment; and we cannot think of a better Time
<PB N="43" REF="013102_0042_0F8EBC0A88265590"/>for that Purpose, than when the Executioners come to kill some or all of us, by Virtue of the Autho∣rity their Judges have lately received to award and Sentence us to Death in our Absence. There is still one more notable Complaint against us, viz. That we have insulted and menaced several Ma∣gistrates, and other civil Officers, so that they dare not execute their respective Functions: This is <HI>true,</HI> so far as it relates to the Magistrates. But the Public should be informed, what the Functi∣ons of those Magistrates are: They are commissi∣oned for the sole Purpose of doing us all the Harm and Mischief they possibly can, through their Ad∣ministration and Influence; and that they might be subservient to the wicked Designs of the <HI>New-York</HI> Schemers. These are their Functions; and the Public need no further Proof than the Consider∣ation that they are the Tools of those extravagant Law-Makers; and it must be owned, they acted with great Judgment, in chusing the most infernal Instruments for their Purpose.</P>
<P>DRACO, the <HI>Athenian</HI> Lawgiver, caused a Num∣ber of Laws (in many Respects analogous to those we have been speaking of) to be <HI>written</HI> in Blood. But our modern <HI>Draco</HI>'s determine to have their's <HI>verified</HI> in Blood. They well know we shall more than <HI>Three,</HI> nay, more than <HI>Three Times Three Hun∣dred,</HI> assemble together, if Need be, to maintain our common Cause, till his Majesty determines who shall be and remain the Owners of the Land in Contest. <HI>"Wilt not thou possess that which Che∣moth, thy God giveth thee to possess?"</HI> So will we
<PB N="44" REF="013102_0043_0F8EBC0AEB1C29D0"/>possess that which the Lord our God (and King) giveth us to possess.</P>
<P>AND lastly, we address ourselves to the People of the Counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> which in∣habit to the Westward of, and are situated conti∣guous to the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS, PROVIDENCE having allotted and fixed the Bounds of our Habitations in the same Vicinity, which, together with the Intercourse of Trade and Commerce, hath formed an almost universal Ac∣quaintance and Tie of Friendship between us, and hath laid such a Foundation of Knowledge, that your People in general cannot but be sensible that the Title of our Land is in Reality the Bone of Contention, and that as a People, we behave our∣selves orderly; and are industrious, and honestly disposed; and pay just Deference to Order and good Government; and that we mean no more by that which is called the MOB, but to defend our just Rights and Properties. We appeal to the Gentlemen Merchants, to inform whether our Peo∣ple in general, do not exert themselves to pay their just Debts; and whether ever they have been hin∣dered by the Country's MOB, in the Collection of their Dues. But as the Magistrates, Sheriffs, Un∣der-Sheriffs, Coroners, and Constables of the res∣pective Counties that hold their Posts of Honor and Profit under our bitter Enemies, we have a Jealousy, that some of them may be induced (to
<PB N="45" REF="013102_0044_0F8EBC0B6EA711C8"/>recommend themselves to those on whom they are dependant, and for the Wages of unrighteousness, offered by Proclamation) to presume to apprehend some of us, or our Friends: We therefore adver∣tise such Officers, and all Persons whatsoever, that we are resolved to inflict <HI>immediate Death</HI> on whom∣soever may attempt the same: And provided any of us or our Party shall be taken, and we have not Notice sufficient to relieve them, or whether we re∣lieve them or not, we are resolved to surround such Person or Persons, whether at his or their own House or Houses, or any where that we can find him or them, and <HI>shoot such Person or Persons dead.</HI> And further more, that we will <HI>kill</HI> and <HI>destroy</HI> any Person or Persons whomsoever, that shall <HI>presume</HI> to be accessary, aiding or assisting in taking any of us as aforesaid; for by these Presents we give any such disposed Person or Persons to understand, that, altho' they have a Licence by the Law afore∣said, to <HI>kill</HI> us; and an "Indemnification" for such Murther from the same Authority; yet they have no Indemnification for so doing, from the GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS; for our Lives, Liberties and Properties are as verily precious to us, as to any of the King's Subjects; and we are as loyal to his Majesty or his Government, as any Subjects in the Province: But if the Governmental Authority of <HI>New-York</HI> will Judge in their own Case, and act in Opposition to that of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and insist up∣on <HI>killing</HI> us to take possession of our "Vineyards" come on, we are ready for a Game of Scalping with them; for our marshal Spirits glow with Bitter
<PB N="46" REF="013102_0045_0F8EBC0C2D0BCCA0"/>Indignation, and consumate Fury to Blast their Infernal Projections.</P>
<P>"IT may be the Reader, not having seen the Law referred to in this Piece, and not being thoroughly acquainted with the long and spirited Conflict that hath subsisted between the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> nor of the Progressive, Arbitrary and Monopolizing disposi∣tion of the Court Party of the latter of those Pro∣vinces; may be apt to imagine that the Spirit of this Writing is too severe, inasmuch as it Destines whoever presumes to take us as Felons or Rioters, to immediate Death; but let the Wise consider the State of the Cause.</P>
<P N="1">1. PROVIDED we on our Part be taken, we have by them Laws the Sentence of Death already pro∣nounced against us, on Proviso more than Three of us assemble together to maintain and defend our Property, till his Majesty determines the Contro∣versy. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. MAY it be considered, that the Legislative Authority of the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> had no constitutional Right or Power to make such Laws, and consequently that they are Null and Void, from the Nature and Energy of the English Con∣stitution; therefore as they merit no Place among the Laws of the Realm of Great-Britain, but are the arbitrary League and Combination of our bit∣ter and merciless Enemies, who, to obtain our Pro∣perty, have inhumanly, barbarously, and malici∣ously,
<PB N="47" REF="013102_0046_0F8EBC0D1C46A1D8"/>under the specious and hypocritical Pre∣tence of legal Authority, and Veneration for Order and Government, have laid a Snare for our Lives. Can the Public censure us for exerting Ourselves nervously to preserve our Lives in so critical a Situa∣tion? For by the Laws of the Province, into which we are unfortunately fallen, we cannot be protected in either Property or Life, except we give up the Former to secure the Latter; so we are resolved to maintain both, or to hazard or loose both.</P>
<P>FROM hence follows a necessary Inference, That inasmuch as our Property, nay our Lives, cannot be protected (but manifestly struck at) by the highest Authority in the Province to which we at present belong; therefore in the Interim, while his Majesty is determining the Controversy, and till he shall interpose his Royal Authory, and subject the Authority abovesaid to their Duty, or re-annex the District of disputed Lands to the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> or some Way in his great Wisdom and Fatherly Clemency, put the distressed Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> on an equal Footing with our Brother Subjects in his Realm; we are under Necessity of resisting, even unto Blood, every Per∣son who may attempt to take us as Felons or Riot∣ers as aforesaid; for in this Case it is not resisting Law, but only opposing Force by Force; therefore inasmuch as by the Oppressions aforesaid, the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers are reduced to the disagreeable State of Anarchy and Confusion; in which State we hope for Wisdom, Patience and Fortitude, till
<PB N="48" REF="013102_0047_0F8EBC0DAA0E3C40"/>the happy Hour his Majesty shall graciously be pleased to restore us to the Privileges of English∣men.</P>

ON HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE, <HI>To the Rev. Mr.</HI> Dewey, <HI>and the Inhabitants of</HI> Ben∣nington, <HI>and the adjacent Country, on the East Side of</HI> Hudson's River.</OPENER>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE>
<P>THE many violent and illegal Acts you have lately committed against the Peace and good Order of this Province, of which I have had fre∣quent Proofs and Informations, at the same Time that they are not only a Reproach to yourselves, but dangerous and injurous to your Families and Interests, cannot fail of being highly offensive to your Sovereign. You may depend a Perseverance in your Disobediance to, and Violations of the Laws
<PB N="50" REF="013102_0049_0F8EBC0F2BC12430"/>of your Country must soon draw forth against you the Exertions of the Powers of Government. How∣ever, being sincerely disirous on my Part, to avoid compulsive Measures, while lenient Methods may prove successful; I esteem it my Duty to invite you to lay before this Government the Causes of your illegal Proceedings; and it is with the Con∣currence and Advice of his Majesty's Council that I send you this Invitation, who, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are disposed to examine into the Grounds of your Behaviour and Discontent with Deliberation and Candor, and as far as in us lies, to give such Relief as the Nature of your Situation and Circumstances will justify. That there may be no Obstruction to your laying be∣fore me in Council, as soon as possible, a fair Repre∣sentation of your Conduct, I do hereby engage full Security and Protection to any Persons whom you shall choose to send on this Business to <HI>New-York,</HI> from the Time they leave their Homes to the Time of their Return, except <HI>Robert Cockran,</HI> as also <HI>Allen, Baker,</HI> and <HI>Sevil,</HI> mentioned in my Proclamation of the 9th of December last, and <HI>Seth Warner,</HI> whose audacious Behaviour to a Civil Magistrate, has subjected him to the Penalties of the Laws of his Country. 'I am told Mr. <HI>William Dewey,</HI> a Minister of the Gospel, <HI>James Breakenridge,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fay,</HI> are Persons in whose Judgment you have much Confidence; I should therefore think they would be your proper Messengers on a Business in which you are so deeply concerned, especially Mr. <HI>Dewey,</HI> who has been favourably represented here since my Appointment to this Government. His Majesty's Secretary of State has signified to me that the King
<PB N="51" REF="013102_0050_0F8EBC10AB49C1B0"/>has finally fixed <HI>Connecticut</HI> River to be the estab∣lished Jurisdiction between the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI></P>
<P>"This Circumstance I mention that you may not be misled or deceived by a Perswasion, that that Part of the Country you inhabit, will ever be annexed to the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> I have this farther Motivefor mentioning the King's final Decision, that by your receiving this Autho∣rity of your being in the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> I am hopeful your future Conduct will justify me in assuring his Majesty of your dutiful Obedience to his royal Determination. I flatter myself you will chearfully improve this final Offer of reconciling yourselves to this Government. I am your Friend,</P>

<P>WE his Majesty's leige and loyal Subjects of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> having receiv∣ed your particular Favour of the 19th Day of <HI>May</HI> last, requesting the Inhabitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent Country on the East Side of <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, to lay before your Excellency and Council, the Cause of our Discontent and Behaviour, do now express our Satisfaction in having this very Op∣portunity to acquaint your Excellency,</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="013102_0051_0F8EBC116B90FC10"/>
"FIRST, That we hold the Fee and Property of the Lands we are settled on, and in Possession of, by Virtue of Grants from their Majesties <HI>George</HI> the Second and Third, &amp;c. which Lands at the Time of thus being granted, was reputed to be within the Jurisdiction of the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> until the Year 1764, when some of your Excellency's now Subjects had by some Measures obtained his Majesty's Pleasure for Alteration of Jurisdiction-line between the Provinces of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New-York;</HI> since this, sundry Grants have been made by those in the Administration of Government in the said Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the very Land before granted by their Majesties to us, as though the Fee of the Land and Property was altered with Jurisdiction, which we suppose was not. The Measures taken to dispossess us of those Lands by repeated Writs of Ejectments, Suits at Law, Rejectment of Proof from authentic Re∣cords, refusing a suitable Time and Opportunity for Collection of Evidence to support and vindi∣cate our Cause, contrary, (as we suppose) to the usual Customs of the Law of the Province, seem to be the Grounds of our Discontent, and that illegal and unconstitutional Method of Proceeding in Indicting sundry persons who are bound by the Law of Self and Family Preservation to maintain their Liberty and Properties; the Usage of those intreaguers that would Monopolize our Interests to themselves by such irregular Steps.—</P>
<P>"Their Methods of breaking by Violence, Houses for Possession, and to obtain those whom they are pleased to denominate riotous, tumultu∣ous

To His EXCELLENCY, <HI>WILLIAM TRYON,</HI> ESQUIRE, &amp;c.
<SALUTE>May it please your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, His Majesty's loyal Subjects, whose Names are to this Piece affixed, Inhabitants on that Tract of Land, your Excellency discribes by the Name of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent Country, &amp;c. and who was by your Excellency's Letter of the 19th of May last, prohibited the Privilege of going to <HI>New-York,</HI> and personally vindicate ei∣ther ourselves or Country, before your Excellency, and being put to the Extremity of informing your Excellency by Writing, the Reason of our Discon∣tent, and also of our Behaviour, which we shall more largely set forth, than is in the foregoing general An∣swer to your Excellency's Letter; and also exhibit more Arguments deduced from Reason and the Na∣ture of Things, we hope your Excellency will be gra∣ciously pleased to view this our Defence with that Tenderness and Candor a Gentleman in so eleva∣ted a Station should do, and therefore beg Leave to observe, that as on the one Hand, no Considera∣tion whatever, shall induce us to remit in the least, of our Loyalty and Gratitude to our most gracious Sovereign, nor of a reasonable Submission to your
<PB N="55" REF="013102_0054_0F8EBC13C9789B38"/>Excellency; so on the other Hand, no tyrannical Exertions of the Powers of Government, can deter us from asserting and vindicating our undoubted Rights and Privileges as Englishmen. We expect∣ed an Answer from your Excellency, to our hum∣ble Petition to you delivered soon after your Ex∣cellency's Accession to the Administration of the Government, but for Reasons to us unknown, your Excellency passed it by in Silence. How∣ever, we chearfully embrace this Opportunity of laying before your Excellency in Council the true State of our Controversy, which we can no other∣ways do, but by absorbing our personal Distincti∣on into the Community, and general Cause, to which we have obtained the Character of faithful. We assure your Excellency that we assent to your Authority of Jurisdiction inasmuch as his Majesty's Proclamation assures us it is his Will and Pleasure we be under the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> and not only now Assent to it, but have ever done the same, except in Instances where such perverse Use has been made thereof, as would dispossess us of our Property and Country, we are truly desirous, and petitioning his Majesty to re-annex us to the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> But this is not the Ground of our Discontent, or at least is far from being the principle Ground of it, though it was done <HI>ex parte,</HI> and we apprehend there were more or less wrong Representations made to his Majesty, to obtain the Jurisdiction: However, it is the unreasonable and unconstitutional Exercise of it that is the present Bone of Contention—our Properties are all at Stake; this we contend for, as the following known
<PB N="56" REF="013102_0055_0F8EBC1588BD80C8"/>Facts will demonstrate. A certain number of designing Men in <HI>New-York</HI> (and elsewhere) pro∣cured Patents under the Great Seal of that Pro∣vince, and those Grantees being non-residents, brought sundry Writs of Ejectment against the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers on the same Land, covered by both Patents as aforesaid, and obtained Judgment against them, and proceeded further and took out Writs of Possession, and actually dispossessed several of them by Order of Law, of their Houses and Farms, leaving them to suffer the Inclemency of the Weather, bereaved of all the Necessaries of Life, their new Masters having monopolized their earthly ALL, to themselves. These indigent Fami∣lies having in the first Place expended their several Fortunes, in bringing their Farms out of a wilder∣ness State, into that of fruitful Feilds, Gardens and Orchards; the whole Country consisting of more than Fifteen Hundred Families, was greatly alarm'd at the Event which had already began to take Place, was in the greatest Consternation, each In∣dividual, from these Instances, reading their own intolerable and universal Destruction.—Still the Writs of Ejectment came thicker and faster, and universal Slavery, Poverty and Horror, emblema∣tically appeared in every Countenance.</P>
<P>"THUS, things having come to this Pass, the Oppression was too great for human Nature, un∣der English Constitution, to grope under, for those unparrallelled Instances struck an infinitely more terrible Idea, than that of the Exertion of the Powers of Government.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="013102_0056_0F8EBC1668415FC8"/>
"LAWS and Society-compacts, were made to protect and secure the Subjects in their peaceable Possessions and Properties, and not to subvert them. No Person or Community of Persons can be supposed to be under any particular Compact or Law, except it pre-supposeth, that that Law will protect such Person or Community of Persons in his or their Properties, for otherways the Sub∣ject would by Law be bound to be accessary to his own Ruin and Destruction, which is inconsistant with the Law of Self-preservation; but this Law being natural as well as eternal, can never be abrogated by the Law of Men.</P>
<P>"WE would acquaint your Excellency, that since our Misfortune of being annexed to the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York,</HI> Law has been rather used as a Tool (than a Rule of Equity) to cheat us out of the Country, we have made vastly valuable by Labour and Expence of our Fortunes.—We con∣clude these Things are yet unknown, or in a great Measure so to your Excellency, as your Excellen∣cy's Commencement to the Administration, hath not been long, and a Set of artful, wicked Men, concealing the Truth from your Excellency, pur∣posing to make a Booty of us, characterizing us, (speaking of our Inhabitants in general) as so ma∣ny Rioters if not Rebels; and we being a poor People at a great Distance from your Excellency's Place of Residence, fatigued in settling a Wilder∣ness Country, have little or no Opportunity of ac∣quainting your Excellency of our Greivances, ex∣cept by one short Petition delivered to your Ex∣cellency
<PB N="58" REF="013102_0057_0F8EBC1743FF6C18"/>soon after your first taking Adminis∣ration—and as our Cause is represented before his Majesty and Council, we did not expect your Ex∣cellency to determine the Controversy, nor do we yet expect it. We are sensible those Men that seek our Ruin, thereby to enrich themselves, do by Stratagems of every Kind, represent us to your Ex∣cellency as Breakers of the Peace, and Enemies to the Government; and under this Pretence they hope to catch a Number of the boldest of our Inhabi∣tants, and punish them in the <HI>New-York</HI> Inquisiti∣on, with that Severity that the Residue may be frightened out of both Liberty and Property; for otherways they would soon be indicted Rioters, and thus under Colour of punishing Rioters, and a Zeal of Loyalty and Veneration for good Govern∣ment, rob the Inhabitants of their Country. If we do not oppose the Sheriff and his Possy, he takes immediate Possession of our Houses and Farms, if we do, we are immediately indicted Rioters; and when others oppose Officers in taking such their Friends so indicted, they are also indicted and so on, there being no End of Indictment against us so long as we Act the bold and manly Part, and stand by our Liberty.—</P>
<P>"This is a short Sketch of the disingenuous Cunning of Messieurs <HI>Duane,</HI> and <HI>Kemp,</HI> and their Associates; and it comes to this at last, that we must tamely be dispossessed, or oppose Officers in taking Possession, and as a next necessary Step, oppose taking of Rioters so called, or run away like so many Cowards, and quit our Country to a Num∣ber
<PB N="59" REF="013102_0058_0F8EBC176A94D548"/>of cringing, polite Gentlemen who have ideal∣ly possess'd themselves of it already.</P>
<P>"As to sundry Men who have eloped lately from our Grants, and sled to <HI>New-York</HI> for Pro∣tection, Self-preservation necessitated us to treat some of them roughly; and others, viz. <HI>Ebenezer Cowle,</HI> and <HI>Jonathan Wheat,</HI> of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> fled to <HI>New-York,</HI> on Account of their own Guilt, not be∣ing hurt or threatened. Would Time permit we could give a rational Account for most, or all of our late Conduct towards these Men. The general Reason is this, namely, they were a Set of Men that loved themselves, and not their Country, they busied themselves in planning and assisting to take Rioters so called. In fine, they were the Emis∣saries of that mercenary Core of Yorkers, and did more in Oppressing the People, than their preposter∣ous Benefactors.</P>
<P>"The Assault made upon Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> at Day break, of the Night of the 22d of March last, by a Number of Ruffians under the Command of the infamous <HI>John Munro,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was a notorious Riot, and gave Energy and Motion, to the subsequent Acts, your Excellency denominates illegal. This <HI>Munro</HI> and his bloody Party, by cuting, wounding and maiming, Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> his Wife and Children, in such an inhuman and Savage Manner, was no less than proclaiming himself in a most public Man∣ner to be a malicious and bloody Enemy, not only to Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> but also to all those Men on our Grants, who manfully adhere to maintaining Li∣berty
<PB N="60" REF="013102_0059_0F8EBC1CE023A940"/>and Property, and inasmuch as the murther∣ous Villian is alive, he has no Cause of Complaint—for after his Assault upon Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> he made another Assault upon Mr. <HI>Seth Warner,</HI> but not having so strong a Party of Ruffians with him as in his other Expedition, it was not attended with the like Consequences, for Mr. <HI>Warner,</HI> struck his Head with a dull Cutlass, and levelled him to the Ground, but the Blow proved not Mortal, and af∣ter this, for his Satisfaction for the Wound, threat∣ened the Lives of a Number of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers.—Your Excellency will undoubtedly con∣sider as our Opponents have had the Manufactory of the Civil Laws so much under their Power, that this merciless Man could not be brought to Justice, nor could others among us be safe any other Way, but by using him in his own Play, he set the Ex∣ample, and enraged the People to mimick him from that natural Principle of justice in every Man's own Breast.</P>
<P>"As to the Perfidious and treacherous <HI>Bliss Willoggby,</HI> he always pretended to be a Friend of the said <HI>Baker's,</HI> and <HI>Baker</HI> had ever been truly a Friend of his—this Hypocrite, two Days before <HI>Baker</HI> was taken, made a frivilous Excuse of Busi∣ness, went to said <HI>Baker's</HI> House, viewed the Strength of it, perceived <HI>Baker</HI> was somewhat care∣less and secure, and made Report to the said <HI>Munro.</HI> In fine, <HI>Willoggby</HI> was the Planner and Instigator of that savage Cruelty exercised to said <HI>Baker,</HI> which was perpetrated and brought into Action by the detestible said <HI>Munro.</HI> But to desist, as to the
<PB N="61" REF="013102_0060_0F8EBC1FA7F09430"/>History of our late transaction, whether they be all Right or not, we on our Part have a few Argu∣ments &amp; Considerations more to lay before your Ex∣cellency, as to the Cause of our Discontent, as well as to the Cause of our late Actions your Excellency denominates illegal.</P>
<P>"The Alteration of Jurisdiction in 1764 could not effect private Property: Surely his Majesty by this Alteration, did not purpose to take away the personal Property of a large Number of his loyal Subjects, and transfer it to other Subjects; the English Constitution will by no Means admit of this, for the transferring or alienation of Property is a sacred Prerogative of the true Owner.—Kings and Governors cannot intermeddle therewith. Further∣more Your Excellency &amp; Council must needs be ac∣quainted that we have a Petition lying before his Majesty and Council, for Redress of our Grievances. That is an impartial Board; pray why may it not be determined there? For the very indentical Mat∣ters in Dispute, are now and for several Years past, have been lying before that Court, except the Ac∣cusations of Riotousness, Disorderly, &amp;c. which is improved as a Handle to subvert Property, and that only.</P>
<P>"FURTHERMORE, in the Time of Sir Henry Moor's Administration, his Majesty was pleased to lay the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> under absoluto Prohibition not to grant or patent any of the Lands antecedently granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and Further∣more
<PB N="62" REF="013102_0061_0F8EBC1FF0367FB0"/>forbid the Government to disturb or molest the Settlers. This rightly understood, amounts to a Supercedies over the Authority of Common Law, and absolutely controuls the Cognizance thereof. As to the particular Matters in the Pro∣hibition set forth, or Matters lying before his Ma∣jesty by Petition, the Import of the Prohibition must needs be thus, Namely, that his Majesty, by it in∣forms the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> that he has taken the Controversy to him made known by Pe∣tition, under his Royal Consideration, and that, after due Information and Evidence of the State of the Case, determines to settle the Controversy; consequently forbids the Government taking Cog∣nizance thereof; and Common Sense teaches us that under such Prohibition, if a Judgment at Common Law be supposed to be valid, it would invalidate the Authority of the Crown, and subvert and overthrow the Authority of the Kingdom, as it would render the Prohibitions of the Crown per∣fectly impertinent. Therefore Common Law, in the Case before us, is not cloathed with Cogni∣zance of this Case, much less with Authority to dispossess us; consequently every Party of Men that have with Officers or otherwise, come into these Parts to dispossess us, came in open Defiance and direct Opposition to his Majesty's Orders and Authority: And tho' they stile us Rioters, for opposing them, and seek to catch and punish us as such, yet in Reality, themselves are the Rioters, the tumultuous, disorderly, stimulating Faction, or, in fine, the Land-robbers; and every violent Act they have done to compass their Designs, tho' ever
<PB N="63" REF="013102_0062_0F8EBC2071A98810"/>so much under Pretence of Law, is in Reality a Violation of Law, and an Insult on the Constituti∣on, and Authority of the Crown, as well as to ma∣ny of us in Person, who have been great Sufferance by such inhuman Exertions of pretended legality of Law.—Right, and Wrong, are eternally the same to all Periods of Time, Places and Nations, and colouring a Crime with a specious Pretence of Law, only adds to the Criminality of it; for it subverts the very Design of Law, prostituting it to the vilest Purposes. Can any Man, in the Exercise of Reason make himself believe that a Number of Attornies and other Gentlemen, with all their Tackle of Orna∣ments, and Compliments, and French Finesse, to∣gether with their boasted Legality of Law, that these Gentlemen have just Right to the Lands Labours and Fortunes of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Set∣tlers? Certainly they cannot. Yet this is the Object in View by that mercenary Fraternity.</P>
<P>"WE do not suppose, may it please your Ex∣cellency, we are making Opposition to a Govern∣ment, as such; it is nothing more than a Party, chiefly carried on by a Number of Gentlemen Attornies (if it be not an Abuse to Gentlemen of Merit to call them so) who manifest a surprizing and interprizing Thirst of Avarice after our Coun∣try, but for a Collection of such Intreaguers, to plan Matters of Influence of a Party, so as eventu∣ally to become Judges in their own Case, &amp; thereby cheat us out of our Country, appears to us so audaciously unreasonable and tyrannical that we view it with the utmost Detestation and Indignati∣on,
<PB N="64" REF="013102_0063_0F8EBC2146585808"/>and our Breasts glow with a martial Fury to defend our Persons and Fortunes from the Ravages of those that would Destroy us; but not against your Excellency's Person or Government.</P>
<P>"WE are fully perswaded your Excellency's Ears have been much abused by subtle and de∣signing Men, for we are informed from credible Authority, your Excellency has lately made Ap∣plication to your Assembly to raise an armed Force to subdue us, but that the Motion was negatived: We apprehend your Excellency views us as op∣posing your Excellency's Jurisdiction, and that the violent Acts, by us done, was in Rebellion to his Majesty's Authority, or your Excellency had ne∣ver proposed the subduing of us; We are moral∣ly Certain we can convince your Excellency, that it is not so; but that on the other Hand Messieurs <HI>Duane, Kemp,</HI> and their Associates are the Ag∣gressors.</P>
<P>"WE have chosen two Men from among us, viz. Capt. <HI>Stephen Fay,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jonas Fay,</HI> to treat with your Excellency in Person, who we hope will An∣swer such Queries, and give your Excellency the Satisfaction you hope for.</P>
<P>"We view your Excellency as our Governor and political Father, and hope and expect, from the Sincerity and Candor of your Excellency's Letter, you will be friendly and favourably dis∣posed towards us, when your Excellency by these Lines perceive the Grounds of our Discontent:
<PB N="65" REF="013102_0064_0F8EBC21F2B01AD0"/>For we are Conscious that our Cause is good, and that it was Oppression which has been the Ground of our Discontent, and that Self-preservation hath hitherto urged us to the Measures lately taken. And we now earnestly intreat your Excellency's Aid and Assistance to quiet us in our Possessions and Properties, till his Majesty in his royal Wisdom Settle the Controversy: If your Excellency should do this, there would be an End of Riots, so called, and our Tongues unable to express our Gratitude to your Excellency for such Protection.</P>

<HEAD><HI>An Encomium on his Excellency Governor Tryon, and his Majesty's Honourable Council of the Province of</HI> New-York.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Copied from the</HI> CONNECTICUT COURANT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the Inhabitants of the Lands West of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, who purchased their Lands of his Majesty's Government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> who on the Faith of Government, and full Reliance on the Veracity of Charters under the Great Seal of that Province, have settled, cul∣tivated, and made great Improvements thereon;
<PB N="66" REF="013102_0065_0F8EBC22ACB8F598"/>which Tract of Land, in the Year Seventeen Hun∣dred and Sixty-Four, his Majesty was pleased to annex, the Province of <HI>New-York.</HI> And whereas, subsequent thereto, a Number of mercenary &amp; litigi∣ous Gentlemen of the Province (and principally of the City) of <HI>New-York,</HI> procured Patents under the Great Seal of that Province, &amp; covered sundry Town∣ships the same identical Land, antecedently grant∣ed under the Great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> And whereas many vexatious Law∣suits, and clandestine and oppressive crown Prose∣cutions, have been craftily, subtilly, and with a De∣sign to over-awe, abuse, terrify, and impoverish the said Inhabitants, hath been militated, devised and prosecuted against them, by the Influence of the Gentlemen aforesaid, purposing by such base and oppressive Measures of Policy, to defraud and wrong the said Inhabitants, out of the Possession and Property of their Country. And in order to clude &amp; defeat such their disingenuous and vicious Policy, the said Inhabitants mutually agreed to oppose <HI>New-York</HI> Officers, in their Attempts to take Rioters, so characterized, and take every other requisite, lawful and effectual Method to defend their Property.</P>
<P>"And Matters having come to this, that Hostility, Revenge and Hatred, had began to put on their bloody, murtherous, and vengful Em∣blems—In which propitious Hour, his Excellen∣cy WILLIAM TRYON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York,</HI> sent the said Inhabitants a kind, lenient and generous Letter, which breathed forth
<PB N="67" REF="013102_0066_0F8EBC236D5940C0"/>rather the Affections of a Father, than a hard-hearted Judge; requesting the said Inhabitants to exhibit to him in Council, the Grounds of their Discontent and Uneasiness, and the Cause of their violent and illegal Proceedings; assuring them, that they should be heard with Candor in the Premises, and have such Relief as the Nature and Circumstances of their Case should justify.</P>
<P>"UPON which the Town of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent Towns, by their Committees, met at <HI>Bennington,</HI> and sent a written Answer to his Excel∣lency's Letter, informing him of the State of the Controversy, and withal of the Ground of their Uneasiness and Discontent, and the Cause of their Proceedings; and also made Choice of Captain <HI>Stephen Fay,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Jonas Fay,</HI> of <HI>Bennington,</HI> to go to <HI>New-York,</HI> and deliver the written Answer to his Excellency, and further inform him as to the State of Facts, and negotiate the Matter of our Petition; (though not with Power to compleat a Settlement on our Part.) His Excellency receiv∣ed the Agents with Expressions of Kindness—laid the State of Grievances before His Majesty's ho∣nourable Council, who after mature Consideration, determined in the following Words: "The Com∣mittee are desirous your Excellency should afford the Inhabitants of those Townships, all the Relief in your Power, by suspending, till his Majesty's Pleasure shall be known, all Prosecutions in be∣half of the Crown, on Account of the Crimes with which they stand charged, by Depositions before us, and to recommend it to the Owners of the con∣tested
<PB N="68" REF="013102_0067_0F8EBC24369586A8"/>Lands under Grants from this Province, to put a Stop, during the same Period, to all civil Suits concerning the Lands in Question."</P>
<P>AFTER our Agents received Copies of the Mi∣nutes of Council, and also a Letter from his Ex∣cellency, purporting his Approbation and Compli∣ance therewith, they retired to <HI>Bennington</HI> with great Joy—warned a Meeting of that Town and the adjacent Country, which was held on the 15th of July Ultimo; and before a large Auditory of Peo∣ple, the Copy of the Minutes of Council was read, and also his Excellency's Letter of Compliance to the same, which defused universal Joy through the Country of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, and the People were at Strife in doing the most exalted Honour to Governor <HI>Tryon.</HI> And having at <HI>Ben∣nington</HI> a Cannon, it was discharged sundry Times in Honour to his Excellency and his Majesty's honourable Council, and after the Report of the Cannon, each several Time, the whole Audience gave a Huzza! in Acclamation, Good-will, Grati∣tude and vocal Honour to Governor TRYON, and Capt. <HI>Warner's</HI> Company of GREEN MOUNTAIN-BOYS under Arms, fired three Vollies of small Arms, in Concert and Aid of the Glory.</P>
<P>"HIS Majesty's Health, also a Health to his Excellency, and his Majesty's honourable Coun∣cil was drank, with full flowing Bowls, and Confusion to all the <HI>New-York</HI> Land-jobbers, hoping Peace, Liberty and Plenty may a∣bound.</P>

<P>"AT the same Time I express to you my Sa∣tisfaction by the Opportunity of Mr. <HI>Fay,</HI> on the grateful Manner in which you received and accepted the lenient Measures prescribed by this Government, for your peaceable Conduct un∣til his Majesty's Pleasure should be known, res∣pecting the disputed Claim to Lands within this Government. I cannot conceal from you my high Displeasure at the Breach of Faith and Honor, made by a Body of your People, in dispossessing several Settlers on <HI>Otter Creek,</HI> and its Neighbour∣hood, of their Possessions, during the very Time the Commissioners you appointed to attend on me at <HI>New-York,</HI> were waiting the Determination of Government on your Petition, that you might re∣main unmolested in your Possessions, until the King's Pleasure be obtained. Such disingenuous and dishonourable Proceedings, I view with great Concern, considering them as daring Insults to Government, a Violation of public Faith, and the Conditions granted to you on Petition. To prevent therefore the fatal Consequence that must follow so manifest a Breach of public Confidence, I am to require your Assistance, in putting forth∣with those Families who have been thus dispossess∣ed, into Re-possession of their Lands and Tene∣ments,

<SALUTE>"<HI>May it please your Excellency,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE his Majesty's leige and loyal Subjects, In∣habitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent Country, have received your Excellency's Letter, of the 11th of August Instant, by which we are in∣form'd of your Excellency's high Displeasure to∣wards us, by Reason of a Body of our People's dispossessing several Settlers on <HI>Otter-Creek,</HI> and its Neighbourhood, of their Possessions, during the very Time our Messengers attended on your Excellency at <HI>New-York,</HI> and were waiting the Determination of Government, on our Petition, that we might remain unmolested in our Possessions, till the King's Pleasure could be obtained. Your Excellency further informs us, that you Look on our late Proceedings with great Concern, viewing them as daring Insults to Government, a Violation
<PB N="71" REF="013102_0070_0F8EBC26756AB2A8"/>of public Faith, and the Conditions granted to our Petition. We would with proper Submission, give your Excellency and Council, a short Narra∣tive of Facts, with a few Reflections and Reasons thereon. And,</P>
<P>"FIRST, we would observe, That our Messen∣gers your Excellency stiles Commissioners, was not authorized to establish, and compleat Articles of public Faith for their Constituents. The Busi∣ness assign'd them, was to deliver the written Peti∣tion, and inform your Excellency and Council of the Facts of the Controversy subsisting, and fur∣ther negociate and forward the Matter of our Peti∣tion, and return to us the Determination of Go∣vernment, reserving to Ourselves the Power of assenting to, or dissenting therefrom, tho' true it is, when the Articles of amicable Settlement, or Order of Government was read at a public Meeting held at <HI>Bennington,</HI> on the 15th Day of July Ultimo, the said Order and Proposals were universally complied with by those present: From which Time we reasonably Compute the Date of public Faith, and sacred Bond of Friendship, but in the Interim, the Conditions of Faith was forming, and before a Ratification thereof, Mr. <HI>Kockburn,</HI> a noted Surveyor, unknown (as we suppose) to your Excellency, and Council, who, by the Con∣trivance, Aid and Employ of certain monopoli∣zing Adversaries of our's, took a Tour to the northerly Parts of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, to survey, and make Locations on our Land. Such Locating we view as a manifest Plan, and Intenti∣on
<PB N="72" REF="013102_0071_0F8EBC274E8BFBD8"/>of invading our Property—the same as in∣trenching round the City, portraits a Siege thereof.</P>
<P>OUR People having Notice of Mr. <HI>Kockburn</HI>'s Intrusion on our Borders, rallied a small Party, and pursued, and overtook him and his Party, and in their Pursuit, passed the Towns of <HI>Panton</HI> and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> near the Mouth of <HI>Otter Creek;</HI> dis∣possessed Col. <HI>Reed</HI> of a Saw-Mill in said <HI>Panton,</HI> which by Force, and without Colour, or even Pretence of Recourse to Law, he had taken from the original Owners and Builders, more than three Years before, and did at that same Time extend his Force, Terrors and Threats into the Town of <HI>New-Haven;</HI> who, by the vicious and haughty Aid of Mr. <HI>Benzell,</HI> the fam'd Engineer, with a Number of Assistants, under their Command, so terrified the Inhabitants (which were about twelve in Number) that they left their Possessions and Farms to the Conquerers, and escaped with the Skin of their Teeth, although they had expended large Sums of Money in cutting Roads to, and settling in that new Country, as well as fatigued and laboured hard in cultivating their Farms: Col. <HI>Reed</HI> at the same Time, and with the same Force, did take Possession of one Hundred and Thirty Saw-Logs, and fourteen Thousand Feet of Pine Boards, which Boards were made in the same Mill, &amp; all lying thereby, all which he converted to his own Use. Not long after, the original Proprietors of the said Mill, did re-enter, and take Possession thereof, but was a second Time attacked by Col. <HI>Reed</HI>'s Stewart, with a Number of armed Men, under his
<PB N="73" REF="013102_0072_0F8EBC27EC4ED988"/>(supposed). Instructions, and by their superior Force and Threats, obliged to quit the Premises again—all which Tenements, said <HI>Reed</HI> occupied and enjoyed until dispossessed, as your Excellency's Letter complains of.</P>
<P>BUT to return to <HI>Kockburn</HI> again. Cur Party having taken him as aforesaid, brought him to the Town of <HI>Castleton,</HI> near <HI>South Bay,</HI> where being first informed of your Excellency's Clemency as well as that of the honourable Council, in grant∣ing the Prayer of our Petition; and in Conformity to the Articles of Settlement agreed on, dismissed him on honourable Terms.</P>
<P>THIS is a short Narrative of Facts, for the Proof of which, sufficient Affidavits can be educed,</P>
<P>WE are apprehensive your Excellency has been hitherto unacquainted with these Facts, and have therefore exhibited them in this Letter; although it appears strange to us, according as your Ex∣cellency's own Letter states the Matter, that we should be suspected or taxed with violation of pub∣lic Faith, and that our disingenuous and disho∣nourable Violation thereof, hath nullified and made void the late amicable Settlement; for at the same Time your Excellency charges us with breach of Faith, and Settlement, the very Preli∣minaries of this Faith was not known on our Part, and consequently could not have been complied with, the very Stipulation and Faith spoken of, did not then exist, for it must be the Meeting of
<PB N="74" REF="013102_0073_0F8EBC296F6DA5B8"/>the Minds of the contracting Parties, which constitutes such Faith and Agreement, and of Course cannot be broken before its existence.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Kockburn</HI>'s locating our Lands in the mean Time the Preliminaries of Public Faith were form∣ing, was at least as much a Breach of that Faith, as what we are charged with. Nay, according to our Conception of the Matter, more so; as he made the first Movement towards the Invasion of our Property.</P>
<P>SOON after, our Messengers returned from New-York, and read the Minutes of Council, and your Excellency's Letter of Compliance there∣with, to a large Auditory convened at Benning∣ton for that purpose, composed of the Inhabitants of that Place, the adjacent Country, and sundry respectable Gentlemen from the neighbouring Pro∣vinces; your Excellency's gracious, wise, and benevolent Proposals for settling Unity and Con∣cord, in our Part of the Province, were by those present, unanimously applauded, and conceded to; and all possible public Testimonies of Honour and Respect, paid to your Excellency and Council, by sundry Discharges of Cannon and small Arms; your Excellency's Health, long Life, and Pros∣perity, as well as that of the honourable Council's, was the Toast; your Name commanded Reve∣rence and Esteem, and your Excellency's Person in particular, became precious in our Eyes.</P>
<P>AND, we do humbly assure your Excellency we have no Disposition of Alienation of Affec∣tions,
<PB N="75" REF="013102_0074_0F8EBC2A2ADCE680"/>towards you, or knowingly break any Ar∣ticle of Publick Faith.</P>
<P>THERE are two Propositions, which are the Ob∣jects of our Attention.</P>
<P>"FIRSTLY; The Protection and maintaining our Property.</P>
<P>AND, SECONDLY; to use the greatest Care and Prudence, not to break the Articles of Publick Faith, or insult Governmental Authority.</P>
<P>THESE two Propositions, we mean strictly and religiously to adhere to. And for the more ex∣plicit Knowledge of the Preliminaries and Condi∣tions of Publick Faith and Trust, we would in∣form your Excellency and Council, that our Ac∣ceptation of those Conditions on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> is, that they make no further settlements or Locations on our Lands, granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> until his Majesty's Pleasure be obtained, as to the validity of the Grants; although this was not so fully expressed, yet we suppose it was implied in the Abstract of the Minutes of Council; if it was not, we pray, your Excellency and Council would undeceive us in that Particular, for if we are deceived in this, then, on this Hypothesis, your Excellency and Council's lenient and friend∣ly Disposition towards Us, will not for the fu∣ture, (by us) be viewed as such; for such Locations and Settlements on our Lands, would be incom∣patible with Friendship, and a manifest Infringe∣ment
<PB N="76" REF="013102_0075_0F8EBC2B04EE0238"/>on our Property, which has all along been the Bone of Contention.</P>
<P>THE last part of your Excellency's Letter to Us, contains a Requirement of our immediate As∣sistance in repossessing Col. <HI>Reed</HI>'s Tenants of said Tenements. As to this Particular, had your Ex∣cellency have known by what Means Col. <HI>Reed</HI> obtained Possession of them Lands and Tene∣ments, undoubtedly your Excellency would not have required our Assistance in repossessing him; or have viewed with Concern, our dispossessing him, as a daring Insult to Government: For the Case right∣ly understood, it appears, that his Conduct was a daring Insult to Government, and continued Vi∣olation for more than three Years, of the Laws, Restrictions, Regulations, and OEconomy, both of God, and Man; a notorious Breach of the Tenth Command of the Decalogue, which says, <HI>"Thou shalt not covet, &amp;c."</HI> He coveting, did take the Saw-Mill-Logs, Boards, and also, the Lands, Labours, Possessions, Farms, Tene∣ments, &amp;c. &amp;c. from the rightful Owners, Pro∣prietors, and first Occupants thereof, without a process at Law, as aforesaid, to their Exclusion from the Premises more than three Years, all which Time He has been enriching Himself, by the improvement of their Estates; and, should we repossess him of the Premises again, We should become Co-Partners with Him, in his Wicked∣ness. Such an Act we could not reconcile to our own Consciences; it being a parently immoral, and most flagrantly Cruel and Unjust.</P>

WHEN your Excellency and Council views these Facts, and Arguments, we humbly conceive we shall not be required to repossess Colonel Reed of the Premises: Nor do we expect your Excellen∣cy and Council will adjudge us to be Violators of the late Articles of Public Faith: All which with due Submission, we refer to your Excellency and Council.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENTS, Demonstrating that the Property of the District of LAND aforesaid, was conveyed from the CROWN, to the NEW-HAMPSHIRE GRANTEES, by Virtue of their respective CHARTERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> rely on their Charters from that Govern∣ment as the predicate and ground of their Title to the Property of the Land in Contest; so, on the other Hand, the Claimants under <HI>New-York,</HI> pre∣dicate and ground their Title to the same Land on the Validity of their Patents from <HI>New-York:</HI> This brings the Point in Issue between the respec∣tive Claimants to this single Question, namely, <HI>Which of the said Governments conveyed the Fee of the Land in Contest?</HI> For it is self-evident both could not. And upon exploring the Controversy, and animadverting on the Merits of the different Claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to stand the Test, and adjudged Valid, it will of Necessity invalidate the other. In the Discussion of this Sub∣ject, and searching into the Merit of the respective Claims, it is necessary to inspect into the Validity of the Grant from King CHARLES to the Duke of York, from which Foundation only, the Govern∣ment
<PB N="80" REF="013102_0078_0F8EBC2FA48FF088"/>of <HI>New-York</HI> deduce their Right of patent∣ing the Lands in contest; yet the Matter of Fact is, that neither the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> as such, or any Individual therein, has ever had any Conveyance of any Land from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> nor doth any Landlord or Person whatever, in the Government hold the Fee or Property of their Land, by Virtue of any Conveyance from the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> but they hold the Fee of their Lands on a very different Footing, viz. by Conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that King CHARLES gave to his Brother James Duke of York, the Fee of the Lands West of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, to the Head of <HI>Delaware Bay;</HI> and allowing the Fee to be still vested in him, his Heirs or As∣signs, upon this Hypothesis no Person in the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York</HI> hath the Fee or Property of the Land they possess, the Fee remaining the Property of the Duke of York, his Heirs or Assigns. And further, upon the same Principle, those identical Pa∣tents under the Seal of <HI>New-York,</HI> which were laid on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, are in their own Nature, e∣qually null and void, with all other Conveyances of Land in the said Province which have been given by the Crown, the Fee thereof being vested in the Duke of York, &amp;c. So that the Grantees under <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> are both, upon this Stat∣ing of the Case, equally destitute of the Fee of the Land contested for: But, upon this Stating, the Grantees under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> have the Argu∣ment of Settlement, and Ocoupation, and Possessi∣on, on their Side; which is abundantly sufficient to give the Priority, and Preference of Title to them, so that neither the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> or
<PB N="81" REF="013102_0079_0F8EBC30A4686B58"/>their Patentees, gain any Thing by building their Title on the said Grant to the Duke of York—for if there be any Thing in it, it defeats their own Title as well as that of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> proving too much for their Purpose, or nothing at all: But, if the Lands contained in the Duke of York's Grant re∣verted back to the Crown, then the Duke of York's Patent became extinct, null, and absolutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the said Reversion happened in Consequence of the said Duke's abdicating the Throne—turning Papist, or by any formal Surrendery, or by any Means what∣ever, provided the Fee became revested in the Crown, then the said Charter became extinct, as aforesaid: so that whether the Fee of the Land in Dispute still remains in the said Duke of York, his Heirs or Assigns, or reverted, or was surrendered to the Crown, none of all this will in the least justify the Government of New-York or its Paten∣tees, in founding their Pretensions of Title to the Lands aforesaid, by Virtue of the aforesaid Grant from King Charles to the Duke of York. For, take the Argument one Way, and it overturns both the Title of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> also, leaving the latter in Occupation and Possession of the disputed Premises, and that only, being intirely destitute of the Fee; and the <HI>New-York</HI> Claimants destitute of the least Colour of Title whatsoever. But, take the Argument the other Way, viz. Pro∣vided the Fee of the Lands aforesaid reverted and been revested in the Crown, then the said Lands at the Time of first granting were crown Lands the same as though the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had never existed: But the Truth of the matter undoubtedly
<PB N="82" REF="013102_0080_0F8EBC310D688690"/>is this, the under Proprietors all except William Penn, who had the several Countries parcelled out to them by the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which was contain∣ed in his Grant; surrendered their Charters to the Crown, whereby <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> be∣came royal Governments: This then being the State of the Case, the Lands in Dispute became Crown Lands, and the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> as well as <HI>New-York</HI> Crown Officers, or King's Agents, and it is of no Consequence to the King which of his Governors, grants his Land, if so be they be granted to, and settled by loyal and indus∣trious Subjects, thereby adding to the Revenue of the Crown and enlarging and strengthening the Kingdom: This being presupposed, and admit for supposition only, that the Governor <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> exceeded his proper Limits in crown Lands, must the Grantees who have settled those Lands, paid one of the crown Officers for granting the same, and expended their ALL, in settling and cul∣tivating his Majesty's Wilderness Land, and who are truly loyal Subjects, be turn'd off the said Land by Thousands, and reduced to starving Poverty, together with their numerous Families, because one of the crown Officers either ignorantly or designedly imposed upon the People by grant∣ing Crown Lands over his Bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more so as it cannot be supposed that the Subjects are capable Judges of the Jurisdiction of Governments and consequently there should be the greatest care taken to guard the Subject from injury in all Cases of this Na∣ture, the Truth of which will more fully appear by the following Considerations, viz. That not∣withstanding
<PB N="83" REF="013102_0081_0F8EBC31B34E1820"/>the supposed Error in granting the said Lands, yet the great End of the Crown in granting of it is compleatly answered, and pro∣vided the Subjects i. e. the Settlers are quieted in the Fee and Possession of the said Lands, they will not be injured, so that upon this Hypothesis, neither King nor Subject would sustain Damage: Indeed no Person in the Realm could have just Cause of Complaint. True, the respective Gover∣nors of <HI>New-York</HI> may insinuate, that upon this state of the Case, the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> has cheated them out of their Fees for granting the said Land—though it is evident, if Crown Officers are faithful to the King and Subjects, they could take no more Money for granting Crown Lands, than a reasonable Compensation for their Trouble, and the other Governor's being supposed to grant the Lands, saves the said Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> the trouble; so that the Argument is brought to this single Point only at last, that upon Supposition the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> exceeded his proper Limits in granting those Lands, yet neither King nor Subjects are injured, (provided the Claimants un∣der <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> hold the Fee of the said Land as above) except the Governors of New-York, and if they be supposed to be honest Men, the Trouble of granting the Land would be equal to their Fees had they granted it; so that they have not been injured a Whit more in this Case, than they may be supposed to have injured the Subjects by taking exorbitant Fees for granting the same Lands; which to them is no Injury at all, but a providential Check to the Excercise of their Avarice. So that the respective Governors of <HI>New-York,</HI> in an equitable Sense, are no Loosers in
<PB N="84" REF="013102_0082_0F8EBAC9ABEE4AC8"/>this Affair; or at most the Privileges would be so very inconsiderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, especially when set in Competition with the shocking and universal Destruction that would overspread a large Country of his Majesty's good Subjects, provided they be dispossessed of the Lands aforesaid. This seems to be the genuine Sequel of the Argument, even upon the Yorker's own Stating it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION, II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not conceeded to on the Part of the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> that the Governor did in Fact exceed his proper Limits in granting those Lands, the contrary will abundatly appear from the following Considerations, viz. Before and at the Time the said Governor of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> granted those Lands they were reputed to be within his Jurisdiction, this was the Opinion of both Learned and Unlearned, the Wise as well as Simple, thus it was universally planed in all an∣cient and modern Maps down to the Year 1764, when, by royal Determination, the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> was extended over this disputed District of Land: But the general Opinion before this royal Adjudication was that the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> extended its Jurisdiction but Twenty Miles to the Eastward from <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, so general was this Opinion that the best Maps of the two respective Provinces, and the History of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> adopted it as settled; it is of very great weight in the Question to shew how univesal this Maxim was, and that the unprejudiced and accurate Geographer Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> in his Map composed so
<PB N="85" REF="013102_0083_0F8EBC3369E6E9D8"/>late as the Year 1755, which with great Propriety and Certainty ascertains the same Limits, this Map has the more Authority as it was according to the Certificate of Mr. Pownal, Secretary to the Board of Trade, and was undertaken with the Approbation and at the Request of the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantation, and is chiefly composed from Draughts, Charts, and actual Serveys of dif∣ferent Parts of His Majesty's Colonies and Plan∣tations in America, great Part of which have been since taken by their Lordships Orders and trans∣mitted to the Office of the Governors of said Colo∣nies: This Twenty Mile Line was so far from being deemed unfavourable to <HI>New-York,</HI> that we find the Commissioners from that Province so late as the Year 1767, made an Offer to those of the Massachusetts-Bay to let a Line at Twenty Miles distance East of <HI>Hudson's</HI> River be the Division between their respective Provinces, which the latter Commissioners would not then agree to it, being Thought by them too much in Favour of <HI>New-York,</HI> so little it seems did <HI>New-York</HI> Commission∣ers conceive their Claim as far as <HI>Connecticut</HI> River could be supported.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is true in the Year 1771 the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York</HI> by a publick Act of their Gene∣ral Assembly, did annex all that Part of the Pro∣vince of the Massachusetts-Bay, to the Westward from <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, to their County of <HI>Albany;</HI> and it is likewise true that in the Year 1773 the Governor's of the respective Provinces met at <HI>Hartsord</HI> in <HI>Connecticut</HI> and came to a mutual A∣greement to settle that Line at Twenty Miles dis∣tance
<PB N="86" REF="013102_0084_0F8EBC378A0EA178"/>Eastward from <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, which was the Hypothesis of that Settlement, which hath since been ratified by His Majesty.</P>
<P>THE Report of the Lords Commissioners for Plantation Affairs in 1753, States the following Facts, from which is necessarily inferred that <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> extended its Jurisdiction to the Westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.—"There are, says their Lord∣ships, about 60,000 Acres of Land situate on the West side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which was purchased by private Persons from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to whom the Land had been laid out, by the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> as an equivalent for two or three Townships which the Latter purchased from the Former, this Tract of Land by the determina∣tion of the Boundary Line between the Provinces of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in 1739 is become a Part of <HI>New-Hampshire."</HI>—Thus we have their Lordships Sentiments that the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> extended over Part of the very Lands in Contest, Westward of <HI>Connec∣ticut</HI> River, as long ago as the Year 1739, at which Time <HI>New-York</HI> never dreamed of extending their Claim to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.—There is another glaring and indisputable evidence of the former Western extent of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> viz. Relative to Fort Dummer which was Built by the Bay Pro∣vince in 1724, and garrisoned at their Expence a great Number of Years; but upon its being ex∣cluded from their Jurisdiction by the Settlement of the jurisdictional Line, between them and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in 1739, the <HI>Bay</HI> Province repre∣sented to the Government at Home, that the said
<PB N="87" REF="013102_0085_0F8EBC3863469BF0"/>District of Land and Fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> having been determined to be the Property of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> they were no longer obliged to Garrison and main∣tain it, and praying, That as it was necessary to the Defence of the Country, that <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> might be directed to support it. In Consequence of which, an Order passed the King and Council in 1744, that the Governor and Commander in Chief of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> should forthwith move the As∣sembly, in His Majesty's Name, to make a proper Provision for that Service; and at the same Time informing them that in Case they refused to com∣ply with so reasonable and necessary a Proposal, his Majesty would find himself under a Necessity of restoring that Fort, with a proper District of Land contiguous thereto, to the Province of the <HI>Massa∣chusett's-Bay,</HI> who cannot with Justice be required to maintain a Fort no longer within their Bounda∣ry. In consequence of this, <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> did maintain this Fort, and paid a Demand of Arrears for its Maintainance, to the <HI>Massachusett's-Bay.</HI> In the mean Time <HI>New-York</HI> was never a Compe∣titor for the Burthen, willing as she is to enjoy the Advantage of granting and engrossing the said Lands.</P>
<P>THIS being the Case, the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> by the Royal Decree, was obliged to main∣tain Fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> and it being on the West Side of <HI>Connecticnt</HI> River, and on this very identical Dis∣trict of Land now in Dispute, can that Government be justly charged with granting Lands in the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York,</HI> when but a little before his Majesty in Council had adjudged the same Lands to
<PB N="88" REF="013102_0086_0F8EBAC9689A12D0"/>be in the said Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and ordered them to defend it, as by maintaining Fort Dummer, &amp;c. Surely at that Time <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> did extend its Jurisdiction Westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River; otherwise the King had ordered the Govern∣ment of New-York to have maintained Fort Dummer. Nothing can be more flagrantly evident, than, that the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> had a Right to Grant Crown Lands where the Crown compell∣ed them to Defend. From Hence it appears, that the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> had a legal Right to grant the Lands now in Dispute, and that, that Government and his Majesty's good Subjects, the Grantees of, and Settlers on the said Lands, acted upon honest and honourable Principles, in granting purchasing, and settling the same, and on the o∣ther Hand, it appears, that the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> in re-granting the same Land, acted quite the reverse; and the more unpardonably so, as they granted great Part of it, in open Defiance to His Majesty's Authority manifested unto them by his express Prohibition, dated the 24th Day of July 1767.</P>
<P>FROM what has been already elucidated it ap∣pears, that the Line of Jurisdiction between the respective Provinces was not exactly ascertained till the 20th of July 1764; but nevertheless that the Administration of Great-Britain had adjudged in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the Govern∣ment of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> extended Westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and that this was the general Sense of the Nation (till ascertained as aforesaid) is real Matter of Fact.—True no Determination of
<PB N="89" REF="013102_0087_0F8EBC38780362D0"/>His Majesty or Reports of the Lords of Trade had before particularized how far the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> should extend West of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River: but such Determinations of their's mightily strengthened the common Opinion, nay, fully con∣firmed it, that that Government extended West∣ward to a twenty Miles Distance, East from <HI>Hud∣son</HI>'s River; intersecting a parrallel Line with the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and the Province of the <HI>Mas∣sachusett's Bay,</HI> between them and said Province of <HI>New-York.</HI> This was the Opinion both of King and Subjects at the Time the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> granted those Lands; and Americans could not conceive of any intermediate Boundary in one Place more than another, between <HI>Connecticut</HI> River and the twenty-mile Limit aforesaid; nor had they any Apprehension that the Government of <HI>New Hampshire</HI> would extend to the Westward of that Limit. This parrallel Line took univer∣sal and deep Impression on the Minds of Geo∣graphers, and was the Understanding of the British Empire, and was thus portrayed in all former Maps.—The Certainty of this general Opinion may be further illustrated from the Consideration that none of the British Subjects applied to the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> for Grants of those Lands, till after the Alteration of Jurisdiction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <HI>New-York</HI> Scriblers, that their Government extended Patents from within the said twenty mile Line a∣cross the same, and on some Part of the Premises in Dispute, many Years before the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> granted those Lands—which will
<PB N="90" REF="013102_0088_0F8EBC399740D1E0"/>be hereafter considered: But, would further add, it is Matter of Dispute whether the Administrati∣on at Home would recognize those Patents grant∣ed by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the Pre∣mises aforesaid; though antecedent to those grant∣ed by <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> inasmuch as the Royal Ad∣judication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> to grant them Lands, which by Royal Adjudication of the Line of Ju∣risdiction between <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> fell within the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in 1739, as aforesaid. However, for Argument only, we will suppose the Governments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New-York</HI> had each of them equal Authority to grant those Lands—then on this Stating the Case, prior granting would of Conse∣quence be Priority of Title. The first Convey∣ance, upon this Hypothesis, being good and valid both in Law and Equity, must necessarily defeat any subsequent Grant from the Crown or its Re∣presentatives, being as authentic, to all Intents and Purposes, as any Conveyance of the Fee of Land from the Crown can possibly be.—Thus it appears upon this most favourable Concession to those on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the Argument pre∣ponderates in Favour of the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> as their Grants are prior to those of <HI>New-York,</HI> (except in the Instances of the old Pa∣tents, yet to be considered.)</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the express Words of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, that the Grantees were not only intitled to the Fee of the Lands
<PB N="91" REF="013102_0089_0F8EBC39FB7B7290"/>therein discribed, but also to all the Enfranchise∣ments, and each and every of the Privileges and Immunities that by Law his Majesty's Subjects in the Province of <HI>New Hampshire</HI> enjoy; so that at the same Time that the Grantees were vested with the Fee of the Land, they were enfranchised with, and entitled to, all the Privileges and Immunities contained in their Charters; as the holding of Fairs, choosing Town Officers, and making and mending their own Roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it should be the future Pleasure of his Majesty, to continue the said Lands in the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> (which by the Settlers aforesaid is hoped will not be the Case) that the Claimants and Settlers under the said Grants, will nevertheless have his Majesty's gra∣cious Approbation to enjoy without Let or Moles∣tation, the Privileges of Incorporation therein con∣tained; the Grantees having ever considered those Privileges as inseperably connected with the Grant of the Fee-Simple.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the Facts and Reasons that have been advanced in the foregoing Sections, it mani∣festly appears, that the Title of the Claimants un∣der <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> to the Lands in Question is indefeasible; yet still there are sundry Considerati∣ons that may serve more abundantly to confirm and establish this Title beyond Hesitation. As,</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, The far greatest Part of the Extent
<PB N="92" REF="013102_0090_0F8EBC3ADB1DD178"/>of Jurisdiction of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and great Part of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> depended entire∣ly on his Majesty's Pleasure, being wholly in the Arbitration of the Crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real Grant on which the original Circumference of the Government of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> was founded, extended but Sixty Miles from the Sea into the Country, to the Westward, ter∣minating about Twenty Miles East of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. This Government was afterwards enlarged by his Majesty's Commission to <HI>Benning Wentworth,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of that Province, directing it to extend to the Westward until it should meet with his Majesty's other Governments. Which Clause of Western Extention, in the said Commission, as well as the Royal Adjudication of the boundary Line between this Government and the <HI>Massachu∣setts-Bay</HI> in 1739, and Report of the Lords of Trade in 1755, and many Arguments mentioned in this and the foregoing Sections, all, on the Part of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> amount to sufficient Evidence, that their Government extended so far West as to intersect the parrallel Line of the Colony of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> and Province of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> as argued above. And with respect to the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> it's original Northen Circumference terminated South of the City of Albany, and af∣terwards, as Plantations were extended Northerly, either on Patents procured immediately from the Crown, or Government, or meer Settlements on Extra-provincial Lands, Commissions from the King, to the respective Governors were enlarged, as in the Example following, viz. A. M. <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR>
<PB N="93" REF="013102_0091_0F8EBC3B75DCE508"/>Captain General, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> (then follows the Enlargement,) and the Territories de∣pending thereon in America.—These Territories are that Extension of Jurisdiction beyond their first circumscribed Limits, terminating South of <HI>Alba∣ny,</HI> called the Province. This territorial Exten∣sion of Jurisdiction is altogether in the Arbitration of the Crown to curtail or extend as before repre∣sented. This being the Case, the respective Go∣vernors can no other Way be Judges of the Extent of their Jurisdiction, but by Directions given them in their Commissions, together with his Majesty's express Proclamations, and public Determinations relative thereto, as in the Instance of the Royal Adjudication in 1764; a Publication of which, by his Majesty's Order, gave his Subjects to under∣stand, that it was his Pleasure that the Territorial Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> should extend to the West Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which includes the disputed Premises within that Government; before this it was impossible for the Subjects to know it; if they could have understood it without his Majesty's Proclamation certifying the same, such Proclamation would have been needless and impertinent. The Truth of the Matter is, his Majesty in 1739, determined <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Go∣vernment should cover the present disputed Pre∣mises; he altered his Determination in 1764, where∣by <HI>New-York</HI> extended it's Territories over the same Land. And the King has an undoubted Right to alter and regulate the Jurisdiction of Royal Governments as may seem to Him mete;
<PB N="94" REF="013102_0092_0F8EBC3CAA2C2480"/>and for the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> to pretend to amuse Peo∣ple of common Sense, pretending that it is the an∣cient and indisputable Right of the Colony of <HI>New-York</HI> to extend to the West Banks of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> River, as it's eastern Boundary, is the very Height of Folly: It was in the Nature of Things absolutely impossible his Majesty himself should have known that to have been the Case the Mo∣ment before he determined it, and equally incon∣sistent that the Subjects should know it before his Majesty proclaimed it.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the Representati∣on which was laid before his Majesty by Lieute∣nant Governor <HI>Colden,</HI> as an Inducement to prefix the West Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, the eastern Boundary of the Province of <HI>New-York</HI>—That they were Arguments of Conveniency, holding up to View that it would be greatly to the Advantage of the Inhabitants on the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, to be under the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York;</HI> which Arguments are incompatible with the Idea of an∣tecedent Right of Jurisdiction. Likewise, from hence we may see the Inconsistency of that Go∣vernment or it's Patentees, in founding their Right in Fee to All or any Part of the Lands in Contest, by Virtue of the said Royal Adjudication of the Boundary Line on the West Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River; inasmuch as it cannot operate to their Ad∣vantage antecedent to the Date of that Adjudica∣tion, and afterward cannot be considered any Thing more than a mere Line of Jurisdiction between the respective Governments.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="013102_0093_0F8EBC3D28A5EA10"/>
IT should be furthermore considered, that nei∣ther Governments were vested with the Fee of those Lands; their Case in this Respect, is quite the Reverse to that of Proprietary Governments, who have a Right to appropriate the Soil. In Royal Governments, it is true, the Governors have a delegated Authority from his Majesty to grant Crown Lands; and in such Governments it is a Prerogative of the Crown to alter the Limits of Jurisdiction; His Majesty hath a Right to re-an∣nex the disputed Premises to his Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> (in which it formerly was, and on the Faith of which the Claimants under that Govern∣ment purchased and settled the same Lands) or in∣corporate it into a new Government, or continue it under the present Jurisdiction, as his Royal Wis∣dom may discern to be best for the governed: But, upon such Alterations of Jurisdiction, private Property is never changed or subverted. For, if the Property of the Subject be in the Arbitration of the Crown, and liable to the same Vicissitudes and Changes with Jurisdiction, this would destroy the very Nature of Property, and would render a King absolute, and despotic, which is perfectly in∣consistent with the Constitution of the Kingdom.—Therefore, to convey or alienate Property, is the sacred Prerogative of the rightful OWNER.—Kings and Governors (in the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>) cannot intermeddle therewith. There is indeed as much Difference between the Change of Jurisdiction, and transfering of the Property of the Subject, as there is between Light and Darkness; although since the said Royal Adjudication in
<PB N="96" REF="013102_0094_0F8EBC3E028AB220"/>1764, the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> have endeavoured to blend them together to answer sinister and lucrative Pur∣poses.—They were sensible, undoubtedly, that such the aforesaid Arguments were conclusive a∣gainst their monopolizing the Fee-simple of said Lands; and as it is very common for People, who are upon a Design of engrossing the Property of their Neighbour, to set up some specious Pretence of Right to vindicate themselves from the Impu∣tation of Dishonor and Reproach; so in the present Case, the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> endeavour to draw the Cur∣tain of the Duke of York over their Knavery, and under the feigned Character of Heirs to that apos∣tate Duke, claim the Lands aforesaid, and fancy themselves the Owners of Towns, (Fields) and Houses that they builded not.</P>

<P>HAVING finished the general Narrative of the Controversy subsisting between the Claim∣ants, under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> to Lands to the Westward of Connecticut River; which were firstly granted by the Former, and which, by the Determination of the Boundary-Line, between the respective Provinces in 1764, fell within the Jurisdiction of the Latter. And, having given the Reader to understand the Op∣pressions which the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> have exercised towards the Grantees and Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> which could not have been so effectually done any other Way, as by transcrib∣ing the Letters from Governor Tryon to the In∣habitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent Coun∣try, and their Answers to him, on the State of the aforesaid Controversy; which were published in the public News Papers, directly after they were wrote. And having also finished three Sec∣tions of Arguments, which demonstrate that the Fee of those Lands was conveyed from the Crown to the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantees, by Virtue of their respective Charters; the last Thing proposed, is to

<P>ALTHOUGH the Arguments contained in the foregoing Sections are full and conclusive, rela∣tive to the Nullity and Nothingness of the Duke of York's Grant, at least, such Part thereof as con∣cerns the present Dispute; and that neither the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> or its Patentees gain any Manner of Title to the Land in Contest, by predi∣cating it on the Validity of that Grant, yet the General Assembly of the said Province in their State of the Rights, &amp;c. venture the Stress of their whole Cause thereon, and deduce all their Ar∣guments of Title to those disputed Premises there∣from: It is therefore partly out of Compliment to so learned a Body of Doctors, as well as more fully to invalidate, and apparently demonstrate, to every capable Judge, the utter Insufficiency and Defect of Title to those Lands, by Convey∣ance

<P>It appears from the Sequel of the Representa∣tions, Narratives and Arguments contained in the <HI>New-York</HI> Pamphlet, that the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> do not pretend to any Conveyance of the Fee of the Lands in Contest from the Duke of <HI>York.</HI> But their Grand Hypothesis is, that the Jurisdiction of their Government from the first Establishment, was predicated on, and bound∣ed by the descriptive Limits of the said Grant; and consequently, that the disputed Premises was never in the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> and, that that Government never was vested with Authority to grant those Lands, and also conse∣quently, that the Grants by them made, are in their own Nature void. This is the Sum of the
<PB N="101" REF="013102_0099_0F8EBB3B161CACD0"/><HI>New-York</HI> Arguments relative to their Title to those Lands. Here,</P>
<P>FIRST, it is necessary the descriptive Limits of the above rehearsed Charter be brought under Con∣sideration; which includes the Countries of <HI>St. Croix,</HI> adjoining <HI>New Scotland, Pemaquid,</HI> the River <HI>Kenebeque,</HI> and the Islands known by the Names of <HI>Martin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</HI> &amp;c. All these Coun∣tries lying far East of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and within the actual Jurisdiction of the Provinces of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay, New-Hampshire,</HI> &amp;c. and at pre∣sent, not contended for on the Part of <HI>New-York.</HI> Their General Assembly, in the <Q>State of the Right.</Q> &amp;c. had done well to have informed the Publick; whether their "ancient and indisput∣able Right" of Jurisdiction extended to every Part of the discriptive Limits of the Grants aforesaid, and if not, to which Part it was circumscribed; and when done, and by what Authority; whether their Governors Commissions, at any Time, par∣ticularized and determined to what Part of the Li∣mits of the said Duke's Grant their Jurisdiction should extend, more than another, or to the whole; or, whether any Royal Edict or Proclamation, had ever thus given them such predicated Limits of Ju∣risdiction: this is absolutely necessary for them to do, in Support of their Title to the Lands in Ques∣tion. And furthermore, it is requisite for them to demonstrate that those Lands were actually con∣tained in such their former Limits of Jurisdiction: but, if the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> from Royal Determination, cannot extend Jurisdiction to any
<PB N="102" REF="013102_0100_0F8EBB3BC0EC2520"/>one Part of the descriptive Limits of the Grant afore∣said, more than to another; then, on this Hypothesis, their Jurisdiction includes the whole Limits con∣tained in the Grant, or none at all; that it in∣cludes the Whole, will not be pretended, and that any Part, as predicated on them Limits, cannot be made to appear: But on the contrary, it appears His Majesty and Council had no Reference to any Part of the Limits of this Grant, in determining the Boundaries of the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York</HI> in 1764, as may appear from the Royal Order itself, an Extract of which is as follows: <Q>His Majes∣ty with the Advice of his Privy Council, doth Order and Declare, That the West Banks of the River <HI>Connecticut,</HI> from where it enters the Pro∣vince of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> as far North, as the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, to be the Boundary between the said two Provin∣ces</Q>—that Parrallel of Latitude is also established it's North Boundary, &amp;c. The Source of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River is supposed to be something to the Northward of Latitude Forty-Five, and comes much from the North-East, a considerable Dis∣tance after it passes that Latitude; but it is notori∣ous, that the Source of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River is far South of it; so that by comparing the descriptive Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, with those expressed in the Royal Order, they will be found to be ma∣terially different. The Limit of that Part of the Duke's Grant, which respects the present Argu∣ments, is in the Words following: <Q>Together also with the said River called <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, and all the Lands from the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River
<PB N="103" REF="013102_0101_0F8EBB3C8C808020"/>to the East Side of <HI>Delaware Bay;</HI></Q> which Limit in any possible Construction of it, can include but Part of the disputed Premises, (which said Premises extend and are bounded on the Forty-fifth Degree of North Latitude,) as will more fully appear in a further Discussion of that Line. But,</P>
<P>FIRST, it is manifest that the King and Privy Council, in determining the Extent of the Juris∣diction of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> did not proceed upon the Idea of that Government's having any antecedent Right of Jurisdiction to those Lands. Had that been the Case, the Royal Order had been predicated on the Boun∣dary Lines of the Duke's Grant aforesaid, and could not have comprehended any more Land than <Q>from the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River to the East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay;</Q> and these Bounds are so loose, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impossible to found a Line of Jurisdic∣tion thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following Observations on the discriptive Li∣mits thereof, which may be seen at Large in the fore Part of this Section. Therefore, such Part only, as is necessary for the Consideration of the indeterminate Bounds, before spoken of, is here quoted; which, after describing the Situation of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and that it abuts upon the Main Land <Q>between the two Rivers there called or known by the several Names of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River,</Q> begins the Discription under Consider∣ation, <Q>together with the said River called <HI>Hud∣son</HI>'s River.</Q> Observe, that as the Description
<PB N="104" REF="013102_0102_0F8EBB3D507C3AE8"/>of this River is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following Discriptions in said Grant; nothing more can possibly be included in it, but a Discription of the River only, exclusive of one Foot of Land on either Side. The second Discription <Q>and all the Land from the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River to the East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay.</Q> The best Mathematician on Earth can∣not ascertain these Limits, except upon arbitrary Principles, as there can be no prefixed Place on <HI>Connecticut</HI> River where to erect the first Bounds; and as to any particular Place on the <Q>East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay,</Q> where to erect a Second, is altogether undetermined in this Discription: But, inasmuch as it includes all the Land from the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, &amp;c. there is a little better Foundation to establish the first Bounds than the Second. It seems in order to include All as afore∣said, it would be necessary to extend either to the Head of the River, or to the most Northerly Ex∣tention of the whole Stream, to make the first Bounds; and provided this imaginary Bounds should extend North of the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, it would so far exceed the Set∣tlement of the Line in 1764. Be this as it will, the most Northerly Part of the River, which would most likely be the Head, would be the most fa∣vourable on the Part of New-York, for to establish a first Bounds, and from thence to extend a strait Line to some Place on the East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay; this is something of a natural Construction, on the indeterminate descriptive Limits aforesaid, without exploring <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which in this
<PB N="105" REF="013102_0103_0F8EBB3E0B426688"/>Case is necessary. And, First, in tracing said River to its Source, it is found towards it's Extremity, to come much out of the North-East. This being the Case, a strait Line from it's Head to <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, would cross said River and include a large Tract of Land on the East Side, and perhaps cross the River sundry Times; the Consequences may be drawn thus, that where the Line may be sup∣posed to cross the last Time, ought to be the first real North Boundary, of the <Q>ancient and indis∣putable</Q> Limit of Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York.</HI> For, if the Bounds at the Head of the River be∣fore spoken of, be so established, it would include considerable Land on the East Side of the River, within the old Boundary of New-York, which is contrary to any Idea to be gained from the discrip∣tive Limit aforesaid, viz. <Q>and all the Land from the West Side of Connecticut River, &amp;c.</Q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another proposed first Boundary better purporting with the Discription of <Q>And all the Land from the West Side of Connecticut River to the East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay,</Q> between the Head of the River, and the Place where the imaginary Line was supposed to pass? To this it may be answered, that a Place between these two, so far up the River as in tracing a strait Line from thence, to <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, would not cross the River, may better agree with the above Discription: Still, from none of these imagined Lines, from the different imagined Bounds, or from any other projected, possible, first Bounds, can such a strait Line be ascertained, till the Place for the South-Western Boundary on the
<PB N="106" REF="013102_0104_0F8EBB3EAF0D9010"/>"East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay" be established? And the Vagueness of the discriptive Limit is so great, that it cannot be determined whether that Bounds shall be at the Northern Extremity of the East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, or at the Southern, where it communicates with the main Ocean, or at any other intermediate Place between these two: so, that from the uncertainty of the second Bounds, it is impossible to establish the first, so as exactly to include "all the Land from the West Side of the said River to the East Side of said Bay," and no more. And,</P>
<P>THUS it is demonstrated from the Vagueness, Uncertainty and Obsoleteness of the discriptive Li∣mits of the Grant to the Duke of York, before quoted at large; that it is in the Nature of Things absolutely impossible to ascertain it. From hence follows a Second necessary inference, viz. That it is equally impossible and contradictory, that governmental Jurisdiction should be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain Jurisdiction, in its own Nature incapable to be determined, is in reali∣ty none at all. And from hence follows a Third Inference which determines the Sequel of the Argu∣ment, on the Subject of Property, concerning the Lands in Question, to be in Favour of the Claim∣ants under <HI>New-Hampshire:</HI> For, it is in the last Place, equally contradictory and impossible, as in the Case of the Absurdity of ascertaining the Limits of the pretended "ancient" Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York,</HI> predicating it on vague and undeterminate Boundaries, that, that Government should predi∣cate
<PB N="107" REF="013102_0105_0F8EBB406BDB66D8"/>their Right to the Fee of Lands, by them thus unascertainable; for as Uncertainty, and natural Impossibility of a Jurisdiction's being rendered determinate makes it in Reality to be none at all; so the Idea of Property, predicated thereon is e∣qually impertinent.—True it is, by the royal De∣termination in 1764, the East Line of <HI>New-York</HI> extended to the West Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. Which may be Foundation for Conjecture, that, that Limit might have Reference to a Discription in the Duke's Grant aforesaid, "and all the Lands from the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River," &amp;c. Yet when the Representation made by Lieut. Governor Colden, to his Majesty in Council, as mentioned in this Pamphlet, under the Head of the Narra∣tive, &amp;c. comes to be considered it will reflect Light on this Point. The Arguments made Use of in the said Representation were those of Conveniency and Advantage to the Settlers on those Lands to be in the Government of New-York: And, that the West Banks of Connecticut River was a good and certain Boundary," &amp;c. These were un∣doubtedly the preponderating Motives of deter∣mining the West Banks of Connecticut River to be the East Boundary of New-York, and such Ar∣guments are utterly inconsistant with the Notion of an "Ancient indisputable Right" of Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THERE is still another Consideration which may be of Moment in the Observation of this, so Trumpt-up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the Province of New-York, to the Lands in Contest: If it be admitted a Line should be drawn from the most northerly Part of Connecticut River
<PB N="108" REF="013102_0106_0F8EBB40EFF67140"/>to the most northern Extremity of Delaware-Bay; still, it is by no means probable such Line would include more than one half (if so much) of the Lands in Dispute so far as may be judged from the Latitude and Longitude of the respective Objects: For considering the Course of Connecticut River, which is nearly from North to South, except to∣wards its Extremity; and the Sea coast, from the River's Mouth, together with Delaware Bay, forming also an indened Line, to the South of West; the Land included in these Limits, by a Line drawn from Connecticut River to Delaware Bay as aforesaid, would (excepting the small Pro∣montory formed by the Mouth of the Bay and the Ocean) lye in the Figure of an obtuse angled Triangle; and the Course of the said Line from the River to the Bay, according to occular Survey, would be from the Northeast a Southwesterly Di∣rection: Which very badly comports with the present North and Westerly Exercise of Jurisdicti∣on of the Government of New-York, at Crown∣point, Detroit, &amp;c.—It may here well be observed, the Settlers under New-Hampshire seem to be in a critical Situation; every arbitrary Measure under the present Administration of the Government of New-York, is excercised against them; and pro∣vided they flee to the Eastward to procure Inherit∣ances, there they are fore-closed, the discriptive Limits of the said ancient Jurisdiction covers them (to wit) the Countries of St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard, &amp;c.—Yet there is another large unknown Country to the West and Northwest, which has been but part∣ly
<PB N="109" REF="013102_0107_0F8EBB41C892D6E8"/>explored; and provided, these People, instead of fleeing to the Eastward, should turn their Course, to those Countries; there, it is indisputable but that, New-York would encircle them with ano∣ther odd Discription of Domain contained in their Governor's Commissions, i. e. <Q>A. B. Captain General Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of New-York,</Q> next fol∣lows the Discription hinted <Q>and the Territories depending thereon, in America.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the foregoing Discriptions of the Govern∣ment of New-York, it appears they lay Claim to so extensive a Domain three different Ways, or have three different Modes or Modifications in comprehending and engrossing their progressive Limits. As,</P>
<P N="1">1stly. THE Province of New-York, which falls short of, and terminates considerably South of the City of Albany.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. "THE Territories depending thereon in America." These Territories comprehending such Plantations, on extra-provincial Land, as are and have been carried on adjoining to the Province till its Territories, are at present extended to Detroit and the Neighbourhood thereof, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, and inasmuch as the Grantees and Settlers on the Lands in Dispute, hold their Title under New-Hampshire, and that Government had for several Years exercised their Jurisdiction over those Lands,
<PB N="110" REF="013102_0108_0F8EBB4275649058"/>even till 1764.—Therefore, in this Case the Go∣vernment of New-York could not extend their Territorial Sort of Jurisdiction over the Premises; for such Sort of Jurisdiction might be challenged on the Part of New-Hampshire (if it should be ad∣mited at that Time, said Premises was extra-pro∣vincial Lands) and that with far the most Propriety. Inasmuch as that Government had granted the Land and began Settlements thereon. Add to this the following Clause in Governor Wentworth's Commission, which they viewed to be of great Weight in this Case, which, after discribing the former Limits of New-Hampshire, <Q>and from thence extending West till it meets with his Majesty's other Governments.</Q> Add to this also, the Reasons held forth in the Chain of Arguments, contained in the three first Sections; all which were too potent for the New-York territorial Sort of Dominion to frustrate. At that Juncture, Therefore, the Lawyers, Land-jobbers, Politicians, &amp;c. planed out the aforesaid third Modes of Ju∣risdiction predicating it on the discriptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of York. And on this new modled Plan breathed an air of <Q>ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT of</Q> Jurisdiction, and con∣sequently to the Fee of the Lands in Contest.</P>
<P>THE first Intimation that ever saluted the Ears of the Publick, asserting it to be the ancient Right of the Colony of New-York, to extend to Con∣necticut River as its eastern Boundary, was dis∣coverd from a Proclamation, given under the Hand of William Tryon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of the
<PB N="111" REF="013102_0109_0F8EBB4693DC1370"/>Province of New-York, &amp;c. and dated the 11th Day of December, 1771. His Proclamation be∣gins after the following Manner. <Q>Whereas it is the ancient and incontestible Right of this Co∣lony to extend to Connecticut River, as its Eastern Boundary.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was drawing a positive Conclusion from fictitious, and till that Time, unheard of Premises: and rather influenced People, in the several Go∣vernments, to purchase and settle under New-Hampshire, than diswade them therefrom, for common Fame, and common Sense were a Barrier against the Belief of this New-York Doctrine, which from the Time of the royal Adjudication in 1764, was by the Proclamation aforesaid, anti∣dated to "Ancient." That this Doctrine till then, was incontested, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public Consideration, and has ever since been contested.</P>
<P>SHOULD this, their new Hypothesis be admitted; yet, as hath been before observed, these Limits could include but Part of said Lands, according to the best Judgment that can be formed without an actual, and accurate Survey of the discriptive Li∣mits of said Grant; which if the New-Yorkers can do and fairly Demonstrate, to any able Mathe∣maticians, and competant and impartial Judges, that they have rightly ascertaned those Limits, it is engaged on the Part of the Claimants under New-Hampshire that they shall yield up, to the Land-jobbers of New-York, their Lands and Labours:
<PB N="112" REF="013102_0110_0F8EBB4799F5F730"/>an Object which undoubtedly would be grateful and pleasing to them; and which they have many Years been in Pursuit of, and have hitherto had the Mortification to be baffled. It is verily Incum∣bant on the Government of New-York, in order to found Tittle to those Land on this new Scheme,</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, to ascertain the Limits of their ima∣ginary Bounds: This, the Claimants under New-Hampshire, will expect compleated, or hear no more of those "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" Boundaries of New-York.</P>

<P>THE General Assembly of the Colony of New-York, in their State of the Right of that Colony, &amp;c. Page 3d. wave the Right of the English by first Discovery, as being foreign to their Purpose, &amp; that the Dutch Possessions are only material to be supported; and Claim no further Right by Pay of the Dutch, but priority of Possession. Yet in the same Page inform, <Q>when the first War be∣tween England and Holland became inevitable, King Charles the Second, by Letters Patent dated the 12th Day of March 1663-4, granted to his Brother the Duke of York the Tracts of Country, which comprehend <HI>New-York.</HI> To ren∣der this Gift effectual, before the War was proclaimed, a Fleet and Land Forces were sent out to remove the Dutch and put the Duke in Possession.</Q>— The Circumstancies that attended the making this Grant, and sending the Armament
<PB N="113" REF="013102_0111_0F8EBB47ADC66240"/>to render it effectual, are a sufficient Reason to Determine that the Government at Home, at that Time, viewed the Dutch Settlement as an Intrusi∣on, and Possession (which is all they rely on) gained by trespass, in legal Construction, is no Possession at all. That the English had prior Right to all the Countries from Forty to Forty-eight Degrees of North Latitude, by Virtue not only of Discovery by <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> and others, but by being in actual Possession of several Parts of the Premises, is Matters too well known to be disputed.</P>
<P>WHETHER there was real Seisin in the Crown, or not, or the Time of granting these Countries, is not truly in Question; since every Grant so made is incontestibly valid against the King, his Heirs and Successors; and the Colony of New-York be∣ing entirely Dependant on the Crown of Great-Bri∣tain for their Title; Priority of Charter is there∣fore necessary to be determined.</P>
<P>THE Grant of King James the First to the Council of Plymouth bearing Date at Westminster, the 13th Day of November, in the Eighteenth Year or his Reign: comprehends all the Lands, Islands, &amp;c. from forty to forty-eight Degrees of North Latitude, through the Main Land from Sea to Sea. On the 19th Day of March 1628, the Council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> under their common Seal, did grant to Sir <HI>Henry Roswell,</HI> Sir <HI>John Young,</HI> and Others, their Heirs and Associates for ever, all that Part of <HI>America,</HI> lying between the Great River
<PB N="114" REF="013102_0112_0F8EBB486F06F890"/>there, commonly called <HI>Monomack,</HI> alias <HI>Merimack</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> River, within the Space of three Miles to the Northward of the same River, called <HI>Mo∣nomack,</HI> alias <HI>Merimack,</HI> or to the Northward of any or every Part thereof, and in Length and Longitude of and within all the Breadth aforesaid, thro'out the Main Lands there, from the Atlantic or Western Sea or Ocean on the East Part, to the South Sea on the West Part.</P>
<P>THIS Deed of Sale at the Suit of the Grantees, with a Charter of Incorporation, was granted and confirmed by King CHARLES the First, the 4th Day of March 1629, wherein the Limits are exact∣ly the same with those in the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Conveyance; and the Proviso of CHARLES, that the actual Set∣tlement of the Subjects of other Christian States to determine the Extent, the same as was the Proviso in JAMES'S Grant to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Company.</P>
<P>THIS same Charter of Incorporation was adjudg∣ed void in the High Court of Chancery of <HI>England</HI> in 1684; from which the Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> in their State, &amp;c. Page 5th, take Occasion to say <Q>the Title of that Colony now solely depends on their new Charter of 1691.</Q> Nevertheless, the Right of Soil to All and every Part of the Deed of Sale aforesaid, remained indefeasible; for, only animadvert back to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Conveyance, and observe, that the Right in Fee, was by them con∣veyed to the Grantees; and trace it to King CHARLES'S Charter of Incorporation, which only vested the Grantees with Powers of Government.
<PB N="115" REF="013102_0113_0F8EBB49357A6A18"/>Though it is true, this Charter contains all the Formality necessary in the Conveyance of the Fee; yet is, so far as respects the Fee, is no more than a Duplicate of what was before granted, which neither adds nor deminisheth; and it is easy to see, that the Court of Chancery could not vacate or make Void, at most, any Thing more than those incorporate Privileges; and likewise as easily discernable that nothing more was attempted. Thus the Colony of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> still hold their Right in Fee, by Conveyance from King JAMES to the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who were their Grantors.</P>
<P>IN the next Place it may be observed, that in 1691 the Privileges of Incorporation were restor∣ed; though our Authors, in their State, &amp;c. en∣deavour to curtail the Colony of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> by construing their last Charter to extend no fur∣ther West than the East Limit of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> Their Words are these, "These Words <HI>(as far as)</HI> being in the Case of the Grant of the Crown on the Suit of the Party, in legal Construction, carry the <HI>Massachusetts Bay</HI> Colony no farther Westward than till it meets the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and much less to the Westward of it." Be these bold As∣sertions as they will, and provided it be here admit∣ted, for Argument sake, that the Powers of Juris∣diction of the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay</HI> be ever so much curtailed, yet one Proposition we can verily be assured of, viz. That it is not in the Power of King or Chancery to curtail or deprive them of their Property.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="013102_0114_0F8EBB49F4CFED90"/>
IT is to be further observed, that however our Authors may Criticise upon the gramatical or legal Construction of selected Words or Phrases; yet, a little Attention to the following real Facts, will clearly point out the Inconsistency of such Sophisms.</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, <HI>Connecticut</HI> Charter, granted by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April 1662, was bounded and extended in Length, by and with the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> first Charter, granted by King CHARLES the First, the 4th Day of March 1629, which incontestibly extended agreeable with the aforesaid discriptive Limits of the Deed of Sale from the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to Sir <HI>Henry Roswell,</HI> Sir <HI>John Young,</HI> &amp;c. and extended through the Main Land in Longitude to the South Sea on the West Part.</P>
<P>THIS Charter, as above, being nullified in the High Court of Chancery of England in 1684, and restored again in 1691, wherein the West Extent of Limit is predicated by that of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and this West Limit of <HI>Connecticut</HI> being predicated by the old Charter of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> and ex∣presly extending in Longitude to the South Sea on the West Part, exactly extends the present Char∣ter of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> with it's Powers of Jurisdiction to All, and every Part of the Limits of the old nulled Charter. This is the natural and legal Sense of the present Charter of the Colo∣ny of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> predicated on undeni∣able Facts,</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="013102_0115_0F8EBB4AAC6B5A68"/>
IN the next Place 'tis necessary to consider the Charter of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which our Authors inform should not extend West of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, in the Words following: <Q>This being a Crown Grant on the Suit and Petition of the Grantees, is to be taken most beneficially for the King. The discriptive Words, and the Intention of the Grant, will in legal Construction be satisfied by giving the Colony the same Length as the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts Bay;</HI> and it is plain, both from the Re∣cital and the saving Clause in the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Pa∣tent, on which the <HI>Massachusett</HI>'s Title was found∣ed, that the Latter cou'd not in any Sense, ex∣tend to the Westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.</Q> As this their Assertion is founded on the Hypothesis of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Charter's being predicated on that of the <HI>Massachusett's,</HI> and therefore the Arguments before exhibited on that Head, are equally Con∣clusive for the establishing the Western Extent of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> nothing more is necessary for that Pur∣pose, but a Recital of the discriptive Words of their Charter, granted subsequent to their Purchase from the Council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April, 1662, <Q>Bounded on the East by <HI>Narraganset</HI> River, commonly called <HI>Narraganset</HI> Bay, where the said River falleth into the Sea; and on the North by the Line of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Plantation; and on the South by the Sea, and in Longitude as the Line of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Colony, running from East to West: That is to say, from the said <HI>Narraganset</HI> Bay on the East, to the South Sea on the West Part.</Q> Thus it appears not
<PB N="118" REF="013102_0116_0F8EBB4B6C3D3DB8"/>only by the Demonstrations aforesaid, but from the express Words of the discriptive Limits of the Charter itself, which cannot admit of a double Meaning, (curious as our Authors be in the Art of playing with Words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal Meaning,) that it is the un∣questionable Right of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> to extend it's Western Boundary to the South Sea on the "West Part;" and in this that Colony agree, who are now challenging their Right in Fee to those Limits, and actually making Plantation, as at <HI>Susquebannah,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BY this Time, undoubtedly Queries will arise in the Mind of the Reader, What will become of the Grant to the Duke of York, if the Massachu∣sett's and Connecticut Colonies extend "to the South Sea on the West Part?" The following In∣telligence from our Authors will introduce an Answer to this Query; who, after discribing said Grant further inform, in Page 3d of the State, &amp;c. That <Q>a Fleet and Land Forces were sent to re∣move the Dutch, and put the Duke in Possession.</Q> Accordingly, on the 27th Day of August 1664, the Dutch Governor <HI>Stuyvesant,</HI> surrendered by Ca∣pitulation, all the Countries the Dutch then pos∣sessed, to King CHARLES the Second; when among other Terms it was stipulated, <Q>that all the People shall remain free Denizens, and shall enjoy their Lands, Houses, and Goods, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er they are within this Country, and dispose of them as they please.</Q> Thus, by Conquest, the King be∣came revested with his Right to the Lands conquer∣ed:
<PB N="119" REF="013102_0117_0F8EBB4E28C44398"/>for, as the King had antecedently disposed of all the Estate the Crown was possessed of in these Countries, to the Colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Massachusetts Bay;</HI> therefore, his Right now could not extend any further than the actual Conquest, which, in legal Construction, must be satisfied with, and can extend no further than the actual Possessi∣ons described in the forementioned Capitulation. A further Information is in Page 4th, <Q>To re∣move any Doubt of the Validity of the Dukes Title, either from the Want of Seisin in the Crown when it originated, or on Account of the intermediate Conquest by the Dutch, it was con∣firmed to his Royal Highness by further Let∣ters Patent, dated the 29th Day of June, 1674.</Q> That there was Want of Seisin in the Crown at the Time of first Granting, is incontestible; for, as above said, the King by antecedent Grants had di∣vested the Crown of it's Right, and by this Con∣quest became revested: So that from this, Occasion will be taken to say, that in Fact the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> was originally sounded on Conquest, and the Limits of it, as before mentioned, circumscrib∣ed by the Dutch Possessions pointed out in the Terms of Capitulation. However <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ourable this Conclusion may be thought, on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> yet, as the Crown had prior to either of the Duke's Grants, disposed of its Right to the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colonies—if it was not thus founded on Conquest, it hath no Foundation at all; and it's having any Place for Existence, is but an "Intrusion on the Rights" of those other Colonies. Furthermore, it is Mysterious and Con∣tradictory,
<PB N="120" REF="013102_0118_0F8EBB4FC98C6988"/>admitting that that Government was thus founded, to suppose the Duke could be Lord Proprietor; inasmuch as by the Conditions of Capitulation, the Fee then acquired to the Crown, passed to the Dutch Inhabitants, who then became English Subjects.</P>
<P>THE Reader is in the next Place invited to a more particular Consideration of the aforesaid dis∣puted Premises, which are bounded South on the North Line of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> and West by a Line about twenty Miles East of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, extending North ten Degrees, East till it comes al∣most opposite to <HI>Ticondaroga;</HI> thence West till it strikes on <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> thence on the East Banks of said Lake to the Forty fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, and on the North by the said Latitude, and East on the West Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. On this Tract of Country 'tis not pretended there ever was any ancient Dutch Possessions, nor any un∣der Title from <HI>New-York,</HI> except on the West Part of the Township of <HI>Pownal,</HI> situate at the South-West Corner of this Tract; and some Possessions in the Township of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> on <HI>Otter Creek,</HI> which Colonel <HI>Reed</HI> gained and maintained by Force, a∣bout three Years, and which by Force he was o∣bliged to surrender to the first Settlers, who were Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH this Tract of Land was contained in the original Grant to the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> yet, as they never made any Conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the Crown on the Surrender of that
<PB N="121" REF="013102_0119_0F8EBB50B84E69D8"/>Grant, the 7th Day of June, 1635. From which it may be objected, on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the above Conciseness in the Circumscription of the Boundaries of their Colony is too great; for, that the Grant to the Duke must hold good where the Crown, at the Time of granting, was vested with a Right to the Lands granted. In Answer, it has been argued in the preceeding Section, that it is very uncertain whether the Limits of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant included this Tract of Land, or if any, how great a Part; and that the Limits of said Grant cou'd not be ascertained—and that govern∣mental Jurisdiction, and Property cou'd not be predicated on such obsolete and uncertain Bounds. It was also demonstrated in the first Section, and will be further observed in this, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant reverted to the Crown, and that the Landholders in the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> hold under the Crown—and that, if it did not revert to the Crown, the Fee is still in the Duke, his Heirs or Assigns, and no Landholders in the Government are vested with the Fee of the Lands they pos∣sess, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Argument and Couclusion is founded on the <HI>New-York</HI> Hypothesis, exclusive of the herein mention'd Article in the Dutch Capitulation.</NOTE>. It would be too tedious as well as needless to recite the Arguments that have been offered in the three first Sections, which is humbly conceived are abundantly sussicient to Answer the aforesaid Objection, and fairly demonstrate Priority of Title to be in Favour of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> to which the curteous Reader is referred for a Con∣sideration.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="013102_0120_0F8EBB50EC35CF60"/>
As has been before observed, the Design of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant was to include the Dutch Possessions, or in other Words, that it never was valid any further than to such Possession, which by Conquest, reverted to the Crown, and no farther than these Limits, to interfere with the Charter Colonies of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> And as a Twenty Miles Line to the Eastward from <HI>Hud∣son</HI>'s River would include the most Eastern Extent of the forementioned Possessions, the Reason why such a Line was agreed to as the Boundary between the Colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-York:</HI> But, as these Possessions to the Northward of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> fell far short of this Twenty Mile Line, or were so inconsiderable and uncertain as not to come within the Capitulation Reserve, therefore, the <HI>Massa∣chusetts</HI> Colony contended with <HI>New-York</HI> for a fur∣ther Western Extent than Twenty Miles East from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River; but the restless Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> ever uneasy within it's own Boundaries, presumed unrelenting, to intrude on, and contest∣ing for the just Rights of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> by ex∣tending their Patents far to the Eastward of Twen∣ty Miles from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River; in Consequence of which the greatest Disturbances have arisen between the Inhabitants of the respective Colonies, and sun∣dry of the Conflicts so severe, that human Blood spilt in the Contests redened the Hands of the In∣truders; but finally a boundary Line was agreed to by the respective Governments in 1773, at a Twenty Miles Distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, which has since been ratified by his Majesty.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="013102_0121_0F8EBB5171CF7318"/>
IN the State of the Right, &amp;c. Page 4th, is the most extraordinary Account of Alienation of Pro∣perty that is to be found in the Annals of History. <Q>The Duke continued Proprietor and chief Go∣vernor of this Province till he ascended the Throne, when his Right merged in the Royal Authority, on his Abdication it passed to King <HI>William,</HI> his Successor, as Lord Proprietor and Royal Sovereign.</Q> That upon the Duke's ac∣cession to the Throne his Right of Government merged in the Royal Authority will not be denied; But, that his Right in Fee, consequently passed to King <HI>William</HI> as his Successor, wants greater Proof than a bare Assertion; our Authors should have explained this Matter; 'tis taken for granted they will not pretend that King <HI>William</HI> was Heir at Law to the Duke's Estate, and they mention no Conveyance from the Duke to the King, but say the "Duke's Right merged in the Royal Autho∣rity;" to suppose it is possible that Right should pass to King <HI>William,</HI> as Lord Proprietor, is so great an Absurdity that it wants a Name.</P>
<P>IN the same Page they further inform, That <Q>in the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Commissions to his several Lieutenant Governors, Major <HI>Edmond Andross</HI> on the first Day of July 1674, and Col. <HI>Thomas Dongan</HI> on the 30th Day of September 1682, among other Discriptions of the Boundaries of this Province, are expresly comprehended all the Land from the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River to the East Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay.</Q> Note, those Commissions were from the Duke before he ascend∣ed
<PB N="124" REF="013102_0122_0F8EBB5231CB2D58"/>the Throne; undoubtedly in his Commissions to his Lieutenant Governors, he had referrence to the Limits of his Grant, to determine their Boun∣daries: But after his Abdication, and the Ac∣cession of King <HI>Willaim</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> we find a Commission from their Majesty's to <HI>Henry Slaughter,</HI> to be materially different. <Q>King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by their Commission, dated the Fourth Day of January, in the First Year of their Reign, appointed <HI>Henry Slaughter</HI> to be Governor of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the Territories depending thereon in <HI>America.</HI></Q> The same Assembly (stiled our Authors) further inform, that <Q>in all subsequent Acts and Com∣missions this Colony is described by the same Words, the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the Territories depending thereon in <HI>America.</HI></Q> "No Arguments need be used to prove, for it is self evident their Majesty's had some dif∣ferent Idea of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> than what had been before described by the Duke's Commissions to his Lieutenant Governors, and a little attention to the original State of that Go∣vernment, will explain that Difference. Our Au∣thors further inform, Page 17, <Q>The <HI>Ransselaer</HI> Family are not indebted to the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> for their Estate, they continue to en∣joy it by an Act of Justice and not of Favour; it was originally a Dutch Colony of it self, grant∣ed to their Ancestors by the Dutch West-India Company, who held it as a Part of New Nether∣lands, under the States General. On the Sur∣render in 1664, their Rights were secured to
<PB N="125" REF="013102_0123_0F8EBB530B032720"/>them in common with the rest of the Inhabitants, by the before mentioned Article of Capitulation granted on the Surrender of the Country, by Col. <HI>Nichols,</HI> the Commander in Chief under the Crown, and Lieut. Governor under the Duke: the Faith of Government was pledged for their Security, and their Estates were con∣firmed under the Seal of this Colony in the Year 1685, not by meer Act of the Provincial Go∣vernor and Council, but by an express Order of King <HI>James</HI> the Second.</Q> They further inform Page 5th, <Q>so long ago as the Year 1685, King <HI>James</HI> the Second, by Letters Patent under that Seal granted to the <HI>Ransselaer</HI> Family the Manor <HI>Renselaerwick,</HI> extending from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River both on the East and West Sides Twenty-four Miles.</Q> This Manor includes the City of <HI>Albany,</HI> and ex∣tends near Twenty Miles to the Southward of it; South of which terminates the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> expressed in their Governor's Commissions, so that this Manor is included in their second Dis∣cription of Domain, viz. the Territories depending thereon, and exclusive of this Clause in the Com∣missions, antecedent to the forementioned Deter∣mination in 1764, the Governors of <HI>New-York</HI> cou'd not exercise Jurisdiction even in the Manor of <HI>Renselaerwyck,</HI> and much less to the Northward of it, as Settlements which lay Contiguous to those Limits seemed necessarily to fall under the Jurisdiction of that Government. Thus their terri∣torial Sort of Dominion hath been extended with∣out any Prescription or Limitation, agreeable to the Observation of their celebrated Judge <HI>Smith,</HI> who,
<PB N="126" REF="013102_0124_0F8EBB551AFD5128"/>speaking of that Government, said <Q>it might well be accounted <HI>unlimitted.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT may be further offered in Objection, on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> That allowing the foregoing Ar∣guments relative to the Territories, and that <HI>Ren∣selaerwyck</HI> was, before the AEra of the aforesaid De∣termination, in Fact annex'd to the Government by the territorial Clause in the Governor's Com∣missions; yet, nevertheless the Duke's Grant must be valid to the Northward of that Manor, to all the Lands it originally covered. This cannot o∣perate in Favour of <HI>New-York,</HI> for, in Addition to what has been before argued to this Purpose, the Reader is desired to observe, that King <HI>James.</HI> the Second, who was this same Duke of York, abdi∣cated the Throne in 1688, and his Estate reverted to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and this Grant became vested in the Crown, the same as though the Duke or his Grant had never had an Existance.—Nor have any of their Governor's Commissions, from <HI>Henry Slaughter,</HI> the first Governor appointed by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> down to this pre∣sent AEra, ever been predicated on, or had the least Reference to the Limits of that Grant.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Government of <HI>New-York</HI> make the great∣est Outcry against her Sister Colonies, taxing them with Intrusion, Violence and Encroachment; and, at the same Time, are flagrantly more guilty of
<PB N="127" REF="013102_0125_0F8EBB55F0151500"/>the same avaricious, unjust, and hostile Wick∣edness than all the rest of English <HI>America:</HI> Their capricious Land-Jobbers have a surprising Faculty in carrying their Points; at the same Time, they are encroaching upon their Neighbours, provided they meet with Opposition, they will cry out in the most exagerating Exclamations, Violence, Ri∣ot, Treason, &amp;c. and at the same Time, not he∣sitate to trample upon his Majesty's Authority, (the Particulars of which may be seen in the pre∣ceding Narrative) They are great Advocates for Law, Order, and <HI>good</HI> Government; these are their <HI>Horns of Iron, and with them do they push the Poor and Needy, when they get them into their Net. Their Way is as the Way of a Serpent upon a Rock,</HI> and it is difficult <HI>to trace their Footsteps:</HI> They com∣plain of the lawless, factious, and riotous Con∣duct of the Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> yet know, that they themselves are the moving Cause of all the Disturbances they complain of: It is in∣credible to suppose a Collection of Farmers ex∣posed to the perpetual Fatigues, and laborious Toils of cultivating a Wilderness Country, should under a just Administration of Law, become "a Confederacy of Insurgents:" Was it only, that natural Presumption being so much in Favour of those Inhabitants, it is humbly conceived, that all wise and unprejudiced Persons will, at least suspend their Judgments concerning them, 'till the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can clearly evince, that these Peo∣ple are in reality, without Cause, tumultuous, disorderly, &amp;c. And, inasmuch as the Facts of this Controversy is so fully set forth in the preceding
<PB N="128" REF="013102_0126_0F8EBB56C491EFE8"/>Narrative of this Treatise, the Reader is thereto refered for a clearer Exhibition.</P>
<P>OUR Authors, in Order to maintain their Claim to the Lands in Contest, and if possible, to include it within One of the descriptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> tell us many strange Things about the Colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Massachu∣setts:</HI> That <HI>Connecticut.</HI> "in legal Construction" should not have extended to the Westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Ri∣ver, and that their Settlements West of that River were an Intrusion on the Right of the Colony of <HI>New-York;</HI> yet, nevertheless for Peace sake, and rather than contest with "a powerful Neighbour," they settled with that Colony at twenty Miles dis∣tance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River.</P>
<P>THEY further inform, that <Q>the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Claim stands by no Means in so respectable a Light as that of <HI>Connecticut,</HI></Q> and in legal Con∣struction, should extend <Q>no further Westward than 'till it meets the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and much less to the Westward of it.</Q> Our Authors being Men of great Learning and Sagacity; soon extended their antient Right of Jurisdiction over such Part of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Colony as lay to the Westward from <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and this their Scheme in stop∣ping the Western Extension of that Colony where it meets <HI>Connecticut,</HI> may be reckoned as one a∣mong the greatest of their political Atchievements. "And it is worthy a Remark," that had the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts</HI> Colony extended West to the South Sea,
<PB N="129" REF="013102_0127_0F8EBB5786B4DBA0"/>it could not have met <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but must have extended parallel with it, in the same Direc∣tion.</P>
<P>To give this pleasing Scheme some Kind of Co∣lour, they argue the Nullity of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> first Charter, and introduce the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant as the oldest Title, Page 5th, <Q>The <HI>Mas∣sachusetts</HI> Charter was vacated, and the Title of that Colony now solely depends on their Char∣ter of 1691.</Q></P>
<P>YET they allow, that that Colony obtained the Right of Soil from the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that the Charter of King <HI>Charles</HI> dated the 4th Day of March 1628-9, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the Charter spoken of as vacated, which was done as has been before largely treated of, in 1684.</NOTE> vested them with Powers of Government, (it's needless to animad∣vert on these strange Accounts) however, after they have charmed their Imaginations with the fruitless Idea of extending their antient Right to all that Part of the Bay Province West of <HI>Connec∣ticut</HI> River, they complain bitterly of the En∣croachments of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> Page 8th. <Q>Un∣der Circumstances so favourable to the Rights of this Colony, we have great Reason to com∣plain of the unwarrantable Encroachments un∣der the Authority of the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> by which a valuable Tract extending from <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, within Twen∣ty Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, has been wrested from us.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="013102_0128_0F8EBB5831F87330"/>
<Q>THEIR Conduct seems the more inexcusable, as they must have known that such Encroach∣ments were not only disrespectful to his Majes∣ty's Authority, and big with great Mischiefs and Disorders, but were highly injurious to pri∣vate Property, great Part of these Lands having antiently been granted to his Majesty's Subjects under the great Seal of this Colony.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to recite their old Grants, which they tell us <Q>cover the Country the whole Breadth of the <HI>Massachusett</HI>'s Claim:</Q> The Ma∣nor of <HI>Renselaerwyck,</HI> granted in 1685, and extend∣ing 24 Miles each Side, from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River; and <HI>Westonhook,</HI> in 1705, which extends about 30 Miles from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River; and <HI>Hoosick,</HI> in 1685, which extends about 30 Miles from the River. It seems to have been a political, and universal Principle with the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to begin their Patents within the Twenty Mile Line, and extend them Eastward of it, that by this Means they might have Opportunity to encroach on, and jockey their neighbouring Colonies, more or less, out of their Lands, as subsequent Policy, Intrigue and Power, would render practicable.</P>
<P>THAT Government, thus extended their Patent into <HI>Connecticut,</HI> One in particular, into the Town∣ship of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> and it has ever been their Prac∣tice to wrangle till they find by Experience, that neither by Sophistry, Law, or Hostility, they can maintain their exorbitant Claims, and then capitu∣late on as good Terms as they can; and conclude
<PB N="131" REF="013102_0129_0F8EBB58EA985BA0"/>with branding their Competitors with Dishonesty, Encroachment and many hard Names, and don't scruple to impeach their Governmental Authority, (as in the Case just recited of the Massachusetts-Bay) with being Disrespectful to his Majesty's Authority, and guilty of great Mischiefs and Dis∣orders; although the Authority of their own Go∣vernment, by their unjust, avaricious Encroach∣ments on the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> even to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, laid the Foundation of those Disorders, and they might have added Blood-shed; yet their Assembly have the Impudence to Palm it all upon the Au∣thority of the Massachusetts.</P>
<P>THE Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> are so happy as to be almost exempted from any <HI>New-York</HI> Claims, by Patents from that Government prior to their's; the aforesaid <HI>Hoosick</HI> and <HI>Wallumscock</HI> Patents being the only ones of this Nature, the former includes about one Qaurter of the Town∣ship of <HI>Pownal,</HI> on which Part were about four Settlers, when it was granted by <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> This Township is bounded Southerly by the North Line of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and extends West as far as the <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Colonies; the latter, i. e. <HI>Wallumscock</HI> Patent, was granted un∣der the common Seal of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> the 15th Day of June, 1739. This Patent is said to interfere with the Township of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and it is Matter of Dispute, whether in it's first Locati∣on, it included more than about 30 or 40 Acres within that Town, tho' it seems the Patent by it's discriptive Limits, extends further into the Town,
<PB N="132" REF="013102_0130_0F8EBB5FB2FE88F0"/>and the Patentees produce a Map corresponding with those Limits: However, an Indian, aged Fif∣ty-Nine, who was Pilot to the Party that located this Grant, informs of a certain Monument they then erected, where they broke a Bottle, &amp;c. for their Eastern Bounds. "And it is worthy a Remark," that this Indian happens to be exactly of the same Age with <HI>Ebenezer Cole,</HI> one of our Author's prin∣cipal Deponants. This Monument is well known by the <HI>Bennington</HI> People, and is on the Western Edge of the Town; and there has never been a Discovery of any Lines of the Survey of that Lo∣cation to the Eastward of this Monument. The many Circumstances of this Nature, amount to al∣most a Certainty, that the Patentees never made any actual Location further interfering with <HI>Ben∣nington,</HI> than as aforesaid; notwithstanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one Eighth Part of the Town; which Lands are exceeding good in Nature, and are settled wholly under the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Title, by industrious Farmers, who form a Wilderness State, have culti∣vated and brought the most of it under good im∣provements, with many valuable Houses, Barns and Orchards; some of them annually mowing at least 80 Tons of Hay, and raise other Produce of the Country in Proportion. Not the least Im∣provements or Possessions were ever made in that Town, except by these Inhabitants; neither had they the least Knowledge of a Pretence of any <HI>New-York</HI> Patents extending there till several Years af∣ter they had settled the Land. As has been be∣fore observed, there was about four Settlers on that
<PB N="133" REF="013102_0131_0F8EBB6155CA1060"/>Part of <HI>Hoosick</HI> Patent, included in the Township of <HI>Pownal,</HI> when it was granted; and if the Au∣thor has a right Information, there has not been any more Settlements made under the <HI>New-York</HI> Title since, though there hath sundry Families set∣tled on the Premises, included as aforesaid, under the <HI>New-Hamshire</HI> Title.</P>
<P>As the State and Circumstances of such Part of the Townships aforesaid, as are included in the old Patents, are materially different, in many Respects, from the Circumstances of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants in general; it will therefore be necessary that this Matter have a particular Consideration; and that none of the aforesaid Arguments be considered in this Case but what are truly applicable: and in this Review of the Case, it will be admitted, that the old <HI>Wallumscock</HI> Patent includes such Part of <HI>Bennington,</HI> as the Plan the Patentees exhibit doth contain.</P>
<P>IT is taken for granted that the Royal Determin∣ation of the boundary Line in 1764 cou'd not ex∣tend the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> antecedent to the Date of that Order, which was a Manifestation of Royal Power, and which was the sole Cause of that Extention; therefore, at the Time the Govern∣ment of <HI>New-York</HI> granted the forementioned old Patents, they could have no greater Authority for so doing than what they were then in Fact possessed of: It remains therefore to be considered, whether the Patents from the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> are va∣lid or not, so far as they interfere with the Town∣ships
<PB N="134" REF="013102_0132_0F8EBB646A9A24A8"/>of <HI>Bennington</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And Firstly, it has been proved that the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> as discribed in their Governor's Commissions, doth not extend so far North as the City of <HI>Albany;</HI> there∣fore, the Northern Tracts of Country which these Patents of <HI>Hoosick</HI> and <HI>Wallumscock</HI> cover, must be considered as belonging to their second Sort of Domain, (to wit) the Territories. It has also been shewn, that these Territories are not circumscribed to any particular Limits, but that they were origi∣nally meant to include some ancient Grants that were Independent of the Province and adjoining Settlements, on Extra-provincial Lands: probably that Government may have Authority to grant Land to the West and North-West, where it is in∣disputably unappropriated, and where the Claim of none other Government could interfere: But it will be insisted upon, on the Part of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers, which are included in the afore∣said old Patents, that the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> had no Right to extend any of their Patents to the Eastward of a Line equivalent to that which con∣stitutes the Bounds between <HI>New-York</HI> and the Co∣lonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Massachusetts:</HI> This Li∣mit was ever thought by the People in general of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> as well as those of the ad∣jacent Colonies, to be the Eastern Boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> until the Aera of the late Determination, which extended it to the River <HI>Connecticut:</HI> and la∣bouring Men that support the World of Mankind, are obliged to form their Judgments of the Juris∣diction of Government's by the common received Opinions of Mankind they are conversant with;
<PB N="135" REF="013102_0133_0F8EBAD2AB05A430"/>and even admitting they make an erroneous Judg∣ment, yet, in the present Case, as the Lands were of but little Value, exclusive of their Toil and Culti∣vation; and as the Farmers in Reality uphold the State, it is therefore not only incumbent on the Laws, but on the Policy of the State to defend them in Cases of this Nature—it must be admitted that where the Limits of Governments are clearly ascertained and notoriously known, that a Farmer trespassing in this Manner on another's Property, must bear the Loss: But, provided a Country of People be generally under a Deception as to Mat∣ters of Jurisdiction, and purchase Land and make great Improvements, and all on a mistaken Foot∣ing, Men in such Circumstances should be consi∣dered in the most favourable Light. For, as not only Individuals, but the Country about them were in the same Manner deceived, and therefore, at the Time of purchasing and Settlement, they were ut∣terly destitute of the Means of Knowledge; yet, however, it is not conceded to, that those Farmers on whose Account the present Arguments are ex∣hibited, are under a Deception about this Matter; for of all Sorts of governmental Jurisdiction, the <HI>New-York</HI> Territorial was the weakest, loosest and most vague; it was rather occasional and political, than positive, and in it's own Nature almost or quite incapable of being extended faster than Settlements were actually carried on, or at most the Lands ex∣posed to this territorial Jurisdiction, should not be patented faster than his Majesty's Subjects are dis∣posed forthwith to settle. The Necessity of grant∣ing so fast may be pleaded on Account of Order—the
<PB N="136" REF="013102_0134_0F8EBB68D2BB8840"/>Policy of Government may demand it; other∣wise an occasional Jurisdiction would be altogether unable to abilitate the Government to make Con∣veyance of the Right in Fee; although it is indis∣putable that such a Jurisdiction in Matters of meer Government, is to all Intents and Purposes, equal to positive Jurisdiction; but with Respect to hav∣ing a Power to convey the Fee of Lands, is Matter of Doubt: But thus much with Propriety may be inferred, that a Title so weak and impotent should not claim Superiority over the least Conception of Title whatever; a meer Possession is of itself abun∣dantly sufficient to maintain the Right in the Pos∣sessor, and on a judicious Tryal at common Law, (cou'd such an One be had) would be judged Pa∣ramount to it.</P>
<P>There is another Consideration that must totally extinguish and obliterate all possible remaining Idea of Right, that the Patentees of <HI>Wallumscock</HI> may be supposed to have to the said Tract of Land includ∣ed in the Limits of the Township of <HI>Bennington.</HI> Only advert to the Date of that Patent, which is on the 15th Day of June, 1739, and compare it with the Time of the Commencement of the Set∣tlement of <HI>Bennington,</HI> which was in the Spring of the Year 1760, and there will be found to be 21 Years, from the Date of this Patent, to the begin∣ning of the Settlement under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI>—in all this Time there was not the least Settlement or Possession made in the Premises; although the ex∣press Condition of the Patent was, that it should be settled in three Years from the Time of granting.
<PB N="137" REF="013102_0135_0F8EBB6982919BA8"/>Possibly in all that Time the Patentees might have got some Dutch Tenants on some Western Part of the Patent, which, with the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> may be denominated a Fulfilment of the Condition of Settlement; many large Tracts hav∣ing been patented, some since, and others longer ago than that <HI>Wallumscock,</HI> which are yet mostly a howling Wilderness. This Practice of the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> in extending their Patents to the Eastward of a Twenty Mile Line from <HI>Hud∣son</HI>'s River, hath ever been considered as a disinge∣nious and designing Policy in that Government; thereby to lay a Foundation for intruding on the Rights of their neighbouring Colonies; and has been attended with many disagreeable Consequen∣ces, as has been before observed. And as that Government have given up their exorbitant Claims where they interfered with the Right of the <HI>Massa∣chusetts,</HI> it would undoubtedly be their wisest Way to do the same with Respect to such Claims as in∣terfere with the Right granted under the great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> and instead of treating the People that have settled those Lands under that Title, as Rioters and Felons; to exercise that Justice and Humanity towards them, which becometh Governors, to the governed.</P>
<P>IT remains still, that there be a summary View exhibited, relative to the Rule of Right which should take Place with Respect to the Settlers un∣der each Government, that are settled on such Part of the forementioned Patents as are included in the Townships of <HI>Bennington</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And al∣though
<PB N="138" REF="013102_0136_0F8EBB6A2AAC2220"/>Superiority of Title is in Favour of those under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> nevertheless, as the Line of Jurisdiction, in those Times of granting and Settle∣ment, was not expresly ascertained or known.—Under these Circumstances, it would not only be bad State-policy, but great Inhumanity and Injus∣tice to the Subject; for either the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> to dispossess them, let them have settled under the Title of either; for Titles liable to so much Dispute and Uncertainty as both must be confessed to be (though One may have much the Preference of the Other) are not sufficient to oust the Possessor, inasmuch as both challenge a legal Right; therefore, either Title, sealed and confirmed with the Sweat and Toil of the Farmer is abundantly paramount to the Other.</P>
<P>OUR Authors, in their Appendix, Page 19th, mis-represent the Plea of the <HI>Bennington</HI> People, in saying, <Q>To reason on their own Principles, if Equity confirmed the Claims of Others under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> on Account of Priority of in∣terfering Grants, it would have afforded a fatal Plea against the People of <HI>Bennington;</HI> because they ought then themselves to have yielded up all the Lands which are covered by more anti∣ent Patents.</Q> The People of <HI>Bennington,</HI> or ra∣ther the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> have e∣ver insisted, that at the Time the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> granted those Lands, they had good Right so to do; but that <HI>New-York</HI> had not. This Matter is illustrated and proved by many Argu∣ments, and real Facts, in this Treatise, particularly
<PB N="139" REF="013102_0137_0F8EBB6AF1647090"/>in the 2d and 3d Sections, to which the Reader is referred. 'Tis true, provided the <HI>Bennington</HI> Peo∣ple had no further Considerations in the Matter of Title, but the Priority of interfering Grants—according to this Method of arguing, they ought to yield up such Part of that Town as interferes with <HI>Wallumscock</HI> Patent; but the Consideration of Settlement is undoubtedly, with the many other Matters, material to be considered, as argued afore∣said.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through with the Remarks on the <HI>New-York</HI> Pamphlet, so far as immediately respects the Title of those Lands which has been the Prin∣cipal Cause of the Publication of this Treatise—shall nextly proceed to detect some notorious and dishonorable Mis-representations contained in the Pamphlet aforesaid, particularly in the Appendix. In this brief Review, it would be too tedious, as well as needless, to trace the Authors through all their disguised and fictitious Representations, and intricate Windings. Shall therefore pass on with noteing such of their Exhibitions as are the most cruelly fallacious; among which the Story of the Extention of the Township of <HI>Bennington,</HI> merely by a Vote of the Inhabitants, at a Town Meeting, to the Westward from where it was intended to be granted, and within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, is the most flagrantly opprobrious. The Story may be seen recorded in the 4th Page of their Appendix. <Q>The Grantees of the Township
<PB N="140" REF="013102_0138_0F8EBB6BCB10FE18"/>of <HI>Bennington,</HI> discovered that the Situation of the Tract according to the Intention of the Grant, would be both inconvenient and unprofitable, as it included a large Proportion of Mountain; and they therefore, by no better Authority than a Vote of their Town Meeting, presumed to ex∣tend it to the Westward, within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River.</Q></P>
<P>As this Representation in All and every Part is entirely groundless, and no Pretence of Proof to support it, but is the meer calumnious Aspersion of those who have an implacable Hatred to the <HI>Ben∣nington</HI> People, a ositive Denial of the Facts al∣ledged, would be a sufficient Refutation of those Facts. Nevertheless, as the Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> have made a principal Engine of this infamous Story of their own Creation, to destroy the good Character of the People aforesaid, by representing them to the Government at Home as the vilest of In∣surgents and Out-Laws—and inasmuch as the Facts alledged are capable of Dis-proof by mathematical Certainty, and sundry Demonstrations of this Sort having been actually made, (though not with a View of disproving this Calumny, as it had not then been published,) by Admensurations of the Distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, to the Westerly Line of <HI>Bennington,</HI> all of which agree that it is at least Twenty Miles. Mr. <HI>Samuel Robinson</HI> for once made an actual Mensuration of that Distance, and found it to be Twenty Miles and Thirty-five Chains; his Affidavit and Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Wood's,</HI> together with an attested Copy of the Survey of that Town
<PB N="141" REF="013102_0139_0F8EBB6C84C58308"/>by Mr. <HI>Matthew Clesson,</HI> the Surveyor, is thought Expedient to transcribe in it's following Order, which will abundantly serve to exculpate the Peo∣ple of <HI>Bennington</HI> from that Odium wherewith they have been branded. The Author is furthermore especially directed by the Inhabitants of that Town, to <Q>request the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> to vindicate what their Assembly have before alledged, by another accurate Mensuration of the Distance from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, to the Wes∣terly Line of <HI>Bennington;</HI> and further notify that Assembly, that as omnipotent as they may con∣ceive themselves to be, they must nevertheless recede from the Calumny wherewith they have abused the Inhabitants of that Town, and do public Penance for the same, or continue under the Resentment of those Inhabitans:</Q> Which take an additional Affront at the ill Usage, inas∣much as our Opponents tell us Page 3d, it is to <Q>be transmitted for the Information of the Go∣vernment at Home;</Q> and further inform that it was to guard against the Impositions which from the Want of Candor, they were apprehensive the said Settlers, who <Q>spared no Art of Act of Vio∣lence,</Q> would by their Agents deceive the Go∣vernment at Home, and therefore they had un∣dertaken to transmit a Narrative of those Settler's Proceedings, for the Information of that Govern∣ment. It seems the said Assembly fully resolved that the Settlers and Agents from the Want of Candor, would endeavour artfully to deceive, &amp;c. and that themselves were as fully resolved to over match them in a Game of that Sort, being greater
<PB N="142" REF="013102_0140_0F8EBB6D44061338"/>Practitioners than Peasants: But artful as they are, they made a fatal Mistake in advancing for Matter of Fact that which in its own Nature is incapable of Proof, and what has been disprov'd by Evi∣dence of a mathematical Nature, and capable of further Dis-proof by actual Mensuration. It is no Ways marvellous that those Gentlemen which go∣vern in that Assembly have an Antipathy against the Inhabitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> who have had a great Share in defeating them in obtaining Possession of the Country of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants: It seems they are no insensible of their Merit, for, say they, <Q>it is to this Township erected by a Charter in itself void, and so greatly abused, that we are to ascribe all the Opposition which has since been given to the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York.</HI></Q> It is evident that these Gentemen have an evil Eye upon <HI>Bennington</HI> Inhabitants; for, when they mention the Opposition to their Juris∣diction, they take Care to repeat the aforesaid groundless Aspersion, by adding these Words, <Q>erected by a Charter in itself void, and so great∣ly abused.</Q> They still proceed upon this their favourite Topic, and draw particular Infer∣rences from it to their advantage, <Q>for by chang∣ing the Situation of <HI>Bennington,</HI> it is made to comprehend a large Part of <HI>Wallumscock,</HI> which was granted under the Seal of this Pro∣vince so early as the Year 1739.</Q> This their scandalous Assertion is twice repeated in Page 8th. One of the Passages is as follows: <Q>Mr. <HI>Ingersoll,</HI> one of the most eminent Counsel in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Selvester</HI> of <HI>Albany,</HI> were concerned for
<PB N="143" REF="013102_0141_0F8EBB6DEBDBAD28"/>the Defendants. When these Gentlemen found <HI>Breakenridge's</HI> Farm to be within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, and greatly to the Westward of what the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> had ad∣mitted to be the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-York</HI>—they told him that it was impossible to set up any Prin∣ciple for his Defence. Accordingly, when his Case was brought to Tryal, he refused to confess the Lease, Entry and Ousture, agreeable to the Rule, and the Plaintiff being Non-suited, obtained Judg∣ment in the succeeding July Term, against the cas∣ual Ejector.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is far from being the true State of the Case. Sundry Causes which had been tried, were determined against the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI> perceived it was expending Money to no Purpose, to maintain a Suit at Law against the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees, as they had such a Combination of Interest with the Judg∣es, Part of which were interested in the <HI>New-York</HI> subsequent Patents, which interfered with the Grants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> though not in those on Tryal. This, with many other Things too te∣dious to particularize, was the Cause why Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI> would not defend the aforesaid Suit in Tryal; but there as not a Word said, (as he in∣forms me) between him and his said Attornies, a∣bout his Farm's being within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River; nor is it likely never such a Thing was mentioned in <HI>Albany</HI> County; the contrary be∣ing so well known. Undoubtedly, this was wrote "for the Information of Government at Home,"
<PB N="144" REF="013102_0142_0F8EBB6EC6C77D28"/>thinking the Fallacy would not there be detected, it being at so great a Distance.</P>
<P>OUR Authors, P. 10th, after giving a Narrative of a riotous and tumultuous Outrage, committed by the Inhabitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> for which Pro∣clamation had issued from the Earl of <HI>Dunmore,</HI> a∣gainst the principal Authors of the Disturbance "which could not be brought to Justice," then they introduce a particular Charge against Mr. <HI>Breakenridge,</HI> which is entirely destitute of Founda∣tion, viz. That he was One of the principal Rioters. To this they join the former Calumny of the West∣ward Extention of <HI>Bennington,</HI> <Q>by a Vote of their Town Meeting;</Q> and add to both these, the groundless Story of Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI>'s Council's Inability to set up any Principle in his Defence, by Reason of his being seated <Q>within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River.</Q> All these Fictions blended together, make considerable of a Figure, in their own Words, <Q><HI>James Breakenridge</HI> and <HI>Isaiab Carpenter,</HI> were Two of the most inexcusa∣ble of all the Offenders: the first had seated him∣self within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, where he knew it was impossible, on their own Principles, that he could be protected by the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claim, he had declined a fair Tryal, and suffered Judgment by Default.</Q> With Respect to Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI>'s being active in any Expeditions (the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> denominate Riots, Mobs, Felony, &amp;c.) it is well known thro' the Country of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, he has not. In the 18th and 19th Pages of the Appen∣dix,
<PB N="145" REF="013102_0143_0F8EBB6F87ED7310"/>they repeat their former Aspersion against the Inhabitants of <HI>Bennington</HI> in the most virulent and emphatical Language—<Q>And what is still more shameful, they contend, they arm, they sight, for Lands, as a Part of <HI>Bennington,</HI> which lies with∣in Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, and which the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> never claim∣ed, but admitted to be beyond their Jurisdicti∣on.</Q></P>
<P>AS THERE can be no Doubt but these Gentlemen really wish these things to be true, and having so frequently repeated them as being so, it is conjec∣tured they by this Time begin to believe them, or at least think others may; but that the imparti∣al Reader may have the real Truth of the Matter, the following Evidence is exhibited.</P>

<P>IT may now be requisite to give the Reader to understand, that although no Part of the Town∣ship of <HI>Bennington</HI> interferes with a Twenty Mile Line from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River; yet, it is probable some other of the Westerly Tear of Townships may in some Places, and in Others not approach it by a considerable Distance, which may be easily under∣stood by the Windings of the River.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants are bounded West on a Line commencing at the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> North-West old Corner, extending North ten Degrees, East till it reaches almost opposite to <HI>Ticondaroga,</HI> then extending West to the Lake. It is beyond Dispute, considering the Course and Windings of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, that there is as much or more Land included in the old supposed Government of <HI>New-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> by this Division, as would be by extending a
<PB N="149" REF="013102_0147_0F8EBB726E1EA400"/>Twenty Mile Line exactly parrallel with the River; it is also to be observed, that where those Grants, as above, extend West from this Line to meet the Lake, <HI>Hudson's</HI> River is at least Forty Miles to the Westward.—Therefore, upon this Hypothesis, it may well be concluded, that, al∣though some Towns may interfere with a Twenty Mile Line from the River, yet the Proprietors have nevertheless equal Right to those Lands with them whose Townships do not interfere with that Line. Undoubtedly, against the Colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> this was the Case; that in some Instances <HI>New-York</HI> lost Land by the Windings of the River, in others it gained it so as to make it about equivalent to a Breadth Twenty Miles East from the River; had the Line commenced at that Distance from the River, and extended Equidistant to it, which would be a Line Difficult to ascertain, and perpetuate.</P>

THAT some Time in the Month of October 1771, We was in Company together in the West∣erly Part of <HI>Rupourt,</HI> a Township of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, and we perceived there was a Controversy between the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers of that Township, and sundry Persons that had newly come to that Place, with Axes and Saws, and other Farmery Instruments, to begin a new Settlement near the West Line of said Town, and within the Limits of the same, under subsequent Patents, under the Grant of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> which laped on the Township afore∣said: And sundry of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers of that Town were gathered together to the Num∣ber of about Nine, including <HI>Ethan Allen,</HI> and <HI>Remember Baker,</HI> which was not Inhabitants of said Town; this Number of Persons went to warn off Two Men, whose Names were <HI>Todd,</HI> that was then at work on a Lot of Land laid out to <HI>Robert Cochran</HI> in said <HI>Rupourt,</HI> and on the same Piece, where said <HI>Cochran</HI> had partly cleared before, and had in his Possession: and we the Deponents went with the Party, having a Curiosity to see the E∣vent, for we were informed that the Two En∣croachers, viz. the <HI>Todds,</HI> had bid a Challenge a∣gainst the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers, and that they were provided with Arms, and had threatened the Life of the said <HI>Cochran,</HI> and claimed the same Land by a subsequent Patent from the Governor of <HI>New-York:</HI> So the Party came to where the Two Persons above named were at work, clear∣ing Land, and warned them, to forthwith go off from the Premises, and they did accordingly.
<PB N="151" REF="013102_0149_0F8EBB7405FF3F70"/>And we found it true that the Two Encroachers was well furnished with Fire-Arms, and so was the Party of Nine Men that went to dispossess them; expecting there would be near or quite as many to oppose them, but there was no Pretence of using Fire-Arms on either Side. After this, the Party of Nine Men went a little further, where another Person had began to build a Log-House on a Lot of Land belonging to a <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grantee in said Town; the Logs were laid, and the Rafters fixed thereon for the Roof; the Per∣son's Name that was building the same, was <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> the Party aforesaid warned him off the Land; accordingly he departed the Town, but tarried to see the Logs he had collected together, pulled down, and laid in Four Heaps by the Par∣ty, and burned with Fire. After this, the Party advanced a little further, where one <HI>Reid</HI> had be∣gan a small Improvement on a Piece of Land in the Town of <HI>Pollite,</HI> his Claim being also under <HI>New-York,</HI> on a subsequent Grant, where was a poor Shelter, four Crotches being drove into the Ground, and a Pole laid thereon, and Boughs ad∣ded to the heap in Lieu of a Roof: This shiftless Fa∣brick was also consumed by Fire by the same Par∣ty; and we the Deponents, were Eye-witnesses of the Fact before related; and directly after this, the Party dispersed: But there was no Family dis∣possessed in the whole Affair, nor was there any that had moved on the Premises under Title from <HI>New-York.</HI> And further the Deponents say not.

<HEAD><HI>The Deposition of</HI> James Henderson <HI>and</HI> David Bri∣dea, <HI>is as follows:</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT, on or about the 19th Day of June, 1773. we arrived from <HI>Scotland</HI> at <HI>New-York</HI>—soon after
<PB N="153" REF="013102_0151_0F8EBB74D99846D0"/>our Arrival, we met with Col. <HI>Reid,</HI> in <HI>New-York,</HI> who invited us to settle under him in the County of <HI>Charlette,</HI> on Lands which he said he owned in that County. We being Strangers to the Coun∣try, and not knowing there was any Dispute or Controversy about Land in America, thought best to accept of his Offer; and accordingly agreed to go with him, on the following Terms, viz. That we should have a Lease of our Land forever, with the first seven Years free from Rent, and after that, Six Pence per Acre yearly, and to deliver to him at his Mill or Mills, the Tenth Part of our Grain yearly, and not to cut any Timber, save what the clearing our Lands required. On the aforesaid Agreement we set out from <HI>New-York,</HI> with said <HI>Reid,</HI> and when we arrived at Fort <HI>Miller,</HI> we hear'd those Lands that we agreed for, were in Dis∣pute; on which we went to said <HI>Reid,</HI> and ac∣quainted him, that if his Lands were in Dispute, we rather chose to turn back, than to go any fur∣ther; but he affirmed to us, that his Land was not in Dispute, and that he would put us in peaceable Possession, and protect us there. On this Encour∣agement we went forward as far as Fort <HI>George,</HI> where we heard the News of the Dispute again con∣firmed to us; on which some of our Company would have turned back, but Col. <HI>Reid</HI> refused to let them go, assuring us that the Lands was not in any Contest, and that he would compel us to go forward. After this we went to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> where we understood that the Land to which we were going, was granted to the Settlers that were on it by the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and that they
<PB N="154" REF="013102_0152_0F8EBB7571603688"/>would not give up their Title, it being antecedent to <HI>New-York</HI> Patents. After hearing that we should have Trouble, we absolutely refused to go any further, telling Col. <HI>Reid</HI> that we did not come to <HI>America</HI> to fight for any Man's Title, nor to take away any Man's Property, and desired we might go back to <HI>New-York;</HI> but he refused, al∣ledging that we should fulfil our Agreement, and, that there was a Parcel of <HI>Yankies,</HI> or <HI>New-England</HI> Men, settled all over America, without any Right or Title to their Lands, and he would put us in Possession, and defend us there. After this, he brought us to the Mouth of <HI>Otter Creek,</HI> and then he ordered every Man to load his Gun; but I, viz. <HI>James Henderson,</HI> refused to load mine. Next Morning, at the Falls of said <HI>Creek,</HI> he ask'd me where my Firelock was? I replied, it was in the Battoe. Ay! Damn you! said he, you dare not load your Firelock—you will make a bad Soldier. After this we went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> a Town above the Falls, where we found large Improvements made, and the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI>'s actually in Possessi∣on with their Families, which Families said <HI>Reid</HI> turned out, and put us, with the Rest of our Com∣pany, in their Place—then he said, there was no further Danger, and went back and left us to keep Possession of those Houses and Improvements. Soon after this, came a large Number of armed Men which stiled themselves the <HI>Green-Mountain-Boys,</HI> and they demanded of us if we were <HI>Reid</HI>'s Settlers? We replied that we were. Then they informed us that their Business was to dispos∣sess us, alledging that those Lands were antecedent∣ly
<PB N="155" REF="013102_0153_0F8EBB764CE32220"/>granted to them by the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and that they would keep Possession of them 'till his Majesty's Pleasure was further known, Then they ordered our Goods and Effects to be ta∣ken out of the Houses, that none of them should be hurt, which was done; and then they demolish∣ed and burned the Houses, which were made with large Logs, but nothing of our Houshold Goods were burned. Next Day they pulled down a Grist Mill of said <HI>Reid</HI>'s, and there was a small Stack of Hay burned; which they said accidentally took Fire; and that if they could find out that any of their Men put Fire to it, they should pay for the Hay; for, they said, they did not approve that any of the Effects of the Earth should be de∣stroyed. Their Horses likewise destroyed some of the Wheat and Corn, but they did not otherways abuse our Persons, Effects or Families; neither did they exclaim against governmental Authority, but con∣stantly affirmed that they would maintain their Pro∣perty, and defend it from the Incursion of Col. <HI>Ried,</HI> or any other Claims from <HI>New-York,</HI> until his Majesty's Pleasure should be further known.

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Authors in the Twenty Seventh and fi∣nishing Page of their Narrative, discover great Invention and Subtilty, who after giving an Ac∣count of the unfortunate Circumstances of the Town of <HI>Hinsdale</HI> which has, say they, <Q>been taken up by a Royal Mandamus.</Q> This Town∣ship had first been granted by the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> and upon the Settlement of the Boundary-Line between the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in 1739, it fell within the latter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the In∣habitants and Proprietors, who in Addition to their Title, had also the Indian Right. This Township, by the Determination of the Boundary Line between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> fell within the Jurisdiction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <HI>Howard,</HI> after it had been settled about Seventy Years. The Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> in Order to screen their Government from the Imputation of the Blame justly due to so reprehensible a Conduct, endeavour to palm it on the Government at Home, see Page Sixth, with Respect to <Q><HI>Hinsdale,</HI> a Township in the South East Corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> County: Even this is not to be ascribed to our Government, it pro∣ceeded from a much greater, and the highest Authority: A Mandamus was produced from the Crown, on the Report of the Board of Trade, and by the Advice of the Privy Coun∣cil, which vested the Grantee with a Right of Election, an Act decisive in itself, and super∣ceding
<PB N="158" REF="013102_0156_0F8EBB7B18A9CC08"/>the Agency of the Governor and Coun∣cil here, and the usual Forms.</Q> A very Ex∣traordinary Representation! The Nature of a Roy∣al Mandamus is diametrically opposite to this Interpretation: The Right of Election in the Grantees, is restricted entirely to Crown Lands which are unapropriated; in such Lands, the Gran∣tee has a Right of Election, and common Sense may teach, that neither a Mandamus or any o∣ther Crown Grant can subvert the Property which the Subject holds under the Crown by Prior Grants; and, though there be ever so many Al∣terations in the Jurisdiction, sundry of which have perplexed the Town of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> yet this should have no Effect on the Property of the Subjects.—These Grantees are likewise withheld from inter∣fereing on the Right of the Indian Subjects.—Yet, it seems Col. <HI>Howard</HI> had the Vanity to lo∣cate his Mandamus on the old Plantation of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> which was firstly appropriated by a Pur∣chase from the <HI>Indians,</HI> secondly, by a Grant from the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> and thirdly, by the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and fourthly, by an uninterupted Possession and Occupancy about Seventy Years.</P>
<P>THE Subterfuge the Gentlemen make Use of, to rid their Government from Dishonour, in making this last Grant of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> is very extra∣ordinary; it seems not well calculated <Q>to be transmitted for the Information of the Govern∣ment at <HI>Home!</HI></Q> who are undoubtedly compe∣tent Judges of their own Mandamus's, and no
<PB N="159" REF="013102_0157_0F8EBB7BEE0F6D78"/>Doubt will easily discern their Last Error to be worse than the First. Such preposterous grant∣ing of Lands, is Criminally injurious to the Sub∣ject, as it never fails to embarrass the different Claimants with many concomitant Difficulties. Yet, still to cast the Blame due to their Govern∣ment, on the King's Mandamus, is more dar∣ingly injurious to the highest Authority in the Nation.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the manner of Redress prescribed for the Sufferers, viz. the old Proprietors of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> is the most shocking Piece of Contrivance, Page 27, <Q><HI>Hinsdale,</HI> a small Township which has late∣ly been taken up by Virtue of a Royal Mandamus, is alone unfortunate—but even here the Possessors may be relieved, by a suit∣able Compensation, equal to the Value of their Improvements in Crown Lands, free from the Ex∣pence of Fees.</Q> These Gentlemen in their great Clemency have also conceded that the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> Settlers in general may be thus considered, <Q>On the same Terms, may be assigned to each of those who are seated on the Soil, actually ap∣propriated to others by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the Possessions of which can∣not for that Reason be confirmed; such a Pro∣portion of Crown Lands, as the Governor and Council shall judge to be adequate to their re∣spective Improvements.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to describe the Tract, <Q>A Fertile and extensive Country, in the north∣ern
<PB N="160" REF="013102_0158_0F8EBB7C2BCB70E8"/>Part of the County of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and be∣tween <HI>Connecticut</HI> River and Lake <HI>Cham∣plain,</HI> still remains unpatented by either Go∣vernment; and might be planted and culti∣vated by these People:</Q>—What a surprising Condescention this! the Posterity of the Original Proprietors of <HI>Hinsdale,</HI> especially, to be allowed the Privilege to pull up Sakes, quit their Farms and Possessions, Houses, Orchards, &amp;c. and join Company with the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers in ge∣neral, and trudge off to the North-East Part of the Wilderness of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and there commence another Settlement, leaving their pleasant Habi∣tations, Fields, Tenements, and Country, in Ex∣change for a howling Wilderness; a pretty Ex∣change!—and this to gratify a number of <HI>New-York</HI> Cormorants. But, let's stop a little and consider—whether it would not be more Righ∣teous to change the Scene, and so the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees remove their Patents, that interfere with the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, and lay them in the Wilderness of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> as neither Government have appropriated it.</P>
<P>A sufficient Reason to be offered in favour of the latter of these Projects, is, that the Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> are in Deed, and in Truth the right and lawful Owners and Proprietors of the Lands they possess, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demonstrated in the preceding Sec∣tions. Although these Gentlemen have, in the Course of their Narration, flung out very extra∣ordinary Hints of rewarding his Majesty's Sol∣diery,
<PB N="161" REF="013102_0159_0F8EBB7FD8E9C6F0"/>by the Distribution of those Lands, yet, they may here again be reminded, (which may fur∣ther serve as the above Reason) that his Majesty's Proclamation directed the Soldiery to make their Pitches on unappropriated and vacant Lands; this therefore, they must do, at the Hazard of los∣ing their Grants, or repitching. For those Lands which being antecedently granted by the Crown, by the Agency of the Governor and Council of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> must forever exclude the Soldie∣ry from pitching thereon; and put it entirely out of the Power of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> or the Crown, to grant them to a Second Person. And when it is considered, that the <HI>New-York</HI> Land-Jobbers have, long since purchased great Part of the Soldiery Rights, and that for a mere Trifle, and laid them out of themselves, at their own Risque; their Arguments on that Subject, cannot contribute greatly to the Removal of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers, to the exterior Part of <HI>Charlotte.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Authors have given a tedious History of the Suits at Law, which have been commenced, by the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees, against the Claim∣ants, and Occupants under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and have exhibited many specious Appearances of Fair∣ness, Equity, and Impartiality in their Tryals. However, the Reader must observe, that in eve∣ry of those, so boasted of, candid Tryals, the Defendants, by the Result, were to be dispossess∣ed of their Farms. They then continue to tell of the entire Satisfaction of the Vanquished, (toge∣ther
<PB N="162" REF="013102_0160_0F8EBB80C1513050"/>with such or the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claimants at attended the Courts) relative to the Validity of the <HI>New-York</HI> Title.—Soon after this, they give a surprising Account of Riots and Outrages, com∣mitted by these Settlers, and mention <HI>Allen</HI> by Name, (who they say, but a little before was so fully persuaded of the Validity of the <HI>New-York</HI> Ti∣tle) as one of their Leaders. This Narrative is in it∣self incredible, it cannot be supposed, that Men who were convinced, they had had an impartial Try∣al at Law, and of the Insufficiency of their own Title, and the Authenticity of that of their Op∣ponents, would rally to arm, in Defiance of legal Authority, and in Defence of their own invalid Ti∣tle; especially, after they had publickly declar∣ed their own Sentiments concerning that Mat∣ter.</P>
<P>THIS Assembly seem profusely lavish in the Praise of their own Government, concerning the Generosity, Forbearance and Humanity, &amp;c. they have exercised towards the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers; and that nothing of that Sort may here pass un∣noticed, but that every Act, by them done, worthy of such Appellations, may be duly acknowledged; it will be freely confessed that Governor <HI>Tryon,</HI> and the Majority of his Majesty's Council, conduc∣ted with Honour and Humanity toward them; while his Excellency was in the Administration, except in passing some very extraordinary Laws on the 9th of March, 1774, which may be seen in the fore Part of this Treatise, under the Head of the Narrative: But those Settlers must have that
<PB N="163" REF="013102_0161_0F8EBB81EF954A28"/>Charity for his Excellency, as to conclude he, would not have put his Sanction to those Laws, had he not known the said Settlers called the <HI>Green Mountain-Boys</HI> to be very expert with Fire-Arms and likewise very good Woodsers; and conse∣quently, that the <HI>New-York</HI> Land-jobbers cou'd not put these Laws in Execution. To view this Matter in any other Light, they would be obliged to distrust the Fidelity of their worthy Friend Gover∣nor <HI>Tryon.</HI> But to return to the Subject of Gene∣rosity. The Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> are unwise to make so great a Bustle about this Matter, inasmuch as they have spoiled the Joke themselves, by their so infamous a Proposal of Accommodation, which as has been before observed, is, that the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers remove to the Wilderness of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> in Order to gratify a certain Fraternity with the Country they have with much Toil and Expence subdued: We have a very beautiful Repre∣sentation of this <HI>New-York</HI> Beneficence by a wise Author, <Q>the tender Mercies of the Wicked are Cruelty.</Q>—Now follows another Quotation from our Authors, which is no less than a barefaced Insult on those Inhabitants, and one of the boldest of Misrepresentations. <Q>If the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claimants imagined that they were aggrieved by the Decisions of our Judges, the Means of Re∣dress were in their own Power; and they ought to have sued their Writs of Error, and in the legal and ordinary Mode, to have referred their Cause to the final Sentence of his Majesty: But to expect a Remedy incompatible with the Ad∣ministration of Justice, and the Rights of the
<PB N="164" REF="013102_0162_0F8EBB8233C883F8"/>Subject, either bespeak the greatest Ignorance, or Presumption.</Q></P>
<P>COULD they once get this established, that there should be no Access to his Majesty, or Trial, but in this "ordinary Mode," it would no doubt, be to their entire Satisfaction; Tryals in that Go∣vernment would then easily become decisive; for in no Case, wherein the Demand of the Plain∣tiff is below the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds, a Writ of Error in Favour of the Defendant can issue. And the <HI>New-York</HI> Attornies who com∣piled the <HI>New-York</HI> Statings, and are also Paten∣tees under that Government, well knew that eve∣ry Action brought against the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claimants has been designedly laid below that Sum. Yet they were possessed of that extreme Boldness to aver in express Terms, that, <Q>if the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claimants imagined, that they were aggrieved, by the Decisions of <HI>their</HI> Judges, their Means of Redress were in their own Power.</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> by Way of a Writ of Er∣ror.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing exhibited in this <HI>New-York</HI> Pamphlet which more sensibly deserves Resentment than their Pretensions of Indulgencies, Favours, &amp;c. conferred on these Claimants by that Govern∣ment—<Q>To the Honor of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> it may justly be asserted, that the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claimants have received every Mark of Favour and Indulgence which the Cir∣cumstances permitted.</Q> Such Hypocrisy de∣bases
<PB N="165" REF="013102_0163_0F8EBB82ED033950"/>Human Nature, is the Pest of Society, par∣takes of Falshood and Treachery; and what ren∣ders it peculiarly vile, is, that it usurps the Seat of Virtue, and destroys Faith in Communities, and is the Source of cruel Jealousy. Had the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> been truly friendly to those Settlers, it had been return'd again; and mutual Good Will supplied the Place of Hatred an Strife. But, alas! so long as the Fee of the Country of the <HI>New Hampshire</HI> Grants is the Object in View, by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> how it is possible for Peace and good Order to take Place, can't well be conceived. Well would it be for that Go∣vernment, and infinitely better for the Settlers un∣der <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> were they annexed to some o∣ther Government; but they say, No. Quere, Why? The Answer is easy. They would then loose Sight of the aforesaid desirable Object: O∣therwise, surely they would be glad to part with such rebellious Subjects as they represent them to be. For the Truth no Doubt is, that they are in Hopes some better Fortune may in future, attend them. And that they can take and execute some of the leading Men among these Inhabitants; and so frighten and impose on the Rest; and finally, by this Means, avail themselves of their Estates and Property. This is all they can desire in continu∣ing this Country under their Jurisdiction. That they have in Reality a View to this, will further appear, by some memorable Sentences recorded in the 25th Page of their Appendix. "We may," say they, <Q>readily conceive, that <HI>Breakenridge,</HI> and his Party, have abundant Reason to wish
<PB N="166" REF="013102_0164_0F8EBB83B5CE8170"/>for an Alteration of Jurisdiction. The public Crimes, and private Wrongs which they have perpetrated, must make them look forward to the Hour of Tranquility, with the most anxious Apprehensions. The injured may then demand Satisfaction for all their Sufferings.—An A∣tonement must then be made to the Country, for the Violation of it's Laws.</Q> Here the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers may read their intended Doom, in Consequence of the Ability of the Government of <HI>New-York.</HI> And one Reason why this Govern∣ment have not already destroyed the Inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Grants, with Fire and Sword, is their Want of Ability; and this Inability, in great Part, consists in this, that the common Peo∣ple in the Government, are universally of Opinion that the Inhabitants have a good Right to those Lands, and should not be molested in the peaceable Enjoyment of them; and consequently will not as∣sist their Civil Officers, in taking Possession of their Tenements, or them as Rioters. That they are no further turbulent than what is necessary to de∣fend their Persons and Properties, from the Cruelty and Monopoly of their Rulers. This is the Ground of all the Lenity, Forbearance and Indul∣gence of that Government towards those Inhabi∣tants; and it is hoped, if these excessive Favours should be passed over without their Thanks, they may yet be excused for the Neglect.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, those Gentlemen, after having thus soon out their in sulcible Complaints, crown the Whole in Page 25th. <Q>That they, i. e. the
<PB N="167" REF="013102_0165_0F8EBAD14037AA00"/><HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers, may in Nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Character, they have appointed <HI>James Brea∣kenridge,</HI> (whom we have so often mentioned) a Fugitive from Justice, and who has rendered himself so obnoxious as to become the immedi∣ate Subject of a Proelamation—as one of their Agents.</Q> What a monstrous Crime is here!—Has Mr. <HI>Breakenridge</HI> rendered himself obnoxious to Punishment in the Government of <HI>New-York?</HI> O strange! Such a <HI>pacific</HI> Government too!—But what has he done? He has never, (notwithstanding all their Insinuations) been active in any Riots (as they term them) occasioned by this Controversy; but is become the Subject of a Proclamation—yet still, what Evil has he done? As those Gentlemen have not obliged the Public with an Information, the Author can supply their Defect. This Gentle∣man was one of the first Settlers on the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> Grants; and has had a great Share in the poli∣tical Oeconomy of that Country, is a Man of Probity and Stedfastness in Principle, and blessed with strong Power of Ponderation, and has gained, as well as merited the Esteem of these Settlers. He was by them chosen as Agent to represent their distressed Cause to the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> President of the Board of Trade; and also, to im∣plore his Majesty to interpose his Royal Autho∣rity, and relieve his oppressed Subjects.—He ap∣proached his Lordship, with a Representation of the Conduct of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to∣wards his Constituents, and sollicited his Lordship's Aid and Assistance, in Behalf of the Sufferers. He was received with Expressions of Kindness,
<PB N="168" REF="013102_0166_0F8EBB869D6CEDB0"/>and when he had laid the Facts of the Cause before his Lordship, and substituted an Agent at <HI>London,</HI> and put the Cause in Readiness for a final Tryal, before his Majesty in Privy Council, returned to <HI>America;</HI> having done all Things to the great Sa∣tisfaction of his Employers.—Since his Re∣turn from Great-Britain, he has made his A∣bode at his own House in <HI>Bennington,</HI> (which is not within Seventeen Miles of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Ri∣ver,) although "a Fugitive from Justice,"—making further Preparations for the decisive Trial depending before his Majesty, and comfort∣ing the Inhabitants, with the Hopes of his most gracious Deliverance. These are the Things which have so exasperated the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> against this good and worthy Man.</P>
<P>AS THE Design of this Section was, in a concise Manner, to point out some of the most notorious Extravagancies of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the Subject can't with Propriety be passed over, without taking a short Review of the forementioned Laws of that Colony, which are the most apparent Portrai∣ture of their horrid Malevolence and Caprice. Pas∣sing these Laws, which are evidently calculated with a Design of extirpating the Inhabitants, by them Laws alluded to, from their goodly Land, nay, from the Face of the Earth; is no less than lavish∣ly foaming out their own Shame; Laws that ought, and are contemned and disregarded by eve∣ry Lover of Virtue. Laws and Society-Compacts were originally designed to protect the Subjects in their Property. Loyalty and Subordination to
<PB N="169" REF="013102_0167_0F8EBB8837B24D00"/>such Government, is essentially necessary, for the Good of Society, and all good and liege Subjects will support such Laws and Legislators. But, as in the present Instance, when Laws, in their original Design and Administration, are degenerated from the good Ends for which Laws and Government were instituted, terminating in the Ruin and Des∣truction of the Society it should secure &amp; protect; from the same Principles, viz. Self-preservation, the Subjects are obliged to resist, and depose such Government. And, inasmuch as those Laws, to∣gether with some Remarks on them, are to be seen in the Narrative Part of this Performance, shall therefore conclude, with leaving the Reader, from his own Meditations, to pass such Sentence con∣cerning this Matter as may appear reasonable.</P>

<BYLINE>By His EXCELLENCY, <HI>BENNING WENTWORTH,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain-General, Governor and Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Province of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> &amp;c.</BYLINE>
<HEAD>A PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEREAS his Honor,</HI> CADWALLADER COLDEN, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Province of</HI> New-York, <HI>bath lately is∣sued a Proclamation, of a very extraordinary Nature, set∣ting forth, that King</HI> CHARLES <HI>the Second, on the</HI> 12th <HI>Day of March,</HI> 1663-4, <HI>and the</HI> 29th <HI>June,</HI> 1674, <HI>did, by his several Letters Patent, of those Dates, grant in Fee to his Brother, the Duke of York, among other Things, all the Land from the West Side of</HI> Connecti∣cut <HI>River to the East Side of Delaware Bay; and therein also set forth, and describes the Bounds of</HI> New-Hampshire; <HI>in which Discription there is a very material Mistake; besides, there is omitted the Fact, on which the Discription of</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>depended, viz. His Majesty's Determination of the North and Western Boundaries of the Province of the</HI> Massa∣chusetts-Bay, <HI>in</HI> 1739. <HI>And nothing can be more evi∣dent, than that</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>may legally extend her Western Boundary as far as the</HI> Massachusetts <HI>Claim reaches, and she claims no more; but</HI> New-York <HI>pretend to claim even to the Banks of</HI> Connecticut <HI>Ri∣ver, although she never laid out and settled one Town in that Part of his Majesty's Lands, since she existed as a Government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When</HI> New-York <HI>Government extends her Eastern Boundary, to the Banks of</HI> Connecticut <HI>River, be∣tween</HI> New-York <HI>and the Colony of</HI> Connecticut; <HI>and
<PB N="171" REF="013102_0169_0F8EBB89B57921F8"/>to the Banks of said River, between</HI> New-York <HI>and the Province of the</HI> Massachusetts-Bay, <HI>it would have been full early for</HI> New-York <HI>to declare that the Go∣vernment of</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>was fully apprised of the Right of</HI> New-York, <HI>under the before recited Letters Patent to the Duke of</HI> York. <HI>In Virtue of the final Determination of the Boundary Lines settled by his late Majesty, between this Government and the</HI> Massachu∣setts-Bay, <HI>all the Lands capable of Settlements, have been erected into Townships, agreeable to his Majesty's Commands, and a considerable Revenue is daily arising to the Crown, unless interrupted and impaired by his Ho∣nor's Proclamation, which</HI> New-Hampshire <HI>will not be answerable for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At present, the Boundaries of</HI> New-York, <HI>to the Northward, are unknown, and as soon as it shall be his Majesty's Pleasure to determine them,</HI> New-Hamp∣shire <HI>will pay ready and chearful Obedience thereunto, not doubting but that all Grants made by</HI> New-Hamp∣shire, <HI>that are fulfilled by the Grantees, will be confirm∣ed to them, if it should be his Majesty's Pleasure to alter the Jurisdiction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For political Reasons, the Claim to Jurisdiction by</HI> New-York, <HI>might have been deferred, as well as the strict Injunction on the Civil Power, to exercise Juris∣diction in their respective Functions, as far as the Eas∣tern Banks of</HI> Connecticut <HI>River.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The said Proclamation carrying an Air of Govern∣ment in it, may possibly affect and retard the Settlement of his Majesty's Lands, granted by this Government: For preventing an Injury to the Crown, of this Kind, and
<PB N="172" REF="013102_0170_0F8EBB8AA7DB23E8"/>to remove all Doubts that may arise to Persons holding the King's Grants, they may be assured, that the Patent to the Duke of York is obsolete, and cannot convey any certain Boundary to</HI> New-York, <HI>that can be claimed as a Boundary, as plainly appears by the several Boundary Lines of the</HI> Jersies <HI>on the West, and the Colony of</HI> Con∣necticut <HI>on the East, which are set forth in the Procla∣mation, as Part only of the Land included in the said Patent to the Duke of</HI> York.</P>
<P><HI>To the End therefore, that the Grantees now settled and settling on those Lands, under his late and present Majesty's Charters, may not be intimidated, or any Way hindered or obstructed in the Improvement of the Lands so granted, as well as to ascertain the Right, and maintain the Jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government of</HI> New-Hampshire, <HI>as far Westward as to include the Grants made:</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE thought fit, by and with the Advice of of His Majesty's Council, to issue this Procla∣mation, hereby encouraging the several Grantees, claiming under this Government, to be industri∣ous in clearing and cultivating their Lands, agree∣able to their respective Grants.</P>
<P>AND I do hereby require and command all Ci∣vil Officers, within this Province, of what Qua∣lity soever, as well those that are not, as those that are Inhabitants on the said Lands, to conti∣nue and be diligent in exercising Jurisdiction in their respective Offices, as far Westward as Grants of Land have been made by this Government;
<PB N="173" REF="013102_0171_0F8EBB8B3500D130"/>and to deal with any Person or Persons, that may presume to interrupt the Inhabitants or Settlers on said Lands, as to Law and Justice doth apper∣tain, the pretended Right of Jurisdiction mention∣ed in the aforesaid Proclamation notwithstanding.</P>

<P>A FOURTH, and last special Motive for the car∣rying on, and extending those Settlements, was from a Report of the Lords of Trade, as follows,</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>EXTRACT from a Report of the Lords of Trade, to the Committee of his Majesty's most Honour∣able Privy Council, for Plantation Affairs, dated December 3d, 1772.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the fullest Examination into all the Circumstances which at present constitute the State of that District between the Rivers <HI>Hud∣son,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut;</HI> out of which, the great∣est Disorders and Confusion have arisen: It seemeth to us, that the principal Objects of At∣tention in the Consideration of any Measures
<PB N="175" REF="013102_0173_0F8EBB905D2CF2C8"/>that can be suggested for restoring public Tran∣quility, and quieting Possessions, are,</P>
<P>FIRST, Those Townships, which having been originally settled and established under Grants from the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> fell within this District, by the Determination of the Northern Boundary of that Province, in the Year 1740.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Those Grants of Land, made within this District, by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> previous to the establishment of the Townships laid out by the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> after the Conclusion of the Peace; and which Land now lies within the Limits of some One or Other of those Townships.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Those Townships, which having been originally laid out by the Governor of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> either continue in the same State, or have been confirmed by Grants from <HI>New-York,</HI> and also, those which have since o∣riginated under Grants from the Latter of those Colonies.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to those Townships which fall under the First of the abovementioned Descrip∣tions; when we consider their Nature and Ori∣gin, and the numberless Difficulties to which the original Proprietors of them must have been subjected in the Settlement of Lands exposed to the Incursions of the Savages, and to every Dis∣tress
<PB N="176" REF="013102_0174_0F8EBB93D965E848"/>which the Neighbourhood of the French in Time of War cou'd bring upon them; and, when we add to these Considerations, the great Reason there is to believe that the Grants were made upon the Ground of Military Services a∣gainst the Enemy; we do not hesitate to Sub∣mit to your Lordships our Opinion, that the present Proprietors of these Townships, ought, both in Justice and Equity, to be quieted in their Possessions: And, that all Grants whatso∣ever, made by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> of any Lands within the Limits of those Town∣ships, whether the Degree of Improvement un∣der the original Grant had been more or less; are, in every Light which they can be viewed, oppressive and unjust: But as we are sensible that such subsequent Grants made by the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> however unwarrantable, cannot be set aside by any Authority from his Majesty, in Case the Grantees shall insist on their Title; we submit to your Lordships, whether it might not be expedient, in Order to quiet the the original Proprietors in their Possessions, to propose that all such Persons who may Claim Possession of Lands within the Limits of such Townships under <HI>New-York</HI> Grants, should up∣on Condition of their quiting such Claim, receive a Grant under the Seal of <HI>New-York</HI> upon the like Terms, and free of all Expences, of an e∣qual Number of Acres in so me other Part of the District lying between the Rivers <HI>Hudson</HI> and <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and in Case where any actual Settlement or Improvement has been made
<PB N="177" REF="013102_0175_0F8EBB94D6B965E8"/>by such Claimants, that they should in such Case, receive Fifty Acres of waste Land for e∣very Three Acres, they may have improved.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to those Grants made by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> which fall within the Second Description, and upon which any actual Improvement has been made; they do appear to us to deserve the same Consideration; and that the Proprietors thereof ought not to be disturbed in their Possessions, whether that Im∣provement be to a greater or lesser Extent: But we beg Leave to observe to your Lordships, that in both these Cases no Consideration ought to be had to any Claim, where it shall appear that no regular Possession has ever been taken, and no actual Settlement ever been made.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to those Townships which fall within the last mentioned Description, we sub∣mit to your Lordships our Opinion, That pro∣vided such Townships do not include Lands within the Limits of some antecedent Grant, upon which actual Improvement has at any Time been made, it would be adviseable they should be confirmed as Townships, according to the Limits expressed in the Grants thereof; and that all Persons having Possession of any Shares in the said Townships, either as original Grantees, or by Purchase or Conveyance, and upon which Shares any actual Improvement or Settlement has been made, ought not in Justice to have been, or to be in Future, disturbed in
<PB N="178" REF="013102_0176_0F8EBB94EB175F40"/>the Possession of such Shares; nor ought they to be bound to any other Conditions, whether of Quit-rent or otherwise, than what is contained in the Grant.</P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>THESE Inducements are indisputably Authori∣tative, and need no Commentation: Yet notwith∣standing the Priority and Preferance of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Title to that of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the so many corroberating and concomitant Inducements to the Claimants under the former, to settle and cultivate those Lands; yet the Assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> in sundry Parts of their State of the Right, &amp;c. and more particularly through the Appendix, treat those Inhabitants, merely on Account of such Settlement, with the most extreme Injury; who, instead of arguing, only declaim against them, and go on in a Gradation of Consequences drawn from false Premises, till they have dragged them from their true Character of honest Men, to that of Usurpers, Rioters, and Felons. Although the Quotations from our Authors have already been lengthy, yet that a Precedent of their Injustice may not here be wanted, the following, from the third Page of their Appendix is inserted.</P>
<P><Q>But though the same Principles have been explained, and enforced in several Acts and Proclamations of Government, as well as on re∣peated Trials in our Courts of Judicatory, they have left no suitable Impression on the contenti∣ous Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> On the Contrary, in Contempt of the Dictates of Justice, the Decisions of Law, and the civil Authority,
<PB N="179" REF="013102_0177_0F8EBB95AC8AD8E8"/>have their Encroachments, which were few in Number at the Time of the royal Determinati∣on, been increased and extended in a tenfold Proportion; and that in general by Men, who cannot plead that they were deceived or ig∣norant of the Nature or Merit of their Claim, which it appears, were too notorious to have es∣caped their Observation, but who in spite of e∣very Warning and Remonstrance to deter them, which human Prudence could devise, engaged as Volunteers on the Side of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and wilfully plunged themselves into the Controver∣sy. To extenuate their own Indiscretion &amp; Miscon∣duct, Calumny &amp; Misrepresentation are their on∣ly Resource; and accordingly without the least Reason, they charge the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> with Partiality, and every Land-holder under it, upon whom they have trespassed, with Injustice &amp; Oppression; asserting, that because they have sanctified their Claim by a wrongful Possession, they ought peacebly to enjoy the Fruits of their U∣surpation. To fortify their Pretentions they have spared no Art or Act of Violence, however Criminal; and after all, as if they were really injured, and the Objects of Regard, they do not hesitate to carry their Complaints to the Throne, and by special Agents to solicit some extraordi∣nary Act of Favour, by which their Offences may be passed over with Impunity, and their Encroachments perpetuated in Prejudice to those who enjoy a clear Title from the Crown, under the Great Seal of <HI>New-York.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="013102_0178_0F8EBB9671304518"/>
As this clamorous Quotation is already mostly answered, shall only remark, as to those Settlers ex∣tending their Encroachments in a ten-fold Propor∣tion, since the Royal Determination. It hath been fully evinced that this Determination respected Jurisdiction only, and the before recited Royal Order and Report of the Board of Trade, were ac∣counted sufficient to exclude all manner of Doubts in the Minds of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claimants of the Validity of their Title. They truly cannot plead that <Q>they were deceived or ignorant of the Nature or Merit of their Claim.</Q> This Mat∣ter was elucidated by the highest Wisdom and Au∣thority in the Nation; they rejoice in the Clem∣ency of their Sovereign, and in the Wisdom and impartial Justice of the Honourable Board of Trade, exhibited as aforesaid, upon which Encou∣ragement those Claimants have greatly extended Settlements on those Lands, in a more special Manner on Onion River, and Lake Champlain, between the Township of Panton, which a-buts on the Lake opposite <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and the said River, and North of it almost to the Forty-fith Degree of North Latitude, and preparations are vigorously making to extend these Settlements to the very Bounds of the Province of <HI>Quebec.</HI> It is seldom any new Country Settles with such Rapidity, not∣withstanding the Oppositions they meet with from the Government of <HI>New-York:</HI> The Expence of clearing Roads, building Mills, Moving to and settling in that Wilderness Country only for Two Years last past, would amount to no very incon∣siderable Sum. And those Settlers from the fore∣going
<PB N="181" REF="013102_0179_0F8EBB973512AB80"/>Reasons, do not in the least hesitate, but that they in so fulfilling the Conditions of their Charters, have and are acting agreeable to his Majesty's Will and Pleasure; and that those Labours will not only be for their own Emolument, but for the Enlargement of the British Empire, and Addition of the Crown Revenue.</P>
<P>THE Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> have been very particular in their History of the Tumults and Ri∣ots made by those Settlers, in Opposition to that Government, (many of which Facts must be con∣fessed to be true) though they have carefully o∣mitted their manyfold Provocations, yet, with all their Particularity have given but a very imper∣fect Idea of those Transactions. I shall here, there∣fore, waving particulars, give a general Review of the Oeconomy of those Settlers in their Opposi∣tions to that Government. For defending their Properties, they were indicted Rioters, the next Thing was to defend Rioters; then they had two Objects as the Subjects of their Protection, viz. their Persons, as well as Property: They were at First greatly intimidated at the empty Appear∣ance of Law, that their Opponents were so con∣versant with, sometimes despairing of maintaining their Possessions; yet upon Extremity, rather than quit their Substance to the insatiable Ravishers, would rally and frustrate their Designs: Thus, when the Sheriff of the County of <HI>Albany</HI> with his Posse came to dispossess some of them, they most generally, boldly took up Arms, and appointed Leaders. Matters having come to this, not long
<PB N="182" REF="013102_0180_0F8EBB9800A17BD8"/>after, the Inhabitants assembled and appointed Committees of Safety in the several Towns through∣out their Settlement; this general Committee have the conducting of the Public Affairs of the Coun∣try for its Security, 'till his Majesty settles the Controversy. They have erected several Compa∣nies, which by the Votes of the Soldiers are fur∣nished with Officers, these Companies form a Re∣giment which are known by the significant Cha∣racter of GREEN-MOUNTAIN BOYS, who are ge∣nerally in the Prime of Life, well versed in the Use of Fire-Arms, and of robust Constitutions; probably no American Regiment in an interior Defence could excel them, or that would willing∣ly contribute more to the Support of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for it is observable, that such Subjects that will not fight for their Property, will never fight for their King: And, the general In∣structions from the Committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing against the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> but on the Defensive.</P>
<P>IT is in the Nature of Things impossible to pass a right Judgment on the Conduct of the <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> Settlers, without taking into View the Treat∣ment of the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> towards them. All Cases must be determined upon the peculiar Cir∣cumstances attending; no Act can scarcely be con∣ceived of which, under certain attending Circum∣stances might not be lawful. It will be readily admitted on the Part of those Settlers, that, pro∣vided the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and its Pa∣tentees have a clear and incontestible Right to
<PB N="183" REF="013102_0181_0F8EBAD0903D8FF0"/>those Lands; and that they are Intruders, and by Force and Violence have maintained such En∣croachments, then, they are truly guilty, in man∣ner as the Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> have alledged: But on the Contrary, if those Settlers have a legal and incontestible Right to those Lands, that they prosecute Settlement on the good Faith of that Title, and the sundry Approbations of both their Title and Settlement from the British Adminis∣tration, then, they are not guilty in Manner as those Gentlemen have declared; and the impar∣tial Public, instead of viewing them as Usurpers, Rioters and Felons, will justify them in their Con∣duct, and esteem them as good Members of Soci∣ety, leige Subjects to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and good Soldiers for defending their Persons and Properties.</P>
<P>THUS, is humbly submitted the State of the Con∣troversy, which has for many Years subsisted between the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> and the Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> by impartial Jus∣tice must every Act stand or fall; if those Settlers are in the wrong, they are criminally so, but if not, then the Allegations of their Opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION, TO THE APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the <HI>French</HI> Government of <HI>Canada</HI> have made sundry Grants of some of the most valu∣able Part of those Lands in Dispute, between the Govern∣ment of <HI>New-York</HI> and the Claimants under <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> on the Easterly Side of Lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> and even to the Southward of <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> And whereas the General Assembly of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> in their State of the Rights of that Colony, so far as concerns the <HI>French</HI> Grants aforesaid, have very in∣geniously confuted the <HI>French</HI> Claim to those Lands; shall therefore subjoin it as an Appendix to this Treatise, in asmuch as the same Arguments equally Support the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Claim against that of the French, as they do that of <HI>New-York.</HI>—There were several Rea∣sons which induced the Author to make Use of this Ap∣pendix.</P>
<P><HI>Firstly,</HI> Because he is not acqainted with many of the Historical Facts, on which the Arguments therein Con∣tained are founded. And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From the Consideration that he cannot Argue so well. And a Third and special Reason is,</P>

Because be is credibly informed that the Gentlemen Land-schemers of New-York have altered their Plan of Operation, and have at an inconsiderable Price, pur∣chased the greatest Part of the <HI>French</HI> Claim to corobor∣ate their own subsequent Patents, and by that Means to avail themselves of an antecedent Claim to that of <HI>New-Hampshire;</HI> and that their present Scheme is to be silent at the Court at <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with Respect to their Claim under <HI>New-York,</HI> and carry on the Dispute in the Name of the <HI>French</HI> Barons, hopeing by this Stra∣tagem to procure to themselves the Fee of those Lands which the <HI>French</HI> Grants cover; and frustrate and Dispossess the Claimants and Settlers under <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> which are seated on the Lands the <HI>French</HI> Grants include, to the Number of about Three Hundred Families, and on which there is not a single Settler under either the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>New-York</HI> Claim. And inasmuch, as the Chain of Arguments predicated on undeniable Facts, and exhibited in the following Appendix, of which this is an Introduction, are abundantly sufficient to invalidate the <HI>French</HI> Claim, the Author therefore takes a peculiar Pleasure in turning the Artillery of the Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> against themselves, in full Confidence that, that Assembly cannot, by Reason and Argument, gainsay what they have thus exhibited with the Help of any <HI>French</HI> Cunning whatsoever. And provided the Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> had published the following Appendix, with a friendly Design towards the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Settlers; that Assembly would have merited their grateful Acknowledgements; but though their Design at that Time was to defeat the <HI>French</HI> Claim to establish their <HI>New-York</HI> Patents, nevertheless it seems a good Pro∣vidence hath made Use of the learned Abilities and evil
<PB N="187" REF="013102_0184_0F8EBB9A390A0530"/>Intensions of the Gentlemen of that Assembly, which those Settlers dreaded as their greatest temporary Evil to be conducive to their greatest temporary Good.</P>
<P>Altho' the Arguments contained in the Appendix, to be hereafter inserted, are full and compleat against the <HI>French</HI> Claim, they are nevereheless somewhat incum∣bered with meer imaginary Notions, relative to the pro∣digious and antient Northern Extention of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> even to the River <HI>St. Lawrence.</HI> They indeed ascertain and vindicate the Right of the Crown of England to those Lands, and then on ficticious Princi∣ples assume the Right of that Colony to be co-extensive with that of the Crown. Now the Reader will with a lit∣tle Attention, discern that Arguments relative to the <HI>French</HI> claim, do not at all depend on the aforemention∣ed Extention of the Right of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> or of any of his Majesty's colonies: Meerly the Right of the crown to that Extention of Territory is abundantly suffi∣cient to nullify and make void the <HI>French</HI> claim. Un∣doubtedly those Lands granted by the <HI>French</HI> Govern∣ment of <HI>Canada,</HI> adjoining to Lake <HI>Champlain</HI> were crown Lands when usurped and granted by the <HI>French,</HI> and continued so to be till it was granted by his Majes∣ty's <HI>English</HI> Government of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI> But of this enough has been already animadverted. The Dispute between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> is committed to the Publick consideration. What remains in this Intro∣duction to the Appendix is only to point out to the Rea∣der that such Part of the Arguments, or rather Repre∣sentations, therein contained as assume a colony Right to those Lands, are foreign to the Point in Issue, in the Dispute of the French claim; the same may be said, pro∣vided
<PB N="188" REF="013102_0185_0F8EBB9AEBD71178"/>the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> assume a par∣ticular colony Right of their's to the same Premises. Such Arguments may truly affect the colonies of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> but by no Means affect the Issue in Dispute relative to the French claim, inasmuch as the Right of the Crown of England to those Lands Precludes the French claim intirely. Therefore such colony Arguments as may be found interspersed in the following Appendix are only Digressions from the Point in Issue, but cannot any Way affect the Arguments which centre in that sin∣gle Point. Those Digressions are also virtually an∣swered in the foregoing Discourse.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, Transcribed from the Assembly of <HI>New-York's</HI> State, &amp;c. Verbatim.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A STATE Of the Rights of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> so far as concerns the Grants formerly made by the <HI>French</HI> Goverment of <HI>Canada,</HI> of Lands on <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> and at and to the Southward of <HI>Crown-Point.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Whole intermediate Coast between <HI>Mar∣tha</HI>'s <HI>Vineyard</HI> and the first Settlements in <HI>Virginia,</HI> remained entirely unknown 'till <HI>Hudson's</HI> Discovery in 1609, when it began to be minutely explored, and the Bays, Rivers, Islands, and Creeks, distinguished by Name.</P>
<P><HI>Hudson's</HI> River was again visited in 1610, and the following Years, by <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, with a Grant under the States General for an exclusive Trade; and the Coloy which they denominated <HI>Nieuw Nederlant,</HI> advanced with such Rapidity, that in 1612 they had a Town and Fort in <HI>New-Amster∣dam,</HI> now <HI>New-York;</HI> and in 1615, another Town and Fort at <HI>Aurania,</HI> now <HI>Albany</HI> 160 Miles up <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River.</P>
<P>IN 1623, they erected Fort <HI>Good Hope,</HI> on <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> River, and upwards of Thirty-five Miles from its Mouth. Near to this ancient Fortress the Town of <HI>Hartford</HI> has since been built under <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but it is indisputable that the <HI>Dutch</HI> actually enjoyed the exclusive Possession, Trade,
<PB N="190" REF="013102_0187_0F8EBB9C80151288"/>and Advantage of the whole River, long before it had been approached by any <HI>English</HI> Subject; and that they claimed and considered all the Country to the Westward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and as <HI>far</HI> Northward as the River St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> as Part of their Colony of <HI>Nieuw Nederlandt</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Ogilvy</HI>'s America, published in 1671, and the Map at Page 168, Sect. <HI>Nieuw Nederlant;</HI> where this Country is called <HI>Nova Belgica,</HI> and <HI>Nieuw Nederlant;</HI> and the River itself is cal∣led <HI>Rio St. Lawrence,</HI> DE GROUTE RIVIER VAN NIEUW NEDERLANT.

<P>IN 1663-4, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, granted to his Brother <HI>James,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> the District of Country comprehending <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer∣sey,</HI> which were Territories possessed by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>IN that Year the <HI>Dutch</HI> were subdued by an Ar∣mament from <HI>England.</HI> By the Articles of Capi∣tulation, the Rights and Estates of all the Inhabi∣tants were secured to them.</P>
<P>IN 1673, the Country was again surrendered to a <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, but in 1674, by Treaty between the two Nations, the <HI>Dutch</HI> ceded all their Claim to this Country, to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IN the same Year King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to re∣move all Doubts which might have arisen concern∣ing the Validity of his first Grant to the Duke, on Account of the intermediate Conquest by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> confirmed the same Territories to his Royal
<PB N="191" REF="013102_0188_0F8EBB9D323EE270"/>Highness by a new Grant. There can be no Dis∣pute but that by the Words of the Duke's Grant, the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> was to have an Eastern Extent to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. That River takes it's Rise to the Northward of the 45th Degree of North Latitude, and consequently beyond the Boundary lately established between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Quebet,</HI> by his Majesty's Royal Proclamation of the 7th Day of <HI>October</HI> 1763.</P>
<P>ON this Principle we have always claimed, un∣der the Royal Grant, as the just and ancient Right of this Province, All the Country which lies to the South of West Line drawn from the Head of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River; except so far as it interferes with the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> with which a Settlement was made in 1683, by Commissaries of both Pro∣vinces, under mutual Acts of Legislature, and which was confirmed by King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we have a further Title to the Country as far Northward as the South Side of the River <HI>St. Lawrence.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> on their first Establishment here, made a Treaty of Peace and Alliance with the Five Nations, called by the <HI>French</HI> the <HI>Iroquois.</HI> These warlike Tribes were the Conquerors and Masters of a great Part of <HI>North-America,</HI> holding all the Natives in Subjection, from the River <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> down to <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>English</HI> became possessed of <HI>New-York,</HI> they also made an Alliance with the Five Nations,
<PB N="192" REF="013102_0189_0F8EBB9E12F5AEF8"/>who afterwards, in the most express Terms, sub∣jected themselves to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> under the Government of <HI>New-York;</HI> and however wild and untractable, were always treated as Subjects by this Government.</P>
<P>THE Country as far Northward as the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> and Westward without any known Li∣mits, was their undoubted Property<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the Country as far North as the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> or Five Nations, is proved by all the ancient Maps and Histories. In the Map inscribed <HI>Nova Belgica,</HI> et <HI>Anglia Nova,</HI> published in xi Vol. Geographiae Blavianae, in 1662, <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> is called <HI>Lacus Irocoiensis,</HI> and the Country on the East Side of the Lake is called <HI>Irocoisia.</HI>
<P>In <HI>Johannes Van Keulen</HI>'s Atlas, published at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in 1720, the River <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> is called <HI>Rio des Iroquois ou de St. Lawrence,</HI> and the Country on the South of that River and West of <HI>Lake Champlain, Iroquois,</HI> and the Lake itself <HI>Lac Champlain on mere de Iroquois.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ogilvy</HI> in his America, says one of the great Lakes is called the Lake of <HI>Iroquois,</HI> which together with a River of the same Name <HI>(Sorrel</HI> by the <HI>French)</HI> falls into the River of <HI>Canada.</HI> He adds, that the <HI>French</HI> having, in early Times, sided with the <HI>Algonquins,</HI> against the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> have been so bated by them ever since, that none of them durst ever appear again in any Part of the Lake. <HI>Ogilby</HI> 166.</P>
<P>The Five Nations formerly lived near the Place where <HI>Mon∣treal</HI> now stands. In 1672 the <HI>French</HI> Governor Monsieur <HI>De Frontenac,</HI> persuaded them to allow him to build a Fort on the North Side of <HI>Cadaracqui</HI> Lake, under Pretence of a Store for Marthandize. <HI>Colden</HI>'s History Five Nations, Page 21, 24.</P></NOTE>; this Go∣vernment has consequently considered it as Part of the Province of <HI>New-York.</HI>—The Lands on the West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River by a double Title,—the Grant to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which expressly includes it, and the Right acquired by the Sub∣jection of the native Proprietors.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="013102_0190_0F8EBB9EB3ABA170"/>
THE Crown, by a Participation in numberless Acts of Government, has justified our Right and Jurisdiction over these Countries. And it is re∣markable that no single Commission, Instruction, or Act, either of our own or from Home, 'till the late Proclamation, had the least Tendency to alter or infringe such Jurisdiction; but it solely rested on the Basis we have mentioned.</P>
<P>THAT the Crown considered the Five Nations, and their Country, to be under it's Subjection, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That the Five Nations became Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> and put themselves under it's Protection, appears from many of their Treaties.—Vide <HI>Colden's</HI> History, Page 53, 54, 62, 80, 139.</NOTE> and that the <HI>French</HI> could have no Claim to ei∣ther, is manifest from the fifteenth Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> 11th <HI>April,</HI> 1713.</NOTE> confirmed by that of <HI>Aix-La-Chapelle;</HI> stipulating that the Subjects of <HI>France,</HI> Inhabitants of <HI>Canada,</HI> and elsewhere, shall not disturb or molest in any Manner whatever, the Five <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, <HI>which are subject to Great-Bri∣tain,</HI> nor its other American Allies. And that it was well understood both by the Crowns of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> Right and Claim did extend as far Northward as the South Part of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> including the Lakes which discharge themselves into that River, clearly appears from the several Proposals and Conferences of the Ambassador from the Court of <HI>Versailles,</HI> with the British Ministry in 1756, on the Subject of a Suspension of Hostilities, and a Convention for the amicable Termination of the Differences between the two Crowns; at the Close
<PB N="194" REF="013102_0191_0F8EBBA48F4C5608"/>of which <HI>France</HI> demanded, as a previous Conditi∣on, that his Britannick Majesty should desist from three Points, which made a principal Part of the Subject in Dispute; the first of which was <Q>The South Part of the River St. Lawrence, and the Lakes that discharge themselves into that Ri∣ver.</Q> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Entic's</HI> History of the late War, Page 228. War was not proclaimed by <HI>England</HI> 'till the 18th of <HI>May,</HI> 1756.</NOTE> The Refutation and Rejection of this extraordinary Claim, occasioned the sudden De∣parture of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, and the Decla∣ration of War, which followed soon after.</P>
<P>THIS Government has given the most solid and authentic Proofs both of Possession and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>risdicti∣on, which the Subject could admit of, and nothing but the dangerous Neighbourhood of <HI>Canada,</HI> and their Intrigues with the Savages, (which often delug∣ed this Frontier Part of the Province in Blood) has prevented it's actual Cultivation and Improvement.</P>
<P>So long ago as 1696, a Grant passed the Great Seal of this Province to <HI>Godfrey Dellius,</HI> for a Tract of Country extending from the North Bounds of <HI>Saraghtoga,</HI> (which lies on <HI>Hudson's</HI> River thirty four Miles North of the City of <HI>Albany</HI>) to the Rock <HI>Rosian,</HI> a Station indisputable, and which is well known to lie on <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> upwards of twenty Miles to the North of <HI>Crown-Point;</HI> and extending twelve Miles East from <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, and the same Distance East from the Wood-Creek, and the Waters to the Northward. Nor ought it be unobserved, that such was the Value and Impor∣tance of this Tract of Country, even at that early
<PB N="195" REF="013102_0192_0F8EBBA567676ED0"/>Day, that the Legislature conceived the Grant of it to be too great a Favour to one Subject, and passed a Law in the Year 1699, repealing it as ex∣travagant. <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Laws of <HI>New-York,</HI> 1 Vol. Page 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>FORMERLY, and before the Year 1731, we had a Trading-House at Crown-Point, where our Traders occasionally resided; for it was not 'till that Year that the Canadians, in profound Peace, invaded this frontier Part of the Province, and e∣rected Fort <HI>St. Frederick</HI> at Crown-Point, which has been the Occasion of an almost uninterrupted Series of Contention and Bloodshed. As it secured them the absolute Command of the Lakes, and facilitated their In-roads not only into this but the neighbouring Colonies of the <HI>Massachusett's-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> nothing could be more alarming; and no sooner was it communicated than our House of Assembly, in order to obtain Relief, and the King's Directions, addressed the Commander in Chief to represent to his Majesty or his Ministers, these Encroachments, and the fatal Consequences they must be attended with.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal of the General Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> Vol. 1, Page 632.—Also Minutes of the Privy Council of <HI>New-York,</HI> in 1731.</NOTE></P>
<P>A COMPLAINT was accordingly transmitted to Sir <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> but it made so little Impression on that Minister, that our Government was left without the least Direction from their Superiors; and conceiving an attempt to oppose or dislodge the <HI>French</HI> (which probably must have drawn upon
<PB N="196" REF="013102_0193_0F8EBBA58155DBA0"/>them the whole Power of Canada) to be too ha∣zardous an Undertaking, without the Authority or Assistance of the Crown, this important Pass was left in the Hands of our Enemies.</P>
<P>BUT tho' we were at that Time unable to do ourselves Justice, it was not only the Opinion of this, but of all the neighbouring Colonies, that the Erection of the Fort at Crown-Point was a dan∣gerous Encroachment; and that the common In∣terest demanded that proper Measures shou'd be a∣dopted to secure the Colonies against the Mischiefs to which it exposed them.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY in 1755, and before the Declara∣tion of War, this Colony, in Conjunction with the <HI>Massachusett's-Bay</HI> and Connecticut, formed a Plan for erecting one or more Forts on his Majesty's Lands at or nigh Crown-Point, and the Troops were raised accordingly,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Journal of the General Assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> 2 Vol. Page 440.</NOTE> but War being soon pro∣claimed, our Operations became more extensive.</P>
<P>IN short, on the Principle that it was unquesti∣onably a Part of the British Dominions within this Colony, the Government both at home and here, have ever considered the Occupancy of Crown Point by the <HI>French,</HI> as a persidious and dangerous Encroachment, which in Effect was one of the principal Causes of both of the last Wars. These Remarks justify an Inference of the utmost Mo∣ment in the present Controversy, <HI>to wit,</HI> That as it was an ancient Right of this Colony, coeval with
<PB N="197" REF="013102_0194_0F8EBBA80486DFE0"/>it's first Plantation by <HI>English</HI> Subjects, to extend even further Northward than the Latitude of 45 Degrees, to which it is now restricted, his Majes∣ty's Proclamation, instead of enlarging our Li∣mits, (as has been understood by some, who have not considered the Subject, and pretended by o∣thers whose Interest it is to misrepresent) does in Fact considerably abridge it, operating as a Con∣firmation of our original Title up to the Line it establishes; and as an Extinction of Jurisdiction beyond it (<HI>to wit</HI>) over the Lands between that Latitude and the Head of Connecticut River, or more properly the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> our old Boundary.</P>
<P>IT is true that since the Year 1731, the <HI>French</HI> by maintaining Forts and strong Garrisons at Crown-Point, Tieonderoga, &amp;c. have deprived us of the Enjoyment of the Country to the North∣ward of <HI>Albany;</HI> nor was it possible to extend our Plantations, perpetually exposed to the Ravages of a most cruel Enemy, 'till on the Approach of Sir <HI>Jeffery Amherst,</HI> with the English Army in 1759, the <HI>French</HI> abandoned both their Forts and their Settlements.—These last were very few in Number, and all of them in the Neighbourhood of Crown Point and Tieonderoga; which having been in∣tended by the <HI>French</HI> as Places of Arms, to annoy and distress this Colony the more effectually, no Cultivation had taken place but for the meer Con∣veniency of their Garrisons. Sir <HI>Jeffery Amherst</HI> apprehensive of the bad Consequences of Cana∣dian Settlements on the Banks of Lake Champlain,
<PB N="198" REF="013102_0195_0F8EBBAAE8B40370"/>prohibited them, nor have they to this Moment been re-established.</P>
<P>THE Capitulation granted by the <HI>English</HI> Gene∣ral to the Inhabitants of Canada, on the Conquest in 1760, stipulates, <Q><HI>That the</HI> French, <HI>in the whole Extent of the colony of</HI> Canada, <HI>shall preserve the entire Possession and Property of their Goods, noble and ignoble, moveable and immoveable; and shall have Liberty to keep, let, and sell them, as well to</HI> French <HI>as to the</HI> English.</Q></P>
<P>BY the first Article of the definitive Treaty of Peace between <HI>Great-Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in 1763, <Q><HI>His most Christion Majesty cedes and guaran∣ties to</HI> Great-Britain, Canada <HI>and all its Dependen∣cies.</HI></Q> His Britannick Majesty, on his Side, agrees, <Q><HI>That the</HI> French <HI>Inhabitants of</HI> Canada <HI>may retire with all Safety and Freedom, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> they shall think proper, and may sell their Estates, pro∣vided it be to the Subjects of his Baitannick Majesty, &amp;c. The Term limited for this Emigration shall be fixed to the Space of eighteen Months, to be computed from the Day of the Exchange of the Ratification of the present Treaty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>NOTHING seems more obvious than that the Se∣curity given to the Canadians, both by the Capi∣tulation and the Treaty, was confined to the Li∣mits of the Colony of Canada; nor any Thing more absurd, than to suppose it should extend to a Part of the Country which the <HI>French</HI> had per∣fidiously usurped, and which they had only within the Compass of a few Years granted to the Cana∣dians, to further their Encroachments.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="013102_0196_0F8EBBAB83C6CC00"/>
THE Government of <HI>New-York</HI> therefore, inde∣pendent of his Majesty's late Establishment of our Boundary with <HI>Quebec,</HI> could not but consider all the Country on both Sides of Lake Champlain, as un∣questionably within it's just and ancient Limits and Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THAT the Canadian Grants can never be justi∣fied by a meer Encroachment, nor derive Stability or Confirmation either from the Capitulation or the Treaty, was not only the Opinion here, but also of his Majesty and his Ministers.</P>
<P>IN Pursuance of the Proclamation of the 7th Day of October, 1763, Sir <HI>Henry Moore,</HI> and Col. <HI>Carleton,</HI> the Governors of the two Provinces, in the Month of September 1767, fixed the Place of the Latitude of 45 Degrees, by actual Observation, near the North End of the Lake. On the 12th Day of August 1768, his Majesty was pleased to declare his Approbation in Privy Council, and to direct in favour of his new Canadian Subjects, <Q><HI>That nothing in the Order of that Date contained, should affect the Property of such as had Possessions under proper Titles in Lands on the South Side of the Line, the Dominion of which was not disputed on the Part of the crown of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>and that the said Determination should not operate wholly to de∣prive them of such concessions on the South Side of the said Line whereon they had made actual Settlements and Improvements, altho' the said Line might have been disputed by the crown of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>but proportioned to their Improvements at the Rate of
<PB N="200" REF="013102_0197_0F8EC51D6AC30198"/>fifty Acres for every three that were improved; pro∣vided that Grants should be sue out under the Seal of</HI> New-York, <HI>subject to the usual Quit-Rents, and that a Grant to one Person should not exceed</HI> 20,000 <HI>Acres.</HI></Q></P>
<P>LORD <HI>Hillsborough,</HI> in a Letter to Sir <HI>Henry Moore</HI> our late Governor, on this Subject, of the 25th of <HI>February</HI> 1768, expresses himself as follows. <Q><HI>Your Letter to Lord</HI> Shelbourne, <HI>No. 5, which relates to the claim of his Majesty's American Subjects, to Lands on that Part of</HI> Lake-Champlain <HI>which is now a Part of the Colony of</HI> New-York, <HI>has been referred to the Lords of Trade, and their Lordships having made a Report to his Majesty thereupon, it is his Majesty's Resolution, upon the fullest Considerati∣on, not to allow any Claims made upon the Ground of ancient Grants from the Government of</HI> Canada, <HI>is Lands which were never acknowledged to belong of Right to the Crown of</HI> France.</Q></P>
<P>"<HI>His Majesty has a most tender Regard to the Rights of his new Subjects, and is desirous of giving every pro∣per Testimony of his Attention to their Interest and Wel∣fare, and therefore it is his Majesty's Pleasure, that they should not be disturbed in the peaceable Possession of any Tracts so circumstanced,</HI> WHICH THEY HAVE ACTUAL∣LY SETTLED AND IMPROVED; <HI>provided they consent to establish their Titles under the Seal of the Province of</HI> New-York, <HI>upon the usual Conditions of Quit-Rents and Improvements.</HI>"</P>
<P>CONFORMABLE to these Sentiments, a Royal Mandamus, directed to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="013102_0198_0F8EC51E2F816468"/>actually issued upon the Report of the Board of Trade, and by the Advice of the Privy Council, on the 11th Day of <HI>January</HI> 1769, requiring him to lay out for, and grant to <HI>Charles De Fredenburgh,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in one contiguous Tract, 30,000 Acres of Land; which is expressly described in the said Royal Order or Mandamus, to lie on the West Side of <HI>Lake-Champlain;</HI> beginning from a cer∣tain Point opposite to the Island <HI>Valceur,</HI> including <HI>Sarenac</HI> River, on both the Banks, as far as the Highwaterfall, the Land, Beech and Creek; and including also, the whole Point of <HI>Cumberland</HI> Bay, commonly <HI>Squinanton</HI> or <HI>Cumberland Head.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tract is likewise laid down on the Map, and actually includes a great Part of two of the Seigniories which are the Object of this Dispute.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Map No. 1</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Title of this Province, in Right of the Crown, to all the Country to the Southward of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> ('till his Majesty's Pro∣clamation, and since that Act, to the Southward of the 45th Degree of Latitude) being thus clear∣ly established, it cannot be wondered at that af∣ter the Peace was restored, our Government pro∣ceeded to the Grant and Settlement of the Lands to the Southward of this last Boundary, without the least Scruple.</P>
<P>His Majesty having been pleased by his Royal Proclamation of the 7th Day of <HI>October</HI> 1763, to as∣sign to the reduced Officers and disbanded Soldiers, who had served him so gloriously in <HI>America,</HI> each a Quantity of Land for their more comfortable Sub∣sistence,
<PB N="202" REF="013102_0199_0F8EC51EF754EEA8"/>and as a Reward for their Service; and having left to them <HI>the Right of Election,</HI> out of any Part of the different Colonies which remained vested in the Crown, they in general applied to this Government for Patents, locating their several Lots along the East and West Sides of <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> on the <HI>Wood Creek,</HI> and at and to the Southward of <HI>Crown Point.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were several Reasons which induced them to fix, and the Government to grant, in this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>IT had been the Scene of War, and they were well acquainted with it. They seemed to have a peculiar Right to be provided for, out of the im∣mediate Fruits of their Victories; and above all, the rest of the Province which remained unappro∣priated, belonged to the Native Occupants, and could not be patented without a previous Purchase from them: A Condition with which most of the Officers, and all the Soldiers, were unable to com∣ply. Under these Circumstances they were chiefly gratified by Grants of the Lands first mentioned, and the Country adjoining to the Southward and Eastward, after being put to great Trouble and Expence in the Discovery and actual Survey of their respective Allotments. Many Grants have also been made to the Inhabitants of the Colony in the same District, which, as far as they concern this Controversy, are laid down in the annexed Map.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Map No. 1</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Canadian Grants cover a great Part of the
<PB N="203" REF="013102_0200_0F8EC52003CCAFD0"/>Country along both Sides of <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> not only to <HI>Crown Point</HI> but several Miles to the South∣ward. They include the Whole, or chief Part of antient Grant to <HI>Dellius;</HI> which has since been parcelled out among the Military. They are numerous, large in Extent, but unattended (ex∣cept in very few Instances) with the least Improve∣ment or Possession.</P>
<P>THEY all originated at, and since the Time of the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments at <HI>Crown-Point</HI> in 1731, and several of them are so late as the Years 1757, and 1758: A Period when we were actually at War with <HI>France,</HI> concerning these very Lands!</P>
<P>THE Number and Extent of these Grants, and how destructive it must prove to the Rights of the King's Military Subjects, as well as to others, to give them the least Countenance, will be seen by a View of the annexed Map and the Notes which accompany it.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Map No. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>ON this Subject we are furnished with two Peti∣tions, the one presented to his Majesty by several Persons whose names do not appear in the Copy; the other to the Lords of Trade, by Monsieur <HI>De Lolbinier.</HI></P>
<P>THE Merits of these Petitions are founded, 1st. On an Assertion that the Lands in question lie within the ancient Bounds of <HI>Canada</HI> as <HI>peaceably</HI> possessed for many Years by the <HI>French,</HI> and have only been <HI>added</HI> to the Colony of <HI>New-York</HI> by the
<PB N="204" REF="013102_0201_0F8EC520A773CAE0"/>King's Proclamation. 2d. On the Article of the Capitulation and Treaty of Peace before taken no∣tice of 3d. On the <HI>actual Improvements and Possessi∣on</HI> of the Petitioners or their Grantors. 4th. On their having, in many Cases, paid the Governor of <HI>Quebec,</HI> the Quint or fifth Part of the original Pur∣chase Money of their respective Seigniories, and done Faith and Homage, and having been put in full Seisen in the King's Name. 5th. On the Hardship of their having been turned out of Pos∣session, by Titles granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> and being further threatened with the same Distress.</P>
<P>We have anticipated the three first of these As∣sertions. 1st. <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> nor any of the Lands Southward of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> were ever a Part of <HI>Canada,</HI> but rightfully belonged to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as within his Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and as the Country of the Five Nati∣ons his Subjects; nor were they ever in the <HI>peace∣able</HI> Possession of the <HI>French.</HI> They were invaded in Time of profound Peace, with an armed Power. they were held by the same unjustifiable Means. They were the Source of perpetual Contention and Bloodshed between the Provinces of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>New-York.</HI> They were a chief Occasion of two bloody Wars between the Nations. Can this be called <HI>a Title or a peaceable Possession?</HI> 2d. We have shown that neither the Articles of Capitulation, nor the Treaty, can serve the Purpose of the Claim∣ants. The Capitulation can only apply to what the <HI>French</HI> had a Right to, and not to what they had unjustifiably seized; and as to the Clause of
<PB N="205" REF="013102_0202_0F8EC521976F11B8"/>the Treaty, it only gives leave to the <HI>French</HI> Sub∣jects to sell their Estates in <HI>Canada,</HI> but does not confirm or concern <HI>disputable,</HI> and much less <HI>tortious and fraudulent Grants,</HI> founded in Breach of Faith; nor can it create a Right which had no prior Ex∣istence. Besides, this is a Point which the Crown has already solemnly determined, and it is presum∣ed there can be little danger of the Change of a Resolution grounded on the clearest Dictates of Reason and Justice. 3d. As to the third Particu∣lar, actual Possessions and Improvements by the Canadian Claimants and their Grantors, it is deni∣ed that any such (worthy of Consideration) have ever been made.</P>
<P><HI>Crown-Point</HI> was a Place of Arms, and so was <HI>Tieonderoga.</HI> These important Passes the <HI>French</HI> forfeited to facilitate their Hostilities against <HI>New-York,</HI> and not for the Sake of Cultivation; accord∣ingly on the Conquest of the Country, few <HI>French</HI> Improvements were found, and those within a nar∣row Compass about the Forts, and for the Conve∣niency of their Garrisons. With these inconsider∣able Exceptions, the Country was a desolate Wil∣derness all along on both Sides of the Lake. 4th. As to the Payment of the Quint or fifth of the original Purchase Money of their respective Seig∣niories, and their having been put into full Seisen in the King's Name; the Canadian Claimants have pointed out no Instances. We may however, venture to affirm that this Assertion, if it relates to the Lands on the South Part of <HI>Lake-Champlain,</HI> cannot be supported; nor, with respect to the rest,
<PB N="206" REF="013102_0203_0F8EC521E2C86B40"/>is it to be presumed that a Governor or any Crown Officer of <HI>Quebec,</HI> would interfere with the Lands or Affairs of the Colony of <HI>New-York.</HI> If such Acts have been performed, in any single Instance, we suppose it concerned Lands near the North End of the Lake, and was only calculated to give some Colour and Countenance to a Claim so ground∣less: Be it as it may, this Government (which on∣ly could rightfully interpose) has had no Agency in any such Acts, and they must therefore be consi∣dered as of no Validity. 5th. The fifth Suggestion,—the Hardship of their having been turned out of Possession by Titles granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> and being further threatened with the same Distress,—is also without Foundation. No <HI>French</HI> Claimant has been evicted, nor has a single Suit of any kind been prosecuted against them. Indeed there could be no Room for it, for as we before observed, since they abandoned their Forts and Settlements, in 1759, there has been no Attempt to re-establish them. Some transient People from that Colony, have been employed on the Lakes in the Lumber Trade, (ei∣ther with Leave of the <HI>New-York</HI> Proprietors, or as mere Trespassers) but we have no Proof of a sin∣gle Improvement or Possession, <HI>since the War,</HI> under a Canadian Grant.</P>
<P>BESIDES all these Objections, it is worth a Re∣mark, that the Petitioners ask what is improper in itself, and, as we humbly conceive, out of the Pow∣er of the Crown to Grant.</P>
<P N="1">1st. THEY aim at enjoying their Seigniories ac∣cording to their original Tenures, which depend on the Laws and Customs of <HI>France.</HI> It is difficult
<PB N="207" REF="013102_0204_0F8EC525F6C18078"/>to comprehend how these Tenures can prevail in this Colony, where such Laws and Usages are un∣known, and where all Estates are held under the Crown upon Quit-Rents, in free and Common Socage as the Manor of <HI>East-Greenwich,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> is held in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Tenure aimed at by the Petitioners, was free from this Objection, it would be a great Sa∣crifice of the Rights of the Crown, which derives a very valuable Revenue from the Quit-Rent of 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> Sterling, upon every Hundred Acres of Land granted in this Colony.</P>
<P>BUT, 2dly. It is presumed that no <HI>present</HI> Act, or Order of the Crown, can have any legal Influ∣ence on the Grants in Question. They must stand or fall by the Rules of Law.</P>
<P>IF the Limits of the <HI>French</HI> Colony of <HI>Canada,</HI> originally extended as far Southward as is now in∣sisted, and if the Articles of the Capitulation and Treaty, operate as a Confirmation of the Canadian Grants, then these Claimants have a good Title at Law: This Question, in a Course of Litigation, will come judically before the King in Privy Coun∣cil, on an Appeal from the Judgments of the Courts of our Province, if either Party should be dissatis∣fied. The Petitioners need not be apprehensive of Partiality, because as a Decision here (upon the Point of Title) is not final, no Injustice can be done but what the Crown will eventually redress. To take up and determine the Matter extra judically, and without hearing the <HI>New-York</HI> Grantees, would
<PB N="208" REF="013102_0205_0F8EC526DB729898"/>not only be premature but inconclusive, for we suppose <HI>a mere exparte Order of the Crown</HI> cannot de∣termine the Title. The Royal Interposition wou'd be very consistent if the Lands had remained un∣patented; but here the Crown in every View hath parted with it's Right.—If the Canadian Principle is just, to them, by the Capitulation and Treaty;—If it is insupportable, then to the <HI>New-York</HI> Grantees under the Great Seal of this Province.</P>
<P>But admitting that the Order of the Crown would be decisive,—that this is an extraordinary Case, which ought not to move or depend upon the nice Principles of Law,—and that the Rules of Equity and Policy ought alone to be consulted. This Issue, we conceive, must be equally favour∣able to the Military Grantees, under <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. WITH respect to the Merits of the different Claimants, the <HI>French</HI> Subjects received their Grants from their Prince, for their Services in an unjust Encroachment upon the British Crown; and in Violation of our original Rights, and of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> The Military, who hold under <HI>New-York,</HI> received their Titles by virtue of his Majesty's Proclamation, and as a Recompence for their Valour, in defence of his just and ancient Dominions. To reward the Aggressors at the Ex∣pence of the King's faithful Subjects, seems incon∣sistent with every Idea of Justice. But it is con∣ceived the Honour of the Crown is engaged to support the Millitary Grants under <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>FOR, 2dly. It would bespeak a Language very
<PB N="209" REF="013102_0206_0F8EC528574CA150"/>different from the Proclamation, and prove, instead of a Reward, a severe Punishment to People who have deserved so much, if his Majesty, after a Set∣tlement of the Limits between the two Colonies,—after so fully signifying that it was his Royal Inten∣tion to give no Confirmation to these Canadian Claims,—after all the Trouble and Expence they have been put to in obtaining their Surveys, and maintaining their Grants, and settling and culti∣vating their Lands,—should now by any Order, question or impeach their Validity; and which must involve them in the utmost Perplexity and Distress.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. To confirm Claims, derived under the Authority of <HI>France,</HI> to the Southward of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> would hold up to the World a strange Picture of the Justice and Equity of the British Court. After engaging in two bloody Wars, and particularly the last in Resentment of such flagrant Encroachments, should it now be admitted that <HI>Canada</HI> extended as it's Advocates al∣ledge, what would be the Inference? Must it not necessarily follow, that the Occupancy of the Lakes, <HI>Crown Point, Tieonderoga,</HI> &amp;c. was no Invasion or Act of Hostility, but the Exertion of a rightful Sovereignty? And consequently, that we were the Aggressors in those Wars, and not the <HI>French;</HI> for nothing less could be implied in the Confirmations sollicited.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> and <HI>Lake George,</HI> open a most important Communication, and may be justly called a Key to the Northern British Colonies
<PB N="210" REF="013102_0207_0F8EC528C3AEE2E8"/>However humbled in the Course of a War, which has crowned <HI>Great-Britain</HI> with unexampled Suc∣cess, it is natural to think the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> will long look with an affectionate Eye towards their former Prince. The Canadian Barons in particu∣lar, lose a flattering Weight and Distinction; while under the Dominion of the <HI>English,</HI> they are sunk into mere Commons. Their Language, their Laws, and their Manners, but above all, their Re∣ligion, must for an Age to come, forbid a cordial Attachment to our Government. They may not be without Hopes that the Fortune of War, be∣tween two powerful and rival Nations, may one Day give <HI>France</HI> such an Ascendency as to reduce us to the Necessity of restoring <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>FROM this View, it must be very impolitic to suffer the <HI>French,</HI> altho' now our Fellow Subjects, to settle on those Lakes, since it will give them the fullest Opportunity of assisting their Countrymen in invading and distressing this and the neighbour∣ing Colonies, and establishing a Footing, on the first Rupture, in the Heart of our Country. On the other Hand, if the fertile Lands surrounding the Lakes, were peopled with the King's natural born Subjects, this Danger, which ought not need∣lessly to be despised, would be avoided; it's ill Consequences be prevented, and the Canadians themselves, even if they should be inclined to re∣volt, would be over awed into Subjection.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all.—If ever <HI>Canada</HI> should be the Subject of a Cession to <HI>France,</HI> what were her ancient Bounds must become a necessary Question? Her original Grants to the Canadians, supported
<PB N="211" REF="013102_0208_0F8EC529953A8260"/>by the Confirmation of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> wold be considered as irresistible Evidence of anci∣ent Right; and thus not only <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> but <HI>Lake George,</HI> which are both interspersed with these Grants, would fall again into the Hands of <HI>France.</HI> The Possibility of an Altercation of this Nature, will be wholly removed by considering the Claims of the Canadians to the Lands on those Lakes, as unworthy of Attention.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, viewing this Subject in every Light, upon the Principles of original Right,—Treaty and Cession,—Law and Justice,—Equity and Policy, it is conceived that the Military and other Grants under the Seal of this Province, ought not to be impeached; and that the Canadian Claims, extravagant in themselves, and destitute of all Foundation, ought to be rejected.</P>
