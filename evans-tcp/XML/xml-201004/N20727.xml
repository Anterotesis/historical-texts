<HEAD>THE LIFE OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 11th of February (old style) 1732, at the parish of Washington, in Westmoreland county, in Virginia. His father's family was numerous, and he was the first fruit of a second marri∣age. His education having been princi∣pally conducted by a private tutor. At fifteen years old he was entered a mid∣shipman on board of a British vessel of war stationed on the coast of Virginia, and his baggage prepared for embarka∣tion: but the plan was abandoned on account of the reluctance his mother ex∣pressed to his engaging in that profession.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027221_0005_0FD58E58C96B6468"/>
Previous to this transaction, when he was but ten years of age, his father died, and the charge of the family devolved on his eldest brother, a young man of the most promising talents, who had a com∣mand in the colonial troops employed a∣gainst Carthagenia, and on his return from the expedition, named his new pa∣trimonial mansion MOUNT VERNON, in in honour of the admiral of that name, from whom he had received many civil∣ities. He was afterwards made Adjutant General of the Virginia militia, but did not long survive. At his discease (not∣withstanding there are heirs of an elder branch who possess a large moiety of the paternal inheritance) the eldest son by second marriage inherited this seat and a considerable landed property. In conse∣quence of the extensive limits of the co∣lony, the vacant office of Adjutant Gen∣eral was divided into three districts, and the <HI>future Hero of America,</HI> before he at∣tained his twentieth year, began his mil∣itary service by an appointment in that department, with the rank of major.</P>
<P>When he was little more than twenty one years of age, an event occurred which
<PB N="7" REF="027221_0006_0FD58E7B9EE58008"/>called his abilities into public notice. In 1753, while the government of the col∣ony was administered by lieutenant go∣vernor Dinwiddie; encroachments were reported to have been made by the French, from Canada, on the territories of the British colonies, at the westward. Young Mr. Washington, who was sent with plenary powers to ascertain the facts, treat with the savages, and warn the French to desist from their aggressions, performed the duty of his mission with singular industry, intelligence and ad∣dress. His journal, and report to gov∣ernor Dinwiddie, which were published, announced to the world that correctness of mind, manliness in style, and accura∣cy in the mode of doing business, which have since characterised him in the con∣duct of more arduous affairs. But it was deemed, by some, an extraordinary cir∣cumstance that so juvenile and inexperi∣enced a person should have been employ∣ed on a negociation, with which subjects of the greatest importance were involv∣ed: subjects, which shortly after became the origin of a war between England and
<PB N="8" REF="027221_0007_0FD58E5A8397A998"/>France, that raged for many years through∣out every part of the globe.</P>
<P>As the troubles still subsisted on the frontiers, the colony of Virginia raised, the next year, a regiment of troops for their defence. Of this corpse, Mr. Fry, one of the professors of the college, was appointed colonel, and Major Washing∣ton received the commission of Lieuten∣ant Colonel. But Colonel Fry died the same summer, without ever having join∣ed; and of course left his regiment and rank to the second in command. Colo∣nel Washington made indefatigable ef∣forts to form the regiment, establish ma∣gazines, and open roads so as to pre-oc∣cupy the advantageous post at the con∣fluence of the Alleghany and Mononga∣hela rivers, which he had recommended for that purpose in his reports the pre∣ceeding year. He was to have been join∣ed by a detachment of independent re∣gulars from the southern colonies, toge∣ther with some companies of provincials from North-Carolina and Maryland. But he perceived the necessity of expe∣dition, and without waiting for their ar∣rival, commenced his march in the month
<PB N="9" REF="027221_0008_0FD58E7CC0788B60"/>of May. Notwithstanding his precipita∣ted advance, on his ascending the Lau∣rel-hill, fifty miles short of his object, he was advised that a body of French had already taken possession and erected a for∣tification, which they named fort <HI>du Ques∣ne.</HI> He then fell back to a place known by the appellation of <HI>the Great Mea∣dows,</HI> for the sake of forage and supplies. Here he built a temporary stockade, merely to cover his stores; it was from its fate called fort <HI>Necessity.</HI> His force when joined by Captain M'Kay's regu∣lars, did not amount to four hundred effectives. Upon receiving information from his scouts that a considerable party was approaching to reconnoitre his post, he sallied and defeated them. But in return he was attacked by an army, com∣puted to have been fifteen hundred strong, and after a gallant defence, in which more than one third of his men were killed and wounded, was forced to capitulate. The garrison marched out with the honours of war, but were plun∣dered by the Indians, in violation of the articles of capitulation. After this dis∣aster, the remains of the Virginia re∣glment
<PB N="10" REF="027221_0009_0FD58E5BCCF90798"/>returned to Alexandria to be re∣cruited and furnished with necessary sup∣plies.</P>
<P>In the year 1755, the British govern∣ment sent to this country General Brad∣dock, who, by the junction of two ve∣teran regiments from Ireland, with the independent and provincial corps in America, was to repel the French from the confines of the English settlements. Upon a royal arrangement of rank, by which "no officer who did not <HI>immedi∣ately</HI> derive his commission from the king, could command one who did, "Colonel Washington relinquished his regiment, and went as an extra Aid-de-Camp into the family of General Braddock. In this capacity, at the battle of Monon∣gahela, he attended that General, whose, life was gallantly sacrificed in attempting to extricate his troops from the fatal am∣buscade into which his over-weening con∣fidence had conducted them. Braddock had several horses shot under him, be∣fore he fell himself; and there was not on officer whose duty obliged him to be on hors back that day, excepting Colo∣nel Washington, who was not other killed or wounded. This circumstance
<PB N="11" REF="027221_0010_0FD58E61F404F4A0"/>enabled him to display greater abilities in covering the retreat and saving the wreck of the army, than he could otherwise have done. As soon as he had secured their passage over the ford of the Monon∣gahela, and found they were not pursued, he hallened to concert measuers for their further security with Colonel Dunbar, who had remained with the second divi∣sion and heavy baggage at some distance in the rear. To effect this, he travelled with two guides, all night, through an almost impervious wilderness, notwith∣standing the fatigues he had undergone in the day, and notwithstanding he had so imperfectly recovered from sickness that he was obliged in the morning to be supported with cushions on his horse. The public accounts in England and America were not parsimonious of ap∣plause for the essential service he had rendered on so trying an occasion.</P>
<P>Not long after this time, the regulation of rank, which had been so injurious to the Coloniel officers, was changed to their satisfaction, in consequence of their dis∣content and the remonstrance of Colonel Washington; and the supreme authority
<PB N="12" REF="027221_0011_0FD58E633874B2A0"/>of Virginia, impressed with a due sense of his merits, gave him, in a new and extensive commission, the command of all the troops raised, and to be raised in that colony.</P>
<P>It would not comport with the intend∣ed brevity of this sketch, to mention in detail the plans he suggested or the syst∣em he pursued for defending the fron∣tiers, until the year 1758, when he com∣manded the van brigade of Gen. Forbes's army in the capture of Fort du Quesne. A similar reason will preclude the recital of the personal hazards and atchievements which happened in the course of his ser∣vice. The tranquility on the frontiers of the middle colonies having been restored by the success of this campaign, and the health of Colonel Washington having be∣come extremely debilitated by a inveterate pulmonary complaint, in 1759 heresigned his appointment. Authentic documents are not wanting to shew the tender regret which the Virginia line expressed at par∣ting with their commander, and the af∣fectionate regard which he entertained for them.</P>
<P>His health was gradually re-established.
<PB N="13" REF="027221_0012_0FD58E81925BA178"/>He married Mrs. Custis,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General and Mrs. Washington were both born in the same year.</NOTE> a handsome and amiable young widow, possessed of an ample jointure; and settled as a plan∣ter and farmer on the estate where he of∣ten resides in Fairfax county. After some years he gave up planting tobacco, and went altogether into the farming busi∣ness. He has raised seven thousand bu∣shels of wheat and ten thousand bushels of Indian corn in one year. Although he has confined his own cultivation to this domestic tract of about nine thou∣sand acres, yet he poflesses excellent lands in large quantities, in several o∣ther counties. His judgment in the qualities of soils, his command of mo∣ney to avail himself of purchases, and his occasional employment in early life as a surveyor, gave him opportunities of making advantageous locations; many of which are much improved.</P>
<P>After he left the army until the year 1775, he thus cultivated the arts of peace. He was constantly a member of Assem∣bly, a magistrate of his county, and a
<PB N="14" REF="027221_0013_0FD58E64D37A38A8"/>judge of the court. He was elected a de∣legate to the first Congress in 1774; as well as to that which assembled the year following. Soon after the war broke out he was appointed by Congress comman∣der in chief of the forces of the United Colonies.</P>
<P>It is the less necessary to particularise in this place his transactions in the late war, because the impression which they made is yet fresh in every mind. But it is hoped posterity will be taught, in what manner he transformed an undisciplined body of pea∣santry into a regular army of soldiers. Com∣mentaries on his campaigns would un∣doubtedly be highly interesting and in∣structive to future generations. The conduct of the first campaign, in com∣pelling the British troops to abandon Boston by a bloodless victory, will mer∣it a minute narration. But a volumn would scarcely contain the mortifications he experienced and the hazards to which he was exposed in 1776 and 1777, in con∣tending against the prowess of Britain, with an inadequate force. His good des∣tiny and consumate prudence prevented want of success from producing want of
<PB N="15" REF="027221_0014_0FD58E82B9DF5E60"/>confidence on the part of the public; for want of success is apt to lead to the adop∣tion of pernicious counsels through the levity of the people or the ambition of their demagogues. Shortly after this pe∣riod sprang up the only cabal that ever existed during his public life, to rob him of his reputation and command. It pro∣ved as impotent in effect as it was auda∣cious in design. In the three succeeding years the germ of discipline unfolded; and the resources of America having been called into co-operation with the land and naval armies of France, pro∣duced the glorious conclusion of the campaign in 1781. From this time the gloom began to disappear from our po∣litical horizon, and the affairs of the U∣nion proceeded in a meliorating train, until a peace was most ably negociated by our ambassadors in Europe, in 1783.</P>
<P>No person who had not the advantage of being present when General Wash∣ington received the intelligence of peace, and who did not accompany him to his domessic retirement, can describe the re∣lief which that joyful event brought to his labouring mind, or the supreme sat∣isfaction
<PB N="16" REF="027221_0015_0FD58E663604C410"/>with which he withdrew to pri∣vate life. From his triumphal entry into New-York, upon the evacuation of that city by the British army, to his arrival at Mount Vernon, after the resigna∣tion of his commission to Congress, festive crowds impeded his passage through all the populous towns, the devotion of a whole people pursued him with prayers to Heaven for blessings on his head, while their gratitude sought the most expressive language of manifest∣ing itself to him, as their common fa∣ther and benefactor. When he became a private citizen he had the unusual feli∣city to find that his native state was a∣mong the most zealous in doing justice to his merits; and that stronger demon∣strations of affectionate esteem (if possi∣ble) were given by the citizens of his neighbourhood, than by any other de∣scription of men on the continent. But he has constantly declined accepting any compensation for his services, or provision for the augmented expences which have been incurred by him in con∣sequence of his public employment, al∣though proposals have been made in the
<PB N="17" REF="027221_0016_0FD58E8451A5E9F0"/>most delicate manner, particularly by the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>The virtuous simplicity which distin∣guishes the private life of Gen. Wash∣ington, though less known than the daz∣ling splendour of his military atchiev∣ments; is not less edifying in example, or worthy the attention of his country∣men. The conspicuous character he has acted on the theatre of human affairs, the uniform dignity with which he sus∣tained his part amidst difficulties of the most discouraging nature, and the glory of having arrived through them at the hour of triumph, have made many offi∣cial and literary persons, on both sides of the ocean, ambitious of a correspond∣ence with him. These correspondencies unavoidably engross a great portion of his time; and the communications con∣tained in them, combined with the numerous periodical publications and news-papers which he peruses, render him, as it were, the <HI>focus of political in∣telligence for the new world.</HI> Nor are his conversations with well informed men less conducive to bring him ac∣quainted with the various events which
<PB N="18" REF="027221_0017_0FD58E6ACE34EAC8"/>happen in different countries of the globe. Every foreigner of distinction, who travels in America, makes it a point to visit him. Members of Con∣gress and other dignified personages do not pass his house, without calling to pay their respects. As another source of information it may be mentioned, that many literary productions are sent to him annually by their authors in Eu∣rope; and that there is scarcely one work written in America, on any art, science, or subject, which does not seek his protection, or which is not offered to him as a token of gratitude. Me∣chanical inventions are frequently sub∣mitted to him for his approbation, and natural curiosities presented for his in∣vestigation. But the multiplicity of epistolary applications, often on the re∣mains of some business which happened when he was commander in chief, some∣times on subjects foreign to his situation, frivolous in their nature, and intended merely to gratify the vanity of the wri∣ters by drawing answers from him is truly distressing and almost incredible. His benignity in answering, perhaps,
<PB N="19" REF="027221_0018_0FD58E872CDC5060"/>encreases the number. Did he not husband every moment to the best ad∣vantage, it would not be in his power to notice the variety of subjects that claim his attention. Here a minuter description of his domestic life may be expected.</P>
<P>To apply a life, at best but short, to the most useful purposes; he lives as he ever has done, in the unvarying habits of regularity, temperance and industry. He rises, in winter as well as in summer at the dawn of day; and generally reads or writes some time before breakfast. He breakfasts about seven o'clock, on three small Indian hoe-cakes and as many dishes of tea. He rides immediately to his different farms, and remains with his labourers until a little past two o'clock, when he returns and dresses. At three he dines, commonly on a single dish, and drinks from half a pint to a pint of Madeira wine. This, with one small glass of punch, a draught of beer, and two dishes of tea (which he takes half an hour before sun-setting) consti∣tates his whole sustenance until the next day. Whether there be company or not,
<PB N="20" REF="027221_0019_0FD58E6D013B3B38"/>the table is always prepared by its ele∣gance and exuberance for their recep∣tion; and the General remains at it for an hour after dinner, in familiar con∣versation and convivial hilarity. It is then that every one present is called up∣on to give some absent friend as a toast; the name not unfrequently awakens a pleasing remembrance of past events, and gives a new turn to the animated colloquy. General Washington is more chearful than be was in the army. Al∣though his temper is rather of a serious cast, and his countenance commonly carries the impression of thoughtfulness, yet he perfectly relishes a pleasant story, an unafected sally of wit, or a burlesque description which surprises by its sud∣denness and incongruity with the ordi∣nary appearance of the object described. After this sociable and innocent relaxa∣tion, he applies himself to business; and about nine o'clock retires to rest. This is the <HI>rotinc,</HI> and this the hour he ob∣serves, when no one but his family is present; at other times he attends po∣litely upon his company until they wish to withdraw. He keeps a pack of
<PB N="21" REF="027221_0020_0FD58E6E78BAA4E0"/>hounds, and in the season indulges him∣self with hunting once in a week; at which diversion the gentlemen of Alex∣andria often assist.</P>
<P>Agriculture is the favourite employ∣ment of Generel Washington, in which he wishes to pass the remainder of his days. To acquire and communicate prac∣tical knowledge, he corresponds with Mr. Arthur Young, who has written so sensibly on the subject, and also with many agricultural gentlemen in this coun∣try. As improvement is known to be his passion, he receives envoys with rare seeds and results of new projects from every quarter. He likewise makes co∣pious notes, relative to his own experi∣ments, the state of the seasons, the na∣ture of the soils, the effects of different kinds of manure, and such other topics as may throw light on the farming busi∣ness.</P>
<P>On Saturday in the afternoon, every week's reports are made by all his over∣seers, and registered in books kept for that purpose: so that at the end of the year, the quantity of labour and pro∣duce may be accurately known. Order
<PB N="22" REF="027221_0021_0FD58E7055891790"/>and oeconomy are established in all the departments within and without doors. His lands are enclosed in lots of equal dimensions, and crops are assigned to each for many years. Every thing is un∣dertaken on a great scale; but with a view to introduce or augment the culture of such articles as he conceives will be∣come most beneficial in their consequences to the country. He has, in one year raised two thousand lambs, sowed twenty seven bushels of flaxseed, and planted more than seven hundred bushels of potatoes. In the mean time, the public may rest per∣suaded that there is manufactured under his roof, linen and wollen cloth, nearly or quite sufficient for the use of his nu∣merous houshold.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF GENERAL MONTGOMERY.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL Montgomery descend∣ed from a respectable family in the North of Ireland, and was born in the year 1737. His attachment to liberty was innate, and matured by a fine edu∣cation and an excellent understanding. Having married a wife, and purchased an estate in New-York, he was, from these circumstances, as well as from his natural love of freedom, and from a con∣viction of the justness of her cause, indu∣ced to consider himself as an American. From principle, he early embarked in her cause, and quitted the sweets of easy
<PB N="26" REF="027221_0025_0FD58E7756DD31F8"/>fortune, the enjoyment of a loved and philosophical rural life, with the highest domestic felicity, to take an active share in all the hardships and dangers that at∣tend the soldiers life.</P>
<P>Before he came over to America, he had been an officer in the service of En∣gland, and had successfully fought her battles with the immortal Wolfe at Que∣bec, in the war of 1756, on the very spot, where, when fighting under the standard of freedom, he was doomed to fall in arms against her. No one who fell a martyr to freedom in this unnatu∣ral contest, was more sincerely, or more universally lamented. And what is ex∣traordinary, the most eminent speakers in the British parliament, forgetting for the moment, that he had died in oppo∣sing their cruel and oppressive measures, displayed all their eloquence in praising his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great orator, and a veteran fellow soldi∣er of his in the French war of 1756, shed abundance of tears, while he expa∣tiated on their past friendship and mutu∣al exchange of tender services in that season of enterprise and glory.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="027221_0026_0FD58E8D41D00128"/>
All enmity to this veteran soldier ex∣pired with his life; and respect to his private character prevailed over all other considerations. By the orders of Gen∣ral Carlton, his dead body received eve∣ry possible mark of distinction from the victors, and was interred in Quebec, on the first day of January, 1776, with all the honours due to a brave soldier.</P>
<P>Congress were not unmindful of the merit of this amiable and brave officer, nor remiss in manifesting the esteem and respect they entertained for his memory. Considering it not only as a tribute of gratitude justly due to the memory of those who had peculiarly distinguished themselves in the glorious cause of liber∣ty, to perpetuate their names by the most durable monuments erected to their ho∣nour, but greatly conducive to inspire posterity with emulation of their illustri∣ous actions, that honourable body▪</P>
<P>"<HI>Resolved,</HI> That to express the vene∣ration of the United Colonies for their late General, RICHARD MONTGOMERY, and the deep sense they entertain of the many singnal and important services of that gallant officer, who, after a series
<PB N="28" REF="027221_0027_0FD58E7837044E08"/>of successes, amidst the most discourag∣ing difficulties, fell at length in a gallant attack upon Quebec, the capital of Can∣nada; and to transmit to future ages, as examples truly worthy of imitation, his patriotism, conduct, boldness of enter∣prise, insuperable perseverance, and con∣tempt of danger and death; a monument be procured from Paris, or other parts of France, with an inscription sacred to his memory, and expressive of his amia∣ble character, and heroic atchievments, and that the Continental treasures be directed to advance a sum not exceeding 300<ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling, to Dr. Franklin, who is desired to see this resolution properly executed, for defraying the expence thereof."</P>
<P>This resolve was carried into execu∣tion at Paris, by that ingenious artist, Mr. Caffiers, sculptor to the king of France, under the direction of Dr. Frank∣lin. The monument is of white marble, of the most beautiful simplicity, and inex∣pressible elegance, with emblamatical devices, and the following truly classical inscription, worthy of the modest, but great mind of a Franklin.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="027221_0028_0FD58E93741A1AB0"/>
TO THE GLORY OF RICHARD MONTGOMERY, Major General of the armies of the United States of America, Slain at the siege of Quebec, the 31st of December, 1775, aged 38 years.</P>
<P>This elegant monument has lately been erected in front of St. Paul's church in New-York.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable circumstance connected with the fall of this brave offi∣cer, that merits to be recorded, because the fact is of a very interesting nature, and will serve to perpetuate the memory of a very amiable and deserving charac∣ter, who was also a martyr in the cause of his country. The circumstance is this:</P>
<P>One of General Montgomery's Aides∣de-Camp, was Mr. Macpherson, a most promising young man, whose father resid∣ed at Philadelphia, and was greatly distin∣guished in privateering in the war of 1756. This gentleman had a brother in the 16th regiment, in the British service, at the time of Montgomery's expedition into Cana∣da, and who was as violent in favour of
<PB N="30" REF="027221_0029_0FD58E31ECF16EA0"/>the English government, as this Gene∣ral's Aid-de-Camp was enthusiastic in the cause of America; the latter had ac∣companied his General a day or two previous to the attack in which they both lost their lives, to view and medi∣ate on the spot where Wolf had fallen; on his return he found a letter from his brother, the English officer, full of the bitterest reproaches against him, for hav∣ing entered into the American service, and containing a pretty direct wish, that if he would not abandon it, he might meet with the deserved fate of a rebel. The Aid-de-Camp immediately returned him an answer, full of strong reasoning in defence of his conduct, but by no means attempting to shake the opposite princi∣ples of his brother, and not only free from acrimony, but full of expressions of tenderness and affection; this letter he dated, "From the spot where Wolfe lost his life, in fighting the cause of En∣gland, <HI>in friedship with America.</HI>" This letter had scarcely reached the officer at New-York, before it was followed by the news of his brother's death. The effect was instantaneous, nature, and per∣haps
<PB N="31" REF="027221_0030_0FD58E94EA643410"/>reason prevailed; and a thousand, not unworthy sentiments rushed upon his distressed mind; he quitted the En∣glish service, entered into that of Ameri∣ca, and sought every occasion of distin∣guishing himself in her service!</P>

<L><HI>And music fills the glades.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Enraptur'd with the distant view,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Youth thinks its fictious beauties true,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And springs the prize to gain;</HI></L>
<L><HI>His grasp the gay illusion flies;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Experience thus the cheat descries,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And proves his hopes were vain.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L><HI>The path of life though flowers adorn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet often will the rugged thorn</HI></L>
<L><HI>Amidst the flowers rise;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Expect not then on earth to share</HI></L>
<L><HI>Enjoyments unallay by care,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But seek it in the skies.</HI></L>

<HEAD>ON GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>GREAT without pomp, without ambition brave—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Proud, not to conquer fellow men, but save—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Friend to the weak—a foe to none but those,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who plan their greatness on their breth∣ren's woes—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Aw'd by no titles—undefil'd by lust—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Free without faction, obstinately just—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Too wise to learn, from Machiavel's school,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That truth and perfidy by turns should rule.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Warm'd by Religion's sacred, genuine ray,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which points to future bliss, th' unerring way;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet ne'er controul'd by Superstition's laws,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The worst of tyrants in the noblest cause.</HI></L>

<HEAD>An Epitaph on a poor, but honest man.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>STOP, reader, here, and deign a look</L>
<L>On one without a name;</L>
<L>Ne'er enter'd in the ample book</L>
<L>Of fortune, or of fame:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Studious of peace, he hated strife,</L>
<L>Meek virtues fill'd his breast;</L>
<L>His coat of arms, "A spotless life"—</L>
<L>"An honest heart," his crest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quarter'd therewith was innocence;</L>
<L>And thus his motto ran:</L>
<L>"A conscience void of all offence</L>
<L>Before both God and man."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the great day of wrath, tho' pride</L>
<L>Now scorns his pedigree;</L>
<L>Thousands shall wish they'd been ally'd</L>
<L>To this great family.</L>

<HEAD>FEDERAL PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>FATHER of all! Thou who rulest the armies of Heaven above; look down upon us we beseech thee, and bless all or∣ders of men in this lower world. In a particular manner we pray for our own country: Bless the Congress of these United States, and all our rulers; May they rule wisely, love mercy, and do justice at all times. Unite us more and more we be∣seech thee; lead us in the right way, and make us a great and a happy people.</P>
<P>Bless all religious orders of men, O our heavenly Father! enlighten their minds, subdue superstition, and grant that they may all unite to worship thee in truth, with one heart and one voice.</P>
<P>Send discord far from us, we beseech thee, both from church and state, and give us hearts of unity and peace. Hast∣en the happy time when thy will shall be done here on earth, as it is done in Hea∣ven: When sin and sorrow shall be no more: When all the inhabitants of the earth shall be blessed; and join in songs of praise to thee the only wise God, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
