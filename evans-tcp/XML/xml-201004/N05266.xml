<HEAD>A SHORT HISTORY OF A Long Travel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Days of my Youth, when I lived at Home in my Father's House, I heard many People talk of the House of God; and that whosoever did attain to get into it, did en∣joy all manner of Happiness, both in this World, and that which is to come. And a great Desire kindled in me, if it was possible, to get into the House; but I knew not where it was, neither did they that talk'd of it: But they had heard the Re∣port, and they had reported what they had heard. There were also some Books that had been written by Men that had been in that House: which Books did declare much of the Joy and Felicity they had in that House: Which Books I got, and Read them over and over, which did much strengthen my Belief in the Truth of the Reports; but by no means could I tell which was my Way. Yet so ardent were my desires, that I thought my self willing to forsake my Father's House, and country and all, to Travel any where,
<PB N="4" REF="006656_0003_1029757D73C78610"/>wherever my Legs could carry me, so I might find this House.</P>
<P>And upon a Time I was breaking my Mind to a Friend of mine upon this Subject, who really told me, there were Men appointed in every Place, to Guide them that were willing to go thither; and it was their Business, and they had nothing else to do. When I heard this I was Comforted; and desired him if he loved me, to bring me Ac∣quainted with one of these Men.</P>
<P>He told me he would, which he did; and when I came to Treat with the Man, and let him know the fervent Desire I had to get to the House of God, which I had heard such Excellent Things of; and that I heard he was one Appointed to Guide any thither, that were willing to go. He very readily Answered, and told me it was his Business to Guide any thither that were willing to go, and to perswade Folks that were not yet willing to go; and if I would comply with his Terms, and follow him, he would lead me thither.</P>
<P>I asked him what his Terms were; he said, the Way was long, and would lead him from his Home, and I must bear his Charges, and some∣thing over.— To all which I agreed; so we set forward on our Journey early in the Morning; but before we had gone one Days Journey, I saw my Guide sometimes stand still and look about him; and sometimes would pull a little Book out of his Pocket, and read a little to himself; which made me begin to mistrust, that he knew the Way no better than I. However I said nothing, but went on, following him several Days Journey after this manner; and the further he went the
<PB N="5" REF="006656_0004_1029757F0E09A4A8"/>more my Guide was at a lost; and went sometimes a little on, and then would look about him, and then turn another Way, and sometimes right back again for a while, and then turn again. So my Suspicion grew very strong, and I began to be in great Anxiety of Spirit, but said little to him about it.</P>
<P>But one day as we were Travelling along, we met with a Man that took Notice of my sad Coun∣tenance, and tired Condition, and he spoke very kindly to me, <HI>Young Man, whether art thou Bound?</HI> And when I began to tell him something of my Journey, he desired me to sit down upon the Grass, in a shady Place, and Discourse a little a∣bout my Journey, and so we did, and I told him how things had gone with me to that very hour. And whilst I was telling him the Story, my Guide fell asleep; at which I was not sorry, for thereby I had the more freedom to Discourse with the Man; and when I had told him all, he pittied me, and withal told me, to his certain Knowledge this Guide of mine had never been at the House, neither did know the way to it, but as he had got some marks of the way, which he had receiv'd, as I or another may do, and if I followed him all my Days, I should be never the nearer to it, and should find at last, I had spent my Time, Money and La∣bour, to no purpose.</P>
<P>This Discourse did so astonish me, that I was at my wits end, and did not know what Course to take. The Man seeing what an Agony I was in, began to Comfort me, and told me that the House I sought was nearer than I was aware of; and if I would forsake that Guide, and follow him, he
<PB N="6" REF="006656_0005_1029758212EA8B68"/>would soon bring me in sight of that House. Quoth he, I am one that belongs to that House, and have done so several Years; and whereas, said he, thou art to bear his Charges, and give him Money besides, I will assure thee it is not the man∣ner of the Guides that belong to this House of God to take Money for Guiding People thither, I my self have been a Guide to many a one in my Time, but never took one Penny of them for it.</P>
<P>By this time you may think within your selves, how my drooping Spirits were Comforted, and a new Hope springing, and a Resolution to forsake my wandering Guide, and to follow this New one.</P>
<P>Upon which, I awaked my Guide, and told him my Mind, and Paid him what I had agreed for, And Advised him never to serve poor Soul as he had done me; for I see, said I, thou knowest not the way, but as thou hast learned in some Books of it. If Book-Learning would have served my turn to have found this famous House, I needed not thee, nor any body else to have guided me to it, for there are but very few that have written expe∣rimentally of it; but I have Read them diligent∣ly; but now I have met with a Man, that I judge has more experience of the way than thou hast, and I am resolved to go with him; and if thou wilt honestly confess thy Ignorance, and go along with us, come and welcome, one Guide will serve two Travellers as well as one in the way; but I could not perswade him, so I left him to take his own way as he pleased.</P>
<P>So I set forward with my new Guide pretty chearfully, and he entertained me with a good deal of Discourse by the way, and we went on in
<PB N="7" REF="006656_0006_102975851F216FC8"/>pretty smooths Paths, and without stopping, and he told me in a short Time, we should come in sight of the House, which made my Travel the easier; and he also told me something of the Rules and Orders of the House, at which I was not at all Discouraged; for I considered, God was a God of Order, and I doubted not but there was good Orders in his House, to which I was willing to submit.</P>
<P>And as we were thus Travelling along, he of a sudden spake to me, saying yonder is the House; at which I was exceeding glad, for now I thought I had not spent my Labour in vain, and the nearer we grew to it, the more my Joy encreased; and when I came in view of it, I pleased my self ex∣treamly with looking at it, and viewing the Tow∣ers and Turrets that were upon it, and the excel∣lent Carvings and Paintings with which it was a∣dorned; and there was as much of Art in setting it forth, as could be imagined. Oh! thought I, if there be so much Glory without, surely there is more within, which I shall shortly be a Partaker of.</P>
<P>And as I was thus Contemplating my Happi∣ness, and was come within as it were a Bow shot of the House, we were to go down into a Valley, which we did, and in the Bottom of the Valley glided a long small River, and I looked about to see for a Bridge to go over it, but could see none; at which I wondered; but on we went till we came to the River side, then I asked my Guide where the Bridge was; truly he told me there was none, but we must go thro' it, and so must all that go into that House.
<PB N="8" REF="006656_0007_102975886C82B6E0"/>I was a little troubled with my self, but he told me he had been through it, and there was no Dan∣ger at all. With that I began to think within my self, have I taken all this Pains, and shall give over for so small a matter as this is; what would I have gone through when in my Father's House, to attain to the Knowledge of the House of God, and a Possession therein; not Water nor verily Fire would have stopt me then, if I had had so fair a Prospect of it as now I have.</P>
<P>I told my Guide, if he pleased to go before, I would follow him; so in he went, and I after him; but when I came at the middle, there it was so deep, that the Water went over my Head but I made shift to keep my Feet to the ground, and got well out on the other side; and my Guided and I went up together very pleasantly; and when we came to the top of the Hill, there was a wide Plain, and in the middle thereof the House stood. So we went apace, and drew near to it, and there I saw a very stately Porch at the West end of the House, and at the Door stood a strong tall Porter, to whom my Guide spake, and said to him on this wise.</P>
<P>This Young Man hath long had a Desire to be Entertained in the House of God, thereupon I have conducted him hither; the Porter asked him which way I came thither? He said through the River, and I don't remember he asked him any more Questions, but bid me welcome, and let me into the House, and my Guide went in with me, through many turnings and windings into a great Hall; mine Eyes went to and fro as I went about the House, and in the great Hall there I saw
<PB N="9" REF="006656_0008_1029758B77AE12F8"/>many People, they bid me welcome, but none knew the Anguish of my Soul; for I began to Question, whether I was not again beguiled, for I found the House foul and Dirty, almost in every Part, and so belined with Spiders and Cobwebs, that I thought in my self it had never been Swept clean since it was Built; and some things I met withal that displeased me yet worse, as ye shall hear; howbeit a good Bed was provided for me to Rest upon if I could; and I having little Stomack, af∣ter I saw how it was made ready, I went to Bed, and disposed my self to Sleep what I could, but alas Sleep departed from me, and my Spirits were grievously vexed, and my Cogitations were many, and grievous; sometimes I thought of the Paintings without, and how that Suited not with the Dirti∣ness that was within; and if I was deceived, what Course I should take,</P>
<P>After a long and tedious thinking, I pleased my self with this, it may be better To-morrow, so I fell into a Slumber a pretty while. In the Mor∣ning before I Rose, I heard two or three Contend∣ind about some Accounts, in which one laid Fraud to the others Charge; the other, instead of vindi∣cating himself, fell a twitting him in the Teeth with something of the like kind; they grew hot in Words, so that they threatened to turn each other out of Doors, and drive him back again through the River, and never suffer him to come into the House any more.</P>
<P>My Heart was ready to burst with Sorrow, and in the Anguish of my Spirit, I Rose and went to them, and told them, I little thought to have found
<PB N="10" REF="006656_0009_1029758FEDA4A588"/>such Doings, or heard such Language in the House of God. I fear, quoth I, I am deceived, and brought in amongst you by a fair Shew, but see not the Glory, Peace and Tranquility.</P>
<P>So I walked away to another Part of the House where I heard a great noise of hard Words, and I drew near, and understood it was about choosing an Officer, and two was striving about it, and each of them had got a Party, and each Party grew hot one against another. As soon as I could be heard, I spake to them, and told them such kind of doings as this, did more resemble a place in the World, called <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> than the House of God.</P>
<P>I went a little further, and there I heard some Women Scolding about taking the upper hand, and about some Fashions in their Cloaths; and others about getting their Childrens Play things from each other. All this and much more than I shall mention, increased my Sorrow: I now began to long to speak with my Guide that brought me thither; and with diligent Search at last I found him, and began with him in this Manner.</P>
<P>Whether hast thou brought me, and where are the Rules and Orders thou toldest me were in the House of God? I have often read of the Beauty, Order, Peace and Purity of the House of God, but here I find nothing but the contrary; I fear thou hast brought me to a wrong House, and hast beguiled me; so I Rehearsed to him what I had met withal. To which he Replied; I must ex∣pect Men have their humane Frailties, and that Men were but Men, and perswaded me to be sa∣tisfied, and make further Trial. And as for the
<PB N="11" REF="006656_0010_1029759173776E28"/>Orders he spake of, they were most about Meats and Drinks, and about Rules for Electing of Of∣ficers to Rule the House of God, as I would see in Time, if I stayed; and as to the Dirtiness of the House, he confessed, them to whom the Care belonged, and was Committed, to keep the House Clean, had not been so Diligent as they ought to have been, but he hoped, upon Admonition, they would be more Careful. To which, I returned this Answer. What! dost thou talk of Humane Fra∣ilties in the House of God? that Complaint is at large in the World, but doth not become the House of God, into which, I have heard none can come, but such as are Redeemed from the Earth, and are washed from their Polutions; for God saith, <HI>all the Vessels in my House shall be Holy;</HI> and they that dwell in the House of God, must have pure Hearts, and clean Hands; and much more I told him of what I heard and read concerning the House of God. And told him plainly, I had let in such a Belief of the Peace, Purity, Glory and Comli∣ness of the House of God, that I was perswaded that was none of it, and where to find it I knew not; but if I never found it while I lived, I would never give over seeking; my Desires were so after it, that I thought nothing would satisfy me short of the Enjoyment of it. But as for your House here I have no Satisfaction in it to be the Place I seek for, so I must leave you.</P>
<P>His Answer was to me, he was sorry I could not be satisfied there as well as he, but if I could not, he would lay no Restraint upon me; for his part, he had directed me as far as he knew, and
<PB N="12" REF="006656_0011_1029759475C050A0"/>he could do no more for me. After our Discourse was ended, I got up and went out, but knew not where to go; several in the House threw things after me in a spiteful manner, but none hurt me; and I wandered sometimes North, and sometimes South, and over every way that came in my Mind; but whithersoever I went, the Anguish of my Soul went along with me, which was more than Tongue or Pen can declare or utter, or any one can be∣lieve; except this Relation should meet with any one that has experienced the same Travel; which if it doth, they will understand it.</P>
<P>But so was, I had no Comfort Night nor Day, but still kept going on, whether Right or Wrong I knew not, nor durst I ask any Body, for fear of being beguiled as before. Thus I got into a vast howling Wilderness, where there seemed to be no way in it, only now and then I found some Men and Women footsteps, which was some Comfort to me in my Sorrow; but whither they got out, without being devoured of Wild Beasts, or whi∣ther I should go I knew not. But in this woeful State I travelled from Day to Day, casting within my self what I had best to do, whether utterly to Dispair in that Condition, or whether I had best to seek some other Town or City, to see if I could get some other Guide. The first I saw to be des∣perate, I also despaired of the last, having been so deceived from Time to Time; so that all these Consultatons did but increase the bitterness of my Soul.</P>
<P>And one Day as I was Travelling in the After∣noon a terrible Storm arose, with Hail and Thun∣der,
<PB N="13" REF="006656_0012_102975960C04D7E0"/>and great Wind, which lasted till Night, and in the Night also. I being weary, both of Body and Mind, lay me down under a great Tree, and alter some Time I fell asleep; and when I waked, and came to my self, it was still very Dark; &amp; look∣ing about, I saw a small Light pretty near me; and it came in my Mind to go to it, and see what it was, and as I went, that went before me.</P>
<P>Then it came into my Mind that I had heard of false Lights, as <HI>Ignis-Fatuus,</HI> and such like, that would lead People out of their Way; then thought I again, how could I be led out of my Way, that knew no way of Safety. And whilst I sate down to let these starving Thoughts have their Course, I took notice, and beheld the Light as near me as at the first, as if it had waited for me. At which I was strongly affected, and thought within my self, may be some good Spirit is come to take pitty of me, and is come to lead me out of this miserable Condition. And so a Resolution arose in my Mind, that I should get up and follow it; concluding in my self, that I could not be brought into a much worse Condition than I was now in. So I arose and followed it, and it went a gentle easie pace at first, and I kept my Eye strait to it; but after∣wards I found a great part of the Luggage &amp; Pro∣vision I had got together, did but burthen me in my Journey; so I threw away one thing, and then an∣other, that I thought I could best spare, but kept a great bundle of Cloaths still by me, not knowing whether I should need them. And as I thus went on and the Light before me, it led me out of the Wilderness, along a plain Champion Country, with∣out
<PB N="14" REF="006656_0013_1029759C031EF340"/>Trees, or Inhabitants; only I perceived as if some few had gone that way, and the Light kept strait in that Path, without any winding or turn∣ing till I came to the Foot of a great Mountain; and going up that great Mountain, I found it hard getting up, and began to consider my great bundle of Cloaths and Garments, and that several of them were in use for a Traveller as I was, and did not know how far I should go, nor whether I should want them, if ever I was so Happy as to attain what I aimed at; nor whether the Fashions would suit the Place I was going to. So I threw away some, and anon other some, till I had none left but what I worn. And as I followed this my Guide, I at last got up to the top of this Mountain, and saw another yet higher; and there I saw a Man; he asked me whither I was going, I told him I could not well tell; but I would tell him whither I desired to go, he said whither, to the House of God? He told me it was that way, but he thought I should never get thither. I asked him why? Why, quoth he, there lieth in yonder Mountain, so many Vipers, Adders, and Serpents, and such Ve∣nemous Beasts, that they devour many People that are going that way. For my part said he, I was going also, but I was so afrighted with those Ve∣nemous Serpents, I was forced to turn back, and so I would have you.</P>
<P>I answered him, Friend, I have for a pretty while taken yonder Light for my Guide, and it hath directed me a long way, and it doth not leave me; look, dost thou see it there before me? He answered yes, I see it; well, said I, I have
<PB N="15" REF="006656_0014_1029759EFB51E5D8"/>heard by Travellers, that if a Man have Fire or Light, the Venemous Beast, cannot hurt him; and I intend to quicken my pace a little, and keep as close to the Light as I can, come go along with me and venture it.</P>
<P>He said it was true, he had heard that Fire would preserve from them, but he thought Light would not. However, for his part, he would not venture his sweet Life amongst them; If would, I might, he wished me well, and so we parted; and I made haste, got up pretty near the Light, and up I went the Second Mountain; and when I came almost to the top of the Mountain, I saw many Serpents Dens, and Vipers Holes, both on the Right Hand, and on the Lift, and they drew near me, and hiss'd at me, and I began to be in great fear, and trembled exceedingly; but many times when they were ready to sting me. the Light would step in, or appear betwixt me and them, and they were afrighted, and run away into their Holes and Dens.</P>
<P>Oh! when I perceived this, how did my heart leap for joy within me, my joy abounded, my fear of the Serpents abated, my Love to my kind and tender Guide increased, and my Courage and Con∣fidence abounded; and I began to believe I was in the Right way to attain my Desire. So on I went, keeping my Eye to the Light, through them all, without harm, till I came to the top of the Mountain; and then I saw an exceeding large Val∣ley, that I could not see to the further side of it; it seemed to be all Moors, and Places of Water, and Boggs and Mire all over the Valley, which began
<PB N="16" REF="006656_0015_102975A085AFFA78"/>again to dishearten me; but thought I, what shall I do; all is well hitherto; I was strangely deliver∣ed from the Serpents, and whatever comes of it, if this Light leave me not, I will follow it, if it be through Fire and Water; and so I kept on, and went down the Mountain a gentle easie pace, and see many of those cruel Creatures by the way, who put out their Stings at me, but none hurt me. And I took Notice, the nearer I kept to the Light, the more they kept from me; so I got down to the bot∣tom of the Mountain, into the large Valley, which was very Green and Pleasant for a little Way; but by and by the Light went towards a great Moorish Ground full of Water, and that I thought was very Dangerous; but when I came just to the side of the Place, I saw a small Narrow Path through the middle of it, just broad enough for a Man to go upon it, and into that Narrow Way the Light lead me, and went before me; and whilst I kept my Eye steady to it, I went on safely; but if at any time I began to gaze about, my Feet slipt into the Mire, and Puddles, and then I had much ado to get into my Way again, had not the Light kindly and tenderly waited for me, I had lost sight of it, and had perished in the way; for sometimes it was so far before me, that I could hardly discern it, &amp; then I would quicken my Diligence, and be more Care∣ful of my Goings, and keep as close to it as I could. So that sometimes the Light shined round about me, and I walked in the shining of it with great fulness of Spirit, and after I had walked a long time in this Narrow Way. I lift up my Eyes, and saw to the further side of the Moorish Valley;
<PB N="17" REF="006656_0016_102975A3852B5188"/>and saw beyond, that there was a very high Moun∣tain, and on the top of that, there was a very great House; at the sight of which I was greatly comforted, supposing that might be the House I had for a long sought.</P>
<P>But after this, I met with another sore Exercise; for there were many I perceived had been Tra∣velling in that Narrow Way, and had fallen into the Mire, some on the Right Hand, and some on the Lift; and they lay wallowing, full of Envy; some by plucing at me, to pull me in; others by throwing Mire and Dirt upon me, to Discourage me: Others would speak very fair, on purpose to draw me into Discourse with them, that whilst I spent my precious Time, I might be cast so far behind, that I might lose that Sight of my good Guide. But I saw their Evil Designs, and was aware of them, keeping on my Narrow Way till I came to the End of the Boggy Valley, and then found Firm Ground under my Feet, to my great Comfort. And I had gone but a little way, and then my Guide the Light went into a Narrow Lane, well Hedged on both sides; at which I was glad, thinking I could not go wrong, and need not now take so very much Care; but alas, I quickly found so many By-Lanes, and Ways, that lay al∣most so strait forward as that I went in; so that if it had not been for the Light which went a little before me, I might certainly gone wrong many time; but by carefully keeping to my good Guide, I got at last up the Mountain, and saw the House again, and discerned a Man, of that Country a pretty way off; and I called to him, Friend, Ho! Friend, pray tell me what is the Name of
<PB N="18" REF="006656_0017_102975A7F91524D8"/>yonder Great House; He told me, the Name of it was <HI>Bethel;</HI> then I presently remembered that that was the Name by which the House of God was called in my Fathers Country, where I had heard the Reports of it, and was so earnestly set to find it out.</P>
<P>Oh! the Joy and Consolation that I felt in my Soul, no Tongue can express it, to think that now after all my Travels, Perils and Disappointments, I had now found that I sought for. So on I went Journying with Joy unspeakable; and as I went I viewed the outside of the House, and that was very large, and had but one Tower, there was no Car∣ved Work about it, nor no Paintings, nor any kind of Device that I could discern, but all the Stones were curiously Joined together from the Top to the Bottom. I also took Notice that all the Stones of the Building were Transparent, some more, and some less, and I saw no Windows to let in Light, from without; and when I drew near to it, it had a large outward Court, and a pretty large Gate to go into it, so that a Man might go into it with a large Burthen on his Back; and when I came at it, in I went, where I saw many People that were very cheerful, and lived very pleasant Lives; and some of them told me they had lived there many Years, and wanted for nothing, for there was a mighty Tree grew in the midst of the Court, and the Fruit thereof was good, and the Leaves also, and they were well contented with it, and it bore Fruit all the Year long; and many of them were so kind as to invite me to sit down and Eat with them, but that I refused; and they shewed me a great Cistern, they had hewn out to them∣selves
<PB N="19" REF="006656_0018_102975A980F4E368"/>to catch Water from the Elements, and they had made themselves convenient Lodgings, in the sides of the Court, to Lodge in; but this did not satisfie me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I saw my beloved Guide pass through them all, and enter in at a little Door at the further side of it; whereupon I left them, and made haste to the Door, wherein I see my Guide had entered, and attempted to enter in thereat, but could not, it was so strait, which put me into great sorrow of Mind, and what to do I knew not, my thoughts troubled me on every side; and all ways I tried, but in vain; Oh! thought I, are all my Troubles and Labours come to this, must I be shut out at the last, what shall I do? And as I was thus perplexing my self, I thought I heard a Voice, but knew not from whence it came, which said, <HI>Young Man, strip thee of thy old Garments, and so thou mayest enter.</HI> This occasioned yet more trouble of Mind, for I was loath to go in Naked; but at last, I thought it better to go in Naked, than not at all. So at last I went to Stripping, think∣ing a few pitiful Rags should not hinder me of so great an Enjoyment. And when I was strip start Naked as ever I was born, I tried to enter, and found great difficulty in it; and so soon as I was entered, one met me, and cast a Garment of pure white Linen over me, which reached down to my Feet; and he brought me into a narrow Room, and said, Rest here a while. And then I lay me down in so much Joy and Comfort, as is impossible to be expressed, all things were so pleasant about me; and my Resting place was so delightful, and my Heart was so fully satisfied, that it overcame me with Songs of Joy; but I found my Business
<PB N="20" REF="006656_0019_102975AC81E40628"/>to be still and quiet in my happy Condition, that I was come for to enjoy.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this Room, before I was called out to see the Beauty and Comliness, of the House: And as I walked, I found every thing so Clean and Bright, that I was ravished in an admi∣rable Manner with it; and I met also with some People that welcomed me to the House of God, with such Kindness as refreshed my Heart; and as I came to be Acquainted with them, I marked their Conversations, and their Discourses were ex∣ceeding Comfortable to me; no Quarrelling, no Contention, no high or hot Words, but all passed with Meekness, and Reverence, and due respect one for the other; the young Men waited for the Words of the Ancients and Fathers, and Virgins carried a reverent respect to the Matrons, and there was an Universal Concord &amp; Unity, so that I won∣dered greatly; &amp; one Day I was opening my Mind to an Ancient, and told him, <HI>I admired much, and wondered greatly at the Universal Concord that I had taken Notice of, beyong all I had met with in my Life.</HI> He said it must needs be so, and could not be otherwise; for that was the Guide which lead me hither, had been the Guide to them all. And further told me, there could be no Contenti∣no but where two Spirits strove for Mastery, but it was not so in this House. His Answer was so full and satisfactory to me, that I said no more to him at that time, but went on, viewing and be∣holding the Order of every thing I saw, till my soul was filled, and I might say, my Cup did over∣flow. So that my former Labours and Disappoint∣ments, Sorrows and Perils did signifie nothing to me, I had a full Reward, a hundred fold.</P>

So I returned to my Rest again, in a Larger Room than before, where I Sung Praises to my God; and setting forth the Praises of the House, and them that dwell therein. And a while after I was called forth of the Room where I was, and told, I was not brought to that Place, only to take pleasure and delight therein, but there was Work to be done, and I must take my part of it, and be faithfull and deligent in what I was set about. To which I answered, it was enough I had attained my desires in being admitted into the Hea∣venly Place; but if there were any Business that I could do, I was willing to do it, be it what it would, for it would be my greatest Joy to do any thing to the Advancement of the Honour of the House of God, and them that dwell therein. Then he that talked with me, told me, it was my Work, to teach the Children so far as I knew and had learn∣ed, and as far as I should from Time to time be further instructed. Indeed I was a little amazed thereat, knowing my Inabilities: But when I had a little pondered that part of the Sentence; that I should be from Time to Time further instructed, I took Courage in my Work, and made some Progress in it with great Fear, and Reverence, waiting daily for those Instructions I was to re∣ceive, and I did receive in an abundant maner; and the work prospered in my Hand, and the Children loved me, and I loved them entirely, as though they had been my own Children; and many of them grew up to a good Understanding, and ob∣served their places and orders, to my great Delight. And after I had thus continued a while, the Elder that talked with me before, came and told me,
<PB N="22" REF="006656_0021_102975B289DA6A48"/>I must take the charge of part of the Houshold, and give them their Meat in due season; and suit every ones Meat, in deviding to every ones State and Condition; <HI>and not to feed strong Men with Milk, or Babes with strong Meat;</HI> and for that Purpose, he gave me a Key that led into the Treasure, or Sore-House; which when I came to see and behold it was abundently filled with all sorts of Nourishments that never could be exhaust∣ed or spent while the World endured.</P>
<P>And after some Time I took out to Distribute daily among the Houshold of God, and the Store House was still full, as at the begining, and so it continues to this day, and for ever.</P>
<P>And having continued a long while in this Hea∣venly Habitation, it comes in my Mind to let my Countrymen the Children of my old Father whom I lest in <HI>Babylon,</HI> hear of me; for I suppose they judge me lost, or devoured; but I could be glad if any, yea all of them were hear to behold, and taste and feel what I do.</P>
<P>And let none of them say, I happen'd better than many can; for I have wandered since I came into this House. The same Light that appeared to me doth appear to any poor distressed Soul in the whole World; but the reason that so few come here, is because they fear the Perils and dangers that are in the Way, more than they love the Light that would lead them thither through them; and so turn aside, and shelter themselves in an Old Rotten Building, that at one time or other will fall on their Heads and they perish in the Ruins.</P>
<P>Now if any one have a mind to know my Name in my Fathers Country; but in this long and te∣dious
<PB N="23" REF="006656_0022_102975B70B1E5FE0"/>Journey I have lost it. but since I came hither, I have a new Name, but I have no Cha∣racters to signify it by, that I can Write, or they can Read. But if any will come where I am, they shall know my Name. But for further Sa∣tisfaction, I was born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> Spiritually call'd and my Father went and lived in <HI>Babylon,</HI> about the Time the true Children of <HI>Isarel</HI> were in Cap∣tivity; there I came acquainted with some of the Stock of the <HI>Jews,</HI> about the time they were re∣turning to their own Land; and they told me wonderfull things of the Glory of the House they had at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and would have had me gone along with them; and amongst the rest, I under∣stood that Solomon with many thousands of Car∣penters and Masons had built it. Upon which I considered, within my self, that if <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the Carpenters and Masons had Built it, Carpen∣ters and Masons might at one time or other pull it down again. So I went not, but sought a City, whose Builder is God: And now I have found it Hallalujah in the Highest, Glory, Honour, and Renown to his Worthy Name, and Power, throughout all Ages and Geanrations, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
