<HEAD>A LETTER Relating to a MEDIUM of TRADE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been the common Complaint, ever since I have been upon the Stage, That the Times are hard and Money scarce. But at this Juncture, there is undoubtedly far more Reason and Truth than ordinarily has been, in the Complaints made upon these Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, specially the latter of them.</P>
<P>But how scarce soever Money (i. e. Bill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Credit, the only Money passing among us) be, yet 'tis obvio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that its Scarcity doth not enhance its Value: For in the Year past, those Gentlemen who from Time to Time have depr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ated our Bills, have given higher for Silver in said Bills, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any former Years.</P>
<P>As the sinking the Credit of our Province Bills, has in a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Measure subverted commutative Justice thro' the Land; so those who have been the Sufferers by it, have been ready to compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of the Legislature, and too rashly to lay the Blame at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I say too rashly, for the State of our Trade and Mercha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> abroad has been such, that unless we could suppose our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chants to act with a due Regard to the publick Weal, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cause of common Justice and Equity, as well as their priv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> personal Gain, 'tis hard to conceive how it could have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Power of any Laws whatsoever to have kept up the Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of our Bills.</P>
<P>It is certain, the Funds upon which they have been emitted, have been sufficient to give them a ready Currency amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Persons for some Years at first were so well satisfied on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Account, that our Bills really were, agreable to the Desig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<PB N="4" REF="004585_0003_100D6A9063E7B238"/>their Emission, equal in Value to lawful Silver Money: And they would undoubtedly have continued of the same Value to this Day, had they not been depreciated by those who have been the Sellers and Buyers of Silver and Gold amongst us.</P>
<P>Whilst the Seller of these has not been content to part with them for Bills of Credit without some Advance, and whilst the Buyer, to serve his present Turn, has yielded to give that Ad∣vance, they have by that Means, in too sound a Sense, been the Clippers of our Coin (i. e. our Bills of Credit) and had the first Hand in all that Injustice and Oppression, which has been the unavoidable Consequence of their Practice herein.</P>
<P>And now what is the great Temptation that has led them into this Practice? 'Tis undoubtedly some Gain to themselves, either real or imaginary. But what real Gain have they ac∣quir'd or could they have in View, which can be thought so tempting, as to lead them into a Practice so pernicious to the Publick, and of so pernicious Consequence in regard of Multi∣tudes, who are in no Capacity to ward off the Wrong they sustain hereby?</P>
<P>As to the Vender of these Commodities, the very Day he got up his Silver (for Instance) from 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 22 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Ounce, he sunk the Bills he receiv'd 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in the Pound. And now, suppose he was One whose Debt did exceed his Credit, though in this Case he might discharge a 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Debt and have 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> left to himself; yet since his Gain was his Creditors Loss, if he be a Man of Justice and Honesty, I should think he can take but little Satisfaction in it.</P>
<P>But this, as I apprehend, has not often been the Case, but the Generality of those who have had Silver to sell, have been such, the Ballance of whose Accompts have been in their own Favour.</P>
<P>Some Years since, a Gentleman who had Silver by him, told me, such a Merchant had been with him to buy, but that upon his holding his Silver at a higher Rate (as I remember 18 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> or 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Oz.) than it had usually pass'd at, they parted, yet nevertheless within a few Days after, the same Merchant sent him Province Bills to exchange with him at his own Price; which hereupon soon became the common Rate at which Silver was sold.</P>
<P>This was a Gentleman free of Debt perhaps as any in the Province, and had not only a large Sum due to him upon Book, but many <HI>Hundreds of Pounds</HI> due upon Bond, payable in Province Bills. And now suppose he gain'd 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Oz. upon his Silver for two or three hundred Ounces, he for that Gain (supposing he rais'd it from 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 22 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Oz.) lost 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Pound upon a Sum perhaps more than <HI>two or three thousand
<PB N="5" REF="004585_0004_100D6A93096B6080"/>Pounds.</HI> And I doubt not but this has been the Case with many others; which when they experience the Truth of, however instrumental they themselves have been in bringing it to pass, they seem to disregard that, and fill their Mouths with Exclamations against the Government, for not keeping up the Credit of their Bills!</P>
<P>And now let us consider the Case of the Buyer. And here, I see not but the Advance he makes, is at present to his own Loss. And the great Reason why he is willing to sustain this Loss, is the Prospect he has of making it up, by setting a pro∣portionable Advance upon either the Goods he has already in his Possession, or those that next come to Hand, or both: And if he make no greater Advance upon these, than barely to make up his Loss, where is his Gain? And if he make a greater, under this Pretence, where is his Honesty.</P>
<P>And now agreable to this Representation, where is the great Gain to either the Seller or Buyer of Silver and Gold, for the Sake of which they should be led (as I said) into this Practice, so pernicious to the Publick, <HI>&amp;c?</HI></P>
<P>And if there be a greater Gain to either, than this Represen∣tation sets in our View, I am perswaded, that if it were care∣fully examined into, it would be found such as will not bear the Light: Nor can I think that those who have acquired it, will be able to take much Satisfaction in it, if they consider, as I think there is Reason they should, That together with their respective Shares thereof, they must share between them, if not the whole, yet a principal Part of the Guilt arising from that Injustice and Oppression, which their Practice hath bro't upon the Widow and the Orphan, and all such who depend on certain Sums in Province Bills annually to be paid for their Subsistance.</P>
<P>In brief, as the Emission of Bills of Credit, which so well serv'd all the Ends of Trade and Commerce amongst ourselves, put it into the Power of the Merchant soon to send off our Silver and Gold, as he did, so his bidding upon the Silver since imported, has I think been the sole Cause of the sinking of the Credit of our Province Bills. And it seems needless and in vain to enquire after any other Cause thereof
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>I am aware of it, that many have freely charg'd the Government with Breach of Faith, in postponing Payments established by Law, and assign'd this as the Reason of the fall of the Credit of our Bills. But if I am not misinform'd, this has Reference only to the Payments of the several Loans that have been granted. With respect to which (as I humbly conceive) it will be difficult to demonstrate any Injustice in the Delays of those Payments, more than there is when a private Person that lets his Money upon Interest, taking Bond for the Payment thereof in one Year, delays putting his Bond in Sute against the Debter imme∣diately, if at that Period he doth not make Payment. But to assign this Indulgence to the Debter whilst he has given good Security, and which remains good and sufficient for the Reco∣very of the Bills and Interest, as any Cause of the sinking the Credit of the Bills so lett, seems not to have so much as the Shadow of a Reason to support it.</HI></NOTE>. And unless,
<PB N="6" REF="004585_0005_100D6A96EFA2FA10"/>agreable to what I before obferv'd, we might suppose that the Sellers and Buyers of Silver and Gold will alter their Practice, and act more upon Principles of Wisdom, Honour and Justice, than they have done, 'twill be but a vain Thing to hope for the Continuance of that Credit our publick Bills at present ob∣tain, nor will it be in the Power of any Laws to support their sinking Credit.</P>
<P>But if once our Merchants, who have the Value of our Bills set by the Legislature, at their Emission, and who have the Ballances in their Hands, and ought to esteem the keeping in∣variable the Medium with which they carry on their Trade, as an essential Basis of their just Commerce, will be prevail'd with to take up and keep inviolate a just Resolution, not to undervalue our Bills by over-rating Silver and Gold, there will be nothing wanting, either in the Funds upon which they have been emitted, or in the Ends and Uses to which they may serve, in order to their being preserved in their full Credit and Value.</P>
<P>And I should think what I have said, together with those further Thoughts, which those who closely attend to Reason, will by these brief Hints, be naturally led into, would be suffi∣cient to induce every Man of Penetration and Virtue to take up and keep this Resolution. And should there be found any, whose earthly Souls can't be made to see an Hair's Breadth be∣yond the Circle of self, and who care nothing for the Good of their Country, nor regard the Injuries and Oppressions their Neighbours sustain, so that their private personal Gain be but secured and advanced; these ought to be discouraged by penal Laws, in their unrighteous Practices.</P>
<P>And as to this Practice of giving or receiving any Advance in Bills of Credit for Silver or Gold more than 5 per Cent. above the Value set upon those Bills by the Legislature at their Emission, I think, Justice requires that they should, upon their
<PB N="7" REF="004585_0006_100D6A9A2D36D440"/>being detected herein, suffer the same Shame and Punishment which they incur, who are convicted of clipping the KING's Coin.</P>
<P>Having premised these general Thoughts, I shall adventure to offer a Scheme for supplying the Province with a Medium of Trade, which may at present relieve the pressing Difficulties under which it labours, prevent those further Oppressions the Inhabitants lie exposed to, and in the Issue introduce a better Medium.</P>
<P>And to these desired Ends, 'tis proposed;</P>
<P N="1">I. That upon the Motion of a sufficient Number of Sub∣scribers, the Great and General Court enact a Law for the Emission of <HI>Two Hundred Thousand Pounds</HI> Bills of Credit of the following Tenor, viz.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P N="2">II. That the said Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Thousand Pounds</HI> thus emitted, be taken out of the Treasury by said Company, each Person receiving the Sum he subscrib'd for, he giving good Security to the Province Treasurer, either Real or Personal, for the Payment of the same at ten equal Payments, <HI>viz.</HI> Ten per Cent. per Annum, in Silver at 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Ounce, or Gold <HI>pro rato.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 'Tis proposed, That the said Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Thou∣sand Pounds</HI> be drawn into the Treasury by Tax upon the Inhabitants of the Province, in ten equal annual Payments, viz. <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds</HI> each Year: The first Payment to be in 1743.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That for the Supply of the Medium, and that the Inha∣bitants may be the better enabled to pay their Tax, 'tis pro∣posed, that at the beginning of each Year, wherein <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds</HI> is drawn into the Treasury by Tax, there be the same Sum emitted upon the Motion of Persons belonging to the Company or others that may be dispos'd to joyn them, to be taken out and paid in by the Company in the same
<PB N="8" REF="004585_0007_100D6A9BB959DAB0"/>Manner the first 200000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> was, and to be drawn in by Tax at the Distance of ten Years from the Emission; in taking out whereof let those that acceed to the Company have the Preference. And let 20,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be thus call'd in by Tax, and the same Sum emitted <HI>ab Anno ad Annum,</HI> so long as the Ge∣neral Court shall think fit.</P>
<P N="5">V. Now upon Supposition these Emissions of 20,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> are continued from 1743 to 1759, inclusive, the State of the Trea∣sury will be this 1760, <HI>viz.</HI> In Silver and Gold receiv'd of the Company to the amount of 450000 Ounces of Silver. In Silver and Gold due from the Company, to the Amount of 90000 Oz. and the Bills outstanding will be 200000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="6">VI. 'Tis propos'd, That the abovesaid Silver and Gold, as it comes in, be let out upon good Security at Six per Cent. per Annum, special Regard to be had in letting the same to such Persons thro' the Province, as may be in Danger of Oppression by the Extortion of excessive Usury or otherwise; from such, who may delight in the Pleasure which their Brethren the great Fish of the Sea, take in devouring the less. And due Care being also taken to call in the Silver so let, before the Year 1760, by which Means the Sum in the Treasury may be very considerably increased.</P>
<P N="7">VII. 'Tis propos'd, That in the Year 1760, the said Sum of 450000 Ounces of Silver, and what may be added thereto by letting any Part thereof upon Interest, be divided to and amongst the several Towns in the Province, each Town to re∣ceive thereof in Proportion to the Tax laid upon it. And whereas 'tis to be supposed, that after all the Treasurer's Care, there will be some Bonds not discharg'd by Persons who may have taken some Part of the Sum upon Interest, 'tis propos'd That said Bonds (if any there be) come into the Division, each Town taking the Bonds of their own Inhabitants as a Part of their Proportion of the Dividend.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. 'Tis propos'd, That each Town distribute the Silver and Gold by them receiv'd, to and among their Inhabitants, each one to receive thereof in Proportion to his Rate in the Province Tax. And as to their Bonds (if any there be) call them in at Discretion, in the mean Time appropriating the Interest to such Purposes as may lighten the Town Charges.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That from and after the Year 1760, the publick Taxes be laid for Silver at 6 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Oz. or Gold <HI>pro rato,</HI> pro∣viding nevertheless that Bills of Credit be accepted instead there∣of: And as a Reward for their good Service, and to hasten their coming in, let <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in said Bills be receiv'd as equal in Value to twenty one Penny Weight, or <HI>Seven Shil∣lings</HI> in Silver. And that all private Debts after said Year
<PB N="9" REF="004585_0008_100D6A9D6CBB0108"/>contracted, be payable in Silver at 6 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Ounce, or in Province Bills three for one. And that one Ounce of Silver or 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in Bills, discharge 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> of all Debts contracted before or in that Year.</P>
<P N="10">X. 'Tis propos'd, That 3000 Ounces, Part of the 90000 due from the Company, as it comes in, be given to <HI>Harvard College</HI> so far to make good the Loss their Stock has sustain'd by the Fall of the Credit of our Province Bills, whereby the Design of their generous and pious Benefactors has in consi∣derable Measure been frustrated. And, that all other Stocks of Money, founded for the Encouragement of inferiour Schools of Learning, or any pious or charitable Uses, and that have sustained the like Loss, do receive of said Silver, a Sum that bears the same Proportion to the respective Stocks as 3000 Oz. doth to the Stock of <HI>Harvard College.</HI></P>
<P>And that the Remainder of the said Sum of 90000 Oz. be left as an additional Fund for the more speedy and effectual drawing in and sinking the Bills outstanding. 'Tis supposed that the Province Charge will be included, with the 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly to be drawn in and sunk in the same Tax Bill. And as Bills will pay said Tax with 1 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Pound Advance above Sil∣ver, 'tis suppos'd the Inhabitants will of Choice pay their Rates in Bills. And 'tis propos'd that all the Bills so paid in, be sunk, and that in Case the Sum paid in Bills, exceed 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> the Excess of that Sum, be paid out in Silver from said additional Fund: By which Means perhaps the Bills may all be gathered in and sunk, in six or seven, instead of ten Years.</P>
<P>If the abovesaid Scheme be proceeded to, and bro't to Effect, 'tis obvious to the discerning Reader,</P>
<P N="1">1. That all Temptation to hoarding up the Bills, and so de∣feating the Design of their Emission, which is, to serve as a Medium of Trade, is obviated: The Importance of which may be seen, in which Experience teaches, with Respect to the ensnaring Scheme upon which the Merchants Notes were emitted.</P>
<P N="2">2. That which is here propos'd, strongly tends to defeat the unrighteous Hopes, and discourage the oppressive Practices of avaritious Men: For as there will be a Medium of Trade provided, so there will be a growing Sum in the Treasury to be let upon good Security at lawful Interest, by which Means Persons will not lie at the Mercy of their Oppressors, but may be supply'd where they will be treated with Justice. And if finally they become Debtors to their own Towns, 'tis to be expected they will be treated by their Neighbours agreable to the Laws of Kindness.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="004585_0009_100D6A9F429BD4D8"/>
3. That we shall be furnished with a Medium of Trade, which for the present Time, will be as good to all Intents and Purposes within ourselves, as Silver and Gold; and such a one as will hold its Value: For these Bills being receiv'd by the Province Treasurer, and by the Company, according to the Tenor thereof, it will not be in the Power of others to depre∣ciate them. If others should advance upon their Commodities, the Effect would be, that the Company (acting with Justice and Honour) would draw all the Trade of the Province. And unless others can make such Advance, there is no Danger of their bidding upon Silver and Gold, and consequently no Dan∣ger of the Bills being depreciated, especially when 'tis further consider'd, that in a few Years they will convert into Silver and Gold.</P>
<P N="4">4. That at the Period propos'd, the Province will be fur∣nish'd with a Medium for Trade in Silver and Gold, of more Value than 600000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of the present Currency; and every in∣dividual Person have his Proportion of it in his Pocket or at Interest.</P>
<P>The great Enquiry is, <HI>Whether what has been propos'd is prac∣ticable?</HI> And in order to the forming a proper Judgment upon this Head, these three Things are carefully to be consi∣der'd, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Part propos'd to be undertaken by the</HI> SUBSCRIBERS.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Part assign'd to the</HI> PROVINCE.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What Influence this</HI> SCHEME, <HI>should it take Effect, would have upon our</HI> British <HI>Plantations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Part propos'd to be undertaken by the Subscribers. And this, besides the Obligation they lay themselves under, ex∣press'd in the Face of the Bills, is only to pay in 10 per Cent. annually, of the respective Sums they receive, 'till the whole be paid. And surely, with but ordinary Success in their Trade, they will be able to do this, and find their Account in undertaking it.</P>
<P>I say 'tis only this, besides the Obligation he brings himself under to receive 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in these Bills, as equal in Value to one Ounce of Silver in all Payments; which Obligation why should any Merchant decline bringing himself under? Were the Me∣dium with which they carry on their Trade, wholly Silver and Gold, and so such as with little or no Variation would hold its Value, would he not then, generally speaking, set the same Advance upon his Goods from Year to Year, and yet have sufficient Encouragement to proceed in his Business? And why is there not then as great Encouragement to proceed in
<PB N="11" REF="004585_0010_100D6AA19692ABD8"/>it, upon Supposition, the proper Medium is preserv'd in its full Value, and he goes on to set his Advance accordingly? But here 'twill be said, That though in the suppos'd Case he might have the same Encouragement, yet that in our present Cir∣cumstances, he is so straitned and press'd for Returns, and Sil∣ver being so scarce, which is the best Commodity to make Returns in, those that have it being fully knowing to all this, will not part with their Silver for these Bills, without Advance; and therefore if he obtain them, he must comply to give it.</P>
<P>To this I reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. That allowing the Truth of what is here suggested, and that the Merchant for these Reasons should give some Advance in Bills for Silver to make Returns, doth it thence follow that he must needs raise in Proportion upon all his Commodities? Is there any Reason in it, that because Silver is scarce and in Demand, he gives some Advance in Bills for it, that therefore he must make the same Advance upon all other Commodities, tho' they be not scarce nor in so great Demand? It would be no Detriment to the Credit of the Bills, if such an Advance was given in Exchange for Silver, as might be sufficient to in∣duce Persons to make the Exchange, if at the same Time the Bills were allowed to have their just Value (i. e. the Value set on them by the Legislature) in the purchasing all other Com∣modities. Nor in this Case would there be any Danger of their fluctuating, but their Value would be nevertheless invariable.</P>
<P>But</P>
<P N="2">2. What imaginable Reason is there, or what Advantage can it be under the Circumstances pleaded, for the Merchant to go on from Year to Year to bid higher and higher for Silver? An Ounce of Silver now it costs 29 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in Province Bills, is no better at <HI>London</HI> than it was when it cost but <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in the same Bills: And 20 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> then as effectually and readily pre∣cured it, as 29 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> doth now. In brief, as Silver, let the Price of it here be what it will, is not thereby alter'd in its Value at Home; so it was as readily sold, by those that had it, when it was but 9 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> per Oz. as it is now 'tis 29 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> And however the Merchant is press'd for Returns, and Silver be the best Commo∣dity to answer that End, yet he can have no more Silver than there is; and a smaller Advance, as Experience has shown, has been as effectual to draw into his Hands the whole of that, as a greater. And were this Practice of giving higher and higher for Silver, laid aside, every Person that wants would have as good a Prospect of being supply'd, as in this Way. For if none gave such Advance, the Seller would not expect it, but he that first spake, would have the Refusal; and when those that want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, look out with greater Care and Diligence, they may ex∣pect
<PB N="12" REF="004585_0011_100D6AA4CD8B5C88"/>Success, and their Practice is more rational and far less exceptional, than in striving to answer their End by bidding a greater Advance than others are willing to give.</P>
<P N="3">3. I reply, That whatever Straits the Merchant may be in for Returns, and however great his Temptations may be under all Circumstances, to raise the Price he gives for Silver, yet these will not justify him in the Practice, if the Practice it self be such as involves Injustice or Dishonesty in it. Which that it doth I think I have already said enough to evince. To which I shall only desire the Reader to add, the Consideration of the Way which this Practice opens to designing Men, to deal un∣justly to the last Degree.</P>
<P>And I think he can't but discern, so much of this, as to shew him, upon how precarious Foundations Justice &amp; Righteous∣ness stand, in the present State of our Affairs, and of how great Importance it is, that proper Care should be taken in the Mat∣ter. And that therefore the Obligation proposed (and under our Consideration) is both reasonable and important, and what no wise and just Man should decline, in the most explicit Man∣ner to bring himself under.</P>
<P>But I now pass,</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the Part in this Scheme assigned to the Pro∣vince, and this is to pay in annually a Tax of <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 200000. That is so much besides the current Charges of each Year, which this Scheme doth not meddle with.</P>
<P>And I should think this no insupportable Burden: 'Tis true the Inhabitants of the Province complain of the Weight of the Taxes at present laid upon them; but 'tis to be consider'd, that the present Taxes are heavier, and will continue so to be till 1743, than what is here proposed. And besides, the Ground of the present Complaint is really not so much because of the Greatness of the Tax, as the Scarcity of Money. And since in this Scheme there is Provision made for a competent Supply, it can't be thought, but that they will bear easily the Tax proposed, and that with the greater Chearfulness, seeing they will not only be, perhaps more than rewarded by the Be∣nefit they will receive from the Use of so good a Medium of Exchange, but after a few Years, will have their Bills return'd into their own Hands in good Silver and Gold, with Interest.</P>
<P N="3">III. What Influence this Scheme, should it take Effect, will have upon our British Trade.</P>
<P>I mention this, because, that however we might argue, that by our Charter the General Assembly of the Province, are vest∣ed with full Power to transact such an Affair in and by them∣selves, yet since the principal Advantage <HI>Great Britain</HI> reaps from the Plantations, arises from the supplying them with their
<PB N="13" REF="004585_0012_100D6AA6C0B86ED8"/>Manufacturies, and receiving in Returns such Commodities as the Plantations have or can get in their Power: If such a Scheme as this should be thought to clog that Trade, and so be detrimental to his Majesty's good Subjects there, 'tis but just to expect that Obstructions will be thrown in the Way, to prevent its taking Effect.</P>
<P>And I think, as the Matter has been managed amongst us, 'tis no wonder that it has reached his Majesty's Ear, and that he has so far interposed in the Affair of our emitting Bills of Credit, as to give Instructions to his Governour of this Pro∣vince relating thereto. For beyond doubt, the Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> who have supplied us with their valuable Commodities, have not only, been sometimes long kept out of their Money, but when it has come to Hand, it has fallen short of what it ought to have been, as much as our Paper-Currency has sunk in its Credit, which however it may not have been the Effect of Design and Pre-meditation in our Merchants, yet it has really been an Injustice, and so far as this has been the Case, his Majesty's endeavouring to redress it, by giving such Instruc∣tions to his Governour, as he thought proper for that End, ought to be deem'd, but the Fruit of his paternal Care for the good of his Subjects.</P>
<P>But now if what is here proposed, will be found upon Ex∣amination, sufficient to fix the Value of our Bills, the Grie∣vance will be removed, and upon a proper Representation the Instructions will undoubtedly be recall'd, especially if it be further found that this Scheme, tends greatly to the flourish∣ing of our British Trade, and so to the mutual Advantage of his Majesty's good Subjects there and in this Province, which that it doth might easily be demonstrated, but I forbear; and shall now close by observing,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in the foregoing Scheme I have the rather set the Va∣lue, at the Rate I have, that so they might the better correspond with those Bills of Credit of this Province, already passing a∣mongst us. For whilst the Law sets those of the new Tenor (as we distinguish them) at 6 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> the Ounce, and at the same Time requires three for one, if paid in Bills of the old Tenor, it doth in Effect set the old Tenor Bills at the Rate of 20 <ABBR><HI>ss.</HI></ABBR> the Ounce. And however by an ill Management, nei∣ther of those Sorts of Bills, at present carry in them that Value, especially as received by the Merchant, yet they ought to car∣ry it, and I think their sinking Credit ought so far to be reco∣vered, as to bring them to that, as being (all Things consi∣der'd) the most proper Standard. And as the Government are obliged to receive them at that Rate, so it may be of good Ef∣fect for the abovesaid Company to take them in all Payments
<PB N="14" REF="004585_0013_100D6AA8B4DD95A8"/>at the same Rate too; and as it will be needful that a proper Instrument be drawn for them to subscribe, it seems very ad∣viseable, there should be an Article therein obliging them so to do.</P>
<P>This being undertaken and comply'd with, will certainly fix an equal Value upon the Bills projected in the foregoing Scheme, and those already extant, nor can there I think be a∣ny Danger but that both will hold their Value, for what ima∣ginable Reason can there be, for any to set a less Value upon <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in these Bills than upon an Ounce of Silver? if at present it will purchase the same Quantity of such Goods as he wants, that an Ounce of Silver would, and which had he the Silver, he would part with it for? The Truth is, what∣ever I have to part with, that will as well procure what I at present want, as Silver and Gold would, is at present as good to me, as Silver and Gold themselves. For which Reason, he that can think abstractly, must, I think, be able to see, that a Medium of Trade, considered meerly as such, is no whit the better or worse, on Account of what we call intrinsick Value, be the same greater or less. But its true Value as a Medium of Trade is to be estimated, by the Credit it obtains, and the Demand it is in. And since Silver and Gold were never in greater Demand in any Common-Wealth, than our Paper-Medium is, and is like to continue to be in this Province, there appears nothing wanting in the Nature of Things to sup∣port its Value, so long as we have Silver and Gold, Fish, Lum∣ber, and all Necessaries of Life to buy, so long as we have Ships and Houses to build, Farms to purchase and subdue, and <HI>Debts to pay;</HI> and so long as with our Paper-Medium all these Things may be accomplished, there is no Hazard of its not being in Demand.</P>
<P>The only Thing needful then to keep up its Value, is the making a proper and resolute Stand against that inconfiderate Folly (to put the most charitable Construction upon it) which it was the main Design of the Pages preceeding the foregoing Scheme to detect. Which Folly might and ought in Justice, I think, to have been corrected long ago (and especially by the Merchants at that Juncture when they emitted their Notes) and which it will be in the Power of the Company should this Scheme take Effect, by a wise and just Management easily to over-rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although I have set to the foregoing Scheme (to the End it might be the more fully conceiv'd of) the Period of 1760, yet the Reader will observe that I have left the Matter of fixing the Period to the Discretion of the General Court. And although that should be the Period fix'd by them, and
<PB N="15" REF="004585_0014_100D6AACD0699D48"/>agreable to what has been projected, the Province should then be furnished with so large and valuable a Medium, and that so effectually scattered amongst the Inhabitants, yet it is very uncer∣tain whether the State of the Trade of the Province will not then be such, as that in a few Years, it will grow too scant to serve the End, thro' the Demand Silver and Gold will still be in for Ex∣portation. And whether it will not be found that a Paper-Medium, is better adapted to promote the Trade and Prosperi∣ty of the Province, than one that consists of Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>It has been generally complain'd of, as a Failure in our Trade, That our Importation exceeds our Exportation, and this has been assign'd by many as the Reason why Silver and Gold don't center with us. But if those that advance this, would be understood to intend, That our Exportation falls short of being sufficient to pay for what is imported to us, I think it can't in Reason be true; for were this the Case, we should long ere now been Bankrupt. And if they intend that the Value of what we im∣port as Returns, exceeds the Value of our Exportation, and this be true, 'tis by no Means to be complain'd of as a Failure in our Trade. Yet, suppose the Balance of these were a <HI>Million</HI> a Year in our Favour, it would not thence <HI>necessarily</HI> follow, that any of that Balance would rest with us in Silver and Gold. (tis true, if our Exportation should be sufficient to procure a greater Quantity of foreign Commodities, and Silver and Gold too (which 'tis to be remembred, is not our own Production) than we could ourselves consume or apply to the carrying on and increasing the several Branches of our Trade, the Balance in this Case, would remain with us in Silver and Gold, as being of all our Effects the most convenient to lay by. But when or whe∣ther ever this will be the Case is uncertain, nor need we concern ourselves much about it: For, 'till it is the Case, tho' Silver and Gold will not abide with us, it will be our Advantage to send it off; and the Balance of our Trade, if it be in our Fa∣vour, will remain with us, and naturally center in the Cultiva∣tion and beautifying this extensive Land, the Accomplishment whereof will take an almost immense Sum, it being as yet (com∣paratively speaking) but a rough and unpolish'd Wilderness.</P>
<P>And 'till this be in some good Measure accomplish'd, 'tis not in Reason to be expected, that Manufacturies will be carry'd on with any great Degree of Strength and Advantage amongst us; And consequently 'tis to be expected that foreign Manufacturies, specially those <HI>Great Britain</HI> abounds with, will be in great De∣mand with us. Nor can the Silver and Gold we may receive from <HI>Spain, Portugal</HI> and the <HI>West-India Islands,</HI> be better im∣prov'd, than by sending it to <HI>Great Britain</HI> to procure them for our Use.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004585_0015_100D6AAE749136E0"/>
And lest any should think that the SCHEME I have above pro∣posed, militates with what I now advance, I would observe, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ever by said SCHEME 'tis propos'd that 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of Sil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e annually stop'd in its Circulation, in the Way of the <HI>British</HI> Trade for a Number of Years, yet the Design hereof is, to give Life and Value to the PAPER MEDIUM projected, by the Help of which we shall undoubtedly be able to import more than double that Sum, beyond what we possibly could, upon Supposition of our being destitute of such a Medium.</P>
