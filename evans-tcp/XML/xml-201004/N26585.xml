<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO great a prevalence has custom, that to see an English book without a Preface, is as strange a sight as a bull without horns, the wea∣pons of his defence. If this little History of the Irish Robbers has any occasion of a Preface, it can only be to obviate one objection that may be made by cavillers against it, viz. <Q>Rogues merit no commendation; and therefore men ought to be cautious of introducing their actions in His∣tory, lest it should be an encouragement to others to follow their example:</Q> But I can assure the Reader, that my intention is quite different: I have wrote with no other design than to discourage young men from falling into such company as may lead them into a shameful way of living, which often brings them to an ill end, and leaves a reproach upon their family, who may be inno∣cent. We may observe the great Redmond O'Hanlon, though he lived a merry life, yet it was but short, and attended with such dangers and fear, that he could have but little satisfaction, and at length he became such an odium, that one of his own relations, for the lucre of a reward, dis∣patched him out of the world as he lay asleep. How safely, then can an outlawed rogue leave
<PB N="iv" REF="035355_0003_10049CABAEE2F1E8"/>his life in the power of another, when induced not only by the promise of a reward, but for the sake of pardon to give information? And if a man has occasion to distrust his own comrades, with how much dissatisfaction must he live? It is true, he may riot for a while, but let him take care, <Q>lest (according to the Psalmist) he be cut off in his wickedness, and die in his sins.</Q></P>
<P>I hope the following History may also be of service to honest men of all professions, who may happen to have dealings, though at unawares, with such kind of cattle as are here treated of.— By making ourselves acquainted with their arti∣fices and ways of management, we may be bet∣ter able to know how to discover their wiles, and break their measures. When a man is forewarn¦ed, if he does not sore-arm himself, I believe all men will think him blame-worthy. I am sure this is my opinion, who am a well wisher to all men.</P>

<HEAD>A GENUINE HISTORY OF THE LIVES AND ACTIONS of the most notorious Irish ROGUES and RAPPAREES.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH it is very probable that Ireland has produced a great many barbarians and murderers from the beginning, yet as the ancient histories of that nation are so very fabulous, that little or no credit can be given to them, we shall begin with the lives of such, the veracity where∣of cannot be called in question; and, as among the Irish robbers of modern date none appears to be more remarkable and notorious than Redmond O'Hanlon, the reader is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sired to let him lead the van.</P>

<HEAD>The surprizing History of Redmond O'Hanlon, protector of the rights and properties of the benefactors, and captain general of the Irish robbers; almost notorious, though a gentleman∣like robber.</HEAD>
<P>REDMOND O'H—N was the son of a re∣putable Irish gentleman, who had a consi∣derable estate, and lived at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Sleygunnin mountains, in the county of Armagh, among a vast number of relations, several where∣of were of the same name. After his parents had given him the best education the time and place afforded, they obtained for him a small post in the army, where he served a few years with pretty good credit, though very young, 'till the reduction of the Irish forces in this kingdom, a∣mong which our Redmond was one.</P>
<P>The nation being reduced by the English fore¦ces, several Irish families, who had a hand in the wars of Ireland were dispossessed, and their lands forfeited; by which means a very great alterae¦tion was made in this family, and several of thn O'H—ns were obliged to travel, in hopes of retrieving their fortunes. But poor Redmond, in this unhappy condition, once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and fly∣ing for safety, staid abroad for a long time, still refusing to come to trial 'till he was outlawed, which put him to his shifts. But our hero ha∣ving received some instructions in the art of war, and being naturally of an undaunted courage,
<PB N="7" REF="035355_0006_10049CB6D3C6B6B0"/>was easily led into the secret of invading other men's properties, both on the highway, and by breaking open of houses, till he had acquired as much money as might have put him in a way to live above the frowns of fortune, with good ma∣nagement, all his life.</P>
<P>But seeming to relish this new course of life more than the former, he proceeded in his rob∣beries, 'till from an infancy in the art, he be∣came one of the most notorious and expert of that profession that had ever been bred in the kingdom of Ireland. He had made himself ac∣quainted with all the bye passages in the coun∣try, and he knew all the lurking places on the mountains of Newry and Sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gun in, so that whoever pretended to pursue him, made but fruitless attempts, and commonly returned with loss and shame, like dogs that lost their ears, both before and after the rewards were offered by the government for apprehending him.</P>
<P>He was strong and active, and as occasion re∣quired, could perform his feats either on foot or on horseback: but though he was so notorious a plunderer, he was naturally of a very generous disposition, frequently giving share of what he got from the rich to relieve the poor in their ne∣cessities. His remarkable actions and surprising attempts, spread his character through all the country; and being joined by a great number of his former acquaintance (adventerous lads who became his associates spontaneously) 'till his company was augmented to fifty effective men, mostly his own relations, he then began to take upon a captain's command, and appointed a bri∣gade
<PB N="8" REF="035355_0007_10049CB8949666A8"/>to act in every province, who were always to return (barring accidents) four times a year to their general place of rendezvous and give an account of their success, and as soon as the booty was regularly divided, each brigade was ordered to exchange posts, and to march out on duty again. This was their constant practice for some years, by which policy they kept themselves concealed much longer than they otherwise could have done. However, there was no robbery committed any where at all in the kingdom but was attributed to Captain O'H—n, though it is probable he might be an hundred miles distant at the same time: nay, so well was his character established, and so notorious his actions, that it became a common proverb, when any man had a mind to brand another with infamy and scandal, for him to say, "You are as great a rogue as Redmond O'H—n."</P>
<P>As Redmond was once travelling along the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad between Newry and Armagh, like a kite in the air in quest of prey, with only two or three attendants, who were at some distance behind him, he overtook a pedlar, crying out and be∣moaning his misfortune, in a very moving and hi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous manner. Redmond taking compassion of the pedlar, came up and asked what had befallen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im? To whom the pedlar replied, "Teat damn'd rogue of a Redmond O'H—n has robbed me of above five pounds in money, which was all I had; and that would not satisfy him either, but he has taken my box away too; and because I strove to hold it, he knocked me down, and abus∣ed me like a dog." Redmond incensed at such
<PB N="9" REF="035355_0008_1004997BB83A2A40"/>language, had hardly patience to hear him tell out his story before he interrupted him, and call∣ed him a rascal and a lying son of a whore.— 'How could I rob you you, (said he) that never saw you before? You dog, shew me which way he went, and I'll convince you that it was none of Redmond O'H—n that robbed you. By the time the fellow had described the robber, and shewed the road he took, Redmond's compa∣ny came up, and they all went in pursuit of the new rogue, whom they overtook, with the ped∣lar's box under his arm, and brought him back to the place where he committed the robbery. He knew himself guilty of the fact, and returned the pedlar both his money and box, without waiting to be examined, being no way acquainted with Redmond or any of his party. Upon this Cap∣tain O'H—n said, he would teach him to rob in his name, and without his licence or permis∣sion, and bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he pedlar under an obligation to prosecute the fellow at the ensuing assizes, and then wrote a mittimus, and sent the criminal un∣der a proper guard to the jail of Armagh. The pedlar was as good as his word, prosecuted him to the very utmost, upon which the fellow being found guilty, was accordingly executed. He was not altogether so destitute of friends but that he had council to plead for him, who insisted very much upon the error in commitment, and
<PB N="10" REF="035355_0009_10049CBF3A874AA8"/>prevailed so far as to have the mittimus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The mitimus, we are informed, ran thus:</P>

<P>Redmond had a much greater antipathy to the English than to the Scotch or Irish; for he was always kind to his country men, and made a bargain both with them and the North country pedlars, and all such as acknowledged his juris∣diction all over the kingdom; alledging for ex∣cess, that as he was a reduced gentleman, he hoped his country men would not refuse to pay him tribute towards his maintenance, upon his de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing to plunder. Upon this he made propo∣sals, that whosoever paid him half a crown per annum, he would indem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ify them from robbers of all kinds: but if at any time they neglected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t him his salary, and run in arrears, they
<PB N="11" REF="035355_0010_10049CC24F3DFA40"/>were sure to pay for it. Such as made this bar∣gain with him, had their names registered in his pocket-book, and were so little afraid of losing any of their goods by robbers, that they thought their effects as safe in the field as in the house; for if at any time they happened to have any thing stolen, upon application to Redmond, he would make the most diligent search that could possibly be made through all parts of the king∣dom, till he found it and restored it to the own∣er; and if he falled to find it, always allowed his benefactor two years salary to compensate the loss. But he had so many emisaries, and such good intelligence, and all other petty rogues were so much afraid of him and his party, that none of them dared disoblige him; and besides, every robber was served with a copy of the re∣gistered names, and had strict orders not to med∣dle with any thing that belonged to such, but to assist the loser in searching for their goods: so that his friends seldom suffered under his protec∣tion.</P>
<P>Having once got cold, upon some desperate occasion, it threw him into a dangerous fever, of which he recovered; yet the place being damp where he lay, he lost the use of his limbs, and
<PB N="12" REF="035355_0011_10049CC406C9E270"/>continued a cripple or lame for some years: yet during this time he was preserved among his friends, who had a great esteem for him, and escaped from being taken, though he was pro∣claimed a tory and a robber, and a reward of fifty pound was offered for taking of him, which occa∣sioned frequent searches after him. He likewise was punctually paid his salary or tribute by his benefactors or allies (except a few who broke the truce, but dearly paid for it after) though robberies were not so frequent during his illuess as before, so that he was under a necessity of making his pay maintain him 'till he was able to go about again.</P>
<P>As soon as he had recovered the use of his limbs, he took the field again, and scoured all the roads roads in the country, sometimes alone, and sometimes with company, and took special care to revenge himself on all those who had neglected to send him his yearly pension while he was out of order; but found himself so closely hunted, that he fixed his head quarters at or about the bog of Allen for a considerable time, where he committed such a number of notorious robberies, that the country was obliged to keep under arms to guard their effects. The govern∣ment taking this into consideration, a fresh pro∣clamation was issued out, offering a reward of two hundred and fifty pound for the taking of him; upon which several attempts were made to secure him, but to no effect: though he was once taken in bed near Clonbullock; but had the good fortune to be rescued by his comrades, as his captors were leading him to Naas goal.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035355_0012_10049CC917B828A8"/>
Though he was very well acquainted all over the kingdom, yet he was loath to venture him∣self any longer in this place, and among strangers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tear of a second dissaster: so be took an op∣portonity of conveying himself private to his old quarters on Slevgunnin, where he remained some time, and carried on his game with great success, before his enemies had notice where to seek him.</P>
<P>Soon after his return, he was in company with some of his associates beyond Armagh, where they met with cornet Montgomery's steward, who having received about 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> from his master's tenants on an estats he had in that country, was carrying it home to his own house near Killevan, in the country of Monaghan, where he dwelt. Redmond stood at a little distance all the time of the action, and observed the dispute on both sides, and the defence made by the steward, which tho' he maintained it with bravery for some time, yet he was overpowered by numbers, and obli∣ged to deliver his purse to save his life. When the boots was divided, captain O'H—n made a present of his part to the cornet's young son, who was at nurse in the same place, which he sent by the steward, with strict order to deliver it, and took his acknowledgment for the same payable on demand. This he did out of a pure regard that he had for the cornet, on account of some favour that he had done him formerly: and the cornet to make him a requital for so generous an action, made a promise that he would use his best en∣deavours to obtain the king's pardon for him, in hopes of his forsaking his new trade; and was as good as his word, as by the sequel will appear.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035355_0013_10049CCAAE8CEA78"/>
A little after this action, a merchant in Dun∣dalk had a draught on a merchant in Newry for a large sum, but was so much in dread of Redmond OH—n, that he was afraid either to send for the money, or to go for it himself: while he was thus consulting with his wife how to get the money safely home, his apprentice, a lad about sixteen years of age, overheard their discourse, and as soon as he got an opportunity, desired his master to tell him why he was so much afraid of sending to Newry? The master having answered his request, the boy asked him whether he would venture to trust him with so much mo∣ney? The master said he did not doubt his ho∣nesty, but on that occasion he could not tell what to think of the matter: However, by many en∣treaties, the boy prevailed on the master to let him go for the money, promising to forfeit his ears if he lost one halspenny of it. The boy ha∣ving obtained privilege to go for the money, im∣mediately set about prepating himself for the journey; and by his n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>'s assitance, being provided with about forty shilling in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alf pence, he divided them into two parcels, and tied them up close in a little wallet, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ch end, and then went to the field and brought home an old vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ous stone horse, (much of the same humour with Sir Teague O'Reagan's war horse, on which he rode out to meet duke S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bomberg after the sur∣render of Charlemount) that when any other came up to meet him on the road, be always strove to bite or kick him, by which means he commonly kept the road to himself. With pro∣per accoutrements the boy mounted, and had the
<PB N="15" REF="035355_0014_10049CCDA6E69670"/>fortune to meet Redmond on the road as he was going, who, as it was usual with him, demanded where he was going? They boy told him to Newry, 'Pray what business have you there? says Redmond. Why, says the boy, to receive about 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for my master. And when do you think you'll be back? says Redmond. Why, says the boy, I believe about this time to-morrow. Well, my good boy, says Redmond, you had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter take care not to tell every body what year business is, for fear you should be robbed. Oh, says the boy, I am sure such a gentleman as you would not too me; I don't intend to tell any bo∣dy else.' Upon this Redmond made him a pre∣sent of a ducat to drink his health or to hite another horse, if the one he had under him s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld tire; and so they parted good friends for that time.</P>
<P>Redmond was then under some necesities for a little money; and as none of his companions were present at the dialogue, he was resolved not to let them know any thing of the matter, that he might have all the booty to himself: And to make himself the more sure of the prey, he or∣dered his comrades to a different post the next morning, and waited himself alone on the road leading from Newry, 'till the boy returned.</P>
<P>When they boy came in sight Redmond rode up and saluted him, and, after some discourse, be∣gan to ask him the necessary question about the money. The boy seeming to have no mistrust of his design confessed that he had received it, upon which the other di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>red him to let him see it. The boy seemingly under a su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prize, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>e several excuses, but they all availed him nothing for,
<PB N="16" REF="035355_0015_10049CCFA336E868"/>after a short parley, the other began to demand with some authority, and would have taken hold of him had he not been something afraid of recei∣ving a kick from the mad horse. Among other excuses, the boy alledged that his master would think that he had made away with the money himself and deem him a rogue, for which reason he could not part with it; but at length, Red∣mond threatning to shoot him if he refused any longer, the boy took his wallet, and cast it over a slough by the road side, and told Redmond that if he must have it, he should follow it. Upon this Redmond alighted from his horse, and ha∣ving tied him to a tree, with some difficulty he got over the slough and thro' the hedge, to the place where the wallet lay. While he was upon this expedition the boy exchanged horses much for the better, and rode home with speed, having the money he had received at Newry safely quilted up in his waistcoat and tho' Redmond cal∣led after him to stay, with all the cagerness in the world, yet he took no further notice of him, but left him to make the best hand he could of an old garren and a bag of halfpence.</P>
<P>Shortly after this Redmond was presented with the king's protection for three year, on trial of his good behaviour, by cornet Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gomery, who had taken some pains to obtain it, and remained for the space of above two years inossensive in the country, and kept company with some of the best gentlemen in the kingdom, who not only took pleasure in hearing him relate his exploits, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t caressed and made much of him; However, tho' he knew very well, if he had continued his
<PB N="17" REF="035355_0016_10049CD14810DD78"/>good behaviour for the term granted aforesaid, he might have obtained a general pardon, yet this honest way of living did not relish well with him; he had an itch to be at the old game, and accordingly began it before the admitted time was expired, growing ten times more wicked and no∣tortous than ever he had been before.</P>
<P>In imitation of Oliver Cromwell, lord protector of the common-wealth, he took upon him either the title of protector of the rights and properties of his benefactors contributors, chief ranger of the mountains, surveyor general of the highroads of Ireland, or lord-examiner of all passengers, committing such villainies, and barbarities on stur∣dy travellers, as he called them as, were never heard of before; often driving away whole herds of cattle from such in contempt of his protection and authority, had given offence by running in arrear; tho' he never used any ill that did not op∣pose him. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he seldom robbed a poor man, but on the contrary was always generous to men in necessity or distress—'Tis said that having once overtaken a poor man who had hardly any thing else lest but one cow, which he was driving to a fair to be sold, in order to raise the rent for his landlord, he asked him several questions, 'till he found certainly that he was in want, and then lent him five pounds, which he was to pay him at an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a few weeks after: The poor man prov∣ing perfectly honest, went with the money accor∣ding to compact; which pleased Redmond so well, that he bestowed it on him and five pounds more for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035355_0017_10049CD785AD9530"/>
He was likewise very generous to a soldier, if he met him alone, and understood the art of dis∣simulation, on disguising himself, as well as any man; sometimes appearing like an officer, some∣times like a country gentleman, and sometimes like a footman, and could after the tone of his voice at pleasure; so that the soldiers seldom knew him, tho' he often gave them money to drink, unless he discovered himself. The duke of Ormond, in his time, ordered out a small party of foot and horse, to pursue him, who being infor∣med where he was, but not mistrusting his dis∣guise, went after him immediately. Redmond perceiving how it was, dressed himself like an of∣ficer and went quietly along the high road, often looking cack wards, 'till he saw the red coats at a good distance behind him; then he hastened to a gentleman's house near the road, and told him he was an officer who was sent out with a party of men in pursuit of Redmond O'H—n, but being a little fatigued, made bold to call and red him∣self 'till his men came up; then desiring the peo∣ple of the house to call him as soon as they pas∣sed by, he stretehed himself down to rest. The soldiers had not gone above an hundred yards past the end of the avenue, before Redmond went out in pretence of meeting them at a sure by the road side a quarter of a mile off; but his intent was to make his escape another way, which he had for that time unperceived.</P>
<P>Not long after he appeared in Armagh in the habit of a country gentleman, and requested of the commanding officer there to let him have a few men to guard him about eight miles further,
<PB N="19" REF="035355_0018_10049CD91ACC0028"/>for fear of being met by any Redmond O'H—n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s party, because he had a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e of money about him. The request seemed very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easonable, and upon his rewarding t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e men before∣hand, the privilege was granted. He and the men passed on very jocosely for about seven miles, 'till, as it seems thinking himsel safe en∣nough, he told them he was out of danger, &amp; they might go back: upon this he gave every man a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iece of money, and desired them to make a discharge for joy of his safe passage, which they aid; then he desired th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to charge and do the like again: till at length they told him their ammunition was spent. This was what he expected, and giving a whistle, a parcel of his gang sprung up out of the thickets who stripped the soldiers of their arms, money, accoutrements and clothes, in which shameful condition they were obliged to go back to their quarters.</P>
<P>A relation of the surprisring escape be made at the four-mile house, between Dundalk and New∣ry, may claim the reader's attention as much as any of these. Being there overtaken by an of∣ficer and twelve men, he was made prisoner; but seeming to have a great respect for the soldiers, and they for him, there was no dispute made; he submitted to every thing they demanded, and seemed ready and willing to go where they plea∣sed.

<P>The government being just by incensed at the manner of his proceeding and behaviour, soon af∣ter issued out a new proclamation, offering a fresh reward for his head dead or alive.</P>
<P>There was a barrack also erected at a Carade∣velin, where two troops of horse and two companies of foot were ordered for the security of the country; which tho' several of Redu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond's comrades were dispersed, put him under no terror, for he robbed as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quently as ever; but kept in the night at very private plates.</P>
<P>A captain of foot being informed of one of his haunts, chose out twenty of the most active men in the barrack, who stripped themselves to their waistcoats, and marched out in pursuit of him be∣fore break of day in the morning, with nothing but their muskets and bayonets, and a little pre∣vision in their pockets. In about two hours they invested his ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tie of defence, where he lay alone that night, but, in the midst of their search, had the mort ficati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to hear him call out to them from an adjacent hill, bidding denance; for it seems, he had warning of their approach, tho' it was so short that he ran out half drossed. Upon this the militury men hold a consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation of war, wherein it was resolved to divide themselves into three par∣ties, and pursue him without delay. The captain and ten men were to follow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chace in the cen∣ter,
<PB N="21" REF="035355_0020_10049CDDCDD8E430"/>and five men on each wing, who were always to keep within a quarter of a mile of the main body. In this manner they followed him 'till noon, without giving him time to rest, but at length, several of them begining to lag, the chace was only maintained by four, who kept so nigh him as to have him in view now and then the greatest part of the day, notwithstanding the dif∣ficulties they had to surmount in ascending the hills. In the evening he hid himself in a knot of furze, about half a mile from a small village, where several of his friends lived, intending to convey himself thither in the night expecting that the soldiers would have gone on, and have search∣ed the village before it grew quite dark: but here he was entirely mistaken, for his pursuers (tho' he had out ran them near half a mile) up∣on loosing sight of him, suspected that he had hid himself, and having fited a shot for a signal wai∣ted near they place where they had missed him 'till the whole company came up and then made a very diligent search, but to no purpose: upon this they held a fresh consultation, not many yards from they place where Redmond lay, and con∣cluded to sit down and make a repast of what provision they had and to lie under cover 'till morning. Redmond overhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd the discourse, and was resolved to steal away, if possible, but was pro∣vented by the brightness of the moon, and the men's walking to and fro to keep themselves warm, till a little before sun-rise, when observing a smoak at a distance, they drew near thinking to meet with some house, to refresh themselves; but in∣stead of finding one they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd a village, where
<PB N="22" REF="035355_0021_10049CE961AEDD20"/>being furnished with fresh provisions, tho' at a dear rate, as they were returning to renew the search, they observed a man at some distance, making to a cabbin on the side of a hill whom they pursued &amp; found that they were upon the scent. But Redmond looking behind him, tho' he was exceeding hungry, altered his course, &amp; the pur∣suit was renewed with great warmth, insomuch that Redmond had not time to refresh himself all day long and was obliged to hide himself next e∣vening in the top of a mountain, where he re∣mained 'till break of day, and then, being almost famished with hunger, went to one of his friend's houses to get something to eat.</P>
<P>At his coming up to the door, one of the dogs began to bark, which alarmed the pursuers in the center, who lay not far off; whereupon they all came up in a body and surrounded the house, just as Redmond fat down with a cake of bread, some butter, and a can of milk before him. It was now the third day since he had got a morsel, and being almost spent for want of food, was just going to put the first bit in his mouth, when the captain of the little army appeared at the door with a very kind salutation, which Redmond, tho' under the greatest surprize) returned with a gen∣tleman-like air, 'Mr. O'H—n, (said the officer) I am glad to have overtaken you; we have been in pursuit of you near three days with the king's warrant, and at last are come up with you; now, sir, you are the king's prisoner; get ready, for you must come along with us.' Redmond repli∣ed, sir, I acknowledge that I am your prisoner and shall comply with your orders immediately; but,
<PB N="23" REF="035355_0022_10049CECE70B5C80"/>gentlemen, you have been hunting me these two days past, as I never was hunted in my life. I have not had time to put one bit in my mouth 'till now. and I beg, sir, you'll give me leave to eat my last breakfast with my friends; as soon as I have done you shall carry me where you please, and it will be no small honour to have the credit of taking Redmond O'H—n only don't disturb me 'till I am ready. The privilege was readily granted him, resting on their arms, while the other twelve guarded the house on all sides without, 'till Redmond had done; then he started up, ta∣king his blunderbuss in his hand, and presenting it to the officer, said, 'Now you take me for your prisoner, and I don't deny it; but you must give me a little play, that the world should not have it it to say that I was taken so silly; you bear the title of captain, so do I; if you refuse to give me horse room and car-room, I'll discharge my piece at you this instant, and you shall die with me. I expect nothing but death gentlemen, but yet am resolved to have fair play, and die honourably: I have but one life to loose, you can take no more, and perhaps I may make three o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four of you bear me company; for to goal I never will go alive.' This language surprised the officer, who seemed to give way a little, as tho' he had a mind to consent; upon which Redmond forced out of the door, and ran for his life. The soldiers with∣out were so situated, that he had got above twen∣ty yards before the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could fire without any dan∣ger of hurting one another: so that, tho' every ry shot was discharged after him, he got clear off, with only some slight wounds, and made a com∣pleat
<PB N="24" REF="035355_0023_10049CBD9EDCD930"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ape for that time, taking great advan∣tage of the delay the made in loading their pieces again.</P>
<P>After this he had the mortification, with five of his gang, to be frightened after a queer manner. Some of the servants being abroad, happened to spy the people at their first coming, and suspecting the design, ran to the fields to catch a horse to alarm the country, the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le stud, affrighted at so sudden a disturbance, galloped up towards the house and made a very great noise, which the gang took for the country in arms at their heels, and ran away in confusion before they had time to get much plunder or enter the house.</P>
<P>It was about this time that P—, the greatest robber in Mun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, out of mere curiosity, took a journey to the country of Armagh, purely for the sake of seeing Redmond O'H—n, of whom he heard abundance of sine stories, but never had been in his company. When he came near the place of Redmond's abode, he put up at an inn, but for some private reasons made no enquiry that night; for observing a gentleman, as he thought, telling over a good some of money, he took care to be informed which road he interded to take, in the morning; upon which he pursued him and overtook him at the side of a little wood: At coming up be demanded the gentleman's money without more ado, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld him he saw him reckoning the night before: The other told him, he had money sure enough, but swore, that who∣soever took it should sight for it; upon which each of them discharged a pistol, but without any damage, and then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their swords, without
<PB N="25" REF="035355_0024_10049C86B2996268"/>which they fought some time on horseback, with out much harm or advantage on either side: a length, looking on one another, they forbore a while, and agreed to alight and decide the quar∣rel on foot; having alighted the victory was con∣tended for with equal bravery and loss of blood on both sides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'till they were able to sight no lon∣ger then sitting down to rest, 'Pray, says the Samp∣son of the North, who are you, or what is your name! Upon this the other confessed, he was the chief Pobber of Munster who hearing a great deal of Redmond O'H—n's same, came purposely have an opportunity of getting acquainted with him. Says Redmond, then you have satisfied your curiosity, for I am the man; and I must confess you are the heartiest lad that I ever met with, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever was so worsted before. So the bat∣tle erded; they kissed and became friends, and he made a league to tarry with Redmond a year and half in the north; but nor relishing so much bonnocks and oatmeal as they usually got in this place, he returned again to his own country, and surveyed only the Munster road; afterwards.</P>
<P>Before he departed they made a truce, and promised to give one another notice it at any time either of them was put in prison, or in distress, that the one at liberty might relieve or rescue the other if possible. And soon after this, the Mun∣ster tory was apprehended, and put into Clonmel goal, for robbing and murdering a traveller on Kilnagowna, near the place where Patrick Sars∣field afterwards had the fortune to blow up King William's artillery, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail down the cannon.
<PB N="26" REF="035355_0025_10049C8848418A68"/>According to their compact, he wrote a letter to Redm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he received at Armagh, and having comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cated the contents thereof to his trust, comrades, Patrick Mac-tigh, John Reilly, Shan Ber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag, Phil. Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, Pat. Meel, Arthur O'Ned, and the famous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian O'Kelly, they took the affair into consideration: but however the time being very short, Redmond posted away a∣lone and only reached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the evening be∣fore the Munster champion was led out to Kil∣magowna, in or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to be executed. Being in the habit of a gentleman be found means of commu∣nicating with P— and let him know that he intended to set the town on fire in several places that night that while the people were in confusi∣on he might have an opportunity of executing his design; but P—let him know the danger of such an attempt, while a strong guard of soldiers were kept in the town, and dissuaded him from it, by telling him of a much better opportunity that would offer on the road the next day, there being but a sile or two of foot soldiers with the sheriff, to guard him; and to put him in a way of forming a probable Stratagem for making a rescue. Next morning the guard set out with the prisoner, and having con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucted him about half way, they stopped a while at a public house on the road, to retresh themselves. The prisoner was left in a finall room at one end of the house, under the charge of four soldiers, while the sol∣diers sat in a large room at the other end, over a cup of liquor, not mistrusting any thing; tho' the landlord was made privy to the design, but ab∣folutoly refused to give any aid or assistance, un∣less
<PB N="27" REF="035355_0026_10049C89E45B24E8"/>Redmond would promise to give him some slight wourd, to save his credit. To make the story short, while they sat in this posture, Red∣mond appeared at the door in the furniture of a gentleman, and having in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ired the cause of the soldiers being there be desired to have the pri∣vilege of seeing the prisoner; which being readi∣ly granted to him be called for wine and other liquor in great plenty, to treat the men and paid the whole reckoning|with a great many sine com∣pliments. This being over, the officer to make a return of such gratitude, called for more wine to treat the gentleman, while the men were plied with liquor, by Redmond's private orders, to fa∣cilitate his design.</P>
<P>As soon as he thought convenient, he stepped out, on pretence of making water, and looking round about him, to see whether the coast was clear he observed eight men riding towards him, and waiting till they came up, sound they were som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his own comrades, to whom he had com∣municated the affair before he left the North who had followed him in order to assist him. To be sure the news was very agreeable, and his comrades could never meet him in a more wel come time; for that moment, seeing an opportu∣nity of rele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing his brother, they consulted the: manner of executing their design, and had the luck to rescue him in a very surprizing manner, as follows: one of the gang held the horses at the end of the house, while the rest followed Red∣mond into it who opening a door that was in the passage, to prevent any in the lower room from looking up into the other, stood there, and made
<PB N="28" REF="035355_0027_10049C8CA33EB480"/>some kind of a noise, not only to drown the voice of those with the prisoner during the scuffle, but to hinder the others from coming out to see what the matter was, if there arose any suspicion. In the mean while, seven of the North country robbers entered into the little room, and taking advantage of the small guard, while they were in liquor, dispatched and laid aside the four men so suddenly, that the had not time to cry out; and then having out they cords wherewith the prison∣er was bound, he followed them out, and moun∣ted one of the horses with very little noise, and so made his escape to the mountains along with his new company. Things were so situated, that Redmond himself was the first who gave no∣tice of the escape, and assisted the sheriff and the guard in pursu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the rescuers for several miles, 'till finding an opportunity in the evening, &amp; ob∣serving that several of the guards, being overcome with liquor, had lagged behind, he turned off short, giving them the slip on the mountains, and followed his comrades directly to Longford-pass, near the Bog of Allen, without stop or stay, where he had directed them to post away before him. Here they all met, acrording to agreement; but what became of P—after is uncertain, tho' partly related in the next.</P>
<P>Some time after this, when the soldiers in the barrack erected at Carradelvin Lad marched out of their quarters, and fresh ones had supplied their room Redmond having contrived the plot himself, took out with him eighteen men (among whom were the aforesaid Mac-tigh, Reilly, Bernagh, Galloge, Meel, O'Neal, Kelly, all a med) and

As soon as Captain O'H—n perceived the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, he marked out a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le, and gave orders to his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to draw the horses up into an half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon, and prepare for battle.

While Redmond resided near Allen, Kelly with two or three green-horn rapparees, beset a house in the country of Kildare, about ten o'clock at night, and having easily found means to convey themselves into a pig's stye at one end of the house, where there was a hole made in the wall, thro' which whey was usually conveyed into the swine-trough, the servant-maid, who was a brave s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urdy girl, had occasion to go into the dai∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with a candle, and observing that the hole was grown somewhat wider than before mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usted that all was not right. Upon this she took up a large cleaver, and putting out the candle, con∣veyed herself to the side of the hole to watch for a considerable time. When all was bushed, the hands fell to work again to pick out the stones of the wall, and made the hole wider, and presently came in a head and shoulders, which the girl per∣ceived by the light of the window, and making ready to give him a stroke, the fellow likewise discovered her, and called to his comrades to draw him back, because the hole was too narrow; but the girl had taken care to lighten the load, by cutting of the head, which terrified the rest with∣out so much, that they fled for the same, and no body came afterwards to challenge the dead, nei∣ther was it known who he was, 'till Kelly, the great m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>derer and robber, confessed it afterwards in his last speech at Armagh. However the girl was highly applauded. But now to return to Redmond, and finish his life;</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="035355_0032_10049C9F6D894D88"/>
The gallows destroyed many of his accompli∣ces, and the large rewards that were offered for taking himself, encouraged even private persons to endeavour to take him. And as the family of the Johnstons at the Fews are at present very serviceable to their country in apprehe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding tories and rapparees, so were they then; for the vigi∣lant Mr. Johnston seldom let him rest after his chief comr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des were cut off, but hunted him over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lls and daies; but more particularly once, ha∣ving notice that he was at Narrow-water, took some men and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es with him, and pursued him closely almost all the way to Carlingford where for fear that he should get and hide, and so convey himself away by sea in the night, his passages were all intercepted; which Redmond observing, he made up to an ale-house by the river-side, at which time it, happened there was no boat near hand, and no bridge within a mile and an half of the place. By some means or other old John∣ston got notice of it, thinking it was not possible for Redmond to escape over so broad a river while the tide was in, for he had no other way left. When old Johnston and his men came near, they observed that Redmond <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d stript off his cloathes, and tied them on his back, and which he took to the river, and swam down, mostly under water, for above two hundred yards. This prevented his receiving the shot of his pursuers 'till out of danger; and what was as remarkable as this, when Mr. Johnston set his dog after him to seize him, the dog snapt at the coat, and at the same time Redmond turned about, and took hold of the dog by the throat &amp; dragged him along with

<P>He was now under more apprehensions of dan∣ger than ever, he appeared but seldom publicly abroad; yet though he was somewhat advanced in years, he fell desperately in love with an inn keeper's daughter, a very beautiful young wo∣man, who he at last prevailed upon, by intreaties and valuable gifts, after a long suit to yield to his lustful embraces, upon a kind of a sham mar∣riage. However, he was very fond of her, and spent most of his time in her company, 'till her father hearing who he was, and what reward was offered for apprehending him, endeavoured to get her to betray him; but all to no purpose, for it only gave Redmond warning to conceal himself with more caution. But at length one Doug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as, a minister of the Church established, in the parish where the young woman mostly resided, know∣ing she was brought up a Protestant, and that Redmond only went to hear mass (if he frequent∣ed any place of worship at all) thought that she might be prevailed upon, on this account, to make a discovery; but all his endeavours even appear∣ed to be fruitless for a long time, till Redmond took some occasion to abuse her; then Douglas began to work on her again, and at last obtained
<PB N="35" REF="035355_0034_10049CA99B7F4E80"/>his end. The young woman, according to her promise to Douglass, took an apportunity to send a messenger to him, and gave him notice where Redmond was, just as he was going into bed after a hard fit of drinking. In a little time after a guard came up and took him asleep, and he was hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried to Armagh and put into goal, with above twelve stone of irons upon him, where he remained till the assizes, and being t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed was found guilty of such a number of facts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What the old women say of his mother's dreams, of her going to consult an astr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loger upon his birth, and of his having a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his breast when born, is an old story and a fiction; tho' it is certain that his exploits spread his fame through most countries in Europe.

He that shot

<HEAD>The life of Capt. Power, a genteel Robber.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN Power was a younger son of a worthy gentleman, who had a good freehold or estate Kilvallen, in the county of Cork; but having entered into a suit of law, contrary to his elder brother's advice, was cast; upon which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hdrew privately, and contemned all proceed∣ings at law. 'till a writ of outlawry was issued out against him, so that he thought himself not secure in any public place. There had been some difference between him and his brother before that, and being somewhat disgusted, his
<PB N="37" REF="035355_0036_10049CE419112CE0"/>high spirit chose to undertake any way of living rather than submit to the courtesy of friends. He was at length prevailed upon to try his for∣tune on the highway, and had great luck; but was never observed to abuse any travellers un∣less they opposed him. Some offers were made for granting him his pardon; yet he was afraid to come in, and continued a survey or of the roads till his death.</P>
<P>After his refusal of accepting the King's par∣don, a proclamation was issued out, and a reward offered for taking him; but he still pursued his usual courses, till his character was thoroughly established. It once happened that an ensign in Cork was informed that Captain P—r was drinking alone at an ion on the road leading from Kilworth, and hearing that there was a re∣ward of forty pounds offered for apprehending him, he went out within file or two of musque∣teers, who all entered the house in the evening, before P—r was aware. P—r was sitting in a room or parlour at the end of the house when the officer came in, and enquired for him, who being told where he was, went into the room (first having desired admittance) to take share of a bottle with him, leaving the men together over a pot of ale in the kitchen. After some discourse our officer challenged him, and said he was his prisoner; but P—r was too many for him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he fastened the door, and with a pistol cocked and sword drawn in his hand, demanded the ensign's money: and after he had secured it, he left the officer bound on the bed, and stole out of the house unpercieved by the soldiers, who th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>
<PB N="38" REF="035355_0037_10049CE5C1D5AA60"/>the prisoner safe, drank too hard, and then they marched back to Cork, like so many fools. By this we learn how foolish a thing it is to trust a prisoner's honour when his life is in dauger.</P>
<P>Capt. P—r made some advances after this, in Lienster, where coming one evening to an ob∣scure farmer's house, expecting to get a night's lodging, he observed that the man and his wife were in deep sorrow, which occasioned him to de∣mand the cause of their grief. After many pauses the farmer at last told him, that having run in ar∣rears with the landlord, he had caused him to be served with an ejectment, and that in a few days he would be turned out of possession, and all the effects he had taken from him; upon this P—r took compassion on them, and grew more and more solicitous, 'till he found out what day the landlord intended to take possession. Then he ask'd the farmer, "whether he had any friend at all that would endeavour to help him?" The farmer said he knew of none. Then said P—r, "If a friend should be so kind as to lend so much money (which he understood to be about sixty pounds) as would clear your landlord, would you repay it again of you could." "Indeed, said the farmer, I would if I could." Well then, says P—r, here is the sum; I'll be your friend so far as to lend it to you only upon our own note;" which he gave him, promising not to let his landlord know that he had any money 'till he had made all the excuses that were possible, say even so far as to let him begin to drive the cattle and turn him out of possession. This passed on very well till the landlord came with
<PB N="39" REF="035355_0038_10049CEE8106A260"/>the Sheriff, in order to possess himself: and after the tenant delayed as long as it was safe, he at last told him, that a friend of his had left so much money with him to keep, and rather than be turn∣ed out a beggar, he would give it to his landlord and let his friend wait 'till he could rise it.</P>
<P>The landlord accepted the money; but was obliged to give an acquittance in full for all rent and arrears whatsoever, and then, after having abused his tenant and called him a rogue and a villain several times, because he did not pay the money long before that, thinking it was his own, he mounted his horse and rode home-wards, the Sheriff having taken another way.</P>
<P>P—r in disguise way-laid the landlord on the road, and took all the cash, with a watch, and some other things of value, from him; and meet∣ing his tenant two or three days afterwards, told him his money was unlucky, for he had lost it, every penny, and a good deal more with it, on the road, being taken from him by an highway robber, whom he described as well as he could, not remembering ever to have seen him. In less than a week, P—r called at the farmer's house dressed as he was at first, in order to see how he fared. The farmer told him the whole story, and how that his landlord was robbed (which he was little sorry for) on the road. He entertain∣ed P—r very handsomely that night (not mistrusting that he was the robber) and gave him a thousand thanks for the use of his money, pro∣mising to raise it for him as soon as he could. P—r seeing the man's intregrity, desired him to be under no concern for it; then tearing
<PB N="40" REF="035355_0039_10049CF015CA6650"/>the note to pieces, bid the farmer adieu.</P>
<P>We have but an imperfect account of the rest of the actions of his life. However, by all re∣ports, he was very generous to the poor, and of∣ten told the rich that he took their purses to make a distribution among such as were in want. He was at last betrayed, for a small reward by his brother's servant maid, who seeming to be his friend, sat drinking with him at an alchouse near Cork, 'till the got an opportunity of pouring wa∣ter into the pans of his blunderbuss and pistols, and then sent privately for the guards, who surroun∣ded the house and made him aprisoner. He was taken to Cork bound, and being there tried and found guilty, was according executed, much about the time that Redmond O'H—n came first in vogue. He was only dubbed a captain, by rea∣son of his exploits, by the rest of the society.</P>
<P>At the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of execution, he gave a very kind caution to all young men, desiring them to shun the company of lewd women. It was by giving himself too much indulgence with such cattle that he was prevented from accepting his pardon when offered, which at last brought him to that ignominious death. By woman (said he) was I enticed to continue in sin, and by a woman was I at last betrayed, tho' she pretended to be my friend. Which speech melted the spectators into tears.</P>

<HEAD>Some passages of the Life of strong John Mac∣pherson, a notorious Robber.</HEAD>
<P>I Could never learn certainly where John Macpherson was born; but his parents were not so poor but they were able to bequeath him a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty little income at their death. He was then about nineteen years of age when the effects came into his hands, which he made a shift to spend in the company of lewd women and game∣sters in less than three years, in which time he was always a leading man at hurling, patterns, and matches of football, and acquired such fame by his wondrous activity, that no stagie person dared to oppose him at any exercise. He was accounted in his time the strongest man in the nation; he would hold an hundred weight at arms length in one hand, and would make little or no∣thing of twisting a new horse-shoe round like a gad; yet notwithstanding all his activity, he was soon reduced to poverty, and so, from one step after another, brought to the gallows. Want of precaution and care in the beginning, often lays men under difficulties they can never sur∣mount; and men that are bred up in luxury and idleness, seldom settle themselves rightly to busi∣ness after. Nothing is more commendable in youth than industry, 'tis the bulwark and preser∣vation of common wealths, and the support of private persons and families. When vice ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="42" REF="035355_0041_10049CF7BB503828"/>settled itself in the bone, no medicine that can be applied to the flesh can expel it. Of this kind we have an example before us. This Macpherson, when he had sold his little income, and spent what he had, was under the necessity of seeking for a livelihood some how. He was a stranger to work, and it was beneath him to beg, neither could he brook to rely on the courtesy of his friends, who (as it usually falls out in such cases) began to look very shy upon him.</P>
<P>Upon this he began to think of a new way of living, and having provided himself with some weapons and a very good staff, he betook himself to the high road, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough from his native place not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be known. In his first attempts when he came up with any one he knew had money, he first requested of them to lend him some, and if by terror or persuasion he could prevail on them so to do, he would be pretty moderate, and com∣monly took but a part; but, on resistance, he made little or nothing of taking a man by the arm and pulling him off his horse; he then usually would give him a pretty hearty squeeze, which seldom failed to bring him into compliance, and to deliver without further trouble; yet if a man s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill continued sturdy, his custom was to throw him over his shoulders, and run away with him to some private p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, and there rifle him: what become of his horse he mattered not.</P>
<P>This was his common and usual way of rob∣bing, which he continued for many years, very seldom with company, but mostly alone. One ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g he went into a country house by himself, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed all the people he met i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>This method of taking up the women, when he was hard set, he always after practised, and it still answered his ends: and these are two exam∣ples of his common way of robbing.

However he was at last taken by treachery, and after being tried and found guilty, was dispatched by the common fin∣isher of the law, about the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>78.

<HEAD>The History of Patrick Fleming, a Notorious robber.</HEAD>
<P>THE parents of Patrick Fleming were very poor people, and when he was born lived in At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lone, supporting themselves only by hard labour; yet as poor as they were, they took some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to send him to school as long as they could aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd, and, being a boy of ready wit, he learned to read and write tolerable well in a short time. At thirteen years of age he was recommended to the countess of Kildare for a footboy; but when he came to get a full belly, he grew so un∣lucky and negligent of his business that he was soon dismis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. Some time after, he got into the service of the earl of Antrim, where he commit∣ted so many unlucky tricks, that a man would be tired to rehearse the tenth part of them; he was soon turned out of the earl's service, tho' not be∣fore he took an opportunity of conveying out of the house plate and money to the value of 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> with which he sled into the county of Roscommon, in Connaught, and hid himself in a cave near the river Shannon for about a fortnight, never stirring out but in the evening for a little provisi∣on, till the hue and cry was over, and then he went to Dublin where, for the space of six years, he committed more robberies than ever was known before in that time; he continued in Dublin for the space of four years, with the greatest success

As soon as he got clear off this job, he fell to his old trade again, of stealing, robbing and knocking men down in the night which he continued near two years longer, 'till at length he became so well known that the people would point him out in the day-time going along the streets, but were afraid to lay violent hands on him, having the name of being such a violent rogue and barba∣rous murderer, and that also in a very trouble∣some time: however, it was his fate to be once more seized and committed to jail in Dublin, where the trial went so hard against him, that he swore he would never ventue a third trial in the same place, and accordingly, as soon as he got clear, with one or two of his trusty accom∣plices, having prepared proper materials for a tent, they went down well armed and mounted, and set up on the edge of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of Allen, not car∣ring to venture himself in strange houses at that time, having fixed his scouts, and learned the roads of the country very well; his new successes puf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him up with so much impudence, that his u∣sual compliment was I am chief lord of the coun∣try and collector of this road; you shall pay tri∣bute to Patrick F—g. In one morning, with very little assistance, he robbed no less than 125
<PB N="46" REF="035355_0045_10049D0315EDF7C8"/>men, on the mount of Barrimore, and was so lit∣tle afraid of being taken, that he lay within ten miles of the place the next night, where he gave the servant maid a couple of pieces of gold for some obligations she had done him, withal telling her how he got them; nay, so great was his in∣solence, that his frequent apology to persons of quality, when he met them on the road, was, I am Patrick F—g the greatest man by birth in the kingdom, and the best bred, you must come down to support my grandeur. It was his luck once, tho' alone, to have the honor of robbing both the primate and bishop of Raphoe, as they were riding together in a coach, with six men at∣tending them; and because they made no resis∣tance, he used them very honourably, doing no further damage, after borrowing what money and bills they had, than cutting the reins of the bri∣dles, to prevent a pursuit. Another time he met with the lady Baltimore, from whom he took 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in money, a diamond ring and a watch, but not contented therewith, he took her son a child of four years old prisoner, whom she was obliged to ransom for 300 more in twenty four hours, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t F—g should kill him, as he swore he would, if she refused. Not long after this, having notice that the archbishop of Tuam was going to Dublin with 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in money, he way-laid him, took eve∣ry farthing, and abused his servants and horses, for making resistance, after such a manner, that his grace was obliged to wait at a paltry ale-house three days for a fresh set of horses, and one of the servants was three months before his wounds were healed. Nevertheless, the Bishop being
<PB N="47" REF="035355_0046_10049D04A8FFB270"/>well beloved in the neighbourhood, and offer∣ing rewards, the country resolved to take Patrick if poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole which obliged him to shift his quarters, and fly into the province of Munster for safety.

<P>Nevertheless, he continued his villainies after this so long in Munster, that examinations were sworn against him for murdering five men and two woman, with a boy of fourteen years of age, at sundry times, besides robbing them of all they had. And it was said, that having met with Sir Donough O'Brier, he abused him most grosly, (upon his refusing to deliver upon F—g's orders) and cut off his nose and one of his ears with a hanger, tho' he made a very gallant resis∣tance; but shortly after a proclamation was is∣sued out, offering a reward of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling, for the taking of him dead or alive, which obliged him to shift his quarters to the bog of Allen again, fixing an ale-house near Manooth for one of his places of rendezvous.</P>

Next morning the sheriff appeared with a strong guard, and sur∣rounded the house, which Patrick and his associ∣ates surprized at so sudden an attack, fled to their arms in a kind of confusion which increased the more as they found them of no service. Thus they were all taken prisoners, and hanged at Dublin, on Wednesday the 24th of April, 1650. Fleming was hanged in chains not far from the city.</P>

<HEAD>The History of Irish Teague, alias William Mac∣quire, an Irish Robber.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM MACQUIRE was born near Athenree in the county of Galway, and by report (tho' without any solid foundation, for he gave him no schooling) was the natural son of an Irish lawyer, who took care and provided for him 'till he was sixteen years of age in the nature of a poor boy or servant; but the lawer dying, and
<PB N="49" REF="035355_0048_10049D0B05735AF0"/>Macquire being by nature viciously inclined, fell into bad company, and lost all the good impressi∣ons of his education and religion, retaining no∣thing but the brogue upon his tongue, which he could never wear out, tho' i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> underwent a long course of English exercise. At about twenty years of age he arrived in England, and soon got into a gang of thieves, among whom he was known by a number of names, as Macquire, Ballie, Irish Teague, &amp;c. but in the first attempt which he made at house breaking, he discovered as great a capacity for that undertaking as ever the great Charles Dempsy did at horse stealing.</P>
<P>For having made a combination with three o∣ther rogues, they broke into a gentleman's house at Frentwood in Essex, and binding all the people, took away four diamond rings, a great quantity of plate, and about 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in money; this was the first attempt, and tho' he had but three to assist him, they overpowered no less than ten men and boys, without making the least disturbance, and tied them every one in such a manner that one could not relieve another: by which means Teague and his gang had sufficient time to make off.</P>
<P>After this Macquire, with one assistant, broke into chancellor Jeffreys's house at Westminster, and stole the purse and mace, which he made his comrade carry on his shoulder thro' the park to the house where they lodged, and then locked them up in a closet; but some of the jewels that were in the purse happened to fall out in the chamber, and Macquire, being gone into the
<PB N="50" REF="035355_0049_10049D0D8E293E80"/>country, the landlord in his absence had occasion to go into the room, where finding the jewels on the floor it gave him a strong suspicion of the ro∣guery, upon which he broke open a closet door, and found the mace, which he restored to the chancellor, withal telling him how he got it; for which he was rewarded. Macquire hearing what had happened, took care to shun his landlord's house for about a quarter of a year after, 'till at length finding an opportunity, for the sake of re∣venge, he broke open his house, and robbed him of money and goods to the value of eighty pounds, and secured them for his own use. Now Tea∣gue scorning to be a house robber any longer, thinking that it was too mean an employment, to began to try his fortune on the highway, and stealing an horse from councellor Thrusby in Burleigh-street on the Strand, and a pair of pistols from Robert Williams, a goldsmith in George yard Westminster, his first attack was upon Alex∣ander Oldyss a diminutive son of the muses, both in wit and stature, who was frequent in paying visits to a patron of his who lived near Hammer∣smith, and being potvalliant when Macquire stop∣ped him, he asked him, with a haughty voice, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e durst s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p any son of the muses on the high-way; it being not only an affront to him, but to App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llo and the sacred nine. Teague hearing him use such lofty language, which he did not well understand, began to state at him, and said. What the devil sort of a son is dat, a son of the Muses? By my troth, if you call your∣self a son of some outlandish bitch, I'll not mis∣doubt you; but wor all da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and by shaint Pa∣trick,
<PB N="51" REF="035355_0050_10049D0F296AE7C0"/>I don't care a third for you, nor Pollo, nor ever a son of a whore in the whole world; so come deliver your monies, or I'll be after sending you to hell with the shot in this pistol. After Oldyss had given a great many flourishes with his sword, he was obliged to give Teague three pence halfpenny, that being all the money he had about him; but Teague, not satisfied therewith, took a∣way the poet's sword, the loss whereof threw him into a fit of sickness, that had like to have cost him his life.</P>
<P>Another time meeting with lady Overquerque, as she was returning from Bath, slenderly attend∣ed, he desired her to lend what money she had a∣bout her, saying, Madam, af you will lend me what monies you have about you, because I have business wid it to-morrow, reckon it out here, and I will give it to you again; the first place I will meet you; the lady hesitating a while, says Teague again, tho' he could neither read or write) madam, If you doubt my word I will give you my bond. To which the lady answered, here is ne'er a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivener. By my shoul, says Teague, I will maak one myself, but you must let me count the monies first. Teague answered, by my snoul and shalvation, madam, I am a stranger up∣on the country, and I want monies, and what's lying good for? af you lend it to me. I won't give it to you again; and af I rob you I will keep it, and that's all the difference I make between robbing and borrowing; and so, madam, give me your monies quickly, either one way or the other, or I will be very enruly wid you. Whereupon presenting his pistols, she gave him a purse of
<PB N="52" REF="035355_0051_10049D10C5165670"/>gold, a watch, and two diamond rings.</P>
<P>After this meeting with a lieutenant of the army, near Uxbridge, he bid him stand and deli∣ver, or he was a dead man. The officer, surpri∣zed at such usage, told him he never knew a highwayman rob any of his coat, because they hazard their lives in defence of there country. By my shalvation, says Teague, I don't care a half∣penny for one man above another, and besides, you sort of gentlemen will fight more for the sake of the women and the ladies, nor you would for your king or your country, af you were not well paid for it. Let me see how you will fight me for your honour now; for my troth, your tongue shant secure your purse. The lieutenant, startled at this speech, gave him six pounds, out of which Teague returned him ten shillings back to bear his charges.</P>
<P>Afterwards meeting with captain Shutter on Hownslow-Health, he demanded his money: but the captain making a stout resistance, a bloody bat∣tle ensued: at last Teague shot him through the head, and then stript him of fifty guineas and a watch, with which he made off. But he was shortly after apprehended, and hanged at Tyburn, with William Selward, his companion, and eight others, on Friday, the first of May, 1691.</P>

<HEAD>The Life of Richard Balf, a most notorious Mur∣derer and Highwayman.</HEAD>
<P>THE reputed father of Richard Balf, was a pedler, tho' but of small account, who with his wife, was accustomed to travel to fairs and markets up and down the country, on pretence of getting bread; but, as the story goes, having learn∣ed all the artifice of canting, they got more by begging and cheating than by fair dealing; and at length by thieving and robbing, made a shift to obtain the favour of a hempen necklace, which eased them of their care, and was administered to them by their son Dick, for robbing and murder∣ing in the manner following. Having cast their eyes upon a lone house in the country, wherein it was reported the owner kept a considerable sum of money, they had an itching desire to be at it; and accordingly one night having laid their scheme, (with their son Dick, not above fifteen years of age, and one more, to assist them) they entered the house by some stratagem, and the family being fast asleep, they thought it the saf∣est way to dispatch them; so beginning with the servant maids, they cut both their throats with a knife, then going to the servant-man, and served him the same way, also three children, who lay in a room adjoining; lastly, proceeding to the a∣partment where the Master and Mistress lay, they thought it would be convenient to make them
<PB N="54" REF="035355_0053_10049D178D36A508"/>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where their treasure lay; and consulting what method to take for the purpose, it was re∣solved to put the man to torture; but his answers not satisfying the robbers, they dispatched them both, and sell to plundering the house. When they had gathered all the booty they could find in the house they marched off; but as it common∣ly happens, that murder is found out by one means or other, so this was happily discovered by the mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derers disagreeing among themselves about the dividing the spoil.</P>
<P>Dick and his parents were all taken up and put into prison, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ied and convicted of murder; but so it fell out, that the judge taking compassion of the boy's youth, and as no hangman was to be had, the son was granted his pardon to account of executing his father and mother. It was Dick's comfort, when they came to the gallows, to hear them say before all the good company, that they had rather be hanged by their son than by any body else, because they made no doubt but he would use them as kindly as he ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected shortly to be used himself; which being the dying words of his parents, made him very careful of tying the ends of the rope fast, to dispatch them the more speedy and surely.</P>
<P>Dick having seen the exit of his parents, was very much discouraged, for a while, from follow∣ing their practices, and proposed going to service for an honest livelihood; but no body being wil∣ling to receive him on account of their exaltati∣on, and time having worn out the good impressi∣ons that were made on his mind by their case, what was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppear e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce
<PB N="55" REF="035355_0054_10049D1A2D04C3D8"/>more in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sh; so he betook himself to picking of pockets, till being often in the chair and duck∣ed in a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pond (which was a sort of punish∣ment then used for several kinds of pretty-larceny) he grew tired of that calling, and enlisted him∣self into a gang of robbers, who made it their bu∣siness to steal all kinds of cattle that came in their way; it would be surprising to hear of the me∣thods these rogues had of conveying cattle away in the right. But, however, this trade was at∣tended with so much trouble, and not answering his end, that B—f soon grow tired of it, and became a cygaret, whose business is to cut off the skirts of a coat, gown, &amp;c. or any other part of a garment that hangs loose when people are at their devotion, or in any public assembly: which not answering well, he entered himself into a gang of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umers, who either by scaling walls with rope ladders, or creeping in at holes and windows in the night, rob houses privately. It happened one night, that Dick being on an exploit of this kind, be found a considerable booty of plate, and other valuable things, worth at least 150 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he sell into a blanket held by his comrades at the bottom of the window, to receive the plunder. He had but two comrades, and they being brothers seeing so valuable a prize in a small bulk, conclud∣ed to keep it to themselves, and leave Dick to take care of himself: and accordingly, taking a way the rope ladder, they made off with the prey, and left b—f to come down as he could. B—f, seeing himself outwitted, could not tell what to do, 'till observing there was a new bed∣ead in the room but newly corded, he cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
<PB N="56" REF="035355_0055_10049D1BDC421D98"/>the cord with as little noise as possible, and fas∣tening one end of it in the room, he let himself down into the street. He was no sooner on his feet, but he began to meditate revenge, and im∣mediately posted away to the place of ren∣dezvous, telling his comrades they were all discovered, and the people wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m they had robbed were in hot pursuit of then, just at his heels. Before the words were well out of his mouth, they ran away helter skelt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and left all the booty, both money and plate, be∣hind them; but Dick had the wit to stay, and se∣cure it for his own use, and would never give any part thereof to his comrades.</P>
<P>When he had got so much insight and expe∣rience in this business as to make himself a com∣pleat master, he goes next into a crew of Wool-combers, whose business is to snach hats, cloaks, wigs, and women's handherchiefs, &amp;c. off in the night; but at length being taken in the fact at Galway, by a gentleman who pursued and over∣took him with a sword drawn in his hand, he was committed to goal and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rned in the hand for the same offence.</P>
<P>This business not answering his purpose, he took a resolution to commence high-way robber; but being a little at a loss for a good n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to mount himself on, he contrived to get one in this manner: He observed there was a neighbour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is land∣lord's in Galway that had a very well bred geld∣ing of a good size, very fit for his purpose, and that there was no obstacle to hinder him from stealing it but the stable door, which was still kept locked; to remove this difficulty, he went
<PB N="57" REF="035355_0056_10049D1E1347E9C0"/>to an old comrade of his whom he knew to be an expert pick-lock, and agreed with him to open the stable door, the next night at an hour that was fixed. A heavy shower of rain favouring B—f's design, be carried with him four old coarse stock∣ings, and put a little hay in the feet of them, drew them on the horse, and led him saddled, and bridled thro' the gate way, without making any noise. As soon as he had got the horse in∣to the street (without staying to take off the stocking which he thought would be soon torn off with riding, in which he guessed right) he mounted and made off, without taking leave of any body, having taken care to provide himself with a good case of pistols and a cutlass, before∣hand; but never thought proper after to enquire what time the owner missed his horse, or what search he made after him.</P>
<P>Thus accoutred, and well mounted on a good nag, he rode all night 'till he came to the house of one of his acquaintance, near Athlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where he lay concealed with his hors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 'till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext, re∣solving not to make a public appearance 'till he got a good distance from Galway.</P>
<P>He then moved to the north and began his new trade of 'Stand, and deliver,' as is usual with men of his rank, and had such wonderful suc∣cess in his e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terprizes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bbing passengers on the road, that above fifty travellers had been com∣pelled to deliver him their purses of considerable value, in six mouths time, which made the people so timorous, that they carried no money about them, except travelling charges: by which means Dick often m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with disappointments, which
<PB N="58" REF="035355_0057_10049D239A9CDDC0"/>enraged him to that degree, that in revenge, as he called, it, he neither spared man, woman, or child, that fell in his way.</P>
<P>Such disappointments made him think it neces∣sary to change his quarter, for a while; and ac∣cordingly, having fixed his place of rende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vous, he scoured the other three provinces with the like success, and thought the whole nation scarce∣ly large enough to furnish him with occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>; and like death, never took any denial 'till he was satisfied.</P>
<P>One day, as he was hunting in quest of his game, he met the earl of D—l, between Bally∣shannon and Sligo, in his coach, and made his servants prisoners, and rode up to the earl, expec∣ting large booty; but finding he had no more than 150 guineas about him, B—f was very much dissatisfied at it, and ordered him to draw a bill of 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> on a certain goldsmith in Dublin, to ran∣some his coach horses from being killed. As soon as Dick received the bill, (leaving the servants ti∣ed) he cut the harness, and made what speed he could to Dublin, where he received value for the note without being apprehended.</P>
<P>He was so notorious for robbing on the mount of Barrimore, that a guard-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lt by or∣der of the government in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tle of it, to se∣cure passengers from being robbed by him; which was continually supplied with a company of sol∣diers, either from Londonderry, Cole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, or Bel∣fas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>This being B—f's head quarters at that time, he was obliged to shift; so moving towards Lorras, he finds new quarters; where one day meeting
<PB N="59" REF="035355_0058_10049D252FF94BB8"/>with Gen. In—y, tho' he had several atten∣dants waiting on him, Dick resolutely rode up to him, &amp; commanded, him to stand &amp; deliver; but the General refusing to obey his orders, a sharp engagement began betwixt them. The General d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew out a pistol, but before he could have it rea∣dy, his horse was shot under him; the pistol in his hand went off in the fall, without doing any harm, and B—f took care to secure the o∣ther: The groom was the first that came to assist his mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, who seeing him in such danger went up resolutely, thinking to seize upon Dick, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld him 'till hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fellow servants came to his assis∣tance; but the poor fellow had the misfortune to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shot dead on the spot in making the attempt. The General feeing his horse and man both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, and B—f continue his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esolution to conquer or die, conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to let him take 80 guineas, a di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mond ring, and a gold watch, with which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ode off, and left the General to ride the groom's horse.</P>
<P>Not for this action alone, but for several full as bold and daring, B—f by this time was be∣come so notorious that a reward of 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> from the government, by proclamation was offered for the taking him: This encouraged several people to join themselves in parties to go in quest of him: but be being timely informed of it, employed some spies whom he kept in fee, to give him al∣ways notice before hand of their coming out. Accordingly one morning, as he sat by the sire in one of his houses or rendezvous, he had notice that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e men were in pursuit of him, and that they were very near, intending to search that
<PB N="60" REF="035355_0059_10049D27B5DE5050"/>house. B—f, not knowing which road was safest to take, was rosolved once to stand and sight for his life, but withal not without having recourse to some stratagem. Then having exchanged coats with the man of the house, who was his confidant, he ordered him to go out at a back win∣dow, and hide himself in a barn behind the house, just as the men came before the door. The fel∣low acted his part so well, that they saw him go thro' the window, and likewise in at the barn door, when he took care to hide himself effectually by going under some straw where there was a communication made under ground between the house and the barn: in the mean while, Dick was so well fixed in his fortification, that he might have shot ten men without any harm.</P>
<P>When the pursuers saw the man, whom they took for B—f, enter the barn, they went di∣rectly to it, setting a guard at the door, whilst the rest examined the outside for fear he should escape at any window or private hole: but finding no such place they all came to the door, resolved on a thorough search. When they had searched on a long time to no purpose, they began to move a great heap of straw from one end of the barn to the other, big with hopes of finding what they came for, leaving only two at the door. While they were thus employed, B—f comes una∣wares, in disguise upon the centi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els, first discharg∣ing a piece upon them, and then drawing his sword, which terrified them so much, that they fled to the further side of the barn for sear, while he shut the door upon them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ened it so se∣cure that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>possible for them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t out
<PB N="61" REF="035355_0060_10049D2971724788"/>without help; and when he had done, set fire to the barn, mounted his horse, and bid them get out as well as they could.</P>
<P>After this he began to be more and more afraid of staying in his own country; so stying to Do∣naghadee, a sea-port town in the north of Ireland, he took shipping, and landed at Port-Patrick in Scotland; where meeting with an handsome agreeable landlady, he picked up acquaintance with her, which gave occasion to her husband to be jealous, who in revenge, understanding well enough what he was, caused b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be seized and sent over to Ireland again; He was brought pi∣nioned through all the country to Dublin, com∣mitted there to Newgate, and shortly after was tried and condemned. While he was under sen∣tence of condemnation, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered five thousand pounds to save his life, but the government was not to be bribed to save a ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e from the gallows, so he was ordered to die, and accordingly hang∣ed he was at Dublin, on Friday the 25th of May. 1702, ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d 29 years, and then hanged in chams on the mount of Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sinore in the province of Ulster.</P>
<P>Jack Balf and his brother (of said family) were born some miles from Dunlaven, on the moun∣tains of Wicklow; Jack was pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apprentice to a stocking weaver, but was never suspected of misbehaviour till after his brother's suspension on the three-legged tree at Stephen's Green, soon after which he made an alteration in his business, and turned surveyor of the roads, without licence. And as he had been bred on the mountains, he

<P>The counsellor had been in Dublin all Michael∣mas term, where having fleeced a great number of geese, he was returning home to Munster, with the feathers, a little before Christmas; of which honest Jack Balf having previous intellegence, contrived the following project, in order to become a partner with the lawyer, which he luckily ef∣fected, near Blessingt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, as follows: when Jack had notice that the lawyer, with sundry other gentlemen, had left Dublin, attended by sever∣al servants all armed for the protecting their store, he placed himself at a private house near the road 'till they passed by; then plunging his horse into water, to wet him all over, he mounts and gallops after company, and soon overtook them, with hat in hand, puff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g and blowing, as if he had rode at that rate a dozen miles; upon which he immediately enquires for the counsellor, al∣ledging that he had an extraordinary case to lay before him, and said, that he had followed him post haste from Dublin, where he missed of him by coming in too late the night before. Having thus deceived the company, and appearing like a gentleman, he was introduced to the lawyer, whom he presented with a fee of six guineas, ear∣nestly desiring him to hear the case out of hand, for he would be satisfied with the opinion of no o∣ther;
<PB N="63" REF="035355_0062_10049D2F895A7C48"/>then he pulls out a paper touching the state of his case, which as it requied privacy, he pre∣vailed on the counsellor to ride slowly for a while, 'till it was read to him: in the mean time the rest of the company went on and left them be∣hind; which as soon as Jack perceived, and, a convenient place offering, he draws out a pistol, claps it to the lawyer's breast, and demands his money; which it seems was very considerable. The lawyer, astonished at this sudden change of his behaviour, began to hesitate, like a young o∣rator at the bar, to prolong the time; but Jack wanted no trifling, 'Deliver, or death' was the word; and so the lawyer gave him a purse of 300 pieces of gold. Upon which Jack took his leave of them all, and fled directly to the mountains, where they thought to pursue him; but the day being short, and Jack's roads impassible for stran∣gers, they went on homewards, where ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rived, the counsellor pursued his folios til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣lowing term, and then returned to Dublin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere he had the pleasure, a few months after, of speak∣ing a good word for honest Jack at the bar, who by the general voice of court and country, was voted to the care of the finisher of the law, and accordingly executed at Stephen's-Green, afore∣said where his brother had been exalted to the same dignity but a short while before.</P>

<HEAD>The History of James Butler, a notorious High∣wayman, Robber, and Murderer.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES BUTLER was born and bred in Kil∣kenny, and in his pupilage kept pretty much to school; but his learning did him little service, tho' he spoke Latin pretty fluently. When he arrived to man's estate he enlisted himself a sol∣dier in lord Gal way's regiment, and went with the army to Spain, where they had not been long before he deserted to the Spaniards, as his favour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> party, but meeting with some usage among them that he did not relish, he soon grew tired of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>litary life, and gave the Spaniards the go-by also. Thinking himself in danger in Spain, and not finding a convenient opportunity of returning home, his fancy led him into Andalusia, where he for no for a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntebank, and had wonderful suc∣cess in raising his reputation and performing cures, that at length he undertook the method of easing the men of troublesome wives, who were taken to him by wholesale: and this brought more grist to his mill than any other part of his practice. So great was his fame at last, that he outwitted the famous Dr. Thornhill, who offered to be his mer∣ry Andrew, upon condition that he would teach him his Irish assurance, but whether Thornhill did it to get rid of his ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>npetitor or not, I cant tell;
<PB N="65" REF="035355_0064_10049D3449594B98"/>however it happened that he was discovered, and to prevent danger made the best of his way to Venice, where he set up for a conjurer; but not managing this business so well as the former, suc∣cess failed him, and he joined with a company of banditti (a kind of highwaymen so called in Italy.) While he was in this company, they had the good fortune one morning to meet with a fat, lus∣ty, medicant fryar whom they robbed, taking from him to the value of 20,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he was going to carry to Modena for the widow of the late King James II. queen dowager of England; but the captain of the gang dividing the booty, ordered Butler but a small part not half his por∣tion, which stomached him so much that he left them, and went to Florence, and by this time had learned to speak both Spanish and Italian. While he was at Florence, his curiosity led him to go and see a man executed, where he singled out a young gentleman, with whom he had some con∣fabulation; and among the rest of his discourse, he said, 'the man was a fool for suffering himself to be taken.' At these words, the gentleman taking him to be a man of resolution, carried him to a tavern, and having sounded him pretty well, offered him 500 pieces of gold to murder an un∣cle of his, that he might enjoy his estate. B—r assented to the proposal, and went immediately to one of the banditti, with whom he agreed con∣cerning the matter of the murder; and taking him along with him, about eleven o'clock at night, to the old man's house, they made a quick dispatch of his life. This being done and the reward paid
<PB N="66" REF="035355_0065_10049D7930BEBE98"/>them, as soon as B—r got a convenient opportu∣ninity, he likewise put an end to the young man's life, to prevent him from discovering, and for the same reason in a little time afterwards he mur∣dered his comrade in like manner.</P>
<P>But having thus committed three murders, the rumour whereof spread far and near, he grew a little afraid of his mother's calf-skin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied di∣rectly to Paris, where, he soon introduced himself into Cartouche's gang, with whom he of∣ten went out in quest of prey; but they not al∣ways distributing the booty equitable, as he thought, he ventured to go out one morning a∣lone, and in his survey, having notice that a young gentleman of Campagne, was come to Paris on purpose to study, he met him, and accosted him pretending to be a scholar also, and then taking him to the college of Navarre, he led him through the walks, on pretence of entertaining him with some new discourses, 'till they came to a remote c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rner and then he robbed him. But beginning to grow too notori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us in France, and not over well liked by his comrades neither, he packed up his awls, and went into Holland; and in his travels overtaking a genteel young woman near Rotterdam he began to make love, and grow ve∣ry sweet upon her; she seemed at f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t coy, but after some discourse had passed, upon further ap∣plication, she grew more familiar, and agreed to pass for his wife, and lie with him that night up∣on condition not to meddle with her without her consent; to which he agreed and gave his oath to perform the obligation. However not being able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue, they stopped short at
<PB N="67" REF="035355_0066_10049D7BC3B2FDB0"/>an inn on the road, where, after supper the young lady retired with her landlady to the bed chamber leaving her pretended husband and the host in company together, who drank pretty heartily, the one for joy of his expecting pleasures, and the o∣ther for sake of his own interest, till B—r grew some-thing mellow; at length he went to bed, where he found his mistress according to his heart's desire, with whom he spent great part of the night in caresses and embraces, 'till at length being fatigued with excess of love, and overwhel∣med with wine, he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll fast asleep. As soon as his supposed wife saw day-light, (and perceiving how seenre he lay,) she rose and casting for her husband's portmanteau, under pretence of getting some linen, took out of it about 300 pieces of gold; this being done to her liking, she ordered the ostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to saddle her husband's horse for her, to go and pay a friend of her's a visit, but took ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to ride off, and let none of them hear any more of her afterwards. When B—r awa∣kened, threw his arms about expecting to grasp his dear mistress; but finding himself disappoint∣ed, in order to make enquiry about her, and to know the time of the day, he called the landlord who told him, 'his lady was a very early wo∣man, for she had rid abroad three or four hours before: Surprised at this news, B—r started up, and ran for his portmanteau, which when he had searched, he immediately found how finely he was tricked; yet he could not find in his he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to asperse her, or much to blame herself, becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he lived by tricking. However thus outwitte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as he was, he sold his lady's horse, and having
<PB N="68" REF="035355_0067_10049D7D7A5A08B8"/>paid his reckoning, with the remainder of the mo∣ney he made the best of his way to England, where fortune forsaking him, the lady poverty come to pay a visit and could never be persuad∣ed to abandon him 'till she had brought him to a very low ebb. Being reduced to this condition, he happened one day to pick up a fresh acquain∣tance with Mrs. Impudence, who accompanied him and two others to King's gate in Gray's-Inn lane, where they attacked and stopped a coach; but finding a vigorious resistance, were obliged to hurry, and ride off as fast as they could: How∣ever, B—r was pursued, taken and committed to Newgate; but being only found guilty of an as∣sault, for which he was fined 100 <ABBR>l</ABBR> he was kept in confinement for 12 months; yet in that time he found means to get a woman or two with child, who were put in prison for debt. At length procuring his liberty, he fell into his old courses on the highway, in conjunction with one Nodes, an upholsterer's son by Fleet-ditch; but they had not continued the trade long before they were both taken at Holloway, and being committed to Newgate, were afterwards hanged at Tyburn in the year 1716.

<HEAD>The History of John Mulhoni, a highwayman.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN MULHONI was born in Connaught; but our author (not being willing to expose his family, which on his mother's side was of some repute) has concealed both his parents and the place of his birth. However he informs us, that being desirous of an employment, his friends ob∣tained for him the queen's letter, and put him aboard of her majesty's ships of war, in which he served several years in the Meditetrranean, both about Messina in Sicily, and several other ports; having quit this vessel, he went aboard a privateer, in which he had very great success in taking pirates, whereby he go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a large quantity of money. Afterwards he had the good fortune to be advanced to a considerable post in another of her majesty's ships of war, which was sent into the Balt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c, to observe some motions in the North; but upon return of the fleet he was discharged with several others. Being out of employment in London he soon found out ways of exonera∣ting his pockets of the pay he had received for his service, and returned into Ireland to visit his friends, in a very mean condition, which gave them a suspicion of his ill management, and caused them to take but little notice of him. Disgusted at such treatment, he sought new company, and soon became acquainted with one Cahoon, a game∣ster, and perhaps not much richer than himself, who furnished him with materials for the high∣way;
<PB N="70" REF="035355_0069_10049D82EEA72168"/>where, in conjunction with James Carrick, they committed a number of robberies; one in particular was on Mr. Dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of above 300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> who had that same night broken the bank, at the Pharoh-table, and another on Richard Nutley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in which last Cahoon was taken and after∣wards executed. Upon this Mulhoni and Car∣rick, carrying with them about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> went over to London, where they set up for gentlemen, and frequented the play-houses and drawing rooms, like pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of distinction, 'till at length Mulhoni got acquainted with a rich merchant's wise on the Strand, who out of stark love &amp; kindness sup∣plied him from time to time with money to sup∣port him in his extravagancies for about a year, 'till she died. During the time of his familiari∣ty with this gentlewoman, he picked up acquain∣tance with Smith, Butler, and Campbell, whom he afterwards assisted in committing many robberis on Finchly Common and other places, 'till Smith and Campbell quarrelling about dividing the prey, Campbell was killed in the fray, which dissolved the knot.</P>
<P>Then Mulhoni and Carick picked up Daniel Carrol as a man fit and proper for making a third person, being of a daring spirit, and fit to under∣take any enterprize; and with his assistance they robbed Mathew Joncour, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> on Epping forrest, from whom they took twenty guineas, two dia∣mond rings and his and his lady's watches.</P>
<P>Soon after this they met with the Cambridge and Huntingdon stage-coaches, which they sound pretty well filled with persons of distinction, from whom they took a considerable booty, and sup∣plied
<PB N="71" REF="035355_0070_10049D8513A66D10"/>themselves with money enough to support their extravagancies 'till September following in the year 1719, about which time, finding their stock pretty low, they took their posts on the high read again, where meeting with the Southampton, Salisbury, and Taunton Dean coaches, and not being able to accomplish their undertaking with∣out blows, during the engagement some of the company slipped aside and raised the country, who pursued our Irish gentlemen so close, for three miles end-ways, that they were within an ame's ace of being taken, making their escape with great difficulty. This put Carrick into so great a panick, that he resolved to forsake so dangerous a way of living. and advised his part∣ners to do the like: 'till Mulhoni upbraided him with cowardice, said. "Sink or swim, I'll go on with the game 'till I get money enough to make a figure in my own country," which occasioned Carrick to alter his intentions, and make a new league with his comrades; so swearing upon the holy evangelists to be ever true to one another, they proceeded, and took possession of the high∣way once more. But to be more private than before they took a lodging at Wapping, where they had not continued song before they pretend∣ed to have business in Scotland, and were several times making a sham agreement with Adrian Van Stoken to carry them thither in his vessel: But while this was in agitation, they took notice that a Norway master lodged a bag of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in their landlord's hands, who was a slopseller, and having observed where he laid it, they set their heads together to contrive how to bring it off
<PB N="72" REF="035355_0071_10049D86D61F7B90"/>with the least danger; and pursuant to their a∣greement, they secured the bag, which they con∣veyed privately away by night, and took new lodgings in Tothill-street, Westminster.</P>
<P>But Jonathan Wild, who was likely to be a great sufferer by this action, offered a reward of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to take them for the fact; upon which, not thinking themselves safe here, they removed to Oxford, where Carrick happened to see Dr. Hos∣ken in a coffee house whom they had formerly robbed. Whether the Doctor knew him or no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a query, tho' he asked him several questions as "What countryman he was, how long he had been in England; and where he was going?" and the like: but Carrick hearing him say he was going to the vice chancellor's began to suspect that he was discovered, and made the best of his way (as soon as he got an opportunity) to his companions, to whom he related the story; upon which they all agreed to remove their quarters with speed to Conventry, where he held a consultation to know, whether they had best go home to Ireland or return to London and pursue their old courses. Carrol seemed positively bent to forsake his old courses and go back to Ireland among his friends; but Mulhoni and Carrick over-ruled him, and persuaded him to return with them to Lon∣don again, where they arrived in a little time: But the daily instances of the seizures of high∣way men, and constantly hanging them, toge∣ther with the small favour Irishmen were shewn by English juries. insomuch that it became a pro∣verb, "an Irishman's name is enough to hang him." I say all these considered together discou∣raged
<PB N="73" REF="035355_0072_10049D8B8696B0F8"/>our heroes so much, that they no longer adventured to survey the high roads on horeback, but bethought themselves of a new method of making attempts, which was attacking passengers on foot by night in the public streets; and more effectually to succeed in these new enterprizes, they made it their business to pick acquaintance with the servants of persons of quality that at∣tended the Whitehall, St. James's, the Smyrna, offender and other chocolate houses, in order to learn of them where their masters generally spent the evening and to what place they retired after∣wards; and having received information they commonly took care to way-lay them, and made the best hand they could of their captures. By and such like stratagems, they seldom passed a week whenever they were in want, without ma∣king sure of some considerable Prize.</P>
<P>It was customary with them when they met a chair conveniently with any one in it, for two of them to stop the men that carried it, while the third robbed the gentleman; but when they made an attack on a coach with but one servant be∣hind, one was ordered to each side, and to have an eye on the footman, whise the third stopped the driver till the seat was performed. After this manner they robbed a Scotch gentleman, whom they had observed to receive a sum of mo∣ney in gold, from a banker near Hungerford mar∣ket; and after that a lady in a chair within three or four doors of her own house in Park place as she was returning from paying the countess of Walsingham a visit in St. James's palace, from
<PB N="74" REF="035355_0073_10049D8E8F9B3570"/>whom they took a purse of ten guineas, a gold watch, and a diamond ring: Likewise in the same month four gentleman in a coach, from whom they took two silver watches, and swords, and a∣bout 3 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in money; fourthly on the third of March following, they robbed a gentleman and three ladies in another coach, from whom they took about 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in value. The next they took into the secret, as they called it, was an old cour∣tier, who had been visiting a young lady in Great Albemarlestreet, from whom they took a diamond ring and a gold watch, but no money, the young lady having prevailed on him, to leave that with her.</P>
<P>The sixth adventure was at Marybone in Au∣gust, 1721, where observing that a baronet with one servant attending him had received a large purse of gold, they dogged him on his way home to a field, near the bordered house, and took above 200 guineas from him, with some silver, a dia∣mond ring and a watch, then giving the silver to his man, they padded the hoof and made their e∣cape: However the gentleman advertised the robbery, offering a larger reward for the watch (in the news papers.) than it could be sold for; upon which they sent it privately to the place appointed for receiving it, and got the reward, without being asked any questions.</P>
<P>The next robbery they committed was in De∣cember following (and as they fully proposed should be their last) when having moved their quarters nearer to Convent-Garden, in order to be less remote from the gambling tables, in and about the little Piazza, Bow-street, Charles-street, and
<PB N="75" REF="035355_0074_10049D906DE54868"/>Bridges-street, they took notice of a Frenchman of quality, who lodged at a house on the paved stones in St. Martin's lane, that had stripped most of the adventurers at hazard; upon this they fol∣lowed him, about one in the morning, until he came to the corner of Bedfordbury, where stopping the chair, they made the men turn two or three yards down a bye alley, and then robbed him of 230 pieces of gold, his watch, ring, gold headed cane, and sword, which hearing the noise of mens feet behind, they took to their way through Rose∣street, to Mulhoni's lodging in Hart-street.</P>
<P>Though they were now put into a condition of living creditable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et we may observe, that by playing cards, dice, &amp;c. and keeping company with lewd women, they were reduced, in a little time, to their primitive condition, poverty: and sitting one day accidentally at the Rose-tavern, in Bridges-street, they began to consult how they should retrieve their fortunes once more. The first attempt they made afterwards was but in vain, having dogged two gentlemen in their chairs, from thence into Tavistock-street, to no purpose: but agreeing to meet again at the Rose the night following, they staid there until it grew pretty late, and then went out in quest of prey. As they were passing down little Queen-street, they espied—Young <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in his chair, which they caused to be stopped in manner aforesaid, until they robbed him of 42 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in money, a gold watch, a crystal snuff-box, and a silver bilted sword. But the watch hearing some n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise at a distance, came up with speed, and being informed of the matter, pursued the robbers several ways, an
<PB N="76" REF="035355_0075_10049D93EFE0B6C0"/>Mulhoni had the misfortune to be stopped by a watchman in the passage near the duke of New-castle's house in Lincoln's-inn-sields as he was running away; but proving too strong for the watchman, he broke loose anc got from him, just as another watchman was coming up with his dog, which being set at Mulhoni, he seized him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the first quartier of the field, and held him fast 'lill his master and the other came up, who secur∣ed him in the watch-house all night: The next day being committed to Newgate, after several examinations, he confessed the robbery, &amp; many others, impeaching both Carrick and Carrol, his confederates and countrymen; but that not ex∣cusing him, he was prosecuted for the last rob∣bery, and hanged on the 18th of July, 1722, seeming very penitent according to the principles of his religion, dying a Roman Catholic.</P>

<HEAD>The History of Charles Dempsey, alias Cahier na Cappul, the renowned horse-stealer.</HEAD>
<P>THE father of this Cahier was a man of as great note among the rapparees, in the reign of King James, as any that ever escaped the gallows; tho' after the kingdom was restored to its former privileges by king William's forces, he left off that practice pretty much, and lived like the rest of his countrymen. He had several sons there whereof afterwards became very notorious, viz. Daniel, Charles and Luke. Daniel was put to
<PB N="77" REF="035355_0076_10049D967A0F4030"/>school in his youth, 'till he obtained the reputa∣tion of a good scholar; but not being fond of going abroad to finish his studies, chose to stay at home and lead the life of his brother, rather than be put into orders, (for he was intended for a priest.) When he arrived to mans's estate, he was too easily drawn into be a clerk and register to his his brother Cahier, who could neither read nor write; and at length, by following his pattern, was brought to the gallows, and executed along with him in August 1735. Their brother Luke would have had the same fate, only that he fled the country, tho' he never arrived to half the dexterity of Charles in the art of horse hiding. They all understood the canting language pretty well, yet made no use of it but upon proper oc∣casions which made several of their neighbours think there was more laid to their charge than they deserved, 'till time made the truth manifest. But as our design here is only to give the histo∣ry of Charles Dempsey, let us omit circumlocu∣tions and proceed.</P>
<P>This Charles Dempsey, alias Cahier na Cappul was born on the lands of Glenmalier, near Bal∣librittas, in the Queen's County, and in his child∣hood was kept mostly at his foster-father's, where he learned to speak Irish, but little or no En∣glish. From his infancy, it was observed that he was much addicted to lying and defrauding his companiona, little children, out of their play∣things, and was so extraordinary fond of horses and riding, that before he arrived to the age of five years, be could ride and stick on a wild horse
<PB N="78" REF="035355_0077_10049D98149ACBA8"/>better thau a great many men; a thing seldom known. 'Tis an old proverb, and commonly ta∣ken for granted, "that he that is born to be bang∣ed will never be drowned." Nor has it been more apparently verified in the life of any person than in his, for at the age aforesaid, being prompted by his natural inclinations to ride one three years old colt, he persuaded a man, to put him on his back, tho' he had nothing but a collar on his head; but not being any way capable of managing the young beast, he ran headlong' with him into the Barrow, and swam it, tho' there was a very high flood, and the stream rapid: He held his grip by the mane very well till he got to the further side, but striving to land at a bad place, the bank broke under the beast's breast, and sunk with it under water for a moment, and poor Charles was washed off with the current, which carried them both down the river near 50 yards, till the colt found footing, and plunged out; yet he held a fast grip of the collar till he got on dry ground, tho' he was shortly after taken up for dead, and with some difficulty recovered. After this he used frequently to say, in Irish, he would not fear drowning if he were to sail in a turf kish, nei∣ther was he afterwards any thing afraid of the Barrow water, for he made several dangerous adventures across to escape the hands of his pur∣suers.</P>
<P>As he grew more cautious of pilfering publick∣ly than when he was young (not that he thought it any sin, but in dread of the law) he managed his affairs so cunningly as to lay the facts always on others, because he had an inveterate hatred to
<PB N="79" REF="035355_0078_10049D99AA03DFE8"/>the gallows and the court-house after Sir Toby's death.</P>
<P>From a child he had an ill-favoured aspect, and in his countenance betrayed a deceitful heart, that is, he always carried a rogue's face, tho' his brother Daniel was a handsome portly man, and of seemly behaviour. His English was but broken at best, and sometimes he pretended to none at all, as will appear by the sequel: And as the saying is, Save a thief from the gallows and he'll cut your throut, so it was with him; for his ingratitude was so great, and he had so tit∣tle fidelity, that he made no scruple of accusing his nearest relations, or even his landlord, nay persons no ways guilty or concerned, to save him∣self.</P>
<P>At the age of twelve years he began to prac∣tise the art of decoying and catching horses, in which he acquired so much skill, that he made no difficulty of laying hands on the wildest colt, and horses that had been handled, seemed to fall into his clutches of their own accord. Perhaps some reader would expect that I should give a particular account of his management in this af∣fair, but as our intent in publishing this history, is only to put honest people on their guard against robbers and rogues, it can be no way necessary, neither it expedient to teach a thief how to catch a horse, or to steal: If I can shew an honest man how to outwit a rogue, or put a trick on him, 'tis as much as can be expected; and verily that was my chief design in publishing this book.</P>
<P>But it fame be true, it will be entirely need∣less to mentionany particulars: the country peo∣ple
<PB N="80" REF="035355_0079_10049D9B6B306968"/>will have and family do believe it was by a kind of witcharast, or charm, that he decoyed and entrapped horses, and taught others to do so; and the affirm that he received this charm from a witch in the county of Monaghan, (with whom he was very intimate) for some singular services he had done her. However, the following relation will make it seem probable that his father before him had the like charm; for which reason, I'm more than half inclined to dissent from the vul∣gar opinion, and conclude, that this magic was in∣herent in the family, and runs in the blood.</P>
<P>The story was related by a gentleman thus:</P>
<P>"In the beginning of queen Ann's reign, I went to see a friend of mine near Abbeleix, and having arrived at the place, I walked about the fields in the evening alone, and when I came near to the bog, I found I had occasion to ease na∣ture; I chose a convenient place under a hedge for that purpose, but before I had finished the discharge of my office, there appeared thro' the hedge a man before me, driving some horses ve∣ry quietly into a corner, one whereof he took hold of him by the near foreleg, and held him fast 'till he threw a shert rope about his neck, then he vaulted on him with more agility than ever I saw a miller do on his sacks: In this posture with a long stick in his hand, he drove the colt (he was never handled before) across the bog, till he got out of my sight, plunging and leaping to such a degree all the way, that one would have thought if the old boy were on his back he had but a dull chance from coming off without a broken neck; and by the noise they made, I conjectured they
<PB N="81" REF="035355_0080_10049D9FF3D0D0F8"/>might have gone a mile at the same rate before I left the place. I had no notion of rapparees being out at this time, and thought it might be some one that owned the colt that had made so free with him, till returning to my friends, I told the story and then they all suspected, as it really was, from the manner of catching the colt, that old Dempsy (tho he had been quiet a long time) had come to pay them a visit." Thus the gentleman ended his story, and now to preceed to Charles.</P>
<P>His foster father was a tenant under Major P—t, who once as he was riding out to take a review of his land, took notice of young Charles's activity in riding horses; upon which he had him sent home, to him, in order to be an attendant on his groom, and to learn him to speak English; where he behaved tolerable well and modest for a month or two and then he began his waggish tricks. "The groom and another servant happen∣ing to have some difference between themselves, Charles was resolved to wind it up to the highest, and bring a battle about if possible: they had of∣ten been jarring and sparing; and as the groom lay in a room under a hay loft, thro' which there was a private hole wide enough for a man to pass through, the young rogue took an oppor∣tunity, in the groom's absence, to drop a large sur-reverence at the foot of his bed, not forgetting to besprinkle it a little. When the groom was going to make his bed, what should he lay his hand first upon but the t—, which all bedaubed him, and threw him into such a fit of anger, that he vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved to be revenged of his fellow servant in
<PB N="82" REF="035355_0081_10049DA18AED0AF8"/>the morning, whom he suspected and nobody else. He went not to bed that night, but sat up, and as soon as the master came out the next day, made his complaint to him. His master could hardly forbear smiling at the joke, tho' it was a dirty one; yet he shewed a very great resent∣ment to the other servant who was accused, tho' the fellow who was innocent, utterly denied that he knew any thing of the matter. All this gave the groom no satisfaction, but to logger∣heads he would and did go with the other, who proving too hard for him, the groom was worsted and obliged to give out; then the other, and all that took his part reported that the groom had S—t his own bed and that he laid it on ano∣ther with no other view than to excuse himself; which getting wind, he was so jeered about it, that he had no quietness, till he quitted his ser∣vice and went away.</P>
<P>There were several young gentlewomen in the house, who were very glad of the groom's depar∣ture, because he was very ready in making com∣plaints against themselves to the old gentleman; from thence Charles took occasion to let the young ladies into the secret, who approving of his management, employed him in several little affairs and about messages not proper to mention here. But it happened once in the fruit reason, that the young gentlewomen had a great desire for some choice fruit out of the orchard, into which they were refused admittance by the ma∣jor; upon this they employed Charles to rob the orchard, who getting up very early by break of day, the next morning and without staying to
<PB N="83" REF="035355_0082_10049DA37B530300"/>put on his breeches, crept thro' a hole in the roof of the privy-house, adjoining the orchard, and went to pillaging the trees, where he filled a large chequer apron, with the choicest fruit, and was making ready to return. There was a cler∣gyman that lodged in the house, who had got a touch of the country disease and was somewhat very much out of order, and having occasion to give speedy vent, had repared to the coffee house for that purpose while the boy was on his expe∣dition. As the gentleman sat on his seat, and was stooping forward, the boy came to the hole, where, without looking before him as he was de∣scending, the apron untied, and all the fruit came tumbling down about his ears; and at the same moment Charles fell with his legs on each side of the clergyman's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>k, and by the weight of the fall, threw him on his face, in this posture they lay wedged together in a nook, for near the space of a minute, before Charles could disengage him∣self; and the clergyman's surprise being height∣ened more and more upon feeling nothing but naked skin about him he fainted quite away; and lay-still on the ground; the boy thinking he had killed the gentleman, ran away with all speed, and came back no more to his service: But the cler∣gyman who could not see him, and was as much terrified as the boy, (without suspecting him in the least) went in and told the story: some pitied him, others could hardly forbear smiling; but nobody could find out the truth, but the boy be∣ing missing two or three days, and the young gentlewomen knowing the apron that was left be∣hind, called to mind the exploit they sent him a∣bout,
<PB N="84" REF="035355_0083_10049DA51374E948"/>and so conjectured that it could be none else but young Dempsey, who had affrighted the poor clergyman into a sit.</P>
<P>In days of his youth there was a miller, at the wind mill near Ballybritas, a fellow very fit for his purpose with whom he had picked an ac∣quaintance. Charles had often been tampering with him to come into his measures; but the fel∣low had imbibed such strange notions of a Judge, that he thought he must be something more than mortal, to decide and give judgment on criminal causes; Nay, he imagined the Judge knew the truth of every complaint that was brought be∣fore him, before he heard it; for which reason, he was afraid of entering into any affair that might bring him before one, 'till he was fully informed what kind of a thing a Judge is. Charles to remove these scruples, prevailed on the fellow, who was very desirous of knowing, to go along with him to Mary borough assizes, where they heard some causes tried; which satisfied the mil∣ler's curiosity so far, that he told Cahier, as they were returning home, that a Judge was like one of themselves, and nothing else but a man, and that he would be nothing afraid of entering in the lists with Charles as soon as he pleased; ac∣cordingly the fellow was enlisted and put into employment by his master.</P>
<P>By this time Charles had picked up acquain∣tance in most parts of the kingdom for putting his designs into execution. He fixed five or six of his own relations in Upper Ormond and Osso∣ry, and as many in the counties of Leitrim, monag∣han, and Derry, besides a vast number of receivers
<PB N="85" REF="035355_0084_10049DAA213AC278"/>and assistants in almost every hole and corner in the country; so that nothing went amiss with him. He had likewise never less than four ap∣prentices at a time, who were always bound for the term of seven years and paid a pretty round sum of money for learning his art and mystery, in which he had such great skill, that boys were sent to him all the way from the county of Kerry, to be bound. Perhaps he was the first Irish rogue that ever thought of such a stratagem; for had he taken a thousand pounds for teaching a boy to catch or disfigure a horse or cow only, I question whether he could be hanged by our laws for it; and by the sequel, we may observe that he always acted in such a manner as to be capa∣ble of evading the force of the law, if possible, though he was as great a rogue as has been hanged.</P>
<P>He had besides his Satyrs, receivers and ap∣prentices, a number of spies and setters, whose bu∣siness only was to make observations, and give no∣tice what cattle (and where they) might be most safely conveyed away; and these had no commu∣nication with the Satyrs or drivers themselves. Whenever such notice was given to Charles, an express was immediately dispatched to some one or more of the Satyrs, with a description of such beast or beasts, which, without any more words, was sufficient to be understood. By such means as this the downright thievery could never be pro∣ved on Charles, tho' every body knew that he was receiver general, and that his servants were all paid by the piece, so much a beast for officiating;
<PB N="86" REF="035355_0085_10049DABB7F9B640"/>but how Daniel kept his accounts is a secret.</P>
<P>He had private places for hiding stolen cattle of all kinds in; and at any time when he thought proper, would order such horses as came from Leinster side or Munster, down to his correspon∣dents in the North, who either would send them from Derry, Newry, on Donaghadee to Scotland, or otherwise swap them off in fairs or sell them. Such horses, as his correspondents got in exchange, they made no scruple of selling publickly because they could prove the getting of them; but those that were stolen in the North were commonly sent to different hands, and were disposed of in Upper Ormond, Ossory, or in Munster. To sa∣tisfy the reader's curiosity, I shall rehearse one story, being part of the confession of one of the confederates while he lay in confinement, before he was executed in Kilkenny, which will give a more particular account of his management than the foregoing.</P>
<P>He confessed to the people who came to see him, that one of Charles's setters come to him by night where he lived, and told him there were three horses in a park near Clonegal; one was black, with a star and one white foot, another a bay gelding, that padded, and the third, a white pad, with his mane and tail cut close. He said he understood the messenger's meaning very well and accordingly conveyed the three horses down to Glenmalier in two nights after. After that he was pitched upon as the most proper person for disposing of them, and pursuant to his orders took them down to the country of Monagham but as the white horse was so very remarkable
<PB N="87" REF="035355_0086_10049E9F1B77C4D0"/>they stained him all over with a flesh coloured red, in order to disguise him, which was done with Brazilet and allum boiled in water; but that co∣lour was soon washed off. This fellow was not so much as known in that country; so by the assistance of some of his Brother receivers, he put off the three horse in a fair, being all sightly cattle to good advantage, for two of them he got twenty pounds, and for the third a mare, that was afterwards sold in the county of Waterford for six pounds. Some after the owner of the bay-horse was directed to Charles, in expectation of getting some tidings of his breast: but Cahier would not undertake the inquiry, till he was paid two guineas in hand; upon which he pro∣mised to search for the horse. In about twelve days after the horse was taken out of a stone park in the night, where the last purchaser kept him and so conveyed down to Charles, who gave the right owner notice that they might find such a horse in the wood near the river Barrow; upon which the owner sent his servant for him, and had him brought home without any compliments. Some time after, the owner was riding to the North to buy linen, and having his horse with him, he was challenged and secured till the assizes; but the owner bringing sufficient evidence that he bred him, and that he had been missing all the while the other had him, got the better of the dispute, and took his horse home again. On the other hand, the purchaser could only prove, that he bought him in a fair, but could not tell from whom; so by that means the thief was sel∣dom sound.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="035355_0087_10049EA0B4C08058"/>
By what has been related one may perceive how cunningly his affairs were carried on; and in the next place, I shall relate some of his own actions.</P>
<P>There was an elderly gentleman in the King's County who had a particular humour of his own in several respects, and when he took a fancy to any thing was commonly so choice of it, that he would suffer no one else to use it. He had a dun horse of great spirit, and a good hunter; which he was so choice of, that he would not suffer his son to ride him. The son knew the goodness of the horse as well as the father, and had cast a covetous eye upon him, but could not tell how to compass his desire till he had advised with Cahier, who gave him proper directions. In consideration of a handsome fee, Charles, pro∣vided him with the skin of a horse of the same colour, and with the like marks of his father's horse, which was then at grass. This skin was dipt in a bog-hole and presented to the father by one of his tenants, as the skin of his gelding, which, they said, was drowned in a bog-hole.— The old man, who had not all the wit in the world, nor any mistrust of the fraud believed his tenant's report, and took it for a matter of fact. However some time after the son, who had kept the horse concealed, rode on him home, pretended he had bought him in a fair; as soon as his father saw him he cried out, "D—, I vow to G—d, only my horse was drownded, I would take my oath that's he for he's as like as ever I saw any thing in my life," which expression passed to a sterling joke among the gentlemen of the county
<PB N="89" REF="035355_0088_10049EA25236DB68"/>for a long time afterwards.</P>
<P>Cahier had occasion once to pay his correspon¦dents in the county of Kilkenny a visit and to examine how the affairs and accounts stood be∣tween them; where, as he was on his march in the evening, he went into a poor widow's house, and demanded a drink of milk, upon which she brought him a large drink of butter-milk but disliking it very much, he abused her to all in∣tents and purposes, and bid her go for some of the new milk, which she refused, and would not own to have any other than what she brought; then he called her a bitch and a whore, and cur∣sed her over and over, withal saying she should pay for that ill usage: And indeed so she did, for before next morning her two cows being all she had, were stolen from her, neither could she ger any tidings of them after.</P>
<P>Much about this time he was in his prime, and kept a place much like an office of intelligence, where his brother Daniel was register, who kept an account not only of their correspondents and place of abode, but likewise how and for what e∣very beast was disposed of: By this means they were able to answer such people as came in pur∣suit of cattle: if they were to be had at all, he generally de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anded a fee in hand, for putting the owner in the way of getting his beast, which fee was always proportioned according to the beast's value, or the difficulty that might attend the recovery of it; and if in happened that the beast could not be procured with any safety, he was to return such a part of his fee as was agreed
<PB N="90" REF="035355_0089_10049EA3F9206B90"/>to before hand, which he seldom refused. Now we must observe, that Cahier never delivered to the owner any beast that had been stolen; all he did, was to direct him to go where he might find such a one; and this stratagem was to prevent home proof being given against him. Neverthe∣less, he had the misfortune to be bit even in this respect, and catched in such a trap, that it cost him a summer's work to get lose. This was in the year 1729, when the practice was so com∣mon of killing sheep in the night time, and ta∣king away their skins, carcases, and fat, which they disposed of in distant places. This practice was carried on mostly by discarded shepherds (tho' not without Cahier's knowledge) who kept dogs trained sit for the purpose, with other mate∣rials.</P>
<P>A gentleman in the country of Kilkenny ha∣ving some cows stolen from him, employed a trusty servant to make enquiry from Cahier, who having received his fee, in a short time gave pro∣per directions, as he thought, where to find them. The gentleman managed so crattily, that he took up one of the men in whose custody the cattle were sound, and this person having accused Cahier, Ca∣hier was taken and put into Naas goal, where on purpose to save his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, he turned evidence for the king, and impeached six or seven people in that country. Cahier told the Judges that he could do the country a vast deal of service, that he could inform against rogues in every county in the province, and was willing to do it, to bring them to justice. The judges were pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty well informed of his capacity of doing so; but not in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g∣gining
<PB N="91" REF="035355_0090_10049EAB4E9BAB78"/>that he was a foresworn rogue, they took him thro' the circuit to Philipstown, Marybo∣rough, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, and Wick∣low, expecting to benefit the country, by rid∣ding it of rogues upon this evidence; but Charles took care not to inform against any one who was staunch to his interest, impeaching none but such as he thought might betray him, if tak∣en up, or such as he owed a grudge to, tho' they were innocent, and no way concerned with him. 'Tis true, he was discharged, and slipped his own neck out of the halter by this means, but the country was little the better; for tho' he caused four or five to be hanged, 'tis thought that some of them were not guilty.</P>
<P>Charles has not been long out of confinement before he took a small concern under a gentle∣man near Lea, on which he opened his office again; and as he had accused none of his staunch comrades, they had no fault to his charge, but joined him very readily, and carried on their trade as before in conjunction.</P>
<P>However, one of his boys had given him oc∣casion to be angry on a certain time, for which he banged and abused him; the boy being sto∣mached at this usage, threatened to make some discovery to his master's prejudice, which to pre∣vent, Charles decoyed him into a wood (know∣ing that he could neither read not write) and with assistance, bound him fast, and cut out his tongue; however through mistake, not so close, out when he was cured, he made a shift to speak, though very imperf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tly.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="035355_0091_10049EACE5A2BC30"/>
At another time, one of his accomplices bro't to him by night, a very simple follow (in appear∣ance) from upper Ormond, who came only to get intelligence of two horses that hadl been sto∣len from him, and had laid down a gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea for in∣formation money. Charles was then near the wind-mill, at a very bye-place; yet tho' the fellow was brought to him by night, and thro' the most crooked paths, he beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to suspect that the man had something more in his head than lice, and was resolved to put him into the high roads as privately as he came, lest he should come as a spy against him another time. After he had reprimanded his accomplices for intruding such a fellow on him without previous notice, the two horses were sent for, and ready to be delivered against day-break; then Cahier after he had pli∣ed the man with liquor all night, sent for a large sack, and having bound the fellow hand and foot, and gagged him to prevent him f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m making a noise, he was tumbled into it, and then the va∣cancy was well stuffed with hay (only a hole was made for him to breathe thro') to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ake it seem like a sack of corn.</P>
<P>When matters were thus prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, Charles mounted on one of the horses, and had the sack thrown up before him, which he carried thro' as private paths as he could for about two miles, 'till he got into the high road, and it began to grow pretty light; then pitching upon a proper spot of ground where there was good gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, he took the sack off the horse, the gag out of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow's mouth, tethered both horses, and made off himself. The fellow had no other way left
<PB N="93" REF="035355_0092_10049EAF8E1EAB78"/>to relieve himself, than by calling out to pas∣sengers, which he did very powerfully, but found no relief till about nine o'clock. When he was released, he catched his horses, and made the best of his way home, for fear of meeting with a se∣cond disaster.</P>
<P>Charles was shortly after indicted for several facts, and committed to Mary borough jail, with his comrade Jack; but the Landlord, who per∣haps was afraid of losing some arrears, if he lost his tenant, made such interest, and obtained so fair a character of him, that he was acquitted for that time, and his brother also, though it was very well known that they were pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to the stealing of almost every horse that had been sto∣len in that county.</P>
<P>But some little time after, the said landlord to make sure of his rent, seized on Cahier's ef∣fects, and turned him off his land. This put him to his wit's end to meditate revenge, which he thought he could bring about no better way than by accusing him, and bringing him in as a party concerned along with him.</P>
<P>His former landlord had converted a large vault, that lay under an old castle, into a stable, which was large enough to hold several horses; in this stable, and in a wood near to it (which some people say Charles did only through design) Cahier, when he had occasion, had leave to put some of his horses, and this was foundation e∣nough for him to ground an accusation upon: Nay, he made preparations for giving in exami∣nations, and the whole country believed that the
<PB N="94" REF="035355_0093_10049EB33AD09460"/>said gentleman was one of the managers in the confederacy.</P>
<P>Mr. G—, the said gentleman, who was upon setting up for a justice, being irritated a∣gainst Charles, had examinations given against him, and after a very difficult pursuit, Cahier was taken and committed to Naas goal, in No∣vember, 1734<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where he remained till the March assizes following, from whence he was transmit∣ted to Mary borough, in order to be tried. While he was pursued, he swam several times across the Barrow, tho' the flood was great, and his said landlord's men followed him with as much reso∣lution, till they took him, in a haggard, where he had concealed himself.</P>
<P>Things being now brought to this situation, he swore several examinations in Irish, while he was in confinement, against the gentleman and others, to put off his own trial, and told his sto∣ries so plausible, that several gentleman in the country took his part, and the gentleman was tried; and were it not for some of the leading men in the country, it is to be feared he might have suffered. It was with some difficulty that his trial was put off till August affixes, tho' Ca∣hier was the only evidence against him. But some others whom Charles accused, were tied up by the neck, particularly one Hickey, who owned that he had often transgressed, but denied the facts whereof he was then accused, at the gallows.</P>
<P>We must now pass on to Cahier's trial, at Maryborough, in August, 1735. He was first brought to the bar, and then ordered to hold up
<PB N="95" REF="035355_0094_10049EB5E1D70660"/>his hand, which he did pretty quietly, time after time, 'till above thirty indictments were read against him: Then the judge said, 'guilty or not guilty?' but Cahier seemed not to under∣stand one word of English, till one behind him bid him in Irish to answer: then he turned a∣bout, and asked the other in the same language, what he should say? Why says he, neel me dheer (i. e. not guilty.) The judge then told him, he would make him sind good English short∣ly; and proceeded on, asking him how he would be tried? but still no English from Charles, who only asked one that stood by in Irish, what the judge said? But the judge was resolved not to be tristed with; so after much ado, he was taught to say, "By cod and my guntry.</P>
<P>At length the first evidence was produced, and then a second and a third, &amp;c. but still nothing but Irish from Dempsy, till a fellow from the North came up, who swore very home against him about a cow: Then all at once, he cried in a passion, "That's murder, my lord, he does not know m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at all; he's a lying rogue, for I had that cow wid my shelf ever; she was born'd upon my own ground, my broder here knows it" Ah! (says the judge) you and your bro∣der.—</P>
<P>His trial lasted above twelve hours; for tho' there were so many evidences against him, and even the man that had lost his tongue, yet not above two, without other circumstances, would have hanged him. He spoke broken English all along after, and pleaded very artfully, particu∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly against the said gentleman, who was one of
<PB N="96" REF="035355_0095_10049EB7764A8388"/>the chief evidences against him. He always con∣tradicted him, and still would say to the judge, "That the evidence was the greatest rogue of the two." But all did not save him; he receiv∣ed sentence of death, and was executed in Au∣gust, 1735.</P>
<P>As he passed from the gaol to the gallows, he minded nothing but discoursing with the people, who came to inquire of him about cattle that had been stolen from them. To some he gave satisfactory answers, and directed them where to seek; to others, he made none. On the ladder he continued the like discourse, till he was turn∣ed off, and even then, he was so loth to die, that he caught hold of it as it turned, and held fast, till the sheriff obliged him to quit his grip, by pounding his knuckles with the but end of his whip. Thus he went out of the world, without clearing any one that he had accused, and died according to the belief of every body, an hard∣ened villain.</P>
<P>His brother Daniel, who was found guilty of the like facts, and executed along with him, be∣haved in a quite different manner; he continued reading, on his way to the place of execution, very devoutly, in a Manuel, and repeated a great number of prayers before the ladder was turned.</P>
<P>This same Charles, in imitation of Redmond O'Hanl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, used to indemnify people from hav∣ing their cattle stolen, for a yearly reward.</P>
<P>John, or Jack Dempsey, was also hanged some time before; but was not an own brother of Charles, tho' generally taken to be so.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>GOLD FINDER:</HI> Or, the notorious CHEATS of Manus. Mac O'Neil, AND His Man ANDREW.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many remarkable tricks related in the history of the Irish Rogues, there is none deserves more the attention of the reader, than the following, being managed by an ignorant country fellow, who, by the natu∣ral simplicity of his look, and an artful affecta∣tion of folly, passed upon the world as a stupid, innocent bumpkin, incapable of forming the least design or intrigte, which gave him the advan∣tage of carrying on his cheat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> successfully for a long time, without being in the least suspected. What province or country he was born in, I could never learn, tho' you may take it for granted, he was a downright Irishman; for he wore the brogue upon his tongue, as fashionable as any rogue in the nation.</P>
<P>At the age of sixteen years, or thereabouts, he was bound apprentice to a Mason, at Clone-bullock,
<PB N="98" REF="035355_0097_10049EBB4DC5DD18"/>in the King's county; but his master dying before he had time to learn the trade, Ma∣nus was put under some difficulties; however, he made a shift to pick up acquaintance with an expert tinker, who had skill in running down metal; and upon occasion, was not backward in coining a piece of silver and gold, to answer his necessities.</P>
<P>This same tinker had been tried for his life, for facts of this kind, both in Naas and Armagh, and found means to get off in both places. The Indictment upon which he was tried in Armagh, was for making and uttering a bad pistole; where seeming on his trial, to know nothing of the matter, he said that not above three pistoles had passed thro' his hands in his life, and that he could know every one again; at the same time he begged leave to see the piece he was charged with for uttering, and if he had passed it, he would not deny it; upon this, it was given into his hand to be examined. While he was view∣ing the piece, he pretended to bite it, but took an opportunity of drawing another out of his mouth instead of it, which he said was the same piece he had passed, and would prove it to be right good gold; accordingly it was tried, and found good, by which stratagem he got clear.</P>
<P>Manus having got a little insight into the bu∣siness, grew sick of Masonry and immediately fell upon new schemes. By some means or other, he procured as much gold as made a small ingot, which he used as a decoy. With this he moved towards Allen, where meeting with a simple ho∣nest English countryman, sit enough to serve his
<PB N="99" REF="035355_0098_10049EC35A91D588"/>turn, he took him into a private place, and gave him the following relation:—</P>
<P>"I was 'prentice, says he, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a Mason, and at Easter when my Master went abroad, he left meself and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noder 'prentice to maak a paar of pear, for a gaat at New-abbe), in the county of Kildere, just hard by the old buildings: both of us had a mind to maak as good a work while my master wou'd be from us, and better, nor af he'd sten wid us himself; and I went wid my∣shelf, and tin wid a crow in my hand, to get some good stones out of the old walls, that wou'd be fitting for us, tho' it was Easter Monday, and the people all at mass. I saw one plaas about so big as a door, stopped up wid the sort of stones I wanted, and so I fell to work, striving to get 'em out, and taak em along wid me to my comrade; but before I got de half of 'em out, I found there was steps up before me, going down like stairs, and I went in to see what sort of a plaas there was there, and where should the steps be after bringing myself to, but into a dark toom; I be∣lieve it is a want you call it, and what should I find there, but a parshil of shets, and I thought they were coffins full of bones: but when I struck my crow against one of 'em, I found it's iron they were made of; and upon that I went out and stopped the whole up again, for fear a∣ny body would find it, and go in before night. When it was dark, myshelf and my comrade a∣long wid me, wint it there wid a candle and dark lantern; and what should we find in the chests whin we broke 'em open wid de crow, but bars like dis (pulling out his ingot) piled up a top of
<PB N="100" REF="035355_0099_10049986382FF4F8"/>one anoder, a yaad high, and fait I believe it gold, dar a neigh, look at it.—There was ano∣der chest full of candlesticks of the saam sort of dis, and more of them full of crosses, chalices, and rings, and fine shining stones; my comrade has one of 'em, and a gentleman says it has a carbuncle. Do you know what sort dat is? But what would you have of it? We took em all out of dat, and buried em in anoder plaas, till we got time to look 'em all over, for fear of the lord of the manor; if he hears of it, he'll come and take it from us. You must not tell any bo∣dy, only if you have any friend who would give us a little monies, he should have a great bargain, for my shelf does not know the wort of such sort, and may be too af I'll take them to the gold∣smith in Dublin, he'll shallenge us wid 'em, and fair may be we'd get nothing for 'em, but go to gaal after. Af you have any friend that's a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> honest man, we would rather let him have a bar∣gin for your sake, than give it to a stranger; there's a crown among it too, which they say was belong to the King of Scotland.</P>
<P>The Farmer hearing the fellow talk so simply, verily imagined that he was a mere ignoramus, and thought all that he told him was as true as the hearth mouey; however he kept his council as far as proper, and desired Manus to have his treasure in readiness, and not to shew it to any body, for fear of losing it, till he got an oppor∣tunity of acquainting some of his friends, who, he was sure, had a good deal of money lying by, and would purchase the whole. Manus's sole in∣tention was to make himself seem as foolish as
<PB N="101" REF="035355_0100_10049EC4F1E072A8"/>possible, thereby to make his bait the more taking, yet he did not confine himself to hold the secret from all others; for he told the aforesaid story to as many as he thought he could make proper fools of, to further his designs, and behaved as much like a fool as possible, that no suspicion of deceit might hereby arise: for which reason I shall give him the title of the Irish fool, let others call him what they please. By this arti∣sice, the story was whispered about very private∣ly from hand to hand, among such people as were supposed to have money, who were mostly intent upon engrossing the treasure every one to himself, that for sear of being prevented they even would not give their wives an item of it.</P>
<P>At length, people that had money, came pri∣vately from all parts to seek Manus, in hopes of making their fortunes, but in fact it was only to lose them. The first that he made a perfect master of the secret, was an innkeeper of the county of Kilkenny, who had brought a pretty handful of money with him, and a portmanteau, in order to purchase a large quantity of gold; but Manus, as great a fool as he pretended to be, was resolved not to be caught in any trap, and absolutely refused to sell any of his ware under that denomination, for sear of bringing himself into trouble, and gave such reasons for so doing, that the purchaser seemed to have no mistrust of a bite. Says he, "I don't sell you my ingots of gold, that would be the way to be found out by the lord of the manor, who has the first preten∣sion to every sort of that kind that's found in
<PB N="102" REF="035355_0101_10049EC6C653D3C8"/>his ground any way; and to be sure he'd have the gold above any thing else. I tell you what I'll do wid you, give me such monies as will buy tin good cows to maintain myshelf, and I'll give you so much of the sort I found in the Old Ab∣bey as ever you can carry way wid you in the leather bag behind you; but you must give me your oat first that you won't open it till you get home, nor tell any body how much gold you have, nor how you got it, and dis is some of the sort I found (laying his ingot on a brick, and pointing to it with his finger.) Now, how much monies will you give me, and I'll sill your bag?" The bargain was agreed to, and the purchaser sworn to secrecy; then Manus led him in the night to a convenient field for his purpose, pretending a great deal of fear, lest any one should see or hear them; and having blindfolded him, he took the portmanteau a little further, where he filled it with bricks, stones, and hay, and when he had locked it, he returned with the load. The inkeeper was overjoyed at his bargain, and having paid Manus about forty pound, earnest money, he put the load up behind him, and rode home post haste, promising to pay the remainder on delivery of the key, which the goldfinder was to give him in two days after at his own house, where he was to meet him and take an account of his ware. But the inkeeper waited two days, three times told before Manus appeared with the key, and might have waited till doom's day only his impatience prompted him to be fingering the gold; upon which he tipped open the portmanteau, and finding how
<PB N="103" REF="035355_0102_10049EC8EC7FCCC8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nfoundedly he was outwitted, he sell sick of a Plenetick fever, which had like to have cost him his life. However he was so much ashamed of his bargain, that he could not tell how to di∣vulge the secret for some months after.</P>
<P>The rumour of finding such immense trea∣sure was spread about with such artifice, that hundreds were apprized of it yet every man that had money and heard it imagined himself first in the baby-house, and strove eagerly to make his market, before others knew any thing of the affair. I heard of a very responsible merchant's son in the county of —, that had just receiv∣ed a considerable fortune with his wife, who upon having notice thereof, made preparations for disposing of all his effects, in order to pur∣chase the whole treasure, (crown, jewels and all) and to carry them to France, about the time the late French King was married, expecting to make a million of money by the bargain, and to be able at his return to purchase the whole country before him; but the gay man his father being a man of better experience in the world, suspected some deceit, and (though with difficul∣ty) dissuaded his son from engaging in so hazar∣dous a project.</P>
<P>Manus had such good fortune by his schemes, that in a little time he was able to make a new ingot of real gold, which weighed about twelve ounces, in the shape of a small bar, and this he carried about for a decoy: Besides he was sup∣plied by one of his accomplices from Dublin-with brass bars of the same size and form, gilded or covered over so that any person not well skill¦ed
<PB N="104" REF="035355_0103_10049ECFB2986098"/>in metals might easily be deceived, and not know one from the other. He had likewise the luck to pick up an acquaintance with one An∣drew Farrel, an ill inclined young fellow, whose usual employment was to carry meat from the butchers in Dublin to gentlemen in the country. He presently found that this fellow would be ve∣ry fit for his purpose, inasmuch as that he was intimate with several people of good credit in Dublin, and so he let them into the secret. This Farrell told his story concerning the treasure with such a seeming probality, that numbers en∣tertained him, and treated him with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undance of courtsev, in order to get him to introduce them to Manus; however he always enjoined them to secrecy, still pretending the greatest friendship imaginable to those he told it to, by which means he drew great numbers in search of the gold. 'Tis really a wonder, that among so many as came from all parts in quest of this trea∣sure, that some of them did not blab out one to another, what their business was; but the mys∣tery lay here, those that were in pursuit, kept council of necessity, and such as were bit, were under these obligations, or so much ashamed of their bargains, that they could not tell how to discover or expose their weakness.</P>
<P>Their most usual way of imposing on custom∣ers, was this; after the buyers had been proper∣ly informed of the treasure, and manner of find∣ing it and so wrought up into a firm belief of the certainty thereof, without shewing any token of mistrust; then Manus began to expose the gold bar which he call'd brass, as a sample of his trea∣sure,
<PB N="105" REF="035355_0104_10049ED14EC64D88"/>always prompting his chapmen to try it, let them call it what they pleased. When they had fully satisfied themselves concerning the value of the metal, a bargain was commonly concluded upon; in the mean while Manus always took care, by one means other, to exchange the gold bar for another of brass of which sort be could fur∣nish his customers with as many as they thought proper; then as it was customary with him, he de∣manded either the money or sufficient earnest, which being laid down on the side of the table, and the ingits, as he called them on the other, "Now, says he, here is my ware, it is brass I call it, and will fold it to you for brass, and nothing else, but yourself knows the sort best. I hope you will have good luck wid it; as you don't like it, leave it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id myself; here is your monies, take your c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>. I'll be bound to get more; but as you keep my ingits, you must buy it for brass, and call it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss; and you shall give me your oat you will never say you bought gold, nor tell what you give for my ingits, for fear of the lord of the manor would come and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aak it all wid him∣shelf." He frequently appeared to be in liquor, and by these kind of speeches, which seemed to proceed from perfect ignorance, his customers only became ten times more earnest than before, making no scruple to give an oath of secrecy, which being done, they seldom made any delay till they got home with the treasure. But as par∣ticular instances may be more satisfactory, I shall relate two or three, to render him in more plain colours.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his prospetity, in company
<PB N="106" REF="035355_0105_10049ED2E165FCE0"/>with the said Farrel, he took a jaunt down to Dublin, with the ingot of real gold in his pocket and several gits of brass, as like it as could pos∣sibly be made. In the habit of a mean country farmer, he went to an eminent banker in Castle-street, and finding him alone, he drew out his in∣got, and began to make his condition and case known in the most moving and pathetic manner. Says he. "God bless your worship. Sir, every body knows you have the best skill in the sort of dis of any man in Dublin, (shewing his ingot in paper) because you deal so much in monies: I believe it is the fort they make the guineas of. Well, says the banker, what would you have me do with it? Why God bless your worship sir, my landlord is hard upon me for the rent, and he says he'll drive my cattle away from me, as I don't pay him ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Monday. My father and my father's father, and his father before him had this piece in the family, and there is no luck nor grace would ever stay in the same plaas wid me, if I'd sell its but for all dat (dropping some tears) I must borrow some monies upon it or my family will be undone: God bless you, sir, you know the worth of dis sort; strive to relieve me, and I'll pray for you ever" Upon this the banker took pity on him, yet not willing to pend entirely on his own judgement, he sent the ingot out to his goldsmith to be tried who sent him word back that it was good gold. The banker then would have been very willing to have purchased it at so moderate a price, but the other refused to sell; end cot only so, but was for borrowing more upon it, and at a longer time than the banker approved
<PB N="107" REF="035355_0106_10049ED487A94208"/>of; so Manus took the ingot, lhpped it up in the same paper, and went out, on pretence of seeking redress from some body else upon the same secur¦ity; but he had not gone many sleps from the door before he took an opportunity of putting a git of brass in the place of the ingot, and return∣ed with it so lapped up to the banker again. Says he, (giving a sigh, with a sorrowful countenance, wringing his hands and dropping a few tears) "I must sell dis or borrow some monies upon it, to slop my cattles, I believe you will give me so much as any body for it, and as I don't release it against Christmas day I won't asb it any more." The banker then told him out what he offered before and a guinea over, thinking him a simple ignorant fellow, and then laid his bargain up in a drawer without examining it, thinking that it was worth about fifteen pounds more at least. Some time after Christmas the banker had some compa∣ny at dinner with him, to whom he related after what manner he had bought a great bargain of gold from a sill countryman. They were all de∣sirous of seeing it, and when one of the gentle∣men viewed it, he said it was not gold, upon which the banker held him a bottle of wine to the con∣trary, and had it tried over again: but to his mortification was obliged to yield the wager lost, which put him entirely out of humour, tho' it pro∣ved very good diversion for the rest of the com∣pany, to see a banker outwitted by a fool, who never intended to pay him another visit.</P>
<P>When he and his man Andrew had pretty well seduced and defrauded a great number of the Dublinians out of there money, for ingots of brass
<PB N="108" REF="035355_0107_10049EDAC8330F60"/>instead of gold, they grew enraged against him and began to dog Andrew to his lodgings, and to the country, thinking to take him before a justice; but he observing it, gave them the slip, and posted away to his master, who had retired to the wood of Allen, where he usually spent the most of his time. As soon as Manus understood that people endeavoured to take him, says he dar a nagh agus dat a neagh, we will go to Connaught: And their effects being easily carried, and affairs settled, after drinking a belly full of brandy, their common liquor, they began their journey, not in the direct-road, but thro' the Queen's County, where Manus was obliged to make a longer stay than he expected occasioned by a misfortune that befel him. It happened that while he passed thro' this last county, a man of some figure purchased some of his ingots of brass for which he paid Manus a pretty round sum of money; in a few days after the gentleman ex∣posed his bargain to a goldsmith in Dublin, with a design of converting part of it into plate for his family, and to make money of the rest; but to his sorrow, being thoroughly made sensible of the fraud, he posted home, and upon search, had the good fortune of seizing Manus, whom he got com∣mitted to Maryborough goal, where he remain∣ed under confinement 'till the next assizes. At length his trial came on, and a vigorous prosecu∣tion was made against him, and to be sure the ju∣ry could have thought no better of him than he deserved, only that when he was asked what he had to say for himself, he asked his prosecutor se∣veral crooked questions, 'till he obliged him to ac∣knowledge,
<PB N="109" REF="035355_0108_10049EDF185C05E0"/>that Manus told him, at the time they made the bargain that his ware was brass, and no other. 'What would you have din? And is it not brass? Sure that's no sheat for a man to sell his guts by the right name. I will leave it to my lord judge, and the gentlemin of the the jury.' In short he filled the court with sur∣prime and laughter, to see how artfully he could evade the force of the law, tho in appearance he seemed like a fool: However the jury sat upon it, yet they could not bring him in guilty of what he was accused; upon which he was acquitted.</P>
<P>Now he thought every hour a day 'till he got into some remote place, and so hasted away with his man Andrew to Connaught, where having no acquaintance, they remained under some difficul∣ties before they got into a way of getting a livelihood, and so were under a necessity of making the former spoil of the Dublinians main∣tain them (of which they had still a good plenty left, drinking wine and brandy very profusely) till at last Andrew got acquainted with one Dominick D—t, a rich farmer's son, and a sharp insinuating youth, who was very intimate with several gentlemen in that country. It was beneath a man of Emanuel's fortune to seek customers himself, wherefore Andrew was to manage that point, who thinking this young man would make a sit bate for his hook, told him the whole story concerning the finding of the treasure, as before related, that for fear of the lord of the manor who heard of it, they fled,
<PB N="110" REF="035355_0109_10049EE14A638BC0"/>into that country to conceal it, and to be more private. They were over a cup of liquor at this time, and Farrel pretending to be drunk, called the other aside and spoke very privately, desir∣ing him to let no body know but his nearest friends, who on his account only should get good bargains.</P>
<P>Young D—t was overjoyed at the news, and returned in to talk to Manus, without delay or, suspicion. Manus knowing his inclinations pulled out his ingot of gold. and swore the young man to secrecy, who was charmed with the beau∣ty of the metal; and being very desirous that his friends should make their fortunes, he brought his uncle to Manus, who told him his usual story, (like an ignorant fellow, as he pretended to be) with great artifice and having charged him pretty high with liquor, he got all the man's money, and sent him home with gits in lieu of it; but in some days having discovered the fraud, he complained to Dominick's father, and poor Dominick was turned out of doors for his pains: this was what Manus wanted in his heart, and as soon as he heard thereof, he returned to Cloncumber, a scrubby island in the bog of Allen surrounded with rivers and quagmire: At a small distance from the island stands a wood, from which to the island there is a passage, but then a great part of it is commonly covered with water, and very difficult to find; and on the middle of the island there is a fort, whereon if a man stands, he may view the country round for some miles, and see every body that comes near it. Here he fixed his lodgings, so that when
<PB N="111" REF="035355_0110_10049EE62F2C6698"/>any that he knew not came on the wood side, he commonly would take to the bog; but if on the bog side, to the wood; and here he carried on his game for a long time, never coming out but to make his bargains, and then only in sure com∣pany, to such houses as he well knew.</P>
<P>Andrew had given an item to Dominick where they intended to go, who being turned out as aforesaid, followed them in expectation of get∣ting his money returned; but Manus shewed him so many legerdemain tricks that he soon found it was but in vain to expect any such thing, and so knowing he had no business home without it, he became a dissolute young fellow, and joined his forces along with this new company.</P>
<P>'Tis true he returned to Connaught, but then it was only as a decoy, and to make a prey of others. He brought a collector with him from Eyrecourt, to Cloncumber, whom Mac O'Neil first swere to keep secrecy, and then sold him some of his bars at a very good race, only with this liberty, upon his oath that if any one asked what he had bought, to say it was brass; and says, 'dar a nagh, a dan a negh, I believe it is, for I don't know gold.' But when the collector found out the cheat, he was exasperated and watching an opportunity, had Manus taken up, sent to jail, and trie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Mac O'Neil told the judge on his trial, that whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was seiling him the brass, he made him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he would tell every one he spoke to about it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it was brass. 'And what else should I call it, said he, for it was brass like dish (producing one of the gits) which set the court into a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of laughter and Manus
<PB N="112" REF="035355_0111_10049EE9B5C12390"/>appearing so very ignorant in metal, and so in∣nocent in the matter. was acquitted.</P>
<P>Alter this he removed to the woods near clon∣bullock, where he followed his trade as brisk as ever, sometimes sending away led horses with portmantenus, and sometimes cars with chests <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaden with gits, or else bricks nicely lapped up in paper; but he always took care to keep the leys himself. promising to meet them at such a place as appointed, and they not to meddle with the treasure before he met them.</P>
<P>But when the time expired, his chapman com∣monly began to suspect some fraud, and of conse∣quence would break open the locks, to examine what he had got. One fellow that had made money of all his effects to purchase his treasure, upon opening his portmanteau, sound nothing but bricks carefully lapped up in paper. Which exasperated him to such a degree, that he went back armed in pursuit of Mac O'Neil; but Ma∣nus had removed to the island, as he always did when he expec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a pursuit, where he might rest secure enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill he thought proper to appear again; his absc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding in this manner, made the fellow search in vain, so that he was obliged to return home with loss and shame.</P>
<P>Not long after this, a pretty farmer in the county of Limerick hearing that such a heap of treasure was to be disposed of, privately came up with his wife and all the money he could raise in order to make his for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne for ever. He found Manus near Rathangan, and when he had made a very good bargain. as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e thought and got a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge quantity of the treasu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> into possession, the
<PB N="113" REF="035355_0112_10049EFFCE968328"/>Gold finder shewed as much more to tempt him the man having laid out all the money he brought with him was in no condition to buy more then; however, he had an itching to be at it, and began to treat about the price, which being agreed upon, they entered into articles, and the man was to return home with what trea∣sure he had bought, leaving his wife in pledge with the Gold-finder, 'till be brought the rest of the money back to Manus. When he got ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he put up the treasure, without shewing it to any body, and sold two draft mares he had for about thirty pounds, with which money he went back to Rathangan, in about sixteen days; but when he came to the ale-house where he left them, he could find nobody that he knew but his wife, who informed him the Gold-finders were gone to some island above three days before, and in∣tended to see him no more; upon some other words that she, dropt he not only began to smell the cheat, but was so much blinded with a pair of horns that sprung out of his forehead that mo∣ment, and hung in his eyes, that he spent a month in groping the way home again.</P>
<P>Among other wise men of Gotham who ex∣pected to make their fortune by dealing with Manus, there was one C—h—n near Wexford, a great projector, who having received private intelligence of his vast treasure, rode several miles to make further enquiry and assure him∣self of the matter; concerning which upon his return, he was so well satisfied, that he im∣mediately disposed of as much ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cts to be could conveniently spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and then g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thering tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er
<PB N="114" REF="035355_0113_10049F01BAD40F00"/>what money he had in the house, and owing to him, he made ready for an expedition to the island of Allen. It was about Michelmas, (as Manus says) that this gentleman set out from his house on a stout gelding, equipt like a man of honour, with a silver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilted sword, a new suit of cloaths, a fine hat and wig, and sixty pounds in his pocket, with which he posted directly to Munstereven, attended only by a servant. When he came to his inn, he made all the private en∣quiry possible for the island of Allen, and sent his servant there the next morning to find out the Gold-finder, who returned the following eyening, with directions for his master to come on foot alone, or with his guide, to a little cab∣bin on the side of an island on the bog, and bring his money along with him, for which he might expect ten times the value in gold and jewels, provided he kept the affair a secret; and the bet∣ter to conduct him, Manus sent one of his men, as a guide to show him the way, and tender the usual oath of keeping council; which being done, and their hearts regaled with a good break fast and a cup of strong liquor, they set out, and ar∣rived at the said cabbin about noon: where they found nobody but an old woman, upon which, the guide ordered her to bring a bottle of wine to the gentleman; the wine was accordingly produced, and our projector being fatigued with walking and thirst, drank pretty freely, (not sus∣pecting there was any intoxicating stuff, or the juice of the bogdale in it) and then sat him down to rest, 'till the guide went for Manus. C—, notwithstanding had his thoughts so much upon
<PB N="115" REF="035355_0114_10049F06569284C8"/>the treasure, that sleep did not suddenly invade his eyes, as otherwise it would have done; and when he had waited about an hour, seemed very uneasy that neither Manus came, nor any news from him; upon which the woman went out and called to a boy, and sent him seemingly in a great hurry for her master, and in a little time a messenger returned, with directions to open another bottle, and entertain the gentleman for about an hour, by which time Manus would certainly be there, with all his golden trea∣sure: Upon this, our projector seemed a little easier, got another bottle which put him into a profound sleep, before the Gold-finder appeared: In which condition we must leave him 'till the next day, and only guess at his fortune while he slumbered, by the sequel of the story.</P>
<P>When be awoke, which he supposed to be about 8 the following morning, he was greatly surprized to find himself alone in an empty house, but what most encreased his astonishment was to find himself totally deprived of his money, sword, watch, hat, wig, silver buckles, handherchief, and pocket book. However, up he got, walked about, and called, and cried, and shouted and cursed, and kicked and danced with vexation, round the house, like a madman, till he made himself so weary, that he was forced to leave off. Nobody was to be heard of, nobody to be seen any where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear him, but two little boys in a potatoe garden, who would speak no English, and all that he could understand from them in Irish, was, that nobody lived in the cabin that they knew of; so, my gentleman growing very hungry, was obliged to
<PB N="116" REF="035355_0115_10049F0A4BEE8CD8"/>walk back to his inn (above five miles) in the same moneyless-condition, where he sold his ser∣vant's horse to defray his expences, and by a new hat and wig, and then returned home, almost as poor as Whittington was before he sent his cat to the Indies.</P>
<P>The last story that I shall be particular in, is, of a certain gentleman, well skilled in metal, a sharp man, and one that was resolved not to be imposed on, as he had heard some others had been. He was introduced to Manus by one of his young men before mentioned, and after a good deal of discourse over the liquor, he let him know that he would buy no metal, but such as he would first try with something he had in his pocket, pulling out a bottle of aquafortis. Manus seeing him so cu∣rious, pulled out his ingot of gold, and pretend∣ing to be drunk, says he, "try dish, for I think it is gold dar a nagh agus, dar a negh," which was his usual expression; upon this the gentleman tried the bar, which he found was good gold, and laid the bottle on the table, expecting to see more in a little time. Manus got up as if he was go∣ing for it; but staggering about the room like one in liquor, he watched his opportunity and get∣ting hold of the bottle, "Arra, says he, what sort is dish" and as be was shaking it, a drop or two fell on his fingers and smoked: then seeming∣ly to be terribly affrighted, he cries out, as if in great pain. "O maver, O maver," and at the same time threw the bottle against the wall and broke it. Now farewel aquafortis. The gen∣tleman taking this for no other than the effects of drunkenness and ignorance, said nothing at all
<PB N="117" REF="035355_0116_10049F0BDDAD2B00"/>about the bottle, but laughed at the fellow for a bit of game. However he took care to ask him for the rest of the bars; then Manus told him, "that he had borrowed some money of a priest hard, by, with whom he had lest the bars in pledge, and desired the gentleman to lend him as much money as would release them; to which he con∣sented, provided that he and his men would go with him to the priest's house. Manus assented very readily, and wait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d 'till it was dark; he took the mo∣ney and put it along with the bar in his poc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et; he was so drunk, as he pretended, that he could not ride, but he went on foot along with the gentle∣man and his man, who rid till he came to a river by the side of the bog which he said was near the priest's house. There was a foot-board over the river, and a place a little above it like a ford thro' which he desired them to ride, and he would meet them on the further side. Upon wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they went in easily enough: b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the middle the horses stuck fast in the mire, and threw the riders into the water, to shift for themselves as well they could in a cold winter's night.</P>
<P>He played an hundred tricks like these, of which I have received no exact account, but be∣ing advertised in the public papers in the year 1735, he was much disappointed, and his schemes broken, tho' he kept about Clonbullock &amp;c. send∣ing out his gang to play at small games now and then with rings, buttons, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the methods they now chiefly take to sup∣port themselves, is by cheating in dealing. I'm
<PB N="118" REF="035355_0117_10049F0D8F8D8588"/>told they have places or schools in Dublin, and elsewhere, for instructing their pupils in the art of dissimulation, where they learn to buy and sell upon trust, and so forth; and he is accounted the chiefest among them, that can deceive the most artfully, under the greatest shew of honesty and simplicity. One of their gang, as I am credibly informed, lives near R— street, and by his great art in appearing to be a simple, honest man, has bought above an hundred horses in three years time, for which he never paid a fourth part va∣lue. There are jockies that attend. Smithfield, who whenever they-find a horse in the hands of a person unacquainted with their artifices, come up and tell the seller they can help him to a good chap, an honest man (they call him too) that lives at some distance; here the horses is hurried to their friend, who comes out (perhaps as demure as a priest in a pulpit) and says, 'sure enough I did want a horse some time ago, but now I can't well spare the money: However he appears like some body, and if the seller does not greatly want money, 'tis an hundred to one but he gets a gui∣nea or a moidore in hand, &amp; a promissory note for the remainder. Welldo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Sim—", seen Ch—y well, and never fear Fullum going into the louse house. But I hope his grace may be informed of the matter some time or other.</P>
<P>Some of their gang introduced themselves a∣mong pedlars, either to corrupt them, or defraud those they deal with. At first they seem to deal honestly, and at length take up a little goods on tick, for which they pay pretty punctually, 'till they think they have hooked sufficient, and then
<PB N="119" REF="035355_0118_10049F0FE8F4E8B8"/>they bid a long adieu to that quarter. Indeed their artifices are so various, and their knavery so great, that all dealers and shopkeepers ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> need to be aware of them.</P>

<HEAD>The Life of James Mac-Faul.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES MAC-FAUL was born in Carrick-fergus, in the north of Ireland, in the time of the Irish massacre, wherein his father had a great hand, being forward upon all occasions to plun∣der and destroy whatever he could meet with, and did not care what mischief he did, so he could but enrich himself; 'till at last he was tak∣en by a detachment from the king's army, and hanged upon the next tree, as an example to de∣ter others from such cruelties.</P>
<P>His son James was brought up by his uncle, and put to school under a popish priest, but he being very unlucky, could never be kept to his book, as he would run away for a month toge∣ther, 'till his uncle not knowing what to do with him, determined to send him to England, and let him try his fortune, being certain that the boy had assurance enough to live in any part of the world, and impudence enough to stick at no∣thing; yet Jemmy would not be persuaded to travel, unless his uncle would equip him with a sword, a pair of dice, and a pack of cards, with which he thought he could do well enough.</P>
<P>He made the best of his way to London, but
<PB N="120" REF="035355_0119_10049F178DE1F868"/>found it absolutely necessary in his way to com∣mit some pilfering robberies, for his better sup∣port, for one of which he was well flogged at Bristol, and all his utensils, dice and cards taken from him; when not knowing what to do, he had some thoughts of going to service, which he did for a little while; but work not agreeing with him at all, he borrowed a silver spoon, and some other odd trifles, and marched off one evening without taking his leave, and went directly to one of his countrymen, who disposed of his things, but was angry with him for leaving his place with so little booty, which James begged him not to take notice of, for another time he should find he would do better.</P>
<P>In a little time after, he got into a noble lord's family, where he behaved for twenty months very well, and got the love of all the ser∣vants, particularly of Mrs. Betty the chamber∣maid, who was continually treating him with one good thing or other, and he in return, pro∣fessing a great deal of love and sincerity; which made the girl grow so fond of him, that he in a short time got all that was in her power to give, and then looked as cold on her as a sinking tradesman does on a desperate dun; which Betty perceiving, tried all manner of ways to endear herself to him, but all to no purpose, for the young spark was fallen in love with an ale-house man's daughter, where the servants used to drink, and entirely forsook poor Betty; who, enraged at such usage, could not forbear exposing her folly by upbraiding of him, which had no other effect',
<PB N="121" REF="035355_0120_10049F1921DEE9E8"/>but making herself be laughed at, and hardened him in his impudence; who went on without controul in his amours with his new mistress, and lest his old one to learn more wit.</P>
<P>The young taplash proud of her conquest, that she should rival one of my lord's maids, easily gave up herself to his embraces, and denied him nothing that was in her power to grant, which put Jemmy quite on another footing from the rest of his fellow servants; she keeping the bar had the care of the money, so that Jemmy had his watch and what not, and appeared as great as master any body, and neglected his lord's service to follow his gaming tables and whores, for which he soon lost his place, and had nothing to depend on, but what he got from his sweet-heart; who continually supplying his extrava∣gancies, reduced her father to such necessities, that he was obliged to confess a judgment to the brewer, who, a little after, seized upon all he had, and turned him out of doors.</P>
<P>Jemmy had nothing now to depend on but his own good fortune, and she proving a jilt, as she often does to persons given to extravagance, he was soon reduced to very great wants, when be∣ing arrested and thrown into Marshalse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, be got acquainted with one Thomas Butler, a country∣man of his, with whom he agreed to break out of prison and go on the lay; which they did, and were very successful for some time, 'till Butler was taken and committed to Newgate, and hung the next sessions, and Jemmy very narrow∣ly escaped by sighting his way through the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="035355_0121_10049EF8E1F4B7F0"/>
He still kept a correspondence with his mistress, and made her become as wicked as himself, she turning shop-lifter and pickpocket, and he rob∣bing on the highway, by which they had got near a thousand pounds, and then agreed to part, but upon condition of being serviceable to one another; and the town being too hot for him, he removed to Lancashire, a fortune hunting, and she continued in town to see what would offer in her way, where she got acquainted with Moll Flanders, who lodging in the same house with her, passed for a great fortune; she persuaded her to go down with her into the country, where she might live much cheaper and with more plea∣sure at her brother's house, who was a gentleman of a very good estate in Ireland, or at her sister's who lived near Liverpool, which Moll at length agreed to, not knowing well what else to do with herself, but that was more than the other knew.</P>
<P>Upon the road she treated Moll with all the civilities imaginable, and at Warrington her pretended brother met them in a gentleman's coach, and carried them to Liverpool, where they were entertained in a merchant's house three or four days very handsomely, and from thence they went to a gentleman's house about forty miles distant, where was a numerous family, a noble seat and good company, whom she called cou∣sins: Here they stayed about six weeks, and then came back to a village near Liverpool, where her brother, as she called him, began to make love to Moll, setting himself out as a man of a thousand pounds a year, and indeed talked as big of his seats and parks, as one would be in∣clined
<PB N="123" REF="035355_0122_10049F1AB58D7900"/>to think he had such an estate, but it was all a sham. Moll was not behind in putting her∣self off, although she never plainly told them what she had, yet she did not contradict what her companion said, who reported her to be a wi∣dow worth ten thousand pounds; which so en∣flamed 'squire Mac Faul, that he was ready to run mad at the bait, and plunged into debt over head and ears, for the expences of his courtship; and for fear his estate should be looked into, he never so much as asked about her fortune, but took upon trust whatsoever his old mistress told him, and promised his new one such brave things, that she imagined she should be a lady, when she had got her estate.</P>
<P>They were soon married, and nothing but love and kindness passed between them, he eve∣ry day telling her of the fine things she was to have when they came to Ireland, and she en∣deavouring to improve his affections by her fond∣ness and good behaviour; till at length he be∣gan to discover her intentions of going to West-Chester, in order to embark for Ireland, but ask∣ed his wife if she had no affairs to settle at Lon∣don before she went off; to which she answering No; he seemed much surprised, and said. Ma∣dam, what have we been a doing? I thought the bulk of your estate lay in the bank: Indeed, Sir, said she, I have no estate, nor did I tell you I had; I know not what your sister might say to you, but I did never tell her of any such thing; at which he started like a madman, and swore he had been imposed on, to the last degree; and then calling his sister, he asked her haw she could
<PB N="124" REF="035355_0123_10049F1CABA9D370"/>serve him so? Very well, said she, and not half so much as you deserved; how could you ruin my poor aged father, debauch me, and bring me into all the vices of life; and at last neglect me, and set up for a fortue in the coun∣try? But, said he, what had this gentlewoman done to you that you would ruin her? and then looking upon his wife, he fell down upon his knees and said, you would indeed have been cheat∣ed, my dear, but you would not have been un∣done; for ten thousand pounds would have maintained us both very handsomely in Ireland, and I resolved to dedicate every groat to you; I would not have wronged you of a shilling, and the rest I would have made up in my affection to you, and my tenderness of you as long as I lived; which he said with tears in his eyes, and offered to give her a bill of fifty pounds, which he swore was all he had in the world; which she assuring him was more than she had, and that she came into the country only to live cheap, her whole income not exceeding fifteen pounds a year; at which he shook his head, and remained silent for some time; and then said, Come, my dear, though the case is bad, it is to no purpose to be dejected be as easy as you can; I will en∣deavour to find out some way or other to live: if you can but subsist yourself, that is better than nothing, I must try the world again: a man ought to think like a man: to be discouraged is to yield to the misfortune. And then going to bed, he promised a great many things, but no∣thing could offer, when thore was nothing to be∣gin with; 'till at last he fell asleep; and rose
<PB N="125" REF="035355_0124_10049F211E5B7048"/>betimes in the morning, and took his horses and three servants, all his linen and baggage, and went away, leaving a letter on the table, with twenty guineas in it, advising her with that mo∣ney to make the best of her way to London; but a terror falling upon his mind, when he had rid about fifteen miles, he dismissed his servants, sold their horses, came back, and told her he would accompany her in her way to London, which she agreed to, and in two days time they set out from Chester, he on horseback, and she in the stage-coach, and came to Dunstable toge∣ther, where he told her it was convenient to leave her, for reasons which were improper for her to know.</P>
<P>She desired him to stay with her there a week or two, which he agreed to, in which time she told him how that she had been in Virginia, and that she had now a mother there; and that if her effects had come safe to hand, she might have enough to have maintained them both very handsomely as long as they lived; and that if he had a mind to go there, she believed she could raise about three hundred pounds, which was sufficient to establish a plantation, upon which they might live very well; but he would upon no account agree to it; but said such a sum of money as that would stock a farm in Ireland of an hundred pounds a year, on which they might live as handsomely as a gentleman of five hun∣dred here, and that he had laid a scheme to go over and try: which if it did not succeed, he assured her, he would go with her to America
<PB N="126" REF="035355_0125_10049EDD85E811D8"/>with her with all his heart; and then he let her into the secret part of his life, and gave her rea∣sons why he would not accompany her to Lon∣don, and so took his leave with a great deal of tenderness and affection.</P>
<P>He had not rid far before he met with the three young gentlemen who were his servants, and were newly set up in the same business, with whom he j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gth, and they all went in pursuit of a prize together. At first he, seemed a little fearful, but he soon found they were all as great rogues as himself; and that if they had not had knowledge of what he was, they never would have served him half so long, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they might have an opportu∣nity to rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m, as soon as he had received his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s great fortune, as was expected; which then they told him, it made him begin to bless himself, that his wife did not prove a fortune; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if she had. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght he, in all probability it would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een the cause of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th our deaths; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tainly, said he.

<PB N="127" REF="035355_0126_10049EE7C673BFA8"/>the matter but what he had by hearsay, which Mr. Mac-Faul understanding by one of them who was more honest than the rest, resolved to leave them in the next convenient place, which as he was about to do, a dispute arose, and two were for going one way, and two another. When he found that his old man John the groom, took his part, he was far the stoutest of them all. and so got away without much difficulty, only a volley or two of curses, swearing they would be revenged on him some time or other.</P>
<P>He, with trusty John, returned to Brickhill, where the landlord received them with all the tokens of respect immaginable, and after supper and a bottle, each went to his bed, and in the morning each took his horse, and went about their business. They had not gone far, before they met with the Chester stage-coach, in which was an old rich p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tty-fogger, who was coming to London about law; which they knew was not his right proper business, and therefore they made bold to borrow of him an hundred pieces, which they told him they would l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y out to better uses, and so left the lawyer to patch up his cause as well as he could, all which▪ Mac-Faul gave to John to settle him in some business, and then made the best of his way across the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untry, to∣wards Bristol, in order to pass over to Ireland.</P>
<P>In his journey he happened to meet the Bath coach, in which were two citizens wives, who were going to drink the waters, is hopes to re∣turn pregnant home to their husbands, from whom he took their cold watches, rings, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> forty pound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in money, and then posted
<PB N="128" REF="035355_0127_10049EEC61872CF8"/>to Bristol, where a ship being ready to sail for Ireland, he went on board, and in two days ar∣rived at Cork, from whence he went to Carrick∣fergus, where he set himself up for a man of for∣tune, and told his country men that he had been in England, and that he had married a great for∣tune, and that she was dead, and left him very rich, and that he was come over there to pur∣chase an estate to settle amongst them. By my shoul, that is very good news, said his sister Nan∣ny, for we heard long ago, that you were turned a rapparee, and hang'd at London. No, you fool, saith he, there's no such thing as hanging of Irishmen in that country. We borrow a little money from some good natured woman or other, as soon as possible, and turn gentlemen, marry half a score, rather than not be obliging to the fair sex; and when we have done, break their hearts as soon as we cap. In faith, says Nanny, I'll go over, and see if I can't have as many husbands; for one may stay here all one's life∣time, and never be married, and what then, and who has to do with that? So thou shalt, Nan∣ny, said be; but stay till I return, and I'll take thee along with me, which happened sooner than he expected, for he having got acquainted with an English gentleman's family, pretended to great riches, and that he had a mind to settle there, was admitted to court his sister, who had a thousand pounds to her fortune, which he ma∣naged so artfully by his assurance and applica∣tion, that he soon got the lady's consent; and he presented her with one of the gold watches and a diamond ring, that he had taken from the citi∣zen's
<PB N="129" REF="035355_0128_10049EF203C5A320"/>wives in the Bath coach, which made a mighty figure in that part of the country: with which they were used to walk abroad as if they had been already married, till all things were prepared for the wedding; when an unlucky ac∣cident happened, which knocked all in the head: For as the lovers were riding out one day, he dropt a letter, which he had lately received from Moll Flanders, wherein she informed him what a hue and cry there was after him, and told him he would certainly be hanged if ever he returned to England, and therefore advised him to settle there; for she was married to a change broker at London; which being taken up by one of the servants, and brought to the gentleman, he grew very uneasy, till the sister came home, for fear they should be married privately. As soon as she came home, he called her aside, and shewed her the letter, advising her to return those pre∣sents she had received from him, and have no more to say to him, which the young lady wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very unwilling to do; but her brother told her Mac-Faul was certainly a rogue, and this Moll Flanders, from whom he received the letter was one of the greatest thieves in London. I have heard an hundred stories of her, said he, when I was last summer in England; and yet nobody can take her, altho' she is playing her pranks in one disguise or other every day.</P>
<P>This was very unpleasant news to the young gentlewoman, who had placed her affections en∣tirely upon Mac-Faul, who had a very pretty way of address, and in himself was a good per∣sonable man; and what troubled her most of all
<PB N="130" REF="035355_0129_10049EF397EA8F00"/>was, to part with the gold watch and diamond ring, with which she had made a figure among the ladies above a month; but if it must be so, said she, and then she fell a crying, "Mac-Faul can never be a rogue, so fine a gentleman as Mac-Faul to be a thief, it can never be; this Moll Flanders is some ill woman, who has con∣trived this letter, on purpose to min his happi∣ness. I will never leave him, I will die with him," and a great deal of such silly stuff; so that with all the brother could do, he could scarce prevail with her to forbear marrying him, till he heard from England.</P>
<P>The next time Mac-Faul came to the house, the gentleman shewed him the letter, which he stifly denied, and protested it did not belong to him, and seemed to wonder who should put suck a trick upon him; for he swore ten thou∣sand oaths, that he knew no more of it than the man in the moon; but all would not avail, the gentleman civilly desired him to forbear coming to his house, till he should be better satisfied from his friends in London, and in the mean time gave his word no man should make appli∣cation to his sister in the way of courtship, till then. Mac-Faul begged only to see her, that he might take his leave civilly of her; which upon no account would be granted, for the young la∣dy was as disconsolate as he, &amp; narrowly watch∣ed, so that it was not possible for them to have any intercourse, which so enraged Mac-Faul, that he sent the gentlemen a challenge who ac∣cepted it, and the next morning was to deter∣mine the justice of their pretensions, when the
<PB N="131" REF="035355_0130_10049EF5500F34C0"/>gentleman going to a coffee-house, to look for another to be second, happened to take up a ga∣zette, which was over night come from England, wherein he found an advertisement of the watch and ring his sister had, and a reward of twenty guineas for taking the man, who by the descrip∣tion he knew could be no other than Mac-Faul; which he shewing to his friend and informing him how the whole matter stood, they resolved to se∣cure him; but Mac-Faul having a second with him, they resisted, so that Mac-Faul made his escape, and left his ill gotten goods behind him, and wrote a letter to his sister to bring his money and cloaths to London, where he would meet her.</P>
<P>Mac-Faul made the best of his way to the bogs and there sheltered himself among a parcel of rap∣parees, till he met with an opportunity, and dis∣guise, to ship himself for England, which he did in the habit of a highlander, and he got safe to Brecknock in Wales, where he took a lodging at a widow woman's house whom he gagged and robbed of about forty shillings, and brushed off in the night: from thence crossed the country, till he came to Shrewsbury, where he stole a nag out of King's-land, and made the best of his way to∣wards London, and about two hours after meet∣ing with a country farmer, who was going to pay re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, he told him, he thought he rid very uneasy, and would lend him his horse, for the sake of his company, which the farmer modesty refused, and he as impudently insisted on, till com∣ing to a convenient place, he knocked him off his horse, and swore if he would not change horses,
<PB N="132" REF="035355_0131_100499809A7A03E0"/>he must saddles, for that he could ride no further on a piece of blanket; and so taking his, he found in it fourscore pounds, which made his heart full glad, and much more than he expected, he having no other design but to saddle his nag, and never dreamt of any booty, till he came to take it off, and found by the weight there must be something in it more than straw, altho' by the outside it did not seem to be worth a shilling; but he wanted a saddle, and a saddle he must have, to prevent his being suspected of stealing the gelding.</P>
<P>He had no sooner discovered his prey, but he rode for life, and that day came to a little house, four miles on this side Coventry, where being be∣nighted, he asked if he could have any lodging for a man and horse, which the host told him very readily he might; and introduced him into the kitchen, where he saw the spit saddled with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. Is and other necessaries of life; he asked, who they were for? They told him a couple of gen∣tlemen, who they believed would be very glad of his company, which he was very well pleased with, and desired the landlord to enquire, if a stranger might be admitted, which they readily agreed to. and Mr. Mac-Faul was admitted, with as much ceremony, as if he had been a coun∣try justice of the peace, who behaved himself with so much courtesy, that after a bottle or two, a friendship seemed to be cemented amongst them. The gentlemen were frank and open, and Mac-Faul as full of enquiry as was consistent with his interest, till at last he perceived they were a cou∣ple of graziers just come from London, whom he thought persons worth his better acquaintance,
<PB N="133" REF="035355_0132_10049EFE32F5D278"/>and having informed himself which way they were to travel in the morning, he said he should be glad of their company, and accordingly setting out together, they had not rode above two miles, before he told them his business, and that he must have a little ready money, which was what they did not care to hear of; however for quietness sake, they were forced to submit, and gave him what they had about them, which amounted to about one hundred pounds, with which he rode off, and bid them take care what company they fell into for the future, which they very wisely told him they would, and wished him good luck with his bargain; but it seems it was done with a curse.</P>
<P>In half an hour after this, a couple of jolly fellows met him, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gave him the word stand; which language he not being used to, immediate∣ly drew his pistol, and let fly; this so surpriz'd the two thieves, that they presently began to capitulate, and upon a little further enquiry, found one another to be all Cavalier collectors on the king's highway; and although it is said two of a trade can never agree, yet they entered into a fast triple alliance, that was never broke till two of them were hanged, and their necks broken with a rope as you shall hear more hereafter. And now they frankly communicated to each other the danger they were in, and judg∣ed it safest, to make the best of their way towards Dunstable, near which place they robbed two coaches, and some travellers of lace, which in all amounted to near five hundred pounds; but were
<PB N="134" REF="035355_0133_10049F241D8A8BB8"/>immediately pursued to Brickhill, where staying a little too long, they had like to have been taken, had not Moll Flanders, who was married to ano∣ther husband that day in the town, prevented the Hue and Cry going after them, by assuring the high constable that she knew the gentlemen to be very honest men, and that one of them was a gentleman of a very good estate in Lan∣cashire, from whence she was then upon her journey.</P>
<P>After this he robbed sometimes with his com∣panions, and sometimes by himself; but having got seven or eight hundred pounds, he did not run such desperate risques as formerly, altho' he met with several hard and desperate encounters on the road, by which he had received several wounds, and some very terrible ones indeed, par∣ticularly one with a pistol bullet, which broke his arm, and another with a sword, which run him quite thro' the body; but it missing his vitals he it cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed again; one of his new comrades having kept with him so faithfully, that he assisted him in riding fourscore miles before his arm was set, and then got a surgeon in a considerable city re∣more from the place where it was done, pretend∣ing they were gentlemen travelling towards Car∣lisle, and had been attacked on the road by high∣waymen, whom they resisted, one of them having shot him through the arm.</P>
<P>The cure being pretty chargeable, and they lying about six months out of business, they made the best of their way to Hounslow, where meet-with a coach and six, they robbed it of near two hundred pounds in money and jewels, and twogold
<PB N="135" REF="035355_0134_10049F25CD219668"/>watches; but Mac-Faul being not quite recover∣ed of his lameness, did not ride up to the coach with the other, but stood upon the watch, at a distance while they robbed the coach; when some gentlemen coming on horseback from Wind∣sor, hearing there were highwaymen in the road, pursued them, he not being able to keep company with the others, on account of his wound; who utterly denied that he had any knowledge of the highwaymen and swore he bad like to have been robbed himself; but that would not avail, for he was known to be an old offender, and was carried before a justice of the peace, who committed him to New-gate, where he lay for above half a year; but no evidence coming in against him, he was or∣dered to transport himself, which he did.</P>

<HEAD>The History of Gilder-Roy a Murderer, Ra∣visher, Incendiary, and Highwayman.</HEAD>
<P>THIS villain was descended of an ancient fa∣mily, and born in Perthshire in the Highlands of Scotland; whose father dying just as he came of age, left him 80 marks a year, which he squan∣dered away in less than a year and a half, and then lived upon his mother, till she found no hopes of reclaiming him. When with-holding her hand, he burst one night into her bed cham∣ber and cut her throat from ear to ear, and then ravished his own sister and the maid; and after∣wards
<PB N="136" REF="035355_0135_10049F29AA21FAF0"/>robbing the house, set it a fire, and burnt them both in it.</P>
<P>This unparalleled piece of villainy soon made a noise all over the kingdom, upon which a pro∣clamation was issued out, promising a hundred pounds reward, to take him dead or alive, which made him fly into France, where he picked Car∣dinal Richlieu's pocket as he was saying mass at St. Dennis's in Paris: which the king perceiving, Gilder Roy made motions to the king, not to take any notice, and he should see good sport; upon which the king let him alone; and after prayers going to the cardinal, he asked him if he had an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> money about him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who missing his purse, fell into a great surprise; but the king knowing which way it went, fell a laughing; till being tired with laughter, he was willing the cardinal should know what was become of it: For the king thinking the thief to be an honest man, was willing the car∣dinal should have his money again; but Gilder-Roy had more wit in his anger, than to come near either of them; which the cardial finding, turn∣ed all his laughter against the king, which made him swear it was the first time that ever a thief made him his confederate. Upon this, flying out of France into Spain, he went upon a day of public entertainment to the duke of Medina Ca∣ll's house, where seeing several pieces of plate in a trunk, ready for the servants to attend their lords with, he dressed himself in a Spanish habit, like the steward of the house, and desiring the servants to sit off the trunk, he carried it away.</P>
<P>By this time Gilder-Roy, thinking all the noise was over about him in his own country, resolved
<PB N="137" REF="035355_0136_10049F2E75DE5820"/>to go to Scotland again, where he soon became as notorious a highwayman, as ever was in the country before. He first robbed the earl of Lith lingow of a gold watch, a diamond ring, and 80 pieces of gold; by which he became so terrible, that people were afraid to travel; and when he wanted money, he would go into Athol, Locha∣ber, Angeni, Mar, Baqueham; Murrey, Suther∣land, and all over the north, and drive away their cattle, unless they paid him contributions, which they did quarterly.</P>
<P>One time Oliver Cromwell embarking at Do∣naghadee, in the North of Ireland, landed at Port-Patrick, in Scotland, which Gilder-Roy hearing of, met him and two servants in the road to Glasgow, bidding him stand and deliver; when, after the exchange of some pistols, Gilder-Roy made off, and they pursued him, when Gilder-Roy turning short, shot Oliver's horse, which fal∣ling down broke Oliver's leg; then he killed one of the servants, and gave the other quarter; which done, finding Oliver lame, he tied his legs under an ass's belly, and sent them both to seek their fortune.</P>
<P>Three of his companions being taken, and sent to Glasgow goal, were ordered to be hanged in chains; which Gilder-Roy resenting, he vowed revenge one time or other; and a little after, meeting the judge upon the road to Aberdeen, he stripped his coachman and two footmen, tied them neck and heels, and threw, them into a pond; he then robbed the judge and killed his four horses, and carried him to the tree where
<PB N="138" REF="035355_0137_10049F300EEBD6E8"/>his companions hanged, (which in Scotland is like a turn stile) where upon the fourth beam he hang∣ed the judge, saying, "By my sol, mun, as this structure, erected to break people's cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igs, is not uniform without another, I'se must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'en hang you upon the vacant beam." At length, his villainies grew so intolerable, that he gloried not only in robbing, but murdering men, ravishing women, and burning houses. But a proclamation coming out with a reward of 1000 marks, to take him dead or alive, one Peg Cunnigham, a strump∣et with whom he kept company, betrayed him; when finding himself surrounded with 50 men; he ran into her bed-chamber, and ripped up the har∣lot's guts, and then killed 7 of his adversaries, before they could take him; but at last being overcome, he was taken and carried to Edin∣burgh caste, where he was kept in irons three days, without victuals or drink, and then hanged without any process, on a gibbet 50 feet high, in April 1658, aged 34 years; and afterwards hanged on another gibbet 40 feet high, on the road betwixt Leith and Edinburgh.</P>

<HEAD>The History of Thomas Darbel, a Muderer, Ra∣visher, and Highwayman.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born at Shafesbury, in Dorsetshire, and put apprentice to a glover at Blandford; but running away from his master, before he had served his time, he came up to London; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent upon the highway at the age of seventeen,
<PB N="139" REF="035355_0138_10049F3386D9C4D8"/>though in the first attempt he had like to have been nipt in the bud; for meeting with a Welch∣man, and demanding his money, he said, "hur has no money of hur own, but has threescore pounds of hur master's which hur cannot part with." Quota Tom, you shall not cant me off thus; money I want, and money I must have; hereupon the Welchman give him the money, saying, "What will you give but none of hur own? pray shot shur thro' the coat, that hur mas∣ter may see hur was robbed;" which Tom doing, cots splutter a nails, saith Tuffy, this is a pretty pounce; pray give hur another pounce for hur money; which he did; by St. Davy, saith the Welchman, this is a better pounce than the other; pray give her another; quoth Tom, I have no more; then saith Taffy, hur has one pounce left for hur, and if hur will not give hur hur money, hur will pounce hur through the body.</P>
<P>After this, Tom was pretty successful in his villany, for above five years. Once he under∣took for 500 pounds to save a gentleman that was condemned; hereupon, when just as the judge was about to pass the sentence, he cried out to the bench that he had committed that robbery; upon which the gentleman was cleared and when they came to try him, the evidence not presuming to swear against him, they having sworn positively against the other, he was ac∣quitted also.</P>
<P>Afterwards Tom attacked, on Salisbury plain, the duke of Norfolk, who taking him, carried him to Salisbury goal, where he was condemned; but for money got a reprieve, and at length his
<PB N="140" REF="035355_0139_10049F37C16C5970"/>liberty. After this he went to serve a lady in Ormond-street, who having a niece coming out of the country, sent Tom to meet her; whom he first robbed of her gold watch, diamond-ring, &amp; jewels, and then tied her neck and heels, and de∣bauched her; which being discovered, he was ta∣ken upon pursuit the Wednesday following, at Hammersmith, just after he had robbed a gen∣tleman of three guineas, and committed to New∣gate; from whence he was removed to Bristol, where he received sentence of death for this hor∣rid crime. The young lady died a little after, for which he shewed no remorse of conscience: Yet he was hanged on Saturday, the 23d of March, 1714, in the 45th year of his age; he di∣ed very impenitently. After he was executed on St. Michael's Hill, he was cut down, and hanged in chains, in the road without Diafford's gate.</P>
