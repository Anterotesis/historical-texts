<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT the greatness and prosperity of a people depend upon the proportion of public spirit and the love of virtue, which is found to exist among them, seems to be a maxim established by the universal consent and I may say experience of all ages.</P>
<P>MAN is formed with a constitution wonderfully adapted for social converse and connection. Scarcely ushered into the world, but his wants teach him his inability, of himself, to provide for them. Wrapt in astonishment, with an anxiety inexpressible, the solitary existant looks around for the aid of some friendly neigh∣bour,
<PB N="6" REF="016836_0005_0F9EC000E82EBA58"/>and should he perchance meet the desired object; should he find one, endowed with intellectual faculties, beset with the same wants and weaknesses, and in all respects the very image of himself; should he find him with a heart open to mutual kind offi∣ces, and a hand stretched out to bestow a proportion of his labour, with a bosom glowing with gratitude, his soul is on the wing to express the sense he entertains of the generous obligation.</P>
<P>A CONFIDENCE is established between him and his benefactor, they swear perpetual friendship, and a compact for mutual pro∣tection and assistance becomes imperceptably consented to. Thus doubly armed, together they pursue their morning rout to satisfy those demands only which nature reminds them of, and while the ingenuity of the one is exercised to ensnare, the strength of the other is perhaps employed to subdue their vigorous opponent.</P>
<P>THEIR little family soon encreases, and as their social ring becomes gradully enlarged, their obligations to each other are equally circular. Honest industry early teaches them that a part only is sufficient to provide for the whole, and that a portion of their time may be spared to cull the conveniences as well as ap∣pease the wants of nature. Property and personal security appear to be among the first objects of their attention, and acknowledged merit receives the unanimous suffrage to preside guardian over the rights and priveledges of their infant society. The advantages de∣rived are in a moment experienced. Their little policy, erected
<PB N="7" REF="016836_0006_0F9EC0017A897558"/>upon the broad basis of equality, they know of no superiorty but that which virtue and the love of the whole demands; and while with chearfulness they entrust to his care a certain part of their natural rights, to secure the remainder, the agreement is mutual, and the obligation upon his part equally solemn and binding to re∣sign them back, either at the instance and request of their sovereign pleasure, or whensoever the end should be perverted for which he received them.</P>
<P>INTEGRITY of heart, benevolence of disposition, the love of freedom and public spirit, are conspicuous excellencies in this select neighbourhood. Lawless ambition is without a friend, and the in∣sinuating professional pleas of tyrants, ever accompanied by the magnificence and splendor
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>A mods of living above a man's annual income, weakens the State, by reducing to poverty not only the squanderers themselves, but many innocent and industrious persons connected with them.

<PB N="8" REF="016836_0007_0F9EC00235785EA8"/>that spirit originated, we find them attaining real glory; we find them crowned with every blessing that human nature hath ever known of; we find them in the possession of that summit of solid happiness that universal depravity will admit of.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM is essential to the preservation and well being of every free government. To
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The amor patriae or patriotism stands at the head of social affections, and so high in our esteem, that no actions but what preceed from it, are termed grand or heroic. It triumphs over every selfish motive, is a firm support to every virtue, and wherever it prevails the morals of the people are found to be pure and correct.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Elements of Criticism.</BIBL></NOTE> love one's country has ever been esteemed honorable, and under the influence of this noble passion every social virtue is cultivated, freedom prevails through the whole, and the public good is the object of every one's concern. A Con∣stitution built upon such principles, and put in execution by men possessed with the love of virtue and their fellow men, must always ensure happiness to it's members. The industry of the citizen will receive encouragement and magnanimity; heroism and benevolence will be esteemed the admired qualifications of the age. Every the least invasion on the public liberty, is considered as an infringe∣ment on that of the subject; and feeling himself roused at the ap∣pearance of oppression, with a divine enthusiasm he flies to obey the summons of his country, and does she but request with zeal he resigns the life of the individual for the preservation of the whole.</P>
<P>WITHOUT some portion of this generous principle, anarchy and confusion would immediately ensue, the jarring interests of indivi∣duals
<PB N="9" REF="016836_0008_0F9EC003226FB450"/>regarding themselves only, and indifferent to the welfare of others, would still further heighten the distressing scene, and with the assistance of the selfish passions, it would end in the ruin and sub∣version of the State. But where patriotism is the leading principle, unanimity is conspicuous in public and private councils. The Con∣stitution receives for it stability the united efforts of every indivi∣dual, and revered for it's justice, admired for it's principle, and for∣midable for it's strength, it's same reaches to the skies.</P>
<P>SHOULD we look into the history of the antient republics, we shall find them a striking example of what I have asserted, and in no part of their progress to greatness, producing so many illustri∣ous actions, and advancing so rapidly in the road to glory, as when actuated by public spirit and the love of their country. The Greeks in particular ever held such sentiments as these in the highest vener∣ation, and with such sentiments as these alone they established their freedom, and finally conquered the innumerable armies of the East.</P>
<P>WHEN Xerxes,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herod.

<PB N="10" REF="016836_0009_0F9EC003DEB701B0"/>and extirpation of this small but free people; what do we perceive to be their conduct upon so alarming an occasion? Do they tamely submit without a struggle? Do they abandon their proper∣ty, their liberties and their country, to the fury of these merciless invaders? Do they meanly supplicate the favor, or intreat the hu∣manity of this haughty prince? No! Sensible of the justice of their cause, and that valor is oftentimes superior to numbers; undaunted by the appearance of this innumerable host, and fired with the glorious zeal, they with one voice resolve to establish their liberties or perish in the attempt.</P>
<P>VIEW them at the moment when the armies of their enemies, like an inundation, over-spread their whole Graecian territory; when oppression seemed as tho' collecting it's mighty force, and li∣berty lay fettered at the shrine of ambition, then shone forth the heavenly principle, then flamed the spirit of the patriot, and laying aside all sentiments of jealously, as tho' favored with the prophetic wisdom of Heaven, with bravery unexampled, they charge their foe, and fighting in defence of their country, success crowns the virtuous attempt. With three hundred Lacedimonians,

A monu∣ment was afterwards erected to the memory of Leonidas and those who fell with him at Thermopylae; upon which was this inscription:</HI>

THE priviledges and immunities of the
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Temple</HI>'s <HI>Obser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> States of <HI>Holland,</HI> after a contest of forty years, in which they withstood the exer∣tions of their powerful neighbours, being established by the force of this single principle, which appears to prevail both in the Senate and the field, might also be adduced in support of what I have advanced, but, my fellow-countrymen, we cannot want additional proofs▪ the living history of our own times, will carry conviction to the latest posterity, that no State, that no community, I may say that no family, nay even that no individual can possibly flourish and be happy, without some portion of this sacred fire. It was this that raised <HI>America</HI> from being the haunt of the savage, and the dwelling-place of the beast, to her present state of civilization and opulence: It was this that hath supported her under the severest trials: It was this that taught her sons to fight, to conquer and to die in support of freedom and it's blessings; and what is it, but this ardent love of liberty, that has induced you, my fellow-citizens, to attend on this solemn occasion, again to encourage the streams of sensibility and to listen with so much attention and candour to one of the youngest of your fellow-citizens, whose youth and inability plead powerfully against him, while the annual tribute is paid to the memory of those departed citizens, who fell the first sacrifices to arbitrary power. Check not such generous feelings. They are the fruits of virtue and humanity, and while the obliga∣tions you remain under to those unhappy men, lead you to shed the sympathetic tear, to dwell with pleasure upon their memories, and execrate the causes of their death, remember that you can never repay them. Ever bear it in your minds, that so implicit was the confidence you willingly placed in that country, that owed
<PB N="12" REF="016836_0011_0F9EC00809E33448"/>to you her affection, that notwithstanding the introduction of that inhuman weapon of tyrants into the very heart of your peaceful villages, you still would feign rely upon their deceitful assertions, and paint the deformed monster to your imaginations as the minis∣ter of peace and protection. Men born in the bosom of liberty, living in the exercise of the social affections in their full vigor, hav∣ing once fixed them upon particular objects, they are not hastily eradicated. Unaccustomed to sport with, and wantonly sacrifice these sensible overflowings of the heart, to run the career of passion and blinded lust, to be familiar with vice and sneer at virtue, to surprize innocence by deceitful cunning, and assume the shade of friendship to conceal the greater enmity, you could not at once realize, the fixed, the deliberate intention of those from whom you expected freedom, to load you with slavery and chains, and not till insult repeated upon insult: Not till oppression stalked at noon-day through every avenue in your cities: Nay not till the blood of your peaceful brethren flowed through your streets, was the invenomed serpent to be discovered in the bushes: Not till a general trespass had been made upon the keenest feelings of human nature, and the widowed mother was summoned to entomb the cold remains of her affectionate son; the virtuous bosom to resign its tender partner, and social circles their nearest friends; could you possibly convince yourselves that you and <HI>Britain</HI> were to be friends no more. Thrice happy day! The consequences of which have taught the SONS of AMERICA that a proper exercise of public spirit and the love of virtue hath been able to surprize and baffle the most formidable and most powerful tyranny on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016836_0012_0F9EC008463873F8"/>
PATRIOTISM is a virtue which will ever be universally admir∣ed, even by those incapable of possessing it. Its happy effects are equally visible in individuals as in States, and if we bestow a mo∣ments reflection upon the heroes of antiquity, who have been de∣servedly celebrated by succeeding generations, both for their abili∣ties and conduct, we shall find that the true source of their great∣ness was this spirit of freedom, and their inviolable attachment to the interest of their country.</P>
<P>WITH an attentive silence we listen to the historian while he re∣lates to us the integrity of conduct, the invincible courage, the earnest glow of soul, and the ardent love of liberty which was ex∣hibited in the lives of those illustrious men, and so great were their virtues that we are scarce able to credit them, but as the dreams of fancy, or the fictions of the ingenious.</P>
<P>IT is recorded of the celebrated
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rollin.</HI></NOTE> Timoleon, general of Corinth, that notwithstanding he was blest with a temper singularly humane, and with feelings that were ever roused at the miseries of his fellow∣men, he loved his country so passionately, that after making use of every argument in his power to convince an older brother of his error, for attempting to become the tyrant of it, be devoted him to death; a brother on whom he had previously placed his affection, and whose life being exposed to the fire of an enemy in a severe battle, be had before saved at the great risque of his own. Even in old age, after a period of rigid retirement for twenty years, we are at∣tracted by the disinterested conduct of this exalted patriot.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="016836_0013_0F9EC0090CEE2A58"/>
WHEN the Syracusians, groaning under every species of cruelty, which lust, avarice and ambition could inflict, supplicated their gene∣rous neighbours for assistance, to alleviate those miseries they them∣selves had been exposed to. Timoleon, urged to accept the com∣mand of the Corinthian Auxiliaries, at first hesitated, his age, his manners, his private happiness and the endearments of his family forbid it; but sensible that he was but a member of the commu∣nity, and stung by the cries of innocence, his inclinations were but of trivial moment in competition with his duty.—</P>
<P>VIEW him at the head of his chosen army, assembled to plead the cause of suffering virtue. In possession of arms and of power if inclined to pervert them, are his principles changed with his station? Are his thoughts bent on conquest or on death? Or does he entertain a secret wish to seize the moment of confidence, and build his greatness upon the ruin of the distressed, to remove one tyrant to reinstate another? No, but fired with a generous glow of soul, fired with the manly sentiments of freedom, with an im∣placable hatred to oppression of all kinds, he marches his troops to the deliverance of this afflicted people, and with a firmness becom∣ing soldiers, fighting under the standard of liberty, after a series of fatigue and toil, harrassing marches and fierce conflicts, he de∣thrones the tyrant, and is proclaimed the deliverer of Syracuse.— Having restored tranquility to this unhappy country, repeopled their cities, revived their laws, and dispensed justice to all ranks and classes, he resigned his command, and retreated once again to the private walks of life, accompanied with the greatful acknow∣ledgments of millions as the patron of their liberty and the saviour
<PB N="15" REF="016836_0014_0F9EC009C03CFD48"/>of their coun'ry.—Happy man! endowed with such a noble soul, prone to feel for the misfortunes, and rejoice in the happi∣ness of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>BUT why need we resort to distant ages to furnish us with instances of the effects of patriotism upon individuals? Will not the present day afford at least one illustrious example to our purpose? Yes, my fellow-countrymen, AMERICA, young AMERICA too, can boast her patriots and heroes, men who have saved their coun∣try by their virtues, whose characters posterity will admire, and with a pleased attention, listen on tiptoe to the story of their glo∣rious exertions. Let us pause a moment only upon the select cata∣logue, and take the first upon the lift.—</P>
<P>VIEW him in his private station, and here, as though Provi∣dence for his excellencies had selected him for her own; from the extensive circle of humanity, we perceive him enjoying her richest dispensations. By an affluent fortune placed beyond the reach of poverty or dependence, bless'd with the social circle of friends, and happily connected by yet more endearing ties; peaceful reflections are his companions through the day, and the soothing slumbers of innocence hover over his couch: Charity presides steward of his houshold, and the distressed are ever sure to receive from his bosom that sigh which never fails to console, and from his cheek the al∣leviating tear of sympathy. Having reached the summit of human felicity beyond even the picture of his most sanguine expectations, it is indifferent to him as an individual, whether prince or people
<PB N="16" REF="016836_0015_0F9EC00A8EB3BBA0"/>rule the State, but nurtured in the bosom of freedom, endowed with a greatness of soul, swallowed up with public spirit and the love of mankind, does oppression scatter her baleful prejudices, does ambition rear its guilty crest, friends,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cari sum parentes, cari liberi, propinqui, familiares, sed omnes omnium caritates patria una complexa est, pro quis bonus dubitet mortem oppetere?</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> relations and fortune are like the dust of the balance. The pleas of nature give way to those of his country, and urged on by heavenly motives, he flies instantly to her relief. See him while grief distracts his bosom, at the effusion of human blood, grasp the sword of justice and buckle on the harness of the warrior. See him with fortitude un∣parrallel'd, with perseverance indefatigable, deaf to pleasure and despising corruption, chearfully encountering the severest tasks of duty, and the hardiest toils of a military life. Modest in prosperi∣ty, and shining like a meteor in adversity, we behold this patriotic hero, with a small army of determined freemen, attacking, fighting and conquering an army composed of the bravest veteran troops of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>AND shall we, my countrymen. stop the current of gratitude? And can we forbear testifying our joy upon the success of such singular exertions? Shall we seal his death before we thank him for his services? By no means.—Our acknowledgments will irresistably flow from us to this deserved object of admiration, and his very actions will sting the soul of the ungrateful wretch, until he is for∣ced to admire their lustre, and confess his inability to equal them</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="016836_0016_0F9EC00B34E11048"/>
SOME there are, who, Roman like, would banish him for his good conduct; but while we copy the spirit of this great people, let us not be as diligent to catch their vices. Such conduct is incon∣sistent with the sentiments of freemen, and surely we cannot forget that he has saved our country.</P>
<P>REWARDS
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>One method of preventing crimes is to reward virtue. If the rewards for the disco∣very of useful truths have increased our knowledge, and multiplied good bocks, is it not probable that rewards, distributed by the beneficent hand of a sovereign, would also multiply virtuous actions. The coin of honor is inexhaustible, and is abundant∣ly fruitful in the hands of a prince who distributes it wisely.</HI> Marq. <HI>of</HI> Becea.</NOTE> and punishments are in the hands of the public, and it is equally consistent with generosity and humanity, to be∣stow the one, as inflict the other. We cannot be too cautious in the objects of our gratitude, let merit, conspicuous merit be the stand∣ard to which our praises shall resort, and it will excite a noble emulation in others, and let us rather forbear that respect, which is too often found attendant upon the rich, though their wealth has been amassed with the ruin of their country.</P>
<P>BUT the praises of us are not the patriot's only reward; with an approving conscience, sweetning the declivity of life, his invitation is to the skies, there to receive a far more precious reward, for the establishment of that principle to which since the origin of mankind, heaven hath paid an immediate attention.</P>

<P>SUCH is the progress of public spirit and the love of virtue, and it is the only pillar, upon which can safely be erected the happiness of mankind. Without some play of the social affections in every society, without some barrier to oppose the stormy passions of in∣dividuals, without some general attachment to the public welfare, a door is open to ambition and political corruption,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Assyrian, the Persian and Graecian, the three first universal monarchies, finally sunk under luxury and corruption; and it is well known that the Romans did not preserve their liberties for half a century after being debanched by the luxury of Asia, but fell a prey to its vices, and was at length divided by the Goth's and Vandals.</HI></NOTE> luxury and selfishness become fashionable vices, and the spirit of the govern∣ment is perverted; the public good is neglected, the riches of the State insecure, the liberty of the subject slighted, and the attempts of the tyrant made successful by the follies of the people.</P>
<P>WHAT but the want of patriotism that hath buried in ruins the mighty empires of Greece and Rome; that standing armies, the
<PB N="19" REF="016836_0018_0F9EC00CE90EC1E8"/>scourge of the innocent prevail throughout all Europe; that the pages of history present to our view so melancholly a picture of the human species, and that America and Britain are not at this day, running the road to greatness and glory in concert; and what is it but the want of patriotism that could induce this haughty na∣tion, divested of every public virtue, of every bosom seeling, of every pretension to humanity, without apology or pretext to usher a standing army, composed of vagrants, criminals and mercenaries into our peaceful country.</P>
<P>O MY countrymen, it is the want of patriotism, that we are at this time called to weep over the wanton massacre of innocent men; that this is not the only house of mourning; that the fields of America have become devoted to war, and scenes of slaughter familiar to her sons; that our oppressors yet persist in their destructive system of tyranny, and if their power was equal to their thrist of blood, with the spirit of ambition by which they are now di∣rected, would lead them to destroy and extirpate the whole human race. But thanks be to Heaven, that by the force of those virtues which they have discarded, we have nobly resisted the attempts of these cruel men, and the miseries they have so profusely dealt out to us, are returning with additional vengeance upon their own heads. The danger of the issue is now past, and if we but retain the same patriotick ardor, with which we first defended our rights from the grasp of our enemies, they are every day in our power. We have every thing to hope; they on the other hand have every thing to sear. Youth, vigor and the invincible arm of justice are on our side:—The genius of liberty also is our advocate, who though persecuted, hath never been conquered.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="016836_0019_0F9EC00E0E92D5C0"/>
IN our day we are called to see a happy country laid waste at the shrine of ambition; to experience those scenes of distress which history is filled with, but experience rivetts it's lessons upon the mind, and if we resolve with deliberation, and execute with vigor, we may yet be a free and flourishing people. Repine not too much at the ravages of war, nor murmur at the dispensations of Provi∣dence. We oftentimes rate our blessings in proportion to the dif∣ficulty of attaining them, and if without a struggle we had secured our liberties, perhaps we should have been less sensible of their valor. Chastisements in youth are not without their advantages. Blessings most commonly spring from them in old age. They lead us to reflect seriously in the hour of retirement, and to cherish those qualifications, which are frequently lost in the glare of prosperity.</P>
<P>THE important prophecy is nearly accomplished. The rising glory of this western hemisphere is already announced, and she is summoned to her seat among the nations. We have publicly de∣clared ourselves convinced of the destructive tendency of standing armies: We have acknowledged the necessity of public spirit and the love of virtue, to the happiness of any people, and we profess to be sensible of the great blessings that flow from them. Let us not then act unworthy of the reputable character we now sustain▪ Like the nation we have abandoned, be content with freedom in form and tyranny in substance, profess virtue and practice vice, and convince an attentive world that in this glorious struggle for our lives and properties, the only men capable of prizing such exalted priviledges, were an illustrious set of heroes, who have seal'd their
<PB N="21" REF="016836_0020_0F9EC00E34546C60"/>principles with their blood. Dwell, my fellow-citizens, upon the present situation of your country? Remember that though our enemies have dispensed with the hopes of conquering, our land is not entirely freed of them, and should our resistance prove unsuc∣cessful by our own inattention and inactivity, death will be far pre∣ferable to the yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>LET us therefore be still vigilant over our enemies.—Instill into our armies the righteous cause they protect and support, and let not the soldier and citizen be distinct characters among us. By our conduct let us convince them,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>It has ever been thought inconsistent with good policy and even common sense to com∣mit the defence of a country to men who have no interest in it's preservation.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Diod. Lib. 1. p. 67.</BIBL></NOTE> that it is for the preservation of themselves and their country, they are now fighting; that they equally with us are interested in the event, and abandon them not to the insatiable rapacity of the greedy extortioner.</P>
<P>As a reward for our exertions in the great cause of freedom, we are now in the possession of those rights and priviledges attendant upon the original state of nature, with the opportunity of establish∣ing a government
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The true definition of a free State is where the legislative adhires strictly to the laws of nature, and calculates every one of it's regulations for improving society and for promoting industry and honesty among the people.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Home's His. vol. 2. p. 132.</BIBL></NOTE> for ourselves, independent upon any nation or people upon earth. We have the experience of ages to copy from,
<PB N="22" REF="016836_0021_0F9EC011A20215D0"/>advantages that have been denied to any who have gone before us. Let us then, my fellow-citizens, learn to value the blessing. Let integrity of heart, the spirit of freedom and rigid virtue, be seen to actuate every member of the commonwealth. Let not party rage, private animosities, or self interested motives, succeed that religious attachment to the public weal which has brought us successfully thus far; for vain are all the boasted charms of liberty if her great∣est votaries are guided by such base passions. The tryal of our patriotism is yet before us, and we have reason to thank Heaven, that it's principles are so well known and defused. Exercise towards each other the benevolent feelings of friendship, and let that unity of sentiment which has shone in the field, be equally animating in our councils.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that prosperity is dangerous; that though success∣ful we are not infallible; that like the rest of mankind we are ca∣pable of erring. The line of our happiness may be traced with ex∣actness, and still there may be a difficulty in persuing it. Let us not forget that our enemies have other arts in store for our destruc∣tion; that they are tempting us into those snares, which after suc∣cessful struggles, proved the ruin of the empires of the East, and let this sacred maxim receive the deepest impression upon our minds, that if avarice, if extortion, if luxury and political corruption, are suffered to become popular among us, civil discord and the ruin of our country will be the speedy consequence of such fatal vices, but while patriotism is the leading principle, and our laws are contrived
<PB N="23" REF="016836_0022_0F9EC0129675D508"/>with wisdom and executed with vigor, while industry, frugality and temperance are held in estimation, and we depend upon public spirit and the love of virtue for our social happiness, peace and affluence will throw their smiles upon the brow of the individual, our com∣monwealth will flourish, our land become the land of liberty, and AMERICA an asylum for the oppressed.</P>
