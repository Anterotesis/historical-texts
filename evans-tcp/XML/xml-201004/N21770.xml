<HEAD>THE SURPRISING LIEE AND DEATH OF Dr. <HI>John Faustus.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of his Parentage and Birth.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN FAUSTUS</HI> was born in the town of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> in the prov∣ince of <HI>Weimer,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> his fa∣ther a poor husbandman, and not able well to bring him up; yet having an uncle at <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> a rich man, and without issue, he took this <HI>Faustus</HI> from his father and made him his heir, insomuch that his father was no more troubled with him; for he remained with his uncle at <HI>Witten∣burg,</HI> where he was kept at the uni∣versity in the same city, to study <HI>Di∣vinity;</HI> but <HI>Faustus</HI> being of a naugh∣ty mind, and otherwise addicted, plied not his studies, but betook him∣self
<PB N="6" REF="028655_0004_0FDA3BACD602CBD0"/>to other exercises, which his un∣cle hearing often, rebuked him for it; as <HI>Eli</HI> oftentimes rebuked his children for sinning against the Lord, even so this good old man laboured to have <HI>Faustus</HI> apply his study to <HI>Divinity,</HI> that he might come to the knowledge of God and his law. But it is manifest that many virtuous parents have wicked children, as <HI>Cain, Reuben, Absalom,</HI> and such like, have been to their parents. So <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> having godly parents, who seeing him to be of a forward wit, were de∣sirous to bring him up in virtuous studies, namely, of <HI>Divinity;</HI> but he gave himself secretly to <HI>Necro∣mancy</HI> and <HI>Conjuration,</HI> insomuch that few or none could perceive his profession.</P>
<P>But to the purpose, <HI>Faustus</HI> con∣tinued at study in the university, and was by the Rectors, and sixteen mas∣ters afterwards, examined how he had profited in his studies; and be∣ing found by them, that none of his time were able to argue with him in <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nity,</HI> or for the excellency of his
<PB N="7" REF="028655_0005_0FDA3BDF34791B00"/>wisdom, to compare with him, with one consent they made him <HI>Doctor of Divinity.</HI> But Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> with∣in a short time after he had obtained his degree, fell into such fantasies, and deep cogitations, that he was mocked of many, and of most part of the students was called the <HI>Specula∣tor;</HI> and sometimes he would throw the scriptures from him, as though he had no care of his former profes∣sion, so that he began a most ungod∣ly life, as hereafter more at large may appear; for as the old <HI>proverb</HI> says, <HI>Who can hold what will away?</HI> So, who can hold <HI>Faustus</HI> from the dev∣il, that seeks after him with all his endeavours; for he accompanied himself with divers that were seen in those devilish arts, and that had the <HI>Chaldean, Persian, Hebrew, Ara∣bian</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> tongues, using fig∣ures, characters, conjurations, incan∣tations, with many other ceremonies belonging to those infernal arts, as <HI>Necromancy, Charms, Soothsaying, Witchcraft, Enchantment,</HI> being de∣lighted with their books, words and
<PB N="8" REF="028655_0006_0FDA3BAE5447FC70"/>names so well, that he studied day and night therein, insomuch that he could not abide to be called <HI>Doctor of Divinity,</HI> but waxed a worldly man, and named himself an <HI>Astrologian,</HI> and a <HI>Mathematician,</HI> and for a shad∣ow sometimes a <HI>Physician,</HI> and did great cures; namely, with <HI>herbs, roots, waters, drinks</HI> and <HI>clysters;</HI> and without doubt he was passing wise and excellent in holy scriptures: <HI>But be that knoweth his master's will, and doth it not, is worthy to be beaten with many stripes.</HI> It is written. <HI>No man can seve two masters, and thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> But <HI>Faustus</HI> threw all this in the wind, and made his soul of no estimation, regarding more the worldly pleasures than the joys to come; therefore at the day of judgment there is no hope of his redemption.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How Dr.</HI> Faustus <HI>began to practise his Develish Art; and conjured the Devil, making him to appear, and meet him on the morrow morning at his own house.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU have heard before, that all <HI>Faustus</HI>'s mind was to study the arts of <HI>Necromancy</HI> and <HI>Conjuration;</HI> which exercise he followed day and night, and taking to him the wings of an eagle, thought to fly over the whole world, and to know the secrets of heaven and earth; for his specu∣lation was so wonderful, being ex∣pert in using his <HI>Vocabula,</HI> figures, character, conjuration and other cer∣emonial actions, that in all haste he put practice to bring the Devil before him, and taking his way to a thick wood near <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> called in the <HI>German</HI> tongue <HI>Spisser holt,</HI> that is in <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>Spisser</HI>'s <HI>Wood,</HI> as <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> would oftentimes boast of it a∣mong the crew, being in jollity, he came to the wood one evening into
<PB N="10" REF="028655_0008_0FDA3BB2F42526D0"/>the cross way, where he made with his wand a circle in the dust, and within that many more circles and characters; and thus past away the time till it was nine or ten of the clock at night; then began Dr. <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> to call on <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> the spir∣it, and to charge him in the name of <HI>Belzebub,</HI> to appear there presently without any longer stay; then pres∣ently the Devil began so great a ru∣mour in the in the wood, as if heav∣en and earth would have come to∣gether, and the trees with wind bow∣ed their tops to the ground; then fell the Devil to roar, as if the whole wood had been full of Lions, and suddenly about the circle run the Devil, as if a thousand waggons had be running together on paved stones: After this, at the four corners of the wood it thundered horribly, with such lightning, as if the whole world to his seeming had been on fire. <HI>Faustus</HI> all this while, half amazed at the Devil's so long tarrying, and doubting whether he were best to a∣bide any more such horrible conjur∣ings,
<PB N="11" REF="028655_0009_0FDA3BE40EBFF0A0"/>thought to leave his circle and depart; whereupon the Devil made him such musick of all sorts, as if the Nymphs themselves had been in the place: Whereat <HI>Faustus</HI> revived, and stood stoutly in his circle, expecting his purpose, and began again to con∣jure the spirit <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> in the name of the Prince of Devils, to ap∣pear in his likeness; whereat sud∣denly, over his head hung hovering in the air, a mighty dragon; then calls <HI>Faustus</HI> again after his devilish manner, at which there was a mon∣strous cry in the wood, as if hell had been open, and all the tormented souls cursing their condition. Pres∣ently not three fathom above his head, fell a flame in manner of light∣ning, and changed itself into a globe; yet <HI>Faustus</HI> feared it not, but did per∣suade himself that the Devil should give him his request before he would leave. Oftentimes after to his com∣panions he would boast that he had the stoutest head under the cope of Heaven at command. Whereat they answered. <HI>They knew none stouter than the Pope or
<PB N="12" REF="028655_0010_0FDA3BB4A1817BF0"/>Emperor.</HI> But <HI>Faustus</HI> said, <HI>The head that is my servant, is above all upon earth;</HI> and repeated certain words out of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> to make his argument good, <HI>The Prince of the World is upon Earth, and under Heav∣en.</HI> Well, let us come again to his conjuration, where we left him at the fiery globe: <HI>Faustus</HI> vexed at his spirit's so long tarrying, used his charms with full purpose not to de∣part before he had his intent, and crying on <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> the spirit, suddenly the globe opened, and sprung up in the height of a man, so burning a time, in the end it con∣verted to the shape of a fiery man. This pleasant beast ran about the cir∣cle a great while; and lastly, appear∣ed in the manner of a Grey Fryar, asking <HI>Faustus</HI> what was his request? <HI>Faustus</HI> commanded that the next morning at twelve of the clock, he should appear to him at his house; but the Devil would in no wise grant it. <HI>Faustus</HI> began to conjure him a∣gain, in the name of <HI>Belzebub,</HI> that he should fulfil his request; where∣upon
<PB N="13" REF="028655_0011_0FDA3BE51D9ECB50"/>upon the spirit agreed, and so they departed each on his way.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The conference of Dr.</HI> Faustus <HI>with his Spirit</HI> Mephostophiles, <HI>the morning following, at his own house.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Faustus,</HI> having commanded the spirit to be with him, at the hour appointed, he came and ap∣peared in his chamber, demanding of <HI>Faustus</HI> what his desire was: Then began Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> anew with him, to conjure him, that he would be o∣bedient unto him, and to answer him certain articles, to fulfill them in all points.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That the spirit should serve him, and be obedient unto him in all things that he asked of him, from that hour, until the hour of his death.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Further, any thing that he desir∣ed of him, he should bring him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Also, that in all</HI> Faustus's <HI>de∣mands and interrogations, the spirit should tell him nothing but what was true.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="028655_0012_0FDA3BB647C453B8"/>
Hereupon the spirit answered, and laid his case forth, <HI>That he had no such power of himself, until he had first given his prince (that was ruler over him) to understand thereof, and to know if he could obtain so much of his Lord: Therefore speak farther, that I may do thy whole desire to my Prince; for it is not in my power to do it with∣out his Leave.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> upon this, arose where he sat, and said, <HI>I will have my re∣quest, and yet I will not be damned.</HI> The spirit answered. <HI>Then shalt thou want thy desire, and yet art thou mine notwithstanding; if any man would detain thee, it is but in vain, for thy infidelity hath confounded thee.</HI> Here∣upon spake <HI>Faustus, Get thee hence from me, and take St.</HI> Valentine's <HI>Farewell, and</HI> Crisman <HI>with thee: yet I conjure thee, that thou be here at evening, and bethink thyself of what I have asked thee, ask thy Prince's council therein. Mephostophiles</HI> the spirit thus answered, vanished away, leaving <HI>Faustus</HI> in his study, where
<PB N="15" REF="028655_0013_0FDA3BE6DB0C2DD8"/>he sat pondering how he might ob∣tain his request of the Devil, with∣out the loss of his soul; yet he was fully resolved with himself, rather than to want his pleasure, to do what the spirit and his Lord should condition upon.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>The second time of the spirit's appear∣ing to</HI> Faustus <HI>at his house.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FAUSTUS</HI> continued in his dev∣ilish cogitations, never moving out of the place where the spirit left him, such was his fervent love to the Devil. The night approaching this swift flying Spirit appeared to <HI>Faustus,</HI> offering himself with all submission to his service, with full authority from his Prince, to do whatsoever he would request; if <HI>Faustus</HI> would promise to be his. This answer I bring thee, an answer must thou make by me again; yet I
<PB N="16" REF="028655_0014_0FDA3BB75DE34A78"/>will hear what is thy desire, because thou hast sworn to me to be here at this time. Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> gave him this answer, though faintly for his foul's sake. That his request was none other, but to become a Devil, or at least, a limb of him, and that the spirit should agree to these arti∣cles following:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That he might be a spirit in shape and quality.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That</HI> Mephostophiles <HI>should be his servant at his command.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That</HI> Mephostophiles <HI>should bring him any thing, and do for him whatsoever he desired.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That at all times he should be in the house invisible to all men, except only to himself, and at his command to shew himself.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That</HI> Mephostophiles <HI>should at all times appear at his command, and in what form or shape soever he would.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these points the spirit an∣swered Dr. <HI>Faustus, That all this should be granted him, and
<PB N="17" REF="028655_0015_0FD9BB73D204CEE8"/>fulfilled, and more, if he would a∣gree unto him upon certain ar∣ticles, as followeth:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Dr.</HI> Faustus <HI>should give himself to his Lord</HI> Lucifer, <HI>body and soul.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>For confirmation of the sames he should make him a writing in his own blood.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That he would be an enemy to all christian people.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That he would deny the christian belief.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That he let not any man change his opinion, if any man should go a∣bout to dissaude or withdraw him from it.</HI></P>
<P>Farther, the spirit promised <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> to give him certain years to live in health and pleasure, and when such years were expired, that then <HI>Faustus</HI> would be fetched away; and if he would hold these articles and conditions, that then he should have whatsoever his heart would wish or desire; and <HI>Faustus</HI> should quickly perceive himself to be a spirit in all
<PB N="18" REF="028655_0016_0FD9BB7FB750CFF8"/>manner of actions whatsoever. Hereupon Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI>'s mind was so enflamed, that he forgot his soul, and promised <HI>Nephostophiles</HI> to hold all things as he mentioned them; he thought the Devil was not so black as they used to paint him; nor Hell so hot as the people say.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>The third parley between Dr. Fau∣stus and Mephohostophiles about a Conclusien.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> had made his promise to the Devil, in the morning betimes, he called his spir∣it before him, and commanded him, that he should always come to him like a Friar, after the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and with a bell in his hand, like St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> and to ring it once or twice before he appeared, that he might know of his certain coming: Then <HI>Faustus</HI> demanded of his spir∣it, <HI>What is his name?</HI> The spirit an∣swered, <HI>my name is as thou hast said,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="028655_0017_0FDA3B9955BFC3A8"/>Mephostophiles, <HI>and I am a prince, but a servant to</HI> Lucifer.</P>
<P>After a while <HI>Faustus</HI> promised <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> to write and make his obligation with all assurance of the articles in the chapter before rehears∣ed: A pitiful case, <HI>Christian</HI> reader, for certainly this letter, or obligation was found in his house after his most lame a table end, with all the rest of his damnable practices used in his whole life.</P>
<P>Then he took a small penknife and prickt a vein in his left hand, and for certain thereupon were seen on his hand these words written in his own blood, <HI>O homo fuge?</HI> where at the spirit vanished away, but <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> continued in his damnable mind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> How Dr. Faustus set his Blood in a Sawcer, on warm Ashes, and writ as followeth:</HEAD>
<P><HI>I JOHN FAUSTUS,</HI> Doctor, do openly acknowledge with my own hand, to the great force and strength∣ening of this letter that since I began to study and speculate the course and nature of the elements, I have not found, through the gifts that is given me from above, any such learning and wisdom that bring to me my desire and for that I find that men are unable to in∣struct me any farther in the Mat∣ter; now have I, Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> to the hellish Prince of <HI>Orient,</HI> and his messenger <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> given both soul and body, upon such conditions, that they shall learn me and fulfil my desires in all things as they have prom∣ised and vowed to me with due obedience unto me, according to the articles men∣tioned between us.</P>
<P>Farther, I do covenant and agree with them, by these presents, that at
<PB N="21" REF="028655_0019_0FDA3BE9A0674DA8"/>the end of <HI>24</HI> years next ensuing the date of this present letter, they being expired, and I in the mean time, du∣ring the said years, being served of them at my will, they accomplished my desire to the full in all points as we were agreed: That then I gave them all power to do with me at their pleasure; to rule, to send, fetch or carry me or mine, be it either body, soul, flesh, blood, or goods into their habitation, he it wheresoever: And hereupon I defy God and his Christ, all the host of Heaven, and all living creatures that bear the shape of God, yea all that live: And again, I say it shall be so. And to the more strengthening of this writing, I have written it with my own hand and blood, being in perfect memory: And hereupon I subscribe to it my name, calling all the infernal, middle, and su∣preme powers to witness of this my let∣ter and subscription.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>How</HI> Mephostophiles <HI>came for his writing, and in what manner he appeared, and the sights he shewed him; and how he caused him to keep a copy of his own writing.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Faustus</HI> sitting pensive hav∣ing but only one boy with him, suddenly there appeared his spirit <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> in likeness of a very man, from whom issued most dreadful fiery flames, insomuch that the boy was afraid; but being har∣dened by his master, he bid him stand still, and he should have no haerm: The spirit began to bleat, as in a singing manner. This pretty sport pleased Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> well, but he would not call his spirit into the counting house, until he had seen more: Anon was heard a rushing of armed men, and trampling of horses: This ceasing, came a kennel of hounds, and they chased a great hart in the hall, and there the hart was slain. <HI>Faustus</HI> took heart, came
<PB N="23" REF="028655_0021_0FDA3BEB183697D8"/>forth and looked upon the hart; but presently before him there was a lion and a dragon together, fighting so fiercely, that <HI>Faustus</HI> thought they would have thrown down the house; but the dragon overcame the lion, and so they vanished. After this came a peacock and a peahen, the cock brustling of his tail, and turning to the female, beat her, and so vanished. Afterwards followed a furious bull, that with a full fierce∣ness ran upon <HI>Faustus,</HI> but coming near him vanished away. After∣ward followed a great old ape, this ape offered <HI>Faustus</HI> the hand, but he refused; so the ape ran out of the hall again. Hereupon fell a mist in the hall, that <HI>Faustus</HI> saw no light, but it lasted not; and so soon as it was gone, there lay before <HI>Faustus</HI> two great sacks, one full of gold, another of silver.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> was heard by <HI>Faustus</HI> all manner of instruments of musick, as organs, clarions, lutes, viols, cit∣terns, waits, hornpipes, flutes, anomes, harps, and all manner of
<PB N="24" REF="028655_0022_0FDA3BBC9CF1F538"/>other instruments, which so ravished his mind, that he thought he had been in another world. Hereat came <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> into the hall to <HI>Faus∣tus,</HI> apparelled like a Fryar, to whom <HI>Faustus</HI> spake, thou hast done me a wonderful pleasure in shewing me this pastime; if thou continuest as thou hast began thou shalt win my heart and soul, yea, and have it. <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> answered, <HI>This is nothing, I will please the better; give me thy hand writing.</HI> At which words the wretch put forth his hand, saying, <HI>hold thee there hast thou my promise. Mephostophiles</HI> took the writing, and willed <HI>Faustus</HI> to take a copy of it; with that the perverse <HI>Faustus</HI> being resolute in his Dam∣nation, wrote a copy thereof, and gave the devil the one, and kept in store the other. Thus the spirit and <HI>Faustus</HI> were agreed, and dwelt to∣gether, no doubt there was a virtuous house keeping.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>The manner how</HI> Faustus <HI>proceeded in his damnable life.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Faustus</HI> having given his soul to the Devil, renouncing all the powers of Heaven, confirming all his lamentable actions with his own blood, and having already dilivered his writing now into the Devil's hand, the which so puffed up his heart, that he forgot the mind of a man, and thought himself to be a spirit. Thus <HI>Faustus</HI> dwelt at his uncle's house at <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> who died and bequeathed it in his testa∣ment to his chosen <HI>Faustus. Faustus</HI> kept a boy with him that was his scholar, an unlucky wag, called <HI>Christopher Wagner,</HI> to whom this sport and Life that he saw his Master followed, seemed pleasant. <HI>Faustus</HI> loved the boy well, hoping to make him as good or better seen in his hellish exercises than himself, and he was fellow with <HI>Mephosto∣philes;</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="028655_0024_0FDA3BBE234071D0"/>otherwise <HI>Faustus</HI> had no company in his house but himself, and boy, and spirit, that ever was diligent at <HI>Faustus</HI>'s command, going about the house like a fryar, with a little bell in his hand, seen of none but <HI>Faustus.</HI> For victuals and other necessaries, <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> brought him at his pleasure from the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bravaria,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Saltzburg:</HI> And they had many times their best wine stole out of their cellers by <HI>Mephosto∣philes;</HI> likewise their provisions for their own table: Such meat as <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> wished for, his spirit brought him in. Besides that <HI>Faustus</HI> him∣self was become so cunning, that when he opened his window, what Fowl soever he wished for, it came presently flying into the house, were it never so dainty. Moreover, <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> and his boy went in sumptuous apparel, the which <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> stole from the mercers at <HI>Norenburg Aspurg, Frankfort</HI> and <HI>Lipzig,</HI> for it was hard for them to find a lock to keep out such a thief; all their
<PB N="27" REF="028655_0025_0FDA3BF1A39413F8"/>maintenance was but stolen and hor∣rowed ware: And thus they lived an odious Life in the sight of God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>How Dr.</HI> Faustus <HI>would have married.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Faustus</HI> bethinks himself of a wife, and called <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> to council. Quoth <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> to this I answer the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Thou canst not marry; for wedlock is a chief institu∣tion ordained of God and that thou hast promised to defy, as we do all.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> fell into despair with himself fearing, if he should motion matrimony any more then the Devil would tear him to pieces. <HI>For this time</HI> (quoth he to <HI>Mephostophiles) I am not minded to marry: Then dost thou well,</HI> answered his Spirit. But within two hours after, <HI>Faustus</HI> call∣ed again to his Spirit, who came again in his old manner, like a fryar. Then <HI>Faustus</HI> said unto him, <HI>I am not able to resist or bridle my fancy, I must and will have a wife, I pray
<PB N="28" REF="028655_0026_0FDA3BC0897C6BC8"/>thee give thy consent to it.</HI> Suddenly upon these words came such a whirl∣wind about the place, that <HI>Faustus</HI> though the whole house would have come down; and all the doors of the house flew off the hooks: After all this, his house was full of smoke, and the floor covered with ashes; which Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> perceiving, he would have gone up stairs, and fly∣ing up, he was taken and thrown down into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll, that he was not able to stir hand nor foot; then round about him ran a vast circle of fire, never standing still, that <HI>Faustus</HI> cryed as he lay, and thought there to have been burned. Then cryed he out to his spirit <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> for help, promising that he would live for all this, as he had vowed by his hand writing, hereupon appeared unto him an ugly Devil, so dreadful and monstrus to behold, that <HI>Faustus</HI> durst not look on him. The Devil said, <HI>what wouldest thou have</HI> Faustus? <HI>How likest thou thy wedding? What mind art thou in now? Faustus</HI> an∣swered, <HI>he had forgot his promise,

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>How Dr. Faustus dreamt that he had seen Hell.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE night following after <HI>Faustus</HI>'s communication with <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> dreamt that he had seen a part of Hell; but in what manner it was, or in what place, he knew not, whereby he was much troubled in mind, and called unto him <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> his spirit saying unto him, "I pray the re∣solve me this doubt: What is Hell? What substance is it of? In what place stands it? And when was it made?" <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> answered, <HI>Faustus,</HI> "thou shalt know, that be∣fore the fall of my lord <HI>Lucifer,</HI> there was no Hell, but even then was Hell ordained; it is no substance, but a confused thing. In this confused Hell is nought to find but a sulpher∣ish fire, or stinking mist or fog; moreover, the Devils know not how
<PB N="32" REF="028655_0030_0FDA3BC514147508"/>God hath laid the foundation of our Hell, or where it is; but to be short, <HI>Faustus,</HI> we know that Hell hath neither bottom nor end.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>How Dr. Faustus desired of his spirit, to know the secrets and pains of hell.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Faustus</HI> was pondering with∣in himself how he might get loose from so damnable an end as he had given himself unto, both soul and body; for his heart was so pos∣sessed with the Devil, that he could think of nothing else but Hell, and the pains thereof. Wherefore in all haste, he called unto him his spirit <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> desiring him some more of the secrets of Hell; what pain the damned are in; and how they were tormented? to whom <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> answered, <HI>Faustus,</HI> thou will have me tell the of the se∣crets of Hell, and of the pains there∣of: Know, <HI>Faustus,</HI> that Hell hath
<PB N="33" REF="028655_0031_0FDA3BF7A4E5C918"/>many figures, semblances, and names, but it cannot be named or signified in such sort to the living that are damned, as it is to those that are dead, and do both see and feel the torment thereof. For Hell is said to be deadly, out of which there never came any to life again but one, but he is nothing for thee to reckon upon; Hell is blood-thirsty, and is never satisfied: Hell is a vally into which the damned souls fall; for when the soul is cut of man's body, it would gladly go to the place from whence it came, and climbeth up above the highest hills, even to the Heavens, where being by the Angels of the first model denied entertain∣ment (in consideration of their evil life spent on earth) they fall into the deepest pit or valley, that hath no bottom, into a perpetual fire which shall never be quenched. Therefore is Hell called everlasting pain, in which is never hopes for mercy; so it is called utter darkness, in which we see neither the light, the sun, moon, nor stars; and were our
<PB N="34" REF="028655_0032_0FDA3BC688100A88"/>darkness like the darkness of night, yet were there hopes of mercy: But ours is perpetual darkness, elean ex∣empt from the face of God. Hell hath also a place in it called <HI>Chasina,</HI> out of which issueth all manner of thunder and lightnings, with such shriekings and wailing, that often times the very Devils themselves stand in fear thereof. For one while it send∣eth forth wind, with exceeding snow hail and rain, congealing the water into ice; with the which the damned are frozen, gnash their teeth, howl and cry, and yet cannot die.</P>
<P>Other whiles, it sendeth forth most horrible hot mists, or fogs with flashing of flames of fire and brim∣stone; wherein the sorrowful souls of the damned lie broiling in their reiterated torments; yea, <HI>Faustus</HI> Hell is called a prison, wherein the damned lie continually bound; it is called <HI>Pernicious,</HI> and <HI>Exitium,</HI> death destruction, hurtfulness mischief, a mischance, a pitiful and evil thing, world without end, and mark. Hell is the nurse of death, the heat of
<PB N="35" REF="028655_0033_0FDA3BFA26ACD930"/>of fire, the shadow of Heaven and Earth, the obligation of all goodness; the pains unspeakable, the griefs unremovable, the dwelling of the Devils, dragons, serpents, adders, toads, crocadiles, and all manner of venomous things and noisome crea∣tures; the pubble of sin, the stinking far ascending from the <HI>Stygian</HI> lake brimstone, pitch, and all manner of unclean metals; the perpetual and unquenchable fire, the end of whose miseries was never purposed by God. Yea, yea, <HI>Faustus,</HI> thou sayest I shall, I must: nay, I tell thee the secrets of our kingdom, for thou buyest it dear∣ly, and thou must and shalt be par∣taker of our torments; there shalt thou abide horable torments, how∣ling, crying, burning, freezing, melting, swiming in a labarynth of miseries, scolding, smoaking in thine eyes, stinking in thy nose, hoarseness in thy speech, deafness in thy ears, trembling in thy hands, biting thine own tongue with pain, thy heart crushed as with a press, thy bones broken, the Devils tossing
<PB N="36" REF="028655_0034_0FDA3BC7E6684298"/>firebrands unto thee; yea, thy whole carcase tossed on muck-forks from one Devil to another; yea, <HI>Faustus,</HI> then wilt thou wish for death, and he will fly from thee; thine unspeakable torments shall be every day augmented more and more, for the greater the sin the greater is the punishment; how lik∣est thou this, my <HI>Faustus?</HI></P>
<P>Lastly thou wilt have me tell thee that which only belongeth to God, which is, if it be possible for the damn∣ed to come again into the favour of God, or not: Why <HI>Faustus</HI> thou kowest that this is against thy prom∣ise; for why shouldest thou desire to know that, having already given thy soul, to the devil, to have the pleasure of the world, and to know the fecrets of Hell, therefore thou art damned, and how canst thou then come again to the favour of God? Wherefore I discreetly answer, no; for whomsoever God hath forsaken, and thrown into Hell, must there abide his wrath and indignation, in that unquenchable fire, where is no
<PB N="37" REF="028655_0035_0FDA3BFB9824F050"/>hope of mercy to be looked for, but abiding perpetual pains, world without end: Therefore my <HI>Faustus,</HI> as thou comest to Hell with these qualities, thou mayest say with <HI>Cain,</HI> my sins are greater than can be forgiven, go hang thy self like <HI>Ju∣das:</HI> And lastly, be contented to suf∣fer torments with <HI>Divas.</HI> There∣fore know, <HI>Faustus,</HI> that the damned have neither end nor time appointed, in the which they may hope to be released.</P>

The like praise he won with his kalenders and almag∣nacks making; for when he presa∣ed of any thing, operations, and alterations of the weather or ele∣ments; as wind, rain, thunder or lightnings, it fell so duly out, as if an angel had forwarned it; he set in all his works the day and hour when, where, and how it should happen. If any thing wonderful were at hand, as mortality, famine, plague, wars, &amp;c. He would set the time and place in true and just order when it should come to pass.</P>

<P>NOW <HI>Faustus</HI> falling to practise and making his prognostica∣tions, he was doubtful in many points; wherefore he called unto him his spirit, saying, I find the ground of the science very difficult to attain unto; for when I confer <HI>astronomia</HI> and <HI>astrologia,</HI> as the ma∣thematicians and ancient writers have left in memory. I find them very much to disagree; wherefore I require thee to teach me the truth of the matter. <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> an∣swered, I will teach thee the course and recourse of the planets, the cause of winter, and summer, the exaltation and declimation of the sun, and eclipse of the moon, the distance and height of the poles, and every fixed star, the nature and opposition of the elements, fire, air, water and
<PB N="40" REF="028655_0038_0FDA3BCD25D3CEB0"/>earth, and all that is contained in them; yea, there is nothing hidden from me; therefore learn now of me to make thunders, lightning, hail, snow and rain; the clouds to rend the earth, and craggy rocks to shake and split in sunder; the seas to swell and roar, and over-run their marks; knowest thou not that the deeper the sun shines, the hotter it pierces; as thy art is famous whilst thou art here, shall the greater thy name be when thou art gone. Come on my <HI>Faustus,</HI> I will make thee as perfect in these ways as myself; I will learn thee to go invisible, to find out the mines of gold and silver, the fodines of precious stones; take thy heart's de∣sire, thy time, <HI>Faustus,</HI> weareth away; then why wilt thou not take thy pleasure in the world? Come up, we will go unto kings at their own courts, and at their sump∣tuous banquets be their guests; if willingly they invite us not, then by force we will serve our turn with their best and daintiest wine.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>How Faustus fell into Despair; for having put a Question unto his spir∣it, they fell at Variance, whereupon the Rout of Devils appeared, threat∣ning him sharply.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Faustus</HI> revolving with him∣self the speaches of the spirit: <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> said he, tell me how, and after what sort, God made the world, and all the creatures in it? and why man was made after the image of God? the spirit hearing this answered, <HI>Faustus,</HI> thou know∣est that all this is in vain for thee to ask; I know thou art sorry or what thou hast done, but it availeth thee not, for I will tear thee in a thousand pieces if thou change not thy opin∣ions; and hereat he vanished away a Whereat <HI>Faustus</HI> fell to weeping and howling bitterly, because the Devil, departed from him so suddenly in
<PB N="42" REF="028655_0040_0FDA3BCFB4815C48"/>such a rage. And being in this per∣plexity, he was suddenly taken with such extreme cold, as if he would have frozen in the place where he sat; in which the greatest Devil in Hell appeared unto him, with cer∣tain of his hedious and infernal com∣pany, in the most ugly shapes, that it was possible to think upon; and traversing the chamber round about where <HI>Faustus</HI> sat, <HI>Faustus</HI> thought to himself, now they are come for me, though my time be not come, and that; because I have asked such questions of my servant <HI>Mephosto∣philes:</HI> At which cogitations the chiefest Devil, which was the lord unto whom he gave his soul, that was <HI>Lucifer,</HI> spake in this sort: Faustus, <HI>I have seen thy thoughts, which are not as thou hast vowed them unto me, by the virtues of this letter,</HI> and showing him the obligation, which he had written with his own blood; <HI>wherefore I am come to visit thee, and to show thee some of our hel∣lish pastimes, in hopes that will con∣firm thy mind a little more steadfast unto

Content</HI> (quoth <HI>Faustus) go to, let me see what pastime thou canst make,</HI> At which words, the great Devil in his likeness sat him down by <HI>Faus∣tus,</HI> commanding the rest of his De∣vils to appear in the form as they were in Hell. First entered <HI>Belial</HI> in form of a bear, with curled black hair to the ground, his ears standing upright; within, his ears were as red as blood, out of which issued flames of fire; his teeth were at least a foot long, and as white as snow, with a tail three ells long at the least, having two wings, one behind eacharm; and thus one after another, they appeared to <HI>Faustus</HI> in form as they were in Hell. <HI>Lucifer</HI> himself sat in the manner of a man all hairy, but brown coloured like a squir∣rel curled, and his tail turning up∣wards on his back as the squirrels use; I think he could crack nuts too like a squirrel. After him came <HI>Bel∣zebub</HI> in curled hair of a horseflesh colour; his head like the head of a bull, with a mighty pair of horns, and two long ears down to the
<PB N="44" REF="028655_0042_0FDA3BD27291C530"/>ground, and two wings on his back, with two pricking things like horns; out of his wings issued flames of fire, his tail was like a cow's. Then came <HI>Astoroth</HI> in form of a worm, going upright on his tail, and had no feet, but a tail like a glow-worm; under his chops grew two short hands, and his back was coal-black, his belly thick in the middle, yellow like gold, having many bristles on his back like a hedge-hog. After him came <HI>Can∣nagos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> being white and grey mix∣ed, exceeding curled and hairy; he had a head like the head of an ass, and a tail like a cat, and claws like an ox, lacking nothing of an ell broad. Then came <HI>Anobis;</HI> this Devil had a head like a dog, white and black hair, in shape like a hog, saving that he had but two feet, one under his throat, the other at his tail: he was four ells long with hanging ears like a blood-hound. After him came <HI>Dithican;</HI> he was a short thief, in form of a large bird, with shining feathers, and four feet;
<PB N="45" REF="028655_0043_0FDA3C0720833248"/>his neck was green, and his body red and his feet black. The last was call∣ed <HI>Brachus,</HI> with very short feet like a hedge-hog, yellow and green, the upper side of his body was brown, and his belly like blue flames of fire, his tail was red, like the tail of a mon∣key. The rest of the Devils were in form of unreasonable beasts; as swine, harts, bears, wolfs, apes, buffes, goats, antelopes, elephants, dragons horses, asses, lions, cats, snakes, toads, and all manner of ug∣ly serpents and worms; yet came in such sort, that every one at his en∣try into the hall, made their rever∣ence to <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and so took their places, standing in order as they came, until they had filled the whole hall, wherewith suddenly fell a most horrible thunder-clap that the house shook as if it would have fal∣len unto the ground; upon which every monster had a muck-fork in his hand, holding them towards <HI>Faustus,</HI> as though they would run a tilt at him: Which when <HI>Faustus</HI> perceived he thought upon the
<PB N="46" REF="028655_0044_0FDA3BD3D4511878"/>words of <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> when he told him how the souls in Hell were tormented, being cast from Devil to Devil upon muck-forks, he thought verily to have been tormented there by them in this fort: But <HI>Lucifer,</HI> perceiving his thought, spake to him, <HI>My</HI> Faustus, <HI>how likest thou this crew of mine?</HI> Quoth <HI>Faustus why came thou not in another manner of shape? Lucifer</HI> replied, <HI>we cannot change our hellish form, we have shew∣ed ourselves as we are there; yet can we blind men's eyes in such sort, that when we will, we appear unto them as if we were men or Aagels of light, al∣though our dwellings be in darkness.</HI> Then said <HI>Faustus I like not so many of you together.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Luci∣fer</HI> commanded them to depart, ex∣cept seven of the principle; and forthwith they presently vanished; which <HI>Faustus</HI> perceiving, he was somewhat better satisfied, and spake to <HI>Lucifer, where is my old servant.</HI> Mephostophiles? <HI>Let me see if he can do the like.</HI> Whereupon came a fierce dragon flying, and spitting
<PB N="47" REF="028655_0045_0FDA3C089DF013E8"/>fire round about the house, and com∣ing towards <HI>Lucifer,</HI> made rever∣ence, then changing himself to the form of a Fryar, saying <HI>Faustus, what wilt thou? Faustus</HI> said, <HI>I will that thou teach me to transform myself, in like sort, as thou and the rest have done.</HI> Then <HI>Lucifer</HI> put forth his paw, and gave <HI>Faustus</HI> a book, say∣ing, <HI>hold do what thou wilt,</HI> which he looked upon changed himself into a hog, then into a worm, then into a dragon; and finding this for his purpose, he liked it well.</P>

<P>THIS letter was found written with his own hand, and sent to his friend as <HI>Lipzig,</HI> a physician named <HI>Love Victori,</HI> the contents were as follows: "I give you here to understand, that being once ly∣ing
<PB N="48" REF="028655_0046_0FDA3BD95C2F6888"/>in my bed, and could not sleep for thinking on my kalender and practice, I marvelled with myself how it was possible that the firma∣ment should be known, and so largely written of by men, or whether they writ true or false, by their own opin∣ions and suppositions, or by due observation and true course of the Heavens. Behold I thought my house would have been blown down, so that all my doors and chests flew open, whereat I was not a little as∣tonished, for withal, I heard a groaning which said, get up, the desire of thy heart thou shalt see, at which I answered, what my heart desireth, that would I fain see, I will away with thee: Why then quoth he, look out at the window, there cometh a messenger for thee. That I did, and behold there stood a waggon with two dragons be∣fore it, to draw it, and all the waggon was of light burning fire, and for that the moon shone, I was the wil∣linger at that time to depart but the voice spake again, saying, sit up,
<PB N="49" REF="028655_0047_0FDA3C0A02092DE0"/>and let us away, I will, said I, go with thee, but upon consideration that I may ask after all things that I see, hear, or think on. The voice answered, I am content for this time. Hereupon I got into the waggon, so that the dragons carried me upright in to the air.</P>
<P>The waggon had four wheels, which rattled so, and made such a noise, as if it had been all this while running on the stones, and round about us flew flames of fire; and the higher I came, the more the earth seemed to be darkened, so that I thought I came out of a dungeon; and looking down from Heaven be∣hold <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> my spirit and servant was behind me, to whom I said, I pray thee, <HI>Mephostophiles</HI> whither shall I go now?

From thence he went into the isle of <HI>Britain,</HI> wherein he was greatly delighted to see the fair water and warm baths, the diverse sorts of metal, with many precious stones, and diverse other commodities, which <HI>Faustus</HI> brought thence with him. He was also at the <HI>Orcades</HI> behind <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he saw the tree that bringeth forth fruit, that when it is ripe, openeth, and falleth into water, wherein in∣gendereth
<PB N="52" REF="028655_0050_0FDBBF22310C32B8"/>a certain kind of sowl or bird: These islands are in number twenty three, but ten of them are not inhabited.

He saw in the water four mighty waters spring∣ing, one had its course towards <HI>India,</HI> the second towards <HI>Egypt,</HI> the third and fourth towards <HI>Armenia:</HI> When he saw these, he would needs know of his spirit, what waters they were, and from whence they came? his spirit gave him gently an answer,
<PB N="53" REF="028655_0051_0FDBBE9D83215C70"/>saying, It is <HI>Paradise</HI> that lies so far in the <HI>East,</HI> the garden that God himself hath planted with all manner of pleasure; and the fiery streams which thou seest, is the wall or fence of the garden: But the clear light which thou seest afar off, that is the Angel that hath the custody thereof, with a fiery sword; and although thou thinkest thyself to be hard by, thou hast yet farther thither from hence, than thou hast ever been. The water that thou seest divided into four parts, is the water that is∣sueth out of the well in the middle of <HI>Paradise.</HI> The first is called <HI>Ganges</HI> or <HI>Pison,</HI> the second <HI>Gihon</HI> the third <HI>Tygris,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Euphrates;</HI> also thou seest that he standeth under <HI>Libra</HI> and <HI>Aries,</HI> right towards the <HI>Zenith;</HI> and upon this fiery wall standeth the Angel <HI>Micha∣el,</HI> with his flaming sword, to keep the tree of life, which he hath in in charge.

<P>BUT I pray you in what kind or manner do spirits use to vex men so little by day, and so greatly by night? Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> answered, be∣cause the spirits are of God forbid∣den the light, their dwelling is in darkness, and the clearer the sun shines, the farther the spirits have
<PB N="56" REF="028655_0054_0FDBBEA6B9C8F418"/>their abiding from it; but in the night when it is dark, they have their familiarity and abiding near unto us men. For in the night we see not the sun, yet the brightness thereof so lighteth the first moving of the firmament, as it doth here on earth in the day, by which reason we are able to see the stars and planets in the night; even so the rays of the sun piercing up in the firmament, the spirits abandon the place, and so come near us on Earth, the dark∣ness filling our heads with heavy dreams and strong fancies, with shrieking and crying in many de∣formed shapes. And sometimes when men go forth without light, there falleth to them a fear, that their hair standeth up an end; so many start in their sleep, thinking there is a spirit by them, groping or feeling for him, going round about the house in their sleep, and many such like fancies; and all this is, because in the night the spirits are more familiarly by us, then we are desirous of their company, and so
<PB N="57" REF="028655_0055_0FDBBEA8BB1E9CF0"/>they carry us, blinding us, and plaguing us more than we are able to perceive.</P>

<P>IN the month of <HI>August,</HI> there was over <HI>Wittingburg</HI> a mighty great lightning and thunder; and as Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> was jesting merrily in the market-place with certain of his friends and companions, being phy∣sicians, desired him to tell them the cause of that weather: <HI>Faustus</HI> an∣swered, it hath been commonly seen heretofore that before a thunder-clap fell a shower of rain, or a gale of wind, commonly after a wind fal∣leth rain, and after rain a thunder-clap; such thickness comes to pass when the four winds meet together in the Heavens, the airy clouds are by force beaten against the fixed chrystal firmament, they are con∣gealed, and so strike, and rush
<PB N="58" REF="028655_0056_0FDBBEAEA9447FB8"/>against the firmament, as great piec∣es of ice, when they meet on the water: Then each other soundeth in our ears, and that we call thun∣der, which indeed was none other than you have heard.</P>

<P>THE Emperor <HI>Charles,</HI> the fifth of the name was personally, with the rest of his nobles and gen∣tlemen, at the town of <HI>Zutzbruck,</HI> where he kept his court, unto the which also Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> resorted and being there well known of divers nobles and gentlemen, he was invit∣ed into the court to meet even in the presence of the emperor, whom when the emperor saw, he looked earnestly upon him, thinking by his look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was some wonderful fel∣low▪ Wherefore he asked one of his
<PB N="59" REF="028655_0057_0FDBBEB1A3D11528"/>nobles whom he should be? He an∣swered that he was called Dr. <HI>Faus∣tus:</HI> Then said the emperor, <HI>Faustus,</HI> my hearty desire is, that thou would∣est vouchsafe to let me see that <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> and his paramour, the which was praised to be so fair; and I pray thee shew me them in such sort as that I may see their personage, shape, gesture and apparel, and that here before my face, to that end that I may say, I have had my long de∣sire fulfilled, and to praise thee to be a famous man in the art and expe∣rience. Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> answered, my most excellent lord, I am ready to accomplish your request in all things, so far forth as I and my spirit are able to perform; yet your majesty shall know, that their dead bodies are not able fubstantially to be brought before you; but such spirits as have seen <HI>Alexander</HI> and his paramour alive, shall appear unto you in manner and form as they both lived in their most flour∣ishing time; and herewith I hope to please your imperial majesty.
<PB N="60" REF="028655_0058_0FDBBEB4C21A77A8"/>Then <HI>Faustus</HI> went a little aside and spoke unto his spirit, but he returned again presently, saying, now if it please your majesty you shall see them; yet upon this condition, that you demand no question of them, nor speak unto them, which the emperor agreed unto. Whereupon Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> opened the privy-cham∣ber door, where presently entered the great and mighty emperor <HI>Alex∣ander Magnus,</HI> in all things to look upon as if he had been alive; in proportion, a strong set thick man, of a middle stature, black hair, and that both thick and curled, head and beard, red cheeks, and a broad face, with eyes like a <HI>Basilisk;</HI> he had a complete harness, furbished and engraven, exceedingly rich to look upon, and so passing towards the emperor, <HI>Carolus</HI> would have stood up to receive and greet him with the like reverence: But <HI>Faustus</HI> took hold on him, and would not permit him to do it.

<P>IT is a common proverb in <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> that although a conjurer have all things at command, the day will come that he shall not be worth a penny; so it is like to fall out with Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> in promising the Devil so largely; but as the Devil is the
<PB N="64" REF="028655_0062_0FDBBEC4B16A5078"/>author of all lies, even so he led <HI>Faustus</HI>'s mind in practising things to deceive the people, and binding them, wherein he took his whole delight, thereby to bring himself to riches; notwithstanding in the end, he was never the richer; and al∣though during 24 years of his time that the Devil set him he wanted nothing; yet he was best pleased when he might deceive any body. For out of the mightiest potentates' courts in those countries, he would send his spirit to fetch away their best cheer. And on a time being in his merriment, and banquetting with other students in an inn there∣unto resorted many <HI>Jews;</HI> which when Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> perceived, he was minded to play a merry jest to de∣ceive a <HI>Jew,</HI> desiring one of them to lend him some money for a time; the <HI>Jew</HI> was content, and lent <HI>Faus∣tus</HI> threescore dollars for a month, which time being expired, the <HI>Jew</HI> came for his money and interest; but <HI>Faustus</HI> was never minded to pay the <HI>Jew</HI> again; at length the <HI>Jew</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="028655_0063_0FDBBEC83B69EE30"/>coming home to his house, and ask∣ing for his money, Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> made him this answer; <HI>Jew,</HI> I have no money, nor know I how to pay thee; but to the end thou mayest be contented, I will cut off a limb of my body, be it arm or leg, and the same thou shalt have in pawn for thy money; yet with this condition, that when I pay thee thy money then thou shalt give me my limb. The <HI>Jew</HI> that never was a friend to a <HI>Christian,</HI> thought with himself, this fellow is right for my purpose, that will lay his limbs in pawn for money, and was therewith very well content: Wherefore Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> took a saw, and therewith seemed to cut of his leg, but not withstand∣ing he did not so. Well, he gave it to the <HI>Jew.</HI> The <HI>Jew</HI> took his leg, and departed; and having far home, he was some what weary, and by the way he thus bethought himself; what availeth me a knave's leg? If I should carry it home, it would stink, and infect my house; besides, it is a hard piece of work to set it on
<PB N="66" REF="028655_0064_0FDBBECC37871A68"/>again; wherefore what an ass was <HI>Faustus</HI> to lay so great a pawn for so small a sum of money? And for my part, (quoth the <HI>Jew</HI> to himself) this will never profit me any thing; and with these words, he threw the leg into a ditch. All this <HI>Faustus</HI> knew right well, therefore within three days after, he sent for the <HI>Jew</HI> to make him payment of his sixty dollars: The <HI>Jew</HI> came and <HI>Faustus</HI> demanded his pawn, there was his money ready for him. The <HI>Jew</HI> answered, the pawn was not profit∣able nor necessary for any thing, so I threw it away: But <HI>Faustus</HI> threat∣ening, replied, I will have my leg again, or one of thine for it. The <HI>Jew</HI> promised to give him what mo∣ney he would ask, if he would not deal strictly with him; wherefore the <HI>Jew</HI> was forced to give him sixty dollars more to be rid of him, and yet <HI>Faustus</HI> had his leg on, for he had but blinded the <HI>Jew.</HI></P>

They all said willingly, we will, which when Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> heard, he took them forth, set each of them upon a holly wand, and so was conjured into the Bishop of <HI>Saltsburg</HI>'s cellar, for thereabouts grew excellent pleas∣ant

In fine, all manner of musick was heard there in that instant, whereat all the glasses and goblets, cups and pots that stood upon the board, began to dance; then Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> took ten stone pots, and set them down on the floor, where pre∣sently they began to dance, and to mite one against another, that the
<PB N="77" REF="028655_0075_0FDBBEE8854C81A0"/>shivers flew round about the house, at which the whole company fell a laughing: Then began the other jest; he set an instument upon the table, and caused a mighty great ape to come against them, which ape began to dance and skip, shewing them merry conceits. In this and such pastime, they passed away the whole day; when night being come, Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> bid them all to supper, which they agreed to; for students in these cases are easily intreated; where he prom∣ised to treat them with a banquet of fowl, and afterwards they would go all about with a mask. Then Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> put forth a long pole out of the window, whereupon presently came innumerable birds and wild fowl, and so many as came, had not power to fly away again; but he took them, and flung them to the students, who lightly pulled of the necks of them, and being roasted, then made their supper; which being ended, they made themselves ready for the mask. Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> com∣manded every one to put on a clean
<PB N="78" REF="028655_0076_0FDBBEEB80825F00"/>shirt over their clothes; which being done they looked upon one another; it seemed to each one of them, that they had no heads; and so they went forth unto certain of their neigh∣bours, at which sight the people were most wonderfully frighted; and as the custom of <HI>Germany</HI> is, that wheresoever a mask entereth, the good man of the house must feast them: So as these masks were set to their banquet, they seemed again in their former shape, with their heads, insomuch, that they were all known who they were; and having sat, and well eat and drank, Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> made that every one had an ass's head on, with great and long ears, so they fell to dancing, and to drive away the time, untill it was mid∣night, and then every one departed home; and as soon as they were out of the house, each one was in his natural shape, and so they ended, and went to sleep.</P>

Yet no man saw <HI>Faustus</HI> to cut the lilly; but when the rest of Jugglers thought to have set on their master's head, they could not; wherefore they looked on the lilly, and found it bleeding; by this means the Juggler was beguiled, and so died in his wickedness. Yet no one thought that Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> had done it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. <HI>How Dr.</HI> Faustus <HI>made a Marriage between two Lovers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the city of <HI>Wittenburg</HI> was a student, a gallant gentleman nam∣ed <HI>N. N.</HI> This gentleman was far in love with a gentlewoman, sair and proper in personage; this gentlewo∣man had a Knight that was a suitor unto her, and many other gentlemen, which desired her in marriage, but none could obtain her. So it was that he fell in despair with himself, and pined away to skin and bone: But when he opened the matter to Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> he asked counsel of his <HI>Mephostophiles,</HI> the which told him what to do. Hereupon Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> went home to the gentleman, and bid him be of good chear, for he should have his desire, for he would help him to that he wished for, and that this gentlewoman should love none other but him only. Where∣fore
<PB N="86" REF="028655_0084_0FDBBF06C52E9578"/>Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> so changed the mind of the damsel by the practice he wrought, that she could do no other thing but think on him, whom before she had hated, neither cared she for any man but him alone. The device was thus; <HI>Faustus</HI> com∣manded the gentleman that he should clothe himself in all the best apparel that he had, and that he should go unto the gentlewoman, and shew himself, giving him a ring, com∣manding him in any wise that he should dance with her before he de∣parted; who following his counsel, went to her, and when they began to dance, they that were suitors, began to take every one his lady by the hand; this gentleman took her who before had so disdained him, and in the dance he put the ring into her hand, that <HI>Faustus</HI> had given him, which she no sooner toucht, but she fell presently in love with him, smiling at him in the dance, and many times winking at him, rolling her eyes, and in the end she asked him if he could love her, and
<PB N="87" REF="028655_0085_0FDBBF0A3949F078"/>make her his wife. He gladly an∣swered that he was content; where∣upon they concluded, and were married by the means and help of <HI>Faustus,</HI> for which the gentleman well rewarded him.</P>

<PB N="88" REF="028655_0086_0FDBBF0C89B6DCB8"/>wondered to see that this garden should flourish at that time, as in the midst of the summer, when abroad the streets, and all the coun∣try lay full of snow and ice; where∣fore this was noted by them as a thing miraculous, every one gather∣ing and carrying away all such things as they liked, and so departed, delighted with their sweet smelling flowers, making good the words of the poet:

<P>DR. <HI>Faustus</HI> travelled towards <HI>Ev∣zeleben,</HI> and when he was nigh half the way, he espied seven horse∣men,
<PB N="89" REF="028655_0087_0FDBBF1075227678"/>and the chief of them he knew to be the Knight with whom he had jested in the Emperor's court, for he had set a great pair of hart's horns upon his head; and when the Knight now saw fit opportunity to be revenged of <HI>Faustus,</HI> he and those that were with him, ran upon him to mischief him, intending privily to slay him; which when <HI>Faustus</HI> espied, he vanished away into a wood that was hard by them; but when the Knight perceived that he was vanished away, he caused his men to stand still; but where they remained, they heard all manner of warlike instruments of musick, as drums, flutes, trumpets, and such like; and a certain troop of horsemen rushing towards them; then they turned another way, and were also met on that side; then another way, and yet were freshly assaulted; so that which way soever they turned themselves, they were encountered, insomuch that when the Knight per∣ceived that he could escape no way, but that his enemies lay on him
<PB N="90" REF="028655_0088_0FDBBF12864E3A30"/>which way soever he offered to fly, he took good heart and ran amongst the thickest and thought with him∣self it was better to die than to live with so great infamy: Therefore being at handy blows with them, he demanded the cause, why they should so use them? But none of them would give him answer, until Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> shewed himself unto the knight; whereupon they enclosed him round, and Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> said un∣to him, Sir, yield your weapon and yourself, otherwise it will go hard with you. The knight know∣ing no other, but that he was con∣jured with a host of men, whereas indeed they were none other but dev∣ils, yielded: Then <HI>Faustus</HI> took a∣way his sword, his piece and horse, with all the rest of his company. And farther, he said unto him, Sir, the chiefest general of our army hath commanded me to deal with you according to the law of arms, you shall depart in peace; and then he gave the Knight a horse after the manner, and set him thereon; so
<PB N="91" REF="028655_0089_0FDBBF1404EBF6C8"/>he rode, the rest went on foot, until they came unto their inn, where he being alighted, his page rode on the horse to the water, and presently the horse vanished away, the page being almost sunk and drowned; but he escaped, and coming home, the Knight perceived the page to be be∣mired and on foot, asked where his horse was? Who answered, that he was vanished away; which when the Knight heard, he said, of a truth this is <HI>Faustus</HI>'s doing, for he served me now, as he did before at the court, only to make me a scorn and laughing stock.</P>

<P>MY trusty and well beloved friends, the cause why I have

And to the end I might the better bring my purpose to pass, to have the Devil's aid and furtherance, which I never have wanted in my actions, I have promised him at the end and accomplishment of twenty four years, both body and soul, to do therewith at his pleasure; this dis∣mal day, these twentyfour years are fully expired; for night beginning, my hourglass is at an end, and the

<PB N="111" REF="028655_0109_0FDA3CCEDEB0AC98"/>hereafter you find my dead carcase, convey it into the earth, for I die both a good and bad <HI>Christian;</HI> though I know the Devil will have thy body, and that would I willing∣ly give him, so that he would leave my soul to quiet; wherefore I pray you, that you would depart to bed, and so I with you a quiet night, which unto me, notwithstanding, shall be horrible and fearful.</P>
<P>This oration was made by <HI>Faustus,</HI> and that with a hearty and resolute mind, to the end he might not dis∣comfort them; but the students wondered greatly thereat, that he was so blinded, for knavery, conju∣ration, and such foolish things, to give his body and soul to the Devil; for they loved him entirely, and never suspected any such thing, be∣fore he had opened his mind to them: wherefore one of them said unto him, ah! Friend <HI>Faustus,</HI> what have you done to conceal this matter so long from us? We would by the help of good divines, and the grace of God, have brought you out of the
<PB N="112" REF="028655_0110_0FDA3C97DD44FB20"/>net, and have torn you out of the bondage and chains of satan, whereas we fear now it is too late to the utter ruin both of body and soul. Dr. <HI>Fau∣stus</HI> answered, I durst never do it al∣though often minded to settle myself to godly people to desire counsel and help, and once my old neighbour counfeled me, that I should follow his learning, and leave all my con∣jurations: Yet when I was minded to amend, and to follow that good counsel, then came the Devil and would have had me a way, as this night he is like to do; and said, so soon as I turned again to God, he would dispatch me altogether. Thus even thus, (good gentlemen and dear friends) was I inthralled in that fatal bond, all good desires drowned, all piety vanished, all purpose of amendment utterly exiled, by the tyrannous oppression of my deadly enemy. But when the students heard his words they gave him counsel to do nothing else but call upon God, desiring him, for the love of his sweet son Jesus Christ's
<PB N="113" REF="028655_0111_0FDA3CD0953B8C00"/>sake to have mercy upon him: Teaching him this form of prayer: O God! Be merciful unto me, poor and miserable sinner; and en∣ter not into judgment with me, for no flesh is able to stand before thee! although, O Lord! I must leave my sinful body with the Devil, being by him deluded; yet thou in mercy may preserve my soul.</P>
<P>This they repeated to him, yet he could take no hold: But even as <HI>Cain,</HI> he also said, That his sins were greater than God was able to for∣give. For all his thoughts was on the Writing, he meant he had made it too pithy in writing it with his own Blood. The Students and the others that were there, when they had pray∣ed for him, they wept, and so went forth; but <HI>Faustus</HI> tarried in the hall, and when the gentlemen were laid in bed, none of them could sleep, for that they attended to hear if they might be privy to his End. It hap∣pened that between twelve and one o'clock at midnight, there blew a mighty storm of wind against the House, as though it would have
<PB N="114" REF="028655_0112_0FDA3C9B010F60A8"/>blown the foundation thereof out of its Place. Hereupon the Students began to fear, and go out of their beds, but they would not stir out of the chamber, and the host of the house ran out of doors, thinking the house would fall. The Students lay near unto the hall, wherein Dr. <HI>Fau∣stus</HI> lay, and they heard a mighty noise and hissing, as if the hall had been full of snakes and adders, with that the hall doors flew open, where∣in Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> was, then he began to cry for help, saying, murther! much ther! but it was with half a voice, and very hollow, shortly after they heard him no more: But when it was day, the Students that had tak∣en no rest that night, arose and went into the hall, in which they left Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> where notwithstanding they found not <HI>Faustus,</HI> but all the hall sprinkled with blood, the brains cleaving to the wall, for the devil had beaten him from one wall against another: in one corner lay his eyes, in another his teeth; a fearful and pitiful Sight to behold. Thon began the Stu∣dents
<PB N="115" REF="028655_0113_0FDA3C8BD2503B80"/>to wail and weep for him, and sought for his body in many places; lastly, they came into the yard, where they saw his body lying on the horse-dung, most monstrously torn, and fearful to behold; for his head and all his joints were dashed to pieces. The forenamed Students and Masters that were at his death, have obtained so much, that they buried him in the village where he was so grievously tormented. After which they returned to <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> and coming into the house of <HI>Faustus,</HI> they found the servant of <HI>Faustus</HI> very sad, unto whom they opened all the matter, who took it exceed∣ing heavily. There they found this history of Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> noted, and of him written, as is before declared; all save only his end, the which was after, by the Students, thereunto an∣nexed. Farther what his servant noted thereof, was made in another book. And you have heard held by him in his life the spirit of fair <HI>Hele∣na,</HI> who had by him one son, the which was named <HI>Justus Faustus,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="028655_0114_0FDA3C9CD5813FC0"/>even the same day of his death they vanished away, both mother and son. The house before was so dark, that scarce any body could abide therein. The same night Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> appeared to his servant lively, and shewed un∣to him many secret things which he had done, and hidden in his life-time. Likewise there were certain which saw Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> look out of the win∣dow by night, as they passed by the house.</P>
<P>And thus ended the whole history of Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI>'s conjuration, and other acts that he did in his life; out of which example every christian may learn; but chiefly the stiffnecked, and highminded, may thereby learn to fear God, and to be careful of their vocation, and to be at defiance with all devilish works, that God hath most precifely forbidden; to the end we should not invite the Dev∣il as a guest, nor give him place as that wicked <HI>Faustus</HI> hath done: For here we have a wicked example of his writing, promise, and end, that we may remember him, that we go
<PB N="117" REF="028655_0115_0FDA3CD60B519928"/>not astray, but take God always be∣fore our eyes, to call alone upon him, and to honour him all the days of our life, with heart, and hearty prayer, and with all our strength and soul, to glorify his holy name, defy∣ing the devil and all his works; to the end we may remain with Christ in all endless joy, <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI> That wish I to every christian heart, and God's name be glorified.</P>

<HEAD>A Conjuring Tale.</HEAD>
<P>AT such time when Perukes were as scarce as money is now amongst most men a gentleman who had lost his hair by a fit of sickness, was forced with the first to make use of one of them. It happened that he and his boy that attended on him, riding down into the country, there fell such a shower of rain, which continued so long as obliged them to take up their lodging at a paltry alehouse in a country village, where seeing the weather prove so bad, he was resolved to lie there for that night: After some short can∣mons, which went by the name of a supper, the gentleman was con∣ducted to his lodging chamber, which was hung with cobwebs in∣stead of cloath of Arras; his boy also was shewn to another chamber,
<PB N="131" REF="028655_0129_0FDA3CE80E236280"/>something inferiour you may be sure to that of his master's; which was also richly hung with spiders tapestry, whilst the gentleman was making himself ready, the maid peeped in at a hole under the door (which was made for the cat to go out and in) that when he was abed she might fetch away the candle. Hav∣ing undressed himself, he pulls off his Peruke, and sets it upon a stool by him, which the maid perceiving, verily imagined that he had pulled off his head; and so conceited she was of it, that she ran down to her dame, telling him, that the gentleman who lodged there, was no other than an arrant conjurer, for she saw him with her own eyes pull off his head, and set it on a stool by him; and if she doubted any thing of the truth thereof, if she would go up, she might see it standing there at that present. Her dame, though something hard of belief of what she heard, yet to satisfy her maid's curi∣osity, went up; where peeping like∣wise in at the hole, and seeing it upon the stool, she was then of the same
<PB N="132" REF="028655_0130_0FDA3CB06A8DA188"/>opinion with her maid; and so fear∣ful they were both thereof, that nei∣ther of them durst fetch the candle, and the gentleman was forced to put it out himself. That night was spent in a great deal of fear, they judging that bad weather to proceed from the conjurer, and expecting yet worse; but when in the morning they saw all fair, and a serene sky, they changed their opinion, and that tho' he was a conjurer, yet that now he would do no more harm. Whilst they were now entered into this good opinion of him, one of her neigh∣bours came in who had lost a horse, whom he judged to be stole, for which he made a great complaint. Hold your peace, said she, I can tell you a way which I warrant you will fetch your horse again: we have a conjurer that is now lodged in our house, who for half a dozen of beer, I question not but will do your busi∣ness: and therewithal she went up to the gentleman, acquainting him with her neighbour's loss, and desir∣ing his assistance for gaining him
<PB N="133" REF="028655_0131_0FDA3CB2605AF198"/>again; for, said she, I know you have skill in the black art, my maid and I seeing your head last night up∣on the stool, when as the rest of your body was gone to bed. The gentle∣man perceiving her folly in her grand mistake, and willing to have some mirth after his wet journey, told her, that for her sake he would do his best endeavour for her neigh∣bour; and that when he was ready, he would raise a spirit which would quickly tell him where the horse was. The woman overjoyed at these words ran down and told her neigh∣bour that he would have his horse again within an hour, and that if he would stay so long, he should see him come galloping to him again in a full career; this news pleased him so well, that he resolved to stay. In the mean time the gentleman was consulting with himself how to bring his purpose the best way to effect: In order thereto, he told his boy that he must act the part of a dev∣il; and to personate him the better, whilst I am gone down to speak with them about the business do
<PB N="134" REF="028655_0132_0FDA3CB667C2D158"/>you turn your coat the wrong side outwards, and creep under the bed where you must lie till I speak these words, <HI>Elhavareuna, Phonsonthon∣chya, Heydonicus Towronus Dunge∣onis Keptoribus;</HI> then do you come forth from under the bed, and make as hideous a noise with your mouth as you can possible. The boy prom∣ised to do as he bid him; and when his master was gone down, he went about his business; but remembering with himself, that in the chamber where he lodged, there lay a raw bulls hide, left there by some butcher he thought that would personate the Devil far better than his coat; and thereupon he sudenly fetched it, and wrapped himself therein, with the horns apearing just over his head; which having done, he crept under the bed, expecting the event: Soon after he was fixed, came up his master, the dame, the maid, and the fellow that had lost his horse; when the gentleman having a chalk∣stone in his hand, marked them every one out a circle; then placing them therein, he bid them not to stir
<PB N="135" REF="028655_0133_0FDA3CEA1C15BA50"/>out of them, whatever they saw: So pulling a book out of his pocket, he began to read some hard uncouth names, and at last came to those words, <HI>Elhavareuna,</HI> &amp;c. when the boy made his appearance from under the bed, with a great pair of horns and a bellowing noise: His master, who knew not of his boy's new in∣vention for acting the devil, seeing such a hideous thing to appear, thought it had been the devil indeed who had come to have punished him for undertaking to conjure, and thereupon he ran as fast as he could drive, making but one step from the top of the stairs to the bottom: The woman and the man seeing the gentleman run, thought likewise the devil was come to fetch them for being spectators, and there∣upon ran as fast as he, tumbling down the stairs on the neck of one another. The boy seeing them all run in such disorder, thought also that the devil was indeed come for him for acting his part, and there∣fore he began to throw off his cov∣ering; but he had before so fastened
<PB N="136" REF="028655_0134_0FDA3CB7DC96EC88"/>it upon him, that seeing he could not pull it off, he ran with it on; when coming to the top of the stairs, the hide so wrapped about his legs that it threw him from the top to the bottom amongst them; when they hearing the horns to make a clattering, so shrieked and bellowed as if the devil had been amongst them indeed. Sad was the effects of this their conjuring: One had his nose broke, another his shins, some hurt their elbows, some their thighs, and others their backs, the gentleman lost his Peruke, the wom∣en fell with their heels upwards; and to conclude, not any one of them sped so well, but he had more occa∣sion for a surgeon than a conjurer.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>This was a merry Devil play'd this prank,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Altho' his master gave him little thank:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Well may we judge the times must needs be evil,</HI></L>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Jesuit <HI>and</HI> Friar.</HEAD>
<P>A Jesuit preaching at the great church in <HI>Padua,</HI> towards the end of his sermon, fell into a large
<PB N="137" REF="028655_0135_0FDA3CEBE1600D58"/>commendation of the order of the Jesuits, extolling it above all, the religous orders that then were, or ever had been in the world, giving God thanks, that he had the happi∣ness to be of that order, and in the close of his discourse, he told his au∣ditory that he would acquaint them with a vision which he had lately seen. The other night, said he, I dreamed that I was in hell, where methought I saw Popes, Emperors, Kings, Queens, Cardinals, Bishops, Abbots, Monks, Friars, and some of all sorts of men, both ecclesiastical and secular, but not one Jesuit amongst them all; which made me to bless God that ever I was born to be of so blessed a society, which though it had sent so many thousands of that holy order to the grave, yet never any of them went to hell; and so he concluded his sermon with a fresh encomium on the society of Jesuits. The next <HI>funday</HI> after, a dommican fryar preached in the same church, and he also, towards the end of his sermon, fell upon the high praises of the order of the Je∣suits;
<PB N="138" REF="028655_0136_0FDA3CBACA6E22B0"/>repeating much of the Jesuit's sermon the day before, and bewail∣ing himself that it was not his for∣tune to be of that holy order, where∣of none ever went to Hell, as the reverend father had told them the day before; at last he told the people, that he had also seen a vision, and dreamed likewise one night that he was in Hell, where he saw popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and all sorts of orders, as the Jesuit had not∣ably shewed them the day before; but not a Jesuit (said thefryar) could be seen among them all. Then thought I to myself, O what a blessed order is this, that there should not be a Jesuit there! and still I cast my eyes all over hell, wishing myself had been a Jesuit and not a dominican, to see not one piece of that order there. At last methought I beckoned a little Devil to me, and asked him softly in his ear, whether there were any Jesuits in that place or not? He answered, that there were none there, but that they were kept in a Hell by themselves, which is a great room under this,
<PB N="139" REF="028655_0137_0FDA3CEFACB34C60"/>where (said the Devil,) there be abundance of them; and they come hither so fast, that my master <HI>Lu∣cifer</HI> scarce knows where to bestow them; and besides they are so un∣ruly that if they were not kept by themselves, every body would be soon weary of this place: Adding withal, that his master durst not let them have any gunpowder, for fear they should blow up Hell itself.</P>

<HEAD>No Wit like a Woman's</HEAD>
<P><HI>ACARPENTER</HI> had married a very handsome woman to his wife, but that she wearing corkshoes, it made her light heel'd. This <HI>car∣penter</HI> used to work about a mile from home: but for the love he bore to his wife, he would every night come back to bed with her, although it seemed, she had rather have had his Room than his Com∣pany; for no sooner was he gone, but his Place was supplied by anoth∣er, whom she loved more dearly; his next Neighbour, who by Trade was a <HI>Grocer.</HI> It happened one Morn∣ing,
<PB N="140" REF="028655_0138_0FDA3CBBB4C0BED8"/>that the <HI>carpenter</HI> went for that he was accustomed; but before his Place was cold, another was gotten therein. He had not gone a Quarter of a Mile, but there fell such a Show∣er of Rain, with Likelihood of Con∣tinuance, that he returned back again, and drawing the Latch, went into the house; which the <HI>Grocer</HI> hear∣ing, crept out of Bed and got under∣neath it as fast as he could. It being not yet Day, the Carpenter pulled off his clothes and went to bed; where he had not lain above a quar∣ter of an hour, but it ceased raining, gave great hopes of a fair day; which the good wife perceiving seared her lover would catch cold by being without his clothes under∣neath the bed, she jogged her hus∣band, telling him now the sky was very clear, and therefore desired him to rise and go to work. The <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who was very observant to his wife, did accordingly; but it became so dark that he could not see, he mistook, and put on the <HI>Grocer</HI>'s breeches instead of his own; and so go∣ing his journey, when putting his hands
<PB N="141" REF="028655_0139_0FDA3CF312D05860"/>in his pocket to pull out his com∣passes, he found there a handful of money, at which he much marvel∣led, knowing not how it should come there; only he thought it was no bad luck to have his pockets so lined; yet was he in a quandary whether he was a wake or in a dream, he being seldom master of such a purchase. Putting his hand in his other pocket, he found there a bunch of keys, a note book, and some other papers; which increased his wonder more then before: But look∣ing down towards his legs, he saw the breeches were all full of ribbands, whereas his own never had one on them. Not knowing what to think thereof, he resolved to go home and confer with his wife. In the mean time the <HI>Grocer</HI> missed his breeches, and telling the good wife thereof, they knew not what to do, only she thought it was his best way not to stay, judging her husband had got∣ten them on, which might occasion his sudden return. And indeed her suspicion proved true; but the hus∣band returned home, where he
<PB N="142" REF="028655_0140_0FDA3CC0DE72CCC0"/>found his wife weeping and wali∣ing, and taking on most bitterly: He asked her the reason thereof; O! said she, the <HI>Grocer</HI> at the next door fast night brought a pair of breech∣es heither for me to mend for him, and I being willing to earn a penny, and not always to rely upon your gettings took the business upon me; since which time, I know not how, some body hath come in and stolen them away? but if I knew the cuck∣oldly rogue that had them, I would have him hanged if it were possible. Then casting her eyes fully upon him, O lack! Husband, said she, I see you have gotten them on: only I was afraid they had been lost; but herein I will have more care of such things as long as I live. The hus∣band hereupon pulled them off, and gave them to his wife; but withal told her, that he had rather allow her twopence out of his day's wa∣ges, then that she should earn a penny in such sort.</P>
