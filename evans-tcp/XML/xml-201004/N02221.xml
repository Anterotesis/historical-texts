<P>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that the Royal Charter granted to our late Proprietary <HI>William Penn,</HI> under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Fundamental Constitution of our Legislative Authority, by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the late King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the second, in a very gracious and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, was pleased to signify his Royal Will and Pleasure in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <Q><HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> we,</HI> repo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng special Trust and Confidence in the Fidelity, Wisdom, Justice and provident Circumspection of the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> for Us, Our H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs and Successors, <HI>Do Grant</HI> free, full and absolute Power by Virtue of these presents, to him and his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs, to his and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Deputies and Lieutenants, for the good and happy Government of the said Country, to Ordain, Make and Enact, and, under his and their Seals, to publish any Laws whatsoever, for the raising of Money for the Publick uses of the said Province, or for any other End, appertaining either unto the publick State, Peace or Safety of the said Country, or unto the private Utility of particular Persons, according unto their best Discretion, <HI>By and with</HI> the Advice, Assent and Approbation of the Free-men of the said Country, or the greater part of them, or of their Delegates or Deputies, <HI>Whom,</HI> for the Enacting of the said Laws, when and as often as need shall require, We will, That the said <HI>William Penn</HI> and his Heirs shall Assemble in such sort and form as to him and them shall seem best.</Q></P>
<P>By Virtue of this Clause the Proprietor had Power to make Deputies and Lieutenants, in which Case (as it is in all other Cases where a Deputy may be appointed) the Law says, he has full Power to do any act or thing which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Principal may do: And that is so essentially incident to a Deputy, that a Man cannot be a Deputy to do any single act or thing, nor can a Deputy have less Power than his Principal, and if his Principal make him <HI>Covenant, That he will not do any particular thing which the Principal may do,</HI> the Covenant is void and repugnant; as if the Under-Sheriff Covenant, that he will not Execute any process for more than <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> without special Warrant from the High-Sheriff; this is void, because the Under-Sheriff is his Deputy, and the Power of the Deputy cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be less than that of his Principal, save only that he cannot make a Deputy, because it implies an Assignment of his whole Power, all which was adjudged by the Court of King's Bench, the 13 <HI>William</HI> 3. in the Case of <HI>Parker</HI> and <HI>Kett,</HI> where the Debate arose concerning the Steward of a Mannor-Court.</P>
<P>The Case of the Under-Sheriff here cited by <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> is reported by the late Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hobart</HI> thus, <HI>viz.</HI> If a Sheriff will make an Under-Sheriff, <HI>Provided</HI> that he shall not serve Executions above 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> without his special Warrant, this <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will be void: For, tho' he may chuse whether he makes an Under-Sheriff at all, or may make him at his will, and so remove wholly, yet he cannot leave him an Under-Sheriff, and yet abridge his Power, <HI>no more than the King may in Case of the Sheriff himself:</HI> But it was said, that the Case here was not so, that the restraint of Executions above 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> grew not on the part of the Sheriff, but on the part of the Under-Sheriff by his Covenant, which might stand for good, notwithstanding the repugnancy to his Office; but the Covenant here was holden void, as being against <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Justice.</HI> For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by being made Under-Sheriff, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Law to Execute all Proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he could, no more than the the Sheriff himself, Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Execute Process without another's special Warrant, for that is to <HI>deny or delay Justice.</HI></P>
<P>This last Case was that which Governed the opinion of the Council (when Judge <HI>Mem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n</HI> assisted) to declare that part of Col. <HI>Evan</HI>'s Commission void, which reserved to the Proprietor the final Assent to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he passed into Laws in this Province. There∣fore, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how <HI>James Logan</HI> (being not only present at those Debates, but other drew up or copy'd and signed that solemn Resolution of the Council, and knows how it was approved of by the Assembly at the same time) can so strenuously insist upon the Restric∣tion now in Debate, which is as much against Law and Justice as the Instances in the above quoted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could be.</P>
<P>The next thing observable in the above recited Clause of the Royal Charter, is the Right and Power of Legislation, granted to the Proprietor and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to his and their
<PB N="2" REF="002649_0002_0FE5DA9DA67788C0"/>Deputies and Lieutenants, by and with the Assent of the Free-men of this Provice; which being expressed as amply as any Liberty or Privilege of that kind can be granted, I am induced to conclude, that, by Virtue of this Grant, there was such a Right originally vested and become inherent in every Free-man of this Province as wanted not the help of any Grant or Chapter from the Proprietary to confirm it.</P>
<P>But the Proprietor, pursuant to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d recited Clause, made Charters which prescribed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Assembling the Free-men to act in Legislation after the Modes mentioned in the Memorial; and it may be the People were regardless of a new Charter after the Re∣signation of the first, not out of any liking they had to be conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned by Writs, but as the Right of Meeting together to make Laws was virtually in them by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid Royal Grant, so the form of their Elections and Assembling might be settled by Law, which was effected afterwards by an Act to Ascertain the number of Members of Assembly and to regulate Elections, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the fourth Year of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, and settled yearly Elections of Representatives in Assembly without Writs, and appointed the Time when and by whom those Elections should be made, as also the Time of the Assembly's Meeting, and how they should qualify themselves to act, choose their Speaker, and be Judges of the Qualifications and Elections of their own Members, sit upon their own Adjourn∣ments, appoint Committees, prepare Bills in order to pass into Laws, <HI>Impeach Criminals</HI> and redress Grievances <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By this Law and last Charter (wherein the Proprietary, according to his Right made one side of the agreement, which he could not alter or avoid without the Concurrence of the parties concerned on the other side) it is evident, That the whole Legislative Autho∣rity here is lodged in the Governour and Representatives of the People; and I have met none so senceless as to say, that the Governour is thereby concluded of having a Council to advise and assist in Legislation and other matter relating to the State, and I have known divers of the Members of that Board very serviceable in that Station, and, I doubt not, may be so still, therefore I desire they may not withdraw from their Service nor insist upon a Negative to the Acts of those that Represent them, which, by a reasonable Construc∣tion of the said Law and Charte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is lodged with the Governour, and is so vested in him by his Commission stamped with the Royal Allowance and Authority of the King's Let∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs Patent, That the Proprietary could by no Instruction or other Act whatsoever, with∣out the Governour's Consent, divest him of his Right to Govern, unless by resuming the Government or Deputing another in his st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d. And if the Governour has given any Bond or Covenant to observe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that abridge or restrain the Authority granted him by Commission to Exercise the Powers of Government in this Province, the same is void, as appears by the above cited Resolutions, from whence it may be observed how careful the Law is to keep Powers entire, as the best means to preserve good Order in States and Governments, where no such absurdity can be admitted, as to allow the Persons Repre∣sented to controul the Acts of their Representatives, especially in those Matters which the other Branch of the Legislature may think to be reasonably Proposed.</P>
<P>And altho' the Law declares, that Bonds and Covenants (given to Guard the Principal, when he would diminish or abridge the Power of his Deputy) are Repugnant to his Office, and therefore void and against Law, having a tendency to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny or delay Justice (as in our Case) yet, if the Governour came under any Security to observe the Directions of the King's Grant, which forbids to depart from the Faith and Allegeance due to the King, or to maintain Correspondence with his Enemies, or to commit Hostility against such as are in League with him, or Transgress against the Laws of Trade, and Navigation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for discharging of his Trust and Duty in the Administration of the Government according to the purport of the said Royal Grant and the Laws and Constitutions of this Province; I conceive that in those Cases such Security is binding upon the Governour and will be most effectual and available in Law, unless some illegal or repugnant Condition be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ed thereunto.</P>
<P>As to the Power of making Ordinances with the assertance of other Persons that the People's Delegates, it appears by the Patent, that those Ordinances cannot be Extended, in any sort, to bind change or take away the Right or Interest of any Person or Persons for or in their Life, Members, Free-hold, Goods or Chattels, nor are they directed to be made except sudden Accidents happen, whereto it may be necessary to apply Remedy, before the Free-holders or their Delegates can be assembled to make Laws,—Besides our Law∣makers (who ought to have Notice of such Occasions) may be convened as soon as the Magistrates and Officers of the respective Counties, who are to assist in making Ordinan∣ces: But if the Ordinance-makers should happen to get the start; yet when the Delegates of the People come together and acquaint the Governour of their readiness to assist him in the publick Service of the Government, and to answer the Exigences thereof, I think the Power of making Ordinances should then be waved, and the Legislative Authority applyed to, because their Acts are deemed more Extensive and Binding, as appears by the express Words of the said Patent.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002649_0003_0FE5DA9FA68AB300"/>
But if the Governour could be prevailed with not to Summon the Assembly upon such Emergency, or when Assembled would not Concur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with them in what may be for the Publick Good, as the Case was, when former Governours, being under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll direction, withstood the Representatives proposals and cordial Advice, and (contrary to Law and Charter) set up Ordinances instead of Laws, to the great dissatisfaction of the Assembly then attending, who declared themselves ready and writing to Concurr in a regular Esta∣blishment, according to the Laws and Practice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, which highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Lives, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Subjects; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are divers Worthy Member<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this House have been well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with these Proceedings, and if it were not so, yet the Journal of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nifest what I hint.</P>
<P>It may do well for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Consider, with what views he acted his part in that Tragedy, and whether it was not designed to render the People's Power in Legislation useless? whereby this Country, from a State of Freedom, should be changed into an Ar∣bitrary Government, subjected to the Power of one Person, as the Secretary in another Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ternally observes. I am apt to think by what I gather from this Memorial and some more of these Printed Papers, that the ready way to bring us under this Change must be by enjoyning a Negative upon the Governour and Assembly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Communication between them by Speeches and Messages, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> get a new Council, (for the present Members of that Honourable Board will not give in to this Arbitrary Scheme) who must be such as will assent to all the Secretary proposes, and when a Coun∣cil Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urmined, any Body without much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, may guess who that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Person</HI> must be.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed, that altho' the main scope of the Memorial is against the plain Rules of Law and Justice, yet the Author would seem to applaud <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Govern∣ment, by King, Lords and Commons, supposing that to be the Plan by which the Go∣vernments of the King's Plantations are Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and from thence, or from the conceit he has of his own Scheme, he takes Occasion to undervalue the Frame of our present Government, which the late Proprietary, with the Advice and Approbation of the People's Delegates in a most Solemn Manner settled, and of good Purpose and full intent Lodged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Powers of Legislation in the Governour and Representatives of all the Free-men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Province in General Assembly; and not only so, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his most abusive Re∣flections upon sooner Assemblies, and like an evil Minister and ungrateful Servant would in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, that the Proprietr's Intention did not Correspond with the express Words and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Design of his Charter of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ege, and brings this for Instances <Q>That the Pro∣prietor never intended to bind himself, nor ever in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act did bind himself up from a Right to lay his Deputy under Restrictions in Legislation;</Q> I think this point is so fully cleared by the foregoing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Law, that it may satisfy that Secretary him∣self of the Falshood of his Position; for if it were true (as I believe it is not) that the Proprietor, by his Charter Grants, did not intend to be bound by the Rules of Law (which must be the main Support of all his Powers) it would render him Inconsistent with himself, and prove him unworthy of the Trust and Confidence which the King, by His Royal Grant, reposed in his Fidelity, Wisdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Justice and Provident Circumspection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is taken Notice of in the Charter of Privileges to some purposes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to share in the Legislative Power, yet I know none would be against their Advice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon Bills brought up to the Governour, for that they are Men embark'd in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me interest with the People, and for the most part aim at the publick Good, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not for the Reason given by the Secretary, <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> That they <Q>have as large an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Colony, as the like number of any others.</Q> it is probable he may see a Service in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, which I cannot penetrate but, according to my Experience, a mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, devoted to the faithful discharge of his Trust and Duty to the Government, may do more good to the State, than a Richer or more Learned Man, who by his ill Temper and aspiring Mind becomes an opposer of the Constitution by which he should act.</P>
<P>However since an Interest in the Colony is pointed out as a Qualification to act for the good of the Publick, it may be supposed, that the Members of Assembly will think it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, that the Governour may be referred to the Approbation of their House, con∣sisting of some Ancient Settlers, who have a good Competency, and others, who are de∣scended from such as brought considerable Estates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Province, and went through great Difficulties in the first Settlement of this Wilderness, to the hazard of their Lives and Estates, amongst the Indian Natives, and spent their Strength and Substance in Em∣proving the Country, and by their indefatigable Industry upon the Land, which, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>now, would have been of little worth to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Proprietary or any Body else, if Divine Providence had not Blessed the Labours of the first Settlers and succeeding Inhabitants, who made this City and Province of Value to the Proprietary and his Family, and afford∣ed a Competency to themselves, who in the Enjoyment thereof, with the aditional favours of Peace and Plenty under a mild Administration, have great reason to lay the good of the Publick and it's true Interest as close to Heart a any others.</P>
