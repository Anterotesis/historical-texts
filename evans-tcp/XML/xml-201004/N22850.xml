<HEAD>A Surprising Account, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT can be more shock∣ing to the human mind than the appearance of one of those fallen angels that were turn∣ed out of heaven, and now make the habitations of darkness their homes! Such an appearance would strike terror into the most unshaken mind, the most hard &amp; stubborn heart; yea, of such a kind as no one can conceive of, but those who have had the trial, which has been ours—an account of which we now send abroad.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 24th of May, 1784, John Chesselden and James Arkins, set out from Kenfry, a town near the Missi∣sippi, to visit an old friend of ours, who lived about twenty

The road that led to this place was through a wood, called Var∣num's wood, on account of its belonging to one Varnum. We sat out about 8 o'clock in the morning; soon after which, James Arkins began to tell me, (John Chesselden) that should we in passing this wood, meet with such a devil of a fright as Isaac King did, (a person who passed them a few months before, and supposed he saw a person without either head or arms) we should deserve to stay in them, and never be suffered to return or pass them. He likewise said that persons of the character of King, ought to be banished from the society of all that had either spirits or common sense; and that he defied all the devils in∣habiting the infernal regions to intimidate him in the least, should they be pleased to appear to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="5" REF="030187_0005_0FE4FD4B6E67A380"/>
this speech of his, I undertook to reprimand him for his un∣guarded talk, telling him that al∣though I supposed the said King was frightened, at nothing more than imagination, yet I believed the devil was often permitted to appear to men, tho' we had not seen the appearance, This talk seemed greatly to raise his spirits, insomuch that he said if there ev∣er appeared a devil or any spirit unto men while on earth, he desir∣ed that he might in passing this wood, have one of them for a guest.</P>
<P>Little did he, as well as myself thing of these words of his being fulfilled; which however was done, in a most frightful and shocking manner; in a manner which clearly shewed it to be the hand of heaven, that it should be as he desired, and which shews us that the all-wise God observes the actions of men, and often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

had not proceeded above two miles after this conversation was over, before we came to a small river which crossed the road, at which we made a stop and sat down; we had not sat there a∣bove eight or ten minutes before we heard a rustling among the leaves at some distance, and which we supposed to be occasioned by porcupines, which are very plen∣ty in those parts. Here we sat for some time waiting to see these supposed creatures come into our view, which seemed to move to∣wards us, though very moderate∣ly, but at length resolved not to wait for their coming, but set out to meet them. We had not gone far before we rose a small hill, on the other side of which, near the bottom, stood a large bunch of bushes, in which was this rusttling of leaves. We both descended the hill till we came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="030187_0007_0FE4FD47CC5E8CB8"/>
sudden issued out of them a tor∣rent of smoke, together with a beast as large as a moose, of the most tremendous and hideous as∣pect, something like that of a li∣on, though infinitely more shock∣ing, as his eyes appeared to be a very flame of fire in its full strength, and out of his mouth went a smoke like that of a fur∣nace. He had not been out of the bushes above the spabe of a minute, before he stood erect up∣on his feet, and greatly altered both in shape and gesture; at the sight of which we both fell pros∣trate on the ground, and so con∣tinued a while, wholly insensi∣ble; when at length, I John Chesselden partly recovered from my insensibility and raising my∣self up partly on my hands and feet, discovered this monster about three yards from me, in a hori∣zontal posture, in the clear fluid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="030187_0008_0FE4FCD689000BF0"/>
earth, having the perfect form of a man, except a head, of which he was wholly destitute. My com∣panion, James Arkins, being not yet recovered, I thought, if possi∣ble, to do it, and endeavour to make our escape from the feroci∣ous tyrant: whereupon I stepped up to him and upon gently touch∣ing him, he immediately, its great surprize sprang up, and with a loud voice exclaimed, God be merciful to me the greatest of sinners, and most worthy of thy displeasure. Upon these words being pronounced, this truly frightful monster immediately left his situation in the air, and stood upright on his feet before the said James Arkins, without either head or hands, and in the very form which the fore men∣tioned King had represented. In this posture he continued for a∣bout the space of half an hour, standing the whole of the time
<PB N="9" REF="030187_0009_0FE4FD2F0AFE9728"/>
directly before the said Arkins, and imitating him in every par∣ticular, even in the very motion of his fingers; till at length he gradually drew back from us, and seated himself near a small stream that passed at the bottom of this hill, about twenty rods from where we now were. Here in this place he sent forth the most horrid cry that perhaps ever mor∣tals heard, or devils uttered. It was so strong a sound, that the earth where we stood was in great commotion, and every tree ap∣peared to be leaving its foudation. It is not possible to describe our feelings at these moments when we expected so shortly to bid a∣dieu to our earthly bodies; to be destroyed by this universal ty∣rant; what to do we knew not; to flee from him was not in our power. It was now about 2 o' clock in the afternoon, &amp; know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="030187_0010_0FE4FD249FB74728"/>
we resolved to make an attempt to return, which was not above two miles and an half. No sooner had we attempted to move, than the monster arose from his seat, which when he took, he was without head or hands, or any kind of garment, but was now adorned with all these, and of the most dazzling appearance; and truly had a more striking appearance than the greatest po∣tentate or prince on earth;— and in this form made up to us, where he stood for some time, as likewise did we, without either attempting to move in the least; but at length we undertook to proceed on our way back from whence we came, which when he saw, he made up to us, and with a very pleasant voice, said, why do you hurry yourselves, friends; I will shortly be your companion, and will attend you where you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="030187_0011_0FE4FD2D84D4E488"/>
countenances, what can be the cause of it? pray let me know, and I will free you from it; come, young friends, walk as I do; upon which he immediately clear∣ed himself from the earth, and walked about three feet above the surface, which was truly a fear∣ful sight, and highly astonishing. After he had proceeded in this manner about 20 rods, he again came upon the surface of the earth, and proceeded with us on our way until we were within one hundred rods of our habita∣tions, when he told us we had got to go a little way with him, where he would shew us several cities, most elegantly adorned with a thousand objects that would highly elevate us, and where he said were many pleas∣ant dwelling places, which, with∣out doubt, we should so greatly fancy that he believed we should be willing to take up with them
<PB N="12" REF="030187_0012_0FE4FCF9F5194300"/>
for our abodes and lasting homes, where likewise he said were many that spoke our language, and he believed were our countrymen. After this speech of his, I John Chesselden made answer to him in these words: My business be∣ing of such a nature it renders it impossible for me to attend you to this delightsome dwelling, must therefore beg you to let me pass, together with my compan∣ion, until some other season and more convenient opportunity. Upon this speech of mine, he ap∣peared greatly incensed and im∣mediately caught James Arkins by the hair of his head, and with a horrid cry said, what such young upstarts as you disobey my will! Where were you, when old Adam and Eve in paradise in in∣nocence stood? why did not they disobe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my will? After he had said these words he set Arkins at his liberty, but not without tak∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="030187_0013_0FE4FD308F64BC20"/>
out at least one half of the hair of his head, and wounding him in many parts of his body. Now it was about sunset, and we were at least four miles from any inhabitants, in this deplora∣ble situation, never expecting to be in any other, with Arkins groaning with his wounds and death staring us in the face on every side.—Here, gentle reader, drop a tear at our condition in these moments, when we expect∣ed never to escape to inform the world of our feelings or the cause of our deaths. But Heaven be praised; now did we even in these moments that so shortly threatened our ruin, get from his infernal hands. Seeing night was come upon us, and we still in the hands of the devil, who every minute would assume what∣ever forms he pleased, and them which were the most shocking to behold, I resolved to look up to
<PB N="14" REF="030187_0014_0FE4FD3213235678"/>
heaven for relief, fell upon my bended knees and cryed with a loud voice to him who made the heavens, that he would not suf∣fer us to be destroyed by this fallen angel, who was driven out of heaven and sentenced to dwell in chains and everlasting punish∣ment. Immediately upon the tyrant's hearing these words, he vanished out of our sight, and was gone; upon which I imme∣diately took Arkins on my back, who was so wounded that he could not walk, and arrived safe∣ly at our own homes about 8 o' clock at night.</P>
<P>But by the way, we must not forget to inform the reader, that among the many forms this ty∣rant assumed, was this truly sur∣prising one: as the dark of the evening approached, Arkins be∣ing in great distress with his wounds, and as I suppose some∣thing shattered in reason, he cri∣ed
<PB N="15" REF="030187_0015_0FE4FD3BC65D8828"/>
out, who, or which of you can deliver me out of these deep agonies? upon which the devil said, I will give you the relief you deserve, and instantly mount∣ed a large rock, upon which he had the perfect form of two per∣sons, both lying prostrate, one like a man when expiring, utter∣ing the most piercing groans that perhaps ever mortals heard, and saying, oh my ruined and depart∣ing soul! The other form in some measure resembled a man, tho' much larger, with one cloven foot, his face black, and gestures very terrible. After they had continued in this posture some time, the one in form of a man, uttered several more piercing groans than any of the former, and violently struggling, seemed to die immediately! upon which there seemed to come or evapor∣ate from his body, the same form or likeness, to appearance com∣posed
<PB N="16" REF="030187_0016_0FE4FD3D4BA3FB00"/>
of pure air, whick kept in a gentle motion or tremor for some time—when at length, this other form arose upon his feet, with an aspect very terrible, step∣ped to the utmost extremity of the rock, where he extended his arms to receive this form in the air, which gradually made to∣wards him, tho seemingly with great reluctance, until it came within them, when he grasped it with the greatest fury, and im∣mediately leaped down upon the ground, which when his feet touched, gave way for the space of two rods in circumference, and sunk directly down, leaving a large cavity, into which he de∣scended with this form or body in his arms, where appeared melt∣ed minerals or brimstone, dread∣ful to behold▪ in which they both continued some time, where were groans not to be uttered. At length he who had the cloven
<PB N="17" REF="030187_0017_0FE4FD5362D48100"/>
foot came out of this place, leav∣ing the other behind, who sent forth such shrieks as we shall not attempt to describe, as language would be too feeble for the un∣dertaking. Upon his coming out of this place, he returned to this rock, and on touching it with one hand it rolled over and entirely shut up the cavity or o∣pening in the earth, when all was silent; he then put on many frightful shapes by turns, till at length he vanished and was gone.</P>
<P>The occasion of our giving the reader a more particular account of this last appearance was, that we verily believe it to have had great resemblance to a person re∣signing his breath, and having his immortal soul committed by the great Sovereign of the universe into the hands of the prince of darkness. Surely it must have been the emblem of this, as one of these forms was the exact pic∣ture
<PB N="18" REF="030187_0018_0FE4FD59C8704358"/>
of one in the agonies of death, as the very image of the immortal soul appeared in open air, near the form of the body with the monster, this universal tyrant receiving and consinging it to this true description of end∣less torments.</P>
<P>And since this was without doubt a representation of what we have said, where shall the wretch be found, so hard and so stupid as to one day more, yea one hour, follow the ways of the devil, however inviting they may appear; for they will surely lead to the death of the immortal soul! Tho' he now smiles at thy ways, he will at death appear as he did to us upon this rock (most dread∣ful) and after groaning life away as the form did, he will, with the same ferocity, confine the soul in endless misery, and a rock will be rolled to the cavern's mouth, never to be moved.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030187_0019_0FE4FD5B4C9E54D8"/>During the whole day nothing gave me a greater shock, than to hear the devil say to Arkins, I will give you the relief you de∣serve, as I suppose he meant by this to make an attempt upon our lives, and his appearing upon the rock as he did seems to con∣firm the opinion. Without doubt he intended by this to show us, that he had a will, though he had not power, quickly to destroy our souls, and confine them in the dark abyss which he repre∣sented to us; but heaven be prais∣ed, he was not permitted, but sent his way, without executing his plan, and we were conducted to our habitations, rejoicing in the strength of the Lord, and prais∣ing his holy name for this won∣derful deliverance.</P>
<P>The next morning we related the narrative to our friends, which soon spread thro' the town, and before 12 o'clock there were at
<PB N="20" REF="030187_0020_0FE4FD4CF148D628"/>
least two hundred people collect∣ed, with countenances that shew∣ed sorrow of the deepest nature, supposing it was an appearance that foreboded their destruction, was the appearance real, to con∣vince them of which, Arkins shewed them his wounds; but this not being sufficient, we told them that by walking with us in∣to Varnum's wood, they would be convinced; upon which four per∣sons turned out and went with us, viz. James Erwin, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Na∣than Cole, Benjamin Guy, and Samuel Ford, to whom we shew∣ed the rock which was moved, and which wholly satisfied them as to the truth of it; we then re∣turned with these four men, who told the people that what we had related was without doubt true, as the huge rock was moved (for so it was called) at least 12 feet; which when they heard they be∣lieved, and we were brought be∣fore
<PB N="21" REF="030187_0021_0FE4FD5DED56FEA0"/>
them and related the whole affair, with the conversation that passed between us before we en∣tered the wood, which greatly satisfied them, for, said they, it was to punish a wicked person, and not to destroy us, as we im∣agined. After the people's fears were abated, Mr. John Boyd, who was preaching in these parts, and who came to enquire into the matter, called us out, and in the presence of all the people said, "the appearance of the devil is a great and shocking sight to the human mind, yet not so shocking as the sight of one who makes light of it, and can deliberately, when a little out of humour, wish him to be his companion and guest: surely the sight of the lat∣ter of these ought to strike us with vastly greater astonishment than the former. It ought to put each one of us upon strict enqui∣ry whether we are wholly free
<PB N="22" REF="030187_0022_0FE4FEB777E470F0"/>
from such an abominable charac∣ter. All must be convinced by what happened yesterday, that the great God takes notice of the words and actions of men, and often in this life gives them what they say they desire. And as we know he is a being of justice, we may conclude, that those who pass through this life in a course of sin, and yet go unpunished, must, when they die, be sentenced to that world, where they must ev∣er remain in unspeakable misery and despair. We see one before us who has been taken at his word, and in a shocking manner wounded by one who he wished might attend him. What can he say? he has had his wish. Be∣hold him and take warning, flee his ways with the greatest abhor∣rence. May this be a mean of turning him into the ways of righteousness and every one pres∣ent, till we shall say these are the
<PB N="23" REF="030187_0023_0FE4FD3ED2FBD918"/>
ways of pleasantness and true de∣light. Then will the Lord smile on this new world, and choose it for his habitation from genera∣tion to generation."</P>
<P>After this speech James Ar∣kins in presence of all the people, came forth, shewed his wounds and with tears in his eyes said, these have I received justly, and had I received my deserts, I must confess it would have been to suf∣fer with the devils to the endless ages of eternity. Here, my friends, you see one who has lived in a course of sin, and at length was so hardened as even to desire the devil for a guest in bodily shape. Be admonished, my friends, not to follow such steps as these, but flee them with the utmost detes∣tation. Let it strike horror upon every soul that makes light of those things, and at every trifle will wish his appearance. Let it remind us that all our words are
<PB N="24" REF="030187_0024_0FE4FCF5632E68A0"/>
taken notice of, and will at some period come upon us, and per∣haps when we are not aware of it. Let it be the means of reforming my ways, and all others of this character, and of turning unto the Lord for mercy, which if we do, perhaps he may attend upon our cry and save us, which shall ever be the prayer of</P>
