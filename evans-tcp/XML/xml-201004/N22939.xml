<HEAD>EXPLANATION of the PLATE.</HEAD>
<P>COURTEOUS Reader, permit me to give thee a description of my emblemati∣cal design.</P>
<P>On the left corner, through the opening clouds, thou perceivest the rays of <HI>Heaven,</HI> covering, as a shield of defence, the <HI>Angel of God,</HI> in a conflict with SATAN; in his left hand he contains the <HI>shield of Truth,</HI> engraved in its centre, the <HI>Sword of Jus∣tice,</HI> while the right hand extended, bran∣dishes the sword of <HI>Wrath and Power.</HI> SATAN, like a vanquished foe, attempting his escape with his weapons of defence; in his right hand he holds a <HI>dry bone,</HI> a moral of <HI>wounded</HI> creation; in his left the first beguiled creature, the <HI>serpent,</HI> which he assumed, that turns its head round to dart its venomous poison into the arm of
<PB REF="030283_0003_0FE5A149AE6983F8"/>the grand revolter, that brought the dire∣ful curse upon him.</P>
<P>Underneath, on a mossy turf, thou perceivest CAIN, with bended knees and hands uplifted, in a state of <HI>wonder, fear,</HI> and <HI>prayer,</HI> while all the inhabitants of creation of different natures around him, with eyes intently fixed, as with ideas of rational astonishment, seem terrified and moved with the dreadful sight.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS far as it is consistent with improving the morals, and instructive to mankind, the support of religion and moral duties;— the <HI>glory of our Maker,</HI> and salvation of souls; it is an incumbent duty upon every member of the community to lend his as∣sistance, towards accomplishing that salu∣tary purpose proportionable to the abilities with which he is possessed. How far the Author's endeavours merits this title, an impartial and judicious reader will easily determine, and no farther does he request the patronage of public favour.</P>
<P>The Author cannot without ingratitude to individuals, and injustice to the Public in general, omi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mentioning, at the front of this Work, the disinterested civility he has experienced from the gentlemen com∣posing
<PB REF="030283_0005_0FE5A14E14CBCE88"/>the Committee of <HI>The New-York Society for the Information and Assistance of Persons Emigrating from Foreign Coun∣tries."</HI> And in a particular manner ac∣knowledges the respectable and obliging conduct of the gentlemen, delegated by the Committee to confer with him on his pub∣lication of this Work, and the generous encouragement he has experienced thro' the channel of that influence.</P>
<P>He cannot but hope that an institution founded upon principles of so benevolent a motive, will be crowned with that suc∣cess as is consistent with the many unfore∣seen advantages, and benefits that may reasonably be expected to accrue from it, to Emigrants of all descriptions; either to those whose immediate necessities may re∣quire present assistance, or such whose affluent circumstances may only require the needful information to accommodate them∣selves with convenience and happiness.</P>
<P><PB REF="030283_0006_0FE5A188F9D582F0"/>
A generous Public will undoubtedly see the utility of the plan in these days of universal emigration from all parts of the globe, and contribute their aid to its sup∣port, from the principle of <HI>humanity</HI> and <HI>friendship.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author has, in this treatise endea∣voured to represent CAIN under the weight of those awful impressions that violent murder generally makes upon the mind of the perpetrator, and the remorse of consci∣ence that accompanies guilt of so horrid a nature; at the same time, to inculcate the necessity of humiliation and penitence, with a patient submission to the will of an offended GOD. Though the infliction of his chastisements may be attended with severe crosses and tribulations for restless and uncomfortable seasons; yet still his dispensations are all appointed for our good in the end. Although the calami∣ties of our body or mind, inflicted upon us for our iniquities, may seem for the pre∣sent grievous, we must not mistrust his clemency and mercy, for his ways of re∣velation far exceeds our finite comprehen∣sions. These considerations are encou∣ragements to the vilest sinner, not to des∣pair, nor for the most upright man to pre∣sume;
<PB REF="030283_0008_0FE5A1520826F5B8"/>for although, while we are in the body there is <HI>hope,</HI> so on the other hand, to counterbalance that hope, there are <HI>temptations.</HI> The <HI>Almighty</HI> can, and fre∣quently does make use of supernatural means to convince us of his <HI>Omnipotency,</HI> and wean our affections from transitory and perishable delights; and though those alarming <HI>mementos,</HI> may convey terrific ideas to our imaginations, yet still his pur∣poses are founded upon unerring wisdom; and calculated for our good; and while we restrain all our <HI>inordinate</HI> desires, he will bountifully supply all our <HI>necessary</HI> wants, as far as consistent with his own <HI>glory,</HI> and our good.</P>
<P>Thus the Author has endeavoured to render <HI>Cain's Lamentations over Abel,</HI> as useful to mankind, as <HI>Gessner</HI> did the <HI>Death of Abel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CAIN's LAMENTATIONS <HI>OVER ABEL.</HI> BOOK THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>THUS spake CAIN to creation, 'Be calm, be serene; let an awful silence reign throughout the wounded face of nature! Be reposed in solemn sadness, all ye cheer∣ful inhabitants of the creation! happiness is banished from your peaceful retreats; harmony no longer accompanies your social retirements; for the gloomy horrors of melancholy have found an entrance into the habitations of mortals, and the per∣spective views of felicity are buried in the gulph of infernal temptations. Short and momentary have been the days of hope allotted to the first born of mankind; like the wings of the mounting eagle, have ta∣ken
<PB N="12" REF="030283_0010_0FE5A1576954A870"/>their rapid course with the velocity of imperception, and doomed the forlorn, the miserable CAIN to years of pensive woe! Resaon, art thou awakened? or do the phantoms of delusive imaginations deceive thee? Have the nocturnal slumbers of darkness taken possession of thy soul, and whirled thy scattered conceptions of things into uncreated wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds? and the fancies of sleep discomposed thy superior powers by a confused mass of horrible ideas, repre∣senting to thy mind a scene that will be shocking to the ears of humanity, for ge∣nerations unborn, and denounce venge∣ance upon the posterity of the first homi∣cide and fratricide in the world?</P>
<P>'See! there he lieth! behold my bro∣ther! he <HI>sleepeth!</HI> But why this <HI>unusual</HI> —this <HI>motionless</HI> slumber?—why cold and liseless his once heaving pulse, that was wont to keep pace with the movements of nature's self; and those vigorous limbs that relaxed not in their activity to obey
<PB N="13" REF="030283_0011_0FE5A18E369D1440"/>their MAKER's dictates; even from the ri∣sing sun till evening shadows evinced ap∣proaching night?— The circling blood of manhood se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> retarded in its usual pro∣gress, and a fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zen chilness closeth up those lively passages, that with progressive rotun∣dity of motion communicated activity from vein to vein! I will again open my lips un∣to him—'ABEL! ABEL! <HI>my brother</HI> ABEL <HI>aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke!</HI> behold before thee the image of horror! a bare statue of mortality! a man and no man—CAIN, thy brother! thy murderer! Speak, I say, if breath is still within thee!—<HI>he is silent!</HI>—motionless he rests, regardless of my entreaties.— What can this portend?— What can this change in man predict? Can this cold, this icy state, be the ALMIGHTY'S decree to ADAM and his posterity for the first act of disobedience in Eden's paradise? Or has the GREAT CREATOR, from his unaltera∣ble wisdom, appointed seasons and portions of time for the offspring of ADAM to have a temporary relaxation from the laborious exercises and measures of life? If it possible
<PB N="14" REF="030283_0012_0FE5A15415F57D90"/>that created beings can again return into heir primeval state of non-existence, for hours, days, or years? If so, why not the elder before the younger son of ADAM? Why either of the two before the father of both? Astonishment seizes me! my soul is troubled! I dread the consequences of my deed! Our father never experienced this mysterious change, or never revealed the unfathomable secret to his son, to pre∣pare him to encounter such a wordly revo∣lution.'</P>
<P>Thus was CAIN tossed to and fro by the agitations of his mind; framing such im∣perfect ideas of the nature of death—whe∣ther he had or had not killed ABEL his brother, as we must naturally conclude that ABEL was the first corpse that CAIN ever saw, having no Scripture tradition to give us room to suppose the contrary.</P>
<P>CAIN in this state of perplexity delibe∣rates within himself to go to his father and make known his anxiety—thus said,
<PB N="15" REF="030283_0013_0FE5A19055778390"/>he hastens towards ADAM, and thus ad∣dresses him: 'Father, thou first and ori∣ginal of men, speak to thy first born; dis∣dain not an answer to the requests of CAIN thy son; reject not his solicitations, nor turn a deaf ear to his petition—remove the sorrows of his soul, or they will become an increasing evil with his length of days— Declare unto him the mutation that hea∣ven has ordained for mankind—enlighten his ignorance; and let him not continue in the obscurity of fear, and hourly wan∣der in the labyrinth of despairing doubt∣fulness.' ADAM speaks—'Child open thy mind to thy father.' CAIN begins—</P>
<P>'Make known the will of GOD to thy son, that future generations may be ac∣quainted with the decrees of Heaven— Will the Creator of the world condescend to appear to the descendants of ADAM, and with the voice of majesty admonish them for their future obedience, to cleave to good and abhor evil? Are these any of the conditions the Almighty entered into
<PB N="16" REF="030283_0014_0FE5A15A113FB5E0"/>with ADAM, as renewing covenants for children yet unborn? Will CAIN, will ABEL, have the gracious opportunity of hearing and answering the Eternal One, by declaring his will to regulate their fu∣ture conduct in life? Will new commands, and injunctions of obedience be delivered to them, to guide them in the paths of rec∣titude and truth? Speak, my father, while CAIN thy son is close attention, to procure alleviation to his wounded soul.' ADAM thus begins;</P>
<P>'What alleth my first-born? What tumul∣tuous grief has taken possession of the soul of my eldest child? those questions border upon phrenzy; such interrogatories cannot proceed from deliberation, ripened by per∣fect maturity; Thy father is at a loss—it exceeds the limits of his comprehension, even to conceive the springs from whence thy difficult passages slow; it must be the production of some sudden disaster in na∣ture, for thy soul to be so agitated; origin∣ating in the first great sin of disobedience
<PB N="17" REF="030283_0015_0FE5A191E4DDA328"/>in thy father; and those disquietudes and distracted emotions that disorganise the vi∣tal parts of my son, must be the fruits of that first guilt.'</P>
<P>'Oh, ADAM! thy memory is now refresh∣ed with the bitter reflections of that un∣garded moment, when the first act of in∣gratitude and evil was committed upon the earth by tasting the forbidden fruit.'</P>
<P>'Nothing, my child, has been withheld from thee or thy brother, that was apper∣taining to your necessary knowledge, that has been manifested unto ADAM your fa∣ther, by the Great Creator; no duties commanded or restrictions enjoined, have been kept from you; for it contributes much to the happiness of my days to wit∣ness the holy and blameless walking of my children before the Lord in purity of heart and uprightness of life; strictly adhering to the commandments of heaven, and in mutual love and concord with each other. But, CAIN, thy disordered looks forbode
<PB N="18" REF="030283_0016_0FE5A15C1D5F4598"/>some trouble pending, and nearly ripe to fruition; thy dejected appearance strikes a dread upon my mind, beyond the forti∣tude of paternal tenderness to support; the whole frame of nature within thee seems to border upon distraction; the agitating motions of thy soul, and irregular beating of thy pulse, are certain omens of some approaching evil—retire to thy peace∣ful habitation, and partake of the necessary calmness and tranquility—thou indul∣gest some ungovernable passion, some un∣ruly phantom that deprives thee of man∣hood, reduces thee in reason beneath the standard of a child, and bidding defiance to the exalted dignity of a man: restrain all doubtful timidity, and confidence in thy Maker, for all needful revelation for your instruction will be manifested in due time. If new dictates or prohibitions are ordained in heaven for the sons of ADAM to rectify their lives, it will be declared at the Lord's appointed time to CAIN and ABEL; GOD will not permit succeeding children to re∣main in darkness, and unacquainted with
<PB N="19" REF="030283_0017_0FE5A1955F71B2A8"/>his will. But declare unto me, CAIN, from what hidden motives issues that gloom on thy countenance, and the source of thy inward calamity? Remove my astonish∣ment! Cease not to quell the disturbance thou hast created in my breast, and dispel the anguish thou hast brought on thy fa∣ther, by concealing thy own grief—What moved thy earnest solicitations? wherein is thy soul wounded? Relate thy trouble to EVE thy mother; perhaps her superior knowledge in the virtue of herbs may pro∣cure some balsamic plant, that by her care∣ful preparation, may procure thee relief, restore thy disordered frame to its former calmness, and banish from thy mind all un∣ruly perturbations.'</P>
<P>To this discourse of ADAM, CAIN be∣gins to reply;</P>
<P>'Oh, my father! let me not see my mo∣ther! Parents of the misereble! in the an∣guish of my soul have I spoke thus. Answer me one question, father.' 'Propose it my
<PB N="20" REF="030283_0018_0FE5A15E43A9FD00"/>child.' 'What is <HI>death?</HI>' ADAM replies; 'It is the change, CAIN, instituted by hea∣ven to be undergone by all mankind, at GOD's appointed time; it is the Lord's doing; we then cease our mortal existence, and return to GOD that made us.' 'ADAM my father, be thou again attentive to thy son; solve his doubts, remove his fears, and speak for ABEL, thy child; my brother <HI>sleepeth!</HI> a sleep yet unknown to ADAM or EVE; Those purple streams that were wont to flow through the fibres of nature, and give activity to the vivid arteries of youth, are suddenly relaxed in their daily course, and become motionless, pale, and cold; the crimson hae that adorned and beautified his chearful countenance is, like a blossom of snow, vanished from sight, and an icy stiffness substituted, to fix a permanent chillness on his once bloomy cheeks; thus lies ABEL, the favorite of heaven, extended on the mossy bank, by the side of his staring and hungry flock, bleating for daily food from his tender nurture; he lies inactive, plunged unpre∣paredly
<PB N="21" REF="030283_0019_0FE5A1976DABC9A8"/>into that dubious state thou speak∣est of, by the hand of CAIN his brother! What have I done? Will he not again resume life, to renew his daily diligence? to present his acceptable sacrifices to his GOD, and his prayers to heaven to pacify offended wrath upon CAIN? I will hasten again unto him. Father follow thou me.</P>
<P>CAIN outran his father, and came first to the horrid spot where ABEL still lay.— 'I will,' said he, 'with tears of lamen∣tation, wipe the clotted blood from his lovely face before my father come, and pour over him the plaintive accents of my wounded soul; and in pensive strains of grievous melancholy, utter with mournful sadness the language of despair and repen∣tance. My brother! my brother! Have these hands produced the direful effects, originating in our parents first fall? is this death? Is the change pronounced up∣on the children of ADAM? Is this the curse denounced for eating the forbidden fruit? Is this the road allotted for all mankind to
<PB N="22" REF="030283_0020_0FE5A161E0BD7840"/>travel from earth to heaven? ABEL, thou answerest me not; He continueth solemn∣ly silent! every organ of sense is deprived of its necessary properties; the whole body overhung with gloomy sadness, and re∣gardless of CAIN's bitter reproaches on himself, he peaceably lays at rest.— CAIN, ignominious infamy hast thou en∣tailed upon thy posterity! behold the dire∣ful consequences of thy implacable malice against thy inoffensive brother; where gen∣tleness and meekness were always treasur∣ed up to receive thee into his arms with fra∣ternal and tender embraces. Heaven must be shocked at thy unnatural transformation from a brother to a murderer! detestable must thou be to thy own remembrance, to presume to limit the boundaries of Hea∣ven's will, by destroying a life which thou neither gavest nor can restore! Here com∣eth my father in tears.'</P>
<P>'ADAM, behold thy son; step forward and touch him. Is this death?' ADAM after a few moments recovering from his
<PB N="23" REF="030283_0021_0FE5A1990011D280"/>shock, exclaimed, 'Cursed art thou in the sight of GOD; and impiously infamous will be the descendants of thy loins.' Curse me not ADAM! the curses of ABEL alone from the ground will sink me! Behold he is putrifying; he is hastening with swift dissolution to corruption, and presently be united in nature with the earth that sup∣ports him; CAIN laments him, CAIN by him unnoticed. What father, must now be done? Lift up thy hand against CAIN, and retaliate with the blood of thy first born, for the death of thy younger son, that CAIN may accompany ABEL through 'the unknown regions of death.' No, CAIN; vengeance belongeth unto GOD.' ADAM now looking upon ABEL cries out 'My child! my child! ABEL my son! he answereth not his father! This must be to <HI>die!</HI> This must be <HI>death!</HI> From this hour must ADAM and EVE bid adieu to joy; for the father of men has lived to see before he tasted death. I go and fetch thy mother, to be a witness to the power of death.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="030283_0022_0FE5A1640362AF18"/>
'No, father; wound not her tender feel∣ings with the woeful sight.'</P>
<P>O CAIN, this act of thine must exceed the threatened curse? the life of ABEL was the gift of GOD; he alone had autho∣rity to take it away. Woe be unto thee, thou hast involved us all in the guilty scene! The blood of ABEL will pierce the skies, and invoke Almighty vengeance for wrath upon us. Fly with rapidity, if creation can produce a cavern of darkness fit for thee! haste upon the wings of consci∣ous timidity, and hide thee, if possible, from the presence of GOD! But alas! no rock so dark, nor cave so deep, but the eyes of Omnisciency will detect thee! No work of creation, ever so dismal or dreary, that would display such clemeney as to admit thee within the bosoms of their obscurity, or vainly attempt to secure thee from the penetrations of Omnipotence! Humble thyself therefore before him: Let the smarting wounds of encreasing peni∣tence be mingled with the tears of deep
<PB N="25" REF="030283_0023_0FE5A19B166D2278"/>contrition, and unremittingly presented through the bitter channel of painful re∣morse, to the Throne of Heaven. Let humiliating protestations, daily, hourly, nay, every minute of thy existence, accom∣pany fervently thy lamentable supplicati∣ons, that the sacrifice of keen anguish may, in a <HI>small</HI> measure, be proportion∣able to the magnitude of thy crime. We know not the will of GOD; the wisdom of Infinity is unsearchable; it exceeds our shallow capacities; our ideas are too con∣sined to judge thereof; he can—he may be merciful where mercy is not due, and pardon sins that to us may appear unpar∣donable —Let, therefore, thy sorrow be unfeigned; thy penitence devoutly sin∣cere; and without relaxation or intermis∣sion persevere to the end of thy days; but be not vainly deceived with expectations of comfort or consolation from ADAM, for his riper years are incapable of admi∣nistering it unto thee.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030283_0024_0FE5A16595551710"/>
'Behold my <HI>child,</HI> thy <HI>brother!</HI> there he lieth! <HI>Abel!</HI> my <HI>son!</HI> my <HI>child!</HI> he lieth extended; he is no more! Silence dwelleth within him: peace abideth with him. O CAIN, my son! I will forbear longer to encrease thy anguish, by exte∣nuating thy guilt. <HI>Henceforward, O my soul, be thou patiently silent, and submissive∣ly resigned to the heavy stroke with a hea∣venly firmness.</HI> CAIN.' 'Father.' 'Join me to commit his cold corpse to the earth, to its native parent dust; for GOD thus spoke unto thy father; <HI>'For dust thou art and into dust shalt thou return.'</HI></P>
<P>After discharging this last mournful office for my child, I return to EVE thy mother, and communicate unto her the doleful tidings; and hasten thou to ap∣pease thy offended GOD.' This last office of paternal love being with solemnity and tears discharged, the Parent of mankind, with mournful and broken accents, bids adieu to the grave of ABEL, and takes farewell of unhappy CAIN; and with
<PB N="27" REF="030283_0025_0FE5A1A0ED8751B8"/>wringing hands, and eyes overflowing with waters of grief, he hastens through the shady bowers, moistening the grass with the tears of lamentation, in search of EVE his wife. EVE impatiently waiting the result of her husband and son's con∣versation, was eagerly prepared to hear the news from the mouth of ADAM. He attempts to speak; utteranee was denied him; faultering was his half lengthened syllables; and by long and forced expres∣sions, was the melancholy catastrophe an∣nounced to the mother of men; to the mother of ABEL the <HI>dead</HI>—She no sooner comprehended a sufficiency of ADAM's in∣articulate words, to dispel all doubts in her mind, but her whole nature within her with an unusual shriek, gave way to the unexpected shock; the voice of her ago∣nies reached the very skies! In vain did ADAM apply every effort that tenderness and reason could dictate to reconcile her dejected mind to the weighty intelligence; but anguish had taken too deep root for
<PB N="28" REF="030283_0026_0FE5A167BB5339B0"/>conjugal affection to remove; and, extend∣ed on the cold element, she laid in an al∣most state of non-existence; when at last coming to reason, she lift up her eyes to∣wards ADAM with consternation, and cries out;</P>
<P>'Where are my two sons? CAIN, be∣ing now come within hearing of his mo∣ther's voice, with the terrors of guilt and self-cutting reproaches, flies towards the spot, and falling with his face to the ground exclaims:</P>
<P>'Woe is me! on me be the curse! on me be the vengeance that Heaven has re∣served for man's first disobedience; On me, O GOD, display thy wrath! ADAM was speechless; EVE almost senseless; neither capable of giving vent to the emo∣tions of pity or anger. The scene was af∣fecting; it was too distressing for the alrea∣dy wretched fratricide to support; and with the terrors of conviction, inseparable from conscious guilt, and surrounded with
<PB N="29" REF="030283_0027_0FE5A1A2ADFB8F88"/>the direful apprehensions of lamenting des∣pair, he quits the mournful spot of his al∣most lifeless parents, and ruminates sor∣rowfully where to fly to procure peace to his soul, and, if possible, to escape the vi∣gilance of his GOD. 'I will again return,' says he, 'to the sacred spot that faithful∣ly encloseth in its bowels the body of ABEL, now compounded with clay, and waiting its portion of time to mingle with its native dust.' Thus said, he hastens towards the habitation of death—when behold, a voice from the clouds, like the ratling of provoked thunder, speaks to him with the Majesty of <HI>Omnipotence</HI>—</P>
<P>'WHERE IS ABEL THY BROTHER?'</P>
<P>Struck with horror, guilt, and fear, the infernal tempter was at hand, and insinua∣ted into him a quick reply—<HI>'I know not: am I my brother's keeper?'</HI> Immediately sentence of condign punishment was in∣flicted upon him by the GREAT JEHOVAH; and, to screen him from the dangers of
<PB N="30" REF="030283_0028_0FE5A16B951F45B8"/>the many enemies the bloody act had ex∣posed him unto from future generations, the Lord distinguished him from the rest of mankind by a guilty mark. What that mark was Scripture is silent; con∣sequently we can only form conjectures, e∣very one as their imagination leads them: If my opinion may be given, (and which I do not wish to force upon another) it was this—<HI>That conscious terror that dis∣plays itself in the countenance of every mur∣derer, when the question is confronted unto him with strong suspicions</HI>—with this im∣portant difference—<HI>that it was always ma∣nifest in the face of Cain, as the concomi∣tants of guilt to the day of his death.</HI></P>
<P>CAIN having received the chastising ma∣lediction of provoked Heaven, heavily proceeds towards the grave of ABEL: languishing as he walks, he bemoans, with grievous lamentation, the empire that sin had erected within him; and with heart∣rending complaints, on the eve of distrac∣tion, he arrives at the mournful spot! <HI>the
<PB N="31" REF="030283_0029_0FE5A1A445A8AF48"/>sad hillock of death!</HI> and, in straims of pen∣sive sadness bedewed the hallowed turf that covered the mangled body of the in∣nocent victim, with tears of inconsolable anguish—After a few minutes sobbing and bewailing his forfeited bliss over ABEL's grave he exclaims to himself—'This is forbidden ground; the sacrifice of unspot∣ted purity rests concealed under this grassy hillock; defile not the ground by thy foot∣steps, consecrated to the relicks of virtue; polluted by thy evil, 'tis now become sa∣cred by admitting into its bosom the re∣mains of perfective innocence; I must withdraw the sharpened darts of piercing remembrance wounds my soul afreth. A∣dieu, thou virtuous spot, adier! The sentence of Heaven's frowns, replete with foreboding gloom, must now be fulfilled, and CAIN be banished into regions un∣known; where penitence may produce peace, aad solitude procure lost tranquili∣ty. O wretched man! miserable CAIN! to meditate death on the endearing foun∣tain of innocence, where it never entered
<PB N="32" REF="030283_0030_0FE5A16E1CAFC7D0"/>the heart to cherish a thought tending to thy disquiet, much less thy death! exe∣crable, foul, and black the deed; yet darkness must provide thee a cell to pour out thy complaints and dedicate thy soul to Heaven. Admonition from my father may be now salutary and beneficial to me; I again return and request his advice and benediction; he will not disdain to hear my plea.'</P>
<P>Thus said, he returns to his father and mother. ADAM beheld him advancing, and drawing towards him, perceives the <HI>mark</HI> of GOD, and says—'CAIN, what is this? thy countenance has the appear∣ance of nature's transmutation! CAIN replies—'Father give ear to the words of the unhappy! CAIN thy son has seen the Lord; the decree of justice is passed; thus spake the GOD of Heaven; <HI>A fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be.</HI> Earth is for∣bidden to CAIN its encrease; the MARK of Heaven is his security from bloody men; make known unto me the path to steer my
<PB N="33" REF="030283_0031_0FE5A1A653C27CA8"/>course for calm consolation; distressful as the hour, yet welcome would be the mes∣senger of death. Can forlorn hopes, or humble acquiescence to Divine mandates dispel the turbulency of raving madness? Retaliate ADAM for the blood of ABEL, by solicitation for Heaven's permission to disunite the soul and body of CAIN. He is, he can be no more than an incum∣brance on the earth; the ground whereon his foot resteth will be defiled by the pres∣sure of his image; barrenness will proceed after the footsteps of the cursed delin∣quent. I must die? Help me to die! The sin exceeds the extent of mercy! The a∣bominable crime will not admit of Hea∣ven's favour.'</P>
<P>Thus he importunes ADAM to take a∣way his life; ADAM was silent; he again proceeds—</P>
<P>'My soul wants deliverance from the bondage of a growing sensation that holds it in captivity from the enjoyment of e∣very
<PB N="34" REF="030283_0032_0FE5A16FAF10C460"/>domestic and final endearment.'— ADAM speaks—</P>
<P>'No, Cain; the will of GOD must be obeyed.—EVE searcely recovered from her first confused state of mind at ADAM's relating the melancholy event, could barely summon fortitude enough to enter into a renewed discourse with CAIN or her husband; but she thus begins—</P>
<P>"ADAM, my spouse, my other half, let us not anticipate evil; there is an Al∣mighty Providence who ruleth all wordly mutations, and where celestial goodness deigns to protect and provide for the fee∣blest insect and twisting reptile; Comfort CAIN, that he may not plunge us into encreasing troubles by distrusting the cle∣mency of his GOD; dejection sitteth on his brow; his attitude is that of madness! Join thy feeling with mine ADAM, and let us mingle compassion with his flowing agonies—We may associate paternal pity and commiseration, as the same time we
<PB N="35" REF="030283_0033_0FE5A1ABC1D4CBB8"/>hold in destation the enormity of his crime; let not the curses of the whole crea∣tion conjunctively deprive him of our pa∣rental love.'</P>
<P>CAIN was still in a posture of deep hu∣miliation —his grief overballanced the pow∣ers of impressed nature, and his soul heavy laden with the burden of affliction; the flowing drops issue from his swollen eyes, and fall to the ground like globulets of an heavy storm, the sound of which roused ADAM and EVE from their state of deep consideration how to advise him—when suddenly, as if guided by the hand of in∣stinct, they look in the face of CAIN, and without a uttering a word, both fell pros∣trate with their faces on the earth, and moistened the grass with the dumb waters of sympathy.</P>
<P>Thus our first parents lay, deprived of the organs of speech, but with groanings and lamentations that echoed through the whole diversity of nature's delightful space; the utmost boundaries of creation were
<PB N="36" REF="030283_0034_0FE5A171EB379170"/>smitten with the uncommon sound; all the inhabitants of the forest were disturbed by the unusual echoes: The ravenous beasts of prey, the winged tribe of jocal harmony, the insects that hovered in the airy element and the little unnoticed reptile that twirls under foot, felt the effect of murder; and thrown into an unsual profound silence and terror, neither motion, voice or sound could be perceived on that side EDEN, but the broken, the plaintive accents of ADAM and EVE.</P>
<P>CAIN stood like an engraven statue of raving phrenzy, speechless, and motionless with eyes intensely fixed upon his father and mother. Thus lay the first parents of mankind; thus stands before them the first murderer in the world.</P>
<P>The sun was now declining, and draw∣ing spedily towards the close of it's daily course; The luminous brightness and warmth proceeding from the exhalations
<PB N="37" REF="030283_0035_0FE5A1AD5363F958"/>of his radiant beams, was powerfully di∣minished, and the chilling damps from the surface of the earth made their gradual and forcible approaches, so that ADAM and EVE began to experience the sensitive effects of cold and advancing night; reason being a little recovered, they arose; EVE first; she opens her lips to ADAM and speaks thus;</P>
<P>'ADAM, 'tis prudent, 'tis the counsel of discretion for us to put a restraint upon immoderate grief, and not indulge the woes of an irretrievable malady.' Then embracing ADAM as her partner in calam∣ity, she thus begins; 'ADAM my husband, the joy of my soul; see before us our first∣born, sinking under the load of dreadful expectation; although the title of parent∣al softness is forfeited, let us not withhold from him the compassion of pity; Is not that established in the bowels of our affec∣tion? What must be done? Give me les∣sons of instruction, and I will deliver them
<PB N="38" REF="030283_0036_0FE5A1780F0D7848"/>with improved admonition to our unfortu∣nate son; I can promise myself success from thy nature and ripened deliberations: be∣hold him before us! 'tis a melting scene; let us be tender towards him, it may re∣duce his soul to serenity, or we know not what a fatal moment of distraction may produce, when all the faculties are in a state of derangement; he may add iniqui∣ty to iniquity, and commit a suicide on himself; if this evil also befal us, unceasing and unavailing sorrow must accompany us all the days of our life; the pleasures of every sacred as well as moral duties will be banished from us; and all private con∣solations in our various circumstances of life will feel its effects, even in the midst of these unforeseen vicissitudes that our <HI>Maker</HI> has ordained for us to encounter; it will obstruct us in paying obedience to the Divine commands, by a continual prey∣ing upon our vital parts, rendering us in∣capable and unfit for the services required of us: besides, ADAM, thou knowest the Lord is merciful: he tempers judgment
<PB N="39" REF="030283_0037_0FE5A1AEE4FD3530"/>with clemency; there are still beams of hope left for our child; the Lord preserved <HI>us</HI> from destruction for the <HI>first</HI> transgressi∣on; we involved our children and their successive generations in sin to the end of time, or CAIN would have been a stranger to jealousy or hatred to his brother; give reflection a seat in thy bosom; May we not justly attribute a portion of CAIN's crime to our first fall? We planted the seeds of sin, he only plucked the fruit; and 'tis impossible for us in this infantile state of nature, to conceive the different kinds and qualities of fruit that will be produced from the tree of sin that we planted; they will differ widely in degrees of magnitude and circumstance; yet all, proportionable to their enormity, destructive of that primeval innocence in which we were created; Let us endeavour to relieve his depression, to administer consolation unto him, and with joyful gratulation, he will return cheer∣ful thankfulness; leave him not sinking under the weight of ingrafted impiety,
<PB N="40" REF="030283_0038_0FE5A179EC19B7F8"/>transfused into him with his mother's milk; CAIN was not the first sinner; Are not <HI>we</HI> also banished the presence of the Lord? still we have hope; let us hope also for our child. If the increase of the earth is withheld from the labours of his own til∣lage, still nature itself is abundantly suffi∣cient to supply all his wants. The Lord has rejected his future sacrifices; then CAIN need not Till the ground—Pardon is trea∣sured up in heaven for repentance, or ADAM and EVE would be now as ABEL. Speak, my husband, what words shall I utter to my son? Let me alleviate the pain, if I cannot prevent the growth of grief by sin allotted him, or it will eat deeper into his soul, beyond the penetration of paren∣tal feelings, and beyond the power of com∣passion to moliify."</P>
<P>ADAM all this time was soberly attentive to the words of EVE, but could not subdue the rising tumults of passion against CAIN, that did at intervals force itself upon him; but still he strived against the depressions
<PB N="41" REF="030283_0039_0FE5A1B1DAA5A3D8"/>that human infirmities made upon his mind; he strived in vain to stop the sources that produced sighs and moans for his child; he attempted to unbosom his mind in com∣pliance to EVE, but the power and vivacity of utterance had left him, and like a lifeless image he falls again to the earth. CAIN was no longer able to support himself under the melancholy scene, and began to ex∣claim against himself in the most poignant accents of grief—</P>
<P>'CAIN, CAIN, witness the effects of thy obduracy! consider the baneful consequen∣ces of thy lustful enmity against thy bro∣ther! Behold thy father surrendering up life to the cold mansions of mortality, by the tedious weapons of a soul wounded malady; by slow approaches to his native earth, to accompany ABEL his son in glo∣ry! behold also thy mother, with a heart softened by the melting compassion of plaintive sympathy, unable to keep within their limited bounds the watery drops, or
<PB N="42" REF="030283_0040_0FE5A17B7A7C0008"/>heart bursting sighs, turn all thy eyes to∣ward yonder spot, where resteth in peace the innocent victim of thy fury.'—He now addresses ADAM; 'My father if thou still re∣tainest life, cast thine eyes upon Cain, ere death removes his soul into the boundless regions of eternity, and banish him thy presence forever; Life is a burthen; exist∣ence is become insupportable; the cruelties of death will be a balm; it will deliver my soul from the bondage of relentless remorse and bitter torture; the execution of Hea∣ven's wrath cannot exceed the torments of a stinging conscience; Father, farewell! I die!—The hand that severed ABEL from thy bosom, shall remove CAIN from thy sight, and leave thee childless:—a similar stroke will produce a similar effect; and consequences must be left to future revela∣tion.'</P>
<P>ADAM, by a sudden emotion proceeding from those terrible words of CAIN, and trembling at the baneful project nourish∣ing in the bosom of his son, looks up, and
<PB N="43" REF="030283_0041_0FE5A1B72C8FE1F8"/>in that moment of perturbation, with the trembling of nature upon him, fell upon the neck of CAIN, and embracing him in the ecstacy of charity and love, and thus he begins;</P>
<P>'My first born! my eldest child!—As∣sume the man! be again thyself!—A fro∣zen horror has iced up my intellects in defiance of reason, and raging madness has taken possession of thee—thy irregular conceptions of things deceive thee, and will deprive thee from enjoying those suc∣cours that are reserved in heaven for the unfortunate—GOD ALMIGHTY is inge∣nuous in distributing mercy, and extendeth it as much beyond our comprehensions as beyond our deserts; and turneth not a deaf ear to the returning penitent and re∣claimed sinner.—Drive contemptuously from the recesses of thy soul all those sub∣tle and ensnaring insinuations, that are ob∣truded upon thy disordered senses by the first great revolter from heaven and decei∣ver of men—Thy life is the sole preroga∣tive
<PB N="44" REF="030283_0042_0FE5A17E2C777410"/>of GOD—let him be thy judge—let him be thy executioner—let his will be thy law; and as thy days are prolonged let thy prayer be incessant; embrace gratefully the season of life, that unweari∣ed devotion may atone for thy guilt— steadfastly adhere unto, and perseveringly discharge with close application, the duties thou hast hitherto neglected—sacrifice with grateful pleasure every vain delight that has hitherto been aiding to immerge thee in sin; and with praises devout dedicate thy future days to the shrine of morality and religion—chuse prudence for a direc∣tory in all thy desires, and let temperance be compounded with all thy gratifica∣tions; and forget not the sacred obligations due unto heaven for granting thee space to make thy peace with GOD; Such pi∣ous emotions will inspire thee with zealous fervency, and the beneficence of heaven will be more apparently visible unto thee; Almighty clemency will be more eminent∣ly manifested to thy conceptions, and thy present contracted ideas of Divine inspira∣tion
<PB N="45" REF="030283_0043_0FE5A1B8C4583A78"/>will shine with more captivating lustre in thy soul; the bright perfection of Om∣nisciency will dispel from thy breast those obscure imaginations that almost reduce thee to an inanimate Being; It is the LORD that punishes; it is the LORD that pardons; therefore let not the extremities of despair drive thee to madness; ABEL thy brother has not forfeited his right to the inheritance of heaven by his untimely dissolution; but thou, by sacrificing thy own life to the passion of terror, excludest thyself from all redemption, and cover, by the veil of suicide, all prospects of future felicity: therefore, my child, be calm; maintain a manly fortitude in thy breast; consider the conspicuity of GOD'S <HI>goodness and greatness</HI> in all the works of creation; and our chearful obedience to his precepts, is like undefiled virtue that brings with it its own reward; be watchful that thy fu∣ture conduct may not be defiled with sin, to plunge thee inevitably into the dark and horrible labyrinth of endless agony: our sins though numerous, and in magni∣tude
<PB N="46" REF="030283_0044_0FE5A18396480E48"/>astonishing yet the love of GOD to∣wards us will still be superior in <HI>justice</HI> and in <HI>mercy.</HI> 'Tis proper; 'tis needful, that thy mind shall be occasionly check∣ed with the reflection on ABEL'S death, and produce within thee some painful re∣monstrances; yet still rest thou upon thy GOD; establish piety and holiness within thee, and with laborious exertions, culti∣vate a future integrity and uprightness al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the days of thy life; Be quick, and obey the Divine mandate; seek some remote spot to take up thy dwelling amongst the inoffensive guiltless; those irrational in∣habitants of creation that are untainted with the corrupted principles of man, and by the instinct of pure nature, they may console thy plaintive accents; the luxuri∣ant branches of the grove, the variegated shrubs of the field, may, with the melody of their pliable movements, lull thy soul to repose.—Thy reflections thus encom∣passed on all sides, may, for a season, banish from thy memory the disconsolate situation of thy forsaken parents—With speed be
<PB N="47" REF="030283_0045_0FE5A1BB0E1BB990"/>gone; obey the voice of the Lord; aban∣don this spot; because loathsome by de∣jection, and find a seat of meditation more consistent with the unsettled circumstances of thy soul; shun the dwelling of ADAM and EVE, that frequent interviews with the parents of sorrow may neither impede nor restrain thee in the exercises of emu∣lation and penitence: go where contrition, gratitude, and adoration to GOD demands all the pious servitude thy lengthened days can present; relish with pleasure the duties enjoined, and let the task be delight∣ful and pleasing; and this will be a balm to thy calamity, and banish despondency from the door of thy heart, and the powers of grief gradually abate within thee—Prayer and praise will be as bulwarks unto thee to enable thee to conflict with thy oppressive imaginations; and proportionable to thy perseverance will the beatitudes of GOD be displayed. This, CAIN, is the road; these are the footsteps thou must pursue, and thy assiduity herein will be crowned with success; let not thy thoughts delude thee;
<PB N="48" REF="030283_0046_0FE5A185582D7FB8"/>for, by attempting to retaliate for ABEL'S death on any other terms, the GOD of all the earth will reject, and it will nip in the bud every appearance of irregularity with∣in thee; guard against thy heart, for know thou, it is desperately wicked, it is outrage∣ous, and requires the chains of unshaken resolution to keep it in subjection, and within the bounds of moderation; thou knowest what is good, and hast already experienced the knowledge of evil; curb all passions, and permit no vice to reign predominant within thee; be <HI>watchful</HI> that Satan may have no dominion over thee. Cherish these admonitions of thy father, and virtue will still add reverence to thy years; and thy lengthened days will be accompanied with hopes to the grave. CAIN, thy father has discharged his duty, and bids thee farewell—<HI>Farewell, my child!'</HI></P>
<P><HI>'My father, farewell! Eve, my mother, farewell!</HI> Parents of mankind, farewell!
<PB N="49" REF="030283_0047_0FE5A1BC9E6981D8"/>EVE, unable to sustain herself under the impressive weight of affliction, thus began;</P>
<P>'My child! my first born! and must the sorrows of EVE be her annual consecra∣tion? must tears alone be her daily conso∣lation for the loss of both her sons? ADAM, review thy admonition; let not paternal counsel exceed the limits of needful pre∣caution; hast thou closed up the bowels of compassion? Canst thou reconcile thy parental feelings to thy child's continual absence? Wouldst thou exclude him for∣ever our sight? be not lost to sensation; thou spakest to CAIN, while thy eyes and thy heart was with ABEL; thy affections for the dead divested thee of sympathy for the living son: I doubt not his sincerity; all his vital parts are oppressed with convic∣tion; not a member in his whole frame that has escaped the powerful agitation; he seems inflexible on contrition; the stormy seasons of boisterous mutations are gone and past; he detests his crime, and long∣eth to seek refuge in the bosom of peni∣tence;
<PB N="50" REF="030283_0048_0FE5A1C0551E5B58"/>his future days will be regulated by the standard of truth; and holiness and righteousness be established within him forever; as thou spakest unto him with se∣renity, he listened to his father with in∣struction, and the sage counsel of years had the desired effect: Can there be danger? May not our child, at the expiration of revolving seasons return again to his dis∣consolate Parents, and chear their droop∣ing spirits, by removing their deep root∣ed grief? We shall then be joyful witnes∣ses of his improving accomplishments; we shall see him growing to perfection in the knowledge and practice of those duties that constitute happiness and peace of mind, and ADAM and EVE be partakers of CAIN'S tranquility; it must gladden the hearts of his parents to behold the happy change; a pleasing confirmation; and en∣livening to our souls and in the midst of solitude create in us a rapturous devotion to celebrate praises to Heaven! those ob∣stacles of gloomy doubtfulness that will at
<PB N="51" REF="030283_0049_0FE5A204CCECA3B8"/>intervals intrude upon our moments of re∣tirement, will be kept at a reasonable dis∣tance, as is requisite for our more serious performance of religious duties, and ren∣dering our services in obedience to the Al∣mighty will; it will strengthen our forti∣tude to encounter patiently all those afflic∣tive smarts that will occasionally dart into our souls, and occupy the recesses of our hearts, almost unmolested; and thus, from groundless fears, we shall accumulate upon ourselves real evils; we are, as well as CAIN, strangers to the inward workings of heaven; neither know we the secret in∣tentions of the Lord in these things.'</P>
<P>'ADAM, speak again to CAIN—press upon him his zealous obedience to his co∣venanted GOD, and solemnly remind him of his renewed engagements; and when the melodious voice of peace has established its dwelling within him, and he finds his soul purified with calm and holy gladness, and an uninterrupted converse with heav∣en, has procured him a sweet complacency
<PB N="52" REF="030283_0050_0FE5A1C281D3AE90"/>of mind, he may, thus prepared for our embraces, return to his parents again, and, under the auspices of Heaven's favour, pay the duties of filial gratitude unto us; this will cheer us under hourly depressions, and give us comfort in our acquiescence to Providence—we can be aiding unto him by a cultivation of virtuous seeds in his mind; the beneficence of Providence will become more conspicuous unto him; and his ideas of heaven be more enlarged, and refined, and fitted for the digestion of Di∣vine revelation. Speak thus, ADAM to the child of thy bosom, it will be salutary to the heart of thy wife.'</P>
<P>ADAM at this last and earnest solicitati∣on of EVE, seemed to be wrought upon by her arguments, and inclined to charity to∣wards CAIN—he drew such conclusions from her words as had weighty influence upon his own judgment, and thus began again to discourse with CAIN—</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="030283_0051_0FE5A2384B4F9588"/>
'My son, is there yet a branch of vir∣tue left within thee? or one grain of seed centered within thee, not yet burried in the bowels of evil, whereon thy father may place a shadow of hope? is there yet a va∣cuity unoccupied by the flames or ashes of sin, that a virtuous deed may take possessi∣on?' CAIN answereth—</P>
<P>What sayest thou my father!' ADAM replies—</P>
<P>'What are the emotions of thy heart? is there a stability in thy vows to Heaven? Do unshaken resolutions and firmness of mind unite together to oppose the en∣croachments of thy soul, that have hither∣to put all mortality to defiance?' CAIN, with broken acccents and words scarce in∣telligible, replies to ADAM;</P>
<P>'Father, suspect me not: a second evil cannot be produced from a first that is final∣ly eradicated, root and branch; the malig∣nancy
<PB N="54" REF="030283_0052_0FE5A1C4163D38D8"/>of sin is apparent unto CAIN in all its odious deformities, and the rebellious fiend is subdued by all the arrows of convic∣tion; his former insinuations are abolished and beome annihilated in CAIN; religion shall reign as sovereign over the empire of his soul and supplications to Heaven shall never cease: reason beginneth to abound and stedfastness of thought remain∣eth with him: CAIN knoweth that to as∣spire towards Heaven is to be humble at the footstool of its throne; <HI>Sin</HI> has been compounded with all CAIN'S actions; but is not <HI>mercy</HI> tempered with <HI>God's justice?</HI> shame is visible in my countenance, and the <HI>mark</HI> of conscious guilt condemns me; so shall my repentance be demonstra∣ted by simplicity; to GOD I will apply; by GOD will the necessary succours be admi∣nistered; persecutions from men shall not sink me, nor tribulations of conviction weigh me down; to shameful actions I will be estranged, that creation may not again blush at my guilt; moderation shall be the regulator of my desires; and my petitions
<PB N="55" REF="030283_0053_0FE5A2065C26AE28"/>justifiable, that they may be accepted, and return unto me bountiful, and the bles∣sings impressed on me with grateful joy; CAIN can defy Satan; the helmet of Hea∣ven is proof against his assaults, and cou∣rageously can he combat the tempter; seduc∣tion shall no more invite him, nor perfidy any more harrass him; discontent shall no longer abide with him, nor sadness damp his chearfulness.' Here CAIN ended, and again addressed his father with a fare∣well; Parent, farewel! again I bid adieu to this spot of rural innocence, and fly to regions unknown".</P>
<P>CAIN, my child! my blessing! and may the presence and munificence of Almighty benediction await thee, and accompany thee to the retirements of solitude! Fare∣well! farewell.!</P>
<P>EVE now approached towards CAIN, with the sinking steps of paternal affections and maternal feelings, and almost drowned in tears of sympathetic tenderness, drop∣ping
<PB N="56" REF="030283_0054_0FE5A1C5D4839A28"/>almost imperceptibly from her over∣flown eyes, not able to contain the heart-feeling moisture, while she took a fainting embrace from her child.</P>
<P>'EVE,' says ADAM, 'our son is now taking his leave of this beautiful spot; let us hope the remembrance of it will be en∣graved on his bosom, and chear him in his moments of devotion.'</P>
<P>'My child!' my child!' said EVE, and down she dropped, unable to proceed; ADAM raised her on her knees.</P>
<P>'What says the wife of my bosom? Speak to thy son.' Heaven accompany him, said she, and down she fell. ADAM again raised her, and she faintsin his arms. CAIN ran to a murmuring brook and bro't water, and sprinkled on the face of his mo∣ther; she came to herself, and began;</P>

Fare∣well, my child! farewell! ADAM again embraces him; and with the language of sorrow, scarcely articulate, speaks unto him:</P>

<P>ADAM and EVF, both together, at this instant, like the voice of one soul, without looking at CAIN, cried out—'<HI>Adieu, our child! adieu!</HI></P>

<P>THE irregular imaginations that now succeeded each other in the mind of CAIN gave all nature the appearance of a new creation; every visible object strikes anaw∣ful consideration into his soul; he soon be∣gins to collect his scattered reason, and to bring to mind the state from whence he was fallen, and to pacify his soul by a composed reconcilement to the inflictive chastisement of GOD, and with calm forti∣tude submit to these dispensations of Pro∣dence; and thus began to commune with himself:</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030283_0058_0FE5A1CC91513E28"/>
'I am still an inhabitant amongst, al∣though a stranger to the <HI>beauties</HI> of creati∣on —Where will my wandering footsteps lead me? A solemn and sad silence must be my nightly as well as daily companion; and the peaceful habitation of ADAM and EVE will produce renewed bitterness to my reflections; I would hope for consolation; then says ADAM my father, 'build thy expectations upon penitence.' 'Religion is my aim; then says EVE my mother, cultivate an acquaintance with thy GOD! Peace of mind I would compound with lengthened days; then conscience tells me, 'to plant the seeds of contrition with dou∣ble care, and daily water them with the tears of remorse, and thou shalt reapt the fruit of tranquility; petition Heaven, the source of good, and its spiritual essence will not be denied thee; let an emulative increase of virtuous actions prompt thee forward, and thou wilt attain a sufficiency of power to withstand and accumalate a portion of pious resignation, to enable thee to encounter courageously with all the

<P>Pausing a while to rest himself, he says again, CAIN be silent; thy phrenzy is

<PB N="63" REF="030283_0061_0FE5A212E51DCCF0"/>adoration; the more extensive my surveys, the more confirmed are my speculations, that all the beauties of the world are only comparative shadows to the majesty of thy works; all nature, except man, answers the purpose of its creation; Oh! could the horrors of recollection be erased from my mind, that there ever existed a second son of ADAM—then the clouds of anguish would be dissipated from CAIN—These are the hopes of delusion—these are the phantoms that oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upy the brain—<HI>Night,</HI> cloathed in mournful obscurity, is near at hand—darkness may administer a relax, tho' not produce a deprivation of my anx∣ietes —Softly I tread the tender herbage and stane the blades with the crimson hue of guilty blood—presently all nature will be hushed in solemn sadness, and every re∣proachful object be hid in the mournful mansions of visible obscurity.</P>
<P>'I will embrace the season to diffu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gratitude to my Maker, and for a moment
<PB N="64" REF="030283_0062_0FE5A1D036C0C4F8"/>bid adieu to wretchdness, and my vital parts experience a short relax from the sen∣sations of external accusers, and seek con∣solation at the footstool of GOD: shallow as my finite comprehensions are there may be some rays of <HI>infinite</HI> love reserved for me, and ere the morning sun again illumi∣nate the boundless plains of nature, the voice of instruction may descond from hea∣ven to direct my fugitive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a conve∣nient asylum; (to rescue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the numerous tribes of wounded complainants that will make their appearance with the rising sun) and concealed under the wings of Almighty protection, struggle only with the tremblings and pangs that are become as united companions to my conscience!—Night is come!—thou art welcome! Alas I deceive myself! there is another interval of feeble light, and the gloominess of night diminishes! the moon penetrates through the opening clouds, and I can behold my own shadow! then I must not prognosticate peace; patience must longer abide with me, and let me draw instructive lessous from the vicissitudes of the evening; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="65" REF="030283_0063_0FE5A214F07AD3E0"/>vanity to be lavish of my hopes; 'tis sin∣ful to exalt my ignoble expectations; and transported views will only plunge me in∣to deeper misery—my sins are manifest; retaliation is requisite; and vain thoughts and disguised comfort must be kept at a becoming distance; their dangerous ten∣dency my soul has woefully felt; their dis∣mal effects have already severely smarted me.</P>
<P>'What have been hitherto the days of the years of CAIN? Ignorance and folly began them, pain and sorrow now attend them—preserve the end of them O LORD, from everlasting destruction. Thou art <HI>merciful,</HI> make me supplicating—thou art <HI>glorious,</HI> make me humble—thou art <HI>gra∣cious,</HI> make me thankful. If CAIN cannot restore the life of ABEL, teach him how to obtain remission for the crime; actuate him by a lively improvement in religion, that thy <HI>glory</HI> may be celebrated by his humiliation; and stimulated by conviction
<PB N="66" REF="030283_0064_0FE5A1D7B0C73E60"/>may keep in due exercise all his rational faculties for the promulgation of holiness and righteousness in his soul, so that at the last he may arrive to a peaceful tranquility?</P>
<P>Thus communed CAIN with himself as he soberly drew forward into the thicken∣ing grove; when suddenly a rustling among the interwoven branches, with an hideous howl, obstructed his progress and struck an icy chillness into his whole frame; but supported by the power of faith in his GOD, he ventures on, and faintly beheld the beautiful spots that curiously adorned the untamed and ferocious <HI>Leopard,</HI> whose ferocity itself was reduced to a state of pa∣nic terror at the sight of MAN! such de∣struction had <HI>sin</HI> made on the irrational ideas of the brute creation. CAIN with consternation beheld him, and the terrifi∣ed beast makes half stares in return, with eyes sparkling with savage voracity, eager to devour, but fearful to attack, the disturber of his rest, and with stern looks and a hid∣eous roar, he turns tail and flies affrighted
<PB N="67" REF="030283_0065_0FE5A2184886C510"/>into the wood. Every concomitant of a∣larming apprehensions now possessed CAIN'S imaginations, and no commiseration near, nor consoling friend to participate in his fears, and he thus speaks to himself;</P>
<P>Vain conceptions deceive me; there are mutations requisite in the nature of CAIN that requires the wisdom and pow∣er of <HI>Omnipotence</HI> to bring to pass; terror will still accompany guilt—My soul is con∣founded within me; the frightful mon∣ster discomposed all my contemplations, and substituted an impression of dread; the hardened, the premeditated impiety of CAIN precludes all self abilities to re∣claim; the performance exceeds the lim∣its of his intellectual capacities; it cannot be done without the aid of <HI>Heaven.</HI> A wretched outcast, a notorious delinquent, cannot become virtuous unless the change is conducted through the channel of Hea∣ven!— Can the thoughts? can the actions of one be pure whose conduct was never regulated by an upright rule? Can a
<PB N="68" REF="030283_0066_0FE5A1D99ACD1580"/>fratricide become a moral of perfection? O CAIN! contract thy ideas of future hap∣piness —extend not thy hopes beyond due deliberation; repentance must be the un∣wearied productions of time; thy flatter∣ing expectations of solitude may deceive thee; it may prove unto thee as dreaming delusions—Ages to come cannot recom∣pense what is past. Hast thou tears in store sufficient to wash the vessel of thy enormities clean? Canst thou render up unto GOD sacrifices of affliction propor∣tionable to thy brother's blood? Let not thine eyes be blinded; hide not the se∣crets of thy heart from thyself: leave not a vacuum; permit not a cavity to remain unsearched, that dark conclusions may not abide with thee. Can a <HI>Leopard</HI> affright thee? How then facest thou thy GOD that in a moment can crush thee? Thou attemptest to draw realities from almost im∣probabilities; before another setting sun all nature may be to thee as nothing—Degrade not thy present knowledge with darkened prospects; for thy first enemy
<PB N="69" REF="030283_0067_0FE5A21AB8B43858"/>is still assailing thee under different disguis∣es.' Into this discomposed state was the soul of CAIN thrown by the equally af∣frighted beast, and self accusations against himself; and from the effects of gloomy apprehensions, and fear of repeated tempta∣tions, his calmness and serenity had again forsaken him, and thus was his mind in∣cumbered with foreboding disasters; he softly and fearfully passes the entangled branches, which retarded his cautions mo∣tions by their twisted fibres; he again be∣gan to talk with himself—</P>
<P>'This place is peculiarly adapted to a contemplative and innocent mind—What sayest thou CAIN?—<HI>Innocence!</HI>—Thou hast forfeited that inheritance; It may be recoverable.'</P>
<P>The sable cloathing of darkness had now almost extinguished the feeble light that at intervals penetrated through the opening clouds, and he looks about for a thickened covert, wherein to take his
<PB N="70" REF="030283_0068_0FE5A1DBAABAF318"/>night's repose; and at a small distance perceived an enclosure uncommonly close, composed of brambles and woodbines, and briars, so firmly united, it represented to his view, by the help of glimmering light, an arbour of shrubby sweetness; 'Here concealed,' says he, 'I may get ease from affliction.' As cautiously and softly as he trod the dewy moss, yet still with an im∣pressive consternation he perceived that almost every step produced a discord amongst the interwoven branches; the harmless feathered tribe experienced the unusual disturbance by the sudden emotion and movements of the pliable twigs, where∣on they had perched to bid adieu to the universal harmony of the day, and enjoy in silent peace their nightly repose! the whole family of the little melodious choris∣ters was alarmed and terrified, and, as quick as their half opened eyes would permit endeavoured to extricate themselves from the leaves and branches, and haste a re∣moval; and with timorous motions, mak∣ing their escape with scarce extended wing
<PB N="71" REF="030283_0069_0FE5A21CEDCF0530"/>hopping from twig to twig, till the enemy of their peace, the encroacher upon their quiet asylum, had made a further progress, and got beyond their tender sensations; at the same time the savage race, the un∣tamely brood of four-footed creatures, slowly quit their dreadful coverts for the unwelcome guest, with eyes fiercely rag∣ing, and stubborn reluctance, turn round, and almost bid him defiance; and, with countenance ferociously aghast, boldly stare to behold the cause of the general conster∣nation; timorous to encounter yet vora∣ciously eager to devour, the untimely in∣truder. The threatening aspects of those enraged animals, struck additional horror into his soul, weakened his resolutions, and even staggered his most courageous fortitude; while the smaller works of cre∣ation, the diminutive infects, that thought to have, as usual, slept in peaceful dark∣ness amongst the warm and pliant leaves, felt also the untimely shock, and with the sudden bending of the boughs, tumbled by swarms from their easy rest, and fell
<PB N="72" REF="030283_0070_0FE5A1DD37ED0440"/>as innocent victims in multitudes to his mer∣ciless tread; some instantaneously crush∣ed to death, and others left in helpless ago∣nies under the pangs of wounds and mang∣led limbs beyond the healing of nature's kind restorative; and the twisting rep∣tiles for which <HI>Providence</HI> had provided a comfortable canopy from the inclemency of the seasons under the thick mossy grass and autumnal leaves, that lay in heaps like little mountains on the ground, even these experienced the tremendous commo∣tion; and with the sagacity of their na∣tures, took refuge under the sturdy roots of sternly oaks, creeping amongst the clos∣est twinings of the spreading bottom, where the cruel foot-steps of the enemy could not penetrate, nor the weight of his guilty carcase impress with dire effect.</P>
<P>CAIN, during this time, ruminating se∣riously on the unprovoked attack he had made upon the awful sience of creation, and how effectually, though undesigned∣ly, he had effected an enmity between man
<PB N="73" REF="030283_0071_0FE5A21E86F66110"/>and the works of GOD, the whole crea∣tion becoming detestably fearful and un∣willingly subservient unto him. Reason began now to assist him in his contempla∣tions, and he makes an halt amidst the un∣settled inhabitants of the grove, and delibe∣rately pausing on the evil he had caused amongst them, concluded that himself must escape danger, while all creatures seemed to dread him. The aspect of the moon's rays was now become scarce visible; lit∣tle more than a bare glimmering shadow of light, hardly perceptible through the thick entanglements of the wood, and soft∣ly and slowly he draws towards the close enclosure—'it may be,' says he, 'the nightly covert of some ravenous beast;' —And with cautious magnanimity he se∣parates the almost jointed leaves, and sur∣veys with narrow inspection the desirous, yet fearful place; silence seemed to be wrapped up in its obscurity; the motions or breathings of life could not be perceiv∣ed; even air itself was almost prohibited
<PB N="74" REF="030283_0072_0FE5A1E0C079F2C0"/>admission; so close, so joined, was this so∣litary recess on all sides; the more tender and flexible branches he gradually remov∣ed, and gained an entrance into this seat of pensive silence; and with conscientious congratulations to <HI>Providence</HI> for protec∣tion, he entered the quiet and peaceful retreat, and calmly composed himself for retirement with the inhabitants of the wood. —Thus meeting with no obstruction by art or nature, to discourage or discompose him, he first addresses his <HI>Maker</HI> in strains of humble ejaculations; and then laid him down to rest with that pleasing sensation that frequently accompanies and is conju∣gal with fatigued nature, and undisturbed falls into a profound sleep—Veiled as the ordinations of Heaven were towards him, he rests on the soft and untrodden moss in sacred security.</P>
<P>Thus sleeps CAIN, under the luxuriant branches, regardless of danger, with the complacency of innocence, till night had finished its appointed course, and the en∣livening
<PB N="75" REF="030283_0073_0FE5A22430B8CF10"/>rays of the morning sun began to dart its refreshing beams through the narrow openings of the disjointed branches and forewarned CAIN against too long in∣dulgence; the diligent messenger of Hea∣ven was discharging his Creator's errand, by making his daily circuit round the uni∣versal expanse; the earliest little songsters had begun to chaunt the morning praises to their Maker, with the grateful melody of united concord harmoniously delight∣ful; the thrilling voices and native accents proceeding from their warbling throats, awoke the pensive sleeper, and summoned him to the duties of awakening day; CAIN looks around him and minutely inspects his humble mansion, and thus begins to reason with himself;</P>
<P>'There must be a bounteous, a merci∣ful munificence in the dispensations of Pro∣vidence! This shall be the abode of CAIN; the desolate will here take up his dwelling; he may here diminish his grief, and enjoy
<PB N="76" REF="030283_0074_0FE5A1E37123F0D8"/>a <HI>portion</HI> if not a <HI>permanency</HI> of solitary con∣solation; he can uninterruptedly revere the <HI>justice</HI> and admire the <HI>goodness</HI> of GOD; and remembrance of iniquities past may check future ingratitude and folly.'</P>
<P>Thus CAIN communeth with himself and arranges his fancies and resolutions into a state of regularity, and then postrates him∣self before GOD, humbly and servently sup∣plicating his benignity and influence to en∣able him to accomplish the desires of his soul; 'I know,' says he, 'before I can by rectitude arrive to the notice of Heaven, I must, in the posture of humility, first learn to abominate myself with contrition at the footstool of it; <HI>I know, O God, thy knowledge is impenetrable; that all the in∣ward motions of my heart are within thy prescience, ere they are fulfilled, and the mysteries of futurity are appointed by thy unerring decrees; nothing can pass thy Om∣nisciency unnoticed, or escape the transcen∣dant depth of thy wisdom, infinite in itself, and infinitely beyond all human conception;
<PB N="77" REF="030283_0075_0FE5A2260FBA17B0"/>therefore, O God, bestow such a portion of thy beatitudes upon me as is necessary, and bless it unto me for good; teach me how to bend myself before thee with submissive re∣verence; calm the stormy tempests of my soul, and let scenes of evil be no longer nourished in my breast.</HI>'</P>
<P>He now arises from the ground and ad∣dresses the birds of the air, and the air it∣self —'Be silent, ye chearful inhabitants of the grove; chaunt not your harmonious voices, ye inoffensive warblers, and give a respite to your little musical throats for a season; and ye boistrious and powerful winds, for a time be still; let not your convulsive accents pursue me rigorously into the doleful habitation of sadness? disturb not my ejaculations by your irregular dis∣cord of sounds; and all ye, the living per∣fect works of creation, commisserate me, yet happily innocent of my wants; your established innocency screens you from all evil desires; your wishes and wants are
<PB N="78" REF="030283_0076_0FE5A1E589373120"/>reciprocally united, and one does not ex∣ceed the other; the varying discords that subsist between good and evilare yet estran∣ged, and have not imbibed corruption amongst you; the beauteous boundaries of creation you can enjoy without your enjoyment being annoyed with ingrati∣tude; with minds contented you know not the bane of superfluity; you shew your gra∣titude to your Benefactor for a supply of that alone which is needful; you enjoy the good without partaking of any of the evil concomitants that sin hath compound∣ed with it; hush then, for a while, and let your silent adorations resound with me∣lodious whispers through the grove to your Maker.</P>
<P>CAIN now began to assume the rational man with lamentations for ABEL, and reflecting on his death; and with the pow∣ers of conviction upon him would cry out, '<HI>O my brother Abel! my brother Abel!</HI> couldst thou hear me, couldst thou obtain permission from Heaven to make a visiona∣ry
<PB N="79" REF="030283_0077_0FE5A2279EA34300"/>descension to look into the dark cavern of my soul, and probe the wound that preys on my vital spirits! Can love de∣scend from heaven to earth? If so, look down and administer comfort to the dejec∣ted, and apply the balm of virtue to the distressed. <HI>Nothing</HI> to be <HI>seen</HI> or <HI>heard</HI> in answer to my wishes; all is sober sad∣ness in this mournful dwelling! nothing to be perceived but uncultivated nature! nor inward encouragement, but to descry my own imperfections: Providence may see sit to suit my condition to these accom∣modations; ABEL is beyond the reach of my faultering accents; Heaven prohi∣bits the fraternal mission; I will, there∣fore with calm resignation, moderate my desires by descretionary bounds, and be not dismayed while I can have hopes in the LORD: circumspection is meet for me, and I will estimate it with due considera∣tion, these shall be my resolves, and mor∣ning and evening shall witness my punctu∣al obedience to them; I have woefully experienced the consequences of hatred,
<PB N="80" REF="030283_0078_0FE5A1E718D4EB18"/>and accursedly felt the painful stroke of anguish, and acquired a reproachful wis∣dom to detest evil. I will endeavour in this lonesome cell to make penitential restitu∣tion for ABEL's blood; and in this unfre∣quented shade dedicate my tears to that needful pursuit; and by mingling my pe∣nitence in concert with my irrational com∣pany, maintain fortitude with humility to protect me from a life miserably unfortu∣nate; commune with myself to regret less the loss of society; I would wish to improve the purposes of my banishment that the hopes of ADAM and EVE might not be frustrated; let a dilemma of fears, let a la∣byrinth of doubts intrude themselves upon me, my hopes shall not be beclouded, my expectations shall not be sunk in the pit of despondency, nor my promised comforts overwhelmed with dejection. I long for useful knowledge, and by tedious perseve∣rance and tribulation will try to attain it; I will shun busy life that temptations may not surround me, and my alarmed consci∣ence
<PB N="81" REF="030283_0079_0FE5A229AD538018"/>become proportionably unmindful; a fatiety of content cannot be expected while mixed with a croud of unweary persecu∣tors, therefore will I not hazard my pre∣sent serenity; the world may be inviting to injuries; and embarrass my soul to con∣fusion; in the moment of anger I may slay my brother's advocate, for the reproaches, of the scornful will be very inflicting, and the guilty are restless under contempt; my infantile reasoning is not yet capable of measuring the dimensions of provoked in∣veteracy; I will not join the latter off∣spring of ADAM and thus escape the shafts of their calumny; nor shall their bitter language wound my feelings; my grievous spirit none of them will heal; while their pointed arrogancy will court my frowning observations without alleviation; my sighs will be their melody, and with my own la∣mentations will they torment me, and make my days miserable for want of pity and commiseration.'</P>
<P>Thus reasoneth the forsaken fratricide
<PB N="82" REF="030283_0080_0FE5A1E9B3D39018"/>with himself to shun society; and though he is grievously doubtful of his own re∣solves, yet scrupulously exact in his endea∣vors; striving to command himself with judgment, while he suspects himself of the power of obedience; and thus successive ideas takes their revolutions in his mind, and passes promiscuously over his self-re∣proaching soul. 'I must not,' said he, 'by despondency, defeat my pursuits after wisdom; I have variegated nature in this uncorrupted abode of solitude to melio∣rate my heart with noble and delicious im∣pressions, 'tis a situation transcendantly conspicuous for contemplation, and where folly will scarce gain admission; here will I begin to become acquainted with sacred piety, and enter into an indissoluble union and communion with my innocent and me∣lodious companions, whose daily adora∣tions to their Maker give motion to the pliable branches with the energy of their vocal praises.</P>
<P>O ye chearful inhabitants of the grove,
<PB N="83" REF="030283_0081_0FE5A22F9A0EB338"/>admit me into your social society, and ac∣commodate me with a portion of your re∣creating virtnes.' CAIN now softens his calamities with hopes of peace, and walks the wood to see how far its produce was productive of those necessaries consistent with his situation; he was soon convinced nature had been prolific, and in an ample manner provided all things needful for his support—this revived his soul—gratitude here required no deliberation; and after offering that sacrifice, he began to partake of nature's repast, without reluctance. Plentifully did the fruits of various kinds yield their juicy contents for his refresh∣ment. Calm serenity now occupied his breast, and a tranquil resignation compo∣sed him to his fate—he found the spot to be calculated for the indulgence of reflec∣tion and improvement of reason.'</P>
<P>Thus we leave him under the protecti∣on of Heaven, improving under the privi∣leges of solitude for <HI>days,</HI> and <HI>months,</HI> and <HI>years;</HI> and the bounties of Nature suppli∣ed
<PB N="84" REF="030283_0082_0FE5A1ED0C0ECAC0"/>all his wants.—But even in this pro∣mising state of tranquil peace the first Great Tempter found him out. 'Twas at the close of day when sable darkness was approaching, the whole creation hush∣ed in solemn silence, and every living crea∣ture had bid adieu to activity for the night, that CAIN was raised from a religious le∣thargy of pious contemplations by a <HI>shrill</HI> and <HI>uncommon</HI> sound, like the voice of a <HI>spirit,</HI> but <HI>inarticulate,</HI> like the words of a <HI>man,</HI> but <HI>incomprehensible;</HI> and darkness was become a total deprivation of percep∣tion; the sound came nearer, and like the voice of softness entered his ear:
<Q>'Cain, Cain, I am an ambassador from Heaven; haste and obey the voice of thy God.'</Q></P>
<P>CAIN looks and feels, but nothing could be seen or felt; and being by years of meditation prepared for the <HI>infernal</HI> at∣tack, he spoke in this wise; Who art thou? What is thy mission?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="030283_0083_0FE5A23141AD42A0"/>
The spirit replies—<HI>'I am commissioned by the God of Heaven to conduct thee thi∣ther —Thy penitence is accepted—thy mor∣tification is no longer needful; follow me; the regions of eternal delight await thee; the atiributes of</HI> GOD <HI>are</HI> justice <HI>and</HI> mer∣cy; <HI>he delighteth not in punishment; easily offended, easily appeased; thy iniquities are forgiven, and he is pacified.'</HI></P>
<P>CAIN spake—'Whose voice? What worda can those be? Art thou a messen∣ger from ABEL'S GOD? If so, why com∣est thou in gloomy darkness? Assume the brightness and lustre of an <HI>angel,</HI> to put thy questionable visit out of all doubt—command this spot of obscurity to be im∣mediately transformed into a pleasing trans∣parency, to display thy angelic visage, and lead me were thou wilt.'</P>
<P>The evil one again maketh answer—<HI>'The Almighty has appointed thy journey through the regions of darkness, to enjoy the mansions of eternal light.'</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030283_0084_0FE5A1EF387487A8"/>
'If so,' says CAIN, 'let the light of thy glory direct my footsteps—measure unto me the unbounded space to heaven, and circumscribe its dimensions ere I quit my peaceful retreat.'</P>
<Q>'Cain thy conceptions of etherial tracts are disordered: the path lays wide through deserts unknown.'</Q>
<P>'Be gone, thou <HI>hellish fiend!</HI> thy own arguments betray thee! Return from whence thou camest! I am no longer thine —Go, and feast ubon the bitter remorse of self conviction, and leave my soul at ease.'</P>
<P>The resolutions of CAIN were effectual —the tempter was overcome, and in dark∣ness again departed; the long preparatory contemplations and dependence upon GOD enabled CAIN to render all his machina∣tions abortive. Having thus escaped the powerful insinuations of the devil, he ren∣ders up to Heaven his grateful adorations for the deliverance, and lays him down to
<PB N="87" REF="030283_0085_0FE5A232D1BEF800"/>sleep, and composedly enjoyed that refresh∣ing repose which his oppressed spirits re∣quired; he awoke in the morning with the early lark and the rising sun; and the clearness of the atmosphere foretold a plea∣sing day.</P>

<HEAD>CAIN's LAMENTATIONS <HI>OVER ABEL.</HI> BOOK THE THIRD.</HEAD>
<P>CAIN now quits his bower, and mu∣sing, walks to the boundaries of the wood, to enjoy without obstruction the beauties of opening day; and looking towards the delightful EDEN, (from whence he was ba∣nished) even to the utmost limits of crea∣tion's horizon, as far as eyes could trace, an object uncommon attracted his attentive notice; the yet feeble rays of the sun beams presented to his views a deep wounding re∣flective appearance—What did he see? What did he imagine he really saw thro' the resplendency of the morning's infant
<PB N="89" REF="030283_0087_0FE5A2355B032558"/>brightness? At an immense distance, a space almost exceeding occular demonstra∣tion, he beheld in the starry orb a <HI>coelestial harbinger</HI>—he cries out, moved by the different passions of <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>fear,</HI> 'Art <HI>thou a messenger of peace?'</HI> Again he turns his eyes from beholding, then again assu∣meth courage, and ventures on a retrospec∣tive glance, and ruminates in his mind up∣on all the works of creation, to draw some comparative conclusion, and bring his soul into a state of steady composure; but he found the higher his conceptions aspired, the lower did his real attainments sink, for all nature dwindled into nothing in his sight, when compared to the illustrious <HI>Guest;</HI> and with exalted rapture and aston∣ishment, he opens his lips towards <HI>Hea∣ven</HI>—' 'Tis an <HI>angel!</HI> he bringeth com∣fort unto CAIN! Tidings of joy are visible even in his distant visionary deportment; he cometh to extend the bounties of heal∣ing to the wounded, and scatter the seeds of admiration amongst the roots of peace
<PB N="90" REF="030283_0088_0FE5A1F69F3ED338"/>—the GOD of Heaven has desigued to hear my contrition—the tributes of peni∣tence are not rejected.'</P>
<P>The angel makes but slow advances, as if prohibited by the injunctions of his Mak∣er, fulfilling the divine appointment with majestic obedience, and delivers his mes∣sage at a stately distance, with an implicit diligence and profound silence. Thus was CAIN, whose heart was wont to be im∣pregnable to the voice of humanity and filial pity, rendered tractable and soft by the penetration of the <HI>caelestial</HI> monitor; for some time his eyes were intent upon the ground, unable to speak for past reflec∣tions; and then again he reasonably com∣munes with himself, and speedily hastens forward, and soon lost sight of the solitary dwelling—as he runs he ruminates—'This omen,' says he, 'cannot portend evil; the wrath of offended justice cannot be execu∣ted under such a promising disguise—my soul, be thou quiet? <HI>passion</HI> and <HI>despair,</HI> fly from me! <HI>despondency</HI> and <HI>doubts,</HI> bid
<PB N="91" REF="030283_0089_0FE5987AACA006C8"/>me adieu; and thou, my <HI>invisible foe,</HI> the first instigator of my sin, deceive me not; attempt not again to allure me by thy va∣rious transformations—I am no longer groaning under thy captivating bondage; nor shall the fetters of thy malicious moc∣keries any more entangle my feet.—thy snaring cords are cut asunder, and to thy envious malevolence I can bid defiance— Take thy beguiling rounds, and circum∣scribe earth, air, and seas, with thy revolu∣tions, and assume the most tempting allure∣ments sensation can conceive, yet still thy counterfeit perfections shall be scornfully rebuked, and shunned with reproach; even if thy transformation is accompanied with an angelie aspect will I be scrupulous∣ly doubtful, and the designing menaces of thy invisible working shall redound upon thy ownhead.' CAIN now became silent∣ly musing, and his mind sedate, on the pleasure of his own reflections over SATAN —Still did the bright <HI>image of glory</HI> remain in the expanded aether; and as the sun

The sun had now turned towards its decline, to make room for approaching night, and CAIN, looking towards his guardianangel, perceived a proportionable diminution of the illustrious smile which brought the following considerations to his mind: 'And will the favourable op∣portunity of a communication with Hea∣ven to be lost with the expiring course of one fun's daily race?

<P>As these impressive emotions and con∣sternations gave way to calm and tempo∣rate reasoning, he began to enjoy a serene state of mind, and peace flowed abundant∣ly into his foul; and again looking towards the bright embassador of joy in the firma∣ment, he very intently viewed, and with accurate discernment, observed more ex∣plicitly the spiritual visage; and stedfastly looking he descried some famt represen∣tations of <HI>Man,</HI> surrounded with the spark∣ling lustre—undaunted, and with manly fortitude he gazes, and with eyes devoted to further useful and necessary discoveries,

<P>The power of the sun was now much diminished—its warmth and heat wen rapidly declining; and its forcible effects on CAIN'S perceptions was much abated he could therefore look more distinctly through its feeble orbs, and by clear dis∣cernment from his conjectures on the <HI>an∣gelic host:</HI> He looks; he is amazed, as the missionary of Heaven becomes more and more visible; his whole frame was in a pleasing, and at the same time astonished agitation; and every step he advances brings to his ideas more proof of the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lestial Ambassador;</HI> it both surprised and

Here CAIN ended his address to Heaven.</P>
<P>Being now suitably prepared in his mind for the <HI>divine mission,</HI> he turned his eyes towards the sky, and behold, what did he see but the <HI>angel of God near</HI> him! With undaunted fortitude he looks, and with a feeble timidity at intervals of no long im∣pression, was exalted in his raptures, and tranquil in his meditations; the effects of terror were of no force;—recollection would presently assume its natural vivacity and receive renewed exaltation; reason convinced him that the coelestial guest was a forerunner of glad tidings, and these considerations were as a barrier unto him against every intruding and disagreeable impression that the temptations of the de∣vil could make upon him; and with a con∣scientious confidence on the Omnipotency of his MAKER, he boldly and chearfully, without the embarrassment of fear, faces the ambassador of Heaven, and distinctly descerning the resemblance and glorified, features, he with a sudden emotion over his
<PB N="104" REF="030283_0102_0FE5988BCB022550"/>whole body, and his soul in uncommon agitation, cries out—</P>
<P><HI>'Great God of Heaven, support me!—hide me! shelter me! deliver me from death! What do I see? My brother! Abel, my brother!'</HI> and down he fell prostrate upon the ground, before the spirit of ABEL.</P>
<P>ABEL, gently descending from the open∣ing clouds, softly whispers into his ear, with the voice of real sympathy and love—'<HI>Cain, my brother!</HI> Arise, anger findeth no dwelling in Heaven—malice is forbid∣den to enter that holy residence; no envy, no embittered hatred is cherished in the bosom of ABEL; remembrance of past evils can find no footing amongst Saints; the excellencies of glory are allotted to A∣BEL, and the GOD thereof can secure a re∣version of its beauties for CAIN his bro∣ther. Clemency is an attribute of the Deity, and an unexhausted treasure of mer∣cy is reserved in store for unfeigned peni∣tence; GOD is in himself the source, the
<PB N="105" REF="030283_0103_0FE5A285F7ABFBD0"/>fountain of benignity and love; thy pray∣ers, CAIN, thy groans, thy constancy, thy resolutions have gained admittance with∣in the gates of glory—ABEL thy brother is the commissioned messenger of Infinity, to administer comfort and dispel the anxi∣eties that at times disquiet thee—my bro∣ther, arise; arise my brother; give ear to the words of Heaven; be attentive to the voice of gladness, and welcome in thy breast the language of peace—thy sacrifi∣ces have been acceptable; thy offerings of forrowful tears have not been rejected; and thy repentance has been pleasing at the <HI>altar</HI> of GOD. CAIN, CAIN, my bro∣ther, arise—waste not the minutes of im∣portance—embrace the useful consultati∣on—reject not the happiness of consolation nor lose the season of mutual forgiveness; receive with grateful tributes of joy the necessary admonition that may be condu∣cive to the establishment of thy future peace; let ABEL communicate joy to thy soul, and participate in the fulness of bliss that awaits him; O that ABEL could
<PB N="106" REF="030283_0104_0FE598984E61BF58"/>transform the soul of CAIN, and mount him on the wings of velocity to the un∣descriable regions of inconceivable bliss.'</P>
<P>These words so ardently and affection∣ately uttered, and with the voice of an an∣gel, awakened CAIN from his impressive situation and looking up he sees ABEL in the likeness of divine brightness close by him surrounded with unspeakable beam ties of lustre, and after this manner speaks CAIN to his brother:</P>
<P>ABEL, <HI>thou child of God,</HI> my brother, what is thy mission? Wherein consisteth the pleasure of GOD through thee? Art thou appointed by the Eternal One to be the dire executioner of <HI>Almighty Justice</HI> upon thy murderer? Or art thou commis∣sioned, from the words of peace thou hast spoken to manifest his dispensations to∣wards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e for good, and to pronounce the voice of Heaven, <HI>Thy prayers are heard?</HI> Has the register of Infinity recorded my unceasing lamentations and sighs? Are my feeble resolutions strengthened by the in∣fluence
<PB N="107" REF="030283_0105_0FE5A28D82BAF598"/>of <HI>Omnipotency?</HI> Does mercy yet abound for me? Speak ABEL; hasten to deliver the Divine junction; declare spee∣dily the embassy of GOD my Judge! <HI>Fear, hope,</HI> and <HI>doubts</HI> are conjunctively working within me; thy pleasing voice, thy sooth∣ing language, with all its exhaling com∣forts, have not totally eradicated the roots of dubious suspense that at times has almost crushed me; in silence have I meditated; with languishing have I uttered the bro∣ken accents of my defective supplications; transfuse thou now into my soul the reci∣procal enjoyment of filial endearments, that CAIN may partake of some delicious transport, so will he embrace thee, and see thee as thou art; my soul panteth after knowledge, ABEL, and my spirit within me trembleth to attain that knowledge it covets. The first messenger from Heaven, since the first guilt of murder, must be an important charge: Now ABEL speak; but with the voice of a pardoning GOD, speak thou unto CAIN, and contribute tranquility to his soul; the conflict with
<PB N="108" REF="030283_0106_0FE5989A44D83FE8"/>SATAN at this minute is terrible; with all the venom of bitter rage he assaults my weaker part, to wound my hopes and con∣fidence with the weapons of despair and mistrust; but patiently I lie at the foot∣stool of my Maker.'</P>
<P>'CAIN, my brother,' replies ABEL, 'healing is in my wings; resplendent kind∣ness is my charge; thou shalt enjoy the utility of thy penitence; the throne of GOD is never shut against fervent suppli∣cations; the miseries of anguish, and the sores of lamentation will be always re∣warded by Heaven with consolations; the strength of sorrow is never permitted to be unprofitably exhausted; if thy allotted portion of experience are labour, indi∣gence, and pain, know, CAIN, 'tis the fruits of the first sin, concentered in the enjoyments of all mankind; be thou there∣fore comforted, and contentment and peace will spontaneously shoot forth and surround thee in the midst of solitude.

<P>This encouraging language revived the spirits of CAIN, and he found the evil as∣sailant become proportionably weakened, and speaks again to ABEL—'Proceed my brother'—'Knowest thou and be∣lievest thou this CAIN, that thy evil ad∣versary, and the spirit of GOD cannot at the same time gain peaceful dwelling in thy soul?'—''Tis so my brother.'—'Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cest thou thy hopes on this, CAIN?—P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st thou thus believe, my brother?'—'ABEL, I believe.'—, Then there is mercy for thee, my brother, whilst thou thus strive against the deluder.'—'Is it so?' says CAIN—'Can a hardened f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tracide, a premeditated delinquent, expect mercy? Can there be infinite clemency in store for him? Would all the sacrifices of contrition,

Can a transaction, accompanied with such execrable darkness, be obscured by oblivion in the bright mansions of glory?</P>
<P>ABEL maketh answer; 'Nothing is impossible there my brother; Prayer and penitence in a circuit of time can triumph over guilt; and according to its energy so will be its velocity, and wing its way to Heaven with a career of gladness; the existing space between penitence and mer∣cy is not computed by the dimensions of revolving time; <HI>Omnisciency</HI> is well ac∣quainted with the impatiency of supplica∣tion

<P>ABEL, I will not despair, although
<PB N="112" REF="030283_0110_0FE5A249879C9BC0"/>my crime appears with execrable gloomi∣ness, yet I will endeavour to overshadow its darkness with the brightness of sacrifi∣ces, so that my ideas of Heaven's conde∣scending benignity might be more enlar∣ged, and my imaginations disengaged and released from hovering dread.'</P>
<P>'Henceforth Cain magnify the <HI>Lord,</HI> if thou art by some weighty reflections seasonably alarmed, it may be profitable to thy considerations, to prevent thee from falling into a state of easy relaxation, and consequently inactive in thy duties; be not dismayed though thy spirits should be oppressed, and the woeful gulph of eterni∣ty be magnified with all its deplorable ter∣rors to thy mind, for the same <HI>Eternal and Omnipotent One, is maker of Heaven, Hell, and the World,</HI> he can protect and deliver thee—let SATAN buffet thee, <HI>his</HI> arm can uphold thee, and will not permit his total overthrowing thee.

CAIN was attentively earnest to the ad∣monition of his brother; at these last words of ABEL he sorrowfully addresses him—'And must I lose sight of thy blessed vision? Let me first embrace thee, <HI>O Abel, my brother!</HI>' 'Touch me not CAIN, all corporeal substance with me is dissolved; nature has given way to supernatural ef∣fects, and mortality hath put on an incor∣ruptible immortality.' 'And wilt thou and must thou leave me, ABEL?

<P>'CAIN, thy petition is brotherly, but thy requests are founded upon thy unac∣quaintance with spirits; mutual enjoyments are prohibited by infinite wisdom between us, relating to salutation between flesh and spirit—know, CAIN, the deadly gap is elosed—the mortal wound is healed—and

Are my hopes banished with thee? or have my prospects of future comfort in the con∣templative hours of solitude forsaken me? Go, then and glorify thy GOD, make, intercession for the desolate, forget not the fugitive wanderer, assist the unfortunate in his supplications, that the <HI>Eternal God</HI> may deign to remove from his ideas all gloominess, discontent, and grief, nor per∣mit dejection to becloud his distant pros∣pect of happiness; conscience itself sever∣ly reproaches him, needful then it is for Providence to support him.'</P>

<P>Evening was now far advanced, and night with its sable cloathing made its ap∣proaches with quick rapidity, which stimu∣lated CAIN to a consideration of self-pre∣servation, from the surrounding dangers of darkness, and seek for a refuge and warm retreat, his wandering feet having conduc∣ted him quite astray from his wonted spot of calm retirement.</P>

Now recommending himself to the protection of <HI>Providence,</HI> he lays him down to rest, to enjoy a peaceful slum∣ber after the vicissitudes and unexpected circumstances, that had possessed his mind during the tedious day. All na∣ture was now hushed in sober silence— every living creature had ceased from bu∣sy life—the <HI>lion,</HI> the <HI>tyger,</HI> the <HI>leopard,</HI> and the <HI>wolf,</HI> were all silently resting on their grassy couches; the tuneful tribe of chearful warblers were all at ease and quiet on the flexible branches that were closely interwoven one with another; darkness itself had succeeded the pale light proceeding from the moon's depart∣ing rays, whose appointed circuit was faithfully circumscribed, and left the face of creation on a sable and darkened par∣tition—midnight was past, and even the bird of melancholy was retired from her nocturnal excursions, and solemnly per∣ched within the closest enclosure of the oak—no wind or even a breeze sufficient to disturb the <HI>Aspen</HI> leaf; so calm, dark, quiet, and silent was the night, when
<PB N="123" REF="030283_0121_0FE5A2A4A2DE1DF0"/>CAIN could rejoice in the first opportu∣nity of holy meditation upon GOD's <HI>re∣vealed will</HI> toward him for good, by the voice of an <HI>Angel from Heaven</HI>—by the voice of <HI>Abel his brother.</HI></P>
<P>Without interruption or disturbance, he sweetly slept, and enjoyed the neces∣sary refreshment for his body, and re∣cruited his vital frame with renewed vi∣gour; and while in his slumbering state of inactivity, would, even unknown to himself, call out with rapturous accents —<HI>'Abel, Abel, embrace me my brother Abel.'</HI>—Thus sleepeth CAIN, profoundly peaceable, till the rising sun began to pe∣netrate its early beams through the nar∣row passages of the twining branches, and warned the solitary sojourner of ap∣proaching day; he arose, and devoutly returned his <HI>Maker</HI> praise; and after procuring such needful sustenance for the nourishment of nature as the uncul∣tivated situation produced, he seriously begins to reflect upon ABEL'S descen∣sion after the following manner:</P>

'The destiny inflicted upon CAIN by offended Majesty was to become a fugi∣tive and a vagabond; this was the ordi∣nation of <HI>Infinity;</HI> the decree has been hitherto fulfilled, and after revolving years of dubious consultations with him∣self, and promiscuous mutations in cir∣cumstances, ABEL was the appointed ad∣ministrator of comfort to my soul—Fre∣quently had SATAN beset me—often∣times were the joys I laboured for, total∣eclipsed by him, and by his infernal de∣lusions, have my drooping spirits been wretchedly obscured from the radiant hopes of Heaven, and maliciously expo∣sed to the burning tortures of desponden∣cy; thus has it pleased Heaven to permit the first grand rebel, my first great de∣ceiver, to be the instrument of my neces∣sary chastisements—the <HI>Prince of Devils,</HI> estranged from all commiseration and tendern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, would with cruel piercing torment me, and hourly hovering around, would scatter the seeds of despair, at the same time diffuse the venom of his hor∣rid imprecations into my soul—at inter∣vals,

'What now supported and delivered CAIN from death? says he to himself —'Could his own unripe contrition; could his own immature penitence alle∣viate the calamities of mind that proceed from such diabolical attacks? No!—the sacrifices of CAIN were not yet sufficiently prepared by tribulations and persecutions to answer in effect such important purpo∣ses; the destroyer would have destroyed him, had not the interference of <HI>Almigh∣ty</HI> clemency preserved him—the bounti∣ful succour of Heaven was seasonably manifested, and his plaintive moans were answered with condescending favours beyond imagination; the penitential sighs of his broken heart winged their way to Heaven, and were not rejected, and all his pious purposes were returned with celestial compassion from the efful∣gency of <HI>Infinite</HI> bounty; the defilements of sin, presented through the channel of lamentations and woe, were purified by the blessings of the <HI>Deity,</HI> and the virtue of CAIN expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ienced a gracious trans∣formation —these were secrets unreveal∣ed,
<PB N="127" REF="030283_0125_0FE5A2AA2952A0E8"/>unknown to CAIN, and remained in obscurity in the womb of Providence, till ABEL appeared, and thus continued the forsaken unfortunate in a changeable labyrinth of dubious uncertainties, con∣founding hopes and joys with grief and fears.</P>
<P>ABEL became <HI>Heaven's Ambassador,</HI> and descended from above to compleat the work of praise, to assist the outcast fugitive in the employment of devout adoration; for this did the angelic spirit of ABEL descend from the mansions of beatitude, to communicate unto CAIN a portion of that good which proceeds from the beneficency of the <HI>all-wise Creator;</HI> influenced by such attributes on the prin∣ciples of obedience, and the endeavours of CAIN will be crowned with success; he can look upwards with estimation to his benefactor, while his humble grati∣tude is amiable in the sight of his God —now can he conceive the charms of native simplicity and become enamoured with the beauties of holiness; with se∣renity

<P>After this manner did CAIN commune with himself, and encreased in faith and fortitude on <HI>Providence;</HI> his daily excur∣sions from his solitary habitation did not exceed the limits that was necessary to procure the reasonable refreshment and nourishment, and thereby enjoying a measure of inward happiness, suitably adapted to his thoughtful life, unincum∣bered with the vexatious occurrences of the world—Again he begins to converse with himself:</P>
<P>Will ABEL make a second descension and discourse with CAIN? Did his depar∣ture
<PB N="129" REF="030283_0127_0FE5A2ABEE8005B0"/>leave room for expectation? No, CAIN; it was sudden; no shadow of en∣couragement for such hopes; but benig∣nity sat on his countenance, and a radiant chearfulness accompanied his ascent; I will therefore devoutly acquiesce with pious resignation to what the <HI>Almighty</HI> was not pleased to reveal, and glorify GOD by submissive obedience; patiently wait his will for future manifestation with∣out renewing my offence with wilful dis∣trust. Be content, O my soul! thou hast the boundless beauties and conveniencies of creation before thee, and all subservi∣ent to thy necessities; thou hast prolong∣ed days to taste the sweets of growing consolatian, and around thee abundantly springeth whatever is needful to consti∣tute health and peace; spontaneously it grows in rude regularity and plenty for supplying my necessary occasions, and uninterruptedly can I enjoy a coelestial communion with the spiritual workings of <HI>Infinity.</HI></P>

<P>Unmolested by weighty temptations, and free from oppressive anxieties, did CAIN now enjoy, with peace of mind, all that his soul could desire; and the ir∣rational inhabitants of the unfrequented grove by their soothing language, undefi∣led with guilt, became naturalized unto his pensive state; the feathered songsters aided him chearfully and liberally with their early vocal adorations to devotion, and imbibed into his mind sentiments of gratitude, to which mankind, from want of reflective meditations in secret silence, are oftentimes estranged; with holy de∣light

<P>The considerations of his present com∣forts and uncertainty of future events pre∣dominated over his imperfect conjectures of worldly enjoyments, and frustrated his occasional schemes to join himself to man∣kind, and thus wisely determining to sub∣ject his own unstable desires to the uner∣ring guidance of <HI>eternal</HI> wisdom—Years after years elapsed in this tranquil state before his resolution began to waver and the beguiling insinuations of the <HI>Tempter</HI> began to prevail, when the unfortunate
<PB N="132" REF="030283_0130_0FE5A2686993A188"/>fugitive ventured to conside in the bene∣volence of his GOD and deceived himself with the hopes of that protection; he was partial to his own opinion, and esta∣blished his future expectations of pleasure upon his fortitude and <HI>Maker's</HI> forgive∣ness; his ignorance of the world and his want of knowledge of men presented no approaching danger to his mind; noevils could he bring to his ideas that was need∣ful for him to dread, but the dark delusions of the <HI>Fiends of Hell,</HI> to which he had been long accustomed, and could bid defiance to the most artful attack upon his constancy.</P>
<P>None of the many other misguiding passions, to which corrupted mortals are subject unto, had yet gained entrance into his soul.</P>
<P>The enemy of his soul being now busi∣ly employed in representing the vain glo∣ries of society to his imaginations, and no sympathizing parent or friend to ad∣monish

<P>Thus resolved, he embraced with the rising sun a bright and promising morning (when all nature was arrayed in the full gaiety of the fertile season, and the warmth of lengthening days insured to his imagination a satiety of pleasure) and
<PB N="134" REF="030283_0132_0FE5A26AE9D5FDD0"/>sorrowfully, yet hopefully, did he bid adieu to his long and peaceful dwelling, (that was never failing to produce every needful enjoyment to constitute his tem∣poral felicity—disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling also many impres∣sive afflictions of his mind, that did occa∣sionally proceed from intense reflection) while the little warblers, seemingly agita∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with mournful concern and uncommon emotion, finding no resting branch, hop∣ping and flying from bough to bough with plaintive melody, that echoed thro' the grove with accents of melancholy, in∣viting his longer abode, hovering and flut∣tering round him, with lopping wings and broken voices—even the very brambles and oderiferous shrubs around him expe∣rienced the effects of his presumption, and declined towards the ground with droop∣ing leaves, as if Autumn had, in opposi∣tion to the regular course of nature, made its approach in the gay and refreshing sea∣son of spring.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="030283_0133_0FE5A2B62B129898"/>
These alarming mementos were ineffec∣tual on his consideration; he proceeds for∣ward, and hardly reached the boundaries of the grove ere a more powerful instance of <HI>Heaven's</HI> displeasure was displayed.</P>
<P>The weighty and impulsive force of the elementary bodies was all at once sudden∣ly roused, as if stern Winter was at hand, and showered down their tempestuous fury upon him with uncommon violence and provoked rage—<HI>Hail, Rain,</HI> and <HI>Snow,</HI> conjunctively united to strike terror into his soul, and awaken him to deliberate thoughts, that his wanton and ill-timed progress might be defeated, and his erro∣neous judgment of circumstances and things confounded—amidst this dreary aspect of creation, the wind, as an unperceivable a∣gent from the skies, forced the other ele∣ments with a tumultuous vengeance against him; and with irregular and boisterous repulses, as appointed by provoked Hea∣ven, drove the heavy globulars of the wa∣try
<PB N="136" REF="030283_0134_0FE5A26D0FE50010"/>clouds upon him, like the waves of a troubled sea.</P>
<P>The feebleness of nature began to give way; CAIN could not withstand the com∣bined assaults; persuasive reason hastened him to the stately Oak for refuge, to shel∣ter him from the threatening inclemency under its spreading branches; but even here danger seemed reclining, for the aged tree itself had not escaped the general shock that nature felt; its limbs, though large and extended, bent in a dreadful manner by pliant motions, like the tender rush, and threatened destruction to the fool∣ish wanderer by its tremenduous fall; no protection could he expect from this wish∣ed retreat, and all external appearances displayed unto him very deplorable disap∣pointments.</P>
<P>The sun had refused unto him its usual warmth, and declined to administer its brightened rays, nothing was visible but gloomy clouds that were barely percepti∣ble
<PB N="137" REF="030283_0135_0FE5A2B8FB767150"/>through the close unceasing showers of ponderous hailstones, large blossoms of snow covering the surface of the earth, and unremitting drops of penetrating rain—in this dilemma of astonishment his resolutions became stagnated, and made him exclaim against himself.—</P>
<P>'This is like the horrors of <HI>Hell's</HI> dark∣ness in mid-day; this strange revolution in nature can prognosticate no good—the enterprize will not be productive of CAIN'S expectation—<HI>Heaven</HI> is offended; I will return.' Thus said, he hastens back, and the tempest gradually decreased; arriving at his arbour of peace, all nature assumed its wonted gaiety—the heavens, and earth, and all parts of creation appeared unto him with a new face; the pretty chaunting choristers welcomed their lost sovereign with chearful music—harmoniously did their little throats throttle with notes of joy; and the terrible disaster that was ap∣parently expected by CAIN on the neigh∣bouring
<PB N="138" REF="030283_0136_0FE5A26E9F8DBE58"/>bushes, that nearly adjoined his delightful habitation, was not visible on his closed inspection, nor could his most minute survey perceive the traces of one displaced leaf from its native sprig—This elevated his mind to contemplation—it raised his speculations to devout reflection and serious aspiration, and at the entrance of his shrubby cave, before stepping with∣in it, he cries out—</P>
<P>'Tis the will of <HI>Heaven;</HI> CAIN, relin∣quish all intricate desires for folly, and sub∣due thy anxious inclinations for prohibited curiosity.' Thus said, he enters his frag∣rant dwelling, and bends himself towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> and fervently addresses his GOD in a short ejaculation:</P>
<Q>'My Maker, my God, with thee I know that clemency and mercy abound; remember not my transgression, and forgive the trespasses of my foolishness; reveal thy will; commis∣ssion Abel to make known thy future ordinations unto me; humble me under the numerous
<PB N="139" REF="030283_0137_0FE5A2BD31345040"/>imperfections that surround me; endue me with wisdom that I may not toil after folly; let the infirmities of my desires be subdued by a calm resignation to thy appointments, and my wishes be always subservient to thy will, that Satan's malevolency may not tempt me again to sin against thee, nor the principles on which thy mercy is actuated towards me be abused by my indulgence of sin.'</Q>
<P>After this manner, in strains of devotion, did the remaining part of the day elapse with CAIN, almost insensible of that sus∣taining refreshment which nature required or to procure those necessaries of life to which he had been so long accustomed; and at the approach of even lays himself down on the mossy couch, and slept as composed∣ly as on a bed of down; Lively and refresh∣ed, the clearness of the morning reminds him of incumbent duties, and awaking with the early sun, observes the GOD of liberal∣ity dispensing the blessings of good around him; CAIN was now convinced; convicti∣on possessed his soul; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it needful to
<PB N="140" REF="030283_0138_0FE5A27389851A70"/>suppress all wandering imaginations; he found his suture obedience must be tem∣pered with reproving himself with rigorous exactness; with contrition he implores his forfeited beneficence of <HI>Providence,</HI> and solicits strength to his fidelity that the de∣sires of his heart may not be at variance with his duty.</P>
<P>As time did escape him, so did the new schemes of happiness that engrossed his at∣tention proportionably decrease and for∣sake him; and he soon began vigorously to renew his usual contentment, and daily adiniring with resigned obedience the le∣nity of <HI>Heaven's</HI> laws, and meditating up∣on its bountiful works, drank plentifully, and partook gratefully of its delicious fruits—Calmly and unmoved by ruffled passions did numerous revolving seasons take their annual circuits, while CAIN could hold converse with irrational creati∣on, with unintelligent beings, and by the influence of <HI>Heaven</HI> became familiarized unto him, while the innocent pleasures of
<PB N="141" REF="030283_0139_0FE5A2C1120A58E0"/>the grove procured him inexpressible de∣light.</P>
<P>Years and experience had now made him wise, and CAIN again entertained in∣clinations of joining with mankind, and thus reasons with himself.</P>
<P>'The will of GOD must be done; but CAIN would learn to know the decrees of GOD; must all the days of the years of CAIN be spent in retirement? be lost to society and unprofitable to mankind? I will first address Heaven and secure safety from the dreadful wrath that attended my former desire; with sacred penance I would wish to solemnize that day, and my yearly penance shall flourish upon its remembrance.'</P>
<P>Thus said he prostrates himself with de∣vour supplication at the footstool of <HI>Om∣nipotence</HI> and presents his petition with sa∣cred devotion to implore direction from the all-wise GOD; this done he retires to
<PB N="142" REF="030283_0140_0FE5A275AA88F638"/>rest, and quietly enjoys the comforts of night; with the morning light, 'ere the sun had se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce began to diffuse its radiant beams through the moistening atmosphere, CAIN awoke, and again took leave of his domestic companions; the grateful war∣blers of the wood had not yet bid adieu to the silent repose of night; so that all was sober and solemn silence, excepting the more early obedient lark, who had just shook from his opened wings the dew of the vapourous element, and melodi∣ously hovering over the head of CAIN, rendering up his morning tribute of grate∣ful harmony to its <HI>great Benefactor;</HI> and the congealed particles of the moistened element dropping as dewy icicles upon the head of CAIN, foretold a pleasant day.</P>
<P>Through the wood he solemnly and slowly pursues his walk, and coming out upon the open and extensive plain, medi∣tation took possession of him, and he be∣gan to contemplate on the uncultivated wild: The sun was gradually heightening.
<PB N="143" REF="030283_0141_0FE5A2C2A095B490"/>and making a feeble and streaming ap∣pearance through the azure sky; here he halts for a while, and awaited the awak∣ening of creation; the four-footed crea∣tures of savage prey begin to open their yawning mouths, stretch out their extend∣ed tails, and shake their shaggy manes; the feathered tribe of chearful songsters, spread their wings, and begin to hop from branch to branch, chirping their morning gratitude with innocent adoration, while the towering eagle sits majestically perched on the top of the aspiring cedar, waiting the sun's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e powerful influence to wing its way towards Heaven.</P>
<P>The morning was captivating, the beau∣ties that adorned nature were enchanting, and the delicious flavor proceeding from the variegated herbage promiscuously scat∣tered around the borders of creation was highly alluring—it brought to his mind the garden of EDEN, it resembled to his view a second Paradise, such a promising aspect: such reviving hopes stimulated
<PB N="144" REF="030283_0142_0FE5A2773A5257F8"/>unto devout praise with attractive powers, and elevated his soul with extasy; he goes forward, every step raising tumultuous joy within him, his mind religiously de∣pendent upon the goodness of <HI>Infinity</HI>— Solemnly but chearfully he moves, no ob∣stacle of art or nature to retard his peace∣ful passage; and the brightness of the at∣mosphere, aided by the reflection of the sun's beams upon the sweets of expanded productions beneath him, all joined to sti∣mulate him forwards: the scattered bushes by their gentle motions from the soft and agreeable breezes, all seemed to combine to pay him obedience, and make his jour∣ney pleasant.</P>
<P>Again he halts for a while—on the grass he sits, and gave way to rumination, pondering deliberately on the probable advantages that might accrue by his en∣trance into the scenes of men, and thus speaks to himself—</P>
<P>'I seek redress,' says he, 'from the
<PB N="145" REF="030283_0143_0FE5A2C4838E6298"/>grievance of <HI>humble happiness</HI>—and can <HI>humble happiness</HI> need redress?—Here his imagination was stretched to the ut∣most —'can an entire ignorance of the world, and unacquaintance with busy life, procure a superior degree of happiness to the present? Will not temptations frus∣trate delightful expectations?</P>
<P>He could not bring his ideas to any re∣gular conclusion, and found himself in a labyrinth of doubts how to act not to of∣fend <HI>Heaven,</HI> or which course to direct his wandering feet without the interme∣diate guide of Providence—In this state of oppressive consternation he reasons with himself—</P>
<P>"To the LORD will I make supplicati∣on to lead me through the spacious and unbeaten track; CAIN is to the world as one unborn; to its inhabitants or their manners he is estranged; their residence he knows not, nor the footsteps of one

<P>With devout veneration he humbles himself before the <HI>Almighty</HI> for wisdom and understanding; and in his sorrowful prayer to the <HI>Omniscient One,</HI> a voice mild and pleasing came unto him from the mouth of an invisible Agent—'CAIN, direct thy feet eastward; <HI>Angels</HI> shall guide thee to a people country; NOD by name, a land inhabited by the descendants of ADAM.'</P>
<P>From the gound he arises, and looks around, but no appearance of any existing <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Substance</HI> from whence the voice came; his reliance was upon <HI>Providence;</HI> he knew the command was from <HI>Heaven,</HI> and eastward turns his eyes, and beholds a vast large tract of uncultivated barren and its wild productions the sole produce of nature, desarts unfrequented and un∣known to man; thus encouraged, he as∣sumeth
<PB N="147" REF="030283_0145_0FE5A2CA033895C0"/>fortitude, and eagerly proceeds with chearful footsteps o'er the dreary plain. <HI>Heaven</HI> smiled upon him; no dis∣heartening occurrence intervenes to inter∣rupt his journey, or render his walk un∣pleasant for successive revolving moons; the earth his wants supplied, and his pre∣servation by day and night the <HI>Heavens</HI> assumed till he safely arrives within sight of the desired country; and approaching forward within a sew paces of its dwellings, he kneels before the <HI>Lord,</HI> and lifts up his sould as follows:</P>
<Q>'Almighty, and beyond the comprehen∣sion of mortals, merciful God, by justice are all thy ordinations established; condescend again to answer the servent petition of the penitent, by thy gracious dispensations of re∣velation: protect me, <HI>O Lord,</HI> from such abounding iniquities as may be prevailing in the land, and bless me with thy impres∣sive graces amongst this people: proportion my constancy to the trials I must conflict with,
<PB N="148" REF="030283_0146_0FE5A280B0965EA8"/>and endue me with an adequate measure of wisdom, superior to my present enjoyment, that I may know how to discern good from evil, and not err from the path of rectitude; let thy spiritual influences still overshadow me as a guardian from temptations, and the preserva∣tion of my virtue, so that Cain may glorify the <HI>Lord</HI> in the midst of mankind.'</Q>
<P>CAIN now enters the inhabited place amidst crouds of numerous spectators; he was astonished! 'Twas impossible for him to bring his ideas of their actions to any conclusions; and according to his concep∣tions of men and things, they appeared unto him as running to and fro for nought, very intent upon doing nothing; busily employed to no purpose, removing their situations, and making exchange of places.</P>
<P>Here CAIN took him a wife, had child∣ren, and built a city.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis very probable that CAIN was, at entering the land of NOD, two hundred years old, which is the smallest computation we can admit; for it was a <HI>peopled</HI> country, and the inhabitants must be lineally descended from ADAM, and of course to the third or fourth generation; and even this itself, in my opinion, comes far short of the age of CAIN when he entered the land; for at this time there could be no more than the fourth generation of ADAM in be∣ing; and by refering to Sacred Writ, you will find even at that age he must be married to one of his sisters' daughters, or his own sister; which almost im∣plies a contradiction, and will not bear the least pos∣sible allusion to sacred record; because, while he liv∣ed in the land, he built a city—The building a city, be it ever so small, must indisputably require <HI>many</HI> hands more than can be reasonably supposed to pro∣ceed from his own loins, or his brothers' or sisters, even if he was married in that infantile state of the world before mentioned; consequently in my opinion I think we may justly conclude that CAIN was three or four hundred years old when he entered the coun∣try, or at least before he began building; by which time the offspring of ADAM and EVE, before and after the death of ABEL, might be increased, as well as the generations of SETH, and the other sons and daughters of ADAM born after SETH; and even at this age of the world there could be but few spare hands when a city was building—I think a certain Commentator on the Bible that says,— '<HI>about the sixtieth year of the world Cain murdered Abel</HI> —comes short of the truth; especially if he supposes CAIN immediately flew for shame to the Land of NOD, and took him a wife.</NOTE></P>

<P>He is resolved, and takes a parting farewell of his surviving family, even to the fifth generation; dividing his paternael blessing by a recommendation to the pro∣tection of <HI>Heaven;</HI> with the admonitions of a tender father would sympathise for their danger, while he endeavoured to establish fortitude in their minds to en∣counter the insinuations of SATAN with holy courage, and cleave unto the <HI>Lord of hosts.</HI></P>
<P>CAIN now proceeds forward towards his once delightful bower; nothing uncommon intervenes during the course of his journey,
<PB N="152" REF="030283_0150_0FE5A2D0CE9DF568"/>to impede his progress; and safely he ar∣rives at the desired spot—'Still untainted or defiled by the footsteps of man!' says he, 'all its inhabitants consist of the offspring of my former companions—still <HI>chearful,</HI> still <HI>harmonious,</HI> still <HI>innocent</HI>—O CAIN, thou hast to regret thy many years loss of their social and harmless community<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'</P>
<P>CAIN now began to resume his former happiness in solitude; and predicted to himself years of happy retirement, every prospect around him, as far as the shady enclosure would admit a perspective view, had a lovely appearance, and soothed his soul with pleasing imaginations; and thus did a circle of mature years take their re∣volutions, and increased with delight his sacred contemplations, free from many of those incidental mutations that, in days of younger trials, produced tribulation and sad perplexity to his spirits—experi∣ence had made him sage; and he could
<PB N="153" REF="030283_0151_0FE5A319A10556B0"/>render up his renewed obligations of grati∣tude to the <HI>beneficent</HI> ONE with a soul calmly serene, as the bountiful gifts of <HI>Heaven</HI> in regular rotation succeeded each other.</P>

<HEAD>CAIN's LAMENTATIONS <HI>OVER ABEL.</HI> BOOK THE FIFTH.</HEAD>
<P>IN the season of pleasing variety, and all creation beautifully decked with flowers of variagated plumage; the sun with its luminous orbs just breaking through the bespangled sky, CAIN awoke from sleep, and walked to the extremities of the grove, wandering and admiring the mar∣vellous works of GOD with men and things—suddenly, instantaneously was he surrounded with a shining light uncommon∣ly splendid, far exceeding the splendor of ABEL'S vision; at a distance he beheld a
<PB N="155" REF="030283_0153_0FE5A31BD06186F8"/>visage—the resemblance of man—the lus∣tre of an angel—but past description lu∣minous—A pleasing astonishment for a∣while deprived him of speech; but con∣science told him it was an omen of good tidings, that the LORD had not forsaken him—As he drew nearer to the <HI>coelestial Messenger</HI> he thus addresses him:</P>
<P>'<HI>From whence art thou?</HI> arrayed in the apparel of <HI>Glory,</HI> declare thy mission; mo∣ments are valuable; delay not to reveal thy appointment; my soul is convinced thou art an Ambassador from the <HI>Great Supreme;</HI> no deception can be concealed under thy appearance—<HI>Heaven</HI> can descry, and to <HI>Heaven</HI> are all the imaginations of my heart open; and God my <HI>Creator</HI> knoweth that the resolutions of CAIN are estranged for ever from future com∣munion or association with busy life: Bring∣est thou tidings of peace to the peaceful; bringest thou tidings of exultation from <HI>Hea∣ven?</HI> Doth ABEL glorify the LORD? Is he triumphantly joining in hallelujahs with the <HI>heavenly</HI> choir? Does he still intercede
<PB N="156" REF="030283_0154_0FE5A2DDB1EF4788"/>with his GOD for CAIN, his undeserving, his worthless brother? Is ADAM, is EVE yet arrived amongst the coelestial band? Are the two first parents of men dwellers on <HI>Earth</HI> or in <HI>Heaven?</HI> Answer me; quickly solve me; CAIN is conversant with <HI>Heaven,</HI> with spiritual <HI>Beings</HI> alone would CAIN wish to join in communion—Visions from above cannot disturb me; with im∣mortal shapes I can hold conversation with∣out fear or dread—Contemplation has in∣ured me to such vicissitudes, and created within me pure sensations of pious love and reliance upon my GOD—My soul is im∣patient for <HI>heavenly</HI> information; speedily remove a painful suspence—thou art not my enemy, the first great revolter against his <HI>Maker,</HI> his assaults on the poor fugi∣tive were never accompanied with the garb of an <HI>Angel of Light</HI>—know thou this; I am prepared; calm resignation has fitted me for the ordinations of GOD, even if thou art his constituted execution∣er to confound me with my original dust—with humble patience I acquiesce to his dis∣pensations,
<PB N="157" REF="030283_0155_0FE5A31DE7DAD9B0"/>and devoutly submit to his <HI>Almighty</HI> will—the malignant enmity of <HI>Hell's Infernals,</HI> nor all its plausible de∣vices of temptation, can move the soul of CAIN to abate his confidence in his GOD; No attempts upon his fortitude can weak∣en the covenants he has repeatedly enter∣ed into with his GOD; the bolts of im∣mortality would not have been loosened nor thou permitted to visit the regions of mortals, if the message with which thou art entrusted, did not affect the first born of men.'—</P>
<P>'Knowest thou CAIN the <HI>homicide?</HI> the <HI>fratricide?</HI> the <HI>murderer</HI> of his <HI>brother?' 'I am the man</HI>—my destiny is the decree of <HI>Heaven</HI>—solitude is suitable—retire∣ment is necessary for my soul, and daily do I wait for the fulfilment of justice;— wretched darkness and abyss of confusion have at intervals been hovering about me since the fatal day; but compassionate mercy has still supported me to the present
<PB N="158" REF="030283_0156_0FE5A2DF485C4628"/>hour; the influences of <HI>eternal</HI> clemency have impressed an aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and grateful sense of the <HI>Deity</HI> upon me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good.</P>
<P>'With thee I would commune; in the prospect of thy magnificent complacency I can rejoice; impatience keep pace with the movements of time that escape me— ABEL, the spirit of my <HI>angelic Brother,</HI> dispelled all fear, and revived my hopes that the gates of <HI>Heaven</HI> were not shut to the penitent. In thy countenance there is no ferocity; in thy nature there can be no malevolency; from thee shall not my eyes be withdrawn till the mission of <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> is revealed.'</P>
<P>CAIN was now very near the Angel, undauntedly he looks; earnestly he fixes his eyes; and suddenly a trembling seizes him—utterance had forsaken him for a while; presently with a faultering exclam∣ation he breaks out—' <HI>Imagination</HI> de∣ceive me not!—delusion, fly thou from me!—h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ot CAIN beheld these
<PB N="159" REF="030283_0157_0FE5A31FBAF61DC0"/>features in mortality? a nearer survey may fuller convince me.' He assumeth courage and draws near—<HI>he shrieks! he cries out—'My father! my father!</HI> ADAM is thy name—ABEL has sent thee; thou art also ascended to the regions of bliss; thou art also admitted into fellowship with spirits made perfect! <HI>Heaven</HI> is become thy dwelling-place! ABEL may again rest on his Father's affection, and both con∣junctively celebrate praises of celestial har∣mony to the GOD of all praise.</P>
<P>Where is EVE, the other parent of CAIN? Has the mother of mankind yet added one to the angelic tribe? are the days of her transitory pilgrimage expried? does she yet join in strains, and partake of <HI>Heavenly</HI> melody? <HI>O my Father!</HI> commune with thy first-born; reveal unto him the mysteries of <HI>Omnipotency!</HI> Thy pa∣rental injunctions to CAIN, when but a youth in years, and aged in sin, have to this day occupied a portion of his soul; the
<PB N="160" REF="030283_0158_0FE5A2E159952220"/>GOD of ADAM, EVE, and ABEL has ne∣ver forsaken him, but gave him understan∣ding and wisdom to estimate time, and dis∣cern between good and evil; the tempta∣tions of SATAN have not prevailed: the exertions of CAIN for retalliation have been blessed with the gracious acceptance of GOD, instances of his Almighty beneficence have been manifested beyond conception or im∣agination; ABEL was commissioned from <HI>Heaven</HI> to administer comfort, and his pre∣sence banished all despondency; the radi∣ant beams of thy countenance predict com∣placency; with sacred pleasure can I gaze upon thee; thy mission must be correspon∣dently <HI>Coelestial</HI> and <HI>Benign;</HI> my heaving pulse beats with eager irregularity to em∣brace thee; remove my conflicting passi∣ons already suspended on the pinnacle of hope, and adjust the innumerable crowd of imaginations that possess me; and with bended knees will I bow towards the earth and receive the dread injunctions of <HI>Sove∣reignty</HI> with resigned calmness.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="030283_0159_0FE5A323A147E5C0"/>
<HI>'Father, I have done.'</HI></P>
<P>With profound reverence he prostrates himself before the JUDGE of all the earth, and the spirit of ADAM thus began—</P>
<P>'My child, CAIN my first-born; see ADAM thy father; into those unfathoma∣ble depths of immortality, thy father but lately received the Almighty mandate to make his entrance; Angels conducted his flight through the hidden paths of aether, and joyfully lodged him beside the beatific presence of his <HI>Maker;</HI> each eoelestial face was adorned with the smiles of resplen∣dent glory and welcomed the parent of generations into the mansions of felicity;</P>
<P>'The forwardest; the first approaching transcendant host that was prepared for the reception of the new visitant from Earth to Heaven, was <HI>Abel his son; Abel thy brother;</HI> he conducted; ADAM fol∣lowed; and in GLORY was the SU∣PREME
<PB N="162" REF="030283_0160_0FE5A2E7209DC6F8"/>DIVINITY encompassed around with throngs of <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Archangels,</HI> united in one universal concord of Praise and Glory to the GREAT CREATOR; no sooner admitted into <HI>Heaven,</HI> but ADAM was suffered to make his descent towards the borders of <HI>Creation,</HI> to declare the will of GOD to CAIN his son, and pre∣pare him for the future conflicts that await him on his journey from death to eternity!</P>
<P>'If thy mind is enlightened, improve it to thy spiritual utility; examine the puri∣ty of all thy offerings in prayer, and make conscience undefiled thy messenger for pre∣sentation.'</P>
<P>'Father, knowest thou not that CAIN has woefully experienced the dire effects of <HI>unsavory sacrifices;</HI> behold not yet <HI>era∣sed,</HI> the MARK of GOD in his counte∣nance; Wave the discourse, my parent, 'twill be kindling anew the burning sparks of vital flames, and render CAIN unfit for thy following admonition; no other
<PB N="163" REF="030283_0161_0FE5A325C1A032E0"/>reparation can CAIN make for ABEL'S death, but unremitting contrition.'</P>
<P>CAIN the embassy of ADAM is not to add weight to the bitterness of thy feel∣ings; 'tis to remove the poignancy of dis∣tress, by administering balms of <HI>Heavenly</HI> herbage to stop its progress; the LORD is amiable; penitence is pleasing in his sight; thy sorrows and afflictions have been con∣secrated at the altar of lenient justice: thy lamentations have been conspicuous to the inhabitants of <HI>Heaven;</HI> and, in the due season of <HI>Infinite</HI> prescience, will renewed mercy be displayed, as to transcend thy most extensive conception; place therefore thy confidence in his promises, for he is punctual; in his engagements he is never embarrassed; with himself he is consistent with truth; and never confounded in his performances. Imperfectly mayest thou form conjectures, but very defective must be thy comprehensions of the portion of his gracious influence that has been secret∣ly displayed towards thee; the depth of
<PB N="164" REF="030283_0162_0FE5A2E93B9547D8"/>his mercy is fathomless, therefore let thy gratitude be the more magnified, and tran∣quillity will still find a retreat in thy bosom, and be promulgated by thy righteous con∣ceptions of things.</P>
<P>'The LORD may at intervals reprove thee with seeming severity, but still have treasured store of compassion compounded with his authority, and thus, as lessons of instructive morality, teach thee how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> serve him with <HI>fear,</HI> with <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>humility.</HI> Thy guilt still pursued thee, and still would thy anguish been furiously piercing, had not thy contrition been proportionable to the magnitude of thy sin; herein hast thou assuaged the wrath of offended justice, and received from <HI>Heaven</HI> the succours of <HI>Di∣vine</HI> consolation; at present thou enjoyest the beatitudes of <HI>Heavenly</HI> ardour; the benefits of thy creator are immensely pro∣pitious; but their virtuous efficacy is lost, if drowned in the waves and tempests of undis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mment; slacken not to render up thy rapturous sensations of piety unto the
<PB N="165" REF="030283_0163_0FE5A32750A1EB58"/>seat of the <HI>Holy One;</HI> and no discouraging concomitants of dejection will prevail, to sink thee under the necessary corrections of <HI>Almighty</HI> chastisement.</P>
<P>'The message of thy father is to an∣nounce peace, and declare unto thee the will of the LORD; he regardeth thy plain∣tive supplications with a merciful eye; his munificence exceeds language, and his wis∣dom elevates a righteous soul beyond ima∣gination.'</P>
<P>Here ADAM ceased, and CAIN begins;</P>
<P>'ADAM, my <HI>glorified Father,</HI> I am not estranged to the lengthened lenity of Pro∣vidence towards me; through his abound∣ing love are my days prolonged; although the twisting reptiles in the grass are more innocent in nature, and fulfil the intent of <HI>Creation</HI> with more obedient conformity to his will, yet is CAIN noticed by his tender∣ness, and compared to the <HI>angels</HI> in <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>'Speak again, my father—Where is
<PB N="166" REF="030283_0164_0FE5A2EB64C8FE00"/>EVE my parent, the womb that sustained me? May CAIN promise himself the pleas∣ing scene of another congratulatory inter∣view with his mother in the world?'</P>
<P>'ADAM replies—' <HI>Eve is living</HI>—fre∣quent and fervent have been her offerings to <HI>Heaven</HI> since bidding adieu to her child; many have been the tears of hopeless sym∣pathy dropped compassionately from her still swollen eyes, when the dreadful scene did occur to remembrance; and, with the weeping of unrestraining grief, would cry out—<HI>'Woe be to me! alas, my children! one is dead, and another lost from me for ever!'</HI></P>
<P>'Oftentimes was the manly fortitude of ADAM staggered to maintain his superior resolutions; and, at the weak intervals of reason, would imperceptibly draw from his aged eyes the watry drops of painful me∣mory —against the flowings of nature's weakness did he struggle, and combat with the weighty reflections of his own soul, to
<PB N="167" REF="030283_0165_0FE5A32968B17718"/>abate its immoderate excess in the partner of his life; until the <HI>Messenger</HI> of <HI>Eternity</HI> presented the <HI>decree</HI> of <HI>heaven</HI> to ADAM; and he obeying both chearfully and re∣luctantly the powerful dictate, took his worldly farewell of <HI>Eve his Wife,</HI> and left the mother of ABEL but a few paces from whence she bid adieu to CAIN her child.'</P>
<P>CAIN again speaks—'Could CAIN meet his mother, and embrace his aged parent if he goes to seek her? transported would he fly on the wings of rapidity, and let her witness the triumphant virtue that reigns in the bosom of CAIN—Advise me my fa∣ther —is it safe? Will Heaven be offended? shall I first supplicate the <HI>Deity</HI> to know its will? filial duty to my parent, and covenan∣ted obedience to my <HI>Maker,</HI> are both pen∣ding in the same scale of <HI>Justice—Father, shall I go?</HI> GOD can accompany me there —EVE cannot come to me here—Would it not gladden her heart to have a sight of her child? Would it not be removing the anxiety that daily prays upon her specula∣tions?
<PB N="168" REF="030283_0166_0FE5A2ECF36F28F8"/>Would it not dispel all dissatisfied motions of uncertainty dwelling within her, whether CAIN is or is not in the land of the living? Her many sleepless nights would then be buried in the mass of aged triumph, and her latter days be crowned with rest and peace, superceded by a thou∣sand delightful images and representations of holy festivity in her mind.</P>
<P>'How reviving must be the Ianguage to her soul, to hear tidings of ADAM and ABEL in <HI>Heaven,</HI> from the lips of her hope∣less and banished first-born—<HI>Cain the lost</HI> —the forsaken CAIN!'</P>
<P>'CAIN, thy words are dictated upon virtue and duty—thy expressions are com∣pounded with tender and sincere gratitude; but know, CAIN, the peculiar dispensati∣ons of Providence displayed towards thee for good in this uncorrupted solitude de∣mands thy serious and deliberate considera∣tion, that thou dost not in the moment of presumption, invoke his displeasure.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="030283_0167_0FE5A32CAA2CF388"/>
'My son, no actions can be justifiable in the sight of GOD that are inconsistent with his decrees; nor canst thou prudently undertake to be thy own conductor in mat∣ters that come under his special appoint∣ment and ordination—thou hast hitherto received from him spiritual benefits propor∣tionably to the trials of thy body and tribu∣lations of thy mind, all which proceed from the inexhausted source of his eternal be∣nignity.</P>
<P>'My embassy to thee is peace and con∣solation—let sorrow be thy punishment, and punishment the gate that leads thee from the torrents of misery and death— be <HI>stedfast,</HI> be <HI>courageous,</HI> for time with thee is precious—days with thee are im∣portant—CAIN, believest thou this? An∣swer thy father.' CAIN replies—</P>
<P>'Father, I know, father, I believe with sorrow, with lamentation, with repentance, with admiration, and with prayer.' And
<PB N="170" REF="030283_0168_0FE5A2F038AE9EC0"/>directly falling with his face to the earth, cries out— <HI>'Bless me, O Lord.'</HI> And look∣ing up towards his Father, says—Father, shall I supplicate <HI>Heaven</HI> to go and seek my mother, to pay the debt of dutiful af∣fection, and revive the troubled soul of paternal affection? Haste, father, speak— CAIN is eager to open his lips to Heaven.'</P>
<P>'GOD is good, my son; let contrition, humiliation, conviction, fear, and adorati∣on, accompany thy supplication, and ad∣dress thy GOD—CAIN begins—</P>
<P>'<HI>My</HI> GOD, <HI>my father</HI>'s GOD, <HI>my mother</HI>'s GOD, <HI>and the</HI> GOD <HI>of Abel my brother; the maker and Creator of all things in Hea∣ven and in Earth, look compassionately upon Cain the fratricide, the unfortunate first-born of the image of heaven, he unto whom thy blessings have been so peculiarly distribu∣ted, with mercy, hear him,</HI> O LORD; <HI>reject not his petition; permit his fervent supplica∣tion to gain admittance within the borders of heaven; let thy repeated, thy renewed bene∣volence
<PB N="171" REF="030283_0169_0FE5A32ECB34AED0"/>add new dignity and lustre to his soul—In presence of his father immortal pa∣rent of the penitent, the angel of God; the sinful outcast, the desolate fugitive bows be∣fore thee, and with humble prayer at the footstool of thy Throne, lifts up, with pious devotion and awful reverence, his</HI> hopeful, <HI>his</HI> fearful <HI>petition; forget, O Lord, his in∣iquities, and chear his hopes with condescen∣ding complacency; Reveal thy</HI> gracious will, O thou Eternal Majesty, <HI>unto Cain; If the long lost son may pay the debt of gratitude and duty to the mother of mankind, the womb that nourished the rebellious fratricide? Erase from the records of Heaven the pre∣meditated, the inhuman act that stained the face of nature with the guilt of blood; Re∣veal thy will to the spirit of Adam; commis∣sion him to declare unto the supplicant thy gracious approbation, while discharging his already entrusted embassy in the brightness of a coelestial host—give him the commands of</HI> Supremity, <HI>what is thy will for the anxi∣ous child to do—but withdraw not thy bene∣dictive
<PB N="172" REF="030283_0170_0FE5A2F27ACB8380"/>influence to leave him in dubious speculation to fin unknowingly against thee; let thy will,</HI> O LORD, <HI>be done, and make Cain religiousty patient and submissive to the mandate of his</HI> GOD—O GOD, <HI>be it so! be it so, O my</HI> GOD.' Here ends the prayer of CAIN.</P>
<P>With eyes intently fixed upon the ground had CAIN hitherto remained, and now looks towards the sky to see his father—he looks, he surveys the expanded atmosphere, he trembles! and with quivering limbs, un∣able to sustain nature, down he fell with a groan to the earth—<HI>Adam is gone!</HI> his <HI>comforter!</HI> the <HI>consolating friend</HI> of the sus∣pending penitent has received the summons of <HI>Omnipotency</HI> to return to the THRONE of MAJESTY.</P>
<P>The eyes of CAIN began now to over∣flow and water the ground with grief— the whole frame of nature was in a state of perturbation, and in the agonies of his soul would cry out—</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="030283_0171_0FE5A330DD4A90D0"/>
'<HI>Heaven is offended! my petition is re∣jected! God is displeased! my father, my comforter, in his sudden anger is recalled!</HI> Involved now in a gulph of amazing wret∣chedness, my Soul, bid thou adieu to all expectations of future fruition—again hast thou offended GOD! Was not thy desires open unto his <HI>Omnipotency?</HI> Was he not acquainted with thy tender sensations for EVE? He wisely withheld the message from ADAM; then why presumest thou, CAIN, to direct <HI>Omnipotency?</HI> Canst thou fathom the depth of his wisdom? Vanity has again deluded thee!'</P>
<P>Thus reflections succeeded each other as a discorded mass of unsettled imaginati∣ons, and terminated instantly, before ru∣mination could adjust its scattered frag∣ments, and form them into any regularity for hope.</P>
<P>'The attributes of GOD are just the fame,' says he, 'if the prayer was evil, the heart of CAIN was righteous before God.'</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="030283_0172_0FE5A2F410DEEC88"/>
These considerations would rejoice him, and inadvertency procure some consolation under the deplorable circumstances that his oppressed imaginations painted unto him—thus he continues bewailing and groaning under his tribulations on the ground, till the cheering warmth of the sun was much exhilerated, and its power∣ful influence upon creation visibly abated; the chilling damps were making their pro∣gressive motions through the vacuities of the earth rapidly, and the whole atmos∣phere loaded with moistening dew—these combined evils forewarned the mournful complainant of their forcible effects and ap∣proaching danger, and on his feet he arose —flowly, and oppressively loaded, he pro∣ceeds toward his melancholy abode; as he walks he halts; around him he looks, and looks again; nothing to be perceived but solemn silence and advancing night; his soul was eager for further expostulation with itself—he sighed for reconciliation again with God; consternations succeeded each other by quick rotations; and all the
<PB N="175" REF="030283_0173_0FE5A3326AA37760"/>alleviation he could obtain for his unsettled and disturbed contemplations, was at times to open his lips with ejaculations to <HI>Heaven</HI> in the language of hope:</P>
<P>'God is good! God is merciful! CAIN will still rest upon his God!'</P>
<P>With faculties thus deranged, medita∣tions discomposed, and a mind roving from circumstance to circumstance, forgetfulness had suffered him to be overtaken with mournful darkness, and memory had for∣saken him how to regain his solitary resi∣dence; thus is CAIN, the first-born of mankind, at present situated, bewildered in a maze of almost insanity; beclouded with the darkness of dismal night and load∣ed mind, and lost from all consolating so∣ciety.</P>
<P>Thus he traverses the unbeaten desart, thoughtless of safety; but by the hand of Providence was miraculously brought to his desired home; Conviction was imme∣diately
<PB N="176" REF="030283_0174_0FE5A2F644AE1308"/>present with him; no deliberation was requisite at this time to convince him of the goodness of God, and with requisite of heart he cries out—</P>
<P>'<HI>My God hath not forsaken me!</HI> a mer∣ciful guide and guardian have I found him through the barren wilderness; unto de∣spair will I bid adieu; melancholy shall no longer rest on the brow of CAIN, for he can again rejoice in the LORD; there are hopes,' he cried, 'I will cherish and cultivate them.'</P>
<P>CAIN was now seated in his peaceful bower, surrounded with sable darkness, while his ejaculations and contemplative thoughts winged their way to <HI>Heaven</HI> com∣posedly; when in the midst of his pious meditations, he hears, at a little distance from him, a soft and tender voice—</P>
<P>'CAIN, <HI>be watchful!</HI>' Before surprise and astonishment was scarce fettled within him, he hears the second voice as a whisper in his ear—</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="030283_0175_0FE5A3359AD650C8"/>
<HI>'Thy repeated offence has irritated Hea∣ven; there are no hopes left.'</HI> Here <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>resolution</HI> were powerfully besieged, and <HI>confidence</HI> began to waver; then again reflection assists to support him under the ponderous consideration; 'The voices were <HI>two,</HI>' says he, 'danger must be at hand, or warning unnecessary; hopes can∣not be banished, or CAIN need not be <HI>watchful;</HI> SATAN is still exerting his ma∣chinations to overwhelm by his malevolen∣cy the already miserable; I will be com∣forted, and not by perdition offer aggra∣vated violence to <HI>Heaven.</HI>'</P>
<P>Thus communeth CAIN with himself; and after presenting his offerings of grati∣tude to <HI>Heaven,</HI> lays himself down on the mossy couch, and presently falls into a pro∣found slumber; sleep refreshed him— his soul required a relaxation from its tur∣bulent disquietudes; with the early lark he arose, and presented his morning sacri∣fice in the following language:</P>
<Q><PB N="178" REF="030283_0176_0FE5A2FBEE819420"/>
'With unfeigned acknowledgements, O God, I offer up my grateful tributes of praise; be∣stow upon me a portion of thy influence, adequate to the powerful attempts of my adversary, that in an unguarded moment he may not be tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n∣phant over me.'</Q>
<P>From hence did CAIN enjoy for a sea∣son his meditations, and converse with <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> and Nature undisturbed, and in peace —when early in the dawn of a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> (which he regularly observed, as enjoined by GOD to ADAM) he perceived in the <HI>Hea∣vens</HI> a luminous body making its way through the regions of etherial space. Be∣ing twice before warned by similar appear∣ances, his astonishment was lessened, but still struck an awful consternation into his soul, as its progressive motions became more and more visible; impatiently he awaits its nearer approach; and presently it was within a few paces, when its illuminating transcendency overcame the whole face of nature, and CAIN, with bended knees, unable to look on the exceeding transpa∣rency
<PB N="179" REF="030283_0177_0FE5A33811C80468"/>closes his eyes, and cries out, '<HI>What is this?</HI> It has the resemblance of an en∣trance into <HI>Heaven!</HI> Can I face my MA∣KER? with <HI>shame I shut my eyes.</HI>'</P>
<P>While in this situation of doubtful and pleasing impulse, a voice entered his ear as follows:</P>
<P>'CAIN thou art deceived; Heaven is not for thee; Hell waiteth with open mouth to receive thee into the bowels of its flaming gulph: prepare therefore for thy everlasting reward.'</P>
<P>CAIN directly turned round to see from whence the sound came, and immediately a second voice gently speaks—<HI>'Cain, I say be watchful.'</HI></P>
<P>This cheers and revives his languishing spirits, and looking up he beheld a conflict in the clouds betwixt two; he was convin∣ced that the combatants must be advocates for <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell;</HI> with bended knees to∣wards

ADAM thus begins—'CAIN, my child, hear the injunctions of thy GOD!'</P>

<P>'With peace, my son.'</P>
<P>'Speak my father.'</P>
<P>'My son, thy prayer to <HI>Heaven</HI> reached the <HI>Throne of</HI> GOD—the unexpected visi∣tations experienced by thee in the inter∣mediate space, was the wise result of infi∣nite rectitude, for reasons peculiar to his own self-existing will—Cease therefore, CAIN, to wonder at these dispensations, and be attentive to the voice of ADAM.'</P>

<HEAD>CAIN's LAMENTATIONS <HI>OVER ABEL.</HI> BOOK THE SIXTH.</HEAD>
<P>'AND has ADAM taken his last fare∣well? says CAIN, 'Wait now patiently my soul, for the further manifestations of thy God; still enjoy the sweets of solitude; without rational community thou mayest be devoutly contemplative, and a chearful resignation will be comfortably solacing un∣to thee, till the will of the Lord is reveal∣ed; swift-footed time is rapidly passing thee, and soon wilt thou see the termina∣tion of thy days; yet the awful summons
<PB N="184" REF="030283_0182_0FE5A30181B9A298"/>of <HI>Eternity</HI> will not await thee until the <HI>mo∣ther of men has embraced her child!</HI> Oh, all ye shrill voiced warblers, aid me by your musical instructions to celebrate my adorations devoutly; let your morning tributes accelerate my reciprocal adorati∣ons in strains of unfeigned gratitude, that with calm contentment I may be submis∣sively obedient to the ordinations of my Creator; and all ye the domestic com∣panions of my peaceful retreat, who daily awaken my meditations upon infinity, in∣spire me with that native instinct that moves you to punctual praise, and teach me how to augment our mutual community, and, emulated by your examples, I shall not of∣fend <HI>Heaven;</HI> establish the present subsist∣ing fellowship amongst us till the end of time; with CAIN, your silent and inarti∣culate admonitions have been seasonably instructive and useful, and learned the <HI>aged man</HI> lessons of morality.'</P>
<P>Thus reasons CAIN with himself and creation, and from hence enjoyed every
<PB N="185" REF="030283_0183_0FE5A33F4E2B5D78"/>requisite happiness his soul needed, or cir∣cumstances required; and piously resign∣ed to his condition, he reaped continual consolation, and dedicated his hours to the necessary duties of life; diligent and watch∣ful did he nurture and feed the tender young of his numerous family, and procur∣ing the balms of nature's herbage to the infirm and wounded, from the creeping <HI>rep∣tile</HI> to the <HI>majestic lion;</HI> every inhabitant of the <HI>grove</HI> to whom that spot of creation was friendly, partook of his compassionate ca∣resses and cares; in this exercise of huma∣nity to brutes he could reap both rational pleasure and profit.</P>
<P>A few seasons had elapsed, and CAIN, in his wonted round through the spreading branches and entwinements of the grove, heard a sound pleasingly mournful, but plaintively dreadful; all the agitations to which discomposed nature is subject, both in joy and sadness, seemed to be conjunctively in motion; it surprised him; patience would
<PB N="186" REF="030283_0184_0FE5A30615044B78"/>not admit of delay by attention; he pro∣ceeds towards the spot, guided by the un∣usual accents softly whispering through the leaves, while the reverberating echo was awful to his ears; he approaches a close shade of prickly brambles, nicely join∣ted all around with peculiar exactness, and curiously interwoven by the artful industry of its occupier; one small vacuum only open for the admission of its guests. CAIN without hesitation looks within, and his astonishment ceased with pleasing reflecti∣ons and improved sensations, when being convinced of this supernatural effect on his mind.</P>
<P>He saw worn out with the successive re∣volution of years, and rendered infirm and helpless by the decay of age, the once pow∣erful, but now <HI>languishing Lioness:</HI> the last remains of lengthened days were diminish∣ing, and around the dying <HI>dam</HI> stood the venerable <HI>sire</HI> and an offspring of tender <HI>cubs,</HI> joining in mournful plaints, while the soft accented moans of departing life were
<PB N="187" REF="030283_0185_0FE5A3415F934850"/>conveyed through the enclosures of the close retreat in strains of sober melancho∣ly.</P>
<P>CAIN'S appearance produced no con∣sternation in this disconsolate dwelling of solemn sadness; his face, his manners, were familiarized to the brute creation; they look on him with irrational reverence, not estranged from brutal sympathy, nor acquainted with human feeling; CAIN with admiration beholds the mournful spec∣tacle; <HI>'This equals human affections,'</HI> says he, ''tis the hour for sacred meditation; my soul, improve the awful moments! Be∣hold nature undisguised; see natural in∣stinct approaching towards rationality in perfection; can the minds of brutes form such exalted ideas of <HI>death,</HI> which produ∣ces to them nonentity and final dissolution? Let this stimulate thee to an extasy of de∣votion to speculate on <HI>immortality,</HI> and im∣prove thy contemplative powers on <HI>ever∣lasting</HI> felicity, beyond the reach of death and time.'</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="030283_0186_0FE5A307A6966718"/>
The expiring <HI>Lioness</HI> opens her eyes and sees CAIN, LORD of the creation; for sea∣sons past she had been accustomed to re∣ceive the daily food of his liberal donation in common with all other creatures; she shewed not the least emotion of terror at his sight, but moved her tail for gladness; gave one doleful moan, and <HI>expired!</HI> The faithful family attendants, as by instinct of nature guided, immediately began to paw the ground, and make an opening to con∣ceal with earth and leafs the deceased pa∣rent; while CAIN began to employ his rea∣sonable faculties upon the various occur∣rences of circumstances around him—</P>
<P>'The beast is dead;' says he, she lies as ABEL laid—<HI>breathless!</HI>—I will assist the diligent survivors to discharge their debt of <HI>nature</HI> and mine of <HI>duty,</HI> and help to commit the perishing corpse to the earth.' Thus said, he joined the hasty labourers, and ful∣filled the obligation that natural feeling suggested to him. The mournful family afterwards turned tail, and fled further into
<PB N="189" REF="030283_0187_0FE5A342EDEFE728"/>the wood, and CAIN returned to his own bower, and communeth with himself after the following manner:</P>
<P>'Like the forgotten beast soon will CAIN the forsaken be! No affectionate wife, no tender parent, no filial child to bewail his expiring moments, or discharge the last of∣fice of moral duty to his perishing frame; here CAIN will die; here CAIN will perish as a beast perisheth, unpitied of all, un∣numbered with the dead of mankind; <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> I will supplicate to go and seek EVE, my parent, before the dreadful day ap∣proaches.'</P>
<P>Immediately in a short ejaculation he supplicates the <HI>Divine Majesty</HI> for the <HI>gra∣cious</HI> permission, and betakes him to rest; and at the dawn of the morrow prepared for his journey.</P>
<P>The morning was clear, the early birds were arisen chearfully melodious, and gai∣ety spread itself on all sides of him; a nu∣merous
<PB N="190" REF="030283_0188_0FE5A309C75C4700"/>tribe of faithful domestics follow him to the opening desart, which CAIN seeing, he exclaims with admiration—'Here is affection irrational! veneration undesigned! esteem without guile! the poor creatures regret my departure; by melancholy movements they would con∣vince me of their sensitive sorrow, and by silent motions covet my longer stay; I will return and sooth every one with a <HI>touch.</HI>' He walks back, and not one of the pitiful train attempts to shun his approach, or shrink from his tender feel; such was the subsisting amity between CAIN and irra∣tional creation, that the savage verocity of the voracious <HI>tyger</HI> had forsaken him, and the natural timidity peculiar to the fea∣thered lineage was now banished from their nice sensations, and from spray to spray did they hop, silently and mournfully af∣fected with sagacious discernment, at the loss of CAIN'S society.</P>
<P>With deepness of thought he pauses, and wonders at this strange and powerful ope∣ration
<PB N="191" REF="030283_0189_0FE5A3458725B640"/>on the instinctive faculties of crea∣tures of different natures and properties; and gently stroking each noble beast, and softly laying the ruffled feathers of the now silent songsters he bids them adieu, and takes his last farewell.</P>
<P>No sooner was the face of CAIN turned from them, but a mournful discord of sor∣rowful sounds reigned throughout the whole herd of beasts and flocks of birds, and, taking separate courses and flights, slowly move with sensitive melancholy, and bid farewell to their departing <HI>monarch.</HI></P>
<P>CAIN now proceeds forwards ruminat∣ing on the various disasters, conveniences, and circumstances of life that had befallen him since the murder of ABEL, and thus begins to reason with himself—</P>
<P>Conscience at times has singed me—fear at seasons has been terrifying to me, but reflections on GOD'S <HI>mercy, equity and truth,</HI> have supported me—Powerful have
<PB N="192" REF="030283_0190_0FE5A30B5895B380"/>been Satan's frequent assailments, and pro∣portionably liberal have been <HI>Heaven's</HI> merciful protections; and due obedience to the instructive lessons of ABEL and ADAM have taught me temperance in my desires, and prudence in my conduct; and to the years of aged experience, have all my afflictions of mind been alleviated by the seasonable counsel of improving wis∣dom, and brought me to the approaching period of <HI>embracing my mother.</HI></P>
<P>He now turns round to take his last view of the peaceful spot, and if <HI>one</HI> faithful do∣mestic of his family was still in sight, but every one had taken his course and depart∣ed, like CAIN, from the land of grievous solitude.</P>
<P>'Now,' says he, let my footsteps keep pace with the movements of swift-winged time—<HI>contemplation</HI> will impede progressi∣on, and retard my pursuits after the de∣sirable meeting—leave me for a while, ye multiplicity of <HI>charming ideas,</HI> that croud
<PB N="193" REF="030283_0191_0FE5A348F34A91C8"/>promiscuously upon my conceptions, that my speed may bear similitude to the swift footed <HI>deer,</HI> and bring me without obstruc∣tion within sight of the happy <HI>Eden</HI>—Eastward of that beautiful spot (adorned with the variegated productions of odori∣ferous flowers and herbage, cultivated by the diligent hand of improvement) shall I find the mother of men, surrounded with a numerous offspring of a later and purer race than CAIN her unfortunate first-born—e'er now she has erased from recol∣lection the vile miscreant—while the hor∣rid act is still retained in memory, while the bloody remembrance produces bitter anguish to her soul, when she caresses with aged affection the fruits of her after pro∣geny.'</P>
<P>Thus communeth CAIN with himself, and still proceeds forward without inter∣ruption or delay, taking his nightly repose on the open and untrodden plain, and rising every morning with the tuneful lark, who
<PB N="194" REF="030283_0192_0FE5A30FCCAEDB50"/>punctually warned him of approaching day. Protected by <HI>Heaven</HI> and provided by <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> he arrives within sight of <HI>Eden's Gorden;</HI> to the <HI>east</HI> he bends his course, and towards the setting sun at a distance, he beholds the <HI>heart-wounding, the melan∣choly spot! the spot where</HI> ABEL <HI>died!</HI> Nature was overcome! CAIN sunk to the ground! Reflection was too powerful for him to withstand—darkness overtook him before reason could be collected, and all the night was devoted to supplications to <HI>Heaven</HI> when the intervals of examination would permit his addresses to the <HI>Throne of God.</HI></P>
<P>In the morning the diligent warbler gave him timely notice of the rising sun, and he proceeded forward; presently ap∣peared to his view the grassy hillock that for a series of years had faithfully withstood the tempests and hurricanes of <HI>disturbed creation,</HI> and concealed in sacred security the harmless dust.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="030283_0193_0FE5A34B432F98F8"/>
He stops—<HI>anguish, sorrow, grief,</HI> and every reflective concomitant of guilt brings to remembrance, with torturing remorse the painful scene; his mind borders now upon wavering inconstancy; hope becomes almost a victim to despair, and self reproa∣ches as deep wounds to his soul; nothing now could support him but a confidence in GOD; the glory of ABEL and ADAM in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and his encouraging consolation under their former conversations with him—heavily he proceeds till within sight of EVE's abode; and still pensively advan∣cing, he presently beholds the venerable <HI>parent</HI> of mankind dandling on her knee with the dalliance of smiling gravity, the infant offspring of the <HI>eighth generation</HI>—LAMECH, the first-born of METHUSELAH, with a numerous family of chearful and obedient domestics around her, all dili∣gently employed in the necessary occupa∣tions of fertile industry; the pleasing as∣pect in every countenance was nobly visi∣ble, and sat on every brow with the tinc∣ture
<PB N="196" REF="030283_0194_0FE5A31196DB22A0"/>of joy and delight; contentment had taken up its dwelling amongst them with sensible gratitude, and the bountiful pro∣ductions of <HI>Heaven's</HI> beneficence were por∣tioned out with all their necessary conveni∣ences and useful requisites, untainted with corrupting superfluities to defile them.</P>
<P>The impression such a sight made on the mind of CAIN, added to his own reflecti∣ons, would not, for the present, admit of a serious or unsettled conclusion how to pro∣ceed, which produced the following solilo∣quy—</P>
<P>'My presence will undoubtedly cause confusion, and probably discording opini∣ons and unfavourable conjectures in the minds and sentiments of the <HI>peaceful happy</HI>—'Tis a generation strangers to the <HI>per∣son of</HI> CAIN; their knowledge of the un∣fortunate criminal extends not beyond the boundaries of historical relation of him: and, unacquainted with his many years deep contrition and penitence, can only re∣tain
<PB N="197" REF="030283_0195_0FE5A34D690910E0"/>in their bosoms an implacable hatred and detestation for his memory; for tra∣dition has recorded in the minds of the de∣scendants of ADAM the <HI>premeditated,</HI> the <HI>hellish</HI> deed, that involved CAIN in years of bitter woe; my further approach may be dangerous; overcome by the sudden impulse of anger and passion at the first sight of CAIN'S infamous MARK, they may, before calm consideration gives place to patient hearing and reason, in one united body be revenged on CAIN for a <HI>brother's death.</HI>'</P>
<P>In this dubious alternative he petitions <HI>Heaven</HI> for instructive lessons of wisdom; a voice charmingly soft and pleasing enters his ear—</P>
<P>'CAIN, <HI>proceed and fear not.</HI> Thus em∣bolened, he communes with himself—</P>
<P>'First will I approach the <HI>grave of</HI> ABEL, and be eye-witness to the devastation that
<PB N="198" REF="030283_0196_0FE5A3132F7DF580"/>revolving time has made on the once green and flourishing turf, that entombeth na∣tive purity and primitive simplicity; thus shall I be prepared by calm and mature reflections to join in converse and unite in harmony with the righteous family un∣known.'</P>
<P>Thus said he hastens towards the <HI>grave of</HI> ABEL, and his eyes beheld the fruits of <HI>paternal</HI> and <HI>fraternal</HI> veneration for a <HI>child,</HI> for a <HI>brother</HI>—every odoriferous herb and sweet scented flower to which this cul∣tivated spot of harmless nature was friend∣ly, plentifully surrounded, with their luxu∣riant sweets, the <HI>tenement of clay,</HI> and distri∣buted voluptuously their balmy flavours all around—The soul of CAIN now soars aloft with warm emulation at the affection and love of distant generations for the me¦mory of a brother unknown.</P>
<P>In a posture of bended humility and de∣vout meditation he fixes his eyes on the <HI>hallowed recluse,</HI> too intent on the object
<PB N="199" REF="030283_0197_0FE5A34FA6606AC8"/>of his awakening memory to perceive the playful innocents around him, (the chil∣dren and grand-children of ENOCH and METHUSELAH) that infantile curiosity and admiration had drawn together to gaze on the unknown stranger; when presently look∣ing up, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le inoffensive visitors, equally surprised and frightened, run with speed towards their home, to take refuge in the arms of their protecting parents.</P>
<P>CAIN, still continuing in an uncomposed state of mind, and his intellectual powers almost forsaken him, had not fortitude or resolution to quit the grave, and in a <HI>few minutes</HI> saw approaching him the image of aged <HI>rectitude</HI> and <HI>religion</HI>—EVE the parent of mankind—<HI>the mother of Abel,</HI> leaning on the arm of the <HI>youthful Lamech,</HI> and support∣ed on the other side with the close embra∣ces of her children's children, clinging their little hands with terrific imaginations to her covering garments.</P>
<P>CAIN saw and knew his mother, ere she
<PB N="200" REF="030283_0198_0FE5A358DEEADF08"/>was near him—' '<HI>Tis my mother!</HI> he cri∣ed, and down he fell with his face on the grave.</P>
<P>The aged parent draws near, and with sympathy commiserates the unhappy stran∣ger—in vain she strives for a time to soothe him with the language of <HI>pity</HI> and provi∣dence.</P>
<P><HI>'Heaven,'</HI> said she, 'has directed the wan∣dering footsteps of the unfortunate to the mansions of reflective sorrow; see how he lies with pulses beating irregular courses on the turf of <HI>silent darkness.</HI> Arise, thou distressed; partake of the bounties of na∣ture's liberality; behold EVE the ancient of living, the mother of men, prepared to administer the needful consolation and com∣fort unto thee; let her assist thee with the soft endearments of tenderness and com∣passion; embrace her friendly offers for thy interest, moved towards thee only by mo∣tives of mutual sensation; afflict not thyself with unlimited grief, nor permit anxiety to
<PB N="201" REF="030283_0199_0FE5A35A703D4610"/>prey on thy cheeks, while cordial relief in∣vites thy acceptance.'</P>
<P>LAMECH now gently touches CAIN, and opens his mouth to him as follows:</P>
<P>'Oh, thou dejected! o'ercome with the weight of affliction and troubled mind, <HI>Who art thou? arise!</HI> be not deaf to the intreaties of sage experience; no harm a∣waits thee amongst the descendants of EVE; look up and behold the countenance of ve∣nerable affection, revered by a numerous offspring; the heart of our <HI>univensal pa∣rent</HI> beats with mournful breathings for the alleviation of thy distress.'</P>
<P>CAIN now lifts up his eyes and beholds the <HI>chearful, painful</HI> smile of compassionate feeling in the face of his feeble parent, and immediately arose and cries out;</P>
<P>'<HI>My mother! my mother! my mother! Eve my parent!</HI> behold CAIN the long lost first-born of thy womb! behold the hum∣ble
<PB N="202" REF="030283_0200_0FE5A35F37BFF900"/><HI>Penitent;</HI> the <HI>sorrowful convert;</HI> look in the face of CAIN, and doubts will fly thy breast; see the immoveable STIGMA of GOD: <HI>Art thou now convinced, my mo∣ther?</HI></P>
<P>''Tis my child!' cries EVE, <HI>embracing him,</HI> and with joy and infirmities of years, sinks to the ground; CAIN assisted E∣NOCH, the father of METHUSELAH, to raise her from the earth, but her overflow∣ing faculties of gladness, rendered her in∣capable of uttering the joyful language of her soul. Slowly they proceed towards the fragrant, the delightful abode of EVE, and procuring the necessary cordials and re∣freshing juices, she recovered her spirits and began to commune with her <HI>son; her first-born long lost child!</HI> while a large fa∣mily of each sex and all ages, some of each tribe from SETH to LAMECH, surrounded them with sober attention, and listened with pleasing satisfaction to the edifying discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="030283_0201_0FE5A360F6704398"/>
EVE thus began—'How have the days of the years of my son been spent? Has the LORD been <HI>in</HI> and <HI>out</HI> with thee, my son? Is the soul of my first-born re∣lieved by any encouraging consolation from his GOD? Is the violence of all unruly dis∣orders banished from the breast of the el∣der of men? Has CAIN resisted all temp∣tations to sin in the interval of long paren∣tal absence? And is he returned to close the eyes of his aged mother in <HI>peace?</HI></P>
<P>Here CAIN relates to his mother the va∣rious occurrences and circumstances that had befallen him in the course of his ba∣nishment from EDEN'S view, which produ∣ced in EVE different sensations of emotion, as his historical relation affected her con∣ceptions, and as the successive rotation of events that had accompanied his <HI>solitary</HI> as well as <HI>busy</HI> life impressed upon her reflec∣tions; but the narration of ABEL'S and ADAM'S appearing to him, revived her a∣ged soul with extasy of joy, and produced raptures of unbounded gratitude and devo∣tion to <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="030283_0202_0FE5A36288E3D548"/>
Here the tears of contemplative powers burst their vent through the weakly eye∣lid, and moistened the cheeks of CAIN with affectionate embraces of aged triumph and joy.</P>
<P>'And is my <HI>husband</HI> and <HI>child in glory?"</HI> said she, then EVE will die in peace. Will my first-born now take up his dwelling in the bosom of parental tenderness, and for∣sake not his mother till her body is com∣mitted to its parent soil? Come, ye chil∣dren all, the offspring of ADAM, let us unite in one general concord of harmoni∣ous adoration; assemble round the altar of sacred piety, and encrease with your un∣feigned devotion the grateful praise; lift up your hearts and voices with a unity of solemn veneration to <HI>Heaven,</HI> not only for the gracious donations enjoyed by our∣selves, but for its distinguishable blessings displayed towards the dead and the living.'</P>
<P>EVE having now summoned all herfaith∣ful family around her, with chearfulness
<PB N="205" REF="030283_0203_0FE5A364881D8F78"/>and alacrity they pay obedience to the ve∣nerable injunction, and silently join their reverend parent in ejaculation to <HI>Heaven,</HI> as follows:
<Q>At the footstool of thy throne, <HI>O GOD,</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> we assemble to render up the feeble accents of our praise; let not the im∣perfections of our unripened adorations dis∣please thee; separate all defilements from the purity of our sacrifices, and reject not our offerings for being compounded with de∣fects; before us is a living instance of thy benign love and kindness, and by manifest revelation we are convinced of thy heavenly benediction to those that are gone before; for those thy gracious dispensations accept the un∣feigned tributes of our souls as presented with conscientious celebration and pious sensations of devotion: prepare us also to encounter, with sacred fortitude, the trying conflict of approaching dissolution and separation; per∣fect the necessary work that remaineth unfi∣nished in the mother of mankind; let her in∣crease
<PB N="206" REF="030283_0204_0FE5A36C6DB435E8"/>the conjunctive voices of praise in glo∣rifying thee <HI>forever and ever</HI>—Leave not the first-born of men in his latter days to the power of his awaiting adversary; compleat the work of penitence and atonement within him, and disdain not to reward his repen∣tance with thy future influence; let the gra∣ces of Heaven flow down plentifully upon this rising seed, and water those plants of future generations with the dew of <HI>divine mercies,</HI> that they may escape the suares of evil designs, and answer the purposes of their creation rightcously, to thy glory, the good of their own Souls, and guides to suc∣ceeding posterity.'</Q> Here EVE endeth her prayer, and CAIN addresses himself to the family around—</P>
<P>'Ye children of ADAM, brothers and sis∣ters of ABEL in glory—behold the first-born of mankind; learn from the mouth of dire experience to be <HI>wise</HI> unto <HI>good,</HI> and eschew the paths of <HI>evil</HI>—See before you CAIN the guilty! The gravity of years nor devastation that revolving seasons has made
<PB N="207" REF="030283_0205_0FE5A36E00CB81A8"/>upon the ruddy countenance and robust complexion of your aged <HI>kinsman</HI> can erase or diminish the denounced vengeance of GOD upon him for the unnatuaal arime; from generation to generation the MARK of infamy distinguishes him from the purer race of men; unceasing have been his days of lamentation in solitude; consecrating penitence has accompanied his mournful hours, and revolutions of scenes unexpect∣ed and profitable, have continually atten∣ded the wrathful decree—let not animosi∣ty exist amongst you towards the aged un∣fortunate—cherish not hatred against the worn-out sufferer; admit him cordially in∣to your fraternity of peace, and let him find comfortable consolation amidst grey hairs and children, and calmly to end his days in the band of a holy society.' Here CAIN ceased speaking to his relations, when METHUSELAH thus began:</P>
<P>'Our brother, judgment is the prero∣gative of GOD; filial duty and love belong
<PB N="208" REF="030283_0206_0FE5A36F90E3BEE8"/>to <HI>brothers</HI> and <HI>sisters:</HI> Take up thy abode with us; comfort our aged parent with thy occasional relations of providential dispen∣sations; it will be grateful to he ears, and make her privated meditations pleasingly instructive to herself; while our younger branches will listen with eager curiosity, and be almost inadvertently brought to awful contemplations on the wisdom and goodness of GOD; they will thereby in∣crease in sacred knowledge, seemingly by inspiration; while our youth of constituti∣ons more robust, and inured to fatigue and labour, shall fulfil the duties of the day with chearful alacrity to provide the ne∣cessary supplies of sustenance for our <HI>aged mother</HI> and CAIN our <HI>brother.</HI>'</P>
<P>'<HI>Dwell with us thou reverend years,</HI>' cries the children with one united voice, 'and with our tender aid we will join to contribute to thy daily comfort.'</P>
<P>'Peace dwell amongst ye, innocents— with you I will abide,' says CAIN.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="030283_0207_0FE5A37122CEC440"/>
'With delighted hearts, and unspeaka∣ble gratitude, may we never cease presen∣ting our acknowledgments to <HI>Heaven,</HI> to the giver of all good gifts,' says EVE.</P>
<P>Now every one partakes him to his ne∣cessary occupation, and EVE and CAIN are left to enjoy the pleasing reflections of the promising unity and happiness.</P>
<P>Daily did CAIN take his thoughtful rounds amongst the cultivated enclosures of his sociable and beloved companions: tranquility had taken up her resting place in his soul, and with his aged mother could enjoy, under the blossoming branches of shady arbours, the exhaling sweets of va∣riegated flowers, and join in concord the musical and mellifluous harmony of the warbling inhabitants: punctually would he go, and pay a pensive and reflective vi∣sit to the grave of ABEL; these occasions made transgression painful to his memory while consolation was elevated within him by contemplating upon <HI>Heaven's</HI> many
<PB N="210" REF="030283_0208_0FE5A375668075E8"/>instances of providence and encouraging mercies: with tears of grief he waters the flowers, with the language of hope would he embrace the turf, and glorify GOD in the midst of groans and sighs.</P>
<P>EVE, in one of her solitary and flow ex∣cursions on the borders of fertility, accom∣panied by a youthful train of chearful de∣scendants, beheld CAIN reclining on A∣BEL'S grave, and approaching him, seated herself by his side, and entered into dis∣course with him as follows:</P>
<P>'My child, we rest on a couch, the de∣voted spot of sanctity; underneath us a∣bides in peace and quietness the remains of mortality, the dust of primitive inno∣cence; the parent earth conceals securely the once existing flesh demolished, and safe in its bowels is wrapped the dust of ABEL —These are opportunities which heaven has vouchsafed to my first-born for reflec∣tion and improvement of mind; conscience may here undisturbed penetrate into the
<PB N="211" REF="030283_0209_0FE5A377CCCE9C38"/>dark c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ern below, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tate prositably upon the dreadful scene.'</P>
<P>'From thy lips proceed the words of truth, my mother,' replieth CAIN, 'Pen∣sive years and woeful experience has been productive of improved effects from CAIN'S meditations; 'tis true; spiritual instructi∣on can be obtained by conversing with the entombed silent. Thoughtful serenity is the concomitant of solitary devotion, and the awakened soul thereby be prepared for Heavenly communion; rejoice, thou parent of all men, with the greatest crimi∣nal, with the greatest penitent, and marvel at the merciful operations of Almighty goodness to grant peace of mind to the most iniquitous.</P>
<P>'My son, the language of thy lips is comfortable; the words of thy mouth are reving; with calm resignation could EVE now render up her soul unto God; with peaceful tranquility could she surrender all nature's perfections into the hands of its
<PB N="212" REF="030283_0210_0FE5A379ECEB0600"/>creator, and chearfully bid adieu to all mo∣mentary selicity and transitory enjoyments —her end is approaching, her moments fly with rapid progression, and shortly will the dictate be declared that summons the <HI>first sinner</HI> and <HI>first mother</HI> to her everlast∣ing home.'</P>
<P>After this manner discoursed EVE with CAIN, both seated on the consecrated turf of ABEL, and CAIN perceived a faultering in her speech; a sudden emotion in her limbs that seemed to predict an immovea∣ble calamity; the melancholy catastrophe was near at hand that was to separate pa∣rent from child and children; the diffolu∣tion of mortality was evinced by approach∣ing symptoms of meagre death; the pale, the wan visage was apparent in her coun∣tenance, and age and nature seemed joint∣ly combined to take a farewell of mortal∣ity together; the mother of ABEL sinks on the bosom of CAIN; the scene is now become awfully mournful! the young and the youthful cry out,</P>
<P><HI>'Our mother is dying!'</HI></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="030283_0211_0FE5A37B8186C710"/>
She is speechless! CAIN waters her qui∣vering cheeks with tears of melting lan∣guish, while the little sobbing infants ran to call assistance from the elder and wise, and prefently was ABEL'S grave furrounded by all ages, of both sexes, each dutifully ap∣plying with diligent exertion the most salu∣tary balm, productive of the native soil, striving to administer the necessary aid to restore again the feeble motions of venera∣ble affections, but alas! the decree of <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> was fulfilled! <HI>their mother is no more!</HI> EVE has joined the communion of spirits; silence has closed her lips, and darkness her eyes for ever?</P>
<P>CAIN cries out, 'Enclose me my mother in the arms of death, and convey me through the tracts of aether to the regions of immortality.'</P>
<P>And down he drops with EVE on his breast on ABEL'S grave; <HI>in a swoon he li∣eth,</HI> while the sympathising family hastens to discharge their duty towards the living

<P>Long was the time before reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturn∣ed to its wonted composure, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igious resignation acquiesced to <HI>Heaven's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter∣mination, when CAIN found himself s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted with domestic reverence in the deligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ll arbour of ENOCH'S son; while the vigo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the youthfull had paid the debt of <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> to the body of EVE, and care∣fully laid to rest on the coffin of ADAM, her <HI>husband.</HI></P>
<P>The mind of CAIN became gradually calm and tranquil, while the embracing fondness and chearful obedience of <HI>all</HI> to his will, increased his happiness and soft∣ened his reflections, and also stimulated him to an exercise of his mind by improv∣ing
<PB N="215" REF="030283_0213_0FE5988F4C69CF88"/>his own declining days, and instructing the rifing youth in the incumbent duties of <HI>virtue, truth</HI> and <HI>holiness</HI>—Bending under the weight of years he would nurture with tender love and fondness, children's children to the latest generation.</P>
<P>On all sides did reverence and esteem unite to fill up the measure of his days with undisturbed and unmolested peace; and from the circumstances of revolutions elapsed and reflections on the past and approaching vicissitude near at hand, he required all the solacing consolation that his faithful fa∣mily could render him to support him under those frequent recollections of occurrences that required his utmost fortitude to sur∣mount, and from whence no alleviation could be derived but by confidence in his GOD, and improvement of <HI>stying</HI> time by holy conversation—attended by the young and innocent he compasses the cultivated inclosures with the smiles of aged pleasure, and partakes of the harmless amusements of the children with chearful gravity.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="030283_0214_0FE5A3822AC6F168"/>
Punctually did he observe his daily rounds with feeble footsteps, and visited his <HI>bro∣ther's grace</HI> in regular course—here con∣viction still predominated over the weak∣ness of human nature, and draw almost im∣perceptibly the tear of contrition from his wrinkled eye-lid, already near dry with revolving years.</P>
<P>Nothing could eradicate from his me∣mory the painful scene; and when gazing upon the multitude of variegated flowers that decked the sacred spot and diflused the sweetest odours all around, thought would sometimes be too powerful for his aged faculties to maintain, and throw him almost into a trance, while the little harm∣less attendants would use every effort pecu∣liar to their infantile sagacity to divert his attention by playful recreations, drawing him by the stratagems of inoffensive art from the melancholy spot, inciting his speculati∣ons to objects more suitable to decaying nature, and delivering him from the load∣ed anxieties of insupportable impressions.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="030283_0215_0FE5988D5004BD10"/>
Thus was CAIN the eldest of the first generation, guided by children the young∣est of the last—with delight he looks down on their smiling faces, and follows with pleasure their wanderiag sootsteps; forget∣ting for a while, the fatal stroke of ABEL, would become like one of them, and join their healthy diversion with the chearful∣ness of infirmity; and at the same time lis∣ten with delight to the tuneful choristers on the waving branches, spiritualizing their harmonious voices into melodious devoti∣on —All nature to him was now become natural; and from even the <HI>inanimate</HI> as well as <HI>irrational</HI> works of creation he could derive in ward consolation, and me∣ditate profitably upon all GOD's works.</P>
<P>Resting upon the branches of a bending cedar, thoughtfull on eternity, he reasons with himself as follows—</P>
<P>'Revolving years have taken their rapid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourses through the space of swift-winged
<PB N="218" REF="030283_0216_0FE5A385766913C0"/>time, and attended with circuitous events to CAIN—the hour is approaching when the first, the greatest-premeditated delin∣quent will bid adieu to mortality, and feel unalterably the powerfull force that now separates life from death, and know what IMMORTALITY is—then can hejudge of the power of penitence, and if contriti∣on can accomplish the pardon, and appease the wrath of offended <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>'The reflection is awfully penetrating▪ it impresses with ponderous ideas on the aged mind; still is CAIN loaded with sor∣rowful meditations when the death of A∣BEL intrudes upon his silent ejaculations— neglect not to embrace with sensible gra∣titude the season of flying <HI>Graces</HI> to meet thy <HI>Judge!</HI>—O CAIN!—God has not avowedly manifested unto thee his forgive∣ness; what are his declarations from <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> towards thee more than thy hopes founded upon his repeated clemency and thy lengthend days for penitence? Let not thy dependence rest entirely upon those
<PB N="219" REF="030283_0217_0FE5A38DCF546488"/>past encouragements, but persevere in thy duty of contrition, that the <HI>Tempter</HI> may not destroy thy hopes at last.'</P>
<P>CAIN'S contemplative powers were now very much impaired, and his aged facul∣ties soon overpowered with the infirmities of nature, and the weight of intense thought were more than his years could support al∣though the <HI>love, veneration,</HI> and <HI>obedience</HI> of his whole family was evident in all their conduct—for those were all unacquainted with the weight of his malady, though not strangers to its cause—every effort was ad∣ministered to erase the dreadful transacti, on from his memory, so far as to abate its rigour on his solitary devotions; but his greatest consolation was derived from con∣templating upon ABEL'S and ADAM'S vi∣sitation; these reflections would prepon∣derate and footh him under the burden of his weighty considerations.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="030283_0218_0FE5A383BA943B28"/>
On the eve of a sabbath CAIN, with LA∣MECH, a youth of the last generation went forth to feed the flocks—'Behold,' says he to the youth,' let the purity and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cense of the playfull lambs be exemplary for thy futurelife; let their harmless diversions stimulate thee to the love and practice of friendship and peace; these are virtues that ornament the soul; qualifications that beautify the whole frame of nature; in u∣nity dwell thou amongst thy brethren; che∣rish not hatred against thy bitterest ennemy, and thy days will be prolonged, and thy soul calmly glide on the surface of those tumultuous waves that ebb and flow with the continul vicissitudes of the world; de∣spise not the admonition of experienced years; let the reasoning of the ancient pre∣dominate over the immature judgment of thy youth, and sage advice be effectual on thy pliant mind; survey the flock; behold the native simplicity of harmless creation; unto sin they are estranged, neither are their pleasures compounded with evil; and equally unknown to them are those exalted
<PB N="221" REF="030283_0219_0FE5A38FB8C9DB68"/>degrees of sublime reasoning, and forming ideas of the excellencies of their Maker's attributes, and the knowledge of future glory with which man is nobly endowed by his GOD.

<P>CAIN having ended, LAMECH the youth thus began;</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="030283_0220_0FE59893DA441348"/>
'Thou eldest of the aged, veneration is due to thy years—from thee sage counsel is esteemed expedient—advice from the grave experienced cannot be otherwise than salutary and productive of real good; rooted in my soul shall thy persuasive ad∣monitions be established, and may a porti∣on of CAIN'S virtues be bountifully con∣ferred by the GOD of all good upon the youthful LAMECH.'</P>
<P>'Child, with all its imperfections, may my blessing attend thee—<HI>Arise, let us be gone!</HI> thy parents will seek thee as lost, while the aged will beforgotten in the hur∣ry of anxious immaginations for the young? distracted thoughts will irregularly flow and intermix with the cares of dejection for the <HI>promising</HI> the <HI>hopeful boy;</HI> See yon∣der they come, and the motion of their footsteps keep pace with the velocity of paternal embraces, and deliver the tender mother from doubtful apprehensions.'</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="030283_0221_0FE59896C8459D60"/>
The youth ran to meet his <HI>Father</HI> and console his <HI>mother,</HI> and brings them with joy to the spot where CAIN was seated.</P>
<P>'Father,' says METHUSELAH,' diligent∣ly have we sought thee; and with plain∣tive voices dreaded to find thee, forebo∣ding some disastrous calamity had befallen our <HI>Father;</HI> Thy sight revives our droop∣ing spirits and chears our almost despair∣ing hopes; behold the assembly of gladness that surrounds thee; joy sits smiling on e∣very brow, and dejection is banished from every face at sight of thee; return with us to the disconsolate bower, and dispel the gloomy moans of the painful mother and children of ENOCH.'</P>
<P>'Ay, ye virtuous,' says CAIN, 'I go; be quick, let us not retard the pleasing in∣terview, nor suffer grief affectionately foun∣ded upon groundless speculations, to abide in those religious dwelings of <HI>peaceful fe∣licity.</HI>'</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="030283_0222_0FE5A3915105F0D0"/>
They all retire, and a concord of tran∣quil joy echoes throughout the grove, while every dwelling partook of the har∣monions community.</P>

Thus speaketh JARED to CAIN; and brought the <HI>man of sorrow</HI> to his <HI>arbour</HI> of quietude, and rejoiced the whole fami∣ly around, while a sober sadness was settled on the furrowed cheeks of CAIN, a reluc∣tant melancholy overshadowed his counte∣nance, and excited the family to an inter∣rogation as follows—</P>
<P>'CAIN,' says the <HI>mother of Methuselah</HI> 'What grief of mind oppresses thy riper meditations? From whence flows this al∣teration in thy features, and appearance of woe in the <HI>aged man?</HI> reveal to the wife of ENOCH the original cause, and by our joint assistance the effects may cease; nature with thee is too far gone to support the load of depression; 'tis a baneful weed that shoots forth in the soul, and unless cropped at its rising will bring our father's <HI>grey hairs</HI> to the grave in sorrow; the years are past for CAIN to encounter in conflicts with power∣ful reflections, or to combat with the for∣ces of united enemies; The adversary of

<P>'What aileth our Father?'</P>
<P>'<HI>Nothing,</HI> ye <HI>righteous</HI> seed of SETH.'</P>
<P>From hence were the watchfull guardi∣ans of CAIN diligent in the duty of obser∣vation, and never permitted his private walks to exceed the bounds of <HI>hearing.</HI></P>
<P>ADAM and EVE had recorded the mournful day of ABEL'S death, and reveal∣ed the same to succeeding posterity—on this <HI>same day,</HI> after revolving centuries and successive generations, did the venerable wanderer, <HI>weak and feeble,</HI> unknown to
<PB N="227" REF="030283_0225_0FE5A393708D7180"/>his family, once more attempt to reach the <HI>grave of</HI> ABEL; fatigue overtook him, and with weary limbs did painfully arrive at the pensive spot. The expected time of his return was elapsed, the whole family was in consternation, and eagerly fled to the mournful place, where CAIN in deep contemplation was seated, as the image of death, on ABEL'S <HI>grassy tomb:</HI> his counte∣nance evinced the approaching change, and all were preparing to convey him home; Cain looks up and sees an infant in the mother's arms, the wife of ENOCH, he says, 'Come near, let me bless the child before I die: What is his name?'</P>
<P>'We call him <HI>Abel,'</HI> says <HI>Enoch.</HI></P>
<P>'ABEL, you call him;' and taking the child from his mother, he says, <HI>May he be endued with Abel's virtues,</HI> and with eyes and hands uplifted, he falls back on the grave with ABEL in his arms, and, looking towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> with one <HI>smiling groan,</HI> he gave up the <HI>ghost,</HI> and <HI>died.</HI></P>
