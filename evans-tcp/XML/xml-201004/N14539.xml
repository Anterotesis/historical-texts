<P>IT is impossible for any honest man to contemplate the present situation of publick affairs in this state without being sincerely affected at the scene. The baneful influence of an interested and designing faction enters so deeply into many of our measures that insensibility itself must soon be awak∣ened with the consequences. Hardly warm in the seat we already feel ourselves goaded with many of the vices and infirmities of the oldest governments. To what infatuation or fatality this has fallen to be our lot it has become the duty, as it is evidently the interest, of every good citizen to inquire. In such a research philosophy and the deepest political skill, acting by scientifick rules at a distance, would con∣fess themselves at a loss; for as (according to Black∣stone) democracies contain more the principles of publick virtue and goodness of intention than other forms of government, we ought, by the rules of theory, in our infant state at least, to be freest from the evils now complained of; and this makes it ob∣vious it is not in the nature of the system, (that hav∣ing confessedly the preference to all others) but in the venality and corruption of some individuals a∣mong us, that the distemper lies.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="018430_0003_0FA76BA082409578"/>
For some years past it has been the unfortunate doom of Georgia, more perhaps than any other state, to be split into factions. After having undergone a variety of mutations, these differences have at length terminated in two parties, whose preponderance will just depend upon the prevalence of right or wrong. On the one hand we behold a most powerful combi∣nation of individuals zealously embarked in the scheme of advancing their private fortunes on the ruins of every thing that is dear and valuable to the community. On the other we observe a more virtu∣ous, though a less active set of citizens, opposing such views, and counteracting knavery and vocifera∣tion with reason and argument. It is an old remark, that the wicked are infinitely more keen in the pur∣suit of bad actions than the good in opposing them. The former class having plunged themselves into an abyss of debt, now conceive, on the very principles of Catiline, that nothing less than an internal revolu∣tion can extricate them. To this diabolical end are all their measures indubitably directed, the most in∣jurious falsehoods are disseminated, and whatever seems best calculated to create distrust and jealousy against those whose fortunes offer a security for con∣fidence, and whose private characters command re∣spect and esteem, is most industriously propagated. To be a man of either reputed honesty or unembar∣rassed circumstances is at once to be at enmity with this confederacy of citizens. Governed themselves by no considerations but those of lucre, they, with an effrontery peculiar to the wicked, concluded all other men acted on the same principles; they were bold enough to suppose that a similarity of interest would at all times inspire a similarity of sentiment: But how egregiously have they been deceived, when they now find that every man of honour, virtue, or property, has withdrawn from them, and they stand the sole champion of their own disgraceful under∣taking.</P>
<P>It has been for a long time artfully insinuated that
<PB N="3" REF="018430_0004_0FA76BA5C0280230"/>the disputes in this state lay between the purchasers of confiscated property and those who did not pur∣chase: But in truth the contest lies between those who have purchased without any intention or means of paying <HI>and others of the same complexion,</HI> and those who may or may not have purchased, but who ne∣vertheless mean the thing that is just and right to∣wards the publick. It is notorious that some very considerable purchasers are always to be found voting and acting on the side that evidently consult common good without any view to their private emolument. It is equally notorious that such gentlemen have in general paid up their bonds as far as the law allowed <HI>in certificates,</HI> and that they are able and willing to pay the remainder when it shall become due. Some of them indeed <HI>may</HI> contend for the reasonableness and justice of being allowed to pay the <HI>whole</HI> in cer∣tificates, by way of discount, if they can procure li∣quidated demands against the publick for that pur∣pose: And I confess there are strong reasons in fav∣our of such a mode being adopted <HI>now,</HI> which could not be allowed to operate at the time the law passed, making a distinction between certificates and specie. At that period the Legislature had not a precise knowledge of the demands against the publick, and therefore could not judge whether the means in hand were adequate to the end of a full payment, or whe∣ther it would be necessary to make a sort of compo∣sition and pay by installments: But when it came to be ascertained that the amount sales of our confiscat∣ed property, with the aids already provided, would be sufficient to sink all the debts of the state, and leave a very considerable balance behind, every rea∣son for a discrimination ceased to exist. But, even were such a discrimination to continue, it could not affect the honest and solvent purchaser; for, as the fund is discovered by comparison to be better than was apprehended, in the same proportion must the certificates or draughts upon it appreciate. Besides it is well known that any man holding a certificate,
<PB N="4" REF="018430_0005_0FA76BA7E06FE0F8"/>ever and above what he was allowed to pay upon his bond, might, with very little trouble and at no cost, make the same in every respect equal to specie, by throwing it into a particular fund of the state. In regard to officers demands, there never was, and indeed never can be, any objection against consider∣ing them as specie; whenever they come to be pro∣perly liquidated and certified, they will answer as well, by the resolves of Congress, in payments from this state to the Continent, as gold or silver: It is true the time limited by act of Assembly for bringing them in has elapsed, but I think there is hardly a doubt a longer indulgence will be granted when the Legislature meet.</P>
<P>Having drawn a line of distinction between the purchasers of confiscated property, I shall only ob∣serve, that, in a general way, the men who make most noise and pother against the law, because it does not allow them to pay the <HI>whole</HI> of their bonds in certificates, are those who have not paid the <HI>half</HI> they might have done in that way, although the time al∣lowed for such purpose has run out. Men of so scandalous a conduct are little better than pests to society; their motions ought to be narrowly watched, for it is demonstrable that, whatever may be the os∣tensible plea or pretence, ambition, avarice, and dark design, lurk at the bottom, and give a certain suspicious cast to all their proceedings.</P>
<P>The two principal heroes of this confederacy are said to be men remarkably well associated—the one in the full and indisputed possession of that kind of subtle midnight cunning which formed a Missisippi scheme, or a South Sea bubble, more the result of a bad heart, and a plodding temper, than the charac∣teristick of genius—is never so guarded as when he pretends most to vaunt himself upon his candour;— the other, versed in all the little tricks of life, hav∣ing passed through the different gradations from the lowest mechanick to the highest law officer, finds it as easy to explain away a forgery as to assassinate a
<PB N="5" REF="018430_0006_0FA76BA958196B18"/>character. The former of these feels no qualms of conscience in attesting, and thereby procuring to be audited, an account against the publick for a consi∣derable crop which he neither planted or reaped, and was only in possession of during the time Count d'Estaing lay before the lines of Savannah: The latter with amazing facility can extract a legacy from the dead which the living never thought of, and, by the magick of law language, in order to elude an act of Assembly highly favoured by him in every other re∣spect, clearly evince, that, "if A. bequeaths a le∣gacy to B. his next heir and nearest of kin, if B. af∣terwards takes possession of the property, and be∣comes attainted and banished, that in that case B. <HI>being dead in law,</HI> shall be considered <HI>as having never lived,</HI> and the legacy being lapsed shall fall to the next of kin, who has married a friend to the Revolu∣tion;" and of which last circumstance who is so fit a judge as the expounder of the laws? Under so <HI>just</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> a <HI>law case</HI> as this, it is no secret that fifty-three very valuable slaves have passed from the funds of the state to the plantation and pocket of the C—J—. Whether at a future day, when this business comes to be inquired into, the 13th section of the Confiscation Act, which declares such em∣bezzlements and conversions to be felony, may not have some operation, is not for me to determine.</P>
<P>This redoubtable duumvirate lately, under the signature of Brutus, (two in one, like man and wife) made a most angry attack upon the conduct of the present Administration. They had read, or been told, this was the usual mode of introduction with the young orators of Rome; but the several grounds upon which they raised their battery having failed them, the only product of their labours has been an addition to the infamy of their characters. In respect to those against whom the envenomed shafts were pointed, they, as became the dignity of their stations, and the fortitude of mind inseparably attached to an upright demeanour, treated their adversaries with silent
<PB N="6" REF="018430_0007_0FA76BA9B00E17F0"/>contempt; they had wisely implanted in their breasts, and now called in to their aid, the maxim of Lord Bacon, that "to suffer scandal is a tax which every person of rank pays to the publick, and the man who has no virtue in himself ever envies virtue in others."</P>
<P>We are now upon the eve of a new election of officers; it is therefore a more than ordinary duty, for every man who has a vote to give, to make him∣self well acquainted with characters. The principle of jealousy being the soul of liberty, when properly understood and liberally applied, is just and right; but, if we permit this laudable jealousy to become synonimous with mean suspicion, we shall do ourselves a material injury. Can we expect any man of honour or spirit will serve us, when he is certain, that, to accept an office in the state is to begin his journey on the high road of censure and abuse? The perpe∣tual clamours and impeachments in Athens, against the best citizens of the commonwealth, at length produced a general backwardness among good men to engage in publick affairs, and left the way open for the ambitious and the designing. And we read, in the History of Syracuse, that, when the Petalism was erected there, in imitation of the Ostracism at Athens, (and perhaps not unlike the <HI>Toryism</HI> of Brutus and his junto in Georgia) it was so notoriously levelled against all who had fortune or merit to recommend them, that whoever possessed <HI>either</HI> withdrew from the city, and would have no concern in the administration of government; so that the people themselves were forced to abrogate it for fear of bringing all things into confusion.</P>
<P>In every free state the evil to be avoided is tyranny. That all government originates with the people is an axiom as uncontrovertible as necessary to liberty, but that the people themselves <HI>at large</HI> ought not to administer that government, further than by a dele∣gation of power to their representatives and officers, is also an essential point in the charter of freedom. The <HI>dominatio plebis,</HI> or the dominion of the mob, is
<PB N="7" REF="018430_0008_0FA76BAA7AA77508"/>the worst of all governments. In holy writ we find the raging of the sea and the madness of the people are classed together, and it is God alone who can say to either, hitherto shalt thou pass and no further. Most of the convulsions of government in Greece and Rome began with the tyranny of the people, but they generally concluded in that of a single person. The lesson I wish to inculcate from this is, that, although the mass of the people is the body wherein naturally and originally resides that absolute and un∣limited power, which in every government is neces∣sarily supposed to be somewhere, yet the only use a wise people will make of such power is, at certain stated periods, to elect or appoint fit persons for their rulers; after such appointment, to invest them with a confidence equal to the trust they are charged with; to protect them against the tongue of slander, and the arts of designing men, <HI>when they do right;</HI> and to punish them, in a regular and constitutional way, <HI>if they do wrong.</HI> When this comes uniformly to be our rule and maxim, we shall be a happy and a flou∣rishing people; till then we may lay our account to be the dupes of every factious demagogue who wants a step ladder to climb into consequence, or feels a lust of being richer than his neighbour.</P>
<P>The great article of arranging our finances has been but little attended to in this state; it is chiefly, though not altogether, owing to this, that our po∣litical, as well as commercial importance, are so far behind hand in comparison with some other states. There cannot exist a doubt but that we possess a country which, for fertility of foil, conveniency of water carriage, and every agrarian or other advant∣age whatever, yields to none on the continent: But yet, to all these bounties of nature it is necessary that we add the refinements of art, and, by a due culti∣vation of the moral, learn rationally to enjoy the physical blessings of life. We may assure ourselves, that money is not more the sinews of war than the pillars of peace, and if we suffer ourselves to be se∣duced
<PB N="8" REF="018430_0009_0FA76BAB17939560"/>into an idea that any modern government can maintain its dignity and safety, or discharge its or∣dinary functions, without taxes, we shall find our∣selves woefully deceived, and ere long discover our mistake and our punishment together. We have a large sum as our quota of the several requisitions and debts to pay to Congress. This money must be raised, and an act of Assembly, passed on the 29th July, 1783, has declared it shall be raised, and paid out of the confiscated property. But what prospect is there of this, whilst, on the one hand, it is part of a system with some not to pay without being sued, and, on the other, we have for our C— J— a man who is himself among the deepest in the pub∣lick books? This single consideration furnishes the best answer that could be given to the sixth present∣ment of the Grand Jury of Chatham county, and is partly the cause and partly the effect of the evils complained of in the seventh. Our Constitution, and all the laws passed since the Revolution, in re∣spect to the Judiciary Department, have had for their object a cheap and a speedy course of justice; but how clearly is <HI>law</HI> convicted of being a <HI>mere dead let∣ter,</HI> when we see a bill of costs, for two or three trifling motions and arguments about an administra∣tion, taxed at 22<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 17<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> sterling, and are told that suits, especially where the poor publick is plain∣tiff, seldom come to an issue under two years after their commencement. I have heard of an eminent lawyer who boasted he would defy any Parliament to make a law that he could not drive a coach and six through. It is very possible <HI>our Lord Coke</HI> may not be able to gild the pill so well as that lawyer; but I will venture to answer for him, that, if he cannot leap the fence, he will break it down in pursuit of his prey. Can any words be stronger or plainer than these: "All the costs attending any action in the Superior Court shall not exceed the sum of three pounds, and that no cause be allowed to depend in the Superior Court longer than two terms?" 48th
<PB N="9" REF="018430_0010_0FA76BABCDD57548"/>section of the Constitution. By the 4th clause of the Superior Court Law, passed on the 1st March, 1778, the three pounds are thus apportioned:

<P>Here we see there is not only an error in the ag∣gregate sum, but also that the <HI>proportion</HI> of its parts is entirely inverted; for whereas the Constitution and the law intended that the Attorney should be allowed most, as having the greatest share of trouble, and that the Chief Justice and the Clerk should be upon a footing, in this bill we find the Chief Justice has taken the lead, and taxed nearly as much for himself as for the other two put together. It was thought a very great point in England gained by the people, when, after the Revolution, the Judges were made partly independent of the Crown; the completion of that independence has been almost the only popular thing afforded to Britain in the reign of George the Third. Would to God <HI>our</HI> Judges were more independent of their interest than they are, and that the laws would act in unison with the petition taught by our Saviour, <HI>Lead us not into temptation.</HI></P>
<P>It may possibly be objected, that a hearing in re∣gard to an administration is not in nature of a suit, and therefore does not come within the words of the Constitution; if so, I shall answer, 1stly, That it is
<PB N="10" REF="018430_0011_0FA76BAC866AE9F0"/>evident this hearing was considered, in the eye of the law, infinitely <HI>loss,</HI> both in point of expence and con∣sequence, than a regular suit, for the last clause but two of the Superior Court Act allows either party to appeal therefrom to a jury, in manner pointed out by the 40th section of the Constitution; and the whole costs upon this second trial, with all the for∣mality of process, and so forth, were not to exceed 3<ABBR>l.</ABBR> but, 2dly, there is no necessity to confine ourselves to one bill of costs, when there is so great a choice; there are fifty ready to be produced, wherein the costs, on a trial by process and jury, in the usual way, are taxed at upwards of twenty pounds. I need not instance them, because they are known to every body, and felt by a great many. My reason for selecting this case of the administration was, because it had been taken up by a Grand Jury, and also because there are other circumstances of aggravation in it be∣sides the exorbitancy of the fees. I am well informed, that, after the hearing was had, the C— J— ar∣bitrarily struck out the name of one of the defendants, and inserted in its room the name of the Attorney who had appeared in the cause, a gentleman who had never laid claim to any part of the subject in dispute, and who had left the state on publick business at the time this happened. I am also well informed, that only one of the defendants was taken into custody on the attachment of contempt, and he illegally detain∣ed by order of the C— J— until he had paid the fees of all. I shall, after a few remarks, leave it to the lawyers (as perhaps they may have an opportunity at some future day) to determine how far an attach∣ment of contempt was a legal process in this case; if it was, then there is nothing but the crime of ex∣tortion, with the oppressive conduct before mention∣ed, to be imputed to the C— J—; if it was not, then either a gross ignorance or palpable violation of the law must make an additional charge against him. It would be a great misfortune to a country if a Judge should consider himself as a <HI>planet in opposition</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="018430_0012_0FA76BAD46072AC8"/>to the Constitution, insomuch as that strictly to be influenced by the latter should be deemed a con∣tempt to him: However, waving all apprehensions of this sort, I venture to pronounce, that a writ of contempt, in the case alluded to, was just as regular as it would be for the costs upon a verdict or nonsuit in any other case. I know very well that Attornies, or other officers of the Court, and even parties themselves, are sometimes liable to these kinds of writs for disobedience to a rule or order made <HI>in the progress</HI> of a cause, or by non-payment of costs a∣warded by the Court upon a motion or the like; but these are always upon matters arising <HI>in the course of a suit,</HI> and not at all attached to or connected with its issue, which determines who shall pay the costs, and gives a remedy for them. Besides, these writs are always awarded <HI>in Court,</HI> for a contempt <HI>to Court,</HI> and not at <HI>Chambers,</HI> where the power of Judges is much circumscribed in comparison to their <HI>curial</HI> situ∣ation. I must here take occasion to mention, that I observe most of the modern rules are dated from Chambers. Surely a Judge must be strangely igno∣rant of law who supposes an order made in his own house in vacation time can carry the same weight and authority that a rule made in open Court, with all the solemnity of a by-law, does: But, as an emin∣ent writer justly observes, it is a singular happiness to mankind that Providence seldom bestows great talents on wicked men; the ignorance of the head is oftentimes a useful clog upon the depravity of the heart.</P>
<P>Let us however act the fair part, and hear the J—e in vindication of himself. <HI>I caused full fees to be paid, in order to prevent delays and trifling in future.</HI> The term <HI>full</HI> we are, I presume, to understand in contra distinction to <HI>legal;</HI> for it would be charging his H—r with an absurdity to take them both in one sense. There are evidently two things implied: 1st, a difference between what the party did pay as a tax for his trifling and delay, and what he might only
<PB N="12" REF="018430_0013_0FA76BAE06522A00"/>have paid if he had not offended the J—e; and, 2dly, a discretion in the J—e to make that difference. Now, it is extremely clear that the Constitution hav∣ing determined the party should pay 3<ABBR>l.</ABBR> as the <HI>legal</HI> fees for trying his cause, the discretion of the J—e rose upon that, and determined he should pay 19<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 17<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> more, as the <HI>full</HI> fees for trifling with his H—r's precious time. It was surely merciful to stop where he did, for, as the Gauls told the Romans, <HI>Vae victis!</HI> in the hands of such judicial omnipotence. In fact this excuse is little better than that of a high∣way man, who should pretend he robbed a traveller of his purse of gold, in order to teach him more wit than to have carried it about him.</P>
<P>The vindication published in the newspaper also asserts, that the bill in question was taxed agreeably to act of Assembly. If by it be meant the act passed in February last, for the regulation of officers fees, I assert that several of the charges are not warranted by that law; but, even were they, a Judge ought to know (and upon any other occasion this gentleman would have told us) a law directly in the teeth and against the express words of the Constitution is void. We seem, however, to live under a most <HI>pliable</HI> Constitution; like Lord Peter's wine-mutton-brown-loaf in Swift's Tale of a Tub, it is one thing, it is another thing, it is any thing or nothing, as suits conveniency, or promotes interest. One day we are informed, that, let a judgment be obtained when it will in the course of the year, yet, that, by the 47th section of the Constitution, no execution can issue to levy for the money till the first Monday in March following; the next day we find this rule relaxed, and a judgment obtained, and an estate sold in the course of a summer. Again, we read in the second article of the Constitution, "And the Representatives so elected shall meet the first Tuesday in January fol∣lowing, at Savannah, or any other place or places where the House of Assembly for the time being shall direct;" but are told in a Chief Justice's Charge, that,
<PB N="13" REF="018430_0014_0FA76BAF25F32DF0"/>by these words, we are not to understand that the first meeting after the election of a new House is to be in Savannah, but in Augusta, and for this reason, that the preceding House <HI>intended</HI> to meet at the latter place in July last. It would have been but candid to mention also, that such of the Members (18 in num∣ber) as did meet in Augusta in July presented a paper (now to be seen of record in the Journals of Assembly) to the Executive Authority, recommending that the House should be called to meet thereafter at such time and <HI>place</HI> as the Governor and Council should deem proper; and that, in consequence thereof, on the pressure of publick business, the House were called, by proclamation, to meet in Savannah, on the first Wednesday in October; but that summons, like the adjournment, also failing of its end, left Savannah, and not Augusta, as the last place menti∣oned in the Journals of the State for the intended meeting of the Legislature. I must make a small di∣gression from the inconsistencies of the C—f, whilst I take a nearer view of this so much talked of question, viz. the proper place for the next meeting of the Assembly; but I promise to return to the subject a∣gain as soon as possible: To me it is of all things the most unaccountable, how any man, who has read the Constitution, and taken an oath to support it, can assent to the construction which the C— J— con∣tends for. Without doubt there is the same reason why the Executive Authority should have the power of altering the <HI>place,</HI> as of shortening the <HI>period,</HI> of adjournment; and the 20th section of the Constitu∣tion seems clearly to imply so: The Governor and Council are to shorten the time of adjournment <HI>upon any emergency:</HI> Surely they may alter the place <HI>upon any unforeseen casualty,</HI> such, for instance, as the town falling into the hands of an enemy; the plague, or even the smallpox, breaking out in it, or the like. But if these arguments have any weight, when ap∣plied to the House who actually made the adjourn∣ment, how much more forcible are they when ap∣plied
<PB N="14" REF="018430_0015_0FA76BB0C9E399D8"/>to a new House, who cannot be said to be in <HI>being</HI> until they meet, qualify, and take their seats in Savannah? It is ridiculous to suppose a former House of Assembly can bind a succeeding one, by a <HI>mere order,</HI> calculated for, and confined altogether to it∣self; indeed such an opinion is not only contrary to the 3d section of the Constitution, which declares e∣very Assembly shall politically perish on the day pre∣ceding the new election; and to the 7th, which de∣clares each House shall settle its own rules of pro∣ceeding; but is also flatly contradicted by the prac∣tice of every new House in drawing up rules for it∣self before the Members go upon business. Now, surely, if these rules do not survive the body which made them, the resolve of adjournment, which is no more than a rule of the House, cannot in the nature of things; besides, it is not unworthy of remark, that the Legislature, when they adjourned on 26th February last, did not then, or at any time previous thereto in the course of that session, (as they had sometimes before done) resolve that the <HI>next</HI> meeting of Assembly (whenever that might happen) should be in Augusta, but concluded with these words, "The House then adjourned, to meet at Augusta the first Monday in July next."</P>
<P>The Assembly may be considered as executing the <HI>will</HI> of the Convention; but why the House of 1784 should also have the power of making a will before their death, and appointing the House of 1785 the mere executors thereof, is what I cannot comprehend. It was evidently the intention of the framers of our Constitution, that, although, in the course of the year, the Legislature might shift about from place to place, to suit the conveniency of all parts of the state, yet that, at the beginning of every new House, they should take their departure and set out from one fixed meridian to wit, that of Savannah: And this was certainly acting in conformity to the senti∣ments of the ablest writers, who hold that all free states require that their government should be brought
<PB N="15" REF="018430_0016_0FA76BB106E866F0"/>back to its true and original principles every now and then; upon which very foundation our annual elec∣tions, and the other periodical changes provided for, are grounded: But I have dwelt too long upon so plain a case, and will now return to my strictures u∣pon some other parts of the C—'s conduct.</P>
<P>To form the character of a great Judge there ought to be a happy commixture of the amiable with the admirable qualities. Although the attainment of the first class in either of these descriptions may be be∣yond the reach of ordinary men, yet one would think caution and pride, the usual companions of little souls, would guard against such glaring inconsisten∣cies as the following: "Many cogent reasons con∣curred to induce me to suggest to the Grand Juries in the counties through which I have already rode the expediency of revising our Constitution: As I speak to men of intelligence it is sufficient only to mention it—if with harmony and temper you can go into the consideration of a subject so truly important to us all, I hesitate not to recommend it to you." C— J—'s Charge to the Grand Jury of Richmond county, March 1784. "The Constitution of our country contains the principles of liberty, which by attention may be improved into a basis on which the happiness of the community may rest with security—<HI>the time however for any kind of alteration is not yet ar∣rived.</HI>" Same C— J—'s Charge to the Grand Jury of Wilkes county, November 1784. He also, in his Charge in Liberty county in March last, after giving reasons why there was no time to be lost be∣fore the Constitution should be revised and altered, goes on to tell the Grand Jury, as a spur to their in∣dustry, that "people in the counties lying on Savan∣nah river are promoting petitions for that end, and I submit the example to your discretion and judg∣ment." Whether the people on Savannah river were promoting petitions I know not, but, even were it otherwise, it shews the enthusiasm of the Judge in the business proposed, and is at least as praise-worthy
<PB N="16" REF="018430_0017_0FA76BB1D430C708"/>as the speech of one of our Governors, who, in the year 1779, told the Assembly, by way of comfort, "that he had received authentick accounts that Swe∣den and Denmark had become additional pillars, by acknowledging the Independence of America."</P>
<P>It has never been my wish, and, however provok∣ed, never shall be my endeavour, to develope the conduct of any man in office, further than I think the good of society requires; with this profession, then, I hope I shall not be charged with a desire to gratify private spleen, or minister to the passions or prejudices of party, if I make a candid scrutiny into some late decisions in Court. I shall begin with the case of a Mr. Fox, a native and citizen of Georgia, who stood charged with murder.</P>
<P>On the arraignment of this person, it seems, he offered for his plea, "that he was not bound by any law of this state previous to the Definitive Treaty of Peace." The Court, without farther ceremony, on motion of the prisoner's Council, admitted him to bail. This defence, which was more properly in nature of a special plea in bar, than to the jurisdiction of the Court, could not be used as an argument for indulgence to the prisoner. Surely every evidence to shew his plea to be good, which he could ever ob∣tain, was now to be had; and if, instead of resting on the 6th Article of the Treaty, and setting up a plea of pardon, he chose to risque his life upon this issue, whether there was any law of the land against murder binding upon him prior to the Definitive Treaty of Peace, there was every reason for the Judges to settle the point without loss of time, lest so fatal a doctrine, subversive of the first principles of freedom, which will not suppose the law to be in the hands of any master, should impose itself upon others. The nice reasoning upon the allegiance due to the sovereignty <HI>de facto,</HI> and that <HI>de jure,</HI> and the distinctions admitted, or not admitted, between the two, did not at all enter into this business. The simple point would have been, whether an usurpation
<PB N="17" REF="018430_0018_0FA76BB280C3A5F0"/>virtually and <HI>ipso facto</HI> suspends the operation of all laws, as well those against offences <HI>mala in se</HI> as those only <HI>mala prohibita:</HI> And I think, without recurring to the laws or adjudications in the reign of Henry VII. when the disputes between the Houses of York and Lancaster came to be terminated, or to those of Charles II. after the Restoration, the very article it∣self in the Treaty of Peace is, by the strongest impli∣cation imaginable, a deadly wound to such a plea as this; for, surely, if no crime had been committed, no pardon would have been necessary. Thus cir∣cumstanced, the prisoner's defence resolved itself into a confession of the fact, but a denial of its criminality so far as respected him. Some centuries ago, in a Roman Catholick country, when men carried dispen∣sations in their pockets, such a plea might have been sanctioned by authority; but, at this period of time, <HI>and before so haughty a tribunal as ours,</HI> it is a little a∣stonishing that it could even be attended to; nay, more, that it should actually produce its intended effect, and, by a base sacrifice of law and common sense, consult the mere safety and conveniency of a supposed offender against the community. I wish to avoid saying any thing that can in the most distant point of view go to the merits of this unfortunate man's case—let God and the Country be his judges—My observations are all meant to be confined to the conduct of the Court upon his business, and <HI>that</HI> I am free to pronounce highly censurable. Under the Habeas Corpus Act, (the principles whereof are incorporated into, and, by the 60th section, made a part of our Constitution) had the prisoner demanded his trial in the first week of the term, or on the first day of the sessions, and had the Attorney General omitted to get the witnesses for the state when he might have done so, I grant that, in such cases, even murderers have sometimes, by the Superior Courts, (to whom we confided great powers, and from whom is expected great prudence) been admitted to bail: But I believe this is the first instance wherein a man,
<PB N="18" REF="018430_0019_0FA76BB340BC7618"/>against whom was found a bill of indictment for mur∣der, has ever been <HI>ordered out</HI> upon bail where the prosecutors pressed for trial, where the party himself had put his fate upon an issue that could neither re∣quire or admit witnesses, and where such indulgence was not pretended to be craved on the foot of any supposed hardship inflicted by the other party. If it be said, it was on account of the perplexed state the Court was thrown into, when this new and unexpect∣ed plea made its appearance, that the cause was ad∣journed over, I reply, that is impossible, for, if the Judges had ever read (and I will not suppose the contrary) the cases of Townly, M'Donald, Storey, and a number of others, in Foster's Crown Law, they would have found the subject so copiously and clearly handled, that, to be perfectly stupid; and to be at a loss in the business, would be the same thing.</P>
<P>Did any man in the world believe this lenity arose from a spirit of forbearance and mercy, or that there was the least particle of the <HI>milk of human nature</HI> in the composition of its author, Christian charity would induce forgiveness, and we should perhaps be won over to lose sight of the fault in a tenderness for the motive; but, when it is beyond contradiction, that the <HI>gentle usage</HI> this prisoner met with sprung entirely from the part <HI>his</HI> connexions, and <HI>their</HI> connexions again, have acted, and continue to act, <HI>on the little scale of politicks,</HI> it is too much for any man of spirit, sense, or justice, to tolerate it in a free country.</P>
<P>There is one other transaction of the last Court which I must take the liberty of saying a few words upon: I shall, I expect, be anticipated, in being supposed to allude to the case between an Indian and a Jew; God forbid I should feel, or be suspected of recommending, the most distant enmity on a religious score against either of these people; I mean to re∣gulate my observations by the rules of policy, as the affair respects the publick, and by the eternal laws of justice and truth, as it concerns the parties them∣selves. It seems a half-breed man, descended of a
<PB N="19" REF="018430_0020_0FA76BB460CB4B50"/>white father (who is also supposed to be of the race of Jacob) and a free Indian mother, had brought a suit against a full-blooded Jew; the Jew, ever upon the watch, took an exception against the right of the plaintiff to sue. There was really something so pe∣culiarly droll, in a contest about privilege between two men of this description in a Christian country, that, when I first heard of it, I could not help re∣peating a very vulgar saying of the pot to the kettle; however, the matter being referred to the Court, two against one decided in favour of the <HI>Israelite,</HI> and the poor <HI>Creekite</HI> was ordered to <HI>imparl</HI> until he could prove <HI>red</HI> was <HI>white.</HI> This naturally led me to in∣quire what were the rights of a free Indian, and what were those of a Jew, in this state. As it appeared to be at least a diverting speculation, I devoted some time to the inquiry, and, if the reader feels the same curiosity I did, he will not grudge a few minutes ex∣traordinary in perusing their respective claims. And now to the point: By the common law of the land the Indian seems to me to enjoy every privilege which the Jew does; and by the local Constitutions, or acts of Assembly, he certainly enjoys several which the Jew does not. To elucidate the former part of this position, it will be necessary to shew in what light these people respectively stood, and to consider whe∣ther there was any discrimination between them in England at the time our country was colonized from that kingdom, for I conceive that to be the common law of this land (indeed our Legislature hath declar∣ed so) which was the law of England at the time our charter is dated, to wit, on the 9th day of June, 1732. When a free people (say the writers on this head) migrate to a new soil, with intent to settle the same, they carry with them as their birthright all the laws of their mother country then in force, at least so much thereof as may be applicable to their own situation and the condition of an infant colony. This being acknowledged as a postulatum, let us now see what that law was.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="018430_0021_0FA76BB4BB89B300"/>
Judge Blackstone, in his Commentaries, (vol 1, page 425.) speaking of the protection granted in England even to Negroes who run away from their masters in America, thus expresses himself: "The law of England acts upon general and extensive prin∣ciples—it gives liberty rightly understood, that is, protection to a Jew, a Turk, or a Heathen, as well as to those who profess the true religion of Christ." So that we see the Jew stands upon a level with the African slave who deserts the employment of his master. Now, surely, we will not suppose a free Indian to be in a situation worse than a man of this description, but rather in a better; and by so much as his situation is better than that of the Negro, in the same ratio does he, from the words of Mr. Black∣stone, rise above the Jew. The only difficulty with me is, whether we ought not to consider the Indians within our state, and who are the aborigines of the soil, rather in the light of citizens than aliens. There is no moral obstacle to such a determination in respect to these people, as there is to the Jews, who are not at present considered as citizens in any part of the world but by the special favour and operation of some particular law. And this carries me to the se∣cond part of my position, viz. a view of the local Constitutions or acts of Assembly in favour of the In∣dians: These will be found to countenance very much the idea of citizenship which I have before advanced. An act, passed 25th March, 1765, in the first clause, expressly secures every right and privilege to the In∣dians in amity with us, which they ever enjoyed. In the 13th and 14th sections of the same law it is clearly implied, that, in the opinion of the then Le∣gislature, these people were at all times, and upon all occasions, to be esteemed as being precisely upon the same footing with Mulattoes or Meztizoes (or Jews or Turks) actually naturalized by a special act of Assembly. And it is well known that Indians, and the descendants of Indian women, have, in a variety of instances, both under the present and for∣mer
<PB N="21" REF="018430_0022_0FA76BB853834510"/>government, had grants of lands to them and their heirs, which is of itself conclusive evidence they were acknowledged to be citizens. But, even should we admit they were not citizens, they certainly are entitled to the rights of free aliens: What those rights are no man who has read Wood's Institutes, or turned over Jacob's Law Dictionary, can be ig∣norant of; but I shall make no comments, nor de∣tain the reader further than whilst I transcribe <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> passages out of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> very common books: "An alien may bring an action concerning personal property, and may make a will and dispose of his personal estate: This is to be understood of alien friends only, or such whose countries are in <HI>peace</HI> with ours." 1 Black. 372. Here we see, if the Indians are merely in <HI>peace</HI> it is sufficient; but they are more, they are actually in <HI>alliance</HI> with us, and therefore a judicial opinion incapacitating them from the right of suit is neither law or justice. "All personal acti∣ons he (an alien) may sue as on a bond, so likewise for words, for the common law, according to the laws of nations, protects trade and traffick; and not to have the benefit of the law in such cases is to deny trade." Yelv. 198. Moore, 431. "An alien enemy commorant (or tarrying) in England by the King's license, and under his protection, may maintain ac∣tions of debt upon bond, although he came not with safe conduct." Lord Raymond, 282. Here we see, if the Indians were actually at war with us, yet, by the common law of England, (which we have adopted as the law of our land) if we permit any one of them to tarry among us, he is not disabled from bringing suit even against a <HI>Christian citizen.</HI> But I shall now quit my Creek friend, and proceed to consider the case of the Jews, a people whose increase in any coun∣try is at once a compliment and a reflection upon it; a compliment upon its natural advantages, but an implied censure upon its moral system or administra∣tion of government. An ancient writer observes, the Jews always insinuate themselves most into favour
<PB N="22" REF="018430_0023_0FA76BB9F41AF188"/>among those nations who remain in darkness and in the shadows of death. I shall not waste my own time, or trespass on the reader's patience, in demonstrating whether these people ought most to be tolerated in a republick or in a monarchy. In truth the Jews now-a-days enter very little into politicks further than to favour that system which is most promotive of their pecuniary interest, the principle of lucre being the life and soul of all their actions. If indeed they have any choice as to governments, it must be in favour of a monarchy, for there are no people so wedded to their old institutions as the Jews, and we all know that, from the earliest accounts, they have been ac∣customed to an arbitrary, though not always to an hereditary government. At first the fathers of fa∣milies, and the eldest sons after them, exercised un∣limited power, both civil and ecclesiastical, as kings and priests, over the rest; they had authority to bless, curse, cast out, disinherit, or punish with death, as they thought proper, in their own houses. In Moses's time the civil jurisdiction came to be se∣vered from the ecclesiastical, but with no abatement of power or rigour in either; for whilst Moses, and after him Joshua, were absolute leaders, Aaron and his posterity were high priests, more arbitrary than subsequent popes. After these came judges, who, when once elected into office, were as despotic as dictators; and the sanhedrim, who filled up the chasm between judge and judge, had also very great powers conferred on them. The whole concluded in a monarchy, beginning with Saul, and continuing until the Captivity. They were after that event for a long time bandied about under the Persian mon∣archs, and the ten captains of Alexander the Great. At length the sceptre was entirely removed from the House of Judah, and came to be vested in King Herod, who was of a branch no ways descended from the <HI>holy stock.</HI> At what particular time they came into England is not ascertained; however they cer∣tainly were there in the time of William the Con∣queror,
<PB N="23" REF="018430_0024_0FA76BBB60666730"/>for we find in history that that monarch, for a large sum of money, granted the Jews the privilege of living in a certain part of England <HI>as his mere vas∣sals, their persons and goods to be considered as his alone, and they were to dispose of neither without his license.</HI> They continued in such situation, with the addition of some few privileges, never as citizens, but, ac∣cording to Molloy, (vol. 2d, pages 293 and 294,) <HI>"as most absolute bond slaves and exquisite villains, obliged to wear a badge and table on their outmost garment, as well females as males, to distinguish them from Christians, and not privileged to sue but by special license of the king,"</HI> until their insolence, oppressions, and usury, not∣withstanding all these restraints, had risen to such a heighth as to become a grievance to the nation. Then it was that Edward I. in the 18th year of his reign, at the earnest solicitation of his Commons, published an edict in Parliament for the total and absolute ba∣nishment of all Jews from every part of his dominions, and if, after a limited time, any of them were found within the same, they were to be hanged. The ac∣counts of these times tell us, they had proceeded so far in their superstitious wickedness, that it became a custom among them, on a Good Friday, to steal a Christian child, and privately to crucify him in deri∣sion of his religion. From that time the Jews stood banished the dominions of England until the great civil war in the reign of Charles I. During the confu∣sions of that period, they, by some means or other, with the help of long purses, found an opportunity of reintroducing themselves; they remained, how∣ever, extremely limited in their privileges, up to the time out charter was granted; nay, it was not until the commencement of the present century that they were admitted to the common privilege of benefit of clergy in any case whatever. (See Foster's Crown Law, 306.)</P>
<P>Thus I have travelled with the Jews through a wilderness of history, from the time of their patriarchs down to the settlement of Georgia; if I have been
<PB N="24" REF="018430_0025_0FA76BBB8D362808"/>particular or lengthy, the reader will excuse it, when he reflects it was necessary to shew in what light the Jews stood in England when our first settlers emigrat∣ed from that country, in order to ascertain the privi∣leges they are now entitled to in Georgia; for I do not know that a single law has ever been passed by our own Legislature in their favour, either before or since the Revolution. As to the 56th article of our Constitution, it says no more for them than it does for the Bramins of China, or the Mussulmen of Tur∣key, <HI>they shall have the free exercise of their religion, provided it be not repugnant to the peace and safety of the state.</HI> Whether this <HI>proviso,</HI> applied to the Jews, does not abrogate the preceeding words, I refer to the opinion of others; at all events, there is nothing in it that promises them any more than a more reli∣gious privilege; not a word in the whole clause, by the most forced construction, can be made to sig∣nify a grant of any civil right whatever. I am aware these people have hitherto laid great stress on the statutes of 13th and 20th Geo. II. and 2d Geo. III. which make two years service in a military capacity, or seven years constant residence in America, work a naturalization in any Jew; but a moment's reflection will convince us these statutes are rather against the Jews than for them, as matters now stand; they evi∣dently imply and prove, that, by the common or o∣ther laws of force, previous to the 13th Geo. II. there was some moral obstacle in the way of a Jew's acquiring the rights of citizenship in America which could only be removed by the authority of Parlia∣ment. Now, this being admitted, the only question will be, whether these statutes are of force in Geor∣gia or not. This is a question that turns upon the same hinge that the Stamp Act, the Tea Act, and all the other acts which we declared unconstitutional, did; the criterion was not the expediency of these laws, but the right in the makers to bind us by them. The people of Georgia ceased to be represented in the British Parliament in the 5th year of the reign of
<PB N="25" REF="018430_0026_0FA76BBC4217EB50"/>George II. when they migrated to this new soil; the first of these Jew Acts was passed eight years af∣terwards; then surely, upon the very principles of our Revolution, it cannot be considered as of force here without having been adopted by our own Le∣gislature; <HI>that</HI> never having been done, the conclu∣sion in the breast of every Revolutionist inevitably is, that the Jews in Georgia at present stand upon the same footing they did in England in the year 1732; what that footing was I have already shewn to be that of aliens, who never can become citizens but by the aid of the Legislature. Indeed every man knows that at this day no Jew becomes a citizen in England but by virtue of a special act of Parliament for naturaliz∣ing him. There is scarcely a session but several of these laws pass, which are said to cost, one way or other, near 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> each. The terms of naturalization even then amount to this, that the Jew shall renounce his errors and turn Christian, which he is obliged to evidence by taking the sacrament, as required by stat. 7th James I. There was, in the 16th year of George II. an attempt made, and an act actually passed, for dispensing with the test of the sacrament in respect to Jews before they were naturalized, but the clamours of the people rose so high that the Par∣liament were compelled, after a very few months trial, to repeal this law, and leave the Jews where they were before.</P>
<P>After having said so much against the Jews, it may probably be suspected I am not only an enemy, but that I wish to stir up a spirit of intolerance against that dispersed and unhappy people. Let me tell the reader, I am as far removed from being a votary of friend to persecution as any man upon earth. Had the Jews in this state but conducted themselves with common modesty and decorum, I should have been the last person to point out their disabilities; on the contrary, I should have been hap∣py to give my voice for sectling every just and rea∣sonable privilege upon them, or even to have gone
<PB N="26" REF="018430_0027_0FA76BBD00AE4930"/>farther, and permitted them to enjoy by <HI>curtesy some</HI> which it would be impossible to concede of <HI>right</HI> in any Christian country. But, when we see these people eternally obtruding themselves as volunteers upon every publick occasion, one day assuming the lead at an election, the next taking upon them to direct the police of the town, and the third daring to pass as jurors upon the life and death of a free man, what are we to expect but to have Christianity <HI>enacted into</HI> a capital heresy, the synagogue become the establish∣ed church, and the mildness of the New Testament compelled to give place to the rigour and severity of the Old? The most distant apprehension of which e∣vils is sufficient to rouse any man into action who values either his civil or religious liberty.</P>
<P>It may possibly be said that no people can be blamed for pushing their pretensions as far as they are permitted, that it is in the nature of man to thirst after privilege and pre-eminence as much as it is af∣ter money, and that therefore it is not to the Jews, but to our Christian officers, we ought to impute the blame. All this I will in some measure grant, but, at the same time, desire leave to remind these people they stand exceedingly in their own light, when they venture so far under the auspices of any one man, especially an officer whose office, and in all probability whose consequence, will expire with the year.</P>
<P>The Jews are a race of men well acquainted with the scorns and persecution of all the rest of the world: Surely, then, it was a most forward, not to say un∣guarded action, in one of these, whose religious si∣tuation makes him the most vulnerable man on earth, to endeavour to disfranchise an Indian of a privilege which he himself held by the slender tenure of good-will; indeed, if we believe Mr. Adair, in his History of the Indians, we might go farther, and call it a most <HI>injudaic</HI> action, for that writer strongly insists the Creek Indians and the Jews are very nearly allied; he hazards a conjecture that the former are
<PB N="27" REF="018430_0028_0FA76BBDD30C6760"/>really and truly one of the Tribes of Jacob, who came, by some means or other, to be lost in the wilds of America.</P>
<P>I cannot take my leave of the Jews without saying a word more as a tribute to justice, and I do no more than this, when I acknowledge there is one whole family (and perhaps to these might be added two or three other individuals) whose long residence, upright demeanour, and inoffensive conduct, in this state, have always claimed, and now procure for them, the countenance and esteem of every honest Christian; the only <HI>badge</HI> I ever wish to see any of this house, or their connexions, (especially the fe∣males, who are by far the largest part) wear, is what they have always carried, "the approbation of the good." It is really remarkable that, in the bitterest moods against this singular people, there should always occur <HI>a remnant to be saved.</HI></P>
<P>Were I disposed, as I really am not, to canvass every act of the Judiciary that appeared liable to re∣prehension, I could fill volumes instead of a single pamphlet; but I confess myself already tired with a subject which exhibits nothing but memorials <HI>on the dark side of human nature.</HI> As far as lies with the Head of this Department, it is obvious to all that the end of one ridiculous situation is only the beginning of another. Had this gentleman any feeling, he must be convinced his conduct is not approved of by the country: the very common compliment of thanks for his charge is withhold in all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st presentments that I have seen; and no wonder, when the main scope of such charges was to stir up parties and dissensions throughout the land; instead of being a preserver of the peace, as his oath and duty require of him, it is evidently his object to disturb the repose, and thereby impede the welfare of the community. The Grand Jury of Chatham county gave but an <HI>inkling</HI> of the light in which they viewed him; and why an oppor∣tunity was not afforded to the people of Effingham to convey their sense, in the form of presentments, is
<PB N="28" REF="018430_0029_0FA76BBE8CC9E148"/>a matter that the Representatives of that county will no doubt demand an explanation of.</P>
<P>It was my intention to have said something on the famous adjudication respecting our trade; but as that point has been already discussed by others, and as I have exceeded the limits I had prescribed for myself. I shall leave so <HI>unfounded a thesis</HI> to perish by its own absurdity and impolicy. The idea of a Treaty of Commerce being necessary to entitle a foreigner to sue for a debt is too puerile to deserve a serious refu∣tation. If this were <HI>law,</HI> we could have no trade with Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Russia, and half the other powers of Europe, together with all those of Asia and Africa.</P>
<P>Were it an article of our political creed that the freedom of a people depended on the emptiness of their Treasury, there could not be more backward∣ness than there is in the payment of publick debts. In February last, an act passed, laying an impost upon shipping, and a duty on goods imported. This would prove some aid to our Treasury, were the mo∣nies collected, but unfortunately a clause, granting four months indulgence to all who should desire it, was annexed to the law, and the consequence has been, that, when the duties came once to be <HI>bonded,</HI> the parties either considered the debt as paid, or pro∣cured drafts upon the Treasury sufficient to balance the account by the time it became due. In either case no cash is brought into the Treasury: And here I must observe, that I consider these circulating Trea∣sury notes as big with evil consequences; at best they are mere expedients, generated <HI>by the spur of the occasion,</HI> and all expedients in government im∣ply a defect in the organization or conduct of the machine. Every draft is an anticipation of so much of our funds; and, if we go on without know∣ing or determining precisely how far we may afford to anticipate, the consequence <HI>may</HI> be, that the ex∣penditures of one year will mortgage the revenue of ten.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="018430_0030_0FA76BBF6154CA88"/>
The general account of our fiscal concerns for the present year, not yet being laid before the publick, I am unable to say any thing about them. I should however imagine that our expences, with the utmost frugality, and although we have had but one session of Assembly, cannot full short of 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> In this sum I do not include one sixpence of what we owe on the federal score. It would astonish nine tenths of the people to hear, if my information is just, what a bagatelle has been as yet brought into the Treasury to oppose to this sum. The last year had no such difficulties to struggle with as the present, for al∣though the taxes were trifling, yet the amercements and cash sales were very considerable. I have been told, that, in the year 1783, the amercements col∣lected amounted to 4186<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 5<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> and that the cash sales of confiscated property are credited at 5250<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10½<ABBR>d.</ABBR> These resources being entirely exhausted be∣fore the commencement of the current year, the Duty Bill was intended to supply their place; but how far short it has fallen of general expectation I leave to the candid decision of every honest member of the community.</P>
<P>I shall not at present make any particular remarks on the fund arising from our confiscated property. The amount sales were indeed prodigious, but what will be the neat balance after payment of the debts of these proscribed persons I can form no probable guess. I have heard that, when the Assembly last sat, the bonds in the Treasury on that account amounted to 288,253<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 19<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> how many more have been brought in since I know not.</P>
<P>There are, I believe, many and great demands still remaining against these estates; what channel they will next be thrown into for liquidation and settlement I am unapprized of; in my judgment there can be none so proper, or conducive to publick good, as that of the Auditor. Could the gentleman who has nearly gone through the Herculean task of auditing and arranging the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the state
<PB N="30" REF="018430_0031_0FA76BC007CADB98" MS="y"/>be prevailed upon to undertake this, I am persuaded it would diffuse general pleasure. To the honour of this Officer let me bear testimony, as far as I have had an opportunity of observing, that, even under the disadvantage of an infirm state of health, the ef∣fects of his zeal, fidelity, and abilities, have been conspicuous: Whilst on the one hand, he has done ample justice, under the article of <HI>savings,</HI> to his country, on the other, he has had the singular for∣tune to render satisfaction to the individuals concern∣ed. For <HI>him</HI> it was reserved to bring forth order from confusion, and to reduce a chaos of claims into a system of accounts.</P>
<P>Having now waded through the drudgery of a re∣trospective examination, I shall take my leave of the publick, without any apology for the plain garb in which my observations appear. Written as they were in haste, and on a subject rather dry, it was impossible I could be studious of the ornaments of style; if they carry the <HI>beauties</HI> of truth and justice, it is all I cover, or desire any credit for. In respect to any who may suppose themselves levelled at, I can only say, that I have endeavoured to avoid personali∣ties as far as the <HI>man</HI> could be separated from the <HI>actor.</HI> I have always strove to keep in view Sergeant Glynn's principle, in his defence of Woodfall, for publishing Junius's Letters, that, "though to speak ill of in∣dividuals is deserving of reprehension, yet all publick acts ought to lie open to publick examination, and it is a service done to the state to canvass them freely."</P>
