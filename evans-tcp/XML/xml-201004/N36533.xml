<HEAD>EXCELLENCY OF WISDOM.</HEAD>
<P>ALL wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever. Who can number the sands of the sea, or the drops of rain and the days of eternity? Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the
<PB N="6" REF="047760_0005_10248C0A72F26390"/>earth, and the deep? and wisdom, wisdom has been before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom. To whom hath the root of wis∣dom been made manifest, or who hath known her wise councils, or understood her great experience? There is one wise and greatly to be feared; the Lord sitteth up∣on his throne, he created her, and saw her, and poured her out upon all his works. She is with all flesh, ac∣cording to his gift; he hath given her to them that love him and as God has promised, 'Seek and ye shall find, ask and it shall be given unto you.' For secret things are with him, and none can find out the Almighty to perfection; for there was no man on earth or saint in heaven worthy to open the book or unloose the seals. (Rv. v. 5.) Behold the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to open the book and unloose the seven feals thereof; which doth open unto his servants his mind, and will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he makes them, his instruments for the doing of his work, in building his spiritual tem∣ple of lively stones, fitted and prepared by grace, and laid on the corner stone, a strong foundation, the rock of eternal ages, Jesus Christ, the son of God, as So∣lomon's wisdom and glory, and the magnificency of the house he built typified. (1 Kings ii. 45.) And King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever. And we see how wonderfully the Lord blessed him to make him king instead of his father David, to reign in Israel, and to bring a change of the times from wars and desolations, and to establish a peaceable kingdom; and for this pur∣pose the Lord appeared to him. (1 Kings iii. 5.) In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, 'Ask what I shall give thee.' Upon this Solomon begins to express with all his heart filled with thankfulness for the great mercies he had given his father, and that he had given him a son to set on his throne, breaks forth into prayer and praise, and acknowledges himself unable, being but a little child.
<PB N="7" REF="047760_0006_10248E33A9DF6FC8"/>I know not how to go out or to come in. Thy people is a great people that cannot be numbered for multitude; give, therefore, thy servant an understanding heart, that I may judge thy people, and discern between good and bad. Here is example for all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lers both of church and state. O my dear people, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> whom God has raised up to rule the states, give the people good laws, that you may enjoy a blessing and not a curse; and that your speech may please the Lord as Solomon's did: for he did not ask for long life, nor for riches, nor the life of his enemies; but understanding to discern judgment, and the Lord granted his request; and (1 Kings iii. 12.) so, I have given thee an understanding heart, and there shall be none like unto thee all thy days.</P>
<P>So King Solomon was king over all Israel, and all the princes were under him, and all the officers of his that ruled, every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> according to his charge, that they had over the work and the workmen which were employed in building the temple of the Lord at Jerusa∣lem; which typified, in a law dispensation, the glories of the gospel in the conversion of sinners, 1st. By Christ's mission declared by John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness, proclaiming liberty to captives, and the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound: and of the appearing of the promised Messiah that was foretold by all the prophets—and proclaimed by the wise men from the east, directed by a star to Bethle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m, where the young child was born and laid in a manger; which, in the fulness of time, at thirty years of age, he began his public ministry in proclaiming the truth of all the prophecies; and by his miracles, which he wrought before their eyes, which plainly testified to a sinful world of sinners, that he was the Christ that should come, and qualify and sit his workmen to build his temple: 1st. His apostles, which was sent through all the corners of the world, with the glorious news of salvation for poor miserable sinners; and their message was to them as Pharaoh said to the Egyptians, (Gen. xli. 55.) Go unto Joseph, what he saith, do.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="047760_0007_10248C0C98120C60"/>
And 2dly. By the preaching of his gospel, by his ministers that blow the trumpet in Zion, making an alarm in God's holy mountain, in bringing many sons to glory, by the captain of their salvation. And now, my brothers in tribulation, while you are proclaiming the works of faith with earnest prayer and praises, I'll employ my pen and write the glorious declarations of the full∣ness of the promises for the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter day, the glory of Je∣rusalem; while you, infant babes of Christ, in humble homage, fall prostrate at his feet, with cries that will pierce through the skies, and bring God's mercies down on a wretched world of sinners.</P>
<P N="1">1st <HI>Type</HI>—Gen. xli. 53. 'And the seven years of plenty that was in the land of Egypt ended, and the seven years of famine began to come, according as Jo∣seph had said, for the great dearth was in all lands, for the famine was over all the fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he earth. Then Joseph opened all-the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians, and all countries came unto Joseph to buy corn.' And we have had a glorious day of God's power spread abroad; so that the north has given up, and the south has not kept back, in bringing sons from far, and daughters from the uttermost part of the earth, as the queen of Sheba came to behold Solomon's glory. But a famine has succeeded; the winter has come on the seed; there is now but small gathering for the har∣vest men; the church seems to be on the loosing hand; the world greatly engrosses her heart; the love of many are waxing cold; she does not enjoy her first love; ini∣quity abounds, and antichrist rising and falling away. As the Lord hath said, shall I find faith upon earth when I come? 'the man of sin being revealed, which Christ will consume by the brightness of his coming.'</P>
<P N="2">2d <HI>Type</HI>—Sam. viii. 18. 'And ye shall cry out in that day, because of your king, which ye have chosen, for the Lord will not hear you in that day.' For Israel reject∣ed the Lord, that he should not reign over them, and desired Samuel to give them a king to fight their battles; and God gave them Saul in his anger, because they
<PB N="9" REF="047760_0008_10248E30BB6060E0"/>would not obey the voice of Samuel. And the Lord commanded Samuel to make known unto them the manner of the king that should reign over them, because they rebelled in asking a king; and which should bring them under tyranny to pay tribute, and made them ser∣vants and handmaidens; and he took their fields and vine-yards, and olive-yards, and the tenth of their seed, and the tenth of their sheep; and Saul warred against David, and envied him in his heart, fearing that David would possess his kingdom, which came to pass; for God raised up David to be king, to deliver his church, by destroying the Philistines. And in the troublesome times of wars and blood, he made preparation for the building of the temple, and brought in a peaceable king∣dom for his son Solomon.</P>
<P>And so God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iven unto the people of France, King Lewis the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>enth, and the kingdom of Popery which govern the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bjects with laws pernicious both to their souls and tyrannical in opposition to freedom, like Jeroboam's yoke, chastises them with whips and scor∣pions. But God will be avenged on such a wicked nation, to chastise the rebel kingdoms that give their strength to the beast; which we see is fulfilling by his power spread into kingdoms, and is magnifying himself against the god of armies, and doth not honour the god of forces; and when he shall go forth with all his force and craft, to make away many in destroying hundreds of thousands in gaining the conquest over large armies, and in pitching his tabernacle between the seas in the holy mountain, that is England, he shall come to his end without hand: then Babylon shall fall, which ruled over all nations; it will be the fall of the tenth part of the city, and seven thousand men slain, which is France; and the ruling offices of men will be no more. (Dan. vii. 27.) 'Then the kingdoms of this world shall be the Lord's under the whole heaven, and all nations shall serve and obey him.'</P>
<P N="3">3d <HI>Type</HI>—Of Solomon's kingdom and Temple.—There was Solomon's peaceable kingdom, when all the
<PB N="10" REF="047760_0009_10248C0E18F73088"/>wars ceased, a time made ready that the work of the Lord was to be done in, building a temple, exceeding magnificial of fame and of glory throughout all coun∣tries; and it was not to be done without king Hiram's help; for he sent to Solomon ships loaded with gold and silver, and cunning workmen for the engraving and running of golden vessels and skilful in all manner of work; but king Solomon was the head, inspired by God according to the pattern shewn him, which represented the glory of the gentile church that God would build up of spiritual stones, made ready from the rocks of sin, and polished with Christ's blood to shine in brightness like the sun in the firmament of heaven; and Hiram's kingdom represented the Jewish nation, which the Lord will join into one people in righteousness, and a nation will be born in a day. (Ezek. 34.) 'Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ong them that are scattered abroad; so I will seek my sheep and deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the dark and cloudy day.'</P>
<P N="4">4th <HI>Type</HI>—And as God created the world in six days, and rested the seventh from all his labour, and commanded the seventh day to be a holy day to be de∣voted to his service, a day of worship, and praise, and glory throughout all generations, to glorify God for all his works done for the children of men: so God will finish all the spiritual work of redemption in six thousand years, and the seventh thousand will be a Sabbatical Rest for the new Jerusalem Saints upon earth, that will re∣ceive life from the dead (Levit. xxv. 4.) 'The seventh year shall be a Sabbath unto the land, a Sabbath for the Lord; (Num. viii. 1.) and when thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick; (Num. xxviii. 25.) and on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation, ye shall do no servile work; (Num. xxix. 1.) and the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have a holy con∣vocation, ye shall do no servile work; it is a day for the blowing of the trumpets, and of an offering; there were
<PB N="11" REF="047760_0010_10248C0F9BBAFFC0"/>seven lambs of the first year without blemish, and an offer∣ing on the 7th day of seven bullocks. (Dt. xv. 1.) And at the end of seven years ye shall make a release, and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coasts seven days. (Deut. xxxi.) They read the law to the people every seven years; all which shew unto us the seventh part of time will be set apart for the glory of God.'</P>
<P N="5">5th <HI>Type</HI>—Joshua vi. 3, 4. 'And the Lord com∣manded Joshua, that he should compass the city of Je∣richo with all his men of war, and go round about the city once; thus shall ye do six days: and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram's horns; and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times: and the priests shall blow with the trumpets; and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horns, and ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout a great shout, and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up before him.'</P>
<P>This plainly sets forth, that our spiritual Joshua has been sounding the glories of his gospel by his prophets, apostles, and ministers, almost six thousand years; and when the ministry shall cease, which will end at the full period of six thousand years, this Jericho world shall be changed into a new heaven and a new earth, when the pride of nations will be consumed by the fire of grace, and the antichrist of superstition, idolatry, the Antinominian security, Mahometan and Pagan abomina∣tion that standeth in the holy place that maketh deso∣late, will receive the sickel of God's judgment, which will gather the clusters of the vine of the earth into the wine-press of Almighty God.</P>
<P N="6">6th <HI>Type</HI>—2 Kings ii. 19. 'The waters of Jericho healed, and the men of the city said unto Elisha, Be∣hold, I pray thee, the situation of the city is pleasant, as my Lord seeth; but the water is naught, and the ground barren: and he said, Bring me a new cruise and put salt therein; and they brought it to him, and he went forth to the spring of waters, and cast the salt in there, and
<PB N="12" REF="047760_0011_10248C118C2757E8"/>said, thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death, or bar∣ren land.'</P>
<P>And so God will cleanse Jerusalem from her filthi∣ness, when she shall say, I am no more sick, and I am freed from death, for her inhabitants will no more die, nor see corruption; the grave will no more cover her slain, nor death's gorging mouth rage its prey; no more doctor's to separate flesh and blood apart; no more hos∣pitals of ulcered, noxious bodies of groaning pains; no more lawyers pleading wrong causes, robbing the father∣less and widows; no more rich worldlings with hearts set on gain; no more false teachers that preach for the bag—are like Judas, that fold Christ for thirty pieces of silver; no more to trade with slaves and the souls of men. (Rev. xviii. 14.) 'And the fruits of that thy soul lusted after, are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.'</P>
<P N="7">7th <HI>Type</HI>—Jacob's serving for Rachel. (Gen. xxix. 15.) 'And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldst thou serve me for naught? Tell me what shall thy wages be? And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And when the time was expired, Jacob expected to enjoy his bride. Laban deceived him, and gave him, and brought in to Jacob his elder daughter Leah; and had to serve seven years more be∣fore he got Rachel, which was a sorrowful time of trouble to him to be kept from her whom he so much delighted in, with all his heart.' But it was so deter∣mined by God, that Leah represented the Jewish na∣tion, that the Lord had first in the world, she being the elder: and Rachel typified the bringing in of the Gen∣tiles in a gospel dispensation, and that their spread should be as extensive as the sun that runs its journeys round the world. And spiritual Jacob, when married to Rachel, the Gentiles' fulness come in, which will build Christ's Canticle Spouse, will make the Jews return—As the
<PB N="13" REF="047760_0012_10248C15DA06CBC8"/>Psalmist prayed, O that the salvation of Israel was come out of Zion. When God will return to deliver his people from captivity, Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad, and Jacob's great trouble of labour fourteen years, set forth the great troubles that the church should pass through while in this wilderness of sin and corrup∣tion; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat time has almost run out since the dread∣ful time God sent his rod on America, which since gave us a gospel day. And as soon as she gained her freedom from England's tyranny, it also took wings and flew over the Atlantic ocean to France, and cut off the King and Queen's heads—a beginning for everlasting fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom from the world, the flesh and the devil, the destruction of the beast, and a glorious righteousness as the drops of the morning dew upon the tender grass.</P>
<P N="8">8th <HI>Type</HI>—Est. ch. 1. 'Now it came to pass in the days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ahasuerus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich reigned from India unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and he sat on the throne of his kingdom, in a very glo∣rious palace; he made a feast unto all his nobles and princes, and servants, the power of Media and Persia of the provinces before him; when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honour of his excellent majesty many days: and his feast lasted seven days in the garden of the king's palace; and the Queen Vashti made a feast seven days; but she rejected the king's commandment, and was cast off, and was dispelled out of his kingdom, and he was wroth against her; and Esther was brought in before the king, and she pleased him, and he chose her instead of Queen Vashti; and the king made Esther his queen, and he gave unto her the odours and ointments for purification, and seven mai∣dens to wait on her. Now in Shushan, the palace, there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, and he brought up Esther as his own daughter; and also there was man whose name was Haman, which the king had promoted; and all the servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced Haman. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence; and they said, Why do
<PB N="14" REF="047760_0013_10248C175DFF7D38"/>you transgress the king's commandments? and they told Haman, and he was full of wrath, and sought to destroy all the Jews throughout the whole kingdom; and the plot was determined for the Jews' destruction in all the provinces. And when Mordecai perceived all that was done, he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry, even before the king's gate, and in every province where the king's letters came, that declared their death, there was a great mourning, fasting, and weeping, and wailing in sackcloth and ashes; and Mordecai shewed it unto Esther, and commanded that she should go in unto the king, and make supplication unto him, and to make request for her peo∣ple: and Esther returned an answer to Mordecai, say∣ing, Gather all the Jews, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink, three days; and I will go in unto the king, which is not according to the law, and if I perish I perish. And so the King and Haman came to ban∣quet with Esther; and when the book of records was read before the king, it was made known of a secret of two chamberlains, who sought to take the king's life, which Mordecai had made known, which gave him favour with the king; and also Haman's wickedness was revealed by Esther to the king: and the king granted the queen's petition for the deliverance of her people; and the adversary, wicked Haman, was con∣demned and hanged on the gallows of fifty cubits high, that he had erected for Mordecai: so the Jews received a great deliverance, and kept the fourteenth day of the month Adar, a day of gladness and feasting and a good day, and of sending of portions one to another.</P>
<P>So, the method I take to explain this passage—1st. As King Ahasuerus' kingdom was so large and extensive, and his excellent majesty and riches which he shewed to all his nobles and princes; and he received their re∣verence by bowing before the king; so God the Father, the Almighty King that rules over all the kingdoms of this world, will make them bow at his footstool.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="047760_0014_10248C19B6D48B78"/>
2d. Mordecai's great work for the deliverance of his people, shews us of Jesus Christ's great and wonderful deliverance of his church; and as Mordecai was in sack∣cloth in great distress for the Jews' calamity and de∣struction which was determined by Haman; so Jesus Christ lay in the garden of Gethsemane in the greatest extremity and pain, so as to sweat great drops of blood; which wrought a glorious salvation for his people. And as disobedient Vashti rebelled against the king's com∣mandment, and would not obey his request, he rejected her, and cast her off, which shewed forth the rejection and casting off the Jews and the rebel kingdoms of Sa∣tan's empire, the whore of Babylon, which sitteth a queen riding on a scarlet beast, the abomination of the earth; and as Esther was received instead of Vashti, for she pleased the king, and he loved her, and granted her request, for a great mercy to the Jews: so God was to bring in the gentiles of a gospel-day, which will make up their fulness; then the Jews will return and inherit the promises. And as Haman was a wicked, haughty, proud man, filled with envy, hatred, and malice against Mordecai and the Jews, which accused him to the king for being disobedient to the king's commandment; Haman sought to take his life, represented the devil's craft and subtlety to destroy men's souls, and make them his servants at his will: and as Haman was hanged, and his ten sons, so God will destroy the works of satan, and shew mercy to the ten kingdoms of the beast, and as two of the king's chamberlains, Bithan and Teresh, of those that kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hold on the king Ahasuerus; and the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified it to the king in Mordecai's name; so Christ knows all things; for secret things belong to the Lord, and he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets, and they pray to the king in Jesus' name to destroy the wickedness of Pope Papal, and Mahomet, which is the two kingdoms that is risen in wrath against
<PB N="16" REF="047760_0015_10248C8BAD2F8910"/>the king of nations; which these two men's rebellion shewed forth. (1 Kings xviii.)</P>
<P N="9">9th <HI>Type</HI>—There was a Jezebel in the days Ahab, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew and put to death the Lord's prophets, so that many hid themselves in coverts to save their lives; and there was a prophet whose name was Elijah; and Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? and he answered and said, I have not troubled Israel; but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and hast followed Balaam. Now, therefore, send and gather me all Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, that eat at Jezebel's table; so Ahab gathered them all to Mount Carmel, and Elijah came unto all the people and said, How long hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word: then said Elijah, I even only remain the Lord's prophet; but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men; give us two bullocks, and chuse one for yourselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire un∣der, and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it, and call on your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord, and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God; and they call∣ed till noon, saying, O Baal, hear us; but there was no voice, nor any that answered; and they leaped on the altar. And at noon Elijah mocked, and said, Cry aloud, for he is a God; either he is talking, or he is pur∣suing, or on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awakened; and they cried aloud, and cut them∣selves after their manner, with knives and lancets, until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, and not any regarded. And Elijah said, Come near unto me; and all the people came near, and he repaired the altar that was broken down; and he took twelve stones, ac∣cording to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel
<PB N="17" REF="047760_0016_10248C8D774CA1A8"/>shall be thy name; and he made a trench about the altar that would contain two measures of seed: and he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and filled barrels of water that run round the altar; and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, and the prophet said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, let it be known this day, that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord. Then the fire of the Lord fell and con∣sumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench; and when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, the Lord he is God; the Lord he is the God. And Elijah said, Take the pro∣phets of Baal and slay them; let not one escape. So God will 'ere long destroy all false prophecy; and as Elijah sent his servant to go up to the top of Carmel, and looked towards the sea, and he saw nothing; and he sent him seven times; then he saw a little cloud rising out of the sea like a man's hand: and the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. The little cloud is the smallness of the church; the black∣ness, clouds, and wind, is the distress of her labour and travail. But, when the seventh time will commence, it will rain a great rain of righteousness through all the earth; the dry and the thirsty pools will be filled.</P>
<P>Now I begin to explain the title of my book.</P>
<P>(Rev. i. 3.) For the time is at hand. There was a wonderful revelation made unto John in the Isle of Pat∣mos, of things that should shortly come to pass, which he was commanded to write. 1st. The states of the seven churches of Asia, both of such as were zealous for Christ's cause, and those that were but idol <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ship∣pers: and he sets forth the blessings of the Philadelphia church in a gospel state, and what she should be in a new Jerusalem glory. (Rev. iii. 8.) I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no
<PB N="18" REF="047760_0017_10248C8FB51FE250"/>man can shut it, for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. This is the state of the church that she is now in, Christ's true Church of the Gentites; and by the blessings of the pro∣mises, fulfilment in bringing in the latter day of glory, it will make up the fullness of the Gentile's temple from all nations and kingdoms converted to the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the great deep, which will bring in the false Laodicean Church and the Jews—(Rev. iii. 9.) Behold, I will make them of the syna∣gogue of Satan, to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. The false church says I am rich, and have need of nothing; but the word says thou art poor and wretched, blind and mise∣rable. This is the Antichrist that believe in their own righteousness, their own goodness, their false worship, superstition and idolatry, worshipping idols and images, wood and stone, untempered mortar, a daubing work that the fire has not refined; it is dross and dung, the barren land not dug nor ploughed, nor sowed with the seed of the woman, nor the serpent's head bruised; it is Priests' schemes of men's own invention, Popish schemes of hellish arts, the simple doth betray. But the time is at hand that the Lord will send judgment to victory, and deliver Zion universally, both Jews and Gentiles, and make them one nation and kingdom in a heavenly state upon earth. Consider, O wicked sinners, that the time, is at hand that you must die, and if unprepared, you will be damned. Also the Day of Judgment is near at hand that Christ will judge you according to your works, and receive a reward according to the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.</P>
<P>(Gen. xliii. 16.) And when Joseph saw that Benjamin was with them, Joseph feeding his brethren, typified Jesus Christ feeding sinners with the bread of his free grace in a gospel dispensation; and we see that Joseph did not dine with them till Benjamin was with them, not till they were all together; for he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, for these men
<PB N="19" REF="047760_0018_10248C9234E19518"/>shall dine with me at noon. So in the fullness of the Gentiles, which Benjamin the youngest son shewed forth: Then will be Jerusalem's feasting time, the feast of tabernacles, the Jew's feast of the bread of life, and life from the dead; and Joseph had a man that ruled his house, so Christ will have a glorified man of his coun∣cil that will be head and ruler in his spiritual kingdom: as God never did any of his work of his temple without an instrument, so he will send his messenger before him, that will be the refiner's fire, and the fuller's soap, that will burn and purify, and melt hardened hearts, and make them hearts of flesh, and will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, and consume the earth from the curse.</P>
<P>(Rev. xxii. 20.) He which testifieth these things, saith, surely, I come quickly. Amen. He which has spoken all the promises will fulfil them every jot and tittle; for God altereth not: and because God chang∣eth not, the seed of Jacob is not consumed; he will come quickly, and cut his work short in righteousness, because the Lord will make a short work upon earth: even so come Lord Jesus: this is the churches prayer in her state of this wilderness, travail and pain, as a woman with child, and is in pain to be delivered: and the churches birth-pains are not at the greatest extre∣mity; iti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not midnight yet, that she is slumbering and sleeping with the foolish virgins.</P>
<Q><L>Ye virgin souls arise,</L>

<P>Behold, your bridegroom will come and deliver you; he will ride on a swift cloud, and come into Egypt, and destroy the idols, and make the hearts to melt in the midst: but the Egyptian war must end first, and the cruel Lord and fierce king and kingdom must be de∣stroyed, and the kingdoms of this world must be given, to the saints of the most high, to live with Christ by the glory of his spirit one thousand years, to inherit all the
<PB N="20" REF="047760_0019_10248C9464776F18"/>glory of all the promises, freed from the world, flesh, and the devil; for Satan will be bound that thousand years, as you may read in the 20th of Rev. 1. And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having they key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand; and he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and satan, and bound him a thousand years. Perhaps some would enquire when this time will com∣mence. I do not set forth the certain time; but shew forth the events that appear to my understanding to be the preparations that God is making for his kingdom's glory. And these days are the churches imprisonment and great distress. But so far I determine, that if the ten days of tribulation and imprisonment is ten years, which is in Rev. ii. 10; then, from one thousand seven hundred and ninety, when the wars begun in France for the destruction of Popery and all the Antichristian powers: Then the fall of the Beast will be in the year eighteen hundred of Satan's binding. Then Michael shall deliver Israel from all their troubles. (Dan. xii. 1.) And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people, and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation; even to that same time, and at that time thy people shall be delivered. And it will be by wars and famine, and pestilence, which will be a great cutting off of nations. (Zach. xiii. 8.) And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein; and I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them say, it is my people; and they shall say, the Lord is my God. This work will be the first resurrection from the dead, as spoken by the prophet. (Ezek. xxxvii. 1.) By the resurrection of dry bones. The dead hope of Israel revived by the breath of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live. And behold, I will take the children of Israel and bring them into
<PB N="21" REF="047760_0020_10248C95F0D49C40"/>their own land, and will make them one nation upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all; they shall no more be two nations, neither shall the be two kingdoms any more, nor defile them with their idols, nor with their transgressions; but I will save them, and will cleanse them, and they shall have one shepherd typified by David; and I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will set my sanc∣tuary among them for evermore, and build them, and make their land like unto the garden of Ede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But, O ye mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit; for they are at hand to come. And Christ's Millennium Saints will live and reign upon the earth one thousand years in an immortal state of glory; and the dead saints that have gone to heaven, and their dead bodies buried in the grave, shall so continue till the thousand years are ended: then their souls will re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enter their bodies, and experience greater joy of heavenly b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s in Christ's holy kingdom of ever∣lasting happe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss, an endless eternity. Then they will ascend with their glorious king to judgment, when the Millennium Church will be changed to a greater glory to meet their Lord in the air at his second coming. (2 Pet. iii. 10.) But the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night, in the which, the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; the earth also, and the works therein shall be burnt up. Then the judgment will proceed that the wicked shall be judged in their bodies raised from death and hell; the spiritual war will commence of Gog and Magog, deceived a little season, a very short time, not a year nor a day, but an hour or less; for there was silence in heaven half an hour; so as to expect that their t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ted souls, that have suffered the wrath of God, bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed with wrath and malice against God and his sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the same state as they died, will expect to re∣ceive a deliverance, as some believe, in a hell redemp∣tion; but we see what will be their dreadful sentence (Rev. xx. 9.) And fire came down from God and de∣voured
<PB N="22" REF="047760_0021_10248C997913F428"/>them, and the devil that deceived them, was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, where the Beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Now I return again to set forth the glories of the hea∣venly Jerusalem.</P>
<P>(Rev. xxi. 1.) I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and first earth were passed away— That is, the first state of the church will be changed to a larger degree of glory, her former travail of trouble will be ended, all things will be new to her; and poor sinners, which is earth, earthly, and devlish and sensual will be changed, and made new and living saints; the new Jerusalem will descend down out of heaven upon them. The spirit, as the dove, was on Christ's head when he was baptized in Jordan. Also the starry hea∣vens will be a new heaven. No more thundering storms of thunder, and black clouds and hurricane winds and dismal gusts to lay waste and break the oaks of the wil∣derness; no more floods rushing down with rolling waves, nor snows nor frosts to freeze the weary labourer or traveller; no more occasion for the fleecy flocks to put the thick warm woollen cloathing on our trembling bodies. The earth will be a new earth of glory before it is destroyed, set forth by the prophet, (Isa. xxxv. 1.) The wilderness and the solitary places shall be glad for them, and the desart shall rejoice and blossom as a rose, it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and sing∣ing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it; the excellency of Carmel, and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. (Isa. lv. 12.) For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth into singing before you, and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the field shall clap their hands; instead of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there shall come up the fir tree; and instead of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er, shall come up the myrtle tree, and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign, that shall not be out off. (Isa. lxv. 25.) The wolf and the lamb shall
<PB N="23" REF="047760_0022_10248E2E719E6C50"/>lie down together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock, and dust shall be the serpent's meat; they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord. (Isa. lxvi. 10.) Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad all ye that love her; rejoice for joy with her, for thus saith the Lord; for behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations, that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abandance of her glory. So I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jeru∣salem; and when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be known towards his servants, and his indignation towards his enemies; for, behold, the Lord will come with sire and his chariot like a whirl∣wind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of sire; for by sire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many; and it shall co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, pass that I will gather all nations and tongues, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y shall come and see my glory; and this great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k will be done by the ever∣lasting gospel preached by an angel in heaven. (Rev. xiv. 6.) And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, kin∣dred, and tongue, and people; and we see the glorious work that was wrought in the seventh verse, saying, with a loud voice, fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come, and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountain of waters: this will make Babylon fall—8th verse— And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city; because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; then comes the woman out of the wilderness. (Isa. xii. 1.) And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the sun and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="047760_0023_10248C9BD656EEE0"/>
The Churches hard travail will be ended, and the man child caught up to God's throne, which will be the rising of the two witnesses which has been slaying three years and an half, which has been almost twelve hundred and sixty years since the church sled into the wilderness from the face of the dragon that poured out a flood of waters out of his mouth after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. But when Michael shall destroy the devil's war, which is come down upon the seat of the beast, as in Rev. xii. 12. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the sea, for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth his time is but short: and when the Dragon saw that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man child. What dreadful persecutions has she received from the Popish nations, in killing thousands of Christ's servants, and has executed wrath against the remnant of her seed, which ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. But soon we shall hear the Lord's voice, saying in heaven, Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night; and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. There∣fore, rejoice ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them; then sin and sorrow shall cease. (Rev. xxii. 3.) And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him, not in a temple made with stones and wood, the work of men's hands; but in the new Jerusalcm temple, which will be built up of Jew and Gentile, stones of grace, which Solomon's house typified under the law dispensation. This heavenly city is described in the 21st of Rev. descending out of heaven, which will be on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arth as glorious stones most precious, and as clear as crystal, the glory and beauty of every saint of
<PB N="25" REF="047760_0024_10248C9E0B439738"/>that temple, having twelve gates and twelve angels, which are the twelve tribes of Israel, which will be brought into it from east, west, north, and south, as far as the sun shines or men inhabit; for St. John saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it, and the inhabitants is the bride, the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>'s wife, in an everlasting marriage cove∣nant, which will never be separated, nor the union dis∣solved; but will endure for one thousand years on earth, and then afterwards in Christ's presence, face to face, an endless eternity.</P>
<P><HI>A Question asked, and Resolved.</HI></P>
<P>In what way will the people live when changed into Millennium Saints—will they labour and till the ground, and eat temporal food—and will they marry and be given in marriage, and children born, and mothers suf∣fer the pains of labour, and some die in child birth, and infants be caught from womb and breast?</P>
<P>My opinion is, that when wars shall cease, the na∣tions shall beat their swords into plough-shares, not to till the ground as formerly; for there will be no black∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>hs blowing the bellows, nor beating on anvils; but shall receive the plough-share of God's word into their stony hearts, which will plow up the fallow ground from sin, and pruned from bearing thorns that pier∣ced a Redeemer's head. The earth shall have her Sab∣bath of rest, the seventh part of time; and while the church eats temporal food, she will be under affliction of pain and death; but when she will eat nothing but the manna of Christ's body, she will enjoy perfect health, and they shall marry as they did in the days of Norh, till the flood came and swept them all away. So they will while the flood of Antichrist is sweeping away sin∣ners into perdition, when his reign shall end. They will no more dwell together man and wife, and will love all alike, with all the heart, and the whole temple will be built. Therefore, there will be no infants born after the top-stone is brought with shoutings, Grace, Grace. (Isa. lxii. 5.) For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bride∣groom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice
<PB N="26" REF="047760_0025_10248CA09097F490"/>over thee; for the Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, surely no more will I give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies, and the stranger shall not drink thy wine; sinners cannot be partakers of this bread and wine, without they are Christ's people; but his saints eat it, and they drink in the courts of holiness. (Isa. lxi. 11.) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all nations.</P>
<P>Now I shall shew forth of the pouring out of fifth and sixth vials, and what will be the dreadful, and happy, events that ill ensue. (Rev. xvi. 10.) And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the Beast, and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain. There will be great commotions of war in this time, and dismal calamities of death, when they will blaspheme the God of heaven, because of their sores and pains, and repented not of their deeds: but when the sixth angel poured out his vial on the river Euphrates, and the water was dried up; that is, the flood of persecution is brought to an end. Then the way of the kings of the East will be prepar∣ed; then the glories of the gospel will take the wings of the morning, and fly unto the uttermost parts of the earth. (Isa. lx. 10.) And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; and that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles; and that their kings may be brought; and kings shall be nursing fathers, and queens nursing mothers, and the church for the nation that will not serve thee, shall perish. Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. (Isa. lix. 19.) So shall they fear the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun, when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. (Song ii. 11, 12.) For so, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. The churches prayer, O
<PB N="27" REF="047760_0026_10248CA2415078B8"/>that my winter time-was ended; O that the reign of the Beast was over, that I might experience the sweet∣ness of the rose of Sharon in my soul. O what glory it will be when wretched sinners will bloom the flowers of glory; no more to have wrinkled faces, nor cold win∣ter hearts. Then they will sing the song of Moses and the Lamb. (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> xi. 17.) Saying, we give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned: and when the second woe is past, and when, behold, the third woe cemeth quickly; then the 7th angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever. He which testifieth these things, saith, Surely, I come quickly—Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus.</P>
